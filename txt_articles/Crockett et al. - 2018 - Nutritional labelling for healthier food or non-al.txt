Background
Nutritional labelling is advocated as a means to promote healthier food purchasing and consumption, including lower energy intake.
Internationally, many different nutritional labelling schemes have been introduced. There is no consensus on whether such labelling is
effective in promoting healthier behaviour.
Objectives
To assess the impact of nutritional labelling for food and non-alcoholic drinks on purchasing and consumption of healthier items. Our
secondary objective was to explore possible effect moderators of nutritional labelling on purchasing and consumption.
Search methods
We searched 13 electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to 26 April 2017. We also handsearched references
and citations and sought unpublished studies through websites and trials registries.
Selection criteria
Eligible studies: were randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs/Q-RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies, or in-
terrupted time series (ITS) studies; compared a labelled product (with information on nutrients or energy) with the same product
without a nutritional label; assessed objectively measured purchasing or consumption of foods or non-alcoholic drinks in real-world or
laboratory settings.

Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink purchasing and consumption (Review)

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted study data. We applied the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool and
GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. We pooled studies that evaluated similar interventions and outcomes using a random-effects
meta-analysis, and we synthesised data from other studies in a narrative summary.
Main results
We included 28 studies, comprising 17 RCTs, 5 Q-RCTs and 6 ITS studies. Most (21/28) took place in the USA, and 19 took place
in university settings, 14 of which mainly involved university students or staff. Most (20/28) studies assessed the impact of labelling
on menus or menu boards, or nutritional labelling placed on, or adjacent to, a range of foods or drinks from which participants could
choose. Eight studies provided participants with only one labelled food or drink option (in which labelling was present on a container
or packaging, adjacent to the food or on a display board) and measured the amount consumed. The most frequently assessed labelling
type was energy (i.e. calorie) information (12/28).
Eleven studies assessed the impact of nutritional labelling on purchasing food or drink options in real-world settings, including purchases
from vending machines (one cluster-RCT), grocery stores (one ITS), or restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops (three RCTs, one Q-
RCT and five ITS). Findings on vending machines and grocery stores were not interpretable, and were rated as very low quality. A
meta-analysis of the three RCTs, all of which assessed energy labelling on menus in restaurants, demonstrated a statistically significant
reduction of 47 kcal in energy purchased (MD −46.72 kcal, 95% CI −78.35, −15.10, N = 1877). Assuming an average meal of
600 kcal, energy labelling on menus would reduce energy purchased per meal by 7.8% (95% CI 2.5% to 13.1%). The quality of the
evidence for these three studies was rated as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies.
Of the remaining six studies, only two (both ITS studies involving energy labels on menus or menus boards in a coffee shop or cafeteria)
were at low risk of bias, and their results support the meta-analysis. The results of the other four studies which were conducted in a
restaurant, cafeterias (2 studies) or a coffee shop, were not clearly reported and were at high risk of bias.
Seventeen studies assessed the impact of nutritional labels on consumption in artificial settings or scenarios (henceforth referred to as
laboratory studies or settings). Of these, eight (all RCTs) assessed the effect of labels on menus or placed on a range of food options. A
meta-analysis of these studies did not conclusively demonstrate a reduction in energy consumed during a meal (MD −50 kcal, 95%
CI −104.41, 3.88, N = 1705). We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may
change with further studies.
Six laboratory studies (four RCTs and two Q-RCTs) assessed the impact of labelling a single food or drink option (such as chocolate,
pasta or soft drinks) on energy consumed during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically
significant difference in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.05, 95% CI −0.17 to 0.27, N = 732). However, the confidence intervals
were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence as low, so our confidence in the effect
estimate is limited and may change with further studies.
There was no evidence that nutritional labelling had the unintended harm of increasing energy purchased or consumed. Indirect
evidence came from five laboratory studies that involved mislabelling single nutrient content (i.e. placing low energy or low fat labels
on high-energy foods) during a snack or meal. A meta-analysis of these studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase
in energy (kcal) consumed (SMD 0.19, 95% CI −0.14to 0.51, N = 718). The effect was small and the confidence intervals wide,
suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We rated the quality of the evidence from these studies as very low, providing very little
confidence in the effect estimate.
Authors’ conclusions
Findings from a small body of low-quality evidence suggest that nutritional labelling comprising energy information on menus may
reduce energy purchased in restaurants. The evidence assessing the impact on consumption of energy information on menus or on
a range of food options in laboratory settings suggests a similar effect to that observed for purchasing, although the evidence is less
definite and also of low quality.
Accordingly, and in the absence of observed harms, we tentatively suggest that nutritional labelling on menus in restaurants could be
used as part of a wider set of measures to tackle obesity. Additional high-quality research in real-world settings is needed to enable more
certain conclusions.
Further high-quality research is also needed to address the dearth of evidence from grocery stores and vending machines and to assess
potential moderators of the intervention effect, including socioeconomic status.

Nutritional labelling to promote healthier consumption and purchasing of food or drinks
A poor diet including excessive energy intake is an important cause of ill health. Nutritional labelling may help people to make healthier
food choices.
What is the aim of this review?
This review investigated whether nutritional labels (i.e. labels providing information about nutritional content) persuade people to buy
or consume different (healthy) kinds of food. We searched for all available evidence to answer this question and found 28 studies.
Key messages
There is evidence to suggest that nutritional labelling, with energy information (e.g. calorie counts) on menus, may reduce energy
purchased in restaurants, but more high-quality studies are needed to make this finding more certain.
What was studied in the review?
Some studies assessed buying food or drinks from vending machines, grocery stores, restaurants, cafeterias, or coffee shops. Others
assessed the amount of food or drink consumed during a snack or meal in an artificial setting or scenario (referred to as laboratory
studies or settings).
What are the main results of the review?
Nutritional labelling on restaurant menus reduced the amount of energy (i.e. calories) purchased, but the quality of the three studies
that contributed to this finding was low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further studies. Eight
studies assessed this same type of intervention in laboratory settings, but instead of evaluating how much energy participants purchased,
these studies evaluated how much energy participants consumed. These studies did not conclusively demonstrate a reduction in energy
consumed when menus or foods were labelled, and they were also of low quality.
In addition, six laboratory studies assessed how much energy participants consumed when they were given one food or drink option
with or without labels, and five laboratory studies assessed how much energy participants consumed when foods were experimentally
labelled as low energy or low fat when they were actually high-energy foods (i.e. mislabelling). Results from these two groups of studies
were inconclusive and of low, or in the case of mislabelling studies, very low quality. We found some studies that assessed labelling on
vending machines and grocery stores, but their results were not easy to interpret, so we could not use them to inform this review.
How up-to-date is this review?
The evidence is current to 26 April 2017.

Description of the condition
Poor diets contribute to the global prevalence and burden of obe-
sity and preventable diseases including cardiovascular disease, dia-
betes and many forms of cancer. Worldwide, excess weight is now
a problem in countries of all income brackets, with 2.8 million
people estimated to die annually as a result of obesity (WHO
Obesity Fact Sheet). In the UK, suboptimal diet is one of the lead-
ing causes of years of life lost (Newton 2015). Diet-related dis-
ease is a substantial threat to the health of populations and a chal-
lenge to the effective and economic provision of health services
(Foresight 2007; WHO 2013). However, changing behaviour to
halt and reverse rises in these potentially preventable diseases is
difficult. While many people want to engage in behaviours that
promote good health, including healthy eating, most people find it
difficult to implement and maintain them (Ogden 2007). Recog-
nition is growing that these difficulties are in part due to the phys-
ical environments that surround us, which can exert considerable
influences on our health-related behaviours, with relatively little
conscious engagement (Hollands 2016; Marteau 2012). Altering
these environments may provide a catalyst for behaviour change
(Das 2012; Marteau 2012). In recent work, stemming from a sys-
tematic scoping review (Hollands 2013a; Hollands 2013b), we de-
scribed a set of interventions to change health-related behaviours
that involve altering the small-scale physical environment in which
that behaviour is performed (Hollands 2017b). This includes in-
terventions that use text and symbols to convey specific informa-
tion about products and their use - nutritional labelling being one
example.
Description of the intervention
Nutritional labels provide information about the nutritional con-
tent of a food or drink. The type of information provided varies,
for example, with regard to the nutrients such as fat, sugar, salt
or energy content. The form of providing information also varies,
for example, as a single number, as a proportion of a guideline for
daily consumption, or with colours indicative of relative healthi-
ness.
Until recently, most food that was eaten was homemade from raw
ingredients, making the content apparent to those planning and
preparing a household’s meals. Progressively, however, people have
been preparing fewer of their meals from scratch; pre-prepared,
often pre-packaged, meals now form a substantial part of dietary
intake in many parts of the world. These meals or snacks are often
complex items, consisting of a mix of ingredients that make it
difficult for consumers to know their nutritional content.
For several decades, pre-packaged foods have provided ingredient
and nutrient declarations in order to provide consumers with in-
formation about the product. In 1967, the US Federal Trade Com-
mission enacted the Fair Packaging and Labelling Act, requiring
that food should be “honestly and informatively” labelled (FTC
2016). In 1990, further legislation in the USA (the Nutrition La-
belling and Education Act) made nutritional labelling compulsory
on all pre-packaged foods, and nutrient content claims, such as
’low fat’, had to meet Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regu-
lations(FDA 1994). Inthe same year, the EuropeanUnionpasseda
directive to guide ’clearly visible’ nutritional labelling (EEC 1990).
This labelling was not compulsory unless associated with a nutri-
tional claim, although it was widely adopted. In December 2014
the Food Information Regulations superseded the previous direc-
tive, making ingredient and nutrition declarations mandatory for
most pre-packaged foods from December 2016 (European Union
2011). These regulations stipulate that manufacturers must pro-
vide nutritional information in a consistent format for most pre-
packed foods including information on fat, saturated fat, carbo-
hydrate, total sugars, protein and salt (expressed per 100 g or per
100 ml of the food product).
Additionally, manufacturers are able to repeat information in ’the
principal field of vision’ i.e. front of pack. This is purely voluntary
but, where provided, only information on energy or energy plus
fat, saturated fats, sugars and salt can be given, either per 100g
or 100 ml and/or per portion. These front-of-pack nutritional
labelling schemes have usually been designed to guide consumer
choice and sometimes include an interpretative component, such
as reference to daily intake guidelines or colour coding to indicate
relative healthiness. These can supplement, but not replace, the
mandatory, back-of-pack nutrition declarations. In the UK, for
example, a voluntary front-of-pack scheme using red, amber and
green colour coding according to nutrient content, is widely used.
In Sweden, a voluntary front-of-pack keyhole label, which aims
to help consumers choose healthier foods, has been used for the
last 20 years. Norway and Denmark also adopted this approach in
2016 (Nordic Council of Ministers 2016). In Australia and New
Zealand, a healthy heart tick symbol has been in use for over 25
years, but in June 2014 a new voluntary front-of-pack Health Star
Rating System began to gradually take its place (Commonwealth
of Australia 2016). This label provides information on energy,
saturated fat, sugars, sodium and fibre, together with a rating of
the overall nutritional profile, ranging from half a star to five stars.
Other countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand,
have adopted mandatory nutritional labelling. In Australia and
New Zealand, mandatory labelling of all manufactured foods took
effect in December 2002 (Food Standards 2002). This requires a
nutrition information panel that presents details on energy, fat,
saturated fat, protein, carbohydrate, sugar and sodium per serving
and per 100 g of food. In Canada, labelling has been mandatory
on almost all pre-packaged foods since December 2007 (Health
Canada 2016). This labelling includes a ’Nutrition facts’ table,
which provides information on the amount of 13 core nutrients
and energy in a defined amount of food. In these countries, there

 are no specific requirements regarding whether the label is placed
on the front or back of the pack. Other countries with manda-
tory nutritional labelling include Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay, Israel, Gulf Cooperation
Council members, Japan, India, China, Hong Kong, South Korea,
Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand (EUFIC 2013).
In addition to labelling pre-packaged foods, some countries have
introduced labelling on menus. Mandatory energy labelling in
restaurants was first introduced in the state of New York (USA)
in 2008 (Dumanovsky 2011). In December 2016, the FDA ’fi-
nal rule’ for all states became effective, requiring that energy in-
formation be listed on menus and menu boards in chain restau-
rants with 20 or more locations as well as in all vending machines
by May 2017 (FDA 2016). Similarly, the Healthy Menu Choices
Act 2015 came into force in January 2017 in Ontario, Canada.
Since February 2011, some states of Australia have also imple-
mented a labelling policy, requiring mandatory energy labelling
on menus in fast food chains and on vending machines (Obesity
Policy Coalition 2014).
In the absence of international agreements, there is considerable
variation in both the information provided and the presentation
format for nutritional labelling (see Figure 1 a,b,c for some ex-
amples of current nutritional labels). In a taxonomy to classify
health-related food labelling, Rayner 2013 divides point-of-pur-
chase food labels into two broad classes: ’information’ and ’claims’.
While useful for organising the broad range of labels on foods, the
taxonomy is insufficiently detailed for studying their behavioural
impact. For example, it does not discriminate between labels that
are numeric, verbal or pictorial in form. Consequently, it is diffi-
cult to use this typology to compare interventions across the range
of dimensions likely to influence the effectiveness of labels for
changing product purchasing and consumption.
Figure 1.
Examples of nutritional labels used in practice
Front-of-packnutritional labellingapproachesfall intothree broad
categories.
1. Numerical information on nutrient content.
2. Interpretative labelling, for example the use of colour
coding to indicate how healthy products are.
3. Logos that indicate whether a product meets a pre-
determined guideline regarding healthiness.
In summary, nutritional labelling has been recommended as a
means to enable consumers to make healthier choices about what
they buy and how much they eat (WHO 2004). However, the ev-
idence for the impact of nutritional labelling on food purchasing
and consumption is unclear. Developing a more comprehensive
understanding of this impact would inform future policy decisions
about the implementation of nutritional labelling. It would also
inform our understanding of the relationships between different
types of information on food packages and thus inform both fu-
ture implementation and evaluation of the effects of nutritional
labelling.
How the intervention might work

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Effects of nutritional labelling
Nutritional labelling may impact on population health by leading
to healthier food purchasing and ultimately, healthier consump-
tion. Healthier food purchasing and consumption are defined as:
• increased purchasing or consumption of products
considered healthy in relation to recognised nutritional
guidelines; and/or
• decreased purchasing or consumption of products
considered less healthy in relation to these standards.
Processes by which nutritional labelling may have an
impact on food choices and health
Nutritional labelling has been proposed as an intervention that
enables individuals to make healthier choices about the foods
they purchase and consume (Cowburn 2005; Dobbs 2014; WHO
2004). Figure 2 shows the logic model explaining the processes
by which nutritional labelling might be expected to lead to food
purchasing and consumption, resulting in improved health. These
include increasing understanding of the healthiness of food and
drink, as well as increasing the availability of healthy foods. The
setting in which people purchase food (e.g. a grocery store, fast
food or other restaurant) (Bollinger 2011; Harnack 2008a), ex-
pectations of the taste of the food (Wansink 2004), and food prices
(Horgen 2002) may all modify the impact of labels. The cultural
context in which the food is purchased or consumed may also have
an impact because diets and attitudes to nutrition vary between
countries (Brownell 2006), and such differences may have an im-
pact on the behavioural effects of labels. Finally, individual differ-
ences in body weight (Wansink 2006 - study 3), socioeconomic
status (Malam 2009), gender (Aron 1995), and dietary restraint
(i.e. the extent to which an individual is actively trying to restrict
their energy intake) may further modify the impact of nutritional
labelling.
Figure 2.
Logic model of the process by which nutritional labelling may have an impact on diets and health
Direct and indirect impact of labels on the individual
The use of nutritional labels may have an impact not only on indi-
viduals who purchase or consume the food but also on the restau-
rant or retailer by altering the range of products available or, on
the food industry as a whole, by encouraging the reformulation of
products to achieve a healthier nutritional profile on a visible label.
Figure 2 indicates the possible impact of nutritional labelling on
the behaviour of the food industry directly, through stimulating
reformulation of products and indirectly, from changes in con-
sumer purchasing and consumption.

 Why it is important to do this review
The large and increasing prevalence of diet-related disease world-
wide requires population-level interventions to promote health-
ier diets. Although nutritional labelling has been implemented in
North America, Europe and Australasia, there is no consensus on
whether it is effective for achieving healthier purchasing and con-
sumption or on which domain, if any, labels are most effective.
The variety of schemes implemented may contribute to confu-
sion. The absence of consensus on nutritional labelling policy is
reflected in different recommendations and changes to recommen-
dations about implementation that have been made internation-
ally. For example, while the European Union recommended the
use of guideline daily amounts with optional “additional forms of
expression” (European Commission 2011), the UK Department
of Health has recommended subsequent adoption of a labelling
system combining elements of guideline daily amounts and traffic
light labelling (UK Dept Health 2013). Similarly, while the im-
plementation of a traffic-light labelling scheme in Australia was
recommended (Blewett 2011), subsequently a new interpretative
’Health Stars’ scheme has been developed (Australian Dept Health
and Aging 2013).
There is a need for robust evidence to support decisions regarding
the implementation of nutritional labelling and the development
of food policy and programmes globally. Although previous sys-
tematic reviews have evaluated the impact of nutritional labelling,
they have not restricted primary outcomes to objectively measured
food or drink purchasing and consumption behaviours. Some re-
views, for example, include studies with both objective and self-re-
ported behavioural outcomes as well as non-behavioural outcomes
(Campos 2011; Cecchini 2016; Grunert 2007; Mhurchu 2007).
The current review identified and collated existing research evi-
dence concerning the impact of nutritional labels on food pur-
chasing and consumption to assess the beneficial and adverse im-
pacts of nutritional labelling on diets and the factors that moderate
these effects.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-ran-
domised controlled trials (Q-RCTs) that compared a labelling in-
tervention with a no-label (or incomplete label) control. We in-
cluded quasi-randomised studies, in which the randomisation se-
quence was not truly random (Reeves 2011), because of the diffi-
culty of implementing true randomisation at an aggregate, popu-
lation level. We also considered cluster-randomised studies, when
randomisation is by site (e.g. grocery store).
Other eligible study designs included interrupted time series stud-
ies (ITS) that compared purchasing or consumption before and
after the implementation of nutritional labelling. In line with the
Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC)
group recommendations, we only included ITS studies if they had
a clearly defined time point at which the intervention occurred and
at least three observation periods both before and after the inter-
vention (EPOC 2015). Authors had to present these data within a
graph and/or at the very least analyse them using regression anal-
ysis, preferably using segmented regression. Based on Cochrane
recommendations, we excluded studies that reported only a sim-
ple pre- and postintervention comparison unless we could make a
valid justification for their inclusion or if a re-analysis could enable
the inclusion of data from multiple observations before and af-
ter the intervention using repeated measures methods (Cochrane
Public Health Review Group 2010; EPOC 2015).
Finally, we also considered controlled before-and-after studies
(CBA) that measured purchasing or consumption before and af-
ter implementation of an intervention in non-randomised inter-
vention and control groups. To be included in the review, studies
needed to have at least two intervention sites and two control sites,
and the characteristics of the different groups had to be similar
(EPOC 2015).
Types of participants
Adults or children purchasing or consuming food or drink were
eligible for inclusion. Purchases included those bought by an in-
dividual for their personal consumption, or for consumption by
a small group that the individual belonged to, such as their fam-
ily. Food or drink purchases included those from any retail outlet
including grocery stores and other food stores, vending machines,
cafeterias and both fast food and non-fast food restaurants.
Types of interventions
Eligible interventions included the nutritional labelling of a food
or a non-alcoholic drink product. We identified three characteris-
tics of nutritional labelling with a potential impact on behaviour.
Type of nutrient. The label provides information about one or
more nutrient or energy contained in the product. These nutrients
typically include those for which reductions in intake are recom-
mended, including fat, saturated fat, salt and sugar, and they may
10

 also include those for which increases in intake are recommended,
such as vitamins or minerals. We did not consider warning labels
about product content that pose an immediate health threat to
some people, for example ’contains peanuts’, to be nutritional la-
bels in the current context. Figure 1c shows the US nutrition facts
label indicating a range of nutrients that labels may describe. Al-
though technically not a nutrient, we included energy (e.g. calo-
ries) in this category.
Amount of nutrient. Information is given indicating the amount of
different types of nutrients or energy contained in the product or
in a serving size. This information may be absolute or relative. If
absolute, the label would use numeric information about content,
for example, ’total fat - 12 grams’. If relative, the label would use a
verbal descriptorof the amountof the nutrientorenergycontained
in the product such as ’lower fat’. However, ’a good source of
vitamin C’ or ’contains whole grain’ would not be considered a
nutritional label as ’good’ and ’contains’ are not descriptors of
amount.
Visibility. The labels needed to be visible upon purchase or con-
sumption. In some cases, the label might be placed on the front
of product packages or containers. In other cases, the label might
not appear on but rather alongside the product. Examples include
labels on a shelf where the food or drink is being displayed in a
grocery store, on the exterior of a vending machine selling snacks,
on the counter from which the food is being served in a cafeteria,
or on a restaurant menu from which food is being selected.
We classified nutritional labels that did not have the characteristics
specified above as incomplete and considered them ineligible. We
only included interventions that combined nutritional labelling
with other interventions if we could isolate the impact of the
nutritional label. We did not consider logos providing a summary
assessment of the healthiness of a product or general health claims
to provide nutritional information and so excluded them from this
review.
As noted above, the intervention labelling group had to be com-
pared with a no-labelling (or incomplete) control group. Thus, we
excluded studies that only compared two or more different types
of labelling schemes without a control group.
Types of outcome measures
Eligible studies had to report an objectively measured behavioural
outcome of food or drinks purchased or consumed. Given that
alcohol consumption involves different processes from non-alco-
holic drinks, we investigated the impact of nutritional labelling on
purchasing and consumption of non-alcoholic drinks only.
Primary outcomes
The primary outcomes were healthier choices of:
• food or drink purchased (i.e. payment with money) from
vending machines, supermarkets or grocery stores, restaurants,
cafeterias or other contexts in which food and drink for
immediate consumption are sold;
• food or drinks consumed in real-world or laboratory
settings; and
• harm or unintended consequences of nutritional labels,
such as increased energy consumption from single nutrient
labelling implying a healthier product.
Purchasing
We considered healthier food and drink purchasing to be:
• fewer purchases of less healthy items or overall reductions in
purchases of less healthy target nutrients or energy;
• more purchases of healthier items or overall increases in
purchases of healthier target nutrients or energy.
Food and drink purchases could be assessed either at the individ-
ual or population group level. In the context of this review, an
individual level purchasing outcome measure required direct ob-
servation of what was purchased:
• from a vending machine; this comprised a record of
everything purchased by the individual on that visit, or a record
of items, such as chocolate bars, targeted in the intervention;
• in a restaurant; this comprised a record of everything
purchased by the individual for consumption on that visit, or a
record of items, such as soft drinks, targeted in the intervention
and purchased for consumption on that visit;
• in a grocery store; this comprised a record of everything
purchased by the individual on that visit, or a record of items,
such as ready meals, targeted by the intervention and purchased
on that visit.
At a population level, purchasing data had to be derived from
sales data supplied by the retailer from till receipts. Such data
could be presented as sales of specific items or as total nutrients or
energy purchased, calculated from the sales data presented. When
studiesassessedpurchasingintermsof the overall healthinessof the
specific product labelled, analyses presented in the research reports
needed to indicate which products were considered more or less
healthy in line with the labelling given. We excluded studies that
evaluated intention to purchase or intention to consume without
an objectively assessed measure of the behaviour.
Consumption
We considered healthier food or drink consumption to be:
• lower consumption of less healthy foods or an overall
reduction in consumption of less healthy target nutrients or
energy;
• greater consumption of healthier foods or an overall
increase in consumption of healthier target nutrients.
Studies had to assess consumption by an objective measure, cal-
culating the amount of a snack or a meal consumed by subtract-
11

Cochrane Collaboration.
 ing the amount of food remaining after consumption from the
amount of food served. This was specified as either:
• amount of a food or drink consumed; or
• total target nutrients or energy consumed as part of a meal.
To assess the absolute healthiness of products forming part of in-
terventions included in this review would require knowledge of
the full nutritional content of each product offered to study par-
ticipants and how it was consumed relative to other components
of the diet. Therefore, the definition of a more or less healthy
product is based on the relative composition of the items tested,
with reference to international dietary guidelines.
Secondary outcomes
There were no secondary outcomes.
Other measures
We also assessed possible moderating effects on the primary out-
comes above, presented in the section below on Subgroup analysis
and investigation of heterogeneity.

Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts of pa-
pers for inclusion, resolving any disagreements through discus-
sion. Failure to reach consensus led to discussion with a third re-
viewer. We obtained full-text papers of potentially eligible studies
identified during the first screening phase, and we assessed them
for inclusion using the same procedures as for titles and abstracts.
Data extraction and management
We developed a draft data extraction form based on the Cochrane
Public Health template and modified it to allow extraction of data
specific to this review. Two reviewers independently piloted the
drafttoensure thatitenabledreliable andaccurate extractionof ap-
propriate data and then independently extracted all data on study
and participant characteristics along with results. When a reviewer
was an author of an included study, a third reviewer was involved
in the data extraction process. If reported, we also extracted data
on measures relating to the process of implementing the interven-
tion, including any data on its cost. Once the first phase of data
extraction was complete, the first author reconciled the two sets
of data extraction forms. Where there were inconsistencies, the
two data extractors met to discuss and reach a consensus. Where
data were missing or unclear, we contacted study authors. Finally,
one author entered the data into RevMan, and a second author
checked the data entry.
When multiple papers reported data from the same study, we
considered the papers together as one study.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed risk of bias for RCTs using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’
assessment tool (Higgins 2011).
1. Was allocation sequence randomly generated using an
appropriate method (selection bias)?
2. Was allocation adequately concealed (selection bias)?
3. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed
(attrition bias)?
4. Were reports of the study free of suggestion of selective
outcome reporting (reporting bias)?
5. Were participants and personnel blinded to knowledge of
allocated interventions adequately (performance bias)?
6. Were outcome assessors blinded to allocated intervention
(detection bias)?
7. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could
put it at risk of bias?
We considered the RCTs to be at an overall low risk of bias when
they met all of the above criteria or when there was not more than
one unclear criterion (with no criterion assessed as high risk). We
judged studies to be at unclear risk of bias if more than one domain
was at unclear risk of bias (with no criterion assessed as high risk)
and at high risk of bias if one or more criteria were not adequately
met.
For ITS studies, we implemented the Cochrane Public Health
Review Group Guidelines for assessing risk of bias (Cochrane
Public Health Review Group 2010).
1. Was the intervention independent of other changes?
2. Was the shape of the intervention effect pre-specified
(specifically, the purpose of the intervention should be the
purpose of the analysis)?
3. Was the intervention unlikely to affect data collection?
4. Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately
prevented during the study?
5. Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?
6. Was the study free of selective outcome reporting?
7. Was the study apparently free of other problems that could
put it at risk of bias?
We considered ITS studies to be at an overall low risk of bias when
they adequately addressed all of the above criteria and at high risk
if one or more of the above criteria were not met.
We planned to assess the risk of bias of controlled before-and-after
studies using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies
(EPHPP 2010). As we failed to identify any relevant controlled
before-and-after studies for inclusion in this review, we do not
provide any further details of this tool (for more information see
EPHPP 2010).
Measures of treatment effect
Purchase data could be either dichotomous (e.g. a more versus
less healthy choice) or continuous (e.g. mean amount of nutrient
or energy purchased). Consumption was generally assessed using
continuous data (e.g. total nutrients or mean energy consumed).
As the included studies reported no dichotomous data, we cal-
culated a mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for each study when possible. In two studies, however, it was
only possible to calculate a standardised mean difference (SMD)
with 95% CIs because the authors reported only mean kcal and

 F statistics (Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink 2006 - study 3).
We calculated combined effect sizes using an MD with 95% CIs
when studies used similar interventions and outcomes, or using
an SMD when the outcomes differed (e.g. when trials measured
outcomes as energy consumed at one meal or over several meals).
In both cases, we used a random-effects model to pool the data.
In order to re-express effect sizes using a more familiar metric,
we calculated the percentage reduction in energy consumed over
a typical meal, using an average of 600 kcal as a baseline. This
amount was based on mean daily energy intake across the UK pop-
ulation of 1727 kcal or 7226 kJ (standard deviation (SD) 537 kcal
or 2247 kJ, using data from the UK National Diet and Nutrition
Survey (National Centre for Social Research 2012). Our approach
to re-expressing effect sizes was based on Hollands 2015.
For ITS studies, we aimed to present statistical comparisons of
time trends before and after the intervention (EPOC 2015). In
all of the ITS studies, we present the results as described by the
study authors, typically as regression analyses. When studies also
presented data graphically, we did not attempt any re-analysis us-
ing segmented time series regression techniques if the data were al-
ready appropriately analysed by the study authors or if we did not
consider the study to be of sufficient quality to warrant re-analysis.
We considered one ITS study to be at low risk of bias (Bollinger
2011), but we could not re-analyse the data presented graphically
due to a lack of information. The figures presented weekly calories
per transaction, but there were no data on the number of transac-
tions per week; this means that the absolute and relative variability
of each point was unknown and could not be modelled with time
series to provide unbiased estimates.
Unit of analysis issues
Foreligible cluster-randomisedtrials, we plannedtoadjustthe data
to account for clustering if the study authors had not already done
so. However, we only included one cluster-RCT in the review, and
the appropriate data needed to report and adjust the results were
not available.
Dealing with missing data
We included all data in the review using an intention-to-treat ap-
proach where possible. Where studies reported dropouts or with-
drawals, we extracted data on the number and reasons for missing
data.
Assessment of heterogeneity
In order to deal with inevitable methodological variability among
studies that evaluate food or drinks consumed in real-world or
laboratory settings, we took a broader perspective and considered
that studies that evaluated labelling as an intervention and energy
purchasing or consumption as an outcome were potentially sim-
ilar enough to be combined in meta-analyses of purchasing and
consumption. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by visually ex-
amining the extent to which confidence intervals overlapped. Ad-
ditionally, we reported the I² statistic, a point estimate of inconsis-
tency, and interpreted the levels of heterogeneity made based on
the recommendations of Deeks 2011.
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned to use funnel plots to identify small study effects,
which in turn, could indicate publication bias. None of the in-
cluded meta-analyses, however, included more than 10 studies, so
based on the recommendations of Sterne 2011, we did not carry
out this action.
Data synthesis
Where one study reported a number of different types of inter-
ventions or outcome measures, we made the following decisions
as to which data we would include in the analyses.
1. For included studies with more than one eligible
intervention arm, we combined data when studies contained
information about the same product characteristic (e.g. energy),
albeit in multiple ways (e.g. varying in whether presented as
numbers, colour-coded, activity-equivalents, and whether
presented with recommended daily energy intake).
2. Where studies assessed the impact of nutritional labelling
adjacent to a range of food products and it was not possible to
extract an effect summary for the range of food products, we
included the data for the product representing the most
complete meal, for example, sales of entrées (as opposed to sales
of a side dish) (e.g. Dubbert 1984). If no products represented
more or less complete meals, we extracted data for products
containing the greatest amount of energy.
3. Where studies reported a number of outcomes, such as
consumption of a range of different nutrients, we used the most
frequently reported outcome among the included studies (e.g.
Harnack 2008a). Had outcomes been reported in the same study
that related to both increased consumption of healthier foods
and decreased consumption of less healthy foods, we would have
prioritised the latter.
Most included studies reported on energy (described by the study
authors as ’calories’) as the outcome unit. Some reported on grams
or millilitres (e.g. Cavanagh 2014; Roberto 2012; Vermeer 2011),
and we converted these to calories using the formula presented in
DeGroot 2012. We analysed purchasing and consumption studies
separately, as we considered them, a priori, to be different out-
comes. In the process of conducting the review, it became apparent
that the studies also differed in terms of how many labelledoptions
participants had to choose from and what kind(s) of nutritional
content the labels described. Participants had to make absolute
judgments when given only one labelled option and relative judg-
ments when provided with a myriad of options labelleddifferently.

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Thus, we analysed these studies separately. We employed Review
Manager 5 (RevMan 5) to perform meta-analyses, using the in-
verse variance approach for continuous data (RevMan 2014). We
synthesised data from non-randomised studies in a narrative sum-
mary.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned subgroup analyses to assess effect modifiers and ex-
plore them as sources of heterogeneity. We chose the potential
modifiers based on previous research or as considered in the sec-
tion How the intervention might work. Due to a lack of informa-
tion reported in the included studies, we were unable to conduct
many of the planned subgroup analyses (see Differences between
protocol and review). There were, however, sufficient data to ex-
plore two possible moderators of the main effects of nutritional
labelling: dietary restraint and study country. We used the generic
inverse variance approach to pool the MDs or SMDs, both across
studies and within subgroups.
Sensitivity analysis
We repeated meta-analyses, omitting all studies at high or unclear
risk of bias.
Summary of findings table
We prepared the Summary of findings table using the main out-
comes evaluated in the included studies and as specified in Primary
outcomes: food purchased from vending machines, food pur-
chased from a grocery store, food purchased from a restaurant,
cafeteria or coffee shop, food consumed in a laboratory setting
(where participants were given a range of options), food consumed
in a laboratory setting (where participants were given a single op-
tion), and harms (food consumed with misleading labels). All of
the participants in these studies were from general populations
groups, so may be considered medium risk populations. All com-
parisons presented in the Summary of findings table evaluate nu-
tritional labelling (broadly) versus no labelling (i.e. it was not the
remit of this systematic review to compare the effectiveness of dif-
ferent types of nutritional labels). Some of the summary results
were presented as MD while others had to be presented using
SMD for reasons described above (Measures of treatment effect).
We used the GRADE system to assess the quality of evidence
for each outcome (Schünemann 2011). Using the four standard
GRADE levels of quality (high, moderate, low and very low) we
assigned evidence from RCTs an initial quality rating of high and
evidence from non-RCTS an initial rating of low. We upgraded
(for observational studies only) or downgraded these levels based
on our judgments regarding risk of bias, precision, consistency,
directness and publication bias. We interpreted the overall quality
level for each outcome following definitions provided by Balshem
2011.
We report the quality level assigned for each outcome, along with
justification for the decisions, in the Results.

Description of studies
Results of the search
Our search strategy yielded 50,270 unique records. Screening of
titles and abstracts resulted in 263 records plus 15 trial registries
(i.e. 278 records) that were potentially eligible and whose full
text we reviewed. Overall, 28 studies (27 published and 1 unpub-
lished study), presented in 32 papers, met the inclusion criteria
(see Figure 3), while we excluded 246 records (Characteristics of
excluded studies). We also identified one relevant ongoing study
(see Ongoing studies), but no data were available at the time of
completing the current review.

 Included studies
Study design
Of the 28 studies included in the review, 17 were RCTs: 16 of these
were randomised by individual (Cavanagh 2014; Crockett 2014;
Ebneter 2013; Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a; Girz 2012 - study 1;
Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing; Hammond 2013; Harnack
2008a; James 2015; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010; Roberto 2012;
Temple 2010; VanEpps 2016), while one was randomised by
cluster, with vending machines being the unit of randomisation
(Bergen 2006). In addition, there were five Q-RCTs (Allan 2015;
Kral 2002; Vermeer 2011; Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink 2006
- study 3), plus six ITS studies (Balasubramanian 2002; Bollinger
2011; Chu 2009; Cioffi 2015; Dubbert 1984; Holmes 2013).
Bollinger 2011 wasdesignedasacontrolledbefore-and-afterstudy,
but it was only possible to extract data at different time periods
for the intervention group and not the comparison group, so we
treated it as an ITS.
All studies were in high-income countries, with most (21 studies)
taking place in the USA. Four studies took place in Canada, and
three in Europe (two in the UK and one in the Netherlands).
Participants
Fourteen studies recruited university students or staff (Bergen
2006; Cavanagh 2014; Chu 2009; Cioffi 2015; Ebneter 2013;
Girz 2012 - study 1; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing; James
2015; Kral 2002; Platkin 2014; Temple 2010; Wansink 2006 -
study 1; Wansink 2006 - study 3), six recruited university students
or staff as well as members of the general population (Allan 2015;
Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a; Hammond 2013; Roberto 2010;
Roberto 2012), and six recruited from general population groups
(Balasubramanian 2002; Bollinger 2011; Dubbert 1984; Harnack
2008a; VanEpps 2016; Vermeer 2011). Of the remaining two
studies, Holmes 2013 recruited participants from a high-income
population, while Crockett 2014 actively sought to include lower
income groups by recruiting in more socially deprived areas.
Twenty-six studies included adult participants, one included ado-
lescents and adults (Harnack 2008a), and one study targeted fam-
ilies of young children by labelling a children’s menu (Holmes
2013). Four studies explicitly reported recruiting women only
(Cavanagh 2014; Ebneter 2013; Kral 2002; Platkin 2014), but
the included studies did not consistently describe full details of
study participants (including mean age, sex and ethnicity).
Interventions and comparisons
All of the included studies compared at least one form of labelling
with nolabelling, with most(20/28) evaluating labellingon menus
or menu boards, or nutritional labelling placed on, or adjacent
to, a range of foods from which participants could choose (Allan
2015; Balasubramanian 2002; Bergen 2006; Bollinger 2011; Chu
2009; Cioffi 2015; Dubbert 1984; Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a;
Girz 2012 -study 1; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing, Hammond
2013; Harnack 2008a; Holmes 2013; James 2015; Platkin 2014;
Roberto 2010; Temple 2010; VanEpps 2016). The remaining
eight studies provided participants with only one food or drink
option to choose from (Cavanagh 2014; Crockett 2014; Ebneter
2013; Kral2002; Roberto 2012; Wansink 2006 -study 1; Wansink
2006 - study 3; Vermeer 2011). In these eight studies, the nu-
tritional label was on the container or packaging, adjacent to the
food, or on a display board.
Twelve studies included an intervention arm that assessed abso-
lute energy labels on food or drinks without any other informa-
tion or formatting, such as the use of colour coding (e.g. traf-
fic light format) (Allan 2015; Bollinger 2011; Cavanagh 2014;
Ebneter 2013; Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a; Girz 2012 - study
1; Girz ongoing, Hammond 2013; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010;
VanEpps 2016). Four of these studies also included an interven-
tion arm that assessed energy information with traffic light for-
mat interventions (Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a; Hammond 2013;
VanEpps 2016). Six studies evaluated energy labelling plus other
information (e.g. recommendation of daily energy intake or en-
ergy density) (Girz 2012 - study 2; Harnack 2008a; James 2015;
Kral 2002; Roberto 2010; Vermeer 2011), one of which was also
colour coded to the level of energy density (Kral2002). Five studies
evaluated labels that provided information on energy or fat con-
tent using terms such as ’high’ or ’low’ (Balasubramanian 2002;
Crockett 2014; Dubbert 1984; Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink
2006 - study 3), one of which also used colour coding in the same
treatment arm (Crockett 2014).Three studies compared ’nutrition
facts’ labelling (e.g. total energy, serving size (grams), fat (grams),
protein (grams), and carbohydrates (grams)) (Chu 2009; Cioffi
2015; Temple 2010). One study evaluated a ’Smart Choices’ label
(with information on energy per serving and servings per package)
(Roberto 2012), one study evaluated labels with energy informa-
tion and exercise equivalents (Platkin 2014), one evaluated energy
and fat content labelling (Holmes 2013), and one study evaluated
a ’0 calories 0 carbs’ label (Bergen 2006).
Nine of the included studies evaluated a second or third treatment
arm that was also eligible for inclusion in this review (Crockett
2014; Ebneter 2013; Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a; Hammond
2013; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010; Roberto 2012; VanEpps
2016). Of these,sevenhadtreatmentarmsthatcontainedinforma-
tion about the same product characteristic in multiple ways (e.g.
calories only and calories plus a traffic light format), so we com-

 bined these arms as a single labelling intervention (Ellison 2013;
Ellison 2014a; Hammond 2013; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010;
Roberto 2012; VanEpps 2016). The other two studies evaluated
a second treatment arm, considered separately in this review (low
fat or energy labels on high-fat foods) (Crockett 2014; Ebneter
2013).
Twenty-five studies used a no-label control (Allan 2015; Cavanagh
2014; Crockett 2014; Balasubramanian 2002; Bergen 2006;
Bollinger 2011; Chu 2009; Cioffi 2015; Dubbert 1984; Ellison
2013; Ellison 2014a; Girz 2012 - study 1; Girz 2012 - study 2;
Girz ongoing; Hammond 2013; Harnack 2008a; Holmes 2013;
James 2015; Kral 2002; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010; Roberto
2012; Temple 2010; VanEpps 2016; Vermeer 2011), and three
studies included a regular label control (Ebneter 2013; Wansink
2006 - study 1; Wansink 2006 - study 3). Of these three studies,
Ebneter 2013 compared ’regular fat M&M’s’ with additional en-
ergy information on the label versus ’regular fat M&M’s’ without
energy information on the label. Wansink 2006 - study 1 com-
pared ’new low fat M&M’s label versus a ’new colours on regular
M&M’sn label, and Wansink 2006 - study 3 compared a ’Low-fat
Rocky Mountain Granola’ label with a ’Regular Rocky Mountain
Granola’ label.
The included studies aimed to either decrease consumption or
purchasing of less healthy foods or increase consumption or pur-
chasing of relatively healthier foods, with the exception of five
studies (as reported above) that also assessed the impact of low fat
or low energy labels on high-fat foods (Crockett 2014; Ebneter
2013; Girz 2012 - study 1; Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink
2006 - study 3).
Settings
Eleven studies were in real-world settings (i.e. grocery stores,
restaurants, cafeterias, coffee shops or other contexts in which food
and drink for immediate consumption are sold) and where par-
ticipants ordered and paid for their food or drinks as they would
normally do in that setting (Allan 2015; Balasubramanian 2002;
Bergen 2006; Bollinger 2011; Chu 2009; Cioffi 2015; Dubbert
1984; Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a; Holmes2013; VanEpps 2016).
Seventeen studies took place in artificial settings or scenarios (i.e.
in contexts where participants would not normally order or con-
sume food or drinks, or they did not pay for food or drinks be-
cause these were provided by the researchers), broadly consid-
ered laboratory settings (Cavanagh 2014; Crockett 2014; Ebneter
2013; Girz 2012 - study 1; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing,
Hammond 2013; Harnack 2008a; James 2015; Kral 2002; Platkin
2014; Roberto 2010; Roberto 2012; Temple 2010; Vermeer 2011;
Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink 2006 - study 3).
Twelve studies took place in university laboratories or classrooms
(Cavanagh 2014; Ebneter 2013; Girz 2012 - study 1; Girz 2012
- study 2; Girz ongoing, Hammond 2013; James 2015; Kral
2002; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010; Roberto 2012; Temple 2010),
three took place in other university facilities, including an open-
house area (Wansink 2006 - study 1, campus grounds (Bergen
2006), a theatre (Wansink 2006 - study 3), and university-based
restaurants or dining centres (Chu 2009; Cioffi 2015; Ellison
2013; Ellison 2014a). One study took place in community-based
facilities (church halls and hotel conference rooms) for reasons of
convenience (Harnack 2008a). Other studies took place in a chain
of coffee shops (Bollinger 2011), a hospital coffee shop (Allan
2015), a community restaurant (Holmes 2013) and a community-
based cafeteria (Dubbert 1984). Balasubramanian 2002 was in a
major grocery store chain, and VanEpps 2016 in the workplace of
a large healthcare company. Although two studies took place in
cinemas, we considered these laboratory studies as the participants
did not pay for the food or drinks which were provided by the
researchers (Crockett 2014; Vermeer 2011).
Outcomes
Within each of the primary outcomes of interest, studies reported
the following measures.
Purchasing
There were 11 purchasing studies in real-world settings.
Bergen 2006 assessed the impact of labelling on drinks purchased
from vending machines by measuring the mean number of low-
energy soft drinks sold weekly over a nine-week period (two-
weekbaseline period,five-weekinterventionperiod,andtwo-week
postintervention period).
Balasubramanian 2002 assessed the impact of labelling on ’light’
entrées and juices purchased from a grocery store by measuring
sales transactions (i.e. the percentage of labelled products bought
relative to other products bought) each week over a seven-year
period.
Nine studies assessed the impact of labelling on food or drinks
purchased in restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops. Studies mea-
sured the outcome using the mean energy content of items pur-
chased at each meal over a period of time (2 weeks: Ellison 2013;
4 weeks: VanEpps 2016; 41 days: Chu 2009; 2 months: Holmes
2013; 19 weeks: Ellison 2014a), mean weekly energy sales of 45
labelled food items for 12 weeks (Cioffi 2015), the proportion of
high-calorie purchases over a six-week period (as a percentage of
total drinks or snacks sold) (Allan 2015); mean energy of food
and drinks bought per sales transaction over 14 months (Bollinger
2011), or the probability of purchasing low-energy items from
three different food categories (vegetables, salads, entrées) during
an 18-week period (Dubbert 1984).
Consumption
Seventeen studies assessed the impact of labelling on food or drink
consumed in artificial or laboratory settings. In 14 of these studies,
the outcome was mean energy consumed during a snack, a single

 meal, or across multiple meals (Crockett 2014; Ebneter 2013; Girz
2012 - study 1; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing; Hammond
2013; Harnack 2008a; James 2015; Kral 2002; Platkin 2014;
Roberto 2010; Temple 2010; Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink
2006 - study 3). Of the three remaining studies, two measured
mean grams of food consumed (Cavanagh 2014; Roberto 2012),
and one measured mean volume of a drink consumed (Vermeer
2011).
Further details of each study are reported in the table of
Characteristics of included studies.
Excluded studies
Of 50,270 records screened, we excluded 49,992 records in the
initial screening, and we assessed the full text of 263 papers plus
15 potentially relevant trial registry records (i.e. 278 records) for
inclusion (Figure 3). We excluded 246 for not meeting one or
more of our inclusion criteria:
• 113 studies had an ineligible design (i.e. they were not an
RCT, Q-RCT, controlled before-and-after study or an ITS study
meeting the EPOC criteria for inclusion (EPOC 2015));
• 83 studies used an intervention that did not include a
nutritional label meeting the inclusion criteria or used a multi-
component intervention from which the impact of the label
could not be isolated;
• 76 studies did not assess food purchasing or consumption
or used subjective (self-reported) measures. In all of these cases,
we were confident that the excluded studies had not measured
relevant outcomes.
In addition:
• 9 studies didn’t include a no label or incomplete label
control group, that is, they only compared different labelling
schemes;
• 2 studies were in participants who were not purchasing or
consuming food or drink for their personal consumption or for a
small group they belonged to; and
• 1 trial registration did not present enough information to
assess eligibility;
• 16 of the records were registries, conference abstracts or full
papers related to already excluded studies.
We report further details in the Characteristics of excluded studies.
As over two-hundred papers were assessed at the full paper stage,
we did not include all of these studies in the Characteristics of
excluded studies table if they had obvious reasons for exclusion,
such as if the study designs were clearly not eligible (e.g. cross-
sectional survey), if the intervention did not assess a nutritional
label (e.g. posters on benefits of eating fruit and vegetables), if the
studies did not have a no-label control group, or if studies did not
evaluate purchasing or consumption, or only evaluated intention
to purchase or consume a food or drink.

 Allocation
Of the 17 RCTs, only Crockett2014 reported an adequate method
of both sequence generation and allocation concealment. Seven
other RCTs reported an adequate method of sequence generation
(e.g. random number generator) but provided no information on
the method of allocation concealment (Girz 2012 - study 1; Girz
2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing; James 2015; Platkin 2014; Roberto
2010; Roberto 2012). Seven RCTs reported no information for
either criterion (Bergen 2006; Cavanagh 2014; Ebneter 2013;
Hammond 2013; Harnack 2008a; Temple 2010; VanEpps 2016).
Ellison 2013 and Ellison 2014a reported only that diners were
randomly assigned to a table in one of three sections in a restaurant
with different intervention or control menus, but authors reported
neither the method used to generate the random sequence nor
the method of allocation concealment. Ellison 2014a noted that
one section of the restaurant with a designated intervention had
booth seating, which some parties requested to have, so not all
participants were likely randomised. We thus considered this study
to be at high risk of bias on this criterion.
In four Q-RCTs, participants were allocated to intervention or
control groups on different days (Kral 2002; Vermeer 2011;
Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink 2006 - study 3), and in one Q-
RCT, participants were allocated to intervention or control groups
on different weeks (Allan 2015).
Blinding
Of the 17 RCTs and 5 Q-RCTs, 14 studies appropriately blinded
the study participants by concealing the purpose of the study
and their treatment group, thus mitigating one source of per-
formance bias (Cavanagh 2014; Crockett 2014; Ebneter 2013;
Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a; Hammond 2013; Harnack 2008a;
James 2015; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010; Roberto 2012; Temple
2010; Vermeer 2011; Wansink 2006 - study 3). We assessed blind-
ing to be inadequate in four studies, as some study participants
guessed the study purpose or may have been aware of the other
treatment group (Allan 2015; Bergen 2006; Kral 2002; Wansink
2006 - study 1). Blinding was unclear in another four RCTs (Girz
2012 - study 1; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing; VanEpps 2016).
Most studies did not explicitly state whether study personnel were
blinded to the participants’ treatment group, but given the nature
of the interventions, blinding is unlikely. In addition, the included
studies often did not report blinding the outcome assessor; how-
ever, when the outcome variable was objectively assessed (e.g. de-
rived from electronic data, or by weighing food), the lack of blind-
ing may not have resulted in detection bias (Allan 2015; Bergen
2006; Cavanagh 2014; Crockett 2014; Ebneter 2013; Ellison
2013; Ellison 2014a; Hammond 2013; Harnack 2008a; James
2015; Kral 2002; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010; Roberto 2012;
Temple 2010; Vermeer 2011; Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink
2006 - study 3; VanEpps 2016). The three remaining studies re-
ported no information on blinding or the method of outcome as-
sessment (Girz 2012 - study 1; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing).
All six ITS studies objectively measured the outcomes (e.g. elec-
tronic data or till receipts), so a lack of blinding of the outcome
assessment may not have resulted in detection bias.
Incomplete outcome data
Most of the RCTs, Q-RCTs and ITS studies evaluated groups of
participants within defined observation periods (sometimes with
very short time periods, particularly in laboratory experiments).
This may explain why there was little evidence of attrition bias.
The exceptions to this were three RCTs and two ITS studies. Two
of the RCTs did not report the number of participants randomised
at the beginning of the study, only the number of observations
made (Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a). In Ebneter 2013, the overall
attrition rate was 22%, with no information on attrition by group.
Thus, we considered Ellison 2013 and Ellison 2014a to be at
unclear risk of bias and Ebneter 2013 to be at high risk of bias. One
ITS study was also at unclear risk bias due to a lack of reporting
(Balasubramanian 2002), and another ITS study was at high risk
of bias due to a high attrition rate (Cioffi 2015).
Selective reporting
We judged most studies to be at low risk of bias with regard to
selective reporting given that they fully reported all of the out-
comes specified in the Methods section of the papers. Although
the availability of a study protocol would have allowed for a more
reliable estimate of this, our searches identified only two protocols
from the 17 RCTs (Crockett 2014; Hammond 2013). In addition,
most of the RCTs and Q-RCTs reported complete data that could
be used to calculate effect sizes. Selective reporting was not clear
in one RCT, Girz ongoing, or in one ITS study, Balasubramanian
2002. The ITS study by Cioffi 2015 was at high risk of bias be-
cause authors excluded outcome data for some target food items
from the analysis.
Other potential sources of bias
Biases specific to interrupted time series studies
Two of the ITS studies reported that the intervention was indepen-
dent of confounding variables during the study period (Bollinger
2011; Chu 2009), and another two provided no information
(Dubbert 1984; Holmes 2013). In Cioffi 2015, the authors noted
21

Cochrane Collaboration.
 that “with data observed over many weeks and at various locations,
it was impossible to control for all external factors or events that
might have occurred over the entire length of the study”, and in
Balasubramanian 2002, the authors noted that “our models do
not incorporate explanatory variables such as price or other type
of deals”, suggesting that other changes could have occurred dur-
ing the study period. We considered that the lack of control for
potential confounders introduced a high risk of bias.
Other potential threats to validity
In the cluster-RCT, there were significant baseline differences be-
tween the randomised clusters, so we considered this study to be
at high risk of bias (Bergen 2006). In one ITS study, it was un-
clear how investigators selected the participating grocery stores,
raising the possibility of selection bias (Balasubramanian 2002). In
three studies, data collection occurred during short time periods
or during restricted hours of the day (Dubbert 1984; Ellison 2013;
Vermeer 2011), so the outcomes may not have been representa-
tive of purchasing or consumption. Moreover, in Balasubramanian
2002, the introduction of the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act may have drawn additional attention to signposting through-
out the city where the study took place, not just in the stores in
question, thus possibly introducing a co-intervention. We con-
sidered these studies to be at high risk of bias for this additional
criterion.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Summary
of findings table
Purchasing studies
Purchasing from vending machines
One cluster-RCT compared sales of drinks in vending machines
with and without labels in a university setting (Bergen 2006). The
results showed that participants purchased more diet soda from
the labelled vending machines (mean 54.4 beverages, SD 16.7)
compared to the non-labelled machines (mean 48.9 beverages,
SD 1.8) (Table 1). However, given the small number of vending
machines randomised (N = 3), and the large baseline differences
in sales between the vending machines, we cannot clearly interpret
the study results or calculate an accurate effect size.
Using GRADE criteria, we downgraded the evidence by two levels
for very serious risk of bias and by one level for a high degree of
imprecision. Thus, we considered the quality of the evidence for
labelling on drinks purchased from vending machines to be very
low, meaning that we have very little confidence in it.
Purchasing from a grocery store
One ITS study with unclear sample sizes assessed the impact of
verbal descriptor labels for single nutrients, such as ’low calorie’ or
’light’ on food purchasing from a grocery store (Balasubramanian
2002). Regression analysis demonstrated that the sales perfor-
mance of calorie-healthy foods (e.g. low-calorie bottled juices and
’light’ frozen entrées and dinners) decreased after the implementa-
tion of mandatory labelling (Table 2). The results of this longitudi-
nal time series analysis were, however, difficult to interpret because
the authors evaluated a percentage of labelled products bought rel-
ative to other products, rather than evaluating time trends of the
number of products purchased before and after the introduction
of labelling.
Using GRADE criteria, we downgraded the evidence for this ob-
servational study by one level for serious risk of bias and one level
for indirectness, because the study measured the outcome indi-
rectly, as a proportion of overall purchasing rather than as a di-
rect quantity. Thus, we considered the quality of the evidence for
labelling on drinks purchased from grocery stores to be very low,
meaning that we have very little confidence in it.
Purchasing from a restaurant, cafeteria or coffee shop
Nine studies assessed the impact of nutritional labels on menus or
menuboards,ornutritional labelsplacedon, oradjacentto, arange
of food or drink options in restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops
(Allan 2015; Bollinger 2011; Chu 2009; Cioffi 2015; Dubbert
1984; Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a; Holmes2013; VanEpps 2016).
Three of these studies were RCTs (Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a;
VanEpps 2016), one was a Q-RCT (Allan 2015), and five used
ITS analyses (Bollinger 2011; Chu 2009; Cioffi 2015; Dubbert
1984; Holmes 2013). Only three RCTs presented data suitable
for calculating effect sizes (Ellison 2013; Ellison 2014a; VanEpps
2016). We present brief descriptions of all nine studies below and
in Table 3.
Of the three RCTs, two took place in the same restaurant under
the supervision of the same research team (Ellison 2013; Ellison
2014a). In both studies, groups of customers were randomised to
three different menus: a menu labelled with energy information, a
menu with energy information in a traffic light format, or a menu
with no energy information. In the first study, investigators col-
lected data for two weeks, and in the second study, for 19 weeks.
In the third RCT, conducted over a four-week period, company
employees chose lunch items from an online menu from a corpo-
rate restaurant with or without energy information, and alone or
with a traffic light format (VanEpps 2016). For each of these three
RCTs, we combined two of the treatment arms: energy labelling
alone, and energy labelling plus a traffic light format. We could
then calculate effect sizes for menu labelling versus no-label com-
parisons. A meta-analysis of these three RCTs from restaurants
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 47 kcal in en-
ergy purchased when menus were labelled (MD −46.72 kcal, 95%

 CI −78.35 to −15.10, P = 0.004, N = 1877; Analysis 1.1; Figure
5) with little evidence of heterogeneity (Chi² = 0.84, P = 0.66, I²
= 0%). Assuming an average meal intake of 600 kcal, the size of
this effect suggests that energy labelling on menus would reduce
energy purchased per meal by 7.8% (95% CI 2.5% to 13.1%).
Figure 5.
Forest plot of comparison: Labelling on menus vs no labelling in restaurants, and energy (kcal) of
food purchased
We considered two RCTs to be at unclear risk of bias because there
was insufficient information available on study methods to make
an assessment (Ellison 2013; VanEpps 2016), and we assessed one
RCT as being at very high risk of bias (Ellison 2014a). We thus
downgraded the evidence two levels for very serious risk of bias.
We rated the quality of the evidence for these three studies to be
low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited, and the
estimate may change with further studies.
Of the remaining six studies, one Q-RCT assessed point-of-pur-
chase signs that provided energy information on all snacks and
drinks available at a hospital coffee shop (Allan 2015).The signs
were randomly presented or not presented for six weeks each. The
authors reported that the proportion of high-calorie snacks pur-
chased (of the total purchases) was significantly lower in the inter-
vention group compared to the control group (41% versus 45%,
P = 0.04), but there was no significant difference in the propor-
tion of high-energy drinks purchased between the intervention
and control (46% versus 50%, P = 0.15). While the total number
of items purchased over the 12 weeks was 20,516, the study did
not provide sample sizes for intervention and control snacks or
drinks.
Of the five ITS studies, one evaluated changes before and after
mandatory energy food labelling on menus and menu boards in
New York City (Bollinger 2011). Using regression analysis, the
authors reported an average decrease after labelling in energy pur-
chased from food of 14.4 calories per transaction (P = 0.001) at a
coffee shop chain, with a negligible impact on energy from drinks
per transaction.
Three ITS studies took place in cafeterias (Chu 2009; Cioffi 2015;
Dubbert 1984), but only one statistically compared time trends
before and after the implementation of labelling (Chu 2009). This
study found that introducing a menu board that adhered to the
same format as the FDA nutritional facts label reduced the aver-
age energy content of entrées selected by participants immediately
after the intervention, and that the energy content of the entrées
selected gradually increased after removing the nutrition informa-
tion (total entrées sold/evaluated = 42,170) (Chu 2009). Cioffi
2015 also reported the effects of a nutrition facts label placed di-
rectly on pre-packaged meals and snacks. The mean energy pur-
chased was higher pre-intervention than during the intervention,
but authors did not report a statistical comparison of time trends
before and after the intervention. Dubbert 1984 found that a
’lower calorie selection’ label placed near appropriate food items
significantly increased the probability of purchasing lower energy
vegetables and salads compared to higher energy vegetables and
salads (P < 0.001 for both) over baseline conditions. The proba-
bility of purchasing a low-energy entrée did not differ from base-
line. A further ITS study assessed the impact of energy and fat in-
formation presented on children’s menus and reported that, com-
pared with no nutritional labelling, total energy purchased after
two months was unchanged (Holmes 2013). However, authors
did not report a statistical comparison of time trends before and
after the intervention.
We considered two ITS studies to be at low risk of bias (Bollinger
2011; Chu 2009), while one was at unclear risk (Holmes 2013),
and two were at high risk (Cioffi 2015; Dubbert 1984). One Q-
RCT was also at high risk of bias (Allan 2015) Both ITS studies
considered to be at low risk of bias supported the findings of the
meta-analysis reported above.
Consumption studies

Cochrane Collaboration.
 Consumption in laboratory settings
Seventeen studies assessed the impact on consumption of nutri-
tional labels on one or more food items in artificial or labora-
tory settings (Cavanagh 2014; Crockett 2014; Ebneter 2013; Girz
2012 - study 1; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing, Hammond
2013; Harnack 2008a; James 2015; Kral 2002; Platkin 2014;
Roberto 2010; Roberto 2012; Temple 2010; Vermeer 2011;
Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink 2006 - study 3. Eight assessed
labelling on menus or on a range of food options, such as at a
buffet meal (Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing, Hammond 2013;
Harnack 2008a; James2015; Platkin2014; Roberto 2010; Temple
2010) (see Table 4). Six studies assessed the impact of a nutritional
label on a snack, drink or meal without providing participants with
other options to choose from (Cavanagh 2014; Crockett 2014;
Ebneter2013; Kral 2002; Roberto 2012; Vermeer2011)(see Table
4). An additional three studies intentionally mislabelled products
to detect effects on behaviour, by measuring energy intake of high-
fat snack foods labelled as low fat or low energy (Girz 2012 - study
1; Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink 2006 - study 3). We consider
these latter three in the section below on potential harms associ-
ated with labelling (see also Table 5).
Energy consumed during a meal with a range of available
food options
A meta-analysis of eight RCTs did not conclusively demonstrate
a reduction in energy consumed when menus (7 studies) or a
range of foods (1 study) were labelled (MD −50.27 kcal, 95%
CI −104.41to 3.88, P = 0.07, N = 1705; Analysis 2.1; Figure 6;
Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing, Hammond 2013; Harnack
2008a; James 2015; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010; Temple 2010),
and there was moderate heterogeneity between the studies (Chi²
= 13.06, P = 0.07, I² = 46%). The pooled result shows a positive
effect for labelling, although the 95% confidence interval crosses
the line of no effect. Assuming an average meal intake of 600
kcal, the size of this effect suggests that energy labelling of menus
or food would reduce consumption per meal by 8.4% (95% CI
−0.7% to 17.4%).
Figure 6. Forest plot of comparison: Labelling on menus or placed on a range of food options vs. no labelling
in laboratory settings, and energy (kcal) consumed
A pre-planned sensitivity analysis, including the three studies
judged to be at low risk of bias (James 2015; Platkin 2014; Roberto
2010), resulted in an increased effect size (MD −72.04 kcal, 95%
CI −137.84 to −6.25, P = 0.03, N = 547; Analysis 3.1) with
little evidence of heterogeneity (Chi² = 1.73, P = 0.42, I² = 0%).
This equated to a per meal reduction of 12.0% (95% CI 1.0% to
23.0%), again assuming an average meal intake of 600 kcal.
Of the eight RCTs that evaluated this outcome, we considered
three to be at low risk of bias (James 2015; Platkin 2014; Roberto
2010), while five were at unclear risk due to there being insufficient
information on study methods to make an assessment (Girz 2012 -
study 2; Girz ongoing; Hammond 2013; Harnack 2008a; Temple
2010).
Using GRADE criteria, we downgraded the evidence one level for
imprecision (as the 95% confidence interval included the possi-
bility of no effect and of a meaningful decrease) and one level for
indirectness (as behaviour observed in a laboratory setting may not
be applicable to real-world settings). Although five of the included
studies were at unclear risk of bias, we did not downgrade for risk
of bias. Thus, we considered quality of the evidence for the impact
of labelling on menus or multiple foods on energy consumption
to be low, meaning that our confidence in the effect estimate is
limited, and the estimate may change with further studies.
Energy consumed during a snack or meal with a single food
or drink option
Four RCTs (Cavanagh 2014; Crockett 2014; Ebneter 2013;
Roberto 2012), plus two Q-RCTs (Kral 2002; Vermeer 2011), as-
24

 sessed the impact of labelling on energy (kcal) consumption when
participants were offered a single food option: cookies, high-sugar
breakfast cereal, chocolate, popcorn, an entrée, or soft drinks. In
these studies, the nutritional label was placed on the container or
packaging, adjacent to the food, or presented on a display board.
A meta-analysis of these six studies did not demonstrate a statisti-
cally significant reduction in energy consumed with labelling, but
the confidence intervals were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the
true effect size (SMD 0.05, 95% CI −0.17 to 0.27, P = 0.67, N =
732; Analysis 4.1), and the effect size was small (see Cohen 1988).
Heterogeneity between the studies was moderate, principally due
to Cavanagh 2014, which differed in using low-energy (as opposed
to high-energy) snack foods (Chi² = 10.28, P = 0.07, I² = 51%).
Within this analysis there is a probable lack of consistency in the
distributions of values associated with measures of meal compared
to snack consumption, which is a potential limitation, affecting
the extent to which the SD units can be equated across the studies;
however, we are confident that alternative analysis options would
not affect our overall conclusions. The results were similar in a
sensitivity analysis that included only the two studies we judged
to be at low risk of bias (SMD −0.06, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.15, P =
0.57, N = 400; Analysis 5.1; Crockett 2014; Roberto 2012), with
little evidence of heterogeneity (Chi² = 0.98, P = 0.32, I² = 0%).
Of the four RCTs and two Q-RCTs that evaluated this outcome,
we considered two RCTs to be at low risk of bias (Crockett 2014;
Roberto 2012), one RCT to be at unclear risk of bias (given insuf-
ficient information reported to enable an assessment) (Cavanagh
2014), and one RCT and the two Q-RCTs to be at high risk of
bias (Ebneter 2013; Kral 2002; Vermeer 2011).
Using GRADE criteria, we downgraded the evidence one level
for serious risk of bias and one level for indirectness, as behaviour
observed in a laboratory setting may not be applicable to real-
world settings. Although the confidence intervals were wide, this
did not affect the overall rating. Thus, we considered the quality
of the evidence for the impact of labelling of a single food or
drink option on energy consumption to be low, meaning that our
confidence in the effect estimate is limited, and that the estimate
may change with further studies.
Subgroup analyses
We conducted pre-planned subgroup analyses by dietary restraint
and by study country. We performed separate analyses for studies
that provided a range of food options and for studies that provided
single food options. No analyses demonstrated statistically signif-
icant differences, but the confidence intervals were wide, suggest-
ing uncertainty in the true effect size.
For studies providing multiple food options, the pooled effect
size for restrained eaters was MD 20.87 kcal (95% CI −37.44 to
79.18, P = 0.48, N = 129; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing), and
for unrestrained eaters the MD was 10.98 kcal (95% CI −38.85
to 60.81, P = 0.67, N = 138; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing),
with the test for subgroup differences showing no significant effect
(Chi² = 0.06, df = 1, P = 0.80, I² = 0%); see Analysis 6.1.
Of the studies that provided single food options, only one study
reported data for restrained and unrestrained eaters, presenting
the results as standardised mean energy consumption. The effect
size for restrained eaters was SMD −0.44 (95% CI −0.94 to
0.05) (sample size not reported), and for unrestrained eaters it was
SMD 0.03 (95% CI −0.34 to 0.39) (sample size not reported)
(Crockett 2014), with the test for subgroup differences showing
no significant effect (Chi² = 2.24, df = 1, P = 0.13, I² = 55%); see
Analysis 7.1.
For studies providing multiple food options, the pooled effect size
for US studies was MD −70.57 kcal (95% CI −167.65 to 26.52,
P = 0.15, N = 895; Harnack 2008a; James 2015; Platkin 2014;
Roberto 2010; Temple2010). The effect size for studies conducted
in other countries was MD −58.18 kcal (95% CI −107.15 to
−9.21; Girz 2012 - study 2; Girz ongoing; Hammond 2013),
with the test for subgroup differences showing no significant effect
(Chi² = 0.05, df = 1, P = 0.82, I² = 0%); see Analysis 8.1.
For studies providing a single food option, the pooled effect size
for US studies was SMD 0.14 (95% CI −0.17 to 0.45, P = 0.37,
N = 459; Cavanagh 2014; Ebneter 2013; Kral 2002; Roberto
2012), and for studies conducted in other countries the SMD was
−0.12 (95% CI −0.36 to 0.11, P = 0.31, N = 273; Crockett 2014;
Vermeer 2011), with the test for subgroup differences showing no
significant effect (Chi² = 1.75, df = 1, P = 0.19, I² = 43%); see
Analysis 9.1.
Potential harms associated with labelling
Based on the analyses described above, there is no evidence that
nutritional labelling has the unintended harm of increasing energy
purchased or consumed.
Indirect evidence concerning potential harm comes from five stud-
ies that involve mislabelling content for a single nutrient (Crockett
2014; Ebneter 2013; Girz 2012 - study 1; Wansink 2006 - study
1; Wansink 2006 - study 3). Two Q-RCTs examined the impact of
low fat labels on energy consumption of high-energy snack foods
(chocolate and granola) (Wansink 2006 - study 1; Wansink 2006
- study 3), and one RCT evaluated the impact of low energy la-
bels on energy consumption of high-fat foods (a pasta dish and an
energy dense salad) (Girz 2012 - study 1). In addition, two RCTs
evaluated treatment arms in which high-fat snack foods carried
a low fat label (Crockett 2014; Ebneter 2013). In one of these
studies a treatment group received toffee and salted popcorn with
a green low fat label (Crockett 2014), and in the other study, a
treatment group received a chocolate confectionery coated with
hard candy shell (M&M’s) labelled as ’low fat’ (without any other
energy information) (Ebneter 2013). A meta-analysis of these five
studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase in
energy (kcal) consumed with mislabelling, but the confidence in-
tervalsare wide,suggestinguncertaintyinthe true effectsize (SMD

 0.19, 95% CI −0.14 to 0.51, P = 0.25, N = 718), and the effect
size was small (see Cohen 1988). There was also a high degree of
heterogeneity between the studies (Chi² =17.44, P = 0.002, I² =
77%); see Analysis 10.1.
Only one of the five studies was at low risk of bias (Crockett 2014),
while one was at unclear risk (Girz 2012 - study 1), and the other
three were at high risk of bias (Ebneter 2013; Wansink 2006 -
study 1; Wansink 2006 - study 3).
Using GRADE criteria, we downgraded the evidence one level for
serious risk of bias, one level for heterogeneity, and one level for
indirectness, as behaviour observed in a laboratory setting may not
be applicable to real-world settings. In addition, the 95% confi-
dence interval included the possibility of a meaningful decrease or
increase; however, the quality score was already very low, and we
could not reduce it further to recognise this imprecision. Thus, we
judged the quality of the evidence for studies of mislabelling on
energy consumption to be very low, meaning we have very little
confidence in the results presented, and the true effect is likely to
be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

Summary of main results
Purchasing food or drinks in real-world settings
(vending machines, grocery stores, restaurants,
cafeterias or coffee shops)
Eleven studies, comprising five RCTs and six interrupted time
series (ITS) studies, assessed the impact of nutritional labels on
menus or menu boards, or nutritional labels placed on, or adjacent
to, a range of food or drink options, on purchasing in real-world
settings. One cluster-RCT assessed purchasing from vending ma-
chines; one ITS study, from grocery stores; and three RCTs, one
Q-RCT and five ITS, from restaurants and cafeterias. We could
not interpret study results on vending machines and grocery stores
and considered the evidence to be of very low quality. A meta-
analysis of the three RCTs, all of which assessed energy labelling in
restaurants, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of 47
kcal in energy purchased when menus were labelled. Assuming an
average meal of 600 kcal, this represents a 7.8% reduction (95%
CI 2.5% to 13.1%) in energy purchasing. Applying the GRADE
system, we considered the quality of the evidence for these three
studies as low, so our confidence in the effect estimate is limited
and may change with further studies. Of the remaining six studies,
we considered only two (both ITS studies involving energy labels
on menus or menu boards) to be at low risk of bias, and their
results support the meta-analysis. The other four studies which
were conducted in a restaurant, cafeterias (2 studies) or a coffee
shop, did not clearly report their results, so we considered them
to be at high risk of bias.
Consumption of food or drinks in laboratory settings
Seventeen studies, comprising 13 RCTs and 4 Q-RCTs, assessed
the impact of nutritional labelling on consumption of food or
drink in an artificial settings or scenarios (referred to as laboratory
settings in this review).
Of these, eight RCTs assessed the effect of labels on menus, or
labels placed on a range of food options, on energy consumed dur-
ing a meal. A meta-analysis of these eight studies did not conclu-
sivelydemonstrate areductioninenergyconsumedwhenmenusor
foods were labelled, but the results favoured nutritional labelling.
Assuming an average meal intake of 600 kcal, the size of this effect
suggests that energy labelling of menus or food would reduce con-
sumption per meal by about 8.4% (95% CI −0.7% to 17.4%).
Applying the GRADE system, we considered the quality of the
evidence for this group of studies to be low, meaning that our con-
fidence in the effect estimate is limited and that the estimate may
change with further studies. In a pre-planned sensitivity analysis
including only the three studies at low risk of bias, we found a
statistically significant reduction of 72 kcal in energy consumed,
equating to a reduction of 12.0% per meal (95% CI 1% to 23%).
Further studies at low risk of bias are needed to increase confidence
in this effect size.
Six laboratory studies (four RCTs and two Q-RCTs) assessed
the impact of labelling a single food or drink option (cookies,
high-sugar breakfast cereal, chocolate, popcorn, an entrée, or soft
drinks) on energy consumed during a snack or meal. A meta-analy-
sis of these six studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant
difference in energy (kcal) consumed with labelling, and in any
case the effect size was small (Cohen 1988). However, the confi-
dence intervals were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect
size. Applying the GRADE system, we considered the quality of
the evidence for this group of studies to be low, so our confidence
in the effect estimate is limited and may change with further stud-
ies. The results were similar in a sensitivity analysis that included
only two studies at low risk of bias.
Subgroup analysis exploring possible moderating effects (re-
strained eaters and unrestrained eaters; studies conducted in the
USA and studies conducted in other countries) did not show a
difference in impact of nutritional labelling. However, these anal-
yses were likely underpowered due to the small number of studies
in each subgroup.
Potential harms associated with labelling
Based on the analyses described above, there was no evidence that
nutritional labelling had the unintended harm of increasing energy
purchased or consumed. Indirect evidence concerning potential
harm came from five laboratory studies that involved mislabelling

Cochrane Collaboration.
 content for a single nutrient (i.e. placing low energy or low fat
labels on high-energy foods) during a snack or meal. A meta-
analysis of these five studies did not demonstrate a statistically
significant increase in energy (kcal) consumed, and the effect size
was small (Cohen 1988). However, the confidence intervals were
wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We considered
the quality of the evidence from these studies to be very low,
providing very little confidence in the effect estimate.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
We used an extensive search strategy involving a comprehensive
range of databases and other sources and, whilst possible, it is un-
likely that we missed relevant references. In addition, we included
only studies with objectively assessed outcomes, thus increasing
the applicability of the evidence to actual behaviour. However, the
applicability of the evidence was limited by several study charac-
teristics. Most (21/28) studies took place in the USA and none
were in low- or middle-income countries. Furthermore, many of
the studies took place in university settings (19/28), and 17 took
place in artificial or laboratory settings. While the review results
are necessarily limited to the foods and drinks evaluated in the in-
cluded studies, these encompassed a range of foods including fast
food and other meals, soft drinks and snacks. The extent to which
the results of this review are applicable beyond North American
university settings or laboratory settings is uncertain. For one of
the meta-analyses (Analysis 4.1), we acknowledge that the prob-
able lack of consistency in the distributions of values associated
with the different outcome measures is a potential limitation, con-
straining the extent to which the SD units are comparable across
the studies.
One of the strengths of this review is that we included all types of
nutritional labels. This review, however, did not set out to compare
labels in terms of content or format. Thus, the results apply to
nutritional labelling in general.
Quality of the evidence
We assessed the quality of the evidence included in this review as
low or very low using GRADE criteria. These low ratings were
largely due to the large number of studies with a high risk of
bias, imprecision in the pooled effect estimates, and unknown
applicability of laboratory studies to real-world settings.
Potential biases in the review process
At least two independent reviewers were involved in the selection
of studies and in the data extraction and quality assessment pro-
cesses, thus reducing the potential for reviewer error and bias. We
sought published and unpublished studies in any language, thus
reducing the potential for language and publication biases. It is
possible that we failed to identify all relevant research for inclusion
in the review, although we took steps to reduce this possibility by
citation searching and contacting researchers in the field regarding
eligible studies. We also made a number of changes to the review
after writing the protocol, although we provided a rationale for
these changes in Differences between protocol and review. In ad-
dition, we could have re-analysed the graphs in some of the inter-
rupted time series studies using segmented time series regression
techniques, although in most cases data presented in the graphs
were inadequate to enable this. However, even when adequate data
were available, we did not do this because we considered most
studies to be at high risk of bias.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
We identified 12 systematic reviews that concern nutritional
labelling (Bleich 2017; Campos 2011; Cantu-Jungles 2017;
Cecchini 2016; Cowburn 2005; Grech 2015; Grunert 2007;
Harnack 2008b; Mhurchu 2007; Shemilt 2017; Sinclair 2014;
Swartz 2011), nine of which assessed at least one type of be-
havioural outcome (i.e. purchasing or consumption). Of the three
reviews that did not report behavioural outcomes, two evaluated
outcomes such as consumer knowledge and understanding of nu-
tritional labelling (Campos 2011; Cowburn 2005). The third re-
view aimed to assess behavioural outcomes, but it included no
studies that evaluated these types of outcomes (Mhurchu 2007).
Despite differences in assessed outcomes between these latter three
reviews and our review, all three studies found evidence to sup-
port nutritional labelling that is understandable and accessible as
a means to promote healthier food choices in different consumer
groups such as children, adolescents or older people (Campos
2011).
Of the nine reviews that assessed at least one type of behavioural
outcome (Bleich 2017; Cantu-Jungles 2017; Cecchini 2016;
Grech 2015; Grunert 2007; Harnack 2008b; Shemilt 2017;
Sinclair 2014; Swartz 2011), none had the same inclusion criteria
as our review in terms of the interventions, study design or out-
comes evaluated here, making comparisons between these and the
current review difficult. There were also major differences between
some of these reviews and ours in terms of data comparison and
analysis. Unlike previous reviews, ours differentiated the impacts
of nutritional labels used in different physical contexts, including
vending machines, grocery stores, and cafeterias, restaurants or
coffee shops. We also considered the impacts on purchasing and
the impacts on consumption separately. These previous reviews
assessed a range of outcomes (including ’choice’, ’selection’, ’foods
ordered’ or ’intentions’) and several contexts (including real-world
settings, laboratory settings or in response to hypothetical scenar-
ios).

Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink purchasing and consumption (Review)
Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. on behalf of The
Cochrane Collaboration.
 The five systematic reviews we judged most similar to ours were
Bleich 2017; Cantu-Jungles 2017; Swartz2011, Sinclair2014, and
Cecchini 2016. Swartz 2011 assessed the impact of energy labels
on menus in restaurants but included only non-RCTs. Based on
a narrative synthesis of seven studies, the authors concluded that
energy labelling on menus did not decrease energy purchasing or
consumption. Three of the studies included in that review also met
the inclusion criteria for our review. We judged them as having
poor quality, and they did not present data that we could clearly
interpret or use to estimate effect sizes.
Bleich 2017 assessed the effectiveness of menu labelling on calories
offered, ordered, purchased, or consumed in restaurant, cafeteria,
and laboratory settings. The authors concluded that the impact
of menu labelling on encouraging lower calorie purchases remains
unclear. This systematic review substantially differed from our
review in that it included a number of types of study designs that
did not meet our eligibility criteria, and it did not include a meta-
analysis or quality assessment of the included studies.
Similarly, Cantu-Jungles 2017 examined the effect of restaurant
menu labelling on calories and nutrients chosen by adults in
restaurants or simulated settings. Their meta-analysis of 14 stud-
ies showed no effect of menu labelling on calories chosen, either
ordered or consumed (MD −0.21 calories (95% CI: −1.36 to
0.94). The authors did, however, report a significant difference of
−115.2 calories when the meta-analysis was restricted to studies
conducted in laboratory settings. As above, this systematic review
substantially differed from our review despite the authors using
a modified version of our review protocol (Crockett 2011). For
example, before-and-after controlled studies were included in the
Cantu-Jungles 2017 review which we also assessed, but that we
found did not meet EPOC requirements for implementation in at
least two intervention and two control sites. Moreover, this review
did not report a full quality assessment of the individual studies or
summarise the quality of evidence using the GRADE system. In
addition, purchasing and consumption outcomes were not treated
separately, as in the current review, as we considered them, a priori,
to be different outcomes.
Sinclair 2014 also assessed the impact of nutritional labelling on
menus. A meta-analysis of six studies (with 24 comparisons) re-
sulted in a significant reduction in energy consumed (MD −41
kcal (95% CI −79 to −3) compared to no intervention. These
results were consistent with the effects we found in our review.
Our analysis of consumption also included five out of six of the
studies included in Sinclair 2014 (of the total eight studies in our
meta-analysis); the sixth study failed to meet our inclusion criteria.
Similar to our review, Cecchini 2016 aimed to assess the effective-
ness of food labelling for increasing the selection of healthier prod-
ucts and reducing energy intake. Unlike our review, the authors
included a heterogeneous range of labels, including logos such as
the healthy choice tick, serving size labels, as well as labels with
nutrient information (guideline daily amounts, or GDA), and a
mix of outcomes including purchasing intentions, an outcome we
excluded from our review due to validity concerns. Moreover, the
authors excluded studies that evaluated menu labelling. Cecchini
2016 reported a significant increase in the number of people mak-
ing a healthier choice and a non-significant decrease in calorie in-
take. Differences in our review methods have allowed us to form
stronger conclusions. For example, our search strategy retrieved
seven more RCTs, despite having narrower inclusion criteria.

Implications for practice
The results from a small body of low quality evidence suggest that
nutritional labelling comprising energy information on menus
may reduce energy purchased in restaurants. The evidence assess-
ing the impact on consumption of energy information on menus
or placed on a range of food options in laboratory settings suggests
a similar effect to that observed for purchasing, although the evi-
dence is less definite and also of low quality. Considered alongside
other reviews, we tentatively suggest that nutritional labelling on
menus in restaurants could be used as part of a broader range of
interventions to increase the impact of efforts to support healthier
food consumption across populations.
Implications for research
The evidence available for this review was limited in quality and
quantity. Further high-quality studies are needed to address the
dearth of evidence from grocery stores and vending machines and
to assess the impact of nutritional labels varying in content and
format on purchasing and consumption. In addition, further re-
search is needed to test the effects of single versus multiple labelled
food options to assess associations between labelling, food options
and behaviour.
High quality studies are also needed on the effectiveness of nutri-
tional labelling alongside other interventions to promote healthy
diets. This might include price interventions (e.g. Ellison 2014a;
Harnack 2008a), availability of more healthy options (Grech
2015; Hollands 2017a), reductions in portion size (Hollands
2015; Marteau 2015), and product reformulation (Public Health
England 2015). The evidence base would also be improved by the
use of high-quality randomised controlled trials with evaluations
of long-term effects and clear reporting of methods, including
those relating to risk of bias.
There was a notable absence of evidence assessing potential mod-
erators of the effect of nutritional labelling on behaviour. In par-
ticular, any meaningful examination of the potential moderating
role of socioeconomic status, will require, at minimum, studies
to report these details at the study level, and preferably to stratify
results by socioeconomic status subgroups. A further notable ab-
sence in the evidence base was assessment of nutritional labelling

 in low- and middle-income countries. Given that energy-dense
diets are becoming cheaper and more accessible in these coun-
tries, with corresponding rising rates of obesity (Brownell 2006;
Ng 2014; Yach 2006), an evaluation of the effectiveness of nutri-
tional labelling and other interventions to promote healthier food
purchasing and consumption is warranted.
Future research would benefit from a more diverse logic model that
takes account of possible wider impacts of nutritional labelling.
These include impactsuponthose producingandsellingfood,who
may decide to reformulate or adjust the choice of items available,
as well as the impact of labelling on consumer behaviour when
applied in combination with other interventions.

Allan 2015
Methods
Setting: one public coffee shop on a large academic hospital site, UK
Design: quasi-randomised controlled trial
Recruitment: all coffee shop customers during the study period were participants
Allocation to group: sign display (or absence thereof) was allocated by week using sealed
envelopes
Participants
General customers (primarily healthcare workers and university staff)
Interventions
Intervention: point-of-purchase signs indicating the energy content of every drink and
snack (6 weeks)
Control: no point-of-purchase signs (6 weeks)
Outcomes
Sales of high energy snacks and drinks (presented as a proportion)
Notes
The intervention signs were displayed for 6 randomly allocated weeks over a 12-week
period. The final allocation sequence was: C-C-I-C-I-I-C-C-I-C-I-I. The number of
items purchased during the study period was 20,516. This study was funded by the
Scottish Government’s Chief Scientist’s Office
Risk of bias

Methods
Setting: major grocery store chain in a large city, USA
Design: interrupted time series
Recruitment: existing sales data
Allocation to intervention: naturally occurring pre- and post-Nutrition Labelling Edu-
cation Act (NLEA, 1990) legislation
Participants
General customers
Interventions
Pre NLEA labelling: no enforced labelling (sample size not reported)
NLEA* labelling: ’Nutrition Facts’ panel on side or back of product with descriptors on
front of pack (sample size not reported)
*The NLEA regulations allowed a choice of several descriptions for a given nutrient such
as ’low fat’, ’reduced fat’, ’light’
Overall, 2684 item sales analysed
Outcomes
Sales performance of different categories of food with various types of labels (obtained
from electronic sales data)
Notes
This study was conducted from 14 September 1989 to 14 May 1997, with data collected
on a weekly basis. “Sales transactions were aggregated across stores to derive the weekly
category share for the healthy [products] associated with a given nutrient”, and then
the authors conducted a regression analysis. Data on ’low-calorie’ bottled juices, ’light’
frozen entrées, and ’light’ frozen dinners (i.e. items deemed to be ’calorie healthy’ by the
study authors) were extracted from this study. Information on funding was not reported

High risk
Data from a number of stores belonging
to one grocery chain were included, but
it is unclear how the stores were selected.
The introduction of legislation may have
drawn additional attention to signposting
throughout the city, not just the stores in
question (thus possibly introducing a co-
intervention)

Interventions
Intervention 1: brightly coloured (colour not specified) shelf label (2 inch × 5 inch, or 5
cm × 12.5 cm) stating: “0 calorie, 0 carbs” (on water, diet and regular fizzy drinks) (n =
3 vending machines)

Outcomes
Sales of water, diet and regular fizzy drinks (soda)
Notes
This study had a 2-week baseline period, a 5-week intervention period, and a 2-week
post-intervention period. Results from intervention 2 did not meet inclusion criteria for
this review so were not included. Data on sales of diet soda extracted from this study.

Methods
Setting: 222 New York City (NYC) Starbucks coffee shops before-and-after NYC energy
labelling legislation and 94 comparison stores in Boston and Philadelphia, USA
Design: controlled before-and-after study (treated as an ITS as data were collected from
multiple time points before and after the intervention)
Recruitment: convenience sample of Starbucks customers
Allocation to group: naturally occurring NYC legislation with Boston and Philadelphia
as comparisons
Participants
Customers at Starbucks coffee shops
Interventions
Intervention: energy (kcal) information on menus and menu boards in a font and format
that was at least as prominent as price (sample size not reported)
Control: no energy information on menus and menu boards (sample size not reported)
Outcomes
Energy (kcal) from food and drinks per transaction, obtained from electronic sales data
and ’Starbucks card’ holder data
Notes
The authors collected data for all transactions “for a period of time 3 months before and
11 months after energy posting commenced (i.e., January 1, 2008-February 28, 2009).
There are over 100 million transactions in the data set.” The data were analysed by the
authors using regression analysis. Figure 1 in the paper also presents the time series data
in graphical form for food and drinks separately. We extracted regression information
on combined data for food and drinks. Information on funding was not reported

Methods
Setting: university campus, USA
Design: randomised controlled trial
Recruitment: recruited through an introductory psychology course; participants received
a course credit for participation
Allocation to groups: no information on sequence generation was reported (the authors
only stated that they used a 2 × 2 × 3 between subjects design)
Participants
188 female undergraduate students, overall mean age not reported; 70.7% were Cau-
casian (understood to be white), 15.4% African-American and 13.9% Asian
Interventions
Intervention 1: Kashi logo (a brand associated with ’healthful’ eating) and a nutrition
facts label with low energy (kcal) information (i.e. 130 kcal - the actual amount of kcal
in each cookie) (n = 31)
Intervention 2: Kashi logo and nutrition facts label with high energy (kcal) information
(i.e. 260 kcal - twice the actual amount of kcal in each cookie) (n = 32)
Control 1: Kashi logo and no nutrition facts label (n = 31)
Intervention 3: Nabisco logo (a brand associated with ’unhealthful’ eating) and nutrition
facts label with low energy (kcal) information (i.e. 130 kcal - the actual amount of kcal
in each cookie) (n = 31)

Outcomes
Mean grams consumed assessed by weighing the portion served and portion remaining
Notes
Each participant was given three oatmeal and dark chocolate chip cookies, each of which
was broken in half (i.e. all participants actually received a Kashi cookie that was 130 kcal,
even though some were labelled as Nabisco cookies). In a post hoc analysis by the study
authors, data were combined for intervention 1 and 3, and compared with combined

Methods
Setting: university dining centre, USA
Design: interrupted time series
Recruitment: convenience sample of customers
Allocation to group: none, set periods for each intervention stage
Participants
Customers (largely college students) at a university dining centre
Interventions
Pre-intervention: no energy information; entrée descriptions posted on a 31 inch × 37
inch (79 cm × 94 cm) board for a 14-day period (n = 13,951 entrées sold)
Intervention: information on energy, serving size, fat (grams), protein (grams) and carbs
(grams) on a menu board (5 inch × 3 inch - or 12.7 × 7.6 cm - board) (n = 14,199 entrees
sold)
Post-intervention: no energy information; entrée descriptions posted on 8.5 inch × 11
inch (21.6 cm × 27.9 cm) floor stand as typically in cafeteria before study (n = 14,020
entrées sold)
Outcomes
Energy content of entrées sold per day (e.g. salads, soups, sandwiches, deli foods, pizza,
and other hot entrées), assessed by electronically collected sales data, with nutritional
content calculated using software
Notes
12 hot entrées were targeted in this study (not specified). It was conducted between 25
October and 8 December 2004. The study involved a 14-day pre-intervention period,
a 14-day intervention period, and a 13-day postintervention period. Data points were
reported for each day (41 days). The authors used ’piecewise’ regression to “test differ-
ences in average daily energy content of entrées purchased by dining center patrons for
pretreatment vs treatment period and treatment vs posttreatment period.” Figure 1 in
the paper also presents the time series data in graphical form. Information on funding

Setting: 20 dining centres on a campus of Cornell University, USA
Design: interrupted time series
Recruitment: convenience sample of customers
Allocation to group: none, set periods for intervention
Participants
Customers at a university dining centre
Interventions
Pre-labelling: no nutritional labelling of pre-packaged “Fresh-Take” meals and snacks
(sample size not reported)
Labelling: ’Nutrition Facts’ labels on pre-packaged meals and snacks, including infor-
mation on serving size, energy, energy from fat, total fat, saturated fat, transfat, total
cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates (including dietary fibre and sugars), and protein
(sample size not reported)
Outcomes
Energy purchased per week assessed from electronically collected sales data
Notes
63 (unspecified) food items were labelled. This study was conducted for 3 semesters pre-
labelling (fall 2006, spring 2007 and fall 2007) and 3 semesters post-labelling (spring
2008, fall 2008 and spring 2009). The final result was a 12-week set of data for each
semester (3 data points before and 3 date points after the intervention). “Mixed models
were used to determine if there was a significant trend or a difference in the proportion
of sales within the sample (the dependent variables) based on calories or fat.” Figure 1
in the paper also presents the time series data in graphical form. The authors stated the
study was supported by funds provided by DNS, Cornell University

Methods
Setting: a cinema in south London, UK
Design: randomised controlled study
Recruitment: on street recruitment by interviewers from a research agency
Allocation to group: a random number generator was used to assign participants to
condition
Participants
325 participants were randomised, of whom 38 were excluded
51% were aged 18-34 years, 36% were male, 37% were weight concerned, and 50%
were overweight or obese
Interventions
Intervention 1: green ’low fat’ label on the side of a bag of toffee or salted popcorn (n =
103)
Intervention 2: red ’high fat’ label on the side of a bag of toffee or salted popcorn (n =
96)
The bags of popcorn were given to the participants as they entered the cinema
Control: no label (n = 88)
Outcomes
Popcorn consumption as an absolute objective measure of energy (kcal)
Notes
Six sets of results were presented by the study authors (3 treatment conditions × 2 types
of popcorn). In our meta-analysis, data were extracted for red ’high fat’ label vs no label
(combining data on salted and toffee popcorn consumption). We also extracted data on

Outcomes
The probability of choosing low energy food items (entrées, vegetables and salads) was
assessed using electronic register sales data. Energy (kcal) content was calculated by the
study authors using a caloric estimate list
Notes
The authors stated that “purchases of more than 14,300 entrees, vegetables, and salads
by 6,970 customers were unobtrusively monitored via the cash register inventory control
system during 15 evening observations.” (15 time points were reported). The authors
stated that a “linear logistic regression analysis was used to compute chi-square tests of
the overall effects of labelling and food type (vegetable, salad, entrées) on the probability
of choosing a low calorie food”. Figure 1 in the paper also presents the time series data
in graphical form. Information on funding was not reported

Methods
Setting: university campus, USA
Design: randomised controlled trial
Recruitment: advertised as a market research study; participants received a course credit
for participation
Allocation to groups: no information on sequence generation was reported
Participants
175 female undergraduate students of the University of Hawaii, mean age 20.86 (4.
32) years. 71.8% were in the normal weight range, 14.4% were overweight, 6.3% were
obese, and 7.5% were underweight (BMI ≤ 18.5 kg/m²)
Interventions
Intervention 1: label stating “new colours of low fat M&M’s 240 calories, 1.69 oz [28.
3 g], ~55 M&M’s” (n = 47)
Control 1: label stating “new colour of low fat M&M’s” with no energy information (n
= 49)
Intervention 2: label stating “new colours of regular M&M’s, 240 calories per serving,
1.69 oz [28.3 g], ~55 M&M’s” (n = 41)
Control 2: label stating “new colours of regular M&M’s” with no energy information (n
= 38)
Outcomes
Energy (kcal) consumption assessed by weighing portion served and portion remaining
and calculating energy contained in the portion consumed
Notes
It is not clear how many sessions were conducted to complete this study, or where the
study was conducted on campus. Data were extracted on intervention 2 vs control 2,
and potential harms were considered by extracting data from control 1 (as M&M’s were
not actually low fat) vs control 2. Information on funding was not reported

Methods
Setting: university laboratory, Canada
Design: randomised controlled trial
Recruitment: students enrolled in introductory psychology who consented to participa-
tion in the study
Allocation to groups: a random number generator was used to assign participants to
condition
Participants
Undergraduate students (n = 254) enrolled in the introductory psychology class. 138
(54%) females and 116 males (45.7%)
Mean age of females was 18.69 (2.87) years and of males was 18.71 (1.79) years
Interventions
Intervention 1: energy label on menu indicating low-energy salad (400 kcal) and high-
energy pasta (1200 kcal) or high-energy salad (1200 kcal) and low-energy pasta (400
kcal) - although both salad and pasta were 1200 kcal (n = 128)
Intervention 2: energy label on menu indicating high-energy salad (1200 kcal) and high-
energy pasta (1200 kcal) plus information on the recommended daily energy intake of
2000 kcal for women and 2400 kcal for men, presented at the bottom of the menu (n
= 60)
Control: menu with no energy information (n = 66)
Outcomes
Energy consumed, with no detail as to how these measurements were made
Notes
Duration of study was not reported. Subgroup analysis was conducted by the study
authors to explore the impact of the intervention in more and less restrained eaters. The
Restraint Scale was used to categorise participants as restrained eaters (scoring 15 or
higher) or unrestrained eaters (scoring below 15). The effect of labelling on males and
females also explored. Data were extracted for intervention 2 vs control. We did not
include intervention 1 in this review as it involved mislabelling some of the foods, and
data were not reported separately on consumption of foods that were accurately labelled
and consumption of foods that were mislabelled. Information on study funding was not
reported

Setting: university, Canada
Design: randomised controlled trial
Recruitment: via newspaper, online and bus advertisements
Allocation to group: no information on sequence generation was reported
Participants
666 adults from Ontario (Canada), of whom 31 were excluded. Of those included, 36%
were aged 18-34 years, 49% were aged 35-65 years, and 15% were aged over 65. 71%
were white and 17% had no more than high school education, 64% had a college or
university education and 19% had postgraduate level education
Interventions
Intervention 1: menu with energy information (kcal) (n = 165)
Intervention 2: menu with energy (kcal) content using a traffic light format, indicating
whether the energy content was high (red), medium (orange) or low (green) (n = 156)
Intervention 3: menu with energy (kcal), fat, salt, and sugar information using a traffic
light format for each item (n = 152)
Control: menu with no nutritional information (n = 162)
Outcomes
Consumption of energy (kcal), fat, salt and sugar assessed by weighing food served and
food remaining after consumption and estimating energy and nutrients in what was
consumed based on nutritional content of choices given by the retailer
Notes
No detailed information regarding where the study took place (other than at a university),
but it was a separate location from the fast food chain (Subway) where food was purchased
on behalf of the participants. The study was conducted between November 2010 and
June 2011. Data were combined for Interventions 1, 2 and 3, and compared with the
control. This study was funded by a research grant from the Canadian Cancer Society

Control: menu with no energy labelling and no value pricing (n = 150)
Outcomes
Nutrient composition of meal purchased and consumed: absolute measure of the energy
and nutritional content (fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, protein, fibre, vitamin C and
calcium) were calculated using a food composition table available from the McDonald’s
corporation in combination with the gram weight information for the amount of each
food item selected and consumed
Notes
Participants chose items available from a McDonalds lunch/dinner menu, and research
staff drove to nearby McDonald’s restaurant to purchase meals ordered by the partici-
pants. Study sessions were held on weekday and weekend evenings (4:50 pm to 7:30
pm) between October 2005 and April 2006. Subgroup analyses were conducted by the
study authors for: men and women; those who reported seeing the intervention menus
and those who did not; those who reported that nutrition was important to them and
those who did not; and those who reported that price was important to them and those
who did not. Information about randomisation and raw data for subgroup analyses re-
quested, but no response from author. Data were extracted on intervention 1 vs control.
Interventions 2 and 3, which involved a price component, were not eligible for inclusion
in this review. The research was supported by a NIDDK grant

knew that they would not have to pay for
their meal.” No information was reported
regarding the number of participants who

Methods
Setting: restaurant at a country club, USA
Design: interrupted time series design
Recruitment: all children’s meals sold during study period were included in the analysis
Allocation to groups: none, set periods for intervention
Participants
Participants were those buying children’s meals at the restaurant of a family-oriented
private club
Interventions
Intervention 1: menu with energy (kcal) and fat (gram) information (sample size not
reported)
Intervention 2: healthy (apple) symbol on menu to denote ’healthier’ choices (sample
size not reported)
Intervention 3: Nutrition Bargain Price (NBP) on menu. “The NBP equals the monetary
price divided by a nutrition scaling factor (completeness score). By adjusting the price
by nutritional quality, a more immediate indicator of the nutritional cost/reward of the
combination, is provided.” (sample size not reported)
Control: no nutritional information on menu (sample size not reported)

Interventions
Intervention 1: menu with energy (kcal) information plus information on recommended
daily energy intake for women and men (n = 99)
Intervention 2: each menu item presented with the number of minutes brisk walking
required to burn off the energy in the item (n = 102)
Control: menu with no energy information (n = 99)
Outcomes
Energy consumed during the meal assessed by weighing the food served before and after
consumption
Notes
All menus contained the same fast food and beverage options including burgers, salads,
a chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets, chicken strips, french fries, desserts, condiments,
water, and a choice of sodas. The study was conducted from January to June 2012.
Data were extracted on Intervention 1 vs control. Intervention 2 was not eligible for

Methods
Setting: university campus laboratory, USA
Design: quasi-randomised controlled study
Recruitment: campus newspaper
Allocation to group: participants were assigned to groups based on the day of the week
that they were available for their sessions
Participants
40 healthy weight women aged 18-32 years
Interventions
Intervention: label (110 mm × 120 mm), which was colour-coded according to the
level of energy density; the label included information on level of energy density (low,
medium, or high), the actual value of energy density (1.25 kcal/g, 1.50 kcal/g, or 1.75
kcal/g), and the weight (g) and energy content per serving (n = 20)
Control: no labels (n = 20)
Outcomes
Daily energy intake from main entrées (breakfast, lunch and dinner); food was weighed
to assess the consumption in grams and kJ
Notes
Each meal included a main entrée, which was manipulated in energy density, and several
low-energy compulsory foods, which were standard in amount and type across all test
sessions. Entrées consisted of an Apple Bake Crisp for breakfast, a pasta salad with yogurt
dressing for lunch, and a pasta bake for dinner. The authors stated that “test sessions were
scheduled on the same day of the week for four weeks.” Subject group and condition
of energy density (low, medium, high) were entered as fixed factors in the model, and
subjectswere treatedasarandomfactor. Inthe meta-analyseswe enteredthe dataassessing

Participants were required to order an online meal for which they received a USD 3
discount on each lunch ordered throughout the study (up to 3 lunch orders per week)
. There were 13 different meal options including sandwiches with side dishes, wraps
with side dishes, and entrée-sized salads, as well as drinks (30 different options including
sodas, juices, teas and water), snacks, and desserts (e.g. chips, fresh fruit, brownies).
The study was conducted over 4 weeks. The authors also conducted regression analysis
by BMI, males and females, and for ’non-dieting’ and ’dieting’ individuals. Data were
extracted for interventions 2 and 3 (combined) vs control. Intervention 1 was not eligible

Energy (kcal) consumed; assessed by weighing the serving of M&M’s that participants
had served themselves (97.3% were observed to eat all that they had served themselves)
Notes
Participants helped themselves freely to M&M’s in labelled glass containers. The study
was conducted over 2 days. The authors stated that “no industry or government agency
funds supported this project”

Wansink 2006 - study 3
Methods
Setting: theatre located on a university campus, USA
Design: quasi-randomised controlled trial
Recruitment: university students and staff at a large university campus recruited to be
part of a study in which they would evaluate a pilot episode for a television show
Participants
179 participants; 49% males, mean age 28.7 years, mean BMI of 25.1 kg/m² with 110
normal-weight and 69 in the overweight group
Interventions
Intervention: each participant received 160 grams containing 640 kcal of granola in
ziplock bags that had an ’attractive’ 3.25 × 4 inch (8.26 cm × 10.2 cm) colour label:
“Low-Fat Rocky Mountain Granola” (sample size not reported)

Control: as above but the granola was described as “Regular Rocky Mountain Granola”.
Below this, the label indicated, “Contains 1 Serving” or “Contains 2 Servings”, or it
provided no serving size information (sample size not reported)
Outcomes
Energy (kcal) consumed; assessed by weighing of leftovers of granola
Notes
The study was conducted over 10 sessions that lasted from 3:30 to 5:00 pm on each of

Trial name or title
The effects of four front-of-pack labelling schemes compared to standard Nutrition Information Panel, on
mean nutrient profiling score of food purchases among the adult Australian consumers: a randomised trial
Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
1. Can read and understand English
2. Have a compatible smartphone (iPhone with iOS 7 or Android device with OS versions 4.3 or 4.4)
3. Are the main shopper of the household (do at least 50% of household shopping)
4. Shop at a supermarket at least once a week
5. Are 18 years or over
6. Provide informed consent
7. Do not plan to be away during the 5-week study period
8. Have never used FoodSwitch
Interventions
The labelling schemes that will be tested in the study are:
• Colour-coded multiple traffic-light labels (the current public health gold standard). The traffic-light
label uses green, amber and red colours to indicate the relative levels (low, medium and high) of four
nutrients (fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium).
• Monochrome daily intake guide labels (the current food industry option). This label provides
information on the level of energy, fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium per serving and the percentage of
each on the average Australian daily intake.
• The ’energy stars’ based front-of-pack nutrition label format selected by the federal government. The
label assigns a rating from 0.5 (less healthy) to 5 (most healthy) stars to foods basing on their Health Star
Rating score, calculated from energy, fat, sugar and salt content, and adjusted for other components, such as
fruit and vegetables.
• Advisory labels that warn against the purchase of less healthy products and encourage the purchase of
more healthy products. In addition to information available on the standard nutrition information panel,
this standard label will provide a green sign indicating a food being a healthy choice or a red sign indicating
the food being unhealthy and suggesting consumer to avoid. The warning signs are calculated basad on the
food nutrition profile score in each category.
Outcomes
Healthiness of food purchases as evaluated by the mean nutrient profile score of all food and beverage products
purchased over the four-week intervention period. Mean nutrient profiling score will be calculated using the
Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) nutrient profiling standard. Food purchase information
is collected via electronic records (participants will be asked to scan barcodes of purchased items and take
photos of the till receipts using the smartphone app and send to the study investigators. The app will then
transmit the data to study database. Participants will also be asked to send in the hard copies of their till

aThe authors also evaluated another intervention (’0 calorie, 0 carbs’ plus a motivational poster encouraging the purchase of water and

bThere were baseline differences between the groups. In addition, we could not provide a standardised effect due to the impact of small
randomised units (vending machines) on estimates of standard deviation.

aTwo other interventions were combined by the study authors as a ’calorie only’ intervention (400 kcal salad and 1200 kcal pasta,
and 1200 kcal salad and 400 kcal pasta (although both salad and pasta contained 1200 kcal)). We did not include this data in the
above analysis as it involved mislabelling some of the foods (data were not reported separately for consumption of foods that were
accurately labelled).
bMeans and SDs were reported separately for men and women by the study authors; we have combined these data.

this review.

Title: We altered the title to include non-alcoholic drinks as well as food because relevant studies rarely evaluated food and drink
separately. As a consequence, it was not possible to isolate the effect of labelling for these different products and to restrict the inclusion
criteria to food only would have let to the exclusion of several potentially relevant studies. We also altered our inclusion criteria to
reflect this change.
Background: we made small changes to the Background to bring the review up-to-date, including the addition of more recent references,
notably Rayner 2013.
Types of studies: the protocol and review state, “Based on Cochrane recommendations, [ITS] studies that reported only a simple pre and
post-intervention comparisons were not included in the review analysis unless a valid justification for their inclusion could be made or a
re-analysis of the data could enable data from multiple observations in the pre and post periods to be analysed using repeated measures
methods” (Cochrane Public Health Review Group 2010; EPOC 2015). We added the following sentence to clarify that studies that
either presented appropriate data in graphs, or did not present data in graphs, but did present other types of statistical tests (i.e. other
than t-tests) could be eligible for inclusion: “Authors had to present these data within a graph and/or at the very least analyse them
using regression analysis, preferably using segmented regression.”
Types of interventions: the protocol stated that a label could be compared to a group in which participants see the same food product
presented without a label or with an incomplete label. As we found a number of papers in the search that compared two or more types
of labels, we added the following text for clarity: “As noted above, the intervention labelling group had to be compared with a no-
labelling (or incomplete) control group. Thus, we excluded studies that only compared two or more different types of labelling schemes
without a control group.”
Primary outcomes: the protocol specified purchasing or consumption of foods only, but we also included studies that evaluated the effect
of labelling on purchasing of non-alcoholic drinks (for the reasons stated above). We also added the following sentence to this section
of the review for clarity: “We excluded studies that evaluated intention to purchase or intention to consume without an objectively
assessed measure of the behaviour.”
We also clarified that purchasing had to involve payment with money, as we found some studies in the evidence base that evaluated
choices in the settings of interest (e.g. grocery stores), but did not involve purchasing per se.
Food consumption: the protocol specified that where the food consumed was heterogeneous (e.g. a meal comprising various elements
with different nutritional content), the amount of each separate element consumed within the meal needed to be assessed for the study
to be included. However, this approach would have excluded a number of otherwise good-quality studies. Thus, we ended up including
studies that evaluated multiple food elements and consumption by weighing the meal before and after consumption.
Search methods for identification of studies: we also searched for trials in progress, which was an additional source not specified in the
study protocol.
Selection of studies: the protocol stated that “[w]here studies are excluded only on the basis of an incomplete label, the details of these
studies will be tabulated separately.” We did not identify any incomplete labels, so there was no need to tabulate any details separately.
Data extraction and management: we planned to extract data on any measures relating to the process of implementing the intervention,
including data on cost of implementing the intervention in any of the included studies. We did not do this in the final review due to
lack of data.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies:
We added detection bias to this section, which we had omitted. We also removed the risk of bias domain of outcome measurement
assessment, as objective outcome measurement was an inclusion criterion for the review. Moreover, we added information to the review
regarding how we determined an overall assessment of risk of bias for each study (which we had not specified in the protocol).

 The protocol specified that we would use the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (EPHPP 2009) to estimate the risk of
bias in controlled before-and-after studies and to compare the risk between different types of studies. We did not end up using this tool
because we did not identify any eligible controlled before-and-after studies.
In addition to the quality assessment strategies specified in the protocol, we conducted a GRADE assessment of the evidence for each
outcome according to Cochrane guidance.
Measures of treatment effect: we added the following two paragraphs to the review, which we did not present in the protocol. We added
the first paragraph to help quantify the results, and the second because many of the ITS studies were of poor quality, so we considered
re-analysis of the data to be of limited value:
“In order to re-express effect sizes using a more familiar metric, we calculated the percentage reduction in energy consumed over a
typical meal, using an average of 600 kcal as a baseline. This amount was based on mean daily energy intake across the UK population
of 1727 kcal or 7226 kJ (standard deviation (SD) 537 kcal or 2247 kJ, using data from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey
(National Centre for Social Research 2012). Our approach to re-expressing effect sizes was based on Hollands 2015.
”For ITS studies, we aimed to present statistical comparisons of time trends before and after the intervention (EPOC 2015). In all of the
ITS studies, we present the results as described by the study authors, typically as regression analyses. When studies also presented data
graphically, we did not attempt any re-analysis using segmented time series regression techniques if the data were already appropriately
analysed by the study authors or if we did not consider the study to be of sufficient quality to warrant re-analysis. We considered
one ITS study to be at low risk of bias (Bollinger 2011), but we could not re-analyse the data presented graphically due to a lack of
information. The figures presented weekly calories per transaction, but there were no data on the number of transactions per week;
this means that the absolute and relative variability of each point was unknown and could not be modelled with time series to provide
unbiased estimates.“
Unit of analysis issues: we updated this section to reflect current methodology. This section now states, ”For eligible cluster-randomised
trials, we planned to adjust the data to account for clustering if the study authors had not already done so. However, we only included
one cluster-RCT in the review, and the appropriate data needed to report and adjust the results were not available.“
Assessment of heterogeneity: we added a sentence to the review regarding how we would deal with non-statistical heterogeneity as well
as statistical heterogeneity (the protocol only described the latter).
Assessment of reporting biases: the protocol stated that we would use funnel plots to assess reporting biases. However, we could not do
this because none of the meta-analyses included more than 10 studies.
Data synthesis: the protocol stated, ”[W]e will only include studies considered to be at lower risk of bias in the meta-analysis“. We
included all available evidence in one meta-analysis but also did a separate sensitivity analysis for studies considered to be at lower risk
of bias. We did this in order to present a comprehensive overview of all of the evidence and because we considered very few studies to
be at low risk of bias.
A number of unanticipated data synthesis challenges emerged once we identified the included papers. In order to describe how we dealt
with these, we added the following text to the review:
1. ”For included studies with more than one eligible intervention arm, we combined data when studies contained information
about the same product characteristic (e.g. energy), albeit in multiple ways (e.g. varying in whether presented as numbers, colour
coded, activity-equivalents, and whether presented with recommended daily energy intake).
2. “Where studies assessed the impact of nutritional labelling adjacent to a range of food products and it was not possible to extract
an effect summary for the range of food products, we included the data for the product representing the most complete meal, for
example, sales of entrées (as opposed to sales of a side dish) (e.g. Dubbert 1984). If no products represented more or less complete
meals, we extracted data for products containing the greatest amount of energy.
3. ”Where studies reported a number of outcomes, such as consumption of a range of different nutrients, we used the most
frequently reported outcome among the included studies (e.g. Harnack 2008a). Had outcomes been reported in the same study that
related to both increased consumption of healthier foods and decreased consumption of less healthy foods, we would have prioritised
the latter.“
In addition, after examination of the included studies, we decided to conduct separate analyses for laboratory studies that offered
multiple and single food options (which we did not specify in the protocol). We added the following text to the section on data synthesis
124

Cochrane Collaboration.
 to describe our rationale: ”In the process of conducting the review, it became apparent that the studies also differed in terms of how
many labelled options participants had to choose from and what kind(s) of nutritional content the labels described. Participants had to
make absolute judgments when given only one labelled option and relative judgments when provided with a myriad of options labelled
differently. Thus, we analysed these studies separately.“
The exploration of effect modifiers: the protocol specified exploration of 10 possible effect moderators of nutritional labelling using
subgroup analysis.
1. Body weight: overweight (> BMI 25 kg/m²) or not overweight (< BMI 25 kg/m²).
2. Dietary restraint in individuals intending to diet: restrained eater or unrestrained eater.
3. Gender: male or female.
4. Label amount formats: relative amounts or absolute amounts of the nutrient or energy.
5. Label signposting: signposting present or absent.
6. The national context in which food was purchased or consumed. Initial examination of the literature indicated that a large
proportion of the current research originates in the USA. Thus we compared the effects of nutritional labelling in the USA versus
other countries. If there were sufficient variation in the country of study, we would make comparisons between countries.
7. Socioeconomic status: more socially deprived or less socially deprived.
8. Expectations of the taste the food: tastes bad or tastes good.
9. Price of the food: more expensive or less expensive.
10. Immediate context in which food is: purchased in a fast food restaurant or non-fast food restaurant; or consumed in a real-world
or laboratory setting.
There were sufficient data to analyse only two of these effects (dietary restraint and country). Further, the protocol described the
procedure for analysing moderating effects for both continuous and dichotomous outcomes. Given that all data included in the meta-
analysis were continuous, we removed the information about the analysis of dichotomous outcomes and added information about the
analysis of the continuous outcomes.
Assessment of heterogeneity: the protocol considers three potential sources of heterogeneity for exploration in subgroup analysis.
1. The impact of the positioning of the label, comparing those that appear on the food package with those appearing in another
location, such as on a supermarket shelf.
2. The impact of the information given on the label. First, we planned to compare labels giving information about a range of
nutrients versus those giving information about one nutrient. Second, as labels most frequently give energy information, we planned
to compare the impact of labels giving information about energy content with labels giving information about other nutrients.
3. The impact of the definitions of healthy purchasing and healthy consumption used in this review. More healthy purchasing is
considered to be decreased purchasing of less healthy foods or increased purchasing of more healthy foods, but these may be two
separate behaviours. We planned to use subgroup analysis to identify whether they were separate behaviours and this a source of
heterogeneity. Similarly, we planned to investigate possible heterogeneity as a consequence of defining more healthy consumption as
either decreased consumption of less healthy foods or increased consumption of healthier foods.
Due to lack of information (e.g. many studies did not report on the positioning of the label) and/or lack of differences in label format
between the studies, we did not conduct these planned subgroup analyses. Also, given that there were only four studies at low risk of
bias, various further subgroup analyses were not possible.
Sensitivity analysis: the protocol stated, ”Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore the impact of missing data comparing results
from available-case and ITT analysis. Sensitivity analyses will also be used to assess the effects of nutritional labelling on behaviour
across studies at both high and low risk of bias, specifically the meta-analyses will be re-run including all studies regardless of their risk
of bias. Additionally, the impact of the definition of nutritional labels used in this review will be explored. The meta-analyses will be
re-run including the studies excluded from the main analyses due to the presentation of an incomplete label rather than a complete
label (as described in the ’Description of the intervention’).“

 We did not conduct these analyses because only four studies at low risk of bias were available for analysis, which is not enough to enable
comparison in the above variables.
N O T E S
From the author team, 10 October, 2018, in response to recent retraction of several studies by Brian Wansink
On the 19th September 2018, JAMA, JAMA Internal Medicine and JAMA Pediatrics retracted six articles on which Brian Wansink (
John Dyson Professor of Marketing at Cornell University), was an author ( https://media.jamanetwork.com/news-item/jama-network-
retracts-6-articles-that-included-dr-brian-wansink-as-author/). Given seven previous retractions, this means that 13 of his articles
have been retracted as of 10th October 2018 ( http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dWansink). The retracted
articles are listed at the end of this note.
None of the 13 retracted articles authored by Wansink were included in this Cochrane review. The results and conclusions of the review
are therefore not affected.
Other articles on which Wansink is an author, and which have not been retracted, were included in this review. It includes 28 studies,
of which two studies were authored by Wansink.
The effects reported in this review are uncertain, attributable in part to evidence that is at significant risk of bias with, at best, GRADE
ratings of ‘low’ (meaning that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in estimated effects). These
retractions do, however, introduce additional uncertainty regarding the veracity of other studies Wansink has authored, including those
contributing to this review. Should any study included in this review be retracted, we will withdraw that study’s data from updated
meta-analyses conducted as part of future updates of this Cochrane review.
