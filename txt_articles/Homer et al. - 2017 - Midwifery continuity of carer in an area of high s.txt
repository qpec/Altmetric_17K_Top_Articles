Midwifery continuity of carer in an area of high socio-economic disadvantage in London: a 
retrospective analysis of Albany Midwifery Practice outcomes using routine data (1997-
2009) 
ABSTRACT  
Objective: In 1997, The Albany Midwifery Practice was established within King's College 
Hospital NHS Trust in a South East London area of high social disadvantage. The Albany 
midwives provided continuity of care to around 216 women per year, including those with 
obstetric, medical or social risk factors. In 2009, the Albany Midwifery Practice was closed in 
response to concerns about safety, amidst much publicity and controversy. The aim of this 
evaluation was to examine trends and outcomes for all mothers and babies who received 
care from the practice from 1997-2009. 
Design: A retrospective, descriptive analysis of data routinely collected over the 12.5 year 
period was undertaken including changes over time and outcomes by demographic 
features.  
Setting and participants: All women booked with the Albany Midwifery Practice were 
included.   
Findings: Of the 2,568 women included over the 12.5 year period, more than half (57%) 
were from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities; one third were single and 
11.4% reported being single and unsupported. Almost all women (95.5%) were cared for in 
labour by either their primary or secondary midwife.  There were high rates of spontaneous 
onset of labour (80.5%), spontaneous vaginal birth (79.8%), homebirth (43.5%), initiation of 
breastfeeding (91.5%) and breastfeeding at 28 days (74.3% exclusively and 14.8% mixed

feeding). Of the 79% of women who had a physiological third stage, 5.9% had a postpartum 
haemorrhage. The overall rate of caesarean section was 16%. The preterm birth rate was 
low (5%). Ninety-five percent of babies had an Apgar score of 8 or greater at 5 minutes and 
6% were admitted to a neonatal unit for more than two days. There were 15 perinatal 
deaths (perinatal mortality rate of 5.78 per 1000 births); two were associated with 
significant congenital abnormalities. There were no intrapartum intrauterine deaths.   
Key conclusions: This analysis has shown that the Albany Midwifery Practice demonstrated 
positive outcomes for women and babies in socially disadvantaged and BAME groups, 
including those with complex pregnancies and perceived risk factors.  
Implications for practice: Consideration should be given to making similar models of care 
available to all women.

HIGHLIGHTS 
The Albany Midwifery Practice was established within King's College Hospital NHS Trust in a 
South East London area of high social disadvantage and provided care to 2,568 women from 
1997 until 2009. 
• The caseload included high proportions (57%) of women from Black, Asian and 
Minority Ethnic communities. 
• Midwifery continuity of carer was high with almost all women (95.5%) being 
attended in labour by their primary or secondary midwife. 
• Spontaneous birth rates were high (79.8%) with a low caesarean section rate (16%). 
Overall, 43.5% of women gave birth at home. 
• Neonatal outcomes were positive with 95% of babies having Apgar scores of >8 at 5 
minutes; 6% spending greater than 2 days in the NNU. There were 15 perinatal 
deaths and no intrapartum intrauterine deaths.

BACKGROUND 
In 2016, Better Births, the five-year forward view for maternity care in England, proposed 
major changes to how maternity care is delivered. Key recommendations included “… 
continuity of carer, to ensure safe care based on a relationship of mutual trust and respect 
in line with the woman’s decisions. Every woman should have a midwife, who is part of a 
small team of 4 to 6 midwives, based in the community who knows the woman and family, 
and can provide continuity throughout the pregnancy, birth and postnatally”(p. 9) (NHS 
England 2016). 
This policy directive was a response to reports of fragmented care, seen increasingly in high 
income countries where relationships have been replaced by technology (Davis-Floyd 2001; 
Mander & Murphy-Lawless 2013). The report cited robust evidence identifying the benefits 
of midwifery continuity of carer for mothers and babies in terms of improving safety, clinical 
outcomes, and positive experiences for women (Sandall et al. 2016). 
There is now considerable evidence – from randomised controlled trials as described above 
(Sandall et al. 2016), descriptive and comparative analyses (McIntyre 2012; Page et al. 1999; 
Tracy et al. 2014) and qualitative studies (de Jonge et al. 2014 ; Leap et al. 2010) as to the 
benefits of midwifery continuity of care for women, midwives and the health system 
(Homer 2016). In light of the evidence supporting midwifery continuity of care, the World 
Health Organization’s guidelines on antenatal care (WHO 2016) recently recommended 
that: “Midwife-led continuity-of-care models, in which a known midwife or small group of 
known midwives supports a woman throughout the antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal 
continuum, are recommended for pregnant women in settings with well-functioning 
midwifery programmes” (p.89).

Despite the benefits, implementation and scale-up, so that every woman benefits from a 
continuity of carer model of care, has been challenging in many countries. However, 
learning from previous models operating in the United Kingdom (UK) may assist this 
process. In the early 1990s, in response to government documents encouraging more 
choice, control and continuity of care for childbearing women in England (Department of 
Health 1993; House of Commons 1992), a group of six midwives, based in a community 
centre in Deptford, established the South East London Midwifery Group Practice and 
negotiated the first National Health Service (NHS) contract between a local health authority 
and self-employed midwives. They successfully applied for NHS funding to address 
inequalities in health and promote long term health gain through the provision of 
community based, continuity of midwifery carer throughout the childbearing period 
(caseload practice model) to groups of women known to have poor health outcomes due to 
various forms of disadvantage (Reed & Walton 2009). 
The Albany Midwifery Practice 
In 1997, the South East London Midwifery Group Practice negotiated a new contract with 
the King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, who agreed to indemnify the midwives in 
accordance with clinical protocols and Trust policies (Reed & Walton 2009). The Practice 
changed its name to the Albany Midwifery Practice and became one of eight NHS midwifery 
group practices providing midwifery continuity of care within the King's maternity service 
(Demilew 2007). 
The contract with King's College Hospital (King’s) specified that the Albany Midwifery 
Practice was to provide midwifery care to 216 women per year (36 women per whole time 
equivalent midwife). The practice was based in the community in Peckham, an area within 
 
 
 
Page 5 
  
 
the South East London borough of Southwark, which was ranked at that time as the 14th 
most deprived district of 354 districts in England (Sandall, Davies & Warwick 2001). 
Compared to all other London Boroughs, Southwark had the highest proportion of: babies 
born with low or very low birth weights; babies of mothers born in East and West Africa and 
the Caribbean; and, babies of mothers who identified as sole parents during the Birth 
Registration process (Bowles, Walters & Jacobson 2007). 
Access to the Albany Midwifery Practice was primarily for women registered with three 
General Practitioner (GP) practices (family medicine practices) based in a council (public) 
housing estate in Peckham. The midwives provided care for women, regardless of any 
perceived obstetric, medical or social risk, the understanding being that they would 
collaborate with obstetricians, other practitioners and both hospital and community based 
services as needed. The Albany midwives were an integrated part of the King’s NHS 
maternity service and were thus able to directly access medical and social services and refer 
women to these at the point of need and at no cost. 
Each woman who booked with the Albany Midwifery Practice was assigned two named 
midwives: a primary midwife responsible for providing and coordinating her individualised 
care and a second midwife. These two midwives provided antenatal, intrapartum and 
postnatal care up to 28 days following birth (Figure 1).  
Figure 1: The Albany Midwifery Practice Model  
• Woman assigned a primary and second midwife to provide antenatal, intrapartum and 
postnatal care up to 28 days post-partum. 
• Primary midwife makes contact with the woman in early pregnancy to identify herself as 
 
 
 
Page 6 
  
 
a point of contact for any queries prior to the booking visit.  
• First antenatal visit (booking) in the woman’s home – individualised plan of care made. 
• Antenatal visits in the midwives’ community based premises. If women referred for 
obstetric review or non-routine investigations, their midwife usually accompanies them 
to provide support and facilitate interdisciplinary working and a joint plan for care. 
• Free, weekly antenatal groups facilitated by the midwives are available throughout 
pregnancy to all local women (including those not booked with the Albany midwives) for 
information sharing, peer support and community building (afternoon groups for 
women only and evening groups for women with or without partners). 
• 36-week home visit (‘The Birth Talk’) – support in labour and during the postnatal period 
discussed with the woman and her supporters. 
• Decision about place of birth flexible: from booking through to final decision in labour 
enabling decision making at each stage and consideration of a woman’s progress, 
individual circumstances and wishes. 
• Home visit/s in labour by midwives with all equipment needed for a homebirth. 
• Labour, birth and immediate postnatal care provided by primary and/or second 
midwife, including when obstetric or other medical interventions necessary. 
• Postnatal visits up to 28 days following birth – in hospital and/or the woman’s home. 
• Weekly postnatal support groups facilitated by Albany midwives in their premises, 
available to all local women (including those not booked with the Albany midwives) for 
women in the first few months following birth.

An independent evaluation of the Albany Midwifery Practice, commissioned by King’s 
College Hospital, was conducted in 2001 (Sandall, Davies & Warwick 2001). This evaluation 
analysed clinical outcomes for only the first three years (1997-1999) and included 636 
women. This showed that, when compared to other midwifery group practices at King's, the 
Albany Midwifery Practice had: a higher homebirth rate; a lower induction rate; a higher 
vaginal birth rate; a lower elective caesarean section rate; and a very high level of continuity 
(89% of women were attended during labour by their primary midwife and Albany midwives 
were in attendance at 98% of the births).  
In 2007, an internal report by King's identified the important contribution that its eight 
midwifery group practices were making to the maternity unit’s efforts to tackle health 
inequalities and promote wellbeing (Demilew 2007). The report drew on maternity service 
data for all women who booked and gave birth with King's in 2006 and cited the Albany 
Midwifery Practice’s exceptionally high rates for: initiation of breastfeeding (99%), 
spontaneous vaginal birth (81.4%), and home birth (44.8%) and also its low caesarean 
section rate (15.2%).  
Various qualitative studies have also commented on the positive experiences for women 
associated with the relational continuity of care provided by the Albany midwives (Huber & 
Sandall 2006, 2009; Kemp & Sandall 2010; Leap et al. 2009; Leap et al. 2010) and other 
models of caseload care (Beake et al. 2013; McCourt, Page & Hewison 1998). In 2009, 
however, the Albany Midwifery Practice was closed in response to concerns from the Trust 
about safety, amidst much publicity and controversy (AIMS 2010; Edwards & Davies 2010; 
Yiannouzis 2010).

In light of the unique nature of the Albany Midwifery Practice, its influence on policy (NHS 
2007; UK Parliament 2000), practice and research, its high profile in the international 
midwifery arena, and the unresolved controversy around the closing of the practice 
(Edwards 2011; Walsh 2010), an independent examination of the maternal and neonatal 
outcomes over a period of 12 and a half years was seen critical, hence this evaluation was 
undertaken. 
The objectives of this evaluation were to examine trends and outcomes for all mothers and 
babies who received care from the Albany Midwifery Practice from 1997-2009, specifically: 
• 
Describe the birth outcomes for these women 
• 
Analyse changes over time in the profile of women booking and in the outcomes for 
women and babies in three-four year increments over the 12 and a half year period 
• 
Compare outcomes for women from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups 
with outcomes for White women (the BAME group included women from Black 
Caribbean, Black African, Black British, Asian (Indian), South East Asian and other 
minority ethnic groups.)  
METHOD 
Design and setting 
The study design was a retrospective analysis of routinely collected data. As such, we 
ensured that it complied with the RECORD reporting guidelines identified for such analysis 
(Benchimol et al. 2015). The study was set in Peckham in South East London, which was an 
area of high social disadvantage.  
 
 
 
Page 9 
  
 
As the study was classified as a service evaluation or audit, ethical approval was not 
required by the National Health Service at the time that data was collected for audit 
(Department of Health 2005). The data custodian is the former practice manager and has 
provided permission for these data to be analysed. The midwives who formerly worked in 
the Albany Midwifery Practice did not influence this evaluation and were only consulted on 
points of clarification or where additional data were required.  
We chose not to include a control group as we did not have access to individual records for 
women who gave birth and were attended by midwives in the King’s NHS Trust; it therefore 
would have been unfeasible to undertake to match appropriate controls over the time 
period.  
Participants 
All women who booked with the Albany Midwifery Practice during the study period were 
included. Women were excluded if they initially booked with the Practice but had 
subsequently: 
• 
moved out of the area and given birth elsewhere 
• 
had an elective termination of pregnancy 
Variables, data sources and collection 
During the period April 1997 to September 2009, data from over 2500 birth summary sheets 
(hand written by the Albany midwives) were entered onto the practice’s database. The 
database was made available to the lead author (CH) for the purposes of conducting this 
independent analysis and shared with the research team.  
 
 
 
Page 10 
  
 
The birth summary sheets identified the main variables used in this analysis, including: 
maternal demographics and past obstetric history; events and complications during 
pregnancy, labour and birth; breastfeeding and neonatal outcomes including gestation; 
Apgar scores; birth weight; admission to the neonatal unit (NNU); and perinatal mortality. 
Perinatal mortality was defined as stillbirths or neonatal deaths in the first 28 days of life in 
babies born at a gestation of 24 weeks or greater (Office for National Statistics (ONS) 2016).  
A group of eight midwives, all of whom had worked in the Albany Midwifery Practice for 
several years, responded to queries regarding clarification about abbreviations, data 
collection processes, data anomalies and missing data. The midwives checked every tenth 
entry on the database against the original hand written birth summary sheets and were able 
to report the accuracy of neonatal outcomes for over 250 entries.  
The database was then reviewed, duplicates were removed and final queries were 
generated. For some variables there are small numbers of missing data. These are explained 
where relevant in the tables.  
We chose to use the practice database rather than the routine data collection systems in 
the King’s NHS Trust. This was because the practice database was more consistent over time 
and access was more readily available to the researchers. The Albany midwives had always 
collected their own data in order to enable easy access for reviewing up to date outcomes 
and reflecting on these in their twice-weekly practice meetings (Reed & Walton 2009)\. 
Outcomes for individual women booked with the Albany midwives could only be done 
through the Albany database, including, for example, data on reasons for transfer; 
breastfeeding postnatally; and midwifery continuity of carer.

Data analysis 
Data were analysed using IBM-SPSS software and were undertaken by Author #1 who was 
not connected with, and had never worked in, the Albany Midwifery Practice.  
Initially, to determine whether there had been changes over time in the profile of women 
booking with the AMP, an analysis of the key demographic variables by year was undertaken 
(ethnicity, age, support status, housing, parity, previous CS). 
As the proportion of women from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities 
was known to be considerably higher than the background rates in the UK, we undertook an 
analysis comparing the outcomes for BAME and White women who received care from 
Albany midwives.  
FINDINGS 
In total, there were 2568 women who were booked with the Albany Midwifery Practice over 
the time period. The mean age of women was 30 years (range 14-50 years). Four percent of 
women were less than 20 years of age. Just over one third (36%) were considered White 
with more than half (57%) from BAME groups, including women with mixed ethnicity. More 
than one third of women (35%) lived in council (public) housing and one third were single 
with 11% overall reporting that they were single and unsupported.  
Maternal outcomes 
More than half of women (57%) were multiparous; of these, the proportion who had had a 
previous caesarean section was 18%. The proportion of women with medical risk factors (for 
example, hypertension and diabetes) was low.  
 
 
 
Page 12 
  
 
<Table 1 here> 
Just over one quarter of women (28%) specifically planned a homebirth at their initial visit 
with the Albany midwives. This increased to 38% at the 36-week visit. Ultimately, 43.5% of 
women gave birth at home with an additional 18 women (0.7%) giving birth at home before 
the arrival of the midwife (Table 2).  
<Table 2 here> 
Almost all women (95.5%) were cared for in labour by either their primary or secondary 
midwife: The vast majority of women (87.1%, n=2236) had their primary midwife at their 
birth (Table 2).  
Most women (80.5%) commenced labour spontaneously and 6.5% had an induction of 
labour. One third (30.3%) used water immersion for labour (17.3% gave birth into water) 
and the use of analgesia was low (only 9.9% of women used epidural analgesia; 1.2% were 
given Pethidine and 15.4% used Entonox). Fifteen per cent of women were transferred to 
hospital during labour, mostly for slow progress in labour (7.7%). Three percent of women 
were transferred due to concerns about fetal wellbeing.  
Overall, 79.8% of women had a spontaneous birth with an overall caesarean section (CS) 
rate of 16%. Of the 84% of women who had a vaginal birth (spontaneous and instrumental), 
78% had a physiological third stage of labour with 5.9% of these women having a 
postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) (blood loss >500mL). The overall PPH rate for all births was 
14% (2.3% had a blood loss of 1000 - 1500mL and 0.5% had a blood loss of >1500mL). Two 
thirds of women who had a vaginal birth had no perineal trauma (62.2%) (Table 3). Sixteen 
women (0.7%) were recorded as having had a third degree tear and there were no fourth 
 
 
 
Page 13 
  
 
degree tears. Data collected for third degree tears included any tears involving the anal 
sphincter – this was a definition used when the database was set up; data collection was not 
amended after the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists first published 
guidelines defining fourth degree tears in 2001 (RCOG 2015). 
<Table 3 here> 
Neonatal outcomes 
In total, there were 2585 babies born including 21 sets of twins and one set of triplets. Most 
babies (93.8%) were born at full term with a preterm birth rate (<37 weeks) of 5.1%. Fewer 
than 5% of babies (4.5%) were low birth weight (<2500gms).  
Most babies (94.8%) had an Apgar score of 8 or greater at 5 minutes and 6.2% (n=160) were 
admitted to a Neonatal Unit (NNU) for more than two days. The most frequent reasons for 
admission were being preterm (n=51) and low Apgar score/hypoxia (n=54).  
Almost all women commenced breastfeeding at birth (91.5%) with three-quarters of women 
(74.3%) overall exclusively breastfeeding at 28 days. An additional 14.8% were practising 
mixed feeding by this time (Table 4).  
<Table 4 here> 
There were 15 perinatal deaths, which included 7 antenatal intrauterine deaths and 8 
neonatal deaths (NND). There were no intrapartum deaths: all of the seven stillbirths 
occurred before the onset of labour. Of the 15 perinatal deaths, one was at 24 weeks, three 
were at 29-34 weeks, two at 35-36 weeks and nine at 37-42 weeks gestation (Table 5). Five 
deaths were in babies whose mother had a previous CS (two stillbirths and three NNDs) and 
11 were babies in women from minority ethnic groups (Black or Asian) (six stillbirths and 
 
 
 
Page 14 
  
 
five NNDs). Of the 8 NNDs, one was a baby with significant renal dysplasia and another was 
a baby with a cerebral tumor.   
<Table 5 here> 
Sub-group analyses by parity 
We examined selected outcomes by parity. Multiparous women were more likely to be 
older, from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic group, less likely to require transfer in labour 
and more likely to have a homebirth (Table 6).  
<Table 6 here> 
Changes over time 
There were a few changes during the 12.5 years that the Albany Midwifery Practice was 
operating. These were examined in 3-4 year blocks (Table 7). The proportion of women 
identifying their ethnicity as White decreased significantly over time accounting for just over 
one third of women by 2006-2009.  
The rate of women with a previous CS and those who ultimately had a CS did not change 
significantly over the 13 years. There were a number of practice changes over time: the rate 
of waterbirth increased as did the proportion of women who were planning a homebirth at 
the 36 week home visit. There were no differences in the proportion of babies admitted to a 
NNU.  
The perinatal mortality rate varied over the time periods (1.8-7.7 per 1000 live births) 
although the absolute numbers were small (1-6 babies per time period). 
<Table 7 here> 
 
 
 
Page 15 
  
 
Outcomes for women from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) Groups 
Given the high proportion of BAME women accessing the Albany Midwifery Practice, we 
analysed specific outcomes for this group and compared these with women who identified 
as being from White ethnic groups (Table 8). BAME women were more likely to be younger, 
single, living in council (public) housing and be multiparous than White women. They were 
also less likely to have a homebirth or have a spontaneous vaginal birth. Their babies were 
more likely to be born preterm or be of low birth weight. While there were no differences in 
the initiation of breastfeeding, by 28 days, BAME women were more likely to be mixed 
feeding and less likely to be exclusively breastfeeding compared with White women.  
<Table 8 here> 
DISCUSSION  
We undertook this retrospective audit to examine the trends and outcomes for all mothers 
and babies who received care from the Albany Midwifery Practice during 12 and a half 
years, from 1997-2009. The Albany Midwifery Practice is a model that was emulated and 
used as a template for other midwife-led services around the world before the contract was 
terminated in 2009 due to safety concerns (Yiannouzis 2010). This was highly controversial 
in the local community and in midwifery circles and led to a number of commentaries in 
relation to the decision (AIMS 2010; Edwards 2011; Edwards & Davies 2010; Walsh 2010). 
Significant proportions of women attending the Albany Midwifery Practice were from BAME 
groups and/or single, both characteristics associated with poorer neonatal outcomes 
(Raleigh et al. 2010). This is in keeping with the local population which is highly ethnically 
diverse. In 2006, the ethnic profile of women using King’s College Hospital maternity 
 
 
 
Page 16 
  
 
services included 42% who identified as Black African or Caribbean and only 43% who 
identified as White British (Demilew 2007). This is more diverse than in greater London 
where from the most recent data, 60% of people residing in London are White British with 
13% being Black/African/ Caribbean/ Black British (13%) and 19% being Asian/Asian British 
Indian and 5% identifying as Mixed/ Multiple Ethnic Groups (Office for National Statistics 
2011).  
It has been shown that women from BAME groups and single women are at higher risk of 
adverse outcomes during pregnancy and after. For example, these women are more likely to 
experience complications during pregnancy, an unplanned  
caesarean section, and having 
their baby cared for in a neonatal unit than those from the White British group (Raleigh et 
al. 2010). Babies of Black or Black British and Asian or Asian British ethnicity have also been 
shown to have the highest risk of extended perinatal mortality with rates of 9.8 and 8.8 per 
1,000 total births respectively (Manktelow et al. 2015). These rates are considerably higher 
than the Albany rate of less than 2.0 per 1000 births in women from BAME groups (Table 8). 
In addition, in a UK survey, women in all minority ethnic groups had a poorer experience of 
maternity services than White women (Henderson, Gao & Redshaw 2013) and expressed 
more worries about labour and birth (Redshaw & Heikkilä 2011). While our study did not 
examine women’s experiences, the fact that they had positive labour and birth outcomes 
suggests that they felt supported by the Albany Midwifery Practice. This is in keeping with a 
qualitative study where women from BAME backgrounds in an inner-city area identified that 
receiving caseload care enhanced the emotional social support they received from 
midwives, enabling them to feel safe, relaxed and able to confide about problems within a 
trusting relationship (Beake et al. 2013). 
 
 
 
Page 17 
  
 
The preterm birth rate in our study was low (5.1%) with 94.8% of babies having an Apgar 
score of 8 or greater at 5 minutes and 6.2% admitted to a NNU for more than two days. 
There were 15 perinatal deaths over this period giving a perinatal mortality rate of 5.78 per 
1000 total births. Two of the deaths were associated with significant congenital 
abnormalities and there were no intrapartum intrauterine deaths.  
The perinatal mortality data for babies born through the Albany Midwifery Practice were 
lower than the rates for the United Kingdom over a similar period, where from 2000-2009, 
the perinatal mortality rate ranged from 7.5-8.5 per 1000 total births (Centre for Maternal 
and Child Enquiries (CMACE) 2011). The perinatal mortality rate in the Albany Midwifery 
Practice varied over the time period (1.8-7.7 per 1000 total births) although the absolute 
numbers were small (1-6 babies per 3-4 year time period). In addition, the rate of preterm 
births is lower than the national average. Between 2006-2010, the rate of preterm birth in 
the UK was 7-7.5% (Office of National Statistics 2012); higher than the 5.1% rate in the 
Albany Midwifery Practice.  
Our audit has shown that the Albany Midwifery Practice supported high rates of 
physiological births, a phenomenon described in a small study of midwifery caseload 
practice for similarly socially disadvantaged women (Rayment-Jones, Murrells & Sandall 
2015). In more than 12 years, almost 80% of women had spontaneous vaginal births and 
16% had caesarean sections (12.2% emergency CS and 3.8% elective CS). The average 
caesarean section rate across England over that time ranged from 17-25% highlighting the 
lower rates in the Albany Midwifery Practice (Health and Social Care Information Centre 
2013).

The low incidence of birth assisted by forceps or ventouse (4.2%) may have been related to 
only 10% of women having an epidural in labour, given the identified increased risk of 
assisted vaginal birth associated with epidural analgesia (Anim-Somuah, Smyth, & Howell, 
2005). Only 1.2% of women were given Pethidine and 15% used Entonox. Almost all women 
(95.5%) were supported by known midwives highlighting the value of midwifery continuity 
of care as a strategy to help women cope with pain as part of normal childbirth (Leap et al. 
2010; Sandall et al. 2016; Sanders & Lamb 2014; Van der Gucht & Lewis 2015). 
In this study, most women commenced labour spontaneously (80.5%) and only 13.6% of 
labours involved induction, stimulation or augmentation of labour. The majority of women 
had no perineal trauma (62.2%); third degree tears were rare (0.7%), and the episiotomy 
rate was 3.8%. These results lend weight to evidence linking perineal trauma with 
episiotomy, induction of labour, epidural analgesia and assisted vaginal birth (Kudisha, 
Sokolb & Kruger 2008; Räisänen, Vehviläinen-Julkunen & Heinonen 2010). There has been a 
suggestion that, where midwives reduce the number of episiotomies they perform, they 
tend to gain skill in preserving the woman's perineum intact (Begley 2014). Data on the 
techniques used by Albany midwives were not collected; this raises the importance of 
recording such information so that it can be examined retrospectively in order to contribute 
to research in this area (Petrocnik & Marshall 2015). 
The majority (79%) of women who had a vaginal birth had a physiological third stage of 
labour. Of interest is that only 5.9% of women in this group had a blood loss of more than 
500ml. Similar outcomes have been recorded in large studies in New Zealand (Davis et al. 
2012; Dixon, Skinner & Foureur 2013). It has been suggested that midwives who are 
experienced in physiological third stage may have skills that protect women from excessive 
 
 
 
Page 19 
  
 
blood loss in normal labour (Begley 2014; Begley et al. 2012; Jangsten, Hellström & Berg 
2010). 
Almost all (95.5%) women were attended in labour by their primary midwife or secondary 
midwife who they had got to know during pregnancy. Strong evidence has linked this 
relational continuity of care, often referred to as ‘caseload midwifery,’ to a reduction in the 
use of epidurals, episiotomies, instrumental births and pre-term births (Sandall et al. 2016). 
Caseload midwifery for women of any risk has also been associated with a reduction in 
elective CS, the use of pharmacological analgesia, induction of labour, and birth related 
blood loss, with an increase in the likelihood of continued breastfeeding after six weeks and 
six months and cost savings (Tracy et al. 2013). 
The breastfeeding rates in women cared for by the Albany midwives were high: 91.5% 
initiated breastfeeding and 74.3% were still exclusively breastfeeding at 28 days (an 
additional 14.8% were mixed feeding). The promotion of breastfeeding is an important 
aspect of the public health role of midwives, with implications for addressing health 
inequalities and potential health gain (Department of Health 2007a, 2010; Pokhrel et al. 
2015). 
The results of this audit add to the body of literature questioning the routine use of medico-
technical interventions in labour (Begley 2014; Johanson, Newburn & Macfarlane 2002). 
They are of particular interest given that the women who accessed the Albany Midwifery 
Practice included those with pregnancies considered to be at all levels of obstetric, medical 
and social risk. Furthermore, the profile of the 2,568 women reflected that of the local 
population in Southwark, a high proportion being in groups considered to be most 
vulnerable in terms of socio-economic disadvantage and poor maternity outcomes 
 
 
 
Page 20 
  
 
(Department of Health 2007b; Manktelow et al. 2015; Office for National Statistics 2016). In 
particular, women from BAME communities and single, unsupported mothers are more 
likely than White British women to experience complications, adverse outcomes, worry, and 
poor experiences of care during pregnancy and afterwards (Henderson, Gao & Redshaw 
2013; Raleigh et al. 2010; Redshaw & Heikkilä 2011). 
Midwifery continuity of carer can play an important role in addressing the needs of 
vulnerable women through the opportunity to build trusting relationships and access to 
safe, supportive services (Beake et al. 2013; Beake, McCourt & Page 2001; Department of 
Health 2010; Manktelow et al. 2015; McCourt & Pearce 2000; ten Hoope-Bender 2013). In 
previous studies, women who received care from Albany midwives have described a sense 
of calm and trust that this type of relational continuity of care engendered (Huber & Sandall 
2009). This gave them a chance to develop self-confidence as they approached the 
challenges of labour and new motherhood, including breastfeeding (Huber & Sandall 2009; 
Leap et al. 2010). 
One of the distinguishing features of the Albany Midwifery Practice model is access to, and 
support of, homebirth. The percentage of women who gave birth at home with the Albany 
midwives was 43.5%. Government documents in England have consistently promoted the 
idea that healthy women should be offered the choice of giving birth at home (Department 
of Health 1993, 2004, 2007a); yet home birth has remained relatively uncommon over the 
years (below 3% in England). A large study comparing perinatal outcomes by planned place 
of birth (Birthplace in England Collaborative Group 2011) supported offering women with 
low risk pregnancies a choice of birth settings, including birth at home (NICE 2014). Despite 
 
 
 
Page 21 
  
 
this, the rates of homebirth remain static at 2.3% in 2012 and 2013 in England and Wales 
(Office for National Statistics 2014). 
The Albany midwives’ practice included developing a positive culture around birth at home 
in the local community (Reed 2015).  The option to give birth at home remained open, 
including during labour, hence the changing proportion of women choosing this option as 
their pregnancies progressed. Caseload midwifery may allow more time and space for 
decision making to emerge fully, especially where home assessment in early labour allows 
for women to choose to stay at home or go to hospital, depending on how their labour is 
unfolding (Brintworth & Sandall 2012).  
Of the women who chose to give birth at home, 15.1% experienced transfer to hospital in 
labour (12.4% primiparous, 5.5% multiparous women). The implications of this are 
significant given the rates of transfer from home to an obstetric unit identified in the 
Birthplace in England (Birthplace in England Collaborative Group 2011) study: 45% for 
primiparous women and 12% for multiparous women.  
The proportion of women from BAME communities who gave birth at home with Albany 
midwives was lower than the proportion of White women. However, the fact that around 
one third of women from BAME groups gave birth at home is significant in light of the 
Birthplace in England Study (Birthplace in England Collaborative Group 2011), which 
identified that women choosing to give birth at home were less likely to be in BAME groups.  
We examined the data over 3-4 year time periods to see whether there were differences in 
demographic characteristics, practice and outcomes. The proportion of women identifying 
their ethnicity as White decreased significantly over time. It is interesting that over this 
 
 
 
Page 22 
  
 
time, the rate of waterbirth increased as did the proportion of women who planned a 
homebirth at 36 weeks. This could be explained by the growing confidence of the general 
population in the concept of waterbirth and the development of a local culture where birth 
at home with known midwives was seen as a normal and positive option for healthy women 
with uncomplicated pregnancies (Leap et al. 2010; Reed 2015). An increase in the rate of 
homebirth is in contrast to practices in the majority of countries, where homebirth has 
decreased. For example, the home birth rate in the Netherlands is the highest in high 
income countries, although it has declined from 35 percent of all births in 1997 to 2000 to 
16 percent of all births in 2013 despite strong evidence showing safety (Birthplace in 
England Collaborative Group 2011; de Jonge et al. 2015). It is important to note that there 
were no significant changes in the rate of admission to a neonatal unit over these time 
periods. 
Limitations of this study  
This study has involved the analysis of retrospective data and there was a small amount of 
missing data for some variables, particularly around reasons for admission and length of 
stay on the neonatal unit. Using a practice database of retrospective data is a limitation as 
the database was not primarily established for the purpose of an evaluation such as this 
although it was anticipated that it would be used for ongoing quality review.  
Another limitation is the lack of a comparison group. As described earlier, this was seen as 
unfeasible and potentially unhelpful, as the demographic characteristics would likely have 
been difficult to match. Therefore, the analysis is limited to being a single group description. 
 
 
 
Page 23 
  
 
It is impossible to draw conclusions about perinatal mortality, given the small numbers 
involved, although there is no evidence that this increased over the period studied. Data on 
morbidity were not collected and we have to rely on (previously cited) qualitative studies 
identifying women’s experience of care from Albany midwives, since these data were not 
collected routinely by the practice. Nonetheless, the vocal campaigns from women after the 
closure would suggest that many were highly satisfied with the services provided (Edwards 
2011). 
CONCLUSION 
An analysis of retrospective Albany Midwifery Practice statistics over 12.5 years has shown 
positive outcomes for women and babies in socially disadvantaged and BAME groups, 
including those with complex pregnancies and perceived risk factors. This study adds weight 
to a growing body of evidence linking relational midwifery continuity of carer with improved 
outcomes and policies identifying that all pregnant women should receive midwifery 
continuity of carer throughout the continuum of pregnancy, birth and new motherhood.
