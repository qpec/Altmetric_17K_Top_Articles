Abstract
BACKGROUND & AIMS—The combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir has been approved for 
treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, including an 8-week regimen for 
treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis and a baseline level of HCV RNA <6 million IU/mL. 
We analyzed data from a multicenter, prospective, observational study to determine real-world 
sustained virologic responses 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) with regimens containing 
ledipasvir and sofosbuvir and identify factors associated with treatment failure.

 METHODS—We collected data from 2099 participants in the HCV-TARGET study with 
complete virologic data (per-protocol population). We analyzed data from 1788 patients receiving 
ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (282 for 8 weeks, 910 for 12 weeks, 510 for 24 weeks, and 86 for a different 
duration) and 311 receiving ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (212 for 12 weeks and 81 for 24 
weeks, 18 for other duration) to estimate SVR12 (with 95% confidence interval [CI]), and logistic 
regression methods to identify factors that predicted an SVR12.
RESULTS—The overall study population was 25% black, 66% with HCV genotype 1A infection, 
41% with cirrhosis, 50% treatment-experienced, and 30% receiving proton pump inhibitors at start 
of treatment. In the per-protocol population, SVR12s were achieved by 96% of patients receiving 
ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 8 weeks (95% CI, 93%–98%), 97% receiving the drugs for 12 weeks 
(95% CI, 96%–98%), and 95% receiving the drugs for 24 weeks (95% CI, 93%–97%). Among 
patients also receiving ribavirin, SVR12 was achieved by 97% of the patients receiving the drugs 
for 12 weeks (95% CI, 94%–99%) and 95% receiving the drugs for 24 weeks (95% CI, 88%–
99%). Of the 586 patients who qualified for 8 weeks of treatment, only 255 (44%) received the 
drugs for 8 weeks. The rate of SVR12 among those who qualified for and received 8 weeks of 
therapy was similar in those who qualified for 8 weeks but received 12 weeks therapy (96%; 95% 
CI, 92%–99% vs 98%; 95% CI, 95%–99%). Factors that predicted SVR12 were higher albumin 
(≤3.5 g/dL), lower total bilirubin (≥1.2 g/dL), absence of cirrhosis, and absence of proton pump 
inhibitor use.
CONCLUSIONS—Regimens containing ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are highly effective for a 
broad spectrum of patients with HCV genotype 1 infection treated in different clinical practice 
settings. Expanded use of 8-week treatment regimens for eligible patients is supported by these 
real-world results. Modification of proton pump inhibitor use may increase rates of SVR.

Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) was approved for treatment of genotype 1 chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in October 2014. Its approval provided the first “one pill a 
day” regimen for 12 weeks as treatment for chronic HCV. LDV/SOF also provided an 
opportunity to consider 8 vs 12 weeks treatment for patients with favorable clinical and 
virologic characteristics. Specifically, in the ION-3 study, treatment-naïve patients with 
nonadvanced fibrosis (F0-3) and baseline HCV RNA <6 million IU/mL treated for 8 weeks 
were shown in a post-hoc analysis to have SVR12 rates of 97% compared with 96% in 
similar patients treatment for 12 weeks.1
Important gaps in our knowledge about use of LDV/SOF in clinical practice remain. Key 
among these gaps is the “real-life” efficacy of the 8-week regimen, as well as how frequently 
it is being utilized by clinicians, and what factors may be influencing decisions regarding 
use of short vs longer duration therapy and inclusion/exclusion of ribavirin. Indeed, the lack 
of confirmatory data on the efficacy of the 8-week regimen may have contributed to the 
Infectious Diseases Society of American/American Association for the Study of Liver 
Diseases HCV guidance not recommending this regimen.2 Additionally, as the real world of

 patients have a greater array of medical comorbidities, prior treatment exposures, and more 
variable adherence with all oral regimens, the safety and discontinuation rates in clinical 
practice may be predicted to be quite different from the registration trials. Finally, there 
remains a need to determine the baseline and on-treatment factors that may affect the rates 
of virologic failure, in particular those factors that are potentially modifiable.
Ledipasvir, an NS5A inhibitor, requires an acid environment for absorption. In the original 
clinical trials, all patients had to be off proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for at least 4 weeks 
before the start of LDV/SOF therapy. The package insert for LDV/SOF highlights the 
importance of the acid environment and provides specific guidance on dosing of PPIs (and 
other acid-reducing agents) during LDV/SOF therapy. These guidelines were not explicitly 
studied in the registration trials, so real-world data may be helpful in understanding this 
important drug–drug interaction.
In this HCV-TARGET consortium study, we examined the real-world clinical experience 
with LDV/SOF-containing regimens to assess their efficacy (SVR12) and safety in HCV 
genotype 1–infected patients and to determine baseline factors associated with virologic 
failure.
Methods
Study Population and Design
HCV-TARGET is a longitudinal, observational study of chronic hepatitis C patients that 
began in December 2011 and is ongoing. This consortium of academic (n = 44) and 
community (n = 17) centers from North America (n = 57) and Europe (n = 4) is collecting 
data for regimens used in this rapidly changing therapeutic area. Prospective data were 
captured from enrolled patients using a common database that utilized novel, standardized 
source data abstraction as described previously.3,4 All captured data was managed using 
Research Electronic Data Capture, with electronic data capture tools hosted at UNC Chapel 
Hill. Research Electronic Data Capture is a secure, web-based application designed to 
support data capture for research studies.5 A centralized team of trained coders reviews all 
redacted medical records obtained from participating sites for data entry and systematically 
monitors the data entries for completeness and accuracy. All records were screened for 
extreme or unlikely values and verified/resolved with additional queries. The study protocol 
did not define specific populations, regimens, dosing, and duration or safety management.
For this analysis, patients were eligible if they were 18 years or older, infected with HCV 
genotype 1, and treated with LDV/SOF or LDV/SOF plus ribavirin (RBV). The cohort 
sample size was not determined a priori, but rather reflects the need for timely information 
about LDV/SOF safety and efficacy in real-life clinical settings to the larger “treating” 
community.
To be included in this analysis, patients had to have completed LDV/SOF-based treatment 
before January 2016. Patients who discontinued treatment prematurely for any reason were 
excluded to avoid unbiased assignment to a specific treatment duration group and sufficient 
time for post-treatment follow-up. Demographic characteristics, laboratory values (baseline

 and on treatment), and adverse events were collected and analyzed by treatment regimen for 
the evaluable population (n = 2255), which was composed of all patients who completed 
treatment. Treatment efficacy in evaluable population was evaluated among patients with 
available outcomes (n = 2180). Patients lost to post-treatment follow-up were counted as 
nonvirologic treatment failures. The per-protocol population (n = 2099) was composed of 
the patients in the evaluable population who had a virologic outcome. Associations between 
SVR and baseline risk factors are reported for the per-protocol population. The unadjusted 
overall rates of SVR, as well as for subgroups based on treatment history and presence of 
cirrhosis, were calculated for the evaluable and per-protocol populations. Furthermore, the 
unadjusted SVR rates were calculated for the per-protocol population for subgroups of 
interest, particularly based on but not limited to baseline viral load, HCV virus subtype, and 
use of PPI at baseline.
Treatment Regimens
The choice of LDV/SOF was at the discretion of the local treating physician, as was use of 
RBV. Similarly, treatment duration was determined by the treating physician and, for the 
purposes of analysis, was defined as 8 weeks (±7days), 12 weeks (±7days), 24 (±7days), or 
other (not meeting these windows). Patients received the fixed-dose combination of 
LDV/SOF (90/400 mg) once daily. For those receiving RBV, dosing varied across patients 
and treatment centers; however, for most patients, RBV was administered according to body 
weight (<75 kg, 1000 mg daily in 2 divided doses; ≥75 kg, 1200 mg daily in 2 divided 
doses).
Measurements
Demographic, clinical, adverse event, and virologic data were collected at baseline and as 
available every 12 weeks throughout the treatment period and the post-treatment follow-up. 
Laboratory data, collected per standard practice, included levels of serum creatinine, 
albumin, total bilirubin, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, hemoglobin, platelet 
count, and HCV RNA. Concomitant medications were collected from each visit. 
Specifically, in reference to PPI use, the presence of PPI in the concomitant medications list 
at initiation and during HCV therapy was recorded; duration, dose, and frequency also were 
recorded when available. Information on timing of antacid administration in relationship to 
LDV/SOF was not available.
The presence of cirrhosis was defined at the time of enrollment by biopsy and/or a 
combination of clinical, laboratory, elastography, and imaging criteria established a priori.3 
Patients were determined to have cirrhosis if they had evidence of stage 4 fibrosis by liver 
biopsy at any time before therapy; evidence of stage 3 fibrosis by liver biopsy at any time 
before therapy with any of the following criteria: platelet count <140,000 per μL, presence 
of esophageal varices on esophagogastroduodenoscopy, evidence of cirrhosis and/or portal 
hypertension and/or of ascites by imaging studies, FibroSure (or equivalent) test, vibration-
controlled transient elastography, or equivalent compatible with stage 4 fibrosis; or in the 
absence of liver biopsy, any 2 of the following criteria: platelets count <140,000 per μL, 
presence of esophageal varices on esophagogastroduodenoscopy, evidence of cirrhosis 
and/or portal hypertension and/or ascites by imaging studies, Fibro-Sure or equivalent test,

 vibration-controlled transient elastography, or equivalent compatible with stage 4 fibrosis. 
History of hepatic decompensation was defined as evidence of prior or current diagnosis of 
ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or variceal hemorrhage, or 
baseline concomitant medications with a specific use listed for these indications.
Adverse events (AE), defined as any new symptom or event recorded in the medical record 
that occurred during the HCV treatment period, were collected and reported regardless of the 
need or lack thereof for a prescription medication or a dose reduction or discontinuation of 
HCV treatment. AEs recorded in the patient clinical note were identified by HCV-TARGET 
data abstractors and then entered into the database as text and further coded by the clinically 
validated international medical terminology dictionary, MedDRA (the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities). Serious AEs were defined as any AE that required hospitalization 
or met criteria for expedited reporting per FDA form MEDWATCH 3500.
Primary Study Outcomes
The efficacy end point was SVR defined as a plasma HCV RNA level below quantitation or 
undetectable at least 64 days after treatment completion (SVR12). For patients who did not 
achieve SVR12, the frequency of relapse, virologic breakthrough, and virologic nonresponse 
were reported, as were patients lost to follow-up evaluation. The safety end points included 
common LDV/SOF AEs, including fatigue, headache, and nausea; anemia AEs; cardiac 
events, need for ribavirin dose reductions or discontinuation; and any serious AEs, 
hepatobiliary serious AEs, and death.
Analytic Approach
Demographic characteristics, laboratory values, and AEs were collected and analyzed by 
treatment regimen for the evaluable population.
The unadjusted rates of SVR were calculated for the LDV/SOF and LDV/SOF-RBV per-
protocol population and evaluable population, as well as for subgroups of interest, 
particularly based on treatment history (treatment-experienced, treatment-naïve), the 
presence of cirrhosis (yes, no). For subgroups of interest based on baseline HCV RNA (<6, 
≥6 million IU/mL), history of liver transplantation (yes, no), history of hepatic 
decompensation event status (decompensated, non-decompensated), history of taking PPIs at 
baseline (no, yes), and duration of treatment (8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks) unadjusted SVR 
rates are presented for the LDV/SOF and LDV/SOF-RBV per-protocol population only. 
Confidence intervals (CIs) of unadjusted rates were calculated using exact binomial 
methods.
Multivariable analyses (age- and sex-adjusted) of SVR were performed for the LDV/SOF 
per-protocol population and associations between every baseline covariate and SVR 
outcome were estimated with logistic regression using Firth penalized maximum likelihood 
estimation of the effect of a covariate of interest with adjustment for age and sex.6 The set of 
covariates was selected a priori based on a consensus of clinical expertise and included the 
most well-established baseline covariates associated with SVR: sex, age, HCV genotype 
subtype (a or b), albumin (<3.5 g/dL, ≥3.5 g/dL), platelet count (1000/uL), total bilirubin 
(≤1.2 mg/dL, ≥1.2mg/dl), hemoglobin (g/dL), baseline HCV RNA (<6, ≥6 million IU/mL),

 cirrhosis status, a history of antiviral treatment, history of hepatic decompensation, body 
mass index (kg/m2), and baseline PPI use (yes, no). Subsequently, additional variables of 
PPI use were evaluated including any PPI use (yes, no), daily omeprazole dose equivalent 
(≤20 mg, >20 mg), PPI dose frequency (once, twice daily) and fraction of treatment time on 
PPI.
Auxiliary sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the primary 
results (ie, effects of multiple predictors on SVR) to reasonable perturbations of the 
statistical methods and assumptions used. Specifically, 2 alternative models were considered 
and their results were compared with the primary results. First, we tested whether a possible 
selection bias in our observational study influenced our main results. Selection bias was 
addressed through applying inverse probability weighting approach, allowing for the 
creation of pseudorandomization.7 In this approach, a weight is calculated for each 
individual such that all prespecified predictors of PPI use become balanced in groups with 
and without PPI use. All risk factors used in the model are presented in the Supplementary 
Figure 4. Finally, the effect of PPI use is estimated for pseudorandomized groups, that is, 
with logistic regression using the individual weights. Second, the Lasso penalized 
generalized linear model was used to identify a set of smaller number of baseline covariates 
(among the ones used in the inverse probability weighting model), thus providing optimal 
multivariable generalized linear model for not achieving SVR.7 The Lasso penalized 
estimation produced a parsimonious model with 6 baseline covariables: total bilirubin, 
albumin, history of previous treatment, sex, PPI use, and HCV genotype subtype, excluding 
all other prespecified covariates listed here. Multiple imputation was used to address missing 
values in baseline variables of interest in these sensitivity analyses. Analyses were 
performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Informed Consent
The protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines. The independent ethics committee at each participating study 
center or a central Institutional Review Board approved the protocol if a local Institutional 
Review Board was not in place. All patients provided written informed consent for their 
participation. All authors had complete access to the study data, and reviewed and approved 
the final manuscript.
Results
Before January 2016, a total of 2356 patients ended treatment with a LDV/SOF-containing 
regimen; 2289 patients completed treatment, and 67 (2.8%) discontinued therapy early. 
Thirty-four patients who completed treatment had insufficient follow-up time to assess for 
SVR12 (Supplementary Figure 1), resulting in 2255 patients in the evaluable population. 
Due to variability of standard follow-up practice at the sites, 75 of the 2255 patients were 
still in post-treatment follow-up at the time of reporting, and 81 were lost to follow-up, 
resulting in a final efficacy cohort of 2099 patients (per-protocol population).
The vast majority (86%) of the evaluable population received treatment with LDV/SOF 
alone (1927 of 2255), with only 328 of 2255 (14%) receiving LDV/SOF-RBV

 (Supplementary Figure 1). Actual treatment duration among the LDV/SOF-treated patients 
was 8 weeks in 305 of 1927 (16%), 12 weeks in 971 of 1927 (50%), 24 weeks in 552 of 
1927 (29%), and other in 99 of 1927 (5%). Among 328 patients treated with LDV/SOF-
RBV, the actual duration of therapy was 8 weeks in 2 of 328 (<1%), 12 weeks in 222 of 328 
(68%), 24 weeks in 85 of 328 (26%), and other in 19 of 328 (6%) (Supplementary Tables 1 
and 2).
Of the evaluable population, 60% were male, median age was 60 years, 24% were aged 65 
years or older, and 25% were black race. The majority of the cohort was infected with 
genotype 1A (66%), with a median HCV viral load of 6.2 log10 IU/mL and 85% with HCV 
viral load <6 million IU/mL. A total of 41% of patients had cirrhosis, 50% treatment-
experienced including 14% direct-acting antiviral treatment-experienced, 18% with a history 
of hepatic decompensation, and 13% had received a prior liver transplantation (Table 1). 
Compared with patients receiving LDV/SOF, patients receiving RBV with LDV/SOF were 
more frequently treatment-experienced (67% vs 47%) and cirrhotic (58% vs 38%), had 
lower baseline platelet counts (median 133 vs 176 × 103/μL), history of hepatic 
decompensation (29% vs 17%), or a prior liver transplantation (48% vs 7%) (Table 1). 
Human immunodeficiency virus co-infection was infrequent in the cohort (4%). PPI at 
baseline was reported in 30% of patients, observed slightly more frequently in patients 
treated with LDV/SOF-RBV (37% vs 29%). Among LDV/SOF PPI users (n = 550), 506 of 
550 (92%) were taking the PPI at baseline and the PPI duration and baseline dose were 
available in 81% (444 of 550) and 80% (440 of 550), respectively. Among these PPI users, 
41% (182 of 440) were on an omeprazole dose equivalent to >20 mg/d and 89% (396 of 
444) were on their PPI during the whole treatment time (Table 1).
Patient characteristics by treatment duration varied. Among LDV/SOF-treated patients 
(Supplementary Table 1), the 24-week vs 12-week treatment group was more frequently 
treatment-experienced (90% vs 36%), cirrhotic (76% vs 27%), and with history of hepatic 
decompensation event (34% vs 11%). The 8-week treatment arm was 96% treatment-naïve, 
99% without cirrhosis, and 96% with viral load <6 million IU/mL). Among LDV/SOF-
RBV–treated patients (Supplementary Table 2), the 24- vs 12-week treatment group was 
more frequently treatment-experienced (91% vs 59%), cirrhotic (74% vs 52%), and with a 
history of hepatic decompensation event (48% vs 22%).
Efficacy Outcomes
Of the 2255 patients forming the evaluable population, 2180 had treatment outcomes 
available, and the overall SVR12 rate was 93% (Supplementary Table 3). In the per-protocol, 
the SVR12 rate was 96% (95% CI, 95%–97%) among 1788 treated with LDV/SOF and 97% 
(95% CI, 94%–99%) among 311 treated with LDV/SOF plus RBV. In the LDV/SOF group, 
the SVR12 rates were 96% (95% CI, 93%–98%) in those treated for 8 weeks (271 of 282), 
97% (95% CI, 96%–98%) in patients treated for 12 weeks (881 of 910) and 95% (95% CI, 
93%–97%) in those treated for 24 weeks (486 of 510). In the LDV/SOF-RBV group, the 
SVR12 rates were 97% (95% CI, 94%–99%) in those treated for 12 weeks (206 of 212) and 
95% (95% CI, 88%–99%) in those treated for 24 weeks (77 of 81) (Figure 1). The majority 
of the treatment failures were due to relapse. A total of 6 patients never achieved an HCV

 RNA below limits of quantitation and 1 patient experienced a viral breakthrough 
(Supplementary Table 3). Of patients receiving LDV/SOF plus RBV, 39% had an RBV dose 
reduction and 9% RBV discontinued. The SVR rates in those with no change, reduction, and 
discontinuation of RBV were 95.7%, 98.4%, and 96.3% (data not shown).
A total of 586 patients were treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic, and had a baseline HCV RNA 
<6 million IU/mL and thus qualified for treatment with LDV/SOF for 8 weeks. Among the 
patients possibly eligible to receive 8 weeks of therapy, only 255 (44%) received 8 weeks 
therapy, while 296 (51%) were treated for 12 weeks, 10 patients (2%) were treated for 24 
weeks, and 25 (4%) patients received treatment with nonstandard treatment duration. 
Physicians’ rationale for prescribing 12 vs 8 weeks of therapy was not collected. Among the 
subgroup that qualified for 8 weeks of treatment, the SVR12 rate was 96% (95% CI, 94%–
99%) in the group who received 8 weeks (244 of 255) and 98% (95% CI, 95%–99%) in the 
group who received 12 weeks (289 of 296). We examined the relationship between week-4 
HCV-RNA results (early virologic response) and duration of therapy. Among 255 patients 
who qualified for 8 weeks of treatment and received 8 weeks, 158 had week-4 HCV-RNA 
available; 5% of these patients (n = 12) had a quantifiable HCV-RNA result. Among the 296 
patients who qualified for 8 weeks treatment and received 12 weeks, 189 had week 4 HCV-
RNA available: 9% of these patients (n = 25) had quantifiable HCV-RNA at week 4. This 
suggests that the HCV-RNA results at week 4 were unlikely to be driving decision-making 
about use of 12 weeks of therapy in patients who qualified for 8 weeks. Of note, a 
quantifiable HCV-RNA result at week 4 was not predictive of relapse in either the 8-week or 
12-week group, as only 1 patient (treated for 12 weeks) who still had quantifiable week-4 
HCV-RNA relapsed. Two patients (1 treated for 8 weeks and 1 treated with 12-week 
regimen) were nonresponders. Twenty-three patients were treated for 8 weeks who did not 
meet acceptable criteria for shorter duration therapy; all 23 patients achieved SVR.
Among those treated with LDV/SOF, the SVR12 rates varied by presence of cirrhosis, 
subgenotype, prior transplantation, history of hepatic decompensation, and baseline PPI use 
(Figure 2). Crude SVR rates, in per-protocol population, were lowest (<95%) among those 
with cirrhosis (94%; 95% CI, 91%–95%), prior liver transplantation (94%; 95% CI, 89%–
98%), history of hepatic decompensation (90%; 95% CI, 86%–93%), and PPI use (94%; 
95% CI, 91%–96%). In age- and sex-adjusted multiple logistic models, the factors 
significantly associated with SVR were albumin –3.5 g/dL (odds ratio [OR], 4.7, 95% CI, 
2.79–7.90), total bilirubin –1.2 g/dL (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.20–6.15), absence of cirrhosis 
(OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.81–4.99), no-decompensated liver disease (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.52–
6.77), and PPI use (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25–0.67) (Figure 3).
Because baseline PPI use was likely not random, we addressed this potential bias by 
applying inverse probability weighting to create a “pseudo randomized population” in which 
other baseline predictors of SVR were balanced among the 2 groups. In this analysis, 
restricted to patients treated with LDV/SOF, use of PPI was associated with an 
approximately 2-fold lower odds of achieving SVR compared with those with no use of PPI 
(OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.67) (Supplementary Figure 3). In a second subanalysis to 
address the association between of PPI and SVR, multiple Lasso regression was used to 
identify the most significant predictors of SVR12. The final multiple logistic model

 identified a combination of 3 baseline factors significantly associated with SVR12: nonuse 
of PPI (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.03), higher albumin level (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.61 to 
3.66), and lower bilirubin level (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58 to −0.89) (Supplementary Figure 
4). The crude SVR rates in the per protocol population of those treated with LDV/SOF plus 
RBV varied from 92.5% to 100% among different subgroups (Supplementary Figure 2).
Safety Outcomes
Of the 2356 patients who ended treatment, 2.8% (n = 67) discontinued treatment early, with 
similar frequency of treatment discontinuation in those taking RBV and those not (1% [n = 4 
of 337] and 3% [n = 63 of 2019], respectively). There were 13 deaths; 12 were in patients 
with cirrhosis, 7 had decompensated cirrhosis at baseline. The 1 death in the LDV/SOF-
RBV was related to a traffic accident. The causes of deaths in the LDV/SOF group were 
attributed to acute respiratory failure, metastatic breast cancer, coronary artery disease, 
cerebral hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, multi-organ failure, sepsis, septic shock, 
narcotic overdose, and a traffic accident. Two patients died of unknown causes. Adverse 
events were reported in 63% of patients in the evaluable population on LDV/SOF and 85% 
of LDV/SOF-RBV, with higher frequencies of fatigue and anemia in the group receiving 
RBV (Table 2). There were 3 patients with reported bradyarrhythmias: 2 with bradycardia 
and 1 with sick sinus syndrome. There were no reported cases of lactic acidosis, but there 
was 1 case of increased blood lactic dehydrogenase.
In the evaluable population, serious AEs were reported in 5% in those receiving LDV/SOF 
and in 9% in those receiving LDV/SOF-RBV. Most serious AEs occurred among patients 
with cirrhosis at baseline.
Discussion
The FDA approval of LDV/SOF in October 2014 signaled yet another advance in the 
treatment of HCV infection, with a safe and simple regimen that achieved high rates of SVR 
in persons infected with genotype 1. The phase 3 studies leading to the approval of this 
fixed-dose combination therapy reported SVR12 rates with 12 weeks treatment of 95% 
(95% CI, 92%–98%) in treatment-naïve1 and 94% (95% CI, 91%–99%) in treatment-
experienced7 genotype 1 patients.8 As clinical trials generally select for patients with fewer 
comorbidities and high adherence rates and are conducted by experienced investigators, the 
question of whether these high rates of SVR would be achieved in “real world” settings 
comes to the fore. Our results, reflecting an unselected patient population treated in a variety 
of treatment settings, both academic and community, indicates that SVR rates with this 
simple regimen appear to be as high as those seen in the clinical trials, with SVR12 rates of 
96% (95% CI, 95%–97%) in patients treated with LDV/SOF with or without RBV. 
Moreover, treatment discontinuation was extremely low at 2.8%, attesting to the much 
improved tolerability and convenience of this regimen.
An important finding emerging from this HCV-TARGET cohort study was the high efficacy 
of the 8 weeks LDV/ SOF regimen, with an overall SVR rate of 96% (95% CI, 93%–98%). 
This is comparable with that achieved in the prior clinical trial, in which overall SVR in 
noncirrhotic patients was 94% (95% CI, 90%–97%) with 8 weeks of LDV/SOF.1 Based on a

 post-hoc analysis, the rates of relapse were shown to be lowest for those treated with 8 
weeks that had pretreatment HCV RNA level <6 million IU/mL. This led to the approved 
indication for LDV/SOF for 8 weeks being noncirrhotic, genotype 1 patients who were 
treatment-naïve and with a baseline HCV RNA level of <6 million/mL. In that subgroup, the 
SVR12 rate with 8 weeks treatment was 97%, a result similar to that achieved in our study. 
This supports the use of 8 weeks of therapy in this group of patients and represents a 
substantial cost savings compared with 12 weeks of therapy.
What is clear from our study is that the 8-week regimen is underutilized, with only 44% of 
those who meet eligibility for 8-week duration therapy actually receiving it, and a substantial 
proportion of patents being overtreated and receiving a longer treatment course. The reasons 
for the underutilization of 8 weeks of therapy in eligible patients are not clear, but may 
reflect provider confidence in the registration data. Alternatively, because many clinicians 
come from an era of using on-treatment virologic responses to guide treatment, we 
hypothesized that clinicians might be using HCV RNA results at week 4 to guide their 
decisions on treatment. However, our data do not support this hypothesis. It is hoped that 
with the additional data from our study and those of other real-life cohorts, clinicians will 
see the benefit of short-course therapy for their noncirrhotic treatment-naïve patients. The 
use of the “6 million IU/mL” cutoff for determining eligibility for shorter duration therapy 
have been called into question,9 as the post-hoc analysis used to generate this cutoff was 
likely underpowered to adjust for all the factors contributing to SVR12. Despite this, our 
results suggest that this cutoff can be used in decision-making and will yield high SVR rates 
in appropriately selected patients. Given the high SVR rate seen, the question to be answered 
by future analyses of combined larger data sets, is whether a higher cutoff, allowing more 
patients to be treated for 8 weeks, may be used and still achieve high SVR rates. In our 
study, only 13 (5%) patients receiving the 8-week regimen had an HCV viral load >6 million 
IU/mL, thus not allowing us to examine whether higher viral load cutoffs might be 
considered.
Another unexpected but important finding of our study was the significant impact of PPI use 
on SVR rates. Ledipasvir’s solubility decreases as pH increases and, consequently, acid-
reducing agents can affect drug absorption and drug levels. Thus, for patients on a PPI, it is 
recommended that the dose not be higher than omeprazole 20 mg daily (or equivalent) and 
taken fasting at the same time as LDV/ SOF.10 Whether patients are aware of this 
requirement and are able to follow these requirements is unknown. PPI use was frequent in 
HCV-TARGET with approximately 1 in 4 patients on a PPI at initiation of HCV therapy and 
those on PPIs had approximately 2-fold lower odds of SVR than those who were not. 
Additionally, a dose equivalent higher than omeprazole 20 mg daily and twice daily dosing 
of PPI therapy were associated with lower odds of SVR. This translates into an absolute 
difference in SVR between those on and off PPIs of 4% and although this may be viewed as 
a modest difference in SVR, it is an important observation because it represents one of a few 
modifiable factors associated with SVR. At a minimum, providers should ensure patients are 
educated on the importance of the appropriate doses of PPI and take the PPI as 
recommended to minimize any impact on LDV absorption. Additionally, providers should 
consider whether PPI therapy is essential for a given patient and withdraw PPI use in the 
absence of an indication. Of note, the reason for PPI use was not captured in this study and

 patients with strong indications for use, such as patients with recent gastrointestinal 
bleeding, may be included.
Patients with cirrhosis, especially those with decompensated cirrhosis, have lower rates of 
SVR with currently available all oral combination therapies. In the clinical trials of 
LDV/SOF with and without RBV in compensated cirrhotics, SVR12 was achieved in 95% of 
treatment-naïve patients receiving 12 weeks of therapy and 98% in patients receiving 24 
weeks, but with previously treated patients with cirrhosis, the addition of RBV was needed 
to achieve SVR >90%.11,12 In our analysis, the per-protocol SVR rate in the SOF/LDV with/
without RBV (all treatment lengths) was 94%–97% in cirrhotics vs 97%–98% in 
noncirrhotics, and those with decompensated cirrhosis was 90%–97%. Within the patients 
with cirrhosis, the SVR rate in the LDV/SOF with and without RBV in patients treated for 
12 weeks was 97% and 93%, respectively, and those treated for 24 weeks had SVR rates of 
95% and 94%, respectively (not shown). These results again suggest that “real-life” results 
with LDV/ SOF in cirrhotic patients are comparable with those achieved in prior clinical 
trials.
As highlighted by the very low rate of early treatment discontinuation, side effects are rarely 
treatment-limiting. Adverse events are reported in the majority of patients, and with higher 
frequency in patients receiving RBV as part of the regimen. The well-known side effect of 
anemia and associated symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea, were among the most 
frequently cited side effects. Quality of life measures were not captured in this observational 
cohort study, but prior studies have highlighted the negative impact of RBV on physical and 
psychosocial functioning. Thus, there remains a strong desire on the part of clinicians to 
eliminate the need for RBV. Although this has been achieved for most HCV-infected 
populations, those with cirrhosis, especially those treatment-experienced or with a history of 
hepatic decompensation, as well as transplant recipients, are typically groups needing RBV 
to achieve the highest SVR rates. Of course, these same groups are the patients often less 
able to tolerate RBV due to concurrent hypersplenism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal 
dysfunction. Thus, identifying new combinations, aimed at targeting 3 or more enzymatic 
targets, may provide sufficient efficacy to displace RBV from future regimens.
In this large observational study, we have shown that LDV/SOF is highly effective in a wide 
spectrum of patients and treatment settings. SVR rates parallel those achieved in clinical 
trials, demonstrating how effectively this regimen has translated in clinical practice. 
However, continued efforts to optimize the use of HCV therapies are needed. The 8-week 
regimen achieved excellent SVR rates but was underutilized, and clinicians are encouraged 
to use the shorter treatment course in appropriate patients—those who are treatment-naïve, 
noncirrhotic, and with HCV viral load <6 million IU/mL. Clinicians should be attentive to 
the use of PPIs, as this represents a potentially modifiable factor that is associated with 
reduced SVR rates.
