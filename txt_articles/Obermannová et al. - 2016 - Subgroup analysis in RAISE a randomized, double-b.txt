Background: The RAISE phase III clinical trial demonstrated that ramucirumab + FOLFIRI improved overall survival (OS)
[hazard ratio (HR) = 0.844, P = 0.0219] and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.793, P < 0.0005) compared with
placebo + FOLFIRI for second-line metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients previously treated with first-line bev-
acizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine. Since some patient or disease characteristics could be associated with dif-
ferential efficacy or safety, prespecified subgroup analyses were undertaken. This report focuses on three of the most
relevant ones: KRAS status (wild-type versus mutant), age (<65 versus ≥65 years), and time to progression (TTP) on first-
line therapy (<6 versus ≥6 months).
Patients and methods: OS and PFS were evaluated by the Kaplan–Meier analysis, with HR determined by the Cox
proportional hazards model. Treatment-by-subgroup interaction was tested to determine whether treatment effect was
consistent between subgroup pairs.
Results: Patients with both wild-type and mutant KRAS benefited from ramucirumab + FOLFIRI treatment over placebo
+ FOLFIRI (interaction P = 0.526); although numerically, wild-type KRAS patients benefited more (wild-type KRAS:
median OS = 14.4 versus 11.9 months, HR = 0.82, P = 0.049; mutant KRAS: median OS = 12.7 versus 11.3 months,
HR = 0.89, P = 0.263). Patients with both longer and shorter first-line TTP benefited from ramucirumab (interaction
P = 0.9434), although TTP <6 months was associated with poorer OS (TTP ≥6 months: median OS = 14.3 versus 12.5
months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.061; TTP <6 months: median OS = 10.4 versus 8.0 months, HR = 0.86, P = 0.276). The sub-
groups of patients ≥65 versus <65 years also derived a similar ramucirumab survival benefit (interaction P = 0.9521) (≥65
years: median OS = 13.8 versus 11.7 months, HR = 0.85, P = 0.156; <65 years: median OS = 13.1 versus 11.9 months,
HR = 0.86, P = 0.098). The safety profile of ramucirumab + FOLFIRI was similar across subgroups.

 Conclusions: These analyses revealed similar efficacy and safety among patient subgroups with differing KRAS muta-
tion status, longer or shorter first-line TTP, and age. Ramucirumab is a beneficial addition to second-line FOLFIRI treat-
ment for a wide range of patients with mCRC.

introduction
Metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) develops in approxi-
mately half of patients diagnosed with the disease [1]. The poor
prognosis and 5-year survival rate (13.5%) of patients with
mCRC drives ongoing efforts to find treatments that slow its
progression [2].
Adding anti-angiogenic agents to chemotherapy to improve
outcomes has become standard of care for treatment of mCRC
[1, 3]. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is a key
stimulator of capillary growth [4]. Evidence suggests that
VEGF-A interaction with VEGF Receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) is an
important mediator of vascular growth in tumors [5, 6]. Some
anti-angiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, bind to circulating
VEGF molecules, eliminating their ability to bind to VEGF
receptors, thus blocking their mitogenic effects. Preventing
growth factor–receptor interaction by blocking the binding site
on the VEGF-R is a different strategy to disrupt the VEGF
angiogenic pathway.
Ramucirumab (IMC-1121B, Eli Lilly and Company) is a fully
human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the VEGFR-2
extracellular domain with high affinity (Kd 50 pM), preventing
binding of all VEGF ligands and ensuing receptor activation [7].
The RAISE trial showed that second-line ramucirumab in com-
bination
with
irinotecan,
folinic acid,
and
5-fluorouracil
(FOLFIRI) improved survival in patients with mCRC following
progression during or after first-line combination therapy with
bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine [8]. Overall
survival (OS) for the ramucirumab + FOLFIRI arm was 13.3
months compared with 11.7 months in the placebo + FOLFIRI
arm [hazard ratio, HR = 0.844, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.730–0.976, P = 0.0219]. Likewise, progression-free survival
(PFS) was extended in the ramucirumab + FOLFIRI arm over
the placebo + FOLFIRI arm (HR 0.793, 95% CI 0.697–0.903,
P < 0.0005) [8].
A consistent OS and PFS benefit for ramucirumab + FOLFIRI
was observed across prespecified subgroups in the RAISE
trial. The subgroups had been chosen to reflect stratification
factors, regulatory requirements, and known prognostic and
disease factors. Some tumor or patient characteristics are known
to be associated with differential efficacy or safety among sub-
groups of patients with mCRC. For example, patients with acti-
vating KRAS mutations (exon 2) are resistant to anti-EGFR
therapy, whereas patients with no activating KRAS mutations
may benefit from that type of treatment [9]. Advanced age has
been associated with more pronounced or frequent safety con-
cerns; as a result, the risk–benefit balance of cancer treatments
in the elderly population has been under scrutiny [10]. In some
cases, patients with more and less aggressive disease, as assessed
by time to progression (TTP) on first-line therapy, could have
differential responsiveness to second-line therapy [11].
Given the importance of identifying patients who are most
likely to benefit from ramucirumab treatment of mCRC, the
prespecified data analyses presented here further examine these
three key subgroup pairings: KRAS mutation status (mutant,
wild type), age (<65 years and ≥65 years old), and TTP after
start on first-line therapy (<6 and ≥6 months). The objective
was to determine whether any of these three characteristics was
associated with a differential outcome to ramucirumab’s anti-
VEGF pathway effects.
methods
study design
The study design and conduct of the global, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled phase III RAISE trial was previously reported [8] and is
summarized in the supplementary material, available at Annals of Oncology
online.
statistical analyses
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the median PFS and OS of
each arm in RAISE patient KRAS, age, and TTP subgroups. For each sub-
group, HRs and 95% CIs were calculated by unstratified Cox proportional
hazards model, and the log-rank test was used to compare the survival distri-
butions between the two arms. To determine whether the treatment effect
was consistent between subgroup pairs, a treatment-by-subgroup interaction
P-value was calculated based on Wald test in unstratified Cox proportional
hazards model. A multivariate Cox regression analysis of OS time was used
to assess the treatment effect after adjusting important prognostic factors.
Safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of any
study drug. Subgroup analyses of safety data were carried out for treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs), overall, and by maximum CTCAE grade.
Statistical tests and CIs used a two-sided 0.05 α-level, whereas tests of inter-
actions used two-sided 0.10. SAS (version 9.1.2 or higher) software was used
for all statistical analyses.
results
The RAISE phase III clinical trial enrolled 1072 patients, with
536 patients in each arm: ramucirumab + FOLFIRI arm and
placebo + FOLFIRI (intent-to-treat, ITT population). Among
these patients, 529 in the ramucirumab + FOLFIRI arm and 528
in the placebo + FOLFIRI arm received ≥1 dose of treatment
and comprised the safety population. At the time of primary
analysis, there were 769 patient deaths, with a censoring rate of
31.6% for ramucirumab + FOLFIRI and 25.9% for placebo +
FOLFIRI. In the trial population, baseline demographic, disease,
and pre-treatment characteristics were balanced across treat-
ment arms [8]. Among all study patients, 83% had ≥3 months
of first-line bevacizumab.
Approximately half of the patients had KRAS exon 2 mutant
(n = 542) and wild-type (n = 530) tumors, respectively. Within

 each KRAS subgroup, baseline patient and tumor characteristics
were
balanced
between
treatment
groups
(supplementary
Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). Patients were
also divided into subgroups of those with more or less aggressive
disease, as defined by those progressing on first-line therapy in
<6 months (n = 254) versus ≥6 months (n = 818), respectively.
Within these TTP subgroups, baseline patient and tumor char-
acteristics were balanced between treatment groups (supplemen-
tary Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online). Likewise,
age subgroups, <65 years (n = 645) and ≥65 years (n = 427),
exhibited a balanced distribution of patient and tumor charac-
teristics between treatment arms (supplementary Table S3,
available at Annals of Oncology online).
Although the study was not powered for subgroup analysis,
there was a consistent positive ramucirumab treatment effect in
all subgroups analyzed, including those defined by KRAS muta-
tion status (Figure 1). Second-line treatment with ramucirumab
+ FOLFIRI significantly improved OS in patients with wild-type
KRAS (HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–1.00, P = 0.049) (Figure 2A).
The median OS for that patient population was 14.4 months for
the ramucirumab + FOLFIRI arm versus 11.9 months for the
placebo + FOLFIRI arm. PFS was also significantly improved
(HR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.65–0.92, P = 0.004) (Figure 2C). Patients
with mutant KRAS exhibited a directional improvement in OS
(HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.73–1.09, P = 0.263); the median OS was
12.7 months for the ramucirumab + FOLFIRI arm versus 11.3
months for the placebo + FOLFIRI arm. PFS also displayed dir-
ectional improvement (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.70–1.00, P = 0.056)
(Figure 2B and D). For both efficacy end points, there was no
significant interaction between treatment and KRAS subgroups
(interaction P = 0.505 for OS and 0.526 for PFS) (Figure 1), sug-
gesting that ramucirumab can benefit patients regardless of
KRAS mutation status. Efficacy data for this subgroup and
others are summarized (supplementary Table S4, available at
Annals of Oncology online).
To determine whether anti-EGFR post-discontinuation
therapy influenced the magnitude of OS and PFS for the wild-
type KRAS patients, we reviewed post-discontinuation therapy
data. All post-discontinuation treatments were well balanced
between arms. Anti-EGFR therapy was administered to 27.1%
of all patients after progression on ramucirumab + FOLFIRI
or placebo + FOLFIRI. Almost all of these patients were KRAS
wild-type (95.5%). Examining just the wild-type KRAS popu-
lation, patients receiving post-discontinuation anti-EGFR
therapy were evenly distributed between arms [ramucirumab:
132 patients (49.4%) and placebo: 145 patients (52.7%)].
Thus, the improvement in OS and PFS in the KRAS wild-type
patients is unlikely to be related to post-discontinuation anti-

 EGFR therapy since that variable was well balanced between
arms.
Patient subgroups based on first-line TTP also exhibited a
treatment effect in favor of the ramucirumab arm for both effi-
cacy end points. Patients who had progressed in ≥6 months
showed directional survival improvement (HR = 0.86, 95% CI
0.73–1.01, P = 0.061), with a median OS of 14.3 months for the
ramucirumab + FOLFIRI arm versus 12.5 months for the
placebo + FOLFIRI arm, and significant improvement in PFS
(HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.96, P = 0.013) (Figure 3A and C).
Treatment with ramucirumab also led to better efficacy outcomes
among the 24% (254/1078) of patients who progressed on first-
line therapy in <6 months: median OS = 10.4 versus 8.0 months,
HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.64–1.13, P = 0.2759; PFS HR = 0.68, 95% CI
0.52–0.89, P = 0.0042 (Figure 3B and D). There was no inter-
action between first-line TTP status and treatment effect for
either efficacy end point (OS interaction P = 0.9434; PFS inter-
action P = 0.1142) (Figure 1), showing that ramucirumab benefits
patients who progress both more and less rapidly on first-line
therapy. However, first-line TTP (<6 versus ≥6 months) was
found to be a prognostic factor for second-line mCRC patients:
HR = 1.55 (95% CI 1.31–1.84, Wald’s P < 0.0001).
Both age subgroups also benefited from treatment with ramu-
cirumab. In the ≥65 years subgroup, there was directional im-
provement in both OS (HR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.68–1.07, P = 0.156)
and PFS (HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.67–1.00, P = 0.051) (Figure 4A
and C), with a median OS of 13.8 versus 11.7 months. The <65
years
subgroup
displayed
similar
improvement
in
OS
(HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.72–1.03, P = 0.098), with a median OS of
13.1 versus 11.9 months (Figure 4B). PFS was significantly
improved in the ramucirumab-treated arm (HR = 0.77, 95% CI
0.66–0.92, P = 0.0027) (Figure 4D). The treatment effect was not
statistically different between patients younger and older than 65
years, demonstrated by the lack of treatment-by-subgroup inter-
action (Figure 1), thus ramucirumab can positively affect efficacy
for both older and younger patients.
The incidence of ‘all grade’ and grade ≥3 TEAEs in the sub-
groups was relatively consistent across patient KRAS mutation
and first-line TTP subgroups (supplementary Table S5, available
at Annals of Oncology online). TEAEs that occurred more fre-
quently among patients treated with ramucirumab + FOLFIRI
(neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis, epistaxis, hyperten-
sion) were elevated to a similar extent in both paired subgroups.
Special interest TEAEs (those associated with anti-VEGF ther-
apies) showed an equivalent incidence across KRAS and first-
line TTP subgroups (supplementary Table S6, available at
Annals of Oncology online).
Because age can be associated with a higher incidence of
TEAEs for some treatments, we also examined subgroups with
65 and 75 years as the cut-off (Table 1). For many TEAEs, older
patients had a similar incidence as younger patients. For those
TEAEs that occur more frequently with age (e.g. decreased
appetite and fatigue), the increased incidence was of similar
magnitude in both the ramucirumab + FOLFIRI and placebo +

 FOLFIRI arms. Examination of the TEAEs associated with anti-
VEGF therapies found they were not elevated in either the ≥65
or ≥75 subgroup of patients (supplementary Table S7, available
at Annals of Oncology online).
As previously reported [8], ramucirumab dose adjustments
(reductions, omissions, delays) and discontinuations showed
some greater incidence in the ramucirumab treatment arm;
however, there was no difference in incidence within KRAS,
TTP, or age subgroups (data not shown).
discussion
The inherent heterogeneity of mCRC complicates identifying
patients more likely to benefit from treatment. Predicting
patients more likely to benefit from the addition of ramuciru-
mab to FOLFIRI second-line therapy would be useful to balance
its potential benefit with possible increased toxicities, in add-
ition to quality-of-life and economic considerations. This report
focused on the KRAS, first-line TTP, and age subgroups in the
RAISE population since they are important as prognostic or pre-
dictive factors and may affect safety.
KRAS status had been shown to impact anti-EGFR treatment
[9], thus prompting the question whether it also affected the effi-
cacy of anti-angiogenic treatments. Our examination of the
VEGFR2 antibody ramucirumab showed that patients with both
mutant and wild-type KRAS derived benefit from ramucirumab +
FOLFIRI treatment (interaction P = 0.526), although numerically,
wild-type KRAS patients benefited more (mutant KRAS: median
OS = 12.7 versus 11.3 months, HR = 0.89, P = 0.263; wild-type
KRAS:
median
OS = 14.4
versus
11.9
months,
HR = 0.82,
P = 0.049). Likewise, KRAS status did not change the effect of
second-line bevacizumab on OS in the TML trial (interaction
P = 0.1266) [12]. However, patients with KRAS mutations in the
TML trial did seem to derive less benefit from the bevacizumab–
chemotherapy combination versus chemotherapy alone (median
OS = 10.4 versus 10.0 months, HR = 0.92, P = 0.4969) than
patients with wild-type KRAS (median OS = 15.4 versus 11.1
months, HR = 0.69, P = 0.0052) [12]. As in the RAISE study, this
result may have been impacted by the study not having been
powered to detect differences in subgroups. Whether KRAS status
impacts the treatment effect of second-line aflibercept + FOLFIRI
on the OS of the VELOUR mCRC patients has not been reported
to date.
Other gene mutations have also been identified as impacting
treatment of advanced CRC. BRAF mutation and extended
RAS mutations other than KRAS exon 2 have also been found
to reduce benefit from anti-EGFR therapies [13]. Post hoc ana-
lyses are being undertaken to characterize extended RAS and
BRAF mutations in RAISE patient tumor samples to verify that
these other mutations do not interfere with ramucirumab
benefit.
Before this study, there was some indication that TTP <6
months after beginning first-line treatment may be a negative
prognostic factor among patients undergoing irinotecan-based
second-line therapy [11]. The RAISE study stratified patients by
first-line TTP <6 versus ≥6 months and then examined the data

 following the study to determine whether TTP on first-line
therapy was prognostic for OS. The median OS of patients who
progressed on first-line therapy in <6 months was 10.4 months
for ramucirumab + FOLFIRI versus 8.0 months for placebo +
FOLFIRI. Patients who progressed on first-line therapy in ≥6
months exhibited a median OS of 14.3 versus 12.5 months, re-
spectively. TTP <6 months on first-line therapy is prognostic for
poorer median OS (in this study, ∼4 months), but both patients
with longer and shorter first-line TTP received benefit from the
addition of ramucirumab to standard FOLFIRI treatment. This
result differentiates the RAISE study from the TML registration
trial for second-line bevacizumab that excluded patients who
progressed in <3 months on first-line bevacizumab with
chemotherapy [14]. (The TML study also excluded patients who
received <3 months of continued bevacizumab treatment in the
first-line, whereas the RAISE study included both groups.) Since
ramucirumab efficacy is similar in patients with both longer and
shorter time to first-line progression and with either mutant or
wild-type KRAS status, oncologists might consider it a beneficial
addition to second-line chemotherapy.
Pooled analyses have shown that the efficacy of combination
chemotherapy in healthy older mCRC patients is similar to that
in younger patients [15–17]. However the declining physiologic
reserves and organ function associated with aging reduces the
ability of older patients to compensate for stressors such as
chemotherapy and infection, thus increasing the incidence and

 severity of TEAE in older patients for some chemotherapies
[18]. Our analyses of the ≥65 versus <65 years RAISE patient
subgroups confirmed an equivalent ramucirumab + FOLFIRI
treatment benefit (interaction P = 0.9521 for OS and 0.6965 for
PFS). We also compared the incidence of all grade TEAEs and
grade 3/4 TEAEs within the <65 and ≥65 age groups and found
that those TEAEs associated with ramucirumab treatment were
elevated to a similar extent in both age subgroups. Although the
addition of ramucirumab to chemotherapy has been found to
cause a manageable increase in grade ≥3 neutropenia [38.4%
versus 23.3%, with low (∼3%) and similar febrile neutropenia
between arms] and grade ≥3 hypertension (11.2% versus 2.8%)
[8], neither neutropenia nor hypertension was further elevated
in elderly patients. The same results held true for subgroups
defined by age 75; however, the small size of the ≥75 subgroup
requires confirmation of this result.
Treatment-by-subgroup interaction test was utilized in these
analyses. This test largely had low statistical power as the study
was not powered for testing treatment-by-subgroup interaction.
However, given the generally large P-values, the presence of real
interactions was not supported by the data.
The RAISE trial showed that the addition of ramucirumab to
FOLFIRI demonstrated a consistent and clinically meaningful
survival benefit for patients with mCRC who progressed on or
after first-line combination therapy with bevacizumab, oxalipla-
tin, and a fluoropyrimidine. The detailed analyses presented
here reveal no efficacy or safety difference in response among
patients with differing KRAS mutation status, longer or shorter
first-line TTP, and age. Ramucirumab + FOLFIRI is an effective
second-line treatment for a wide range of patients with mCRC.
