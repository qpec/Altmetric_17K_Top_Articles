Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 17 classes of human cancer. We analyzed
somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco
smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens
of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different
cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly
exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by
tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC
cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutational process. Smoking is
associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with
the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutation
load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related
cancer types.
T
obacco smoking has been associated with
at least 17 types of human cancer (Table 1)
and claims the lives of more than 6 million
people every year (1–4). Tobacco smoke is a
complex mixture of chemicals, among which
at least 60 are carcinogens (5). Many of these are
thought to cause cancer by inducing DNA damage
that, if misreplicated, leads to an increased bur-
den of somatic mutations and, hence, an elevated
chance of acquiring driver mutations in cancer
genes. Such damage often occurs in the form of
covalent bonding of metabolically activated re-
active species of the carcinogen to DNA bases,
termed DNA adducts (6). Tissues directly exposed
to tobacco smoke (e.g., lung), as well as some
tissues not directly exposed (e.g., bladder), show
elevated levels of DNA adducts in smokers and,
thus, evidence of exposure to carcinogenic com-
ponents of tobacco smoke (7, 8).
Each biological process causing mutations in
somatic cells leaves a mutational signature (9).
Many cancers have a somatic mutation in the
TP53 gene, and catalogs of TP53 mutations com-
piled two decades ago enabled early exploration
of these signatures (10), showing that lung can-
cers from smokers have more C>A transversions
than lung cancers from nonsmokers (11–14). To
investigate mutational signatures using the thou-
sands of mutation catalogs generated by systematic
cancer genome sequencing, we recently described
a framework in which each base substitution
signature is characterized using a 96-mutation
classification that includes the six substitution
types together with the bases immediately 5′ and
3′ to the mutated base (15). The analysis extracts
mutational signatures from mutation catalogs and
estimates the number of mutations contributed
by each signature to each cancer genome (15).
Using this approach, more than 30 different
base substitution signatures have been identi-
fied (16–18).
In this study, we examined 5243 cancer ge-
nome sequences (4633 exomes and 610 whole
genomes) of cancer classes for which smoking
increases risk, with the goal of identifying mu-
tational signatures and methylation changes as-
sociated with tobacco smoking (table S1). Of the
samples we studied, 2490 were reported to be
from tobacco smokers and 1063 from never-
smokers (Table 1). Thus, we were able to inves-
tigate the mutational consequences of smoking
by comparing somatic mutations and methyla-
tion in smokers versus nonsmokers for lung,
larynx, pharynx, oral cavity, esophageal, bladder,
liver, cervical, kidney, and pancreatic cancers
(Fig. 1 and table S2).
We first compared total numbers of base sub-
stitutions, small insertions and deletions (indels),
and genomic rearrangements. The total number
of base substitutions was higher in smokers
compared with nonsmokers for all cancer types
together (q-value < 0.05) and, for individual can-
cer types, in lung adenocarcinoma, larynx, liver,
and kidney cancers (table S2). Total numbers of
indels were higher in smokers compared with
nonsmokers in lung adenocarcinoma and liver
cancer (table S2). The whole-genome–sequenced
cases allowed comparison of genome rearrange-
ments between smokers and nonsmokers in pan-
creatic and liver cancer, where no differences
were found (table S2). However, subchromo-
somal copy-number changes entail genomic
rearrangement and can serve as surrogates for
rearrangements. Lung adenocarcinomas from
smokers exhibited more copy-number aberra-
tions than those from nonsmokers (table S2).
We then extracted mutational signatures, es-
timated the contributions of each signature to
each cancer, and compared the numbers of mu-
tations attributable to each signature in smokers
and nonsmokers. Increases in smokers compared
with nonsmokers were seen for signatures 2, 4, 5,
13, and 16 [the mutational signature nomencla-
ture is that used in the Catalogue of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and in (16–18)].
There was sufficient statistical power to show that
these increases were of clonal mutations (muta-
tions present in all cells of each cancer) for
signatures 4 and 5 (q < 0.05), as expected if
these mutations are due to cigarette smoke ex-
posure before neoplastic change (supplemen-
tary text).
Signature 4 is characterized mainly by C>A
mutations with smaller contributions from other
base substitution classes (Fig. 2B and fig. S1). This
signature was found only in cancer types in
which tobacco smoking increases risk and mainly
in those derived from epithelia directly exposed
to tobacco smoke (figs. S2 and S3). Signature 4 is
very similar to the mutational signature induced in
vitro by exposing cells to benzo[a]pyrene (cosine
similarity = 0.94) (Fig. 2B and fig. S3), a tobacco
smoke carcinogen (19). The similarity extends to
the presence of a transcriptional strand bias in-
dicative of transcription-coupled nucleotide ex-
cision repair (NER) of bulky DNA adducts on
guanine (fig. S1), the proposed mechanism of
DNA damage by benzo[a]pyrene. Thus, signa-
ture 4 is likely the direct mutational consequence
of misreplication of DNA damage induced by
tobacco carcinogens.
Most lung and larynx cancers from smokers
had many signature 4 mutations. Signature 4
mutations occurred more often in cancers from

Downloaded from 
 smokers compared with nonsmokers in all cancer
types together (table S2) and in lung squamous,
lung adenocarcinoma, and larynx cancers (table
S2). This finding largely accounts for differences
in total numbers of base substitutions (Table 1).
In nonsmokers, 13.8% of lung cancers showed
many signature 4 mutations (Fig. 2A; >1 mu-
tation per megabase), which may be due to pas-
sive smoking, misreporting of smoking habits,
or annotation errors. Signature 4 mutations
were also detected in cancers of the oral cavity,
pharynx, and esophagus, albeit in much smaller
numbers than in lung and larynx cancers, per-
haps because of reduced exposure to tobacco
smoke or more efficient clearance. Differences
in mutation burden attributed to signature 4 be-
tween smokers and nonsmokers were not observed
in these cancer types (Fig. 1). Signature 4 mu-
tations were found at low levels in cancers of
the liver, an organ not directly exposed to to-
bacco smoke, and were elevated in smokers
versus nonsmokers (Fig. 1).
Signature 4 was not extracted from bladder,
cervical, kidney, or pancreatic cancers, despite
the known risks conferred by smoking and
the presence of many smokers in these series.
Additionally, this mutational signature was not
extracted from cancers of the stomach, colorectum,
and ovary, nor from acute myeloid leukemia (in
the analyzed series, the smoking status of pa-
tients with these cancers was unknown, but it is
likely that many have been smokers). The tis-
sues from which all of these cancer types are
derived are not directly exposed to tobacco smoke.
Simulations indicate that the lack of signature
4 is not due to statistical limitations (supple-
mentary text and fig. S4). The absence of sig-
nature 4 suggests that misreplication of direct
DNA damage due to tobacco smoke constituents
does not contribute substantially to mutation
burden in these cancers, even though DNA ad-
ducts indicative of tobacco-induced DNA dam-
age are present in the tissues from which they
arise (7).
Signatures 2 and 13 are characterized by C>T
and C>G mutations, respectively, at TpC dinu-
cleotides and have been attributed to overactive
DNA editing by APOBEC deaminases (20, 21).
The cause of the overactivity in most cancers
has not been established, although APOBECs are
implicated in the cellular response to the entrance
of foreign DNA, retrotransposon movement, and
local inflammation (22). Signatures 2 and 13
showed more mutations in smokers versus non-
smokers with lung adenocarcinoma (table S2).
Because these signatures are found in many
other cancer types, where they are apparently
unrelated to tobacco smoking, it seems unlikely
that the signature 2 and 13 mutations associated
with smoking in lung adenocarcinoma are direct
consequences of misreplication of DNA damage
induced by tobacco smoke. More plausibly, the
cellular machinery underlying signatures 2 and
13 is activated by tobacco smoke, perhaps as a
result of inflammation arising from the deposi-
tion of particulate matter or by indirect con-
sequences of DNA damage.
Signature 5 is characterized by mutations dis-
tributed across all 96 subtypes of base substi-
tution, with a predominance of T>C and C>T
mutations (Fig. 2B) and evidence of transcrip-
tional strand bias for T>C mutations (18). Signa-
ture 5 is found in all cancer types, including those
unrelated to tobacco smoking, and in most can-
cer samples. It is “clocklike” in that the number
of mutations attributable to this signature cor-
relates with age at the time of diagnosis in many
cancer types (17). Signature 5, together with sig-
nature 1, is thought to contribute to mutation ac-
cumulation in most normal somatic cells and in
the germline (17, 23). The mechanisms underlying
signature 5 are not well understood, although
an enrichment of signature 5 mutations was
found in bladder cancers harboring inactivating

smoking. Information about the age-adjusted odds ratios for current male
smokers to develop cancer is taken from (2–4). Odds ratios for small cell lung

 mutations in ERCC2, which encodes a compo-
nent of NER (24).
Signature 5 (or a similar signature that is dif-
ficult to differentiate from signature 5 because
of the relatively flat profiles of these signatures)
was increased by a factor of 1.3 to 5.1 (q < 0.05;
table S2) in smokers versus nonsmokers in all
cancer types together and in lung squamous,
lung adenocarcinoma, larynx, pharynx, oral cav-
ity, esophageal squamous, bladder, liver, and
kidney cancers. The association of smoking with
signature 5 mutations across these nine cancer
types therefore includes some for which the
risks conferred by smoking are modest and for
which normal progenitor cells are not directly
exposed to cigarette smoke (Table 1). Given the
clocklike nature of signature 5 (17), its presence
in the human germline (23), its ubiquity in
cancer types unrelated to tobacco smoking (18),
and its widespread occurrence in nonsmokers,
it seems unlikely that signature 5 mutations
associated with tobacco smoking are direct
consequences of misreplication of DNA dam-
aged by tobacco carcinogens. It is more plausible
that smoking affects the machinery generating
signature 5 mutations (24). Presumably as a con-
sequence of the effects of smoking, signature 5
mutations correlated with age at the time of
diagnosis in nonsmokers (P = 0.001) but not in
smokers (P = 0.59).
Signature 16 is predominantly characterized
by T>C mutations at ApT dinucleotides (Fig. 2B);
exhibits a strong transcriptional strand bias
consistent with almost all damage occurring
on adenine (fig. S5); and, thus far, has been
detected only in liver cancer. The underlying
mutational process is currently unknown. Sig-
nature 16 exhibited a higher mutation burden
in smokers versus nonsmokers with liver cancer
(table S2).
For smokers with lung, larynx, pharynx, oral
cavity, esophageal, bladder, liver, cervical, kidney,
and pancreatic cancers, quantitative data on cu-
mulative exposure to tobacco smoke were avail-
able (table S1). Total numbers of base substitution
mutations were positively correlated with pack
years smoked (1 pack year is defined as smoking
one pack per day for 1 year) for all cancer types
together (q < 0.05) and for lung adenocarcinoma
(table S3). For individual mutational signatures,
correlations with pack years smoked were found
in multiple cancer types for signatures 4 and 5
(table S3). Signature 4 correlated with pack years
in lung squamous, lung adenocarcinoma, larynx,
and liver cancers. Signature 5 correlated with
pack years in all cancers together, as well as in
lung adenocarcinoma, pharynx, oral cavity, and

 bladder cancers (table S3). In lung adenocarci-
noma, correlations with pack years smoked were
also observed for signatures 2 and 13. The rates
of these correlations allow estimation of the ap-
proximate numbers of mutations accumulated in
a normal cell of each tissue due to smoking a pack
of cigarettes a day for a year: lung, 150 mutations;
larynx, 97; pharynx, 39; oral cavity 23; bladder, 18;
liver, 6 (table S3).
Consistent with our results, previous studies
have reported higher numbers of total base sub-
stitutions in lung adenocarcinoma in smokers
versus nonsmokers (mainly due to C>A substitu-
tions) (25, 26). The same is true of signatures 4
and 5 in lung adenocarcinoma (18), signature 4
in liver cancer (27), and signature 5 in bladder
cancer (24).
Differential methylation of the DNA of normal
cells of smokers compared to nonsmokers has
been reported (28). Using data from methyl-
ation arrays, each containing ~470,000 of the
~28 million CpG sites in the human genome,
we evaluated whether differences in methyla-
tion are found in cancers. Overall levels of CpG
methylation in DNA from cancers were similar
in smokers and nonsmokers for all cancer types
(fig. S6). Individual CpGs were differentially
methylated (>5% difference) in only two cancer
types: 369 CpGs were hypomethylated and 65
were hypermethylated in lung adenocarcinoma,
with five hypomethylated and three hypermethyl-
ated in oral cancer (Fig. 3 and fig. S7). CpGs
exhibiting differences in methylation clustered
in certain genes but were not associated with
known cancer genes more than expected by
chance, nor with genes hypomethylated in nor-
mal blood or buccal cells of tobacco smokers
(fig. S8 and tables S4 and S5) (28). Therefore,
with the exception of lung cancer, CpG methyl-
ation showed limited differences between the
cancers of smokers and nonsmokers (Fig. 3).
The genomes of smoking-associated cancers
permit reassessment of our understanding of
how tobacco smoke causes cancer. Consistent
with the proposition that an increased mutation
load caused by tobacco smoke contributes to in-
creased cancer risk, the total mutation burden
is elevated in smokers versus nonsmokers with
lung adenocarcinoma, larynx, liver, and kidney
cancers. However, differences in total mutation
burden were not observed in the other smoking-
associated cancer types and, in some, there were
no statistically significant smoking-associated dif-
ferences in mutation load, signatures, or DNA
methylation. Caution should be exercised in the
interpretation of the latter observations. In addi-
tion to limitations of statistical power, multiple
rounds of clonal expansion over many years are
often required for development of a symptomatic
cancer. It is thus conceivable that, in the normal
tissues from which smoking-associated cancer
types originate, there are more somatic muta-
tions (or differences in methylation) in smokers
than in nonsmokers but that these differences
become obscured during the intervening clonal
evolution. Moreover, some theoretical models pre-
dict that relatively small differences in mutation
burden caused by smoking in preneoplastic cells
could account for the observed increases in cancer

Fig. 2. Mutational signatures associated with tobacco smoking. (A) Each
panel contains 25 randomly selected cancer genomes (represented by in-
dividual bars) from either smokers or nonsmokers in a given cancer type.The
y axes reflect numbers of somatic mutations per megabase. Each bar is
colored proportionately to the number of mutations per megabase attributed
to the mutational signatures found in that sample. The naming of mutational
signatures is consistent with previous reports (16–18). (B) Each panel con-
tains the pattern of a mutational signature associated with tobacco smoking.
Signatures are depicted using a 96-substitution classification defined by the
substitution type and sequence context immediately 5′ and 3′ to the mutated
base. Different colors are used to display the various types of substitutions.
The percentages of mutations attributed to specific substitution types are on
the y axes, whereas the x axes display different types of substitutions. Mu-
tational signatures are depicted based on the trinucleotide frequency of the
whole human genome. Signatures 2, 4, 5, 13, and 16 are extracted from can-
cers associated with tobacco smoking. The signature of benzo[a]pyrene is
based on in vitro experimental data (19). Numerical values for these muta-
tional signatures are provided in table S6.

 risks (29). Other models indicate that differences
in mutation burden between smokers and non-
smokers need not be observed in the final cancers
(supplementary text and fig. S6). Thus, increased
somatic mutation loads in precancerous tissues
may still explain the smoking-induced risks of
most cancers, although other mechanisms have
been proposed (30, 31).
However, the generation of increased somatic
mutation burden by tobacco smoking appears
to be mechanistically complex. Smoking correlates
with increases in base substitutions of multiple
mutational signatures, together with increases
in indels and copy-number changes. The extent
to which these distinct mutational processes op-
erate differs between tissue types (at least partially
depending on the degree of direct exposure to
tobacco smoke), and their mechanisms range
from misreplication of DNA damage caused by
tobacco smoke constituents to activation of more
generally operative mutational processes. Although
we cannot exclude roles for covariate behaviors
of smokers or differences in the biology of can-
cers arising in smokers compared with non-
smokers, smoking itself is most plausibly the
cause of these differences.

Fig. 3. Differentially methylated individual CpGs in tobacco smokers across cancers associated
with tobacco smoking. Each dot represents an individual CpG. The x axes reflect differences in meth-
ylation between lifelong nonsmokers and smokers, where positive values correspond to hypermethylation
and negative values to hypomethylation.The y axes depict levels of statistical significance. Results satisfy-
ing a Bonferroni threshold of 10−7 (above the red line) are considered statistically significant.
