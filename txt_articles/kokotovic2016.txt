Long-term Recurrence and Complications Associated
With Elective Incisional Hernia Repair
Dunja Kokotovic, MB; Thue Bisgaard, MD, DMSc; Frederik Helgstrand, MD, DMSc
IMPORTANCE Prosthetic mesh is frequently used to reinforce the repair of abdominal wall
incisional hernias. The benefits of mesh for reducing the risk of hernia recurrence or the
long-term risks of mesh-related complications are not known.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the risks of long-term recurrence and mesh-related complications
following elective abdominal wall hernia repair in a population with complete follow-up.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Registry-based nationwide cohort study including all
elective incisional hernia repairs in Denmark from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2010.
A total of 3242 patients with incisional repair were included. Follow-up until November 1,
2014, was obtained by merging data with prospective registrations from the Danish National
Patient Registry supplemented with a retrospective manual review of patient records.
A 100% follow-up rate was obtained.
EXPOSURES Hernia repair using mesh performed by either open or laparoscopic techniques
vs open repair without use of mesh.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Five-year risk of reoperation for recurrence and 5-year risk
of all mesh-related complications requiring subsequent surgery.
RESULTS Among the 3242 patients (mean age, 58.5 [SD, 13.5] years; 1720 women [53.1%]),
1119 underwent open mesh repair (34.5%), 366 had open nonmesh repair (11.3%), and 1757
had laparoscopic mesh repair (54.2%). The median follow-up after open mesh repair was 59
(interquartile range [IQR], 44-80) months, after nonmesh open repair was 62 (IQR, 44-79)
months, and after laparoscopic mesh repair was 61 (IQR, 48-78) months. The risk of the need
for repair for recurrent hernia following these initial hernia operations was lower for patients
with open mesh repair (12.3% [95% CI, 10.4%-14.3%]; risk difference, −4.8% [95% CI, –9.1%
to –0.5%]) and for patients with laparoscopic mesh repair (10.6% [95% CI, 9.2%-12.1%]; risk
difference, –6.5% [95% CI, –10.6% to –2.4%]) compared with nonmesh repair (17.1% [95% CI,
13.2%-20.9%]). For the entirety of the follow-up duration, there was a progressively
increasing number of mesh-related complications for both open and laparoscopic
procedures. At 5 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of mesh-related complications
was 5.6% (95% CI, 4.2%-6.9%) for patients who underwent open mesh hernia repair and
3.7% (95% CI, 2.8%-4.6%) for patients who underwent laparoscopic mesh repair. The
long-term repair-related complication rate for patients with an initial nonmesh repair was
0.8% (open nonmesh repair vs open mesh repair: risk difference, 5.3% [95% CI, 4.4%-6.2%];
open nonmesh repair vs laparoscopic mesh repair: risk difference, 3.4% [95% CI,
2.7%-4.1%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing incisional repair, sutured repair
was associated with a higher risk of reoperation for recurrence over 5 years compared with
open mesh and laparoscopic mesh repair. With long-term follow-up, the benefits attributable
to mesh are offset in part by mesh-related complications.

E
lective incisional hernia repair is one of the most com-
monly performed general surgical operations.1,2 In the
United States alone, there were about 190 000 inpatient
abdominal wall hernia repairs performed in 2012.3 Because it is
believed to reduce the risk of hernia recurrence, mesh is com-
monlyplacedasanadjuncttoherniarepairandmeshplacement
is done in at least half of the abdominal wall hernia repairs per-
formedintheUnitedStates.3,4 However,thelong-termcompli-
cationsrelatedtomeshplacementarenotknown.Therearefew
randomized trials assessing the effectiveness of mesh, and ob-
servationaltrialsinvestigatingthesequestionsarelimitedbyin-
complete long-term follow-up and relatively small numbers of
patients.4-6 Although mesh reduces recurrences, it is a foreign
material and may cause a host of complications.7,8 These range
from mild skin problems such as skin infections, nonhealing
wounds, and seroma formation to severe chronic pain, life-
threateningbowelobstruction,andchronicfistuladevelopment
that may be caused by chronic mesh infection.
TheDanishHerniaDatabasewasestablishedtomonitorand

database were on short-term outcomes (readmissions, patient
reported outcomes, complications) and hernia recurrence

tive of the study was to analyze the long-term consequences of
mesh reinforcement in elective incisional hernia repair.
Methods
Patients and Data Sources
The present study extends our previously reported data on 30-
day postoperative complications and recurrence.8 Consecutive
patientsundergoingelectiveincisionalherniarepairfromJanu-
ary1,2007,toDecember31,2010,wereanalyzed.Patientswere
identified from the Danish Hernia Database. The study was ap-
proved by the Danish Data Protection Agency and the National
BoardofHealth.Becausethestudyisaregistry-basedstudy,par-
ticipantconsentandinstitutionalreviewboardapprovalarenot

Anindexrepairwasdefinedasapatient’
sfirstincisionalher-
niarepairintheDanishHerniaDatabase.Thenumberofpatients
included in the study corresponded to the number of hernia re-
pairs. Categorization of patient demographics such as age and
hernia size was consistent with a previous study making com-
parison possible.8 Open sutured repairs without mesh were
categorizedasnonmeshrepairs.Informationaboutreoperations
wasobtainedbymergingdatafromtheDanishHerniaDatabase
with that from the Danish National Patient Registry using a pa-
tient’
s unique Danish social security number as a patient iden-
tifier. Additional information about patients was obtained by
manualreviewofpatientrecordsforthosewhounderwentsub-
sequent abdominal reoperation. One investigator (D.K.) per-
formed the patient record reviews and assessed if the reopera-
tionswererelatedtotheoriginalmeshherniarepair.Whenthere

the records were discussed with a second investigator (F.H.)
and a consensus opinion was made. Chart reviewers were not
blindedtothestudyhypothesisnortowhatapatient’
sinitialop-
eration was. The follow-up period extended from the time of
the index hernia repair until reoperation for recurrence, death,
emigration, mesh removal, or the end of the study period
(November 1, 2014). A 100% follow-up rate was obtained.
The Danish Hernia Database covers 80% to 90% of all ven-
tral hernia repairs in Denmark.9,12 The database is dependent
on surgeons’registration of their individual hernia repairs, and
this registration is mandatory. The actual registration rate is
approximately 90%. The Danish Hernia Database contains in-
formation about intraoperative technical details of the her-
niaoperationasdetailedpreviously.8,9Thereissubstantialcon-
cordance between information in the Danish Hernia Database
and patient records.9,12 The Danish National Patient Registry
is a national administrative database based on prospective reg-
istration of diagnosis- and procedure-related code classifica-
tions (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes and
NOMESCO Classification of Surgical Procedures13 procedure
codes). The Danish National Patient Registry has not been spe-
cifically validated for hernia repairs but has been for other sur-
gical procedures such as cholecystectomies and operations for
gynecologicalmalignancies.Morethan90%ofthesurgicalpro-
cedures were registered.14,15 The National Patient Registry has
information on all patient encounters within the Danish hos-
pitalsystem(publicandprivate)andhasinformationonallpro-
cedures performed during hospital admissions and in ambu-
latory settings.16,17 Because Denmark has minimal emigration,
the database represents an essentially closed cohort.16 Before
commencing the study, a decision was made to supplement
follow-up data available from the Danish National Patient Reg-
istrywithamanualreviewofpatientrecordsfrompatientswho
underwentabdominalreoperations,includingoperationsdone
for abdominal infection or bleeding, diagnostic laparosco-
pies, and diagnostic laparotomies. Operations not related to
the abdominal wall or abdominal cavity were not reviewed.
Independent Variables
Information about the size and type of hernia and position and
fixation of the mesh material was prospectively collected in
Key Points
Question What are the long-term consequences in patients
undergoing incisional hernia repair?
Findings In this registry-based nationwide cohort study including
3242 patients, mesh repair was associated with a lower risk of
reoperation for recurrence compared with nonmesh repair over a
5-year follow-up period. However, a risk of long-term mesh-related
complications for open and laparoscopic mesh repairs partially
offset these benefits.
Meaning The overall benefits of mesh utilization for the repair
of abdominal wall hernias are uncertain.

the Danish Hernia Database. The hernia defect size was de-
fined as the largest diameter of the fascia defect (length or
width) as measured by the surgeon during the operation.8
Mesh types included polypropylene (PPL), coated PPL, ex-
panded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), PPL plus ePTFE,
coated polyester, or other types (biological mesh, completely
absorbable synthetic mesh, and not specified). For open re-
pairs, the mesh position was onlay, sublay, intraperitoneal, or
other position (inlay, plug). All laparoscopic repairs were per-
formed by intraperitoneal placement of mesh. The tech-
niques of mesh fixation included tacking (absorbable and non-
absorbable), suture, and other fixation techniques (glue, clips,
and unspecified fixation). Tacks are mesh fixation devices
made of titanium (nonabsorbable) or polymers (absorbable).
The distinction between absorbable and nonabsorbable tack
fixation for hernia repair was systematically recorded in the
Danish Hernia Database after 2008. A combination of tack and
suture fixation was classified as tack fixation because in this
circumstance, suture is usually used to position the mesh prior
to placing the tacks.
Outcomes
The2outcomeswereriskofreoperationforrecurrenceandrisk
of mesh-related complications. The definitions and methods
applied for assessing recurrence repair were the same as used
in our prior analyses, and a recurrence repair was defined as a
repair of an incisional hernia in the same scar as the previous
hernia repair.8 We a priori defined long-term complications as
those occurring 30 days after the index hernia operation and
requiring surgical intervention in either an inpatient or outpa-
tient setting. Similar to our previous work, surgical complica-
tions were graded into major and clinically important com-
plications.10 Major complications were defined as acutely
life-threateningandrequiringemergencysurgery.Clinicallyim-
portantcomplications,suchaslateabscessesandfistulas,were
defined as all clinically significant complications not requir-
ing emergency surgery. We a priori defined complications as
surgical site infection, presence of a chronic sinus tract, late-
onset intra-abdominal abscess, enterocutaneous fistula, se-
roma,hematoma,nonhealingwound,bowelobstruction,bowel
perforation, bleeding, and need for diagnostic laparoscopy or
laparotomy because of severe abdominal pain. Complications
were stratified by one of the investigators as definitely, poten-
tially, or unlikely to be related to the previous repair based on
hospital records and operative reports regarding anatomical
conditions, etc.8,10 Surgical complications classified as “defi-
nitely related to the hernia repair” and “possibly related to the
hernia repair” were included in the analyses. When doubt ex-
istedabouttherelatednessofthecomplicationtotheindexher-
nia operation, consensus was obtained between 2 investiga-
tors. Only 1 operation for a complication per patient (the most
severe) was assessed, although more than 1 operation per pa-
tient may have occurred.18 Prior to commencing the study and
because of the risk of selection bias, we decided not to make a
statistical comparison of outcomes between open mesh re-
pair and laparoscopic mesh repair.10 The 30-day mesh-related
mortality rate was defined as death within the first 30 days af-
ter surgical intervention due to mesh-related complications.
Statistical Analysis
The distribution of continuous data was assessed by visual in-
spection of histograms. Age was calculated as mean with stan-
darddeviation.Herniasize,meshsize,andfollow-uptimewere
calculatedasmedianswithinterquartileranges(IQRs).Therisk
ofreoperationforrecurrenceandtheriskofmesh-relatedcom-
plications were analyzed in accordance with the competing
risk method19 and presented as cause-specific cumulative
incidences.20 To analyze independent risk factors for recur-
rence after open repair, we performed bivariable analyses
screening clinically relevant risk factors including age, sex, pri-
mary (vs recurrent) repair, mesh position, and hernia size. For
laparoscopicrepair,bivariableanalyseswereperformedforage,
sex, primary (vs recurrent) repair, hernia size, and mesh fixa-
tion. Bivariables expressing aP < .20 and clinically relevant co-
variates were entered simultaneously into a Cox regression
model to follow methods from a previous study.8 The analy-
sis was performed separately for open repairs (mesh) and for
laparoscopic repairs. To analyze the independent risk factors
for long-term mesh-related complications, clinically impor-
tant characteristics such as age, sex, mesh size, mesh type,
mesh positioning, and technique for mesh fixation were en-
tered into a Cox regression model for open and laparoscopic
mesh repair separately. Hernia size was not entered as a vari-
able in the regression model for mesh-related complications
because mesh size, from a clinical standpoint, can act as a sur-
rogate measure of hernia size. Relevant interaction analyses
were chosen based on clinical relevance (for open repairs: her-
nia size, mesh size, mesh position, mesh fixation, and mesh
type; for laparoscopic repairs: hernia size, mesh size, and mesh
type). Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95%
confidence intervals. Furthermore, a separate Cox analysis in-
cluding type of tacks (data from 2008-2010) and the above-
mentioned variables was performed for laparoscopic repair.
The proportional hazard assumption was tested by visual in-
spection of log-minus-log survival curves, and this assump-
tion was not violated. Testing was 2-sided and P<.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. The statistical analyses were
performedusingtheIBMstatisticalsoftwarepackageSPSS,ver-
sion 22, module Statistics Base, Advanced Statistics, and Re-
gression. Cumulative incidence was analyzed in R, version
3.0.2, with the cmprsk package.
Propensity Score Adjustment
Becausethiswasanobservationalstudy,directcomparisonbe-
tweenpatientstreatedwithopensurgeryandlaparoscopicsur-
gery could be influenced by selection bias. Propensity-
adjusted analysis was performed in an effort to minimize the
influence of selection bias on the analysis. A score reflective
of the propensity to have mesh placed was calculated in a lo-
gistic regression model that included clinical information that
might predict the use of mesh: hernia size and primary vs re-
current repair.21 Propensity-adjusted Cox regression analysis
was performed for mesh complications and included all pa-
tients with a mesh repair. The Cox regression analysis en-
tered the following variables: propensity score, operation type
(open mesh or laparoscopic mesh), age, sex, mesh size, mesh
type, mesh positioning, and technique for mesh fixation.

Results
In total, 3242 patients (mean age, 58.5 [SD, 13.5] years; 1720
women [53.1%]) were included in the analysis: 1119 patients
(34.5%) with open mesh repair, 366 patients (11.3%) with non-
mesh repair, and 1757 patients (54.2%) with laparoscopic mesh
repair(eFigureintheSupplement).Medianfollow-upafteropen
mesh repair was 59 (IQR, 44-80) months, after nonmesh re-
pair was 62 (IQR, 44-79) months, and after laparoscopic mesh
repair was 61 (IQR, 48-78) months. For mesh repairs, only 4 pa-
tients (0.1%) underwent repair with a biological mesh, with the
remainder undergoing a repair using a synthetic mesh. Patient
and mesh characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Reoperation for Recurrence
(Open and Laparoscopic Repair)
Four hundred twelve patients (12.7%) underwent a repair for
recurrence.Theoverallrecurrencerateintheopenmeshgroup
was 13.2% (n = 148), in the laparoscopic mesh group was 11.2%
(n = 197), and in the nonmesh group was 18.3% (n = 67). The
cumulative risk of reoperation for recurrence increased
throughout the study period. The cumulative risk of reopera-
tion for recurrence at 5 years was lower for patients with open
mesh repair (12.3% [95% CI, 10.4%-14.3%); risk difference,
−4.8% [95% CI, –9.1% to –0.5%]) and laparoscopic mesh re-
pair (10.6% [95% CI, 9.2%-12.1%]; risk difference, −6.5% [95%
CI, –10.6% to –2.4%]) compared with nonmesh repair (17.1%
[95% CI, 13.2%-20.9%]) (Figure 1).

Risk Factors for Reoperation for Recurrence
Open Repair
Risk factors for reoperation for recurrence are presented in
eTable 1 in the Supplement. In a multivariable analysis, larger
herniasizewasassociatedwithincreasedriskofreoperationfor
recurrence (eTable 1). Older age at the time of the index opera-
tion was associated with reduced risk of reoperation for recur-
rence (eTable 1). Mesh position (onlay, sublay, etc) was not sig-
nificantly associated with risk of reoperation for recurrence.
Laparoscopic Repair
Risk factors for reoperation for recurrence are presented in
eTable 1. In a multivariable analysis, increasing age was asso-
ciated with reduced risk of reoperation for recurrence. Fur-
thermore, hernia size greater than 20 cm compared with 0 to
2 cm and nontack mesh fixation compared with tack fixation
were independent risk factors for hernia recurrence requir-
ing repair (eTable 1).

Laparoscopic Mesh Repair
As found for open mesh repair, the larger the mesh, the higher
the risk of laparoscopic mesh-related complications (HR, 1.02;

Discussion
In this Danish nationwide analysis of long-term complications
following elective incisional hernia repair, the use of mesh to
reinforce the repair was associated with a lower risk of recur-
rencecomparedwithwhenmeshwasnotused.Inthelongterm,
there was a progressively increasing rate of serious mesh-
related complications partially offsetting the recurrence ben-

With 5-year follow-up, there was a 6.5% lower hernia re-
currence rate requiring reoperation attributable to laparo-
scopic hernia repair compared with open, nonmesh hernia re-
pair. Mesh reinforcement was associated with a 4.8% reduced
risk of recurrence for open repairs. However, with long-term
follow-up, 1.4% of patients required reoperation for bowel ob-
struction, bowel perforation, or bleeding that was not re-
quired for patients who did not get mesh. There was a need
for subsequent operations in 2.7% more patients receiving
mesh than those not receiving mesh for other complications,
such as the development of enterocutaneous fistula, late ab-
scess,etc.Thus,meshimplantationpreventedtheneedforsub-
sequent reoperation in relatively few patients, suggesting that
the benefits associated with the use of mesh are partially off-
set by long-term complications associated with its use. This
observation, however, should be interpreted with caution be-
cause of the risk of selection bias. Larger, more complicated
hernias are likely to be repaired with mesh, and small, simple
hernias with little likelihood of long-term problems tend to be
repaired without mesh.8
Mesh-related complications have previously been re-
ported in case series,22 small retrospective studies,5,6 and a
singlerandomizedclinicaltrial.4Mostofthesestudieshadrela-
tively few (<200) patients, and follow-up was incomplete and
between 34 and 81 months. Only a single study of 29 patients
evaluated long-term complications following laparoscopic
meshrepair.5Thesestudiesfoundanapproximately6%to20%
complication rate attributable to mesh.4-6 These complica-
tions included bowel obstruction, enterocutaneous fistulas,
and development of chronic sinus tracts. We found that
bowel obstruction4,5 and sinus tract6 were the most com-
monly occurring long-term mesh-related complications. The
lower complication rate in the current study relative to prior
reports is explained by our focus on clinically serious compli-
cations that required subsequent operations, and we ex-
cluded analysis of medically related complications. Our find-
ing that the incidence of complications progressively increases
with time may be explained by a prior observation that in-
flammation associated with mesh persists for up to 8 years fol-
lowing implantation.23
Another reason our results may differ from prior reports
is the complete, long-term follow-up we have for the patient
followed in the Danish Hernia Database. Loss to follow-up
is common in clinical studies and seriously limits conclu-
sions that can be made regarding the efficacy of various treat-
ments. In general, it is optimal to have greater than 80%
follow-up in any cohort to make meaningful conclusions, a de-
gree of follow-up rarely achieved in published studies.24,25
Mesh size was an independent risk factor for mesh-
related complications for both open and laparoscopic hernia
repair. Mesh size is closely related to hernia size (4- to 5-cm
overlap is generally recommended),26 and this finding sub-
stantiates that larger hernias are associated with higher risk of
postoperative complications.8,27 Coated mesh appeared to re-
duce the long-term complications associated with mesh. This
might be because of less long-term inflammation associated
with hernia mesh.28-31 However, inflammation increases fi-
brosis, which results in a more secure repair. Less fibrosis can,
in theory, increase the risk of recurrences. Information on the
type of mesh coating was not available in the present study.
There are several limitations to this study. These results
were not based on randomized data, so selection bias and
imbalance between the groups at baseline cannot be fully
controlled for. We did prospectively collect data from
detailed registries maintained in 2 national databases that we
supplemented with retrospective data collected from indi-
vidual patient records. There is only a single randomized
clinical trial of the use of mesh reporting long-term out-
comes4 and, given limitations in that study’
s inclusion and
exclusion criteria, the results cannot be generalized to all
patients with hernia. Also, the study was small, including
only 126 patients, limiting the ability to fully understand the
true spectrum of long-term complications and how they
influence outcomes. Our study had the benefit of reflecting
the real-world experience of an entire nation and all surgeons
performing hernia repair, with complete follow-up for all
patients. Thus, our results more closely reflect experience
that might be expected for hernia repair in actual practice
than has been suggested by prior studies.
Defining recurrence complications by the need for reop-
eration may underestimate the overall recurrence by a factor
of 4 to 5.32 This conservative definition emphasizes recur-
rences that have the most substantial clinical consequences.
Another limitation to our analysis is that our registry did not
include other factors such as body mass index and smoking
habits, which are known to influence the risk of complica-
tions from hernia repair.33 Although we tried to balance the
groups we compared by propensity adjustment,34 the influ-
ence of selection bias on the outcomes of observational trials
can never be completely overcome by statistical adjustment.35
The present study highlights the need to assess the
long-termsafetyofinterventionsbeforemakingdefinitivecon-
clusions about their benefits. Demonstration of long-term
safety is required for drugs in the United States36 but not for
some devices, such as hernia meshes, which are not subject
to similarly strict documentation.37 In the United States, most
hernia mesh is approved for use by the 510(k) mechanism. This
requires only that these materials have similarity to existing
products on the market without the need for clinical trials to
demonstrate safety or efficacy.3 Thus, the complete spec-
trum for the risks and benefits of mesh used to reinforce
hernia repair is not known because there are very few clinical
trial data reporting hernia outcomes as they pertain to mesh
utilization. This highlights the need for more long-term stud-
ies of mesh repair using high-quality registries such as the one
in Denmark.38,39
Conclusions
Among patients undergoing incisional repair, sutured re-
pair was associated with a higher risk of reoperation for
recurrence over 5 years compared with open mesh and
laparoscopic mesh repair. With long-term follow-up, the ben-
efits attributable to mesh are offset in part by mesh-related
complications.
