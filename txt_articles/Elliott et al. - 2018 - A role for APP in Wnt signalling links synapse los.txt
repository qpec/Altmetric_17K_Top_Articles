Abstract
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the canonical Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) is induced by β-amyloid (Aβ) and shifts the
balance from canonical towards non-canonical Wnt signalling. Canonical (Wnt-β-catenin) signalling promotes synapse
stability, while non-canonical (Wnt-PCP) signalling favours synapse retraction; thus Aβ-driven synapse loss is mediated
by Dkk1. Here we show that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) co-activates both arms of Wnt signalling through
physical interactions with Wnt co-receptors LRP6 and Vangl2, to bi-directionally modulate synapse stability.
Furthermore, activation of non-canonical Wnt signalling enhances Aβ production, while activation of canonical
signalling suppresses Aβ production. Together, these findings identify a pathogenic-positive feedback loop in which
Aβ induces Dkk1 expression, thereby activating non-canonical Wnt signalling to promote synapse loss and drive
further Aβ production. The Swedish familial AD variant of APP (APPSwe) more readily co-activates non-canonical, at the
expense of canonical Wnt activity, indicating that its pathogenicity likely involves direct effects on synapses, in addition
to increased Aβ production. Finally, we report that pharmacological inhibition of the Aβ-Dkk1-Aβ positive feedback
loop with the drug fasudil can restore the balance between Wnt pathways, prevent dendritic spine withdrawal in vitro,
and reduce Aβ load in vivo in mice with advanced amyloid pathology. These results clarify a relationship between Aβ
accumulation and synapse loss and provide direction for the development of potential disease-modifying treatments.
Introduction
The early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are char-
acterised by the progressive loss of synapses and increased
levels of β-amyloid (Aβ), leading to cognitive impairment,
dementia and a protracted death. As the precursor of the
Aβ peptides1 and the first familial Alzheimer’s disease
(FAD) gene to be identified2, the β-amyloid precursor
protein (APP) holds a central position in AD neuro-
pathology, while the synaptotoxic effects of soluble Aβ
species are well documented3–5. However, the precise
relationship between these two processes and how they
contribute to the clinical disease are unclear. APP is a type
1 transmembrane protein and the generation of Aβ occurs
in endosomes from APP molecules upon internalisation
by clathrin-mediated endocytosis6,7. While the functions
of APP are not fully understood, evidence for a role in cell
signalling as one function has been accumulating8,9. As
endocytosis and subsequent proteolytic cleavage is a
fundamental mechanism for downregulating cell surface
receptors, it is possible that the processing of APP and
subsequent production of Aβ might be related to these
signalling activities.
We10, and others11, have identified Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1)
as a key player in AD. Increased expression of Dkk1 has
been shown in post-mortem AD brain and in animal
models of Aβ pathology11, and its expression is induced in
neuronally enriched cultures as an early response to Aβ10.
Dkk1 drives multiple aspects of Aβ-mediated neurotoxi-
city, including synapse loss through effects on Wnt sig-
nalling12–14. Dkk1 is known principally as an inhibitor of
the Wnt-β-catenin, or canonical Wnt, pathway. However,

Dkk1-induced
activation
of
the
non-
canonical Wnt-planar cell polarity (Wnt-PCP) pathway
is also required for Aβ-driven synapse disassembly to
occur14. At synapses, the Wnt-β-catenin and Wnt-PCP
Wnt pathways have opposing actions which, under nor-
mal physiological conditions, work in concert to maintain
synaptic homeostasis15–19. Interestingly, recent evidence
suggests that APP has a role in Wnt signalling9, raising
the possibility of an intimate molecular link between
synapse homeostasis and APP function. As such it is of
great importance to elucidate the role of APP in Wnt
signalling and its impact on synapse stability, and what
effects there might be of Wnt signalling on APP proces-
sing and Aβ production.
Here we provide evidence that APP is a co-activator of
both Wnt-β-catenin and Wnt-PCP signalling through
specific interactions with the Wnt co-receptor proteins
LRP6 (LDL-receptor related protein 6) and Vangl2 (van
Gogh-like 2), respectively. Under conditions that promote
Wnt β-catenin signalling, which enhances synapse stabi-
lity, the Aβ production is reduced. Conversely, activation
of Wnt-PCP, which drives synapse retraction, results in an
increase
in
Aβ
production.
These
data
provide
a
mechanism that directly links Dkk1-induced synapse loss
with raised Aβ production. As Dkk1 expression is induced
by Aβ10,11, there exists a positive feedback loop in which
Aβ enhances its own production by inducing Dkk1, which
then promotes Wnt-PCP activity and further Aβ pro-
duction: succinctly, Aβ synaptotoxicity drives Aβ pro-
duction. Importantly, we demonstrate the in vitro effects
of Aβ can be blocked by antagonising Wnt-PCP with the
drug fasudil and, that when administered peripherally,
the drug also dramatically lowers brain levels of both
soluble and insoluble Aβ in vivo in an amyloid-based
mouse model of AD.
Results
APP potentiates Wnt signalling
It has previously been reported that APP is a compo-
nent of the Wnt-PCP molecular machinery9. To confirm
this, and to investigate any possible role of APP in Wnt
signalling, we used reporter gene assays in HEK293A cells,
with stimulation by Wnt3a (a type-1 pro canonical Wnt)
or by Wnt5a (a type-2 pro non-canonical Wnt) (Fig. 1a,
b). Overexpression of APP alone did not markedly change
the activity of either Wnt signalling pathway. APP did
though potentiate both Wnt3a-driven Wnt-β-catenin
signalling and Wnt5a-driven Wnt-PCP signalling. These
findings confirm the previously reported involvement of
APP in Wnt-PCP signalling, and identify a new role of
APP in Wnt-β-catenin signalling. Expression of APP did
not alter the specificity of pathway activation by Wnt3a
and Wnt5a, which selectively activated Wnt-β-catenin
and Wnt-PCP signalling, respectively.
APP interactions with LRP6 or Vangl2 differentially
modulate Wnt signalling
APP has previously been shown to interact with
Vangl29, a Wnt-PCP-specific co-receptor protein, and
independently has been shown to bind LRP620, a receptor
component of the Wnt-β-catenin pathway21. However, it
is unclear how these APP interactions impact Wnt-PCP
or Wnt-β-catenin signalling activity. Given the impor-
tance of this for our understanding of AD pathology, we
confirmed binding between endogenous APP and LRP6 or
Vangl2 proteins in rat primary cortical neuronal cultures
by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1c), confirming the data
previously obtained by exogenous overexpression of the
proteins in HEK293 cells9,20. We then delineated the
precise binding regions between APP and LRP6 or Vangl2
using an array of overlapping peptides spanning the full
length of human APP695 [25mer peptides, each with a 5 aa
shift] (Fig. 1d). We observed binding of the LRP6 extra-
cellular domain at four sites in the extracellular domain of
APP; two within the E1 domain and two in the E2 domain.
One of these interactions maps to amino acids 555–584,
very close to the β-secretase cleavage site, which lies
between residues 596 and 597. These data are in agree-
ment with the previous report that LRP6 and APP interact
through their extracellular domains20.
Vangl2 binding was observed at a single site in the APP
intracellular domain (Fig. 1e). Notably, the region of APP
to which Vangl2 binds includes the YENPTY motif. This
motif is has previously been identified22 as a binding site
for several proteins known to interact with APP, and is
also a signal for clathrin-mediated endocytosis23.
To determine the functional significance of these direct
physical interactions of APP with LRP6 and Vangl2, we
assessed the effects of LRP6 and Vangl2 on Wnt signalling
in the presence of APP using reporter assays for Wnt-β-
catenin and Wnt-PCP signalling. The ability of APP to
potentiate Wnt-β-catenin signalling in response to Wnt3a
was enhanced by the overexpression of LRP6, and atte-
nuated by Vangl2 (Fig. 1g). Conversely, the ability of APP
to potentiate Wnt-PCP signalling in response to Wnt5a
was enhanced by Vangl2 and attenuated by LRP6 (Fig.
1h). These findings are all consistent with the effects of
APP on Wnt signalling being mediated through interac-
tions with either LRP6 or Vangl2.
Swedish APP differentially affects Wnt-β-catenin and Wnt-
PCP signalling
An involvement of APP in Wnt signalling, which reg-
ulates synapse formation and stability, raises the question
of whether familial AD mutations in APP may impact the
activity of APP in Wnt signalling. Using the reporter gene
assays in HEK293A cells, we compared the effects of the
wild-type form of APP695 with the Swedish mutant form
(KM670/671NL) (APPSwe). In contrast with wild-type

signalling as measured by TCF/LEF transcriptional activity using SuperTOPflash luciferase reporter assay in HEK293A cells; activity was measured in
relative light units (RLU). The enhancement of Wnt-β-catenin signalling was only detectable in cells also overexpressing Wnt3a (a “canonical Wnt”)
and not in the presence of the “non-canonical Wnt”, Wnt5a. b APP overexpression also enhanced Wnt-PCP signalling as measured by AP1

control APP internalisation. g Overexpression of LRP6 enhanced the activity of APP in Wnt-β-catenin signalling as measured by TCF/LEF

 APP which, as before, potentiated both canonical and

of APP antagonised canonical Wnt signalling (Fig. 2a),

greater degree than wild-type APP (APPWT) (Fig. 2b).

Fig. 2 Familal and wild-type forms of APP differentially impact Wnt signalling. a Comparison of SuperTOPflash reporter activity in HEK293A
cells expressing wild-type APP (APPWT) or the Swedish APP variant (APPSwe) indicates that the FAD form of APP is less able to promote Wnt-β-catenin
signalling driven by Wnt3a, irrespective of co-receptor expression. b In contrast, APPSwe enhances Wnt-PCP signalling driven by Wnt5a as measured
by APRE activity, more so in the presence of the Wnt-PCP co-receptor Vangl2. c ELISA quantification of Aβ1–40 production in HEK293A cells
demonstrates that Wnt-PCP components which promote PCP activity increased Aβ1–40 production. Conversely, promotion of Wnt-β-catenin activity
reduced Aβ1–40 production. These data were obtained from the same cultures analysed in (a, b). d Regression analysis from paired data from a and c
(Wnt3a-stimulated) demonstrates a strong negative correlation between the strength of Wnt-β-catenin signalling (SuperTOPflash activity) and ELISA
measures of Aβ1–40 (r2 = 0.8046). e In contrast, regression analysis of the paired data from b, c (Wnt5a-stimulated) showed a strong positive
correlation between Wnt-PCP activation (APRE-luc) and Aβ1–40 production (r2 = 0.9106). f Antagonism of Wnt-β-catenin signalling by Dkk1 was
enhanced by the overexpression of APP in HEK293A cells as measured by SuperTOPflash reporter assays. g Dkk1 inhibition of Wnt-β-catenin
signalling drove the activation of Wnt-PCP as measured by increased AP1 transcriptional activity. This effect of Dkk1 on Wnt-PCP signalling was
enhanced by APP overexpression. Data are plotted as mean + /− standard deviation (n ≥ 3). Statistical significance was determined by one-way
ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey’s test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01); p values are indicated for key comparisons only

 signalling when co-expressed with LRP6 and enhanced
non-canonical further still in the presence of exogenous
Vangl2 (Fig. 2a, b).
Aβ production is intimately linked with Wnt signalling
It is very well established that familial AD mutations of
APP confer increased production of Aβ, and we have
found that the Swedish variant shifts the balance of Wnt
signalling activity away from Wnt-β-catenin towards
Wnt-PCP. This suggests that there may be a direct link
between the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways
and the differential processing of APP. To investigate this,
we assayed the amount of Aβ released into the media of
HEK293A cells expressing APP695 in the absence of
exogenous Wnt or in in the presence of Wnt3a or Wnt5a.
As expected, cells expressing the Swedish mutant form of
APP695 produced much more Aβ than the control wild-
type-expressing cells. In cells expressing either wild-type
or Swedish APP, the amount of Aβ produced was reduced
in cells stimulated with Wnt3a, which promotes Wnt-β-
catenin signalling, whereas Aβ production was enhanced
in cells stimulated with Wnt5a, which promotes Wnt-PCP
signalling (Fig. 2c). Co-expression of LRP6 with APP
reduced the production of Aβ, while co-expression of
Vangl2 with APP led to increased Aβ production (Fig. 2c).
In each case Aβ production was higher under conditions
that favour Wnt-PCP signalling and decreased under
conditions that favour Wnt-β-catenin signalling. Com-
parison of signalling activity and Aβ production under
each of the different conditions showed clearly that Aβ
production was negatively correlated with Wnt-β-catenin
signalling activity (Fig. 2d) and positively correlated with
Wnt-PCP signalling (Fig. 2e).
Functional interactions between APP and Dkk1
As the Wnt signalling modulator Dkk1 has been shown
to be central in Aβ synaptotoxicity, we assessed the effects
of APP on Dkk1-mediated modulation of canonical and
non-canonical signalling activity. Overexpression of APP
enhanced the inhibitory effects of Dkk1 on Wnt3a
induced
Wnt-β-catenin
signalling,
counteracting
the
enhanced activity resulting from APP overexpression and
reducing the IC50 of Dkk1 to 122 ng/mL from 173 ng/mL
in the absence of APP (Fig. 2f)
In contrast, the stimulatory effects of Dkk1 on Wnt-
PCP signalling induced by Wnt5a were enhanced by APP
overexpression, decreasing the EC50 of Dkk1 to 599 ng/
mL from 1405 ng/mL (Fig. 2g). These data suggest that
APP can enhance the potency of Dkk1 to modulate Wnt
signalling.
APP enhances synaptoxicity mediated by Dkk1
Aβ
synaptoxicity
is
Dkk1-dependent12,24
and
also
appears to be APP-dependent25. The results described
above show that APP enhances the effects of Dkk1,
changing the balance of Wnt signalling away from the
Wnt-β-catenin pathway and towards Wnt-PCP signalling.
Given the known differential effects on synapses of Wnt-
β-catenin and Wnt-PCP signalling, this suggests that APP
might mediate the synaptotoxicity of Dkk1. To investigate
this, the numbers of dendritic spines were counted in
primary neuronal cultures from APP+/+ and APP−/−
mice following treatment with Dkk1 or vehicle (PBS) for
3 h. As previously reported, Dkk1-treatment markedly
reduced the number of dendritic spines on APP+/+ neu-
rons (Fig. 3a, b). In contrast, APP-deficiency protected
neurons against the synaptotoxic activity of Dkk1 (Fig. 3a,
b). These findings are consistent with the action of APP as
a modulator of Wnt signalling described above.
Synapse loss and Aβ production are intimately linked and
amenable to pharmacological modulation
The Wnt-PCP signalling pathway acts through RhoA
and ROCK26, and can be inhibited pharmacologically, for
example, with fasudil24, a ROCK inhibitor that is in
clinical use for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm. In
reporter assays performed in HEK293A cells 10 µM fas-
udil completely reversed the stimulatory effect of Dkk1
and of Vangl2 on Wnt-PCP signalling (Fig. 3c). Fasudil
also reversed the stimulatory effect of Vangl2 and Dkk1
on Aβ production in the same cells as determined by
ELISA based quantification of Aβ1–40 levels in the paired
culture media from the same experiments (Fig. 3d).
To investigate the relevance of the findings described
above in a neuronal context, we examined the effects of
fasudil on Dkk1-driven dendritic spine withdrawal and Aβ
production in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons.
Consistent with our previous findings24, treatment with
Dkk1 resulted in substantial loss of dendritic spines,
which was blocked by 10 µM fasudil treatment (Fig. 3e, f).
The amounts of endogenous Aβ species (Aβ1–38, Aβ1–40
and Aβ1–42) secreted into the culture media by these
treated neurons were determined using a multiplex assay
(Fig. 3g). In addition to causing a significant reduction in
the numbers of dendritic spines, Dkk1 treatment also
resulted a substantial increase in levels of all three Aβ
species (Fig. 3g). In the absence of exogenous Dkk1, fas-
udil had little effect on the amounts of Aβ secreted by the
neurons. Notably, in parallel with the protective effect of
fasudil on synapses (Fig. 3e, f), treatment with fasudil
reversed the stimulatory effects of Dkk1 on Aβ production
(Fig. 3g).
Fasudil attenuates Aβ burden in vivo
We
previously
demonstrated
that
fasudil
protects
against both Aβ- and Dkk1-driven synapse loss and cog-
nitive impairment24, and show above that fasudil can
inhibit the production of Aβ by neurons stimulated with

 Dkk1. We therefore investigated whether fasudil might
also attenuate amyloid pathology in vivo. These experi-
ments used the 3xTG-AD transgenic mouse model27,
which express human APPSwe, as well as mutant human
tau (MAPT-P301L) and mutant presenilin-1 (PSEN1-
M146V). In this model27, Aβ pathology is readily detect-
able at 12 months of age, and abundant in 18-month old
mice, which show substantial soluble and insoluble amy-
loid load in brain, including plaque-like, Aβ-immunor-
eactive deposits (Fig. 4a).
Mice were treated at 18 months of age with 10 mg/kg
fasudil or with vehicle (PBS), administered daily by i.p.
injection, for 14 days. One day after the last injection, brains
were collected, sagitally bisected, and fixed or snap frozen
for subsequent histological and biochemical analyses. The
rostral poles of snap frozen hemi-brains were homogenised
and the levels of soluble Aβ1–40 measured by ELISA. Ani-
mals receiving fasudil had significantly lower soluble Aβ1–40
levels than controls (Fig. 4b). Fixed hemi-brains were sec-
tioned and immunostained using the anti-APP/Aβ anti-
body, 6E10. IHC shows that administration of fasudil for
just 14 days substantially reduced amyloid plaque burden,
across all cortical brain regions examined, and in hippo-
campal regions CA1 and subiculum (Fig. 4c, d).
Discussion
Loss of hippocampal synapses is pronounced in early
Alzheimer’s disease and detectable in individuals with
mild cognitive impairment28,29. The reduction in synapse
number correlates with declining cognitive ability, thus a
treatment that reduces or prevents pathological synapse
loss would be expected to slow or halt cognitive decline.
Indeed, protecting dendritic spines and maintaining
structural plasticity has been shown to provide cognitive
resilience30. Aβ is potently synaptotoxic, by understanding
the mechanisms driving this property it may be possible
to intervene to prevent synapse loss and preserve cogni-
tion, We have previously shown that Aβ-driven synapse
loss is Dkk1-dependent and requires activation of the
non-canonical Wnt-planar cell polarity pathway24. Here
we extend this to show that Dkk1-driven synapse loss is
also APP-dependent, with APP acting as a component of
the Wnt-PCP pathway, co-activating Wnt-PCP through a
direct protein-protein interaction with the Frizzled co-
receptor protein Vangl2.
Dkk1 also modulates canonical Wnt-β-catenin signalling
though, contrary to its effect on Wnt-PCP, it antagonises
canonical Wnt signalling activity. Dkk1 does this by
binding to and removing LRP6 from the canonical-Wnt
co-receptor complex thereby preventing canonical Wnt
activity31,32. Here we have shown that APP is also a
component of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway, and
that through a direct protein-protein interaction with the
Frizzled co-receptor LRP6, in the absence of Dkk1, acts to
promote canonical Wnt-βcatenin activity. It is now well
established that synapse formation, stability and dis-
assembly are Wnt regulated processes16,18,19. Activation of
Wnt-β-catenin signalling stabilises synapses and promotes
the formation of new ones, while Wnt-PCP signalling
destabilises synapses and promotes the loss of synaptic
connections. With APP acting as a co-activator of both
Wnt signalling pathways and being expressed at synapses,
APP can then be thought of as part a molecular switch
mechanism, controlled by Dkk1, which regulates processes
that
determine
if
a
particular
synapse
should
be
strengthened or removed. In this context, the properties of
the Swedish familial AD form of APP we observed on Wnt
signalling have particular interest. We found that the
Swedish variant was a more potent co-activator of Wnt-
PCP signalling than wild-type APP and, unlike wild-type
APP, which co-activates Wnt β-catenin signalling, APPSwe
suppressed this branch of Wnt. These effects of Swedish
APP compared to wild-type APP would each act in the
direction that would reduce synapse stability and favour
synapse disassembly. This then suggests that altered co-
activation of Wnt signalling by APPSwe could contribute to
synapse
loss
by
both
reducing
synaptogenesis
and
enhancing synapse withdrawal, at least in those familial
cases of AD carrying the Swedish mutant form of APP. If
this extends to other FAD forms of APP it is of importance
for our understanding of the early-onset form of AD due
to mutations in APP.

mouse cortical neurons with Dkk1 (200 ng/mL) induced significant dendritic spine loss as visualised by DiO labelling. In APP−/− neurons, dendritic
spine density was similar to wild type, while Dkk1-mediated synapse loss was significantly reduced. c Fasudil exerted dose dependent inhibition of
Wnt-PCP activity as measured by APRE reporter assay in HEK293A cells. d Inhibition of Wnt-PCP activation by fasudil also attenuated Aβ1–40
production in paired supernatants from (c). e, f Fasudil (10 µM) attenuated Dkk1 (200 ng/mL, 18 h) mediated dendritic spine loss in rat primary rat

 Amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs in endosomes,
following clathrin-mediated endocytosis6,7, and endoso-
mal trafficking of FAD mutant forms of APP, including
APPSwe, has been shown to differ from that of wild-type
APP33. Wnt-PCP signalling is also tightly linked to
clathrin-mediated endocytosis34. This suggests that the
altered trafficking of APPSwe, which results in enhanced
Aβ production may also be responsible for the enhanced
co-activation of Wnt-PCP signalling by this variant.
Consistent with this is the data we present here that Aβ
production correlates positively with Wnt-PCP signalling
activity and inversely with Wnt-β-catenin signalling. We
would propose then that the signalling activity of APP and
the generation of Aβ are likely interrelated processes.
Under conditions that favour synapse stabilisation, i.e.,
when APP co-activates canonical Wnt, APP is non-
amyloidogenically
processed
and
Aβ
production
is
reduced, conversely under conditions favouring retrac-
tion, when APP is acting to promote Wnt-PCP, it is more
likely to be amyloidogenically processed and Aβ produc-
tion is increased.
Given our data indicate that canonical Wnt favours α-
secretase
cleavage,
and
non-canonical
Wnt
activity
favours β-secretase cleavage of APP. It is of interest that
Parr et al.35 have shown that the expression of BACE1, the
major β-secretase is negatively regulated by canonical
Wnt activity and Wan et al.36, that the expression of
ADAM10, the major α-secretase, is positively regulated by
canonical Wnt signalling. These observations indicate
that the expression of the major APP secretases are
regulated in a manner that is in keeping with our data and
indicates that such process would act to compliment each
other.
We10,24, and others11,12 have previously shown that
multiple aspects of Aβ toxicity are mediated by its ability
to induce Dkk1 expression. While Dkk1 has many
important developmental functions37, it is barely expres-
sed in the brain of young adults. Notably, Dkk1 expression
has been found to increase with age, and the knockout of
Dkk1 in adult mouse brain has been found to counteract
normal age-related cognitive decline through restoration
of neurogenesis and increased dendritic complexity38.
These properties make Dkk1 an attractive target for
therapeutic intervention. In addition to many neurotoxic
properties of Dkk1, we have shown that Dkk1 potently
stimulates the neuronal production of Aβ. Given that Aβ
drives
the
neuronal
expression
of
Dkk110–12,
this
demonstrates the existence of a positive feedback loop,
which we present schematically in Fig. 3h. In this model,
Aβ synaptotoxicity drives further Aβ production through
a process which is dependent on both Dkk1 and APP and
the co-receptor proteins LRP6 and Vangl2. While other
mechanisms of Aβ toxicity, over and above those due to
effects on Wnt signalling, most certainly exist, we would
suggest that blocking this feedback loop offers a potential
mechanism through Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology
could be effectively modified.
The Dkk1-mediated toxic effects of Aβ are depend on
activation of the PCP branch of Wnt signalling10,24. Wnt-
PCP itself has two arms, signalling through c-Jun N-
terminal kinase (JNK1) and c-Jun, or through RhoA and
Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). Aβ neurocytotoxicity is
dependent on the JNK/c-Jun arm of the Wnt-PCP path-
way and requires gene transcription10, while Aβ synap-
totoxicity is mediated predominantly through Dkk1 and
the Rho/ROCK arm of the Wnt-PCP pathway24. We
previously demonstrated that inhibition of Wnt-PCP
signalling using fasudil, a ROCK inhibitor, protects
against both Aβ- and Dkk1-driven synapse loss in vitro,
and in vivo against acute Aβ-induced cognitive impair-
ment24. Similarly, it has been reported that fasudil pro-
tected against dendritic atrophy in an AD mouse model39,
and against hippocampal neuronal death induced by
intracranial injection of Aβ40. Others have shown that, in
young AD model mice, Aβ production can be reduced by
inhibition of Rho41 or ROCK42. And in support of asses-
sing fasudil further as a potential treatment for AD not
only does the drug to reduce Aβ production from neu-
ronally expressed human APP42, supporting of our own
data here, but it has also been shown to ameliorate tau
pathology, albeit in models of other forms of dementia,
that like AD, include pathological tau aggregates43. That
fasudil is a pan ROCK inhibitor, with little difference in
selectivity towards either ROCK1 or ROCK2, may not be
problematic given both forms of ROCK have been shown
to have similar effects on APP processing42,44.
These data are consistent with our findings that fasudil
treatment greatly reduced both soluble and insoluble Aβ
burden. Even in mouse models engineered to deposit
amyloid aggressively, accumulation of Aβ is slow. At the
time of treatment, the mice in our experiments had very
substantial amyloid deposits that had progressively accu-
mulated over 18 months. Against this timescale, the
magnitude of the response to treatment is consistent with
rapid turnover of Aβ which, in the disease state, is
counterbalanced by accelerating production of Aβ driven
by positive feedback.
It is over 30 years since the APP gene was molecularly
cloned and the protein it encoded for found to have
characteristics of a glycosylated cell surface receptor1.
Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the
role of APP as a receptor and as a cell adhesion protein
(reviewed in8 and45–47, respectively). The data we present
here indicate that APP, if not a true receptor protein
per se, can act as a component of both the Wnt-β-catenin
and Wnt-PCP co-receptor protein complexes. As Wnt-β-
Elliott et al. Translational Psychiatry  (2018) 8:179 
Page 9 of 13
 catenin and Wnt-PCP are regarded, respectively, as pro-
moting cell adhesion and cell separation this may
underpin many of the reports suggesting APP acts as a
neuronal adhesion molecule and may, in part at least,
account for the apparently contradictory reports con-
cerning APP and synapse stability, given an ability to act
in both arms of Wnt signalling.
Due to the recent series of failures of therapeutics
targeting Aβ in clinical trials, the amyloid cascade
hypothesis has come under intense criticism. The exis-
tence of a positive feedback loop driving Aβ production
may provide a partial explanation for clinical trial failures
because of residual Aβ leading to re-accumulation of Aβ.
Indeed, it is predicted that there will be a rebound effect
unless normal or near normal Aβ concentrations are
achieved. While our data largely support of the amyloid
cascade hypothesis, the findings reported here indicate
that a central component of Alzheimer’s disease pathol-
ogy is the physiological function of APP rather than Aβ
production per se. Further, it highlights the downstream
target of Aβ and modulator of the APP-Wnt activity,
Dkk1, as key element, and a possibly more amenable
therapeutic target for combatting AD than Aβ has thus
far proven to be.
Methods
Genetically modified mice
APP-KO
mice
(B6.129S7-Ap
ptm1Dbo/J)
were
obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained on
the C57Bl/6 background. Natural matings (APP KO x
APP KO or C57BL/6 x C57BL/6 to provide KO and wild-
type material respectively) were set-up, and mating plugs
were checked. On E16.5 the brains from APP KO or
C57BL/6 wild-type embryos were collected. These were
dissected out on ice-cold PBS (-ve calcium) and the cortex
and hippocampus collected to provide neurons for culture
described below.
3xTG-AD mice were generated by the La Ferla group27
and were obtained from Jackson Laboratory Animals on a
C57BL6/129 genetic background. The line harbor three
mutant human transgenes, APP (KM670/671NL), MAPT
(P301L) and PSEN1 (M146V). All mice were housed and
treated in compliance with UK Home Office legislation
under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986.
Preparation of rodent cortical neurons
Neurons were prepared from E18 embryonic Sprague
Dawley rat or E16.5 mouse cortices as described pre-
viously (Sellers et al., 2017). Briefly, cells were seeded on
16 mm glass coverslips (VWR) coated with poly-D-lysine
(0.2 mg/ml, Sigma). Cells were cultured in neurobasal
supplemented with B27 supplement, 0.2 mM glutamine
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher). Cultures
were maintained at least 21 days in vitro (DIV) before use.
Pharmacological treatments of neuronal cultures
All pharmacological treatments were performed in
artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF): 125 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM KCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 11 mM
glucose, 5 mM Hepes, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM MgCl2,
and 0.2 mM APV. Neuronal cultures were pre-treated
with inhibitor compounds for 30 min prior to application
of Dkk1 recombinant protein (R&D systems). Fasudil
(SelleckChem) were dissolved in water and used at con-
centrations indicated in the text.
DiO labelling, imaging and quantification of dendritic
spines
After treatment neurons were fixed in 2% paraf-
ormaldehyde and fluorescently labelled using Vybrant™
DiO
Cell-Labeling
Solution
(Life
technologies),
as
described previously48 and mounted onto glass slides
using mowiol mounting media.
Images were acquired with a Leica SP-5 confocal micro-
scope using a ×63 oil-immersion objective (Leica, N.A. 1.4)
as z-series, with an optical slice thickness of 0.5 µm, imaging
parameters remained constant throughout. To identify
hidden dendritic spines, the resulting pictures were then
reconstructed as a 2D maximum projection. Spine numbers
was quantified using imageJ from eight neurons selected at
random (per condition, performed in duplicate), and
expressed as spine density/ 100 µm length. Analysis was
performed blind to condition. Cultures undergoing direct
comparison were stained simultaneously and imaged with
the same acquisition parameters. Data are expressed as
spine density/10 µM, error bars represent standard devia-
tion from a minimum of 3 independent experiments (10
neurons/ experiment selected at random).
Luciferase Reporter assays
SuperTOPflash and APRE-luc (pGL4.44[luc2P/AP1 RE/
Hygro], Promega), reporter gene assays, conducted in cell
lines, were performed as previously described49. All other
constructs used in this study including Wnt3a, Wnt5a,
Vangl2 and LRP6 were expressed in versions of pcDNA 3.1
(Invitrogen). Briefly, HEK293A cells were transfected with
Fugene 6 (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Cells were incubated for a minimum incubation of
18 h to allow for sufficient expression and read using One-
Glo or Dual Glo reagents (Promega, UK). All reporter assay
data are plotted as mean + /− standard deviation (n ≥ 3).
Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA
and post-hoc Tukey’s test (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01); p values are
indicated for key comparisons only.

 Aβ quantification
Conditioned medium for analysis was spun at 800 × g to
remove cellular debris, and supernatant stored at −20 °C
until use. Human amyloid-β(1–40) production in cell
lines was measured using a quantikine ELISA kit (R&D
systems). Amyloid-β production (1–38, 1–40, 1–42) in
primary rat neurons was measured using a multiplexed
immunoassay (Meso Scale Diagnostics). All assays were
performed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Data are plotted as mean+/− standard deviation (n ≥ 3).
Statistical
significance
was
determined
by
one-way
ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey’s test (*p < 0.05; **p <

Peptide array mapping
Peptide libraries spanning the full length of APP were
produced by automatic SPOT synthesis and synthesised
on continuous cellulose membrane supports on What-
man 50 cellulose membranes using Fmoc-chemistry with
the
AutoSpot-Robot
ASS
222
(Intavis
Bioanalytical
Instruments AG, Köln, Germany) as we have previously
described50. Arrays were incubated with recombinant
human LRP6 (Fc-chimera, R&D systems) or total lysate
from HEK293A cells overexpressing HA-tagged Vangl2.
Binding was visualised using either an anti-HA tag
(Abcam, ab9110) antibody or anti-Human IgG Fc Cross-
Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, DyLight 680 (Thermo
Fisher, SA5-10138) and imaged on a Chemidoc system
with Image Lab software (BioRad).
Immunoprecipitation
Lysates were extracted from rat neurons (21 d.i.c.) in
lysis buffer [25 mM Hepes, 2.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaC1,
50 mM NaF, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10% (v/v)
glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.5, containing
Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets
(Roche)] as previously described50 with 10% of total lysate
being retained as input. Immunoprecipitation was per-
formed using SureBeads™ Protein G Magnetic Beads
(BioRad) with either an anti-LRP6 antibody (Abcam,
ab75358) or anti-Vangl2 antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-46561)
following
manufacturers
guidelines.
Samples
were
resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting. APP
was visualised using an anti-APP rabbit antisera 369 (a
kind gift from Professor Joseph Buxbaum)51, using the
appropriate fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody
and imaged on a Chemidoc system with Image Lab soft-
ware (BioRad).
Amyloid burden in vivo
Animals
Triple Transgenic mice carrying Swedish FAD APP695,
PSEN M146V and MAPT P301L were obtained from The
Jackson Laboratory, bred and aged to 18 months, N = 17
(9 female, 8 male). Fasudil HCL (10 mg/kg) or an
equivalent vol of vehicle (0.9% saline) was administered
via intraperitoneal injection once a day for 14 consecutive
days. On the final day, the animals received a further
injection (number 15) and then were sacrificed 1 h later by
cervical dislocation, brains rapidly removed, hemisected,
half being flash frozen on liquid 2-methylbutane at −55 °C
for biochemical analysis and the remaining half post-fixed
in 4% PFA for immunohistochemical staining. Tissue
samples. Rostral pole of frozen frontal lobe were cut
weighed and homogenised on ice in a 8 x volume of PBS
to which protease inhibitors (Roche), phosphatase inhi-
bitors (Phos-STOP), NaF (10 mM), and β-glycerol phos-
phate (2 mM) had been added. Of the N = 17 mice 10 (4
male, 6 female) received vehicle and 7 (4 male, 3 female)
fasudil. The homogenates were subjected to centrifuga-
tion at 100,000 g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant (S1)
and pellet (P1) were collected and stored with at −80 °C.
Plaque labelling and Aβ densitometry
APP immunohistochemistry, 30 µm-thick sagittal sec-
tions from fixed brains were immunostained as previously
described52,53, using the anti-Aβ antibody, 6E10 (Covance
Cat: 803001). Animals were perfused through the left
ventricle with saline solution, followed by 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for
15 min. Brains were removed and cryoprotected by
soaking in 30% sucrose solution in phosphate buffer until
they sank. Parallel series of 30 µm thick coronal sections
were obtained in a freezing microtome. Sections from
vehicle and fasudil treated animals were processed with
the same solutions and processing times. Sections were
rinsed in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 225 mM NaCl
(TBS). Antigen retrieval for APP/Aβ detection was per-
formed by incubating the sections for 5 min in formic
acid. Tissue peroxidase was inactivated by incubating in
10% methanol and 10% hydrogen peroxide in TBS for
30 min. After three washes in TBS, sections were incu-
bated for 2 h in blocking solution (10% normal goat
serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in TBS), and then for 16 h at
4 °C with mouse anti-APP/Aβ antibody, clone 6E10 at a 1/
500 dilution (Covance Cat: 803001). Sections were rinsed
in TBS, then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse
IgG at 1/1000 dilution for 1 h, and then incubated with
the Vectastain ABC HRP kit (Vector laboratories) fol-
lowing manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were subse-
quently developed in 0.05% 3′−3′ diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in Tris-HCl buffer,
pH 8.0 containing 0.003% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma-
Aldrich) for 5 min. Immunoreagents were diluted in 1%
goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 in TBS. Sections were
mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried, and finally
dehydrated in graded alcohols, cleared in xylene and
coverslipped. Control sections were treated with the same

 protocol but omitting the primary antibody. A mean of 25
images from each brain were acquired using the same
exposure settings. The captured images were normalised
into 8-bits grey scale employing Adobe Photoshop CS4
v11.0 and opened in ImageJ v1.48 software. The threshold
being set for each image using the histogram mean at the
same standard deviation. To eliminate background the
particle size pixel was set at 20-infinity pixel. Plaque-like
deposits were quantified in frontal, temporal, parietal and
entorhinal cortex (grouped as cortex) and in CA1 and
subiculum (grouped as hippocampus) employing the
“analyze particles” plug-in for Image J v1.48 software.
Amyloid burden was calculated as the area occupied by
the immunoreactive plaque-like structures expressed as %
of area. Mean values are mean ± SEM (Vehicle, n = 9 and
Fasudil, n = 7). Statistical analysis was performed with
Student’s t test comparing Fasudil vs. vehicle treated mice.
Analysis was performed blind to condition
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS v22
as indicated in the text. Comparisons from two samples
were performed using students T test and multiple
comparisons effects were probed by 1- or 2-way ANOVAs
with a post-hoc Tukey correction. Error bars represent
standard deviation, where n represents independent
experiments.
