Abstract: We conducted a health impact assessment (HIA) of cycling network expansions in seven Eu-
ropean cities. We modeled the association between cycling network length and cycling mode share and
estimated health impacts of the expansion of cycling networks. First, we performed a non-linear least
square regression to assess the relationship between cycling network length and cycling mode share for 167
European cities. Second, we conducted a quantitative HIA for the seven cities of different scenarios (S)
assessing how an expansion of the cycling network [i.e. 10% (S1); 50% (S2); 100% (S3), and all-streets
(S4)] would lead to an increase in cycling mode share and estimated mortality impacts thereof.
We
quantified mortality impacts for changes in physical activity, air pollution and traffic incidents. Third,
we conducted a cost-benefit analysis. The cycling network length was associated with a cycling mode
share of up to 24.7% in European cities. The all-streets scenario (S4) produced greatest benefits through
increases in cycling for London with 1,210 premature deaths (95% CI: 447-1,972) avoidable annually, fol-
lowed by Rome (433; 95% CI: 170-695), Barcelona (248; 95% CI: 86-410), Vienna (146; 95% CI: 40-252),
Zurich (58; 95% CI: 16-100) and Antwerp (7; 95% CI: 3-11). The largest cost-benefit ratios were found
for the 10% increase in cycling networks (S1). If all 167 European cities achieved a cycling mode share
of 24.7% over 10,000 premature deaths could be avoided annually. In European cities, expansions of
cycling networks were associated with increases in cycling and estimated to provide health and economic
benefits.

ABSTRACT 
1 
We conducted a health impact assessment (HIA) of cycling network expansions in 
2 
seven European cities. We modeled the association between cycling network length and 
3 
cycling mode share and estimated health impacts of the expansion of cycling networks. 
4 
First, we performed a non-linear least square regression to assess the relationship 
5 
between cycling network length and cycling mode share for 167 European cities. 
6 
Second, we conducted a quantitative HIA for the seven cities of different scenarios (S) 
7 
assessing how an expansion of the cycling network [i.e. 10% (S1); 50% (S2); 100% 
8 
(S3), and all-streets (S4)] would lead to an increase in cycling mode share and estimated 
9 
mortality impacts thereof. We quantified mortality impacts for changes in physical 
10 
activity, air pollution and traffic incidents. Third, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis. 
11 
The cycling network length was associated with a cycling mode share of up to 24.7% in 
12 
European cities. The all-streets scenario (S4) produced greatest benefits through 
13 
increases in cycling for London with 1,210 premature deaths (95% CI: 447-1,972) 
14 
avoidable annually, followed by Rome (433; 95% CI: 170-695), Barcelona (248; 95% 
15 
CI: 86-410), Vienna (146; 95% CI: 40-252), Zurich (58; 95% CI: 16-100) and Antwerp 
16 
(7; 95% CI: 3-11). The largest cost-benefit ratios were found for the 10% increase in 
17 
cycling networks (S1). If all 167 European cities achieved a cycling mode share of 
18 
24.7% over 10,000 premature deaths could be avoided annually. In European cities, 
19 
expansions of cycling networks were associated with increases in cycling and estimated 
20 
to provide health and economic benefits.

1. INTRODUCTION 
25 
There is increasing awareness of the adverse effects of the car-centric urban mobility 
26 
plans of previous decades (Nieuwenhuijsen and Khreis, 2016). Concerns relate to 
27 
contemporary sedentarism, ecological issues of air and noise pollution, greenhouse gas 
28 
emissions and the loss of natural outdoor environments, but also to economic issues of 
29 
space scarcity, congestion costs and financing infrastructure (Khreis et al., 2016; 
30 
Marqués et al., 2015). 
31 
 
32 
Promoting a mode shift to cycling for transport has been proposed as a promising 
33 
strategy in urban environments to overcome these issues (Mueller et al., 2015). Cycling 
34 
can increase total physical activity (PA) levels (Foley et al., 2015; Goodman et al., 
35 
2014; Sahlqvist et al., 2013), and is a non-emitting mode of transport. However, to 
36 
facilitate a shift to cycling, well-designed and safe infrastructure is needed (Mertens et 
37 
al., 2016a; Pucher et al., 2010). 
38 
 
39 
Recent research evidence indicates positive associations between cycling network 
40 
length and cycling mode share (i.e. percentage of all trips done cycling) (Buehler and 
41 
Dill, 2016; Habib et al., 2014; Marqués et al., 2015; Schoner and Levinson, 2014; 
42 
Schoner et al., 2015). In fact, designated cycling infrastructure is a crucial factor for 
43 
preferring cycling for transport (de Geus et al., 2008; Heesch et al., 2015; Mertens et al., 
44 
2016a, 2016b). By protecting against motor traffic, designated cycling infrastructure is 
45 
especially important for attracting new cyclists (Mertens et al., 2016b; Sallis et al., 
46 
2013). Thus, expansions of designated cycling networks may be a strategy to increase 
47 
cycling for transport, which in return may contribute to improvements in public health.  
48 
 6 
 
Until now, however, the exposure response relationship between cycling network and 
49 
cycling mode share in European cities is unknown. Therefore, we assessed (1) the 
50 
association between cycling network length (km) and cycling mode share (%) and (2) 
51 
how an increase in cycling mode share might alter expected mortality in terms of 
52 
changes in PA, air pollution and traffic incidents. We also estimated the cost-benefit 
53 
trade-off between cycling network expansions and monetized health benefits. 
54 
 
55 
2. METHODS 
56 
2.1 Association between cycling network and cycling mode share 
57 
2.1.1 Non-linear least square regression 
58 
Data preparations steps and coding are documented in a public GitHub repository 
59 
(Salmon and Mueller, 2017). We obtained data on population size, cycling mode share 
60 
and cycling network length for 167 cities located in 11 European countries (4 Austria, 7 
61 
Belgium, 2 Denmark, 20 France, 47 Germany, 15 Italy, 23 Netherlands, 14 Spain, 9 
62 
Sweden, 2 Switzerland, 24 United Kingdom) (Table S.1). Amongst the 167 cities were 
63 
the seven case study cities of the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport 
64 
Approaches (PASTA) project (i.e. Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Rome, Örebro, 
65 
Vienna, Zurich) (Fig. 1) (Gerike et al., 2016). The other 160 cities were chosen based 
66 
on (1) their geographic representativeness of Northern, Central and Southern Europe, 
67 
(2) population size ≥100,000 persons, (3) the availability of mode share data not being 
68 
older than 2006 and (4) the availability of spatial boundaries. 
69 
 
70 
Data on  mode share and population size were obtained through the European Platform 
71 
on Mobility Management (EPOMM) Modal Split Tool (TEMS) (EPOMM, 2011). 
72 
Spatial administrative municipality boundaries were obtained from the Database of 
73 
 7 
 
Global Administrative Areas (GADM) (Hijmans, 2009), the UK data service (Office for 
74 
National Statistics, 2011), and the Swedish lantmäteriet (Swedish Ministry of Enterprise 
75 
and Innovation., 2016). We used OpenStreetMap (OSM) to compute cycling network 
76 
lengths for all 167 cities (Table 1) using labels of designated, non-shared cycling ways 
77 
(Table S.2) (OpenStreetMap contributors, 2017). We also computed the street network 
78 
length (km) for the PASTA cities. Analyses were conducted in R (version 3.1.1) (Table 
79 
S.3) and Microsoft Excel.  
80 
 
81 
We standardized the computed cycling network length of the 167 cities by population 
82 
size. We used ‘cycling network km/ 100,000 persons’ as the explanatory variable and 
83 
performed a non-linear least square regression (i.e. Gompertz growth model) to 
84 
calculate the corresponding cycling mode share (%) with 𝑦(𝑡) = 𝑎𝑒−𝑏𝑒−𝑐𝑡, where a is 
85 
the asymptote (i.e. maximal cycling mode share associated with cycling network), b sets 
86 
the displacement along the x-axis and c sets the displacement along the y-axis (i.e. 
87 
growth rate), 𝑡 is the cycling network km/ 100,000 persons. We assumed that the 
88 
explanatory properties of cycling network being associated with cycling mode share are 
89 
non-linear (i.e. city-specific sensitivity to cycling network expansions in the process of 
90 
becoming cycle-friendly and users starting to appreciate the increased connectivity) and 
91 
limited (i.e. covariate dependence). We added bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) 
92 
based on the empirical 0.025-quantile and 0.975-quantile of the distribution resulting 
93 
from 1,000 bootstrap samples.

2.2 Health impact assessment  
97 
We performed a health impact assessment (HIA) for the PASTA cities to estimate how 
98 
an increase in cycling might impact public health. Baseline demographic, transport and 
99 
mortality data were available on city level (i.e. total population) through the PASTA 
100 
project (Table 1, Tables S.4-S.14) (Dons et al., 2015; Gerike et al., 2016). 
101 
 
102 
2.2.1 Scenarios 
103 
Across different scenarios (S), we assessed how the cycling mode share might change 
104 
with an increase in the cycling network length by 10% (S1); 50% (S2); 100% (S3); and 
105 
if all streets (km/ 100,000 persons) of the city provided designated cycling infrastructure 
106 
(S4 – all-streets).  
107 
 
108 
2.2.2 Health impact assessment model 
109 
The new cycling trips were assumed to be shifted from previous car (25%) and public 
110 
transport (75%) trips (Rojas-Rueda et al., 2016), to have a distance of 5 km and being 
111 
traveled at a speed of 13 km/h [we considered this distance not exceeding the 
112 
willingness to cycle at a speed requiring a light effort (Ainsworth et al., 2011; Rabl and 
113 
de Nazelle, 2012)]. The walking share was assumed to stay constant. We estimated the 
114 
impact on all-cause mortality due to changes in PA, air pollution exposure for the 
115 
cyclist and the risk for fatal traffic incidents. Baseline data on all-cause mortality, PA 
116 
and air pollution levels as well as traffic fatalities were collected for all seven cities 
117 
(Tables S.4-S.14). 95% CIs for the overall impact were based on the pooled standard 
118 
deviation (SD) of PA, air pollution and fatal traffic incidents. We assumed the mortality 
119 
risk to be normally distributed.  
120 
 
121 
122 
 9 
 
2.2.2.1 Physical activity 
123 
Metabolic equivalents of task (METs) were used as a measure of energy expenditure 
124 
during PA. We calculated the gain in marginal METs for persons substituting car and 
125 
public transport trips with cycling considering baseline PA levels (Tables S.5-S.11). A 
126 
public transport trip was assumed to include a 10 minute walk to public transport 
127 
(Rojas-Rueda et al., 2012). We assigned the new bicycle trip 6.8 METs (Ainsworth et 
128 
al., 2011; WHO. Regional Office for Europe, 2014a), and the 10 minute walk to public 
129 
transport 3.5 METs (Ainsworth et al., 2011).  
130 
 
131 
The association between PA and mortality was quantified using a curvilinear exposure 
132 
response function (ERF) (Relative Risk (RR) = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.76-0.85 per 11 MET-
133 
h/week), applying a 0.25 power transformation (Woodcock et al., 2011). We calculated 
134 
the RR and the population attributable fraction (PAF) for both baseline PA and gained 
135 
PA. The estimated preventable deaths for current PA were subtracted from estimated 
136 
preventable deaths for the additional PA.  
137 
 
138 
2.2.2.2 Air pollution exposure cyclist 
139 
Particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of ≤2.5 μg/m3 (PM2.5) is a commonly used 
140 
proxy for air pollution from motor transport (Table S.12) (Mueller et al., 2015). We 
141 
considered the altered air pollution exposure for persons shifting from car or public 
142 
transport (including a 10 minute walk) to cycling. PM2.5 concentration to which car 
143 
drivers, public transport users, pedestrians and cyclists are exposed to were set 2.5, 1.9, 
144 
1.9 and 2.0 times higher, respectively, than background concentrations (Table S.13) (de 
145 
Nazelle et al., 2017). Ventilation rates for different leisure and transport activities were 
146 
available from previous assessments (Rojas-Rueda et al., 2016, 2012). We calculated 
147 
 10 
 
the daily inhaled PM2.5 dose (μg/m3/24-h) stratified by activity and the total dose 
148 
(μg/m3/24-h) stratified by transport mode. We calculated the equivalent PM2.5 dose 
149 
difference between cycling and motor transport (de Hartog et al., 2010). We used a 
150 
linear ERF (RR=1.07; 95% CI: 1.04-1.09 per 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 annual mean) to quantify 
151 
the association between PM2.5 exposure and mortality (WHO. Regional Office for 
152 
Europe, 2014b). We calculated the corresponding RR and PAF. No societal co-benefits 
153 
of expected air pollution reductions with a mode shift to cycling were considered. 
154 
 
155 
2.2.2.3 Traffic incidents 
156 
Traffic fatalities were estimated based on injury records and distance traveled. For each 
157 
transport mode the risk for a fatal traffic incident per billion kilometers traveled was 
158 
estimated using the reported annual average number of fatalities and kilometers traveled 
159 
(Table S.14). We calculated the RR for a fatal incident for a 5 km cycling trip and 
160 
compared this risk to a car and public transport trip (including a 10 minute walk) of the 
161 
same distance. 
162 
 
163 
2.2.2.4 Sensitivity analyses 
164 
As sensitivity analyses, we assumed the new cycling trips to be shifted by 75% from car 
165 
and by 25% from public transport trips (Table S.15). We also applied a safety-in-
166 
numbers effect (i.e. a less than proportional increase in traffic incidents with increases 
167 
in cycling) using the summary coefficient of 0.43 for cycle volume (Elvik and 
168 
Bjørnskau, 2017) (Table S.16). Finally, we performed a HIA for all 167 cities, 
169 
supposing achievement of the maximal cycling mode share predicted by our model (i.e. 
170 
24.7%). For model inputs, we used the mean of the PASTA city data for transport, 
171 
exposures and mortality (Tables S.17-S.19).  
172 
 11 
 
2.3 Cost-benefit analysis 
173 
We estimated economic costs of cycling network expansions and compared them to 
174 
estimated economic benefits of avoided premature mortality. Following the example of 
175 
the Netherlands, where cycling infrastructure is commonly well-developed, we assumed 
176 
that each 1 km of cycling infrastructure would cost € 2 million, which were estimated 
177 
costs for reconstructing a road with mixed traffic (Schepers et al., 2015). An additional 
178 
€ 4,000 per km/ year were considered for maintenance purposes (Schepers et al., 2015). 
179 
We considered a 5-year buildup of health benefits and a discounting rate of 5% (WHO. 
180 
Regional Office for Europe, 2014a). We applied a time horizon of 30 years (Schepers et 
181 
al., 2015), as strategic transport planning typically plans for 20-40 years ahead (Litman, 
182 
2014). We monetized health benefits by applying country-specific value of statistical 
183 
life (VoSL) estimates (i.e. 3,202,968 € for Spain to 7,236,492 € for Switzerland) (Table 
184 
S.20) (WHO. Regional Office for Europe, 2014a). No de-congestion or other benefits 
185 
were monetized.  
186 
 
187 
3. RESULTS 
188 
3.1 Association between cycling network distance and cycling mode share 
189 
The estimated non-linear association between cycling network size and cycling mode 
190 
share in 167 European cities is described in Fig. 2. According to our model and dataset, 
191 
a cycling network of 315 km/ 100,000 persons was associated with a maximal cycling 
192 
mode share of 24.7% (99.9% of asymptotic value).  
193 
 
194 
Regarding the PASTA cities, Örebro and Antwerp showed to have the largest 
195 
standardized cycling network lengths (i.e. 260 and 95 km/ 100,000 persons, 
196 
respectively) followed by Vienna, Zurich, London, Barcelona and Rome (Table 1). 
197 
 12 
 
Likewise, Örebro and Antwerp had the largest cycling mode share at baseline (25% and 
198 
23%, respectively) followed by Vienna, Zurich, London, Barcelona and Rome (Table 
199 
2). According to our model, the PASTA cities, except Örebro and Antwerp, had great 
200 
potential to increase their cycling mode share through cycling network expansions, even 
201 
though growth rates were expected to vary depending on baseline cycling network 
202 
length and corresponding mode share. Because our model caps the cycling mode share 
203 
at 24.7%, no increase in cycling was expected for Örebro as at baseline already 25% of 
204 
all trips were carried out cycling. Also in Antwerp where already 23% of all trips were 
205 
done cycling, the cycling network length would need to be doubled to achieve a 1% 
206 
increase in cycling mode share (Table 3).  
207 
 
208 
3.2 Estimated health impacts 
209 
The PASTA cities were estimated to benefit from an increase in cycling, except for 
210 
Örebro, and Antwerp benefiting only to a small extent (Table 4). The all-streets 
211 
scenario (S4) produced the greatest health benefits through increases in cycling for 
212 
London with 1,210 premature deaths (95% CI: 447-1,972) avoided each year, followed 
213 
by Rome (433; 95% CI: 170-695), Barcelona (248; 95% CI: 86-410), Vienna (146; 95% 
214 
CI: 40-252), Zurich (58; 95% CI: 16-100) and Antwerp (7; 95% CI: 3-11).  
215 
 
216 
In standardized terms, and throughout the proportional increases in cycling network 
217 
length (S1 to S3), Vienna and Zurich reaped most benefits (annually 2 to 6 premature 
218 
deaths/ 100,000 persons avoided). In the all-streets (S4) scenario (absolute increase) and 
219 
in standardized terms, Barcelona, Rome, London and Zurich reaped most benefits 
220 
(annually 14 or 15 premature deaths/ 100,000 persons avoided). Already small increases 
221 
in cycling network length (i.e. S1; 10%) provided substantial health benefits with 
222 
 13 
 
Vienna benefiting the most in absolute terms with 31 premature deaths (95% CI: 9-54) 
223 
avoided each year, followed by Rome (21; 95% CI: 8-34), London (18; 95% CI: 7-30), 
224 
Barcelona (16; 95% CI: 5-26) and Zurich (9; 95% CI: 2-16).  
225 
 
226 
Throughout the scenarios, estimated benefits were due to increases in PA that 
227 
outweighed estimated detriments of air pollution and traffic incidents. The increase in 
228 
cycling provided greater risks in terms of air pollution exposure than the expected 
229 
increase in fatal traffic incidents.  
230 
 
231 
The sensitivity analysis assuming the new cycling trips being shifted by 75% from car 
232 
and by 25% from public transport trips, showed even greater health benefits (Table 
233 
S.15). Also the safety-in-numbers effect provided additional benefits (Table S.16). The 
234 
HIA for all 167 European cities, with a total population of 75.2 million people, 
235 
achieving a cycling mode share of 24.7% resulted in 10,091 premature deaths (95% CI: 
236 
3,401-16,781) avoided annually (Table S.19). 
237 
 
238 
3.3 Estimated cost-benefit impacts 
239 
The cost-benefit analysis showed generally positive cost-benefit trade-offs, except for 
240 
Örebro and Antwerp where no or only small health benefits were expected. The largest 
241 
cost-benefit ratios were found for the 10% increase in cycling network (S1) (Rome € 
242 
70:1; Zurich € 62:1; Barcelona € 35:1 Vienna € 22:1; London € 8:1) due to the non-
243 
linearity of the cycling network-cycling mode share ERF (Table S.21).  
244 
245 
 14 
 
4. DISCUSSION 
246 
European data on cycling network length and mode share suggest that a designated 
247 
cycling network is associated with a cycling mode share of up to 24.7%. We estimated 
248 
that a large number of premature deaths (i.e. 2,102) could be prevented annually in six 
249 
of the seven PASTA cities if the cycling network was the same as the city’s street 
250 
network. However, already with a 10% expansion of the cycling network, a 
251 
considerable number of premature deaths (i.e. 95) was estimated to be avoidable 
252 
annually in five of the seven PASTA cities, which was also the most cost-effective 
253 
scenario. If all 167 European cities achieved a cycling mode share of 24.7% over 10,000 
254 
premature deaths were estimated to be avoidable annually.  
255 
 
256 
To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the potential associations between 
257 
cycling network length, mode share and associated health impacts across European 
258 
cities. We found the length of the cycling network to be associated with cycling mode 
259 
share, which coincides with previous findings (Buehler and Dill, 2016; Buehler and 
260 
Pucher, 2012; Heesch et al., 2015; Panter et al., 2016). We also estimated increases in 
261 
cycling to result in net health benefits, which also agrees with previous findings (de 
262 
Hartog et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2015; Rojas-Rueda et al., 2016, 2013; Woodcock et 
263 
al., 2014).  
264 
 
265 
Our result of over 10,000 premature deaths avoidable in all 167 cities achieving the 
266 
maximal cycling mode share of 24.7% is in line with a recent WHO study that 
267 
estimated 10,000 premature deaths avoidable in over 50 major cities worldwide 
268 
assuming achievement of the Copenhagen cycling mode share (i.e. 26%) for a similar 
269 
population size of nearly 75 million people (WHO. Regional Office for Europe, 2014c). 
270 
 15 
 
Thus, our study adds to the growing evidence that cycling for transport does provide 
271 
substantial health benefits and should be facilitated for health promotion in the urban 
272 
context.  
273 
 
274 
The benefits of PA were estimated to outweigh detrimental effects of air pollution and 
275 
traffic incidents and therefore net benefits of cycling are independent of geographical 
276 
context (Mueller et al., 2015). In contrast to some studies (Buekers et al., 2015; Dhondt 
277 
et al., 2013; Rabl and de Nazelle, 2012; Woodcock et al., 2014), but in agreement with 
278 
others (Rojas-Rueda et al., 2012, 2011), we found air pollution exposure for the cyclist 
279 
to be a greater mortality risk than having a fatal traffic incident. This is due to our 
280 
modeling assumptions: (1) cycling a distance of 5 km implies a longer exposure 
281 
duration than traveling the same distance by motor transport, because of varying speeds; 
282 
(2) a cyclist has a higher ventilation rate due to implied physical strain. Thus, a cyclist 
283 
experiences a higher uptake of pollutants for a longer duration; (3) we assumed a public 
284 
transport trip to include a 10 minute walk. Across all PASTA cities, walking (per km 
285 
traveled) was the most hazardous mode of transport concerning traffic safety (Table 
286 
S.14). Hence, the assumption that 75% of the new cycling trips substitute previous 
287 
public transport trips, also shifts the risk for fatal traffic incidents. The reduced risk for a 
288 
fatal traffic incident while walking to public transport makes the estimated increased 
289 
risk while cycling appear less severe. Nonetheless, we did not consider health benefits 
290 
resulting of reductions in air pollution background levels succeeding reductions in 
291 
motor transport, thus the air pollution risk for the cyclist might have been 
292 
overestimated.  
293 
  
294 
 16 
 
As the length of the cycling network was associated with a cycling mode share of up to 
295 
24.7%, for Örebro and Antwerp no or only small increases in cycling due to increases in 
296 
cycling network are expected, which in return results in no or only small health benefits. 
297 
However, if the true association between cycling network length and cycling mode 
298 
share was better represented by the 0.975-quantile of the distribution of the 1,000 
299 
bootstrap samples (i.e. upper CI), then also Örebro and Antwerp could expect larger 
300 
health benefits. Yet, in Örebro and Antwerp, potentially other policies should be 
301 
prioritized to further promote cycling. Vienna and Zurich, on the other hand, appear to 
302 
have great potential to benefit from proportional increases in cycling network length 
303 
because they are at the steeper slope of the growth curve (Fig. 2). Thus, their cycling 
304 
mode share appears more sensitive to expansions of the cycling network (Table 3).  
305 
 
 
306 
London, Rome and Barcelona are expected to benefit most in absolute and standardized 
307 
terms in the all-streets (S4) scenario. These three cities: (1) have larger populations; (2) 
308 
benefit particularly from the large absolute increase in cycling mode share (i.e. 3%, 1% 
309 
and 2% at baseline, respectively (Table 3); and (3) benefit greatly from the estimated 
310 
large increases in PA [i.e. PA levels were lowest at baseline (Tables S.4-S.10)]. 
311 
Generally, the cities baseline levels of PA, air pollution and traffic fatalities impact 
312 
benefit estimations significantly (Rojas-Rueda et al., 2016; Tainio et al., 2016). Health 
313 
benefits will be largest if at baseline the population is less physically active (and has 
314 
high incidence rates for non-communicable diseases), air pollution levels are lower and 
315 
traffic fatalities occur less. Despite health equity commonly being a subsidiary factor in 
316 
the transport calculus, transport policies strongly determine the access to and use of the 
317 
different modes of transport and thus their social significance and associated (often 
318 
unequal) health pathway exposure distribution. As demonstrated in the sensitivity 
319 
 17 
 
analysis, the greatest health benefits occur by getting people out of their own cars, 
320 
because public transport provides health benefits through implied PA (i.e. 10 minute 
321 
walk) (Rojas-Rueda et al., 2012), and by being the safest mode of transport (Mueller et 
322 
al., 2015). Hence, the parallel implementation of ‘push’ (e.g. making cars unattractive) 
323 
and ‘pull’ (e.g. cycling network expansions) policies that consider equity impacts may 
324 
best cater to adopt healthy transport behaviors, resulting in the largest benefits. 
325 
 
326 
Policy implications of our findings may be – also under consideration of the supportive 
327 
literature – that expansions of cycling networks may increase cycling, therefore, 
328 
contributing to global health promotion and meeting sustainable development goals 
329 
(United Nations, 2015). While other research also provides insight on ‘where’ cycling 
330 
infrastructure should be located (e.g. the propensity to cycle tool) (Lovelace et al., 2016) 
331 
and ‘how it should best look like’ (Mertens et al., 2016b), we simply like to express 
332 
‘that’ cycling networks should be high up on the agendas of city governments which 
333 
have direct local accountability for providing ‘healthy choices’ to their citizens. 
334 
Especially in cities with a low cycling mode share (i.e. Rome, Barcelona, London, 
335 
Zurich and Vienna), already a 10% increase in cycling network length, which we 
336 
perceive as an achievable policy for city governments, was estimated to provide 
337 
considerable health and economic benefits.  
338 
 
339 
4.1 Limitations and strengths 
340 
Notwithstanding, our study has limitations. First, no longitudinal data on cycling 
341 
network length and mode share were available. Consequently, no conclusions on causal 
342 
inferences can be drawn. Indeed, reverse causality (i.e. many cyclists leading to 
343 
reinforcements of the cycling network) cannot be ruled-out. Furthermore, cities that 
344 
 18 
 
invest in cycling infrastructure might already be congenial places for cycling. Data on 
345 
other built-environment, transport and socio-economic factors that were shown to 
346 
influence cycling [e.g. mixed land-use, street density and connectivity, gasoline prices, 
347 
traffic safety, students among the population, urban greenery, etc. (Beenackers et al., 
348 
2012; Buehler and Pucher, 2012; Heesch et al., 2015; Sallis et al., 2015)] were not 
349 
available, however, are expected to alter variability in cycling mode share considerably.  
350 
 
351 
As with most HIAs, our analyses were limited by data availability and assumptions on 
352 
causal inferences. Benefit estimations are sensitive to the contextual setting and 
353 
underlying population and exposure parameters. Moreover, we considered exclusively 
354 
the impacts for the actively traveling person. Societal co-benefits of reduced air and 
355 
noise pollution (Buekers et al., 2015; Mueller et al., 2017b), reduced greenhouse gas 
356 
emissions (Woodcock et al., 2009), and improved social cohesion and mental health 
357 
(Litman, 2016a, 2016b) are expected with reductions in motor traffic and increases in 
358 
active transport. Also, quality of life or morbidity impacts have not been considered, but 
359 
are expected to be considerable (Mueller et al., 2017a). Additionally, we did not stratify 
360 
our impact estimations by age, sex, or socioeconomic status even though benefit 
361 
variations thereof are expected (Mueller et al., 2015). Finally, the presented cost-benefit 
362 
estimations should be regarded as a robust overall estimate of which investments in 
363 
infrastructure will be offset by health benefits in the long-term. The chosen Dutch cost 
364 
estimates, despite considering the reconstruction of roads, may overestimate elsewhere; 
365 
also the VoSL is country-specific, which will result in differing cost-benefit ratios in 
366 
other settings. 
367 
 
368 
 19 
 
Strengths of this analysis include the novelty of being the first study to look holistically 
369 
into the associations between cycling network, cycling mode share and associated health 
370 
impacts across European cities. Using open-access OSM data, which for cycling 
371 
infrastructure has been described of fairly good quality (Hochmair et al., 2013), and 
372 
applying the same standardized data extraction method (Salmon and Mueller, 2017) add 
373 
strength and ensure reproducibility.  
374 
 
375 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
376 
Expansions of cycling networks were associated with increases in cycling in European 
377 
cities. Increases in cycling were estimated to provide considerable health and economic 
378 
benefits.
