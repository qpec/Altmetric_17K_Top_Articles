ABSTRACT
Severe corneal injuries often result in permanent vision loss and remain a clinical challenge.
Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secreted factors (secre-
tome) have been studied for their antiscarring, anti-inflammatory, and antiangiogeneic properties.
We aimed to deliver lyophilized MSC secretome (MSC-S) within a viscoelastic gel composed of
hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) as a way to enhance corneal re-epithelialization
and reduce complications after mechanical and chemical injuries of the cornea. We hypothesized
that delivering MSC-S within HA/CS would have improved wound healing effects compared the
with either MSC-S or HA/CS alone. The results showed that a once-daily application of MSC-S in
HA/CS enhances epithelial cell proliferation and wound healing after injury to the cornea. It also
reduced scar formation, neovascularization, and hemorrhage after alkaline corneal burns. We
found that combining MSC-S and HA/CS increased the expression of CD44 receptors colocalized
with HA, suggesting that the observed therapeutic effects between the MSC-S and HA/CS are
in part mediated by CD44 receptor upregulation and activation by HA. The results from this
study demonstrate a reproducible and efficient approach for delivering the MSC-S to the ocular
surface for treatment of severe corneal injuries. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
This study demonstrates that the lyophilized secretome of mesenchymal stem cells reconsti-
tuted within a viscoelastic gel of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate enhances corneal epi-
thelial wound healing both in vitro and in vivo, and mitigates the development of stromal
scarring and neovascularization after alkaline burns in vivo.
INTRODUCTION
The corneal epithelium protects the eye against
pathogen invasion and plays an essential role in
preserving corneal clarity. Thus, it is highly vul-
nerable to the blinding consequences of severe
injury or disease. Following injury, the epithelium
undergoes a highly coordinated repair process,
involving migration, proliferation, and differenti-
ation. This process is orchestrated in part by its
interactions with the extracellular matrix, growth
factor/cytokines, and the residents cells, includ-
ing keratocytes and infiltrate leukocytes [1]. In
certain pathologic, highly inflammatory condi-
tions such as chemical injury, the entire ocular
surface is at risk for permanent scarring and
visual loss. The management of corneal wounds
has not changed significantly in the last few
decades and consists mainly of supportive mea-
sures in the form of lubrication, antibiotics, ste-
roids, patching, autologous serum eye, and in
some cases, sutured lid closure or amniotic
membrane grafting [2, 3]. Thus, there is a defi-
nite need to develop effective clinical strategies
to promote wound healing in patients with
severe ocular surface injuries where the out-
comes of current therapies are suboptimal.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known
to play an important role in tissue repair and
maintenance and have been extensively studied
for regenerative therapies [4, 5]. There is a
wealth of evidence from animal studies that the
plethora of cytokines and growth factors working
in concert within the secreted factors (secre-
tome) of MSCs are able to reduce scarring, neo-
vascularization (NV), and inflammation while

[6–13].
However,
studies showing the application of harvested MSC secretome
(MSC-S) directly onto the cornea are limited. This may be due to
the lack of effective delivery methods, thereby impacting MSC-S
bioavailability and consequently its biological role. Simple
delivery of soluble therapeutic factors as an eye drop to the
ocular surface is limited and cost-inefficient due to fluid turnover
and drainage which results in substantial volumetric losses. To
address this problem, herein we delivered human bone marrow
derived MSC-S to both mechanical and chemical corneal wounds
in rats using a viscoelastic gel as a carrier.
We aimed to answer (a) whether we can use a viscoelastic
gel composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate
(CS) as a carrier, and (b) whether combining MSC secretome
(MSC-S) and HA/CS (MSC-S in HA/CS) improves the rate and
extent of wound healing, and (c) by what mechanisms MSC-S
and HA/CS work together to enhance corneal wound healing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary Human Corneal Epithelial Cell Culture
Primary human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) were harvested
from human cadaver corneas kindly provided by Eversight
(Chicago, IL) as described elsewhere [14]. Briefly, the iris, conjunc-
tiva, and sclera were removed and the cornea was washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at least three times. Then the cor-
nea was treated with dispase (2 mg/ml; Gibco, Waltham, MA) at
37�C for 2 hours to separate the peripheral epithelium as sheets
from the stroma. Epithelial sheets were gently scraped using a
blunt scraper, collected, and then digested in 0.25% trypsin–EDTA
for 5–10 minutes. Cells were washed and resuspended in kerati-
nocyte serum-free medium (KSFM; Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) fortified with 0.05 mg/ml of Bovine Pituitary
Extract, 5 ng/ml of Epidermal Growth Factor, 0.005 mg/ml of
insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 500 ng/ml of Hydro-
cortisone (Sigma-Aldrich) and plated in collagen-coated tissue
culture plates. After being grown to confluence, cells from pas-
sages 3–5 were used for all experiments.
Primary HCEC Characterization
Harvested HCECs in complete KSFM with growth supplements
were evaluated for the presence of CK3, p63, and ABCG2 using
immunofluorescence. Later-passage HCECs treated with HA/CS,
MSC-S, and MSC-S in HA/CS, and complete KSFM were stained
for CK3. The expression of CK3, p63, and ABCG2 was detected as
follows. After 24 hours, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA for
15 minutes. After washing with PBS, the wells were blocked, and
the cells were permeabilized for 30 minutes with 5% normal goat
serum and 0.5% Triton-X. Next, the cells were incubated over-
night with primary antibody CK3 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA:
2Q1040, 1:100), p63 (GeneTex, Irvine, CA: C838X53, 1:50), and
ABCG2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA: 42078, 1:100). After washing
three times with a secondary antibody (1:1,000), Alexa Fluor 488
was added for 2 hours. Finally, after washing with PBS, DAPI was
added for 5 minutes in PBS solution (1:1,000). The cells were
mounted, and the presence of cell markers was observed using
confocal microscopy (ZEISS LSM 880, Carl Zeiss Ag, Oberkochen,
Germany).
Treatment Formulations
HA/CS (DisCoVisc ophthalmic viscosurgical device [OVD], Alcon,
Fort Worth, TX) was diluted with 1 ml of KSFM without supple-
ments or PBS to achieve a concentration of 8.5 mg/ml of HA
(1.7 MDa). Secretome was collected from MSCs as previously
described [9, 10] and was lyophilized. Bone marrow (BM)-
derived MSCs were kindly provided to author ARD’s research
group at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) by Dr. Peiman
Hematti’s group at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and
Clinics. The protocol of BM MSC isolation was approved by the
Health Sciences Institutional Review Board of University of
Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health; the
BM MSCs were obtained from discarded BM filters of healthy
donors after BM donation at the University of Wisconsin Hospital
and Clinics. The BM-MSCs were expanded and their secretome
collected at UIC as follows. Briefly, MSCs were seeded onto 1%
gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) coated wells of a six-well tissue culture
plate in alpha MEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1x L-glutamine (Corning, NY), and 1x NEAA (Corning). Cul-
ture media were changed every other day, and cells were subcul-
tured by brief digestion with TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) when 90% confluent. Passages 3–6 of BM MSCs were
used for all experiments. Upon reaching 100% confluency in a
T175 flask, the MSCs were washed with 30 ml of prewarmed
PBS three times. The media was then changed to phenol red-free
alpha MEM media supplemented with 1x L-glutamine, and 1x
NEAA. The conditioned media was collected after 48 hours. The
cells were trypsinized and counted at the same time. The condi-
tioned media was centrifuged at 500g for 15 minutes to remove
any cells or debris. The supernatant was then transferred to a
new tube and frozen with liquid nitrogen. The frozen secretome
was then placed in a freeze dryer and lyophilized overnight
under vacuum (70 mTorr). Lyophilized MSC-S was then diluted in
KSFM without growth supplements or PBS to a concentration of
100 mg/ml. Next, 100 μl of MSC-S was added to 1.9 ml of diluted
HA/CS, KSFM without growth supplements, or PBS to a concen-
tration of 5.0 mg/ml. Finally, 50 μl of reconstituted MSC-S in
HA/CS was added to the cultured cells in 150 μl of KSFM without
growth supplements. For cell culture assays final concentrations
of MSC-S and HA were 1.25 and 2.1 mg/ml, respectively. The no
treatment group received complete KSFM with growth supple-
ments (control).
Live/Dead Cytotoxicity Assay
Primary HCECs were seeded on collagen-coated 48-well plates
at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells per well, in KSFM complete
with growth supplements. After 6 hours, the cells were washed
and starved with medium without growth supplements for
12 hours. Then, the treatments were added to the cells for
24, 48, and 72 hours. After each time point, the medium was
removed and labeling reagents from a Live/Dead cytotoxicity
assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to the cells in
KSFM without growth supplements, according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions.
In Vitro HCEC Proliferation
Primary HCECs were seeded on collagen-coated surfaces in
complete growth medium, at a concentration of 5–8 × 103
cells per well. After 6 hours, the medium was removed and
KSFM without growth supplements was added to the cells.

 The cells were starved overnight. The next day, 50 μl of the
treatments were added to the cells, in 150 μl of medium with-
out growth supplements. Treatments consisted of MSC-S
alone, HA/CS alone, MSC-S in HA/CS, and KSFM complete with
growth supplements. After 24, 48, and 72 hours, water-soluble
tetrazolium salt-8 solution from Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8,
Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well following manufac-
turer’s protocol. The absorbance was measured 2 hours after
incubation with the water-soluble tetrazolium salt-8 solution.
In a separate, parallel set of experiment, plates with cultured
and treated cells were frozen at −80�C for 7 days. After thaw-
ing the plates, CyQUANT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution
was added to the wells following manufacturer’s protocol, and
the fluorescence was measured at 650 nm after 5 minutes.
In Vivo Animal Studies
All procedures involving animals conformed to the Association
for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Statement for the
use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. The study
procedures were approved by the Administrative Panel on
Laboratory Animal Care of Stanford University (rats) and UIC
(mice). Mice experiments are discussed in further detail in the
Supporting Information section. Female Sprague-Dawley rats
(7–8 weeks old, weighing approximately 200–250 g) were used
in the present study. All surgical procedures were performed
in the semipathogen free zone of our animal care facility. Prior
to surgery and/or treatment, animals were placed individually
into the anesthetic induction chamber. Inhaled anesthesia was
induced with approximately 3%–4% isoflurane in oxygen (1 l/min)
and maintained with 2% isoflurane in oxygen during the proce-
dures. Then, 0.5% proparacaine (Alcaine, Alcon) ophthalmic
solution drops were instilled in the left eyes of the animals.
Postoperative analgesic with subcutaneous buprenorphine SR
(ZooPharm, Windsor, CO) (0.5 mg/kg) was injected prior to the
start of surgical procedure and every 72 hours until complete
wound closure.
Corneal Mechanical Wound Model
A circular 5-mm-diameter epithelial wound was made over the
center of the rat corneas as previously reported [15]. Briefly,
the corneal epithelium was demarcated with a biopsy punch
(5 mm diameter, Mil-Tec, Lehigh Acres, FL) centering on the
visual axis and subsequently removed with a burr (Algerbrush
II, Allomed, Milwaukee, WI) under an operating microscope
(VistaVision, Champaign, IL). After the injury to the epithelium,
animals were randomly divided into four groups: saline control
(n = 5), MSC-S-only treatment (n = 5), HA/CS-only treatment
(n = 5), and MSC-S in HA/CS treatment (n = 5). For all the
experiments involving animals, the topical treatment was
applied to the left eye of each rat and the treatment volume
was 20 μl for all groups. The treatment was performed once
daily, immediately after the injury and then continued each
day until postoperative day 4.
Corneal Alkaline Burn Wound Model
Alkaline burns of the cornea were induced in the left eye of each
rat. A filter paper disc (5 mm in diameter) soaked with 1 M
NaOH was placed on the center of the corneal surface for 30 sec-
onds, followed by irrigation with 200 ml of saline. After the
corneal alkaline burn, animals were randomly divided into four
groups: saline control (n = 7), MSC-S only treatment (n = 7),
HA/CS treatment (n = 7), and treatment with MSC-S in HA/CS
(n = 7). Starting immediately after the alkaline injury, the various
treatments were applied once a day for 1 week. On day 14 post-
injury, rats were sacrificed and corneas excised for histological
examination. Photographs of fluorescein-stained corneas were
taken with a smartphone ophthalmic imaging adapter (Paxos
Scope, by Digisight Technologies, now Verana Health, San Francisco,
CA) equipped with a 15× magnifying lens and a blue LED immedi-
ately after the injury and every 24 hours until the corneal epithe-
lium of all groups was completely healed [16]. The area of the
epithelial defects was measured using ImageJ software (version
1.52b, NIH). The percentage of wound closure (mean � SD of the
mean) was calculated at each time point using the following
equation: wound closure (%) = [(initial defect area − remaining
defect area)/initial defect area]. Corneal NV was quantified as
previously described [17]. Briefly, the area of NV was estimated
by the length of radial penetration and extent in degrees using
ImageJ. It was assumed that a mean rat corneal diameter was
2.5 mm, so that the maximal area of NV was no more than
2.52 mm2 (mean value of the radius of rat cornea) π (=19.95 mm2).
Additionally, corneal NV was divided into nonsignificant or sig-
nificant according to vessel involvement of the central 3 mm
of cornea.
Immunofluorescent Staining of HCECs for CD44 and HA
expression
HCECs were fixed with PFA 4% for 15 minutes, after 24 hours
of incubation with the treatments. Next, cells were permeabi-
lized for 30 minutes with 5% normal goat serum and 0.5%
Triton-X. Next, CD44 (Abcam: ab157107, 1:100) antibody and
biotinylated HA-binding protein (EMD Millipore, Burlington,
MA, 1:100) were added to the cells overnight at 4�C. The next
day, the cells were washed with PBS and secondary antibodies
(Alexa Fluor 488) and Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate
(1:1,000) was added for 2 hours. Finally, after washing with
PBS, DAPI was added for 5 minutes in PBS solution (1:1,000).
The cells were mounted and observed using confocal micros-
copy (ZEISS LSM 880, Carl Zeiss Ag). Quantitative analyses of
the images were performed using ImageJ (version 1.52b, NIH).
For these analyses three different sections were randomly
acquired per sample. The average mean gray value of the sam-
ples normalized by the no treatment group was used for sta-
tistical analysis [18].
Immunohistochemical Staining of Treated Rat Corneas
Eyes from rats that had mechanical and chemical burn injuries
with and without treatment were fixed with 4% PFA for
15 minutes. Then, the eyes were transferred to 15% sucrose
for 2 hours and then left in 30% sucrose overnight at 4�C. The
eyes were then immersed in Tissue-Tek (Sakura Finetek, Torrance,
CA). The eyes were sectioned and permeabilized for 30 minutes
with 5% normal goat serum and 0.5% Triton-X. Next, ZO-1
(Thermo Fisher Scientist, 1:100), alpha muscle smooth actin
(Abcam: ab7817, 1:100), CD31 (Abcam: ab64543, 1:100), Alde-
hyde Dehydrogenase 3 Family Member A1 (ALDH3A1-Abcam:
ab76976, 1:100), and CD44 were added to the cornea sections
and incubated overnight in the same permeabilization solution.
After washing three times with PBS, secondary antibodies
(1:1000), Alexa Fluor 488, 555, and 546, were added for 2 hours.
Finally, after washing with PBS, DAPI was added for 5 minutes in
PBS solution (1:1,000). The corneas were mounted and

Corneal Healing Effects of Secretome in HA/CS
 observed using confocal microscopy (ZEISS LSM 880, Carl Zeiss
Ag). Quantitative analyses of the images were performed using
ImageJ (version 1.52b, NIH) For these analyses, a total of 10 pic-
tures were taken for each eye sample. The average mean gray
value of the samples normalized by the saline or normal group
was used for statistical analysis.
Statistical Analyses
All data are expressed as the mean � SD. Statistical evaluation
of cell proliferation and in vivo wound healing data was
performed using a two-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s
multiple comparisons test. Immunostaining and NV data were
statistically evaluated using one-way ANOVA followed by a
Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. A value of p < .05 was
considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was
performed by using GraphPad Prism 7.
RESULTS
HCECs Remain Viable After Treatment With Combined
MSC-S and HA/CS
Untreated HCECs were found to express p63 and ABCG2 in
addition to CK3, indicating that the cultures contained a mixed
population of limbal and central epithelial cells. Primary cul-
tured HCECs stained positively for CK3 after treatment with
MSC-S, HA/CS, and MSC-S in HA/CS (Fig. 1A), indicating epithe-
lial differentiation. The HCECs also remained viable under all
conditions compared to complete KSFM out to 72 hours after
treatment as determined through a Live/Dead cytotoxicity assay
(Fig. 1B). Of note, cell agglomeration with the formation of 3D
structures was observed in MSC-S at 72 hours, and earlier
(at 48 hours) in the MSC-S in HA/CS group (Fig. 1B).
MSC-S in HA/CS Increases HCEC Proliferation
An increase in HCEC proliferation was observed when the cells
were treated with MSC-S in HA/CS, compared to the no treat-
ment group (Fig. 1C, 1D). The increased cell proliferation was
determined by an increase in cell metabolic activity (Fig. 1C)
and DNA concentration (Fig. 1D). The increase in cell metabolic
activity was statistically different at 24 hours (**, p < .01),
48 hours (****, p < .0001), and 72 hours (****, p < .0001)
compared to the no treatment group. It was also higher at
48 and 72 hours compared to 24 hours. MSC-S alone did not
statistically increase cell metabolic activity compared to the no
treatment group. HA/CS did increase cell proliferation com-
pared to no treatment, but only at the 48 hour time point
(**, p < .01). In addition, cells treated with MSC-S in HA/CS
exhibited increased proliferation compared to HA/CS and MSC-
S alone, at 24, 48, and 72 hours (**, p < .01). The increase in
DNA concentration was also statistically different at 24 hours
(*, p
< .05), 48
hours (**, p
< .01), and
72 hours
(****, p < .0001) compared to the no treatment group. The
increase in DNA concentration (Fig. 1D) was also higher at
48 and 72 hours compared to 24 hours within the MSC-S in
HA/CS group. In both assays, MSC-S did not significantly
increase cell proliferation compared to the no treatment group
while HA/CS increased DNA concentration at the 48 hours
(**, p < .01) time point but not at 24 or 72 hours.
MSC-S in HA/CS Increases the Rate of
Re-Epithelialization in a Mechanical Wound Model
in Rat Corneas
We next aimed to evaluate if MSC-S in HA/CS would increase
the epithelial wound healing rate in a rat model of mechanical
cornea injury (Fig. 2A). After creating 5-mm diameter epithelial
defects on rat corneas, we compared the area of the wound, in
all groups, over 72 hours using fluorescein staining. After
24 hours, the percent wound closure for the group that
received MSC-S in HA/CS was 84.3% � 6.7%, compared to
51.3% � 12.3% for HA/CS, 52.7% � 8.1% for MSC-S and
58.5% � 17.5% for the saline group (**, p < .01) (Fig. 2B). The
percent wound closure in the MSC-S in HA/CS group was statis-
tically significant over the saline group (**, p < .01). To confirm
corneal epithelial phenotype after healing, the treated corneas
were stained with ZO-1. Figure 2C shows that this marker was
present 7 days after treating the cornea with MSC-S in HA/CS. In
addition, a multilayered epithelium was observed in all the
groups as shown by light microscopy (Fig. 2D).
To test whether increased viscosity of a gel vehicle alone,
or the presence of inert protein alone could be responsible for
the observed wound healing effects of MSC-S in HA/CS, we
substituted HA/CS with an over-the-counter Systane ophthal-
mic lubricant gel (0.3% Hypromellose), and the MSC-S with
bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fig. 3A). We applied saline, MSC-
S in Systane, BSA in Systane, and MSC-S in HA/CS. Only the eyes
that received MSC-S in HA/CS showed faster wound healing
compared to the saline group (*, p < .05) at 24 hours (Fig. 3B).
MSC-S in HA/CS Enhances Re-Epithelialization and
Reduces Scar Formation and Hemorrhage in a Corneal
Alkali Burn Model
Next, we aimed to evaluate if MSC-S in HA/CS would enhance
wound closure in a severe alkaline burn model (Fig. 4). All treat-
ments in this model were given once daily out to 7 days, and
eyes were monitored out to 14 days. For epithelial wound heal-
ing after alkaline burns, the results were consistent with those
seen in the mechanical wound model. After 24 hours, wound
closure for the group that received MSC-S in HA/CS was
90.5%
�
5.9%,
for
those
that
received
HA/CS
alone
was 66% � 21.8%, for those that received MSC-S alone was
62.4% � 25.9% and for saline group it was 63.6% � 11.12%
(*, p < .05). The wound area at 24 hours in the MSC-S in HA/CS
group was significantly smaller than the saline group (*, p < .05)
(Fig. 3B). At day 2, the wound was completely closed only in the
MSC-S in HA/CS group. By day 3, the wound had completely
closed in the eyes that received HA/CS and MSC-S alone, but not
in the eyes that received saline. These results are summarized in
Figure 4A. After wound closure, we continued monitoring the
corneas for ongoing tissue damage after the alkaline burn, such
as scar formation, NV, and hemorrhage (Fig. 4A). At day 4, scar
formation is observed in the saline group and at day 5 NV with
hemorrhage was present in the HA/CS group. The scar and hem-
orrhage worsened each day for these groups over the 14 days.
The differences in the overall sizes of the neovascular areas
between the saline group and the MSC-S in HA/CS group was
found to be statistically significant at 14 days (Fig. 4D, *, p < .05).
In summary, the corneas that received MSC-S and MSC-S in
HA/CS daily for 7 days exhibited reduced overall scar formation
and hemorrhage compared to the saline group, with the MSC-S

 in HA/CS group exhibiting the fastest closure of the epithelial
defect induced by the initial alkali burn injury. Representative
images of the saline, HA/CS, MSC-S, and MSC-S in the HA/CS
group corneas at 14 days are shown in Figure 4C).
The treated rat corneas were excised, fixed, sectioned, and
stained with alpha smooth muscle actin, CD31 and ALDH3A1
(Fig. 5A, 5B). Alpha smooth muscle actin stain was increased
in the stromal layer of corneas treated with HA/CS and saline
compared to MSC-S groups. Similarly, CD31 was also increased
in the stromal layer of corneas treated with HA/CS alone and
saline, compared to MSC-S alone and MSC-S in HA/CS groups.
Additionally, we observed a higher number of nuclei stained
with DAPI in the stromal layer of corneas treated with HA/CS
alone and saline. Next, we evaluated the expression of ALDH3A1,
Figure 1.

cyte serum-free medium (KSFM) with growth factors (no treatment, control), MSC-S, HA/CS, MSC-S in HA/CS. (B): Live/dead cytotoxicity assay

tion was statistically significantly greater when MSC-S was delivered in HA/CS compared to no treatment (n = 4; *, p < .05; **, p < .01; ****,
p < .0001). Abbreviations: CS, chondroitin sulfate; HA, hyaluronic acid; MSC-S, mesenchymal stem cells secretome.

 a corneal crystallin known to be involved in maintaining cor-
neal transparency [19]. We observed that only in those groups
that received MSC-S was the expression of this enzyme main-
tained compared to the no treatment group. The corneas trea-
ted with HA/CS alone and saline had a decreased expression of
this protein (Fig. 5A, 5B).
Upregulation of CD44 Receptors in HCECs In Vitro and
Corneas In Vivo After Treatment with MSC-S in HA/CS
Next, we explored whether the MSC-S and HA/CS have any
effect on CD44 expression. Figure 6A and 6B shows CD44
expression on HCECs, 24 hours after applying the treatments.
Cells in the no treatment group showed weak expression of
CD44 receptor and the receptor was not homogeneously dis-
tributed in all the cells. After applying MSC-S and MSC-S in
HA/CS, HCECs exhibited an upregulation of CD44 receptor
compared to all other groups (**, p < .01 and ***, p < .001,
respectively).
CD44 expression was also evaluated in vivo, 7 days after
mechanical wounding in rats (Fig. 6C, 6D). In normal corneas
without injury, the CD44 receptor is expressed in both the
basal and apical epithelial layers. After injury, the group that
received MSC-S in HA/CS exhibited an upregulation of CD44
receptors compared to all other groups (*, p < .05).

 Next, we aimed to evaluate for the colocalization of HA and
CD44 in cultured HCECs, 8 and 24 hours after applying the treat-
ments. Figure 7 shows that 8 hours after treating cells with MSC-S
in HA/CS and MSC-S, HA is highly concentrated around cell mem-
branes. In the no treatment group, HA is distributed mostly intra-
cellularly at 24 hours, and without colocalization with CD44. In the
MSC-S treatment group, some colocalization of HA and CD44
occurs at 8 hours, but not at 24 hours. Likewise, in the HA/CS
treatment group, some colocalization occurs at 8 hours but not at
24 hours. When treated with MSC-S in HA/CS, HCECs exhibited
strong colocalization of HA and CD44 around the cell membrane
at 8 hours, and maintains this colocalization at 24 hours to the
greatest extent compared to the other treatment groups.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we applied MSC-S to primary cultured HCECs and in
both a mechanical and alkaline corneal burn model in vivo using
an HA/CS gel as a carrier. The delivery of MSCs and their secreted
factors to enhance corneal wound healing has been explored
in various ways in preclinical studies [20, 21]. Subconjunctival
application of MSCs has been successfully reported [13, 22–24].
However, cellular therapy presents many challenges such as main-
taining cell viability, phenotypic stability, potentially high costs,
and certain regulatory issues specific to the application of living,
allogeneic cells to the eye. An acellular, molecular therapy com-
posed of factors secreted by MSCs may overcome some of these
limitations. Studies have shown increased epithelial cell prolifera-
tion and wound healing after treatments with MSC-S in culture
models [25, 26]. We chose to test the performance of MSC-S in a
carrier gel because we were working with lyophilized MSC-S.
Lyophilized MSC-S presents certain advantages as well as disad-
vantages over “fresh” collected secretome (also known as condi-
tioned media). Although lyophilization has the potential for
reduced biological activity, it is widely used with protein-based
therapeutics and enables shelf-stability. In the case of MSC-S, it
provides a way to control concentration upon reconstitution, and
also enables consistency between treatments: we were able to
use lyophilized MSC-S over many experiments over many months
with very consistent results—and to also enable future clinical
studies with the same batch of lyophilized material. We chose to
use HA/CS as an alternative carrier to saline for MSC-S because it
is biocompatible, already FDA-approved in ophthalmic surgery,
and its constituents have known beneficial effects on corneal
wound healing [27, 28]. The combination of HA and CS has been
used in ophthalmic viscosurgical devices and HA has been used in
topical ophthalmic eye drops [29]. We hypothesized that reconsti-
tuting MSC-S in HA/CS may provide certain advantages over
reconstituting it in saline alone while providing a highly consistent
treatment formulation. In particular, we posited that using a vis-
cous gel could reduce the number of required topical applications
per day, thus making the treatment more efficient in terms of the
volumetric losses that are typical of standard eye drops.
To determine the best concentration of each substance indi-
vidually, we performed a titration assay for HA/CS and MSC-S
(Supporting Information Fig. S1) in primary rabbit corneal epithe-
lial cells (not human cells). Higher concentrations of HA/CS
caused an increase in rabbit corneal epithelial cell proliferation,
compared to no treatment in a dose-dependent manner.

graphs taken at 15× magnification). Abbreviations: CS, chondroitin sulfate; HA, hyaluronic acid; MSC-S, mesenchymal stem cells secretome.

Corneal Healing Effects of Secretome in HA/CS
 However, we found that MSC-S at the highest concentration
(15 mg/ml) appeared to be toxic to the cells, probably due to
the pH (9.0) after diluting in medium. It is possible that if the pH
was balanced to neutral for the highest concentration of MSC-S
in HA/CS, no toxicity would have been observed. MSC-S
increased cell proliferation in a dose-dependent response. Based
on this data, we chose to work with a final MSC-S concentration
of 1.25 mg/ml as this concentration significantly increased cell
proliferation and required lower quantities of lyophilized MSC-S.
Having identified concentrations of MSC-S and HA/CS, we then
turned our attention to testing these both individually and in com-
bination on primary HCECs. The cultured HCECs—which contained
a mixed population of central and limbal cells based on their
expression of p63, ABCG2, and CK3—were found to stain positively
for CK3 at later passages both in complete KSFM and after treat-
ment with MSC-S, HA/CS, and MSC-S in HA/CS (Fig. 1A), indicating
epithelial differentiation under all conditions.
To assess cell toxicity, we stained the cells with calcein and
propidium iodide after treating with MSC-S, HA/CS, and MSC-S
in HA/CS (Fig. 1B). We observed that there was no significant cell
death in any of the treatment groups as compared to the no
treatment group. We then performed cell proliferation assays
based on both cell metabolic activity and DNA concentration,
and found that the combination of MSC-S in HA/CS led to
greater cell proliferation in HCECs compared to the control group
(Fig. 1C, 1D). HA/CS did show an improvement in cell prolifera-
tion at 48 hours compared to control. No such improvement
was shown in the MSC-S alone treatment group.
To evaluate if this increased cell proliferation could be trans-
lated to preclinical animal models, we first performed a mechani-
cal corneal injury in rodents, applying the various treatments as a
single drop daily, for 4 days. Of note, we began our experiments
in a mouse model but then quickly transitioned to a rat model
due to the larger diameter of their corneas. After 24 hours in rats

MSC-S-containing groups (with and without the HA/CS carrier). Expression of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 3 Family Member A1 (ALDH3A1)
was maintained for both group containing MSC-S. Decreased ALDH3A1 expression was observed in the corneas that received saline and
HA/CS. (B): Quantification of the fluorescence intensities using ImageJ revealed that the alpha smooth muscle actin expression was signif-

 (Fig. 2A), we observed that the eyes that received saline, MSC-S
alone, and HA/CS alone exhibited similar rates of wound closure
of around 60%. In contrast, approximately 80% of the wound was
closed for the group that received MSC-S in HA/CS. We were also
able to show similar results in mice, in which significant wound
closure was observed for the group that received MSC-S in HA/CS
compared to saline (*, p < .05) (Supporting Information Fig. S2).
Thus, in two different species, an increased rate of corneal epithelial
wound healing was observed after mechanical injury, when trea-
ted with the combination of MSC-S and HA/CS. Interestingly, Ke
and collaborators showed that combining MSCs and another
polysaccharide extracted from the Hardy Orchid resulted in sig-
nificantly better recovery of the corneal epithelial layer com-
pared to each of the substances alone [24]. In the present
study, the group that received MSC-S alone did not show
improvement in the rate of re-epithelialization compared to the
saline group. This does not necessarily mean that MSC-S alone
does not have wound healing effects, but rather that topical
MSC-S alone may require more than just a once-daily applica-
tion to produce any beneficial effects.
Next, we evaluated the treated and healed tissue to see if
MSC-S in HA/CS treatment could facilitate normal re-epithelial-
ization. We stained corneal tissue sections after various treat-
ments with ZO-1 (Fig. 2C). ZO-1 is a marker of epithelial tight
junctions. We observed that the group treated with MSC-S in
HA/CS expressed ZO-1 with normal cellular morphology.
We further aimed to evaluate if the same enhanced wound
healing effects would occur in a more severe corneal injury: an
alkaline burn (Fig. 4). In contrast to simple mechanical injuries,
alkaline burns create a profound and often devastating inflam-
matory response leading to NV and scar formation in the nor-
mally clear cornea. We sought to determine whether the MSC-S
in HA/CS treatment could attenuate these effects after alkaline
burn injury. Some studies have shown that MSC can reduce NV
and inflammation, as well as increase corneal transparency [13,
22]. However, these effects have not been reported with the
application of just the secretome (without cells) to the cornea. In
our study, we applied MSC-S with and without HA/CS as a once-
daily treatment for 7 days after alkaline burn. Fluorescein stain-
ing showed that, similar to the results seen in the mechanical
wound model, 90% of the wound was closed in the MSC-S in
HA/CS group, compared to around 60% for the other groups
(each after a single treatment) (Fig. 4A, 4B). By day 2, the wound
was completely closed only for the group that received MSC-S in
HA/CS. At day 4, all eyes in the saline group and some eyes in
the HA/CS treated group started to show subepithelial scarring
and fibrosis of the central cornea. However, these findings
were not observed in the MSC-S and MSC-S in HA/CS groups
(Fig. 4A–4C). Corneal NV developed in all groups starting from day
4. Hemorrhage as a result of the NV was found in the saline and
HA/CS groups. By day 14, the quantified area of NV was largest in
the saline control group (17.6 � 1.9 mm2) followed by HA/CS
treated group (16.3 � 3.0 mm2), MSC-S group (14.6 � 2.9 mm2),
and MSC-S in HA/CS group (12.4 � 4.1 mm2) (Fig. 4D).
After sacrificing the animals, we also evaluated the treated
tissues for smooth muscle actin alpha, CD31, and ALDH3A1
(Fig. 5). Smooth muscle actin alpha is associated with the trans-
formation of keratocytes to myofibroblasts and was clearly pre-
sent in corneas treated with saline. This result correlates with
our macroscopic observation of fibrotic changes in these eyes
over 14 days. Myofibroblastic transformation is associated with
scarring due to abnormal remodeling and extracellular matrix
deposition by these cells [30]. CD31 staining was present in eyes
treated with HA/CS and saline alone but not for MSC-S and
MSC-S in HA/CS. Interestingly, after staining for ALDH3A1,
decreased expression was observed for the saline and HA/CS

Corneal Healing Effects of Secretome in HA/CS
 group compared to the MSC-S in HA/CS and MSC-S groups.
ALDH3A1 is a corneal crystallin responsible for preventing the
detrimental effects of toxic aldhehydes; reduced expression of
this protein can compromise cornea transparency [19]. In this
study, we found that ALDH3A1 expression was correlated posi-
tively with eyes that maintained transparency after alkaline burn
injury through topical treatment with MSC-S in HA/CS, suggest-
ing that MSC-S may help to preserve corneal clarity by maintain-
ing ALDH3A1 expression. Further work is merited to understand
the role of ALDH3A1 in corneal injuries treated with MSC-S.
Finally, we aimed to understand the reason behind the
observed enhanced effects of treating with MSC-S in combination
with HA/CS. To determine whether it is simply due to increased
viscosity of the reconstituted MSC-S, we also dissolved the MSC-S
in an over-the-counter ophthalmic lubricant gel, Systane (0.3%
Hypromellose). Systane was chosen because it is viscous, water-
soluble, commonly used by patients, and generally thought to be
biologically inert. We also tested HA/CS with dissolved BSA rather
than MSC-S, to evaluate the opposite situation of the HA/CS with
a biologically inert protein. The results, shown in Figure 2, showed
that the MSC-S in HA/CS treatment led to faster wound healing
compared to MSC-S in Systane and BSA in HA/CS. Specifically,
after 24 hours, the increased wound healing observed with MSC-S
in HA/CS was not observed for MSC-S in Systane gel. This sug-
gests that the observed healing effect is specific to HA/CS and is
not simply due to the increase in viscosity of the MSC-S solution
on the corneal surface. To confirm that MSC-S is necessary for
wound healing, we replaced it with BSA in the HA/CS gel. We
observed that delivering BSA in HA/CS did not enhance corneal
wound healing. These results led us to conclude that both MSC-S
and HA/CS are essential to the observed corneal wound healing
effects of the combined treatment under study. This suggests that
there is a mutually enhancing effect of delivering MSC-S in HA/CS,
and that viscosity alone or the presence of protein alone is not
what is responsible for the observed healing effects of the combi-
nation treatment under study. Of note, the authors considered
and tested the fibrin gel (Tiseel glue) as an alternative vehicle to
HA/CS (data not shown). However, as it is designed to do, fibrin
gel forms a solid matrix upon mixing, and does not remain a vis-
cous, flowable liquid like HA/CS does. This creates a much differ-
ent release profile compared to a viscous agent such as HA/CS,
where the MSC-S must escape from a solid matrix. Therefore, we
chose a flowable gel material such as Systane which is not a solid,
can be self-administered as an eye drop, and is also regarded to
be physically, biologically, and chemically inert.
We also investigated whether the CD44 receptor plays a
role in the observed biological effects of the MSC-S and HA/CS
treatments. CD44 is a well-characterized transmembrane pro-
tein that serves as the main surface receptor both HA and CS
[31]. The binding of CD44 to HA is known to induce cell prolifer-
ation and changes in cell cytoskeleton [32]. Interestingly, HA
does not bind to CD44 receptor under normal conditions.
Instead, CD44 is activated and upregulated by cytokines and
growth factors and this activation further induces HA to bind to
the CD44 receptor [33]. We found that under normal condi-
tions, corneal epithelial cells express CD44 on their surfaces.
However, this expression is not homogeneously distributed to
all cells. The addition of MSC-S in HA/CS and MSC-S alone both
substantially upregulated the CD44 compared to the no treat-
ment group after 24 hours (Fig. 6A, 6B). It has been shown
CD44 expression is more prominent at the basal and apical
layers of the normal cornea and increases after injury [34, 35].

 Several investigators have evaluated and reported on the role
of CD44 receptors in corneal wound healing. For instance,
Yu et al. showed that the expression of CD44 receptors
increased 3 hours after wounding, with a peak at 18 hours [35].
The authors suggested that the expression of CD44 receptors
correlates with corneal re-epithelialization. Zhong et al. showed
that CD44 receptors were increased in corneal epithelial cells
treated with HA, at 48 hours of incubation [36]. They also
showed that these cells had enhanced migration and decreased
inflammatory proteins. Gomes et al. showed that migration
phase in corneal wound healing is influenced by the synthesis
of CD44 [37]. Zhu et al. suggested that CD44 may play an
important role in corneal cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions
[34]. Yang et al. showed that a crosslinked hyaluronan gel accel-
erated wound healing in rabbit eyes, after chemical and
mechanical injury [38]. Moreover, the presence of high molecu-
lar weight HA has been shown to facilitate binding to CD44
[32]. CS, also known to bind to CD44, may play a role in the
wound healing effects of the combined MSC-S and HA/CS
treatment.
Our findings are in line with the aforementioned reports
from the literature. We found that after applying MSC-S in
HA/CS, CD44 expression increases in all layers of the cornea com-
pared to all other groups (Fig. 6D). In the presence of MSC-S,
CD44 is upregulated and activated which increases HA binding to
the cells (Fig. 6C) [39, 40]. Of particular interest is the pro-
nounced colocalization of HA and CD44 at the cell membranes of
the cultured HCECs in the MSC-S in HA/CS treatment group
(Fig. 7) compared to what is seen in the MSC-S, HA/CS, and no
treatment groups. This colocalization is most apparent at the
8 hour time point but still persists at 24 hours. On the other
hand, this colocalization of both HA and CD44 is less evident in
the single agent or no treatment groups at both 8 and 24 hours.
These results are consistent with previous reports, and indicate
that CD44 having an integral role in the interplay between the
MSC-S and HA/CS and on the enhanced wound healing effects
that they exert together, as observed in this study.
There are some limitations to this study. Although both
MSC-S and HA/CS have been shown to have independent
effects on corneal would healing by others (as well as in our
rabbit corneal epithelial cell data shown in Supporting Informa-
tion Fig. S1), they did not have such an effect in the human
HCECs culture system we used at the concentration and dosing
regimen we selected. Another limitation is that the MSC-S in
our study was lyophilized. As mentioned earlier, lyophilization
provides certain batch-to-batch consistency advantages, but
may not be as biologically active as “fresh” MSC-S. The potential
differences between fresh and lyophilized secretome are out-
side the scope of this study but do merit further investigation.
The goal of our study was to ascertain whether the reconstitu-
tion medium (HA/CS vs. saline) would have any impact on the
wound healing effects of MSC-S. Another limitation is that the
topical treatments in the alkaline burn study was only carried
out to 7 days, and the eyes were monitored out to 14 days. The
intention of this study was to observe the effects of the various
treatment groups with once-daily topical administration on the
time to wound closure as the primary endpoint, and mainte-
nance of corneal scarring and NV as a secondary endpoint. In
future work, we plan to treat daily out to longer time points
and also evaluate the impact of a more frequent dosing regimen
and/or a subconjunctival injection. In spite of this limitation, our
alkaline burn experiments demonstrate the beneficial effects of
the MSC-S in HA/CS treatment on both epithelial wound closure
and on scarring and NV formation compared to MSC-S, HA/CS,
and saline alone.
Previous work has shown that secreted factors from MSCs
can reduce corneal inflammation and decrease epithelial cells
apoptosis and maintain cornea transparency after injury [21,
22, 25]. Another study showed that MSCs maintain corneal
transparency after injury [13]. We showed that, with just a
once-daily topical administration, MSC-S mixed with HA/CS
can accelerate wound closure in both mechanical and chemical
injuries and can reduce scar formation, NV, and hemorrhage
after chemical injury. This work presents a strategy for harnes-
sing the beneficial effects of the MSC-S with a highly reproduc-
ible and efficient approach to its storage and topical delivery.
Further work is merited to continue elucidating the molecular
mechanisms behind the effects seen in this study, such as
what factors predominate the interaction between MSC-S and
HA/CS and what the relative dose-dependent effects are
between these factors and the HA and/or CS matrix elements.
CONCLUSION
The study reveals that the combination of the MSC-S and HA/CS
gel can promote enhanced corneal wound healing in vitro on
HCECs and in both a mechanical and chemical corneal burn
wound model in rats. The MSC-S in HA/CS accelerated epithelial
wound closure and reduced corneal NV, scar formation, and
hemorrhage to a greater extent compared to saline alone, MSC-
S alone, or HA/CS alone. Our results suggest that this effect is
not simply due to an increase in solution viscosity, and that the
HA-binding CD44 receptor may play an important role in the
interplay between MSC-S and HA/CS during wound healing.
