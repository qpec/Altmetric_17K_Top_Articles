ABSTRACT
Background: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals experience high rates of harass-
ment and discrimination when seeking healthcare, which contributes to substantial health-
care disparities. Improving physician training about gender identity, sexual orientation, and
the healthcare needs of SGM patients has been identified as a critical strategy for mitigating
these disparities. In 2014, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) published
medical education competencies to guide undergraduate medical education on SGM topics.
Objective: Conduct pilot study to investigate medical student comfort and competence
about SGM health competencies outlined by the AAMC and evaluate curricular coverage of
SGM topics.
Design: Six-hundred and fifty-eight students at New England allopathic medical schools
(response rate 21.2%) completed an anonymous, online survey evaluating self-reported
comfort and competence regarding SGM health competencies, and coverage of SGM health
in the medical curriculum.
Results: 92.7% of students felt somewhat or very comfortable treating sexual minorities;
68.4% felt comfortable treating gender minorities. Most respondents felt not competent or
somewhat not competent with medical treatment of gender minority patients (76.7%) and
patients with a difference of sex development (81%). At seven schools, more than 50% of
students indicated that the curriculum neither adequately covers SGM-specific topics nor
adequately prepares students to serve SGM patients.
Conclusions: The prevalence of self-reported comfort is greater than that of self-reported
competence serving SGM patients in a convenience sample of New England allopathic medical
students. The majority of participants reported insufficient curricular preparation to achieve the
competencies necessary to care for SGM patients. This multi-institution pilot study provides
preliminary evidence that further curriculum development may be needed to enable medical
students to achieve core competencies in SGM health, as defined by AAMC. Further mixed
methods research is necessary to substantiate and expand upon the findings of this pilot
study. This pilot study also demonstrates the importance of creating specific evaluation tools
to assess medical student achievement of competencies established by the AAMC.

Introduction
Seventy percent of gender minority and over 50%
of sexual minority individuals report experiencing
harassment
and
discrimination
while
seeking
healthcare [1]. Sexual and gender minority (SGM)
individuals report substantial concerns about such
past, and potential future, experiences. These con-
cerns are linked to impaired patient-provider rela-
tionships and elevated rates of healthcare avoidance
among SGM patients [1–4], which in turn contri-
bute to health disparities between SGM and non-
SGM patients [5,6]. Improving physician training
about gender identity, sexual orientation, and the
healthcare needs of SGM has been identified as a
critical strategy for mitigating these disparities and
improving the care delivered to SGM patients [6].
Physicians have historically received little to no
required training on providing sensitive, competent
care to SGM patients [6]. Seventy percent of allo-
pathic medical school deans rate their institution’s
curricular coverage of SGM-specific health topics as
very poor, poor or fair [7]. Similarly, two thirds of
allopathic and osteopathic medical students rate their
institution’s SGM curricula as fair or worse [8]. In
response to the need for SGM curricular develop-
ment, in 2014 the Association of American Medical

 Colleges (AAMC) Advisory Committee on Sexual
Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Development
(AXIS) published undergraduate medical education
competencies pertaining to SGM populations. The
stated goal of the competencies is to ‘serve as a
primary resource for the medical education commu-
nity to use in determining whether trainees can pro-
vide clinically sound, culturally competent care to
these patient populations’ [6]. Research is burgeoning
medical student learning outcomes related to SGM
health, including attitudes, knowledge and compe-
tence. For example, in 2018, Beck et al. reported
that student attitudes, knowledge, and preparedness
to care for SGM patients were generally positive at
four Midwestern medical schools (BECK 2018). Our
investigation expands this and previous literature by
reporting data from multiple medical schools and
utilizing the AAMC competencies as the lens through
which to explore student learning. Indeed, to the
authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to date to
explore self-reported comfort and competence expli-
citly within the framework of the AAMC SGM health
competencies. These data promise to build upon and
update earlier research [8] evaluating medical stu-
dents’ comfort and preparedness in serving SGM
patients. Medical student satisfaction with SGM con-
tent in the curriculum may function as a proxy of
medical student evaluation of the overall efficacy of
the curriculum as preparation for serving SGM
patients.
This pilot study was designed to evaluate self-
reported medical student comfort and competence
in caring for SGM patients within the paradigm of
the AAMC competencies, as well as satisfaction with
SGM curricular content. The authors hypothesized
that self-reported comfort and competence would be
low across institutions, with modest improvements
by ascending year, and that respondents would be
unsatisfied with SGM curricular content.
The following terms pertaining to SGM indivi-
duals will be used in this manuscript:
● Sexual
minority:
individuals
whose
sexual
orientation identity is anything other than het-
erosexual, or straight, and/or whose sexual beha-
vior is not exclusively with individuals of the
opposite binary gender (male or female).
● Gender minority: individuals whose internally
felt gender identity and/or external gender
expression is not congruent with the gender
identity and/or expression associated with the
sex assigned to them at birth.
● Difference of Sex Development (DSD): one of
a variety of congenital conditions for which
chromosomal, hormonal, and/or anatomic sex
does not align with binary definitions of ‘male’
or ‘female’ (e.g. XXY syndrome, Primary adrenal
insufficiency, Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)
Methods
Participants
The
Northeast
Medical
Student
Queer
Alliance
(NMSQA) is a collaborative organization representing
medical students committed to SGM curricular reform
from all ten allopathic medical schools in the New
England census region :The Warren Alpert School of
Medicine at Brown University; Boston University
School of Medicine; Frank H. Netter MD School of
Medicine at Quinnipiac University; Geisel School of
Medicine at Dartmouth; Harvard Medical School;
Tufts University School of Medicine; University of
Connecticut
School
of
Medicine;
University
of
Massachusetts
Medical
School;
University
of
Vermont College of Medicine; and Yale University
School of Medicine. In December 2015, NMSQA
initiated a pilot study of SGM learning outcomes in
medical school curricula [9].
Measures
The anonymous online survey (Appendix) was devel-
oped by medical student members of NMSQA to
evaluate student comfort and competence related to
the
SGM
health
competencies
outlined
by
the
AAMC. As this study was a pilot project intended
to gather preliminary data which could later be used
for survey tool refinement, formal validity testing was
not conducted.
Demographic data including sex assigned at birth,
gender identity, sexual orientation, religiosity, and med-
ical school attended were collected. The self-report
questions were directly modeled on self-reported com-
fort
questions
routinely
used
on
the
AAMC’s
Graduating Student Questionnaire [10]. Using the 4-
point Likert items adapted from the AAMC Graduating
Student Questionnaire [10], self-reported comfort and
competence were evaluated for a selection of AAMC
competencies [6]. These competencies were chosen by
consensus as the fundamental competencies addressed
by any and all medical school curricula designed to
promote high-quality care to SGM patients, regardless
of the complexity of the curricula. Four-point Likert
items (1 = not at all; 4 = completely) designed with the
assistance of the Yale School of Medicine Teaching and
Learning Center were used to evaluate student percep-
tions of the adequacy of curricular preparation for ser-
ving SGM patients and adequacy of curricular coverage
of SGM topics.
Survey implementation
To access the survey, all respondents were required to
review and electronically grant informed consent for
participation. The Yale Human Subjects Committee

N. S. ZELIN ET AL.
 deemed
this
study
exempt
from
review
(HSC
#1,505,015,780) as this study involved minimal risk
to participants, no personal health information was
collected, and all participants were anonymous. The
Dartmouth
College
Institutional
Review
Board
approved dissemination of the survey to its medical
students. Regulatory approval for survey dissemina-
tion was not required at other institutions. All
respondents were eligible to participate in a raffle
for ten $25 Amazon gift cards
The survey was distributed to medical students via
email, social media platforms requiring school enroll-
ment, and school-sponsored newsletters. The inclusion
criteria included active enrollment at a NMSQA member
school, as of May 2015. The web-based survey was avail-
able from 3 May 2015 to 13 August 2015. 910 students
completed some or all of the survey between May and
September 2015. The study cohort represents a conve-
nience sample, with an overall response rate of 21.2%.
Due to institution-specific factors, the survey was not
administered at one institution, and thus, no responses
were received from one institution. Incomplete responses
(<70% items completed) were excluded. Responses sub-
mitted within two minutes of survey initiation were
excluded from analysis; this threshold was approximated
as a minimum threshold for reliable completion of the
survey NMSQA members. All individual responses were
anonymous and aggregate
school
data
were
de-
identified.
Statistical analysis
The primary outcomes were: (1) self-reported comfort in
providing care to SGM patients; (2) self-reported com-
petence in providing care to SGM patients; and (3)
curriculum assessment. The index for medical student
comfort treating SGM patients was calculated as the
mean of six 4-point Likert items (1 = not comfortable,
4 = very comfortable) querying comfort with AAMC
competencies. The index for self-reported competence
in treating SGM patients was calculated as the mean of 15
4-point Likert items (1 = not competent, 4 = very com-
petent) querying self-perceived competence with AAMC
competencies. Perceived adequacy of the curriculum was
calculated as the mean of six 4-point Likert items
(1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree) describing
curricular effectiveness at preparing students to care for
SGM patients. For all composite measures, the mean
index was calculated for completed items; incomplete
items were not included. Cronbach’s alpha statistic was
calculated for each index measure to determine internal
reliability of the composite items. As all alpha statistics
were above 0.70 (comfort: 0.8673, competence: 0.9397,
satisfaction with curriculum: 0.9235), each composite
measure was internally reliable.
Summary statistics were computed among all par-
ticipants and stratified independently by class year,
gender identity, and sexual orientation. The Kruskal–
Wallis test by ranks (a non-parametric one-way ana-
lysis of variance) was performed to identify differ-
ences by class year, gender identity and sexual
orientation. A post-hoc Tukey analysis was per-
formed (Tukey HSD test) as appropriate to conduct
pairwise comparisons and determine how outcomes
varied. All statistical tests were evaluated at a p = 0.05
significance level. All analyses were performed using
Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Six hundred and fifty-eight medical students from nine
institutions were included in the final analytic sample
(Table 1). First year medical students (34.1%) were
most often represented, with the remaining respon-
dents split nearly equally among years two through
four. Nearly 60% of participants reported sex assigned
at birth as female. Fifty-nine percent of participants
reported a gender identity of ‘woman,’ 38.3% ‘man’,
and 0.6% ‘genderqueer.’ Approximately 80% of parti-
cipants identified as heterosexual, 7.0% as bisexual,
6.4% as gay, 2.6% as lesbian, 2.1% as queer, and 0.9%
as other. A majority of students were either ‘not at all
religious’ (44.2%) or ‘slightly religious’ (19.9%).
The median composite comfort index for all stu-
dents was 3.0 ± 0.7 (range 1–4), which corresponds to
feeling ‘somewhat comfortable’ caring for SGM
patients (Table 2). This value did not differ by class
year (p = 0.51). More students were comfortable

 treating sexual minorities (92.7%) than gender mino-
rities (68.4%; Table 3).
The median composite competence index for all
students was 2.4 ± 0.7 (range 1–4), corresponding to
a response between ‘somewhat not competent’ and
‘somewhat competent’ (Table 2). Students felt most
competent in their ability to sensitively interview
patients about sexual orientation, sexual history, and
sexual practices (84.4% somewhat or very competent,
Table 3). Respondents reported the least competence
in describing treatment options for transgender
patients (23.4% somewhat or very competent) and
for patients born with a difference of sex develop-
ment (19.0% somewhat or very competent).

 the mean composite index was 2.3 ± 0.8 (Table 2),
which reflects a moderately negative perception of
curricula. Notably, the majority of students did not
believe that their curriculum adequately prepared
them to comfortably and competently care for SGM
patients (55.9%) or adequately covered SGM-specific
health topics (60.3%, Table 4).
Students’ self-reported competence (p = 0.002) and
assessment of curricular incorporation of SGM health-
care topics (p = 0.001) varied by class year (Table 2).
Tukey post-hoc testing demonstrated notable differences
between first- and third-year students: third-year stu-
dents reported greater competence working with SGM
patients (p = 0.002) and thought their curricula had
better coverage of SGM topics (p = 0.002). Similar differ-
ences were found between first- and fourth-year stu-
dents, with fourth-year students reporting greater
competence working with SGM patients (p = 0.01). No
other significant differences by class were noted.
Furthermore, the primary outcomes (comfort, com-
petence, and perceived adequacy of SGM curricula) dif-
fered by gender identity (Table 5). Notably, male
participants, compared to their female counterparts,
reported increased comfort (median 3.2 versus 3.0,
p = 0.04), and satisfaction with SGM-curricular content
(2.7 versus 2.2, p = 0.001). Differences were also observed
by sexual orientation (Table 6). Compared to non-het-
erosexual identified respondents, heterosexual partici-
pants
reported
increased
satisfaction
with
SGM
curricular content (median 2.7 versus 2.2, p = 0.006),
whereas sexual minority respondents reported increased
comfort (3.3 versus 3.0, p < 0.001) and competence (2.7
versus 2.3, p < 0.001).
Discussion
Medical student respondents to this pilot survey of
nine of the ten New England allopathic medical
schools (response rate: 21%) endorsed moderate
self-reported comfort but limited self-reported com-
petence in caring for SGM patients. The discrepancy
between self-reported comfort and self-reported com-
petence may reflect a distinction between provider
affect (i.e. comfort) related to caring for SGM
patients, and provider knowledge and skills necessary
to competently care for SGM patients. Differences in
competence and perception of curricular effectiveness
were observed based on gender identity, sexual orien-
tation, and class year. Over half of the participants
reported
inadequate
preparation
to
serve
SGM
patients and inadequate coverage of SGM topics
within current medical curricula.
Across institutions, the majority of respondents
reported moderate comfort treating SGM patients, mir-
roring prior research documenting positive attitudes
among osteopathic medical students toward treating sex-
ual minorities [11] and recent reductions in overt anti-
SGM sentiment in the general population, particularly
among individuals with advanced education [12,13].
Self-reported comfort and competence were greater
among sexual minority medical students compared to
their heterosexual peers, which may be partially attribu-
table to the high rates of involvement in SGM profes-
sional work reported by SGM medical trainees and
providers [14] and to the impact of personal experience
with SGM health issues. Additionally, male-identified
respondents
reported
greater
competence

 satisfaction with curricular preparation than female-
identified respondents. This trend parallels previously
reported gender disparities in self-esteem and self-assess-
ment: male medical students overestimate competence
and endorse greater self-esteem, while female medical
students underestimate performance and report less
self-esteem [15,16]. This discrepancy may also reflect
the social privilege of male identity in the heteronorma-
tive, pro-masculine culture documented in medical edu-
cation [17,18]. Socially privileged groups exhibit greater
implicit bias than marginalized groups [19], potentially
inhibiting appropriate recognition of SGM health needs
and motivation to develop SGM health knowledge and
skills.
The vast majority of participants (92.7%) indicated
comfort treating sexual minority patients. However, a
minority (31.7%) of respondents expressed comfort
caring for gender minority patients. Similarly, more
than 25% of students were somewhat not or not
comfortable discussing gender identity and more
than 40% of students were somewhat not or not
comfortable discussing gender minority health topics
such as hormone therapy. Student discomfort with
gender-related topics paralleled low levels of self-
reported competency regarding sex and gender-
related issues. Students reported the least competence
with interviewing patients about gender identity,
detailing treatment options for gender minorities
and describing the etiologies of differences of sex
development. These findings are consistent with pub-
lished data showing that gender minorities report
limited provider cultural competency, frequent denial
of needed healthcare services, and overt harassment
in healthcare settings [1,3,4,20]. Similarly, individuals
born with differences of sex development have dis-
tinct medical needs that are often inadequately
addressed or addressed in a way that enforces a
binary model of sex and gender, provoking lifelong
psychological trauma [21–23], and/or physical seque-
lae [6,24]. Our findings suggest that enhanced provi-
der training to competently and sensitively serve
these particular populations is needed.
More than half of the respondents in this study
reported that their medical school curriculum did not
adequately prepare them to serve SGM patients.
While the composite index of perceived curricular
effectiveness increased with class year, the majority
of third- and fourth-year students still reported that
their formal curriculum provided inadequate pre-
paration. This trend may suggest that dissatisfaction
during the pre-clinical years stems from an absence
of salient SGM topics in the curriculum, which is
only slightly ameliorated by clinical experiences and
other learning opportunities over time.
Despite the perceived ineffectiveness of formal
curricula, third- and fourth-year medical students
reported greater competence compared to first-year
students. This increase suggests that some aspect of
undergraduate medical education is contributing to
increased SGM healthcare knowledge and increased
self-reported competence over the course of medical
school. Of note, class year-related increases in com-
petence were most evident in skills required for gen-
eral patient care, such as patient interviewing and
informed consent. Increases in competence with
increasing class year may thus reflect a general
advancement of clinical skills, as opposed to a true
improvement with SGM health competencies.
Limitations
This pilot study provides preliminary data about medical
student learning outcomes related to the AAMC SGM
competencies. However, it is limited by reliance on self-
reported comfort and competency, which are imperfect
measures of learning outcomes. For example, current
research has suggested that up to 98% of providers
endorse willingness to care for SGM patients [25], but a
majority of SGM patients [1] report discrimination in
healthcare, suggesting that providers may overestimate
their competence in serving SGM patients. Similarly,
nearly three-fourths of respondents in our study reported
some degree of competence in identifying and develop-
ing strategies to mitigating their personal biases; how-
ever, a 2015 study of 4,000 medical students documented
explicit anti-sexual minority bias in more than 40%, and
implicit anti-sexual minority bias in more than 80%, of
respondents [26]. The disparity between self-reported
competence and related objective metrics in a compar-
able cohort suggests that respondents may have over-
estimated their competence, or alternatively, may have
mistaken comfort for competence. Given the pilot nature
of this study, no formal validity testing was conducted,
limiting interpretation of these data, particularly as self-
reported measures may be affected by social desirability
bias. Validity testing will be important for subsequent,
more expansive follow-up studies on medical student
learning about SGM health.
This study may further overestimate composite
learning outcomes due to the disproportional repre-
sentation of SGM medical students among the
respondent pool, and the enhanced self-reported
competence of sexual minority respondents com-
parted to heterosexual respondents. Approximately
20% of respondents self-identified as SGM, compared
to 2 to 4% of individuals in the general population
and 6% of first-year medical students [26–27].
Despite these limitations, this pilot study suggests
the existence of a significant educational gap and a
need for enhanced competency related to the care of
SGM patients. A national assessment of medical stu-
dent comfort and competence in treating SGM
patients, ideally including qualitative and quantitative
metrics, is needed to build upon and extend these
6
N. S. ZELIN ET AL.
 findings. Such a study would be enhanced by a larger
sample size and by including objective measures of
learning outcomes.
Until such a study can be conducted, the present
report of self-assessed comfort, competence and
perception of curricular coverage may serve as a
preliminary indicator of key areas for improvement
in medical curricula. Recognizing the limitations of
the present study, the authors recommend that
medical
curricula
should
prioritize
topics
for
which notable shortcomings have been identified
in current practice, as well as embed means to
assess student competency in curricular activities.
The following recommendations are issued with
these caveats:
(1) SGM health broadly remains an urgent topical
area for curricular development and enhance-
ment. In particular, curricular development to
prepare students for serving gender minority
patients and patients born with a difference of
sexual development appears to be needed des-
perately. Holistic integration of SGM content
in the curriculum, exposure to SGM patients
and exposure to SGM topics in clinic encoun-
ters increase knowledge of SGM health and
positively
impact
attitudes
toward
SGM
patients [24,26,28,29]. Educators may expedite
and facilitate curricular development by acces-
sing the numerous resources developed by the
AAMC (including clinical vignettes and webi-
nars) [30] and the expanding library of peer-
reviewed
instructional
materials
on
the
AAMC’s MedEd Portal [15]. Additionally,
educators
may
benefit
from
collaboration
with institutions that have already begun the
process of SGM content development and
integration in the medical curriculum [31–33].
(2) A substantial portion of respondents reported
difficulties performing specific competencies
related to SGM patient care. A more granular
approach to developing, evaluating, and deli-
vering formative feedback on specific compe-
tencies may therefore be a more effective
approach for SGM curriculum delivery and
evaluation. As self-reported comfort does not
significantly vary with perceived competence,
it likely should not be used as the primary
endpoint for curriculum evaluation.
(3) Student development of SGM-specific competen-
cies seems to be linked to development of general
medical competencies. Critical evaluation of stu-
dent learning outcomes must be contextualized
within the broader framework of learner devel-
opment so as to detect when general learner
development may mask persistent deficiencies in
SGM health knowledge and competency.
Conclusions
This pilot study indicates that a sample of medical
students
at
allopathic
medical
schools
in
New
England report limited competence with SGM health-
care competencies and perceive formal curriculum as
inadequately
preparing
them
to
care
for
SGM
patients. These data provide a snapshot of learning
outcomes in the New England region. As provider
attitudes and behaviors toward SGM patients and
medical students’ experiences related to SGM health
issues may vary significantly by region, additional
research is needed to evaluate curricular needs in
different
geographic
regions
[24,28,34–40].
Assessment of objective, rather than self-reported,
learning outcomes will also be a critical component
of future research in this area.
In combination with prior research describing lim-
ited curricular coverage and integration of SGM
health content [7,8], our findings suggest that further
curricular
development
and
medical
education
research is needed to appropriately prepare medical
students to serve all patients, regardless of sexual
orientation or gender identity, and to help mitigate
the health disparities suffered by SGM patients.

Sexual Orientation,Gender Identity and Sex Development in Medical Curricula
Consent for Participation in a Research Project IRB Protocol # 1,505,015,780 Evaluating Sexual and Gender Minority
Health in Medical School CurriculaNicole Sitkin, MD Candidate (nicole.sitkin@yale.edu) John Encandela, PhD (john.
encandela@yale.edu) Purpose: You are invited to participate in a research study designed to investigate the degree to which
medical school curricula enhance medical student knowledge, competence and comfort serving the health needs of sexual
and gender minorities (SGM), including individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer (LGBTQ),
gender non-conforming (GNC) individuals, and individuals born with disorders or differences of sex development (DSD).
All medical students at the following institutions are eligible to participate in this survey study: Alpert Medical School at
Brown University Boston University School of Medicine Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University
Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth Harvard Medical School Tufts University School of Medicine University of
Connecticut School of Medicine University of Massachusetts Medical School University of Vermont College of Medicine
Yale University School of Medicine We encourage eligible medical students of all years, sexes, sexual orientations, and
gender identities to participate in this survey. Procedures: Participation in this study will involve completing an online
survey. We anticipate that your involvement will require approximately 10 min. You will be eligible to enter a raffle for one
of ten $25 Amazon gift cards following completion of the survey. Risks and Benefits: Participation in this study involves
very minimal risk. There is a slight chance that you may feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions in the survey.
Only two questions on this survey require an answer. One of these questions confirms your consent to participate in this
research study, and the other question confirms your eligibility to participate in this study. You can decide to skip any other
questions that you do not want to answer. You may withdraw from the study at any time. If you want to stop completing
the survey, simply close the survey. While you may not personally benefit from participating in this study, the information
you provide will yield important insights into the general state of medical curricula on SGM health among Northeast
medical schools, and to lay the foundation for an improved understanding of key areas for curricular development and
reform. Confidentiality: All of your responses will be completely anonymous. No identifying data of any kind will be
collected. At the completion of the survey, you will have the opportunity to provide your name and e-mail to be entered
into a raffle. You contact details cannot and will not be linked in any way to your responses on this survey. Voluntary
Participation: Your participation in this study is voluntary. You are free to decline to participate, to end your participation
at any time for any reason, or to refuse to answer any individual question. Refusing to participate will involve no penalty.
Questions: If you have any questions about this study, you may contact the investigators, Nicole Sitkin (nicole.sitkin@yale.
edu; 203–785-5466) and John Encandela (john.encandela@yale.edu; 203–785-5466). If you would like to talk with someone
other than the researchers to discuss problems or concerns, to discuss situations in the event that a member of the research
team is not available, or to discuss your rights as a research participant, you may contact the Yale University Human
Subjects Committee, Box 208,010, New Haven, CT 06520–8010, 203–785-4688, human.subjects@yale.edu. Additional
