Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are proviral sequences that result
from colonization of the host germ line by exogenous retroviruses.
The majority of ERVs represent defective retroviral copies. How-
ever, for most ERVs, endogenization occurred millions of years
ago, obscuring the stages by which ERVs become defective and
the changes in both virus and host important to the process. The
koala retrovirus, KoRV, only recently began invading the germ line
of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), permitting analysis of retro-
viral endogenization on a prospective basis. Here, we report that
recombination with host genomic elements disrupts retroviruses
during the earliest stages of germ-line invasion. One type of
recombinant, designated recKoRV1, was formed by recombination
of KoRV with an older degraded retroelement. Many genomic
copies of recKoRV1 were detected across koalas. The prevalence
of recKoRV1 was higher in northern than in southern Australian
koalas, as is the case for KoRV, with differences in recKoRV1 prev-
alence, but not KoRV prevalence, between inland and coastal New
South Wales. At least 15 additional different recombination events
between KoRV and the older endogenous retroelement generated
distinct recKoRVs with different geographic distributions. All of
the identified recombinant viruses appear to have arisen indepen-
dently and have highly disrupted ORFs, which suggests that re-
combination with existing degraded endogenous retroelements
may be a means by which replication-competent ERVs that enter
the germ line are degraded.

n humans, about 8% of the genome consists of endogenous
retrovirus (ERV)-like elements, comprising a larger pro-
portion of the genome in humans and other species than protein
coding regions within genes (1–3). The architecture of the hu-
man genome reflects a long evolutionary history of invasions of
the germ line by infectious retroviruses (1, 2, 4–7). Phylogenetic
analyses suggest that retroviruses have, from a deep evolutionary
perspective, frequently jumped from one species to another and
invaded the germ lines of new hosts (8–12). Almost all known
ERVs completed invasion of their host germ lines millions of
years ago, obscuring the early events critical to the invasion
process. An exception is the koala retrovirus (KoRV).
KoRV is a full-length replication-competent endogenous retro-
virus, the titer of which is correlated with chlamydiosis and hema-
topoietic neoplasia (13, 14). KoRV is thought to spread in koalas
both horizontally by infection and vertically as an endogenous ge-
nomic element (15, 16). KoRV has a clinal geographic distribution
among koalas; while 100% of northern Australian koala populations
carry KoRV, the prevalence and copy number of KoRV is greatly
reduced in southern Australia (14, 17, 18). Unlike other ERVs,
KoRV is not present in the germ line of all members of the host
species (19). Ancient DNA studies have shown that KoRV was
ubiquitous in Queensland koalas in the late 19th century (16).
Molecular dating places the initial entry of KoRV into the koala
germ line within the past 50,000 y (16, 20). These studies strongly
indicate that KoRV, unlike most known vertebrate ERVs, is in the
early stages of the endogenization process in its koala host (17, 19).
Many ERVs in vertebrates are found at fixed positions in the
genome across all members of the host species. By contrast,
there is substantial variation in the host genomic integration sites
for endogenous KoRV across koalas, with a very high degree of
insertional polymorphism. Among modern and museum samples
of koalas in Queensland, the population with the highest
Significance
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are proviral sequences that
result from host germ-line invasion by exogenous retroviruses.
The majority of ERVs are degraded. Using the koala retrovirus
(KoRV) as a model system, we demonstrate that recombination
with an ancient koala retroelement disables KoRV, and that
recombination occurs frequently and early in the invasion
process. Recombinant KoRVs (recKoRVs) are then able to pro-
liferate in the koala germ line. This may in part explain the
generally degraded nature of ERVs in vertebrate genomes and
suggests that degradation via recombination is one of the
earliest processes shaping retroviral genomic invasions.

EVOLUTION
 abundance of KoRV, only a small proportion of KoRV inte-
grations are shared among unrelated koalas (20–22). The lack of
fixed KoRV proviral insertions among koalas, and the low pro-
portion of shared integration sites among koalas that carry en-
dogenous KoRV, provide further evidence for a recent invasion
of the koala germ line by KoRV.
Most endogenous retroviruses in other species have highly dis-
rupted proviral genomes, and those present in higher copy numbers
across the germ line often show deletion of the proviral env, which
codes for the viral envelope. ERVs that lack env have been found to
be “superspreaders,” i.e., elements that have reached a high copy
number within the host germ line (23). Through recombination, ex-
ogenous retroviruses can exchange genetic information with ERVs in
infected individuals. For example, murine leukemia virus (MLV) can
recombine with endogenous MLVs to generate novel viruses, in ef-
fect remobilizing part of the ERV sequences (24). Recombination
may also render ERVs defective, e.g., through disruption of ORFs or
the generation of solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) (25). However,
the role of recombination during the early stages of retroviral geno-
mic invasion has not been directly examined. Here, we provide evi-
dence that older endogenous retroelements recombine with and
degrade invading retroviral genomes, even when the homology be-
tween them is limited. This occurs early during retroviral invasion and
disrupts the invading retrovirus while simultaneously remobilizing an
existing retroelement recombination partner within the host genome.
By disrupting retroviruses invading the germ line, the process likely
accelerates the retroviral transition from horizontal to vertical trans-
mission, which is expected to benefit the host species.
Results
The Advantages of Long Read Sequence Technology for Retroviral
Analysis. KoRV has generally been studied using 454 FLX or
Illumina-based short read sequencing approaches (16, 22). These
approaches have a number of limitations. First, identified poly-
morphisms in KoRV cannot generally be put in phase with other
polymorphisms. Second, only small structural differences among
KoRV sequences, such as short indels, can be detected. Large de-
letions and recombination events are missed given that reads are of
short length. Third, the specific host integration site cannot be
identified for polymorphisms or KoRV sequences because reads
are not long enough to cover the DNA region from the integration
site to the KoRV genes. Thus, KoRV variation has been studied in
the aggregate by mapping reads to full-length proviruses. Using this
method, little variation has been detected (16, 22). By contrast, the
current study used PacBio technology, which produces long se-
quence reads. The koala genome was sequenced using this
technology, and we here sequenced individual KoRV proviruses.
This permitted us to identify structural variation across individual
KoRV proviruses, link KoRV variants to genomic loci in the koala
host, and determine the position and copy number for each type of
variation detected among KoRV proviruses. A complex evolutionary
history was revealed for KoRV.
recKoRV1, a Recombinant Koala Retrovirus. PacBio sequencing of one
koala (Bilbo; Table 1 and ref. 26), the individual used to sequence
and assemble the koala genome, has identified a proviral integrant
called recombinant koala retrovirus 1 (recKoRV1), which includes
the 5′ KoRV LTR followed by the gag leader region to position 1,177
(27). It also includes the KoRV region from position 7,619 of the env
gene including the complete 3′ LTR. However, the sequence between
these two fragments of KoRV is derived from another retroelement,
designated the Phascolarctos endogenous retroelement (PhER) (Fig.
1) (27). PhER has partial homology to Repbase (28) but has no intact
protein coding regions except potentially in the env region (27, 29).
PhER has been found to be a transcriptionally expressed high copy
number ERV (∼30–40 full-length elements and hundreds of solo
LTRs or fragmented copies).
Other Recombinants Between KoRV and PhER. In the current study,
we examined an unrelated koala (Bilyarra; Table 1) to charac-
terize recKoRV. We also identified KoRV-PhER recombination
breakpoints and used them as queries to screen existing Illumina
sequence datasets that had been previously generated but never
examined for KoRV recombinants. Proviral integration sharing
among koalas was examined on a per locus basis, while the
presence or absence of specific recombination breakpoints was ex-
amined in the aggregate (Table 1 gives details regarding the koalas
and datasets). Along with the two recombination sites of recKoRV1,
an additional 15 KoRV-PhER recombinant sequences were identi-
fied (Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1). Although KoRV and PhER
had dissimilar sequences, at five of the recombination breakpoints we
identified microhomologies, short matching sequences that were
shared at a breakpoint by both KoRV and PhER. These micro-
homologies may have enabled the recombination between the two
elements at various breakpoints (SI Appendix, Table S1) (30–32). Of
17 recombination breakpoints identified, all but three were within
1,500 bp of the ends of the KoRV genome (Fig. 1). Most breakpoint
sequences were determined using only short Illumina reads, and so it
was not possible to determine the structure of recombinants or
characterize the integration sites.
The number of Illumina sequences among koala datasets map-
ping to proviral recKoRV1 breakpoints far exceeded those mapping
to any of the other recombination breakpoints identified (SI

 Appendix, Fig. S1 and Table S1) (26, 27). We therefore focused on
the evolutionary history of the recKoRV1 subtype of recombinants.
Absence of Reciprocal Recombinant recKoRVs. We screened for re-
ciprocal recombination products relative to the structure of
recKoRV1, i.e., containing PhER sequences flanking KoRV
coding sequences, and found no evidence for them across the
genome of Bilbo. This was not unexpected because viral inte-
grases are generally LTR sequence specific and sequence
alignment using blastn with tolerant/permissive parameter set-
tings revealed no substantial sequence similarity in the LTR
regions of KoRV and PhER. Because PhER does not code for
an intact integrase, both KoRV and recKoRV1 would rely on
KoRV integrase to insert into the genome. PhER-flanked re-
ciprocal recombinants would likely lack the requisite LTR se-
quences to be recognized and integrated efficiently (33).
Comparison of LTRs and Integration Sites Among Koala Genomes.
KoRV integration sites are highly insertionally polymorphic
across unrelated koalas (19, 20). We examined KoRV and
recKoRV1 integration sites in Bilyarra using a long read inverse
PCR strategy and PacBio sequencing. This method allowed
for identifying KoRV and recKoRV1 sequences and their in-
tegration sites in long single PacBio reads. Bilyarra exhibited a
greater number of KoRV integration sites than found in the
Bilbo reference genome (66 compared with 58). Among the
KoRV integration sites (unique to each proviral locus) in Bilbo
and Bilyarra, only two were shared (KoRV22 and KoRV35; SI
Appendix, Fig. S1B and Table S2). In each of the two KoRV
proviral loci shared by Bilbo and Bilyarra, deletions detected in the
env gene would likely have precluded production of infectious vi-
rions. The other 120 integration sites were only detected in one of
the two koalas. This suggests that individual KoRV integrants are
found at low frequencies in their respective chromosomes and not
generally shared by unrelated koalas. By contrast, many LTR se-
quences from Bilbo, Bilyarra, and other koalas were identical; they
largely overlapped across a minimum spanning network, with few
sequences unique to a specific koala (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). This
indicates that KoRV proviruses at different loci have the same LTR
sequence (20), as many LTR sequences, unlike integration sites,
were shared among unrelated koalas.
Twenty-four recKoRV integrations were identified in Bilyarra,
of which 14 were characterized as recKoRV1. In Bilbo 12
recKoRV1 sites were identified (identified through PacBio
sequence reads that included both the integration sites and one
or both of the recKoRV1 breakpoints). None of the recKoRV1
integration sites was shared between Bilbo and Bilyarra (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1B). This may indicate that recKoRV1 integra-
tions have not had sufficient time to become broadly distributed
among koalas. The absence of shared loci carrying recKoRV1
between Bilbo and Bilyarra would suggest that recKoRV1 has
been able to retrotranspose to different loci in the koala genome
and/or that the same recombination event has occurred between
KoRV and PhER on more than one occasion. The recKoRV
LTRs varied across recKoRV1 loci, were often identical to KoRV
LTRs, and included four of the five most common KoRV LTRs (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2). This suggests that the same breakpoints between
KoRV and PhER have been used in independent recombination
events to generate recKoRV1s multiple times, because random
mutations from a single ancestral recKoRV1 LTR would not exactly
match those that happen to distinguish the most common KoRV
LTR sequences. Target site duplications of 4–10 bp were detected at
the integration sites of KoRV and recKoRV1 in the large majority
of cases (SI Appendix, Table S2), suggesting that the integrations
involved a retrovirus-typical reverse transcription as opposed to
meiotic recombination.
The 17 Identified Recombination Breakpoints, Including recKoRV1
Breakpoints, Have Dissimilar Distributions Among Koala Populations.
Unlike most ERVs, KoRV greatly varies in prevalence across its
host populations. While all Queensland koalas are positive for
KoRV with high copy numbers in their genomes, southern Aus-
tralian koalas have a much lower prevalence and copy number, with
KoRV completely absent from some individuals (34). Sequences for
all 17 recombination breakpoints identified between KoRV and
PhER were used to query the koala reference genome and Illumina
sequence datasets. Of the 17, 11 were identified in the genome of
Pacific Chocolate, a koala from New South Wales, but were ab-
sent from the genome of Birkie (Table 1) from Queensland. The
other six recombination breakpoints, including the breakpoints of
recKoRV1, were identified in Birkie but absent from Pacific Choc-
olate. The lack of overlap may suggest that independent recombi-
nation events between KoRV and PhER have occurred in koalas
from the two Australian regions. Screening of sequence datasets that
had been generated after hybridization capture of KoRV identified
the two recKoRV1 recombination breakpoints in all other koalas ex-
amined, including both museum and modern samples (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1 and Table S1). Five of the 11 breakpoints in Pacific

 Chocolate from New South Wales were specific to that individual.
The remaining six breakpoints were detected only sporadically
among existing Illumina datasets, with the exception of breakpoint
10, which was found in most museum and a zoo koala but not
in Birkie.
An Extended Analysis of the Geographic Distribution of recKoRV1. To
more precisely characterize the geographic distribution of recKoRV1
among koalas, the presence or absence of the 3′ recKoRV1 re-
combination breakpoint was examined using PCR. To span the re-
combination breakpoint, the 5′ PCR primer matched the upstream
PhER sequence and the 3′ primer matched the downstream KoRV
LTR sequence. We screened for the 3′ recKoRV1 recombination
breakpoint in 166 koalas from 11 populations across Australia that
had previously been screened for KoRV prevalence (17). KoRV and
the recKoRV1 3′ breakpoint were both present across all koalas in
Queensland and inland New South Wales (Fig. 2) with the notable
exception of St. Bees Island (Fig. 2, population B) in which the
recKoRV1 3′ breakpoint was only detected in 4 of 15 koalas, al-
though KoRV was ubiquitous among St. Bees koalas. The coastal
population of Port Stephens in New South Wales (Fig. 2 population
G) was 100% KoRV positive but devoid of recKoRV1. This is
consistent with the absence of recKoRV1 recombination breakpoints
in the genome of Pacific Chocolate (from nearby Port Macquarie,
New South Wales). Further south in Victoria, both Mornington
Peninsula and Gippsland were negative for the recKoRV1 break-
point and either positive for KoRV (Gippsland; Fig. 2, population K)
or negative for both KoRV and recKoRV1 (Mornington Peninsula;
Fig. 2, population J).
In South Australia, 8 of 16 koalas were positive for KoRV in
Adelaide Hills (Fig. 2, population H), and 15 of 32 were KoRV
positive in Kangaroo Island (Fig. 2, population I). No koalas
were recKoRV1 positive in the Kangaroo Island population
(founded by koala translocation in the 19th century). In the
Adelaide Hills, four of eight KoRV-positive koalas were also
positive for recKoRV1. Two of the eight KoRV-negative koalas
were recKoRV1 positive in Adelaide Hills, the only koalas in the
dataset to show this pattern.
Discussion
Degradation of ERV genomes, and loss of env in particular, may
benefit the host by preventing the production of virulent retro-
viruses that can spread horizontally (23). Our findings suggest
that the recombination mediated degradation of retroviruses,
which has been postulated for many human and other vertebrate
ERVs, and the genomic proliferation of recombinants both oc-
cur at the earliest stages of retroviral germ-line invasion (35–38).
This is supported by the presence of recKoRV1s in koalas across
almost all of Australia in both modern and historical samples,
and their high copy number in the koala genomes examined
(Figs. 1 and 2). KoRV is thought to have invaded the koala germ
line relatively recently, within the last 50,000 y (20). Thus, within
this time frame the recKoRVs were generated and recKoRV1s
arrived at the widespread distribution revealed here.
Seventeen recombination breakpoints were detected between
KoRV and PhER. Recombination occurred in some cases at
microhomologies, short sequences common to the two retroele-
ments that likely enabled recombination at many of the breakpoints,
including those of recKoRV1. Transcripts of PhER have been de-
tected in the koala transcriptome, suggesting that PhER could be
copackaged with KoRV in the same virion (29), enabling re-
combination. KoRV integrants may also have recombined with
retrotranscribed PhER during meiosis. In both KoRV and recK-
oRV1, target site duplications were generally detected in the host
genome flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends of the provirus, indicating that
recombination between retroelements at different loci had not af-
fected these integrants. Such recombinants, which can delete large
regions of the genome, may have been removed by selection. Once
a recKoRV is established in the germ line, it can spread vertically
(and geographically) across koala populations.
A high degree of population structuring was detected among
the different recombination breakpoints between KoRV and
PhER. In particular, the recKoRV1 3′ breakpoint was com-
pletely absent from some populations in New South Wales (Fig.
2), while the genomes of two koalas, one from Queensland and
one from coastal New South Wales, differed dramatically in their
complement of recombination breakpoints (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1). Genetic differentiation between Queensland and New South
Wales koalas has been reported in previous studies (39, 40),

 suggesting restricted gene flow between koalas in the two states,
perhaps in part due to the Great Dividing Range (Fig. 2). The
barrier to gene flow cannot be complete because KoRV is pre-
sent at high frequency in all of New South Wales and was thus likely
transferred from koalas in Queensland at some point. Additionally,
koala populations do not show high degrees of genetic structure
compared with other marsupials, although recent barriers to gene flow
may exist particularly in New South Wales (41, 42). We cannot rule
out the possibility that regional differences in PhER expression may
affect the genesis or distribution of recKoRVs by altering the amount
or type of PhER template available for recombination. However, it is
also possible that PhER and KoRV may be expressed and recombine
in any population where both are present. This is supported by the
analysis of KoRV-PhER recombination breakpoints in the genomes
of a koala from Queensland and a koala from New South Wales. The
two carried completely distinct sets of recombination breakpoints (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1), suggesting that recombinants between KoRV and
PhER formed independently in the two populations.
Several populations showed atypical patterns in the distribu-
tion of recKoRV1. In St. Bees Island off Queensland, only 4 of
15 koalas were recKoRV1 positive, but all were KoRV positive
(Fig. 2). This contrasts with mainland Queensland for which all
koalas tested (n = 48) were positive for both recKoRV1 and KoRV.
The St. Bees Island population was founded by translocation of 12–
17 koalas from mainland Queensland in the 1930s (43). The
founding population of St. Bees was small, likely with insertional
polymorphisms in each recKoRV1 locus. After the population ex-
panded, the koalas would reflect random combinations of the small
numbers of founder chromosomes. It may be that loci carrying
recKoRV1 were randomly lost through genetic drift, although it is
also possible that selection may have played a role.
In the Adelaide Hills of South Australia, several KoRV-
negative individuals proved to be recKoRV1 positive (Fig. 2).
KoRV copy number has been shown to decrease dramatically in
southern Australia based on qPCR targeting the pol gene, and
KoRVs rarely exist in both chromosomes in a given koala individual
even where copy numbers are high (17, 20). The recKoRV1-positive
individuals lacking KoRV likely reflect Mendelian segregation of
integrants in a population where both KoRV and recKoRV1s are
present at low copy numbers and at low frequencies at their re-
spective loci, so that only a limited proportion of individuals carry
either or both.
KoRV would suffer loss of virulence after recombination with
PhER because none of the recombinants are predicted to code
for an intact virus. Existing genomic elements like PhER would
proliferate by having parts of their sequences incorporated into
recKoRVs. While recKoRVs could still potentially exert dele-
terious effects on the host, e.g., by retrotransposition into new
genomic locations, other potentially deleterious effects of the provirus
would be reduced relative to intact KoRV, notably the ability of these
elements to produce infectious retrovirus. The switch to a proviral
form that is disrupted by recombination may be one aspect of the
transition from horizontal to vertical transmission among ERVs.
Over time, this would be expected to result in an increase in recK-
oRV abundance at the expense of virulent KoRV proviruses, po-
tentially reducing the impact of the latter. The pressure to make this
transition may be higher in long-lived species that are more likely to
be affected by ERVs with oncogenic potential (44). During the
transition period when infectious KoRV and recombinants coexist,
KoRV particles may de novo generate and horizontally transmit
recKoRVs (SI Appendix, Fig. S2) and in this manner coinfect host
cells, although superinfection resistance would likely limit novel
infection-mediated proliferation of both KoRV and recKoRVs (45).
In detecting large numbers of recombinants between KoRV
and PhER, we establish that recombination with existing retro-
elements may be one way in which the ability of retroviruses
invading the germ line to faithfully replicate is disrupted, by
removing their ability to encode active viruses associated with
disease. This would not be the only mechanism by which a host
species controls an invading ERV, since other factors are likely
to play a role, such as methylation or antiretroviral proteins or
disruptive within-KoRV recombination (as was evident for
KoRV22 and KoRV35, the only shared KoRV integrants iden-
tifed) (46). Nor would recKoRV lack potentially deleterious as-
pects of a provirus, as activation or disruption of genes at or near
insertion sites may still occur. However, the deleterious effects of
recKoRVs are not likely to be as great as those of KoRVs, and
recKoRVs may thus be less subject to purifying selection than
replication competent KoRVs, allowing recKoRVs to persist in the
host germ line. Several lines of evidence suggest that production of
recKoRVs may reflect a general means of accommodation between
ERV and host. The recKoRV proviruses would have a reduced
ability to proliferate relative to intact KoRV. The process of
recKoRV formation has occurred frequently and independently,
given the many recKoRVs identified and geographic differences
in the occurrence of breakpoints. The degraded nature of recKoRV1
is also consistent with inferences drawn from more ancient ERVs
in vertebrate genomes, notably the concept of genomic super-
spreaders, which suggests that retroviruses that lose the env gene
will be more successful at propagating in host genomes than
intact ERVs (23). It is also consistent with the exchange of se-
quences between divergent retroviruses, which has been inferred
for ERVs in various host species (35–38, 47). For example, some
human ERVs are believed to have recombined before their pro-
liferation (38). This suggests that recombination-based degrada-
tion has occurred during invasions of vertebrate germ lines by
different groups of retroviruses. Our study demonstrates empiri-
cally that the generation of such recombinants occurs during the
early stages of genomic invasion by ERVs of a host germ line.
Materials and Methods
Koala Samples, PCR, and Sequencing. Four sources of genomic data were
employed in the current study (additional details on the samples and datasets
are provided in Table 1 and SI Appendix). We used Illumina-based genome
sequences (unassembled) from two koalas, Pacific Chocolate and Birkie
(Table 1) (26). This dataset was screened for KoRV and PhER breakpoints.
Additionally, existing Illumina datasets were reexamined for KoRV and PhER
breakpoints (Table 1 and SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods) (22). Two
PacBio-based datasets were used to investigate KoRV and PhER breakpoints,
and to identify and characterize proviral integration sites. The first of these
was the assembled genome of Bilbo (26), and the second consisted of the
integration site-enriched PacBio sequences from Pci-SN241 (Bilyarra, de-
scribed below) (Table 1). DNA extraction and analyses of the data are de-
scribed in detail in the SI Appendix. Finally, 166 wild koala DNA samples
were collected by J. Meers, and P.Y. and their associates (17). The DNA from
the 166 samples was extracted using the Blood & Tissue DNA Extraction Kit
(Qiagen) or was provided by collaborators. The DNA was amplified for the
recoKoRV 3′ breakpoint (with the koala actin gene used as a positive control
for DNA quality). The amplified recKoRV PCR products were Sanger se-
quenced to establish their identity as the recKoRV1 3′ breakpoint. The SI
Appendix provides details on the PCR and sequencing.
Inverse PCR and PacBio Sequencing of recKoRV. DNA from Bilyarra was
fragmented and circularized in four steps (detailed in SI Appendix). These
were as follows: (i) DNA fragmentation, (ii) fragment end repair and circu-
larization, (iii) KoRV LTR-based LTR long inverse PCR, and (iv) PacBio se-
quencing of the products. PCR products were submitted for PacBio library
construction and sequencing to the Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, and stan-
dard PacBio RSII sequencing was performed (details provided in SI Appen-
dix). Bioinformatics analyses were conducted both to identify Bilyarra’s
integration sites and to identify whether the integrants were KoRV or
recKoRV (SI Appendix). Bilyarra PacBio sequences were aligned to a custom
KoRV database. Blastn (NCBI Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST 2.2.29+) was used
with default options to generate the alignments (48). Reads that did not
include regions homologous to KoRV were considered KoRV-negative reads.
KoRV-positive reads were aligned to the full-length PhER sequence using
blastn with default parameters. PhER-negative reads were considered KoRV
sequences and not recKoRV sequences. PhER-positive reads were initially
considered to be sequences potentially containing recKoRV1. The 5′

 breakpoint was generally more poorly covered by PacBio sequences because
the breakpoint is several kilobases from the start of the proviral genome,
compared with the 3′ breakpoint that is 200 bp from the end of the 3′ LTR (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3). Description of the procedures for individual locus con-
firmation by PCR and Sanger sequencing is in SI Appendix.
To isolate the host genomic sequences flanking integration sites for KoRV
and recKoRV, the KoRV containing reads were aligned using blastn to the
KoRV-A or KoRV-B reference sequences (AB721500.1; KC779547). Regions
homologous to the reference sequences were removed. The isolated host
genomic sequences flanking integrations sites were clustered using Tribe-MCL
(I = 1.4) (49), a Markov cluster-based approach, processing distance-based in-
formation of a blastn matrix for all KoRV containing reads (49). The recKoRV1-
containing reads were aligned using blastn to the KoRV-A and KoRV-B
reference sequences, as well as to PhER, all known recKoRV breakpoints and
the consensus sequence of recKoRV1. Regions homologous to any of the ref-
erence sequences were removed. The isolated flanking regions were clustered
using Tribe-MCL (I = 4). A consensus sequence for every cluster was created by
constructing a multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT (v7.305b) (50) and
computing a consensus sequence using the Perl module BioPerl:SimpleAlign
(30% identity, gap removal) (51). Further curation is detailed in SI Appendix.
Network Analysis of LTRs. LTRs from all insertion sites of Bilbo and Bilyarra
were aligned with the LTR sequences of the KoRV proviruses examined in ref.
20, along with KoRV-A (AB721500.1) and KoRV-B (KC779547.1). The iPCR
primer gaps were removed from all sequences. Multiple sequence alignment
was performed using MAFFT L-INS-i (50). The alignment was cropped to the
most conserved regions (>89% identity) on both ends, realigned, and
manually curated. A haplotype network was constructed using the R (52)
package Pegas (53) with the distance model “indelblock,” performing an
iterative refinement for the smallest sum of distances.
