Abstract
Background: Patients undergoing treatment for cancer are at increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). There are few data
on AKI incidence and risk factors in the current era of cancer treatment.
Methods: We conducted a population-based study of all patients initiating systemic therapy (chemotherapy or targeted
agents) for a new cancer diagnosis in Ontario, Canada (2007–2014). The primary outcome was hospitalization with AKI or
acute dialysis. We estimated the cumulative incidence of AKI and fitted Fine and Gray models, adjusting for demographics,
cancer characteristics, comorbidities, and coprescriptions. We modeled exposure to systemic therapy (the 90-day period fol-
lowing treatments) as a time-varying covariate. We also assessed temporal trends in annual AKI incidence.
Results: We identified 163 071 patients initiating systemic therapy of whom 10 880 experienced AKI. The rate of AKI was
27 per 1000 person-years, with overall cumulative incidence of 9.3% (95% CI ¼ 9.1% to 9.6%). Malignancies with the highest
5-year AKI incidence were myeloma (26.0%, 95% CI ¼ 24.4% to 27.7%), bladder (19.0%, 95% CI ¼ 17.6% to 20.5%), and leukemia
(15.4%, 95% CI ¼ 14.3% to 16.5%). Advanced cancer stage, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes were associated with increased
risk of AKI (adjusted hazard ratios [aHR] ¼ 1.41, 95% CI ¼ 1.28 to 1.54; 1.80, 95% CI ¼ 1.67 to 1.93; and 1.43, 95% CI ¼ 1.37 to 1.50,
respectively). In patients aged 66 years or older with universal drug benefits, diuretic, and angiotensin-converting enzyme in-
hibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker coprescription was associated with higher AKI risk (aHR ¼ 1.20, 95% CI ¼ 1.14 to 1.28;
1.30, 95% CI ¼ 1.23 to 1.38). AKI risk was further accentuated during the 90-day period following systemic therapy (aHR ¼ 2.34,
95% CI ¼ 2.24 to 2.45). The annual incidence of AKI increased from 18 to 52 per 1000 person-years between 2007 and 2014.
Conclusion: Cancer-related AKI is common and associated with advanced stage, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and
concomitant receipt of diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers. Risk is height-
ened in the 90 days after systemic therapy. Preventive strategies are needed to address the increasing burden of AKI in this
population.
Cancer patients receiving treatment are known to have elevated
risk
for
acute
kidney
injury
(AKI)
(1–4).
Chemotherapy-
associated nephrotoxicity, hypercalcemia, tumor lysis syn-
drome, paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis, and obstructive ne-
phropathy are among the multiple causes of AKI inherent to
patients with cancer (5–7). These patients are also subject to
increased risks of noncancer-specific causes of AKI, such as vol-
ume depletion, nephrotoxic medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, diuretics, renin-angiotensin system block-
ade) and contrast-induced nephropathy. AKI is of particular
concern in this population, as a reduction in kidney function
may delay or even preclude appropriate cancer therapies.

 Single-center studies have estimated that, short-term (ie, <6
months) mortality ranges from 51% to 87% after an episode of
severe AKI for which dialysis was administered (AKI-D) (8–12).
Despite myriad risks to kidney function and its important
prognostic implications, there is a paucity of data characterizing
the burden of AKI in cancer patients, particularly in the contem-
porary era of cancer treatment. A 2006 study estimated that 12%
of admissions to a comprehensive cancer center were compli-
cated by AKI (13). A Danish study using data from 1999 to 2006
estimated that the 1-year incidence of more severe forms of AKI
(eg, RIFLE criteria categories of “injury” or “failure,” which
are more likely to require hospitalization or dialysis) (14) was
13% (15).
However, considerable advances in the treatment of many
cancer types have been made in the last decade, including in
multiple myeloma (16,17) and kidney cancers (including kidney-
preserving approaches, such as partial nephrectomy) (18,19).
Also, targeted and immunotherapies have changed both out-
comes in many cancers, as well as the potential adverse kidney
sequelae (20–23). As such, a reassessment of AKI incidence
across various cancer types in the current era of cancer treat-
ment is warranted.
We conducted a population-based cohort study of patients
undergoing systemic treatment for cancer in Ontario, Canada.
Our objectives were to assess the incidence of clinically relevant
AKI (including hospitalizations for AKI or receipt of dialysis) and
to identify patient-level risk factors. We also evaluated tempo-
ral
trends
in
AKI
and
AKI-D
incidence
in
this
high-risk
population.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
We designed a population-based study of all adult patients initi-
ating systemic therapy for an incident cancer diagnosis in
Ontario, Canada between April 1, 2007 and March 31, 2014.
Ontario is Canada’s most populous province with 13 million res-
idents who receive single-payer publically funded healthcare
under the Ontario Health Insurance Plan.
This study was conducted using data from the Institute of
Clinical Evaluative Sciences with a prespecified protocol, and
was approved by the Research Ethics Board at Sunnybrook
Health
Sciences
Centre (Supplementary
Table 1, available
online).
Population and Data Sources
We used Ontario-wide administrative datasets to identify
patients, determine baseline characteristics, and ascertain out-
comes. These datasets were linked using unique encoded iden-
tifiers and analyzed at the Institute of Clinical Evaluative
Sciences. We included all adult patients (>18 years of age) who
initiated systemic therapy for an incident cancer diagnosis dur-
ing the study period. We did not impose restriction on the time
from cancer diagnosis to initiation of systemic treatment and
therefore allowed for the inclusion of individuals who may have
received (their first) systemic therapy due to disease progres-
sion or recurrence. We excluded patients with more than one
cancer diagnosis in the five years before starting therapy be-
cause we could not definitively ascribe their therapy to a spe-
cific cancer diagnosis. We also excluded patients with a history
of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), defined as receipt of dialysis
in the one year before to the start of systemic cancer therapy or
kidney transplant (after 1981).
Patients with cancer were identified using the Ontario
Cancer Registry. This registry contains data on all incident can-
cers in Ontario (except nonmelanoma skin cancers) since 1964,
and has been estimated to be more than 95% complete (24).
Cancer
diagnoses
were
coded
according
to
International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) codes.
Classification of 29 cancer diagnoses was done as per the ICD-O-
3 definitions used by the 2016 Ontario Cancer Statistics report
(Supplementary Table 2, available online) (25). The Registered
Persons Database was used to obtain vital status, age, sex, and
other demographic information.
The initiation of systemic treatment was determined using
evidence from one or more of four administrative data sources
that record the receipt of cancer therapies (Supplementary
Methods, available online). The earliest date of any entry within
these four datasets was used to identify the start of systemic
treatment and this served as the index date for the time-to-
event analyses. Data from these sources was also used to deter-
mine the receipt of subsequent courses of systemic therapy dur-
ing the follow-up period.
Comorbidities and receipt of hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plant (HSCT) were ascertained using the Canadian Institute for
Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI DAD) us-
ing International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
codes as well as physician billing codes under the Ontario
Health Insurance Plan in the three years before systemic ther-
apy initiation (26,27).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was defined as time to first hospitaliza-
tion with AKI or receipt of acute dialysis. We identified hospi-
talization with AKI using the ICD-10 “N17” within the CIHI
DAD. This diagnostic code for AKI has a positive predictive
value of more than 90% and has been shown to reflect more
severe AKI, with an associated median (interquartile range
[IQR]) serum creatinine increase of 1.11 (0.49 to 2.26) mg/dL
from baseline (28,29). Acute dialysis was ascertained from di-
alysis billing claims (Supplementary Table 3, available online)
(30). Dialysis codes, which are associated with physician reim-
bursement and are less likely to be inaccurate, have been used
in previous studies of AKI incidence (30,31). A secondary out-
come restricted to AKI-D was assessed on the basis of these
codes as well.
Statistical Analyses
We calculated the 1- and 5-year cumulative incidences of AKI
and AKI-D for all cancers, as well as individual cancer types,
and reported events per 1000 patient-years. We used multivari-
able Fine and Gray models for the risk of AKI and AKI-D. Model
covariates included age, sex, cancer type (breast cancer as the
referent because it was the most common malignancy in our
cohort), cancer stage (stage I as the referent), year of systemic
therapy start, and the presence of one or more comorbid condi-
tions (including myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease,
heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, chronic liver dis-
ease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, de-
mentia,
chronic
kidney
disease,
chronic
lung
disease,
gastrointestinal bleeding, and HIV). We accounted for the com-
peting risks of death and ESRD by estimating subdistribution

 hazard ratios as per the method of Fine and Gray (32). We con-
sidered a two-sided P value less than .05 as statistically signifi-
cant. We performed all analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
Secondary Analyses
We conducted secondary analyses to further characterize AKI
risk in this population, including: 1) the effect of recent systemic
therapy (ie, AKI risk in the 90-day period after systemic treat-
ments); 2) the effect of coprescribed medications; 3) temporal
trends in AKI incidence; and 4) AKI risk associated with spe-
cific therapies in high-risk cancers. Descriptions of these anal-
yses are included in the Supplementary Methods (available
online).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
We identified 163 071 individuals initiating systemic therapy for
an incident cancer diagnosis between 2007 and 2014 (Figure 1).
Median (IQR) follow-up was 1.85 (0.77 to 3.83) years. Baseline
characteristics are shown in Table 1. Mean age was 61.9
(SD ¼ 13.3) years and 57.1% were female. The cancer stage at
diagnosis was available for 71.4% of the cohort, with 19.3% of
patients having stage IV cancers. The most common cancers
were breast (23.4%), colorectal (13.2%), lung (12.7%), non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (6.3%), and prostate (4.7%). Noncancer
comorbidities were frequent, including hypertension (41.2%),
diabetes mellitus (20.0%), and coronary artery disease (14.3%).
Preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) was recorded in
4.0%.
AKI Incidence Across Cancer Types
A total of 10 880 patients experienced an AKI-associated hospi-
talization or received acute dialysis over 403 538 patient-years
of follow-up (Table 2). The rate of AKI was 27 per 1000 person-
years (PY). The overall cumulative incidence of AKI (over
8 years) was 9.3% (95% CI ¼ 9.1% to 9.6%) for patients initiating
systemic therapy for any cancer. The overall cumulative inci-
dence of AKI-D was 0.9% (95% CI ¼ 0.8% to 1.0%). Median (IQR)
time from initiation of systemic therapy to AKI was 276
(87–704) days. Median (IQR) time from the most recent sys-
temic therapy exposure to AKI was 33 (9–177) days. Cumulative
incidence curves for death, AKI, and ESRD are shown in
Figure 2.
AKI and AKI-D event rates, as well as 1- and 5-year cumula-
tive incidence estimates, for each of the 29 cancer diagnoses are
shown in Table 2. Cancers with the highest 5-year cumulative
incidence of AKI included multiple myeloma (26.0%, 95% CI ¼
24.4% to 27.7%), bladder cancer (19.0%, 95% CI ¼ 17.6% to 20.5%),
leukemia (15.4%, 95% CI ¼ 14.3% to 16.5%), renal (13.9%, 95%
CI ¼ 12.1% to 15.9%), and liver cancer (11.7%, 95% CI ¼ 9.5% to
14.2%). AKI-D was comparatively infrequent, with multiple my-
eloma patients most frequently experiencing AKI-D (4.1%, 95%
CI ¼ 3.4% to 4.9%), followed by patients with leukemia (2.6%, 95%
CI ¼ 2.2% to 3.1%).
After adjustment for potential confounders, the highest haz-
ard ratios for AKI (relative to breast cancer) were observed in
multiple myeloma, bladder cancer, and cervical cancer with
adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) (95% CI) of 4.30 (3.83 to 4.82), 3.69
(3.28 to 4.16), and 3.47 (2.90 to 4.14), respectively (Figure 3).
Patient-Level Risk Factors for AKI and Effect of Recent
Systemic Therapy
Increasing age and male sex were modestly associated with in-
creased AKI risk (Table 3). More advanced cancer stage at the
time of diagnosis was also associated with increased AKI risk
(HR ¼ 1.41, 95% CI ¼ 1.28 to 1.54).
Comorbidities most strongly associated with AKI included
CKD, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure (aHR ¼ 1.80,
95% CI ¼ 1.67 to 1.93; 1.43, 95% CI ¼ 1.37 to 1.50; and 1.36, 95%
CI ¼ 1.27 to 1.45, respectively). A previous history of AKI was
also statistically significantly associated with subsequent risk
(aHR ¼ 1.69, 95% CI ¼ 1.56 to 1.83) (Table 3).
The 90-day period after systemic therapy exposure was asso-
ciated with a heightened (cause-specific) aHR (95% CI) for AKI of
2.34 (2.24 to 2.45) vs time periods more distant (ie, >90 days) from
systemic therapy exposure (Table 4). The cause-specific aHR (95%
CI) for AKI-D following recent systemic therapy was similarly ele-
vated at 2.03 (1.75 to 2.35) in the time-varying covariate model.
Effect of Coprescription at Systemic Therapy Initiation
and Temporal Trends in AKI Incidence
There were 68 481 individuals (42.0%) who were more than
65 years of age at the time of systemic therapy initiation
(Table 1). Of these, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or
angiotensin-receptor blockers were prescribed in 51.3%, beta-
blockers in 28.7%, calcium channel blockers in 27.1%, diuretics
in 29.1%, NSAIDs in 15.2%, and statins in 45.4%.
Prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or
angiotensin-receptor blockers at the time of systemic therapy
was most strongly associated with AKI risk (aHR ¼ 1.30, 95%
CI ¼ 1.23 to 1.38), followed by diuretic prescription (aHR ¼ 1.20,
95% CI ¼ 1.14 to 1.28) (Table 4). Beta-blocker and calcium chan-
nel blocker prescriptions were also modestly associated with
AKI risk, although statins were not.
The annual incidence of AKI increased nearly threefold over
the study period (from 18 to 52 events per 1000 patient-years, P
value for trend <.001) and the AKI-D rate more than doubled
(from 2.1 to 4.4 events per 1000 patient-years) (Figure 4).

 AKI Risk Associated With Therapies in High-Risk
Cancers (Post Hoc Analysis)
Adjusted hazard ratios for AKI risk associated with bladder can-
cer, multiple myeloma, and leukemia therapies are shown in
Table 5. Cisplatin- vs carboplatin-based regimens did not differ
with respect to AKI risk; however, regimens without platinum-
based agents were less likely to associate with AKI (aHR ¼ 0.76,
95% CI ¼ 0.59 to 0.99).
In multiple myeloma, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, im-
munomodulatory, and bisphosphonate therapies were associ-
ated with reduced risk of AKI. The 30-day period following HSCT
was associated with increased AKI risk; however, the 31–90-day
and 91-day-to-1-year periods after HSCT were associated with
reduced risk.
In leukemia, regimens associated with acute leukemia treat-
ment were associated with an increased risk of AKI. HSCT was
associated with an increase in AKI risk (in all postexposure time
periods).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate the considerable burden of AKI among
patients who initiate systemic therapy for cancer in the current
era of cancer treatment. Nearly one in 10 patients initiating sys-
temic cancer therapy will experience a hospitalization or re-
ceive acute dialysis for AKI. The 5-year cumulative incidence for
AKI reached as high as 15% to 26% for the top three high-risk
malignancies. This magnitude of AKI risk may be underappreci-
ated by both clinicians and patients commencing systemic can-
cer treatment, given the paucity of existing data (13). Moreover,
despite the advances in cancer therapy, our results remain
largely congruent with estimates observed in the 1999 to 2006

 cumulative incidence of the RIFLE “injury” and “failure” catego-
ries was 14.6% and 7.6%, respectively) (15). However, unlike
patients in the Danish study, our cohort was restricted to those
who received systemic treatment and were likely more suscep-
tible to AKI.
Patients initiating treatment for multiple myeloma, bladder
cancer, and leukemia had the highest incidence of AKI. The
high risk of AKI associated with multiple myeloma is recognized
and attributable to the many mechanisms by which kidney in-
jury may occur in paraprotein disease, including cast nephropa-
thy, hypercalcemia, and glomerulopathies (eg, immunoglobulin
deposition diseases and amyloidosis) (33–35). Novel treatments
including bortezomib-based regimens have been purported to
decrease mortality (36–38) and ESRD (16); however our data sug-
gests the risk of hospitalization and acute dialysis for AKI
remains high. When we assessed the risk of AKI across mye-
loma treatments, receipt of bortezomib was associated with de-
creased risk. We also observed decreased AKI risk associated
with cyclophosphamide and immunomodulatory drug thera-
pies. This is consistent with a recent observational study
reporting improved kidney outcomes in 83 patients receiving
bortezomib “triplet” therapies (ie, bortezomib and dexametha-
sone
plus
cyclophosphamide
or
thalidomide)
versus
bortezomib-dexamethasone
(“doublet”)
therapy
(39).
Bisphosphonate use was also associated with reduced AKI risk.
This suggests that the benefit of mitigating hypercalcemia-
related AKI may outweigh the well-described, but rare, phe-
nomenon of bisphosphonate-related nephrotoxicity (40).
The excess AKI risk observed in bladder and cervical cancers
is likely reflective of obstructive (postrenal) AKI in these malig-
nancies (3,41), as well as exposure to potentially nephrotoxic
platinum-based chemotherapies (42). This risk is of particular
concern as AKI in the setting of bladder cancer has been linked
with substantially increased risks of de novo CKD and death
(43). When we assessed specific therapies in bladder cancer, cis-
platin- and carboplatin-based therapies did not differ with re-
spect to AKI risk, despite putatively lower nephrotoxicity with
the latter (44). This finding supports results of a small phase 2
study that did not demonstrate a difference in kidney toxicity in
patients
receiving
gemcitabine-cisplatin
vs
gemcitabine-

 carboplatin for bladder cancer (45). It is likely, however, that
patients receiving carboplatin in our cohort had reduced base-
line kidney function and, as such, were predisposed to AKI due
to underlying CKD.
The increased risk of AKI seen in leukemias and other hema-
tologic cancers in our study confirms the findings of smaller
cohorts (9,46), and may be attributable to the risks of sepsis,
volume depletion, and tumor lysis syndrome (which are more
likely to occur in the setting of acute vs chronic leukemia
treatments).
HSCT was associated with a statistically significant increase
in AKI risk in leukemia and may be attributable to the recog-
nized kidney risks of acute tubular necrosis, hepatic sinusoidal
obstructive syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy (47). In
myeloma, however, HSCT was associated with AKI risk only in
the first 30 days post-HSCT and was associated with decreased
risk in later time periods post-HSCT, suggesting improved
disease control associated with HSCT results in less myeloma-
related kidney injury after the initial period in which periproce-
dural kidney complications may occur. This finding supports
data from smaller cohorts suggesting that HSCT is associated
with more favorable kidney prognosis and may be considered in
some patients with kidney dysfunction (48,49).
The comparative risks of AKI across cancer types in our
study differ from the findings of the Danish study (15), in which
renal cancers were associated with the highest risk. This differ-
ence may reflect more recent trends toward less invasive and
kidney-sparing treatment options for renal cancers, such as
partial nephrectomy, which has been shown to reduce the inci-
dence of AKI vs radical nephrectomies (50,51).
Our findings highlight the substantial burden of comorbidity
in “real-world” patients initiating systemic therapies for cancer
and demonstrate that those with a history of CKD, diabetes,
and/or congestive heart failure are at substantially increased
risk for AKI. These conditions have been shown to potentiate
the
risks
of
systemic
therapy-associated
nephrotoxicities
(52,53), as well as increase the likelihood of prerenal states, and
polypharmacy (4,54). As such, close monitoring of blood pres-
sure and volume status in patients with congestive heart fail-
ure,
CKD,
and
hypertension
during
systemic
therapy
is
warranted. Similarly, among patients with diabetes, hypoglyce-
mic agents may require adjustment based on current glycemic
control and kidney function (55).
In our cohort, a sizable proportion of older patients were fill-
ing prescriptions for medications such as diuretics, angioten-
sin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors,
or
angiotensin-receptor
blockers when starting systemic treatment. These agents were
associated with an increased AKI risk of 20%–30%. This may be
because an elevated risk of hemodynamic/prerenal insults to
the kidney when patients are hypovolemic as a result of re-
duced oral intake or gastrointestinal side effects of cancer ther-
apy. Holding or discontinuing these medications at the time of
systemic therapy initiation, particularly when emetogenic anti-
cancer therapies are administered, may represent a risk reduc-
tion strategy for selected patients. Current oncology clinical
practice guidelines do not comment on modifying antihyper-
tensives during systemic therapy. Routine dose modification or
temporary cessation of antihypertensives and other potentially
nephrotoxic drugs during systemic cancer therapy warrants in-
vestigation as a method to mitigate adverse events (56,57), in-
cluding AKI.
Most AKI events in this population occurred in close proximity
to cancer treatment itself (median 33days from last treatment),
rather than after treatment discontinuation or end-of-life care. The
more than twofold increased hazard of AKI during the 90 days fol-
lowing systemic therapy may represent a window for heightened
clinical and biochemical (eg, serum creatinine) surveillance.
The incidence of AKI increased statistically significantly
over the study period. Although this may reflect increased rec-
ognition and administrative coding of AKI hospitalizations, the
rates of AKI-D also increased substantially during this period.

 This may reflect trends toward increasing age and comorbid-
ities among patients initiating cancer treatment (58–60). Despite
the advent of novel therapies, the burgeoning population of el-
derly cancer patients with AKI-predisposing comorbidities may
continue to present challenges to oncology and nephrology care
providers in the coming years.
Our study has several strengths. We evaluated all adult
patients undergoing systemic cancer treatment in a diverse uni-
versal health-care system. We employed clinically relevant and
validated AKI outcomes, accounting for the competing risk
of death. Our data permitted assessment of multiple comorbid-
ities.

 coprescriptions in a large subcohort of older patients with avail-
able medication data.
Our study also has important limitations to consider. As we
did not have serum creatinine data and were limited to AKI hos-
pitalizations and acute dialysis events, less severe AKI episodes
were likely not captured in our analysis; this may have resulted
in an underestimation of overall AKI incidence. It is likely, how-
ever, that the AKI events we captured represented clinically rel-
evant episodes of kidney injury. Our analysis of patient-level
risk factors for AKI may have also been susceptible to confound-
ing by indication. The observed increased risk associated with
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor
blockers, diuretics, and other antihypertensives may have been
confounded by the increased risk conferred by conditions for
which these drugs are indicated (ie, diabetes, congestive heart
failure, and CKD). Similarly, our analysis of risk related to spe-
cific therapies (ie, use of cisplatin vs carboplatin, or receipt of
HSCT) may have been affected by confounding by indication, as
risk factors for AKI (and general prognostic markers) may influ-
ence the receipt of these treatments. Also, missing covariate
data, particularly on cancer staging at diagnosis, may have bi-
ased our effect estimates. Finally, our analysis was limited by
the inability to ascribe etiologies to the AKI events observed.
Distinguishing events related to therapy (including prerenal
insults and nephrotoxicity) vs direct effects of disease would be
of benefit in devising cancer- and therapy-specific AKI risk re-
duction strategies.
In conclusion, patients undergoing systemic treatment for
cancers are at high risk of hospitalization and acute dialysis for
AKI, with nearly one in 10 patients experiencing an episode of
kidney injury. Patients with multiple myeloma, bladder cancer,
cervical cancer, and leukemia are at highest risk. Comorbidities
and coprescriptions influenced this risk, which was highest in
the peritreatment period. Further efforts should focus on the
development of robust prediction tools for AKI as well as viable
strategies for AKI prevention in patients undergoing cancer
therapy.
