Background: Although not incorporated into current cervical cancer screening guidelines,
racial differences are known to persist in both occurrence of and outcomes related to cer-
vical cancer.
Objective: To compare the differences in progression and regression of precancerous
lesions of the uterine cervix on cervical cytologic analysis among women of different
races who adhered to cervical cancer screening recommendations and follow-up.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study comparing differences in precancerous lesion diag-
noses for patients receiving adequate evaluation according to the American Society for
Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology guidelines. The authors fit Markov multistate models
to estimate self-reported race-specific expected wait times and hazard ratios for each pos-
sible regression and progression and compared a race model with an intercept-only model
using a likelihood ratio test.
Results: The sample included 5472 women receiving a Papanicolaou test between January
2006 and September 2016, contributing a total of 24,316 person-years of follow-up. Of 21
hazard ratios tested for significance, the following 4 hazard ratios (95% CIs) were statistic-
ally significant: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) progres-
sion to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) for Hispanic patients (0.72; 95%
CI, 0.54-0.96); LSIL regression to ASC-US for Hispanic patients (1.55; 95% CI, 1.04-
2.31), LSIL regression to ASC-US for Asian patients (1.91; 95% CI, 1.08-3.36), and
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion regression to LSIL for black patients (0.39;
95% CI, 0.16-0.96). There is an observed trend that all racial groups other than white had
a slower rate of progression from ASC-US to LSIL, with Hispanics having demonstrated
the slowest rate from ASC-US to LSIL. Hispanics also demonstrated the fastest rate from
LSIL to HSIL when compared with all other race categories. In regressions, blacks had
the slowest rate of regression from HSIL to LSIL, and Asians had the fastest rate from
LSIL to ASC-US. The Hispanic group demonstrated the fastest expected progression
(17.6 months; 95% CI, 11.5-25.5), as well as the fastest regression (27.6 months; 95% CI,
21.5-35.6), and the black group has the slowest expected times for both progression (28.1
months; 95% CI, 14.6-47.2) and regression (49 months; 95% CI, 29.1-86.2). The number
of visits (1 vs ≥2) in the study was differentially distributed both by race (P=.033) and by
last diagnosis (P<.001).
Conclusion: Variations in precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix are not uniform across
races.

 T
he American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates
that 12,990 women will receive a diagnosis of
invasive cervical cancer, and 4120 women will
have died of the disease, in 2016 in the United States.1
Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates have
declined by more than 60% since the introduction of
the Papanicolaou (Pap) test in the mid-20th century,
and overall rates continue to decline with the refinement
and revision of screening guidelines2 and widespread
application by primary care physicians and obstetri-
cians and gynecologists.
In 2012, the ACS, the American Society for
Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), and the
American Society for Clinical Pathology issued joint
guidelines for cervical cancer screening.3 Similar
recommendations were released in 2012 by the US
Preventive Services Task Force.4 The screening guide-
lines recommend different surveillance strategies and
options based on a woman’s age, screening history,
other risk factors, and the choice of screening tests.
However, race is not currently included in these screen-
ing guidelines, and a paucity of studies consider the
ways in which race may inform cervical cancer screen-
ing strategies in the United States. Studies that have
considered race in cervical cancer screening have
focused mainly on access to care and follow-up for
treatment rather than the pathogenesis of precancerous
lesions themselves.5-7
Although not incorporated into current guidelines,
racial differences are known to persist in both the
occurrence of and outcomes related to cervical cancer.
In 2016, black women had a 41% greater incidence
and 2 times greater mortality rate compared with white
women,1 with the gap in survival increasing during the
past few decades.8 These differences have in part been
attributed to social and institutional factors, such as dif-
ferential access to high-volume hospital centers,9 dis-
parities in research enrollment,10 inequalities in health
insurance coverage,11 and lower rate of human papillo-
mavirus (HPV) vaccination in blacks vs whites.12 The
role of biological factors in progression and regression
of precancerous lesions of the cervix before reaching
the stage of invasive cervical cancer, however, is not
well characterized. These potential biological factors
include known regional distribution of types and intra-
type variants of HPV,13,14 as well as an association
between race and HPV coinfection rates.15
The goal of this study was to evaluate for potential
differences in the rates of progression and regression
of precancerous lesions of the uterine cervix on cervical
cytologic analysis among women of different races/eth-
nicities who received adequate adherence to cervical
cancer screening recommendations by the ASCCP and
follow-up within our institution on the basis of race,
lesion change (progression or regression), and time to
change.
Methods
Design
This investigation was a retrospective cohort study
approved by the institutional review board at NYU
Lutheran Medical Center. Medical records from all
patients who received screening for cervical cancer
from January 2006 through September 2016 were
reviewed. The period was selected based on availability
from the initiation of our institution’s electronic
medical record (EMR) system through the study’s insti-
tutional review board approval date. The following
International
Classification
of
Diseases,
Ninth
Revision codes were used to identify patients through
the EMR: “795.03: papanicolaou smear of cervix with
low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL),”
“795.04: papanicolaou smear of cervix with high
grade
squamous
intraepithelial
lesion
(HSIL),”
“795.02: papanicolaou smear of cervix with atypical
squamous cells cannot exclude high grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H),” and “795.01: papani-
colaou smear of cervix with atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance.”
A diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was
given and recorded in the EMR by a primary care phys-
ician (family medicine, internal medicine, obstetrics
and gynecology) and was managed by the same

 physician according to the ASCCP guidelines. These
guidelines were used respective to the time in which
the diagnosis was given; namely, patients who received
a diagnosis before the release of the 2012 guidelines16
were treated according to the 2006 guidelines.17
Patients who elected to have their precancerous
lesion monitored were included in the study. Patients
who received an excisional procedure of any type were
excluded from the study, as this procedure would con-
found true regression or progression of a precancerous
lesion. Because dates for excisional procedures were
inconsistently recorded in the EMR, patients who had
excisional procedures were excluded regardless of the
purported temporal order of transitions (time to pro-
gression or regression) and procedures. Data abstracted
from the patient’s medical record included the date and
type of diagnosis, patient age, and self-reported race.
Variables
The primary outcomes as measured from Pap test
results were (1) the expected time to progression test-
showing (a) ASC-US to LSIL; and (b) the expected
time to progression from LSIL to HSIL; and (2) the
time to regression test showing (a) HSIL to LSIL; and
(b) LSIL to ASC-US. As secondary outcomes, we
examined Pap test rests of (1) progression from “atyp-
ical squamous cells cannot exclude HSIL” (ASC-H) to
HSIL, and (2) regression from HSIL to ASC-H. We
considered
the
ASC-H/HSIL
pathway
separately
because our first goal was to describe overall expected
progression and regression curves, and ASC-H does
not have a clear position between ASC-US and LSIL
or between LSIL and HSIL.
Self-reported race categories were combined based
on the definitions detailed by the National Institutes of
Health for race reporting,18 which contain 6 minimum
categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian,
black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and white. In the
remainder of this article, we use the terms Native
American, Asian, black, Hispanic, Pacific Islander,
and white.
Statistical Analysis
To model the multiple status changes per patient and
allow for correlation between measurements, we used
a multistate Markov model19 to estimate hazard ratios
and predicted times to progression from ASC-US to
LSIL, LSIL to HSIL and ASC-H to HSIL; and regres-
sion from LSIL to ASC-US, HSIL to LSIL, and HSIL
to ASC-H. The main model included a term for race.
Because of very low patient counts for Native
American, Pacific Islander, and other (including multi-
racial) patients, these categories were dropped from the
regression model. For each patient, we added an obser-
vation on the cutoff date for data collection (the date of
study approval), in which the state was marked as cen-
sored, to allow patients whose lesions had not pro-
gressed or regressed to be included in the denominator
of the hazard function. No additional covariates
were included in the model, as this was primarily a
descriptive study and not intended to control for
confounding.
The primary hypothesis was that rates of progres-
sion and regression differ by race overall. This
hypothesis was tested using a χ2 likelihood ratio test
for nested models to compare the model using race
with an intercept-only model. Results from the
multistate model are presented as hazard ratios, 95%
CIs, and expected wait times for each transition by
race, along with a P value for the global hypothesis
test.
Because of the varying rate of follow-up, it was
plausible for selection bias to occur if race (the expos-
ure) and rate of progression/regression (the outcome)
were both associated with likelihood of continued
follow-up. To assess this possibility, we examined
both the association between race and the number of
follow-up visits and between the last diagnosis
recorded and the number of follow-up visits. Both asso-
ciations were tested using a Pearson χ2 test. Statistical
significance for all tests was determined at α<.05. All
statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.3.1
for Windows,20 and multistate models were fit using
the msm package for R.21

 Results
We identified 8589 potentially eligible patients, from
which 954 (11.1%) were excluded because they had
an excision procedure. An additional 1333 patients
(17.5%) were excluded because race was not recorded
in their medical record, and 830 patients (10.9%) were
excluded owing to unsatisfactory Pap test results.
Therefore, the analytic sample included 5472 women
receiving a Pap test between January 2006 and
September 2016, contributing a total of 24,316 person-
years of follow-up time. Descriptive statistics are pre-
sented in Table 1 and Table 2. The mean (SD) baseline
age was 34.5 (12.1) years (range, 13-91 years) for those
included in the sample. The sample was racially
diverse, with 2019 (36.9%) self-reporting as Hispanic,
1160 (21.2%) as black, 389 (7.1%) as Asian, and 1878
(34.3%) as white.
The majority of patients (3420 [62.5%]) received a
diagnosis of ASC-US during follow-up; 651 (11.9%)
ever had a diagnosis of ASC-H; 1882 (34.4%) ever
received an LSIL diagnosis; and 290 (5.3%) ever had
a diagnosis of HSIL. A total of 2374 patients (43.4%)
contributed 2 or more observations to the study,
meaning that the majority of patients were censored on
all progressions and regressions. The distributions of

 changed diagnoses and person-time contributed are
shown in Figure 1. Table 3 presents average times to
progression or regression to and from each of the abnor-
mal Pap test results, along with the number of patients
who contributed time to each wait time estimate.
Table 4 shows results of the multistate model with
race as a covariate. As stated in the Methods section,
Native American (n=0), Pacific Islander (n=1), and other
(including multiracial) (n=25) patients, these categories
were dropped from the regression model because of the
very low patient counts. We tested the global hypothesis
that a model including race is more informative than an
intercept-only model using a Pearson χ2 likelihood ratio
test for nested models. This test resulted in statistical
significance (P=.004), indicating that differences in
wait times by race are not entirely due to chance.
Hazard ratios and 95% CIs are presented in Table 4
and shown in Figure 2, representing the ratio of the rate
of each transition for each race group compared with
the rate for the same transition in the white group. Of
21 hazard ratios tested for significance, the following 4
hazard ratios (95% CIs) were statistically significant:
ASC-US to LSIL for Hispanics (0.72; 95% CI,
0.54-0.96), LSIL to ASC-US for Hispanics (1.55;
95% CI, 1.04-2.31), LSIL to ASC-US for Asians
(1.91; 95% CI, 1.08-3.36), and HSIL to LSIL for
blacks (0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.96). A trend seemed to
suggest that all racial groups other than whites had a
longer rate of progression from ASC-US to LSIL, with
Hispanics having the slowest rate, and a shorter rate of
progression from LSIL to HSIL, with Hispanics having

 the fastest rate. With regard to regression, blacks had the
slowest rate of regression from HSIL to LSIL, and
Asians had the fastest rate from LSIL to ASC-US.
Figure 3 plots expected times to progression and
regression by racial group, making it possible to inter-
pret overall time from ASC-US to HSIL and vice
versa. The Hispanic group demonstrated the fastest pro-
gression (expectation, 17.6 months; 95% CI, 11.5-25.5),
as well as the fastest regression (expectation, 27.6
months; 95% CI, 21.5-35.6). The black group had the
slowest expected times for both progression (expect-
ation, 28.1 months; 95% CI, 14.6-47.2) and regression
(expectation, 49 months; 95% CI, 29.1-86.2).
In Table 5, results are presented for the assessment
of selection bias. The number of visits (1 vs ≥2) con-
tributed to the study was differentially distributed both
by race (P=.033) and by last diagnosis (P<.001).
Patients whose last diagnosis was ASC-H were much
more likely to have contributed only 1 visit. Patients
whose records lacked information on race (17.9% of
the collected sample) were also more likely to have
contributed only 1 visit than patients with other last
diagnoses (70% vs 52%-60%).
Discussion
Although racial differences in cervical cancer and
related mortality have been consistently observed, no
study, to our knowledge, has examined the variation in
progression and regression of precancerous lesions of
the uterine cervix on cervical cytology testing among
patients of different races who received consistent and
adequate follow-up care according to current ASCCP
guidelines.
The current study found that in a 10-year sample of
patients, the rates of progression and regression of pre-
cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix were not
uniform across races. We also thoroughly reviewed the
studies used to revise the 2006 ASCCP consensus
guidelines and create the 2012 guidelines for the man-
agement of abnormal cervical cancer screening test
results and cancer precursors.22-35 These studies
included comments about the demographics of the
populations studied; however, they did not evaluate
specific differences in race.
Invasive cervical carcinoma has been found to be
nearly twice as common in blacks as in whites, with
age-adjusted rates of 14.8 per 100,000 and 7.8 per

 100,000, respectively.32 Studies that have examined
racial differences in cervical cancer–related mortality
have found that an appreciable portion of the difference
can be attributed to factors related to access to health
care.36 However, because the patients in the current
study all had access to health care and adequate
follow-up, our results suggest that differences in the
incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma between
blacks and whites cannot be solely due to health care
disparities but instead may represent potential bio-
logical factors as the root of this observed variation.
A possible biological explanation is the differences
in the distribution of types and intratype variants of
HPV. Yamada et al13 examined intratype HPV-16
sequence variation in tumor samples that were collected
and analyzed in an international study of invasive cer-
vical cancer that involved 22 countries in 5 continents.
Based on E6 hybridization patterns, most of the var-
iants from European and North American samples
were phylogenetically classified as European prototype,
and samples from Africa contained primarily African 1
or African 2 variants. The majority of Asian variants
were observed in Southeast Asia, and almost all
Hispanic variants were from Central and South
America or Spain. Although this study13 did not report
direct correlations to the behavior of precancerous
lesions caused by these variants, it established a foun-
dation for the existence of HPV variations that lead to
cervical cancer and gives credence to the plausibility
that HPV and resultant precancerous lesions of the
uterine cervix may behave differently among various
ethnicities.
In addition to the type of HPV strain that leads to cer-
vical intraepithelial neoplasia, an important risk factor
for cervical cancer is coinfection with more than 1
type of HPV: an important association has been found
between the number of viral types at the site of infec-
tion and the severity of the cervical intraepithelial neo-
plasia.37

 coinfection: the authors examined cervical samples by
Pap test and DNA PCR from 1810 women with
diverse sociocultural backgrounds and showed that dif-
ferent ethnicities demonstrated higher multiple-strain
HPV coinfection rates.
Although the exact cause is not known, the lack of
uniformity in precancerous lesion behavior across dif-
ferent races/ethnicities in the current study may affect
how these groups should be respectively screened and
treated. Such differences represent an important site of
intervention and should be incorporated into screening
guidelines to maximize the benefit over the risks of
excisional procedures in the prevention of cervical
cancer once further studies solidify these differences.
Given that our results demonstrate, for example, that
blacks have the slowest expected times for both pro-
gression and regression of precancerous lesions, it may
be acceptable to choose observation or excision for per-
sistent precancerous lesions in cases in which the deci-
sion for observation vs excision is equivocal.

Expected times to (A) progression and (B) regression of precancerous cervical lesion diagnoses by racial group. The
Hispanic group demonstrated the fastest expected progression (17.6 months; 95% CI, 11.5-25.5), as well as the fastest
regression (27.6 months; 95% CI, 21.5-35.6), and the black group has the slowest expected times for both progression (28.1
months; 95% CI, 14.6-47.2) and regression (49 months; 95% CI, 29.1-86.2). Abbreviations: ASC-US, atypical squamous

 Limitations
This study had several limitations. Strengths of the
current study include a racially diverse sample with suf-
ficient power to detect relatively subtle differences
across race, which is attributable to both a fairly large
sample and extended follow-up time. Because of the
varying rate of follow-up in the study, it was plausible
that selection bias could have been responsible for the
observed associations. We assessed this possibility by
examining the associations of race and last diagnosis
with number of visits contributed to the study (1 vs
≥2). We found that the number of visits was associated
with both variables, indicating that selection bias could
have influenced the observed association.
Patients whose last diagnosis was ASC-H were much
more likely to have only 1 visit, and treatment rather than
observation is recommended in these cases. Patients
whose medical record lacked lesion transition information
were much more likely to have had only 1 visit than were
patients with other diagnoses. This factor may indicate
that patients with less information available were less
likely to be involved in care and may have represented a
higher-risk category that was therefore underrepresented
in the study. Because we considered each patient to have
person time from their first recorded Pap test result to the
end of the study, it is possible that losses to follow-up
representing higher-risk patients could have caused over-
estimates of the expected transition times that may have
been patterned by race. Therefore, our results may not be
generalizable to all patients and will need to be confirmed
in prospective studies that can make specific efforts to
reduce loss to follow-up.
The current study included all diagnoses of ASC-US,
both HPV+ and HPV−. Although ASC-US itself is not
necessarily representative of a precancerous lesion of the
cervix without concurrent HPV positivity, its addition
was favored given that ASC-US is involved in the initial
cervical cancer screening pathway designated by the
most recent ASCCP guidelines.16 The guidelines state
that ASC-US is the most common cytologic abnormality
and carries the lowest risk of CIN 3+ given that one-third
to two-thirds are not associated with HPV. Although a
low risk is associated with ASC-US, it is still involved in
the screening algorithm, HPV-associated or not, and thus
its dynamics across races is of interest and of potential
clinical utility.
Conclusion
Our study findings indicate that the dynamics of precan-
cerous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix are likely to
be patterned by race. However, for these observations
to be incorporated into clinical screening guidelines,
higher-powered, prospective studies are needed to gen-
erate reliable and biologically meaningful race-specific
estimates of progression and regression probabilities.
More studies are required to make definitive claims
about variations of these lesions among races, which
ultimately will be incorporated into screening guidelines
to ensure that women do not receive unnecessary exci-
sional procedures or inadequate treatment leading to a
diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer.
