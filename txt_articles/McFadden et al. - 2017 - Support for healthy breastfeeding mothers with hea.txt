Background
There is extensive evidence of important health risks for infants and mothers related to not breastfeeding. In 2003, the World Health
Organization recommended that infants be breastfed exclusively until six months of age, with breastfeeding continuing as an important
part of the infant’s diet until at least two years of age. However, current breastfeeding rates in many countries do not reflect this
recommendation.
Objectives
To describe forms of breastfeeding support which have been evaluated in controlled studies, the timing of the interventions and the
settings in which they have been used.
To examine the effectiveness of different modes of offering similar supportive interventions (for example, whether the support offered
was proactive or reactive, face-to-face or over the telephone), and whether interventions containing both antenatal and postnatal
elements were more effective than those taking place in the postnatal period alone.
To examine the effectiveness of different care providers and (where information was available) training.
To explore the interaction between background breastfeeding rates and effectiveness of support.
Search methods
We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register (29 February 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.
Selection criteria
Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing extra support for healthy breastfeeding mothers of healthy term babies
with usual maternity care.

 Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The
quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.
Main results
This updated review includes 100 trials involving more than 83,246 mother-infant pairs of which 73 studies contribute data (58
individually-randomised trials and 15 cluster-randomised trials). We considered that the overall risk of bias of trials included in the
review was mixed. Of the 31 new studies included in this update, 21 provided data for one or more of the primary outcomes. The total
number of mother-infant pairs in the 73 studies that contributed data to this review is 74,656 (this total was 56,451 in the previous
version of this review). The 73 studies were conducted in 29 countries. Results of the analyses continue to confirm that all forms of
extra support analyzed together showed a decrease in cessation of ’any breastfeeding’, which includes partial and exclusive breastfeeding
(average risk ratio (RR) for stopping any breastfeeding before six months 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.95; moderate-
quality evidence, 51 studies) and for stopping breastfeeding before four to six weeks (average RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; moderate-
quality evidence, 33 studies). All forms of extra support together also showed a decrease in cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at six
months (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.92; moderate-quality evidence, 46 studies) and at four to six weeks (average RR 0.79, 95%
CI 0.71 to 0.89; moderate quality, 32 studies). We downgraded evidence to moderate-quality due to very high heterogeneity.
We investigated substantial heterogeneity for all four outcomes with subgroup analyses for the following covariates: who delivered
care, type of support, timing of support, background breastfeeding rate and number of postnatal contacts. Covariates were not able to
explain heterogeneity in general. Though the interaction tests were significant for some analyses, we advise caution in the interpretation
of results for subgroups due to the heterogeneity. Extra support by both lay and professionals had a positive impact on breastfeeding
outcomes. Several factors may have also improved results for women practising exclusive breastfeeding, such as interventions delivered
with a face-to-face component, high background initiation rates of breastfeeding, lay support, and a specific schedule of four to eight
contacts. However, because within-group heterogeneity remained high for all of these analyses, we advise caution when making specific
conclusions based on subgroup results. We noted no evidence for subgroup differences for the any breastfeeding outcomes.
Authors’ conclusions
When breastfeeding support is offered to women, the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding is increased. Characteristics of effective
support include: that it is offered as standard by trained personnel during antenatal or postnatal care, that it includes ongoing scheduled
visits so that women can predict when support will be available, and that it is tailored to the setting and the needs of the population
group. Support is likely to be more effective in settings with high initiation rates. Support may be offered either by professional or lay/
peer supporters, or a combination of both. Strategies that rely mainly on face-to-face support are more likely to succeed with women
practising exclusive breastfeeding.

Support for breastfeeding mothers
What is the issue?
The World Health Organization recommends that infants should be breastfed exclusively until six months of age with breastfeeding
continuing as an important part of the infant’s diet until he or she is at least two years old. We know that breastfeeding is good for the
short-term and long-term health of both infants and their mothers. Babies are less likely to develop infections in the digestive tract,
lungs or airways, and ears. They are also less likely to become overweight and develop diabetes later in life. The mothers are less likely
to develop diabetes and to experience breast or ovarian cancer. Many mothers may stop breastfeeding before they want to as a result of
the problems they encounter. Good care and support may help women solve these problems so that they can continue to breastfeed.
Why is this important?
By knowing what kind of support can be provided to help mothers with breastfeeding, we can help them solve any problems and
continue to breastfeed for as long as they want to, wherever they live. Stopping breastfeeding early may cause disappointment and distress
for mothers and health problems for themselves and their infants. Support can be in the form of giving reassurance, praise, information,
and the opportunity for women to discuss problems and ask questions as needed. This review looked at whether providing extra
organised support for breastfeeding mothers would help mothers to continue to breastfeed when compared with standard maternity

 care. We were interested in support from health professionals including midwives, nurses and doctors, or from trained lay workers such
as community health workers and volunteers.
What evidence did we find?
We searched for evidence on 29 February 2016 and identified a further 31 new trials for inclusion in the review. This updated review
now includes 100 randomised controlled studies involving more than 83,246 women. The 73 trials that contributed to the analyses
were from 29 countries and involved 74,656 women. Some 62% of the women were from high-income countries, 34% from middle
income countries and 4% from low-income countries
All forms of extra organised support analyzed together showed an increase in the length of time women continued to breastfeed, either
with or without introducing any other types of liquids or foods. This meant that fewer women stopped any breastfeeding or exclusively
breastfeeding (moderate quality evidence) before four to six weeks and before six months. Both trained volunteers and doctors and
nurses had a positive impact on breastfeeding.
Factors that may have contributed to the success for women who exclusively breastfed were face-to-face contact (rather than contact
by telephone), volunteer support, a specific schedule of four to eight contacts and high numbers of women who began breastfeeding
in the community or population (background rates).
The term ’high-quality evidence’ means that we are confident that further studies would provide similar findings. No outcome was
assessed as being ’high-quality’. The term ’moderate-quality evidence’ means that we found wide variations in the findings with some
conflicting results in the studies in this review. New studies of different kinds of support for exclusive breastfeeding may change our
understanding of how to help women to continue with exclusive breastfeeding.
The methodological quality of the studies was mixed and the components of the standard care interventions and extra support
interventions varied a lot and were not always well described. Also, the settings for the studies and the women involved were diverse.
What does this mean?
Providing women with extra organised support helps them breastfeed their babies for longer. Breastfeeding support may be more helpful
if it is predictable, scheduled, and includes ongoing visits with trained health professionals including midwives, nurses and doctors, or
with trained volunteers. Different kinds of support may be needed in different geographical locations to meet the needs of the people
within that location. We need additional randomised controlled studies to identify what kinds of support are the most helpful for
women.

Description of the condition
Breastfeeding has a fundamental impact on the short-, medium-
and long-term health of children and has an important impact
on women’s health (Victora 2016). For children, good quality ev-
idence demonstrates that in both low-, middle- and high-income
settings not breastfeeding contributes to mortality due to infec-
tious diseases (Sankar 2015), hospitalisation for preventable dis-
ease such as gastroenteritis, and respiratory disease (Horta 2013),
otitis media (Bowatte 2015), increased rates of childhood diabetes
and obesity (Horta 2015a), and increased dental disease (Peres
2015; Tham 2015). For women, there is good quality evidence
that not breastfeeding is associated with increased risks of breast
and ovarian cancer, and diabetes (Chowdhury 2015). Lactational
amenorrhoea is associated with exclusive/predominant breastfeed-
ing and increases birth spacing when other forms of contracep-
tion are not available (Chowdhury 2015). Not being breastfed has
an adverse impact on intelligence quotient (IQ), and educational
and behavioural outcomes for the child (Heikkilä 2014; Heikkilä
2011; Horta 2015b; Quigley2012). Formanyoutcomesadose-re-
sponse relationship exists, with the greatest benefit resulting from
breastfeeding exclusively, with no added food or fluids, for around
six months, with breastfeeding continuing thereafter as an impor-
tant component of the infant’s diet (Kramer 2012). The negative
impact of not breastfeeding has been demonstrated in a range of
settings and population groups, though the balance of risks and
benefits varies from setting to setting; for example, gastroenteri-
tis will result in much higher mortality in low-income countries
(Horta 2013).
Few health behaviours have such a broad-spectrum and long-last-
ing impact on population health, with the potential to improve
life chances, health and well-being. Victora 2016 estimated that
each year, 823,000 deaths in children under five years and 20,000
deaths from breast cancer could be prevented by near universal
breastfeeding. The cost burden of not breastfeeding was estimated
by Rollins 2016 to represent 0.49% of world gross domestic prod-
uct. The cost burden includes the cost of caring for children and
women with chronic disease as well as short-term illness (Bartick
2010; Smith 2010).
The established negative impact on a population of not breastfeed-
ing has resulted in global and national support for encouraging the
initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. The World Health
Organization (WHO) recommends that, wherever possible, in-
fants should be fed exclusively on breastmilk until six months of
age (WHO 2003), with breastfeeding continuing as an important
part of the infant’s diet until at least two years of age. Other agen-
cies and countries have endorsed the recommendation to breast-
feed exclusively to around six months of age (EFSA Panel 2009;
National Center for Health Statistics 2012).
Due to the lack of standardised infant feeding indicators in high-
income countries, it is difficult to compare rates of breastfeeding
across high-income countries, or between high-income, and low-
and middle-income countries. Therefore reported rates of breast-
feeding need to be treated with caution. Victora 2016 suggest that,
in general, there is an inverse relationship between breastfeeding
rates and national wealth, though this relationship does not nec-
essarily hold at the level of population subgroups. In high-income
countries, for example, the relationship is often seen to be the op-
posite, with rates higher among more affluent women (McAndrew
2012).
Although some high-income countries such as, Norway and Fin-
land have high rates of both initiation and continuation of breast-
feeding (Cattaneo 2010), rates in many high-income countries
are low. Initiation rates have risen in some high-income coun-
tries in recent years (NHS England 2014; U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services 2011), but there remains a marked
decline in breastfeeding within the first few weeks after initiation,
and exclusive breastfeeding to six months is rare (Cattaneo 2010;
McAndrew 2012).
In middle- and low-income countries, while breastfeeding ini-
tiation and duration are generally higher than in high-income
countries, the average rate of exclusive breastfeeding for children
younger than six months is only 37% (Victora 2016). How-
ever, rates of exclusive breastfeeding for children younger than six
months vary widely; Peru and Rwanda report rates of 72% and
85% respectively (UNICEF 2012), while in Nigeria the rate is
only 17%. In some low- and middle-income countries, cultural
practices such as prelacteal feeds, and giving water or teas alongside
breastfeeding, account for the low rates of exclusive breastfeeding
(Kimani-Murage 2011). This is particularly important as when
breastfeeding continues for long periods of time, infant and young
child mortality are reduced in the second year of life in low- and
middle-income countries (Victora 2016).
Infant feeding is strongly related to inequalities in health, and, far
from being an individual decision made by each woman, is in-
fluenced most strongly by structural determinants of health. The
range of different rates of initiation and continuation of breast-
feeding in different settings globally demonstrates that the key fac-
tors influencing infant feeding rates are likely to be sociocultural
and related to societal and subgroup norms, public policy, and
the availability of appropriate care and support, both professional
and lay (EU Project on Promotion of Breastfeeding 2004; Rollins
2016). In high-income countries, for example, young mothers and
women in low-income groups, or women who ceased full-time
education at an early age, are least likely either to start breastfeed-
ing or to continue for a period of time sufficient to benefit from
the greatest health gain (McAndrew 2012). Migrant women have
been shown to adopt breastfeeding practices that are more similar
to the country in which they live, than the country of their birth
(McLachlan 2006).
The early discontinuation of breastfeeding is not a decision that
6

 is taken lightly by women; it is associated with a high prevalence
of problems such as painful breasts and nipples, concern about
adequacy of milk supply and about the baby’s behaviour, and, in
some settings, embarrassment related to breastfeeding in public.
Many mothers report distress related to the decision to discontinue
breastfeeding (McAndrew 2012), even in cultures where breast-
feeding rates are high (Almqvist-Tangen 2012). A key factor is the
widespread lack of appropriate education for health profession-
als in the prevention and treatment of breastfeeding problems,
which means that in a wide range of settings women commonly
do not receive the quality of care needed from the health services
(Cattaneo 2010; Renfrew 2006). Enkin 2000 notes that industrial
societies, on the whole, do not provide women with the oppor-
tunity to observe other breastfeeding women before they attempt
breastfeeding themselves. In such societies, where breastfeeding is
not normative behaviour and women may find it socially challeng-
ing to breastfeed, women are at particular risk of finding a serious
lack of support to continue breastfeeding.
Description of the intervention
‘Support’ is complex and can include several elements such as emo-
tional and esteem-building support (including reassurance and
praise), practical help, informational support (including the op-
portunity to discuss and respond to women’s questions) and so-
cial support (including signposting women to support groups and
networks) (Dykes 2006; Schmied 2011). It can be offered in a
range of ways, by health professionals or lay people, trained or un-
trained, in hospital and community settings. It can be offered to
groups of women or one-to-one, it can involve mother-to-mother
support, and it can include family members (typically fathers or
grandmothers) and wider communities. Support can be offered
proactively by contacting women directly, or reactively, by waiting
for women to get in touch. It can be provided face-to-face, by
telephone or through social media. It can involve only one contact
or regular, ongoing contact over several months.
Support is a complex intervention that tackles the multifaceted
challenge of enabling women to breastfeed, and it should not be
surprising that it varies from setting to setting and from study
to study. However, it is likely that different forms of support
in different contexts will be differentially effective. The global
Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (Baby Friendly Initiative in some
countries), which is a complex intervention incorporating 10 steps
to successful breastfeeding, has been shown to be associated with
increasedbreastfeedingrates(Labbok 2012; Pérez-Escamilla2016;
Venancio 2011). Over 21,000 facilities in 198 countries have
ever been accredited, representing 27.5% of maternities world-
wide (Labbok 2012), but most babies are still not born in a Baby
Friendly environment.
In many settings, the health professionals who provide standard
maternity care lack in-depth knowledge of the prevention and
treatment of breastfeeding problems. Therefore training and edu-
cation of health professionals and others who provide breastfeed-
ing support is critical. To address this, WHO and UNICEF (the
United Nations Children’s Fund) have developed two breastfeed-
ing training programmes: the 40-hour Breastfeeding Counselling,
and the five-day Infant and Young Child Feeding Counselling,
to train a cadre of health workers that can provide skilled sup-
port to breastfeeding mothers and help them overcome problems
(WHO/UNICEF 1993; WHO/UNICEF 2006).
How the intervention might work
Support for breastfeeding women can work in different ways for
different women. Timely, skilled support will help women to avoid
or overcome breastfeeding problems that may lead to cessation
of breastfeeding. In settings where breastfeeding is not the social
norm, support can increase women’s belief in breastfeeding, and
give them confidence to continue breastfeeding in the face of so-
cietal and family pressures that might undermine breastfeeding.
In settings where exclusive breastfeeding is rare, support can dis-
pel myths about the need for additional foods or fluids alongside
breastfeeding to meet babies’ nutritional needs.
Why it is important to do this review
It is fundamentally important to examine the support that moth-
ers receive when breastfeeding to determine what might be effec-
tive in helping women continue to breastfeed, whatever setting
they live in. There is evidence that effective breastfeeding support
interventions are cost-effective and likely to realise a return on in-
vestment within a few years (Renfrew 2012a).
The purpose of this review is to examine interventions which pro-
vide extra support for mothers who are breastfeeding or consid-
ering breastfeeding; and to assess their impact on breastfeeding
duration and exclusivity and, where recorded, on health outcomes
and maternal satisfaction. This review is an update of the pre-
viously published version Renfrew 2012b. The focus of this re-
view is support for mothers and babies who are part of the gen-
eral healthy population of their countries; mothers of premature
and sick babies and mothers with some medical conditions have
additional issues with breastfeeding, and interventions to support
these mothers need to be reviewed separately. A Cochrane Review
of breastfeeding education and support for mothers with multiple
pregnancies is in progress (Whitford 2015). Whilst many support
interventions include breastfeeding education for mothers, our re-
view excludes interventions described as solely educational in na-
ture and interventions with no postnatal component. A Cochrane
Review of antenatal breastfeeding education for increasing breast-
feeding duration has been published (Lumbiganon 2012).
Specific objectives of this review are to describe forms of support
which have been evaluated in controlled studies, and the settings
in which they have been used. It was also of interest to examine
7

 the effectiveness of different modes of offering similar support-
ive interventions (for example, face-to-face or over the telephone),
whether interventions containing both antenatal and postnatal el-
ements were more effective than those taking place in the postnatal
period alone, and whether the support was offered proactively to
women, or whether they needed to seek it out. We also planned to
examine the effectiveness of different care providers, and the pos-
sible impact of background breastfeeding rates in the countries or
areas where the trials took place on the effectiveness of supportive
interventions. It is important to note that the support interven-
tions offered were in addition to standard care, which varied from
setting to setting, though there are few settings in which standard
care is consistently offered by people with training and skill in
enabling women to breastfeed.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, with or
without blinding. Cluster-randomised controlled trials were also
eligible for inclusion.
Types of participants
Participants were healthy pregnant women considering or intend-
ingtobreastfeedorhealthywomenwhowere breastfeedinghealthy
babies.Healthy women and babies were considered those who did
not require additional medical care (e.g. women with diabetes,
women with HIV/AIDs, overweight or obese women) or surgi-
cal care (e.g. women who required a Caesarean Section). Studies
which focused specifically on women with additional care needs
were excluded.
Types of interventions
Contact with an individual or individuals (either professional or
volunteer) offering support which is supplementary to the stan-
dard care offered in that setting. ‘Support’ interventions eligible
for this review could include elements such as reassurance, praise,
information, and the opportunity to discuss and to respond to the
mother’s questions, and could also include staff training to im-
prove the supportive care given to women. It could be offered by
health professionals or lay people, trained or untrained, in hospital
and community settings. It could be offered to groups of women
or one-to-one, including mother-to-mother support, and it could
be offered proactively by contacting women directly, or reactively,
by waiting for women to get in touch. It could be provided face-
to-face or over the phone, and it could involve only one contact
or regular, ongoing contact over several months. Studies were in-
cluded if the intervention occurred in the postnatal period alone or
also included an antenatal component. Interventions taking place
in the antenatal period alone were excluded from this review, as
were interventions described as solely educational in nature.
Types of outcome measures
The main outcome measure was the effect of the interventions
on stopping breastfeeding by specified points in time. Primary
outcomes were recorded for stopping any or exclusive breastfeed-
ing before four to six weeks and before six months postpartum.
Other outcomes of interest in previous versions of this review were
stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding at other time points (two,
three, four, nine and 12 months), measures of neonatal and in-
fant morbidity (where available) and measures of maternal satis-
faction with care or feeding method. Secondary outcomes were
not considered in this update so that the review could be com-
pleted in time to inform the World Health Organisation’s review
of the evidence and update of the WHO recommendations on
breastfeeding in maternity facilities. A new set of core outcomes
for Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth breastfeeding reviews is
currently being developed and the outcomes from this core set
may influence future outcomes chosen for this review.
Primary outcomes
1. Stopping breastfeeding before six months postpartum.
2. Stopping exclusive breastfeeding before six months
postpartum.
3. Stopping any breastfeeding before four to six weeks
postpartum.

Search methods for identification of studies
The following methods section of this review is based on a standard
template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth.
Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials
Register by contacting their Information Specialist (29 February
2016).
The Register is a database containing over 22,000 reports of con-
trolledtrialsinthe fieldof pregnancyandchildbirth.Forfull search
methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Regis-
ter including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MED-
LINE, Embase and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals
and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via
the current awareness service, please follow this link to the edi-
torial information about Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth in
the Cochrane Library and select the ‘Specialized Register ’ section
from the options on the left side of the screen.
Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth’s Trials Register is
maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials
identified from:
1. monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
2. weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);
3. weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);
4. monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);
5. handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major
conferences;
6. weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals,
plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.
Search results are screened independently by two people and the
full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching
activities described above is reviewed. Based on the intervention
described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds
to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and
is then added to the Register. The Information Specialist searches
the Register for each review using this topic number rather than
keywords. This results in a more specific search set, which has
been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included
studies; Excluded studies; Studies awaiting classification; Ongoing
studies).

review, please see: Britton 2007; Renfrew 1995; Renfrew 2012b;

Searching other resources
We searched the reference lists of retrieved studies.
We did not apply any language or date restrictions.
Data collection and analysis
Formethodsusedinthe previousversionof thisreview, seeRenfrew
2012b.
For this update, the following methods (based on a standard tem-
plate used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth) were used for
assessing the 162 reports that were identified as a result of the up-
dated search.
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently assessed all the potential stud-
ies identified as a result of the search strategy for inclusion. We re-
solved any disagreement through discussion and consulted a third
review author if required.
Data extraction and management
We designed and piloted a form to extract data. For eligible studies,
two review authors extracted information using the agreed form.
We resolved discrepancies through discussion. Data were entered
into Review Manager 5 software (RevMan 2014), and checked for
accuracy.
When information regarding study methods and results was un-
clear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to
provide further details.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each
study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (the Handbook) (Higgins 2011).
Any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a
third assessor.
(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible
selection bias)
For each included study, we described the method used to generate
the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment
of whether it should produce comparable groups.
We assessed the method as:
1. low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random
number table; computer random number generator);
2. high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even
date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);
3. unclear risk of bias.

 (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection
bias)
For each included study, we described the method used to con-
ceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed
whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in ad-
vance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.
We assessed the methods as:
1. low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation;
consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);
2. high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-
opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);
3. unclear risk of bias.
(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for
possible performance bias)
For each included study, we described the method used, if any, to
blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which
intervention a participant received. We considered that studies
were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that
the lack of blinding unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding
separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed the methods as:
1. low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;
2. low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.
(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible
detection bias)
For each included study, we described the method used, if any, to
blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a
participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different
outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:
1. low, high or unclear risk of bias.
(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition
bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete
outcome data)
For each included study, and for each outcome or class of out-
comes, we described the completeness of data including attrition
and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and
exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis
at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants),
reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether
missing data were balanced across groups or were related to out-
comes. Where sufficient information was reported, or could be
supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing
data in the analyses that we undertook.
We assessed methods as:
1. low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing
outcome data balanced across groups);
2. high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data
imbalanced across groups; ‘as treated’ analysis done with
substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned
at randomisation);
3. unclear risk of bias.
(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)
For each included study, we described how we investigated the
possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.
We assessed the methods as:
1. low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study’s
prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to
the review have been reported);
2. high risk of bias (where not all the study’s prespecified
outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary
outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are
reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to
include results of a key outcome that would have been expected
to have been reported);
3. unclear risk of bias.
(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not
covered by (1) to (5) above)
We described for each included study any important concerns we
had about other possible sources of bias.
(7) Overall risk of bias
We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high
risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (
Higgins 2011).
Overall findings for our assessment of risk of bias in the included
studies are set out in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

 Assessment of the quality of the evidence using the
GRADE approach
For this update the quality of the evidence was assessed using
the GRADE approach as outlined in the GRADE handbook in
order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to
the following primary outcomes for the comparison, All forms of
support versus usual care.
1. Stopping breastfeeding before six months postpartum.
2. Stopping exclusive breastfeeding before six months
postpartum.
3. Stopping any breastfeeding before four to six weeks
postpartum.
4. Stopping exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks
postpartum.
The GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool was used to import
data from Review Manager 5.3 in order to create ’Summary of
findings’ tables (RevMan 2014). A summary of the intervention
effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was
produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach
uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect,
imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality
of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be
downgraded from ’high quality’ by one level for serious (or by
two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments
for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency,
imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.
Measures of treatment effect
Dichotomous data
For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratios
with 95% confidence intervals.
Continuous data
There are no continuous data in this review.
Unit of analysis issues
Cluster-randomised trials
There are 15 cluster-randomised trials in the analyses. Their sam-
ple sizes have been adjusted using the methods described in the
Handbook and by Donner 2000 incorporating an estimate of the
intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) derived from the trial (if
possible). Where cluster adjusted confidence limits were presented
but not the ICC, the design effect was estimated from comparison
with limits based on the raw numbers. However, for Ochola 2013,
outcome one of Elliott-Rudder 2014, arm two of Yotebieng 2015,
adjusting for clustering based on the summary statistic made the
standard error larger and the width of the confidence interval in-
creased which resulted in a design of <1. Therefore, the adjustment
for clustering resulted in an increase of the error sum of squares
for the raw numbers given. As this was nonsensical, no adjustment
for clustering was made for these studies. We have synthesised the
findings from individually- and cluster-randomised trials provided
that there was little heterogeneity between the study designs and
the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice
of randomisation unit was considered to be unlikely. We have car-
ried out sensitivity analyses to investigate the effect of including
cluster-randomised trials where no adjustment was possible. For
all trials where ICCs were not reported, study authors will be con-
tacted in the next version of the review.
Trials with multiple groups
In order to avoid ’double counting’ in studies involving one control
group and two different interventions groups, we split the control
group number of events and participants in half, so that we could
include two independent comparisons, as per methods described
the Handbook [section16.5.4].
Dealing with missing data
For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on
an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all partici-
pants randomised to each group in the analyses. The denominator
for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus
any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.
For included studies, we have noted levels of attrition. We have
not included outcomes in the analyses where more than 25% of
the data were missing.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using
the Tau², I² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as sub-
stantial if I² was greater than 30% and either Tau² was greater than
zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test
for heterogeneity. If we identified substantial heterogeneity (above
30%), we planned to explore it by prespecified subgroup analysis.
Assessment of reporting biases
For all outcomes we have ordered studies in terms of weight, where
a sufficient number of studies contributed data, we have generated
13

 funnel plots. We examined plots visually to see whether there was
any evidence of asymmetry that might suggest different treatment
effects in smaller studies, which may indicate publication bias (
Harbord 2006). We note however, that there are many other rea-
sons for asymmetry in Funnel Plots such as heterogeneity.
Data synthesis
We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager 5 soft-
ware (RevMan 2014). At the outset, we had anticipated that there
would be some heterogeneity between studies in terms of the in-
terventions and the populations studied, we therefore decided to
use random-effects meta-analysis for combining data. Random-
effects meta-analysis estimates the average treatment effect, and
this may not always be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, where
there is high heterogeneity the applicability of the overall effect
estimate is likely to vary in different settings and we therefore ad-
vise caution in the interpretation of results. The random-effects
summary was treated as the average of the range of possible treat-
ment effects and we discuss the clinical implications of treatment
effects differing between trials. If the average treatment effect was
not clinically meaningful, we planned not to combine trials. Since
we used random-effects analyses, the results were presented as the
average treatment effect with 95% confidence intervals, and the
estimates of Tau² and I².
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
If we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated it using
subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. We considered whether
anoverall summarywasmeaningful, andifitwas, we usedrandom-
effects analysis to produce it.
We carried out the following subgroup analyses for the four pri-
mary outcomes.
1. By type of supporter (professional versus lay person, or
both).
2. By type of support (face-to-face versus telephone support).
3. By timing of support (antenatal and postnatal versus
postnatal alone).
4. By whether the support was proactive (scheduled contacts)
or reactive (women needed to request support).
5. By background breastfeeding initiation rates (low, medium
or high background rates).
6. By intensity of support (number of scheduled contacts).
Sensitivity analysis
We have carried out sensitivity analysis for primary outcomes by
study quality; we did this by dividing the studies into subgroups
according to whether they were at low risk of bias as opposed to
unclear or high risk of bias. We have performed this for allocation
concealment. Because we have excluded studies from any analy-
ses if they had more than 25% attrition, we have not conducted
sensitivity analyses for this item.

Description of studies
Results of the search
In this updated version, we assessed 162 reports and have subse-
quently included a further 31 studies. We excluded 68 studies and
have assigned the remainder as either an additional report of an-
other study in the review, a study awaiting classification or an on-
going study (see Studies awaiting classification and Characteristics
of ongoing studies). This review now therefore includes 100 stud-
ies and has excluded 147 studies.
This updated review is only focused on two primary outcomes
each at two different time points. Of the 31 new studies included
in this update, 21 studies provided data for one or more of the
primary outcomes (see Table 1). Ten new trials met the inclusion
criteria for this review but were excluded from the analyses either
because they did not present data in a useable form or because of
attrition rates >25%. Eleven studies provided data for outcome
1.1; 13 studies for outcome 1.2; eight studies for outcome 1.3;
and eight studies for outcome 1.4. The addition of these studies
to the studies included in the previous version of the review meant
that for this 2016 update a total of 51 studies contributed data for
outcome 1.1; 46 studies for outcome 1.2; 33 studies for outcome
1.3; and 32 studies for outcome 1.4.
In the results section we will not discuss further those studies that
did not contribute data to the review, but additional information
about these trials is provided in the Characteristics of included
studies table and further details about the eleven new trials from
the update is also provided in Table 1.
Included studies
This updated review includes 100 trials involving more than
83,246 mother-infant pairs of which 73 studies contribute data
(58 individually-randomised trials and 15 cluster-randomised tri-
als).
Description of included studies (n = 73)
Seventy-three of the 100 included studies contribute data to this
2016 update of the review. It should be noted that two of the
included trials were obtained via a single publication (Bonuck
2014a); one trial is called the BINGO trial and the other called
the PAIRING trial. In order to differentiate between these two

 trials in this review the BINGO trial is identified via the reference
(Bonuck 2014a) and the PAIRING trial via the reference (Bonuck
2014b).
The total number of mother-infant pairs in these studies is 74,656
(this total was 56,451 in the previous version of this review
(Renfrew 2012b). The 73 studies were published/conducted be-
tween 1979 and 2016 and show increases over time both in num-
ber of studies (five studies are dated before 1990, 10 between 1990
and 1999, 40 between 2000 and 2011, and 18 are dated between
2012 and 2016), and range of country settings (the seven studies
with dates before 1994 were all undertaken in high-income coun-
tries,andthe eightstudiesfromlow-/low-middle income countries
were publishedin2000orlater).The datainthisreview come from
participants living in 29 countries. Using the World Bank classifi-
cation of countries by income (http://data.worldbank.org/about/
country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups, accessed 30
June 2016):
• four studies with 3260 participants (4.4% of the total
number of participants) were conducted in low-income countries
(Bangladesh, Haider 2000; Burkina Faso and Uganda, Tylleskar
2011a and Tylleskar 2011b; and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Yotebieng 2015);
• four studies with 2534 participants (3.4%) were conducted
in low-middle income countries (India, Bhandari 2003; Kenya,
Ochola 2013; Pakistan, Sikander 2015; and Syria, Bashour
2008);
• 15 studies with 22,477 participants (30.1%) were
conducted in upper-middle income countries (Belarus, Kramer

1 Note: The Tylleskar study, Tylleskar 2011a, Tylleskar 2011b,
and Tylleskar 2011c, was undertaken in three countries, two are in
the low-income and one in the upper-middle income World Bank
category. In this review, we have entered data into the analyses
separately for each country.
Methods used in trials
The 73 studies include 58 individually-randomised trials and 15
cluster-randomised trials (Bhandari 2003; Ekstrom 2006; Elliott-
Rudder 2014; Fu 2014; Haider 2000; Hoddinott 2009; Kools
2005; Kramer 2001; Kronborg 2007; McLachlan 2016; Morrow
1999; Ochola 2013; Sikander 2015; Tylleskar 2011a; Tylleskar
2011b; Tylleskar 2011c; Yotebieng 2015).
Participants and setting
Socioeconomic and health status
Participants were women from the general healthy population of
their countries. However, 28 of the 73 studies were undertaken
with women from low-income groups within their country. These
28 studies include 16 of the 20 USA studies, with four other
studies from high-income countries (Jones 1985; Mejdoubi 2014;
Quinlivan 2003; Wen 2011), three of the studies from Brazil
(Barros 1994; Coutinho 2005; Vitolo 2005), three of the studies
from low-middle income countries (Ochola 2013; Sikander 2015;
Yotebieng 2015), and the two studies from low-income coun-
tries. In one of these (Haider 2000, Bangladesh), participants were
mainly of lower-middle and low socioeconomic status. In the other
(Tylleskar 2011a; Tylleskar 2011b; Tylleskar 2011c), participants
came from three countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with those in
one country (Uganda) from low-income groups within that coun-
try. With regard to health of the general population of countries,
Tylleskar 2011a; Tylleskar 2011b; Tylleskar 2011c reported local
HIV prevalence rates of 10% to 34% in the South Africa study
sites; during recruitment, women who had not been HIV tested
were encouraged to visit the antenatal clinic, and those who had
HIV-positive status were recruited into another study.
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation/’ever breastfed’
Among the 73 studies, World Bank country income group shows
an inverse relationship with background rates of breastfeeding ini-
tiation (’ever breastfed’). All the studies with intermediate (60% to
< 80%, n = 18) or low (< 60%, n = 11) background rates of breast-
feedinginitiationwere undertakeninhigh-income countries. Nine
of the 11 studies with low background rates recruited women from
low-income groups in the USA (Brent 1995; Bonuck 2005; Bunik
2010; Chapman 2004; Di Meglio 2010; Frank 1987; Grossman
1990; Pugh 2002; Serafino-Cross 1992); the remaining two (UK)
studies were from areas of Scotland with lower breastfeeding initi-
ation rates than the Scottish average (Hoddinott 2009; Muirhead
15
Support for healthy breastfeeding mothers with healthy term babies (Review)

 2006). All the country income groups are represented among the
24 studies with high (≥ 80%) rates, however the seven studies
from low-/low-middle income countries all had high rates. Where
background rates of ’ever breastfed’ were not reported, we have
used either rates published in the WHO Global Data Bank on In-
fantandYoungChildFeeding(www.who.int/nutrition/databases/
infantfeeding/countries/en/index; accessed July 2016), or those
published in the supplementary material to Victora 2016, and for
the two studies from Scotland (Hoddinott 2009; Muirhead 2006),
we used www.isdscotlandarchive.scot.nhs.uk/isd/1914 (accessed
November 2016). For one study that was conducted in China (Wu
2014), data were not presented in the paper or available in the
WHO Global Data Bank on Infant and Young Child Feeding and
so were therefore excluded from the sensitivity analysis.
Interventions
Level of the intervention
In64/73studies,womenreceivedthe intervention. In eightstudies
the intervention was additional training in breastfeeding support
for staff (five cluster-randomised trials; Bhandari 2003; Ekstrom
2006; Elliott-Rudder 2014; Kramer 2001; Yotebieng 2015; and
three individually-randomised trials; Labarere 2005; Santiago
2003; ISRCTN47056748). One cluster-randomised trial eval-
uated a policy for providing breastfeeding groups (Hoddinott
2009).
Breastfeeding support: proactive/indirect
In 58 of the 64 studies where women received the intervention and
seven of the eight studies of staff training, breastfeeding support
was delivered directly to women. However, in two of these stud-
ies although the support was offered proactively initially, it was
up to the women to request follow-up support (Bonuck 2014a;
Laliberte 2016). In five other studies (Graffy 2004; Hoddinott
2009; Labarere 2005; Morrell 2000; Winterburn 2003), breast-
feeding support was not offered proactively; women were encour-
aged to access it, but breastfeeding support was not delivered di-
rectly to women as part of these interventions. One study evalu-
ated a multi-faceted intervention, of which breastfeeding support
delivered directly to women was one component (Kools 2005).
For two studies it was not clear if the support was offered proac-
tively or not (Edwards 2013; Vidas 2011).
One-to-one/group support
In 57 of the 73 studies there was individual, one-to-one contact
between the breastfeeding supporter and the breastfeeding mother.
Two studies offered group support (Hoddinott 2009; Vidas 2011),
one offered both individual and group support (Ekstrom 2006),
one study offered support to couples (Abbass-Dick 2015), and
in two studies this aspect of support was unclear (Kools 2005;
Kramer 2001).
Breastfeeding support from professional/lay supporters
In the previous version of this review, the people providing breast-
feeding support were categorised as ’professional’, ’lay and profes-
sional’ or ’lay’. Using those categories, the 73 studies in this up-
date comprise 49 studies of professional support, nine of lay and
professional support and 15 of lay support. In view of the grow-
ing body of work evaluating breastfeeding peer support, we have
distinguished between this and other kinds of lay support, fol-
lowing the definition by Dennis 2002: “Peer support is provided
by lay individuals who are not part of the client’s own embedded
network, who possess experiential knowledge of the targeted be-
haviour (i.e. successful breastfeeding skills) and similar qualities
(i.e. age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, residency etc.) in order
to aid the client during a time of actual or potential stress (i.e. the
initiation and continuation of breastfeeding).“
Professional
In 49 of the 73 studies a variety of medical, nursing and al-
lied professionals (for example, nutritionists, lactation consultants
and researchers) provided the breastfeeding support (Abbass-Dick
2015; Albernaz 2003; Bashour 2008; Barros 1994 Bonuck 2005;
Bonuck 2014a; Bonuck 2014b; Bortolini 2012; Brent 1995;
Bunik 2010; de Oliveira 2006; Di Napoli 2004; Ekstrom 2006;
Elliott-Rudder 2014; Frank 1987; Froozani 1999; Fu 2014;
Gagnon 2002; Grossman 1990; Howell 2014; Jones 1985;
Kramer 2001; Kronborg 2007; Laliberte 2016; Lynch 1986;
McLachlan 2016; McDonald 2010; McQueen 2009; McQueen
2011; Mejdoubi 2014; Paul 2012; Petrova 2009; Porteous 2000;

2013; Vidas2011; Vitolo2005; Wen2011; Wilhelm2015; Wrenn
1997; Wu 2014; Yotebieng 2015).
Professional and lay
Professionals provided breastfeeding support with other people
in a further nine studies; para-professionals (Kools 2005; Morrell
2000), peer supporters (Bhandari 2003; Hopkinson 2009; Pugh
2002; Pugh 2010), andlaypeople (employeeswhohadtobe moth-
ers in Barros 1994; someone chosen by the mother in Winterburn
2003; and a group of mothers in Hoddinott 2009).
Lay
16
Support for healthy breastfeeding mothers with healthy term babies (Review)

 Lay people provided breastfeeding support in 17 studies. In twelve
of these, the lay people were peer supporters (Chapman 2004;
Dennis 2002; Di Meglio 2010; Edwards 2013; Haider 2000; Leite
2005; Morrow 1999; Muirhead 2006; Ochola 2013; Tylleskar
2011a; Tylleskar 2011b; Tylleskar 2011c). The other five studies
did not report that the lay supporters met the Dennis 2002 criteria
for us to classify them as peer supporters (Aksu 2011; Coutinho
2005; Graffy 2004; Jenner 1988; Mongeon 1995).
Training in breastfeeding support
Overall, 50 of the 73 studies reported that the people providing
breastfeeding support had additional training to provide breast-
feeding support (33/49 professional, 3/9 professional and lay, and
14/15 peer/lay). In 10 studies the professionals were International
Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLC) (Bonuck 2014a;
Bonuck 2014b; Bortolini 2012; Brent 1995; Fu 2014; Laliberte
2016; Petrova 2009; Pugh 1998; Tahir 2013; Yotebieng 2015).
In one of the studies of support from professionals and paraprofes-
sionals, the professionals were lactation consultants (Kools 2005),
and in the other they were midwives not stated to have had extra
training in breastfeeding support (Morrell 2000); in both these
studies the para-professionals were trained to refer women with
breastfeeding problems to the professionals. Two of the four stud-
ies of support from professionals and peers reported training; in
Bhandari 2003 peer supporters received WHO-based training,
and in Hopkinson 2009 the professionals were IBCLCs and the
peer supporters had three days’ training in lactation management,
20 hours’ training in peer counselling and at least one year’s work
experience. One of the three studies study of professional and lay
support stated that lay supporters received breastfeeding support
training (Barros 1994).
All 10 studies of peer support (alone) reported that peer support-
ers were trained. The training was WHO 20 hours (Leite 2005),
40 hours (Haider 2000; Ochola 2013) or one week (Tylleskar
2011a; Tylleskar 2011b; Tylleskar 2011c); La Leche League (LLL)
30 hours (Chapman 2004), 20 hours (Di Meglio 2010); over 30
weeks (Edwards 2013), or not specified (Morrow 1999). Two stud-
ies reported the length but not the type of training; 2.5 hours
and more than two days (Dennis 2002; Muirhead 2006, respec-
tively). Three of the five studies of lay support (alone) reported
breastfeeding training; WHO 18 hours plus five days (Coutinho
2005), WHO 18 hours (Aksu 2011), and National Childbirth
Trust training (Graffy 2004).
Mode of support (face-to-face or by telephone, or both)
Forty-seven of the 73 studies offered telephone support and all
but two of these were undertaken in countries classified as high-
income countries by the World Bank (Albernaz 2003, Brazil; Wu
2014, China). Four studies offered breastfeeding support only by
telephone (Bunik 2010; Dennis 2002; Di Meglio 2010; Fu 2014).
Thirty offered both face-to-face and telephone support, with tele-
phone support either predominating (e.g. Muirhead 2006; Petrova
2009), or as backup (e.g. Chapman 2004). In some studies (e.g.
Kools 2005; Pugh 1998), telephone contact with the breastfeed-
ing support specialist came after the women had been visited by
someone else. Across the 27 studies examining telephone support,
details about whether or not the telephone support was proac-
tively offered by the peer or professional supporter were not re-
ported consistently. Thirty-eight studies offered only face-to-face
support. In the one remaining study (Winterburn 2003), the sup-
port was not proactive and the mode of support was not specified.
Support with an antenatal component and intention to
breastfeed
The outcomes of interventions intended to promote longer du-
ration of breastfeeding could be expected to differ according to
whether women were recruited before or after they started to
breastfeed. Two-thirds of the studies (49/73) included postnatal
women at or after initiation of breastfeeding. In the one study
of breastfeeding in groups (Hoddinott 2009), pregnant women
and breastfeeding mothers could be invited to attend groups. The
remaining 24 studies recruited women before the birth, not all
of whom went on to initiate breastfeeding. Six of the 24 stud-
ies included only women who intended to breastfeed (Kramer

Serafino-Cross 1992 in the USA; Mongeon 1995 in Canada;
Tylleskar 2011a; Tylleskar 2011b; Tylleskar 2011c in Burkina
Faso, Uganda and South Africa). In the Tylleskar 2011 study, this
inclusion criterion was related to HIV/AIDS prevention and man-
agement in the country and study populations. The other studies
that recruited before the birth did not specify that participants had
to intend to breastfeed.
Intensity of the intervention
Sixty of the 73 studies reported the intensity of the intervention
in terms of the number of postnatal contacts the mother could
have for breastfeeding support. Twenty-four studies specified three
or fewer contacts, 21 specified four to eight contacts, and the
remaining 17 studies specified nine or more contacts. We have
performed a subgroup analysis and the results are described in the
text.
Control group care
Seven of the 73 studies were undertaken in hospital settings
with Baby Friendly accreditation (Aksu 2011; Chapman 2004;
Coutinho 2005; de Oliveira 2006; ISRCTN47056748; Tahir
2013; Yotebieng 2015). However, in the study by Yotebieng 2015,
the intervention was the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI)
so the control group did not access this. For the other six studies
17

 undertaken in settings with Baby Friendly accreditation, study in-
terventions were additional to care that met Baby Friendly stan-
dards and were received by everyone at the hospital including
all the study participants in the intervention and control groups.
In two community-based cluster-randomised trials (Hoddinott
2009; Kronborg 2007), most of the maternity hospitals in which
the participants had given birth had Baby Friendly accreditation.
In 29 studies control group care was not specified (n = 9) or stated
to be standard care but not described (n = 20). In the remaining
studies there was some description of control group care (see
Characteristics of included studies). Standard postnatal care varies
both between and within countries. Care may have differed within
the study period and may also have differed from that which is
offered at the present time.
Outcomes
Level of data collection
In 66 of the 73 studies outcome data were collected from the
women who had received the intervention. In the other seven stud-
ies, the relationship between the recipients of the intervention and
the source of the outcome data varied. In the three individually-
randomised trials of staff training (ISRCTN47056748; Labarere
2005; Santiago 2003), outcome datacame fromall the womenran-
domised to receive, or not to receive, a support intervention from
trained staff. In one of the three cluster-randomised trials of staff
training (Ekstrom 2006), data came from mothers of singleton
term healthy infants at centres where staff had been randomised, or
not randomised, to receive training. In another (Bhandari 2003),
trained staff visited all families in the intervention villages and out-
come data were collected from all infants in the intervention and
control villages, and in the third (Kramer 2001), staff in all inter-
vention sites were trained and data were collected from mothers
who intended to breastfeed in the intervention and control sites. In
the cluster-randomised trial that evaluated a policy for providing
breastfeeding groups (Hoddinott 2009), the policy intervention
was made at locality level. Pregnant or postnatal women could
be invited to groups in intervention clusters; however, only 1310
pregnant or breastfeeding women out of more than 9000 births
in the intervention localities attended any group.
Duration of any and/or exclusive breastfeeding
Breastfeedingdurationwasmostcommonlyassessedatsixmonths.
A total of 51 studies measured any breastfeeding at six months and
46 studies measured exclusive breastfeeding at six months. For the
other primary outcomes, 33 studies measured any breastfeeding at
four to six weeks and 32 measured exclusive breastfeeding at four
to six weeks. When data on both seven-day and 24-hour recall
were provided, we selected the data for 24-hour recall.
The breastfeeding outcomes reported reflect World Bank country
income group of the countries in which the 73 studies were un-
dertaken. Most studies (29/52) reported the effect of the interven-
tion on rates of both any and exclusive breastfeeding. Some studies
report details about data collection that make it clear that dura-
tion of exclusive breastfeeding at specific time points was not nec-
essarily measured from birth (Tylleskar 2011a; Tylleskar 2011b;
Tylleskar 2011c; Vitolo 2005); most studies did not report this
level of detail.
Secondary outcomes
Details of secondary outcomes were not collected for this update
but will be included in the next update in two years time.
In the previous version of this review (Renfrew 2012b), a few stud-
ies reported various infant morbidity and maternal satisfaction
with feedingandcare outcomesbyinterventiongroup: infant mor-
bidity was reported in 11 studies (Bashour 2008; Bhandari 2003;
Bunik 2010; Frank 1987; Froozani 1999; Kramer 2001; Morrow
1999; Petrova2009; Pugh 2002; Quinlivan2003; Tylleskar2011a;
Tylleskar2011b; Tylleskar2011c); maternal satisfaction with feed-
ing in 11 studies (Bashour 2008; de Oliveira 2006; Dennis 2002;
Hoddinott 2009; Hopkinson 2009; Kronborg 2007; Labarere
2005; McDonald 2010; McQueen 2011; Petrova 2009; Pugh
1998), and maternal satisfaction with care in six studies (Bashour
2008; Ekstrom 2006; Graffy 2004; Jones 1985; Kools 2005;
Morrow 1999).
Excluded studies
The previous version of this review excluded 79 studies from the
review and we have excluded a further 68 studies. Thus 147 studies
have been excluded with reasons (see Characteristics of excluded
studies). The main reason for exclusion was because studies were
not randomised trials, or it was not clear that allocation to groups
had been carried out randomly; we excluded 18 studies identified
by the search for this reason (Caulfield 1998; Davies-Adetugbo
1996; Ebbeling 2007; Garcia-Montrone 1996; Hall 2007; Jang
2008; Kistin 1994; McInnes 2000; Moreno-Manzanares 1997;
Neyzi 1991; Nor 2009; Pascali-Bonaro 2004; Perez-Escamilla
1992; Segura-Millan1994; Sisk2006; Susin 2008; Thussanasupap
2006; Valdes 2000). A further two papers were reviews rather
than reports of a randomised controlled trials (Guise 2003; Lewin
2005).
We excluded 72 trials because the intervention was not rele-
vant to this review. We excluded 42 trials on the grounds that
studies examined educational interventions where the focus was
on instruction rather than on support to women to encourage
breastfeeding (Ahmed 2016; Beiler 2011; Benitez 1992; Bolam
1998; Cattaneo 2001; Christie 2011; Edwards 2013a; Ehrlich
2014; Finch 2015; Flax 2014; Forster 2004; Giglia 2015; Girish

Wan 2011; Westphal 1995; Williams 2014). We excluded a fur-
ther 13 trials as the intervention was not designed to support con-
tinued breastfeeding; these studies examined more general inter-
ventions in the postnatal period (Ball 2011; Barlow 2006; Barnet
2002; Black 2001; Gagnon 1997; MacArthur 2002; Peterson
2002; Pollard 2011; Ratner 1999; Rush 1991; Serrano 2010;
Thomson 2009; Wiggins 2005); a further trial by Baqui 2008
focused on breastfeeding initiation only, rather than on postnatal
support to encourage continuation. Eleven of the studies exam-
ined interventions carried out in the antenatal period only, and
had no postnatal support component (Forster 2006; Jahan 2014;
Johnston 2001; Katepa-Bwalya 2011; Kronborg 2012; MacArthur
2009; Olenick2011; Otsuka 2012; Noel-Weiss 2006; Reeve 2004;
Wockel 2009).
We excluded 25 of the studies that we assessed for inclusion as
they did not focus on healthy mothers with healthy, term infants.
Five trials examined interventions for low birthweight babies (
Agrasada 2005; Brown 2008; Junior 2007; Pinelli 2001; Thakur
2012), while the Ahmed 2008 study recruited only mothers of
premature babies. The Davies-Adetugbo 1997 and Haider 1996
studies recruited the mothers of babies with severe diarrhoea, the
Merewood 2006, Phillips 2010 and Phillips 2012 studies recruited
only mothers of babies admitted to neonatal intensive care units,
andthe Pound 2015 studyonlyincludedbabieswith jaundice. The
Ferrara 2008 and Stuebe 2016 trials focused on an intervention for
mothers with diabetes, the Martin 2015 and Carlsen 2013 studies
focused on overweight women, and the Gijsbers 2006 and Mesters
2013 trials on families with a history of asthma, while Moore 1985
looked at infants with a parent with eczema or asthma. Three other
trials recruited only women in high-risk groups (Chapman 2011;
McLeod 2003; Rasmussen 2011). Two studies focused providing
support for fathers (Byas 2011; Tohotoa 2012), and one study
concerned training for student nurses (Davis 2014).
The remaining trials were excluded for other reasons (Bica 2014;
Finch 2002; Haider 2014; Hives-Wood 2013; Hoddinott 2012a;
Lieu 2000; Mannan 2008; Nkonki 2014; Nor 2012; Ochola
2013a; Penfold 2014; Rasmussen 2011; Rowe 1990; Sciacca 1995;
Steel O’Connor 2003; Thakur 2012; Wasser 2015). Further de-
tails of these, and other excluded studies, can be found in the
Characteristics of excluded studies tables.
Risk of bias in included studies
Each trial was assessed for methodological quality as outlined in
the Methods section (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).
Allocation
Random sequence generation: we considered that a little over half
of the studies included in the review used methods that were at low
risk of bias to generate the randomisation sequence: we deemed
54 studies to be at low risk; nine studies at high risk and 38 studies
to be at unclear risk.
Allocation concealment: we considered that a little less than half
of the studies included in the review used methods that were at
low risk of bias to conceal allocation to experimental groups: we
deemed 44 studies to be at low risk; nine studies at high risk and
48 studies to be at unclear risk.
Blinding
Blinding participants and personnel: with interventions of this
type, itisverydifficulttoassessriskof biasassociatedwith blinding.
Both the mothers and the staff providing care would probably be
aware that they were either receiving or delivering an intervention.
In studies where there was randomisation at the clinic level, all
women may have been exposed to the same intervention, and
contamination between groups would thereby be reduced, but
there may still have been a risk of response bias if outcomes were
reported to staff providing care. Therefore, we assessed no studies
as being at a low risk of bias for this domain.
Blinding of outcome assessment: we assessed approximately one-
quarter of studies as being at low risk of bias for blinding of out-
come assessment: we deemed 27 studies to be at low risk, 27 stud-
ies to be at high risk, and 47 studies at unclear risk.
Incomplete outcome data
We had prespecified that we would not include data for any out-
come where there were missing data for more than 25% of the
randomised group. Loss to follow-up was a particular problem in
studies where women were recruited in the antenatal period and,
as we have described above, we have not included any outcome
data from studies that were otherwise eligible for inclusion in the
review because of high levels of attrition for all outcomes. For
some of those studies that contributed data there was still consid-
erable loss to follow-up, and loss was not always balanced across
randomisation groups. When assessing incomplete outcome data,
reasons for loss of data were not taken into consideration.
We judged approximately one-third of studies to be at low risk of
bias for incomplete outcome data: we deemed 36 studies to be at
low risk; 18 studies at high risk and 47 studies to be at unclear
risk.
Selective reporting
We assessed bias in most of the studies included in the review
from published study reports. In most cases we did not have access
to the trial registration or protocol. Under these circumstances
19
Support for healthy breastfeeding mothers with healthy term babies (Review)

 assessing risk of bias due to selective reporting bias is very difficult.
For this reason in the last version of this review all of the studies
were deemed to be at unclear risk of bias for this domain. In this
update we were able to access some protocols for newly included
studies. Only 10 studies have been assessed as being at low risk of
bias; five studies as high risk of bias and 86 studies as unclear.
Other potential sources of bias
We have noted any other concerns about bias (including any ap-
parent baseline imbalance between randomised groups) in the
Characteristics of included studies tables along with further in-
formation about the judgements we made about risk of bias for
each included study. The quality of the studies was very mixed
and most of the studies had some methodological weakness, or
did not provide good information about methods. It is important
that the mixed quality of the evidence is taken into account in the
interpretation of results. We judged 28 studies to be at low risk of
other potential sources of bias; six studies at high risk of bias and
67 studies at unclear risk.
Effects of interventions

care: 73 studies
Primary outcomes
Outcome 1.1: Stopping any breastfeeding up to six months
postpartum
The main summary outcome measure was cessation of any breast-
feeding at the time of the last study assessment up to six months
(Analysis 1.1).
In the meta-analysis for this outcome the previous version of this
review we included 40 trials with 14,227 women (effective sam-
ple size). With the new studies we added in this update, there are
now 51 studies with 21,418 women included. One new study (the
BINGO trial, Bonuck 2014a), contributes two intervention arms
to the analysis and the control group was split to avoid double
counting. One of the cluster-randomised trials (McLachlan 2016)
also contributed two intervention arms and splitting over the con-
trol group was included in the adjustment for clustering.
Interventions to support breastfeeding appear to have a beneficial
effect on the number of women who continue breastfeeding be-
yond six months, with fewer women in the groups that receive sup-
port stopping breastfeeding by this time (average risk ratio (RR)
0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.95;moderate-quality
evidence). Overall, 52.59% of those receiving support interven-
tions had stopped any breastfeeding by six months compared with
56.64% of controls (unweighted percentages). However, there was
high heterogeneity for this outcome and results should therefore
be interpreted with caution (heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01, I² = 55%,
Chi² = 116.09, P < 0.00001).
Sensitivity analysis using only studies assessed as having a low risk
of bias for allocation concealment demonstrated a similar positive
treatment effect on breastfeeding at up to six months (Analysis
1.5). A sensitivity analysis omitting the cluster-randomised study
(Elliott-Rudder 2014) for which a design effect could not be cal-
culated demonstrated a similar positive treatment effect (average
RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.94).
Visual inspection of the funnel plot generated for this outcome
suggested that there was some asymmetry with results from smaller
studies tending to show a greater positive treatment effect (Figure
3).

Funnel plot of comparison: 1 All forms of support versus usual care, outcome: 1.1 Stopping

Outcome 1.2: Stopping exclusive breastfeeding up to six
months postpartum
In the previous version of this review we included 33 studies with
11,961 women in the analysis of women who had stopped ex-
clusive breastfeeding at up to six months. With the new studies
we added in this update, there are now 46 studies with 18,591
women included. Two new studies (the BINGO trial, Bonuck
2014a;Yotebieng 2015), contribute two intervention arms to the
analysis; we split the control group to avoid double-counting.
Women in the intervention groups were less likely to have stopped
exclusive breastfeeding before six months (average RR 0.88, 95%
CI 0.85 to 0.92; moderate-quality evidence) (Heterogeneity: Tau²
= 0.01, I² = 96%, Chi² = 1076.75, P<0.00001; Analysis 1.2); al-
though 74.9% of women in the intervention groups had stopped
exclusive breastfeedingbythistime,agreaterproportionof women
in the control groups had stopped (83.4%; unweighted percent-
ages).
Sensitivity analysis using only those studies assessed as having a
low risk of bias for allocation concealment revealed that results
still significantly favoured the intervention groups (Analysis 1.6),
although the effect size was reduced in the studies at low risk
of bias (average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.96). A sensitivity
analysis omitting the one arm of the cluster-randomised study
(Yotebieng 2015) for which a design effect could not be calculated
demonstrated the same positive treatment effect (average RR 0.88,
95% CI 0.84 to 0.91).
Visual examinationof afunnel plotforthis outcome suggestedthat
the treatment effect may have been more pronounced in smaller
studies (Figure 4).

Outcome 1.3: Stopping any breastfeeding before four to six
weeks postpartum
In the previous version of this review we included 25 studies with
8513 women in the analysis of women stopping breastfeeding
before four to six weeks. With the new studies we added in this
update, there are now 33 studies with 10,776 women included.
Two new studies (the BINGO trial, Bonuck 2014a; Fu 2014),
contribute two intervention arms to the analysis, and we have split
the control arm to avoid double-counting.
Women receiving support interventions were less likely to stop
breastfeeding before six weeks (average RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80
to 0.95; moderate-quality evidence): while 31.3% of women in
the intervention groups had stopped exclusive breastfeeding by
this time, 34.8% of women in control groups had also stopped
(unweighted percentages). There was considerable variation in the
results from individual studies (heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.02, I² =
54%, Chi² = 74.65, P = 0.0001; Analysis 1.3).
Sensitivity analysis using only those studies assessed as having a
low risk of bias for allocation concealment revealed that results
still significantly favoured the intervention groups (Analysis 1.7),
although the effect size was reduced in the studies at low risk of
bias (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96).
Visual examinationof afunnel plotforthis outcome suggestedthat
the treatment effect may have been more pronounced in smaller
studies (Figure 5).

 Figure 5.
Funnel plot of comparison: 1 All forms of support versus usual care, outcome: 1.3 Stopping
breastfeeding (any) at up to 4-6 weeks
Outcome 1.4: Stopping exclusive breastfeeding before four to
six weeks postpartum
In the previous version of this review, we included 24 studies with
7693 women in the analysis of women who had stopped exclusive
breastfeeding before four to six weeks. With the new studies we
added in this update, there are now 32 studies with 10,960 women
included. Two new studies (the BINGO trial, Bonuck 2014a; Fu
2014), contribute two intervention arms to the analysis, and we
have split the controls to avoid double-counting.
Women in the intervention groups were less likely to stop exclu-
sive breastfeeding by six weeks compared with women in the con-
trol groups (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; moderate-
quality evidence); and while 57.2% of women in the intervention
groups had stopped exclusive breastfeeding by this time, 65.0% of
women in control groups had also stopped (unweighted percent-
ages); (heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.10, I² = 97%, Chi² = 1160.22, P
< 0.00001; Analysis 1.4).
Again, there was some evidence that the treatment effect may be
partly due to bias; sensitivity analysis including only those studies
assessed as being at low risk of bias for allocation concealment
showed that results still favoured the intervention group although
the treatment effect was less pronounced in the studies at lower risk
of bias (Analysis 1.8). A sensitivity analysis omitting the cluster-
randomised study (Ochola 2013) for which a design effect could
not be calculated demonstrated a similar positive treatment effect
(average RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89).
Visual examination of the funnel plot for this outcome suggested
that the treatment effect may have been more pronounced in
smaller studies and that there may be smaller studies missing which
do not find an effect in favour of the intervention (Figure 6).

Secondary outcomes
This update of the review does not include an analysis of secondary
outcomes.
Secondary outcomes were not considered in this update so that the
review could be completed in time to inform the World Health
Organisation’s review of the evidence and update of the WHO rec-
ommendations on breastfeeding in maternity facilities. A new set
of core outcomes for Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth breast-
feeding reviews is currently being developed and the outcomes
from this core set may influence future outcomes chosen for this
review.
Subgroup analysis
There was considerable variation between the trials in terms of the
interventions examined, the standard care offered to women, and
the background breastfeeding initiation rates in the various study
settings. We wanted to explore whether different types of support
and settings were associated with different or more pronounced
treatment effects. Therefore, for the review’s four primary out-
comes we carried out subgroup analysis to explore the impact of
interventions involving different types of supporter (professional
versus lay person, or both); types of support (face-to-face versus
telephone support or both); timing of support (antenatal and post-
natal versus postnatal alone); whether the support was proactive
(scheduled contacts) or reactive (women needed to request sup-
port); and whether support interventions had similar effects in
settings with different background breastfeeding initiation rates
(low, medium or high background rates).
For all subgroup analyses, the covariate chosen does little to explain
the high heterogeneity; most within-group heterogeneity remains
high.
Who delivered the support
For our four primary outcomes, we examined whether the treat-
ment effect was similar where the support was delivered by pro-
fessionals as opposed to non-professionals (lay support) or both.
It should be noted that most studies involved delivery of the in-
tervention by professionals (37 of the 51 studies).
For cessation of any breastfeeding at up to six months it appeared
that support from non-professionals was associated with a broadly
similar treatment effect to that for support from professionals (
24

 Analysis 2.1).
The test for subgroup differences suggests a differential treatment
effect according to who delivers the support, but we are not con-
fident in this result due to very different subgroup sizes and high
within-group heterogeneity in two of three groups and zero het-
erogeneity in the other (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 6.02,
degrees of freedom (df) = 2 (P = 0.05), I² = 66.8%). When the
smaller, mixed support group is removed from the analysis, there
is no evidence of a difference between lay and professional support
(test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 2.89, df = 1 (P = 0.09), I² =
65.4%).
For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months the
treatment effect appears to be greater when the intervention was
delivered by non-professionals (lay support) compared with pro-
fessionals or mixed support (test for subgroup differences: Chi² =
7.74, df = 2 (P = 0.02), I² = 73.1%; Analysis 2.2). The confidence
intervals for professional and lay support do not overlap, but due
to the high heterogeneity remaining within the subgroups, we ad-
vise caution when interpreting this result.
For cessation of any breastfeeding by four to six weeks there is no
evidence for a differential effect when professionals, lay or both
deliver support (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.47, df = 2
(P = 0.48), I² = 0%; Analysis 2.3).
For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding by four to six weeks the test
for subgroup differences indicates a possible differential treatment
effect (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 7.12, df = 2 (P =
0.03), I² = 71.9%). However, we are not confident in this result,
because the mixed subgroup is disproportionately small. When
this third group is removed from the analysis there is no evidence
for a differential effect between professional and lay support test
for subgroup differences: Chi² = 2.31, df = 1 (P = 0.13), I² =
56.7%; Analysis 2.4).
Type of support
We compared different types of intervention (support provided
predominantly by face-to-face contact, predominantly by tele-
phone, or by both face-to-face and telephone contact) for our pri-
mary outcomes.
For cessation of any breastfeeding at up to six months there was
no evidence of a differential effect according to type of support
(test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.40, df = 2 (P = 0.82), I² =
0%; Analysis 3.1).
For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months face-to-
face interventions may be associated with greater effects than other
types of support; however, very high within-group heterogeneity
remains in the analysis, and we advise caution when interpreting
this result (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 37.55, df = 2
(P<.00001, I² = 94.7%; Analysis 3.2).
For cessation of any breastfeeding by four to six weeks, there is no
evidence of a differential effect according to type of support (test
for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.91, df = 2 (P = 0.64), I² = 0%;
Analysis 3.3).
For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to four to six weeks,
face-to-face interventions may be associated with greater effects
than other types of support; however very high within-group het-
erogeneity remains in the analyses, and we advise caution when in-
terpreting this result (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 10.63,
df = 2 (P = 0.005), I² = 81.2%; Analysis 3.4).
When the support was offered
We examined whether offering support with an antenatal com-
ponent rather than postnatal support alone was associated with
any difference in treatment effect. The results were similar in both
subgroups for all of our four primary outcomes and there were
no significant subgroup differences according to the interaction
tests (Analysis 4.1 test for subgroup differences: test for subgroup

Proactive versus reactive support
We had planned to carry out formal subgroup analysis by whether
support was proactive or reactive, but due to the fact that most
interventions included at least one scheduled contact (proactive),
we did not think that this way of categorising studies would shed
light on types of interventions that were effective or ineffective.
Background breastfeeding initiation rates in study settings
We were interested in whether or not background rates of breast-
feeding in different settings had any impact on the success of inter-
ventions. We divided the studies into three groups: those carried
out in settings where 80% or more women initiated breastfeeding
(high background initiation), where between 60% to 80% initi-
ated breastfeeding (intermediate) or where breastfeeding initiation
rates were less than 60% (low). These groups showed an inverse
relationship with World Bank country income groups. The stud-
ies with high background rates of breastfeeding initiation were
set in countries from all the World Bank country income groups,
however, the four studies from low-/low-middle income countries
had the highest rates (more than 95%). All the studies with inter-
mediate or low background rates of breastfeeding initiation were
undertaken in high-income countries.
We found the interventions had a greater effect of preventing
women stopping exclusive breastfeeding at both time points in
countries where background rates were already high; there was no
similar effect on any breastfeeding. Because within-group hetero-
geneity remains high in all analyses, we advise caution when in-
terpreting this result.

 For cessation of any breastfeeding at up to six months, there is
no evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of the intervention
according to the background breastfeeding rate (test for subgroup
differences: Chi² = 0.56, df = 2 (P = 0.76), I² = 0%; Analysis 5.1).
For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months, the
intervention effect appears greater in studies where breastfeeding
initiation rates were high (test for subgroup differences: Chi² =
30.73, df = 2 (P <.00001, I² = 93.5%; Analysis 5.2). However,
within-group heterogeneity remains very high, and we advise cau-
tion when interpreting this result.
For cessation of any breastfeeding by four to six weeks, there is no
evidence that the interventions worked differently in trials with
different background rates of breastfeeding (test for subgroup dif-
ferences: Chi² = 2.72, df = 2 (P = 0.26), I² = 26.6%; Analysis 5.3).
For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to four to six weeks,
the intervention effect appears stronger in studies where initiation
rates were high (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 9.24, df =
2 (P = 0.010), I² = 78.4% Analysis 5.4). However, within-group
heterogeneity remains very high in all subgroups, and we advise
caution when interpreting this result.
Intensity of the intervention: the number of postnatal
contacts
We examined whether different numbers of postnatal contacts
were associated with any difference in treatment effect.We divided
the studies into four subgroups: unspecified or no direct contacts
(for example in studies that involved staff training rather than
direct contacts with women); less than four postnatal contacts;
between four and eight contacts; and more than eight contacts.
Trials including antenatal contacts are included here, and we used
the number of postnatal contacts to determine the appropriate
subgroup.
For cessation of any breastfeeding at the final study assessment up
to six months, there was no evidence of subgroup differences (test
for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.45, df = 3 (P = 0.69, I² = 0%;
Analysis 6.1).
For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months, there
appears to be a differential effect of the number of postnatal con-
tacts, with four to eight contacts performing best. The confidence
intervals for this subgroup do not overlap with any other sub-
group, but within-group heterogeneity for all subgroups remains
very high, and we advise caution when interpreting this result
(Analysis 6.2; test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 13.78, df = 3
(P = 0.003), I² = 78.2%).
For cessation of any breastfeeding by four to six weeks, there was no
evidence of a differential treatment effect according to the number
of postnatal contacts (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 1.59,
df = 3 (P = 0.66), I² = 0%; Analysis 6.3).
For cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at up to four to six weeks
there appears to be differential treatment effect according to the
number of support contacts, with four to eight contacts the most
effective schedule. However, within-group heterogeneity remains
veryhigh inall subgroups, andwe advise cautionwheninterpreting
this result (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 7.62, df = 3 (P =
0.05), I² = 60.6%; Analysis 6.4).

Summary of main results
This update of the review considered the evidence of the effect
of breastfeeding support interventions on primary outcomes of
stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks
and at up to six months postpartum. The review includes 100
trials published from 1979 to 2016, 73 of which contributed data
to the analyses. The 73 trials that contributed data to the analyses
were conducted in 29 countries; 52 studies (62.1% of participants)
in high-income countries, 15 (30.1% of participants) in upper-
middle income countries, four (3.4% of participants) in lower-
middle income countries, and four (4.4% of participants) in low-
income countries. The numbers of trials include one (Tylleskar
2011a; Tylleskar 2011b; Tylleskar 2011c) that was conducted in
three countries; two low-income and one upper-middle income
countries. This number and location of trials indicates that the
challenge of supporting women to breastfeed is both longstanding
and international; this is also reflected in the continuing low rates
of duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding in many countries,
despite increasing availability of good-quality evidence of the scale
of its public health impact.
This updated review provides evidence that interventions to sup-
port breastfeeding appear to reduce the risk of women stopping
any breastfeeding at up to six months and exclusive breastfeed-
ing at up to six months. Similarly the review provides evidence
that women receiving breastfeeding support interventions were
less likely to stop any breastfeeding before six weeks and exclusive
breastfeeding at up to four to six weeks. The size of the treatment
effects varied considerably in different trials, and average treatment
effects may not be applicable in different settings. The subgroup
analyses suggested that face-to-face support was associated with
a greater treatment effect for exclusive breastfeeding than either
telephone support alone or mixed telephone and face-to-face sup-
port. Similarly, support interventions were associated with greater
effect on exclusive breastfeeding in settings with high background
breastfeeding initiation rates compared to settings with low or in-
termediate breastfeeding initiation rates. Lay support and more
contact in the form of scheduled visits (4 to 8 visits) were also
associated with greater treatment effects. However, for all of these
subgroup results, the within-group heterogeneity remains high,
and we advise caution when interpreting these results.
A striking aspect of this updated review is the heterogeneity of the
support interventions, and the diversity of settings and of stan-
dard care. Interventions deemed by researchers to be ‘supportive’
26

 included some where it was difficult to see how women might ac-
tually feel supported, especially when the support service provided
was one they had to ask for, or travel a distance to get to (Graffy
2004; Hoddinott 2009), or where there was only one scheduled
contact with the support person. However, this updated review,
like the previous update (Renfrew 2012b), has shown that the ef-
fect of supportive interventions is robust across settings and pop-
ulation groups, and results from a wide range of interventions.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This review adds 21 trials contributing data to its evidence base
compared to its predecessors (Britton 2007; Renfrew 2012b;
Sikorski 2002). The number of mother-infant pairs in these stud-
ies has increased to 74,656 from 56,451 in Renfrew 2012b. The
reporting of the included studies was, however, often not com-
prehensive - lacking, for example, in terms of a description of the
components of the support intervention, details of the training
and qualifications of the supporters, the definitions used of the
extent of breastfeeding and in the description of adherence to the
support protocol. There was also a failure to present details of the
interventions and of the standard care available to both interven-
tion and comparison groups. Very few of the trials described a
theoretical basis for the intervention tested, with the result that
the findings are difficult to explain or to replicate. There has been
slight improvement in study reporting or quality, with 44 out of
the 73 trials that contributed data (60%) reporting an approach
to allocation concealment that we considered to be at low risk of
bias compared to 26 of the 52 trials (50%) in the previous review
(Renfrew 2012b).
It is possible that not all existing trials have been included in this
meta-analysis. Funnel plot analyses conducted for the primary
outcomes all show marked asymmetry, with each suggesting that
smaller studies showing a less beneficial effect of the intervention
maybe missing.Thismaybe the resultof publicationbiasalthough
it is also possible that few or no such trials exist. Nevertheless,
caution should be taken when interpreting the evidence as funnel
plot asymmetry can also be the result of heterogeneity.
Interventions offered across all included studies were very diverse,
as was the provision of standard care. Interventions included, for
example, one individual session in hospital, offering women the
opportunity to attend a group session in community settings, tele-
phone support, and multiple one-to-one visits at home over sev-
eral months. Five studies offered the intervention in the context of
Baby Friendly accreditation of the hospital, and are unlikely to be
generalisable to settings where this standard of care is not available
to all women.
Study endpoints also varied widely, with some substantial gaps of
many months between the completion of the intervention and
the last study outcome assessed. Many only offered support in
the early days or weeks. These factors, together with the range of
different settings and population subgroups studied, should urge
caution in the interpretation of the analysis of pooled data.
Despite this caution, the overall benefit identified from all forms
of support interventions has been explored with subgroup and
sensitivity analyses and is moderately robust following exclusion
of the methodologically weaker trials. In this review, the greatest
effect of breastfeeding support interventions on reducing cessation
of exclusive breastfeeding before six months occurred in commu-
nities with high (over 80%) levels of breastfeeding initiation. This
suggests that work to promote breastfeeding at a population level
should continue as one strategy to increase breastfeeding duration
and exclusivity (Dyson 2009; Rollins 2016).
While the effect size of support interventions on reducing the ces-
sation of any breastfeeding is modest, there is evidence of a greater
effect on the prolongation of exclusive breastfeeding. There was
a reduction in the cessation of exclusive breastfeeding within the
first six months and at up to four to six weeks when lay support
was used, although in view of considerable within-subgroup het-
erogeneity, these findings should be interpreted with caution.
We have explored a range of possible reasons to explain the signifi-
cant heterogeneity in the findings. As noted above, included stud-
ies were very varied in setting, population group studied, content,
timing and intensity of the intervention, whether it was proac-
tively offered to women or available only if they asked for it, the
standard care available, staff training programmes, and the type
and timing of the outcomes measured.
Strategies that depend mainly on face-to-face support appear more
effective than those that rely primarily on telephone contact for
women who practice exclusive breastfeeding. The duration of the
intervention also seems to be an important factor for exclusive
breastfeeding. Interventions that relied on one session in hospi-
tal are very different from interventions where women receive re-
peated home visits. We attempted to examine this by assessing the
intensity of the intervention, and we found studies with four to
eight visits to be associated with a more pronounced treatment ef-
fect on exclusive breastfeeding at final study assessment. However
there was some evidence that more pronounced treatment effects
were associated with studies at higher risk of bias; this could poten-
tially confound any differences between subgroups. Caution is also
needed in the interpretation of this finding as there is inconsistent
reporting due to variations in the timing of outcome assessments,
and the settings of studies and the population groups included in
studies with more face-to-face visits. There was no evidence found
for a difference between solely postnatal interventions and those
interventions with both an antenatal and postnatal component.
It is likely that support will be most effective when it reflects the
local needs of the population. It was notable that none of the five
studies where women were expected to access support without any
proactive element found a difference in outcomes between control
and intervention groups. Four of these five were UK-based studies,
which may help to explain the lack of effect seen in recent UK
trials (Hoddinott 2011).

 The findings of the subgroup analysis that suggests that interven-
tions with four to eight contacts are best compared to those with
either fewer contacts or nine or more contacts seems counter-in-
tuitive. Given the heterogeneity of the somewhat complex inter-
ventions being tested, however, we might assume that it is other
aspects of the interventions that may be responsible. One of the
ways to test this would be to conduct meta-regression of the effects
of the number of contacts; thus ensuring that the exact number of
contacts is used for each study rather than the categorization we
have used. This is something we will explore in a future update of
this review. We will also consider, in a future update, adopting an
analysis strategy which would treat the outcomes as time-to-event
data (i.e. ’time to breastfeeding cessation’ and ’time to cessation of
exclusive breastfeeding’). However, whilst some studies do provide
such data, many currently do not.
Quality of the evidence
We considered that the overall risk of bias of trials included in
the review was mixed. We graded fewer than half of the studies
(44/100) as being at low risk of bias for allocation concealment.
However, when we carried out sensitivity analysis which included
only those studies at low risk of bias for allocation concealment,
the results were not substantially different. A potentially impor-
tant source of bias in these studies was the general lack of blinding.
However, given the nature of the intervention it is unlikely that
participants or personnel, or both, would be blinded, as for the
support interventions, trialists would face considerable difficulties
in blinding staff and women. We graded blinding of outcome as-
sessment as being at low risk in about a quarter of studies. How-
ever, even where an attempt is made to blind outcome assessment,
there is still a risk of response bias for outcomes relying on self-
report such as any or exclusive breastfeeding. A further possible
source of bias was loss to follow-up and missing outcome data. In
the 17 studies with an attrition of more than 25%, the reasons for
attrition were unclear, and these studies did not contribute data
to the review. However, we are aware that even lower levels of at-
trition are problematic, particularly where loss was not balanced
across different arms of trials. To avoid problems associated with
attrition, we carried out intention-to-treat analysis for our primary
outcomes; that is, we assumed that all women who were lost to
follow-up had stopped breastfeeding by given time points. This is
likely to have diluted overall treatment effects but these estimates
may be more appropriate given the possibility of response bias
and the increased likelihood of women who stopped breastfeeding
dropping out before those who continued.
We assessed the four primary outcomes with GRADE criteria. We
did not downgrade any evidence for lack of blinding during this
assessment; neither did we downgrade trials for other risk of bias
domains (our sensitivity analyses were robust, as reported above).
We judged all outcomes to be of moderate quality - stopping ’any’
breastfeeding at up to six months; ’any’ breastfeeding between four
to six weeks; stopping exclusive breastfeeding at up to six months;
or stopping exclusive breastfeeding between four to six weeks;
all analyses had substantial heterogeneity even with a random-
effects model. An assessment of moderate quality highlights our
uncertainty in the summary estimate presented here. Included
trials of breastfeeding support had mixed results for preventing
women from stopping exclusive breastfeeding.
In meta-analyses with a large number of trials, as is the case in this
review, there is a strong possibility that a large number of small
and possibly poor quality trials will have a substantial influence
on the result. In such circumstances it is preferable, therefore, to
conduct a sensitivity analysis confined to the trials of the best
methodological quality, which would be assumed to be the most
reliable and unbiased. Apart from allocation concealment, we have
not performed such an analysis, since none of the studies were
assessed as being low risk of bias across all of the domains of bias
we assessed.
Potential biases in the review process
There is a potential for bias to be introduced at any stage of the
review process. In order to minimise the bias in the review process,
two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion
and any disagreements were resolved by a third review author.
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed by one
reviewer and then checked by a second review author. Again any
discrepancies were resolved by a third review author. It must be
stressed that ’Risk of bias’ assessment is subjective in nature and
therefore another team of review authors may have graded studies
differently. It is also worth noting that we did not formerly assess
risk of bias in the 15 included cluster-randomized trials. Particular
biases are unique to cluster designs, as described in the Handbook
[section16.3.2] and formal assessments will be made of these in
future updates. To minimise language bias any study not reported
in English was translated into English and included in the review
provided it met the inclusion criteria. This update was limited to
primary outcomes so that it could be completed in time to inform
important international guidance on infant feeding. All primary
and secondary outcomes will be considered in the next update of
this review. The development of a core outcome set for breast-
feeding reviews is currently underway and this may influence the
choice of outcomes in subsequent updates. This update, consistent
with the previous versions of the review, combined different lev-
els of interventions, so that trials in which breastfeeding mothers
received the intervention were combined with trials where the in-
tervention was directed at the staff providing the support. We will
reconsider this approach in the next update. It is also of concern
that there was missing data for 28 studies. Whilst we attempted to
identify all the evidence on interventions to support breastfeeding
(including published abstracts from conference proceedings) and
followed-up ongoing studies, it is feasible that relevant research
28

 that is unpublished or not registered in a clinical trials register
could have been missed.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The overall findings of this review, that breastfeeding support in-
terventions have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk
of cessation of any breastfeeding and of exclusive breastfeeding,
are similar to the findings of other reviews (Rollins 2016; Sinha
2015). We concur with others, e.g. Hoddinott 2011 and Renfrew
2007, that it is critically important to identify the characteristics
of support that may make this important but heterogenous in-
tervention more or less effective in different circumstances and
settings. For example, Jolly 2012b found that peer support had a
greater effect on reducing the risk of non-exclusive breastfeeding
in low- and middle-income countries compared to high-income
countries, especially in the UK. Other recent reviews have found
that interventions to increase breastfeeding duration and exclusiv-
ity are more effective when delivered as multi-component struc-
tured programmes such as the Baby Friendly Hosptial Initiative/
Baby Friendly Initiative (BFHI/BFI), in a combination of settings
(Beake 2012; Pérez-Escamilla 2016; Rollins 2016; Sinha 2015).

Implications for practice
When breastfeeding support is offered to women, the duration
and exclusivity of breastfeeding is increased. Characteristics of ef-
fective support include: that it is offered as standard by trained
personnel during antenatal or postnatal care, that it includes on-
going scheduled visits so that women can predict when support
will be available, and that it is tailored to the setting and the needs
of the population group. Support is likely to be more effective in
settings with high initiation rates. Support may be offered either
by professional or lay/peer supporters, or a combination of both.
Strategies that rely mainly on face-to-face support are more likely
to succeed with women practising exclusive breastfeeding.
Implications for research
There is a very large number of trials in this field and this number
continues to grow. This has resulted in a great deal of research time,
energyandfunding. While there are still questionstoaddressabout
how best to provide support, the key messages are clear - we have
ample evidence to know that women need support to be available
and to be provided using the characteristics we have identified
to increase the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding. The key
research question for the future is to identify how such support
can best be provided consistently, for all women, in all countries.
This becomes a scaling-up issue, which needs implementation and
quality improvement approaches rather than effectiveness studies.
Any future studies should describe in detail the attributes of the
intervention (who delivered it, setting, intensity, proactive or re-
active); standard care (Baby Friendly accreditation or not, staff
trained in breastfeeding or not); the population group studied
(low- versus high-income, any selection criteria); and the back-
ground breastfeeding rates in the population studies. Studies
should also examine the potential for synergy between support
and other interventions that aim to increase breastfeeding rates,
as it may be that a package of interventions is more effective than
single interventions in tackling the multifaceted challenge of in-
creasing breastfeeding rates. Packages to be tested could include
peer and professional support along with, for example, antenatal
education, staff training, and mother-to-mother support. Studies
should also assess the effectiveness of lay, professional and com-
bined support in different settings - in particular in those com-
munities with low rates of breastfeeding initiation. Implementa-
tion of the Baby Friendly Initiative should be accompanied by the
continued monitoring of breastfeeding rates to explore whether its
effect is similar in countries with differing rates of initiation and
prevalence of breastfeeding.
Further study is also required to:
• test the effectiveness of different training programmes
(which should be well-defined and reproducible) and should
attempt to address impact on both exclusive and any
breastfeeding where possible;
• analyse and develop the theoretical basis for their approach,
and analyse the elements of their approach that appear to have an
impact, including training, timing, and intensity of the
intervention, and differential impact on different population
subgroups;
• establish the cost-effectiveness of different interventions;
• investigate appropriate strategies for supporting women
who wish to breastfeed for longer than six months;

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Abbass-Dick 2015
Methods
2-arm RCT, single-site, n = 214
Participants
Large urban teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: 89%
Inclusion criteria: primiparous mothers in the first 2 days postpartum, singleton birth,
≥ 18 years old, ≥ 37 weeks’ gestation at delivery, able to speak and read English, and
living with a male partner
Exclusion criteria: women sharing a hospital room with a current study participant, a
medical problem that could interfere with breastfeeding, infant not discharged from
hospital with them, no access to the Internet or a telephone, planning to breastfeed for
< 12 weeks, and had a partner who would not be available to participate in the study
Interventions
Intervention: the trial intervention was a multifaceted coparenting breastfeeding support
intervention, provided face-to-face on the postpartum unit, at which time the couples
were provided with breastfeeding information, the information package was reviewed,
and couples were given the option of watching a video. The session took 15 min in the
majority of cases. Couples had a take-home breastfeeding booklet, developed by Best
Start: Ontarios Maternal, Newborn and Early Child Development Resource Centre,
access to a secure study web site that consisted of extensive information on breastfeeding
and coparenting and contained links to related information and resources on the Internet
including a copy of the video to watch at home. The couples were followed up at home
with emails at 1 and 3 weeks postpartum and a telephone call at 2 weeks postpartum to
answer any questions or concerns about the information provided
Control: couples received usual care, which included standard in-hospital breastfeeding
support and any breastfeeding assistance that was proactively sought in the community
Outcomes
Primary:
Exclusive breastfeeding at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postpartum
Secondary:
Breastfeeding duration at 6 and 12 weeks postpartum
Maternal perceptions of breastfeeding support
Maternal perception of the coparenting relationship at 12 weeks postpartum

Methods
3-arm RCT, with individual randomisation n=231
Participants
The study was carried out in the Tema area of Ghana (sub-Saharan Africa). Women
were recruited in prenatal clinics in 2 hospitals (1 government and 1 private) that served
urban areas (an industrial city and a commercial town)
High baseline prevalence of breastfeedinginGhana, the median duration of breastfeeding
was reported as being 22 months and 53.4% of women with babies < 6 months breastfeed
exclusively. It was reported that ”almost all“ mothers initiated breastfeeding
231 women randomized (136 eligible at the beginning of the intervention period)
Inclusion criteria: pregnant women in the last trimester planning delivery in the study
hospitals and to stay in study area for 6 months after delivery. After delivery: singleton
babies with normal birthweight (> 2500 g) and Apgar scores ≥ 6 at 1 min and 5 min
Exclusion criteria: multiple birth, low Apgar score or planning to move out of area
Participant characteristics:
38% of the women had only primary level or no formal education; 90% were married
or living with a partner; 46% were primiparous; 73% had vaginal birth; 24% lived in
households with access to a car; 74% were described as trader/artisan
Interventions
All 3 groups (intervention 1, intervention 2 and control) were allocated to 2 educational
group sessions during pregnancy by trained nurses and 9 proactive home visits by trained
nurse counsellors at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks postpartum. These were in
addition to standard care. The content of the sessions differed between the 3 groups.
63% of intervention 1, 73% of intervention 2 and 65% of the control group women
received all 9 scheduled home follow-up visits

(Continued)
Intervention 1 (n = 74): 43 followed up. Content of sessions was breastfeeding and
exclusive breastfeeding. Trained local nurses with experience of breastfeeding gave 2
educational sessions, of approximately 20 min each, to groups of 2-4 women during
their third trimester. At postpartum home visits women received individual counselling
and nurses were advised to respond to concerns. Materials were developed from WHO/
UNICEF breastfeeding counselling training manual
Intervention 2 (n = 72): 44 followed up. Content of the pregnancy sessions was general
health and childcare as for control group. Content of the postpartum home visits was
breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding as for intervention 1
Control (n = 85): 49 followed up. Content of sessions was general health and childcare
topics such as immunisation, HIV/AIDS, nutrition and family planning
Outcomes
Breastfeeding status at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months, exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months,
infant morbidity and growth
Notes
We have not included data from this study in the review due to high levels of attrition
(> 25% loss to follow-up). Most data were reported in graphs and difficult to interpret.
Several measures of exclusive breastfeeding were reported; at 1 and 6 months women
were asked about breastfeeding since birth, during previous month and on previous day.
In this review we have reported figures for exclusive breastfeeding since birth for both
time points. Figures in the paper were expressed as percentage of women still exclusively
breastfeeding; in order to use the data we used subtraction to calculate a figure for women
who had stopped breastfeeding

considering breastfeeding, planning delivery at study hospital and resident in area for 3
months after the birth, 185% of the federal poverty level, available for telephone contact
and willing to participate
Exclusion criteria for mothers: medical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension; drug
use that could impair breastfeeding
Exlusion criteria for infants: preterm, low birthweight (< 2500 g), any complications
requiring admission to special care, Apgar score < 7 at 1 min and 5 min
Participant characteristics: at baseline: intervention n = 63; control n = 72

Primiparous: intervention 92%; control 89%
Planned breastfeeding duration < 6 months: intervention 20%; control 46%
Planned breastfeeding duration 6-12 months or longer: intervention 80%; control 54%
Interventions
Intervention: in addition to standard care, women received 3 prenatal home visits, daily
in-hospital visits and 9 postpartum home visits from peer counsellors: 3 in first week,
2 in second week and 1 in each week for weeks 3-6. Women could also phone peer
counsellors. Peer counsellors were mothers from the area with experience of successful
breastfeeding and training from a lactation consultant (LC)
Control: women received what would have been standard care for private patients (these
women may not have normally qualified to receive this care as many were participating
in welfare programmes). This consisted of: breastfeeding support line open to mothers
after delivery staffed by a lactation specialist. Usual in-patient care and support for
breastfeeding was provided by hospital staff
Outcomes
Infant feeding practices (weekly for first month) breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeed-
ing. Infant morbidity (diarrhoea and ear infection). Breastfeeding outcomes measured in

Home conditions were described as bad (number of rooms, poor sanitation or water,
etc.) in 28.5% of control group and approximately 20% of the intervention groups
Few of the women (approximately 5%) worked outside the home.
Interventions
Intervention 1 (n = 301): 4 structured home visits from trained midwives at 1, 3 and 7
days and 4 weeks after the birth. Midwives examined mothers and infants and provided
and advice and support on a range of healthcare issues including breastfeeding support

included advice and education on breastfeeding
Control (n=301): received standard care in Syria (no postnatal visits)
Outcomes
Primary:
Maternal postpartum morbidities, postnatal care uptake, contraceptive uptake and type,
infant morbidities, infant immunisation according to the national schedule at 3 months
and Infant feeding (specifically exclusive breastfeeding during the first 4 months of life)
Secondary:
Women’s perceptions of their health, impressions about the home visit and perceptions
of its quality

Some baseline imbalance, women in the
control groups were more likely to have
poor home conditions and were less likely
to have received antenatal care. Outcome
data were collected at 4 months, but it is
likely that there may have been recall bias
for some outcomes, e.g. breast engorge-
ment - women in the intervention groups
would have discussed this and maybe it was
recorded at the time it occurred, women
in the control group would not have been
asked until 4 months postpartum. Out-
come data were collected for a large num-
ber of variables, so any differences may have
occurred by chance

Interventions
Intervention: health and nutrition workers in the intervention communities received
training based on Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses Training Manual on
Breastfeeding Counseling (WHO 1997). Messages - feed only breast milk for first 6
months of life; breastfeed the infant day and night, at least 8 times in 24 h; possible
adverse effects of other foods and fluids given to breastfeeding infants - given to mothers
at birth, plus monthly home visits, immunisation clinics and neighbourhood meetings
Control: at the control sites, the research team provided routine services, in which,
according to national policy, workers are required to advise exclusive breastfeeding for
4-6 months
Outcomes
Feeding at 3 months
Anthropometry and diarrhoea prevalence at 3 and 6 months

Bloom 1982
Methods
2-arm RCT, with individual randomisation (although the study also included a non-
randomised comparison group)
Participants
100 breastfeeding mothers randomized; recruited 3 days after the birth
Inclusion criteria: married, primiparous with healthy infants born at a maternity hospital
in Nova Scotia, Canada
Exclusion criteria: infants with birthweight < 2500 g, with Apgar scores < 5, twins,
women having operative deliveries, women who did not speak English
Interventions
Women in both groups received a pamphlet on breastfeeding.
Intervention: weekly telephone calls beginning 10 days after the birth made by a nurse
interviewer, offering support and advice and referral if necessary. Calls lasted 5-10 min
and were described as friendly. Women received up to 3 calls up to 6 weeks postpartum.
Calls ceased when women discontinued breastfeeding
Control: women received usual care (not specified)
Outcomes
Interviews at 6 weeks postpartum. Women were asked about infant behaviour and infant
feeding and breastfeeding duration
Notes
We have not included data from this study, because results in this paper were not reported
in a form in which we could use them in the review. Most of the results were not reported
according to randomisation group (rather authors described factors and associations
with, e.g. breastfeeding). Breastfeeding in the randomized groups at 6 weeks was not
reported and it was not possible to contact the authors to obtain this information. It
was stated that average breastfeeding duration was 28.6 days in the intervention group
vs 21.0 days for controls, but no SDs were reported. It was not clear when or how
breastfeeding duration data were collected; if at the 6-week postpartum interviews this
suggests that figures for average breastfeeding duration only apply to those women who
had discontinued breastfeeding and denominators are therefore not clear

Methods
2-arm RCT, n = 382
Participants
From 2 prenatal care centres in the Bronx, New York (reported to be the county in the
USA with the highest poverty rate)
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: low
Inclusion criteria: able to speak English or Spanish, singleton or twin pregnancy < 24
weeks (twins subsequently excluded), intending to keep infant and attend for prenatal
and postnatal care at centre and affiliated hospital, telephone contact numbers available
Exclusion criteria: HIV-positive status, chronic disease with medication not compatible
with breastfeeding, diabetes, serious illness, or breast reduction surgery
Participant characteristics:
57% Hispanic, 36% African-American, 62% multiparous (70% of these had previous
breastfeeding experience), mean age 25 years (SD 6.23), 51.5% married or living with
a partner, 57% receiving Medicaid
Interventions
Intervention (n = 188): delivered by a trained LC. Women were recruited when < 24
weeks pregnant, and had 2 prenatal LC visits scheduled. During late pregnancy there
was telephone contact, and hospital and home visits and telephone support (up to 12
months postpartum) were planned for the postnatal period. In the postnatal period
25% of the intervention group received at least 1 hospital contact; approximately 50%
had telephone and/or home visits; but 36% received no home or hospital visits and no
telephone support
Control (n = 194): women had no contact with the LC. Standard care varied between
the sites and neither site followed an established protocol for breastfeeding. Women
enrolled in women and child nutrition programmes (WIC) had the opportunity to visit
a breastfeeding co-ordinator

Outcomes
Infant health outcomes:
Duration of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding was presented mostly in graphical
form and was difficult to interpret. Breastfeeding was categorised on a 7-point scale from
7 = exclusive breastfeeding (which was defined as no other milk or food, but infants
may have received water and other liquids) through to exclusive formula, between these
extremes of the scale there were various ’intensities’ of breastfeeding (e.g. > 50% breast
milk). This meant that results were complicated and not easy to interpret. Women were
followed up for up to 12 months and detailed (graphical) weekly data were reported for
weeks 1-26 postpartum

Methods
Parallel 2-arm participant-level RCT, n = 666
Participants
Women who attended an urban medical centre providing prenatal care to a low income
population in the Bronx, New York City
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation:79%
Inclusion criteria: English- or Spanish-speaking women aged ≥18 years, in the first or
second trimester of a singleton pregnancy
Exclusion criteria: risk factors for premature birth maternal or infant conditions that
would preclude or complicate breastfeeding (e.g. mother HIV-positive, infant congenital
anomaly)
Interventions
666 women were randomized in a 1:3:3:1 ratio to: usual care, electronic prompt (EP)
alone, Lactation Consultant (LC) + EP
, or LC alone. Only the LC and EP+LC arms are
included in this review as the EP arm (n=253) was antental only and therefore does meet
the review inclusion criteria for a breastfeeding support intervention
LC intervention (n= 80): Two LCs were allocated to this intervention.The LC protocol
included 2 prenatal sessions, a hospital visit, and regular phone calls postpartum for 3
months or until breastfeeding ceased. The prenatal sessions occurred in the examination
room, during the 30-plus min of ’downtime’ while waiting for the prenatal care provider.
Attempts were made to complete interrupted sessions after the examination. The first
session focused on rapport building and education, and the second was on the practical
aspects of breastfeeding. The study provided nursing bras and breast pumps to LC group
participantsasneeded. LCsmetmothersandtheirinfantsatthe 1-weekroutine paediatric
visit, modelling practice on a recent review. Postpartum home visits were optional, based
upon participant and LC preference and comfort
LC + EP intervention (n=253): Included the LC protocol detailed above and electronic
prompts for healthcare providers to ask three brief open-ended questions which portrayed
breastfeeding as the norm. This was done during pre-natal care appointments
Control (n=80): usual care
Outcomes
For BINGO, the prespecified primary outcome measure was 3-month breastfeeding
intensity
Quote: ”We categorized breastfeeding intensity as < 20% (low), 20% to 80% (medium)
, and greater than 80% (high) of all feeds from breast milk consistent with previous
studies and Infant Feeding Practices Survey II analyses
Other analysis was planned. Power calculations were affected by the finding - “we found
that breastfeeding intensity was not normally distributed, and most women stopped
breastfeeding altogether during follow-up“.
Other outcomes:
Quote: “Study staff assessed infant feeding at 1, 3, and 6 months postpartum during
phone interviews using items adapted from the Infant Feeding Practices Survey II”;
exclusive breastfeeding, breastfeeding intensity (“defined as the percentage of all feedings
in the past 7 days that were breast milk”), breastfeeding initiation, and total duration

Methods
2-arm RCT, 1 site setting, n = 397 (unclear if this was the total number in the study
overall)
Participants
Children recruited at birth at the Hospital Centenário (the only hospital in the city of
São Leopoldo, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), only children in Brazilian National
Health Service (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS) wards were enrolled, between October
2001-June 2002
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: 95.8%
Inclusion criteria: newborn infants with birthweight ≥ 2500 g and gestational age ≥ 37
weeks
Exclusion criteria: none noted
Interventions
Intervention: mothers provided with dietary counselling based on the guidance provided
in the Ten Steps for Healthy Feeding of Children Younger Than Two Years
Counselingtookplace through 10home visits:one inthe first10daysafterbirth,monthly
up to 6 months and then at 8, 10 and 12 months. The dietary recommendations that the
mothers were given prioritised exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months and introduction
of complementary foods at the age of 6 months. Mothers were advised not to give their
children bottles or pacifiers. 12 undergraduate students of nutrition conducted the home
visits in pairs. The entire team was trained in the dietary guidelines and in techniques
for counselling mothers about the Ten Steps for Healthy Feeding of Children Younger
Than Two Years. Each dietary counselling session lasted 30 min-40 min
Control: women were visited at 6 and 12 months for collection of anthropometric,
dietary and sociodemographic data and to collect data on the infants’ health status
Interviewers, who were not involved in the intervention process and who were blinded
to the group to which the children belonged, conducted home visits at 6 and 12 months
in order to collect data on the study variables. Interviewers informed mothers about
the anthropometric results and instructed them to attend the nearest health service if
nutritional problems were detected
Outcomes
Following outcomes at 6 months of age for both groups: proportion of children exclu-
sively breastfed for < 1 month; proportion of children exclusively breastfed for 4 months
or more; proportion of children exclusively breastfed at 6 months; proportion of children
recieving breastmilk at 6-12 months and age at introduction of cows milk

Participants
Urban USA hospital prenatal clinic serving a low-income, predominantly Latina popu-
lation
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: low
Antenatal inclusion criteria: low-income women ≥ 18 years old, at ≤ 26 weeks’ gestation,
considering breastfeeding, not yet enrolled in peer counselling programme, resident in
hospital area, available for telephone follow-up
Postnatal inclusion criteria: healthy, full term singleton infants, no congenital abnormal-

Exclusion criteria: none stated
Interventions
Intervention: specialised breastfeeding peer counsellor (SBFPC) made 3 prenatal visits,
plus daily in-hospital support, and up to 11 postpartum home visits promoting exclusive
breastfeeding and addressing potential obesity-related breastfeeding barriers. Prenatal
visits involved assessment of previous breastfeeding experiences/knowledge, personalised
education about breastfeeding logistics, the risks of formula feeding, and anticipatory
guidance. During hospitalisation, women received 1 SBFPC visit per day, which were
similar in content to those provided by ’Breastfeeding: Heritage and Pride’ (BHP) peer
counsellors. The SBFPC ensured that intervention participants received a manual breast
pump before discharge
Control: standard breastfeeding support and staff peer counsellors (see below), which
involved routine access to breastfeeding support from hospital personnel, including staff
peer counsellors, plus prenatal breastfeeding education that included brief breastfeeding
discussions during routine clinic appointments and receipt of written educational mate-
rials. Staff nurses provided routine perinatal breastfeeding assistance, with LCs available
as needed. After discharge, participants could call the hospital telephone hotline with
breastfeeding questions
Standard care also included optional breastfeeding support from Breastfeeding: Heritage
and Pride (BHP) peer counsellors (PC), who provided the following: up to 3 prenatal
visits (covering breastfeeding benefits, breastfeeding myths, positioning, and common
breastfeeding problems and to educate with up to 7 personalised home visits during the
first year postpartum; and telephone support. If available, electric breast pumps were
loaned as needed. To receive prenatal PC visits, controls could self-refer or be referred
to the BHP program
Outcomes
Primary: breastfeeding initiation and the rates of exclusive and any breastfeeding at 2
weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum
Secondary: infant morbidity (diarrhoea, otitis media, emergency department visits, hos-
pitalisation), maternal amenorrhoea, and breastfeeding intensity
Notes
High attrition due to randomisation prior to birth resulting in high exclusion (Interven-
tion n = 76, 26.2%; Control n = 78, 24.3%) with further study attrition at 6 months

Coutinho 2005
Methods
2-arm RCT, with individual randomisation N=350
Participants
The study was carried out in 2 hospitals serving urban areas and neighbouring small
towns in the interior of the State of Pernambuco, north-eastern Brazil
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: high
Inclusion criteria: singleton infants
Exclusion criteria: infants with congenital anomalies or serious illness necessitating in-
tensive care and those whose mothers had serious disease or mental illness or were plan-
ning to leave the area within 6 months
Approximately 60% had an income lower than the minimum wage; 33% did not have
access to a flush toilet, approximately 35% of the mothers were < 20 years, 39% primi-
parous, approximately 28% had a caesarean delivery
Interventions
90% of maternity staff in both hospitals received the 18-h UNICEF/WHO Baby
Friendly Hospital Initiative training course. All participants in the intervention and con-
trol groups received their hospital postnatal care from these Baby-Friendly trained staff
Intervention: women (N=175) received 10 postnatal home visits (mean duration 30
min); 4 during the first month, 2 during the second month and 1 per month during
the third to sixth months. Each mother was given an illustrated booklet. At each visit
the home visitors observed the positioning of the infant at the breast, flow of milk and
the baby’s satisfaction; encouraged exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and continued
breastfeeding for at least 2 years, and used the booklet as a basis for discussions of key
topics relevant to the infant’s age. If there were any difficulties home visitors could not
resolve he/she referred the mother for more specialist help at the hospital. If other family

Background rates of breastfeeding initiation high, however median duration of exclusive
breastfeeding 29 days
Inclusion criteria: mothers living in the city of Porto Alegre, healthy non twin newborns
with a birthweight ≥ 2500 g
Exclusion criteria: mother-infant pairs that were unable to stay together due to a health
concern for either the mother or infant
Participant characteristics: ≥ 20 years old 76%, vaginal delivery 72%, white mothers

Interventions
Intervention (n=74) in hospital, 2 nurses reinforced the orientation about breastfeeding
technique routinely given to mothers, following the WHO breastfeeding counselling
principles, in a 30-min session with no more than 2 mother-infant pairs. Topics included
comfortable and proper mother and infant positioning, correct attachment of the child
to the breast and manual milk expression. Pictures, dolls and a model breast were used for
demonstrating proper breastfeeding technique. Women also received 2 home visits from
the same nurse, when the child reached 7 and 30 days of age. Infant feeding patterns,
positioning, attachment, milk expression and breastfeeding problems were discussed,
and breast examination performed
Control (n=137): standard hospital care met Baby-Friendly standards. The control group
appear not to have received home visits

Interventions
Intervention: telephone support from trained peer supporters (teen mothers who had
breastfed for > 4 weeks). Peer supporters telephoned the new teen mothers at 2, 4, 7 days
and 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks postdischarge. Peers introduced themselves and talked about the
breastfeeding experience. No specific discussion topics were assigned. Peers offered their
telephone numbers so that new mothers could call for support. They were advised to refer
anyone with a problem to telephone resources for breastfeeding information or to their
physician. Peers and women received gift voucher incentives to complete assessments
and training
Control: usual care included access to paediatric care providers and hospital LCs. The
control group did not receive telephone peer support

Methods
2-arm RCT, single site, n = 248
Participants
A major USA urban university hospital community doula intervention
Participant: low-income, African-American mothers < 22 years old
Breastfeeding rates: young African-American mothers continue to breastfeed at low rates,
and commonly introduce complementary foods earlier than recommended. In the 2006
National Health and Nutrition Study, for example, only 30% of black adolescent mothers
had ever attempted to breastfeed their infants
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation:79%
Inclusion criteria: women who were < 34 weeks pregnant, < 21 years of age, and planning
to deliver at the affiliated hospital were eligible to participate in the study
Exclusion criteria: mothers who were aware at the time of recruitment that they would
require a surgical delivery, who planned to move from the area, or who planned to give
up custody of the infant
Interventions
Intervention (n=124):
Women received additional care from doulas who were women from the same com-
munities as the women attending the clinic. During pregnancy women received weekly
home visits (average = 10) where the doula focused on building a relationship with the
mother and discussed pregnancy health, childbirth preparation, and bonding with the
unborn infant.Doulas were present during labour to provide support and help initiate
breastfeeding after birth.Doulas continued to provide face-to-face breastfeeding support
in the post-natal period (average 12 home visits). Doulas undertook a 20-week doula
training course provided by the Chicago Health Connection (Health Connect One) and
a 10-week breastfeeding peer counsellor training programme from the same organisation
Control (n=124): mothers received usual prenatal care; no doula input
Outcomes
Primary outcomes: data on breastfeeding attempts were collected by mother report at
the hospital the second morning after the birth and from review of the nursing notes in
the mothers medical chart after the mothers discharge. mothers were considered to have
attempted breastfeeding if breastfeeding was indicated by either self report or nursing
notes. At 4 months postpartum, the mothers participated in an interview on feeding
practices. Mothers reported on whether they were currently breastfeeding and, if not,
when they had stopped breastfeeding
Secondary: mothers were also asked about whether they had started feeding their infants
cereal, either in the bottle or by spoon, or other solid foods, and reported the infant age

Methods
Parallel 2-arm RCT, single-site study, n = 298
Participants
Community health centres in Los Angeles County, USA
Participants: low-income, Hispanic women
Breastfeeding rates: local breastfeeding rates not reported but authors state that within
the Hispanic population the exclusive breastfeeding rate in hospital is 27.9% and at 1
week postpartum 33% of breastfeeding Hispanic women also give their babies formula
Inclusion criteria: women 26-34 weeks pregnant, Medicaid recipient, self-identified His-
panic, available via telephone, not assigned to a WIC peer counsellor, gave birth to a
healthy full-term singleton, absence of congenital abnormality, the infant was not ad-
mitted to a NICU
Exclusion criteria: participants whose babies had medical conditions that could signifi-
cantly interfere with breastfeeding. The researchers also avoided recruiting participants
from health clinics located near WIC sites that offered peer support
Interventions
Intervention (n = 146): WIC Supplemental Nutrition Programmes. The standard WIC
programmes provide monthly food vouchers, nutrition education and breastfeeding sup-
port to women, infants and children aged ≤ 5 years. Breastfeeding support includes
breastfeeding classes, access to a free breastfeeding helpline, breast pumps and LC ser-

vice. Some programmes also offered breastfeeding and support and education using peer
counsellors. The intervention group received additional support from LCs who were un-
dergraduate students who had completed a semester-long lactation education course and
10 h of postcourse training. The lactation education course included content knowledge
on the normal breastfeeding process and cultural sensitivity training. The intervention
entailed 4 prenatal and 17 postpartum phone calls (first call initiated when mothers were
in the third trimester of pregnancy and the last call when mother was 6 months post-
partum. The intervention participants were also provided with the lactation educator’s
phone number so they could contact her more frequently if need be. On occasion, text
messages were used to implement phone contacts with participants

Methods
Longitudinal study, 2-arm cluster-randomised trial, 10 Swedish municipalities random-
ized n=540
Participants
Setting: Antenatal Centres and Child Health Centres in 10 municipalities in southwest
Sweden
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: high
Inclusion criteria: Swedish-speaking mothers who gave birth to singleton, healthy, term
infants spontaneously, by vacuum extraction or by caesarean section
Participant characteristics: mean age approximately 27 years, married 61%-69%, vaginal
delivery 70%-75%, university educated 36%
Interventions
Intervention: the intervention included continuity of care at the antenatal and child
centres, and a process-oriented training program of 7 sessions for health professionals.
The staff training included reflection on personal experience of breastfeeding and breast-
feeding counselling, management and promotion. Staff were encouraged to develop a
common breastfeeding policy between the antenatal and child health centres. The family
classes were also kept together before and after childbirth
Control: offered standard family classes, usually discontinued at birth
Outcomes
Maternal perceptions of the relationship with the infant, maternal feelings for the infant
and duration of exclusive/any breastfeeding
Notes
10 centres randomized. A total of 540 women took part in the study (intervention group
206 women; 2 control groups 162 + 172 = 334 women). Data collection took place at
different times for the 2 control groups. We have included data from 378 women; the
intervention group (206 women) and 1 control group (172 women), from whom data
were collected at the same time as from the intervention group

Participants
NSW, Australia, primary care setting of general practice in rural agricultural settings.
Maternity hospitals were not Baby Friendly accredited, although at each hospital an In-
ternational Board Certified LC and registered midwives encouraged mothers to breast-
feed
35.3% of infants were currently fed solids at 4 months, while 52.9% had received solids,
infant formula or other nonhuman milk, at least once, by 4 months
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation:92%
Inclusion criteria: all pregnant women who had registered to give birth at 1 of the 3
local hospitals (n = 3127) over 14 months, had reached 24-36 weeks of pregnancy, who
planned to have their postnatal care at a participating general practice and who were still
breastfeeding at8 weeks were randomised
Exclusion criteria: not reported
Interventions
Intervention (n = 154): a structured conversation to support continuation of breastfeed-
ing following a Conversation Tool flowchart that used a motivational interviewing ap-
proach. The Conversation Tool was used with each breastfeeding mother who attended
a general practice intervention site for her infant to be immunised at 2, 4 or 6 months.
Mothers were informed of the recommendation for breastfeeding exclusively to 6 months
and maintenance to 1-2 years and asked ‘How would that work for you?’ According to
the mother’s response, the practice nurse provided a targeted proactive conversational
action
Intervention practice nurses attended 2 x 5-h training workshops that were delivered by
a team of a midwife/LC/trainer and a family doctor/breastfeeding counsellor and based

physiological. In addition, training addressed motivational interviewing and reflective
practice. Information about local government and community breastfeeding support
services, and handout literature for mothers, were provided

Methods
2-arm RCT, with individual randomisation n=120
Participants
Setting not clear: women expecting to give birth in an urban maternity unit, Canada.
120 women recruited in late pregnancy.
Interventions
Intervention: in addition to usual care, prenatal breastfeeding class and postnatal drop-
in breastfeeding session. Telephone follow-up by nurse at 2, 6 and 12 weeks postpartum.
Control: usual care in hospital with assistance from nurses who had received breastfeeding
education
Outcomes
Exclusive breastfeeding at 1 and 3 months and any breastfeeding at 3 and 6 months
Notes
We have not included data from this study in the review due to high levels of attrition
(> 25% loss to follow-up). Recruitment to the study took place during pregnancy and
by 1 month postpartum there was high loss to follow-up and loss was not balanced
across groups. At 1 month 42% of controls and 22% of the intervention group were not
available for follow-up. The high level and unbalanced attrition means that results from
this study were difficult to interpret

Gross 1998
Methods
Cluster-randomised trial. 4 clinics were ’randomly assigned’ to 4 different interventions
n=548
Participants
Setting: 4 WIC clinics in Baltimore USA
Women were predominantly African American (> 90%)
548 women attending study clinics enrolled at between 6 and 24 weeks’ gestation.
Women were WIC eligible with singleton pregnancies, planning to keep the baby and
to stay in study areas
Interventions
The study was carried out in 4 clinics. Each clinic offered a different intervention
Clinic 1: standard care (usual breastfeeding promotion by clinic staff)
Clinic 2: standard care plus a motivational video (encouraging breastfeeding) that was
played repeatedly in the clinic waiting area
Clinic 3: peer support by a mother who had breastfed and undertaken training. Peer
supporters contacted pregnant women and discussed breastfeeding. Women were offered
a 1-h group breastfeeding support session in the WIC clinic before the birth. After the
birth, peer counsellors contacted women and remained in contact with breastfeeding
women (phone or visits) until 16 weeks after the birth
Clinic 4: standard care plus video plus peer support
Outcomes
Infant feeding method at 8 weeks and 16 weeks postpartum and maternal work status
Notes
We were not able to include data from this study in the review due to very high levels of
attrition. The study was at a high risk of bias. This was a cluster trial with 4 clinics each
allocated to a different intervention and with no adjustment for study design effect
Women were recruited in the antenatal period. 548 women enrolled but information was
only available for 273 women at 7-10 days postpartum (50%); of the 275 women lost to
follow-up 31% (74) were excluded due to pregnancy complications, the remaining 73%
(201 women) refused or could not be contacted - these women represented 37% of the
original randomized sample. It was not clear whether loss was similar in the 4 clinics

Hall 1978
Methods
3-arm RCT n=49
Participants
49 women giving birth in a small community hospital in the USA planning to breastfeed
for at least 6 weeks and breastfeeding for the first time. All women had healthy babies.
Women were described as married and middle class aged 17-31 years
Interventions
3 groups:
Intervention 1: 15 randomized, 13 followed up (not clear): usual care plus an educational
session
Intervention 2: 16 randomized, 15 followed up (not clear): usual care plus education
plus daily visits by nurse while in hospital and telephone support 2 days after discharge
and 1 week later and further support if necessary (up to 5 weeks postpartum)
Control: 18 randomized, 12 followed up (not clear)
Outcomes
Outcomes were unclear, but included breastfeeding at 6 weeks and breastfeeding prob-
lems
Notes
We have not included data from this study in the review due to methodological weakness
and high and unbalanced levels of attrition. More than 30% of the control group were
lost to follow-up and results were therefore difficult to interpret. Most results were not
reported according to randomisation group and the only result for breastfeeding duration
was approximate, stating: “Approximately 50% of the control group and 50% of the
group which received the teaching unit were still nursing at 6 weeks. Of the group who
received the teaching plus support 80% were still nursing at 6 weeks.”

Methods
2-arm cluster-RCT, whole population in 132 wards (clusters)
Participants
Setting: rural Tanzania. Most residents were subsistence farmers living in small settle-
ments (subvillages) and 90% lived within 5 km of primary facilities
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: not stated
Inclusion criteria: households in intervention and comparison wards with live births. If
the village had fewer than 130 households, all households in the village were included
Exclusion criteria: If the village had greater than 130 households, segmentation was used
to limit the sample to a maximum of 131 households
Interventions
Intervention: home-based counselling - this strategy, branded Mtunze Mtoto Mchanga,
which means ”protect your newborn baby“ in Swahili, was developed in 2008-2009.
The strategy was designed in consultation with the Ministry of Health and members
of the WHO, UNICEF, and professional organisations. Key counselling messages were
selected on the basis of the frequency of the behaviour in 2007 the feasibility of change,
and the likely impact on survival on the basis of evidence published at the time. They
included hygiene during childbirth, early and exclusive breastfeeding, and extra care for
low-birthweight babies, including skin-to-skin care
Control: usual practice
Outcomes
Primary: all-cause neonatal mortality rate, per 1000 live births, defined as the proportion
of all live births who died in the first 28 days of life
Secondary:
Breastfeeding within an hour of delivery;
Soap or use of gloves for those attending home deliveries;
Exclusive breastfeeding for 3 days after birth;
Skilled attendance at birth;
Birth preparedness;
Immediate drying and covering of the baby;
Clean cord care;
Delayed bathing;
Identification and extra care for small babies, including skin-to-skin care for small babies
and referral to hospital for very small babies

Exclusion criteria: not stated
In intervention localities 25.2% of the populations were in the most deprived social
groups, compared with 32.1% in the control localities. Mean age of mothers at the first
child health record was 28-29 years. In 7 areas (3 intervention, 4 control) women gave
birth at Baby-Friendly hospitals
Interventions
Intervention: a policy intervention aimed at locality areas rather than at individual
women. The policy aimed to double the number of local breastfeeding support groups
and to make weekly support groups open to all pregnant women and breastfeeding
mothers. These local breastfeeding support groups were facilitated by health profession-
als taking a woman-centred approach and aiming to provide breastfeeding support and
social interaction for women.
Control: control localities received no additional intervention; however, breastfeeding
support groups existed in some control areas
Outcomes
Primary: number of babies receiving any breast milk at 6-8 weeks, as reported in routinely
collected data for the 2 pretrial years and 2 trial years
Secondary: any breastfeeding at birth, 5-7 days and 8-9 months, and maternal satisfaction
Results were not presented in a way which allowed us to enter them into data and analysis
tables, but we have summarised findings in the text
Notes
When we updated our search in October 2011, Hoddinott 2009 was the only evaluation
we found: a) of a policy-level intervention; b) of breastfeeding in groups; and c) that
used routinely collected locality-level outcome data

Methods
2-arn RCT, single-site study, n = 69
Participants
Setting: a maternity unit serving a mixed urban and rural population in Scotland
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: at hospital discharge, 54% of babies were
exclusively breastfed and 6% were receiving breast and formula milk. In the most disad-
vantaged areas, 39% exclusively breastfed compared with 63% in the most advantaged
areas
Inclusion criteria: women admitted to the ward between 26 July-18 October 2010 who
lived in the 3 most disadvantaged postcode area quintiles for the Scottish Index of
Multiple Deprivation (SIMD 1-3) in 2009 and who were breastfeeding
Exclusion criteria: women aged < 16 years with serious medical or psychiatric problems
or with insufficient spoken English to communicate by telephone
Interventions
Intervention (n = 35): proactive telephone calls (intervention) daily for 1 week following
hospital discharge. Calls were terminated at the woman’s request or if breastfeeding
ceased. At 1 week following discharge, women could choose to continue receiving daily
calls for a further week, change the frequency of calls, or have no further calls. Women
could telephone the feeding team at any point over the 2 weeks following discharge.
Text and answer phone messaging was available. All proactive calls stopped 14 days after
hospital discharge
Control (n = 34): reactive telephone calls; women could telephone the feeding team at
any point over the 2 weeks following discharge. Text and answer-phone messaging was

Methods
2-arm RCT, single site, n = 540
Participants
Black and Latina women who had delivered at a large tertiary hospital located in New
York City, USA
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: not stated
Inclusion criteria: participants were black/African American or Latina/Hispanic, spoke
English or Spanish, had a working telephone, ≥ 18 years old, and had infants with
birthweights > 2500 g and 5-min Apgar scores > 7
Exclusion criteria: not specified
Interventions
Intervention (n = 270): The intervention used a behavioural educational approach and
aimed to prepare and educate mothers about postpartum symptoms and experiences
provide social support, and develop self management skills. The intervention was de-
livered in two parts. The first part was delivered whilst the women was in hospital by
a social worker who reviewed an education pamphlet and partner summary sheet with
each mother. Education materials provided information about post-partum care and
included information on breastfeeding and breast/nipple pain.. Additional information
was provided on social support. The second part was a 2-week postdelivery call, where
the social worker assessed patients’ symptoms, skills in symptom management, and other
needs. Patients and the social worker created action plans to address current needs that
included assessment of community resources
Control: enhanced usual care; participants received a list of community resources and
received a 2-week control call

Methods
2-arm RCT, single centre, single blind, recruitment 2005-2006 n=182
Participants
Setting: maternity unit in Northern Ireland with Baby-Friendly accreditation
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: intermediate, one-fifth of women were
reported to have stopped breastfeeding before hospital discharge
Participants randomized n = 182
Inclusion criteria: primigravid women who attended for antenatal care when 20 weeks
pregnant, intended to give birth at the study hospital and consented to participate
Exclusion criteria: women < 20 years old who had commenced the ‘young mums’ par-
entcraft programme prior to the 20-week visit. Vulnerable women, e.g. women who

Age 31-40 years: 53/144 (37%)
Socioeconomic status: 38 (26%) professionals; 20 (14%) not working
Interventions
All study participants received standard care at the study hospital, this met Baby-Friendly
standards and complied with National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guide-
lines
Intervention: staff training; women (n = 93) received a ’motivationally enhanced’ version
of control group care from staff who had been trained in a programme called ‘Designer
Breastfeeding’
Control (n = 89): women received a 2-h antenatal infant feeding class, a breastfeeding
book and midwife support for the first 3 postnatal weeks
Outcomes
Primary: women’s motivational profile was measured, using 7-point Likert scales, in
relation to 3 motivational factors: total value placed on breastfeeding, perceived midwife
support, and expectancy for successful breastfeeding
Secondary: breastfeedingbehaviourondischarge fromhospital andat3weekspostnatally.
Breastfeeding initiation was defined according to the Department of Health as giving 1
breastfeedor1episode of expressedbreastmilk. Durationof breastfeedingwascategorised
in accordance with the Index of Breastfeeding Status, which classifies breastfeeding on a
scale in accordance with the amount of breast milk the infant receives
Notes
Only 53/89 women randomized to the control group were known to have initiated
breastfeeding. In the intervention group 57/93 women randomized initiated breastfeed-

Methods
2-arm cluster-controlled trial, n = 1267
Participants
Primary Care Trust health district (PCT) in Birmingham, UK
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: 58%, with continuation rates poorly col-
lected, but considered to be lower than national average
Inclusion criteria: all pregnant women registered with a GP within the PCT, with an
estimated delivery date between 1 February 2007-31 July 2007
Exclusion criteria: none stated
Interventions
Intervention (n = 1267): antenatal peer support offered to all women in intervention
clusters to encourage breastfeeding initiation, and postnatal peer support for women who
initiated breastfeeding to increase continuation. Community peer support workers were
employed and trained by the breastfeeding personnel in the PCT in line with WHO/
UNICEF Baby Friendly breastfeeding management course. Antenatal support was aimed
to be 2 support sessions (at least 1 at home, although almost all actually took place in the
clinic/Children’s Centre setting). The support workers were informed when the women
were discharged from hospital so that they could contact and visit them within 24 h-48
h. Further contact would be needs-based, but with a minimum of 1 more contact in the
first week. Additional needs-based contacts could be by telephone or home visits
Number randomized = 1267 (416 consented to follow-up at 6 months, and 271 of these
responded at 6 months)
Control (n = 1370): routine maternity care.
Number randomized = 1370 (432 consented to follow-up at 6 months, 301 responded

Outcomes
Any breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding at 10-14 days, 6 weeks and 6 months and

Notes
The numbers randomized in this paper do match the MacArthur paper which states:
Intervention: n = 1140 deliveries
Women with data on initiation of breastfeeding n = 1083
Women who initiated breastfeeding n = 747

Methods
2-arm RCT, recruited August 2008-April 2009, n = 140
Participants
Recruitment from postnatal wards of 2 hospitals in South Jordan
Prevalence of ’ever breastfed’ in country: 93% (WHO Global Data Bank on Breastfeed-
ing, accessed 12 Oct 2011). Paper stated that traditionally most women initiate breast-
feeding and breastfeed for up to 2 years, with 32% fully breastfeeding for > 6 months
Inclusion criteria: primiparous women following vaginal delivery with term infants
Exclusion criteria: women who lived outside the study area or who could not be contacted
by phone
Interventions
Intervention: women received a 1-h education session approximately 2 h after the birth.
The session included demonstrations of breastfeeding. Mothers were encouraged to ask
questions and were given a pamphlet on breastfeeding. At 2 and 4 months postpartum
women were contacted by phone by the same researcher/nurse. The purpose of calls was
to offer support, monitor breastfeeding practices and identify any problems
Control: usual care; women were given an appointment for 6 weeks after discharge to
attend the maternal and child health services for support and follow-up. Paper states
most women did not return for these appointments and were not receiving any postnatal
care. Control group women did not receive postnatal home visits from a midwife or a
child health nurse
Outcomes
Primary: exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months and breastfeeding knowledge
Secondary: infant hospital admissions for diarrhoea and vomiting or respiratory tract
infections

Participant characteristics: 36% primiparous, 7.5% multiparous with previous short
breastfeeding experience
Interventions
Usual care included hospital care at hospitals working to Baby-Friendly standards, and
an existing Health Visitor service in all municipalities
Intervention cluster: 1-3 structured home visits within the first 5 postnatal weeks from
Health Visitors with additional training. Main topics for the first visit were effective
breastfeeding technique and learning to know the baby; for the second visit, self-regulated
feeding and interpretation of the baby’s cues; for the third visit, sufficient milk and
interaction with the baby. Mothers were also given a booklet about how to breastfeed
and how to read the baby’s cues
Control cluster: Health Visitors’ usual practice consisting of 1 or more non-standardised
visits
Outcomes
Duration of exclusive breastfeeding and mother’s satisfaction with breastfeeding
Notes
The authors did not adjust for cluster design effect. In our data and analysis tables we
have adjusted the sample size and event rates to take account of the design effect. We
calculated an effective sample size by dividing figures by the design effect - calculated
using the ICC for breastfeeding cessation given in the paper: ICC = 0.02

Participants
Setting: the maternity section at the Chambery Teaching hospital in Chambery, France
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: intermediate. Breastfeeding prevalence rates
were 70.8% in hospital and 58.1% at 1 month of infant age
Inclusion criteria: mothers of healthy singleton infants (gestational age: > 37 completed
weeks), breastfeeding on the day of discharge and consenting to participate in the study
Exclusion criteria: infants admitted to neonatal unit, mothers transferred to ICU, moth-
ers < 18 years old, living outside the area, unable to speak French, or unable to complete
follow-up monitoring because of psychosocial problems such as homelessness
Participant characteristics:
Age: mean (SD): intervention: 29.3 years (4.1); control: 29.7 years (4.8)
Education beyond high school graduate level: intervention: 87 (75.0); control 84 (73.0)
White collar worker: intervention: 92 (79.3); control 87 (75.6)
Primiparous: intervention: 58 (50.0); control: 63 (54.8)
Interventions
Intervention (n = 116): in addition to standard care, mothers were invited to an out-
patient visit in a primary care physician’s office within 2 weeks of the birth to see a
primary care doctor who had received special breastfeeding education. Topics covered
included general health assessment, lactation physiology, feeding position and latch on
assessment, management of common lactation problems (nipple pain, nipple cracks,
sore nipples, mastitis, and maternal concern regarding low milk supply), management
of infant problems (insufficient weight gain, breastfeeding jaundice, diarrhoea and de-
hydration), maternal medication use while breastfeeding and sources of support. The
physicians’ training programme was delivered through lectures, panel discussions, role
playing exercises and printed educational materials

Control (n = 115): standard care; mothers received verbal encouragement from maternity
ward staff to maintain breastfeeding. On discharge, the infant was examined by the pae-
diatrician working in the department, for a general health assessment and an evaluation
for evidence of successful breastfeeding behaviour. The mothers were also provided with
the telephone number of a peer support group that they could call to ask questions and
request help. The postdischarge follow-up monitoring consisted of routine, preventive,
outpatient visits in a primary care physician’s office at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months of infant
age
Outcomes
Primary: exclusive breastfeeding at 4 weeks (exclusive breastfeeding defined as giving
maternal milk as the only food source, with no other liquids or foods)

Laliberte 2016
Methods
2-arm, RCT, single site, n = 472
Participants
Ottawa, Canada
Background breastfeeding rates: not stated
Inclusion criteria: women ≥ 18 years, with no diagnosed medical problems, with a
healthy singleton infant at a gestational age of over 36 weeks and 6 days who were breast-
feeding their baby and intended to continue upon discharge, and could be contacted by
phone or email after hospital discharge
Exclusion criteria: women who did not speak English or French, were unable to present
to the clinic (transport not available), with multiple, preterm or adopted babies, with
no plan or desire to breastfeed, women who had had breast surgery or a psychological
risk that might impede their ability to attend the first appointment at the clinic. Out-
of-province women were also excluded given the geographic distance and difference in
social services
Interventions
Intervention (n = 315): within 48 h of discharge, women attended the postpartum clinic.
Clinic staff followed up with participants if they failed to keep the mandatory follow-up
appointment. The first appointment included maternal assessment and care (e.g. wound
care, prescriptions),neonatal care (e.g.weightgainassessment, jaundice screening), blood
work including total serum bilirubin (TSB), and breastfeeding assessment and support.
Family physicians were available for on-site consultations in the mornings, and LCs and
registered nurses were at the clinic throughout the day. Additional follow-up visits were
offered to participants as clinically indicated and as many times as they desired up to a
maximum of 6 weeks following the birth of their baby
Control (n= 157): after hospital discharge, participants were entitled to receive follow-up
care and seek breastfeeding support currently available in the community (e.g. through
their family doctor, Public Health Unit or private services), but could not attend the
postpartum clinic
Outcomes
Primary: exclusive breastfeeding at 12 weeks postbirth (additional breastfeeding infor-
mation regarding partial breastfeeding, expressed breast milk and formula feeding was
also collected)
Secondary:
Mother Satisfaction Survey
Breastfeeding self-efficacy
Postpartum depression
Use of healthcare resources

Notes
This is the only study in this review that targeted babies with birthweight below 3000
g. We considered excluding it from this review as the paper did not state the babies had
to be born at term and did not specify a lower limit for birthweight. However as the
babies had to be ’free of important health problems’ we considered them to be healthy
and therefore included this study

Methods
Parallel 2-arm RCT, single site, n = 770
Participants
Maternity ward at the Sotero del Rio Hospital, Santiago, Chile. Programme delivered
by South East Metropolitan Health Service in conjunction with the Catholic University
of Chile
Background breastfeeding initiation rates: on this ward 79.4% of the live births were
fed with exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) up to 1 month of age and 67.3% were fed in this
manner until 3 months of age. This was similar to national figures
Inclusion criteria: pregnancy without illness or risk factors which required more intensive
maternal and/or perinatal monitoring during the process of labour and delivery, spon-

taneous initiation of labour , gestational age between 37 + 0 and 41 + 0 weeks, single
pregnancy, live fetus and cephalic presentation
Exclusion criteria: women with illnesses or risk factors that required more intensive
maternal and/or perinatal monitoring
Interventions
Intervention (n = 384): ’comprehensive care’ consisting of family member who accom-
panied the woman from admission to discharge, 24 h/day, and who participated actively
throughout the period. Labour took place in a comprehensive room with constant care,
with early skin-to-skin contact of at least 1 h and encouragement of early initiation of
breastfeeding (positive covariates for EBF). During the immediate postpartum period
personalised educational support was delivered by the healthcare team. Early discharge
with comprehensive intervention (after 24 h) was complemented by a home visit (after
48 h) where the mother’s and baby’s care was reinforced, as well as the breastfeeding
technique in a family setting
Control (n = 386): ’traditional care’, i.e. standard care from the public health system.
This involved labour management interventions (negative covariates for EBF) with in-
termittent and passive family participation. Early skin-to-skin contact was performed
without any standardised guidelines and mother and child room-sharing began once the
newborn had received immediate care. During the postpartum period, professional and
technical support was given for the start of breastfeeding in the postnatal unit

Methods
3-arm cluster-controlled trial, single site, n = 9675
Participants
Local government authorities (LGA) in Victoria, Australia - community-based maternal
and child health centres
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: only rates at 6 months detailed. Ranged
from 32% to 68% in different LGAs in Victoria
Inclusion criteria: LGAs in Victoria with a lower rate of any breastfeeding at discharge
from hospital than the Victorian state average; and > 450 births per year. For the postal
survey women were recruited on the basis of giving birth during the intervention time-
frame in all participating LGAs
Exclusion criteria: LGAs with breastfeeding initiatives in place similar to the proposed
interventions. Women living in participating LGAs were not sent an invitation to take
part in th postal survey if it was known that either they or the infant died, they had
moved to another LGA since the birth or they were not enrolled in the Maternal and
Child Health Service
Interventions
Intervention 1 (n = 3335): home visiting only (HV) - early home-based visiting by a
maternal and child health nurse (MCHN) to women identified at risk of breastfeeding
cessation. Aimed to provide proactive breastfeeding assistance as early as possible after
birth. The focus of the visits were was the normalisation of breastfeeding, building
women’s confidence to breastfeed, reassurance, development of an infant feeding plan
(where needed), and provision of a list of useful web sites and telephone numbers. The
topics covered at individual visits were driven by the specific needs of the woman
Intervention 2 (n = 2891): HV + access to a drop-in centre - women received home visit
service as above and could attend local community breastfeeding drop-in centre staffed
by a MCHN, and where possible with a trained peer supporter or community educator
or counsellor. Also provided mothers with the opportunity to meet and learn from other
mothers. The centre was widely advertised
Control (n=3449): Usual care. Midwife visit 1-2 days after discharge and then MCHN
visit 10-12 days after discharge (breastfeeding assessment, support and advice a core
component of care). Then MCH centre based care thereafter

Participants
20 municipalities in the Netherlands, demographics not described
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: not described
Inclusion criteria: ≤ 25 years, low educational level (primary school or prevocational
secondary school), maximum 28 weeks of gestation, no previous live birth, understood
Dutch, and at least 1 of the following additional risk factors: no social support, previously
or currently experiencing domestic violence, psychosocial symptoms, unwanted and/
or unplanned pregnancy, financial problems, housing difficulties, no education and/or
employment and alcohol and/or drug use
Exclusion criteria: previous live births, no additional risk factor as detailed above
Interventions
Intervention (n = 237): the VoorZorg programme - a home visitation programme trans-
lated and culturally adapted from the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) programme. In
addition to usual care, women received approximately 10 home visits during pregnancy,
20 during the first life year of the child and 20 during the second by trained, specialised
VoorZorg nurses. 6 domains were discussed during the home visits: 1) the health sta-
tus of the mother, 2) the child’s health and safety, 3) the personal development of the
mother, 4) the role of the mother, 5) the mother’s relation with her partner, family and
friends, and 6) the use of (health) care organizations. During pregnancy, women receiv-
ing the VoorZorg intervention were encouraged to initiate and continue breastfeeding
after childbirth. The VoorZorg nurse also discussed the problems women encountered
when breastfeeding their child and worked together with the mother to seek solutions
to continue breastfeeding. The VoorZorg nurses also aimed to reduce smoking with the
V-MIS smoking cessation programme
Control (n = 223): usual care provided by the Dutch Youth Health Care Organizations.
Every pregnant women received care by a midwife including health education, physical
examination and monitoring fetal development. The baby was automatically registered at
an ambulatory well baby clinic for monitoring after birth and the parents were supported
in parenthood

Methods
2-arm RCT, with individual randomisation, n = 225
Participants
Setting: general practice in Ayrshire, Scotland
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: low
Inclusion criteria: women at 28 weeks’ gestation attending for antenatal care at a GP
practice
Exclusion criteria: not described
Participant characteristics:
Mean age of intervention group: 28.5 years; SD 5.2; range 17-43. Mean age of control
group: 27.8 years; SD 5.5; range 16-40
Parity: 53% primiparous
Interventions
Intervention (n = 112): women were assigned 2 peer supporters (women with previous
breastfeeding experience) who contacted them at least once in the antenatal period and
provided further antenatal support on request. In the postnatal period after hospital
discharge peer supporters contacted women who were still breastfeeding at least every 2
days by phone or by home visit up until 28 days, and further support was available up

Planned recruitment was for 320 women
but ended after 225 women recruited,
therefore the study had reduced power to
detect differences between groups
Few demographic data were reported so it
was not clear whether or not there was base-
line imbalance, although recruitment was
balanced for parity by stratification
Ochola 2013
Methods
3-arm cluster-controlled trial, single-site study, n = 360 (note only 2 arms included in
analysis)
Participants
Kiberia slum, Nairobi, Kenya - a densely populated area that was not well served with
basic services such as health facilities, adequate safe water and sanitation services
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: no data on initiation, but for Kenya the
exclusive breastfeeding rate for infants under 6 months was 32.0%
Inclusion criteria: in the third trimester of pregnancy (34-36 weeks’ gestation), HIV-
negative, intention to stay in Kibera for at least 6 months after delivery, willing to be
visited at home, willing to be included in the study
Exclusion criteria: documented chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, renal disease,
heart disease or any other chronic disease, and eclampsia in a previous pregnancy
Interventions
Intervention 1 (n = 120): home-based intensive counselling group (HBICG); mothers
received 7 counselling sessions: prenatally, the first week after delivery and then monthly
up to 5 months postpartum. The content was similar to the facility-based semi-in-
tensive counselling group (FBSICG; see Intervention 2) but was more tailored to the
mother’s needs and more detailed. Women also had more practical exposure with regard
to supporting breastfeeding (e.g. positioning, attachment, expression of milk). Counsel-
lor training was the same as for FBSICG
Intervention 2 (n = 120): FBSICG; note this intervention was an antenatal one only,
so not included in this review). Consisted of 1 session of 1-to-1 counselling at the
health centre conducted by the investigator and breastfeeding counsellors. The breast-
feeding counsellors were 3 local women trained in accordance with the WHO/UNICEF
counselling course (40 h). The counselling content was structured around the benefits
of exclusive breastfeeding; preparation for breastfeeding initiation and sustainability of
breastfeeding; positioning and attachment of baby to the breast during feeding; and
prevention and management of breastfeeding challenges. The single session took place
after enrolment into the study.
Control (n = 120): usual standard health and nutrition education offered at the health
centre. This was a group-based education programme which covered breastfeeding and
a range of other topics

Methods
2-arm RCT, n = 1154
Participants
Pennsylvania, USA
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: no details provided
Inclusion criteria: singletons and twins born after at least 34 weeks’ gestation to English-
speaking mothers attempting to breastfeed during the maternity stay and with intent to
continue breastfeeding after discharge
Exclusion criteria: atypical stays characterised by: 1) a 2-night or longer stay after a vagi-
nal delivery; 2) a 4-night stay or longer after a cesarean section; 3) a hospital course
with atypical complications (e.g. ambiguous genitalia, endometritis); or 4) newborn hy-
perbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy during the nursery stay. Mothers were also ex-
cluded for major morbidities and/or pre-existing conditions that would affect postpar-
tum care, lack of a telephone number, previous study participation, residence outside
the coverage region of the Visiting Nurse Association of Central Pennsylvania (VNA),
or if a home nursing visit was specifically requested by a hospital social worker or child
protective services owing to social concerns
Interventions
Intervention (n = 576): 1 home nursing visit within 48 h of hospital discharge (typically
3-5 days post birth). All nurses received continuing education related to breastfeeding
support and cultural competency prior to study initiation. All newborns in intervention
group were scheduled for an office-based visit 1 week after the visit to assess weight and
recovery
Control (n = 578): office-base care; postdischarge visit timing for newborns was deter-
mined by the newborn nursery physician
Outcomes
Primary: maternal and infant use of unplanned health care services in the 14 days after
delivery
Secondary:
Breastfeeding duration and exclusivity
Maternal postpartum depression

Inclusion criteria: WIC program-qualified pregnant women in the third trimester of a
singleton pregnancy without HIV, cancer, or illegal drug use
Participant characteristics: 87.5% of the women were of Hispanic origin, 89% spoke
Spanish at home, 30% were single, approximately 70% were educated to less than high
school level. 37% of the intervention group, compared with 42% of controls, were
expecting their first child
Interventions
Intervention (n = 52): in addition to routine care, allocated to 2 individual educational/
support sessions with a LC in the third trimester of pregnancy lasting 15-20 min. After
birth the LC provided support at the hospital or by phone soon after discharge, with
further phone support after the first or second week then after 1 and 2 months. The
participants were asked to contact the LC if they experienced any breastfeeding problems
Control (n = 52): routine breastfeeding education and support during the pregnancy and
postpartum. LC services were available for all postpartum women if any breastfeeding
problems arose during the hospital stay
Outcomes
Exclusive and any breastfeeding at 7 days and 1, 2 and 3 months postpartum

Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: intermediate
Inclusion criteria: women who experienced vaginal deliveries after full-term pregnancies
Exclusion criteria: not stated
Participant characteristics: mean age: 24.4 years; married n = 47 (78%); white n = 55
(93%); completed high school n = 58 (97%); income of USD ≤ 20,000 n = 13 (22%)
Interventions
Standard care included routine breastfeeding support in hospital following delivery
Intervention: 2 home visits by a professional community health nurse and phone call
from a qualified LC. The nurse provided a structured teaching and support protocol.
The focus of the first visit was to enhance breastfeeding. For the second visit, of up to 2
h duration, mothers could choose the content from options including help with dishes
or laundry. Most chose education or infant assessment; 2 asked for child care help so
they could rest and/or spend time with a partner
Control: home visit on day 3 or 4 by a hospital nurse (not specifically about breastfeeding)

Participants
Setting: 2 hospitals (1 university and 1 community hospital) serving urban areas in
Baltimore, Maryland, USA
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: intermediate
Inclusion criteria: mother English-speaking, with phone access and living within 25 miles
of the hospital, intending to breastfeed, family eligible for WIC program, singleton term
infant (> 37 weeks’ gestation)
Exclusion criteria: infants or mothers with positive drug screen, infants with craniofacial
abnormalities, infants admitted to NICU
Participant characteristics: all enrolled in WIC program; mean age 23.1 years; 87%
African Americans; 26.5% with less than high school education; 79.6% single; 17.4%
not employed or in school; 26.6% caesarean births; 50.6% first time mothers; 32.3%
with previous breastfeeding experience
Interventions
Intervention (n = 168): in addition to usual care, a structured programme of education
and support comprising postnatal visits by a breastfeeding team (community nurse and
peer counsellor) daily in hospital, 2 home visits in the first week after discharge, a third
visit at approximately 4 weeks, then scheduled phone calls by the peer counsellor at least
fortnightly until 24 weeks and phone access to the community nurse (24 h) for 24 weeks.
Home visits lasted approximately 45-60 min and the average length of phone calls was
approximately 20 min
Control (n = 160): usual care included access to a LC in hospital and phone access after
discharge home
Outcomes
Any breastfeeding (breastfed at least once during the previous 24 h) at 6, 12, and 24
weeks postpartum
Notes
Baseline variables were measured using established valid instruments and were used as
covariates to adjust for differences between randomisation groups in some of the analyses
in the paper. In our analyses we have reported unadjusted figures

Redman 1995
Methods
2-arm RCT n=235
Participants
Setting: 235 eligible and consenting women booked for delivery at an Australian hospital
in 1989
Inclusion criteria: primiparous women who expressed a wish to breastfeed, who booked
for delivery before 20 weeks’ gestation, aged between 18-35 years and lived within 20
km of the hospital
Exclusion criteria: women who received additional care from independent midwives
Interventions
Intervention: programme of care based on health belief model and cognitive-behavioural
principles, including a 3-h group teaching session in the antenatal period and a visit by
a LC shortly after hospital birth, phone support 2-3 weeks later and at 3 months, with a
home visit if needed. The LC was available to provide telephone support at other times
Control: usual breastfeeding care and advice along with routine antenatal classes
Outcomes
Breastfeeding at 6 weeks and 4 months postdelivery, reasons for stopping breastfeeding,
satisfaction with the intervention
Notes
We have not included data from this study in the review due to very high attrition rates
which meant results were difficult to interpret. In this study women were recruited in
the antenatal period. 235 women were randomized; 30% were lost to follow-up by 6
weeks postpartum (and full interview data were available for only 56% of the sample).

Sikander 2015
Methods
2-arm cluster-RCT, n = 452
Participants
Union Councils in a rural, resource-poor district in the northwest province of Pakistan
with high infant mortality
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: Pakistan has 8% exclusive breastfeeding
before 6 months
inclusion criteria: women aged 17-40 years, married, in their third trimester of pregnancy,
and intending to reside in the study area for the duration of the study
Exclusion criteria: women with diagnosed serious medical/psychiatric condition requir-
ingtreatment, pregnancy-relatedillness(exceptforcommonconditions, such asanaemia)
, and substantial physical/learning disability
Interventions
Intervention (n = 224): 7 psycho-educational sessions integrated into the routine work of
lady health workers (LHWs) and delivered to all women in their Union Council catch-
ment areas. First session delivered before birth, second session immediately after birth,
and the remaining 5 sessions monthly thereafter. The intervention had 6 components:
developing an empathic relationship: a trusting, safe, alliance with the mother and other
family members; collaborating with the family in an equal partnership; using guided
discovery: a style of engagement to gently probe for the individual and family’s health
beliefs, and also to stimulate alternative ideas; putting knowledge into practice and be-
havioural activation; and problem solving. LHWs underwent 2-day (12 h) training in
simplified cognitive behavioural therapy principles using participatory approaches
Control (n = 228): women received an equal number of visits in exactly the same way as
those in the intervention arm, but by routinely trained LHWs

Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: not stated
Inclusion criteria: healthy primiparous women without breastfeeding problems, with a
healthy baby born at full term (37-41 weeks, birthweight > 2500 g) and who agreed to
be enrolled
Exclusion criteria: multiparous women, premature baby (born before the 37th week),
low birth weight baby (< 2500 g), admission to neonatal intensive care unit or transfer to
another hospital, medical condition which could permanently or temporarily counter-

Interventions
Intervention (n = 50): peer counselling WIC support programme; WIC definition of a
breastfeeding peer counsellor: a woman who breastfed her own infant(s) to 1 year with
exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months or was currently breastfeeding an infant following
recommended practice, who received 20 h training. Counsellor was resident in the local
area and received care herself from WPC. Antenatal: peer counsellor initiated contact
once during third trimester of pregnancy with additional contacts at mother’s request
(mostly by telephone). Postnatal: peer counsellor contact within 3-5 days of birth weekly
to 1 month, every 2 weeks up to 3 months, and once at 4 months, in person during
clinic visits or via telephone. No home visits for safety reasons
Control (n = 53): standard care (available to both intervention and control group),
included access in hospital to International Board Certified LCs and outpatient lactation
support from the clinic paediatricians and the WIC nutritionist. The in-office WIC site
had a peer helper available less than once a month

Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: not detailed
Inclusion criteria: primigravid women who intended to have their baby within the trust
and who attended the routine 20-week antenatal appointment during the recruitment
phase
Exclusion criteria: women who did not speak English (or had interpretation services
available), women who experienced infant-maternal separation and incidences of new-
born abnormalities that required additional infant feeding support, or teenagers who
had already attended a breastfeeding workshop
Interventions
Intervention (n = 93): motivationally-enhanced version of midwife instruction as a means
of increasing women’s expectancy for successful breastfeeding, compared to best practice.
The intervention had 4 components: antenatal feeding class (32-36 weeks’ gestation), a
breastfeeding information book (provided in the antenatal phase), a breastfeeding CD-
ROM, postnatal instructional support provided by midwives (up to 3 weeks postnatal)
and additional lactation consultancy on request. The postnatal midwives who supported
the intervention attended an additional 1-day training session that focused on the role of
human motivation and the use of effective strategies to increase participants’ expectancy
for success
Control (n = 89): local best practice

Methods
3-arm RCT, with individual randomisation, n = 450
Participants
National University Hospital, Singapore
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: high
Inclusion criteria: healthy pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at the study hos-
pital, with no illness that would contraindicate breastfeeding or severely compromise its
success; intending to breastfeed; birth at 34 weeks’ gestation or later
Exclusion criteria: women with high risk and multiple pregnancies
Participant characteristics:
40% primiparous, mixed ethnicity (Chinese 31%-44%, Malay 46%-54%, Indian and
other), approximately a third educated beyond secondary school, approximately half
employed outside the home, 56% had previously breastfed
Interventions
Intervention 1: antenatal education: in addition to routine care, women received 1 session
of antenatal breastfeeding education and printed guides on breastfeeding
Intervention 2: postnatal lactation support: in addition to routine care, women received
2 postnatal sessions with a LC, 1 in hospital within the first 3 postnatal days (when they
received the same printed guides on breastfeeding as the antenatal education group) and
1 during the first routine postnatal visit 1 to 2 weeks after the birth. Each session lasted
about 30 min and covered latching on, proper positioning and other techniques to avoid
common breastfeeding complications
Control: women received routine antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care, including
optional antenatal classes and postnatal visits by a LC should any problems with breast-
feeding arise
Outcomes
Exclusive and any breastfeeding at hospital discharge and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 and 6
months after the birth. Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as giving breast milk as the
only food source, with no other foods or liquids, other than vitamins and minerals being
given

subsequently required prolonged care in a Special Care Nursery
Interventions
Intervention (n = 179): lactation counselling given by certified LCs via telephone twice
monthlytoeach lactatingmother, inadditiontothe currentconventional care (asdescried
below). Each mother was expected to receive 12 lactation counselling sessions by the
end of the study. Contact was discontinued any time that a mother decided to stop
breastfeeding completely. Contact was also discontinued if the mother had given the
baby up for foster care and/or had no physical contact to enable her to breastfeed. LCs in
this study were registered nurses from the Maternity Hospital Kuala Lumpur who had
post-basic training in midwifery and were certified as LCs. All 12 LCs had undergone a
40-h lactation management and counselling course based on the WHO module
Control (n = 178): mothers received current conventional care for postnatal breastfeeding
promotion or support from thier own public healthcare provider. This conventional care
included breastfeeding talks during immunisation follow ups, a mothers’ communication
with the LCs through information or pamphlets received during antenatal or postnatal
follow-ups, and advice regarding breastfeeding received at any time from any healthcare
workers, the media, peer counsellors, family members or friends

Methods
One of the 3 country sites that completed this cluster-randomised trial - Burkino Faso in
French-speaking West Africa (24 clusters: 12 intervention, 12 control). Mother-infant
pairs enrolled: 392 intervention and 402 control (794 total). Followed up at 24 weeks:
359/392 (92%) intervention and 372/402 (93%) control
Participants
Rural area where main source of income was farming. 60 primary care facilities and a
regional hospital
Baseline prevalence of breastfeeding initiation: high (98.4%). Exclusive breastfeeding for
babies under 6 months estimated at 16%
Inclusion criteria: women living in trial area at least 7 months pregnant and intending
to breastfeed, singleton live birth, no serious congenital malformations
Exclusion criteria: mothers or infants who died were not included in the analysis
Participant characteristics:
Mean age of women 25 years. None of the women had any formal education and more
than half had had a previous child death. 99% of women had no toilet or an open toilet
and < 1% had piped water in yard or home. Monthly income was approximately EUR 3
Interventions
Intervention: peer counselling by supporters who received a modified version of WHO/
UNICEF training (1 week training). Women were given information about breastfeeding
and peers provided support and addressed problems or referred women for specialist
help. The intervention involved a minimum of 5 home visits, 1 in the third trimester
and at least 4 in the postnatal period up to 6 months postpartum. The supporters were
local residents, literate, able to travel to visit women in their homes and had a good
reputation in the community. Peer counsellors visited the same women each time to
achieve continuity of care. The intervention varied in the 3 study areas and was adapted
to local circumstances
Control: mothers and infants in control clusters in Burkina Faso were given standard
healthcare only
Outcomes
Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding and prevalence of diarrhoea, reported by mothers
for infants aged 12 weeks and 24 weeks
Notes
The paper reported that current breastfeeding was assessed at all scheduled postpartum
visits using past 24-h and 7-day recalls. Babies who were reported to have received no
other food or liquids than breast milk (they may have been administered drugs) were
classified as exclusively breastfed. This may have been during the last 24 h or 7 days
rather than since birth. Prevalence of diarrhoea was based on the mothers’ reports of the
past 2 weeks

Methods
2-arm RCT, with individual randomisation, n = 500
Participants
Setting: urban, a low-income area of the city of São Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
Recruitment from maternity wards of the city’s only publicly funded hospital, which
mainly serves the low-income population
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: high
Inclusion criteria: low-income mothers with healthy, singleton, full-term (> 37 week)
babies with birthweight > 2500 g
Exclusion criteria: impediments to breastfeeding, HIV/AIDS, or congenital malforma-
tion
Demographics: 57% male children; 60% of intervention and 52% of control mothers
had less than 8 years schooling; 73% of intervention and 67% of controls had low annual
incomes (< USD 3000); 34% of mothers were not in paid work; 70% of children were
living with mother and father; almost half of the mothers were overweight
Interventions
Both groups received routine assistance from paediatricians in the health service
Intervention (n = 200): dietary advice about breastfeeding and the adequate introduction
of complementary foods, given monthly for 6 months in home visits starting within
10 days of the child’s birth then at 8, 10, and 12 months by 12 trained field-workers
(undergraduate students in groups of 2) who counselled mothers on the Ten Steps for
Healthy Feeding Children from Birth to Two Years of Age (Brazilian Ministry of Health)
Control (n = 300): standard care (not described)
Outcomes
Exclusive breastfeedingat4and6months; anybreastfeedingat12months; alsodiarrhoea,
respiratory problems, dental caries, anaemia, hospitalisation and nutritional status at 12-
16 months
Notes
Although the paper called this intervention ’dietary counselling’, we have included it as
a breastfeeding support intervention because its main purpose was to promote exclusive
breastfeeding for 6 months followed by healthy complementary foods, and it involved
regular visits during the first year of life

planning to keep baby, able to read and speak English, with access to phone; at birth,
only mothers of singleton, term healthy babies were included

Sample characteristics: mean age 17 years (SD 0.9); 61% African American; 75% low-
income; 74% single and living with their families, and 71% were in school
Interventions
Intervention (n = 128): 2 antenatal classes (1.5-2 h) on benefits of breastfeeding and
practical issues run by the LC and the peer counsellor, followed up by phone calls. After
the birth, phone calls made to those who had initiated breastfeeding, at 4, 7, 11, 18 days
and 4 weeks to provide support
Control 1 (n = 128): the same contact schedule of classes and phone calls as the inter-
vention group, with content concentrating on more general pregnancy and health issues
Control 2 (n = 134): usual care with no special intervention
Outcomes
Data on breastfeeding were available for women who initiated breastfeeding - this meant
results were difficult to interpret
Notes
We have not included outcome data from this study in the review due to very high levels
of attrition. This was a study where women were recruited in the second trimester and
interventions took place both prenatally and postnatally. For postnatal outcomes only
those women who initiated breastfeeding were followed up. There was considerable loss
to follow-up. 390 were randomly assigned. Women who did not attend at least 1 of the
study classes were dropped from the study. Follow-up data on duration of breastfeeding
were available for 201 women who initiated breastfeeding (51%)

Methods
2-arm RCT, n = 667
Participants
The trial was conducted in socially and economically disadvantaged areas of Sydney,
Australia, during 2007-2010
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: no information provided
Inclusioncriteria: ≥16yearsold, expectingfirst child, betweenweeks24-34 of pregnancy,
able to communicate in English, and lived in the local area
Exclusion criteria: women were excluded from the study if they had severe medical
conditions as evaluated by their physicians
Interventions
Intervention (n = 337): 5 or 6 home visits from a specifically trained research nurse
delivering a staged home-based intervention in the antenatal period and at 1, 3, 5, 9 and
12 months. At each visit the research nurse spent 1 h-2 h with the mother and infant.
(The nurse addressed 4 key areas: infant feeding practices, infant nutrition and active
play, family physical activity and nutrition, as well as social support). The was delivered by
trained research nurses in accordance with a protocol (www.healthybeginnings.net.au/)
. Each visit involved standard information with key discussion points. and appropriate
resources to reinforce the information
Control (n = 330): received the usual childhood nursing service, comprising 1 home
visit within a month of birth if needed. Additional visits at baseline and 12 months were
conducted by a research assistant for the purpose of data collection only

and the 337 who were assessed and randomized before birth
(175 in the intervention group and 162 in the control group)
for any of the characteristics. Of the 268 participating moth-

received 5 home visits after giving birth and 35.3% received 6
home visits, including an antenatal visit
Wilhelm 2015
Methods
2-arm RCT, n = 53
Participants
Mexican-American women (American women of Mexican ethnicity/ancestry) residing
in rural western Nebraska in the central USA
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: initiation 80% in Hispanic/Latino women.
Duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding at 6 months was 45.2% and 14% respectively
Inclusion criteria: self-identified Mexican-American mothers between the ages of 15-50
years who were breastfeeding at the time of recruitment/consent
Exclusion criteria: admission of the mother to the ICU, multiple births, congenital
abnormalities in the infant, or infant admitted to NICU
Interventions
Intervention (n = 26): motivational interviewing (MI); MI was operationalised by asking
the participant to rank the importance of breastfeeding for 6 months (1-10 scale) and her
confidence in her ability to continue breastfeeding (1-10 scale). The researcher focused

what she thought it would take to increase the number. Initial intervention delivered
at day 3 visit, MI booster sessions delivered at week 2 and week 6 visits to promote
behavioural change
Control (n=27): attentioncontrol (AC);mothersinthe ACgroupwere giveneducational
information about infant safety including information on fall prevention, poisoning,
fires, and burns during the first visit, about choking/aspiration, suffocation, drowning,
and smoking during the second visit, and about car seat safety during the final visit. The
principle investigator conducted all AC sessions

our ability to evaluate the potential of our MI intervention. 7
(27%) of the MI mothers and 13 (48%) of the AC mothers were
no longer participating because they discontinued breastfeeding
prior to week 6. We were unable to reach the remaining mothers
(11 in the MI group [42%] and 4 in the AC group [15%]) in
person or by phone to conduct the remaining assessments and
interventions/control sessions. Subsequently, we reestablished
contact with all but 3 mothers (all in the MI group) and deter-
mined their duration of breastfeeding through 6 months”

Wu 2014
Methods
2-arm quasi-RCT, n = 74
Participants
Participants were recruited from the maternity department of a tertiary hospital in a
major city of central China, Wuhan
Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: not reported for Wuhan but 95.6% in
Shanghai. In Whuhan 67% of mothers have stopped breastfeeding by 4-6 months
Inclusion criteria: ≥ 18 years of age, able to read and understand Mandarin, new mother
with a single, healthy term infant, and intending to breastfeed
Exclusion criteria: any condition that would interfere with breastfeeding, such as a serious
illness, mental illness, or an infant requiring special care that could not be discharged
with the mother
Interventions
Intervention (n = 37): self-efficacy intervention.Women received three sessions post-
partum: one within 1 day of delivery, 1 the next day and third 1 week after discharge.
The sessions involved assessment of breastfeeding goals and self-efficacy, self-efficacy-
enhancing strategies, and evaluation. Assessment enabled individualization of the inter-
vention to meet the woman’s needs. The self-efficacy strategies were informed by the
WHO breastfeeding counselling course. At the end of each session women completed an
evaluation form which was used to identify any changes needed and plan the following
session

Background rates of breastfeeding initiation: near-universal initiation of breastfeeding
90% breastfeeding at age 1 year; 69% of babies aged 0-1 month and 35% of those aged
2-3 months (about 10-14 weeks) were exclusively breastfed
Inclusion criteria: all mothers who gave birth to 1 healthy child in 1 of the participating
facilities between 24 May-25 August 2012 and who intended to attend well-baby clinic
visits in the same facility
Exclusion criteria: intended to attend well-baby clinic visits in a different health facility,
or to travel before the child was aged at least 6 months

Interventions
Intervention 1 (n = 363): Baby Friendly Hospital Intiative (BFHI) steps 1-9; healthcare
staff from antenatal and maternity care (i.e. delivery rooms and postpartum wards) in
the intervention facilities were trained using the WHO/UNICEF course. Session 14 of
the training on ’Ongoing support for mothers’ was limited only to ’Describe how to
prepare a mother for discharge’. Session 15 on ’Making your hospital baby friendly’ was
not covered. Additional material in French developed as part of a different project was
distributed to staff in clinics. Implementation of steps 1-9 was assessed at the end of the
study using the hospital self-appraisal questionnaire and each of the clinics randomized
to intervention groups met at least 80% of the global criteria for each step
Intervention 2 (n = 308): BFHI steps 1-10; staff training as for Intervention 1 and staff
from well-child clinics also received the same training. Flyers distributed to mothers
before discharge from the postpartum ward and during well-child clinic visits. These were
developed locally and contained culturally appropriate messages addressing behaviours
that had been identified as the main contributors to suboptimum breastfeeding practices
(such as giving the baby water in the first 6 months of life) in a pretrial survey. These
were published in 2 languages (French and local language). Additional material in French
that had been developed as part of a different project was distributed to staff in clinics
Implementation of steps 1-10 was assessed at the end of the study using the hospital self-
appraisal questionnaire and each of the clinics randomized to intervention groups met
at least 80% of the global criteria for each step
Control (n = 304): standard care
Outcomes
Primary:
Breastfeeding initiation within 1 h
Exclusive breastfeeding at 14 and 24 weeks

Interventions
The intervention will involve implementation of the BFCI in the intervention clusters. The proposed BFCI in
Kenya is a multifaceted program for promotion of optimal breastfeeding and infant and young child nutrition,
and other practices including maternal nutrition in the community. The BFCI is based on the principles of
the BFHI, but extends them to the community in order to provide women with a comprehensive support
system to improve breastfeeding practices and other maternal, infant and young child nutrition practices at
the community level. The BFCI package (unpublished) adapted for implementation in Kenya involves an 8-
step plan

Description
29 February 2016
New search has been performed
Search updated and 31 new studies included. The re-
view now includes a total of 100 studies, with 73 stud-
ies providing data
A ’Summary of findings’ table has been incorporated
in this update. In order to expedite this review rapidly
to be ready to inform the World health Organisation
recommendations on breastfeeding in maternity facil-
ities, we have restricted the outcomes analysed in this
update to the primary outcomes only. Secondary out-
comes analysed in the previously published version of
this review will be added in the next update of this re-
view in two years time.

Description
12 December 2011
New search has been performed
In the previous version of this review (Britton 2007)
we included 34 trials in 14 countries. In this updated
version, we assessed 218 reports; corresponding to 150
separate studies. We have included 67 studies and ex-
cluded 79. Four studies are still ongoing or awaiting
further assessment. In this updated version we have
added further subgroup analysis and discuss the im-
pact of different types of support interventions
12 December 2011
New citation required but conclusions have not
changed
The update was prepared by a new author team. Stud-
ies were carried out in 21 countries. Overall conclu-
sions have not changed, but we include more evidence
on the effect of interventions in different settings and
for different types of interventions; proactive interven-
tions that rely mainly on face-to-face support are more
likely to succeed

30 January 2006
New citation required and conclusions have changed
New review team prepared this update.
Previous versions of this review categorised support
as ’professional’ or ’lay’. This edition introduces a
new category: combined lay and professional support.
Studies in this category demonstrated a significant ef-
fect on duration of any breastfeeding, especially in the
first two months
30 January 2006
New search has been performed
Searches updated. We have included fourteen new
studies and excluded an additional 30 studies

In the original protocol, (1998), Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were specified as being the measure of treatment
effect. However, in the first published version of the review, Sikorski 1999, and in all subsequent versions of the review, Risk Ratios
(RRs) with 95% CIs have been presented. In the original protocol, the subgroups specified for investigation of heterogeneity were
reported as being income group and both ante- and post-natal time periods. Income group was removed from subsequent versions and
with the addition of many more studies, the following subgroups have been incorporated:
1. By type of supporter (professional versus lay person, or both).
2. By type of support (face-to-face versus telephone support).
3. By timing of support (antenatal and postnatal versus postnatal alone) - in original protocol.
288
Support for healthy breastfeeding mothers with healthy term babies (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 4. By whether the support was proactive (scheduled contacts) or reactive (women needed to request support).
5. By background breastfeeding initiation rates (low, medium or high background rates).
6. By intensity of support (number of scheduled contacts.
No sensitivity analyses were specified in the original protocol, 1998. In subsequent versions of the review and in the current update,
sensitivity analyses looking at the effect of allocation concealment by comparing results from studies at low risk of bias as opposed to
unclear or high risk of bias were incorporated.
The methods section has been updated to the current standard methods for Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth reviews and the review
now focuses on healthy mothers with healthy term infants. A ’Summary of findings’ table has been incorporated for this 2016 update.
In this update, 2016, we have not included data for the following secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes were recorded for stopping
any or exclusive breastfeeding before four to six weeks and before six months postpartum. Other outcomes of interest in previous
versions of this review were stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding at other time points (two, three, four, nine and 12 months), measures
of neonatal and infant morbidity (where available) and measures of maternal satisfaction with care or feeding method. Secondary
outcomes were not considered in this update so that the review could be completed in time to inform the World Health Organisation’s
review of the evidence and update of the WHO recommendations on breastfeeding in maternity facilities. A new set of core outcomes
for Cochrane pregnancy and childbirth breastfeeding reviews is currently being developed and the outcomes from this core set may
influence future outcomes chosen for this review.
Secondary outcomes included in last update, 2012:
1. Stopping breastfeeding before two, three, nine and 12 months postpartum.
2. Stopping exclusive breastfeeding before two, three, nine and 12 months postpartum.
3. Maternal satisfaction with care.
4. Maternal satisfaction with feeding method.
5. All-cause infant or neonatal morbidity.
In this update, 2016, ”healthy“ in terms of types of participants has been more clearly defined: ”Participants were healthy pregnant
women considering or intending to breastfeed or healthy women who were breastfeeding healthy babies.Healthy women and babies
were considered those who did not require additional medical care (e.g. women with diabetes, women with HIV/AIDs, overweight
or obese women) or surgical care (e.g. women who required a Caesarean Section). Studies which focused specifically on women with
additional care needs were excluded.“
