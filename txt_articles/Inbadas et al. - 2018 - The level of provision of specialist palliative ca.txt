AbstrAct
Objectives Comparative benchmarking of 
specialist palliative care (SPC) services across 
jurisdictions can be used to assess the adequacy 
of provision. Published in 2016, the Scottish 
Atlas of Palliative Care unlocks the possibility of 
benchmarking Scotland’s provision against other 
European Union (EU) countries. Our objectives 
were to describe the provision of SPC services 
in Scotland and compare this with other EU 
countries, assessing coverage against European 
norms.
Methods We conducted a secondary analysis 
of data collected as part for the Scottish Atlas 
by structured telephone (n=33) or online (n=3) 
survey with informants from 14 territorial 
health boards and 15 hospices who provided 
information about SPC services in their locality. 
National-level Scottish data were compared with 
data from other EU countries allowing ranking 
for each service type and service coverage as 
calculated against European Association for 
Palliative Care norms.
results Scotland had a total of 23 SPC inpatient 
units containing 349 beds, 27 SPC hospital 
support teams and 38 SPC home care teams. 
Relative to other EU countries, Scotland ranked 
seventh for provision of SPC inpatient units and 
hospital support teams, and fifth for home care 
teams. Coverage for these services was 85%, 
100% and 72%, respectively.
conclusion Scotland is positioned among the 
top 10 EU countries for the level of provision 
of SPC services. National policy in Scotland has 
focused on the delivery of palliative care at 
home or in a homely setting. These data support 
a focus on developing services in community 
settings to meet Scotland’s policy ambitions.
bAckgrOund
It is well established that decision making 
about the development of specialist pallia-
tive care (SPC) services, if it is to meet the 
needs, preferences and priorities of local 
communities, should be underpinned by 
accurate and current information char-
acterising existing service provision. This 
includes the type of services available, their 
geographic range and their organisational 
capacity. A 2015 report by the Scottish 
Parliament identified a significant ‘infor-
mation deficit’ concerning the provision 
of SPC in Scotland.1 In response, a Scot-
tish Atlas of Palliative Care was produced 
in 2016, which described, at national and 
territorial health board levels, the provi-
sion of SPC services in Scotland.2
While 
international 
benchmarking 
studies3 4 have described the development 
and organisation of SPC services across 
the whole WHO European Region as well 
as the countries of the European Union 
(EU), it has not been possible to profile 
Scotland in these, since they include the 
UK as a whole, and not its constituent 
countries, as the unit of analysis. The 
data required to profile Scotland against 
the UK as well as other EU member states 
using ranking and coverage models was 
collected for the first time in the Scot-
tish Atlas. We now use the primary data 
collected for the Scottish Atlas to establish 
the level of SPC provision in Scotland as 
compared with other EU countries and 
to express this as a measure of coverage 
for specific service types based on expert 
guidelines.5 6
AiMs
The aims of this study were to describe, 
at national level, the provision of SPC 
services in Scotland, to compare these 
with other countries in the EU and to 
assess the coverage of SPC services in 
Scotland based on the recommendations 
of a European Association for Palliative 
Care (EAPC) ‘White Paper’ on standards 
and norms for hospice and palliative care 
in Europe.

MethOds
In Scotland, healthcare is provided free at the point 
of access to all citizens through the National Health 
Service (NHS), which is organised into 14 territo-
rial health boards. SPC services are also provided by 
independent hospices, which are charitable organisa-
tions that receive up to 50% of their agreed annual 
operating costs from the NHS. We conducted a 
secondary analysis of aggregated national level data 
on the level of SPC service provision that had been 
collected in a national service mapping study as part 
of the Scottish Atlas of Palliative Care.2 The methods 
used to map SPC service provision in the Scottish 
Atlas have been described previously.2 In brief, the 
chief executive officers of independent hospices, 
NHS Executive Leads for Palliative and End of Life 
Care and, where in place, the chairperson of the 
Managed Clinical Network for Palliative and End 
of Life Care in each territorial health board were 
contacted between August and September 2015, 
informed of the nature and purpose of the service 
mapping study and invited to contribute informa-
tion about the services they provided. Consent was 
implied by the willingness of service providers to 
nominate a key informant from their organisation to 
contribute data to the study. Data were collected in a 
telephone survey conducted by one of three trained 
investigators (HI, MG and AJW). Prior to the survey, 
respondents were sent a structured questionnaire to 
enable them to gather the required information in 
advance. All survey respondents were either directly 
involved in delivering or responsible for managing 
the SPC services on which they provided informa-
tion; in some cases, it was necessary to speak with 
several informants from a single territorial health 
board to obtain a complete picture of service provi-
sion. Where it was not possible to conduct a tele-
phone survey, despite repeated attempts, respondents 
were given an option to complete the structured 
questionnaire online (n=3). The structured ques-
tionnaire and definitions therein were derived from 
the European Atlas of Palliative Care7 and adapted 
for local use (see appendix 1 of the Atlas). In total, 
36 informants provided data from all 14 territorial 
health boards and all 15 fully operational indepen-
dent hospices. The SPC service mapping study did 
not involve patients or service users. It is anomalous 
that information of this nature is not routinely avail-
able to inform the design and delivery of SPC services 
to meet the needs of local populations. The service 
mapping study was therefore considered as service 
evaluation and, as such, research ethics approval for 
the study was not sought.
We followed the method of measuring palliative 
care ‘resources’ developed in previous studies.3 This 
involved establishing the numbers of three types of 
SPC service provision, inpatient units, hospital support 
teams and home care teams, then calculating the ratio 
of services per million inhabitants by service type and 
total number of all services. This ratio was used to 
compare Scotland with the top ranking countries in 
the EU.3 Population data were obtained from National 
Records Scotland.8
Following an established method, we also calculated 
coverage of SPC provision in Scotland for each service 
type.4 Coverage refers to the relationship between the 
number of available services and the estimated number 
of services that would be required, based on expert 
opinion, to meet the palliative care needs of a given 
population. The EAPC White Paper identifies ‘norms’ 
for the structural provision of SPC, which represent 
a consensus statement of the levels that, if achieved, 
would be expected to translate into high-quality care. 
Recommendations based on these ‘norms’ for the 
number of services required per population are as 
follows: one home care team per 100 
000 inhabitants; 
one inpatient unit and one hospital support team 
per 200 
000 inhabitants.5 6 Based on these figures, 
the required number of the three types of services 
was calculated for the population of Scotland and a 
measure of ‘coverage’, expressed as a percentage, was 
established. EAPC recommendation concerning the 
desirable upper and lower numbers of SPC beds per 
million population, producing a calculation based on 
the number of SPC inpatient beds in Scotland, was also 
calculated.5
results
level of sPc service provision
Scotland had a total of 23 SPC inpatient units containing 
349 beds, 27 hospital support teams and 38 home care 
teams, which equates to 4.3 SPC inpatient units per 
million people, 5.0 hospital support teams per million 
people and 7.1 home care teams per million people. 
Scotland’s position for each type of service in relation 
to the 10 top EU countries is shown in table 1.
coverage
Applying the EAPC norms to Scotland’s population of 
5 347 600,8 the optimal level of provision for each 
SPC service is 27 inpatient units, 27 hospital support 
teams and 53 home care teams. Based on the number 
of services available in Scotland, we estimate coverage 
of SPC inpatient units, hospital support teams and 
home care teams to be 85%, 100% and 72%, 
respec-
tively. This positions Scotland among the top 10 EU 
countries for coverage in all three types of service 
provision (table 2).
The EAPC norms recommend a range of between 
80 and 100 SPC inpatient beds per million people. 
Applied to Scotland’s population, this would equate to 
a recommended number of inpatient beds ranging from 
427 to 535. Although relative to the EAPC norms, the 
coverage of SPC inpatient units is 85% in Scotland, 
the coverage of SPC inpatient beds is 65% (at 100 per 
million) and 82% (at 80 per million) (table 3).

discussiOn
To date, published studies examining the provision of 
SPC services at a regional, national or international 
level have largely relied on information provided by 
one or more national experts.3 9 10 This is problematic 
because national experts may lack the requisite knowl-
edge to accurately report in detail service provision at 
the national or subnational level and may be biased 
in their reporting.11 Our study analysed data gathered 
from 36 informants directly delivering, or respon-
sible for managing, local SPC services in each of Scot-
land’s 14 territorial health boards areas, increasing the 
validity of our findings. Due to their local knowledge 
and the nature of the telephone survey, most respon-
dents volunteered a narrative around the quantitative 
data on the level of service provision they provided, 
which was invaluable in contextualising the study find-
ings. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its 
kind to use such a robust data collection strategy.
The UK is generally considered to be the reference 
country against which the development of SPC in other 
countries is benchmarked.1 Until now, it has not been 
possible to disaggregate Scottish data from that of the 
rest of the UK.3 9 10 While we might expect the provi-
sion of SPC services in Scotland to be similar to the 
rest of the UK, this is the first study to provide confir-
mation. The provision of SPC services in Scotland 
was found to be well balanced and broadly reflective 
of that in the rest of the UK, with Scotland’s position 
being higher than the rest of the UK for inpatient and 
home care teams but lower for hospital support team. 
Analysis of coverage against EAPC norms suggests that 
Scotland has optimal coverage for hospital support 
teams. More broadly, Scotland was positioned among 
the top 10 EU countries in hospital and home care 
resources for SPC. Although the ratio of home care 
teams per million people (7.1) is better than the ratios 
for hospital support teams (5.0) and inpatient units 
(4.3), Scotland shows an optimal coverage of hospital 
support teams and a lower than recommended 
coverage for inpatients units (85%) and home care 
teams (72%). Calculated at both the upper and lower 
ranges, Scotland scores lower on SPC inpatient bed

coverage (65%–82%) than it does on the calculation 
based on the number of units.
For almost two decades, the strategic narrative for 
health and social care in Scotland has focused on the 
delivery of safe, effective, high-quality, patient-centred 
care delivered at home or in a homely setting.12 13 As a 
result, over the last decade, the total number of avail-
able staffed hospital beds in Scotland has been reduced 
by almost a fifth.14 The lower than anticipated level 
of inpatient SPC beds may therefore reflect successful 
policy implementation rather than deficiencies in the 
planning and provision of SPC services. Many service 
providers in our study, especially in remote and rural 
areas, identified that while they did not have dedicated 
SPC inpatient beds, they were providing integrated 
SPC to inpatients that remained under the care of their 
admitting specialty, through SPC hospital support 
teams. This flexible model of care ensures effective 
use of acute hospital beds and continuity of care and 
enables collaborative working between generalists and 
specialists that in turn may facilitate the ‘up-skilling’ 
of healthcare providers from other specialties in deliv-
ering ‘generalist’ palliative care. Indeed, in recent 
years, the role of SPC providers in providing educa-
tion and support to generalists has been champi-
oned.15 16 Increasingly in Scotland SPC clinicians and 
nurse specialists are jointly appointed to work between 
the independent hospices, the acute hospital sector 
and community services to provide integrated care 
and facilitate early hospital discharge. This change in 
how and where SPC teams are based is reflected in the 
optimal coverage of hospital support teams.
The coverage of home care teams in Scotland was 
less than optimal. This is an important finding. If the 
policy of shifting the balance of care from hospitals to 
community settings is to be translated into practice, 
community services must be adequately resourced.12 
There has been a growing policy recognition in Scot-
land of the importance of achieving preferred place of 
care and preferred place of death.14 Most people would 
prefer to die at home or in a community setting.17 It 
is not possible to measure how well preferences are 
being met in Scotland because neither preferred place 
of care and preferred place of death are systematically 
recorded. In England, an indicator for death in usual 
place of residence has been developed and is in use. In 
Scotland, such a measure is not available. A surrogate 
measure, the percentage of the last 6 
months of life 
spent at home or in a community setting, is in use; in 
2014/2015 among decedents in Scotland, 86% of the 
last 6 
months of life were spent at home or in a commu-
nity setting and 14% in an acute hospital.18 Moreover, 
people are more likely to die in hospital in Scotland 
(53%) than they are in England (47%).19 Adequately 
resourcing community-based services, across health 
and social care, will be important if Scotland is to 
realise its policy ambitions; our study provides data 
to advocate for further developing community-based 
services. Many other health and social care profes-
sionals contribute to the interdisciplinary teams 
that support people to live and die well in commu-
nity settings, not least community district nurses, 
disease-specific specialist nurses and primary care 
physicians. In Scotland, these key individuals provide 
generalist palliative care and often act as gatekeepers 
to SPC services. The availability of high-quality gener-
alist palliative care is likely to directly impact on the 
demand for and subsequently delivery of SPC services 
in community settings. At the same time, measuring 
the availability and delivery of generalist palliative care 
raised additional challenges. It is important to note 
that when collecting the primary data for the Atlas, 
despite clear definitions, there was variation in how 
service providers conceptualised their services; for 
example, one territorial health board reported having 
just one home care team while another, with the same 
level of staffing across its home care service, reported 
having multiple home care teams stating that each 
team covered distinct geographical areas within the 
board. Our data on home care teams should therefore 
be interpreted with caution. This does raise questions 
about what ‘counts’ as a service in any given setting 
and may have led to an underestimation of the number 
of home care teams operating in Scotland. It also high-
lights the importance of common definitions and the 
challenges in operationalising these, both for service 
evaluation and for research.
The EAPC White Paper provides norms for the 
number of services and resources per million people, 
allowing for the diversity of concepts of SPC and 
varying cultures across Europe. These norms are 
based on expert opinion and estimates of demand for 
services that EAPC considers, if achieved, will translate 
into the provision of high-quality care. This approach 
to establishing a range of values for benchmarking is 
not without limitations. It is common practice where 
the evidence base is lacking to rely on expert opinion. 
Underpinning recommendations for service provision 
using estimated demand for services, rather than need, 
is problematic; however, estimating palliative care 
needs is particularly challenging.20 The appropriateness 
of these measures is likely to change as services evolve 
and the evidence base grows. The measures may also

have differing significance according to the context of 
the healthcare system within a country. For example, 
the coverage of hospital support teams in Belgium was 
over 100%; however, according to Belgian law, every 
hospital is obliged to have a SPC team. The extent to 
which ‘generalist’ palliative care principles are effec-
tively embedded within a healthcare system may also 
influence the required level of SPC services and in part 
explain an apparent underprovision or overprovision 
of certain services. It is important to consider that 
these metrics are not sensitive enough to capture such 
nuance. The balance between services could also be a 
result of the distribution of population across different 
areas of the country. With the exception of the central 
belt of Scotland, where the population is concentrated 
into large conurbations, there are many dispersed and 
rural communities of small population. As in many 
other countries, the distribution and volume of SPC 
services in Scotland is the result of historical circum-
stances, local priorities and enthusiasms, as well as the 
ebb and flow of government interest and funding. The 
EAPC norms provide a valuable tool for benchmarking 
the provision of SPC services between countries 
or within a country over time, which can be a valu-
able tool for advocacy and also, over time, for more 
rational planning. However, these measure require 
careful interpretation considering the wider socio-
demographic, political and economic context within 
which services are being provided. Importantly, these 
metrics do not provide any objective measure of the 
quality of SPC.
The difference in timing of data gathered for Scot-
land alone and that gathered for the 10 EU countries 
used as comparators is acknowledged. Data for the EU 
ranking and coverage studies were collected in 2013, 
compared with 2015 for the present study. This small 
time gap is not considered to be significant. Indeed, 
the proximity of Scottish data to that for the UK as a 
whole, given the common evolution of SPC provision 
across the UK, is reassuring.
The primary data used in this study were derived 
from a novel SPC service mapping study. Prior to 
this, it was not possible to describe the level of SPC 
provision at local or national level in Scotland; it is 
still not possible to measure SPC activity, outcomes or 
quality of care in Scotland. It is anomalous that data 
of this kind are not available to inform the design, 
strategic commissioning, delivery and continuous 
quality improvement of SPC services. These signifi-
cant ‘information deficits’ were recognised in a 2015 
Scottish Parliamentary Inquiry into Palliative Care,1 
and a policy commitment has been made to address 
them in Scotland’s Strategic Framework for Action 
on Palliative and End of Life Care later that year by 
the Scottish Government.15 The national mapping 
survey was a first step towards this. The study was 
both labour and time intensive; however, it was neces-
sary to provide reliable information to quantify and 
characterise SPC provision at local and national level 
in Scotland. In the study, several informants acknowl-
edged that their service(s) were being redesigned 
to better meet the needs, preferences and priorities 
for care in their locality, as informed by local health 
needs assessments. This highlights the challenge of 
maintaining accurate and current data on SPC service 
provision and organisation at a national level. A more 
sustainable approach to collecting and collating these 
data is required building on models of SPC directories 
used elsewhere and making use of multiple providers 
of data.
Finally, we acknowledge that this is an analysis of 
indicators for SPC. It does not address the levels and 
coverage of resources that may be available for the 
delivery of ‘generalist’ or ‘primary’ palliative care. 
Such a mapping and assessment is also worth consid-
ering but was beyond the remit of the present study.
cOnclusiOn
This study has addressed part of the ‘information 
deficit’ previously identified. It provides a comparative 
analysis of resources and coverage of SPC in Scotland, 
as compared with other countries of the EU. In all the 
items compared - inpatient units, hospital care support 
teams and home care teams — Scotland is positioned 
in the top 10 EU countries and has a consistent level 
of coverage. Moreover, this is at a high level (72%–
100%) in relation to the expert recommendations of 
the EAPC.
The study provides a baseline from which to monitor 
the development of SPC in Scotland. The Scottish 
government has published a Strategic Framework for 
Action for Palliative and End of Life Care covering 
the period 2016–2021.15 The present study and the 
accompanying Atlas constitute an important baseline, 
against which some of the goals of the Framework can 
be assessed.
