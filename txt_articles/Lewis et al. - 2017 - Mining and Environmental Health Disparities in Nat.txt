Abstract
Purpose of Review More than a century of hard rock mining
has left a legacy of >160,000 abandoned mines in the Western
USA that are home to the majority of Native American lands.
This article describes how abrogation of treaty rights, ineffec-
tive policies, lack of infrastructure, and a lack of research in
Native communities converge to create chronic exposure, ill-
defined risks, and tribal health concerns.
Recent Findings Recent results show that Native Americans
living near abandoned uranium mines have an increased like-
lihood for kidney disease and hypertension, and an increased
likelihood of developing multiple chronic diseases linked to
their proximity to the mine waste and activities bringing them
in contact with the waste. Biomonitoring confirms higher than
expected exposure to uranium and associated metals in the
waste in adults, neonates, and children in these communities.
Summary These sites will not be cleaned up for many gener-
ations making it critical to understand and prioritize exposure-
toxicity relationships in Native populations to appropriately
allocate limited resources to protect health. Recent initiatives,
in partnership with Native communities, recognize these
needs and support development of tribal research capacity to
ensure that research respectful of tribal culture and policies
can address concerns in the future. In addition, recognition
of the risks posed by these abandoned sites should inform
policy change to protect community health in the future.

Introduction
Contamination of soil and water by waste from more than
160,000 abandoned hard rock mines throughout the Western
USA (operationally defined to include Arizona, California,
Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming) has created
a legacy of chronic exposures to metal mixtures in Native
American communities. Biomonitoring in the Strong Heart
Study cohort which included Native Americans from these
Western states supports increased metal exposures by identi-
fying unique patterns of elevated metal mixtures relative to
several other races in urban, suburban, and rural settings [1].
The political and social context in which these exposures de-
veloped highlights a history of environmental injustices based
in clashes of cultural values, and political and ethical failures
to support negotiated treaty rights. Understanding the health
impacts of these exposures is complicated by a lack of under-
standing of the toxicity of metals in complex mixtures in any
population, exacerbated by a general lack of environmental
health studies in Native populations in particular. In addition,
many of the Native communities in proximity to these waste
sites have numerous risk factors associated with disparities in
health outcomes such as poverty, educational status, infra-
structure, and frequently, compromised underlying health sta-
tus. Further complications to predicting toxicological re-
sponses arise from the traditional and subsistence lifestyles
of many Native communities that create distinct exposure pat-
terns not captured in the assumptions of standard suburban,
recreational, or occupational exposure scenarios used for risk

 assessments [2]. Traditional lifestyles, such as eating or har-
vesting local plants for sustenance, ceremonial or medicinal
purposes, or drinking from historically used water sources
may result in greater than predicted exposures of Native
Americans to mine wastes now contaminating these sources.
The impacts of the waste on tribal nations are not likely to
resolve for generations to come. In addition to the number of
sites and estimated clean-up costs that exceed any available
resources, the sheer volume of wastes at these sites is a barrier.
Laguna Pueblo’s Jackpile Mine Superfund site alone is greater
than 34 km2 including disturbance of more than 12 km2 [3].
Geochemical and physical factors complicate understanding
mobility and challenge technological remediation strategies as
the complexities in mixture composition and geochemistry
produce varying results across sites. Removal of waste is com-
plicated by the hazards inherent in transport of such large
volumes of hazardous materials through communities, and
in the case of uranium, by the fact that the mixture of toxic
and radioactive metals creates a mixed waste with limited
disposal options. This paper will highlight the framework in
which these health, political, social, and environmental factors
converge to create ongoing uncertainty about tribal health and
to discuss new initiatives to reduce these uncertainties for
generations likely to face these risks well into the future.
Treaty Rights vs. Mining Interests on Tribal Lands
Through various treaties developed between Native American
tribes and the US Government, the tribes ceded vast amounts
of their traditional land base in exchange for recognition of
their sovereign status to self-government and commitments to
ensure protection of their health and culture. Through these
treaties, certain regions of the country were set aside as Tribal
“Reservations”—lands over which a tribe had sovereignty. As
mineral resources were identified on those lands, ethical and
legal responsibilities set in the treaties were abrogated by the
US government to provide access for mining by successively
shrinking the area of lands designated to each tribe; by legis-
lating in the 66th Congress the leasing of tribal lands in the
Western USA by individuals and corporations for purposes of
mineral extraction for 20 years, renewable in successive
10 year periods; and by prohibiting in a 1919 law the creation
of any future Reservations on Public Lands through executive
orders of the President [4]. In If You Poison Us, Peter
Eichstaedt’s comprehensive review of congressional debates
and policies leading up to this legislation describes discus-
sions indicating that the creation of Reservations by
Executive Order on lands holding such vast reserves of min-
erals would never have been allowed had Congress been
aware of those reserves [5••]. In 1902, Indian Affairs
Commissioner William Jones argued that land should not be
set aside exclusively for Native American use and the more
than 200,000 km2 currently in Reservations should be
“thrown open as rapidly as possible”, acknowledging that
the treaties made it necessary for Congress to “treat with
them” before opening their lands to settlement, and therefore
Congress should use some arbitrary means to open the land
[6•].
The 1919 legislation provided for 5% of the net value of the
extracted resources paid to the USA “for benefit of the
Indians” to be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of those
Indians having tribal rights to lease land, but at all times sub-
ject to “appropriation by Congress for their benefit”.
However, documented shadow accounting by mining compa-
nies reduced that net value and therefore the amount paid into
those accounts [5••]. The continued disregard for the ethical
and legal guarantees of the treaties resulted in long-term mis-
management of Native American Tribal Trust funds by the US
government and further limited tribal benefits. Nearly a cen-
tury later, between 2009 and 2016, the US Attorney General
and Secretary of the Interior reached settlements with more
than 100 tribes totaling $3.3 billion USD for mismanagement
of monetary and natural resource assets held in trust by the
USA for the benefit of the tribes [7]. These settlements, how-
ever, do not come close to addressing the mining legacy. A
recent $1 billion USD settlement from Tronox awarded to the
Navajo Nation has been estimated sufficient to address reme-
dial action of only ∼10% of the 3.6 billion kg of uranium mine
waste on Navajo Nation alone [8]. The 520 abandoned urani-
um mines on Navajo represent less than 12% of the more than
4000 abandoned uranium mines in the Western USA, and an
even smaller fraction of the more than 161,000 abandoned
hard rock mines in the Western USA. These numbers provide
a perspective on the scope of the problem being faced by tribal
communities.
Scope of the Problem and Ongoing Threats
As a result of the disregard of treaty rights, lands on and
proximal to Native lands in the Western states (Fig. 1) were
extensively mined for metals such as gold, silver, lead, copper,
molybdenum, and vanadium since the mid-1800s and urani-
um since the 1940s. As deposits played out and demand for
specific metals declined, the mines were abandoned—
resulting in more than 160,000 abandoned hard rock mines
(not including coal) in the Western states [9], more than 4000
of which are abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) [10]. Today,
more than 4.1 million Native Americans live in the Western
USA, 478,000 on Reservation lands [11]. Combining US
Census information [11] and a gridded population dataset
[12], we estimated that more than 600,000 Native
Americans live within 10 km of an abandoned mine
(Table 1). Potential associated contaminants of concern for
Native Americans within 10 km based on the primary metal

 mined are listed in Table 1. In addition, depending on the
process, chemicals such as cyanide, sulfate, nitrate, and others
used in ore extraction could remain in the waste or water
sources. Population estimates based on census data assume
inclusion of tribal members in the Census pool. While esti-
mates of accuracy of count for the most recent census are not
yet available, previous estimates have indicated an undercount
of Native Americans ranging from 5% [13] to nearly 20%
[14].
Additional associated exposure sources include ore transfer
stations, waste piles, mill tailings piles, and areas affected by
spills, resulting in more than 500,000 discrete contamination
sources [9]. Sites are most often unmarked, unfenced, and
located only through historical memory or mining records.
Using available geospatial information on mineral extraction
from the US Mineral Resources Data System [26], Fig. 1 vi-
sually highlights the proximity of reservation land to these
mining regions.
Although tribal control of mineral resource leasing and
extraction has strengthened during the twentieth century due
to laws such as the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982
and the 2001 Bureau of Land Management Rule 3809 [27],
the General Mining Law of 1872 remains in effect as the
overarching regulation. The location of abandoned mines
within tribal watersheds and the lack of environmental protec-
tions in the 1872 Mining Law has left a legacy for exposure
not only through direct contamination of tribal lands, but
through continuing drainage of contaminated mine water.
Impoundments of untreated mine waste and water are

 designated as waste treatment systems, which exempts many
bodies of water from Clean Water Act regulations [28]. This
designation supported by the 1872 Mining Law allows dis-
charge of untreated mine waste into surface water and has
resulted in contamination of an estimated 40% of the headwa-
ters of Western US watersheds [29], water sources still relied
on by virtually all Native American tribes for survival and
cultural preservation [28].
The Gold King Mine Spill in 2015 was but an example of
the implications this legacy poses throughout watersheds in
the West. In that spill, 11,300 m3 of contaminated mine water
breached containment from the abandoned Gold King Mine in
Southern Colorado, carrying lead, arsenic, and other metals
(see Table 1) through Ute and Navajo tribal lands as well as
non-tribal lands along the San Juan River [16], leading Navajo
Nation to file a lawsuit against USEPA [30]. Releases from
abandoned gold mines have also contaminated waters and
lands of tribes including, among others, Fort Belknap in
north-central Montana and numerous tribal lands in
California, Colorado, Nevada [31–33] and South Dakota
(see “Case Study 1” below).
The threats to tribal lands, however, are not only from
legacy mines. New mines continue to be fought by tribal com-
munities as illustrated by legal actions taken by the Western
Shoshone Tribe in Nevada [31], the Menominee Tribe along
the Michigan-Wisconsin border [34] and Navajo communities
[35]. Pressure to open new uranium mines led Navajo Nation
to pass the Natural Resources Protection Act of 2005 banning
uranium mining and processing within Navajo Indian Country
as the Fundamental Laws of the Diné indicate substances in
the Earth harmful to the people should not be disturbed [36].
Sociodemographic and Infrastructure Risk Factors
in Native Communities
Without proper understanding of toxicity and factors control-
ling it in Native American populations, the risks represented
by these wastes remain ill-defined. Native Americans have
lower life expectancy and more health challenges than other
populations in the USA. Data compiled by Indian Health
Services (2007–2009) and other entities illustrate the signifi-
cant health disparities observed within these communities
(Table 2). These disparities are frequently attributed to genetic
susceptibility, and while some studies show mutations in in-
dividuals with a specific disease, the lack of population genet-
ic data defining prevalence questions this assumption [37••].
The persistence of disparities in virtually all prevailing dis-
eases across multiple language groups suggests other contrib-
utors to these outcomes, such as social determinants,
underexplored disparities in environmental exposures and re-
sponse to toxic insults, or gene-environment interactions [38].
Experimental and epidemiologic data support the associa-
tion between exposure to toxic metals and increased risk for a
variety of negative health outcomes including kidney and car-
diovascular disease, neurocognitive disorders, and various
cancers in both Native and non-Native populations [44–56].
Cancer mortality rates for the Native American population
increased over a 20-year period (1990–2009), while decreas-
ing for Whites during the same time [43]. Two prospective
studies have specifically linked exposure to the metals cadmi-
um and arsenic to cancer mortality in Native populations [53,
56]. Preliminary epidemiologic data document nearly 4 out of
every 10 residents of the Wind River Reservation of Eastern
Shoshone and Northern Arapaho have a blood relative who
has died of cancer [57]. Wind River was the site of a former
uranium mill and the remediated waste pile remains in the
community. The preliminary report falls short of making a
direct association but reinforces their concern that the waste
is adversely affecting health [57, 58]. In 1988, US DOE found
soil, surface water, and shallow groundwater on Wind River
Reservation were contaminated with uranium, radium, and
thorium and chose to use natural attenuation to reduce the
contamination over time. However, following floods in
2010, monitoring wells showed uranium spikes as high as
100 times the USEPA Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)
for drinking water (0.03 mg/L) [58]. Despite this and other
reports of contamination linked to increased cancer incidence
and other negative health outcomes, there remains a paucity of
population studies in these Native communities. Moreover,
our understanding of exposure-toxicity relationships in
Native communities continues to be limited by our general
lack of understanding of the toxicity of any complex mixtures.
Even determination of dose in Native communities can be
grossly underestimated by neglecting traditional cultural prac-
tices resulting in frequent and direct contact with contaminat-
ed lands and waters, and a greater, sometimes 100%, reliance
on traditional and locally grown foods [2].
Disparities in tribal infrastructure further exacerbate risk.
Nearly 14% of Native households lack access to a public
water system compared to 0.6% of the USA as a whole; with
some tribes lacking access for more than 30% of their popu-
lations [59], creating a greater reliance on unregulated sources.
Uranium MCLs are exceeded in more than 13% of unregulat-
ed wells on Navajo Nation, with arsenic exceeding the MCL
in 15% and co-occurrence in 7% of wells [60]. Concentrations
are strongly associated with distance from abandoned mines.
Moreover, when regulated public water is available, drinking
water systems in Indian country experience “significant vio-
lations” or health-based violations of Safe Drinking Water
Act regulations twice as frequently as other systems [61], ex-
ceeding MCLs for various metals, polycyclic aromatic hydro-
carbons, trihalomethanes, pesticides, and nitrates. Two
months prior to detection of lead in the Flint, MI, water supply,
a regulated community drinking water supply serving the
Curr Envir Health Rpt (2017) 4:130–141
133
 Navajo community of Sanders was found to have exceeded
uranium MCLs for more than a decade as a result of migration
of contaminants from a 1979 uranium mill tailings spill [62].
Although state officials were aware of the problem, in contrast
to Flint, no notification to the community occurred, and no
federal outcry or resources resulted. These challenges and
others demonstrate the need for infrastructure [63] and that
the gap in fundamental infrastructure sets a background expo-
sure upon which other environmental exposures and health
disparities are overlaid.
Case Study 1: Black Hills Gold and the Sioux Nation
For the nine tribes of the Great Sioux Nation, the Black Hills
are sacred lands of their traditional homeland in the northern
Great Plains. Following the Battle of Little Big Horn, the 1868
Fort Laramie Treaty between the US government and Sioux
Nation guaranteed them “undisturbed use and occupation” of
the Black Hills and stated that no treaty for the cession of any
part of the reservation would be valid unless signed by three-
fourths of the adult male Sioux population. However, when
gold was discovered, those treaty rights were abandoned by
US confiscation of the Black Hills in the 1877 Act, signed by
fewer than 10% of the adult male Sioux population, to allow
for mining. Over the next century, mining companies extract-
ed billions of dollars in metals from these lands. Production
from 1875 to 1971 reported more than 1.1 million kg of gold
extracted, which even at $1 USD per gram would exceed $1
billion USD. The Sioux never accepted the legality of the
Black Hills confiscation and sued the US government for re-
turn of the land. In 1980, the US Supreme Court upheld a
decision to support the Sioux claim that US government’s
decision to occupy the Black Hills constituted a “taking of
tribal property” with an implied obligation for the government
to make just compensation. Rather than returning the land,
however, the US Supreme Court awarded the nine tribes of
the Great Sioux Nation $102 million USD as compensation
for their loss. The Sioux have never collected this payment,
which remains in trust and now exceeds $1.3 billion USD
[64].
Why would some of the poorest tribes in the country, with
unemployment rates as high as 80%, turn down such a large
sum of money? The award of financial compensation misses
many key points central to the disputes between the tribes and
the federal government. First, the suit was never about money
but about the return of lands central to the spirit of the Sioux
Nation. Second, the value is small relative to the profit made
from both the land and resource extraction in the intervening
years. Third, to take money for the land is acknowledging a
real estate transaction, and in the words of former Oglala pres-
ident Teresa Two Bulls “If we accept the money, then we have
no more of the treaty obligations that the federal government
has with us for taking our land, for taking our gold, all our
resources out of the Black Hills … we’re poor now, we’ll be
poorer then when that happens,” [64]. While the Sioux and the
federal government continue to seek a compromise, the legacy
of the Black Hills mining continues to pose concerns for the
health of the Sioux.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, more than 10,000 abandoned gold
mines are on or near Native American Reservation lands
throughout the Western USA. In the Black Hills, there are
hundreds of gold mines but few as profitable as the
Homestake Mine near Lead, which produced more than
964,000 kg of the 1.1 million kg reported for the Black Hills
from 1875 to 1971 [65]. Homestake discharged high concen-
trations of arsenic from their mill directly into the Cheyenne
River drainage for decades [66] contaminating 29 km of
downstream creeks that received Superfund action for arsenic
contaminated soil, sediments, and water. Although the site
was removed from the National Priorities List in 1996, there
remains a band of arsenic-containing sediment in the
Cheyenne River banks and floodplains that form the southern
boundary of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Reservation
(more than 250 km downstream) [67]. While the arsenic-
contaminated sediment in the banks has been buried by years
of deposition since the closure of the mine in 2002, intermit-
tent floods during operational years deposited contaminated
sediment that remains in surface soils of lands used for agri-
culture, ranching, and ceremonial purposes as far as 1 km
from the river (personal communication, Dec. 2016, C.
Ducheneaux, Department of Environment and Natural
Resources, Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe).

 Within the Cheyenne River Sioux, antinuclear antibody
(ANA) prevalence exceeds that found in the US population,
with occurrence predicted by the proximity to the arsenic de-
posits [68]. While the presence of ANA does not alone indi-
cate frank autoimmune disease, an associated elevated preva-
lence of several specific autoantibodies was also observed
[68]. ANAs serve as early serologic markers in a variety of
autoimmune diseases [69–71] and have also been linked to
mercury exposure from Amazonian gold mines, to consump-
tion of fish contaminated with methylmercury, and to drinking
arsenic contaminated water [72–76].
The arsenic is located in the floodplains where gathering of
fruit for sustenance and herbs for medicinal, traditional, and
ceremonial practices has been documented as well as other
traditional land use practices that create direct exposure path-
ways through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. These
uses raise ethical and policy issues around how exposure and
health are evaluated. If standard exposure assessment assump-
tions interpreted through extant health research are applied to
a Native community practicing a traditional lifestyle, such as
the Cheyenne River Sioux, results may underestimate expo-
sure [2]. Secondly, not only are data on response to toxicants
limited for Native Americans, the definition of health itself
may differ substantially between the cultures with regulatory
agencies interpreting health from a Western disease model and
the tribal population using a more holistic view based their
belief of interconnection between people, their ecosystem, and
their well-being [77••]. Our team is currently working with the
CRST to understand the mobility of the Homestake arsenic;
evaluate human exposure through ceremonial, traditional,
ranching, and recreation activities; and assess the contribution
of exposure to the high prevalence of autoimmune markers
observed in those living in the floodplain [68].
Case Study 2: Uranium and the Navajo Nation
Uranium mines present a special subset of abandoned hard
rock mines resulting from the Cold War and associated polit-
ical stressors. Although reservations encompass only 5.6% of
land area in the Western USA, approximately one in five ura-
nium mines are located within 10 km of an Native American
Reservation with more than 75% (more than 3200 of the
4600) within 80 km (Fig. 1). This does not include lands
traditionally used by the tribes or lands feeding tribal water-
and airsheds. Figure 1 highlights areas where uranium was the
dominant ore extracted and illustrates that multiple tribes are
affected by AUMs, including Navajo Nation in the Four
Corners region, multiple Sioux tribes in the Black Hills re-
gion, Northern Arapahoe and Eastern Shoshone at Wind
River in Wyoming, and several tribes including the Spokane
in Washington State.
The development of the atomic bomb and the subsequent
nuclear arsenal that fueled the Cold War led to prioritization of
uranium mining above protection of human health, as well
documented by Eichstaedt in If You Poison Us [5••].
Vanadium, which occurs in combination with uranium in car-
notite, was mined on Navajo as early as 1902 to support steel
hardening. The Manhattan Project’s need for uranium made
the repurposing of these mines expedient and led to govern-
ment action to promote uranium exploration without regard
for protection of human health. The hazards of radiation were
recognized since the 1920s, and increased respiratory disease
and lung cancer in European uranium miners was well known
by the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and others
from the findings of lung cancer and respiratory disease in
European miners. However, the AEC was reluctant to set
standards within mines or take any other measures to protect
miners’ health, fearing that public awareness of the dangers in
the mines would limit their ability to obtain uranium.
Following the US Public Health Service’s (PHS) requests to
set safety standards, the AEC set standards of 10 pCi/L in all
operations except uranium mines; after lengthy debate, a stan-
dard of 100 pCi/L in uranium mines was set in 1967—23 years
after the beginning of uranium mining on the Navajo Nation
and 17 years after the first US Public Health Service uranium
miners’ health study identified respiratory risks. It would be
another 33 years before these details were made public and the
US Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation
Act (RECA) that would begin a process of compensating
those affected. Compensation of Navajo miners was slowed
significantly, however, as a result of barriers in the law requir-
ing documentation of births, marriages, and death records not
routinely kept within the tribe and the restriction of compen-
sable health effects to lung cancer only. The law has been
revised only once, in 2000, to incorporate additional compen-
sable diseases and include uranium mill workers [78], while
additional revisions to compensate miners who worked after
the government turned over mine safety to the private sector in
1971 remain in limbo.
As late as 1991–2005, 25% of the deaths in the 4137 for-
mer uranium miners followed by US PHS were attributed to
lung cancer, with Native miners at triple the expected rate
[79]. Native miners bore a disproportionate burden of non-
malignant respiratory disease as well. Their rate of pneumo-
coniosis was as much as fourfold higher than in non-Hispanic
whites (NHW), and they also had an increased risk of restric-
tive lung disease and decreased FEV1 [80]. For Navajo
miners, underground uranium mining was the primary con-
tributor to non-malignant disease including obstructive lung
disease, while in non-Native populations, smoking was the
major contributor. More than 70% of Navajo miners had never
smoked (compared to 23% of NHW miners) [80]. However,
compensation through the government’s Radiation Exposure
Compensation Act, discriminated against Native miners by
Curr Envir Health Rpt (2017) 4:130–141
135
 requiring, in addition to radiographic evidence of lung dam-
age, a second measure of spirometry less than 75% of a com-
parison value derived from a NHW population. Clinical re-
searchers demonstrated that using that criterion to determine
loss of function resulted in exclusion of 24% of Native miners
who would qualify with a 75% reduction in lung function if
Native American-based function formulas were used [80].
Other studies concluded that Colorado Plateau Native
American uranium miners disproportionately suffer excess
mortality risks from lung cancer [81, 82]. Native Americans
were a substantial portion of the underground workforce, and
it has been argued that the observed differences in effect re-
lated to a higher exposure. Disease rates reported above, how-
ever, were corrected for exposure, and Native miners were
shown to have significantly lower average lifetime mining
exposure than NHWs and Hispanics [80]. As many as 4000
Navajo men worked in the uranium mines and mills and hun-
dreds of Navajo miners died and continue to die of lung cancer
and other respiratory disease [83, 84], essentially wiping out a
generation of Navajo men in some communities and leaving a
legacy of psychological and environmental trauma [84]. The
increased toxicity to Native miners underscores the potential
for unique sensitivities to toxicants within the Native commu-
nity as compared to all races results, questioning the deriva-
tion of standards on the basis of data collected from other
populations.
While the fights over RECA proceeded, people living in
Navajo communities continued to be chronically exposed to
waste from the 520 abandoned uranium mines, 4 abandoned
uranium mills, and more than 1100 waste sites [85] in and
proximal to their communities. Uranium mine waste presents
a unique hazard resulting from the associated radioactive de-
cay chain introducing additional contaminants including radi-
um, thorium, and radon to the already complex mixture of
associated metals often including, for example, arsenic, cad-
mium, and lead [86]. The lack of regulation and security of
waste associated with these facilities and abandoned sites, as
well as lack of concern during the operational phase led to the
use of contaminated material in the construction of homes
[85], as well as contamination of water sources potentially
used for drinking [59]. Looking at >1300 Navajo community
members with and without exposure to uranium mine waste,
we find a significant strong association between exposures
occurring during the active mining era (1940s–1980s) and
later development of kidney disease, exposure more than dou-
bling the odds ratio. For those exposed to legacy waste, con-
trolling for the mining era exposures, exposure is significantly
associated with an increased likelihood of hypertension and of
developing one or more chronic diseases including hyperten-
sion, diabetes, and kidney disease [87••]. Serum from a subset
of >200 individuals from that cohort, representing a full range
of exposure, showed a significant inverse relationship be-
tween inflammatory potential in cellular bioassays and
distance from legacy waste sites consistent with induction of
pathways that contribute to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
disease [88]. While risk factors traditionally considered for
these diseases clinically were also significant predictors, these
results underscore the need for clinicians to probe for infor-
mation about exposure as well in identifying those at risk.
Ongoing Concern for Future Generations
Among Native communities, there is concern about not only
the health of people living in impacted communities today but
also the health of generations yet to come. The Women of All
Red Nations (WARN) worry that uranium mining may con-
tribute to high rates of miscarriage and reproductive cancers
observed among Lakota women [89]. While studies of direct
impacts of mine waste exposures on tribal lands have been
extremely limited, several recent initiatives are beginning to
fill these gaps.
A 1981 study in Navajo babies showed that congenital
anomalies, developmental disorders, and other adverse birth
outcomes were associated with maternal proximity to uranium
mining operations, tailings, or mine dumps [90]. Uncertainties
in these results were not followed up until 2010 when the
Navajo Birth Cohort Study (NBCS) [37••, 91] was initiated
as part of a Congressional Five-Year Plan to Address Uranium
Contamination on Navajo [92]. The NBCS is a prospective
assessment of the effect of exposure to uranium and co-
occurring metals in mine waste on birth outcomes and
neurodevelopment through 1 year of age conducted as a part-
nership with the University of New Mexico, Southwest
Research Information Center, Navajo Nation Indian Health
Service, Navajo Nation Department of Health, and funders
CDC/ATSDR. This is the first prospective birth cohort ad-
dressing the impacts of environmental contamination on birth
outcomes in a Native population. Preliminary data confirm
exposures to uranium prenatally and over the first year of life.
The recently funded NIH National Environmental Influences
on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) initiative will include
both the NBCS and a Sioux cohort in this national synthetic
cohort of more than 50,000 children, allowing assessment of
the relationship of metal exposure, neurodevelopment, and
other outcomes through at least age 5. ECHO will also allow
determination of unique sensitivities within these tribal popu-
lations through comparisons of exposure-toxicity relation-
ships across cultures, races, and lifestyles.
Two of five NIEHS/NIMHD/USEPA P50 Centers of
Excellence in Environmental Health Disparities funded in
2015 focus on multiple Native American populations and
metals exposures. These centers will also help to identify
unique exposure pathways, understand the biogeochemical
characteristics of metal mixtures, and document mechanisms
of toxicity.

 These multigenerational studies using common methods
and involving Native American communities in data collec-
tion and interpretation at all stages begin to answer the
longstanding questions on health, and, importantly, to build
capacity for investigation of these questions by tribal
researchers.
Ethical, Scientific, and Policy Challenges
to Increasing Native American Research
To fully understand the impacts of abandoned mine waste and
to inform policies that protect tribal populations from future
adverse health impacts, the body of scientific studies will need
to incorporate more tribal studies, incorporate cultural and
traditional practices into assessments of toxicity, and better
understand unique responses in these populations. This
broader inclusion, however, comes with its own challenges.
The recognition of treaties granting sovereign status to trib-
al nations within the USA brings with it rights of tribes to
control the research process through their own institutional
review boards, to mandate that all data and specimens gener-
ated through research remain the property of the tribe, and to
mandate conditions for data sharing and certain types of anal-
yses, such as genetic analyses. Recent requirements of the US
National Institutes of Health (NIH), the major funders of
health research in the USA, require sharing of all data collect-
ed with public funds, and often require investigators to obtain
consent for genetic analyses, creating cultural conflicts be-
tween the tribes and research funders. Models are emerging,
however, that show these issues are not insurmountable.
Alaska Natives have developed a biospecimen and data repos-
itory that stores all samples and data collected on Alaska
Natives and controls future use through a board on which
Alaska Natives are in the majority [93]. NIH recognition of
the importance of these concerns is supported by their creation
of a Tribal Research Office within the office of the director,
currently led by a Native molecular biologist [94].
Tribal demands previously seen as challenging, such as
involvement of tribal communities in all phases and aspects
of research; insistence on honest communication of research
goals and progress throughout the study; and ensuring re-
search has benefits for tribal communities by informing policy
for improved health care and prevention of future health im-
pacts are now consistent with best practices for environmental
health studies as discussed in the Ethics Guidelines for
Environmental Epidemiologists [95]. While recognition of
the need to include tribal populations in research has grown
in the federal agencies and research community, grant re-
viewers even recently have expressed ethical concerns over
funding research in Native American populations because it
will not be generalizable. Additional education and guidance
to point out the ethical fallacy in the current practice of
generalizing dominant culture results to policies affecting trib-
al populations may be necessary before equity is achieved.
Conclusions and Future Research Directions
The abandoned mines on and near Native lands in the Western
USA are but one in an ongoing series of insults. The sheer
number of mines and the volumes of waste guarantee that the
legacy will persist for generations to come. In addition, the
mines present only one chapter in the history of environmental
injustices on Native lands. Similar articles could be written
focusing on impacts to tribal lands from coal strip mining,
from the legacy of military bases, and from oil and gas devel-
opment. The support from thousands representing tribes
across the country for the Standing Rock Sioux camp oppos-
ing the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 is indicative of the
common theme felt by tribes not only in the Western USA but
throughout the country and the world where treaty rights to
protect health and culture have been continually challenged
and eroded in favor of resource development.
In spite of the recognized threats to tribal health posed by
these ongoing toxicant exposures, and the demonstrated risk
factors that put tribal populations in a position of increased
vulnerability, research to understand the health impacts has
been hampered by the small sizes of the communities, re-
viewers concerns about generalizability of results, and in
some cases by the distrust of research within tribal communi-
ties who have witnessed researchers build careers but leave
nothing behind to improve the health of the population. In
contrast to the identified risks, the strength and support de-
rived from the maintenance of culture, ceremonies, and tradi-
tional lifestyles may also provide a resiliency to offset some of
the adverse effects. Understanding how these factors interact
is critical to designing effective interventions to protect health
benefitting all populations.
The history of mining in the Western USA and the legacy
that affects so many Native American communities highlight
the need for not only better inclusion of tribal populations in
toxicologic studies but also in using these data in the develop-
ment of standards that ensure the cleanup of the sites is truly
protective of the health of the tribes. Ongoing studies point
increasingly to the fact that the mixed metal wastes from these
mines continue to have multigenerational impacts to the health
of Native tribes. Our work and others have shown that metals
can inhibit DNA-repair processes [96, 97••, 98, 99, 100] and
induce immunotoxicity [101–104], providing important clues
into the mechanisms by which these mixtures affect health.
Through understanding the mechanisms by which these effects
occur and understanding the role of exposures in the health
disparities seen in these communities, effective interventions
can be designed to protect populations for the decades likely
to remain before the mine waste is removed or remediated.
