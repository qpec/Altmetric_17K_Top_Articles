Despite calls to incorporate population science into neuroimaging research, most studies
recruit small, non-representative samples. Here, we examine whether sample composition
influences age-related variation in global measurements of gray matter volume, thickness,
and surface area. We apply sample weights to structural brain imaging data from a
community-based sample of children aged 3–18 (N = 1162) to create a “weighted sample”
that approximates the distribution of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and sex in the
U.S. Census. We compare associations between age and brain structure in this weighted
sample
to
estimates
from
the
original
sample
with
no
sample
weights
applied
(i.e., unweighted). Compared to the unweighted sample, we observe earlier maturation of
cortical and sub-cortical structures, and patterns of brain maturation that better reflect
known developmental trajectories in the weighted sample. Our empirical demonstration of
bias introduced by non-representative sampling in this neuroimaging cohort suggests that
sample composition may influence understanding of fundamental neural processes.

ost neuroimaging studies rely on relatively small sam-
ples that are not representative of a well-defined target
population. This has resulted in multiple calls to
incorporate population science approaches into neuroimaging
research1, 2. To date, however, the impact of convenience sam-
pling on neuroimaging findings has not been examined empiri-
cally. In the current study, we address this need by examining
whether sample composition influences age-related variation in
brain structure among children in the United States.
All participants in research studies are drawn from target
populations, even if study investigators do not explicitly define or
enumerate that population. Even when a target population is
defined (e.g., adults between the ages of 25 and 40 in the United
States), study participants are unlikely to represent that target
population unless they are randomly selected. Decades of meth-
odological work in epidemiology and population science has shed
light on the conditions that limit generalizability of findings gen-
erated from such non-representative samples3–5. This work sug-
gests that sample composition may influence a study’s conclusions
when the association between the independent and dependent
variable (e.g., age and brain structure) differs between those
selected into the study and those who are eligible from the target
population but not included6, 7. Such a scenario is likely to occur
when study participants do not represent the target population in
characteristics known to influence neural structure or function, for
example, socioeconomic status (SES)8. Participants recruited into
neuroimaging studies are not typically selected to be representative
of a known target population, under the assumption—implicit or
explicit—that basic neural functions (e.g., visual processing) in
healthy individuals are not influenced by sample characteristics.
Study findings are often assumed to reflect universal aspects of
brain structure and function regardless of the sampling strategy.
However, this assumption is largely untested and likely false.
There are exceptional examples of neuroimaging studies that
have attempted to select representative samples9, 10; however,
logistical challenges and study design decisions reduce the gen-
eralizability of findings from these studies to the broader U.S.
population. In the foundational NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain
Development, investigators selected a sample representative of the
population in the study areas9; however, this study included
numerous exclusion criteria (e.g., the presence of clinically sig-
nificant mental health symptoms) that reduced the true repre-
sentativeness of the sample2. The more recent NKI Rockland
study was also designed to minimize sampling bias and maximize
generalizability and included a representative sample of children
and adults from Rockland County, NY10. Although this study
represents a considerable advance toward representative sampling
in cognitive neuroscience, participants were from a single geo-
graphic location and had higher levels of SES than in the U.S.
population overall, indicating that this sample does not fully
represent the U.S. While sample composition has become a
growing area of focus in neuroimaging research1, 2, to date there
are no neuroimaging studies based on a representative sample of
the U.S. population.
Here, we test the hypothesis that the use of non-representative
samples in neuroimaging studies may influence interpretation of
the association between age and brain structure. Age-related
variation in brain structure in childhood and adolescence has
been examined frequently in cognitive neuroscience. Prior studies
have demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in the pattern of
developmental change across brain structures and in the age at
which peak thickness and surface area are reached for different
cortical regions11–15. In the current study, we use a large neu-
roimaging data set of typically developing children, the Pediatric
Imaging, Neurocognition and Genetics (PING) study16, to
examine whether sample composition influences age–brain
structure associations. We use 2010 U.S. Census data to estimate
the national distributions of basic socio-demographic character-
istics (i.e., race/ethnicity, age, sex, parental educational attain-
ment, and income) for children in the age range of the study
sample (3–18 years). We apply sample weights based on these
distributions to the PING sample using a common epidemiolo-
gical and survey method procedure called raking to create a
weighted PING sample that approximates a representative sample

 of the U.S. To determine the impact of sample composition on
age-related variation in brain structure, we compare associations
of age with global and regional measures of gray matter structure
in the original, unweighted PING sample (i.e., non-representa-
tive) to those from the weighted PING sample (i.e., more repre-
sentative). We focus our analysis on global morphometric cortical
gray matter measurements as well as measurements of each lobe
of the brain. Specifically, we examine cortical volume, cortical
surface area, and cortical thickness for the entire cortex and for
the right and left hemispheres; we additionally examine cortical
surface area and thickness of frontal, parietal, temporal, and
occipital lobes. These are robust metrics of brain structure that
are measured with high reliability relative to specific cortical
regions17. We also examine the volume of three widely studied
subcortical
structures—amygdala,
hippocampus,
and
basal
ganglia—as well as total subcortical volume to determine whether
sample composition has a greater influence on cortical vs. sub-
cortical regions and on global vs. specific measures.
Our results suggest that sample composition alters the inter-
pretation of how cortical and subcortical areas vary with age. In
the weighted sample, we frequently observe cubic (S-shaped)
developmental patterns for cortical surface area and subcortical
volume and younger ages of peak surface area and volume
compared to the unweighted sample. In contrast, we primarily
observe quadratic (U-shaped) developmental trajectories and
older ages at peak cortical surface area and subcortical volume in
the unweighted sample. Our findings empirically demonstrate
observable impacts of sample composition on cognitive neu-
roscience findings, even for questions about fundamental pro-
cesses such as age-related change in neural structure.
Results
Demographic characteristics in PING and the U.S. population.
We estimated the distributions of categorical socio-demographic
variables in the U.S. Census, the unweighted PING sample, and
the weighted PING sample after applying a generalized, model-
based raking procedure (Table 1). Raking is a sample weighting
method that generates sample weights for each individual parti-
cipant based on observed characteristics of the target population
(in this case, children in the U.S.), so that the weighted sample
better reflects the distributions of characteristics in the target
population that are included in the weighting procedure18, 19. We
used the distributions of race/ethnicity, sex, parental educational
attainment, and income from the U.S. Census to weight the PING
data so that our weighted sample better approximates a repre-
sentative sample of children in the U.S. Compared to population
totals derived from the U.S. Census for children aged 3–18 years,
the unweighted PING sample had fewer participants of European
Caucasian descent (42 vs. 70%) with a greater proportion of
Hispanic (24 vs. 8%) and multiple race participants (15 vs. 4%;
see Table 1). PING participants were also from higher SES
families with a higher percentage of parents making $100,000/
year or more (38 vs. 26%) and with greater parental education (35
vs. 11% of parents with post college degrees). After weighting,
there were no differences between the weighted PING sample and
the U.S. population in the distributions of race/ethnicity, sex,
parental education, or parental income. Because the same parti-
cipants were included in both unweighted and weighted samples
(i.e., the samples are not independent), distributions between
these samples cannot be statistically compared20. However, the
descriptive comparisons above demonstrate: (1) that there are
socio-demographic differences between the unweighted PING
sample and the U.S. population; and (2) that the weighted PING
sample is similar to the U.S. population with regard to the socio-
demographic characteristics included in the raking procedure.

 neural structure, we used the Akaike information criteria (AIC) to
identify the best-fitting model for the association between age and
brain structure in both the unweighted and weighted PING
sample. AIC provides a quantitative summary assessing how well
a statistical model aligns with the underlying data compared with
other models of the same data. It is commonly used for model
selection (e.g., selecting covariates that provide the best fit to the
data)21, and is a standard method for determining model fit22–24.
Consistent with prior investigations of age-related changes in
brain
structure11–15,
we
compared
different
patterns
of
age-related variation by sequentially adding more complex
polynomial terms for age into models of brain structure in the
unweighted and weighted data. Including only age in the model
assumes a linear relationship between age and brain structure; the
addition of a quadratic term (i.e., age and age2) generates a
curved, U-shape relationship; and the addition of a cubic term
(i.e., age, age2, and age3) generates the shape of an S-shaped sine
wave. All three of these patterns have been observed in prior
studies of age-related change in brain structure in children11–15.
For each measurement of brain structure (total, right and left
hemispheric cortical volume; total, right and left hemispheric
cortical surface area; total, right and left mean hemispheric
cortical thickness; frontal, occipital, temporal, and parietal lobe
measures of cortical area and thickness; total subcortical volume,
amygdala, hippocampal, and basal ganglia volume), we compared
AIC between models that included age (linear); age and age2
(quadratic); and age, age2, and age3 (cubic), and determined the
lowest AIC across models in both the unweighted and weighted
sample. If models that included more parameters than a linear
parameter reduced AIC by at least 2.5 points, the more complex
model was selected as a better fit to the data25. Throughout the
results, the “best-fitting” model for the unweighted and weighted
data refers to the model identified using this method. We report
model
fit
statistics
for
all
models
examined
(Table
2;
Supplementary Tables 2–5). To illustrate differences between
the best-fitting unweighted and weighted models, we used
parameter estimates from these models to generate predicted
values for each brain structure metric by age and graphed these
results (Figs. 1–5)26. Finally, we estimated the difference in age at
peak area and volume between the unweighted and weighted
models by calculating the first-order derivative of the fitted curves
where appropriate (i.e., for quadratic and cubic models) (Table 3).
These are common metrics derived from best-fitting regression
models in developmental cognitive neuroscience14,
27. We
describe differences in the best-fitting models, predicted values,
and age at peak area and volume across the unweighted and
weighted samples for each of these metrics (see “Methods” for full
modeling approach).
Age-related variation in cortical volume. For total cortical
volume (range: 382,286–753,561 mm3), the best-fitting model
included a quadratic age term in the unweighted data and a cubic
age term in the weighted data (Table 2). For example, in the
unweighted data a model that included both linear and quadratic
age terms was a better fit for total cortical volume (AIC =
24167.07) compared to a model with only a linear age term
(AIC = 24177.19); adding a cubic age term (AIC = 25087.24) did
not improve model fit. In the weighted data, a model that
included a linear, quadratic, and cubic age term (AIC = 25087.24)
provided the best fit to the data when compared to a model
including a linear term only (AIC = 25103.89) and a model with
both a linear and quadratic term (AIC = 25092.66). For both right
and left hemispheric cortical volume (left range: 189,847–375,672
mm3; right range: 192,439–377,889 mm3), the best-fitting models
were also quadratic in the unweighted data and cubic in the
weighted data (Supplementary Table 2).

 weighted: 628,575 mm3), a more rapid decline in volume after age
6 (unweighted: βage = −5832.8, SE1 = 281, βage^2 = −239.9, SE2 =
69; weighted: βage = −8017.4, SE1 = 650, βage^2 = −275.0, SE2 = 71,
βage^3 = 48.1, SE3 = 18), and an age at peak cortical volume that
was 0.8 years earlier in the weighted models as compared to the
unweighted models (Table 3; Fig. 1a). For left and right
hemispheric cortical volume, we observed a similar pattern and
an age at peak volume that was also 0.8 years earlier in the
weighted data compared to the unweighted data (Table 3;
Fig. 1b, c).
Age-related variation in cortical thickness. The best-fitting
models for total cortical thickness (range: 2.28–3.32 mm) inclu-
ded a cubic age term in both the unweighted and weighted data
(unweighted: βage = −0.026, SE1 = 0.002, βage^2 = 0.001, SE2 =
0.0002, βage^3 = 0.0001, SE3 = 0.00; weighted: βage = −0.026, SE1 =
0.002, βage^2 = 0.0001, SE2 = 0.0002 (p = 0.55), βage^3 = −0.0001,
SE3 = 0.00) (Table 2). Given the small parameter estimates
associated with the quadratic and cubic age terms in the
unweighted and weighted models, graphs of the predicted values
indicate that these trajectories are effectively linear and decreasing
with age (Fig. 2a). For example, a 1-year increase in age was
associated with an approximately –0.029 change in total cortical
thickness in both the unweighted and weighted data. Results for
left (range: 2.30–3.32 mm) and right (range: 2.27–3.32 mm)
hemispheric cortical thickness were similar to those for total
thickness, with small parameter estimates for quadratic and cubic
age terms, indicating an effectively linear decrease in thickness
with increasing age in both the unweighted and weighted data
(Fig. 2b, c; Supplementary Table 2).
Analyses of frontal, occipital, temporal, and parietal lobe
thickness yielded several differences in the age terms included in
the best-fitting models for the unweighted and weighted data
(Supplementary Table 3). However, overall, patterns across lobes
and between unweighted and weighted data were similar to what
was observed with total cortical thickness, indicating primarily
linear and decreasing associations between age and lobe-specific
measures of cortical thickness in both the unweighted and
weighted data (Fig. 3a–h; Supplementary Table 3).
Age-related variation in cortical surface area. For total cortical
surface area (range: 125,796–240,251 mm2) the best-fitting model
was quadratic in the unweighted data and cubic in the weighted
data
(unweighted:
βage = 806.1,
SE1 = 132.1,
βage^2 = −242.6,
SE2 = 32.2; weighted: βage = −609.0, SE1 = 301.6, βage^2 = −197.7,
SE2 = 32.6, βage^3 = 31.7, SE3 = 8.2) (Table 2). The graph of the
predicted total surface by age (Fig. 2d) and age at peak surface
area calculations (Table 3) demonstrate differences between the
unweighted and weighted data, including an earlier age at peak
total cortical surface area in the weighted model (9.7 years)
compared to the unweighted model (12.1 years). For left and right
hemispheric cortical surface area, best-fitting models were also
quadratic in the unweighted data and cubic in the weighted data
(Fig. 2e, f; Supplementary Table 2); we observed an age at peak
volume that was also 2.4 years earlier in the weighted data
compared to the unweighted data (Table 3).
For frontal, occipital, temporal, and parietal lobe surface area,
we observed several differences in the best-fitting models across
the unweighted and weighted data (Supplementary Table 4). For
left and right frontal, occipital, and temporal lobes, the best-fitting
model was quadratic in the unweighted data and cubic in the
weighted data (Fig. 4a–h; Supplementary Table 4). First-order
derivative calculations revealed that age at peak surface area for
the occipital lobes occurred 4.1 (left hemisphere) and 3.5 (right
hemisphere) years earlier in the weighted data than in the
unweighted data (Table 3). The age a peak surface area was
2.0–2.1 years earlier for the right and left temporal lobes, and
1.5–1.8 years earlier for the right and left frontal lobes in the
weighted compared to unweighted data (Table 3). For the left and
right parietal lobe, the best-fitting model for both the unweighted
and weighted data was cubic (Supplementary Table 4). However,
both the predicted value graphs (Fig. 4e, f) and first-order
derivative calculations (Table 3) indicated an earlier age at peak
surface area (1.1–1.2 years) in the weighted data than in the
unweighted data.

 We also observed differences between the unweighted and
weighted data in the relative age at peak surface area for each lobe
of the brain. In the unweighted data, the frontal, occipital, and
temporal lobes had similar ages at peak surface area (12.3–13.1
years), and only the parietal lobe reached peak area earlier in
childhood (9.7–9.8 years). In contrast, the weighted data
indicated an earlier age at peak area for the occipital and parietal
lobes (between 8.6 and 9 years), followed by the temporal lobes
(10.2–10.7 years), with frontal lobes maturing last (10.8–11.0
years).

Differences
between unweighted and weighted data were also observed for
total subcortical volume (range: 38,943–73,300 mm3). The best-
fitting model was quadratic in unweighted data and cubic
in weighted data (unweighted: βage = 398.7, SE1 = 27.0, βage^2 =
−38.0,
SE2 = 6.6;
weighted:
βage = 85.8,
SE1 = 59.7,
βage^2 = −42.9, SE2 = 6.5, βage^3 = 7.3, SE3 = 1.6) (Table 2, Fig. 5a),
with age at peak subcortical volume occurring 3 years earlier in
the weighted data (9.4 years vs. 12.1 years) (Table 3). For the
amygdala and basal ganglia, differences between best-fitting
models in unweighted and weighted data followed this same
pattern (Fig. 5b, c; Supplementary Table 5). Age at peak volume
was 4 years earlier for the amygdala and 2.4 years earlier for the
basal ganglia in the weighted data compared to the unweighted
data (Table 3). Though best described by a quadratic model in
both the unweighted and weighted data, age at peak hippocampal
volume followed a similar pattern as the other subcortical
structures (Fig. 5d; Supplementary Table 5), with peak volume
occurring 1.7–2.4 years earlier in the weighted compared to
unweighted data (Table 3).
We note that in cubic models for both cortical surface area and
subcortical volume, the tails of the distributions in the predicted
models exhibit more variability than for linear and quadratic fits.
For some outcomes, this resulted in a model that describes an
increase in brain volume or surface area during late adolescence.
This variability in the tails of the distribution is likely a function
of sparse data and thus we caution inference from these models at

this upturn in late adolescence is not observed11, 14. Therefore, we
did not interpret results from these highly variable tails of our age
distribution.

volume, and the pattern of age-related change. Differences in age-

 volume, and subcortical volume but were more pronounced for
lobe-specific measures of cortical surface area and for specific
subcortical regions. Given that convenience sampling remains a
common practice in neuroimaging research, our findings may
have far-reaching implications for cognitive neuroscience studies.
Our descriptive results suggest that even large, community-
based neuroimaging studies with multiple sites across the country
will reflect the distributions of important socio-demographic
characteristics of the U.S. population only if an explicit, repre-
sentative sampling strategy is applied. This confirms what many
neuroscience researchers suspect1 but rarely examine: neuroi-
maging studies implemented without an explicitly defined target
population and appropriate sampling strategy rely on samples
that differ in fundamental ways from the population of interest.
In our study, PING participants had notably higher parental
income and education and substantially different racial/ethnic
composition than children of the same age in the U.S. population.
Therefore, results from our unweighted models only generalize
(or are transportable)5 to the implicit target population of the
PING study, which is undefined and has substantially different
characteristics than the U.S. population as a whole. Although
several innovative studies have attempted to generate more
representative samples of smaller geographic regions9, 10, this lack
of generalizability is a fundamental characteristic of many cog-
nitive neuroscience studies, which primarily rely on convenience
samples11–15.
Across measures of cortical surface area, cortical and sub-
cortical volume, we observed a relatively consistent pattern of
differences between the unweighted and weighted samples in
estimates of age-related variation. The unweighted models were
more likely to be quadratic, reflecting a gradual increase and then
decline in lobe-specific surface area across age, whereas the
weighted models were more likely to be cubic, reflecting a more
rapid increase in early/middle childhood followed by a tapering
off in adolescence. This cubic pattern mirrors developmental
change in other arenas (e.g., cognition) where rapid change is
followed by periods of relative quiescence28. We also observed
differences between the unweighted and weighted samples in the
relative timing of cortical surface area development. In the
unweighted data, the parietal lobe reached peak area first, fol-
lowed by the temporal, occipital, and frontal lobes, which reached
peak area around the same age. The pattern observed in the
weighted data—with the occipital and parietal lobes reaching
peak area first, followed by the temporal and then frontal lobes—
is more consistent with what would be expected given the relative
development of cognitive functions subserved by these regions28–
31, as well as evidence of brain development progression from
sensory cortex to higher-order association cortex32. Similarly,
while the unweighted data suggested an age at peak subcortical
volume that occurred later than lobe-specific measures of cortical
surface area, the weighted data indicated the opposite pattern
with subcortical volume maturing earlier. Subcortical structures
are thought to develop both phylogenetically and ontogenetically
earlier than cortical regions, and are generally understood to
subserve basic emotion and learning functions that are intact
early in development and are critical for survival, such as fear and
reward learning as well as other forms of explicit and implicit
learning33–35.
To further contextualize the impact of sample composition on
age-related variation in brain structure in our study, we compare
the magnitude of differences we observed in age at peak surface
area between unweighted and weighted models to other studies of
brain structure development. In a recent study of the relative
timing of age at peak surface area across 84 regions of interest
among youth aged 7–23 years, the earliest maturing regions
reached peak surface area at age 8 compared to the latest

 maturing regions, which reached peak area at age 11 (i.e., a 3
years difference between the earliest and latest maturing regions
across the entire brain)27. We observed differences in age at peak
surface area of a similar magnitude for the same measure of brain
structure (e.g., surface area in the right occipital lobe) simply by
applying sample weights to better reflect the demographics of the
U.S. population. This suggests that sample composition may have
a meaningful influence on metrics that are commonly derived
from best-fitting regression models in developmental cognitive
neuroscience.
Because the weighted data yielded a different interpretation of
associations between age and brain structure, we can infer that
these relationships were not uniform across the levels of socio-
demographic characteristics included in our sample weighting
procedure (i.e., child sex and race/ethnicity, parental education,
parental income). The distributions of parental education and
parental income in the original PING sample were substantially
different from the U.S. Census distributions, and there is growing
evidence that childhood SES is associated with brain structure,
including cortical surface area8, cortical thickness8, and hippo-
campal volume8, 36. Furthermore, while there is limited research
examining the extent to which SES modifies associations between
age and brain structure, there is some evidence suggesting that
low SES is associated with earlier and more rapid declines in
frontal and temporal gray matter volume37. Indeed, the pattern of
findings in our weighted data is consistent with an interpretation
of earlier or faster brain maturation among low-SES children who
were under-represented in the PING data; this is consistent with
accumulating evidence that being raised in a resource-deprived
environment
accelerates
development38,
39.
However,
it is
important to note that our goal in the present analysis was not to
attribute differences in the age–brain structure relationship to
particular socio-demographic characteristics or to determine
which characteristics are most important to include in weighting
algorithms; rather, our findings highlight how sample composi-
tion across a number of basic socio-demographic characteristics
may influence the answers obtained when examining funda-
mental questions in cognitive neuroscience and to whom those
findings generalize.
One limitation of this study was that the PING sample was not
representative of children in the U.S.40. In a true representative
sample of children, the distribution of unmeasured characteristics
would, on average, reflect that of the U.S. Our sample weights
account for distributions of the measured characteristics of sex,
race/ethnicity, parental education, and income, but not for all
unmeasured characteristics that would render a sample repre-
sentative of a target population. Characteristics that may further
influence the age–brain structure association include birth
weight41, exposure to prenatal toxins, and exposure to traumatic
violence42; however, these characteristics were not used to con-
struct sample weights in the present study. Less frequently studied
characteristics may also influence age–brain structure relation-
ships. For example, PING participants were recruited from 10
urban study sites in 8 cities, leading to greater representation of
children
from
urban
and
suburban
areas
and
under-
representation of children from rural locations. Future studies
unable to implement a random sampling procedure but interested
in post-stratification weighting may choose to assess additional
participant characteristics (e.g., urban, suburban, rural) and use
weighting techniques that include more complex algorithms to
account
for
sample
characteristics
beyond
basic
socio-
demographics. However, there is no substitute for true, repre-
sentative sampling as traits endogenous to the participants that
are too numerous to measure comprehensively may influence the
likelihood of participation in samples of convenience (e.g., some
participants may be more likely to hear of and participate in the
study by word of mouth than others as a result of their social
networks). As a result, although the weighted PING sample more
closely resembles the U.S. population than the unweighted sam-
ple, it is not a truly representative sample.
The goal of our study was to demonstrate the potential impact
of sample composition on fundamental relationships in cognitive
neuroscience, not to provide the definitive answer regarding the
association between age and brain structure for U.S. children. The
PING study was well suited for this primary purpose given its
very large sample size, appropriate age range to capture dynamic
age-related differences in brain structure, and substantial geo-
graphic variability. The PING study remains the largest and most
diverse neuroimaging study of U.S. children to date.
An alternative explanation of differences between the weighted
and unweighted models is that they reflect differential motion
artifact among lower-SES children who were weighted more
heavily
in
the
weighted
sample
to
address
their
under-
representation in the unweighted sample. Although it is cer-
tainly possible that small motion artifacts contribute somewhat to
the variability across the weighted and unweighted samples,
motion is unlikely to entirely explain the observed differences for
several reasons. First, the PING study used a real-time motion
correction algorithm during data acquisition43, 44 and rigorous
quality control procedures for the T1 data that dropped subjects
with significant head motion. Second, if differential motion were
driving these effects, we would expect that motion would be
higher in the weighted sample where low-SES children had
greater representation. This would produce a pattern of reduced
cortical volume and thinner cortex in the weighted sample, par-
ticularly in the youngest children, as greater motion is associated
with reductions in cortical thickness and volume45, 46. However,
we find the opposite pattern. In the weighted data, the youngest
children have greater cortical volume than the youngest children
in the unweighted data, indicating that motion is an unlikely
explanation for these findings.
We applied a parametric modeling strategy that allowed us to
choose the best-fitting models for the unweighted and weighted
sample by using a quantitative test of model fit (i.e., AIC). This
approach was important for our demonstration because (1) it
overlaps with standard modeling approaches used in develop-
mental cognitive neuroscience11, 13–15, and (2) it allowed us to
quantitatively compare the best-fitting polynomial terms (e.g.,
linear, quadratic, cubic) across the unweighted and weighted data.
There are many methods that are well suited for developmental
cognitive neuroscience questions and could be employed to
model age-related variation in brain structure (e.g., semi-
parametric general additive models, local regression). We chose
a commonly applied method of iterative polynomial term fitting
where model fit estimates could be directly compared across
weighted an unweighted data; future work should examine
whether the application of sample weights to other methods of
estimating age-related variation in brain structure produces
similar differences in unweighted and weighted data.
Our results suggest that sample composition is likely to have a
meaningful impact on cognitive neuroscience findings for many
estimates and associations of interest; however, representative
sampling is not feasible for all cognitive neuroscience studies. We
make several suggestions that draw on population science prin-
ciples to improve the reliability and generalizability of cognitive
neuroscience findings. For small studies, we suggest that inves-
tigators follow the suggestions outlined by Falk et al.1 to improve
generalizability and comparisons across studies: (1) define the
target population; (2) comprehensively report sampling and
recruitment methodology; and (3) summarize the basic socio-
demographic characteristics of the study sample (i.e., age, race
and ethnicity, sex, and SES) at all stages of study implementation

 (i.e., compare those recruited, those assessed, and those analyzed).
In addition, a simple comparison of the distribution of socio-
demographic characteristics in the analytic sample to that of the
U.S. population or otherwise defined target population would also
help clarify to whom findings generalize, and facilitate compar-
isons between studies using different samples.
For existing, large community-based studies that aim to
address fundamental cognitive neuroscience questions, we sug-
gest that, in addition to carefully describing the sampling strategy
and socio-demographic characteristics of the sample, investiga-
tors consider applying a post-stratification weighting methodol-
ogy to their final models as we did in the current study.
Constructing sample weights is relatively straightforward and
available in multiple statistical packages including SUDAAN, R,
and SAS47. This would allow investigators to estimate the impact
of sample composition on associations of interest. If differences
between weighted and unweighted final models are small, one can
have greater confidence in the generalizability of the results; if
differences are large, associations could be reported based on a
weighted sample that is more representative of the target popu-
lation. It is important to note, however, that in addition to being
large, community-based samples well suited for post-stratification
weighting must include a diversity of participants that represent
the broader characteristics of the target population, even if not in
the same proportions as that target population. For example, it
would not be possible to weight a sample including only
non-Hispanic, white undergraduate students to represent all
adults in the U.S. population. Further, if the sample has some
diversity but there are few individuals with one of the char-
acteristics included in the weighting algorithm, this may produce
unreliable estimates of population-weighted totals. An example of
a setting in which post-stratification methods could be applied
successfully is the IMAGEN study48, which was designed to
examine genetic variation in brain and behavior, and, therefore,
included participants that minimized ethnic diversity and max-
imized diversity in SES. However, no explicit representative
sampling strategy was employed48. In studies such as this,
applying a post-stratification weighting methodology to study
questions that extend beyond the original intent and sampling
strategy (e.g., questions unrelated to genetics)49 will likely
improve generalizability of those findings.
For future, large and costly neuroimaging studies aimed at
understanding fundamental cognitive neuroscience questions, we
do not recommend that weighting be used as a solution for non-
representative
sampling.
Rather,
we suggest
the
need
for
thoughtful sampling strategies that explicitly consider the target
population of interest, and reflect an attempt to broadly recruit
and represent such populations. An example of how this might be
done in practice is observed in the National Institutes of Health
recently funded Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development
(ABCD) study, which aims to assess brain development in over
10,000 adolescents from across the country. The ABCD study
investigators intend to recruit a sample of boys and girls that
represent the U.S. population of adolescents, and have developed
a school-based recruitment strategy to accomplish this goal50. If
conducted according to plan, this will be the first neuroimaging
study that generates a true nationally representative sample, and
will help ensure that the results of the study are generalizable to
all adolescents in the United States. We suggest that this and
future large-scale neuroscience initiatives include collaboration
with population scientists (i.e., epidemiologists, demographers) to
ensure that these sampling concerns are adequately addressed
over the long term.
Finally, our study identifies a key issue that is important to
consider regarding the replication of findings in human neu-
roscience research. Thus far, concerns about replication have
primarily focused on the small sample sizes used in neuroimaging
studies that are less likely to identify a true effect51 or on the
acquisition, processing, or analysis of structural or functional
neuroimaging
data,
highlighting
inconsistencies
between
approaches52 and excessive false positive detection under some
methods53. In this very large, well-powered study of typically
developing children, we demonstrate that sample composition
can also have a meaningful influence on the results one obtains,
even when identical image preprocessing and model selection
methods are applied. Because sample composition often varies
widely between neuroimaging studies designed to answer similar
questions (e.g., a sample of college undergraduates vs. a com-
munity sample of adults), sample composition is likely an addi-
tional contributor to the replication challenges facing cognitive
neuroscience.
In summary, we find that the distribution of basic socio-
demographic characteristics within a study sample, including
race/ethnicity and SES, meaningfully influences the association
between age and brain structure. Sample characteristics are likely
to have even more relevance for studies aimed at understanding
associations of the social and physical environment with brain
structure or function, as many environmental characteristics vary
significantly by race/ethnicity and/or SES (e.g., environmental
toxin exposure, neighborhood quality,
parental availability,
exposure to violence)54, 55. Similarly, questions of interest to the
social sciences regarding the neural processes underlying cogni-
tion, emotion, and behavior are also likely to be influenced by
these fundamental social characteristics56, 57. Although there have
been many calls to improve both the reliability and general-
izability of neuroscience research1, 2, 51, these calls have largely
been ignored with regard to sampling strategies. Our findings
demonstrate that the potential impact of sample composition on
cognitive neuroscience research is not just theoretical, but in fact
clearly observable in empirical work, even for questions about
fundamental processes such as age-related change in neural
structure.
Methods
Sample. Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the PING
study database (http://ping.chd.ucsd.edu/). The primary goal of PING has been to
create a data resource of highly standardized and carefully curated magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data, comprehensive genotyping data, and develop-
mental and neuropsychological assessments for a large cohort of developing chil-
dren aged 3–20 years. Participants were recruited through online and community-
based advertising as well as word of mouth, in and around the ten PING data
collection sites in eight cities (Los Angeles, Sacramento, New Haven, Boston, San
Diego, Baltimore, New York, and Honolulu). Exclusion criteria included a history
of neurological, psychiatric, medical, or developmental disorder. All participants
gave informed consent for all study procedures; all parents provided consent and
all child participants provided consent/assent as appropriate. Each data collection
site’s Institutional Review Board and Office of Human Subjects Research approved
all procedures in this study.
A total of 1162 participants with data on neural structure who were age 3–18
years were included in our analytic sample. Parent participants reported on the
level of educational attainment for themselves and their spouse. We used the
highest reported education level in the home and created categories representing
high school degree or less, some college, college degree, and more than college.
Parents also reported on their total, yearly family income. This was divided into the
following categories: <$40,000/year (less than 200% of the poverty line for a family
of four in 2006), $40,000–$99,999/year (200–500% of the poverty line for a family
of four), and $100,000/year or more (greater than 500% of the poverty line)58.
These categories were chosen to represent meaningful levels of income59 and also
to allow us to adequately weight for the preponderance of high-income parents in
the PING study. Parents also reported on the child’s race, which was categorized as
white, black, Hispanic, multiple race, or other.
Image acquisition and processing. The MRI protocol and standardized image
processing techniques used in the PING study were designed to extract
high-quality multimodal imaging data in a multisite study of children40. For each
participant a single whole brain, T1 weighted structural magnetic resonance image
was acquired in the sagittal plane using interleaved slice acquisition. All images

 were acquired on a 3 T scanner at one of 10 different study sites using Siemens, GE,
or Philips scanners. Acquisition parameters were standardized across sites and are
detailed as follows: for Siemens: TE = 4.33 ms, TR = 2170 ms, flip angle = 7
degrees, 160 slices with 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm voxels, FoV = 256; for Philips: TE = 3.1 ms,
TR = 1665.9 ms, flip angle = 8 degrees, 170 slices with 1 × 1 × 1.2 mm voxels, FoV
= 256; GE: TE 1 = 4.0 ms, TR = 1500 ms, flip angle = 8 degrees, 170 slices with
1 × 1 × 1.2 mm voxels, FoV = 256. To reduce motion, prospective motion correc-
tion (PROMO) was applied during acquisition43. Because different scanners are
likely to have different field inhomogeneities resulting in differential sources of
image distortion, a gradient field nonlinearity correction was applied prior to
analysis40.
Cortical thickness and surface area estimates were calculated with the
FreeSurfer image analysis suite, which is documented and freely available for
download online (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). FreeSurfer morphometric
procedures are well established60–62, have demonstrated good test-retest reliability
across scanner manufacturers and field strengths63, have been validated against
manual measurement64, 65 and histological analysis66, and have been successfully
used in studies of children as young as age 467.
FreeSurfer methods applied to the processing of PING structural data included
removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation
procedure68, automated Talairach transformation, previously validated in pediatric
populations69, and segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray
matter volumetric structures, separately validated for use with pediatric
populations67, 70. FreeSurfer provided thickness and surface area estimates for 68
cortical regions (34 for each hemisphere), according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas60,
71. Labels for cortical gray matter were assigned using surface-based nonlinear
registration to a gyral and sulcal-based atlas62 and Bayesian classification rules61, 71.
For subcortical structures, an automated, atlas-based, volumetric segmentation
procedure was used to calculate volumes in mm3 for each structure, also executed
in FreeSurfer40.
Prior to inclusion in the final data set, neuroimaging data were required to pass
rigorous quality-control procedures. All images were reviewed by trained
technicians for significant motion artifacts, operator error and scanner dysfunction
within 24 h of the scan to allow for the re-scanning of participants when possible40.
T1-weighted images were examined slice by slice for any evidence of excessive
motion and rated as either acceptable or for attempted rescan40. The subcortical
segmentations, cortical parcellations, and white and pial surface reconstructions
from the processed images were also reviewed by trained staff40.
The publically available PING data set provides preprocessed, labeled, and
quality controlled structural data for cortical surface area and thickness, and
subcortical volumes based on the high-resolution T1-weighted scan. We chose to
examine global and lobe-specific measures of cortical structure as they show high
test-retest reliability and are more precisely estimated than smaller, individual
structures17. Cortical gray matter measurements included total cortical volume,
left/right hemispheric cortical volume, total subcortical volume, overall mean
cortical thickness, left/right hemispheric mean cortical thickness, total cortical
surface area, and left/right total cortical surface area. We also generated
measurements for surface area and thickness for each lobe of the brain (frontal,
occipital, temporal, and parietal) by combining regions identified in the Desikan-
Killiany atlas (see Supplementary Table 1 for a complete list of regions)60, 71. We
examined three subcortical structures—amygdala, hippocampus, and basal ganglia.
Creating sample weights. When a recruited sample does not adequately and
proportionally cover segments of a target population, sample weights can be used
so that the marginal totals of the adjusted weighted sample align with the target
population on predefined characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, SES, etc.).
A classic way in which to create this alignment is through raking18, 19. In raking,
the inverse of the marginal distribution of each variable to be included in the
weight is iteratively multiplied across individuals in the sample. Each sample
participant is then assigned a weight that is estimated as the difference between the
unweighted value and the population distribution for the set of raked estimates. For
illustrative purposes, consider two of the four variables we used for raking: sex and
race. The raking procedure is essentially accomplished by first multiplying each
individual by the inverse probability of being the sex that they are based on the
overall population distribution of sex; the resulting estimates thus match the
population distribution of sex, but not race. Then, each individual is multiplied by
the inverse probability of being the race that they are given the overall population
distribution of race. The resulting estimates thus match the population distribution
of race, but now the sex estimates may not match population distributions. We
then multiply again the individual by the inverse of the probability of their sex
based on the population, and iteratively move through this sequence until there is
convergence by which all of the weighted estimates match the population dis-
tributions within a caliper of error18, 47. The generalized raking procedure we
followed was similar but with four variables: sex, race/ethnicity, parental education,
and income, such that at the end of the procedure, the distributions of these
demographic characteristics in the weighted sample were comparable to the
population distribution of the U.S. Census in 2010. To improve the stability of
estimates and ensure that results are not sensitive to a few individuals with extreme
weights, it is traditional in raking procedures to “trim” the weights so that no
extreme observation has undue influence72. We applied such trimming to our
sample, using an initial weight to estimate interquartile ranges (IQR) of the input
sample and adjusted the weights so that no observation fell outside of 3 IQR of the
initial weight.
We estimated population totals from the American Community Survey (ACS)
Public Use Microdata Sample from 2009–2011. We then applied a raking
procedure to the data using the “WTADJUST” procedure in SUDAAN, which
employs a model-based approach and can be interpreted as a generalized raking
procedure. The equations used to estimate the post-stratification weights are
provided in the SUDAAN language manual73, and we will summarize the main
equation used for weight estimation here. Readers interested in full details of the
generalized raking procedure are encouraged to refer to the manual for more
details and full examples. We used the following equation for our post-stratification
weight73:
θk ¼ γkαk ¼ γk
lk uk � ck

ð
Þexp Akx′
kβ
�
�
uk � ck
ð
Þ þ ck � lk
ð
Þexp Akx′
kβ
�

!
In this equation and as applied to our analysis, k refers to each respondent in
the PING data for which a final weight (θk) was estimated. This final weight is a
function of γk, the weight trimming factor used to stabilize the variance of the
weighted estimates, and αk, the post-stratification adjustment. The post-
stratification adjustment (αk) is described by a vector of the socio-demographic
variables we included (x′
k, which in our model is sex, race/ethnicity, parental
education, and income) and the model parameters (β) based on a logistic function.
The remaining factors that determine the final weight are Ak, lk, uk, and ck. These
are all adjustments to improve weight stability, and include a lower bound (lk), and
upper bound (uk), and a centering constant (ck) for the weight of any individual in
the data, which is required to be between the lower and upper board. Ak is an
additional constant that adjusts the final weight for stability. In summary,
generalized raking procedures produce stable weight estimates based on a set of
user-defined parameters that control the performance of the weight, as well as user-
inputted variables that allow for the adjustment of each individual respondent so
that the weighted sample as a whole is representative of the selected characteristics
in the user-defined target population. We provide all of our statistical code as an
online supplement that includes our user-defined parameters and assumptions that
we made in the statistical model regarding weight trimming factors (see
Supplementary Data 1).
Regression models. We next estimated separate models of the association of age
with global and regional measures of gray matter structure to determine whether a
linear, quadratic, or cubic term for age provided the best fit to the data. The best-
fitting model for each measure was determined by comparing the AIC21. The more
complex model (i.e., with quadratic or cubic terms) was selected when the AIC was
at least 2.5 points lower than the AIC in for the less complex model25. AIC is
commonly used for model selection (i.e., selecting covariates that provide the best
fit to the data and selecting the best functional form of a model)22–24. Model fit
statistics determine how well a particular model aligns with the underlying data,
while taking into account the number of parameters in that model (rather than
examining the statistical significance of each parameter individually). Model fit has
long been accepted as the gold standard approach for model selection across a wide
range of scientific disciplines, including the behavioral sciences and epidemiol-
ogy24, 25; this approach is particularly well suited for deciding among models with
polynomial terms24.
All models included covariates for sex, race/ethnicity, parent educational
attainment, family income, and scanner. Models for subcortical volume
measurements also included intracranial volume (ICV). For both the unweighted
and weighted samples, we used this same model building strategy to arrive at the
best-fitting model to describe age-related variation in brain structure, so differences
between the models can be attributed to the application of the sample weighting
technique and underlying differences in the distribution of demographic
characteristics in the unweighted and weighted samples.
To determine the extent to which differences in model parameterization led to
meaningful differences in the interpretation of age-related variation between
analytic approaches, we generated predicted values for each brain measure (area,
thickness, and volume) at each age using the best-fitting unweighted and weighted
data and graphed these results. We also calculated the difference in age at peak
surface area and volume in both unweighted and weighted data where applicable
(i.e., in quadratic and cubic models) by calculating the first-order derivative of the
fitted curves. For quadratic models, we used the following formula to estimate peak
age:
MeanAge þ �a1β
2�a2β
where MeanAge is the estimated sample mean, a1β is the beta estimate for the
linear age term in the regression model, and a2β is the beta estimate for the age-
squared term from the regression model. For cubic models, we used the following

from the regression model.
The predicted value graphs are intended to help readers visualize differences
between the best-fitting unweighted and weighted data, as even models with
quadratic or cubic terms can describe patterns of variation that are effectively
linear. However, we are unable to compare aspects of these graphs (e.g., differences
in slopes) with statistical tests because they are derived from different samples. For
the same reason, calculations of age at peak surface area cannot be statistically
compared between unweighted and weighted data and are included to provide a
more tangible demonstration of how age-related trajectories in brain development
may differ as a result of sample composition. For subcortical volume, final models
also included ICV, and thus peak age was based on predicted values averaging the
estimated volume within each 2-year age interval. To examine whether differences
between unweighted and weighted models may be due to differences in head size,
we examined subcortical ICV as an outcome. For subcortical ICV, the best-fitting
models in the unweighted and weighted data were quadratic and indicated similar
rates of change with age (see Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 1).
