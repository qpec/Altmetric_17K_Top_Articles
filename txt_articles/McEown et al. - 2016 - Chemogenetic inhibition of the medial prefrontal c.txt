Abstract Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss is associated with increased consumption of
weight-promoting foods. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to mediate reward anticipation.
However, the precise role of the PFC in mediating reward responses to highly palatable foods
(HPF) after REM sleep deprivation is unclear. We selectively reduced REM sleep in mice over a 25–
48 hr period and chemogenetically inhibited the medial PFC (mPFC) by using an altered glutamate-
gated and ivermectin-gated chloride channel that facilitated neuronal inhibition through
hyperpolarizing infected neurons. HPF consumption was measured while the mPFC was inactivated
and REM sleep loss was induced. We found that REM sleep loss increased HPF consumption
compared to control animals. However, mPFC inactivation reversed the effect of REM sleep loss on
sucrose consumption without affecting fat consumption. Our findings provide, for the first time, a
causal link between REM sleep, mPFC function and HPF consumption.

Introduction
A strong link exists between insufficient sleep and weight gain. A study of more than 30,000 partici-
pants found that those who slept less than 6 hr per night were more likely to gain weight over a 1-
year period compared to people who slept 7 to 8 hr per night (Watanabe et al., 2010). Moreover,
when healthy adults obtain insufficient sleep (i.e., 5 hr per night) they are more likely to consume
weight-promoting foods compared to persons who obtain sufficient sleep (i.e., 9 hr per night;
Markwald et al., 2013). Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep loss itself may be sufficient to increase
consumption of weight promoting, highly palatable foods (HPF). Shechter et al. (2012) found that
REM sleep loss in humans, over a period of 5 d, was inversely associated with hunger ratings and fat
consumption. Indeed, increased intake of weight promoting, highly palatable foods may, over time,
lead to adverse health outcomes such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
Several studies have attempted to uncover the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for
mediating an increased desire to consume HPF in response to sleep deprivation. Healthy adults who
were subjected to one night of total sleep loss reported an increased desire to consume high-calorie
foods compared to non-sleep deprived controls (Greer et al., 2013). In addition, sleep deprivation
decreased activation, assessed by fMRI scans, in areas of the brain thought to mediate reward antici-
pation and inhibitory control, namely the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex, respectively
(Greer et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2011; Stuss, 2011). However, the relationship between brain function
and sleep loss are not consistent. For example, presentation of HPF to sleep deprived healthy adults
was not associated with anterior cingulate activation (St. Onge et al., 2014) while in other instances
a positive association was found between appetite for HPF and anterior cingulate function
(Benedict et al., 2012).

SHORT REPORT
 Therefore, the current investigation sought to determine the role of the medial prefrontal cortex
(medial PFC, mPFC) in mediating appetite for highly palatable foods in mice experiencing REM
sleep loss. To achieve this aim, we used a well-validated chemogenetic method (Lerchner et al.,
2007) to produce a modified invertebrate chloride channel (GluClab) that when activated by the
drug ivermectin (IVM) facilitates neuronal inhibition in the mPFC over several days. We then exam-
ined the effect of mPFC inactivation and REM sleep loss on appetite for HPF in mice.
Results
Wire-mesh-grid device exposure produced REM sleep loss
During the dark period, mice exposed to a wire-mesh-grid device (WMGD) in their housing cage
(Figure 1A) over a 72-hr period showed significantly less REM sleep after device introduction com-
pared to baseline polygraphic recordings obtained without the device (F3,6 = 23.835, p = 0.001;
Figure 1B and C, McEown et al., 2016). There was a significant REM sleep reduction of 58%
observed between baseline and the 25–48 hr dark time period (p = 0.026) and a 56% REM sleep
reduction observed between baseline and the 49–72 hr dark time period (p = 0.020). In addition, a
46% REM sleep reduction was found when comparing the 0–24 hr and 25–48 hr dark time periods
(p = 0.009). Moreover, we did not observe any rebound in REM sleep during the first 3 hr of the 25–
48 hr light period (all comparisons p > 0.05; Figure 1—figure supplement 1). A significant increase
in wakefulness was also produced by the device during the dark period (F3,6 = 6.886, p = 0.023).
Specifically, a 23% increase in wakefulness during the dark period was observed between baseline
and the 49–72 hr time period (p = 0.042). No differences were observed between time periods, dur-
ing the dark phase, for slow-wave sleep (SWS)—also known as non-REM sleep—(F3,6 = 4.605,
p = 0.053). In addition, differences between time periods, during the light phase, for wake (F3,6 =
1.608, p = 0.284), REM (F3,6 = 1.103, 0.418) and SWS (F3,6 = 1.434, p = 0.323) were also non-
significant.
Exposing mice to the WMGD significantly affected sleep episode numbers during the 25–48 hr
light and dark periods (Figure 2A). Specifically, WMGD exposure increased the number of SWS epi-
sodes during the light period, lasting 120 to 239 s, by 44% compared to baseline measures taken
without the WMGD (t2 = �18.898, p = 0.003). Furthermore, WMGD exposure decreased the number
of REM episodes during the dark period, lasting 60 to 119 s, by 69% compared to baseline
(t2 = 9.430, p=0.011). On the other hand, WMGD exposure increased the number of wake episodes
during the light period, lasting 30 to 59 s, by 42% compared to baseline (t2 = �4.355, p = 0.049).
The mean duration of SWS, REM sleep and wake episodes was not significantly different after
WMGD exposure (Figure 2B).
SWS electroencephalogram (EEG) power density was also affected by WMGD exposure during
the 25–48 hr light and dark periods (Figure 2C). That is, we observed increases in SWS EEG power
density, of 12% to 14%, after exposure to the WMGD during the light period at 2.5 Hz
(t2 = �51.786, p = 0.000), 22 Hz (t2 = �49.829, p = 0.000) and 24 Hz (t2 = �31.982, p = 0.001) com-
pared to baseline. We also observed increases in SWS EEG power density, of 12% to 14%, after
WMGD exposure during the dark period at 2.5 Hz (t2 = �42.819, p = 0.001), 3 Hz (t2 = �27.978,
p = 0.001), 10.5 Hz (t2 = �121.636, p = 0.000) and 11 Hz (t2 = �46.198, p = 0.000) compared to
baseline. On the other hand, we did not observe significant differences in REM EEG power density
during the 25–48 hr light or dark period (all comparisons p > 0.05; Figure 2, Panel C).
These results suggest that REM sleep is specifically reduced during the dark period in mice after
WMGD exposure for the 25–48 hr time period, or longer, and thus the WMGD may be useful to elu-
cidate the role of REM sleep loss on HPF consumption.
GluClab-mPFC neuronal inhibition reverses the effect REM sleep loss on
HPF consumption
Next, we investigated the effect of REM sleep loss on HPF consumption and whether changes in the
latter one depend on the mPFC. Therefore, we used a chemogenetic system that involves a Caeno-
rhabditis elegans glutamate-gated and IVM-gated chloride channel that was mutagenically modified
to abolish sensitivity to glutamate while retaining sensitivity to IVM (Lerchner et al., 2007). The

 altered heteromeric channel, which is made up of an a-subunit and b-subunit, prevents the firing of
action potentials by hyperpolarizing the cell membrane for several days after administration of IVM.
Two adeno-associated viruses (AAV) carrying the a-subunit or b-subunit of the IVM-gated
GluClab channel (AAV-GluCla-IVM and AAV-GluClb-IVM) were stereotaxically co-injected bilaterally
into the mPFC of wild-type mice (Figure 3A and B). To detect expression of the GluClab channel,
we labeled neurons with anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibodies to stain the fusion proteins
of the GluCla-subunit and GluClb-subunit with yellow and cyan fluorescent proteins, respectively.
Heat maps depicting AAV location and spread within the mPFC are displayed in Figures 3B and
4A. The virus successfully targeted the mPFC, for mice used in all experiments, including the cingu-
late, prelimbic and infralimbic cortices (Figure 3B). IVM-injected mice had markedly attenuated Fos
expression in the mPFC compared to mice injected with propylene glycol, indicating that the
GluClab successfully inhibited neuronal activity in the mPFC (Figure 3C). SWS, REM and wakefulness
amounts were non-significant when comparing the light and dark phases during the 25–48 hr time
period for mPFC inactivated mice to the light and dark phases of the baseline day before the IVM
injection (Figure 3D; all comparisons p>0.05).
We then examined the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption and whether changes in
sucrose consumption depend on the mPFC (F3,16 = 3.206, p = 0.051; see Figure 4, Panel B). We
compared non-sleep deprived mPFC inactivated mice to non-sleep deprived control mice and found
no difference between these groups in sucrose (propylene glycol injected mice: p = 0.391; saline
injected mice: p = 0.350) or fat consumption (propylene glycol injected mice: p = 0.575; saline
injected mice: p = 0.434); indicating that mPFC inactivation, alone, did not affect sucrose or fat con-
sumption in mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Panel A). Moreover, we found that REM sleep
loss increased sucrose consumption by 27% compared to non-sleep deprived saline injected controls
(p = 0.039) and 35% compared to non-sleep deprived propylene glycol injected controls (p = 0.033).
On the other hand, mPFC neuronal inhibition reversed the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose con-
sumption. Specifically, mPFC inactivated, REM sleep deprived mice consumed 49% less sucrose
compared to REM sleep deprived controls (p = 0.004). Whereas sucrose consumption was non-sig-
nificant between mPFC inactivated, REM sleep deprived mice and non-sleep deprived propylene
glycol injected (p = 0.205) and saline injected controls (p=0.060).
Furthermore, the effect of REM sleep loss on fat consumption was also examined and whether
changes in fat consumption depend on the mPFC (F3,16 = 7.778, p = 0.002; see Figure 4, Panel B).
We found that REM sleep loss increased fat consumption by 26% compared to non-sleep deprived
saline injected controls (p = 0.001) and 35% compared to non-sleep deprived propylene glycol
injected controls (p = 0.000). However, mPFC inhibition paired with REM sleep loss did not affect fat
consumption compared to sleep deprived controls (p = 0.199).
Baseline and follow-up weights of mice in the non-sleep deprived saline injected, non-sleep
deprived propylene glycol injected, REM sleep reduced and mPFC inactivated groups were non-sig-
nificant (Baseline: F3,16 = 0.414, p = 0.745; Follow-up: F3,16 = 0.538, p = 0.663). In addition, body
weight did not significantly change between baseline and follow-up time points for the non-sleep
deprived saline injected mice (t8 = 0.468, p = 0.652), non-sleep deprived propylene glycol injected
mice (t2 = 0.756, p = 0.529), REM sleep reduced (t3 = 0.157, p = 0.885) or PFC inactivated groups
(t3 = 0.001, p = 0.999). Finally, the amounts of sucrose (r = �0.175, p = 0.400) and fat (r = 0.246,
p =0.240) consumed were not associated with baseline body weight (Figure 4—figure supplement
1, Panel B).
Discussion
We were successfully able to mitigate the increased consumption of sucrose that resulted from REM
sleep loss. We achieved this aim by chemogenetically inhibiting mPFC function. These results are the

 first to demonstrate a clear, causative link between mPFC function, REM sleep and HPF consump-
tion. Specifically, REM sleep loss increased consumption of two highly palatable foods, namely
sucrose and fat. Whereas, mPFC inhibition completely reversed increased sucrose intake by attenu-
ating the effect of REM sleep loss on sucrose consumption. On the other hand, mPFC inhibition did
not attenuate the effect of REM sleep loss on fat consumption.
The PFC appears to play a role in mediating goal directed behavior toward highly appetitive
food stimuli. Brain circuits responsible for judging the palatability of foods such as taste, texture and
smell are mediated by areas of the PFC including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex
(Rolls, 2015). More specifically, the anterior cingulate appears to mediate taste for glucose in pri-
mates as feeding fruit juice (i.e., a high-glucose food) to satiety decreased neuronal firing in the
anterior cingulate cortex using single cell recordings, whereas initial juice feeding increased neuronal
firing in these animals (Rolls, 2008). Chocolate flavor also increases activation, as measured by fMRI,
in the anterior cingulate cortex in humans (Rolls and McCabe, 2007). In addition, obese patients dis-
play increased PFC activity in response to high-calorie visual food stimuli; specifically, increased
activity in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex (Stoeckel et al., 2008; Rothemund et al.,
2007). Alterations in PFC brain activity may, over time, result in the inability of these persons to
inhibit salient food cues leading to excess high calorie food consumption and weight gain. Our
results support these data by directly manipulating mPFC function in mice, which resulted in a sub-
stantial decrease in sucrose consumption, but had no effect on fat consumption. On the other hand,
it is unknown whether consumption of other highly palatable foods may be effected by mPFC inacti-
vation and/or REM disruption (e.g., foods high in salt content). Future research is needed to explore
this possibility. The mPFC contains heterogeneous neurons that include some inhibitory GABAergic
interneurons
(approximately
20%)
and
excitatory
pyramidal
neurons
(approximately
80%;
(Riga et al., 2014). Moreover, mPFC neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptors mediate food con-
sumption (Land et al., 2014); however, it is currently unknown what role this neuronal subtype may
play in controlling highly palatable food consumption in response to REM sleep disruption.
Furthermore, in humans REM sleep loss adversely affects dietary behavior which may lead to
weight gain. For example, REM sleep loss in humans enhances the desire to consume food and
increases food consumption (Gonnissen et al., 2013; Shechter et al., 2012). In addition, REM sleep
loss in children and adolescents, of 1 hr per night measured over three nights, was associated with a
marked increase in the likelihood of these children being overweight (Liu et al., 2008). In agreement
with these findings, we observed that reducing REM sleep, over a 25–48 hr period, during the dark
phase resulted in increased HPF consumption. On the other hand, it should be noted that, in the cur-
rent investigation, REM sleep was not effected during the light phase. It is unknown why our
observed reduction in REM sleep was restricted to the dark phase and not during the light phase.
Indeed, sleep pressure is greater during the light phase compared to the dark phase in mice; there-
fore, it is possible that our device was only able to produce REM reduction during the dark phase
when sleep pressure was weaker. In addition, the REM sleep disruption observed in the current
investigation did not occur during the first 24 hr after WMGD introduction. A plausible explanation
is that the sleep reducing effect of our device requires time to build-up and thus produce disturban-
ces in sleep.
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that mPFC inhibition reduced sucrose consumption in
REM sleep deprived mice. Our results clearly indicate that increased HPF consumption, resulting
from REM sleep loss, is mediated by mPFC function thereby providing clear findings that elucidate
the role of the mPFC and REM sleep loss in mediating unhealthy dietary behavior, which may lead
to adverse health outcomes.

 Materials and methods
Subjects and chemicals
A male mouse line on a C57BL/6 background, which was maintained at the International Institute of
Integrative Sleep Medicine and weighed between 23 and 34 g (9–10 weeks old) at the beginning of
the experiments, was used for all experiments. The animals were individually housed in insulated
sound-proof chambers maintained at an ambient room temperature of 22˚C ± 1˚C with a relative
humidity of 60 ± 2% in an automatically controlled 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 8:00, lights off
at 20:00). Food and water were available ad libitum. No method of blinding or randomization was
used for any of the experiments. This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommen-
dations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
All animals were handled according to approved institutional animal care and use committee
(IACUC) protocols (#16–359) of the University of Tsukuba. All protocols aimed to reduce the number
of animals used for each experiment and to minimize pain or discomfort. IVM was obtained from
Merial Company.
AAV vector generation
The AAV of serotype rh10 for AAV10-a-GluCl-IVM-EYFP (AAV-GluCla-IVM) and AAV10-b-GluCl-
IVM-ECFP (AAV-GluClb-IVM) were generated by tripartite transfection (AAV-rep2/caprh10 expres-
sion plasmid, adenovirus helper plasmid, and pAAV-GluCla-IVM or pAAV-GluClb-IVM plasmid) into
293A cells. After 3 days, 293A cells were resuspended in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), freeze-
thawed four times, and treated with benzonase nuclease (Millipore) to degrade all forms of DNA
and RNA. Subsequently, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the virus titre in the
supernatant was determined using an AAVpro Titration Kit for Real Time PCR (Takara) (See Figure 3,
Panel A).
Stereotaxic AAV injection and placement of EEG/EMG electrodes
Surgeries for AAV injections were conducted under pentobarbital anaesthesia (50 mg/kg, intraperi-
toneal [i.p.]). Using aseptic techniques, mice were injected stereotaxically into the mPFC (n = 14)
with recombinant GluCla-AAV and GluClb-AAV (250 nl/injection, 1.1 � 1011 particles/ml), with a
glass micropipette and an air pressure injector system (Chamberlin et al., 1998). The following coor-
dinates were used for injections into the mPFC of C57BL/6 mice according to the atlas of
Paxinos and Franklin (2001). Bilateral injections were made at 1.7 mm anterior and 0.4 mm lateral
to bregma, and 2.0 mm below the dural surface.
Mice were also chronically implanted with EEG and electromyogram (EMG) electrodes for poly-
somnography (n = 6) as previously outlined (Oishi et al., 2016). Briefly, the implant comprised two
stainless steel screws (1 mm diameter) serving as EEG electrodes, one of which was placed epidurally
over the right frontal cortex (1.0 mm anterior and 1.5 mm lateral to bregma) and the other over the
right parietal cortex (1.0 mm anterior and 1.5 mm lateral to lambda). Two insulated Teflon-coated,
silver wires (0.2 mm in diameter), which were placed bilaterally into the trapezius muscles, served as
EMG electrodes. Both EEG and EMG electrodes were connected to a microconnector, and the
whole assembly was then fixed to the skull with self-curing dental acrylic resin. Animals were allowed
one week for postoperative recovery before being placed in experimental housing cages (Figure 1,
Panel A) for a 24 hr habituation period and connected with recording leads.

 EEG/EMG recording
After the 24-hr habituation period, mice were injected with vehicle (propylene glycol, i.p.) at 16:30.
Baseline polygraphic recording commenced at 17:00 and terminated at 16:00 the following day.
After baseline recordings were obtained, mice (n = 3) were injected with IVM (10 mg/kg; i.p.) at
16:30 on the following day to initiate virus activation. Polygraphic recordings subsequently com-
menced at 17:00 for a period of 72 hr.
A separate group of EEG/EMG implanted mice (n = 3) were tested using the preceding methods
with the exception that mice did not receive AAV infusions and did not receive i.p. injections.
Instead, a wire-mesh-grid cage bottom (purchased from Oriental Yeast Company, Tokyo, Japan) was
introduced, at 16:30 the day after baseline polygraphic recording, for a period of 72 hr. The wire-
mesh-grid cage bottom was constructed from stainless steel and measured: 22 cm (length) � 19.5
cm (width) � 2.5 cm (height) with the grid consisting of 1 cm2 openings (see Figure 1, Panel A).
Vigilance state assessment based on EEG/EMG/locomotor activity
recordings
The EEG/EMG signals were amplified and filtered (EEG: 0.5–64 Hz, EMG: 16–64 Hz), then digitised
at a sampling rate of 128 Hz, and recorded using SLEEPSIGN software (Kohtoh et al., 2008) (Kissei
Comtec). In addition, locomotor activity was recorded with an infrared photocell sensor (Biotex). The
vigilance states were scored offline by 10 s epochs into three stages, including waking, SWS, and
REM sleep, according to standard criteria (Oishi et al., 2016). As a final step, defined vigilance
stages were examined visually, and corrected when necessary.
HPF data collection
HPF consumption measurements were obtained from mice that did not receive EEG/EMG electrode
implantation (n = 24). After AAV infusion, mice were singly placed into testing cages without the
wire-mesh-grid-cage bottoms for 7 days. During these seven days mice had free access to laboratory
chow. On day 8, mice were injected with IVM (10 mg/kg, i.p.; n = 4) or vehicle (propylene glycol;
n = 4) at 16:30 and singly placed back into their housing cages with the addition of the wire-mesh-
grid cage bottoms at 17:00 (Figure 1, Panel A). The highly palatable foods were introduced on day
8 and food consumption was subsequently measured every 24 hr at 17:00 over a total period of 72
hr. In addition, three controls groups were used in which one group of mice did not receive AAV
infusions and were injected with saline (n = 9), one group of mice received AAV infusions and were
injected with propylene glycol (n = 3), and one group of mice received AAV infusions and were
injected with IVM (n = 4). All three groups were not exposed to the wire-mesh-grid cage bottom (i.
e., the non-sleep deprived groups). During the 72 hr test period, all mice had free access to white
chocolate (DARS brand, Morinaga Company, Tokyo, Japan), a high-fat diet (HFD-60, Oriental Yeast
Company, Tokyo, Japan) and standard laboratory chow (see Supplementary file 1 for the composi-
tion of each highly palatable diet). Total amounts of sucrose and fat consumption were calculated
from each food type (i.e., sucrose and fat amounts from the white chocolate and from the high-fat
diet) 25–48 hr after initial food exposure.
Immunohistochemistry for GFP and Fos immunoreactive cell expression
When data collection, outlined above, was complete mice were deeply anesthetized using chloral
hydrate (500 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with saline and subse-
quently perfused with neutral buffered 10% formalin solution. Brains were then removed and placed
into vials containing 10% formalin solution for 1 week. Brains were subsequently transferred to vials
containing 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hr at 4˚C to reduce freezing arti-
facts. Brains were then frozen using dry ice, placed on a freezing microtome and sectioned at 40
mm. Immunohistochemistry was undertaken on free floating brain sections as previously described
(Lazarus et al., 2011). In brief, sections were rinsed in PBS, incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in
0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBT) for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed in PBS and incubated, over-
night at room temperature, in rabbit GFP primary antibody (Molecular Probes, RRID:AB_221569, lot
number 1293114) at a dilution of 1:20,000 or rabbit Fos primary antibody (Millipore, RRID:AB_
2106755, lot number D00058535) at a dilution of 1:20,000 in PBT with 0.02% sodium azide. After
overnight incubation, brain sections were rinsed in PBS for 1 hr and then incubated for 90 min in

 biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a dilution of 1:1000. These sections
were then treated with avidin-biotin complex (1:1000; Vectastain ABC Elite kit, Vector Labs) for 1 hr
and immunoreactive cells were visualised by reaction with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine and 0.01% hydro-
gen peroxide. Tissue sections mounted on glass slides were scanned with a Hamamatsu Nano-
Zoomer-XR Digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics), and digital photomicrographs were
analyzed with Hamamatsu NDPView software v2.4.26.
AAV location was assessed by visualizing GFP expression in brain sections using Hamamatsu
NDPView software v2.4.26. Virus location figures (see Figure 3, Panel B and Figure 4, Panel A) were
produced by using the following procedure: (a) observing virus location and spread within brain sec-
tions; (b) transforming digital photomicrographs images to color-scale images; and (c) superimpos-
ing these color-scale images to obtain a summation of AAV location for all mice.
Furthermore, Fos immunoreactive cell expression was measured using two AAV infused mice that
were injected with either propylene glycol or IVM, exposed to the WMGD for 48 hr and fed a diet of
white chocolate, HFD and chow. After WMGD exposure, mice were sacrificed during the dark period
(i.e. at 21:00). Immunohistochemistry procedures were then undertaken as outlined above. Fos
immunoreactive cell imaging, at 20 times magnification, was produced using Hamamatsu NDPView
software v2.4.26 (see Panel C, Figure 3) by focusing on an area of interest located within the mPFC
at 1.7 mm anterior and 0.4 mm lateral to bregma, and 2.0 mm below the dural surface.
Statistical analyses
Means and ± S.E.M. are expressed for all statistical comparisons. For comparisons between two
groups, two-tailed paired samples Student’s t-tests were used followed by Bonferroni corrections. In
addition, Pearson correlations were used to compare associations between two groups. Repeated
measures ANOVA or one-way ANOVA were used when comparing groups of three or more fol-
lowed by Fisher’s Probable Least-Squares Difference (PLSD) post hoc tests. For comparisons
between independent samples, the Levene’s test was used to assess homogeneity of variance and
for paired sample comparisons the Mauchly’s test was used to assess sphericity. All comparisons
were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Statistics for all data are reported in
Supplementary file 2.
