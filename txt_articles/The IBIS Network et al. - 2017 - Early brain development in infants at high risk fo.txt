Summary
Brain enlargement has been observed in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but the 
timing of this phenomenon and its relationship to the appearance of behavioral symptoms is 
unknown. Retrospective head circumference and longitudinal brain volume studies of 2 year olds 
followed up at age 4 years, have provided evidence that increased brain volume may emerge early 
in development.1, 2 Studies of infants at high familial risk for autism can provide insight into the 
early development of autism and have found that characteristic social deficits in ASD emerge 
during the latter part of the first and in the second year of life3,4. These observations suggest that 
prospective brain imaging studies of infants at high familial risk for ASD might identify early 
post-natal changes in brain volume occurring before the emergence of an ASD diagnosis. In this 
prospective neuroimaging study of 106 infants at high familial risk of ASD and 42 low-risk 
infants, we show that cortical surface area hyper-expansion between 6-12 months of age precedes 
brain volume overgrowth observed between 12-24 months in the 15 high-risk infants diagnosed 
with autism at 24 months. Brain volume overgrowth was linked to the emergence and severity of 
autistic social deficits. A deep learning algorithm primarily using surface area information from 
brain MRI at 6 and 12 months of age predicted the diagnosis of autism in individual high-risk 
children at 24 months (with a positive predictive value of 81%, sensitivity of 88%). These findings 
demonstrate that early brain changes unfold during the period in which autistic behaviors are first 
emerging.

We first reported increased brain volume in adolescents and adults with ASD over twenty 
years ago5. Subsequent reports suggested that brain overgrowth in ASD may be most 
apparent in early childhood6-8. A study of infants at risk for ASD (33 high risk and 22 low 
risk), scanned from 6 to 24 months of age, found enlarged brain volume present at 12 and 24 
months in the ten infants later diagnosed with autism at 24 months of age or later (mean age 
32.5 months)9.
In the present study, we examined data from a subset of individuals from a longitudinal 
study comprising 318 infants at high familial risk for ASD (HR), of which 70 met clinical 
best-estimate criteria for ASD (HR-ASD) and 248 did not meet criteria for ASD (HR-neg) at 
24 months of age, and 117 infants at low familial risk (LR) for ASD, who also did not meet 
criteria for ASD at 24 months (see Methods for diagnostic and exclusion criteria). The three 
groups were comparable in race/ethnicity (85% white), family income, maternal age at birth 
(33 years old), infant birth weight (8 lb), and gestational age at birth (39 weeks). The HR-

 ASD group had more males than the other two groups (83% vs. 59%) and mothers in the LR 
group had higher education level (Extended Data, Table 1).
Infants were evaluated at 6, 12 and 24 months of age with detailed behavioral assessments 
and high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to prospectively investigate 
brain and behavioral trajectories during infancy. The analyses described below were 
conducted on a subset of 106 high-risk (n = 15 HR-ASD; n=91 HR-neg) and 42 low-risk 
infants for whom all three MRI scans were successfully obtained. Based on our prior 
findings at 2 to 4 years of age2, we hypothesized that brain overgrowth in ASD begins before 
24 months of age, that overgrowth is associated with hyper-expansion of cortical surface 
area, and that these early brain changes are temporally linked to the emergence of the 
defining behaviors of ASD. Finally, we sought to examine whether differences in the 
development of brain characteristics might suggest early biomarkers (i.e., occurring prior to 
the onset of the defining behaviors of ASD) for the detection of later emerging ASD.
Primary analyses examined group differences in the trajectories of brain growth rate (Figure 
1). Total brain volume (TBV) growth rate did not differ between groups from 6-12 months 
of age. However, pairwise comparisons at 24 months showed large effect sizes for HR-ASD 
vs LR and HR-ASD vs HR-neg. The HR-ASD group demonstrated a significantly increased 
TBV growth rate in the second year compared to both the LR and HR-neg groups (Extended 
Data Table 2). In addition, the HR-ASD group showed a significantly increased surface area 
(SA) growth rate from 6 to 12 months of age compared to both the HR-neg and LR groups, 
with the most robust increases observed in left/right middle occipital gyrus, right cuneus and 
right lingual gyrus area (see Figure 2). No group differences were observed in cortical 
thickness (CT). We observed a significant correlation between SA growth rate from 6-12 
months and enlargement in TBV at 24 months of age in all subjects (r (192) = 0.59, p 
<0.001), as well as the HR only subgroup (r (139) = 0.63, p < 0.001). Raw means, standard 
deviations, and effect size for the group comparisons of TBV and SA are provided in 
Extended Data (Table 3). Regional differences in SA change rate (from 6-12 months) were 
observed in the HR-ASD group (Figure 2).
Given that the timing of TBV overgrowth in our study coincided with findings from other 
studies showing emergence of social deficits in the second year of life, we explored whether 
rate of volume overgrowth was linked to autism severity. Pearson correlations between TBV 
and behavioral measures of autism symptoms and social communication (on the Autism 
Diagnostic Observation Schedule10(ADOS) and Communication and Symbolic Behavior 
Scales11(CSBS)) were examined, adjusting for multiple comparisons.
We first examined the relationship between autistic behavior (ADOS severity score) at 24 
months and TBV change rate from 6-12 and 12-24 months in the HR groups (HR-ASD and 
HR-neg). We found no significant correlation between 24 month ADOS severity score and 
6-12 month TBV change rate (r (174) = 0.14; p =0.06); whereas a significant correlation was 
noted between 24 month ADOS severity score and 12-24 month TBV change rate (r (193) = 
0.16; p =0.03). Subsequent analyses designed to examine the components of overall autism 
severity (ADOS) during the latter interval, revealed a significant correlation between 12-24

 month TBV change rate and 24 month ADOS social affect score (r (194) = 0.17, p =0.01), 
but not ADOS restricted/repetitive behavior score (r (194) = 0.07; p =0.31).
To follow up on the above noted relationship between change in brain volume and social 
deficits in the second year, we examined the relationship between TBV change rates and 
social behavior at 24 months with an independent measure of social behavior, the CSBS. 
Consistent with the findings from the ADOS analysis, the CSBS social composite score was 
significantly correlated with a more rapid TBV change rate from 12-24 months (r (158) = 
0.18, p =0.02) in HR subjects. No significant correlations were observed between CSBS 
social composite score at 24 months and TBV change rate from 6-12 months (r (143) = 0.11, 
p =0.17).
As opposed to the ADOS, which was only administered at 24 months (the ADOS was 
primarily designed as a tool for diagnosis), measurements of social behavior were available 
from the CSBS at both 12 and 24 months. We sought to examine change in social behavior 
during this time, considering our observation of changes in brain volume during that same 
period in the HR-ASD group, and a previous report that social deficits in ASD appear to 
unfold during the second year of life3. We observed a significant group (HR-ASD vs. HR-
neg) × time (12-24 months) interaction for CSBS social composite score (F (2,130) = 10.0, p 
<0.0001). This finding was further supported by the observation that CSBS effect size 
almost tripled from 12 (d = 0.39) to 24 (d = 1.22) months.
Based on earlier findings from our group on surface area, cortical thickness and brain 
volume2, we examined whether selected MRI brain measurements at 6 and 12 months of age 
can be used to accurately identify those infants who later meet criteria for ASD at 24 months 
of age. Independent of knowledge about the results of the above analyses, a machine 
learning classification algorithm based on a deep learning network, was employed to 
investigate how well regional SA and CT at 6 and 12 months, intracranial volume (ICV), and 
sex predicted HR-ASD diagnosis at 24 months of age. We used only data from those infants 
for whom CT and SA data at both 6 and 12 months was available (HR-ASD = 34, HR-neg = 
145). A ten-fold cross-validation was employed to compute classification performance, 
where the whole classification procedure, including network training was performed 
separately in each fold (see Supplementary Information for details on method, validation, 
and comparison to other approaches).
The classification scheme distinguished the HR-ASD group from the HR-neg group in the 
cross-validation with 94% accuracy (N=168/179), 88% sensitivity (N=30/34), 95% 
specificity (N=138/145), 81% positive predictive value (PPV) (N=30/37), and 97% negative 
predictive value (NPV) (N=138/142) (Extended Data, Table 4).
Additional inspection of the trained deep learning networks suggests that contributions to the 
discrimination are mostly due to SA and not CT (or TBV or sex), particularly at 6 months of 
age, as 11 of the top 12 measures contributing to the deep learning network are regional SA 
variables and the top six are variables from 6 months of age (Figure 3, Extended Data Figure 
1).

 Our data suggest that very early, post-natal hyper-expansion of cortical surface areas may 
play an important role in the development of autism. Rate of cortical surface area expansion 
from 6 to 12 months was significantly increased in individuals diagnosed with autism at 24 
months, and was linked to subsequent brain overgrowth which, in turn, linked to the 
emergence of social deficits. This suggests a sequence whereby hyper-expansion of cortical 
surface area is an early event in a cascade leading to brain overgrowth and emerging autistic 
deficits. In infants diagnosed with autism at 24 months, surface area hyper-expansion in the 
first year was observed in cortical areas linked to processing sensory information (e.g., left 
middle occipital cortex), consistent with regions previously reported to show the earliest 
increase in SA growth rate in typically developing infants12, and with reports showing early 
sensory differences in infants who will later develop ASD13,14.
The finding of brain overgrowth in this sample of young children with ‘idiopathic’ ASD is 
consistent with an emerging literature demonstrating brain overgrowth in genetically-defined 
ASD subgroups (e.g., 16p11 deletions15, CHD816). Cellular mechanisms and heritability 
underlying SA expansion are thought to differ from mechanisms underlying cortical 
thickness17,18, and SA hyper-expansion has been reported in genetically-engineered mouse 
models of autism19. Our findings are not inconsistent with the mini-column hypothesis of 
autism20 which postulates that symmetrical proliferation of periventricular progenitor cells 
leads to an increased number of mini-columns, which may have a role in the pathogenesis of 
SA hyper-expansion and later emergence of the disorder18,21. Over-proliferation of cortical 
progenitor cells may impact other mechanisms of post-natal development (e.g., dendritic 
arborization and decreased pruning22). Fan et al. 23 showed that overproduction of upper-
layer neurons in the neocortex was associated with autism-like features in mice, and the 
16p11.2 deletion mouse has been shown to exhibit altered cortical progenitor proliferation24. 
Furthermore, an imaging study described increased brain volume in individuals with a 
16p11 deletion, a genetically-defined subgroup of individuals often presenting with 
‘syndromic autism’15. Expansion of basal progenitor cells in rodent models25 has been 
shown to regulate cerebral volume size and folding, while the dysregulation of neural 
progenitor cell proliferation has been observed in a genetically engineered mouse models 
involving ASD-associated genes (e.g., CHD8) 26. Work by Cotney et al.27 demonstrates the 
importance of CHD8 in mediating regulatory networks during neurodevelopment, and 
suggests the potential role of CHD8 in disrupting the proliferation and differentiation of 
neurons during early human brain development. Marchetto et al.28 observed increased rates 
of neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuron number compared to controls in induced 
pluripotent stem cells derived from individuals with ASD who also had increased brain 
volume on MRI28. Increased proliferation was due to dysregulation of a β-catenin/BRN2 
transcriptional cascade and associated with reduced synaptogenesis leading to functional 
defects in neuronal networks, which could be rescued by insulin growth factor 128. The 
findings in the present study together with these recent reports suggest that understanding 
the mechanisms underlying surface area hyper-expansion in the first year in human infants is 
likely to provide important insights into the downstream pathogenesis of autism.
Prediction models developed from behaviorally-based algorithms during infancy have not 
provided sufficient predictive power to be clinically useful29. We found that a deep learning 
algorithm primarily using surface area information from brain MRI at 6 and 12 months of

 age predicted the 24 month diagnosis of autism in children at high familial risk for autism. 
This finding may have implications for early detection and intervention, given that this 
period is prior to consolidation of the defining features of ASD and the typical age for 
diagnosis30. The latter part of the first and early second years of life are characterized by 
greater neural plasticity relative to later ages and is a time when autistic social deficits are 
not yet well established. Intervention at this age may prove more efficacious than later in 
development. The fact that we demonstrate group differences in surface area growth rate 
from 6-12 months, that very early surface area changes are linked to later brain overgrowth 
in the second year, and that overgrowth is, in turn, linked to the emergence of core social 
deficits in autism during this period, provides additional context to support the validity of the 
prediction model we report. The positive predictive value findings from this high risk study 
are probably conservative in nature due to the likelihood that our HR-ASD group is milder 
than those who are clinically-referred and diagnosed with ASD at 24 months of age, and that 
HR-Neg groups are known to be more heterogeneous with respect to later development of 
cognitive, behavioral, social-communication and motor deficits than typical case-control 
studies29,31-33. The algorithm described in this paper will require replication before it could 
be considered a possible clinical tool for predicting ASD in high familial risk infants, as 
false diagnostic predictions have the potential to adversely impact individuals and families. 
In addition, we do not know whether the brain differences we observed are specific to so-
called idiopathic autism or share characteristics with other neurodevelopmental disorders. 
While the findings of this study do not have direct application to the larger population of 
children with ASD who are not known to be at high familial risk for ASD, they provide a 
proof-of-principle that early prodromal detection using a brain biomarker may be possible. 
Future analyses incorporating complementary data from other relevant modalities (e.g., 
behavior, molecular genetics, electrophysiology and other imaging modalities such as whole 
brain functional MRI) may improve the accuracy of the prediction we observed.
Methods
Sample
This study includes data acquired from an NIH-funded Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE) 
network study, referred to as the ‘Infant Brain Imaging Study’ (IBIS). The network includes 
four clinical data collection sites (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of 
Washington, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Washington University in St. Louis), a 
Data Coordinating Center at the Montreal Neurological Institute (McGill University), and 
two image processing sites (University of Utah and UNC). Data collection sites had 
approved study protocols by their Institutional Review Boards (IRB), and all enrolled 
subjects had informed consent provided by parent/guardian. Infants at high (HR) and low 
familial risk (LR) entered the study at 6 months of age (a subset of HR infants entered at 12 
months) and were followed-up at 12 and 24 months. Results from 6 month brain volume 
findings have previously been reported on a subset of this sample34.
Subjects were enrolled as HR if they had an older sibling with a clinical diagnosis of ASD 
confirmed on the Autism Diagnostic Interview35 (ADI-R). Subjects were enrolled in the LR 
group if they had an older sibling without evidence of ASD and no family history of a first

 or second-degree relative with ASD. Exclusion criteria for both groups included the 
following: (1) diagnosis or physical signs strongly suggestive of a genetic condition or 
syndrome (e.g., fragile × syndrome) reported to be associated with ASDs, (2) a significant 
medical or neurological condition affecting growth, development or cognition (e.g., CNS 
infection, seizure disorder, congenital heart disease), (3) sensory impairment such as vision 
or hearing loss, (4) low birth weight (<2000 grams) or prematurity (<36 weeks gestation), 
(5) possible perinatal brain injury from exposure to in-utero exogenous compounds reported 
to likely affect the brain adversely in at least some individuals (e.g., alcohol, selected 
prescription medications), (6) non-English speaking families, (7) contraindication for MRI 
(e.g., metal implants), (8) adopted subjects, and (9) a family history of intellectual disability, 
psychosis, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in a first-degree relative. The sample for this 
analysis included all children with longitudinal imaging data processed thru 8/31/15. The 
final sample included 318 HR and 117 LR children, each with 2-3 MRI scans (Extended 
Data, Table 1).
Assessment Protocols
Behavioral assessment—Infants were assessed at ages 6, 12 and 24 months and 
received a brain MRI scan in addition to a battery of behavioral and developmental tests. 
The battery included measures of cognitive development, adaptive functioning, and 
behaviors associated with autism. Developmental level and adaptive functioning were 
assessed at each timepoint using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning36 and Vineland Scales 
of Adaptive Behavior37. Autism-oriented assessments included the Autism Diagnostic 
Interview-Revised35, Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale10 (ADOS-WPS) at 24 months 
and Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales of Development Profile11 (CSBS-DP) at 
12 and 24 months. From the CSBS, the total raw score and the social composite raw score 
were used in the brain-behavioral analyses. Raw scores were used to allow for better 
representation of the distribution of the data.
Diagnostic (outcome) classification—Diagnostic classification was made by an expert 
clinician at each site using all clinical, behavioral, and questionnaire data available at 24 
months. A diagnosis of ASD was made using the DSM-IV-TR criteria for Autism and 
Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)38 by an expert 
clinician blind to the outcome of the imaging results. Across the IBIS Network, the expert 
clinicians met quarterly for diagnostic reliability meetings (via video/telephone) using the 
DSM-IV-TR criteria independently. The rationale for this conservative approach was to 
maximize validity of diagnosis at 24 months of age39. Reliability between diagnostic raters 
was maintained throughout the project period.
HR subjects were classified as HR-neg (i.e., negative for autism) if they did not meet either 
ASD or PDD-NOS criteria on the DSM-IV-TR. In order to have a LR comparison group 
representing typically developing infants without autism, we also assessed each LR subject 
at 24 months. The LR subjects included did not meet ASD or PDD-NOS criteria on the 
DSM-IV-TR clinical best estimate assessment at 24 months. Three LR subjects met DSM-
IV criteria for ASD at their 24 month assessment (one for autism, two for PDD-NOS) and 
were excluded from the study (Extended Data, Table 5). There is strong evidence of

 differences in the underlying genetic architecture of multiple versus single incidence (or 
sporadic) cases, with the latter more often being attributed to de novo events, that support 
our exclusion of these LR-ASD subjects from a combined analysis with the HR-ASD 
subject group, who are HR infant siblings. The final HR groups included 70 HR-ASD and 
248 HR-neg, and the LR group consisted of 117 children.
MRI acquisition—The brain MRI scans were completed on 3T Siemens Tim Trio scanners 
with 12-channel head coils and obtained while infants were naturally sleeping. The imaging 
protocol included (1) a localizer scan, (2) 3D T1 MPRAGE: TR=2400ms, TE=3.16ms, 160 
sagittal slices, FOV=256, voxel size = 1mm3, (3) 3D T2 FSE TR=3200ms, TE=499ms, 160 
sagittal slices, FOV=256, voxel size = 1mm3, and (4) a 25 direction DTI: TR=12800ms, 
TE=102ms, slice thickness = 2mm isotropic, variable b value = maximum of 1000s/mm2,, 
FOV=190.
A number of quality control procedures were employed to assess scanner stability and 
reliability across sites, time, and procedures. Geometry phantoms were scanned monthly and 
human phantoms (two adult subjects) were scanned annually to monitor scanner stability at 
each site across the study period. Details on the stability procedures for IBIS and scanner 
quality control checks are described elsewhere34.
We further examined the three subject groups (HR-ASD, HR-neg, LR) for any differences in 
scan success rates (i.e., proportion of completed scans). We found a significant difference 
between groups (X2(2, N=1,305) = 16.9, p=0.02). Overall, the HR-ASD subjects had 
proportionately fewer successful scans (69%) compared to the HR-neg (78%) and LR (76%) 
groups, particularly at the 12 month visit. We hypothesize that this may be due to more 
behavioral difficulties in the ASD group (e.g., problems with sleep disturbance).
Radiologic Review—All scans were reviewed locally by a pediatric neuroradiologist for 
radiologic findings that, if present, were communicated to the participant. In addition, a 
board certified pediatric neuroradiologist (R.C.M., Washington University) blindly reviewed 
all MRI scans across the IBIS network and rated the incidental findings. A third 
neuroradiologist (D.W. S., University of Washington) provided a second blind review for the 
Washington University site, and contributed to a final consensus rating if there were 
discrepancies between the local site reviews and the network review. The final consensus 
review was used to evaluate whether there were group differences in the number and/or type 
of incidental findings. Scans were rated as either normal, abnormal, or with incidental 
findings. No scans rated as abnormal were included in the analysis, and previous 
examinations of our data did not find group differences in incidental findings34. Scans rated 
as clinically abnormal by a site pediatric neuroradiologist, and independently confirmed by 
two study pediatric neuroradiologists, were excluded (N=3).
Image Processing
Image processing was performed to obtain global brain tissue volumes, regional brain tissue 
volumes, and cortical surface measures. All image processing was conducted blind to the 
subject group and diagnostic information. The brain volumes were obtained using a 
framework of atlas-moderated expectation-maximization including co-registration of multi-

 modal (T1w/T2w) MRI, bias correction, brain stripping, noise reduction, and multivariate 
classification with the AutoSeg toolkit40 (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/autoseg/). Population 
average templates and corresponding probabilistic brain tissue priors, for white matter 
(WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were constructed for the 6 to 24 
month old brain. The following brain volumes were generated at all ages: intracranial 
volume (ICV), total brain volume = gray matter (GM) plus white matter (WM), total 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cerebrum, cerebellum, and lateral ventricles. ICV was defined as 
the sum of WM, GM, and CSF. Total brain tissue volume (TBV) was defined as the sum of 
all WM and GM contained in the brain cavity (i.e., cerebrum, cerebellum, and portion of 
midbrain/brainstem). Subjects were included in the volumetric analyses if they had 
successfully segmented scans at 6, 12, and 24 months and corresponding body length 
measures.
Cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) measures for 12 and 24 month data were 
obtained via a CIVET workflow41,42 adapted for this age using an age corrected automated 
anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas43,44. CIVET includes shrink-wrap deformable surface 
evolution of WM, local Laplacian distance and local SA, mapping to spherical domain, co-
registration using cortical sulcal features and extraction of regional measurements via a 
deformably co-registered fine-scale lobar parcellation. SA was measured at the mid-cortical 
surface. CT and SA measures for 6 month data were extracted from surfaces propagated via 
deformable multi-modal, within-subject, co-registration44 of MRI data at 12 months.
Statistical Analysis
We used Chi-square tests to examine group differences in the categorical demographic 
variables, including race, gender, social economic income categories, and mother's education 
(see Extended Data, Table 1). For the continuous variables, including birth weight, mother's 
age at child birth, children's age at visits, and behavioral measures, we used ANOVA to test 
group differences. A random coefficient piecewise longitudinal mixed model was employed 
as a coherent framework to model brain growth trajectories in the first and second year and 
to test for group differences in growth trajectories. The three outcome variables under 
investigation were total brain volume (TBV), surface area (SA), and cortical thickness (CT). 
Each model included random coefficients for the first year growth rate (6-12 months) and 
change of growth rate in the second year (12-24 months), and random intercepts for each 
child to account for individual differences and correlated repeated measures collected at 6, 
12 and 24 months. For subject i from group k at month j, the brain measure is:
The mean group growth rate in the first year will be β1k, and the growth rate for 12 months 
beyond will be β1k + β2k The inclusion of the change of slope after 12 months is to capture 
the change in growth rate from the first to the second year. The first two years of life is a 
period of rapid brain development, with growth rate being faster in the first than the second 
year45. The two-piece linear mixed model was chosen to capture the change in growth rate 
from the first to the second year. We required all subjects in this analysis to have 3

 completed scans at 6, 12, and 24 months. This reduced the HR-ASD sample from 70 to 15 
subjects. This requirement is to ensure that we captured the individual growth rate change 
from the first to the second year without the potential bias caused by partial visits and 
changes in study cohorts at different visits. We examined possible bias in the HR-ASD 
subjects with three completed visits versus those with only one or two visits and found no 
significant differences in demographic (e.g., sex, age) or outcome measure (e.g., TBV, SA). 
Results in Extended Data Tables 6 and 7.
To model the unique brain overgrowth separate from the general body growth, we modeled 
the brain growth relative to normative body growth in the first two years45,46. Normative age 
based on body length was used instead of chronological age in order to capture brain 
overgrowth in the context of body growth. The normative age for each infant's body size (tij 
length-age) was used in the model as the continuous growth variable. Length-age correlates 
highly with chronological age while taking into account the infant's sex and body size, 
which is necessary to determine the relative brain overgrowth. Sex-specific WHO height 
norms47 were used to determine length-age based on an infant's sex and height (length).
We addressed potential sex-related brain differences in two ways. First, in order to account 
for sex-related body size differences and their effects on brain volume48, we normalized 
differences in body size by using the sex specific WHO height norms. Second, we included 
sex as a covariate in the analysis model to account for remaining sex-related differences49. 
The approach to include sex as a model covariate will account for a linear, fixed effect of sex 
differences in brain volume. However, for developmental studies, the sex differences in body 
size and brain volume may be non-linear, with an unknown function form. Using a body size 
standardization based on normative sex-specific height data is more likely to account for 
non-linear sex-related differences.
The final model covariates include site and sex. Despite regular cross-site calibration in both 
behavioral and imaging protocols, a site covariate was included to account for the possibility 
of cohort differences or potential administrative differences in a multi-site study. Sex was 
included as a covariate in the analysis model to account for remaining sex-related 
differences not accounted for by sex-specific body growth. However, when we examined 
only males for group differences, our results remain unchanged (Extended Data Figure 2 and 
Extended Data Table 8).
As a sensitivity analysis, we also tested the model with other demographic, familial and 
child birth related covariates (race, social economic status, mother's education, mother's age 
at birth, birth weight, and gestational age), and only the site and sex remained in the model 
with p<0.01.
The association of 24-month clinical outcome (ADOS, CSBS) with brain growth rates 
(TBV) from 6-12 and 12-24 month intervals was assessed among HR subjects using Pearson 
correlation. Family income, mother's education, subject sex, and birth weight were examined 
as potential covariates, but none contributed significantly and were excluded from the final 
analysis.

 Multiple comparison adjustments were performed for all pairwise comparisons and the 
correlation analyses, which followed the tests for overall group differences (F test, reported 
in Extended Data Table 2). All pairwise comparisons and correlation analyses used adaptive 
Hochberg multiple comparison adjustments50. Only those comparisons that survived the 
multiple comparison adjustment and remained significant are reported (Main Text Figure 1, 
Extended Data Table 2).
The machine learning analysis used a non-linear prediction model based on a standard three-
stage deep learning network and included the following unbiased/unweighted information: 
sex, age-corrected ICV, and age-corrected SA and CT measurements from 39 left and 39 
right cortical hemisphere regions at 6 months and 12 months (approximately 312 
measurements). This analysis included 34 HR-ASD and 145 HR-neg subjects. The model 
was evaluated via a standard ten-fold cross-validation. The core of the prediction model is a 
weighted three-stage neural/deep learning network51, where the first stage reduces 315 
measures to 100, the second stage reduces 100 to 10, and the third stage reduces 10 to only 2 
such measures. At each stage, the measures (in the progressively smaller sets) are the 
weighted combination of input measures from the previous stage. In general, the training 
process determines a) those network weights that retain information that are capable of 
distinguishing the affected condition (e.g., HR-ASD) from the unaffected condition (HR-
neg), as well as b) the linear support vector machine based classification decision that 
separates the group label (HR-ASD and HR-neg) in the two dimensional final network 
space. Thus to apply the prediction model, the data is first inserted into the two-dimension 
final network space using the trained deep learning network, and then classified in the final 
network space using the trained support vector machine. All training was performed purely 
on the training data in each fold. Once training was achieved, this prediction model was 
applied to the testing data in each fold. Classification measures of accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV and NPV are combined and reported across the 10 folds. Details of our 
machine learning procedures and validity tests are provided in the Supplementary 
Information.

 For illustrative purposes, we provide plots for Total Brain Volume (TBV) for males and 
females from the same sample. Figure 1 shows the longitudinal trajectories of total brain 
volume (TBV) from 6 to 24 months for the three groups examined, with males and females 
displayed separately. The trajectory of TBV for males only among the three groups is similar 
to the pattern we see in the full sample (Main Text, Figure 1). The female only HR-ASD 
group is quite small (n=2) which makes the pattern of trajectory difficult to interpret. These 
figures support the general similarity of the findings in the combined sample and the male-
only sample. Key: red = HR-ASD, green = HR-neg, blue = LR. Total brain volume (TBV) 
shown in mm3. Length_age refers to the age corrected by length (body size).

 Extended Data, Table 1
Subject demographics (including tests for group differences)
No significant group differences (between HR-ASD, HR-neg and LR) were observed in race/ethnicity, family income, maternal age at birth, infant birth 
weight, gestational age at birth, or age at visit. As expected based on the well-known disproportionately higher rates of ASD in males, the HR-ASD group 
contained significantly more males than the LR group (χ2 (2) = 15.7, p <.01). We also observed that the LR group had higher maternal education 
compared to the other two groups (χ2 (2) = 36.4, p <.01). As expected, based on the association between intellectual disability and ASD, the HR-ASD 
group had significantly lower Mullen and Vineland scores at 24 months than the other two groups. KEY: SD = standard deviation, % = percentage,

Group differences in developmental level, total brain volume, and surface area
We further tested whether there were any group differences in developmental functioning (Mullen) and also the two main variables of interest in our 
longitudinal analyses, TBV and SA. Groups did not differ in developmental functioning at any visit age, indicating the subjects in the 3 visit and 1-2 visit 
subgroups are similar in their developmental capabilities. No group differences were observed for either TBV or SA at any visit age, suggesting both 
groups appear to have similar profiles in their brain measures. Key: HR-ASD = High Risk with Autism, Age – visit age (in months), M = group mean, SD 
= standard deviation, Unit of brain volume measures is mm3. Unit for surface area is mm2.

 Extended Data, Table 8
Group differences in developmental trajectories and cross-sectional volumes by age: Males Only
The primary analysis of brain volume trajectories included only those male and female study participants, with three completed visits (6-12-24 months), 
to best depict longitudinal trajectories over time. Separate analyses on males and females are likely to be inadequately powered due to small subsample 
size (males = 13, females = 2) and therefore provide inconclusive results. With that caveat, we provide the results of our male-only three group analysis 
for total brain volume. We do not see any group differences in the first year (6-12 months). The HR-ASD males show a pattern of TBV brain enlargement 
by the end of the second year, compared to the LR and HR-neg groups. Key: LR = low risk, HR-neg = High Risk negative, HR-ASD = High Risk with 
Autism, 1st Year = 6-12 month period, 2nd Year = 12-24 month period, Pairwise Group Comparison (p<.05), SE = standard error, LSM = least square 
means, Unit of brain volume measures for trajectory and cross-sectional analyses is mm3. Unit for surface area is mm2, and for cortical thickness is mm. 
Slope is represented as change/months. Sample for piecewise linear model included subjects with complete data at all three visits (6m, 12m, 24m).

 Figure 1. Longitudinal trajectories of total brain volume (TBV), surface area (SA) and cortical 
thickness (CT) from 6 to 24 months
Figure 1 shows the longitudinal trajectories of total brain volume (TBV), cortical thickness 
(CT), and surface areas from 6 to 24 months for the three groups examined. Only individuals 
with complete longitudinal imaging (6, 12, and 24 months) were included in the analysis 
(HR-ASD, n=15; HR-neg, n=91; LR, n=42). Group trajectories were estimated from the 
random coefficient piece-wise linear model (see Methods). The HR-ASD group showed a 
significantly increased SA growth rate in the first year of life (from 6 to 12 months) 
compared to both the HR-neg (t (289) =2.01, p=0.04) and LR groups (t (289) = 2.50, 
p=0.01). There were no significant group differences in SA growth rates in the second year 
(Extended Data, Table 2). Pairwise comparisons of SA measured at 12 months of age 
showed medium to large effect sizes for HR-ASD vs LR (Cohen's d = 0.74) and HR-ASD vs 
HR-neg (Cohen's d = 0.41), becoming more robust by 24 months with HR-ASD vs LR 
(Cohen's d = 0.88) and HR-ASD vs HR-neg (Cohen's d = 0.70). There were no significant 
group differences in trajectories for cortical thickness (CT), with all groups showing a 
pattern of decreasing CT over time. No group differences were observed in trajectory of CT 
growth in either the first (F (2,289) = 0.00; p =0.99) or second year (F (2,289) = 1.44; 
p=0.24). Key: red = HR-ASD, green = HR-neg, blue = LR. TBV = total brain volume in 
mm3, Length_age refers to the age corrected by length (body size), SSAll = total surface 
area, CTAll = total cortical thickness. Surface area shown in mm2, Cortical thickness in mm.

 Figure 2. Cortical regions showing significant expansion in surface area from 6-12 months in 
HR-ASD
Figure 2 displays the map of significant group differences in surface area from 6 to 12 
months. Exploratory analyses were conducted with a 78 region of interest surface map (see 
Supplementary Information), using an adaptive Hochberg method of p <0.05. The colored 
areas show the group effect for the HR-ASD versus LR subjects. Compared to the LR group, 
the HR-ASD group had significant expansion in cortical surface area in the left/right middle 
occipital gyrus and right cuneus (A), right lingual gyrus (B), and to a lesser extent the left 
inferior temporal gyrus (C), and middle frontal gyrus (D). HR-ASD, n = 34; LR, n = 84.

 Figure 3. Visualization of cortical regions with surface area measures among the top 40 features 
contributing to the deep learning (DL) dimensionality reduction
The cortical regions whose surface area measures are among these top 40 features obtained 
from the non-linear deep learning (DL) approach are visualized. The top 10 DL features 
observed include: surface area at 6 months in the right and left superior frontal gyrus, post-
central gyrus, and inferior parietal gyri, and ICV at 6 months. These features produced by 
the DL approach are highly consistent with those observed using an alternative approach 
(linear sparse learning) (Extended Data, Figure 1). Two tables listing the top 40 features 
from the DL approach and sparse learning are provided in Supplementary Information 
(Tables 2 and 3).
