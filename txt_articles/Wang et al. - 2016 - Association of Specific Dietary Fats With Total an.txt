IMPORTANCE Previous studies have shown distinct associations between specific dietary fat
and cardiovascular disease. However, evidence on specific dietary fat and mortality remains
limited and inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE To examine the associations of specific dietary fats with total and cause-specific
mortality in 2 large ongoing cohort studies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study investigated 83 349 women from the
Nurses’Health Study (July 1, 1980, to June 30, 2012) and 42 884 men from the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study (February 1, 1986, to January 31, 2012) who were free of
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and types 1 and 2 diabetes at baseline. Dietary fat intake was
assessed at baseline and updated every 2 to 4 years. Information on mortality was obtained
from systematic searches of the vital records of states and the National Death Index,
supplemented by reports from family members or postal authorities. Data were analyzed
from September 18, 2014, to March 27, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total and cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS During 3 439 954 person-years of follow-up, 33 304 deaths were documented.
After adjustment for known and suspected risk factors, dietary total fat compared with total
carbohydrates was inversely associated with total mortality (hazard ratio [HR] comparing
extreme quintiles, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.88; P < .001 for trend). The HRs of total mortality
comparing extreme quintiles of specific dietary fats were 1.08 (95% CI, 1.03-1.14) for
saturated fat, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.78-0.84) for polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), 0.89 (95% CI,
0.84-0.94) for monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.07-1.18) for trans-fat
(P < .001 for trend for all). Replacing 5% of energy from saturated fats with equivalent energy
from PUFA and MUFA was associated with estimated reductions in total mortality of 27%
(HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.70-0.77) and 13% (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.93), respectively. The HR
for total mortality comparing extreme quintiles of ω-6 PUFA intake was 0.85 (95% CI,
0.81-0.89; P < .001 for trend). Intake of ω-6 PUFA, especially linoleic acid, was inversely
associated with mortality owing to most major causes, whereas marine ω-3 PUFA intake was
associated with a modestly lower total mortality (HR comparing extreme quintiles, 0.96;
95% CI, 0.93-1.00; P = .002 for trend).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Different types of dietary fats have divergent associations
with total and cause-specific mortality. These findings support current dietary
recommendations to replace saturated fat and trans-fat with unsaturated fats.

H
ealtheffectsofdifferenttypesofdietaryfatshavebeen
a long-standing research topic of interest for decades.1
Vast literature clearly indicates that specific types of
dietary fat have distinct effects on the risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD), and replacing saturated fats with unsaturated
fatsandavoidanceoftrans-fatiswidelyrecommended.1-4How-
ever, a recent meta-analysis5 concluded that dietary polyun-
saturatedfattyacids(PUFAs)orsaturatedfattyacids(SFAs)had
no significant associations with the risk for coronary heart dis-
ease (CHD), but failed to specify the macronutrient to which
saturated fat was compared; by default this component con-
sists largely of refined starch and sugar in Western diets.6,7 In
addition, existing evidence, especially from relatively small
clinical trials, regarding the effects of ω-3 PUFAs on total and
cause-specific mortality remains inconsistent.8,9 The health
benefits of ω-6 PUFA intake are still contentious; concern has
been raised over the hypothesized proinflammatory and pro-
thrombotic effects of ω-6 PUFA.10 The evidence of an associa-
tion of industrially produced trans-fatty acids (TFAs) and the
risk for CHD is well established,11 although little data are avail-
able on TFA intake and mortality.
Numerous controlled metabolic trials have documented
the effects of dietary fatty acids on blood lipid levels.3,12 How-
ever, these fatty acids also influence other mechanistic path-
ways such as insulin resistance, endothelial function, electro-
physiologic phenomena, carcinogenesis, and systemic
inflammation.9,13,14 In addition to CVD, various dietary fatty
acids have been associated with incidence of other major
chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, multiple
sclerosis, and respiratory diseases, in prospective cohort
studies.15-18 To address the role of dietary fats in overall health,
analysis of total and cause-specific mortality as outcomes
would be informative. Therefore, we prospectively exam-
ined the associations of specific dietary fats with total and
cause-specific mortality in 2 large ongoing prospective co-
hort studies, the Nurses’Health Study (NHS) and the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). The many repeated di-
etary assessments in the cohorts provided a unique assess-
ment of diet during multiple decades. Also, these assess-
mentsallowedustoestimatetheconsequencesofisocalorically
replacing one type of fat with another, thus describing the
choices we make on a daily basis and providing a basis for di-
etary guidelines.
Methods
Study Population
The NHS is a prospective cohort study of 121 700 registered fe-
male nurses aged 30 to 55 years in 1976; 92 468 participants
responded to the semiquantitative food frequency question-
naire (SFFQ) in 1980. The HPFS is a prospective cohort study
of 51 529 male health care professionals aged 40 to 75 years in
1986. The baseline of this analysis was defined as 1980 for the
NHS and 1986 for the HPFS. Both cohorts have been followed
up via biennial mailed questionnaires that inquire about life-
style risk factors and other exposures of interest, as well as
newly diagnosed diseases. We also collected information on
race, marital status, and family history of major chronic dis-
eases. The cumulative follow-up of both cohorts exceeds 90%
of potential person-time. The study was approved by the hu-
man research committees at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of
Public Health and the Brigham and Women’
s Hospital. The
studyprotocolwasapprovedbytheinstitutionalreviewboards
of Brigham and Women’
s Hospital and the Harvard School of
Public Health, with participants’consent implied by the re-
turn of the questionnaires.
We excluded participants who had a history of diabetes,
CVD, or cancer; who did not provide information on dietary
fat intake; or who reported implausible SFFQ data (total en-
ergy intake <800 or >4200 kcal/d for men and <600 or >3500
kcal/d for women) at baseline (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Af-
ter exclusions, the analytical population consisted of 83 349
women and 42 884 men.
Dietary Assessment
Dietary information was collected with SFFQs.19,20 In each
SFFQ,weaskedhowoften,onaverage,theparticipanthadcon-
sumed a specified portion size of each food during the pre-
ceding year. The number of listed foods was 61 in 1980 and was
expanded to 116 to 150 in 1984 and thereafter; additional fre-
quently used foods were reported in an open-ended section.
We also collected detailed information on the type of fat or oil
used in food preparation and the brand or type of margarines
on the SFFQ. Fatty acid and other nutrient values were calcu-
lated based on the Harvard University Food Composition
Table,21 which is updated regularly using external publica-
tions and direct analysis of fatty acids in commonly used mar-
garines and processed foods to take into account changes in
manufacturing. We calculated mean daily nutrient and total
energy intakes by multiplying the frequency of consumption
of each item by its nutrient content and summing the prod-
ucts across all foods, taking into account the specific brand and
type of margarines and the types of fat used in food prepara-
tion. The assessment of specific types of fat has been vali-
datedbycomparisonwithmultipleweighed1-weekdietaryrec-
ords and with fatty acid measurements in adipose tissue and
plasma.19,20,22-24
Key Points
Question What are the long-term associations between dietary
intake of specific fats and mortality?
Findings In this cohort study that included 126 233 participants
followed up for as long as 32 years, higher intakes of saturated fat
and trans-fat were associated with increased mortality, whereas
higher intakes of polyunsaturated (PUFA) and monounsaturated
(MUFA) fatty acids were associated with lower mortality. Replacing
5% of energy from saturated fats with equivalent energy from
PUFA and MUFA was associated with reductions in total mortality
of 27% and 13%, respectively.
Meaning These findings support current dietary
recommendations to replace saturated fat and trans-fat with
unsaturated fat.

The correlations between energy-adjusted intakes
assessed by the 1986 questionnaire and the mean of diet rec-
ords collected in 1980 and 1986, corrected for variation in
the records, were 0.67 for total fat, 0.70 for SFAs, 0.69 for
monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and 0.64 for
PUFAs.19,20 Correlations increased when the mean of 3
SFFQs (1980, 1984, and 1986) was used; for example, for
SFAs the correlation was 0.95.19,20 The correlations between
dietary fatty acid intake assessed by the SFFQ and the com-
position of fatty acids in adipose tissue were 0.51 for TFAs,
0.35 for linoleic acid, and 0.48 for marine ω-3 PUFAs in
women,22 and 0.29 for TFAs, 0.48 for linoleic acid, and 0.47
for eicosapentaenoic acid in men. Alcohol intake was also
estimated from the SFFQs.
In the NHS, dietary questionnaires used in this analysis
were completed in 1980, 1984, 1986, and then every 4 years,
for a total of 9 assessments. In the HPFS, dietary question-
naireswerecompletedin1986andthenevery4yearsforatotal
of 7 assessments.
Ascertainment of Death
We performed systematic searches of the vital records of states
andoftheNationalDeathIndex,supplementedbyreportsfrom
family members or postal authorities. More than 98% of the
deaths in each cohort were identified.25 A physician re-
viewed death certificates and medical records to classify the
cause of death according to the International Classification of
Diseases, Eighth Revision and Ninth Revision (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from September 18, 2014, to March 27,
2016. The percentages of energy intake from total fat and spe-
cific dietary fats were calculated as cumulative means to the
start of each 2- or 4-year follow-up interval to best represent
long-term dietary intake and dampen within-person varia-
tion. We categorized participants into quintiles of intake lev-
els. Person-years of follow-up were calculated from baseline
to the earliest of time of death, loss to or unavailability for fol-
low-up, or the end of follow-up. The last date of follow-up was
defined as June 30, 2012, for the NHS and January 31, 2012,
for the HPFS.
Cox proportional hazards regression models were ap-
plied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs of mor-
tality by comparing participants in each quintile with those in
the lowest quintile. To quantify a linear trend, we assigned the
median within each quintile and modeled this variable con-
tinuously; the Wald test was used for statistical significance.
In addition to including percentages of energy from total and
specific fat as quintiles, we also included them as continuous
terms in the multivariable models.
For multivariable analyses, we built isocaloric substitu-
tion models that simultaneously included energy intake, the
percentages of energy derived from protein, and specific types
of fat and other potentially confounding variables. The coef-
ficients from these models can be interpreted as the esti-
matedeffectofsubstitutingacertainpercentageofenergyfrom
fat for equivalent energy from carbohydrates.
For repeatedly measured covariates, we included their up-
dated values as time-varying variables in the model. To mini-
mize missing covariates, we replaced missing data with the last
valid values. The covariates had very few missing values af-
ter the replacement. In addition, we included missing indica-
tors for the remaining missing covariates in the model.
To evaluate the effect of substituting specific types of fat
forsaturatedfat,wetreatedintakeasacontinuousvariableand
calculated the difference in coefficients. Because we hypoth-
esized that the effects of total and specific ω-3 PUFAs might
be more acute, we conducted an additional analysis using the
most recent data on ω-3 PUFAs at the beginning of each bien-
nial follow-up.
We conducted sensitivity analyses to test the robustness
of our findings. To address concern that chronic disease oc-
currence in the years that preceded diagnosis may influence
dietary behavior, we conducted lagged analyses by excluding
the first 4 years of follow-up data and adding a 4-year lag pe-
riod between assessment of dietary fat intake and each fol-
low-up period. To address the possibility that our findings may
be explained by underlying overall dietary pattern, we fur-
ther adjusted for overall dietary pattern score (the Alternate
Healthy Eating Index–2010 score26 minus component scores
for fatty acids). To minimize the influence of hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia on our results, we performed addi-
tional analysis by excluding participants who reported hyper-
tension and hypercholesterolemia at baseline. An inverse-
variance–weighted, fixed-effect meta-analysis was used to
combine the results across the cohorts. All analyses were per-
formed using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc), at
a 2-tailed P value of .05.
Results
Population Characteristics
During 32 years of follow-up in the NHS (2 464 852 person-
years), we documented 20 314 deaths; during 26 years of fol-
low-up in the HPFS (975 102 person-years), we documented
12 990 deaths (total, 33 304 deaths in 3 439 954 person-years
of follow-up). At baseline, participants with higher SFA and
MUFA intakes had higher body mass indexes and higher lev-
els of total energy and dietary cholesterol intake, but were less
likely to be physically active, to use multivitamin and vita-
min E supplements, and to report histories of hypercholester-
olemia and hypertension (Table 1). The prevalence of current
smoking was higher among men with higher SFA and MUFA
intakes. Women with higher intakes of SFA, PUFA, and MUFA
were generally older.
Total Mortality
Although total fat intake was positively associated with total
mortality in age-adjusted models, an inverse association be-
came apparent after adjusting for other potential confound-
ing variables (P < .001 for trend) (Table 2 and eTable 3 in the
Supplement). When substituted for total carbohydrates, a
higher intake of SFA was associated with a slightly higher total
mortality (HR comparing extreme quintiles, 1.08; 95% CI,

1.03-1.14; P < .001 for trend). For TFA intake, a significant posi-
tive association with total mortality was observed (HR com-
paring extreme quintiles, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.18; P < .001 for
trend). Intakes of PUFA and MUFA were inversely associated
with total mortality (Figure 1 and eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment); HRs comparing extreme quintiles were 0.81 (95% CI,
0.78-0.84) for PUFA and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) for MUFA
(P < .001 for trend for both). The inverse association between
total PUFA and mortality was mainly driven by linoleic acid,
as illustrated by their high correlation (correlation coeffi-
cient, 0.99; eTable 5 in the Supplement). The corresponding
HRforlinoleicacidintakewas0.82(95%CI,0.79-0.86;P < .001

for trend) (Table 3 and eTable 6 in the Supplement). Intake of
total ω-3 PUFA was associated with modestly lower total mor-
tality, which was mainly driven by the inverse association of
marine ω-3 PUFAs (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentae-
noic acid) with total mortality. The HRs comparing extreme
quintiles were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91-0.99; P = .03 for trend) for
totalω-3PUFAsand0.96(95%CI,0.93-1.00;P = .002fortrend)
for marine ω-3 PUFAs. The inverse associations became stron-
gerincontinuousanalysesandwhenrecentintakesoftotaland
marineω-3PUFAswereused(eTable7intheSupplement);HRs
comparingextremequintileswere0.91(95%CI,0.87-0.95)and
0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.93; P < .001 for trend for both) for re-
cent intakes of total and marine ω-3 PUFAs, respectively. The
ω-6:ω-3 ratio was not significantly associated with total mor-
tality (P = .29 for trend). The associations for total and spe-
cific types of fat remained largely unchanged in sensitivity
analyses (eTables 8-10 in the Supplement).
Cause-Specific Mortality
Intake of SFA, when substituted for total carbohydrates, was
not significantly associated with CVD mortality (P = .17 for
trend across quintiles; eTable 11 in the Supplement), whereas
TFA intake was associated with a 20% higher CVD mortality
acrossquintiles(HR, 1.20;95%CI,1.08-1.33;P < .001fortrend).
Intake of PUFA was inversely associated with CVD mortality
(P < .001 for trend). We observed an inverse association, pri-
marily in women, between MUFA intake and CVD mortality
(P = .01 for trend). Among specific PUFAs, linoleic acid intake
was most strongly related to a lower risk for CVD mortality
(P < .001 for trend) (eTable 12 in the Supplement).
Dietary intake of SFA, when substituted for total carbo-
hydrates, was associated with slightly higher cancer mortal-
ity (HR comparing extreme quintiles, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.98-1.17;
P = .02fortrend),whereasPUFAintake,especiallylinoleicacid
intake, was associated with modestly lower cancer mortality
(HR comparing extreme quintiles of PUFA intake, 0.93; 95%
CI,0.87-0.99;P = .02fortrend)(eTables13and14intheSupple-
ment). Other major subclasses of dietary fat generally were not
associated with cancer mortality except that α-linolenic acid
intake was associated with a slightly elevated risk for cancer
mortality (eTables 13 and 14 in the Supplement). However, this
association was not significant when recent α-linolenic acid
intake was analyzed (eTable 7 in the Supplement). We ob-
served inverse associations of PUFA and MUFA intakes and
strong positive associations of TFA intake with neurodegen-
erative (eTable 15 in the Supplement) and respiratory (eTable
16 in the Supplement) disease mortality. Higher SFA intake was
associated with a substantial increase of mortality due to re-
spiratory disease (HR comparing extreme quintiles, 1.56; 95%
CI,1.30-1.87;P < .001fortrend).AmongmajorPUFAs,ω-3PUFA
intake,primarilyα-linolenicacid,wasinverselyassociatedwith
neurodegenerative disease mortality (eTable 17 in the Supple-
ment). Marine ω-3 PUFA intake was inversely associated with
respiratory disease mortality (eTable 18 in the Supplement).

CI, 0.70-0.77) and 13% (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.93), respec-
tively (eTable 19 in the Supplement). Replacing SFAs with the
same energy from PUFAs was associated with a lower risk for
mortality due to CVD, cancer, and neurodegenerative dis-
ease. Replacement of 5% of energy from SFAs with 5% of en-
ergy from MUFAs was associated with a 29% estimated reduc-
tion in neurodegenerative disease mortality (HR, 0.71; 95% CI,
0.57-0.88) (eTable 19 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In 2 large cohorts with many repeated measures of diet and a
long duration of follow-up, we found that higher intakes of
PUFAandMUFAwereassociatedwithlowermortality,whereas
higher intakes of SFA and TFA were associated with in-
creased mortality. Although the modest positive association
between SFA intake and mortality suggests small health ben-
efits of replacing SFAs with total carbohydrates, replacing SFAs
with MUFAs and/or PUFAs was associated with a significantly
lower risk for total and cause-specific mortality due to sev-
eral major chronic diseases. Dietary intake of total fat, com-
pared with total carbohydrates, was inversely associated with
total mortality. However, the association between total fat in-
take and mortality largely depends on specific types of fat. In-
take of linoleic acid, the most abundant ω-6 PUFA, showed
strong inverse associations with total and most cause-
specific mortality, without any evidence of detrimental ef-
fects. A higher ω-6:ω-3 PUFA ratio was not associated with in-
creased mortality, but with a slightly lower CVD and cancer
mortality.
Previous data on the associations between different types
of ω-6 PUFA intake and total mortality have been limited. Con-
cordant with our findings, 2 prospective cohort studies using
circulating biomarkers27,28 found a lower total mortality as-
sociated with higher serum concentrations of ω-6 PUFA. Evi-
dence from clinical trials also supported a protective effect of
soybean oil with a higher ω-6:ω-3 PUFA ratio on CHD risk.29,30
Contrary to our findings, a recent reanalysis of the Sydney Diet
Heart Study,31 a secondary prevention trial, reported a signifi-
cant increase in total mortality in participants assigned to an
intervention consisting of higher ω-6 PUFA intake. However,
that study was very small (n = 221) and of short duration (39
months) and included only individuals with existing CVD, and
the intervention likely reduced ω-3 PUFA intake. In addition,
the results may have been confounded by trans-fat in the spe-
cial margarines used for the intervention that were high in lin-
oleic acid levels.6
We observed a modest inverse association between ma-
rine ω-3 PUFA intake and total mortality. Previously, prospec-
tive cohorts in generally healthy populations yielded mixed
results,32-36 whereas most randomized clinical trials found
nonsignificant effects of fish oil supplementation on total
mortality.9,37 The significant inverse association between in-
take of ω-3 PUFAs and death due to neurodegenerative dis-
eases has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported.
We found a significant inverse association between MUFA
intake and total mortality. In contrast, previous studies2,38,39
generally reported nonsignificant or even positive associa-
tions with MUFA. This discordance might be owing to the
strong correlations between MUFA and SFA, because animal
fats are major sources of both types of fats in most Western
diets, and between MUFA and TFA, because partial hydroge-
nation produces both. In our 2 cohorts, the correlation be-
tween MUFA and SFA decreased during the follow-up, and the
major food sources of MUFA have shifted from animal-
sourced to plant-sourced foods over time (eTable 20 in the
Supplement); thus we had greater power to differentiate the
association of MUFA with mortality. Consistent with our analy-
sis, the major source of MUFA in Mediterranean populations,
olive oil, has been associated with a substantially lower total
mortality.38 Important benefits of MUFA from plant sources
have also been supported by the Prevención con Dieta Medi-
terránea (PREDIMED) trial,40,41 in which the addition of olive
oil and nuts, also high in MUFA levels, reduced the incidence
of CVD and diabetes.
Compared with overall carbohydrates, higher SFA intake
was associated with a slight increase in total mortality, but not
significantly associated with CVD mortality. The lack of the

association with CVD is expected because the major sources
of carbohydrates in a typical Western diet are highly pro-
cessed foods with large amounts of refined starch and sugar,
providing a high glycemic load that can increase CVD risk in-
dependent of SFA.7,42,43 In our substitution analyses, replac-
ing SFA with unsaturated fatty acids was associated with a sub-
stantially lower risk for total and CVD mortality. These findings
were generally consistent with evidence from previous
studies.2,44-46However,arecentmeta-analysis5concludedthat
specific types of fat, including saturated, monounsaturated,
or polyunsaturated, had no significant effect on the risk for
CHD. Another meta-analysis47 also reported nonsignificant as-
sociations of SFA intake with total and CVD mortality and CHD
incidence. However, most studies included in these meta-
analyses did not explicitly model the effects of macronutri-
ent substitution and did not specify the comparison source of
energy for the type of fat under scrutiny, which limits the in-
terpretations of these findings.6,44 Our analyses provide strong
evidence that using PUFAs and/or MUFAs as the replacement
nutrients for SFAs can confer substantial health benefits,
whereas replacing SFAs with total carbohydrates has little ef-
fect on CVD mortality. However, the effects of replacement by
carbohydrates may depend in part on the quality of the
carbohydrates.7
Data on specific types of dietary fat and non-CVD mortal-
ity are sparse. We observed no major effects of most types of

dietary fat on cancer mortality, although a modest inverse as-
sociation with linoleic acid was observed. Our findings of an
inverse association between a higher intake of PUFAs, primar-
ily α-linolenic acid, and lower mortality due to neurodegen-
erative diseases are consistent with limited evidence on the
incidence of major neurodegenerative diseases, including Alz-
heimer disease,48 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,15 and Parkin-
son disease,49 in prospective cohorts. Finally, we observed a
positive association between saturated and trans-fat intakes
and respiratory disease mortality, but an inverse association
withPUFAs.Thesefindingsarenovelandthereforerequirecon-
firmation in further studies.
Our results have several limitations. First, reverse causa-
tion is a possible explanation for our findings, because people
with chronic disease and poor health might change their
habitual diet. However, we excluded participants with
known major chronic diseases at baseline. Also, those per-
sons concerned about a serious illness might change toward a
diet generally perceived to be healthier, which would not
explain our findings. In addition, our findings remained
largely unchanged when we excluded the first 4 years of
follow-up or added a 4-year lag period between dietary
assessment and each follow-up period. Second, because our
study was observational in nature, causality cannot be estab-
lished. However, our results were largely consistent with
results from existing observational studies and randomized
clinical trials on diet and CVD-related outcomes. Third,
although we adjusted for many potential confounders,
residual confounding could not be ruled out. Fourth, mea-
surement errors are inevitable in estimates of food and nutri-
ent intakes. However, our adjustment for energy intake and
use of prospectively collected, cumulative mean intake using
many repeated dietary assessments reduced the impact of
measurement errors.19,20 The strengths of the present study
include the large sample size, high rates of follow-up, and
repeated assessments of dietary and lifestyle variables during
a long period.
Conclusions
We found that different types of dietary fats have divergent as-
sociations with total and cause-specific mortality. Replace-
ment of saturated fats with unsaturated fats can confer sub-
stantialhealthbenefitsandshouldcontinuetobeakeymessage
in dietary recommendations. These findings also support the
elimination of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, the pri-
mary source of trans-fatty acids.
