 Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly 
diagnosed cancer among females and third among 
males worldwide. It also contributes significantly to 
cancer-related deaths, despite the continuous progress 
in diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Biomarkers 
currently play an important role in the detection and 
treatment of patients with colorectal cancer. Risk 
stratification for screening might be augmented by 
finding new biomarkers which alone or as a complement 
of existing tests might recognize either the predisposition 
or early stage of the disease. Biomarkers have also the 
potential to change diagnostic and treatment algorithms 
by selecting the proper chemotherapeutic drugs across 
a broad spectrum of patients. There are attempts to 
personalise chemotherapy based on presence or absence 
of specific biomarkers. In this review, we update review 
published last year and describe our understanding of 
tumour markers and biomarkers role in CRC screening, 
diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Goal of future 
research is to identify those biomarkers that could allow 
a non-invasive and cost-effective diagnosis, as well as 
to recognise the best prognostic panel and define the 
predictive biomarkers for available treatments.

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) annually affects 
more than one million men and women and causes 
more than half a million deaths
[1]. In Europe in 2010, 
CRC was the third most common malignant cancer 
in both men and women
[2]. There are 250000 cases 
of colorectal cancer diagnosed on an annual basis in 
Europe only. Five-year survival was 54 percent among 
adult Europeans diagnosed with colorectal cancer 
between 1995 and 1999
[3]. More recent available data 
report that the overall five-year relative survival can 
achieve 65 percent, but varies depending on stage of 
cancer disease
[4]. 
The number of biomarkers used for tests continues 
to grow. The National Institute of Health defines a 
biomarker as a biological molecule found in blood, 
other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of normal 
or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease
[5]. 
A definition of biomarker mostly refers to DNA, RNA, 
microRNA (miRNA), epigenetic changes or antibodies. 
A term tumour marker, by some researchers 
considered as a synonym of biomarker, refers to 
substances (most typically proteins, glycolipids) 
representing biological structures, which can be 
attributed to the development of normal cells or 
carcinogenesis at different cell development stages 
e.g., tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) which are 
the largest group of clinically significant markers. As 
a result, the concentration of TAAs typically correlates 
with the number (or mass) of specific neoplastic cells. 
In daily clinical practice, in the process of diagnosis 
and therapy, there are several parameters in use of 
long-established high sensitivity, specificity and positive 
predictive value. These parameters have been selected 
from among tens of molecules produced by cells in 
long-term laboratory tests, observational studies and 
clinical trials. The concentrations of tumour markers 
tested at the diagnostic stage are believed to assist 
in early cancer diagnosis and to be used in screening 
tests. Some of them are currently found to be more 
important during treatment and long-term follow-
up. On the other hand, for some types of tumours, 
markers are also considered important in monitoring 
the progress of treatment, efficacy of neo-adjuvant 
therapy, surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy and follow-up for possible recurrence. Long-
term observational studies also point to the fact that, 
apart from determining antigen concentration, it can 
be also important to trace its progress and dynamics. 
In this review, we have updated a review published in 
2014
[6]. We examine molecular (genetic, epigenetic, 
protein) biomarkers associated with CRC and discuss 
their role in cancer screening, early detecting of 
disease recurrence and as prognostic and predictive 
factors. 
BLOOD AND STOOL MARKERS FOR 
COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING AND 
FOLLOW UP
Blood and stool genetic and epigenetic markers
Several authors have investigated molecular non-
invasive screening tests for early detection of CRC. 
DNA, RNA and other molecules derived by tumour 
in stool, as well as their concentrations in blood 
have been studied extensively. Colorectal process 
of carcinogenesis is characterized by genetic and 
epigenetic alteration transforming normal cells into 
cancer cells. Most studies concerning molecular 
markers in stool have focused on the detection of 
tumour DNA. These investigations have concentrated 
on the detection of mutated KRAS, TP53, APC and 
markers for microsatellite instability (MSI)
[7-9]. A faecal 
DNA test targeted at molecular biomarkers has been 
commercially available for twelve years, with reported 
sensitivity for cancer ranging from 25% up to 92% 
for the latest tests based on BEAMing technology, 
and 94%-98% specificity
[10-12]. Apart from genetic 
alterations, the DNA promoter hypermethylation 
silencing the tumour suppressor genes has been widely 
investigated. Epigenetic changes, depending on the 
markers or their combinations evaluated, have been 
detected in CRC patients with 70%-96% sensitivity 
and 72%-96% specificity
[9,13,14]. Many combinations 
of genetic and epigenetic markers have been studied, 
but until now, the results have not endorsed their 
use in clinical practice. Using blood instead of stool 
as a screening material could offer some obvious 
advantages. Several studies have evaluated potential 
plasma DNA genetic and epigenetic biomarkers in 
CRC detection. The overall sensitivity ranges from 
30% to 87%, with specificity of up to 96%. The use 
of RNA biomarkers in stool has not been investigated 
as extensively as was the case for DNA biomarkers, 
mainly because stool environment is responsible for 
mRNA degradation, although improving laboratory 
retrieval methods seems to solve this problem. Koga 
et al
[15] analysed mRNA expression of MMP7, PTGS2, 
TP53 and MYBL2 in colonocytes isolated from stool by 
quantitative real-time RT-PCR, to find out that these 
markers can identify CRC patients with 58% sensitivity 
and 88% specificity. Sensitivity was found to depend 
on tumour size and tumour location, but not cancer 
stage
[15]. Most recently, the so called transcriptomic 
studies have investigated the expression of miRNAs - 
short, non-coding 18-22 nucleotide RNA molecules in 
1746

 stools of CRC patients. The most extensively studied 
miR21, miR106a, miR135, miR17-92 were found to 
be overexpressed in CRC patients compared with 
healthy individuals
[16,17]. As was the case with RNA 
markers in stool, many studies have been evaluating 
mRNA of different tumour genes in whole blood, 
plasma or circulating tumour cells to identify new 
CRC screening markers. Most of them investigated 
mRNA molecules of CK19, CK20, or Carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA). The overall sensitivity of these markers 
was up to 72%, specifically when combinations of 
these markers were used
[18,19]. The specificity was 
very high with healthy control samples or much lower 
when compared to other cancer or inflammatory 
bowel diseases samples
[20]. Recent studies have 
indicated that circulating miRNAs may be involved in 
the process of oncogenesis. The use of miRNA as a 
biomarker is now being evaluated. A large number of 
miRNA molecules have been assessed, with a focus on 
miR145, miR143, miR135, miR17-92. More specifically, 
Huang et al
[21] has found that plasma miR29a and 
miR92a demonstrated a significant diagnostic value for 
advanced neoplasia with 83% and 84% sensitivity and 
specificity, respectively, in discriminating CRC patients. 
These studies need to be validated in randomised trials 
to define their value in CRC screening.
Blood and stool protein markers
Protein markers for screening and early detection 
of CRC can be divided into tumour TAAs, antibodies 
against TAAs, and other CRC-relevant proteins. CEA 
was discovered almost 50 years ago, in 1965, and it 
still remains the only tumour marker of recognised 
efficacy in monitoring CRC patients’ therapy
[22]. CEA 
was first considered specific for CRC, but elevated 
CEA levels were later detected in other neoplasms 
too, e.g. gastric and pancreatic cancers, and in 
inflammatory conditions. Elevated CEA concentrations 
are only rarely identified in CRC stage I. Moreover
, 
CEA does not differentiate benign versus malignant 
polyps. According to The European Group on Tumor 
Markers, European Society of Medical Oncology and 
American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines
[2,23,24], 
CEA is not recommended for use in screening 
tests. Recently, some studies have investigated the 
advantages of mRNA molecules encoding CEA for the 
detection of CRC, but the results were not superior to 
those of CEA
[19].
In some studies, high CEA concentrations in 
patients with CRC stage Ⅱ and Ⅲ were found to be 
potentially indicative of more aggressive types of 
cancer
[25,26]. Earlier
, the Colorectal Working Group of 
American Joint Committee on Cancer proposed to 
include CEA baseline concentration to the traditional 
TNM classification as the so-called C-stage. C-stage 
was proposed to be divided into Cx, C0 (CEA < 5 
ng/mL) and C1 (CEA > 5 ng/mL) substages
[27]. The 
meaning of CEA as an independent prognostic factor 
was also confirmed in a recent retrospective analysis 
of 17910 patients with CRC, with a mean 27-mo 
follow-up, with longer survival periods for patients 
with ⅡA C0 and ⅢA C0 vs 
Ⅰ 
C1, ⅢA C0 vs ⅡA C1, 
and ⅢB C0 vs ⅡB-C C1, respectively
[28]. No study, 
however
, has shown that CEA concentration level can 
be used to select those patients with stage Ⅱ CRC 
who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. From 
a prognostic point of view, it appears reasonable to 
determine CEA levels before surgery in patients with 
disseminated CRC. The roles of CEA in determining 
life expectancy was confirmed in several studies on 
patients with liver metastases
[29,30]. Recent study 
proved that combined use of CEA and serum amyloid 
A (SAA) is able to identify patients with favourable 
and poor prognosis. In addition to tumour baseline 
parameters, routine analysis of CEA together with 
SAA provides improved prognosis value on cancer 
specific survival and disease-free survival in resected 
rectal cancers
[31]. CEA half-life is known to last 
approximately 7 d. After R0 resection surgery, CEA 
levels should return to normal within 4 to 6 wk. 
Sustained elevated CEA levels can be indicative 
of infiltration or metastases. Slow increase in CEA 
concentrations after surgery is a typical sign of local 
recurrence, whereas dynamically increasing levels can 
be symptomatic of metastases, most probably in the 
liver
[24,32]. Testing CEA levels is considered most cost-
effective in detecting post-surgery recurrences
[24]. 
Please note that CEA levels tested every 3 mo for the 
first 3 years and thereafter every 6 mo for subsequent 
2-3 years is a golden follow-up standard after CRC 
therapy recommended by a number of scientific 
associations
[2,23,33]. It appears particularly important 
in asymptomatic patients, in whom chemotherapy 
can be used, with a much longer life expectancy as 
compared to treatment administered after the onset 
of symptoms of recurrence. CEA is a marker of choice 
in monitoring disseminated disease during systemic 
therapy. Constant increase in CEA levels is typically 
associated with a progression of the disease, even 
though radiological tests may prove otherwise
[23,24]. 
However
, chemotherapy can also result in temporary 
increase in CEA concentration, which must be also 
taken into account. Therefore, it is not recommended 
to test CEA levels within 2 wk of chemotherapy, 
whereas in patients on oxaliplatin, tests can be carried 
out after 4 to 6 wk. 
Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a glycoprotein 
whose relevance in CRC diagnosis still remains an 
issue. The majority of researchers arrived at the 
conclusion that CA 19-9 sensitivity is much inferior 
to that of CEA, and that elevated CA 19-9 levels is a 
poor prognostic factor
[2,23,34-36]. Other carbohydrate 
antigens: CA 195, CA 50 have been also investigated, 
but with comparatively disappointing results. CA 72-4 
is a biomarker with poor sensitivity ranging from 9% 
to 31% and better specificity ranging from 89% to 
1747

investigators have found that increased levels of TPA 
and TPS are observed in metastatic stage of CRC. A 
further studies has suggested that combination of TPA 
and CEA rises the sensitivity of these biomarkers in 
identifying the patients with CRC recurrence
[34,37,43,44]. 
Other biomarkers, such as: thymidine phosphorylase 
(TP), DNA ploidy were determined to be insignificant 
in detecting, staging and following-up of patients with 
CRC
[23]. 
MOLECULAR PROGNOSTIC AND 
PREDICTIVE BIOMARKERS
With the recent progress in understanding the 
molecular mechanisms of cancer development, 
dissemination, resistance to chemotherapy, and 
radiation therapy, it is now easier to select the most 
proper strategy for managing CRC. Clinical prospective 
and retrospective studies open the door for biomarkers 
use in clinical practice to assist in selecting the best 
drugs, both standard, such as 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin 
or irinotecan, and new generation targeted drugs: 
cetuximab, panitumumab, or bevacizumab. Biomarker 
identification is particularly important for patients with 
CRC stage Ⅱ. In this group of patients, the risk of 
recurrence is only 20 percent. It is also desirable to 
use adjuvant therapy in this type of patients. There 
95% in patients screened for CRC. The diagnostic 
information in recurrent CRC provided by CA 72-4 
has borderline significance, by far worse than CEA. 
All authors conclude that CA 72-4 sensitivity is rather 
low and specificity incomplete in screening and 
following up in patients with CRC. On the other hand, 
an algorithm based on combination of CEA, CA 19-9, 
CA 72-4, CA 242, CYFRA21-1 improves the diagnostic 
accuracy compared with these biomarkers alone
[34-39]. 
Among other protein markers examined for screening 
purposes, two have been extensively investigated: the 
tumour specific M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (M2-PK) 
in stool and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 
1 (TIMP1). M2-PK measured in stool showed relatively 
high sensitivity for CRC up to 91%, and much lower 
for adenomas
[40,41]. Plasma level of TIMP1 is reported 
to be elevated in CRC patients and prospective studies 
have been carried to assess its utility as biomarker
. 
The results of the study included more than 4500 
patients screened by endoscopy for CRC demonstrated 
that TIMP1 is not significantly superior to CEA marker 
in cancer screening and is not suitable for the detection 
of premalignant lesions
[42]. Tissue polypeptide-specific 
antigen (TPS) and tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) 
which detects the fragments of cytokeratines 8, 18 
and 19 due to lack of sensitivity and specificity can not 
to be recommended in CRC screening. The majority of

are attempts to select this group of patients based 
on genetic tests, or to personalise chemotherapy 
based on specific biomarkers. The following markers 
discovered throughout the recent years continue to 
be closely examined: MSI, chromosome 18q loss of 
heterozygosity (18qLOH), p53, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, 
PIK3CA mutations, PTEN expression, UGT1A1 gene 
polymorphism, and ezrin protein (T
able 1). 
MSI 
MSI denotes changes in coding and non-coding 
sequences of microsatellite chromosomes, i.e. repeated 
DNA sequences. These sequences are particularly 
exposed to errors in the mutation repair system 
that consist in the loss or multiplication of nucleotide 
sequence repetitions, which results in shortening or 
extension of microsatellite regions in neoplastic cells. 
Mutations arising out of these processes are eliminated 
by mismatch repair genes (MMR) such as MSH2, MSH6, 
PMS2 and MLH1, which makes some researchers 
believe that MSI can be caused by mutations in these 
genes
[45]. Microsatellite instability can be classified 
into microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), and 
microsatellite instability-low (MSI-L), depending on the 
percentage of loci that correlate to MSI characteristics. 
Tumour cells that lack MSI features are designated as 
MSS. 
In retrospective studies and meta-analyses in 
patients with CRC stage Ⅱ and Ⅲ, MSI-H was shown 
to be a predictive factor that improved overall survival 
(OS), irrespective of the progression (stage) of cancer
. 
A lower incidence of lymph node metastases and 
distant metastases as compared to MSI-L or MSS 
cancer cells was also observed
[46-49]. MSI status is 
currently recommended in the WHO classification of 
mucinous-type CRC - MSI-H indicates good prognosis, 
MSI-L or MSS - poor outcome. However
, MSI should 
be considered more of a prognostic rather than 
predictive factor
. This conclusion is based on equivocal 
results of studies evaluating the efficacy of 5-FU-
based chemotherapy in groups of patients with MSI-H 
and MSI-L or MSS. Ribic et al
[48] examined tumour 
specimens collected from 570 patients with CRC 
stage Ⅱ and Ⅲ and correlated the test results with 
chemotherapy outcomes in these patients to reveal a 
tendency for shorter overall survival in patients with 
MSI-H on adjuvant therapy. Significant improvement 
was observed in patients with MSS tumours. A recent 
pooled analysis of randomized clinical studies revealed 
significant decrease in the overall five-year survival 
rate for patients with CRC stage Ⅱ and MSI-H on 
5-FU-based chemotherapy. 5-FU-based chemotherapy 
was found to improve therapeutic outcomes only 
in patients with CRC stage Ⅲ and MSI-L or MSS
[50]. 
Some studies indicated potentially negative effects 
of 5-FU-based chemotherapy in patients with MSI-H. 
A longer survival rate as compared to patients on 
5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy was observed 
in a reference group of patients undergoing surgical 
treatment. Resistance of MSI-H tumours to 5-FU was 
also confirmed in in vitro studies
[51]. A completely 
different conclusion can be drawn from earlier studies 
of Elsaleh et al
[52,53], which confirmed the efficacy 
of 5-FU in patients with CRC stage Ⅲ and MSI-H. 
Recent study also proved that prognostic value of MMR 
mutation was similar in the presence or absence of 
fluorouracil and folinic acid chemotherapy
[54]. Beragnolli 
et al
[55] revealed that a higher rate of overall 5-year 
progression-free survival was observed in patients 
with CRC stage Ⅲ and MSI-H on 5-FU and irinotecan 
vs 5-FU-based chemotherapy. To recap, the results 
of MSI studies and clinical experience in patients with 
CRC stage Ⅱ indicate that the degree of microsatellite 
instability may be of significance as a prognostic factor
. 
Also, adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy was proved 
to provide no benefits (or potentially cause adverse 
reactions) in patients with MSI-H. Further research 
is needed to investigate whether the MSI status can 
predict benefit (in high-risk patients) from irinotecan-
based treatment or oxaliplatinum-based therapy. 
Chromosome 18q loss of heterozygosity 
A number of studies were dedicated to another 
prognostic factor in patients with CRC stage Ⅱ and 
Ⅲ - chromosome 18q loss of heterozygosity in the 
coding place of, inter alia, SMAD 4 proteins specific to 
CRC. In these studies, the overall 5-year survival was 
poorer for patients with CRC stage Ⅲ and 18qLOH as 
compared to non-18qLOH patients
[56]. A meta-analysis 
of data from 27 studies and 2189 patients by Popat 
et al
[57] confirmed that poorer survival was correlated 
with 18q chromosome deletion. Two years later, 
the same research team questioned these findings 
after re-examining the same data
[58]. Likewise, no 
correlation was identified between the presence of 
18qLOH and 5-year survival in patients with non-
MSI-H phenotype
[59]. The role of 18qLOH in predicting 
response to standard chemotherapy has not been 
yet fully confirmed. Watanabe et al
[60] demonstrated 
better response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in 
patients with CRC stage Ⅲ and MSS and with the 
absence of 18q chromosome deletion vs. patients 
in whom 18q chromosome deletion was present. 
The recently published results of the same research 
team can be a proof that in patients with CRC stage 
Ⅱ and Ⅲ and MSS-H (> 33%), the level of LOH of 
four chromosomes, including 18, is correlated with 
significantly poorer survival rate as compared to 
patients with MSS and LOH-L or MSI-H phenotype
[61]. 
Based on the available data, 18q chromosome 
deletion cannot be the sole basis for any therapeutic 
decisions, however
, it is being more closely examined 
under ECOG 5202 study, featuring molecular markers 
identified so far in selecting the most proper adjuvant 
post-surgery treatment, by prospectively analysing the 
role of MSI and 18qLOH in prognosis and therapeutic

decisions in patients with CRC stage Ⅱ. Patients with 
good prognosis (with MSI-H and w/o 18qLOH) were 
followed-up, and patients with poor prognosis (with 
MSI-L or MSS and 18qLOH) were randomized to one 
of two groups on chemotherapy (FOLFOX alone or 
FOLFOX and bevacizumab). The results of E5202 are 
expected in the next few years. No conclusion can be 
drawn from this study about the possible inefficacy of 
chemotherapy in patients with MSI-H, however
, the 
study will include a multifactor analysis of biomarkers 
that can assist in taking therapeutic decisions in other 
groups of patients
[62]. 
P53 mutation
Mutation in the tumour suppressor gene p53 (chro-
mosome region 17p13) occur in 50%-70% of all CRC 
and is associated with worse outcomes, including 
disease free survival and overall survival
[63]. Results 
obtained from a study that included more than 3500 
CRC patients confirm the prognostic value of p53 
mutation, which seems to be determined by the 
primary tumour site. Patients with p53 mutation and 
tumour of proximal colon had better OS when treated 
with adjuvant chemotherapy compared to those treated 
by surgery alone
[64].
Biomarkers suitable in anti-epidermal growth factor 
receptor therapy 
A number of currently tested markers have been 
discovered in the course of studies on epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathways. 
KRAS gene mutation on short arm of chromosome 12 
at codon 12 (80% of patients) or
, to a lesser extent, 
codon 13 is believed to be of use as a biomarker in 
patients on cetuximab or panitumumab
[65]. These 
mutations are one of the most common in proliferative 
diseases (37% and 13%, respectively), and their 
significance in CRC carcinogenesis has been examined 
in much detail
[66]. As these mutations are present in 
EGFR signalling pathway, they can be a predictive 
factor for therapy with anti-EGFR antibodies. In studies 
performed so far, KRAS mutation was found to be 
correlated with non-responsiveness to cetuximab and 
panitumumab
[67,68]. CRYSTAL and OPUS data indicate 
that the effectiveness of FOLFOX or FOLFIRI alone 
is no inferior to that of cetuximab in patients with 
KRAS in combination with chemotherapy according 
to FOLFIRI and FOLFOX regimen, respectively. 
However
, in non-KRAS patients, cetuximab improves 
the therapeutic outcome
[69,70]. The same conclusions 
can be drawn from the results of other large clinical 
studies: COIN, NORDIC Ⅶ or PRIME
[71-73]. Yet, the 
effects of KRAS mutation at codon 12 or 13 on tumour 
biology were found to differ. In two studies, the 
survival rate was higher in patients with an uncommon 
G13D mutation at codon 13 on cetuximab vs patients 
with other mutations, and similar to patients with no 
KRAS mutations identified
[65,74]. It is presently believed 
that anti-EGFR antigens should not be used in patients 
with tumours indicative of G12V mutation of KRAS at 
codon 12. For bevacizumab, KRAS mutation was found 
to be of no use as a predictive factor
[75]. 
The same applies to BRAF mutations found in 
8%-13% of patients with CRC, which are mutually 
exclusive with KRAS mutations. The most frequently 
observed BRAF mutation is V600E mutation. BRAF 
mutations make the tumour to a large extent resistant 
to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, and significantly 
worsen prognosis, especially in patients with MSI-L and 
MSS
[66,70,76-78]. Based on the available data, National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggests 
considering BRAF mutation testing when KRAS is 
mutation negative. Interestingly, good prognosis 
was reported even in those MSI-H CRC patients who 
had coincident BRAF mutations
[78]. In one of studies, 
the OS period was shown to be slightly longer in 
patients on cetuximab even if the BRAF mutation was 
present
[69]. Very limited response to vemurafenib, 
recently approved for metastatic melanoma patients 
harboring BRAF (V660E) mutation, was demonstrated 
in CRC patients. Researchers reported that by adding 
cetuximab strongly synergistic reaction with BRAF 
inhibitors was observed
[79]. NRAS is another member 
of RAS proto-oncogenes which was found to be rarely 
mutated, while BRAF is mutually exclusive with KRAS 
mutations. Since NRAS mutation can predict resistance 
to EGFR therapy, NCCN suggests considering NRAS 
mutation testing when KRAS is mutation negative. To 
date, NRAS mutation does not appear to be associated 
with the prognosis
[80]. 
Phosphatidylinositide-3-kinases (PI3K) are kinases 
that promote cellular proliferation. Mutations in PIK3CA 
gene encoding p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K have 
been identified in different human solid tumours, 
including CRC. PIK3CA gene is mutated in 10%-20% 
of CRC tumours. PIK3CA gene encodes the kinase that 
regulates, alongside with KRAS, downstream signalling 
pathways of EGFR. Moreover
, PI3K-initiated signalling 
is inhibited by phosphatase and tensin homologue 
deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN). Recent studies 
have revealed an increase in colon cancer-specific 
mortality in patients with PIK3CA-mutated tumours, 
as compared with patients with PIK3CA wild-type 
tumours
[81,82]. However only the coexistence of PIK3CA 
exon 9 and 20 mutations but not PIK3CA mutation 
in either exon 9 or 20 alone has been reported to 
be associated with the worse prognosis
[82]. Among 
patients with KRAS wild-type tumours, the presence 
of PIK3CA mutation correlated with a significant 
increase in CRC specific mortality. In contrast, PIK3CA 
mutation did not significantly affect mortality among 
patients with KRAS-mutated tumours. Thus, the effect 
of PIK3CA mutation may be potentially limited to 
patients with KRAS wild-type tumours
[81]. Following

the fact that only patients with KRAS-wild type CRC 
may respond to anti-EGFR antibodies, several studies 
have investigated the role of PIK3CA mutations on 
CRC cells response to cetuximab or panitumumab. 
The data collected so far indicate that CRC with 
PIK3CA mutations are significantly resistant to anti-
EGFR antibodies. When only KRAS wild-type tumours 
are analyzed, the correlation is even stronger
[83-85]. 
Changes in PIK3 signalling and loss of PTEN expression 
have been generally linked with the lack of response 
to EGFR-targeted therapy
[86,87]. Recent studies have 
found that inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 by regular 
use of aspirin after CRC diagnosis was associated with 
longer cancer specific survival time among patients 
with mutated as opposed to wild-type PIK3CA. The 
authors conclude that PIK3CA mutations may serve as 
a predictive biomarker for adjuvant aspirin therapy
[88]. 
Further studies involving KRAS mutated CRC patients 
are necessary to establish the role of aspirin in PI3K 
pathway.
Biomarker of the potential toxicity of irinotecan 
Irinotecan is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits 
topoisomerase I, thereby inhibiting replication and 
stimulating cell apoptosis. Advanced neutropenia and 
intensive diarrhoea caused by damaged intestinal 
epithelium are the most common adverse effects of 
irinotecan, which significantly limit its use. UGT1A1 
gene polymorphism is a very useful biomarker of the 
potential toxicity of irinotecan. It appears that the use 
of genetic tests is reasonable before treatment initiation 
with irinotecan to avoid severe adverse effects - mainly 
neutropenia in women. Genotyping for UGT1A1 can 
be carried out to select a group of sensitive patients 
with UGT1A1*28 allele, of whom lower initial doses 
would be recommended. Hopefully, it will also allow 
to administer a higher accumulated dose of the drug, 
divided into smaller portions, to limit its toxicity
[89,90]. 
However
, according to a recent meta-analysis, geno-
typing for UGT1A1 has no predictive value in terms of 
responsiveness to various doses of irinotecan among 
patients with CRC
[91]. On the other is recommended by 
ESMO for patients with several toxicity reaction in whom 
irinotecan in high doses should be used
[33]. Furthermore, 
homozygosity for the UGT1A1*28 has been linked with 
improved efficacy of FOLFIRI
[92].
Potential biomarkers of vascular endothelial growth 
factor - targeted therapy
Since the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
- targeted therapy has been integrated into CRC 
treatment protocols, some anti-angiogenic drugs 
have been introduced (bevacizumab, regorafenib, 
aflibercept). However
, a patient selection strategy to 
identify those patients who benefit most from this 
therapy has yet to be developed. To date, a predictive 
biomarker for bevacizumab - the most commonly 
administered anti-angiogenic drug in CRC therapy - 
has not yet been identified. Several studies on the 
identification of predictive biomarkers of bevacizumab 
have been performed. Jürgensmeier et al
[93] evaluated 
retrospectively, using samples from randomised trial 
HORIZON Ⅲ, the prognostic/predictive value of VEGF 
and soluble VEGF receptor-2. High baseline values of 
VEGF were associated with worse progression free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival. These data have 
revealed that baseline VEGF levels were not predictive 
of PFS or OS outcome in bevacizumab-treated 
patients
[93]. Other studies have demonstrated that 
plasma VEGF-A may serve as a prognostic marker
, 
but is unable to predict response to VEGF-targeted 
therapy in advanced CRC
[94,95]. At the same time, KRAS 
mutation was found to be of no use as a predictive 
factor for bevacizumab
[75]. 
Ezrin
Ezrin protein, a part of ezrin/radixin/moesin family may 
play an important role in tumour invasion process. 
Recent studies has found that overexpression of 
ezrin protein correlates with CRC aggressiveness, its 
metastatic potential and worse prognosis. High ezrin 
expression was also identified as marker of early local 
recurrence of rectal cancer
[96,97]. Although further 
investigation is needed, ezrin may represent a relevant 
biomarker and target for personalized anti-metastatic 
therapies. 
CONCLUSION
The recent studies result in a better understanding 
of colorectal cancer and assist in the development of 
new treatment regimens, especially in advanced CRC 
stages. The new predictive factors, molecular imaging, 
or even commercial genome tests increasingly facilitate 
tumour genome testing and assist in selecting targeted 
therapies. Adjuvant targeted therapy with anti-EGFR 
antibodies is required in advanced CRC patients and 
absence of KRAS, BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA genes 
mutation. Tests for MSI or MSS tumour phenotype and 
the presence or absence of 18q chromosome deletion 
is very much desirable in standard therapy based on 
5-FU. Genotyping of UGT1A1 alleles is reasonable 
before treatment initiation with irinotecan to avoid 
severe adverse effects. Further studies are necessary 
to identify predictive biomarker of bevacizumab. 
T
argeted therapy against membrane receptors appears 
to be the future of CRC therapy. Some promising 
studies are now carried out in this area, dedicated to, 
inter alia, other EGFR ligands, insulin-like growth factor 
receptor 1, platelet-derived growth factor receptors 
and c-MET inhibitors. The aim of future research is 
to identify those biomarkers that can provide a non-
invasive and cost-effective diagnosis, as well as to 
recognise the best prognostic panel of biomarkers 
and define the predictive biomarkers for available 
treatments.
