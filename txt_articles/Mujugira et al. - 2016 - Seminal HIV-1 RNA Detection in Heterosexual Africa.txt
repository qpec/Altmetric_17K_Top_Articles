Background.
Intermittent shedding of human immunode-
ficiency virus type 1 (HIV) in semen occurs despite effective an-
tiretroviral therapy (ART) and suppressed blood HIV-1 RNA
levels.
Methods.
We assessed the frequency, magnitude, and cor-
relates of seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding in HIV-1–infected Af-
rican men initiating ART.
Results.
Seminal HIV-1 RNA was detected in 24% (37 of
155), 10% (5 of 49), and 11% (8 of 70) of samples collected
0–3, 4–6, and >6 months after ART initiation. When blood
HIV-1 levels were suppressed, seminal HIV-1 RNA was detect-
ed in 8% (16 of 195), and 82% (13 of 16) had an HIV-1 RNA
load of < 1000 copies/mL.
Conclusions.
Seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding was infre-
quent and present at low levels in HIV-1–infected African
men with suppressed blood HIV-1 RNA.

Semen is the principal vector for transmitting human immunode-
ficiency virus type 1 (HIV) from men to women [1].Combination
antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV-1 RNA concentra-
tions in both blood and semen below the lower limit of detection
for commercially available assays, which substantially decreases the
risk of sexual transmission of HIV-1 to uninfected partners [2].
First-phase HIV-1 RNA decay is characterized by rapid clearance
of free virus and short-lived productively infected cells during
the first 7–10 days of ART. Second-phase decay, with an average
half-life of 14 days, features removal of long-lived memory T cells,
dendritic cells, and macrophages [3]. First-phase decay kinetics
may be slower in semen than in blood, but second-phase decay
rates are thought to be similar in both fluids [4].
Three HIV-1 shedding patterns have been described in semen:
none, continuous, and intermittent [5]. In men who shed HIV-1
in semen, the predominant shedding pattern is intermittent [5].
Several prospective studies of men with suppressed blood HIV-1
RNA levels have described intermittent HIV-1 semen shedding,
even in the absence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [6].
In men with low seminal viral loads, a probabilistic empirical
model estimated a male-to-female HIV-1 transmission risk of
3 cases/10 000 sexual episodes [7].
HIV-1–infected men initiating ART require counseling about
the risk of male-to-female HIV-1 transmission, including infor-
mation about the timing and likelihood of achieving HIV-1
RNA suppression in semen. In a large prospective study of het-
erosexual HIV-1–serodiscordant African couples, we assessed
the frequency, magnitude, and correlates of seminal HIV-1
RNA shedding in men initiating ART.
METHODS
Study Population
Study participants were heterosexual HIV-1–infected African
men who initiated ART between July 2008 and December
2012 in Kenya and Uganda. The study cohort was derived
from HIV-1–serodiscordant couples enrolled in the Partners
PrEP Study, a randomized clinical trial of daily oral antiretrovi-
ral preexposure prophylaxis [8]. At enrollment, HIV-1–infected
partners did not meet eligibility criteria for ART initiation ac-
cording to national treatment guidelines. They were followed
quarterly, and they underwent regular clinical monitoring,
6-monthly CD4+ T-cell counts, and counseling about ART
benefits. Those who became eligible for ART were referred to
collaborating HIV-1 clinics for treatment. ART use was assessed
every 3 months.
All men were provided with HIV-1 prevention services,
including risk-reduction counseling, free condoms, and
screening for and treatment of STIs according to World
Health Organization guidelines. Ethics review committees at
collaborating institutions at each of the study sites and the
University of Washington Human Subjects Review Commit-
tee approved the research protocol. Study participants provid-
ed independent written informed consent in English or their
local language.
Clinical and Laboratory Procedures
Blood and semen specimen collection were scheduled at regular
intervals following study enrollment and not according to the
time of ART initiation. HIV-1–infected men provided blood
specimens for HIV-1 RNA quantification at enrollment, every
6 months thereafter, and at the last study visit. CD4+ T-cell
counts were quantified every 6 months, using flow cytometry

 (BD Biosciences). Semen specimen collection was scheduled at
the 6- and 12-month study visits, but, if missed, samples could
be collected at any subsequent visit when convenient. Men
who agreed to give a semen sample were provided with a sterile
plastic container and spermicide-free condoms. Semen was ob-
tained by masturbation at the study clinic or during coitus at
home after 48–72 hours of sexual abstinence. Semen specimens
were transported to the study clinic within 5 hours of collection.
Following liquefaction and centrifugation for 10 minutes at 600–
800 g, seminal plasma was recovered, stored at −70°C, and
shipped on dry ice (along with frozen blood plasma) to the Uni-
versity of Washington Retrovirology Laboratory (UW RVL) for
HIV-1 RNA quantification. The UW RVL is compliant with
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and certified
by the College of American Pathologists. Blood and semen HIV-
1 RNA concentrations were quantified using the Abbott m2000
Real-Time HIV-1 assay (Abbott Diagnostics); the lower limit of
detection was 40 copies/mL. For the present study, all semen
samples collected following initiation of ART were tested.
At enrollment, every 12 months thereafter, and when clini-
cally indicated, urine samples were tested for Neisseria gonor-
rhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, using APTIMA Combo 2
(Gen-Probe) or COBAS Amplicor (Roche Diagnostic) assays,
and for Trichomonas vaginalis infection, using APTIMA TV
TMA (Gen-Probe) or In Pouch TV (Biomed Diagnostics). Trep-
onema pallidum serology was performed using rapid plasma re-
agin tests, and positive results were confirmed using T. pallidum
particle agglutination tests. All study site laboratories participat-
ed in external quality assurance programs for the respective test.
Data Analysis
All HIV-1–infected men who initiated ART and provided a
semen sample were included in the analysis. The primary out-
come was detectable semen HIV-1 RNA levels. HIV-1 RNA lev-
els were assessed in paired blood and seminal plasma samples
or, if paired samples were not available, in blood samples col-
lected within 3 months of collection of the semen sample.
The presence of HIV-1 RNA in semen was quantified in 3
periods: 0–3, 4–6, and >6 months after ART initiation. The
correlation between blood and seminal HIV-1 RNA quantity
was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
Factors potentially associated with seminal HIV-1 shedding
were evaluated using generalized estimating equations with a
logit link and independent correlation structure, to account
for multiple observations per person. Potential confounding
factors known to be associated with ART adherence and semi-
nal HIV-1 shedding were selected a priori and included age,
STIs, pre-ART CD4+ T-cell count, blood HIV-1 RNA concen-
trations, and duration of ART. Factors with P values of ≤.20 in
bivariate analyses were included in the multivariate model. All
analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software,
version 9.4.
RESULTS
We followed 1778 couples with HIV-1–infected male partners
for 4554 person-years. Of the 755 HIV-1–infected men who ini-
tiated ART, 491 (65%) provided a semen specimen before ART,
and 31 (4%) did not give a semen sample. The remaining 233
(31%) provided 280 semen samples after ART initiation. Anal-
yses of 6 samples failed, and these samples did not contribute to
the analysis. Of the remaining 274 semen samples, 221 (81%)
had a matching blood sample. Following ART initiation, 231
men were followed for a median of 1.6 years (interquartile
range [IQR], 1.2–2.1 years), and the median time from ART ini-
tiation to semen HIV-1 RNA quantification was 2.83 months
(IQR, 0.16–6.45 months). Most (98%) were receiving ART
regimens containing a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor.
Characteristics of HIV-1–infected men are shown in Table 1.
The median age at enrollment was 40 years (IQR, 34–47 years),
and nearly all (99%) were married; the median CD4+ T-cell count
and HIV-1 RNA concentration were 336 cells/μL (IQR, 293–403
cells/μL) and 4.54 log10 copies/mL (IQR, 3.81–5.03 log10 copies/
mL), respectively. The prevalence of STIs was <1%. The 233 men
who had a semen sample collected after ART initiation were
similar to the 522 men who did not provide a semen sample,
except that they were less likely to have a monthly income
(80% vs 87%), had lower pretreatment CD4+ T-cell counts
(244 vs 272 cells/μL), and started ART earlier during study
follow-up (19.4 vs 8.3 months).
HIV-1 Semen Shedding
Overall, HIV-1 RNA was detected in 18% of semen samples (50
of 274). Seminal HIV-1 RNA was detected in 24% of samples
(37 of 155) collected 0–3 months after ART initiation, 10% (5
of 49) collected 4–6 months after ART initiation, and 11% (8 of

 70) collected >6 months after ART initiation. When detected,
median HIV-1 RNA levels were 2.96 log10 copies/mL (IQR,
2.51–3.50 log10 copies/mL).
Semen HIV-1 RNA was detected in 8% of samples (16 of 195)
obtained when blood HIV-1 RNA concentrations were sup-
pressed, of which 11% (10 of 90), 5% (2 of 41), and 6% (4 of
64) were collected after 0–3, 4–6, and >6 months of ART, respec-
tively. When blood HIV-1 was suppressed and semen HIV-1
RNA was detected, the median concentration of semen HIV-1
RNA was 2.52 log10 copies/mL (IQR, 2.23–2.98 log10 copies/
mL). Most (82% [13 of 16]) had a semen HIV-1 RNA quantity
of <1000 copies/mL. No STIs were detected at the time HIV-1
was detected in semen.
Factors Associated With Seminal HIV-1 RNA Detection
HIV-1 RNA concentrations in paired blood and semen speci-
mens were strongly correlated (Spearman rank correlation coef-
ficient, ρ = 0.63; P < .001). In bivariate analyses, semen HIV-1
RNA shedding was significantly associated with the concen-
tration of HIV-1 RNA in blood (P < .001), pretreatment CD4+
T-cell count (P = .04), any monthly income (P = .009), and
duration of ART (P = .05; Table 2). After adjustment for poten-
tial confounding factors, the HIV-1 RNA concentration in
blood significantly predicted HIV-1 RNA semen shedding
(adjusted odds ratio, 2.72 per log10; P < .001).
DISCUSSION
This prospective analysis of sexually active HIV-1–infected men
initiating ART is the largest study to determine the relationship
between suppression of HIV-1 RNA in blood plasma and semi-
nal HIV-1 RNA shedding in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-1 shed-
ding in semen was infrequent and of low quantity when blood
HIV-1 concentrations were suppressed. Most men who shed
HIV-1 in their semen had HIV-1 RNA levels of <1000 copies
per mL of seminal plasma, and HIV-1 RNA levels in blood pre-
dicted HIV-1 semen shedding.
The frequency and magnitude of intermittent HIV-1 semen
shedding we observed was similar to values in prospective studies
of men undergoing suppressive ART and receiving medically as-
sisted reproduction services to initiate a pregnancy with HIV-1–
uninfected female partners [9–11].Among men with undetectable
HIV-1 in blood, HIV-1 RNA was detected in the semen of
3.7%–19.3% of European HIV-1–infected men in serodiscordant
partnerships [9–13]. In our study, 8% of semen samples had de-
tectable HIV-1 RNA when blood HIV-1 levels were suppressed.
Of these 16 samples, 13 (82%) had semen RNA levels of <1000
copies/mL. This concentration of HIV-1 in semen is associated
with a very low risk of male-to-female HIV-1 transmission [1].
A rare male-to-male HIV-1 transmission event involving an
HIV-1–infected partner with undetectable blood HIV-1 RNA
levels has been reported in the literature [14]. We previously re-
ported that there were no male-to-female HIV-1 transmission
events in serodiscordant couples in which HIV-1–infected
men started ART, despite self-reported unprotected sex with
HIV-1–uninfected women partners and high pregnancy inci-
dence [15]. These data support the HIV-1 prevention effective-
ness of suppressive ART, regardless of low-level viremia
infrequently detected in semen.
Our finding that HIV-1 was shed in semen in the absence of
STIs is in agreement with prior studies of HIV-1–infected ART-
recipient men who have sex with men, in which 6%–8% had de-
tectable HIV-1 RNA in semen despite suppressed HIV-1 levels
in blood and absence of detectable STIs [6]. In those studies,
cytomegalovirus coinfection and the size of the latent blood
HIV-1 reservoir predicted seminal HIV-1 RNA shedding. Inter-
mittent shedding of HIV-1 in semen may arise from stimulation
of genital mucosa by concurrent STIs, genital inflammation,
and T-cell immune activation and may reflect HIV-1 compart-
mentalization or incomplete ART penetration of the male gen-
ital tract [6]. Recent work indicates that intermittent shedding
of HIV-1 in semen can occur within a 1-hour interval [13]. This
variability may be similar to isolated episodes of low-level vire-
mia, in which detectable blood HIV-1 RNA levels (typically,
levels of < 400 copies/mL) occur after viral suppression and
are followed by return to virological suppression.
The strength of our study is that we conducted the largest
analysis of HIV-1 shedding in semen among heterosexual Afri-
can men receiving ART. A limitation of our study was that we
only quantified cell-free HIV-1 total nucleic acid concentrations
in seminal plasma. Measuring both cell-associated HIV-1 RNA

 and DNA may provide a more accurate measure of total HIV-1
levels in semen. However, quantifying HIV-1 total nucleic acid
and cell-free HIV-1 DNA in seminal plasma is not routinely
performed as a marker of HIV-1 replication in semen. STI prev-
alence in our cohort was low, and our results may not be gen-
eralizable to high-risk populations. Nevertheless, most studies
of seminal HIV shedding among males receiving suppressive
ART report prevalence rates of 6%–8%.
In conclusion, we observed a low prevalence and quantity of
HIV-1 semen shedding in heterosexual HIV-1–infected African
men who were receiving suppressive ART and had undetectable
HIV-1 levels in blood. This confirms the importance of ART for
suppressing the frequency and level of HIV-1 nucleic acid shed-
ding in seminal plasma.
