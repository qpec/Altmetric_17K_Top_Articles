Abstract
This systematic literature review examined the role of dietary macronutrient composition, food consumption
and dietary patterns in predicting weight or waist circumference (WC) change, with and without prior weight
reduction. The literature search covered year 2000 and onwards. Prospective cohort studies, case�control
studies and interventions were included. The studies had adult (18�70 y), mostly Caucasian participants. Out
of a total of 1,517 abstracts, 119 full papers were identified as potentially relevant. After a careful scrutiny, 50
papers were quality graded as A (highest), B or C. Forty-three papers with grading A or B were included in
evidence grading, which was done separately for all exposure-outcome combinations. The grade of evidence
was classified as convincing, probable, suggestive or no conclusion. We found probable evidence for high
intake of dietary fibre and nuts predicting less weight gain, and for high intake of meat in predicting more
weight gain. Suggestive evidence was found for a protective role against increasing weight from whole grains,
cereal fibre, high-fat dairy products and high scores in an index describing a prudent dietary pattern.
Likewise, there was suggestive evidence for both fibre and fruit intake in protection against larger increases in
WC. Also suggestive evidence was found for high intake of refined grains, and sweets and desserts in
predicting more weight gain, and for refined (white) bread and high energy density in predicting larger
increases in WC. The results suggested that the proportion of macronutrients in the diet was not important in
predicting changes in weight or WC. In contrast, plenty of fibre-rich foods and dairy products, and less
refined grains, meat and sugar-rich foods and drinks were associated with less weight gain in prospective
cohort studies. The results on the role of dietary macronutrient composition in prevention of weight regain
(after prior weight loss) were inconclusive.

T
he prevalence of obesity has increased globally
during the past 30 y (1). According to the WHO
statistics, 35% of adults aged 20 y and older were
overweight (BMI]25 kg/m2) in 2008 (2). The worldwide
prevalence of obesity has nearly doubled between 1980
and 2008. Moreover, WHO has estimated that worldwide
2.8 million people die each year as a result of being
overweight or obese, and an estimated 35.8 million (2.3%)
of global disability-adjusted life-years are caused by
overweight or obesity. A recent European study con-
cluded that in a worst-case scenario almost every third
European adult might be obese by year 2015 (3).
The total food supply has increased during the last
decades (4). When compared against the secular trends in
obesity, an increase in food supply and a concomitant
increase in total energy intake are likely to be one of the

 major drivers in the obesity epidemic (1). However, the
role of dietary macronutrient composition, intake of
specific food items or dietary patterns in development
of obesity is not clear.
During the last decade, a few narrative reviews have
addressed the role of diet in prevention of weight
gain (5�7). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have
focused on specific issues, like the role of sugar-sweetened
beverages (8�10). The results have been inconclusive.
Moreover, we are not aware of any recent (last 5 y) and
broad systematic reviews examining the associations of
dietary macronutrients, food intake and dietary patterns
vs. change in weight or waist circumference (WC) in adult
populations. These data are needed to, e.g. give support-
ing evidence in formulating new nutrition recommenda-
tions. The present work was done in connection to the
2012 Nordic Nutrition Recommendations. The purpose
of this systematic literature review was to examine the
associations of dietary macronutrient composition, food
consumption and dietary patterns in prevention of weight
or WC gain, with and without prior weight reduction.
Methods
Research questions and definitions
The research questions were formulated separately for
studies on primary prevention of weight gain and for
studies addressing weight regain after prior weight
reduction.
(1)
Primary prevention of obesity (maintenance of body
weight and/or WC):
What is the effect of different dietary macronutrient com-
position on long-term (]1 y) change in weight/WC/body
fat in an adult population?
(2)
Prevention of weight regain after weight loss (or
maintenance of reduced body weight):
What is the effect of different dietary macronutrient com-
position on long-term (]1 y) change in weight/WC/body
fat in individuals who have deliberately reduced their weight
by at least 5%?
In the search, dietary macronutrient composition was
defined as containing:
(1)
carbohydrates, fat and protein as % in energy intake
(2)
fat quality in diet: variation in saturated (SFA),
monounsaturated
(MUFA)
or
polyunsaturated
(PUFA) fatty acids, as % in energy intake or g/day
(3)
sugar intake as g/day or % in energy intake
(4)
fibre (fiber) intake as g/day
Several of the papers selected for the review contained
data on food consumption or dietary patterns. Conse-
quently, the review was expanded to include different
food items and food groups, such as cereal products,
whole-grain cereals, fruit, vegetables, milk and milk
products, meat, etc. Moreover, we also included studies
using a whole-diet approach, such as the Mediterranean
diet or an index for healthy eating (according to existing
dietary recommendations).
The search terms are shown in Appendix 1. The
databases used were PubMed and SweMed/SweMed�
(the latter was used to identify Nordic articles not
published in PubMed).
Inclusion criteria
The a priori defined inclusion criteria were as follows:
Publication year
� year 2000 and later
Study type
� Cross-sectional: excluded
� Follow-up (cohort): included but minimum follow-up 1 y
� Case�control: included
� Weight-maintenance interventions: included with the
following criteria: (1) intentional mean weight loss at
least 5%; (2) at least 6 months follow-up. The follow-
up (after weight reduction) could be non-randomised
(observational cohort study) or a randomised inter-
vention. In the latter case, the randomisation was done
after weight loss, in the beginning of the weight-
maintenance intervention. A further premise was that
weight reduction was similar in different weight-
maintenance groups. Weight loss interventions were
also accepted if the total duration was longer than 3 y.
Age
� Inclusion criteria: adult. Age range 18�70 y.
� Exclusion: studies with �70 y participants only and
those in which results were not separately analysed by
age (i.e. �70 y participants in their own group)
Race/geographical location
� Studies without Caucasians or with Caucasians as
minority group were excluded
Selection and evaluation of papers
The abstracts after the initial search were screened by
two of the authors (Sigmund Anderssen and Ingibjo
¨rg
Gunnarsdottir). All articles suggested by at least one of
the two were ordered as full papers. The two other
authors (Mikael Fogelholm and Marjaana Lahti-Koski)

 then screened the full papers. Again, papers suggested by
at least one of them were at least preliminary included in
the quality assessment (most careful scrutiny) and
evaluation table. Also reviews were ordered as full papers.
However, they were not eventually included in the quality
grading, because of too much variation in, for example,
inclusion criteria, years covered and age groups included.
The quality assessment of the papers was done accord-
ing to the principles of the Nordic Nutrition Recommen-
dation 2012 working group (11). In short, all papers were
evaluated according to a three-scale grading: A�high
quality studies with very low level of potential bias;
B�some bias, but not enough to invalidate the results;
C�significant bias and weaknesses that may invalidate
the results. The preliminary quality assessments and
construction of summary tables were done individually
(Marjaana
Lahti-Koski:
macronutrients
and
weight
change; SA and IG: food consumption and weight change,
dietary patterns and weight change; MF: weight change
after weight reduction), but the final product was cross-
checked together by all authors.
After the quality grading, four summary tables (macro-
nutrients, food consumption, dietary patterns and weight
change after weight reduction) were formed from all
studies quality graded A or B. In these tables, the results
were arranged according to exposure and outcome
variables. However, we did not separate unadjusted and
adjusted (to BMI) WC. We always chose the model
with most adjustments as the statistical outcome. More-
over, we used analyses with sexes combined, if possible.
Otherwise the results of men and women are presented
separately. We did not use any other stratification
variables, such as prior weight change or smoking.
The grading of evidence was based on the summary
tables and a four-class grading: convincing (high), prob-
able (moderate), suggestive (low) and no conclusion
(insufficient). The minimum requirement for ‘suggestive’
was two studies showing an association, and no conflict-
ing results. If some studies showed ns (neither positive
nor negative association), it was decided that for ‘sugges-
tive evidence’, the number of results showing an associa-
tion was required to be at least two higher than those
showing no association.
Results
A total of 1,517 abstracts were initially screened for
eligibility (Fig. 1). Out of these, 119 were selected and
ordered as full papers. A total of 50 papers were quality
graded (12�61). These include 41 papers identified
through the original literature search and nine additional
papers (17, 30, 31, 32, 36, 45, 47, 51, 55) found from the
reference lists of the other publications or ‘related
citations’ in PubMed. The reasons for excluding 78 full
papers (5, 8�10, 62�135) are shown in Appendix 2. The
number of studies with data on body composition was
low and therefore our analyses are based only on weight
(BMI) and WC.
The evidence tables (Appendix 3�6) present all studies
with quality assessment. Studies on the association
between macronutrients and weight change are presented
in Appendix 3. Studies using energy density as an ex-
posure were also included here. Studies on food contsump-
tion and weight change are presented in Appendix 4.
Studies using glycaemic index (GI) or glycaemic load (GL)
as the main exposure variable are also shown here.
Appendix 5 presents the studies on dietary patterns and
weight change, and Appendix 6 shows studies on weight
change after prior weight reduction (studies on weight
regain). The results are summarised for the grading of
evidence in Tables 1�4 (in the text).
Macronutrients and change in weight or WC
Most of the studies used for the grading of evidence
for the association between macronutrient intake and
weight change were prospective cohort studies (Table 1
and Appendix 3). The spread of exposures against the
two optional outcomes (change in weight or WC) was
large, and most exposure-outcome combinations were
assessed by only one or two studies. This leads inevitably
to difficulties in finding any evidence for associations
between macronutrient intakes and weight change.
The evidence linking high fibre intake to prevention of
weight gain was considered probable. In addition, three
suggestive associations were found, for cereal fibre against
weight change, and for fibre and energy density against
change in WC. Five studies assessed weight gain in relation
to fibre intake. The association was negative (high fibre
intake indicated smaller weight gain) in three studies
(14, 18, 21, 26), while one (19) did not find an association.
A similar, albeit slightly weaker conclusion was obtained

 for cereal fibre (14, 35). Also studies analysing the associa-
tion between fruit fibre against weight change (35), or the
association between total fibre and change in WC (14, 23),
tended to favour a protective role of fibre intake.
The other suggestive evidence on the role of dietary
macronutrients in development of obesity was observed
for energy density (total energy intake divided by the
weight of food consumed) against change in WC: both
identified studies (13, 23) reported that higher energy
density was associated with larger increase in WC. The
results on energy density against weight change were
less consistent. Bes-Rastrollo et al. (12) reported that an
increase in energy density was associated with a simulta-
neous increase in weight, while two other studies (13, 19)
did not find an association.
The intake of total carbohydrates, fats and proteins
did not show consistent associations with weight gain.
Especially in the case of fat intake vs. weight change, the
number of studies (four) was in fact relatively high, but
the results were quite evenly dispersed between a positive
association (higher fat intake would increase weight gain)
(25, 42) and no significant association (16, 17). Similarly,
the results on intake of SFA or PUFA against develop-
ment of obesity indicated either a positive (15) or no
significant association (16). Field et al. (15) linked
MUFA with protection of weight gain, but this finding
was not confirmed in the study of Forouhi et al. (16).
Koh-Banerhee et al. (20) investigated the role of trans-
fatty acids (TFA): their results suggested that TFA, when
substituted for carbohydrates or PUFA, are associated
with increased WC. Also Field et al. (15) found a positive
association
between
TFA
intake
and
weight
gain.
Hence, all three analyses showed that high intake of
TFA predicts weight gain. The lack of multiple data on
specific combinations prevents us from making a stronger
conclusion.
Howard et al. reported that higher intake of total
carbohydrates protected against weight gain in women
(18), but Halkjaer et al. (17) did not find an association
between carbohydrate intake and change in weight or WC.
The source of carbohydrates may be relevant, however,
since Halkjaer et al. (17) reported a positive association
between carbohydrates from foods with simple sugars,
from potatoes and from refined grains, against change
in WC in women. In contrast, they also found that high
carbohydrates intake from vegetables (women only) and
fruit protected against an increase in WC.
The role of protein in prevention of an increase in
weight or WC was inconsistent: the two identified studies
reported a neutral (19) or negative (17) association.
Foods and change in weight or WC
Compared with the association between macronutrients
and weight change, a few more ‘suggestive’ associations
were found (Table 2 and Appendix 4). According to the
data, high intake of whole grains, fruit, nuts and high-fat
dairy protect against increasing obesity, whereas refined
grains, white bread, meat and sweets and desserts seem to
promote gains in weight or WC. Unfortunately, even here
the main challenge in making broader conclusions was
that the number of studies for a specific combination of
exposure and outcome was limited (rarely more than two
data points).
The suggestive association linking high intake of whole
grains to lower weight gain was based on two cohort
studies (35, 36). No other studies in this combination of
exposure and outcome were found. However, Halkjaer
et al. (32) did not find an association between the intake
of wholegrain bread and change in WC. Two studies (33,
39) reported that a high intake of fruit predicted smaller
increase in WC, with no conflicting results. On the other
hand, studies linking fruit to changes in weight were not
equally consistent (36, 45).
Three studies reported a negative association between
intake of nuts and change in weight (30, 36, 60), and no
conflicting data were found. The evidence was regarded
as probable. Unfortunately, these studies are not fully
independent, since two of them are partly or totally based
on data from the Nurses’ Health Study (30, 36).
Several studies have investigated the role of dairy
products in prevention of weight gain. Again, the defi-
nition of exposure variable was inconsistent (dairy in
general, high-fat dairy, low-fat dairy, etc.) and this left
only a few relevant combinations for assessment in this
review. Both studies examining the relationship between
high-fat dairy and weight gain reported a negative
association, that is, higher intake of these dairy products
was associated with smaller gains in weight (38, 50). Also
some other studies found a protective role for dairy
products (33, 36, 39, 41), while others did not report any
significant associations between dairy intake and change
in weight or WC (32, 38). There were no studies with a
positive association between any kind of dairy products
and change in weight or WC.
The intake of refined bread was associated with an
increase in WC in both studies identified for this review
(32, 39). A similar supporting evidence was observed for
the positive association between refined grain and weight
change (21, 36).
Three studies reported a positive association between
meat intake and weight change (40, 44, 50) and this
evidence was regarded as probable. The studies of Rosell
et al. (40) and Vergnaud et al. (44) are not, however,
totally independent: the former was based on a subpopu-
lation of the EPIC-cohort, while the latter used the entire
cohort for analyses. Some other studies also linked higher
intake of meat, poultry or processed meat with an increase
in weight or WC (33, 36, 39). No association were re-
ported by a few (28, 32, 33), whereas Halkjaer et al. (33)

 found that higher intake of red meat protected against an
increase in WC, adjusted for BMI.
Two studies reported that a high intake of sweets and
desserts, was associated with larger weight increases (36,
42). This association could be classified as suggestive.
Two studies found a positive association between intake
of sugar-sweetened soft drinks (SSSD) and weight or WC
gain (39, 43), while such as association was not confirmed
in a third study (28). However, there were no studies
suggesting an inverse association of sugar-rich foods and
change in weight or WC.
The few results linking GI or GL to changes in weight
or WC were dispersed between a positive (23, 31, 34) and
no association (23, 34). It may be worth noting that a
positive association between GI/GL vs. change in weight
or WC was more often observed in women than in men
(23, 34).
Dietary patterns and weight change
We identified five studies with results on the relationship
between dietary patterns and weight change (Table 3
and Appendix 5). Three of these used an index of the
Mediterranean diet (47, 49, 50) and two others the
American Diet Quality Index (48, 51). The index for
Mediterranean diet is based on the consumption of
‘positive’ (e.g. fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains,
fish, olive oil) and ‘negative’ (e.g. meat and dairy)
food items. The Diet Quality Index is based on US dietary
recommendations: it is a measure of how well an
individual meets the recommendations for SFA, choles-
terol, sodium, total fat and total carbohydrate.
Both studies using the Diet Quality Index reported that
meeting the recommendations was associated with less
weight gain during the follow-up (48, 51). The evidence is
suggestive. Two studies with the Mediterranean index
supported this conclusion (47, 49), while the third study
did not find an association between Mediterranean
dietary patterns and weight change after all statistical
adjustments (50).
Macronutrients and prevention of weight regain after
weight loss
Only nine studies were identified with data on the asso-
ciation between dietary macronutrient composition and
weight gain after prior weight reduction (Table 4 and
Appendix 6). All six studies classified as A or B were
randomised weight-maintenance interventions. Delbridge
et al. (59) prescribed a weight-maintenance diet with en-
ergy intake corresponding to 1.3�estimated resting
energy expenditure, but all other studies used ad lib
energy intake throughout the weight-maintenance phase.
Overall, the results were inconclusive and it was not
possible to make any conclusions.
A
high-protein,
low-carbohydrate
diet
protected
against weight regain in on study (55), but no effects
were observed in three other studies (52, 53, 59). Due et al.
(54) found that both a high-fat, low-carbohydrate, and a
low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet reduced weight regain,

tected against weight regain at 2-y follow-up, but this

Finally, Larsen et al. (55) found that a diet with low GI
prevented weight regain, when compared against a high
GI diet. This effect was observed regardless of the
macronutrient composition. However, the most effective
combination in terms of prevention of weight regain after
weight reduction was high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet
with low GI.
Discussion
Interpretation of results
The main findings of this systematic review on nutrients
and foods in relation to weight change were the following:
we found probable evidence for high intake of dietary
fibre and nuts predicting less weight gain, and for high
intake of meat in predicting more weight gain. Suggestive
evidence was found for a protective role against increas-
ing weight from whole grains, cereal fibre, high-fat dairy
products and high scores in an index describing a prudent
dietary pattern. Likewise, there was suggestive evidence
for both fibre and fruit intake in protection against larger
increases in WC. Also suggestive evidence was found for
high intake of refined grains, and sweets and desserts in
predicting more weight gain, and for refined (white)
bread and high energy density in predicting larger
increases in WC.
A major problem in assessing the grade of evidence
was that similar combinations of exposure and outcome
variables were eventually quite rare. Therefore, we
decided to do a post hoc evidence analysis by first
combining the outcome variables. Although WC, com-
pared with BMI, may be a slightly stronger risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes and breast and
colorectal cancers, they both can be used as a measure of
obesity in population studies almost interchangeably
(136, 137). Moreover, to get more studies into one
evidence grading, we grouped foods by their closeness
of nutrient composition. The results of these post hoc
analyses are shown in Table 5. Since we may violate
the strict rules of evidence grading by subjectively
combining different exposure variables, this analysis is
‘unofficial’ and the grading of evidence is not shown in
the table.
We combined studies with fibre, vegetables, fruit, fruit
fibre, carbohydrates from fruit & vegetables, whole
grains, whole grain bread or nuts as an exposure variable
into one group called ‘fibre-rich foods’. Some studies
included several analyses, either separately for men and
women, or for different exposure and/or outcome vari-
ables. Hence, the identified 14 studies included a total of
28 analyses. Out of these, 21 results (13 with both sexes, 4
with only women and 4 with only men) indicated that a
higher intake of at least one of these ‘fibre-rich foods’ is
associated with prevention of obesity. Eight analyses did
not find a significant association. In this light, the
evidence for a protective role of fibre-rich foods in
general might be considered moderately strong.
The use of fibre-rich products reduce dietary energy
density by increasing the volume of food without bringing
additional absorbable energy (12). Fruit and vegetables
have a low GI, whereas fibre-rich bread may induce a
lowered insulin response and delayed glucose decline
(138). Both properties could increase satiety and reduce
energy consumption (139). In addition, other biologically
active compounds in fruit, vegetables and whole grain
(e.g. phenolic compounds and phytoestrogens) may be
related to weight control (35).
Nuts may be regarded as a ‘special case’ among fibre-
rich products, not least because of their high fat content.
Nevertheless, even earlier epidemiological evidence sug-
gests an inverse association between nut consumption and
body weight (140). The proposed mechanisms include
increased energy expenditure due to high protein and

 unsaturated fatty-acid content, enhanced satiety and
ineffective absorption of fat (140). Short-term interven-
tions have not shown any effects of nuts on body weight,
whereas nut consumption seems to improve blood lipid
levels in a dose-related manner (141).
Refined grains, carbohydrates from refined grains
and refined bread formed a group called ‘refined grain
foods’. Four studies included five analyses, and all
of them showed an association between high intake of
refined grains and increasing obesity. The level of
evidence could be regarded as probable, but slightly
weaker than the evidence seen for fibre-rich foods.
Refined grain products have often high GI, high insulin
response and a fast glucose decline even below baseline
in an oral test (138). These properties could increase
hunger and enhance lipogenesis, thereby promoting
obesity (142). The different effects of whole-grain and
refined cereals speak for separating different types of
cereals in the food pyramid.
Also potatoes have high GI, and therefore it could be
plausible to think that they � like refined grains � could
induce obesity. The results of our review were not very
convincing: two analyses supported the above hypothesis,
while two other did not find an association between
potato consumption and weight or WC change. It is
possible that the way potatoes are prepared is important:
Mozaffarian et al. (36) reported a positive association
between potato consumption and weight gain, but in this
study a majority of the potatoes was French fries.
All dairy products were combined to form a new
group called ‘dairy foods’. In our ‘official’ analyses, we
found suggestive evidence for a protecting role of high-
fat dairy foods. The combined data did not strengthen
this result. A total of four analyses showed a positive
association between dairy food consumption and in-
creasing obesity, whereas five analyses did not report
any associations. If there indeed is an association
between dairy products and prevention of weight gain,
the proposed mechanisms might be related to calcium,
protein or biopeptides (143). More research is needed to
find out whether the mechanism could be related to
milk fat. Earlier studies have, in contrast, indicated that
unsaturated, rather than saturated, fatty acids may
promote postprandial fat oxidation and stimulate diet-
induced thermogenesis (144). The two studies showing
an association between high-fat dairy and less weight
gain (38, 50) did not very clearly specify their defini-
tion of dairy products, e.g. if only milk products were
included. However, butter was apparently not included
in either study.
A majority of the studies support the hypothesis that
a high consumption of meat and meat products predict
more weight gain. This finding might be considered
confusing, because of the proposed satiating effects of
protein (145). However, meat is energy dense and might
thereby increase energy intake (44). It is also possible
that meat intake only reflects some undetected dietary
or lifestyle patterns that contribute to weight gain (44).

 Yet another possibility is that meat increases fat-free
mass and that BMI in this case would be misleading.
Interestingly, the two studies showing a preventive
role for protein or meat used WC as the outcome
(17, 33). On the other hand, two studies identified
poultry or processed meat as a predictor of larger gains
in WC (33, 39).
We found suggestive evidence for an obesity-promoting
role of sweets and desserts. Since the contribution of
sweets to total energy intake is small (146), a likely
explanation for this finding is residual confounding, that
is, consumption of sweets probably mirror some other
unhealthy dietary and/or physical activity patterns that
lead to positive energy balance. In fact, we were rather
expecting to find an association between the use of SSSD
and weight gain. Out of the identified three studies, two
suggested that SSSD predict weight or WC gain (39, 43),
but the third (28) found an association only in a subgroup
with prior weight gain. Hence, according to our strict
rules we had to classify these data as inconclusive. Recent
systematic reviews have also produced conflicting results
on the association between SSSD and weight gain (8�10).
A majority of the results suggesting a positive association
between SSSD and weight gain have studied children and
adolescents (8, 9). The compilation of different sugar-
containing foods into one analysis did not bring any
additional insights.
It is perhaps not a surprise that adherence to a
presumed healthy diet predicts less weight gain. It is
interesting that the Healthy Diet Index is in fact composed
of items without any clear association with weight (total
fat, saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, salt, carbohydrates)
� and yet a diet fulfilling these requirements is at the same
time suitable for weight control. The Mediterranean Diet
Index is built from foods and many of the ‘positive’ foods
are high in dietary fibre and these foods have in this review
been identified as predictors of better weight control.
Moreover, meat is considered a ‘negative’ item in the
Mediterranean Diet Index and we found suggestive
evidence for meat as a predictor for weight gain. The
only discrepancy is related to dairy products which are
‘negative’ in the Mediterranean Diet Index, but, if any-
thing, protective against weight gain in our review.
Methodological considerations
The criteria for A-grading were very strict. Because of the
understandable crudeness of epidemiological methods, all
really large studies (e.g. EPIC, Nurses’ Health Study, etc.)
were classified as B, while some clearly smaller studies
sometimes received an A-rating. In the end, this did not
have an impact on the analyses, since all studies classified
as A or B were included in the summary tables.
Most of the studies identified for this review were
prospective cohort designs. Although interventions would
be much stronger in identifying causal effects, the
possibility to study long-term (5�20 y) weight changes
by using an intervention design would be extremely
challenging and expensive. All prospective cohort studies
need careful control for potential confounders. Although
practically all A- and B-graded cohorts in our review
were able to control for a multiple of potential confound-
ing variables, residual confounding cannot be ruled
out (147). Therefore, it is unclear whether the identified
positive or negative associations really are effects of
nutrients or foods vs. weight or WC.
One interesting point is whether energy intake should
be included in the model. While adjusting for total energy
intake may control for over- and under-reporting, energy
intake is also a potential mechanism explaining the
association between a nutrient/food and weight gain.
Therefore, adjusting for energy intake might be regarded
as overadjustment, which may dilute the real association
between food/nutrient and weight change. For future
studies, it would be recommendable to present models
with energy intake as the only differing variable (to see if
the inclusion of energy intake in the model has an effect
on the results). We did not look for a potential associa-
tion between total energy intake and weight change, since
a positive energy balance is too much dependent on the
level of total physical activity and energy expenditure.
A scrutiny on the interaction between physical activity
and diet, against weight change, was also outside the
focus of this review.
Measurements of dietary intake and food consumption
at baseline are usually inaccurate. Most of the population
studies covered in this review used a food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ). Although many of the FFQ’s have
been validated (see Appendix 3�5), the validation was
often restricted to certain nutrients. For instance, we are
not aware of a FFQ planned to assess GI or dietary
density. In addition to inaccurate baseline estimation, an
individual’s dietary pattern may change during the follow-
up. These lead to misclassifications of exposure and to at
least some attenuation of association towards unity (type
II error). In this light it is interesting to note that there
were very few totally conflicting findings (same exposure
showing both negative and positive association with the
outcome). If some of the non-significant findings were
indeed type II errors, there may be in reality more
associations between diet and weight change than found
in the present review.
Another point � which is in a way opposite to the
previous � is that the large number of participants in
several studies allows identification of even very small
differences between groups (e.g. lowest vs. highest 25%).
The practical significance of these differences is uncer-
tain. Most studies have assessed the association between
single nutrients and food items against weight change, but
aggregating single foods into composite scores yields
more robust estimations (36, 39). By combining exposure

 variables (foods) into larger groups, as shown in Table 5,
we wanted to improve the robustness of our analysis. To
be meaningful, however, even these results should prob-
ably be translated into diet-level recommendations.
Many cohorts were initiated more than 10 y ago. This
is perhaps not very meaningful for analyses using foods,
food groups or dietary patterns. However, since a certain
macronutrient composition can be achieved by different
food choices, the interpretation of the oldest studies
should be done with care: for instance, a certain propor-
tion of carbohydrates and fat in a diet in 1980s might be
related to different food choices than a similar macronu-
trient distribution in 2012. This may also have a relevance
to the association between macronutrients and weight
gain. Finally, it may relevant to repeat that the review
covered publication years 2000�2012, and this may have
excluded important older studies. Moreover, although
PubMed is a very comprehensive database and it covers
all major international medical journals, it is possible that
some additional studies could have been identified by
using, e.g. EMBASE or Scopus. The potential bias caused
by using only PubMed and SweMed�is, however, con-
sidered negligible.
Conclusion
In this systematic review covering publications from year
2000 onwards, we found probable evidence for high
intake of dietary fibre and nuts predicting less weight
gain, and for high intake of meat in predicting more
weight gain. Suggestive evidence was found for a
protective role against increasing weight from whole
grains, cereal fibre, high-fat dairy products and high
scores in an index describing a prudent dietary pattern.
Likewise, there was suggestive evidence for both fibre and
fruit intake in protection against larger increases in WC.
Also suggestive evidence was found for high intake of
refined grains, and sweets and desserts in predicting more
weight gain, and for refined (white) bread and high
energy density in predicting larger increases in WC. When
foods with similar nutrient composition were combined
for an unofficial analysis, fibre-rich foods in general
predicted less weight gain and this association could be
regarded as moderately strong (probably). The associa-
tions between foods and dietary patterns vs. weight gain
were stronger compared to those between macronutrients
vs. weight gain. In general, the results suggest that the
proportion of macronutrients in the diet is not important
in prevention of obesity. In contrast, plenty of fibre-rich
foods and dairy products, and less refined grains, meat
and sugar-rich foods and drinks were associated with less
weight gain in prospective cohort studies.
