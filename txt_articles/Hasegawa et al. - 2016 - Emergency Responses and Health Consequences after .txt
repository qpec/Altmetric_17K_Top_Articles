Abstract
The Fukushima accident was a compounding disaster following the strong earthquake and huge tsunami. The direct health effects of radiation were relatively
well controlled considering the severity of the accident, not only among emergency workers but also residents. Other serious health issues include deaths
during evacuation, collapse of the radiation emergency medical system, increased mortality among displaced elderly people and public healthcare issues in
Fukushima residents. The Fukushima mental health and lifestyle survey disclosed that the Fukushima accident caused severe psychological distress in the
residents from evacuation zones. In addition to psychiatric and mental health problems, there are lifestyle-related problems such as an increase proportion of
those overweight, an increased prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia and changes in health-related behaviours among evacuees; all
of which may lead to an increased cardiovascular disease risk in the future. The effects of a major nuclear accident on societies are diverse and enduring. The
countermeasures should include disaster management, long-term general public health services, mental and psychological care, behavioural and societal
support, in addition to efforts to mitigate the health effects attributable to radiation.

Introduction
The Three Mile Island nuclear power plant (NPP) acci-
dent in 1979, the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and the
Fukushima accident in 2011 have issues in common that
were not directly related to the physical effects of radiation
exposure. Of course, in the Chernobyl accident, acute radi-
ation injuries in acute phase and thyroid cancer in the
paediatric population were reported [1]. However, the other
health effects, such as mental health issues, behavioural
changes and lifestyle-related health problems, have become
more significant as those have not been properly addressed
as general health risks after major nuclear accidents [2]. An
extreme example was the loss of life in the evacuation of
hospital inpatients in the Fukushima accident [3]. Evacua-
tion of the inpatients and elderly residents of nursing care
facilities was hurriedly carried out by buses shortly after the
accident. No medical personnel accompanied the evacuees
who were laid down on the seats of the jam-packed buses
with full protective suits on. No medical care, even food or
water, was provided for many hours during the evacuation.
As a result, scores of patients died in an evacuation that was

 supposedly intended to minimise radiation exposure. The
life-threatening risk to these people was not radiation, but
discontinuation of daily medical care. A recent study indi-
cated that the severe health risk associated with the rapid
evacuation of elderly residents from nursing care facilities
after the Fukushima accident was 30 times higher than the
radiation risk of the reference levels for evacuation that are
recommended by the International Committee for Radio-
logical Protection [4].
Presently, more than 400 NPPs are operated in the world,
and more will be built in developing countries in search of
efficient and stable energy sources. Of course, we should
never underestimate the menace of nature that can lead to a
compound disaster, such as in Fukushima. We need to
prepare for the worst case scenario even if the chance of a
severe nuclear accident is quite rare. We need to clarify
what we have learned from the Fukushima accident and
how we will utilise it, what are the unanswered questions
we are faced with and what we need to share with the next
generation.
This overview describes the initial medical responses
after the Fukushima accident and the health consequences
encountered in the evacuation and relocation of residents,
with a special emphasis on not only medical but also psy-
chological and societal perspectives related to the Fukush-
ima accident.
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
Accident
Before the Fukushima accident, there were 54 NPPs in
operation, producing one third of the electricity in Japan [5].
On 11 March 2011, a 9-magnitude earthquake occurred off
the east coast of Japan, generating massive tsunamis, which
severely
damaged
coastal
areas.
The
earthquake
and
tsunami also hit the NPPs located in the coastal area in
Tohoku and led to the loss of the entire core cooling capacity
of the three reactors of Fukushima Daiichi NPP and severe
damage to the nuclear cores. Consequently, substantial
amounts of radioactive substances were released into the
environment [6e8].
Emergency Responses after the Nuclear Power Plant
Accident
In Fukushima, the radiation emergency medical system
had been developed within the framework of the national
radiation emergency medical system. Six hospitals were
designated as primary radiation emergency medical facil-
ities, which assumed roles in providing initial treatment
and decontamination; one was designated as a secondary
radiation emergency hospital to provide advanced treat-
ment of radiation injuries.
At the time of the accident, up to 76 000 people lived
within an area of a 20 km radius from the Fukushima
Daiichi NPP. After the accident occurred, more than 97% of
residents living in the 20 km radius had evacuated by 15
March, when the highest amount of radioactive plume was
released from the plant [9]. However, the evacuation of
residents did not go well. As the situation of the nuclear
reactors became more unsure the government progres-
sively expanded evacuation zones from within a radius of 3,
10 and 20 km of the NPP. More than 20% of evacuees were
obliged to relocate more than six times as the evacuation
zone expanded, due to the lack of evacuation plan, which
extended greater than a 10 km radius from the NPP [6]. In
addition, information about radiation levels and the evac-
uation process itself were not available, i.e. how to prepare,
how long it may last; nor were instructions on how to
protect oneself from radiation exposure or how to vacate
their homes provided. Insufficient transportation and dis-
ruptions in electricity, water, gas supply, telecommunica-
tions and radiation-monitoring systems caused by the
earthquake made it more difficult to implement an organ-
ised evacuation [6].
On 12 March, the first hydrogen explosion took place at
the Unit 1 reactor building and five workers sustained in-
juries. Although most of the injuries were not severe, no
field triage or initial treatment was carried out. On 14
March, the Unit 3 reactor building exploded and 11 workers
sustained injuries. In this explosion, an emergency doctor,
who coincidentally stayed at the off-site centre located
5 km from the NPP, triaged the injured individuals. How-
ever, it was quite difficult for the injured workers to access
medical services because local emergency medical hospitals
had either closed or were not functional [10].
Japan’s radiation emergency medical system was devel-
oped to address work-related accidents [10], not for such
large-scale
natural
disasters
as
with
Fukushima
[6].
Accordingly, after the accident, six hospitals designated as
primary radiation emergency hospitals closed or failed to
function properly owing to evacuation or indoor sheltering
orders, damaged facilities and infrastructure disruption
caused by the earthquake and the outflow of medical staff in
fear of radiation danger [11]. Fukushima Medical University,
which was designated as a secondary radiation emergency
hospital, was the only hospital to respond to emergency
medical needs [12]. To support Fukushima Medical Uni-
versity’s efforts, a nationwide network of radiation emer-
gency medical services was established by the end of March
2011 [12,13].
Evacuation of Hospitals and Nursing Care Facilities
The Fukushima accident underscored critical issues
regarding the evacuation of hospitals and nursing care fa-
cilities. After the government issued evacuation orders, the
emergency evacuation of about 2200 inpatients and elderly
people at nursing care facilities was arranged. On 14 March,
more than 800 patients, who were hospitalised and
remained behind at medical or nursing facilities located
within a 20 km radius from the plant, were urgently evac-
uated. Information on the patients, i.e. patients’ names,
conditions, even the exact number of patients, was not
available. They were transported by buses or police vehicles
for a relatively long time, in some cases for more than 48 h.
However, no medical personnel were in attendance and no

238
 medical care, not even water or food, was provided during
or after the evacuation. Unfortunately, at least 50 elderly
patients died in this evacuation. Hypothermia, deterioration
of underlying medical problems and dehydration were
suspected as the causes of death [3]. The lack of medical
support before, during and after the evacuation was regar-
ded as the major reason for the loss of life during the
evacuation.
Another evacuation of hospital patients was planned
after the evacuation of the 20 km radius from the plant. On
15 March, the national government issued an order for in-
door sheltering in the 20e30 km radius [6]. After this
sheltering order, the flow of daily necessities to the region
stopped
owing
to
concerns
over
radiation
exposure
expressed by delivery personnel. The 20e30 km region
became virtually isolated. Hospitals and nursing facilities
suffered seriously because medical supplies, gasoline and
other daily commodities could not be obtained. Soon, a
decision to evacuate hospitals and nursing care facilities in
this area was made. However, this time, medical support
teams, such as the disaster medical assistance team, trans-
port vehicles, adjustment of transport routes and arrange-
ment of admitting hospitals and facilities were organised in
advance under the control of headquarters. Although the
evacuation of patients took 4 days, from 18 to 22 March, no
lives were lost during the evacuation of 509 inpatients and
elderly people from nursing care facilities [14,15]. This
emphasises the importance of medical support in evacu-
ating hospitals and nursing care facilities.
Medical Needs for the Emergency Workers
In response to the accident, the re-establishment of
temporary cooling facilities for the three damaged reactors
and the spent fuel pool of the Unit 4 reactor building was
the first priority, followed by development of stable cooling
systems to achieve a stable cold shutdown of the reactors,
removal of radioactive debris and rubble, establishment of
breakwaters and installation of a covering container over
the Unit 1 reactor building [6]. These operations continued
until the end of 2011. From 11 March 2011 to 31 March 2012,
20 961 workers were involved in the restoration operations
at the Fukushima Daiichi NPP [16,17].
In the first month after the accident occurred (March
2011), 67 workers sought emergency medical care, including
those injured in two hydrogen explosions. Of note, most of
them complained of medical problems, such as general fa-
tigue and sickness, which were not attributable to radiation
exposure. By 30 June 2012, 264 workers had been treated at
the site [16]. Three deaths occurred in April, August 2011 and
January 2012. Two deaths were due to cardiac arrest asso-
ciated with acute myocardial infarction. Another individual
with uncontrolled diabetes died of severe sepsis.
Among the emergency care required, trauma accounted
for 49.6% (131 cases). Most of them occurred in the first 5
months after the accident occurred (from 12 March to July
2011). With respect to the severity of trauma, only one
patient exceeded an injury severity score of 15. Fortunately,
no deaths from trauma occurred during this period.
Radiological contamination was observed in six cases, all of
which occurred in March 2011 [16].
Heat stroke was one of the major concerns as the sum-
mer season approached. The workers needed to wear per-
sonal protective equipment with a full face mask. An
increase in the incidence of heat illness was observed in
May, June and July 2011. Among 44 workers who presented
with heat illness, only two cases required hospital admis-
sion. Repeated advice was provided by the Tokyo Electric
Power Company to all workers in the Fukushima Daiichi
NPP, such as wearing cooling jackets under protective suits,
taking rest and sufficient fluids regularly, considering the
wet-bulb globe temperature and avoiding any activities
between 2 and 4 pm [16].
Regarding radiation exposure, 96% of the workers at
Fukushima Daiichi NPP were exposed to less than 50 mSv.
All of those whose radiation doses were greater than
100 mSv were exposed very shortly after the accident. A
total radiation dose of greater than 200 mSv was observed
in nine workers. Of these, two workers were exposed to
greater than 600 mSv, with 679 mSv being the highest
(external exposure, 89mSv; internal exposure, 590mSv).
The workers who had doses greater than 100 mSv were
regular employees hired by the Tokyo Electric Power
Company. Most of those with less than 20 mSv radiation
dose were hired by other companies. Fortunately, no acute
radiation syndrome had been observed among the affected
people in the Fukushima accident to date [18].
To coordinate efforts for emergency medical care and to
provide
an
adequate
working
environment
for
NPP
personnel, the Emergency Medical System Network was
established: its purpose is to examine occupational envi-
ronments, institute preventive medicine, particularly in
summer to prevent heat stroke, in winter to control infec-
tion, and to conduct follow-ups of workers with chronic
illnesses and mental health problems [16].
Major Public Health Consequences due to Dislocation
The establishment of a restricted zone in a radiation
disaster forces large numbers of residents out of the area,
where they stay in temporary shelters or other places for
long periods of time [19,20]. Life conditions in shelters may
lead to various types of health issues, such as outbreaks of
communicable diseases, mental stress and cardiovascular
diseases [21e23]. Sudden changes in lifestyle in unfamiliar
places may result in behavioural problems due to poor
adaptation to new circumstances. Medical attention will be
required from various healthcare disciplines.
In Fukushima Prefecture alone, the number of displaced
residents was 86 308 in March 2011, and it reached the peak
at 99 205 in June 2011 [24]. In addition, the number of res-
idents who voluntarily moved out of Fukushima Prefecture
increased from 38 896 in March 2011 to 62 831 in 12 months
[25]. The Fukushima accident highlighted the importance of
non-radiation-related health issues, such as severe health
risks during evacuation, as described above, and long-term
displacement of vulnerable people, and the magnitude of
problems related to mental, psychological and social factors.

 Disaster-related Death
After the Great East Japan Earthquake, more than
460 000 people were displaced to about 2400 shelters
throughout Japan. According to the report on disaster-
related death (DRD) in the Great East Japan Earthquake
issued by the Reconstruction Agency of Japan (2012), 2688
people died at shelters or temporary houses by 31 March
2013; these were DRDs [26]. DRD is defined as a death
caused by the deterioration of underlying medical prob-
lems due to poor medical access or illnesses arising from
poor living environments, such as temporary shelters, in a
disaster. About 90% of DRDs were over 66 years old, and
more than one third died within 1 month after the
earthquake. The number of deaths among three Tohoku
prefectures was the highest in Fukushima (1914 deaths)
[27]. The government report indicated that the effects of
the nuclear accident might be the major reason for a
higher
mortality
of
displaced
elderly
in
Fukushima.
Another study reported that the effect of the disaster on
the
excess
mortality
of
institutionalised
elderly
in
Fukushima was most significant in the immediate after-
math because of undesirable living conditions and poor
access to medical care. After the accident, the mortality
rate among evacuated elderly people requiring nursing
care tripled in the first 3 months after the evacuation and
continued to be higher at about 1.5 times afterward
compared with before the accident [28e30] (Figure 1).
Relocation
of
these
elderly
people
was
unavoidable
because of the shortage of medical resources in the region,
which had a lasting effect on mortality due to continuing
changes in nutritional, hygiene, medical and general care
conditions.
Many healthcare professionals headed for the disaster-
stricken areas. Less than 2 months after the quake, about
24 000 medical personnel were involved in medical activ-
ities in Tohoku regions (Health and Labor Ministry 2011).
However, these medical resources may not have been uti-
lised effectively in Fukushima because of concerns over
radiation; information on radiation and the situation of
vulnerable people was not properly shared nor was
sufficient communication among related personnel estab-
lished during the disaster response [13,31].
Mental Health Problems and Poor Health Perceptions
Fukushima residents showed deep concerns about the
potential health effects of exposure to radiation, even
though their dose was estimated to be very low [32e35].
The Fukushima Health Management Survey, which was
commissioned by the Fukushima government, revealed the
various effects on mental health as well as physical health
among evacuated residents [36]. The results suggested that
severe mental health problems and poor health perceptions
existed among adult Fukushima evacuees, and also indi-
cated that severe traumatic factors may have affected the
mental health of adult evacuees. Not surprisingly, emer-
gency workers were more susceptible to psychological
trauma than the general affected population [37e39].
In addition to the psychiatric problems, complicated
psychosocial
issues
arose
in
or
out
of
Fukushima.
Discordance exists among families and society due to
displacement, fear of radioactive exposure, compensation,
employment and other personal reasons [40]. Stigma was
another issue among the evacuees as well as the public. The
variety of psychosocial reactions among those affected by
the accident can be summarised within five main issues
[41]: post-traumatic stress response, chronic anxiety and
guilt, ambiguous loss, separated families and communities,
and stigma (Table 1). With the exception of post-traumatic
stress responses, four of the five main issues are unique in
Fukushima and have never been seen in other Tohoku areas
affected by the tsunami. Furthermore, these psychosocial
reactions may contribute to more serious consequences,
such as suicide or alcohol abuse. In fact, after the Fukushima
accident, the standardised suicide mortality ratio decreased
initially (107 in 2011, 94 in 2012, 96 in 2013) but then rose to
126 in 2014, thus exceeding the pre-disaster level [42]. To
prevent suicide or other self-destructive behaviours, coun-
termeasures such as facilities and care networks providing
targeted psychiatric interventions are needed, in order to
enhance existing resources.

 Lifestyle-related Problems
Because many evacuees in the Fukushima Prefecture
were forced to change several aspects of their lifestyles,
including diet, physical exercise and smoking and alcohol
habits, risk factor for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia, would
be expected to increase. As part of the Fukushima Health
Management Survey, a longitudinal study examined data
collected from 41 633 Japanese men and women (mean age
67 years) sourced from general health check-ups conducted
in 13 communities near the Fukushima Daiichi NPP be-
tween 2008 and 2010. Follow-up examinations were con-
ducted from June 2011 to March 2013 and 27 486 men and
women received follow-up examinations after the disaster
(follow-up proportion 66%), with an average follow-up of
1.6 years. The proportion of overweight people (body mass
index � 25 kg/m2) significantly increased in both evacuees
(n ¼ 9671) and non-evacuees (n ¼ 17 815) after the disaster,
with greater changes in the proportion among evacuees
than non-evacuees. The proportions of overweight evac-
uees before and after the disaster were 31.8% and 39.4%,
respectively, whereas proportions among non-evacuees
were 28.3% and 30.3%, respectively [43]. A significantly
increased prevalence was observed in hypertension (from
53.9% to 60.1%), diabetes mellitus (10.2% to 12.2%), dyslipi-
daemia (44.3% to 53.4%), polycythaemia (0.9% to 1.5%) and
atrial fibrillation (1.5% to 2.4%) among evacuees when
compared before and after the evacuation [44e48]; these
were associated with increases in body weight. Further-
more, the evacuees had a 1.3e1.6-times higher risk of dys-
lipidaemia,
diabetes
mellitus,
and
being
overweight
compared with the non-evacuees in a prospective analysis
[43,45,46].
The National Health and Nutrition Survey reported that
the proportion of overweight people was unchanged from
2003 to 2012 among men aged 20e69 years and decreased
among women aged 40e69 years; the proportions of
overweight people in 2003 and 2012 were 29.5% and 29.6%
for men and 25.0% to 20.5% for women, respectively.
Therefore, the change in body weight in evacuees in
Fukushima after the disaster must be greater compared
with those in other areas of Japan. Results of a mental health
and lifestyle survey by the Fukushima Health Management
Survey showed that those who evacuated in response to
governmental direction tended to be less physically active,
consume more alcohol, experience greater psychological
stress and have difficulty sleeping after the disaster [36].
Thus, health-related behaviours could be an important
factor mediating the influence of evacuation on increased
cardiovascular disease and cancer risk factors. To prevent
future lifestyle-related diseases occurring secondarily to
long-term evacuation, urgent action is required from re-
searchers, together with local governments and commu-
nities,
to
determine
the
adverse
physical
effects
of
evacuation and to establish appropriate intervention pro-
grammes for targeting weight gain among evacuees.
Summary and Conclusion
In the Three Mile Island accident, an excessive load on
the telephone network, the lack and chaos of information,
as well as a poor evacuation plan of hospitals were iden-
tified. In the Chernobyl accident, mental, social and eco-
nomic effects were serious over a long period of time, with
reports on radiation effects including deaths from acute
radiation syndrome and the development of thyroid cancer
in children caused by exposure to radioactive iodine. In the
Fukushima accident, the health effects so far encountered
are associated with emergency evacuation of vulnerable
people from hospitals and nursing care facilities. Problems
common in both the Fukushima and the Three Mile Island
accidents included repeated expansions of evacuation
areas to the extent not assumed in advance, lack of evac-
uation planning in advance by hospitals and nursing care

 facilities or no specific plan, medical responses forcibly
required amid the ambiguous situations and indecisive
responses of administrative authorities. Those seen in
common
in
the
Chernobyl
and
Fukushima
accidents
included change in living environments and mental im-
pacts caused by a significantly long period of relocation of
residents (Table 2).
If a major NPP accident occurs, uncertainty about the
plant’s condition may result in a vacillating response by
administrative authorities, which heightens public anxiety
and distrust in those authorities. Insufficient information
about radiation may exacerbate the situation. Evacuation d
intended to minimise the health risks of radiation exposure
d may produce other serious health risks, particularly for
vulnerable populations. Establishing an evacuation zone
around the NPP results in the collapse of the local emer-
gency
medical
system;
this
leads
to
difficulties
in
responding to mass casualty events, such as explosions at
the plant, and common medical emergencies. In the long
term, displacing hundreds of thousands of citizens creates a
wide range of public healthcare and social issues, as
detailed above.
The effects of a major nuclear accident on societies are
diverse and enduring. The countermeasures should include
disaster management, long-term general public health
services, mental and psychological care, behavioural and
societal support, and efforts to mitigate the health effects
attributable to radiation [49].
