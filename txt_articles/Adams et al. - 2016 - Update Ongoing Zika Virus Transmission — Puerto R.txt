On July 29, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes 
aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and infection can 
be asymptomatic or result in an acute febrile illness with 
rash (1). Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of 
microcephaly and other severe birth defects (2). Infection has 
also been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) (3) 
and severe thrombocytopenia (4,5). In December 2015, the 
Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) reported the 
first locally acquired case of Zika virus infection. This report 
provides an update to the epidemiology of and public health 
response to ongoing Zika virus transmission in Puerto Rico 
(6,7). A confirmed case of Zika virus infection is defined as a 
positive result for Zika virus testing by reverse transcription–
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Zika virus in a blood 
or urine specimen. A presumptive case is defined as a positive 
result by Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA)* and a negative result 
by dengue virus IgM ELISA, or a positive test result by Zika 
IgM MAC-ELISA in a pregnant woman. An unspecified fla-
vivirus case is defined as positive or equivocal results for both 
Zika and dengue virus by IgM ELISA. During November 1, 
2015–July 7, 2016, a total of 23,487 persons were evaluated 
by PRDH and CDC Dengue Branch for Zika virus infection, 
including asymptomatic pregnant women and persons with 
signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease or sus-
pected GBS; 5,582 (24%) confirmed and presumptive Zika 
virus cases were identified. Persons with Zika virus infection 
were residents of 77 (99%) of Puerto Rico’s 78 municipalities. 
During 2016, the percentage of positive Zika virus infection 
cases among symptomatic males and nonpregnant females who 
were tested increased from 14% in February to 64% in June. 
Among 9,343 pregnant women tested, 672 had confirmed 
or presumptive Zika virus infection, including 441 (66%) 
symptomatic women and 231 (34%) asymptomatic women. 
One patient died after developing severe thrombocytopenia 
(4). Evidence of Zika virus infection or recent unspecified 
flavivirus infection was detected in 21 patients with confirmed 
GBS. The widespread outbreak and accelerating increase in 
the number of cases in Puerto Rico warrants intensified vec-
tor control and personal protective behaviors to prevent new 
infections, particularly among pregnant women.
Epidemiologic Surveillance
Epidemiologic surveillance for Zika virus in Puerto Rico has 
previously been described, and includes testing of all symp-
tomatic persons for evidence of Zika, dengue, or chikungunya 
virus infection using the Trioplex RT-PCR† or MAC-ELISA 
tests (7). During November 1, 2015–July 7, 2016, specimens 
from 16,522 symptomatic patients with suspected arboviral 
disease were evaluated. A total of 5,106 (31%) confirmed and 
245 (1%) presumptive Zika virus infections were identified. 
In addition, test results for 136 (<1%) patients were positive 
for recent dengue virus infection, results for 127 (<1%) were 
positive for recent unspecified flavivirus infection, and results 
for 100 (<1%) were positive for recent chikungunya virus infec-
tion. Among the 5,351 symptomatic patients with evidence of 
recent Zika virus infection, 441 (8%) were pregnant women 
(Table 1). Thirty-six confirmed or suspected cases of GBS (8) 
were reported to PRDH by providers throughout the island. 
Among these patients, 21 (61%) had evidence of Zika virus 
or flavivirus infection, including five (14%) with confirmed 
and 11 (33%) with presumptive Zika virus infections, and five 
(14%) with unspecified flavivirus infections. Sixty-five (<1%) 
of 5,131 symptomatic patients with confirmed or presump-
tive Zika virus infection required hospitalization, including 
all GBS patients. One male patient with Zika virus infection 
died of complications related to severe thrombocytopenia (4). 
Sixty-five infants were born to women with evidence of Zika 
virus infection in pregnancy, and two pregnancy losses were 
identified. In one pregnancy loss, Zika virus was identified in 
neural tissue by immunohistochemistry. No cases of congenital 
Zika virus infection among live births in Puerto Rico have been

identified. All pregnant women with confirmed or presumptive 
Zika virus infection, or unspecified flavivirus infection, and 
their prenatally exposed offspring are being actively monitored 
for adverse maternal, fetal, neonatal, infant, and child health 
outcomes through the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance 
System,§ a collaboration between PRDH and CDC. PRDH 
has followed CDC recommendations that pregnant women 
in areas with evidence of active Zika virus transmission receive 
screening tests during the first and second trimesters of preg-
nancy, regardless of symptoms (9). Among 7,308 asymptomatic 
pregnant women tested during January–July 2016, 43 (<1%) 
confirmed and 188 (3%) presumptive Zika virus infections 
were identified. The percentage of asymptomatic pregnant 
women with confirmed or presumptive recent Zika virus 
infection among women tested increased almost sixfold, from 
0.8% in February 2016 to 5.3% in June 2016.
The number of Zika virus infections reported each week 
in Puerto Rico gradually increased during November 2015–
February 2016, and remained relatively stable until April 2016 
(Figure 1). The number of persons with recent Zika virus 
infection reported each week began to increase in April 2016, 
and steadily increased through June. Overall, Puerto Rico 
reported 291 new confirmed and presumptive Zika virus cases 
during February 2016; 2,612 new confirmed and presumptive 
Zika virus cases were reported during June, a nearly eightfold 
increase. Among symptomatic males and nonpregnant females 
who were tested, the percentage of persons with confirmed 
or presumptive Zika virus infection increased threefold from 
14% in February to 64% in June; during the same time, the 
percentage of persons with confirmed or presumptive Zika 
virus infection among symptomatic pregnant women increased 
fivefold, from 8% to 41%.
Suspected cases of Zika virus disease were reported in all 
78 municipalities, and Zika virus–infected patients were 
residents of 77 (99%) municipalities (Figure 2). The more 
populous municipalities of San Juan and Ponce reported the 
highest numbers of confirmed and presumptive Zika virus 
cases, with fewer cases occurring in the rural municipalities 
of Puerto Rico.
On April 3, 2016, local collection of blood donation 
specimens resumed (the Food and Drug Administration 
had recommended cessation of blood collection in areas of 
the United States affected by active vectorborne transmis-
sion of Zika virus and importation of all blood components 
from the continental United States beginning March 5¶). 
Zika virus screening using a nucleic acid test (cobas Zika, 
Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Pleasanton, California) was 
authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an 
investigational new drug application (10). A blood dona-
tion specimen with an initial reactive result by nucleic acid 
testing is regarded as presumptive positive for Zika virus 
infection. During the weeks of April 3 through July 3, 
among 18,163 donation specimens tested, 143 (0.8%) 
were identified as presumptive positive for Zika virus. The 
percentage of blood donation specimens testing positive 
by week has increased, with the highest percentage (1.8%) 
occurring during the latest week of reporting (week begin-
ning July 3) (Figure 3).
Public Health Response
PRDH, in collaboration with CDC, implemented a Zika 
virus response strategy with three focus areas: protecting preg-
nant women, controlling the mosquito vector, and expanding 
access to the full range of voluntary contraceptive options for 
women and men. Health messaging, such as television and 
radio public service announcements, has been implemented, 
health education materials have been distributed at locations, 
including health care facilities and community events, and 
weekly arboviral surveillance reports with island-wide and 
municipal-level information have been posted online.**,†† 
Outreach to travelers has included health messaging via tele-
vision screens and flyers at ports of entry, hotels, and tourist 
places of interest as well as training airport and tourism person-
nel. Community intervention strategies have focused on preg-
nant women. PRDH has worked closely with Women, Infants, 
and Children (WIC) clinics, where 90% of pregnant women 
residing in Puerto Rico received services in 2015 (Dana Miró 
Medina, LND, WIC Puerto Rico, personal communication, 
2016), to provide approximately 12,900 Zika prevention kits 
to pregnant women; the kits include insect repellent, bed nets, 
condoms, and larvicide to prevent mosquito breeding sites in 
water-holding containers around households. Since February 
2016, approximately 21,000 pregnant women, representing

approximately 67% of the estimated number of pregnant 
women per year based on 2015 birth rates, have been counseled 
about Zika virus prevention at WIC clinics. In addition, to 
reduce the risk for unintended pregnancies, the public health 
response includes community outreach and education about 
sexual transmission of Zika virus, distribution of male and 
female condoms, and an increase in the availability of the full 
range of voluntary contraceptive methods, including long-
acting reversible contraceptives (11). PRDH and CDC have 
also implemented a representative, population-based survey of 
women aged 18–49 years to assess contraception use through 
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
Pregnant women across the island identified through WIC 
are offered vector control services carried out by a contracted 
pest control company; these services include source reduction 
of mosquito breeding sites, larvicide application, and residual 
indoor and outdoor insecticide spraying with deltamethrin. 
The Puerto Rico Public Housing Administration has led pro-
grams to incorporate residual insecticide spraying with delta-
methrin and, in collaboration with Puerto Rico Department 
of Family Affairs, is working to install screens in the homes of 
pregnant women.
During February–March 2016, a CDC laboratory in Puerto 
Rico conducted an insecticide resistance study of Ae. aegypti 
mosquitoes to guide vector control strategies. Mosquitoes from 
across Puerto Rico were tested using the CDC bottle bioassay 
(12). Results from the laboratory study indicated widespread 
resistance to pyrethroids throughout the island with the excep-
tion of partial resistance to deltamethrin and full susceptibility 
to naled, an organophosphate insecticide. Insecticide resistance 
surveillance is ongoing in the CDC laboratory. Use of lethal 
adult mosquito traps, which have previously been associated 
with reduced Ae. aegypti numbers and incidence of arboviral 
infections in Puerto Rico, is also under consideration (13,14).
PRDH and CDC have collaborated to ensure that all public 
schools are sprayed with deltamethrin before the school year 
starts in early August. Furthermore, PRDH and the Puerto 
Rico Emergency Management Agency have collaborated with 
municipalities to initiate community cleanup campaigns using 
larvicide to prevent mosquito breeding in water-holding contain-
ers around households and to remove mosquito breeding sites, 
such as trash heaps and septic tanks. In addition, the Puerto 
Rico Emergency Management Agency and the Puerto Rico 
Environmental Quality Board have removed approximately 
1.6 million rubber tires that could act as mosquito breeding sites.
Women with evidence of Zika virus infection during preg-
nancy and their exposed offspring are monitored for adverse 
maternal, fetal, neonatal, infant, and child health outcomes 
through the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System. Puerto 
Rico’s Birth Defects Surveillance and Prevention System, in 
collaboration with maternal fetal medicine specialists, monitors 
the ultrasound findings of pregnant women infected with Zika 
virus. Beginning in January 2016, the Birth Defects Surveillance 
and Prevention System began identifying newborns with con-
genital microcephaly, including those born to women infected 
with Zika virus during pregnancy. All newborns of women with 
evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy are referred 
to the Children with Special Health Care Needs program for 
developmental surveillance and coordinated specialized services, 
for up to age 3 years as needed. All newborns with congenital 
microcephaly will be referred to Avanzando Juntos, Puerto Rico’s 
early intervention services system.
Discussion
Both the number of Zika virus infections and percentage of 
tests among symptomatic persons and asymptomatic pregnant 
women that are positive are rapidly increasing in Puerto Rico. 
In addition, unspecified flavivirus cases, while indistinguishable 
by available laboratory tests, are likely attributable to Zika virus 
infection, as Zika virus is the predominant circulating flavivirus; 
Zika virus was identified in 5,351 suspected arboviral cases, com-
pared with 136 dengue cases. Many persons with symptomatic 
Zika virus infection do not seek medical care or are not reported 
to public health officials, and most persons with Zika virus infec-
tion are asymptomatic (15), but can still infect mosquitoes and 
might unknowingly transmit the virus through sexual contact 
(16), blood donation (10), or vertically, to the fetus (17). The 
prevalence of Zika virus infection in Puerto Rico is substantial 
and increasing, with the most recent data indicating that 5% of 
asymptomatic pregnant women and 1.8% of blood donations

have evidence of recent infection in the most recent reported 
week of screening (week beginning July 3) (10).
Since the introduction of Zika virus to Puerto Rico in late 
2015, the virus has spread to nearly all municipalities. The pat-
tern of spread in Puerto Rico is consistent with that of newly 
introduced arboviruses into an immunologically naive popula-
tion: transmission began in the heavily populated eastern region 
and subsequently spread to the southern and western parts of 
the island, with lower infection rates in the central mountainous 
regions (18,19). Arboviral outbreaks in Puerto Rico tend to peak 
in the late summer and fall, coincident with hotter months with 
higher rainfall, raising concern that the outbreak will continue and 
the incidence will increase during the coming months (18,19).
Patterns observed after the introduction of other arboviruses 
into Puerto Rico, and evidence that the Zika virus outbreak 
exhibits no signs of abating, underscore the critical need for rapid, 
intensified measures to prevent infections among pregnant women. 
Surveillance data indicate that during June 2016, despite current 
interventions, approximately 322 pregnant women received diag-
noses of having been newly infected in Puerto Rico, emphasizing 
the need for an aggressive, integrated vector management strategy 
coupled with intensive counseling and care for pregnant women.
Measures to strengthen vector control in Puerto Rico include 
more intensive source reduction and larvicide application 
activities, community engagement, use of lethal adult mos-
quito traps, and consideration of strategies for vector control 
with insecticides to which local populations of Ae. aegypti are 
susceptible. A preliminary CDC evaluation of residual insecti-
cide spraying indicates that adult mosquito populations in and 
around sprayed homes remained comparable to counts in and 
around unsprayed homes, probably as a result of movement of 
mosquitoes from nearby homes with breeding sources.
Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should continue 
to employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, including using 
mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, 
and ensuring that windows and doors have screens, and air 
conditioning is used, to avoid bites while indoors.§§ To reduce 
the risk for sexual transmission, especially to pregnant women, 
precautions should include consistent and correct use of con-
doms or abstinence (20).Women in Puerto Rico who do not 
desire pregnancy need access to effective and affordable vol-
untary contraception to avoid unintended pregnancies (11).¶¶ 
Clinicians who suspect Zika virus disease in patients who reside 
in or have recently returned from areas such as Puerto Rico 
with ongoing Zika virus transmission should consider testing 
for Zika virus and report cases to public health officials.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Zika virus transmission in Puerto Rico has been increasing since 
it was first detected in November 2015. Zika virus infection is a 
cause of microcephaly and other severe birth defects and has 
been associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome and severe 
thrombocytopenia.
What is added by this report?
During November 1, 2015–July 7, 2016, specimens from 
16,522 patients with suspected Zika virus disease in Puerto Rico 
were evaluated and 5,351 (32%) had laboratory evidence of 
current or recent Zika virus infection. The percentage of persons 
with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus infection among 
symptomatic pregnant females increased from 8% in February 
2016 to 41% in June 2016; during the same time, the percent-
age of persons with confirmed or presumptive Zika virus 
infection among symptomatic males and nonpregnant females 
increased from 14% to 64%. The public health response 
includes increased surveillance for Zika virus infection, prevent-
ing infection in pregnant women, monitoring infected pregnant 
women and their fetuses for adverse outcomes, controlling 
mosquitoes, assuring the safety of blood products, and 
expanding access to the full range of voluntary contraceptive 
options for women and men.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The Zika virus outbreak in Puerto Rico continues to expand in 
geographic extent and number of infected persons. Residents of 
and travelers to Puerto Rico should continue to employ mosquito 
bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for 
sexual transmission, and seek medical care for any acute illness 
with rash or fever. Intensified vector control measures, including 
an integrated vector management strategy, are needed to help 
reduce disease spread. Clinicians who suspect Zika virus disease 
in patients who reside in or have recently returned from areas 
with ongoing Zika virus transmission should consider testing for 
Zika virus and report cases to public health officials.
