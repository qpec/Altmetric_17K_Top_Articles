Abstract
Background—Though public bathroom drug injection has been documented from the 
perspective of people who inject drugs, no research has explored the experiences of the business 
managers who oversee their business bathrooms and respond to drug use. These managers, by 
default, are first-responders in the event of a drug overdose and thus of intrinsic interest during the 
current epidemic of opioid-related overdoses in the United States. This exploratory study assists in 
elucidating the experiences that New York City business managers have with people who inject 
drugs, their paraphernalia, and their overdoses.
Methods—A survey instrument was designed to collect data on manager encounters with drug 
use occurring in their business bathrooms. Recruitment was guided by convenience and purposive 
approaches.
Results—More than half of managers interviewed (58%, n = 50/86) encountered drug use in 
their business bathrooms, more than a third (34%) of these managers also found syringes, and the 
vast majority (90%) of managers had received no overdose recognition or naloxone training. Seven 
managers encountered unresponsive individuals who required emergency assistance.
Conclusion—The results from this study underscore the need for additional research on the 
experiences that community stakeholders have with public injection as well as educational 
outreach efforts among business managers. This research also suggests that there is need for a 
national dialogue about potential interventions, including expanded overdose recognition and

Introduction
Drug overdose death rates per year in the United States (US) more than doubled between 
1999 and 2013, from 6.0 to 13.8 per 100,000 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
2015). Though the non-medical use of prescription opioid (NMUPO) use has remained 
relatively constant from 2007–2012, past year heroin use nearly doubled (373,000–669,000 
users) in the US in 2012 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA, 2013). Recent studies have shown that the majority of current heroin injectors in 
the US were previously NMUPO and then transitioned to heroin and injection (Cicero, Ellis, 
Surratt, & Kurtz, 2014; Jones, 2013; Mars, Bourgois, Karandinos, Montero, & Ciccarone, 
2014; Mateu-Gelabert, Guarino, Jessell, & Teper, 2015; Novak, Bluthenthal, Wenger, Chu, 
& Kral, 2015).
After a brief decline in the late-2000s, drug overdose deaths increased to 800 in New York 
City (NYC) in 2014, amounting to a 43% increase between 2010 and 2014 (New York City 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2015b). Nearly all (97%) of these overdose 
deaths in NYC involved more than one substance with 79% involving an opioid with heroin 
being the most predominant (New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 
2015b). Previous reports suggest that heroin, cocaine, and combinations thereof (known as 
‘speedballs’) are overwhelmingly the most commonly injected drugs in NYC (New York 
City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2010, 2013). Additionally, high rates of 
hepatitis C have been detected in individuals under 30 years old in NYC with the most 
common risk factor being heroin injection (Prussing, Bornschlegel, & Balter, 2015).
Public injection has been associated with a variety of health risks and risk behaviours such 
as syringe sharing, overdose, HIV/HCV/HBV transmission, abscesses, endocarditis, rushed 
injection and incarceration (Kerr, Fairbairn et al., 2007; Kinner et al., 2012; Koester, Glanz, 
& Barón, 2005; Leung et al., 2013; Milloy et al., 2008; Otiashvili, Latypov, Kirtadze, 
Ibragimov, & Zule, 2016; Rhodes et al., 2006; Schoenbaum et al., 1989; Topp et al., 2008; 
Weeks et al., 2001). And while there are a growing number of syringe exchange programs 
(SEP) across the US that provide people who inject drugs (PWID) with sterile injecting 
equipment, they are not authorized to offer a safe and sanitary space for injection. This can 
be hazardous for PWID who lack a private location where they can inject and for those 
attempting to conceal their use from others. As a result, these individuals must navigate 
complex public risk environments riddled with physical, social, economic, and legal harms, 
when selecting a location to inject (Dovey, Fitzgerald, & Choi, 2001; Parkin, 2013; Rhodes, 
2002; Rhodes et al., 2006).

 The ‘continuum of descending safety’ was developed to assist in conceptualizing these risks 
in public injection locations by assessing the degree to which environmental features 
promote safer injecting techniques and practices (Parkin, 2013, 2014). Public bathrooms1 
have been categorized as ‘controlled’ public injecting locations due to the fact that they are 
cleaned regularly, provide running water for drug preparation and hand washing, adequate 
lighting, flat surfaces, have locking doors for privacy, and are frequented regularly by staff 
and customers who can contact emergency services (and/or law enforcement) in the event of 
an overdose (Dovey et al., 2001; Parkin, 2013). Alternatively, ‘semi-controlled’ and 
‘uncontrolled’ public injection locations such as public parks, alleyways, stairwells, etc. lack 
many of the ‘controlled’ location’s amenities such as regular cleaning, running water, and 
privacy and are typically more concealed making it difficult for emergency services to locate 
an individual in the event of an overdose (Dovey et al., 2001; Parkin, 2013; Small, Rhodes, 
Wood, & Kerr, 2007).
Reports suggest that public bathrooms are among the most commonly used public injecting 
locations reported by PWID in NYC (Injection Drug Users Health Alliance, 2015; New 
York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2010, 2013). Some of the motivating 
factors for the use of this location is privacy and immediacy (Crabtree et al., 2013; Parkin, 
2013; Parkin & Coomber, 2010). Many of these businesses, particularly fast food, are 
regularly understaffed making bathroom management difficult (Hart Research Associates, 
2015). The privacy afforded by public bathrooms reduces encounters with non-injectors, 
some of whom may perpetuate stigma or shame PWID, behaviours which have been 
associated with increased injection-related risk behaviours (Crabtree et al., 2013; Latkin et 
al., 2010; McKnight et al., 2007; Rhodes et al., 2006; Rhodes et al., 2007; Rivera, DeCuir, 
Crawford, Amesty, & Lewis, 2014; Strathdee et al., 2012). Additionally, privacy can 
minimize physical harms by providing PWID with adequate time for drug preparation and 
injection which can reduce the risk of, for example, abscesses and vein damage associated 
with rushed or interrupted injections (Bourgois, 1998; Cooper, Moore, Gruskin, & Krieger, 
2005; DeBeck et al., 2009; Gibson et al., 2011; Marshall, Kerr, Qi, Montaner, & Wood, 
2010; Parkin & Coomber, 2011b; Salmon et al., 2009; Small et al., 2007). Public bathrooms 
may not be optimal locations for drug preparation and injection, but they are abundant and 
surpass other public locations (alleyways, parks, etc.), especially in large urban centres such 
as NYC, in terms of privacy, cleanliness, and accessibility, making them far better options 
for PWID when they are experiencing withdrawal (‘dope sickness’) and lack access to a 
suitable private location (Crabtree et al., 2013; Injection Drug Users Health Alliance, 2015; 
Parkin, 2013).
The Injection Drug Users Health Alliance (IDUHA) recruited and surveyed 440 active 
injectors from SEPs in NYC and assessed the frequency of and risks associated with public 
injection (Injection Drug Users Health Alliance, 2015). Of the participants, 60% reported 
injecting in locations such as public bathrooms, abandoned buildings, shooting galleries and 
vehicles within the past three months (Injection Drug Users Health Alliance, 2015). 
1The term ‘public bathroom’ is used to define a room that contains a toilet, access to a sink, is available for public use, and managed 
by either a local government or by the business in which it is located. The term is synonymous with ‘public toilet’, ‘public restroom’, 
‘public washroom’, and ‘public water closet’.

 Individuals injecting in these locations were twice as likely to report overdosing in the past 
year and those experiencing street-homelessness were 9.2 times more likely to inject in 
public locations and 8.2 times more likely to inject in a public bathroom (Injection Drug 
Users Health Alliance, 2015). The findings about risks to PWID from this report are 
supported by studies that have explored public injection in other localities (DeBeck et al., 
2009; Hunt, Lloyd, Kimber, & Tompkins, 2007; Linton, Celentano, Kirk, & Mehta, 2013).
New York City has a wide variety of public bathrooms that all contain at least one toilet and 
access to a sink. These bathrooms are managed either by local government or private 
businesses and are available for public use, though access to public bathrooms located in 
private businesses (referred to as ‘business bathrooms’) may be restricted to paying 
customers. Whether or not a business must provide bathrooms for customers varies 
according to the nature of the business. The New York Department of Health and Mental 
Hygiene requires that food service establishments with a seating capacity of 20 or more 
customers must provide access to a bathroom, though some smaller businesses do as well 
(New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2015a).
This study focused exclusively on business bathrooms and the experiences of the managers 
overseeing them. This analysis does not to include park, library, or transit hub bathrooms 
managed by the local government in order not to conflate or overgeneralise practices that 
might vary between publicly and privately operated bathrooms, although these venues 
remain important topics for future research. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has 
attempted to quantify business manager encounters with drug use, paraphernalia, and 
overdose occurring within business bathrooms.
Methods
Survey design, pilot sampling, and refinement
The survey instrument was drafted by the first author and revised according to feedback 
received from co-authors, SEP staff, PWID, and business managers. Study protocols and the 
complete survey instrument were submitted to the National Development and Research 
Institutes, Inc. Institutional Review Board and granted exempt status on the grounds that 
personally identifying information was not being collected.
The survey was piloted with 3 managers in order to refine questions, address new questions, 
and then piloted with 3 more managers to ensure clarity. Through this iterative process, it 
became clear that there was a key misconception among managers about the definition of 
‘overdose’. Some managers elaborated on their definition and many classified someone who 
was visibly intoxicated but still responsive as having overdosed. The survey was then revised 
and the authors decided to replace the term ‘overdose’ with, ‘unresponsive,’ because it both 
accurately defines an overdose and is the term used for training non-medical personnel in 
opioid overdose reversal techniques (Harm Reduction Coalition, 2012). This term was then 
incorporated in the following question, “Have you ever called 911 because someone was 
unresponsive in the bathroom?”2 That question was followed by, “Do you believe it was 
2911 is the number used to contact emergency medical services and law enforcement in the United States.

 drug related?” in order to ensure that the person was not experiencing another complication 
(i.e. diabetic coma).
Sampling
The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reports overdose deaths 
according to United Hospital Fund (UHF) defined neighbourhoods (New York City 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2006). Survey data were collected in all five-
boroughs of NYC (N = 86) from 30 unique UHF-defined neighbour-hoods (New York City 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2006). Overdose death rates range from 4.2 to 
28.3 per 100,000 and were categorized from highest to lowest (Table 2) (New York City 
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2015b). For this study, Tier I includes 
neighbourhoods experiencing the highest rates of overdose mortality (18.5–28.3 per 
100,000), Tier II includes neighbourhoods experiencing overdose mortality rates of 12.5–
18.4 per 100,000, Tier III experience 8.2–12.4 per 100,000, Tier IV experience 5.1–8.1 per 
100,000 and Tier V experience 4.2–5.0 per 100,000. A combination of convenience and 
purposive sampling (Suen, Huang, & Lee, 2014) were used to ensure that data were obtained 
from all five boroughs and from a variety of neighbour-hoods. Analysis of the 
socioeconomic characteristics of the Tiers was conducted after data collection was 
completed. The percentage of residents living in poverty, as identified by zip code, was 
averaged to calculate the level of poverty in each Tier. Thirty-nine percent of residents in 
Tier I neighbourhoods were living in poverty, which consisted of neighbourhoods with some 
of the highest levels in NYC (United States Census Bureau, 2016). Twenty-four percent of 
Tier II residents lived in poverty, 23% of Tier III residents, 13% of Tier IV, and 17% of Tier 
V (United States Census Bureau, 2016).
Data were collected by social science undergraduates from John Jay College of Criminal 
Justice who were recruited and trained as student research assistants. All student research 
assistants completed the Responsible Conduct of Research and Protections of Human 
Subjects CITI Trainings and received 4 h of further training that focused on the specific 
requirements and procedures of the study prior to data collection. Students were then 
instructed to conduct convenience sampling within the five boroughs of NYC in 
neighbourhoods that they frequented in order to obtain a semi-randomized sample. Data 
were collected only from fast-food restaurants, coffee shops, laundromats, sit-down 
restaurants (without a bar), bodegas, food markets, clothing stores and shopping malls that 
provided a bathroom for customers. After reviewing survey locations one month into the 
study, authors identified geographic areas that lacked representation (i.e. Lower Manhattan, 
East Bronx) and asked students to explore these areas and conduct further data collection.
A total of eighty-six business managers3 participated in this study. Thirty-four of these 
businesses were located in Manhattan, 20 in Queens, 16 in The Bronx, 14 in Brooklyn, and 3 
in Staten Island. All data reported in the findings below (n = 50) were collected from 
managers that had encountered drug use in their business bathroom within the previous 6 
months. Surveys were not conducted if the business did not have a bathroom. If the manager

 had not encountered drug use in their business bathroom within the past six months (n = 36), 
the survey was immediately ended after collecting only locator and business specific data 
(zip code, cross streets, the shift worked by the manager, the nature of the bathroom (i.e. 
single- or multi-stalled)).
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey post-hoc tests (Lowry, 2015; Tukey, 
1949) were computed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc 
tests were used to assess statistically significant differences in manager responses between 
Tiers.
Measurement
After collecting information about each business and its bathroom, project staff asked 
managers questions about their encounters, and those reported to them by their staff, with 
people using drugs in the bathroom, paraphernalia, and overdoses over the past six months 
only. A drug use ‘encounter’ for this study was broadly defined as an interaction with 
someone while in the bathroom or either seeing, smelling, or hearing the consumption of 
drugs occurring within the bathroom. The term also encompassed managers who had opened 
bathroom doors due to an individual being unresponsive or had confronted individuals 
exiting the bathroom whom they felt to be noticeably intoxicated.
Managers were also asked how many times they called 911 when they encountered drug use 
and whether they requested law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), or both. 
They were also asked how many times they called 911 due to an encounter with an 
unresponsive person. If they had an encounter with an unresponsive person, they were asked 
whether they alerted their superior/corporate office about the event and the response they 
received.
Additionally, project staff collected data on the type of paraphernalia managers found in the 
business bathrooms and whether it contained blood. Managers were also asked whether they 
received any customer complaints about drug use occurring in their business bathroom. 
Finally, managers were asked if they and their staff were trained in how to recognize a drug 
overdose and how to reverse an opioid overdose with naloxone. They were then asked 
whether they thought overdose recognition and naloxone training would be useful for them 
and their staff (see: Appendix A in Supplementary material for the complete survey 
instrument).
Results
Business characteristics
A total of 86 managers participated in the study. Of these managers, 58% (n = 50) reported 
that they had encountered people using drugs in their business bathroom in the past six 
months (Table 1). Encounters were reported in 25 of the 30 UHF neighbourhoods (83%) 
surveyed. The average number of monthly encounters experienced by managers ranged from 
1 to 300 (σ =119 ) with a median of 3 encounters per month.

 Drug use encounters were reported by 66% of fast-food managers (n = 25/38), 33% of 
coffee shops (n = 2/6), 43% of food markets (n = 3/7), 60% of clothing stores (n = 3/5), 67% 
of restaurants (n = 12/18), 50% of bodegas (n = 2/4), 43% of laundromats (n = 3/7), and no 
encounters were reported at the shopping mall (n = 0/1). Tier I encounters occurred 
primarily at fast-food (73%) as well as at food markets (18%) and a laundromat (9%) (Table 
2). Tier II managers had a total of three encounters, one at a fast-food, one at a clothing 
store, and one at a restaurant (Table 2). Most of Tier III encounters occurred at fast-food 
(39%) and restaurants (30%) followed by coffee shops (9%), clothing stores (9%), 
laundromats (9%), and a bodega (4%) (Table 2). Tier IV encounters occurred primarily at 
fast-food (60%) as well as at restaurants (20%), a bodega (10%), and a food market (10%) 
(Table 2). Tier V encounters occurred at two restaurants (67%) and one fast-food (33%) 
(Table 2).
Bathroom characteristics
The vast majority (81%) of businesses that encountered drug use had single-stall bathrooms. 
A total of nine businesses had multi-stall bathrooms; one fast-food and one laundromat in 
Tier I, a clothing store in Tier II, one fast-food and one restaurant in Tier III, one fast-food 
and one restaurant in Tier IV, and one restaurant in Tier V. Managers with single-stall 
bathrooms reported a median of 3 encounters (x = 22) compared to a median of 1 encounter 
(x = 2) for multi-stall bathrooms.
Encounters and paraphernalia
Seventy-three percent of managers interviewed in Tier I neighbourhoods encountered drug 
use in their bathrooms as did 75% of Tier II, 61% of Tier III, 43% of Tier IV, and 50% of 
Tier V (Table 2).
Nearly all managers (94%) who encountered drug use found drug paraphernalia in their 
business bathroom and over one-third (34%) of them found syringes (Table 1). All Tier I 
managers found paraphernalia and 82% found syringes (Table 3). Two out of three Tier II 
managers found paraphernalia but only one found syringes. However, 91% of Tier III 
managers found paraphernalia and 30% found syringes. Tier IV and V managers did not find 
any syringes but 90% and 100% found drug paraphernalia, respectively (Table 3). There was 
a statistically significant difference between Tiers as determined by one-way ANOVA (p < 
0.05). A Tukey post-hoc test revealed that Tier III (p = 0.021), IV (p = 0.001), and V (p = 
0.028) businesses had significantly fewer syringe encounters compared to Tier I businesses. 
There was no statistically significant difference between Tier I and II.
Crack pipes were found by 22% of managers who encountered drug use in their business 
bathroom (Table 1). Over a quarter (26%) of Tier III managers found crack pipes as did 18% 
of Tier I, 10% of Tier IV and one manager of Tier II and one manager of Tier V as well 
(Table 3).
Requests for emergency services
Nearly a quarter of managers (24%) called 911 when they encountered people using drugs in 
their business bathroom (Table 1). Forty-five percent of Tier I managers called 911 with each

 manager making an average of 20 calls in the past six months. One Tier II manager, two Tier 
III, two Tier IV and one Tier V manager placed 911 calls, with a median of 3, in the past six 
months. Over half of these managers (55%) making 911 calls requested law enforcement 
while 45% requested both law enforcement and EMS. All of the requests for both law 
enforcement and EMS came from Tier I and II managers (Table 3).
Seven managers called 911 because they found someone unresponsive in their business 
bathroom and believed it was a result of drug use: five of these encounters occurred in Tier I, 
one in Tier II, and one in Tier III (Tables 1 and 3). No deaths were reported within the past 
six months.
Customer complaints
Forty-four percent of managers received customer complaints regarding drug use occurring 
in their business bathroom (Table 1). Eighty-two percent of Tier I managers received 
customer complaints as did one out of three Tier II managers, 43% of Tier III managers, 
20% of Tier IV managers, and Tier V managers received no complaints (Table 3).
Overdose recognition and naloxone training
Overall, only 10% of managers’ reported some type of overdose recognition and overdose 
reversal training with naloxone: three from Tier I, one from Tier II, and one from Tier III 
(Tables 1 and 3). Despite their lack of exposure to overdose prevention education, 64% 
believed that this training would be useful, including 70% of Tier I, 67% of Tier II and Tier 
III, 40% of Tier IV, and all of Tier V (Tables 1 and 3).
Discussion
Results from this study show that drug use is occurring in business bathrooms throughout 
NYC. The frequent encounters with syringes reported by managers further supports the 
assertion that business bathrooms are being used for drug injection. Managers working in 
Tier I neighbourhoods reported the most encounters occurring in the past 6 months, the 
greatest number of monthly encounters, the most encounters with syringes and the most 
encounters with unresponsive individuals suggesting that there is an unequal distribution of 
risk between Tiers. It is worth noting that two managers (one fast food and one food market) 
reported an average of 300 encounters per month, encountering approximately 10 people per 
day using drugs in their business bathroom. These businesses were located in different 
boroughs but both were located in high poverty neighbourhoods. What made these 
businesses more amenable for drug use warrants further investigation but both of these 
business bathrooms were single-stalled, which may provide more privacy and noise 
suppression compared to multi-stalled bathrooms, and both businesses required staff to 
unlock bathrooms for customers indicating that managers may be aware of the activities 
occurring in their bathroom and have been taking measures to reduce the frequency of drug 
use.
Despite the exploratory nature of the study and the use of convenience sampling, findings 
generally match up with Tiers defined by overdose mortality rates. These data suggest that 
the use of these Tiers may be useful in identify/predicting business bathroom drug use.

 The socioeconomic status of the neighbourhoods that comprise each Tier may also represent 
an important variable in understanding why encounters are more frequent in certain areas 
than others. Residents of neighbourhoods experiencing high rates of poverty generally suffer 
from higher rates of overdose mortality, owing in part, at least, to lack of social capital, 
inadequate social and economic resources and the shortage of well-paying legal jobs that has 
led some residents of these neighbourhoods to involvement with illegal drug markets 
(Bourgois, 1995; Cerdá et al., 2013; Dunlap, Johnson, Kotarba, & Fackler, 2010; Galea et 
al., 2003; Gotsens et al., 2011; Hannon & Cuddy, 2006; Marzuk et al., 1997; Ross et al., 
2000; Sullivan, 1989). People who inject drugs experience a need for privacy and 
immediacy, as previously discussed, after procuring drugs in order to quickly alleviate 
withdrawal symptoms or suppress cravings and business bathrooms in close proximity to 
drug markets may fulfil this need.
Over a third of managers found improperly disposed syringes in their business bathrooms, a 
hazard for transmitting HIV, HCV and HBV to other PWID, community members and staff 
(Blenkharn, 2008; Lawitts, 2002; Lorentz, Hill, & Samimi, 2000; World Health 
Organization, 2015) though the transmission of these viruses via accidental needle sticks is 
uncommon (Papenburg et al., 2008; Russell & Nash, 2002). Regardless, post-exposure 
medical care, blood testing, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can produce considerable 
amounts of anxiety and stress on individuals who are injured in this manner (Parkin & 
Coomber, 2009; Sohn, Kim, Kim, & Han, 2006). Food service managers are not currently 
trained in sharps disposal and needle stick injury reporting which may delay both customers 
and staff from obtaining appropriate medical care and PEP within the timeframe for it to be 
effective (New York State Restaurant Association, 2015). Therefore, the installation of 
sharps containers in business bathrooms and subsequent training may reduce the amount of 
improperly disposed sharps and further reduce the possibility of staff and community 
member needle sticks.
In Cambridge (UK), for example, stand-alone public toilets were equipped with sharps 
containers and nearly 6000 syringes were collected from 20 of these toilets in a single year, 
resulting in a noticeable reduction of improperly disposed syringes in the area (Parkin, 
2016). This suggests that sharps containers in public bathrooms can be an effective tool for 
encouraging proper syringe disposal. However, these toilets were shut down when they 
became improperly framed by the media as “health hazards” and became targets for law 
enforcement (Parkin, 2016). There is also the potential that the presence of sharps containers 
may inadvertently alert customers to injection drug use occurring within the business’s 
bathroom and further stigmatize PWID (Parkin & Coomber, 2011a). There is also a chance 
that a ‘honeypot’ effect may occur at businesses that provide sharps containers (as well as 
those that possess naloxone), meaning that some PWID may preferentially inject in 
businesses that provide this service. On the other hand, a lack of sharps containers results in 
syringes being flushed down toilets, leading to clogs and the need for repairs. Further 
research is needed in order to determine the acceptability and feasibility of installing sharps 
containers in business bathrooms.

 Business managers, particularly those in Tier I neighbourhoods, report receiving customer 
complaints about drug use occurring in the bathroom. This suggests that drug use in these 
bathrooms may have the potential to deter customers and financially harm these businesses.
It is also important to note that nearly half of managers requested both law enforcement and 
EMS, particularly Tier I managers who encountered drug use more frequently. Requests for 
EMS suggest that many of the 911 calls were not solely made because of disruptive 
behaviour but potentially out of concern for an individual’s health.
Although no deaths were reported by managers in this study, drug overdose deaths have 
occurred in public bathrooms throughout the US (Seelye, 2016). In particular, less-
frequented bathrooms without queues and those infrequently utilized or cleaned by staff may 
lead to a delayed encounter and response that could result in death.
A growing number of laypersons are being trained on how to recognize an opioid overdose 
and administer naloxone throughout the US (Wheeler, Jones, Gilbert, & Davidson, 2015). A 
previous study of laypersons trained in opioid overdose and naloxone administration 
demonstrated that such persons, when properly trained, were able to correctly recognize an 
overdose situation in which naloxone should be administered comparable to that of medical 
experts and suggests that it would be feasible to train business managers on these techniques 
(Green, Heimer, & Grau, 2008). This data supports the notion that managers should be 
capable of intervening in a medical crisis within their community provided they receive 
proper training. Unexpectedly, a majority of managers from nearly all Tiers believed that this 
training would be useful, contrary to the reluctance of public and private front-line staff in 
the UK who favoured more punitive approaches (Parkin, 2013; Parkin & Coomber, 2009). 
The data suggest that an overdose recognition and naloxone training intervention may be 
most beneficial to business managers working in Tier I neighbourhoods who are 
experiencing high rates of encounters and unresponsive individuals though managers from 
other Tiers would likely benefit as well. Future research is needed in order to determine 
whether managers will participate in overdose recognition and naloxone training when it is 
offered as well as whether managers are willing to physically tend to PWID in the event of 
an overdose.
While training managers in overdose reversal and installing sharps containers in bathrooms 
may reduce some key risks (improper sharps disposal), these interventions will not reduce 
the use of business bathrooms for injection. The results of this study, though exploratory, 
support the need for supervised injection facilities (SIF), if not drug consumption rooms 
(DCR), which would provide a hygienic and supervised environment for all types of 
problematic drug use instead of having it occur in public places. Current harm reduction 
services in the US provide sterile injection equipment and safe crack smoking kits but are 
restricted by the federal ‘Crack House’ statutes from legally providing a safe space for 
injections or drug consumption (Beletsky, Davis, Anderson, & Burris, 2008). These 
restrictions, in part, divert PWID to unsafe and unhygienic injecting locations within their 
community such as business bathrooms. Research also suggests that SIF/DCR are capable of 
successfully managing overdoses, reducing overdose deaths, reducing HIV/HCV risk 
behaviour, increase uptake of addiction treatment, reduce public injection and public

 disorder while not increasing drug injection initiation, community drug use, or drug related 
crime and being cost-effective (Andresen & Boyd, 2010; DeBeck et al., 2011; Freeman et 
al., 2005; Kerr, Kimber, DeBeck, & Wood, 2007; Kerr et al., 2006; Kerr, Tyndall, Li, 
Montaner, & Wood, 2005; Kerr, Tyndall et al., 2007; Marshall, Milloy, Wood, Montaner, & 
Kerr, 2011; Petrar et al., 2007; Salmon, Thein, Kimber, Kaldor, & Maher, 2007; Small, Van 
Borek, Fairbairn, Wood, & Kerr, 2009; Stoltz et al., 2007; Wood et al., 2004; Wood, Tyndall, 
Lai, Montaner, & Kerr, 2006; Wood, Tyndall, Zhang, Montaner, & Kerr, 2007; Wood, 
Tyndall, Zhang et al., 2006). Supervised injection facilities and drug consumption rooms 
also have the ability to reduce both public injection and improperly disposed syringe 
sightings as reported by researchers, local residents, and business managers in Vancouver, 
BC, Canada and Sydney, NSW, Australia making this intervention worthy of further 
investigation in addition to the education and training of managers in overdose recognition 
and naloxone use (Petrar et al., 2007; Salmon et al., 2007; Stoltz et al., 2007; Wood et al., 
2004).
It is important to note that SIF/DCR would not replace any of the current PWID services 
(i.e. SEP, medication-assisted therapy, addiction treatment, business manager overdose 
recognition and naloxone training, etc.), but would offer additional services that compliment 
current harm reduction and treatment programs by preventing harm to PWID and the 
community until the individual is ready for treatment.
The results from this study underscore the need for further research on this topic. Future 
research could explore the experience of local government workers who tend to public 
bathrooms (park bathrooms, library bathrooms, bus station bathrooms, subway bathrooms, 
etc.) in addition to the expansion of this study outside of urban centres to suburban and rural 
communities. Interventions could also be designed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of 
providing managers with overdose, naloxone, and safe sharps disposal training as well as the 
installation of sharps containers in business bathrooms.
Limitations
The results from this exploratory study cannot be generalized for all of NYC being that this 
study used a combination of purposive and convenience sampling and consisted of a small 
sample size. However, the goal of this study was to generate preliminary indications of 
whether managers were aware of drug use occurring in their business bathrooms. Survey 
results appear to demonstrate the memorable nature of overdose and drug use encounters 
and managers’ willingness to discuss these timely topics. That said, recall may vary 
considerably between managers with different experiences and perceptions of substance use. 
Additionally, some managers working in businesses with bathrooms refused to participate in 
the study and the number of refusals and reasons were not recorded. This study also did not 
thoroughly interview managers who did not encounter drug use even though these managers 
may find paraphernalia in their business bathroom. And although we are unable to determine 
exactly which drugs are consumed, paraphernalia is capable of providing hints about 
administration routes which are unique to particular drugs. Due to the exploratory nature of 
this study, managers were not provided an opportunity to suggest or support alternative harm 
reduction or punitive interventions they believe might be more effective at reducing drug use

 in business bathrooms, leaving questions about managers’ perceptions about their role in 
managing this risk environment. There is also the possibility that managers provided socially 
desirable answers in regards to encounters and overdose as well as overdose recognition and 
naloxone training.
Conclusion
Business bathrooms appeared to be used by some PWID for injection purposes with some 
managers reporting regular encounters as identified by this exploratory survey of business 
managers. These bathrooms are being utilized as unregulated injection facilities that lack 
adequate sharps disposal, sterile water, sanitary surfaces, and may lead to rushed or 
interrupted injecting as well as a delayed response to drug overdoses. Drug use in business 
bathrooms may deter customers, damage a business’s reputation and profitability, and create 
an unsafe environment for customers and staff. Managers are also not equipped with the 
knowledge and resources needed to properly respond to drug overdoses. The study also 
preliminarily demonstrates the use of overdose death rate Tiers as a technique for identifying 
businesses at risk for bathroom drug use which can be used to tailor strategic interventions. 
Future research should explore the feasibility and efficacy of providing managers with 
overdose recognition, naloxone, and safe sharps disposal training as well as the installation 
of sharps containers in business bathrooms. Additionally, the operation of SIF/DCR should 
be considered as a means to reduce both public injection and improperly disposed 
paraphernalia.
