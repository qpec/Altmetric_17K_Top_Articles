Abstract 
Background: The role of prediabetes as a risk factor for hyperfiltration and albuminuria in 
persons who do not develop diabetes is unclear. The lack of evidence is mainly due to the 
difficulty of accurately assessing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the near normal range 
of GFR. We investigated whether prediabetes is an independent risk factor for hyperfiltration 
and high normal urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) using measured GFR (mGFR) rather 
than estimated GFR.   
Study Design: Prospective cohort study based on the Renal Iohexol Clearance Survey in 
Tromsø 6 (RENIS-T6) and the RENIS-Follow-Up. The median observation time was 5.6 
years. 
Setting & Participants: A representative sample of 1261 persons without diabetes from the 
general population aged 50-62 years.  
Predictor: Prediabetes defined by fasting glucose and HbAR1c
R according to the levels 
suggested by the American Diabetes Association (prediabetesRADA
R) and the International 
Expert Committee of 2009 (prediabetesRIEC
R).  
Outcomes: Change in mGFR, hyperfiltration defined as mGFR > 90Pth
P percentile adjusted for 
age, gender, weight and height, and high normal ACR (ACR > 10 mg/g) at follow-up. 
Measurements: GFR was measured with iohexol clearance. 
Results: Baseline fasting glucose, HbAR1c
R, and both definitions of prediabetes were predictors 
of a higher mGFR at follow-up and of a lower annual mGFR decline in multivariable-adjusted 
regression analyses. Participants with prediabetesRIEC
R had an odds ratio (95% CI) of 
2 
 
 hyperfiltration of 1.95 (1.20-3.17) and high normal ACR of 1.83 (1.04-3.22) at follow-up. We 
adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors including ambulatory blood pressure at baseline and 
change in use of anti-hypertensive medication between baseline and follow-up. 
Limitations: Only middle-aged Caucasians participated. There is no consensus on how to 
define glomerular hyperfiltration. 
Conclusions: Our findings imply an independent role of prediabetes in development of 
hyperfiltration and albuminuria. Prediabetes might be a target for early treatment to prevent 
chronic kidney disease in chronic hyperglycemia.      
 
 
Diabetes-related kidney disease accounts for almost 50% of patients with end-stage renal 
disease in the developed world.P1
P Even with optimal treatment of new-onset diabetes, a large 
percentage of patients will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD). Prediabetes is 
approximately twice as common as diabetes, affecting 20-35% of adults, and it progresses to 
diabetes in 45-50% of individuals after 10 years.PP2,3 Prediabetes has been associated with CKD 
in cross-sectional studies,4,5 but whether prediabetes predicts CKD in persons who do not 
develop diabetes is unclear. Longitudinal studies did not find prediabetes to be an independent 
risk factor for albuminuria or incident CKD, defined as an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 
m2.6-11 If prediabetes is a causal factor in the development of kidney disease, this condition 
would represent a window of opportunity to treat kidney damage at an early and reversible 
stage.   
Recently, we reported that prediabetes, defined as impaired fasting glucose, was associated 
with an abnormally high GFR, or glomerular hyperfiltration, in a cross-sectional study of the 
3 
 
 general population.12 Glomerular hyperfiltration has been established as an early 
manifestation of diabetic nephropathy and has been shown to predict albuminuria and GFR 
decline in diabetes.13,14 Hyperfiltration is also a possible common causal pathway for other 
causes of CKD; however, the longitudinal association between prediabetes and hyperfiltration 
remains to be established. Previous longitudinal studies assessing the association between 
prediabetes and kidney function used estimated GFR (eGFR) to assess changes in GFR. eGFR 
has low precision, particularly in the higher range of GFR,15 and is expected to have low 
sensitivity for detecting hyperfiltration and GFR changes in the normal range. eGFR is also 
biased by non-GFR-related factors such as obesity, smoking, hyperglycemia and non-
traditional cardiovascular risk factors.16-18 
We hypothesized that prediabetes is a risk factor for renal hyperfiltration and high normal 
ACR during an intermediate follow-up time point. To overcome the limitations of using 
eGFR, we measured GFR (mGFR) by iohexol clearance at baseline in 2007-2009 and at 
follow-up in 2013-2015 in a general population cohort without self-reported diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) or kidney disease at baseline. To study the independent role of 
prediabetes, we excluded persons diagnosed with diabetes at baseline and at follow-up.  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Study participants  
The Renal Iohexol Clearance Survey in Tromsø 6 (RENIS-T6) was conducted from October 
2007 to September 2009 as a sub-study of the population-based sixth Tromsø study (Tromsø 
6) in the municipality of Tromsø, northern Norway.19 The RENIS-T6 included a 
representative sample of 1627 persons aged 50-62 years from the general population without 
self-reported kidney disease, myocardial infarction, stroke or diabetes. A description of the 
4 
 
 study participants and enrollment in the RENIS-T6 is shown in Figure 1 and has been 
previously published in detail.19 
The RENIS Follow-Up Study (RENIS-FU) was conducted from September 2013 to January 
2015. Seven persons had a possible adverse reaction to iohexol in the RENIS-T6, and 23 
persons died during the follow-up period. The remaining 1597 participants were invited to 
RENIS-FU, and 1368 (86%) gave a positive response, but 39 did not make their appointments 
and 5 subjects could not be examined because the antecubital vein could not be cannulated. 
Accordingly, a total of 1324 (83%) patients were examined in RENIS-FU (Figure 1). In the 
present investigation, an additional 25 persons with diabetes (fasting glucose >= 126 mg/dL 
(7.0 mmol/l) and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAR1c
R) >= 6.5%) at baseline were excluded. 
The study was approved by the Norwegian Data Inspectorate and the Regional Ethics 
Committee of Northern Norway (2012/122/REK nord). All subjects provided written 
informed consent.  
Data Collection and Measurements 
Both RENIS-T6 and RENIS-FU were conducted at the Clinical Research Unit at the 
University Hospital of Northern Norway with a standardized procedure and the same staff 
responsible for all measurements. Participants met between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. after an 
overnight fast, including abstinence from tobacco.   
Iohexol clearance 
GFR was measured at baseline and follow-up using single-sample plasma clearance of 
iohexol. Participants were instructed to avoid large meals with meat and non-steroid anti-
inflammatory drugs during the 2 days prior to the investigation. A Teflon catheter was placed 
in an antecubital vein. Five milliliters of iohexol (Omnipaque, 300 mg/ml, Amersham Health, 
5 
 
 London, U.K.) was injected, and the syringe was weighed before and after injection. The 
venous catheter was flushed with 30 ml of isotonic saline. After a calculated time period 
based on each person’s estimated GFR, the iohexol blood sample was drawn from the same 
catheter. The serum iohexol concentration was measured by high-performance liquid 
chromatography, as described by Nilsson-Ehle.20 The analytical coefficient of variation 
during the study period was 3% in RENIS-T6 and 3.1% in RENIS-FU. To explore the 
possibility of a drift in the method between baseline and follow-up we reanalyzed iohexol and 
recalculated mGFR in a random sample of 105 serum samples frozen at -80°C at baseline. 
There was a mean difference of 2.28 ml/min/1.73 m2 between the original baseline measure 
and the repeated baseline measure taken from the thawed sample. An adjustment was made by 
adding this difference to the baseline measurements. mGFR was calculated as described by 
Jacobsson.21 Details regarding the iohexol clearance measurements are published elsewhere.19 
Other measurements including albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) 
Serum creatinine analyses were performed using a standardized enzymatic assay, and cystatin 
C was measured by particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay as previously described.18 
GFR was estimated from creatinine or cystatin C using the Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI).15 
Three samples of first-void morning spot urine were collected on separate days at baseline 
and at follow-up. Urinary albumin excretion and urinary creatinine were measured with 
commercial kits as described previously.22 The albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in mg/mmol 
was calculated for each urine-specimen, and the mean ACR value was used in the analyses. 
High normal ACR was defined as ACR > 10 mg/g (>1.13 mg/mmol) as suggested by the 
CKD Prognosis Consortium because this level has been associated with increased risks of 
CVD, CKD and mortality.23,24 
6 
 
 HbAR1c
R was measured using liquid chromatography (Variant II instrument, Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), and fasting serum glucose was measured on the Modular 
model P800 (Roche Diagnostics). The insulin samples were measured with an ELISA kit 
(DRG Instruments, Marburg, Germany) as previously reported.12 
Ambulatory blood pressure (aBP) recordings were started after the baseline iohexol clearance 
measurement (RENIS-T6) and continued for 24 hours; the method is described in a previous 
publication.25 
Definition of prediabetes and hyperfiltration 
We defined prediabetes according to fasting glucose (FG) and HbAR1c
R to capture both fasting 
hyperglycemia and part of non-fasting hyperglycemia, both of which may represent distinct 
pathophysiological abnormalities.2 Prediabetes was defined as FG 110-125 mg/dL (6.1-6.9 
mmol/l) and/or HbAR1c
R 6.0-6.4% according to the classification of “high risk state of 
developing diabetes” by the International Expert Committee of 2009 (prediabetesRIEC
R) or as FG 
100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/l) and/or HbAR1c
R 5.7-6.4% according to the American Diabetes 
Association criteria (prediabetesRADA
R).26,27 In addition we made a separate group for those with 
prediabetesRADA
R and not prediabetesRIEC
R (prediabetesR ADAnotIEC; 
RFG 100-109 mg/dL (5.6-6.0 
mmol/l) and/or HbAR1c
R 5.7-5.9%). Diabetes was defined as FG ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/l) or 
HbAR1C 
R≥ 6.5% or the use of anti-diabetic medication or self-reported diabetes. 
Normoglycemia was defined as FG < 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/l) and HbAR1C
R < 5.7%.  
Glomerular hyperfiltration was defined as an absolute GFR above the 90th percentile after 
adjusting for gender, age, weight and height, as previously described.12

 Information regarding health status, medications, smoking status and physical exercise were 
obtained using a questionnaire. Smoking status was divided into current smokers and non-
smokers. Physically active participants were defined as those performing hard physical 
exercise for > 1 h/wk and/or light physical exercise for > 3 h/wk.16 Obesity was defined as 
body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2. 
Statistical analysis 
Mean (SD) or median (IQR) values (for skewed distributions) were calculated for participants 
by glycemic groups at baseline. Linear trends across the three groups; normoglycemia, 
prediabetesRADAnotIEC
R and prediabetesRIEC
R were tested by ANOVA for mean values, quantile 
regression for median values and logistic regression for dichotomous variables.  
The associations between baseline fasting glucose (FG), HbAR1c
R, prediabetes and mGFR 
expressed in ml/min/1.73 m2 and as ml/min at follow-up were assessed by multiple linear 
regression analysis. We adjusted for the following known or possible confounders: in model 
1, we adjusted for age, gender and baseline use angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB); in model 2, we also adjusted for BMI, 
smoking, daytime systolic aBP, fasting insulin levels, physical exercise and ACR; and in 
model 3, we adjusted for all of the preceding covariates, as well as baseline mGFR and 
change in use of antihypertensive medication and change in FG from baseline to follow-up.  
Predictors of annual change in absolute mGFR (ΔGFRa in ml/min/year) were analyzed with 
ΔGFRa as the dependent variable and using the same independent and adjusting variables as 
described above, including an adjustment for baseline mGFR in all of the models. In these 
analyses, we also adjusted for a change in body weight because body weight is correlated with 
8 
 
 absolute GFR (model 3). ΔGFRa was calculated by subtracting mGFR (ml/min) at baseline 
from mGFR (ml/min) at follow-up and dividing the difference by follow-up time in years.  
To investigate a possible non-linear association between FG or HbAR1c
R and ΔGFRa or mGFR 
at follow-up, we used multiple fractional polynomial regression analyses, adjusting for the 
same variables as in model 3 of the linear regression analyses.  
 
Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine the odds ratios for hyperfiltration,  
mGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or ACR > 10 mg/g (>1.1 mg/mmol) at follow-up associated with 
baseline FG, HbAR1c
R and prediabetes status, adjusted for the same variables described in the 3 
models above. (In model 3 with ACR > 10 mg/g at follow-up as dependent variable we 
adjusted for baseline ACR instead of baseline mGFR). We tested for interactions between all 
independent variables and gender in all of the linear and logistic regression models.  
Stata software version 13 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas, USA) was used for statistical 
analysis. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.  
 
RESULTS 
Thirty-eight individuals had diabetes at follow-up (RENIS-FU); these persons were excluded. 
Accordingly, 1261 non-diabetic persons with a GFR measurement at baseline and at follow-
up remained for analyses (Figure 1). The median (interquartile range) observation time was 
5.6 years (5.2-6.0). 
Comparisons of the baseline characteristic of those included in the follow-up study (N=1299) 
and those lost to follow-up (N=295) are shown in Supplemental Table 1. Except for the 
percentage of current smokers (18 vs. 28, p<0.001), the differences were small.

 A total of 595 participants had prediabetesRADA
R (FG 5.6-6.9 mmol/l and/or HbAR1c
R 5.7-6.4%), 
and 169 participants had prediabetesRIEC
R (FG 6.1-6.9 mmol/l and/or HbAR1c
R 6.0-6.4%) at 
baseline. Baseline characteristics of the participants by glycemic status and in total are shown 
in Table 1. Age, night-time systolic aBP, BMI, insulin levels and triglyceride levels increased 
across the prediabetic groups while HDL-cholesterol levels, the proportion of females and the 
proportion performing physical exercise decreased across the groups. Baseline mGFR, but not 
eGFR from creatinine or cystatin C, was higher in the prediabetic groups. The distribution of 
mGFR and ACR (log-transformed) at baseline, and of change in mGFR and ACR (log-
transformed) between baseline and follow-up is shown in Figure 2. 
The association between baseline glycemic status and mGFR at follow-up 
Higher baseline FG and HbAR1c
R values and prediabetes according to either definition were 
associated with a higher mGFR at follow-up, adjusted for age, sex and use of ACE-i or ARB, 
systolic aBP, BMI, smoking status, fasting insulin levels, physical exercise and ACR (Table 
2, model 2). One percentage unit higher HbAR1c
R at baseline was associated with a 3.8 
ml/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI, 1.4-6.1) higher mGFR at follow-up. FG, HbAR1c
R and prediabetesRIEC
R, 
but not prediabetesRADA
R, remained predictors of an increased mGFR after adjusting for 
baseline mGFR, change in glucose and change in anti-hypertensive medication from baseline 
to follow-up (model 3). Similar results but with larger estimates were obtained when we used 
absolute GFR at follow up (without BSA indexing) as dependent variable (Supplemental 
Table 2) 
The mean annual change in mGFR (ΔGFRa in ml/min/year) was -1.0 (95% CI: -1.1 to -0.9) 
ml/min/year for persons without prediabetes and -0.7 (95% CI: -1.0 to 0.4) ml/min/year for 
those with prediabetesRIEC
R after adjusting for sex, age and baseline mGFR. One unit higher 
baseline FG and HbAR1c
R values were associated with a 0.39 (95% CI: 0.08-0.69) ml/min/year 
10 
 
 and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.04-0.76) ml/min/year slower mGFR decline (higher ΔGFRa), 
respectively, in the multivariable adjusted regression model (Figure 3 and Supplemental Table 
3).  
There were no significant non-linear associations between FG or HbAR1c
R and ΔGFRa or 
mGFR at follow-up (Supplemental Figure 1a and 1b). 
Glycemic status and odds ratio for hyperfiltration, CKD and high normal ACR 
The adjusted odds ratios for incident hyperfiltration and for CKD, defined as mGFR < 60 
ml/min/1.73 m2 at follow-up, are shown in Table 3. Higher baseline FG and HbAR1c
R values and 
prediabetesRIEC
R at baseline were associated with increased odds of hyperfiltration at follow-up 
(model 2, Table 3). HbAR1c
R and prediabetesRIEC
R remained significant predictors of 
hyperfiltration after an additional adjustment for baseline hyperfiltration status (model 3). 
High HbAR1c
R and prediabetesRADA
R were associated with reduced odds of having an mGFR < 60 
ml/min/1.73 m2 at follow-up in all models.  R  
Eighty-eight persons had an ACR > 10 mg/g at follow-up. High baseline FG and 
prediabetesRIEC
R, butR 
Rnot HbAR1c
R and prediabetesRADA
R, were associated with an increased odds for 
high normal ACR (Table 4). Baseline FG remained a significant predictor of high normal 
ACR in all models, whereas prediabetesRIEC
R was only borderline significant after adjusting for 
baseline ACR (model 3, Table 4). Persons with prediabetes defined by only an impaired 
fasting glucose (FG: 110-125 mg/dL) (N = 75) had an OR of 3.2 (95% CI: 1.4-7.3) for a high 
normal ACR in the fully adjusted model. 
Finally, we repeated all main analyses after adjusting for night-time instead of daytime aBP 
and after including the 38 persons with diabetes at follow-up. The results were essentially 
similar as in table 2, 3 and 4. The results were also similar without adjustment for the 2.28 
11 
 
 ml/min/1.73 m2 drift in the method for iohexol clearance measurement between baseline and 
follow-up. 
 
DISCUSSION 
In this cohort from a general middle-aged population without diabetes, we found that different 
measures of borderline hyperglycemia were predictors of higher mGFR and hyperfiltration 
after nearly 6 years follow up. FG and prediabetesRIEC 
Rwere also risk factors for increased 
ACR.   
To our knowledge, no prior study of the general population has assessed the longitudinal 
association between prediabetes and mGFR. In a study of Pima Indians, Nelson et al. found 
that mGFR (given as absolute GFR in ml/min) increased during 4 years follow up in 28 
persons with an impaired glucose tolerance at baseline.28 However, the mean baseline BMI in 
these individuals was 39 kg/m2, and the increase in mGFR was most prominent in the 12 
persons who developed diabetes at follow-up.28 Moreover, the results were not statistically 
significant when the change in mGFR was scaled by body surface area (ml/min/1.73 m2).29 
Several previous population-based studies with 4-8 years of follow up reported that 
prediabetes did not predict CKD or decreased GFR when using eGFR after adjusting for 
cardiovascular risk factors.6-9 Schottker et al. concluded that prediabetes is not a likely a cause 
for the development of kidney disease.7 In contrast, we found that prediabetes predicted 
higher mGFR and hyperfiltration after almost six years of follow up. If hyperfiltration in 
prediabetes represents a maladaptive response to metabolic changes, as indicated by animal 
models and in studies of patients with diabetes,13,14,30 the process of kidney damage is likely 
to start early in the course of chronic hyperglycemia. The current finding of an increased risk 
12 
 
 of developing elevated ACR for those with a higher baseline FG or prediabetesRIEC
R  after 
excluding persons with diabetes at baseline and follow-up supports this theory.   
Hyperfiltration combined with hyperglycemia has been found to induce podocyte stress, 
podocyte injury, and cell apoptosis in animal models.31 However, it remains unclear whether 
hyperfiltration itself is harmful and what the long-term consequences of hyperfiltration are in 
prediabetes. We did not find that prediabetes increased the odds ratio of having a mGFR < 60 
ml/min/1.73 m2 after 5.6 years. In contrast, HbAR1c
R and prediabetesRADA
R were associated with a 
reduced risk of mGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, most likely due to the hyperfiltration effect 
(Table 3). A study of mGFR with a longer follow up time is needed to address whether 
hyperfiltration in prediabetes predicts overt CKD. Interestingly, a meta-analysis of diabetes-
related hyperfiltration studies that used mGFR, and also a recent prospective study of mGFR 
in 600 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, found an increased hazard ratio of 
developing diabetes nephropathy in those with hyperfiltration at baseline.13,32 However, 
hyperfiltration did not predict diabetes nephropathy in studies that estimated the GFR by 
creatinine or cystatin C.33,34 Compared to persons with normoglycemia, our study found a 
significantly higher mGFR, but not a higher eGFRcre or eGFRcys, in persons with 
prediabetes at baseline. This difference may be due to the low precision of the equations used 
to estimate GFR in the normal range of GFR. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that 
risk factors such as fasting glucose, obesity and smoking, as well as non-traditional CVD risk 
factors, influence cystatin C- and creatinine-based eGFR after accounting for mGFR.16-18 
Accordingly, eGFR should not be used in studies of hyperfiltration and may also be 
inadequate in examining the association between glucose and early GFR decline. 
Furthermore, the current finding of a longitudinal association between borderline 
13 
 
 hyperglycemia and increased mGFR or hyperfiltration has consequences for the use of GFR 
decline rate as an outcome in observational studies and clinical trials.  
We found that high baseline FG and prediabetesRIEC
R were associated with increased odds for 
high normal ACR. A few longitudinal investigations have reported the association between 
prediabetes or non-diabetic hyperglycemia and the risk of albuminuria; the results are 
conflicting.9,10,35 Most of these studies did not adjust for other cardiovascular risk factors, but 
in two population-based studies in persons without diabetes, increased FG in men and HbAR1c
R 
in both genders were found to be independent predictors of increased urinary albumin 
excretion.22,36 However, neither of these studies excluded persons with diabetes at follow-up. 
Because elevated ACR may be a result of hypertension and early nephropathy, we adjusted 
for baseline ambulatory BP, use of antihypertensive medication and change in 
antihypertensive medication during follow-up, and obtained similar results. We also adjusted 
for fasting insulin levels because reduced insulin sensitivity has been associated with greater 
risk of albuminuria.37 Our results are noteworthy because ACR > 10 mg/g has been found to 
predict CVD, CKD and death in general-population cohorts.23,24 Importantly, potential 
interventions like diet and physical activity promotion programs in prediabetes have been 
shown to reduces glucose levels.38 Furthermore, physical exercise have been shown to reduce 
the odds ratio of hyperfiltration and to modify the effect of fasting glucose on GFR.39 In 
addition, new treatment options in hyperglycemia like the Sodium/Glucose Cotransporter 2 
(SGLT2) inhibitors may prevent hyperfiltration independently of the glucose lowering 
effect.40 However, a possible renoprotective effect of physical exercise and SGLT2 inhibition 
needs to been confirmed.  
Our study has some limitations, including the following: only middle-aged Caucasians 
participated, limiting generalizability to other groups; furthermore, we did not perform a 
14 
 
 glucose tolerance test to assess non-fasting hyperglycemia. However, we combined fasting 
glucose and HbAR1c
R and used accepted definitions of prediabetes.26,27 There is no consensus on 
how to define glomerular hyperfiltration in population studies.  Hyperfiltration at a whole 
kidney level is likely to reflect hyperfiltration at the glomerular level, but is also influenced by 
the number of nephrons. Since nephron numbers varies between individuals and by sex and 
age, we used an adjusted definition of hyperfiltration as reported in detail previously.12 
A major strength of this study is that GFR was measured by iohexol clearance at baseline and 
follow-up in a large cohort from the general population. To our knowledge, RENIS is the only 
longitudinal study measuring GFR in the general population. FG and HbAR1c
R were measured 
twice, and we excluded those persons who developed diabetes at follow-up. Urine was 
collected on three separate days both at baseline and at follow-up, and albumin and creatinine 
were assessed in unfrozen specimens. Finally, we were able to control for several possible 
confounders, including ambulatory BP at baseline and changes in antihypertensive medication 
during follow-up.  
 In conclusion, we found that prediabetes was an independent risk factor for hyperfiltration 
and increased ACR during 5.6 years follow up in a representative cohort of the general 
population. Our findings suggest an independent role of prediabetes in CKD development and 
may in part explain the negative results of previous longitudinal studies of prediabetes that 
defined CKD based on eGFR only. Studies with longer follow up times, preferably with 
measured GFR and/or with albuminuria as outcomes, are needed to establish whether non-
diabetic hyperglycemia is an independent predictor of CKD. If so, prediabetes might be a 
target for early treatment to prevent the increasing burden of CKD in diabetes.
