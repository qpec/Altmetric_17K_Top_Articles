Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) develops in only a small proportion of heavy drinkers. To better understand the mechanisms
underlying this disparity, we conducted a study to define the relationship between AH development and dysregulated
immune responses that might be ameliorated by alcohol abstinence. Sixty-eight AH patients, 65 heavy drinking controls
without liver disease (HDC), and 20 healthy controls were enrolled and followed up to 12 months. At baseline, HDC and
healthy controls had no significant differences in their plasma levels of 38 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines measured
using multiplex immunoassays. However, compared to HDC, AH patients had higher baseline levels of 11 cytokines/che-
mokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, interferon gamma–induced protein 10, IL-4, IL-9, IL-
10, fibroblast growth factor 2, IL-7, IL-15, and transforming growth factor alpha) but lower levels of the anti-
inflammatory macrophage-derived chemokine. AH patients also had more activated yet dysfunctional immune cells as
monocytes, T cells, and B cells expressed higher levels of cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) and CD69 but low levels of
human leukocyte antigen DR, CD80, and CD86 at baseline. In addition, CD4 T cells produced less interferon-gamma in
response to T-cell stimulation. Up-regulated IL-6, IL-8, CD38, and CD69 and down-regulated macrophage-derived che-
mokine, human leukocyte antigen DR, CD86, and CD80 correlated positively and negatively, respectively, with disease
severity. Longitudinal analysis indicated that levels of IL-6, IL-8, CD38, and CD69 were reduced, whereas levels of
macrophage-derived chemokine, human leukocyte antigen DR, CD80, and CD86 were increased in abstinent AH
patients. All of the cellular immune abnormalities were reversed by day 360 in abstinent AH patients; however, plasma
levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-8, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor 2, and IL-7 remained higher. Conclusion: AH
patients were in a highly immune-dysregulated state, whereas HDC showed little evidence of immune activation; alcohol
abstinence reversed most, but not all, of the immunological abnormalities. (HEPATOLOGY 2017;66:575-590).
M
ore than 2 billion people worldwide consume
alcohol on a regular basis. Of these, approxi-
mately 76 million suffer from alcohol-related
disorders.(1) Long-term heavy drinkers develop a spec-
trum of severe alcoholic liver disease (ALD), ranging
from alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and fibrosis/cirrhosis to
hepatocellular carcinoma.(2) AH is a severe and progres-
sive liver inflammatory disease associated with significant
morbidity and mortality, for which there are no effective
medical therapies.(3-5) Alcohol-induced dysregulation of
both innate and adaptive immune systems has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of AH.(6-8)

MERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR
 Heavy alcohol consumption causes overactivation
of innate immunity components in both the periph-
eral blood and the liver tissue by way of gut-derived
bacterial toxins such as lipopolysaccharides and the
hepatic stress of alcohol metabolism.(9,10) Conse-
quently, AH patients have elevated circulating levels
of a variety of proinflammatory factors in association
with elevated anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective
cytokines, such as interleukin 10 (IL-10).(11,12) Stud-
ies have demonstrated that circulating levels of tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), IL-6, IL-8, macro-
phage/monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and macro-
phage inflammatory protein 3a correlate with the
severity of AH and that two of them (TNF-a and IL-
6) also correlate with AH mortality.(13-16) Abstinence
from alcohol improves clinical symptoms for most
AH patients and has been shown to reduce IL-6
level.(17,18) Increased hepatic oxidative stress and
overactivation of liver cells, including resident macro-
phages (Kupffer cells) and hepatocytes, have also been
observed in AH patients.(9,10) These alternations
increase infiltration of inflammatory cells including
monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells into the liver,
leading to liver damage.(16,19)
Alcohol abuse also impairs the adaptive immune
system.(6,20) Studies in both humans and animal mod-
els have demonstrated that chronic alcohol abuse has a
significant impact on T-cell biology including a
reduction in count, impairment of development and
function, disturbance of the balance between effector
and regulatory T-cell types, influence of phenotype
and activation, and promotion of cell apoptosis.(6,20)
Alcohol abuse also affects multiple aspects of B cell–
mediated immunity,(6,21,22) leading to reduced num-
bers and function of B cells while simultaneously
increasing
production
of
immunoglobulins.(6,21,22)
Particularly, levels of autoantibodies against liver-
specific antigens are increased in AH patients and may
promote
alcohol-related
liver
damage.(6)
Due
to
alcohol-induced impairment of both innate and adap-
tive immunity, chronic alcohol drinkers are more sus-
ceptible to many infectious pathogens with delayed
infection recovery, thus extending hospital stays and
increasing morbidity and mortality.(23)
The reason why alcohol abuse causes AH in a subset
of patients with excessive alcohol use and what deter-
mines the severity of AH is not yet fully understood.
Most studies have compared AH patients with healthy
controls (HC) or patients with clinically stable alco-
holic cirrhosis to try to understand the immunological
differences underlying the apparent individual suscep-
tibility to AH. We conducted a study to define the
relationship between AH and dysregulated immune
responses among heavy drinkers with or without AH
and to investigate immune recovery associated with
alcohol abstinence.

 Materials and Methods
STUDY SUBJECTS AND BLOOD
SAMPLES
The 68 AH patients and 65 heavy drinking controls
(HDC) included in this study were enrolled into the
ongoing
multicenter
prospective
Translational
Research and Evolving Alcoholic Hepatitis Treatment
001 study (TREAT 001, NCT02172898). Demo-
graphic and clinical characterizations as well as drink-
ing patterns of the study subjects are shown in Table 1.
Detailed definitions of AH and HDC and the inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria have been described.(24)
Briefly, AH was defined as the onset of aspartate ami-
notransferase (AST) >50 IU/L and elevated total bili-
rubin (initially >2 mg/dL but amended to >3 mg/
dL)(25) in patients with a long drinking history who
were drinking heavily within the 6 weeks prior to
enrollment. A liver biopsy was performed to confirm
AH diagnosis in patients with uncertainty about drink-
ing history or atypical clinical features. HDC were
individuals with a comparable history of alcohol con-
sumption but no clinical evidence of liver disease (AST
�50 U/L, alanine aminotransferase [ALT] �50 U/L,
total bilirubin within normal limits) and matched for
age and sex. The study was approved by the institu-
tional review boards at Indiana University School of
Medicine and Mayo Clinic. All participants provided
written informed consent.
Peripheral blood was collected in heparin-coated
tubes (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Plasma
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were isolated and stored at –80oC until use. Baseline
AH samples were taken at presentation. For AH
patients treated with corticosteroids and/or pentoxifyl-
line, samples were taken within a few days of treat-
ment. Some study subjects were fasting before the
blood draw (Table 1). Plasma samples from 20 age-
matched and sex-matched healthy volunteers without
self-reported excessive drinking history were also
included as HC.

and vascular endothelial growth factor) were simulta-
neously measured using a magnetic bead–based multi-
plex kit (HCYTMAG-60K-PX38; EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA). The concentrations of cytokines/che-
mokines were calculated using Bio-Plex Manager v6.1
software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For statistical anal-
yses, values below the detection limit of the assay were
replaced with the minimal detectable concentrations
for each analyte as provided by the manufacturer.
Plasma concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and MDC
were also measured using IL-6 and IL-8 quantikine
high sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kits and the Human CCL22/MDC DuoSet
ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), respec-
tively, to validate the multiplex immunoassay results.
FLOW CYTOMETRY
PBMCs were subjected to cell surface staining and
intracellular staining to determine leukocyte pheno-
type, activation, and immune response. For cell surface
staining, PBMCs were incubated with fluorochrome-
conjugated antibodies against CD4, CD8, CD14,
CD16, CD19, CD38, CD69, CD80, CD86, and
human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR; Biolegend,
San Diego, CA). Stained cells were fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde and subsequently analyzed using a
SORP FACSAria cytometer (BD Biosciences). For
intracellular staining, PBMCs were cultured for 24
hours in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute
1640 medium containing 1 lg/mL of soluble anti-
CD28 antibody (clone 28.1) and 20 U/mL human IL-
2 in flat-bottomed 96-well plates precoated with 1 lg/
mL of anti-CD3 antibody (clone OKT3). Brefeldin A
(eBioscience, San Diego, CA) was added to a final
concentration of 3 lM for the last 6 hours of incuba-
tion. Stimulated cells were stained with CD3, CD4,
CD8, and IFN-c antibodies using the Cytofix/Cyto-
perm kit (BD Biosciences). Flow data were analyzed

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Differences in cross-sectional analysis for continu-
ous variables between two groups were calculated using
the Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test with
Dunn’s corrections for comparisons among three
groups. A chi-squared test was used for comparison
between groups for categorical variables. The linear
relationship between two variables was analyzed using
the Spearman correlation test. Differences in longitu-
dinal analysis were calculated using the Friedman rank
sum test with Dunn’s corrections. P < 0.05 was con-
sidered to be statistically significant.
Results
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
STUDY COHORT
Table 1 shows characteristics of AH patients,
HDC, and HC. Fasting rates at baseline and 6-month
and 1-year follow-up were similar between AH
patients and HDC, but a higher percentage of HC
were fasting compared to HDC. Age and gender dis-
tributions
and
creatinine
levels
were
comparable
among the three groups. The HDC had significantly
more drinks in the last 30 days before enrollment than
AH patients. As expected, the baseline Model for
End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and liver bio-
chemistries (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin) were
highly elevated in AH patients in comparison with
HDC and HC. Prothrombin time was significantly
increased in AH patients compared to HDC. In addi-
tion, median neutrophil counts were significantly
higher (P < 0.001) in AH patients (6.35 3 109/L;
interquartile range 4.1-15.0, n 5 48) than in HDC
(3.3 3 109/L; interquartile range 2.5-4.5, n 5 56).
Although HDC and HC had similar amounts of total
bilirubin and AST, HDC had higher levels of ALT
than HC. Thirty-nine AH patients were treated with
corticosteroids and/or pentoxifylline (25 with steroids,
3 with pentoxifylline, and 11 with both) at the discre-
tion of treating physicians. Fifteen AH patients (26%)
died within 6 months after recruitment. The complete
abstinence rate was 64% and 72% for AH patients and
42% and 50% for HDC at days 180 and 360, respec-
tively. Liver biochemistries markedly improved in AH
patients and remained unchanged for HDC. However,
the MELD scores, total bilirubin and AST, and pro-
thrombin time remained abnormal in abstinent AH
patients at 12 months (Supporting Table S1).
AH PATIENTS HAD
DYSREGULATED PLASMA LEVELS
OF PROINFLAMMATORY AND
ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
CYTOKINES/CHEMOKINES
To assess immune characteristics in the peripheral
blood from AH patients and HDC, we first performed
multiplex immunoassays to quantify plasma levels of
38
human
inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines.
Plasma samples from 20 healthy volunteers were used
as HC. The cross-sectional analysis results are summa-
rized in Table 2 and Supporting Table S2. Compared
to the HDC group, AH patients had significantly
higher baseline plasma levels of 11 cytokines/chemo-
kines including four proinflammatory cytokines/che-
mokines (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, and IP10), three anti-
inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-9, and IL-10), and
four growth factors (FGF-2, IL-7, IL-15, and TGF-
a). IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that can have
both proinflammatory and hepatoprotective effects in
AH(12,26) and was classified as a proinflammatory cyto-
kine in this study. At day 180, the four up-regulated
proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines (TNF-a, IL-
6, IL-8, and IP10) remained significantly higher in
AH patients than in HDC. At day 360, 3 proinflam-
matory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8) were still
higher, while two anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-9
and IL-10) and 2 growth factors (FGF-2 and IL-7)
were resumed among the 11 up-regulated factors in
AH patients. However, by day 180 and day 360, IL-6
and IL-8 levels greatly decreased from the baseline val-
ues in AH patients while remaining unchanged in
HDC. Interestingly, MDC, an anti-inflammatory
macrophage-derived chemokine, was the only cyto-
kine/chemokine whose baseline level was significantly
lower in AH patients than in HDC; but at day 360
MDC levels became higher in AH than in HDC.
These results indicate that proinflammatory cytokines/
chemokines decreased while anti-inflammatory factors
increased
in
AH
patients
over
the
1
year
of
observation.
We next compared baseline plasma levels of 38 cyto-
kines/chemokines in AH patients and HDC with HC
(Table 2; Supporting Table S2). AH patients had sig-
nificantly higher levels of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8,

the plasma levels of the 38 cytokines/chemokines ana-
lyzed were not significantly different between HDC
and HC.
We used IL-6 and IL-8 ELISAs to validate the
multiplex results as IL-6 and IL-8 were the most
highly up-regulated cytokines in AH patients (Sup-
porting Table S2). Multiplex and ELISA data showed
that IL-6 and IL-8 levels were significantly higher in
AH patients than in HDC (Fig. 1A,B). In addition,
cytokine levels measured by the two methods were sig-
nificantly correlated (Fig. 1C). As MDC was a novel
marker not previously identified in AH patients, we
also quantified MDC levels by ELISA. We confirmed

 that MDC plasma levels were significantly lower and
higher in AH patients than HDC at baseline and day
360, respectively (Fig. 1A,B). Furthermore, MDC lev-
els determined by the two techniques were significantly
correlated (Fig. 1C).
Together, our data indicated that AH patients had a
highly dysregulated and persistent production of
inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines
compared
to
HDC and HC, whereas HDC did not show evidence
of inflammatory factors in comparison with HC.
CELLULAR MARKERS OF
IMMUNE ACTIVATION WERE
HIGHLY DYSREGULATED
IN AH PATIENTS
As cytokines/chemokines regulate activation and
function of both the innate and adaptive immune cells,
we analyzed activation status of immune cells in
PBMC samples from these subjects. Compared with
HDC, monocytes from AH patients expressed higher
levels of the activation markers CD38 and CD69 (per-
centage and median fluorescent intensity [MFI]) but
lower levels of the antigen-presenting molecules major
histocompatibility complex II HLA-DR (MFI) and
the costimulatory molecules CD80 (percentage and
MFI) and CD86 (MFI) at baseline (Table 3; Support-
ing Table S3). These results suggest that monocytes in
AH patients are aberrantly activated and would have
impaired capacity to activate antigen-specific T cells
due to low expression of HLA-DR and costimulatory
molecules. Further analyses demonstrated that AH
patients still had significantly lower levels of CD80
(percentage and MFI) and CD86 (MFI) at day 180,
but by day 360 all these markers were similarly
expressed on monocytes in both the AH and HDC
groups. The recovery expression of costimulatory

 molecules on monocytes in AH patients by day 360 is
likely due to alcohol abstinence as the majority of AH
patients achieved alcohol abstinence by this time point.
In fact, the results were similar to those obtained from
the comparison between abstinent AH patients and
HDC (data not shown).
We
next
compared
T-cell
immunity
in
AH
patients and HDC (Table 3; Supporting Table S3).
We found that baseline frequency of CD8 T cells was
decreased in AH patients. In addition, AH patients
had a higher percentage of CD69-expressing CD4
and CD8 T cells and a higher percentage of CD38-
expressing CD8 T cells. At follow-up, expression of
these T-cell markers became comparable between the
AH and HDC groups. The frequency of CD69-
expressing CD8 T cells was lower in AH patients at
day 360, but this difference was not seen when com-
paring cells from abstinent AH patients and HDC
(data not shown). We also examined the functional
capacity of T cells to produce IFN-c in response to
T-cell receptor stimulation and found that the CD4
cells from AH patients produced significantly less
IFN-c (Table 3; Supporting Table S3). For B cells,
CD80 expression (percentage and MFI) was reduced
in AH patients at baseline, but there were no differ-
ences at follow-up time points.
Taken together, the peripheral blood immune cells
in AH patients expressed higher levels of activation
markers but lower levels of antigen-presentation and
costimulatory molecules, and the CD4 T cells had
reduced responses to T-cell receptor stimulation. All
of the cellular immune abnormalities were reversed by
day 360 with alcohol abstinence.
CORRELATION OF IMMUNE
MARKERS WITH CLINICAL
PROFILES OF AH PATIENTS
To explore whether the differentially expressed
immune factors play a pathogenic role in AH, we per-
formed linear regression analysis to detect their correla-
tion with disease severity represented by clinical scores
(MELD score) and biochemical measurements (AST,
ALT, total bilirubin, creatinine, and prothrombin
time) in AH patients. Immunoprofiling data as well as
neutrophil counts at enrollment and follow-ups were
pooled for these analysis, and the results are summa-
rized in Supporting Table S4. Blood neutrophil counts
had significant correlations with multiple clinical indi-
cators of disease severity (MELD score, total bilirubin,
AST, and prothrombin time). IL-6 and IL-8 levels
were highly correlated with clinical parameters such as
MELD score. In addition, circulating levels of IL-8, a
potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, were strongly
correlated with neutrophil counts (Spearman coeffi-
cient of 0.65, P < 0.0001). IL-15, TGF-a, and TNF-
a showed significant but weak correlations with clinical
parameters. MDC was negatively correlated with dis-
ease severity, as indicated by MELD score, total biliru-
bin, prothrombin time, and AST. Similarly, up-
regulated cellular activation markers (CD38 on mono-
cytes and CD8 T cells, CD69 on both CD4 and CD8
T cells) were positively correlated with MELD score,
total bilirubin, and AST. In contrast, down-regulated
cellular markers CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR on
monocytes and CD80 on B cells showed negative cor-
relations with MELD score, total bilirubin, and AST.
We next compared the baseline levels of immune
parameters in AH patients who died within 6 months
and survivors to identify markers associated with 6-
month mortality. The only marker that was differen-
tially expressed was CD38 MFI on monocytes, with
nonsurvivors having lower levels (Supporting Fig. S1).
Further, we investigated if any of the immunopara-
meters could predict survival by performing Kaplan-
Meier survival analysis. Again, the only parameter that
predicted 90-day or 180-day mortality was the level of
CD38 expression (MFI) on monocytes (using MFI of
2,999 as a cutoff value). AH patients with lower CD38
expression had higher 90-day and 180-day mortality
(Fig. 2A).
Thirty-nine of the 68 AH patients were treated with
the corticosteroid prednisone and/or pentoxifylline,
two drugs that suppress inflammation in AH patients
through different mechanisms. Corticosteroids reduce
proinflammatory
cytokines
and
increase
anti-
inflammatory cytokines, whereas pentoxifylline mainly
inhibits TNF-a production. To determine how the
steroid treatment impacted the immunoprofiles in AH
patients, we compared immune markers in AH
patients treated with prednisone alone or together with
pentoxifylline and in untreated patients. Levels of IL-
6, IL-7, IL-9, TNF-a, IFN-a2, granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor, and fractalkine were lower in the
treated group (Fig. 2B; Supporting Table S5). How-
ever, treated patients still had higher levels of inflam-
matory cytokines IL-8 and eotaxin and lower MDC
levels (Fig. 2B; Supporting Table S5). Treatment also
improved T-cell function as CD4 and CD8 T cells in
treated patients had enhanced capacity to produce of
IFN-c in response to T-cell receptor stimulation.
Interestingly,
treated

 frequencies of CD38-expressing monocytes (Fig. 2B;
Supporting Table S5). The remaining immune markers
did not show differences between treated and untreated
patients (Supporting Table S5 and data not shown).
We next examined whether treatment with cortico-
steroids had an impact on immune responses at
follow-ups in alcohol-abstinent AH patients. At days
180 and 360, levels of all immune markers except the
frequency of CD38-expressing monocytes were simi-
lar between the treated and untreated patients (Sup-
porting Table S5). It is pertinent to note that treated
AH patients had higher MELD score and total bili-
rubin level and longer prothrombin time but similar
levels of creatinine, AST, and ALT (Supporting Fig.
S2), indicating that treated patients had more severe
liver disease than untreated patients at the study
entry.
Taken together, our data suggested that corticoste-
roids reduced dysregulation of most, but not all, of the
immune mediators and that steroid treatment did not
appear to have additional long-term immunological
benefits in alcohol-abstinent AH patients.
LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF
PLASMA LEVELS OF CYTOKINES/

OF IMMUNE CELLS IN
ALCOHOL-ABSTINENT
AH AND HDC
Longitudinal analysis of plasma levels of cytokines/
chemokines showed that alcohol abstinence only ame-
liorated dysregulated levels of IL-8 and MDC in AH
patients. Plasma levels of IL-8 and MDC were signif-
icantly reduced and increased, respectively, in AH
patients at day 180 versus baseline (Fig. 3A). Plasma
levels of IL-8 remained significantly lower and MDC
levels remained higher (although not significantly) at
day 360 versus baseline (Fig. 3A). IL-6 levels in AH
patients trended to be lower during follow-up (P 5
0.08) (data not shown). IL-6, IL-8, and MDC levels
in the HDC did not show longitudinal changes (Fig.
3B). Consistent with the finding that the majority of
the 12 dysregulated cytokines/chemokines did not
show significant longitudinal changes in alcohol-

 abstinent AH patients, cross-sectional analysis of
day-180
and
day-360
follow-up
samples
from
alcohol-abstinent AH patients and HDC revealed
that AH patients still had significantly higher levels
of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, and IP10 at day 180 and
TNF-a, IL-8, IL-7, and FGF-2 at day 360 (Support-
ing Table S6).
We next examined longitudinal changes of the cell
activation and costimulatory markers that were differ-
entially expressed in AH patients and HDC. Expres-
sion levels of CD69 (percentage) on CD4 T cells were
significantly reduced in AH only at day 360 (Fig. 4A);
expression of CD38 on monocytes (MFI) in AH
trended to be lower during follow-up (P 5 0.085).
Concurrently,
CD80
levels
on
monocytes
were
increased by days 180 and 360 in AH patients, and
CD86 and HLA-DR MFI on monocytes and CD80
MFI on B cells were also increased by day 360 (Fig.
4A; Supporting Fig. S3) in AH patients. Interestingly,
monocytes from HDC also up-regulated CD80 and
CD86 expression at day 360 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that
heavy drinking also led to phenotypical abnormalities
in monocytes at recruitment even in those without
AH.
Together, our data indicated that the dysregulated
cytokines/chemokines and cellular immune markers in
AH patients as well as HDC improved with alcohol
abstinence.
Discussion
In the present study, we performed a comprehensive
cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of soluble and
cellular immune markers in the peripheral blood of a
large cohort of AH patients and matched heavy
drinkers without liver disease as well as HC (Table 1).
This is a major advantage of our study as it can identify
(1) changes related to heavy drinking alone, (2)
changes that occur when AH develops, and (3)
immune recovery following alcohol abstinence. We
demonstrated that HDC had few indications of dysre-
gulated immune profiles (Table 2). In contrast, AH
patients exhibited a highly dysregulated production of
cytokines/chemokines, immune cell activation, and
neutrophilia when compared to HDC or HC (Tables
2 and 3). We identified 11 up-regulated cytokines/che-
mokines, including four proinflammatory cytokines
(TNF-a,

anti-
inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-9, and IL-10), four
growth factors (FGF-2, IL-7, IL-15, and TGF-a),
and one down-regulated chemokine (MDC) (Table
2). Both monocytes and T cells up-regulated the cell
activation markers CD38 and CD69, whereas mono-
cytes
and
B
cells
down-regulated
the
antigen-
presenting molecules HLA-DR and the costimulatory
molecules CD80 and CD86 (Table 3). Levels of up-
regulated IL-6, IL-8, CD38, and CD69 and neutro-
phil count positively correlated with disease severity of
AH, whereas down-regulated CD80, CD86, HLA-
DR, and MDC showed negative correlations (Sup-
porting Table S4). CD38 expression levels on mono-
cytes predicted 3-month and 6-month mortality.
Analysis of follow-up and longitudinal samples indi-
cated that immune markers in AH patients drastically
improved but were not completely recovered with alco-
hol abstinence, which is consistent with changes in
their clinical profiles.
Of the 12 dysregulated cytokines/chemokines iden-
tified in our study, the proinflammatory cytokines/che-
mokines (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, and IP10), the anti-
inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), and the
growth factor (IL-15) have been shown to be elevated
in patients with ALD in comparison to HC or those
with stable alcoholic cirrhosis.(13,14,18,27,28) Serum IL-
7 concentration is higher in alcohol-dependent indi-
viduals without clinical AH than HC.(29) We found
that IL-8, a potent neutrophil chemotactic factor, was
the most highly up-regulated cytokine in AH patients
and remained higher in abstinent AH patients. In
addition, IL-8 accumulation was more resistant to cor-
ticosteroid treatment than other proinflammatory cyto-
kines, such as IL-6 and TNF-a. IL-8 levels were
highly correlated with disease severity and neutrophilia.
Hepatic neutrophil infiltration and neutrophilia are
prominent features of AH, which correlate with dis-
ease severity.(25) Future study on the relationship
between IL-8 and activation/function of both circulat-
ing and hepatic neutrophils is warranted. Furthermore,
our findings lend support to the blockade of IL-8 as a
therapeutic strategy to reduce hepatic neutrophil infil-
tration and AH severity as demonstrated recently in an
experimental ALD model.(30)
We also identified four novel cytokines/chemokines
(TGF-a, FGF-2, IL-9, and MDC) that were differen-
tially expressed in AH patients. TGF-a binding to its
receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor) stimulates
hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration after
toxic liver injury.(31) As TGF-a levels correlated with
AH severity, up-regulation of TGF-a might represent
a failed attempt to repair liver damage through liver
regeneration. The level of the multifunctional protein

 FGF-2 increased with the progression of chronic liver
diseases from chronic hepatitis to liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular
carcinoma(32)
and
is implicated
in
hepatic fibrogenesis.(33) The elevated levels of FGF-2
may reflect the observation that nearly all AH patients
have some degree of fibrosis at diagnosis.(34) IL-9 is
mainly produced by Th9 and Th17 cells, two subsets
of CD4 T cells. It is possible that enhanced levels of
IL-9 in AH patients contribute to alcohol-induced
intestinal permeability as IL-9 impairs intestinal bar-
rier functions in patients with ulcerative colitis.(35)
MDC was down-regulated in AH patients com-
pared to HDC. MDC is produced by dendritic cells
(DCs) and macrophages, in particular the activated
anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing M2 type of
macrophages.(36) Alcohol is known to suppress the dif-
ferentiation of M2 macrophages and skew macro-
phages toward the proinflammatory M1 type in ALD
patients, whereas M2 hepatic macrophages protect
against ALD.(37) MDC is a chemotactic ligand for
chemokine (C-C) motif receptor 4, which is preferen-
tially expressed on Th2 lymphocytes, skin-homing T
cells, and the immunosuppressive regulatory T cells
(Tregs).(38) MDC not only recruits Tregs to the sites
of inflammation but also activates and enhances Treg
function.(39) Interestingly, serum levels of MDC are
also lower in patients with chronic inflammatory liver
diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary
biliary
cirrhosis,
and
autoimmune
hepatitis
than
HC.(38) We speculate that predominant M1 polariza-
tion in ALD leads to reduced production of MDC
and subsequently fewer Tregs infiltrating the liver and
more severe liver inflammation. Therefore, MDC aug-
mentation may be explored as a potential new immune
modulation therapy to attenuate AH and other inflam-
matory liver conditions.
The immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 was among
the highly up-regulated circulatory factors in AH
patients. IL-10 suppresses the production of proin-
flammatory cytokines by many cell types such as
Kupffer cells, monocytes, and T cells. IL-10 also
down-regulates the expression of HLA-DR, CD80,
and CD86 on professional antigen-presenting cells,
including monocytes/macrophages, DCs, and B cells,
thereby impairing T-cell activation. Indeed, the base-
line expression levels of these molecules were greatly
reduced on monocytes and B cells in AH patients.
Thus, the increased level of IL-10 may contribute to
these changes in the circulating antigen-presenting
cells. Alcohol has been shown to reduce CD80 and
CD86 expression on DCs and DC costimulatory
function.(40) It is likely that reduced expression of
HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86 on various antigen-
presenting cells leads to suboptimal function of
pathogen-specific T cells, which contributes to the dis-
cordance between heightened immune activation and
increased susceptibility and severity to infections as
observed in AH patients.(20,41,42)
Both monocytes and CD8 T cells in AH patients
expressed significantly higher levels of CD38 (Table 3;
Supporting Table S3). CD38 has diverse functions in
T-cell activation and proliferation, cytokine release,
and monocyte chemotaxis toward sites of inflammation
as well as adhesion of T cells and monocytes to endo-
thelial cells. As one of the pathophysiological features
in AH patients is the accumulation of intrahepatic
monocytes and T cells, we speculate that up-regulation
of CD38 on monocytes and CD8 T cells could play a
role in the infiltration of activated circulating mono-
cytes and T cells into the liver. Surprisingly, lower
baseline CD38 expression level on monocytes was the
only factor that predicted 3-month and 6-month mor-
tality in AH patients (Fig. 2). As stated above, CD38
expressed
on
monocytes
has
multiple
functions,
including enhancing adherence to endothelial cells. It
is possible that the hyperadherence of activated mono-
cytes to endothelium mediated by overexpression of
CD38 impedes instead of promotes transmigration of
monocytes from blood vessels toward the liver, causing
less intrahepatic accumulation of macrophages, less
liver damage, and lower mortality.
Alcohol abstinence, the most important aspect for
ALD treatment, significantly improves the disease out-
come and survival; but it does not lead to complete
recovery in most ALD patients.(2) Consistent with this
result, clinical scores and liver function in our alcohol-
abstinent AH patients greatly improved but were still
abnormal during the follow-ups (Supporting Table
S1). In addition, some of the up-regulated cytokines,
including the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a and
IL-8, were not normalized. The cellular markers
appeared to be more responsive to alcohol withdrawal
as they became similarly expressed between alcohol-
abstinent AH and HDC. Interestingly, monocytes in
HDC up-regulated CD80 and CD86 expression with
alcohol abstinence, suggesting a subtle functional
impairment of monocytes in the absence of other obvi-
ous clinical symptoms induced by excessive alcohol
consumption.
At present, there are no effective medical interven-
tions for AH. Besides alcohol cessation, corticosteroids
are the current pharmacologic options to treat severe

 AH patients. As corticosteroids cause immunosup-
pression, AH patients receiving corticosteroids may be
at higher risk of infections and have poor treatment
outcomes.(4,5) Consistent with the lack of long-term
clinical benefits of steroid treatment, we did not find
additional immunological benefits in alcohol-abstinent
patients at follow-up. It should be noted that AH
patients treated with steroids had more severe diseases
than untreated patients at the study entry.
In conclusion, we found that HDC showed little
evidence of immune activation, whereas AH patients
had a highly dysregulated expression of multiple
immune markers. Abstinence from alcohol consump-
tion greatly, but not completely, reversed immunologi-
cal abnormalities; and steroid treatments did not
appear to have additional long-term immunological
benefits. Future network analysis of these and other
dysregulated immune markers involved in multiple
pathophysiological aspects of AH should shed light on
key immune mediators that are most responsive to dis-
ease severity/mortality, steroid treatment, and alcohol
abstinence(43) and provide clues for the development of
pharmacological therapies to ameliorate dysregulated
immune responses in AH patients.
