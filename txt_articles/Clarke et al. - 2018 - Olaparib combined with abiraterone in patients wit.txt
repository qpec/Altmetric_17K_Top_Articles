Research in Context 
Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed and the databases of the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology and European Society for Medical Oncology to identify journal publications 
and meeting abstracts published between January 1, 2012 and March 1, 2018, that 
included the search terms “poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase” or “PARP” and “inhibitor” 
or “inhibition” and “prostate cancer”. No language restrictions were used in our 
search. Olaparib is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that is approved 
in ovarian and breast cancer indications. Other PARP inhibitors in clinical 
development include niraparib, pamiparib, rucaparib, talazoparib, and veliparib. 
Abiraterone is an androgen synthesis inhibitor and standard of care treatment for 
castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. In a previous study, the efficacy of 
olaparib monotherapy in advanced prostate cancer patients was shown to be almost 
exclusively limited to patients with a homologous recombination repair mutation. A 
phase 2 trial of veliparib in combination with abiraterone reported no significant 
efficacy benefit for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated 
with the combination compared with abiraterone alone.  
Added value of this study 
We conducted a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of olaparib plus 
abiraterone compared with abiraterone alone in metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer patients who had previously received docetaxel. To our knowledge, 
our data are the first to show a significant improvement in radiologic progression-free 
survival (rPFS) for men treated with the combination of a PARP inhibitor and 
 4 
androgen synthesis inhibitor. In addition, and in contrast to results seen previously 
with olaparib monotherapy in this indication, the rPFS benefit was observed for 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients in the olaparib plus 
abiraterone arm, who were not required to have a homologous recombination repair 
mutation; an effect that has not previously been reported. In our study, more patients 
treated with olaparib and abiraterone experienced grade ≥3 or serious adverse 
events than those treated with abiraterone alone; however, the increased duration of 
exposure in the combination arm suggests that increased tolerability risk may be 
offset by the observed efficacy benefit. No detriment to health-related quality of life 
was observed in the combination arm compared with the comparator arm.  
Implications of all the available evidence 
The significant improvement in rPFS observed for metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer patients treated with olaparib plus abiraterone compared with 
abiraterone alone suggests that these patients, who were not selected based on 
biomarker criteria, may benefit from the combination treatment irrespective of 
homologous recombination repair mutation status. This result, which opens up the 
possibility of clinical benefit for a broader patient population, is consistent with 
preclinical data that indicate a synergy between olaparib and agents inhibiting 
androgen synthesis or function, potentially caused by PARP inhibition of androgen-
receptor-dependent transcription or creation of a ‘BRCA-like’ phenotype that is 
susceptible to PARP inhibition. Larger studies are needed to confirm our 
observations; however, our data suggest that the combination of olaparib and 
abiraterone has the potential to provide additional and practice-changing therapeutic 
options to men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Summary 
Background 
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with homologous 
recombination repair (HRR) mutations have shown greater response to the PARP 
inhibitor olaparib than patients without. Preclinical data suggest synergy between 
olaparib and androgen pathway inhibitors. We performed a phase 2 randomised 
double-blind study evaluating olaparib plus abiraterone in mCRPC patients, 
regardless of HRR mutation status. 
Methods 
Eligible mCRPC patients had previously received docetaxel (but no second 
generation antihormonal agents, e.g. abiraterone or enzalutamide), and were 
candidates for abiraterone treatment. There was no requirement for patients in our 
trial to have a HRR mutation. Patients were randomised 1:1 to oral olaparib 300 mg 
bid (tablets; combination) or placebo (comparator); all patients received oral 
abiraterone 
1000 mg 
od 
alongside 
prednisone/prednisolone 
5 
mg 
bid. 
Randomisation was carried out using a computer-generated randomisation scheme 
and interactive voice/web response system and patients and investigators were 
blinded to assigned treatment by use of individual treatment Kit ID numbers. No 
stratification factors were used. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed 
radiologic progression-free survival (rPFS; RECIST v1·1, PCWG-2). Efficacy 
endpoints were assessed on an intention-to-treat basis, and safety and tolerability 
were assessed in patients who received at least one dose of olaparib or placebo. 
The trial is ongoing, but no longer recruiting. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01972217. 
 6 
Findings  
142 patients were randomised (71 per arm), received treatment and were included in 
efficacy and safety analyses. A significant rPFS improvement was observed for 
combination- versus comparator-arm patients (median 13·8 vs 8·2 months; HR 0·65, 
95% CI 0·44–0·97, p=0·034). More combination-arm patients experienced grade ≥3 
adverse events (38/71 patients [54%] vs 20/71 [28%], including anaemia [n=15 vs 0], 
pneumonia [n=4 vs 3] and myocardial infarction [n=4 vs 0]) and serious adverse 
events (SAE; 24/71 [34%] vs 13/71 [18%], respectively), including cardiovascular 
events (7 SAEs vs 1). One fatal adverse event, pneumonitis, in the combination arm 
was thought to be causally related to study treatment. Median time to deterioration in 
quality of life (FACT-P) was 5·7 versus 6·0 months, respectively (HR 0·97 [0·68–
1·40], p=0·89). 
Interpretation 
Olaparib in combination with abiraterone provided clinical efficacy benefit for 
mCRPC patients compared with abiraterone alone. More SAEs were observed with 
the combination, but no QoL detriment was seen and together our data suggest that 
the combination of olaparib and abiraterone may have the potential to provide an 
additional clinical benefit to a broad population of mCRPC patients.

Introduction 
Prostate cancer is the fifth largest cause of cancer-related deaths for men 
worldwide.1 The standard of care for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC) includes taxane chemotherapy, such as docetaxel or cabazitaxel, second-
generation antihormonal agents, such as abiraterone or enzalutamide, which target 
the androgen-receptor pathway or radium-223. However, response is often short-
lived because patients develop tumour resistance, and improved therapeutic options 
are needed for men with mCRPC.2 
In a preliminary phase 2 study (NCT01682772, TOPARP-A), patients with mCRPC 
who were pretreated with chemotherapy (almost all also having previously received 
a second-generation antihormonal agent such as abiraterone or enzalutamide) were 
treated with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, olaparib. Patients 
whose tumours carried a homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutation (based 
on a 113-gene panel test) showed a markedly higher response rate than patients 
whose tumours lacked a HRR mutation.3 These clinical data are supported by 
preclinical studies that demonstrate the mechanism of action for olaparib, which 
traps PARP at sites of DNA damage, causing an accumulation of DNA double-strand 
breaks.4 Synthetic lethality is seen when PARP is trapped in HRR-deficient cells, 
which depend on low-fidelity pathways for repairing DNA double-strand breaks.5,6 
Preclinical data have suggested synergy between olaparib and agents affecting the 
androgen receptor pathway, regardless of HRR mutation status.7,8 Therefore, we 
performed a phase 2 randomised trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01972217) to assess 
the efficacy and tolerability of olaparib in combination with abiraterone compared 
 8 
with placebo plus abiraterone in patients with mCRPC, irrespective of their HRR 
mutation status.

Methods 
Study design and participants 
This two-part phase 2 trial was conducted at 41 sites in 11 European and North 
American countries, and comprised an open-label safety run-in (described in the 
Supplementary Appendix, page 2), followed by a randomised, double-blind phase. 
Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age and had documented evidence of 
mCRPC. Castration-resistant prostate cancer was defined as rising prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) levels or other signs of disease progression, despite androgen-
deprivation therapy and castrate levels of testosterone (≤50 ng/dL). Metastatic 
disease was defined as at least one metastatic lesion on bone scan, computed 
tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. There was no requirement for patients 
in our trial to have a HRR mutation. Patients had no more than two prior lines of 
chemotherapy, no previous exposure to second-generation antihormonal agents and 
all were candidates for abiraterone treatment. In addition, patients were required to 
have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2 
and a life expectancy ≥12 weeks. For the randomised phase, patients were required 
to have received prior treatment with docetaxel in the mCRPC setting, but response 
to this treatment was not necessary. Patients had normal organ, bone marrow and 
cardiac function at baseline and were excluded on this basis if they met any of the 
criteria listed in the Supplementary Appendix (page 3). Patients were excluded from 
the trial if they had had other malignancies within 5 years prior to trial entry; any 
evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases including hypertension or 
infection, or spinal cord compression or brain metastases (unless asymptomatic and 
stable). All patients provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was 
 10 
approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at all participating 
institutions. The trial was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Good 
Clinical Practice, and the AstraZeneca policy on bioethics.9 The trial is ongoing, but 
is no longer recruiting patients. No further analyses of the primary outcome measure 
are planned. The study protocol is available in the Supplementary Appendix (page 
10). 
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were enrolled by investigators and assigned 1:1 to a randomised treatment 
arm by an interactive voice/web response system using random numbers generated 
by the AstraZeneca Global Randomisation System. Stratification factors were not 
used during randomisation. Investigators contacted the centralised interactive 
voice/web response system by telephone or online for allocation of the randomised 
treatment Kit ID number, which were assigned sequentially to each patient as they 
became eligible. Assigned treatment was masked for patients, those giving the 
interventions, data collectors and data analysers. Those involved in data analysis 
remained blinded until the time of the primary analysis and all investigators and 
patients remained blinded until verification and closure of the study database, except 
for medical emergencies where appropriate patient management required 
knowledge of randomised treatment.  
Procedures 
In the combination arm, patients received oral olaparib (300 mg tablets; Lynparza, 
AstraZeneca, Cambridge, UK, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA) twice daily 
with doses taken approximately 12 hours apart, plus oral abiraterone (1000 mg; 
 11 
Zytiga, Janssen, Raritan, NJ, USA) taken once daily in the morning, or matching 
placebo plus abiraterone. The olaparib dose was based on the safety run-in results. 
In both arms, prednisone/prednisolone (5 mg) was administered orally twice daily 
alongside abiraterone, as indicated, with doses taken approximately 12 hours 
apart.10 Treatment was continued until disease progression or lack of clinical benefit 
(investigator-assessed). Olaparib or placebo dose interruptions of up to 14 days 
were permitted to manage any toxicities at the investigator’s discretion, and were 
required for treatment related adverse events of Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades 3 or 4. Treatment was reinitiated once adverse 
events resolved to grade 1 or less. Patients were considered for dose reduction, first 
to 250 mg bid and then 200 mg bid if the toxicity recurred. Interruptions or reductions 
of abiraterone or prednisone/prednisolone dose were not permitted. Patients could 
withdraw from the study voluntarily or be withdrawn due to severe protocol non-
compliance; patients who could not be reached following ≥3 unsuccessful contact 
attempts were considered lost to follow-up.  
Soft-tissue (CT or MRI) and bone scans were performed every 12 weeks until week 
72, then every 24 weeks until disease progression, death, or withdrawal of consent. 
Blood samples for assessment of circulating tumour cells were taken at baseline, 
week 4, week 12, and upon discontinuation of study treatment. Blood samples for 
assessment of PSA levels were taken every 4 weeks until week 12 and every 12 
weeks thereafter. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study treatment, 
and follow-up periods using the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE version 4·0 and 
included measurements of clinical chemistry and haematology (at baseline, every 4 
weeks until week 52 and every 12 weeks from week 60), vital signs (at baseline, 
 12 
every 4 weeks until week 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter) and recording of 
adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) (at baseline, every 4 weeks until 
week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was 
assessed every 4 weeks until week 12, then every 12 weeks using the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Prostate Cancer (FACT-P) questionnaire. A higher 
FACT-P score represented better HRQoL (range: 0–156). 
Plasma (mandatory), whole-blood (germline; optional), and archival tumour tissue 
(optional), samples were tested for deleterious or suspected deleterious (loss-of-
function) mutations in 15 HRR genes according to pre-specified American College of 
Medical Genetics and Genomics criteria.11 Tumour and whole-blood samples were 
tested first, and subsequently patients with no data (no material provided or technical 
test failure) were prioritised for plasma analyses (excluding the five patients with 
novel HRR mutations already identified by germline testing; Supplementary 
Appendix, page 4). 
Loss-of-function mutations were assessed in ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, 
CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and 
RAD54L by commercially available Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 
(CLIA) FoundationOne tumour assay at Foundation Medicine (Cambridge, MA, 
USA); ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51C, and 
RAD51D by commercially available germline CLIA assay at Color Genomics 
(Burlingame, CA, USA); and ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12, 
CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and 
RAD54L by research use only plasma assay at AstraZeneca. The plasma assay 
(circulating tumour DNA [ctDNA] next-generation sequencing analysis) was done on 
 13 
an Illumina NexSeq using 2x150 high throughput runs, at the AstraZeneca Genomics 
Laboratory in Cambridge, UK, which operates in accordance with Good Laboratory 
Practice principles. The assay is a 112 gene panel using IDT xGen capture probes 
that covers the full coding sequence of the HRR genes listed above. The targeted 
panel and unique molecular indices enrichment method were validated using 
commercial plasma samples harbouring somatic alterations at known allele 
frequencies. For the ctDNA analyses in this study, the average circulating free DNA 
input was 29 ng, the detection limit was 0.5% allele frequency, and the average 
depth after deduplication was 2900x. 
 
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint of the randomised phase was radiologic progression-free 
survival (rPFS) defined as time from randomisation to radiologic progression 
(investigator-assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
[RECIST] version 1·1 for soft-tissue disease or Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 
[PCWG-2] criteria for bone disease), or death. Exploratory rPFS subgroup analyses 
by HRR mutation status were predefined. Key secondary endpoints included safety 
and tolerability, time to second progression (PFS2; defined as time from 
randomisation to the investigator-assessed progression event [using RECIST 
version 1·1 or PCWG-2 criteria] following that used for the primary rPFS analysis, or 
death) and overall survival (OS; defined as time from randomisation to death, by any 
cause). Other secondary endpoints included radiologic objective response (ORR; 
RECIST v1·1, PCWG-2), soft-tissue response (RECIST v1·1), time to first and 
 14 
second subsequent anticancer therapy (TFST; TSST; defined as time from 
randomisation to the first or second subsequent therapy for prostate cancer following 
discontinuation of olaparib/placebo, or death), confirmed prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) response (reduction of ≥50% from baseline, confirmed at the next assessment 
≥4 weeks later), circulating tumour cell (CTC) conversion (change from ≥5 
cells/7·5 mL at baseline to <5 cells/7·5 mL post-baseline), and HRQoL (a 
deterioration event was defined as a decrease of ≥6 points in baseline FACT-P 
score).  
 
Statistical analyses 
The study was designed to include approximately 140 patients in the randomised 
phase to give 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference between 
treatment arms at the one-sided 10% level after 100 progression events, assuming a 
true hazard ratio (HR) of 0·65. A hierarchical multiple-testing strategy was 
prespecified for the primary analysis of rPFS and the key secondary endpoints PFS2 
and OS. If statistical significance was shown for rPFS, PFS2 was then compared 
between arms. If the null hypothesis of no difference between arms was rejected for 
PFS2, OS was tested as part of the multiple-testing procedure; however, all planned 
analyses were performed irrespective of the outcome of the multiple testing strategy. 
Efficacy data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, and safety and tolerability 
were assessed in patients who received at least one dose of olaparib or placebo. 
ORR and soft-tissue response rate were assessed in patients with measurable 
disease at baseline, and CTC-conversion rate and PSA response rate were 
 15 
assessed in patients with baseline CTC ≥5 and with a baseline PSA result, 
respectively. For the primary endpoint, rPFS, patients whose disease had not 
progressed or had progressed after two or more missed visits were censored at their 
last evaluable tumour assessment. HRs and confidence intervals (CI) were derived 
using a log-rank test with ties handled using the Breslow method; a HR less than one 
favoured olaparib. Time-to-event endpoints were measured from randomisation and 
medians were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique, with all analyses 
performed using SAS version 9·4. Reported p values are two-sided, and analyses 
with an observed two-sided p value less than 0·05 met the threshold for a statistically 
significant difference in clinical benefit between arms. Any p values determined 
outside the multiple testing strategy should be considered nominal. 
Predefined exploratory subgroup analyses were performed for patients with a HRR 
mutation, wild-type HRR, and partially characterised HRR status. Patients with a 
qualifying loss of function mutation in any sample (tumour, plasma or whole-blood) 
were classified as having a HRR mutation; patients for whom all test results were 
negative were classified as HRR wild-type, as long as their results included a valid 
tumour test; all other patients were classified as HRR partially characterised, 
including those whose plasma and whole-blood samples both tested negative for 
HRR mutations, but for whom no valid tumour test result was available. Sensitivity 
analyses of rPFS, performed for attrition and evaluation-time bias, were prespecified 
and are described in the Supplementary Appendix (page 3). A logistic regression 
model including treatment as a factor variable was used to analyse ORR; no other 
variables were included in this model.  
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01972217.

Role of funding source 
The study was designed in collaboration between the first author and sponsor, 
AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca was responsible for overseeing data collection, analysis 
and interpretation. Merck & Co., Inc., who are developing olaparib in collaboration 
with AstraZeneca, provided input into data interpretation. All authors had access to 
the raw data and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and analyses 
and the fidelity of the study to the protocol. The manuscript was written with medical 
writing support, funded by AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc., with critical review 
and input from the authors. The decision to submit the manuscript for publication 
was made by all authors and the sponsor. The corresponding author had full access 
to all of the data and the final responsibility to submit for publication.

Results 
Patients 
The safety run-in is described in the Supplementary Appendix (page 3). Patients 
were enrolled in the randomised phase between November 25, 2014 and July 14, 
2015. One hundred and forty-two patients were randomised; all 71 patients, 
assigned to the combination arm, were treated with olaparib plus abiraterone and all 
71, assigned to the comparator arm, received placebo plus abiraterone (Figure 1). 
All 71 patients in each arm were included in the efficacy and safety analysis sets. It 
was prespecified that the primary data cut-off (September 22, 2017) would take 
place after 100 rPFS events had occurred. At this point, seven (10%) of 71 patients 
were still receiving olaparib plus abiraterone, and eight (11%) of 71 were still 
receiving placebo plus abiraterone. Forty-three (61%) of 71 patients in the 
combination had died, 33 (46%) due to mCRPC, four (6%) due to adverse events, 
five (7%) for reasons unrelated to adverse events or the disease under investigation 
and one (1%) due to other reasons. Forty-five (63%) of 71 patients in the 
combination had died, 37 (52%) due to mCRPC, one (1%) due to an adverse event 
and seven (10%) for reasons unrelated to adverse events or the disease under 
investigation. 
For the randomised phase, baseline characteristics are reported in Table 1. 
Combination-arm patients had higher median PSA concentration (86 μg/L [IQR 23–
194] vs 47 [21–199] μg/L). Sixty-eight (48%) of 142 patients provided prostate 
tumour samples, 38 (56%) of which provided a valid HRR mutation test result. A 
breakdown of tumour, germline and plasma test results is shown in the 
 18 
Supplementary Appendix (page 5). Overall, 21 (15%) of 142 patients had confirmed 
or suspected deleterious HRR mutations (combination arm: 3 ATM, 2 BRCA2, 2 
CDK12, 2 CHEK2, 1 BRIP1 and 1 CHEK1; comparator arm: 4 ATM, 4 BRCA2, 1 
CDK12 and 1 PALB2; Supplementary Appendix, page 6), and 35 (25%) were 
classified as HRR wild-type based on all their HRR mutation test results, including a 
tumour test, being negative. The remaining 86 (61%) patients had partially 
characterised HRR status; of these, 58 patients (67%) were HRR wild-type by 
plasma and germline testing, 17 patients (20%) were HRR wild-type by plasma 
testing only, five patients (6%) were HRR wild-type by germline testing only and 6 
patients (7%) had no valid tumour, plasma or germline test result.  
Of the 21 patients with a HRR mutation, 10 (48%) were identified who had results 
from only one sample type; one (5%), five (24%) and four (19%) by tumour, germline 
and plasma testing, respectively. In the 25 patients with both tumour and germline 
data there were two cases of HRR mutations (8%); both were germline variants that 
were detected by both assays. In the 69 patients with both germline and plasma 
results there were nine HRR mutation cases (13%); all were likely somatic, and two 
(22% of 9) were from genes not covered by Color Genomics’ germline test (CDK12 
and CHEK1). There were no HRR mutation cases detected by plasma or tumour in 
the three cases (2% of 142) where a valid result was available for both sample types. 
It should be noted that plasma testing was prioritised for patients who did not provide 
a tumour sample, or who had no valid tumour test result due to technical failure 
(excluding the five patients with novel HRR mutations already identified by germline 
testing; Supplementary Appendix, page 4). Hence, concordance comparisons with 
 19 
plasma testing results are intrinsically biased; however, we plan to address this in a 
future publication.  
Efficacy 
At the primary analysis, median follow up for rPFS was 15·9 months (IQR 8·1–25·5) 
in the combination arm compared with 24·5 months (8·1–27·6) in the comparator 
arm. Forty-six of 71 combination-arm patients (65%) and 54 of 71 comparator-arm 
patients (76%) had had a rPFS event (100 [70%] of 142 overall). In the combination 
arm, 24 (52%) of these 46 patients had soft-tissue progression only, 8 (17%) bone 
progression only, 1 (2%) both soft-tissue and bone progression, and 13 (28%) died 
ahead of progression (comparator arm: 28 [52%] of 54 patients, 14 [26%], 2 [4%] 
and 10 [19%], respectively). There was a statistically significant improvement in 
rPFS in the combination versus comparator arm (median 13·8 months [95% CI 
10·8–20·4] vs 8·2 months [5·5–9·7]; HR 0·65, 95% CI 0·44–0·97, p=0·034; Figure 
2a). Sensitivity analyses for attrition and evaluation-time bias were consistent with 
the primary analysis (reported in the Supplementary Appendix, page 6). 
A predefined exploratory subgroup analysis of rPFS by HRR mutation status was 
performed. For the 21 patients with HRR mutations, median rPFS was 17·8 months 
(95% CI 2·9–27·6) versus 6·5 months (2·7–non-calculable) in the combination 
versus comparator arm (Figure 2b). Eight (73%) of 11 combination arm patients had 
experienced a rPFS event compared with 7 (70%) of 10 comparator-arm patients. 
For the 35 patients with wild-type HRR, median rPFS was 15·0 months (95% CI 5·4–
non-calculable) versus 9·7 months (2·9–17·5), respectively (Figure 2c). Eight (53%) 
of 15 combination arm patients had experienced a rPFS event compared with 17 
 20 
(85%) of 20 comparator arm patients. For the 86 patients with partially characterised 
HRR status, median rPFS was 13·1 months (95% CI 8·1–22·4) versus 6·4 months 
(5·3–8·2), respectively (Figure 2d). Thirty (67%) of 45 combination arm patients had 
experienced a rPFS event compared with 30 (73%) of 41 comparator arm patients. 
By the data cut-off, 82 patients (58% of 142) had experienced a second progression 
event or died; 37 (52%) of 71 patients in the combination arm compared with 45 
(63%) of 71 patients in the comparator arm. Median PFS2 was 23·3 months (95% CI 
17·4–non-calculable) in the combination arm, compared with 18·5 months (16·1–
23·8) in the comparator arm, but statistical significance was not met (Figure 3a). 
Eighty-eight OS events (62% of 142 patients) had occurred by the data cut-off, with 
43 (61%) and 45 (63%) of 71 patients having died in the combination and 
comparator arms, respectively. Median OS was 22·7 months (95% CI 17·4–29·4) for 
combination-arm patients, compared with 20·9 months (17·6–26·3) for comparator-
arm patients, but there was no significant difference between arms (Figure 3b). 
During the study, post-progression anticancer therapy was received by fewer 
patients in the combination (20 [28%] of 71) than in the comparator arm (29 [41%] of 
71); subsequent anticancer therapies received are reported in the Supplementary 
Appendix (page 7). 
Thirty-three of 71 combination-arm patients (46%) and 38 of 71 comparator-arm 
patients (54%) had measurable disease at baseline. There was no significant 
difference in overall ORR between arms (27% [9 patients, combination] vs 32% [12 
patients, comparator]; odds ratio 0·81, 95% CI 0·28–2·26, nominal p=0·62). There 
were no complete responses; more patients in the combination than comparator arm 
had stable disease as a best response (16 [48%] of 33 vs 8 [21%] of 38), and fewer 
 21 
patients had progressive disease as a best response (7 [21%] of 33 vs 18 [47%] of 
38). Median duration of response was 17·8 months in the combination arm 
(interquartile range [IQR] 8·3–non-calculable) and 12·1 months in the comparator 
arm (IQR 6·6–non-calculable). CTC-conversion rate was similar in the combination 
(15 [50%] of 30 patients with baseline CTC ≥5) and comparator arms (13 [46%] of 
28), as was confirmed PSA response (34 [48%] of 71 patients with a baseline PSA 
result in the combination arm compared with 30 [42%] of 71 in the comparator arm). 
Soft-tissue responses and TFST and TSST analyses are reported in the 
Supplementary Appendix (pages 6–7). 
Health-related quality of life 
Sixty (85%) of 71 combination-arm patients experienced deterioration in HRQoL 
compared with 57 (80%) of 71 comparator-arm patients; median times to 
deterioration were 5·7 months (95% CI 2·8–11·2) and 6·0 months (1·9–11·2), 
respectively (HR 0·97, 95% CI 0·68–1·40, nominal p=0·89).  
Safety and tolerability 
Median treatment duration was longer in the combination arm compared with the 
comparator arm: 309 days (IQR 145–457) for olaparib compared with 253 days 
(113–421) for placebo, and for abiraterone 338 days (169–588) compared with 253 
days (130–429), respectively. Most adverse events in the combination arm were 
grade 1 or 2 (Table 2). More patients experienced grade ≥3 adverse events in the 
combination versus the comparator arm (38 [54%] of 71 vs 20 [28%] of 71). Fifteen 
(21%) of the 71 combination-arm patients had grade ≥3 adverse events of anaemia, 
compared with none in the comparator arm. Grade ≥3 adverse events of 
 22 
lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were each experienced by one 
(1%) combination-arm patient, compared with none in the comparator arm. 
SAEs were reported by 24 (34%) of 71 combination-arm patients and 13 (18%) of 71 
comparator-arm patients. Seven (10%) of 71 patients in the combination arm had 
SAEs that were causally related to study treatment (anaemia, n=3; febrile 
neutropenia, n=1; pneumonitis, n=1; vomiting, n=1; general physical health 
deterioration, n=1), compared with 1 (1%) of 71 patients in the comparator arm 
(gastroenteritis, n=1). Seven combination-arm patients (10%), aged 66–88 years, 
had serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, n=4; fatal cardiac failure, 
n=1; chronic cardiac failure, n=1; fatal ischaemic stroke, n=1), compared with one 
comparator-arm patient (1%; thrombotic stroke). The range of time to onset of 
serious cardiovascular events was 3–29 months in the combination arm. At baseline, 
44 of 71 combination-arm patients (62%) and 40 of 71 comparator-arm patients 
(56%) had risk factors for cardiovascular events. 
Pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease was reported by two (3%) of 71 combination-
arm patients and one (1%) of 71 comparator-arm patients. Fatal adverse events 
were experienced by four (6%) of 71 combination-arm patients (pneumonitis, 
ischaemic stroke, cardiac failure, mediastinitis) and one (1%) comparator-arm patient 
(chronic pyelonephritis); of these, only pneumonitis was thought by the investigator 
to be causally related to study treatment (olaparib). 
More patients in the combination than the comparator arm had dose interruptions 
and dose reductions caused by adverse events (24 [34%] vs 9 [13%] and 13 [18%] 
vs 0 of 71 patients in each arm, respectively; details are shown in the Supplementary 
 23 
Appendix, page 8). Twenty-one of 71 combination-arm patients (30%) and seven of 
71 comparator-arm patients (10%) experienced adverse events that led to treatment 
discontinuation. Adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation in more than 
one combination-arm patient were anaemia (4 [6%] of 71 vs 0 [comparator arm]), 
nausea (3 [4%] of 71 vs 0), muscular weakness (2 [3%] of 71 vs 0), and myocardial 
infarction (2 [3%] of 71 vs 0). 
Pharmacokinetics 
No obvious drug–drug interaction was detected between olaparib and abiraterone. 
However, the number of individuals in which pharmacokinetic data were determined 
was small. Full details are reported in the Supplementary Appendix (pages 8–9).

Discussion 
In this randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of olaparib and abiraterone 
compared with abiraterone alone, a significant rPFS benefit was observed with the 
combination for mCRPC patients, who were not subject to any biomarker selection 
criteria. While more adverse events were experienced by patients in the combination 
arm, median treatment duration was longer for these patients and no detriment to 
HRQoL was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a PARP inhibitor to 
show a clinical benefit when combined with abiraterone for patients with mCRPC 
who have previously received docetaxel. We observed a statistically significant 
improvement in rPFS for patients treated with the combination (HR 0·65; difference 
in median rPFS: 5·6 months), with a 35% decrease in the risk of disease progression 
or death compared to patients in the comparator arm. We note that median rPFS in 
our comparator arm (8.2 months) was longer than the 5.6 months observed in the 
active arm of a Phase III trial (COU-AA-301) that assessed abiraterone compared 
with placebo in a similar patient population.2 One possible explanation for this 
difference in median rPFS in the abiraterone arm is the difference in tumour load; 
COU-AA-301 showed a higher baseline median PSA than that seen in our study. 
Another potential cause is the improvement in treatment methods and increased 
access to second and third line interventions for the patients in our study. Our 
primary endpoint was predicated on preclinical data, showing synergy between 
olaparib and agents affecting the androgen receptor pathway regardless of HRR 
mutation status; therefore, HRR mutation status was not used as a stratification 
factor at randomisation.7,8 The study was not powered for subgroup analyses, and 
HRR mutation status was not known for all patients. However, with rPFS results 
 25 
indicative of similar benefit with the combination between HRR subgroups, our data 
suggest that the combination of olaparib and abiraterone may have resulted in rPFS 
benefit for patients regardless of HRR mutation status. Whilst 61% of patients were 
classified as having partially characterised HRR mutation status by our prespecified 
criteria, 69% of these patients tested negative for HRR mutations by both plasma 
and germline testing, although this could not be confirmed by tumour testing. Studies 
have shown the prevalence of HRR mutations in metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer patients to be up to around 30%.3,12,13 In our trial, the prevalence of 
detected HRR mutation was 15% (21/142; Supplementary Appendix, page 5). Within 
the cohort tested at Color Genomics, 93 out of 102 patients also had a tumour or 
plasma result, and seven out of the 16 detected mutations were germline, in line with 
recently published data.3,12,13 All samples in our study were from prostate tumours, 
however a matched study of primary and metastatic tumour samples from mCRPC 
patients found only a limited number of additional HRR mutations in metastatic 
samples,14 suggesting the type of sample used in our study is likely to have had little 
impact on the prevalence of detected HRR mutations. Additionally, BRCA2 
mutations have been associated with worse prognosis in mCRPC, which may 
explain the increased prevalence.15,16 A limitation of our study is the number of 
patients with a HRR mutation that may remain in the group of 86 patients defined as 
HRR partially characterised. Based on the 30% prevalence from recent studies, one 
would project as many as 13 patients with a HRR mutation in the HRR partially 
characterised group, to give a total of 31 patients (30%) with a mutation in the group 
of 104 with no valid tumour test result. However, the actual number is likely to be 
much lower than this, given that 63 out of 86 HRR partially characterised patients did 
not have a germline HRR mutation by Color Genomics testing, and 75 out of 86 
 26 
patients did not have a detectable mutation in their plasma (which would be 
expected, at a minimum, to detect all germline variants and point mutations in 
patients whose tumours shed sufficient ctDNA). Hence, we would expect that a 
maximum of 13 (15%) patients in the HRR partially characterised group have HRR 
mutations, but that the number is likely to be much lower and that this subgroup is 
unlikely to be driving the treatment effect observed in this HRR partially 
characterised subgroup or in the study as a whole. It has been suggested that 
abiraterone (irrespective of PARP inhibitor use) may be more efficacious in patients 
with a HRR mutation; however, in our study the number of patients with a known 
HRR mutation is similar between arms, meaning any impact of HRR mutation status 
on abiraterone efficacy is also likely to be well balanced. 
In the TOPARP-A study, the efficacy of olaparib monotherapy in mCRPC patients 
appeared to be almost completely limited to those with HRR mutations, whereas our 
data suggest that synergy between olaparib and abiraterone may result in clinical 
benefit for patients unselected by HRR mutation status.3 Preclinical studies suggest 
a dual mode of synergy. Firstly, PARP is involved in androgen-receptor-dependent 
transcription and PARP inhibition impairs this process.8 Secondly, the androgen 
receptor regulates transcription of DNA repair genes; androgen depletion impairs 
HRR, which may create a ‘BRCAness’ phenotype that is susceptible to PARP 
inhibition.17–19 Further work is required to elucidate the mechanism further. However, 
a broad patient population may derive benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment through 
combination with ‘BRCAness’-inducing agents. In a similarly-sized phase 2 study 
(n=148) testing a different PARP inhibitor, veliparib, in combination with abiraterone 
compared with abiraterone alone, no significant efficacy benefit was observed for 
 27 
mCRPC patients including those with DNA damage repair defects.12 However, these 
results are consistent with preclinical data that show veliparib to have weaker PARP 
trapping activity than olaparib.20 
Although no statistically significant difference in PFS2 or OS was seen between 
arms, the study was underpowered for these analyses. The OS analysis may also 
have been confounded by the higher proportion of comparator-arm patients who 
received post-progression anticancer therapies, as well as some notable differences 
between arms in baseline prognostic factors such as age, ECOG status and PSA 
level, which were more favourable in the comparator arm; because this was a 
relatively small phase 2 trial, no stratification factors were used during randomisation. 
Despite there being no significant difference between arms, the magnitude and 
direction of the PFS2 data were consistent with the primary rPFS analysis, and the 
difference in median OS between arms (1·8 months) is similar to that reported for 
available second-line therapies.21 However, the number of patients in these analyses 
is too small to draw conclusions and further studies are needed to determine 
whether the observed rPFS benefit translates into improved OS. Overall response, 
confirmed PSA response and CTC-conversion rates were similar in both arms, which 
might be a result of the potency of abiraterone and its cytostatic mode of action.2,22 
The observed difference in rPFS between arms is therefore likely to be due to an 
increase in the proportion of patients with stable disease and an increased duration 
of response in the combination arm, rather than the result of an increased number of 
complete responders. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action for 
the combination, discussed above, in which a ‘BRCAness’ phenotype is only created 
in patients for whom abiraterone is efficacious.  
 28 
The most frequent adverse events in combination-arm patients were nausea and 
anaemia. More grade ≥3 adverse events, SAEs, and other clinically significant 
adverse events, including cardiovascular events, were reported in the combination 
arm compared with the comparator arm. No difference in risk factors for 
cardiovascular events was seen between arms at baseline. Additionally, more 
combination-arm 
patients 
experienced 
dose 
modification 
or 
treatment 
discontinuation because of an adverse event; patients could discontinue olaparib or 
abiraterone only, resulting in a longer median duration of treatment for abiraterone 
than olaparib in this arm. However, the longer duration of treatment in the 
combination arm suggests any risk of decreased tolerability may be offset by the 
additional efficacy benefit received and the increase in rPFS with the combination 
was observed despite more treatment discontinuations due to adverse events. There 
was no detriment to HRQoL reported in the combination arm relative to the 
comparator arm. This lack of difference in HRQoL between arms is not unexpected 
due to the additional disease burden experienced by patients in the comparator arm 
and the natural history of the disease at this late stage. 
Our study is limited by the number of patients enrolled, and larger trials are needed 
to confirm and extend our observations. It should also be noted that patients who 
have received docetaxel, but no second-generation antihormonal agents, might be 
increasingly rare, making recruitment and appropriate statistical power in this setting 
a challenge and increasing the importance of assessing this combination in other 
mCRPC settings. Assessing the impact of prior docetaxel treatment on the efficacy 
of olaparib and abiraterone will be an important area for future research and, as 
recent studies have shown significant increases in OS for hormone-therapy- or 
 29 
chemotherapy-naïve patients treated with abiraterone, testing the combination of 
PARP inhibitor and abiraterone in pre-chemotherapy settings may be of particular 
interest.23,24 An ongoing phase 2 study (NCT03012321) in the pre-chemotherapy 
mCRPC setting is evaluating olaparib versus abiraterone versus olaparib combined 
with abiraterone in patients with DNA repair defects.25 Olaparib is also currently 
being studied as monotherapy in a phase III trial (NCT02987543) of mCRPC patients 
with a HRR mutation who have previously received treatment with an antihormonal 
agent.26 Our results are encouraging for the future development of PARP inhibitor–
antihormonal agent combinations and open up the possibility of larger trials being 
run in mCRPC patients, irrespective of HRR mutation status.  
In conclusion, our data provide evidence of clinical benefit, worthy of further study, 
for men with mCRPC who received olaparib in combination with abiraterone 
compared with abiraterone alone, and indicate the potential of the combination to 
benefit patients unselected by HRR mutation status.
