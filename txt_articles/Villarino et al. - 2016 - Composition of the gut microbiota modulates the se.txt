Plasmodium infections result in clinical presentations that range
from asymptomatic to severe malaria, resulting in ∼1 million
deaths annually. Despite this toll on humanity, the factors that
determine disease severity remain poorly understood. Here, we
show that the gut microbiota of mice influences the pathogenesis
of malaria. Genetically similar mice from different commercial ven-
dors, which exhibited differences in their gut bacterial community,
had significant differences in parasite burden and mortality after
infection with multiple Plasmodium species. Germfree mice that
received cecal content transplants from “resistant” or “suscepti-
ble” mice had low and high parasite burdens, respectively, dem-
onstrating the gut microbiota shaped the severity of malaria. Among
differences in the gut flora were increased abundances of Lacto-
bacillus and Bifidobacterium in resistant mice. Susceptible mice
treated with antibiotics followed by yogurt made from these bac-
terial genera displayed a decreased parasite burden. Consistent
with differences in parasite burden, resistant mice exhibited an el-
evated humoral immune response compared with susceptible mice.
Collectively, these results identify the composition of the gut micro-
biota as a previously unidentified risk factor for severe malaria and
modulation of the gut microbiota (e.g., probiotics) as a potential
treatment to decrease parasite burden.

nfection by Plasmodium species remain a global health burden
causing over 200 million cases of malaria and around 1 million
deaths annually, with the vast majority of fatalities being children
under the age of 5 y living in sub-Saharan Africa (1). Many
Plasmodium infections are either asymptomatic or cause only
mild malaria. However, some infections progress to severe
malaria that most often manifests as impaired consciousness
(cerebral malaria), respiratory distress, and severe anemia (2).
The best correlate of disease severity following Plasmodium
falciparum infection in humans is parasite density (3, 4).
The gut microbiota has an impact on multiple facets of host
physiology (5), including shaping susceptibility to numerous diseases
(6–14). The effects of the gut microbiota on the host are strongly
influenced by the collective composition of the bacterial populations
(15), and commensal florae are known to affect local pathogen
burdens and host immunity (16–18). In addition to influencing local
gut immunity, the gut microbiome affects host immunity to extra-
gastrointestinal tract viral infections (19).
Recent studies also support that the gut microbiome modulates
Plasmodium infections in humans. Anti–α-gal Abs, induced by the
gut pathobiont Escherichia coli O86:B7, cross-react with sporozoites
from human and rodent Plasmodium species that impair trans-
mission of the parasite between the vector and vertebrate host;
however, this cross-reactive immunity did not affect blood stage
parasite burden (20). Additionally, the stool bacteria composition of
Malian children correlated prospectively with risk of P. falciparum
infection, but not progression to febrile malaria (21). Importantly, it
remains unclear whether the gut microbiome also contributes to the
development of severe malaria. Using the murine model of malaria,
these data demonstrate that the gut microbiome affects blood stage
parasite burden and the subsequent severity of malaria.
Results
Mice from Different Vendors Exhibit Differential Susceptibility to
Malaria. Genetically similar inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6)
maintained by different vendors [Jackson Laboratory (Jax) and
Taconic (Tac)] have differences in their gut bacterial communities
(22, 23). To determine whether these differences had any effect on
Plasmodium infections, C57BL/6 mice from Jax, Tac, National
Cancer Institute/Charles River (NCI), and Harlan (Har) were
infected with Plasmodium yoelii. Following infection, profound
differences in parasitemia (the fraction of RBCs infected with
P. yoelii) were observed between the four groups of mice (Fig. 1 A
and B). Whereas resistant mice (Jax and Tac) exhibited a maxi-
mum of ∼10% parasitemia, they had no signs of morbidity (weight
loss) or mortality, which was in contrast to the substantial weight
loss and mortality observed in susceptible mice (NCI and Har),
where parasitemia was >60% (Fig. 1 C and D). Moreover, NCI
and Har mice exhibited more profound and longer lasting anemia
Significance
Plasmodium infections cause >200 million cases of malaria and ∼1
million deaths annually. Although these infections result in disease
states that range from asymptomatic to life-threatening, factors
that contribute to disease severity remain poorly defined. This re-
port demonstrates that the assemblage of microbes in the gut can
modulate the severity of malaria. Mice from different vendors with
differences in their gut microbiome showed significant differences
in pathology after infection with Plasmodium. Among the bacterial
populations that were different between “resistant” and “suscep-
tible” mice were Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and treatment
of mice with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium resulted in
decreased Plasmodium burden. These results identify both a
previously unidentified risk factor for severe malaria and a
potential new avenue of treatment.

 (loss of RBCs per milliliter) compared with Jax and Tac mice (SI
Appendix, Fig. 1A). Additionally, when the total number of RBCs
per milliliter was used to derive total pathogen burden, similarities
were noted between the parasite burden as detected by para-
sitemia or parasitized RBCs (pRBCs) per milliliter of blood (SI
Appendix, Fig. 1 B–E). Of note, mice infected with different doses
of P. yoelii pRBCs showed similar parasitemia kinetics between the
different doses and susceptibility to infection (SI Appendix, Fig. 2),
suggesting mice from different vendors are differentially susceptible
to progression to severe malaria but not to blood stage infection.
To determine the broader applicability of these data, another
mouse strain and two Plasmodium species were tested. BALB/c
mice from Jax, Tac, Charles River (CR), and Har were infected
with P. yoelii. Mice were purchased from CR in lieu of NCI. Of
note, C57BL/6 mice purchased from CR exhibit similar para-
sitemia and morbidity as NCI mice following infection with P. yoelii
(SI Appendix, Fig. 3). Consistent with P. yoelii infections in C57BL/6
mice (SI Appendix, Fig. 3), BALB/c mice from Jax and Tac exhibit
reduced P. yoelii parasitemia compared with mice from CR and
Har (SI Appendix, Fig. 4 A and B). Furthermore, C57BL/6 mice
from Jax and Tac exhibited reduced parasitemia compared with
mice from CR and Har following Plasmodium chabaudi infection
(SI Appendix, Fig. 4 C and D). Finally, we assessed the devel-
opment of experimental cerebral malaria in C57BL/6 mice in-
fected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Jax and Tac mice
trended toward reduced parasitemia compared with NCI and
Har mice at early time points; moreover, there was a significant
(P = 0.04) difference in survival between these groups of mice
(SI Appendix, Fig. 4 E and F). In sum, these data indicate the
severity of malaria was dependent on the source of mice.
Diet is a strong modulator of organismal health as well as the gut
microbiome and its function (24). To determine whether the diet
could shape the severity of malaria, Jax and NCI mice were fed one
of two commercially available rodent diets, either NIH-31 (used in
Fig. 1 A–D) or Teklad 22/5. Parasitemia in NCI mice was unaffected;
however, Jax mice had high levels of parasitemia when fed Teklad
22/5 (Fig. 1 E and F). Consistent with the parasitemia data, Jax mice
fed Teklad 22/5 also exhibited substantial weight loss and elevated
mortality compared with Jax mice fed NIH-31 (Fig. 1 G and H).
Because these diets had no effect on parasite burden in NCI mice,
the changes in parasitemia in Jax mice were unlikely due to a direct
effect of these diets on the parasite burden. Moreover, high parasite
burdens in NCI mice fed NIH-31 suggest this diet supported the
proliferative expansion of P. yoelii. When Jax and NCI mice were
placed on the reciprocal vendor-specific diet and then infected with
P. yoelii, we noted a modest increase in parasite burden in Jax mice
fed the NCI in-house diet but no effect of the Jax in-house diet on
NCI mice (SI Appendix, Fig. 5). Collectively, these datasets led to the
hypothesis that the gut microbiota influenced Plasmodium infections.
Gut Bacterial Community Structure and Function Are Different in
Resistant and Susceptible Mice. To test directly for differences in
the gut microbiome, sections of the gastrointestinal tract from re-
sistant (Jax and Tac) and susceptible (NCI and Har) mice were
collected and the bacterial communities were characterized using
16S rRNA gene analysis (SI Appendix, Table 1). There was a high
degree of similarity between the microbial community assemblages
found within the cecum and colon of mice from the same vendor
(SI Appendix, Fig. 6A), whereas there were clear differences be-
tween the microbial communities of these regions compared with
the distal half of the small intestine in mice from the same vendor.
Moreover, significant differences between mice from all vendors
were apparent in the nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis
of population structure within the cecum, with the susceptible NCI
and Har libraries showing a comparative overlap with each other
yet distinct differences compared with the resistant Jax and Tac
communities (SI Appendix, Fig. 6B). Analysis of the cecal bacterial
communities at the family level revealed substantial differences,
with Clostridiaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and
Peptostreptococcaceae (members of the Firmicutes phylum)
being proportionally more abundant in resistant (Jax and Tac)
mice, whereas Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae (members of
Bacteroidetes phylum) and Sutterellaceae (member of Proteo-
bacteria phylum) were proportionally more abundant in susceptible
(NCI and Har) mice (Fig. 2 A and B). Finally, dietary changes are
capable of inducing significant changes in the gut microbiome (25)
that reach steady state within 3–4 d in mice (26). Consistent with
these reports, we observed defined changes in the gut bacterial

 communities in Jax mice fed Teklad 22/5 or NIH-31 (SI Appendix,
Figs. 7 and 8). In Jax mice fed the Teklad diet, there was a noted
decrease in Peptostreptococcaceae below the levels observed in
either Jax or Tac mice, resulting in an increased similarity to the
susceptible NCI and Har mice (SI Appendix, Fig. 7C). These
changes coincide with a shift in the severity of malaria between
these two groups of mice (Fig. 1 E–H).
Consistent with changes in the gut bacterial community, analysis
of metabolites in the small intestine, cecum, and plasma of Jax and
NCI mice revealed differential expression between each tissue
(SI Appendix, Fig. 9A). An F test of partial least squares discrimi-
nant analysis (27) used to probe variation between metabolite
profiles in Jax and NCI mice on a per tissue basis confirmed
that the means of the variate-1 (component 1), which differenti-
ated Jax from NCI mice in all tissues, were significantly different
(P ≤ 0.0003, P ≤ 0.0001, P ≤ 0.0001) for the small intestine, cecum,
and plasma, respectively, (SI Appendix, Fig. 9 B–D and Table 2).
Several metabolites exhibited large (≥1.5 fold) and statistically
significant (P ≤ 0.1) differences between Jax and NCI mice, with the
top 25% of metabolites associated with distinct metabolic pathways
(SI Appendix, Fig. 9 E and F and Tables 3–5). Therefore, differences
in the gut bacterial populations and metabolites support the hy-
pothesis that the severity of malaria was modulated by differences
in gut bacterial communities.
Differences in the Gut Microbiome Shape Susceptibility to Malaria.
To test this hypothesis directly, genetically identical germfree (GF)
C57BL/6 mice received cecal content transplants from either Jax or
NCI mice. Of note, GF C57BL/6J mice exhibited no difference in
parasitemia compared with conventional C57BL/6J mice following
infection with P. yoelii nigeriensis (28). Sequence analyses demon-
strated the bacterial communities in colonized, GF mice reflected
the bacterial communities of the donor communities and were
different from the communities in GF mice exposed to only envi-
ronmental microbes (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, there was only a slight
decrease in community diversity between the respective donor and
colonized GF mice (SI Appendix, Fig. 10). Following P. yoelii in-
fection, GF mice that received either Jax or NCI cecal transplants
had parasite burdens similar to control Jax and NCI mice (Fig. 3 B
and C). Both NCI control mice and GF mice that received NCI
cecal transplants also had decreased survival compared with the Jax
control mice and GF mice that received Jax cecal transplants (Fig.
3D). Collectively, these data provided a direct demonstration that
the severity of malaria was modulated by the gut microbiota.
Decreased Parasite Burden in Mice Treated with Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacterium. To identify individual microbial phylotypes that
may shape the severity of malaria, a deeper analysis was performed
on the bacterial communities in the cecum. When pooled by re-
sistance (Jax/Tac) or susceptibility (NCI/Har) to P. yoelii, several
phylotypes (referred to here as operational taxonomic units) emerged
from a linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe)-driven analysis
(29) as biomarkers of the resistant or susceptible phenotype. Among
those differences, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were overly
abundant in the resistant mice compared with susceptible mice (SI
Appendix, Fig. 11), with differences in Lactobacillus being the greatest
driver of the differential community structure between resistant and
susceptible mice (SI Appendix, Fig. 11B).
To evaluate the linkage between Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium
toward resistance to severe malaria, Jax and NCI mice were treated
with laboratory-cultured yogurt supplemented with probiotics that
contained Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species before and fol-
lowing infection with P. yoelii. DNA sequencing of Lactobacillus
isolated from fecal pellets from Jax and NCI mice or laboratory-
cultured yogurt demonstrated phylogenetic congruence (SI Appendix,
Fig. 12). Consumption of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium can
modulate the gut microbial community structure (30) or function
(31). Following infection with P. yoelii, both Jax and NCI mice treated
with yogurt had a modest, but significant (Jax: P < 0.0001, NCI: P =
0.0418), decrease in parasite burden compared with control un-
treated mice (SI Appendix, Fig. 13). Jax and NCI mice treated with

 milk used to make the yogurt showed a similar parasite burden as
control Jax and NCI mice [mean area under the parasitemia curve
(AUC) on days 5–34 (AUCDay 5–34): Jax control (n = 4): 107.2 ±
11.39 (SD) vs. Jax milk (n = 4) 83.55 ± 24.83 (SD), P = 0.13; NCI
control (n = 4): 447.1 ± 85.65 (SD) vs. NCI milk (n = 3) 384.8 ±
73.08 (SD), P = 0.36]. However, when mice were treated with anti-
biotics before yogurt treatment, we observed a profound decrease
(14-fold) in parasite burden in the susceptible NCI mice (Fig. 4 A and
B), and no weight loss in those mice was noted compared with
the other NCI groups (Fig. 4C). These data support the ability of
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium to contribute toward the modula-
tion of Plasmodium parasite burden, yet other constituents of the gut
microbiota may also contribute to regulating the severity of malaria.
Severity of Malaria Correlates with the Magnitude of the Host
Immune Response. The gut microbiota can shape host immunity to
systemic viral infections (19), and T follicular helper (Tfh)-produced
IL-21 is required for germinal center (GC) B-cell help and clear-
ance of murine Plasmodium infections (32). Consistent with these
observations, resistant Jax mice exhibited elevated P. yoelii-
specific CD4+ T-cell [CD49dhiCD11ahi (33)], Tfh cell, and GC
B-cell responses compared with susceptible NCI mice (Fig. 5 A–
C and SI Appendix, Fig. 14). Jax and NCI mice had similar titers
of IgM specific for the 19-kDa fragment of merozoite surface
protein 1 (MSP119) from P. yoelii (Fig. 5D), suggesting similar
activation of B cells in both groups. In contrast, Jax mice exhibited
accelerated Ab class switching from MSP119-specific IgM to IgG
isotypes, four- to 10-fold higher titers at day 14 postinfection,
compared with NCI mice (Fig. 5D). Thus, one mechanism by which
the gut microbiome shapes the severity of malaria following P. yoelii
infection may be through modulation of the host immune response.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that the murine gut microbiome influences
the parasite burden of Plasmodium rodent species and modu-
lates the severity of malaria in mice. Importantly, parasite burden
is currently the best-known correlate of disease severity following
P. falciparum infection in humans (3, 4). An association between the
gut microbial community and Plasmodium parasites has been pre-
viously recognized in the mosquito vector (34–38). Interestingly, the
unique assemblage of skin bacteria on human skin has also been
shown to have an impact on the attractiveness of Anopheles mos-
quitoes to particular individuals (39, 40).
Two recent publications further support that the gut microbiota
affects mammalian stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. The first
study demonstrated that specific gut bacteria could have an impact
on the transmission of P. berghei sporozoites from mosquitos to
mice (20). The authors showed that the gut pathobiont E. coli O86:
B7 induced the production of anti–α-gal Abs. When Plasmodium-
infected mosquitoes injected sporozoites into the dermal tissue
during a blood meal, the anti–α-gal Abs bound to the Plasmodium
sporozoites, which prevented their migration to the liver (20).
These results also extended to humans, where the presence of anti–
α-gal IgM Abs correlated with protection against P. falciparum
infection. The effect of E. coli O86:B7 on Plasmodium infection
was limited to transmission of sporozoites because there was no
effect of the anti–α-gal Abs on the symptomatic blood stage of the
infection. Consistent with these findings, a second report

 demonstrated that the unique composition of stool bacteria in
Malian children correlated with prospective risk of P. falciparum
infection, although not progression to febrile malaria (21). Al-
though the mechanism responsible for this observation is un-
known,
the
similarities
between
these
two
studies
(i.e.,
susceptibility to infection but not severity of blood stage infection)
suggest the prospective risk of P. falciparum infection differenti-
ated by stool bacteria composition may be attributed to differ-
ences in anti–α-gal IgM Abs. In contrast to these two publications,
we show that the gut microbiota modulates the severity of P. yoelii
blood stage infections in mice, implying a different mechanism.
Moreover, our findings show that the influence of the gut micro-
biome on Plasmodium infections is broad and not limited to the
transmission of the parasite. Taken together, our observations and
the findings of Yilmaz et al. (20) result in the intriguing specula-
tion that the human intestinal microbiota might have an impact on
different stages of the Plasmodium life cycle in humans. Clearly,
this area is ripe for future research.
One potential mechanism by which the gut microbiota regulates
the severity of malaria is a direct effect on the parasite itself, where
gut microbiota-derived products either promote or inhibit its growth.
Although this possibility has not been formally excluded, we observe
similar parasitemia expansion kinetics, when plotted on a log scale,
between days 5 and 11 postinfection in both resistant and susceptible
mice. This observation suggests that the gut microbiota does not
have a direct effect on the parasite. Consequently, it is more likely
that the gut microbiota has an impact on the severity of malaria by
modulating the host immune response to Plasmodium. Consistent
with this possibility, resistant Jax mice exhibited an elevated anti-
Plasmodium immune response compared with susceptible NCI mice.
Although these data correlate with the parasite burden in these
mice, further experiments will be necessary to demonstrate whether
the differential immune response is responsible for the difference in
severity, and if so, how the gut microbiota modulates the host im-
mune response to this extragastrointestinal infection. It has been
previously shown that the gut microbiome provides signals to
monocytes/macrophages that primed those cells to respond to and
help control systemic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections
(19). Whether the gut microbiome modulates host immunity to
Plasmodium through similar or different effects on the host immune
system remains to be determined.
As mentioned above, diet has a major role in shaping the com-
position and activity of the gut microbiota (25, 41, 42). Consequently,
manipulating the structure and function of these complex commu-
nities through the diet provides an opportunity to manipulate the
host immune system (41). In our study, we identified that Lactoba-
cillus and Bifidobacterium species in cecal content could have a pro-
tective role by modulating the parasite burden and attenuating the
severity of the disease. It is also possible that these bacterial genera
correlate with decreased parasitemia through niche competition that
decreases the abundance of bacterial genera that cause elevated
parasitemia. Because antibiotic treatment followed by yogurt treat-
ment triggered a 14-fold reduction in parasite burden in susceptible
mice, the results suggest that through optimization (e.g., identifying
and treating with the most effective “protective” bacterial species or
eliminating bacteria that contribute to high parasitemia), modulating
the gut microbiome has the potential to be a novel prophylaxis to
prevent severe malaria. Consistent with this possibility, prior work has
shown that children in a rural African village in Burkina Faso have an
enrichment of the Bacteroidetes phylum and a depletion of the
Firmicutes phylum, which contains Lactobacillus, compared with
European children (43). This bacterial assemblage resembles
the community structure in susceptible mice that have increased
Bacteroidetes and reduced Firmicutes compared with resistant mice
(SI Appendix, Fig. 11). Therefore, the commonality between the
bacterial community structure in African children and Plasmodium-
susceptible mice suggests the possibility that probiotic modulation
of the gut microbiota in mice to control severe malaria may work
in humans.
This report demonstrates that the severity of malaria in mice is
profoundly affected by the composition of the gut microbiota. The
data lead to the hypothesis that differences in the gut microbiota may
explain why some humans infected with Plasmodium progress to
severe disease and others do not. The results also support the pos-
sibility that manipulating the gut microbiota has the potential to
control the severity of malaria in humans. Whereas modulating the

Materials and Methods
Mice and Infections. Conventionally housed mice were purchased from Jax,
NCI, CR, Har, and Tac. GF mice were purchased from the National Gnotobiotic
Rodent Resource Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The
University of Tennessee and University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committees reviewed and approved animal experiments. Mice were
fed NIH-31 Modified Open Formula Mouse/Rat Irradiated Diet (Harlan 7913),
unless otherwise noted, in which case mice were fed Teklad 22/5 Rodent Diet
(Harlan 8640), Jax in-house diet (5K67; Cincinnati Lab & Pet Supply, Inc.), or
NCI in-house diet (5L79 Cincinnati Lab & Pet Supply, Inc.). GF mice received
diluted cecum material administered by oral gavage. After transplants, mice
were housed using conventional conditions. Mice were infected with
P. yoelii 17XNL, P. chabaudi AS, and P. berghei ANKA. Blood samples were
taken from the tail at regular intervals from 3 to 35 d postinfection. Para-
sitemia, percentage of RBCs infected with Plasmodium, was assessed by eval-
uation of thin blood smears or flow cytometry. Yogurt was made using a
starter culture (Yogurt Starter Culture no. 2; Custom Probiotics) enriched with
a probiotic powder supplement containing numerous Lactobacillus and Bifi-
dobacterium species (11 Strain Probiotic Powder; Custom Probiotics). Mice
were treated with an oral antibiotic mixture consisting of ampicillin, vanco-
mycin, metronidazole, neomycin sulfate, and gentamycin sulfate. Cellular
immune response was measured by flow cytometry, and MSP119-specific Abs
were measured by ELISA.
Gut Microbiota Analysis. The distal half of the small intestine, cecum, and colon
was excised from mice and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. DNA was extracted
from samples using the MoBio PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit. Bacterial 16S rRNA
genes were amplified using bacteria-specific PCR primers targeting the V4 region.
DNA sequencing was completed using the MiSeq (Illumina) platform at Hudson
Alpha Institute for Biotechnology, Huntsville, AL. Sequences have been deposited
in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under Bioproject PRJNA289122. The Mothur
software package was used to process sequences, to cluster sequences for phy-
logenetic classification, and to sort sequences into groups based on digestive
tract regions. The PRIMER-E software package was used to interrogate the re-
lationships between phylotypes across samples and to derive correlations be-
tween phylotype presence/abundance and other parameters. Detection of
“biomarker” sequences was performed using the software package
LEfSe (huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/).
Statistical Analysis. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses of data,
except the gut microbiota and metabolomics data, were done using
GraphPad Software (Prism, version 6). The AUC was estimated for each group
following the trapezoidal rule with the following equation:
AUCt1�t�last = 0.5
X
ðYi + Yi+1Þ * ðti+1-tiÞ,
where “t” is sampling time and “Y” is the observed outcome (e.g., per-
centage of parasitemia).
