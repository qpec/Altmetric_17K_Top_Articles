During crisis events, people often seek out event-related information
to stay informed of what is happening. However, when information
from official channels is lacking or disseminated irregularly, people
may be at risk for exposure to rumors that fill the information void.
We studied information-seeking during a university lockdown fol-
lowing an active-shooter event. In study 1, students in the lockdown
(n = 3,890) completed anonymous surveys 1 week later. Those who
indicated receiving conflicting information about the lockdown re-
ported greater acute stress [standardized regression coefficient (b) =
0.07; SE = 0.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04, 0.10]. Additionally,
those who reported direct contact with close others via text message
(or phone) and used Twitter for critical updates during the lockdown
were exposed to more conflicting information. Higher acute stress
was reported by heavy social media users who trusted social media
for critical updates (b = 0.06, SE = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.03, 0.10). In study 2,
we employed a big data approach to explore the time course of
rumor transmission across 5 hours surrounding the lockdown within
a subset of the university’s Twitter followers. We also examined the
patterning of distress in the hours during the lockdown as rumors
about what was happening (e.g., presence of multiple shooters)
spread among Twitter users. During periods without updates from
official channels, rumors and distress increased. Results highlight the
importance of releasing substantive updates at regular intervals dur-
ing a crisis event and monitoring social media for rumors to mitigate
rumor exposure and distress.
rumor | crisis event | Twitter | lockdown | social media
S
ince 2000, active shooter events in the United States have
been on the rise and often result in higher casualty counts
when they occur in educational institutions compared with other
settings (1). Crisis events like these are often accompanied by
deficits of credible information as authorities attempt to piece
together the facts of the unfolding events. As a consequence,
individuals caught in the wake of the crisis are left vulnerable to
rumors and conflicting information from unofficial communica-
tion channels they trust. Despite a robust scientific literature on
the circumstances in which rumors are generated (2–4) and trans-
mitted (5, 6), little is known about the psychological correlates of
exposure to rumors during crisis events. When rumors proliferate
during dangerous and uncertain situations, what impact do they
have on people who receive and believe them?
Crisis events are often ambiguous in nature, and when uncer-
tainty is high, appraisals of threat among individuals caught in their
path can be heightened (7). This, in turn, may instigate information-
seeking behavior as a way of reducing situational uncertainty (8, 9)
and consequently the psychological distress such uncertainty en-
genders (10). In the past, this information seeking led people to
their radios and televisions to acquire critical updates from official
channels. However, when a crisis unfolds, people now increasingly
acquire critical updates from social media (e.g., Twitter; refs. 11–
15), along with traditional media channels (16).
Moreover, when information from official channels is irregular
or lacks new information, uncertainty and information-seeking
behavior are likely sustained. As a result, people may also turn
to unofficial channels, such as social media, to mitigate their
discomfort. The challenge with social media as a resource for
updates, however, is the lack of mechanisms for vetting the ac-
curacy of the information being shared among users. This is
particularly important because, as the rumor literature suggests,
trust in an information source moderates whether rumors are
believed and transmitted (17). In addition, once rumors begin to
spread on social media, they are very difficult to undermine with
updates or corrections (6).
What people see when they are exposed to media-based cov-
erage of a crisis event has been studied previously in the context of
collective traumas, such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters
that affect many people and occur without warning (16). Large
studies of representative US samples demonstrate that, among
other variables, repeated indirect, media-based exposure to col-
lective traumas is associated with event-related distress, even when
controlling for pretrauma media habits and preexisting mental
health conditions (18, 19). For example, in a study following the
Boston Marathon bombings (BMB), researchers found that 6 or
more hours of BMB-related media use was associated with higher
acute stress than was direct exposure to the bombings (18). This
relationship is thought to be at least partly driven by the trans-
mission of graphic, event-related imagery via news coverage (16,
20). However, when images are not relevant or available, other
content, like rumors or conflicting information, may also contrib-
ute to the distress individuals experience during a crisis.
We explored the role of rumors in two studies of a single
university shooting, using multiple methods to characterize the
community’s response. In study 1, we examined psychological
Significance
During active shooter events when danger is imminent and of-
ficial information is disseminated inconsistently, ambiguity is
high. In these situations, individuals may seek information from
unofficial channels (e.g., social media), thereby exposing them-
selves to unverified information and rumors. In a study of stu-
dents caught in a university-wide lockdown, we found that those
who relied on social media for updates reported increased ex-
posure to conflicting information. Moreover, those who trusted
what they read reported greater distress. Then, using a big-data
analysis of Twitter data spanning ∼5 hours surrounding the
event, we demonstrated that rumor transmission tracks with
community-level negative emotion during gaps in official com-
munication. Officials should monitor social media channels to
mitigate the negative impact of rumors during collective traumas.

 distress and correlates of communication-channel use among
3,890 students at a major university in the United States who were
under a protracted lockdown (∼2 hours) during an active shooter
event in which critical updates from officials were infrequent. In
study 2, we employed a big data approach to explore the time
course of rumor transmission and patterning of distress during the
lockdown.
Study 1
Data were collected using a Qualtrics survey software link
emailed on the researchers’ behalf by the university administra-
tion to all enrolled students 7 days after the shooting. Students
reported their distress about the lockdown by responding to
items on a standardized multi-item measure of acute stress (21).
Respondents also indicated the communication channels from
which they acquired information and critical updates during the
lockdown, including direct contact from close others (e.g., phone
calls and texts from friends and/or family), traditional media (e.g.,
radio, television, online news), and social media (e.g., Twitter, Face-
book, Snapchat, Reddit, Instagram). For every communication
channel students used, they reported how much they trusted it
for critical updates about the shooting and lockdown. To capture
exposure to rumors during the lockdown, students reported the
overall extent to which they received conflicting information
about the details of the lockdown across all communication channels
they used.
Results indicated that exposure to conflicting information was
associated with acute stress related to the lockdown, after con-
trolling for several relevant covariates (Table 1). Traditional me-
dia use was not associated with acute stress, but direct contact with
close others and social media use were each associated with
greater acute stress. We then examined whether trust in these com-
munication channels moderated their respective relations with
distress. No moderating effect was found for trust in direct contact
with close others. However, greater acute stress was reported by
heavy social media users who trusted social media for critical up-
dates (Fig. 1). In addition, students who acquired critical updates
via text messages from close others or via Twitter reported in-
creased exposure to conflicting information compared to those
who did not rely on these channels (Table 2).
Study 2
Because students in this first study who used Twitter reported
increased exposure to conflicting information, in study 2 we ex-
amined the time course of community-level rumor generation
and virality (i.e., degree to which rumors were circulated) among
a subset of Twitter users who followed two official university
Twitter accounts. Using R (22), we connected to Twitter via its
Application Programming Interface (API) on the day of the
lockdown and downloaded a list of the most recent 13,000 public
followers of the university’s primary and emergency response
Twitter accounts. Two weeks later, we downloaded the most re-
cent 200 tweets from each follower. Because tweets were time-
stamped, we constrained our analysis to tweets generated in the
hour leading up to the initial 911 call until the second hour after
the lockdown was lifted, segmenting time into 15-min blocks. Each
tweet in this frame was tagged if it contained a rumor, defined as a
statement verified to be blatantly false following the incident. To
capture community-level distress about the lockdown, we devised
an R script to automatically tag tweets referencing the lockdown

 incident (for a similar method, see ref. 23) and those containing
negative emotion words using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Counter (LIWC) negative emotion dictionary (24). For example,
tweets about the lockdown that also contained words such as
“distress” or “afraid” were tagged to reflect event-related negative
emotions. Tagging tweets in this way allowed us to calculate a
count of rumor tweets, as well as calculate the proportion of
tweets with event-related negative emotions in each 15-min seg-
ment over time. We then overlaid the official campus alerts sent to
all university students during the same time frame (Table S1).
Within the corpus of tweets generated around the lockdown
time frame (Fig. 2), 38 rumors were identified (Mretweet count = 179,
SD = 427; min = 0, max = 2,299). Viral rumors (i.e., those retweeted
most frequently) involved descriptions of a nonexistent white male
suspect and his movements. Other rumors involved claims of mul-
tiple deaths and warnings of multiple shooters at several locations
on campus (Table 3). As depicted in Fig. 2, the bulk of rumors were
generated during the 90-min gap in communication from campus
officials after the first lockdown alert and continued consistently
until a second campus alert was disseminated to remind students
about the lockdown. Although the number of rumors decreased
after the second alert, the virality of the few rumors that were
generated in the time block after a third alert (again regarding the
lockdown) far exceeded any rumor tweet in the preceding blocks
(Fig. 3). It is not clear why the rumors in this block went viral, but it
might have been due to more people becoming aware of the situ-
ation and wanting to pass information on to others. Although we
cannot directly link them together, event-related negative emotions
tracked almost identically with rumor virality consistently across
time (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that the virality of rumors may
be implicated in the transmission of distress during a crisis.
Discussion
Prior research on rumors demonstrates that situational ambiguity,
high importance, and anxiety are necessary conditions for rumor
generation (2–4). Consistent with this work, our findings indicate
that during crisis events, when critical updates from official
channels are irregular, rumors proliferate. Individuals who are
caught in the path of a crisis event are often left feeling helpless
and without situational control (25), which can lead people to see
patterns in the information obtained that are not present (e.g., via
illusory pattern perception; ref. 26). In addition, situational stress
may interfere with information processing via inhibited executive
functioning (e.g., working memory, self-regulation processes; ref.
27). Taken together, these effects may diminish the myriad cog-
nitive processes necessary for scrutinizing the veracity of unique
and repeated information (28), such as content propagated on
social media platforms during a crisis. This causal chain likely
plays a role in increasing the potency of rumor exposure during
potentially threatening and ambiguous crisis situations.
To mitigate this problem, we offer several recommendations.
First, emergency officials should disseminate frequent updates to
the affected population, in real time. In the context of a school
shooting, repeated alerts have been found to increase the percep-
tion of urgency among participants who received them (29), a factor
necessary for eliciting swift and appropriate action. Although we
cannot explicitly test whether more frequent updates from official

 channels would have mitigated rumors and distress using the data
we collected, crisis communication scholars posit that regular com-
munications from emergency management officials are essential for
mitigating uncertainty and rumors after a crisis (30). For example,
as part of their response to a mass shooting at a shopping mall in
Munich, Germany, local police urged the public via press confer-
ences and social media to resist speculation about the attack and
directly addressed rumors on social media as they became aware of
them (31). Despite false reports of additional shootings in the city
and the overall lack of clarity about what was happening during the
citywide lockdown, police chose to maintain transparency and
constant contact with the public throughout the ordeal, a strategy
likely appreciated by the public (32). Had the Munich police remained
silent, however, the budding rumors about shootings in other city
locations would have likely filled the information void. As com-
munities learn to manage active shooter crises and other emer-
gencies, crisis communications like those employed by the Munich
police department will be prudent to put in place.
Second, critical updates disseminated to the public should include
new information, when possible. However, when new information is
not available, updates should be tailored to reduce situational uncer-
tainty (33), thereby mitigating distress and rumors (30). Additionally,
emergency management officials should attempt to counter the
impact of rumors that arise during crisis situations by monitoring
social media channels and encouraging individuals to keep a healthy
skepticism about information coming from unofficial channels.
Furthermore, we believe the news media, which play a critical role
in informing the public during crisis events (30), must share the
responsibility for disseminating accurate information. The im-
portance of this point is illustrated by the examples of conspiracy
theories propagated on social media (and other channels) that
resonate with individuals psychologically attuned to alternative
narratives (34). Although seemingly benign, conspiracy theories
can lead people to deny that acts of horror, like the 9/11 terrorist
attacks and the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, oc-
curred at all. Consequently, denial narratives born from incon-
sistencies in news reporting can directly and negatively impact
the individuals in communities devastated by these events (35).
Although we examined the correlates of unofficial communication-
channel use in our analyses in study 1, we acknowledge the im-
portant role of official channel use during a crisis. Unfortunately,
because 96% of respondents in our sample indicated consulting
official channels, and roughly 92% indicated trusting these chan-
nels somewhat or strongly, the lack of variation precluded our
ability to include these variables in our statistical models. Also, we
are unable to determine whether participants actively sought—or

 were passively exposed to—information from different channels.
During the lockdown, participants may have sought information
(especially during the 90-min gap in communication from campus
officials) by accessing news sites and social media, or they might
have sent text messages to friends and family to see if they knew any
details. However, students could have simultaneously received un-
solicited messages via social media or text during this event, in which
case their receipt of information could be considered passive. An
additional limitation of study 1 was that data collection occurred
retrospectively (albeit soon after the event), and we did not employ
real-time data collection methods during the lockdown (e.g., eco-
logical momentary assessment), which would have been valuable for
assessing exposure to conflicting information and distress responses.
To compensate for this, we collected archival Twitter data—before,
during, and after the lockdown—from thousands of users in study
2, providing supplemental data that occurred in real time. This
supplemental analysis of Twitter data fostered additional depth to
our understanding of the crisis event we studied.
Conclusion
Exposure to rumors and conflicting information that arise out of
the ambiguity of a crisis may have negative consequences for the
people who receive and believe them. Moreover, the extent to
which people trust the channels through which unofficial and
conflicting information flow may exacerbate distress. Rumor
generation during ambiguous crisis events is certain to continue.
Therefore, social scientists should study the psychological impact
of rumor exposure using methodological triangulation to under-
stand the dynamic contextual features of and community responses
to these events. Doing so will help to better elucidate the function
and impact of crisis-related communications, or the lack thereof,
on distress responses. Science on crisis communications and the
media can be an ally in this challenging set of tasks.
Materials and Methods
Study 1.
Sample and procedures. Beginning 7 days after the campus shooting, un-
dergraduate and graduate students were invited to complete an anonymous,
internet-based survey via a system-wide email sent on the researchers’ behalf by
the university administration. The survey was fielded to all 40,339 students listed
in the university system. A reminder email was sent out a week later to bolster
student participation. Participants who clicked the link to the survey were pre-
sented with an initial screen indicating that the purpose of the survey was to
study the impact of the campus shooting; informed consent was obtained from
all individuals included in the study. Participants were asked to complete the
survey without consulting others and were instructed to answer items as hon-
estly as possible. Participants were also presented with contact information for
the lead researchers and the campus counseling center and encouraged to call
or visit the center if they felt a need to speak with someone about their feelings
regarding the incident. Data were collected up to 29 days following the
shooting, with the majority of responses (92%) collected within 16 days post-
event. The participation rate was ∼18% (n = 6,540). Of these, 3,890 (∼60%)
students reported having been in the lockdown; between 2,696 and 3,393 of
these students had complete information on variables across analyses in study
1. Of the 3,051 students who provided ethnicity data, nearly 40% identified as
European American, roughly 30% identified as Asian American, and 14% iden-
tified as Latino American; the remainder identified as multiracial/ethnic (8.6%),
African American (2.7%), or other (6%). All procedures for this study were ap-
proved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Irvine.
Dependent variables.
Acute stress. Symptoms of acute stress were assessed using the Acute Stress
Disorder Scale-5 (21), which is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5; ref. 36). Respondents used a
5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) to de-
scribe the extent to which they experienced each of 14 possible reactions
“since the shooting and lockdown” (e.g., “Do you have distressing dreams
about the lockdown/shooting?”). Responses were summed (range, 0–56) to
create a continuous score for acute stress symptoms and to capture maxi-
mum variability in potential responses (37).
Conflicting information. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to
which they agreed with the statement. “I received conflicting information
from different sources about the details of the shooting.” Responses were mea-
sured on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (a great deal).
Because no valid information about the event was available to any students
during the lockdown, this variable was used as a proxy for rumor exposure.
To validate this assumption, we examined responses to an open-ended
survey item that asked “What particular parts of the event were most upset-
ting to you?” We used an R script to code each response for whether it men-
tioned the word “rumor.” Those who mentioned rumors reported higher
exposure to conflicting information (standardized b = 0.31, SE = 0.04, P < 0.001).
To further clarify what participants wrote about rumors, we examined the word
pairs (i.e., bigram analysis) that occurred most commonly in the corpus of re-
sponses using a text analysis program called Meaning Extraction Helper (38). The
four word pairs occurring most commonly were multiple shooter, rumor spread,
rumor multiple, and rumor shooter. The words rumors and false information
appeared in other responses with less frequency but were also present. Given
that many respondents wrote at length, we also conducted a trigram analysis,
which analyzes the most common occurrence of three words appearing together
across responses. This analysis revealed that “rumor [of] multiple shooters” was
the most common response.
Independent variables.
Traditional media and online news. On a 3-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at
all, 1 = some of the time, 2 = most or all of the time), respondents indicated
receiving critical updates from radio, television, and online news sites (e.g., CNN,
New York Times, TMZ). Responses for each of these channels were dichotomously
coded (0 = not at all, 1 = at least some of the time). They were aggregated to
form a count of traditional media/online news sites used (range, 0–3).
Direct contact from close others. On a 3-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all,
1 = some of the time, 2 = most or all of the time), respondents indicated
whether they received critical updates from a group text message from a
campus student organization, a text message from a friend, a text message
from a family member, a phone call from a friend, and a phone call from a
family member. Responses for each of these channels were dichotomously
coded (0 = not at all, 1 = at least some of the time). They were aggregated to
form a count of direct contact from close others (range, 0–5).
Social media. On a 3-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all, 1 = some of the
time, 2 = most or all of the time), respondents indicated whether they re-
ceived critical updates from Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, and
Instagram or some other platform not listed. Responses were dichotomously
coded (0 = not at all, 1 = at least some of the time). They were aggregated to
form a count of social media channels used (range, 0–5).
Channel trust. For each communication channel students reported using,
they were asked to rate how much they trusted it for information about the
shooting and lockdown. These ratings were reported on a 5-point Likert-type
scale ranging from 1 (strongly distrust) to 5 (strongly trust). That is, if students
reported using Twitter, they were asked to rate how much they trusted it for
information and critical updates. Trust ratings were averaged across each
communication channel category to create a composite of trust for traditional
media and online news (α = 0.90), direct contact from close others (α = 0.89),
and social media (α = 0.90), respectively.
Relevant covariates.
Prior school shooting experience. Respondents indicated whether or not they,
or someone close to them, ever experienced a school shooting. A total of 16.11%
(n = 611) reported previously having such an experience.
Prior trauma exposure. Respondents were asked whether they personally
experienced anaturaldisaster (e.g.,tornado,earthquake), communityviolence(e.g.,
shooting, civil unrest), combat during war, or any other form of violence before the
shooting. Responses across these four items were summed and ranged from 0–4.
Affiliation with affected department. To capture psychological proximity to the
department where the shooting took place, respondents reported their af-
filiation with the department. In all, 26.2% (n = 830) indicated being affiliated
with the department either by being a department major, minor, having
taken classes in the department, or some other reason.
Lockdown event exposure. Respondents were asked to indicate whether they
experienced each of 11 exposures to the lockdown (e.g., “I was in [building
name omitted] when the shooting occurred”). Affirmative responses across
these items were summed to create an index of event exposure. Responses
ranged from 0 to 11 exposures.
Alone. Respondents indicated whether they were alone or with others
during the lockdown. Responses were dummy coded such that if a student
indicated being alone, he or she was coded with a 1.
Analytic strategy. Statistical analyses were conducted in Stata 14 (College
Station, TX). A series of ordinary least-squares regression analyses were con-
ducted to examine correlates of acute stress and exposure to conflicting in-
formation, respectively. Because a number of collective traumas were prominent
in the media during data collection, we opted to control for survey completion
week to account for the potential influence of these events on participant
responses. We also included statistical controls for age and gender. Descriptive
statistics for all model variables are reported in Tables S2 and S3.

Twitter user selection. There are several challenges associated with searching
for tweets in a geographic area using the Twitter API. Although Twitter does

 allow for searching based on geographic coordinates (geotags), only 1–5% of
tweets are geotagged. Moreover, it is not currently possible to perform
searches for tweets generated more than 3 days before the date of the search.
To circumvent these challenges in the context of a campus shooting, re-
searchers have relied on downloading tweets directly from followers of a
university’s Twitter account; the efficacy of this technique for approximating
users who are likely to be students affiliated with the university has been
demonstrated across several incidents of campus violence (23). Thus, on the day
of the shooting and lockdown, we used the twitteR package (39) for R (22)
to connect to the Twitter API and download the list of the most recent
20,000 followers of (or subscribers to) the university’s main Twitter account and
6,000 followers of the university’s emergency management Twitter account.
We then removed users from this list based on the following criteria:
non-English language account, private account (in which case tweets
would not be publicly available), “verified” account (usually indicative of
high-profile Twitter users or businesses), and accounts with more than
1,000 total tweets (to omit superusers). After employing these exclusion crite-
ria, 13,000 user accounts were available from which to pull tweets. Approxi-
mately 2 weeks after the shooting and lockdown, we interfaced with the API
and requested the most recent 200 tweets from each user in our trimmed list.
Tweet processing. We downloaded nearly 2.3 million tweets. We then constrained
our analysis to the time frame immediately around the lockdown: approximately
1 hour before the 911 call up until the end of the second hour after the all-clear.
Within this 5-hour window of time, we captured 11,617 tweets from 2,863 users.
After removing duplicate tweets, we were left with 7,824 tweets from 2,515 users.
Measures.
Rumor tweets. All tweets generated in the time frame around the lockdown
were manually coded for rumors. A coder was instructed to tag tweets in
the sample that contained information that was not verified at the time of
the lockdown. Given that virtually no information was available during the
lockdown, aside from official reminders that the university was on lockdown,
the task of identifying rumor tweets was relatively straightforward. In all,
38 tweets with rumors were identified.
Rumor virality. Every tweet downloaded via the Twitter API comes with a
measure of how many times it was retweeted. This measure captures the
virality of the tweet over its lifetime and is not tied to its virality at a given
time point (e.g., during the lockdown). However, given the targeted nature
of this event, virality was likely isolated to the lockdown as there would be no
need to retweet any rumors about the lockdown after the all-clear.
Event-related negative emotion. We analyzed the linguistic content of each
tweet using a custom R script that tallied the frequency with which words
used in each tweet match words from the LIWC software’s negative emotion
dictionary (24). Similar to prior research (23), we also employed an R script
that used a 17-item custom word list to automatically identify and tag
tweets about the shooting and lockdown. This list included context-specific
words (e.g., lockdown, #[university name]strong, #prayfor[university name])
to bolster the script’s efficacy in identifying lockdown-related tweets.
Tweets containing at least one negative emotion word and one word ref-
erencing the event were coded with a 1 (all others coded with 0).
Analytic strategy. Data were imported into Stata 14 (College Station, TX) from R
(22), and tweets were combined into 15-min blocks across time. The proportion
of tweets with event-related negative emotion expression in each 15-min block
was calculated. We also calculated the quantity and virality (via retweet counts)
of rumor tweets in each block, respectively. Event-related negative emotion
expression was plotted across time, and rumor generation count and rumor
virality were overlaid, respectively, in two graphs (Figs. 2 and 3).
Note: The university that allowed authors access to the students who
served as subjects in study 1 did so with the proviso that the institution under
study would not be revealed. Although data were collected anonymously, the
identity of the institution and affected department are easily accessible in
both the questions asked on the survey as well as in responses provided by
subjects. Therefore, we are not allowed to release these data publicly. The
affected institution is also clearly identifiable in the tweets analyzed in study
2. Although data cannot be posted publicly, we would be willing to make
available to interested readers carefully redacted documentation and data
files upon request.
