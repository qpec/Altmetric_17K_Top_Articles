Resident physicians routinely order unnecessary inpatient
laboratory tests. As hospitalists face growing pressures to
reduce low-value services, understanding the factors that
drive residents’ laboratory ordering can help steer resident
training in high-value care. We conducted a qualitative anal-
ysis of internal medicine (IM) and general surgery (GS) resi-
dents at a large academic medical center to describe the
frequency of perceived unnecessary ordering of inpatient
laboratory tests, factors contributing to that behavior, and
potential interventions to change it. The sample comprised
57.0% of IM and 54.4% of GS residents. Among respond-
ents, perceived unnecessary inpatient laboratory test order-
ing was self-reported by 88.2% of IM and 67.7% of GS
residents, occurring on a daily basis by 43.5% and 32.3%
of responding IM and GS residents, respectively. Across
both specialties, residents attributed their behaviors to the
health system culture, lack of transparency of the costs
associated with health care services, and lack of faculty role
models that celebrate restraint. Journal of Hospital Medicine

Resident physicians routinely order inpatient laborato-
ry tests,1 and there is evidence to suggest that many of
these tests are unnecessary2 and potentially harmful.3
The Society of Hospital Medicine has identified reduc-
ing the unnecessary ordering of inpatient laboratory
testing as part of the Choosing Wisely campaign.4
Hospitalists at academic medical centers face growing
pressures to develop processes to reduce low-value
care and train residents to be stewards of healthcare
resources.5 Studies6–9 have described that institutional
and training factors drive residents’ resource utiliza-
tion patterns, but, to our knowledge, none have
described what factors contribute to residents’ unnec-
essary laboratory testing. To better understand the
factors associated with residents’ ordering patterns,
we conducted a qualitative analysis of internal medi-
cine (IM) and general surgery (GS) residents at a large
academic medical center in order to describe residents’
perception of the: (1) frequency of ordering unneces-
sary inpatient laboratory tests, (2) factors contributing
to that behavior, and (3) potential interventions to
change it. We also explored differences in responses
by specialty and training level.
METHODS
In October 2014, we surveyed all IM and GS residents
at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. We
reviewed the literature and conducted focus groups
with residents to formulate items for the survey instru-
ment. A draft of the survey was administered to 8 resi-
dents from both specialties, and their feedback was
collated and incorporated into the final version of the
instrument. The final 15-question survey was com-
prised of 4 components: (1) training information such
as specialty and postgraduate year (PGY), (2) self-
reported frequency of perceived unnecessary ordering
of inpatient laboratory tests, (3) perception of factors
contributing to unnecessary ordering, and (4) potential
interventions
to
reduce
unnecessary
ordering.
An
unnecessary test was defined as a test that would not
change
management
regardless
of
its
result.
To
increase response rates, participants were entered into
drawings for $5 gift cards, a $200 air travel voucher,
and an iPad mini.
Descriptive statistics and v2tests were conducted with
Stata version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) to
explore differences in the frequency of responses by
specialty and training level. To identify themes that
emerged from free-text responses, two independent
reviewers (M.S.S. and E.J.K.) performed qualitative
content analysis using grounded theory.10 Reviewers
read 10% of responses to create a coding guide. Anoth-
er 10% of the responses were randomly selected to
assess inter-rater reliability by calculating j scores. The
reviewers independently coded the remaining 80% of
responses. Discrepancies were adjudicated by consensus

RESULTS
The sample comprised 57.0% (85/149) of IM and
54.4% (31/57) of GS residents (Table 1). Among
respondents, perceived unnecessary inpatient laborato-
ry test ordering was self-reported by 88.2% of IM and
67.7% of GS residents. This behavior was reported to
occur on a daily basis by 43.5% and 32.3% of respond-
ing IM and GS residents, respectively. Across both spe-
cialties,
the
most
commonly
reported
factors
contributing to these behaviors were learned practice
habit/routine (90.5%), a lack of understanding of the
costs associated with lab tests (86.2%), diagnostic
uncertainty (82.8%), and fear of not having the lab
result information when requested by an attending
(75.9%). There were no significant differences in any of
these contributing factors by specialty or PGY level.
Among
respondents
who
completed
a
free-text
response (IM: 76 of 85; GS: 21 of 31), the most com-
monly proposed interventions to address these issues
were increasing cost transparency (IM 40.8%; GS
33.3%), improvements to faculty role modeling (IM
30.2%; GS 33.3%), and computerized reminders or
decision support (IM 21.1%; GS 28.6%) (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
A significant portion of inpatient laboratory testing is
unnecessary,2
creating
an
opportunity
to
reduce
utilization and associated costs. Our findings demon-
strate that these behaviors occur at high levels among
residents (IM 88.2%; GS 67.7%) at a large academic
medical center. These findings also reveal that resi-
dents attribute this behavior to practice habit, lack of
access to cost data, and perceived expectations for
daily lab ordering by faculty. Interventions to change
these behaviors will need to involve changes to the
health system culture, increasing transparency of the
costs associated with healthcare services, and shifting
to a model of education that celebrates restraint.11
Our study adds to the emerging quest for delivering
value in healthcare and provides several important
insights for hospitalists and medical educators at aca-
demic centers. First, our findings reflect the significant
role that the clinical learning environment plays in
influencing practice behaviors among residents. Resi-
dency training is a critical time when physicians begin
to form habits that imprint upon their future practice
patterns,5 and our residents are aware that their
behavior to order what they perceive to be unneces-
sary laboratory tests is driven by habit. Studies6,7 have
shown that residents may implicitly accept certain
styles of practice as correct and are more likely to
adopt those styles during the early years of their train-
ing. In our institution, for example, the process of
ordering standing or daily morning labs using a
repeated “copy-forward” function in the electronic
health record is a common, learned practice (a ritual)
that is passed down from senior to junior residents
year after year. This practice is common across both
training specialties. There is a need to better under-
stand, measure, and change the culture in the clinical
learning environment to demonstrate practices and
values that model high-value care for residents. Multi-
pronged interventions that address culture, oversight,
and systems change12 are necessary to facilitate effec-
tive physician stewardship of inpatient laboratory test-
ing and attack a problem so deeply ingrained in habit.
Second, residents in our study believe that access to
cost information will better equip them to reduce
unnecessary
lab
ordering.
Two
recent
systematic
reviews13,14 have shown that having real-time access
to charges changes physician ordering and prescribing
behavior. Increasing cost transparency may not only
be an important intervention for hospitals to reduce
overuse and control cost, but also better arm resident
physicians with the information they need to make
higher-value recommendations for their patients and
be stewards of healthcare resources.
Third, our study highlights that residents’ unneces-
sary laboratory utilization is driven by perceived,
unspoken expectations for such ordering by faculty.
This reflects an important undercurrent in the medical
education system that has historically emphasized
and rewarded thoroughness while often penalizing
restraint.11 Hospitalists can play a major role in
changing these behaviors by sharing their expectations

 regarding test ordering at the beginning of teaching
rotations, including teaching points that discourage
overutilization during rounds, and role modeling high-
value care in their own practice. Taken together and
practiced routinely, these hospitalist behaviors could
prevent poor habits from forming in our trainees and
discourage
overinvestigation.
Hospitalists
must
be
responsible to disseminate the practice of restraint to
achieve more cost-effective care. Purposeful faculty
development efforts in the area of high-value care are
needed.
Additionally,
supporting
physician
leaders
that serve as the institutional bridge between graduate
medical education and the health system15 could fos-
ter an environment conducive to coaching residents
and faculty to reduce unnecessary practice variation.
This study is subject to several limitations. First, the
survey was conducted at a single academic medical cen-
ter, with a modest response rate, and thus our findings
may not be generalizable to other settings or residents of
different training programs. Second, we did not validate
residents’ perception of whether or not tests were, in fact,
unnecessary. We also did not validate residents’ self-
reporting of their own behavior, which may vary from
actual behavior. Lack of validation at the level of the tests
and at the level of the residents’ behavior are two distinct
but
inter-related
limitations.
Although
self-reported
responses among residents are an important indicator of
their practice, validating these
data with objective
measures, such as a measure of necessity of ordered lab
tests as determined by an expert physician or group of
experienced physicians or the number of inpatient labs
ordered by residents, may add further insights. Ordering
of perceived unnecessary tests may be even more common
if there was under-reporting of this behavior. Third,
although we provided a definition within the survey,
interpretation among survey respondents of the term
“unnecessary” may vary, and this variation may contrib-
ute to our findings. However, we did provide a clear defi-
nition in the survey and we attempted to mitigate this
with feedback from residents on our preliminary pilot.
In conclusion, this is one of the first qualitative
evaluations to explore residents’ perceptions on why
they order unnecessary inpatient laboratory tests. Our
findings offer a rich understanding of residents’ beliefs
about their own role in unnecessary lab ordering and
explore possible solutions through the lens of the resi-
dent.
Yet,
it
is
unclear
whether
tests
deemed
“unnecessary” by residents would also be considered
unnecessary by attending physicians or even patients.
Future efforts are needed to better define which inpa-
tient tests are unnecessary from multiple perspectives
including clinicians and patients.
