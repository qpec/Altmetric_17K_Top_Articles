Maternal Western diet increases adiposity even in male offspring of
obesity-resistant rat dams: early endocrine risk markers. Am J Physiol

overnutrition or associated complications putatively mediate the obe-
sogenic effects of perinatal high-fat diet on developing offspring.
Here, we tested the hypothesis that a Western diet developmental
environment increases adiposity not only in male offspring from
obesity-prone (DIO) mothers, but also in those from obesity-resistant
(DR) dams, implicating a deleterious role for the Western diet per se.
Selectively bred DIO and DR female rats were fed chow (17% kcal
fat) or Western diet (32%) for 54 days before mating and, thereafter,
through weaning. As intended, despite chow-like caloric intake, West-
ern diet increased prepregnancy weight gain and circulating leptin
levels in DIO, but not DR, dams. Yet, in both genotypes, maternal
Western diet increased the weight and adiposity of preweanlings, as
early as in DR offspring, and increased plasma leptin, insulin, and
adiponectin of weanlings. Although body weight normalized with
chow feeding during adolescence, young adult Western diet offspring
subsequently showed decreased energy expenditure and, in DR off-
spring, decreased lipid utilization as a fuel substrate. By mid-adult-
hood, maternal Western diet DR offspring ate more chow, weighed
more, and were fatter than controls. Thus, maternal Western diet
covertly programmed increased adiposity in childhood and adulthood,
disrupted relations of energy regulatory hormones with body fat, and
decreased energy expenditure in offspring of lean, genetically
obesity-resistant mothers. Maternal Western diet exposure alone,
without maternal obesity or overnutrition, can promote offspring
weight gain.
heritable obesity; diet-induced obesity; endocrine hormone; energy
expenditure; environmental programming
AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, obesity rates have almost
tripled in the United States since 1980 (61). Obese children are
at risk for cardiovascular disease (28), Type 2 diabetes (84),
and social and psychological problems (66), as well as for
severe obesity in adulthood (16). A better understanding of
early causes and markers of obesity risk is needed.
In humans, 40–70% of obesity-related traits are heritable (4,
23, 24). Accordingly, Levin and colleagues (50, 69) selectively
bred outbred Sprague-Dawley rats for differential weight
gain response to a “Western” diet. The resultant lines are
prone or resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO and DR,
respectively) and model regulatory systems implicated in
human obesity (56).
The perinatal environment also influences the development
of energy regulatory systems. For example, maternal high-fat
diet consumption, weight gain, and gestational diabetes in-
crease offspring susceptibility to obesity in humans (17, 57)
and animals (34, 71). Previous studies have emphasized over-
nutrition (26, 46, 70) or the resulting maternal obesity (52, 60)
as proximate mediators. It remains unclear whether energy-
dense diets promote offspring obesity even if the mother
remains slim and does not overeat. In one study, rat dams
received a very high-fat (60% kcal fat) diet, but were pair-fed
to the caloric intake of chow-fed dams, thereby preventing
maternal obesity (83). Offspring did not show increased adi-
posity or body weight vs. those of chow-fed dams. However,
forced caloric restriction may have interfered with the effects
of high-fat diet consumption. Indeed, in nonhuman primates,
developing offspring of diet-resistant, lean mothers chronically
fed a high-fat (35% kcal) diet showed increased liver triglyc-
erides, hepatic oxidative stress, and body weight at 130 days
gestation (58). Understanding the role played by diet is impor-
tant because clinical recommendations and the general public’s
attention emphasize weight milestones (67a) and caloric intake
(38, 39) more than diet composition during pregnancy.
Accordingly, the current study examines whether early
Western diet exposure in obesity-prone (DIO) and obesity-
resistant (DR) rats increases offspring susceptibility to weight
gain. Because DR rats do not overeat or become obese when
fed a Western diet, the study can evaluate the effects of
Western diet per se without concurrent maternal obesity or
food restriction. The present study tests the alternate hypothe-
ses that 1) only offspring of obesity-prone dams will show
perinatal Western diet-induced increases in obesity risk (im-
plicating a necessary role for maternal obesity) vs. 2) perinatal
Western diet will increase body weight and adiposity even in
offspring of obesity-resistant dams (implicating a role for
Western diet independent of maternal obesity/overnutrition).
Unlike previous maternal diet studies of DIO and DR lines (32,
48, 49, 51), the current study examines offspring from very
early in life through midadulthood (P1–200 days), finds that
perinatal Western diet increases body weight and adiposity,
even in offspring of obesity-resistant DR dams, and identifies
early endocrine risk markers.
METHODS
Subjects. DR and DIO breeders, offspring of the original colonies
of DIO and DR rats bred by Levin and colleagues (50, 69), were born
at The Scripps Research Institute. Rats resided in wire-topped plastic

mal Care” and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and

Diet and breeding. At 46–47 days of age, female DR and DIO rats
were randomly divided into Western diet vs. chow diet conditions,
yielding four groups: DR-Chow (n � 28), DR-Western (n � 16),
DIO-Chow (n � 28), and DIO-Western (n � 16). Western diet dams
received a moderate-fat diet ad libitum [Research Diets D12266B,
32% fat, 51% carbohydrate (50% sucrose, 50% complex), 17%
protein; 4.41 kcal/g; 26% saturated, 27% monounsaturated and 47%
polyunsaturated fats, 8.5% kcal from saturated fat, New Brunswick,
NJ]. Chow dams received chow. The Western diet resembles the
dietary intake of adult American women in fat (32–33%), saturated fat
(10–11%), carbohydrate (50–53%), and protein (15–16%) propor-
tions (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad334.pdf).
After 54 days of diet exposure, during which food and body weight
were measured 3 times weekly, females were housed with males of
the same genotype. Males were removed following pregnancy con-
firmation; dams continued to receive their experimental diet until
weaning. The day of birth was termed postnatal day 0 (P0). Litters
were culled to eight pups (~1:1 sex ratio) at P1. All offspring were
weaned onto standard chow on P23.
Because only those DIO females that were comparatively resistant
to the Western diet produced offspring (see RESULTS), the DIO-
Western Group had selective attrition of obesity risk factors. Inter-
pretation of the DIO-Western offspring data is complicated by this
caveat, so we focus attention on the three other treatment groups in the
RESULTS and DISCUSSION.
Maternal blood collection. Just before mating, fasted (16 h during
lights on) dams were tail bled for prepregnancy hormone analysis.
After weaning, isoflurane-anesthetized dams were decapitated; trunk
blood was collected for postpregnancy hormone analysis. Blood was
collected into polypropylene tubes containing chilled 0.5 M EDTA
(10% vol.); plasma was isolated via centrifugation and stored at
�80°C.
Offspring blood and tissue collection. At postnatal days 1 (P1), 9
(P9), 16 (P16), and 23 (P23), anesthetized (CO2 inhalation) male
offspring were decapitated; brains were removed, snap frozen in
ice-cold isopentane, and stored at �80°C for DNA methylation
analysis. Trunk plasma was stored for hormone analysis. To avoid
litter effects (87), no more than one pup from a given litter was killed
at each age. To reduce confounding effects of litter size (43), litter size
was equated across experimental groups, with typically 8, 7, and 6
pups through P9, P16, and P23, respectively. Carcasses were stored at
�20°C for body composition analysis.
Fat pad and body composition analysis. Frozen carcasses were
shipped to the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where inguinal,
dorsal subcutaneous, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, gonadal, and whole-
body brown adipose tissue fat pads were weighed and returned to the
carcass for composition analysis. Total body water was determined by
drying to constant mass at 65°C. Fat and fat-free dry mass (FFDM)
were determined using Soxhlet extraction (25). Ash content was
determined by combusting FFDM at 600°C for a minimum of 8 h.
Body composition of adult, live offspring was measured via nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging (EchoMRI-1100, Software version
2008.01.18M, Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX), as previously
validated (40).
Hormones and metabolic markers. Plasma insulin, leptin, amylin,
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and adiponectin—key endocrine
regulators of energy homeostasis—were quantified by species-specific
microbead immunoassays per the manufacturer’s instructions
(RENDO-85K, RADPK-81K-ADPN) (EMD Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA) using a Luminex 100 IS (Luminex Corporation,
Austin, TX). All samples from a given age were analyzed on the same
plate. Insulin, leptin, amylin, and GLP-1 were quantified in multiplex;
adiponectin was assayed separately. Free plasma levels of triiodothy-
ronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) were quantified by competitive ELISA
(EIA-2385, EIA-2386; DRG International, Springfield, NJ). Nonest-
erified fatty acids (NEFA) and triglycerides were quantified by enzy-
matic colorimetric detection assays (SFA-1, STG-1-NC, Zen-Bio,
Chapel Hill, NC). Plasma glucose was quantified by glucose oxidation
assay (SKU 1200031002, Eton Bioscience, San Diego, CA).
Food intake. Home cage intake of dams and adult offspring was
determined using a scale of 0.1-g precision. Individual intake of
group-housed animals was estimated as total cage intake/number of
rats in the cage. Degrees of freedom were adjusted in the statistical
analyses.
Indirect calorimetry. Open-circuit indirect calorimetry was per-
formed (24 h) on acclimated (3 days), singly housed rats using a
Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System (Columbus
Instruments, Columbus, OH). Each clear chamber (32 � 20 � 19 cm)
had a water sipper, chow tray connected to a balance, plastic-mesh
floor, and 24 photobeams (2.5 cm apart, 9 and 14 cm above the floor).
Chamber exhaust was sampled every 10 min for 50 s through O2 and
CO2 sensors, from which oxygen consumption (V
˙ O2) and carbon
dioxide production (V
˙ CO2) were estimated. Sensors were precalibrated
with known concentrations of O2, CO2, and N2 (Praxair, Danbury,
CT). Respiratory quotient and energy expenditure were calculated as
in Zorrilla et al. (88). Energy expenditure was covariate-normalized
for lean mass (81).
DNA methylation. Whole hypothalamus was dissected from P1
brains. For P23 offspring, coronal brain sections (800 �M) were
sliced using a cryostat, and bilateral lateral hypothalamus was dis-
sected. DNA was extracted (DNA Masterpure DNA purification kit,
Epicenter, Madison, WI), and total DNA methylation was quantified
fluorometrically (Methylflash methylated DNA quantification kit,
Epigentek, Farmingdale, NY).
Statistics. Two-way ANOVA was used, with Genotype and Ma-
ternal Diet as between-subjects factors and cohort as a covariate; body
weight was a covariate for food intake and indirect calorimetry
measures. Pairwise comparisons were performed after Genotype �
Maternal Diet interactions. Because home cage intake of adult DIO-
Western offspring was not measured due to small sample size,
separate one-way ANOVAs tested effects of maternal diet (within DR
offspring) or genotype (within chow offspring) on adult food intake;
cohort was a covariate. Pregnancy outcome (births vs. no births) was
analyzed using �2-analyses. Pearson correlations related hormones to
body fat measures; significant differences between correlations were
identified using the Fisher r-to-z transformation. DIO-Western off-
spring were excluded from correlation analysis because too few rats
had both endocrine and fat pad data (n � 4 or 5). Litter was the unit
of analysis (87). To determine whether fat mass was disproportion-
ately increased relative to the rest of body mass, ANCOVA analysis
was used, covarying for lean mass or fat-free mass, as determined
from quantitative NMR or chemical analysis of body composition,
respectively. The ANCOVA method avoids the problems associated
with the ratio-based measure of % body fat (41). To stabilize variance,
carcass fat was log-transformed before ANCOVA analysis, and data
are presented after back-transformation. Relative (lean or fat-free
mass normalized) measures of fat mass are presented as the least
square means � SEs from ANCOVA analysis.

 DR dams during the 54 days of diet exposure (P � 0.001).
Western diet exposure increased prepregnancy body weight in
DIO, but not DR, rats [P � 0.03, Diet � Genotype: F(1,28) �
5.853]. Premating energy intake of a Western diet was not
greater than that of chow diet (effects involving diet, P �
0.20).
Western diet increased premating leptin levels in DIO [P �
0.03, F(1,22) � 5.595] but not DR dams [Diet � Genotype:
P � 0.05, F(1,22) � 4.202]. A genotype trend also reflected
greater premating leptin levels in DIO vs. DR dams [P � 0.07,
F(1,22) � 3.690]. There were no significant effects involving
Genotype or Diet on prepregnancy amylin, GLP-1, or insulin
levels (Table 1).
Pregnancy outcomes. Within 60 days of mate pairing, West-
ern diet-fed DIO females were less successful at producing a
litter than DR-Western females [43.4 vs. 93.8%, �2 (1) �
6.237, P � 0.013], a difference not significant in chow-fed
females (67.9 vs. 85.2%, P � 0.44). DIO-Western females that
failed to produce litters ate significantly more [66 vs. 59
kcal/day, P � 0.005, F(1,11) � 13.253] and descriptively
weighed more premating (296 g vs. 276 g) than successful
DIO-Western dams. Thus, the lower birth rate of DIO-Western
females may reflect obesity-related infertility (62). Rather than
preventing birth altogether as in the DIO line, Western diet
prolonged the number of days until birth from the onset of
mating in DR dams. DIO dams birthed heavier litters than DR
dams. The number of pups and sex ratio did not significantly
differ by genotype or diet (Table 1).
Maternal food intake, body weight, and endocrine measures
during and after pregnancy. As shown in Table 1, Western vs.
Chow diet dams did not differ in intake or weight gain during
pregnancy. Western diet dams weighed more the day after
parturition than chow dams [diet: P � 0.01, F(1,38) � 7.833],
however. With respect to genotype, DIO dams ate more [ge-
notype: P � 0.001, F(2,21) � 11.265] and gained more weight
during pregnancy than DR dams [P � 0.001, F(1,28) �
31.362] and also weighed more than DR dams through wean-
ing [Table 1, P � 0.001, F(1,35) � 26.638].
By weaning (P23), Western diet-fed dams lost more weight
than chow-fed dams [P � 0.05, F(1,19) � 5.813], and DIO dams
lost more weight than DR dams [P � 0.01, F(1,24) � 11.314]. At
weaning, irrespective of genotype, Western dams had increased
plasma levels of leptin [P � 0.01, F(1,33) � 7.70], NEFA, and
triglycerides [P � 0.001, F(1,30) � 12.29], and decreased levels
of free T3 [P � 0.05, F(1,31) � 14.40] vs. chow-fed dams.
Irrespective of diet, DIO dams had higher leptin [P � 0.001,
F(1,33) � 17.725] and triglyceride levels [P � 0.01, F(1,30) �
13.650], but not NEFA levels, than DR dams. There were no
effects involving genotype or diet on dam levels of amylin,
GLP-1, insulin, glucose, or free T4 at weaning (Table 1).
Thus, the Western diet impaired the reproduction and po-
tentiated the elevated weight gain and leptin and triglyceride
levels of DIO dams. In contrast, as desired, Western diet did
not increase body weight, weight gain, or caloric intake of DR
dams during pregnancy. Despite this, Western diet ultimately
decreased free T3 levels and increased maternal post-birth (P1)
weight, maternal weight loss across lactation, and circulating
leptin, triglyceride, and NEFA levels of DR dams by weaning.
Offspring body weight and composition. As shown in Fig. 1
and Tables 2 and 3, despite no excess weight gain or energy
intake in DR dams, maternal Western diet increased the adi-
posity of DR offspring from P1 through weaning.

 especially in the chow-fed condition. DIO pups had greater
absolute and relative carcass fat than DR pups [F(1, 22) �
4.533, P � 0.05] (Table 2). Accordingly, absolute and relative
subcutaneous and retroperitoneal white fat pad and brown
adipose tissue (BAT) weights were greater in DIO than DR
pups [F(1, 21) � 5.706, P � 0.05] (Fig. 1 and Table 3).
On P9, Western diet offspring were fatter than Chow off-
spring in both genotypes. Maternal Western diet increased the
pups’ absolute and relative carcass fat [P � 0.05, F(1, 35) �
5.046] (Table 2), as well as the absolute and relative weights of
subcutaneous, total visceral (mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and
gonadal), total nonvisceral, and total white fat pads [P � 0.05,
F(1, 32) � 3.791] (Fig. 1 and Table 3). Genotype effects
reflected that P9 DIO offspring were heavier [P � 0.01,
F(1,36) � 7.740] and had greater absolute fat [P � 0.05,
F(1,35) � 6.732] (Table 2) and absolute weights of inguinal,
subcutaneous, total visceral fat, total white fat pads, and BAT
[P � 0.05, F(1, 35)�5.567] (Table 3). Genotype differences in
relative fat measures approached, but did not reach, signifi-
cance (P � 0.06–0.07).
By P16, genotype effects had further diminished, whereas
Western diet effects had increased. Maternal Western diet in-
creased P16 offspring body weight [P � 0.05, F(1,31) � 4.250]
and absolute and relative carcass fat (P � 0.001, F(1, 30) �
14.471) (Table 2). Accordingly, Western diet increased the abso-
lute and relative weights of inguinal, subcutaneous, gonadal,
retroperitoneal, total visceral, total nonvisceral, and total white fat
pads [P � 0.05, F(1, 31) � 5.015] (Fig. 1 and Table 3). In
contrast, DIO offspring were no longer heavier or fatter overall
than DR animals (Table 2). Still, DIO pups had heavier absolute
retroperitoneal, BAT, and total visceral fat pads vs. DR pups [P �
0.05, F(1, 31) � 6.780] (Fig. 1 and Table 3).
At P23, Western diet offspring were heavier [P � 0.001,
F(1,47) � 44.220] than chow-fed offspring in both genotypes.
Though Western diet offspring had greater fat-free dry carcass
mass [P � 0.001, F(1,47) � 15.833], they also were fatter,
Fig. 1. Effect of maternal Western diet and genotype on preweanling body weight and adiposity of offspring from genetically diet-induced obesity (DIO)-prone and
diet-resistant (DR) lines. A: DIO pups weighed more than DR pups at P1. B: chemical analysis of body composition showed that DIO-Chow pups have greater relative
adiposity (fat mass normalized for fat-free mass) than DR-Chow pups, and maternal Western diet selectively increased adiposity of DR pups to the higher levels of DIO
pups at P1. C: DIO pups weighed more than DR pups at P1 and P9; by P16, Western diet offspring were heavier in both genotypes thereafter, with DIO-Western offspring
heaviest at P23. D: maternal Western diet selectively increased relative adiposity only in DR pups at P1 but comparably increased relative adiposity of both genotypes
thereafter through P23. E: at P1, DIO pups had disproportionately heavier subcutaneous, retroperitoneal and total white fat pads than DR pups. F: At P9, maternal
Western diet offspring had disproportionately heavier inguinal, subcutaneous, retroperitoneal, and total white fat pads than chow offspring. DIO genotype pups also had
disproportionately heavier subcutaneous and total white fat pads than DR pups. At P16 (G) and P23 (H), maternal Western diet offspring had disproportionately heavier
inguinal, subcutaneous, gonadal, retroperitoneal, total visceral, total nonvisceral, and total white fat pads than chow offspring. Data are expressed as means � SE n �

 with increased total and relative carcass fat [P � 0.001, F(1,
46) � 171.594] (Table 2) and disproportionately heavier in-
guinal, subcutaneous, BAT, gonadal, retroperitoneal, total vis-
ceral, total nonvisceral, and total white fat pads (P � 0.001,
F(1, 46) � 22.924) (Fig. 1 and Table 3).
Offspring leptin, insulin, adiponectin, amylin, and GLP-1
levels. Table 4 shows genotype effects on energy regulatory
hormone levels throughout the preweanling period, whereas
Western diet effects did not appear until P23.
On P1, DIO pups had higher plasma amylin [P � 0.01,
F(1,34) � 7.774], GLP-1 [P � 0.05, F(1,33) � 7.185], leptin
[F(1,29) � 4.420], insulin [P � 0.005, F(1,32) � 9.347], and
adiponectin [P � 0.005, F(1,31) � 10.243] than did DR
offspring.
On P9, DIO offspring continued to show higher plasma
GLP-1 [P � 0.005, F(1,12) � 11.613] and leptin [P � 0.001,
F(1,13) � 18.714] than DR offspring. Maternal Western diet
increased plasma leptin only in DIO offspring to levels exceed-
ing all other groups [Genotype � Diet: P � 0.005, F(1,13) �
12.274].
By P16, genotype effects for GLP-1 and adiponectin had
reversed in direction from younger ages. GLP-1 levels, which
were higher in DIO than DR offspring on P1 and P9, now
trended higher in DR offspring at P16 [P � 0.06, F(1,24) �
3.910]. Similarly, adiponectin levels, which had been greater in
DIO than DR offspring on P1, were now higher in DR than
DIO offspring on P16 [P � 0.05, F(1,16) � 6.966]. DIO pups
continued to show higher plasma leptin than DR pups [P �
0.05, F(1,22) � 5.002].
By P23, maternal Western diet effects appeared. Western
diet offspring of both genotypes showed higher plasma insulin
[diet: P � 0.001, F(1,28) � 19.209], adiponectin [P � 0.001,
F(1,30) � 43.069] and leptin [P � 0.005, F(1,24) � 11.986]
than Chow offspring. In addition, plasma leptin [genotype: P �
0.001, F(1,24) � 14.266] and insulin [P � 0.05, F(1,28) �
4.298] were greater in DIO than DR pups. Despite similar body
weight and adiposity at this age, DIO-Chow pups had 80% and
38% higher levels of leptin and insulin, respectively, than
DR-Chow weanlings (Table 4). Genotype � Diet interactions
reflected that Western diet increased amylin [P � 0.05, F(1,27) �
6.252] and GLP-1 [P � 0.05, F(1,27) � 6.060] levels in DIO
offspring, while reducing levels in DR offspring.
Endocrine-adiposity correlations. As shown in Fig. 2, ma-
ternal Western diet also disrupted otherwise seen relations of
endocrine measures to adiposity. Specifically, GLP-1 levels
correlated negatively with total carcass fat in DR-Chow off-

 spring [r (7) � �0.83, P � 0.05], but positively with carcass
fat in both DIO-Chow [r (11) � 0.74, P � 0.01] and DR-
Western offspring [r (7) � 0.662] (Fig. 2).
Furthermore, plasma leptin normally correlated positively
with subcutaneous [r (28) � 0.52, P � 0.005] and total white
fat pads [r (28) � 0.57, P � 0.005] across offspring. Such
correlations were evident in DIO-Chow (r � 0.53, 0.47) and
DR-Chow (r � 0.74, 0.60), but not DR-Western (r � 0.05,
0.02), offspring (Fig. 2). Similarly, insulin levels normally
correlated positively with visceral fat pad mass across all
offspring [r (32) � 0.62, P � 0.005], and in both DIO-Chow
(r � 0.44) and DR-Chow groups (r � 0.48). Maternal Western
diet, instead, produced an inverse relation of insulin with
visceral fat pad mass in DR-Western offspring (r � �0.53)
(not shown). Finally, across all weanlings, plasma adiponectin
correlated positively with fat measures (r � 0.51–0.79, P �
0.01). A positive relationship was seen with relative carcass fat
in DR-Chow [r (12) � 0.76] and DIO-Chow [r (11) � 0.79],
but not DR-Western [r (9) � �0.45] offspring.
Maternal leptin and weight loss predict offspring body
weight, adiposity and endocrine status. As noted previously,
Western dams lost more weight from the day before birth to
weaning and showed greater postweaning leptin levels than
chow-fed dams. Dams with greater leptin levels had heavier
weanlings with more subcutaneous fat [r (35) � 0.44 and 0.46,
P � 0.01]. Dams with greater weight loss at weaning had
heavier weanlings [r (39) � 0.43, P � 0.01] with higher
plasma leptin [r (27) � 0.47, P � 0.05].
Adult body weight and composition. All offspring were
weaned onto chow. By day 37, there were no effects of
genotype or diet on body weight. At 2 mo of age, DIO
offspring were heavier than DR offspring, but only DIO-
Western offspring were disproportionately fatter than DR-
Western offspring, with no difference in normalized fat be-
tween DIO-Chow and DR-Chow (Table 5). In contrast, at 150
days of age, maternal Western diet offspring of both genotypes
were heavier [Diet: P � 0.001, F(1,51) � 16.900] and dispro-
portionately fatter [P � 0.009, F(1,51) � 7.315] than maternal
Chow diet offspring (Fig. 3).
Food intake. Within the week after weaning (P25–P30),
DR-Western offspring showed greater 2-day chow intake
(means � SE: 23.4 � 0.9 kcal/day) than did DR-Chow
offspring (19.7 � 0.9 kcal/day) [P � 0.05, F(1,6) � 8.696].
Figure 3 shows that mid-adult (P150--P160) DR-Western off-
spring also ate ~10 kcal/day more chow in their home cages (or
14%) than did DR-Chow offspring [P � 0.05, F(1,18) �
5.379].
In terms of genotype, mid-adult DIO-Chow rats ate ~17
kcal/day more chow (25%) than did mid-adult DR-Chow
offspring [P � 0.001, F(1,22) � 17.449] in their home cages
(Fig. 3). Cosinor analysis revealed that adult DIO offspring had
a greater amplitude, MESOR [P � 0.05, F(1,16) � 8.1] and
peak [P � 0.01, F(1,16) � 15.873] of their circadian rhythm of
feeding than DR offspring (Table 6).
Energy expenditure. Maternal Western diet did not alter the
total daily energy expenditure or respiratory quotient of wean-
lings (P25–P30). However, cosinor analysis revealed that the
daily rhythm of DR-Western offspring energy expenditure did
have a lower nadir [P � 0.05, F(1,5) � 6.689] and greater
amplitude [P � 0.01, F(1,5) � 21.620] at this age (Table 6).
By 2–3 mo of age, before maternal Western diet offspring
weighed more or were fatter than chow-fed offspring, maternal
Western diet offspring of both genotypes expended less energy
during the dark cycle than controls (Fig. 4A), leading to
reduced daily energy expenditure. DIO-Western energy expen-
diture was even lower than that of DR-Western offspring.
Respiratory quotient was higher for young adult DR-Western
than DR-Chow offspring (Fig. 4B). As shown in Table 6,

DNA methylation. Consistent with the presence of epigenetic
changes in energy balance circuitry, at P1, maternal Western
diet and DIO genotype each independently reduced global
DNA methylation in the hypothalamus [P � 0.05, F(1, 17) �
6.17] (Fig. 5). At P23, there was no effect of maternal Western
diet in DR offspring, and there were too few DIO offspring
samples to be included in the analysis.
DISCUSSION
The present study shows that a maternal Western diet envi-
ronment can promote offspring obesity in rats, even when the
mother shows little overt effect of the diet. Maternal Western
diet increased offspring body weight and adiposity, including
visceral fat, not only in obesity-prone DIO rats, but also in
offspring of obesity-resistant DR dams. Thus, maternal West-
ern diet partly overrode the offspring’s genetic resistance to
diet-induced obesity. Increased obesity in offspring has previ-
ously been reported following maternal exposure to high-fat
and/or energy-dense diets (46, 52, 60). Teratogenic effects
typically have been attributed to maternal overnutrition or
obesity (e.g., 32, 49). Here, in contrast, we show in rats that
exposure to a typical Western diet alone can produce metabolic
changes in the offspring that promote obesity, despite the
mother showing normal energy intake, body weight, and preg-
nancy weight gain. Thus, maternal Western diet covertly “pro-
grammed” adiposity risk in offspring of genetically resistant
mothers.
While DR maternal Western diet dams did not show greater
energy intake, prepregnancy body weight, or leptin levels, or
weight gain during pregnancy, they were distinguishable by
several more covert characteristics. DR-Western dams had
greater weight the day after birth, greater weight loss during
the lactation period, higher levels of leptin, triglycerides, and
NEFA at weaning, and lower free T3 at weaning. High-fat-fed
mouse dams expend more energy lactating than low-fat-fed
dams (33), which may explain the increased weight loss during
lactation in DR-Western dams. Elevated maternal circulating
levels of leptin, triglycerides and NEFA in utero and/or during
lactation may have developmentally affected DR-Western off-
spring by programming them for greater fat accumulation
and/or leptin resistance (19, 36, 53, 79). For example, high
maternal leptin levels may have disrupted offspring thyroid
function or development (63, 64), leading to reduced metabolic
rate later in life. The increased maternal weight loss through
lactation may indicate greater transfer of energy or markers of

 lipid metabolism to the suckling pups, thereby altering off-
spring development.
Early and latent effects of maternal diet. The overt effects of
maternal Western diet on offspring followed a discontinuous
time course in otherwise obesity-resistant rats. That is, effects
of maternal Western diet on body weight and adiposity went
away during adolescence (P37) and early adulthood (P60). Yet,
indirect calorimetry at 2–3 mo of age, when Western offspring
showed normal body weight and body composition, revealed a
latent metabolic vulnerability (68, 89) of decreased daily en-
ergy expenditure and lipid utilization, and weanling Western
offspring also ate more food. Subsequently, by midadulthood
(P150), maternal Western diet offspring still ate more and
again weighed more and were fatter than controls. Similarly,
Howie et al. (37) found that offspring of rat dams fed a high-fat
diet during pregnancy and lactation were normal weight during
adolescence but became overweight by adulthood (37). In
nonhuman primates, maternal high-fat diet was associated with
high-body fat percentage in offspring at 6 mo of age but not 12
mo of age (65). The results resonate with findings in humans
that overweight (74) and weight gain (7) in childhood predict
adult obesity. They suggest, however, that a battle with over-
weight may remain ahead even if children “thin out” during
adolescence and young adulthood, times of rapid growth,
because latent, early programmed metabolic vulnerabilities
persist. Further studies on the time course of weight gain could
aid in the treatment of human obesity.
Maternal diet effects on endocrine profile and energy
expenditure. Early Western diet, independent of maternal obe-
sity or overeating, increased leptin, insulin, and adiponectin
levels in weanlings of both genotypes. The hyperinsulinemia
and hyperleptinemia observed in Western offspring resembles
findings from previous studies (32); the present study showed
that these differences are not seen very early in life (P1, P9),
and, contrary to previous interpretations, do not depend upon
maternal obesity or excess caloric intake because they were
seen in DR offspring. The results support the hypothesis that
the endocrine triad of hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, and
hyperadiponectinemia early in life predicts increased vulnera-
bility for later weight gain and obesity (42, 72). In adulthood,
adiponectin, an adipocytokine known for its insulin-sensitizing
properties, correlates inversely with fat mass. In human infants
up to 4 mo of age, however, cord and serum adiponectin levels
correlate positively with body weight (20, 45, 78) and adiposity
(78), gradually changing to negative correlations as infants
become toddlers and young children (22, 80). In the current
study, a positive relation between adiponectin levels and adi-
posity was observed in weanlings (P23), suggesting that the
regulation of circulating adiponectin levels in rat weanlings
may more resemble that of human infants than of young
children. This is consistent with the observation that rat brain
growth at P23 is developmentally comparable to human brain
growth at 5 mo of age (86). Leptin levels normally peak
between P7 and P10 in rat neonates (3), and leptin antagonism
during the neonatal period influences long-term body weight
and composition (12). At P1, P16, and P23, Western diet
offspring of both genotypes tend to have higher leptin levels
than their chow diet counterparts. However, at P9, a time when
leptin levels normally peak, DR-Western offspring have lower
leptin levels than all other groups. While leptin levels cannot
be compared across ages due to interplate variability, the
results suggest a potential disruption of the normal leptin peak
in DR-Western offspring. Perhaps the atypical leptin profile of
DR-Western offspring as compared with other groups during
this critical developmental period contributed to their increased
adiposity later in life.
Maternal Western diet also disrupted the normal relations of
several energy regulatory hormones (GLP-1, leptin, insulin,
adiponectin) with adipose measures. In chow-fed weanlings of

ning from weaning. Food intake is the average daily intake across 7 days of

 both genotypes, plasma leptin and insulin correlated positively
with subcutaneous and visceral fat pad mass, respectively,
consistent with findings in young children (6, 29, 54). In
contrast, these putative adiposity signals (13) were no longer
positively correlated with fat pad measures in Western diet
offspring, suggesting disruption of the hormones’ regulatory
relations. Similarly, maternal Western diet eliminated genotype
differences that otherwise were seen in the correlations of
amylin and GLP-1 with body fat. Specifically, levels of the
incretin gut hormone GLP-1 correlated positively with total
carcass fat in chow-fed DIO weanlings, but negatively in DR
weanlings.
Maternal Western diet reduced offspring whole body energy
expenditure and relative utilization of lipid as a fuel substrate,
but the physiological mechanisms for these effects remain to be
determined. Changes in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are
plausible candidates, and future studies can address this by
examining AMPK phosphorylation/activation, lipoprotein
lipase activity, or mitochondrial bioenergetics in relevant tis-
sue.
Comparison to previous studies. The present findings super-
ficially appear to contrast from previous reports that maternal
Western diet increases body weight and adiposity and alters
endocrine profiles only in DIO and not DR offspring (32, 51).
A key procedural difference between studies is that dams in the
present study were fed the Western diet for almost 8 wk before
mating, beginning from adolescence; those in previous studies
received the diet for only 4 wk from young adulthood. Other
procedural differences here include the use of more dams to
reduce litter effects (87) and litter sizes of 6–8, rather than 10,
pups across lactation (21). Finally, and perhaps most relevant,
offspring in the previous studies were examined from 4 to 16
wk of age. At similar ages in the present study (37, 60, and 90
days) maternal Western diet likewise did not alter offspring
body weight or adiposity. Rather, diet effects were evident
throughout the preweanling period (P1–P23), consistent with
previous findings in P16 DR offspring (32), and not again until
mid-adulthood (150 days). Thus, overt effects of the Western
diet in adult DR offspring may have been missed in previous
studies due to their time course across development.
Time course of vulnerability to maternal diet. To model
societal conditions, Western diet was provided to adolescent
dams before mating, as well as during pregnancy and lactation.
Therefore, it is not clear which time period of dietary exposure
is critical for the present outcomes. Maternal diet influenced
morphometric measures by P1 in DR offspring, suggesting a
prenatal action. On the other hand, a postnatal action may
contribute because diet-related differences in offspring body
weight, adiposity, and regulatory hormones became more
prominent postnatally. Differences grew from P1 to P16, dur-
ing which offspring nutrition was derived almost exclusively
from breast milk, and from P16 to P23, during which pups
increasingly consume the home cage diet (35). Breast milk of
obese DIO dams has abnormal fatty acid composition and
increased insulin levels (67), high-fat diet dams spend more
time nursing than chow-fed dams, and milk from high-fat diet
dams is higher in fat, protein, and overall nutritional content
than the milk of chow dams (11, 67). Offspring of high-fat
dams in another study showed no differences in suckling
behavior compared with chow offspring (44), but it is not
known whether there were group differences in suckling be-
havior in the current study, which may have affected offspring
endocrine levels. High-fat dam offspring consume more milk
per kilogram of body weight (67, 77) and have greater relative
fat mass and increased preweaning leptin levels (73). As
offspring can absorb leptin and insulin from breast milk,
hormonal changes in breast milk may help regulate offspring
adiposity. Indeed, a previous cross-fostering study in outbred
rodents showed that a postnatal high-fat diet promoted off-
spring adiposity more than a prenatal high-fat diet (31). DIO-
and DR-Western dams had elevated blood leptin levels at
weaning, which may indicate elevated breast milk leptin lev-
els. Western diet dams of both genotypes also had increased
body weight the day after giving birth, and in humans and
nonhuman primates, maternal size is related to concentrations
of several bioactive factors in breast milk, including adiponec-

 tin (5, 14). In humans, adiponectin and leptin are present in
breast milk and correlate directly with measures of offspring
growth and adiposity at 1–2 yr of age (18, 82, 85). Offspring of
high-fat-fed rat dams consume solid food earlier and in greater
quantity than offspring of chow-fed dams (44), which may
further contribute to offspring hormone and adiposity differ-
ences. Still, effects that first emerge late in the postnatal period
might reflect in utero or even preconception epigenetic pro-
gramming. Cross-fostering and embryo transplant studies can
resolve these uncertainties (27, 31) to allow identification of
programming molecular mechanisms.
Genotype differences in dams and pups. Two sets of geno-
type differences in dams merit further discussion. First, DIO
dams ate more, weighed more before pregnancy, gained more
weight during pregnancy, lost more weight across lactation,
and had higher plasma leptin than did DR dams. Each of these
factors might contribute to the obesity risk of their offspring
above and beyond genomic modes of transmission. Second,
Western diet selectively impaired the ability of DIO females to
reproduce, especially in dams that ate more and had higher
leptin levels, potentially representing a model of obesity infer-

 tility (62). Paternal phenotype also may have contributed to the
observed genotype differences (30, 59). Paternal lineage and
associated obesity risk were an intended part of the offspring
genotype.
Genotype differences in the early adiposity and endocrine
profiles of chow-fed DIO vs. DR preweanlings also merit
mention, because they may mark genetic risk for adult obesity.
On P1 and P9, DIO pups were heavier and fatter than DR pups,
differences that were associated with greater amylin, GLP-1,
leptin, insulin, and adiponectin levels. At P16, a transition was
evident. DIO pups were no longer heavier or overall fatter than
DR pups and showed lower GLP-1 and adiponectin levels than
DR offspring. By the time pups were weaned, chow-reared
DIO and DR pups were indistinguishable from one another in
body weight and adiposity, yet DIO offspring remained hyper-
leptinemic and hyperinsulinemic. As adolescents (P37), chow-
fed DIO rats still showed similar body weights to DR rats, but,
by young adulthood (2–3 mo), DIO rats ate more, weighed
more and were fatter than DR rats. The remitting-relapsing
time course of overweight and fattiness in the obesity-prone
DIO line, like that induced by maternal Western diet, rein-
forces the concept that overt morphometric and endocrine
markers of obesity risk can be detected very early in life, but
may normalize during growth to puberty or adolescence, be-
fore manifesting as increased obesity risk in adulthood. Both
the inherited and Western-diet induced forms of increased
obesity risk were associated with hyperinsulinemia and hyper-
leptinemia at weaning, supporting the hypothesis that early
postnatal resistance to leptin or insulin may foreshadow adult
obesity (42, 72).
Possible epigenetic mechanism. Epigenetic modifications to
the genome may mediate the effects of maternal diet on
offspring outcome. Early-life environment can program indi-
viduals for neurodevelopmental disorders and obesity (8), and
changes in DNA methylation can increase risk for metabolic
disorders by altering the expression of energy regulatory
genes (9). Indeed, the primate epigenome is altered by
maternal high-fat diet (1), and epigenetic modifications to
circadian rhythm-related genes can alter energy expenditure
(75). In the present study, global DNA methylation levels
were reduced in the hypothalamus of P1 offspring by both
maternal Western diet and DIO genotype, suggestive of
major neurodevelopmental effects in this region. The hypo-
thalamus is a key brain region for the control of energy
expenditure and food intake. The lateral hypothalamus
(LH), in particular, is important for integration of feeding
signals and maintenance of energy balance (15). Neurons in
the LH sense available glucose and insulin, respond to gut
hormones such as ghrelin, and receive input from leptin-
producing neurons in the arcuate nucleus. It contains dis-
tinct populations of orexin/hypocretin neurons and melanin-
concentrating hormone neurons (76), both of which regulate
food intake and thermogenesis. The lateral hypothalamus, a
key node in the regulation of energy homeostasis, recipro-
cally connects to other hypothalamic nuclei that subserve
the control of food intake and energy intake, as well as the
caudal hindbrain (15). Accordingly, neurons in the lateral
hypothalamus abundantly express known regulators of en-
ergy balance, including leptin receptors, melanin-concen-
trating hormone, and orexin (10, 47, 55, 76). Ongoing
studies in our laboratory are examining the effects of ma-
ternal Western diet on the expression and methylation of
specific genes in the lateral hypothalamus that may modu-
late obesity risk.
Perspectives and Significance
Current obstetric practice and popular guidelines emphasize
screening for overweight, body mass index, pregnancy weight
gain, glucose intolerance, or gestational diabetes. The present
findings indicate that, in the rat, a maternal high-fat, high-
carbohydrate diet leads to metabolic changes in the off-
spring that may promote increased adiposity, even while the
body weight, weight gain, energy intake, and fasting insulin
status of the mother appear normal. The results emphasize
the importance of diet per se. Offspring of Western diet
dams are obese early in life, “thin out” during adolescence,
and then gain more body weight and fat as adults than
offspring of Chow diet dams. Additional research is needed
to identify ranges and types of maternal dietary fat and
carbohydrate in humans that are not associated with in-
creased offspring adiposity. Further research can also iden-
tify critical prenatal and postnatal time periods during which
maternal diet has the greatest effects on offspring outcome.
Nutritional counseling should be standard care for all pro-
spective and lactating mothers, not only those showing signs
of overweight or metabolic disturbance.
