 For millennia, cannabis has been used medically and for 
religious purposes, most notably in China and India. The 
plant and its many constituent cannabinoids are now 
becoming increasingly important in modern medicine, 
particularly in the treatment of chronic pain and spas 
ticity1. 
A much more widespread global use is for pleasure2: the 
‘stoned’ experience varies widely across individuals but 
often includes euphoria, a heightened awareness of music 
and colour, and the tendencies to eat a lot and to giggle 
profusely2. Despite its pleasurable effects, most scientific 
research has focused on adverse consequences of using 
the drug, such as addiction, cognitive impairment and a 
possible increased risk of psychotic illness3,4.
How patterns of use will change as the legalization of 
cannabis proliferates is not known, but even a small per‑
centage increase in the current 182 million users world‑
wide5 will mean a considerable surge in absolute numbers. 
Are we now able to use existing evidence about the less 
desirable effects of cannabis use to help us to look forward 
to the future?
This Review aims to survey our current state of knowl‑
edge about, and then pinpoint how we should be increas‑
ing our understanding of, the effects of cannabis, given 
its potentially soaring future use. We first summarize 
the variety of unique ingredients in cannabis and out‑
line how its use affects cognition, learning and memory 
in the short and long term. We survey evidence of how 
the effects of the drug vary according to the maturational 
state of the brain and then go on to discuss cannabis 
addiction and the mental health problems that are often 
related to it. Finally, we identify the important gaps in our 
current knowledge and look to the future in terms of both 
research and the current tide of changes to the legislation 
of cannabis.
Cannabis: a plant with many forms
The multitude of names for cannabis (such as Purple 
Haze, Northern Lights, charas, skunk, resin, grass, 
marijuana and weed) in part reflects variations in 
genetics, growing conditions, processing, and constit‑
uent cannabinoids and terpenoids in different strains 
of the plant. Of the roughly 100 unique ingredients in 
cannabis that are called cannabinoids, most research to 
date has focused on the two most prominent of these: 
Δ9‑tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9‑THC) and cannabidiol 
(CBD). These two compounds seem to have a range of 
opposing effects on the human brain and behaviour. For 
example, Δ9‑THC acutely impairs learning, produces 
psychosis‑like effects and increases anxiety6, whereas 
CBD can enhance learning7 and has antipsychotic8 and 
anti‑anxiety9 properties in humans. When taken together, 
CBD may ameliorate the harmful effects of Δ9‑THC10,11.
Δ9‑THC acts as a partial agonist at cannabinoid 1 
receptors (CB1Rs), whereas CBD has a complex range 
of pharmacological actions. For example, although 
CBD has low affinity for CB1R, it can attenuate CB1R 
agonist effects in the brain even at low concentrations 
(that is, providing functional antagonism of CB1R 
signalling)12. Conversely, CBD reduces the cellular 
re 
uptake and hydrolysis of the endogenous cannabin‑
oid (‘endocannabinoid’ (eCB)) anandamide (AEA; also 
known as N‑arachidonylethanolamide) in the brain12,13.

Cannabis, cognition and addiction

Abstract | In an increasing number of states and countries, cannabis now stands poised to join 
alcohol and tobacco as a legal drug. Quantifying the relative adverse and beneficial effects of 
cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids should therefore be prioritized. Whereas newspaper 
headlines have focused on links between cannabis and psychosis, less attention has been paid 
to the much more common problem of cannabis addiction. Certain cognitive changes have also 
been attributed to cannabis use, although their causality and longevity are fiercely debated. 
Identifying why some individuals are more vulnerable than others to the adverse effects of 
cannabis is now of paramount importance to public health. Here, we review the current state 
of knowledge about such vulnerability factors, the variations in types of cannabis, and the 
relationship between these and cognition and addiction.

 Neuroimaging studies have documented opposing 
effects of Δ9‑THC and CBD on blood oxygenation level‑ 
dependent (BOLD) signals during performance of 
 
several cognitive and emotional tasks, including the stri‑
atal response during memory retrieval and the amygdala 
response to fearful faces14.
Over the past two decades, the Δ9‑THC content of 
street cannabis has risen dramatically, whereas its CBD 
content has decreased to negligible levels. For example, 
in the United States, the Δ9‑THC content of street can‑
nabis rose from 4% in 1995 to 12% in 2014 (REF. 15). In 
Europe16,17 and Australia18, high‑potency cannabis con‑
taining ~15% Δ9‑THC and less than 0.1% CBD now dom‑
inates the market. Thus, the type of cannabis available 
years ago differs considerably from that sold today, lim‑
iting the relevance of older longitudinal cohort studies 
(for example, the New Zealand birth cohort study; see 
BOX 1) to the mental health and cognitive function of 
contemporary users. In the United States, the cannabis 
that the National Institute of Drug Abuse supplies to 
researchers for experiments generally has less than 4% 
Δ9‑THC, and so findings from these experiments have 
limited implications for modern‑day cannabis users.

Box 1 | Does cannabis affect IQ or educational attainment?
Case–control and prospective cohort studies have found associations between cannabis use and both lower IQ and lower 
educational attainment. But do these associations reflect any causal relationships?
Does cannabis affect IQ?
To date, there have been three large prospective cohort studies that have assessed the relationship between cannabis 
use and IQ.
In a New Zealand birth cohort study of 1,037 38‑year‑old individuals born in 1972 or 1973, persistent cannabis 
dependence was associated with a decline of up to 6 IQ points from that measured at the age of 7–13 years54. The decline 
was particularly evident for those who developed cannabis dependence in adolescence, and remained apparent even for 
those who, at the age of 38 years, used cannabis less than once a week.
By contrast, a UK birth cohort study of 2,235 15–16‑year‑old adolescents born in 1991 or 1992 found that cumulative 
cannabis use was not associated with a lower IQ compared with non‑using controls when IQ measured pre‑teen 
and various potential confounders (in particular, the adolescents’ use of cigarettes and alcohol) were taken into 
account163. However, cannabis use was relatively low in this study, with only 72 adolescents reporting more than 50 
lifetime cannabis exposures.
A US prospective cohort study of 3,066 17–20‑year‑old individuals found no difference in IQ from that measured at the 
age of 9–12 years between monozygotic and dizygotic twins discordant for cannabis use164. However, there were only 
47 discordant twin pairs in which the cannabis-using twin had used cannabis frequently (more than 30 cumulative uses, 
and/or daily use), limiting the strength of any conclusions from this study.
The UK and US studies therefore both suggest that genetic or environmental factors drive the observed associations 
between lower IQ and cannabis use, although both cohorts included younger participants with fewer cannabis exposures 
than did the New Zealand study.
To date, all studies have relied on retrospective self‑report of cannabis use, have ignored possible residual effects of 
the drug on IQ test performance and have not addressed the potency or variety of cannabis used (see the main article). 
Addressing these issues with confirmation of exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and other cannabinoids 
(such as cannabidiol (CBD)) using hair samples from participants may lead to more reliable and consistent findings165.
Does cannabis use affect educational attainment?
Several case–control and longitudinal studies have provided fairly consistent evidence of associations between 
adolescent cannabis use and both early school leaving and poorer educational performance166–169. But the mechanisms 
producing these relationships remain hotly debated170.
Causal explanations have posited that heavy cannabis use results in cognitive and/or motivational deficits, which in 
turn result in poorer educational attainment. There are many anecdotes about an ‘amotivational syndrome’ resulting 
from heavy cannabis use, and a recent positron emission tomography study demonstrated that cannabis users had 
reductions in striatal dopamine synthesis that correlated with a measure of amotivation171.
Alternatively, reverse causality has been also suggested; that is, perhaps poorer educational attainment leads to 
cannabis use166,168. However, the one study that addressed this hypothesis showed that the association between early 
school leaving and later cannabis use could be accounted for by cannabis use before leaving school early166.
The other alternative is that educational attainment and cannabis use may not be causally related but instead share 
common risk factors168,170,172. Reported associations between cannabis use and lower educational attainment have 
typically been robust to adjustment for some potential confounders such as early‑life factors, baseline school 
performance or cognitive ability, social disadvantage and parental educational achievement167,169. However, the potential 
role of teenage behaviours that typically occur alongside cannabis use — including use of other substances and other 
‘risky’ behaviours such as truancy — remain relatively unexplored163,170.
Recent analyses showed that adjusting for teenage use of other substances attenuated the association between 
cannabis use and school attainment163,173,174. As such, the existence of unmeasured confounds is often posited to account 
for the negative associations with cannabis163,168,170. Indeed, this idea is strongly supported by recent genetic studies that 
found no difference in early school leaving170 or years of education175 between both monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs 
who were discordant for cannabis use170,175.

in a range of physiological processes including reward, 
motivation, emotional homeostasis, pain processing, and 
synaptic plasticity that contributes to learning and mem‑
ory. At present, the best‑characterized eCBs are AEA and 
2‑arachidonoylglycerol (2‑AG)21,22, and both of these 
lipids exert agonist activity at CB1Rs and CB2Rs. Owing 
to their lipid nature, AEA and 2‑AG are not stored in ves‑
icles but are synthesized on an ‘on‑ 
demand’ basis and, as 
such, brain eCB levels are critically reliant on the balance 
between evoked biosynthesis and subsequent clearance 
by intracellular enzyme‑mediated hydrolysis. eCBs 
are crucial in certain forms of neuronal plasticity, and 
Δ9‑THC has been shown to disrupt long-term potentiation 
(LTP; a model for learning and memory) and long-term 
depression (LTD) in preclinical studies23. In this section, 
we consider the acute and longer‑term effects of canna‑
bis on cognition, learning and memory, as well as effects 
potentially persisting after an individual has stopped 
using the drug. We also review evidence on the impact of 
starting cannabis use early in adolescence.
Acute effects. Acute effects are transient and seen in 
the time period during which the individual is intoxi‑
cated with the drug (that is, feeling ‘stoned’ for around 
5–120 minutes when smoked). A single dose of can‑
nabis or its main active ingredient Δ9‑THC robustly 
and dose‑dependently impairs working and episodic 
memory24,25. Memory impairments occur however the 
drug is administered, but the onset of effect is more 
rapid when it is inhaled or given intravenously than 
when it is ingested orally. Specifically, the encoding of 
new memories is impaired during cannabis intoxication, 
and this leads to subsequent deficits in recalling these 
memories; by contrast, the retrieval of old memories 
that were consolidated when not under the influence is 
unaffected. Cannabis‑induced deficits in working memory 
are seen more in the ability to manipulate information 
while it is ‘online’ (for example, when doing mental 
arithmetic) than in the ability to simply retain informa‑
tion for brief periods (for example, when remembering 
a telephone number before dialling it). Whereas on pla‑
cebo, brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) increases linearly with the working memory 
load of a task, acute dosing with Δ9‑THC prevents this 
load‑associated increase in DLPFC activity26.
These effects on memory are consistent with the 
extensive preclinical evidence of: the amnestic effects 
of cannabis in animal models; the high density of can‑
nabinoid receptors in memory‑associated brain regions 
such as the hippocampus, amygdala and PFC (FIG. 1); and 
observations that Δ9‑THC induces disruption of plas‑
ticity (including LTP and LTD) in the hippocampus and 
decreases acetylcholine release in both the hippocampus 
and the PFC (FIG. 2a).
Some studies report acute Δ9‑THC‑induced impair‑
ment of behavioural inhibition and increases in impuls‑
ivity, but findings on attention, decision‑making and 
risk‑taking tasks are mixed and task dependent25,27. 
There is also some evidence that acute effects may 
vary depending on an individual’s previous level of 
use of the drug. Tolerance to the memory‑impairing28 
and psychomotor29 effects of acute Δ9‑THC have been 
shown in individuals who use cannabis more than once 
a week, probably reflecting downregulation of cortical 
CB1Rs30,31 (FIG. 2b).
There is some evidence that acute effects of canna‑
bis on memory depend on the particular type of can‑
nabis ingested. Smoking cannabis with higher levels of 
CBD protected regular users against the acute memory‑ 
impairing effects of Δ9‑THC10. Findings in cannabis‑ 
using volunteers replicated these protective effects of 
CBD on Δ9‑THC‑induced acute memory impairment11. 
Indeed, CBD alone has been shown to enhance fear 
extinction learning in humans7. This further supports 
the notion that CBD and Δ9‑THC may have oppos‑
ing effects on some of the neural substrates of human 
memory32. A recent cross‑sectional study found that 
CBD appeared to protect against hippocampal volume

reward-, habit- and cognition-related circuits. 
A simplified conceptualization of the major circuits 
implicated in reward (namely, the ventral tegmental 
area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc)200 and ventral 
pallidum (VP))65,66,201, stimulus–response habit formation 
(the dorsolateral striatum (dlStr) and globus pallidus (GP))67 
and cognition (the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus 
(HIPP) and amygdalar regions). Among these regions, 
cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) are expressed with the 
following order of density202–206: HIPP ≈ basolateral 
amygdala (BLA) ≈ PFC > VP ≈ GP ≈ dorsolateral striatum 
(dlStr) > NAc > VTA ≈ bed nucleus of the stria terminalis 
(BNST) > central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Within the 
amygdala, CB1R expression is highest in the lateral and 
basolateral nuclei, with substantially lower expression in 
the central nucleus205. In the dorsal striatum, there is a 
comparable medial–lateral gradient of CB1R expression, 
with greater levels of expression evident in lateral aspects, 
and comparatively lesser CB1R expression is observed in 
the NAc206. The dense CB1R expression in HIPP
, PFC and 
amygdalar regions underlies the effects of cannabis 
and CB1R agonists on cognitive and memory function, 
whereas the presence of CB1Rs within the 
mesocorticolimbic regions (VTA, NAc and PFC) contributes 
to the rewarding effects produced by cannabinoids.

Long-term effects. Although in several countries legis‑
lation enables new studies of medical cannabis to use 
prospective, randomized controlled trial designs, to date 
studies of the neurocognitive effects of repeatedly using 
cannabis (that is, the long‑term or chronic effects) have 
relied mainly on retrospective, self‑reported drug use by 
people who choose to use cannabis recreationally, and, 
in most cases, illicitly. More‑objective indices of drug 
use can be obtained through hair samples, although such 
analysis has limitations (for example, they are influenced 
Figure 2 | Effects of acute or chronic exposure to cannabis on reward- and cognition-related circuits. Graphical 
summary of alterations in neurobiological function resulting from chronic exposure to cannabinoid agonists based on 
studies in rodents, non-human primates and humans. These collected observations should be viewed as a model of 
chronic cannabis exposure rather than an explicit representation of cannabis-induced alterations in human brain function.  
a | Acute cannabis or moderate-dose cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) agonist exposure induces neurochemical events in 
the mesolimbic system that are similar to those produced by other drugs of abuse, including increased dopamine (DA) 
release and an attenuation of evoked GABA and glutamate (Glu) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc)109,111–113,207,208. 
The induced increase in opioid peptide release in the NAc118,119 probably also contributes to the acute rewarding effects 
of Δ9‑tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). Disruptions in cognitive function (including attention and memory impairments) 
probably result from: decreased acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampus (HIPP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC)209,210; 
reduced GABA release and increased Glu release in the PFC211; and increased noradrenaline (NA) release in HIPP and frontal 
cortical areas124–126. b | Chronic Δ9-THC or CB1R agonist exposure results in decreased CB1R expression and function in 
many brain regions. Positron emission tomography imaging of daily cannabis users has revealed considerable decreases 
in CB1R levels, particularly in cortical regions30,31, that correlate with years of cannabis use and withdrawal, and rapidly 
normalize during abstinence30,31. Rodent studies demonstrate regional differences in the effects of chronic Δ9-THC on CB1R 
expression and function, with rapid and profound decreases evident in the hippocampus and layer VI of the frontal cortex, 
smaller but still statistically significant decreases in striatal and amygdalar regions, and nonsignificant disruptions in regions 
such as the globus pallidus (GP) and hypothalamic nuclei100,101. The pronounced deficits in cortical and hippocampal CB1R 
function are consistent with memory and cognitive impairments associated with chronic cannabis use in humans. In this 
regard, chronic adolescent Δ9-THC exposure results in persistent disruptions of the hippocampal and cortical signalling 
that is critical for proper memory and cognitive functions. Chronic Δ9-THC exposure also disrupts reward-related signalling 
mechanisms in the mesolimbic system by reducing DA cell density in the ventral tegmental area (VTA)212 and by decreasing 
VTA DA cell firing and DA release in the NAc during both spontaneous and CB1R antagonist-precipitated withdrawal114,115. 
Consistent with these observations in animal models, reduced striatal DA synthesis has been observed in human cannabis 
users, and this effect appears to be driven by individuals meeting cannabis use disorder criteria116. Together with increased 
stress-related signalling, such as dynorphin release in the NAc200 and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) release in the 
amygdala74,75, these deficits in mesostriatal DA function may contribute to negative affective states associated with 
Δ9-THC abstinence. Adolescent Δ9-THC exposure also results in persistent increases in opioid peptide gene expression 
and influences the mesolimbic system of rats192,213,214, possibly contributing to an increase in the rewarding effects of 
opiates and increased opiate consumption by these animals in adulthood191–193,213. BLA, basolateral amygdala; BNST, bed

Long‑term impairments in memory have been reported 
mainly in frequent, heavy users, but confounding factors 
make it difficult to establish cause–effect relationships 
between cannabis use and changes in neuro 
cognitive 
function. Such factors include baseline cognitive func‑
tion before drug use; use of other cognitively impair‑
ing drugs, such as alcohol; types of cannabis used; 
age at which use started; and mental health problems, 
including depression and cannabis addiction.
Case–control studies of non‑acute effects of cannabis 
have produced inconsistent findings to date, but tend to 
mirror acute findings. The most consistently reported 
long‑term effects in these studies are impairments in the 
encoding of new episodic memories, with some studies 
finding persistent deficits in the first few days of absti‑
nence but little evidence of persisting deficits at 28 days 
after use25. Meanwhile, the findings for measures of 
working memory, attention and impulsivity are mixed. 
One study35 found no difference in decision making or 
risk taking between cannabis users and non‑users who 
were matched for potential mental health confounds. 
However, poorer decision‑making accuracy in users was 
significantly associated with the number of symptoms of 
cannabis addiction.
Functional neuroimaging studies often reveal subtle 
differences in brain activity between chronic cannabis 
users and controls during performance of cognitive 
tasks; again, the persistence and clinical importance of 
these differences remain to be determined. A systematic 
review36 of 43 studies concluded that chronic cannabis 
use may alter brain structure and function in both adult 
and adolescent users (particularly in the medial tempo‑
ral and frontal cortices and the cerebellum). However, 
the findings of the mainly cross‑sectional studies dis‑
played remarkable heterogeneity, and it was not possible 
to infer causation. Further, deficits are most consistently 
observed only among heavy users — those most likely 
to be addicted to cannabis. Cognitive changes related to 
chronic exposure to cannabis or Δ9‑THC observed in 
humans and in animal model studies (such as reduced 
inhibitory control and impaired decision making)27,37,38 
are implicated in the maintenance of addiction39, in 
part by impairing the reversal of behaviours related 
to drug acquisition or drug taking that propel continued 
drug use despite negative consequences. It could thus 
be proposed that these cognitive changes may interact 
with genetic vulnerability factors to increase the risk of 
developing cannabis addiction.
Age-dependent effects: adolescence and adulthood. The 
eCB system has a major role in neurodevelopmental 
and maturational processes including synaptic pru‑
ning and white‑matter development, and these processes 
are especially prevalent during adolescence. As exoge‑
nous cannabinoids affect the functioning of the eCB 
system, it is plausible that prolonged use during ado‑
lescence disrupts the neurodevelopmental maturational 
processes during this period40. Thus, the human brain 
may be more vulnerable to drugs at the time when use 
of cannabis often begins.
Preclinical studies have shown that repeated expo‑
sure to Δ9‑THC has a greater negative impact on the 
working memory, object recognition and pre‑pulse 
inhibition of adolescent rodents than on adult rodents40. 
Chronic administration of CB1R agonists or Δ9‑THC 
to adolescent rats produces persisting impairments in 
object recognition memory that are not seen with the 
same treatment in adult rats41,42, as well as greater alter‑
ations in the level of expression of various hippocampal 
proteins (which may account for adolescent‑specific 
memory effects)42. A single dose of Δ9‑THC has also 
been found to result in greater acute impairments in 
spatial and non‑spatial learning in adolescent rats than 
in adult rats43.
The age‑related effects of cannabis use on cognitive 
function may therefore be dependent on the matura‑
tional state of the neural circuits that are affected by 
the drug. This may reflect the fact that Δ9‑THC induces 
perturbations in the crucial influence of the eCB signal‑
ling that is involved in brain development, for processes 
including neural proliferation, morphogenesis, neu‑
ral migration and synaptogenesis44–46. Consistent with 
this interpretation were the results of a study in which 
Δ9‑THC was repeatedly administered over 6 months 
to adolescent monkeys at doses that corresponded 
well to human self‑administration (approximately 1–2 
joints on 5 days per week). This repeated administra‑
tion blunted the usual pattern of accuracy improvements 
on a test of spatial working memory (which matures 
after object working memory), but not on an object 
working memory task47. Thus, the persistent effects 
of Δ9‑THC on cognition in animals are more evident 
when exposure coincides with the developmental stage 
during which cannabinoid‑affected neural circuits are 
actively maturing.
Similarly, there is also accumulating evidence in 
humans that neurocognitive function and aspects of 
brain architecture are more disrupted by cannabis when 
individuals start using it during adolescence, although 
there is a scarcity of direct comparisons with adult 
users. Some structural imaging studies in adolescent 
and young adult cannabis users have reported decreased 
volume in several cortical and subcortical regions36, but 
findings across different studies vary considerably48. 
For example, although structural differences between 
adolescent cannabis users and controls in orbitofrontal 
cortex (OFC) volume have been found, smaller OFC 
volumes at 12 years of age were shown to predict can‑
nabis use at 16, suggesting that differences in the OFC 
may be a vulnerability factor for use rather than a con‑
sequence49. And although smaller hippocampal volumes 
in cannabis users have been associated with age of onset 
of use, this association seems to be less consistent than 
does the association between reductions in the size of the 
hippocampus and the amount of use, suggesting that 
the structure of the hippocampus may be more affected 
by the duration and intensity of exposure rather than by 
early use specifically50.

fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity) in

 Cannabis abuse
Cannabis use that is 
problematic for various aspects 
of an individual’s life (for 
example, causing occupational, 
educational or social problems) 
or that is carried out in 
dangerous contexts.
Cannabis dependence
A group of severe 
consequences of repeated 
cannabis use, including 
tolerance to effects, withdrawal 
symptoms upon cessation, 
dysregulation of use, increased 
involvement with cannabis at 
the expense of other activities, 
and continued use despite the 
problems it causes.
adolescents who use cannabis frequently compared with 
control non‑users48. Further, reductions in those indices 
of white‑matter integrity were found to correlate with 
deficits in measures of neurocognitive performance.
Several functional MRI (fMRI) studies suggest that 
there is an increased BOLD signal in task‑related areas 
in young cannabis users compared with non‑using 
controls48. For example, Jager and colleagues51 assessed 
13–19‑year‑old boys who had used cannabis at least 
200 times in their lives and compared them with non‑ 
using, age‑matched controls. The cannabis users showed 
greater activation in prefrontal regions during a working 
memory task than did controls. Overall, most functional 
imaging findings suggest that adolescent cannabis users 
show increased recruitment of neural resources — 
potentially reflecting compensatory activity — in brain 
areas subserving task‑related processing.
In terms of neurocognitive function, individuals 
who started using cannabis during adolescence have 
been reported to have greater deficits in visuo 
spatial 
attention52, verbal fluency53 and inhibition53 than do 
those who start in adulthood. Importantly, based on 
the Dunedin prospective cohort data, one study54 
concluded that having cannabis addiction that started 
during adolescence and persisted into adulthood was 
associated with a decline of around 8 IQ points (BOX 1). 
However, two recent large‑scale studies cast doubt on a 
causal explanation (BOX 1).
One limitation of the studies to date assessing the 
effects of cannabis use on the adolescent brain is that 
they have focused on age (whereby onset of use before 
15–17 years of age is considered to be ‘early’) rather than 
on adolescent pubertal markers or potential sensitive 
periods that may more accurately index the stage of brain 
development55. As the eCB system interacts with gonadal 
hormones, and girls typically begin puberty earlier and 
reach pubertal maturation earlier than boys, pubertal 
stage may influence findings on sex differences. The few 
studies looking at acute effects of cannabis or Δ9‑THC 
have found little in the way of age‑dependent sex dif‑
ferences, although such differences may exist in chronic 
users25. One study that did investigate this, however, found 
that a younger age of regular cannabis use onset predicted 
poorer memory in women but not men56. Surprisingly, 
the same study found that an earlier age of cannabis use 
initiation predicted better decision‑making performance 
in both male and female cannabis users. Maturation of the 
PFC and its connections with the limbic system occurs 
earlier in girls57, and this difference may contribute to 
reported sex differences in the effects of adolescent can‑
nabis use25,56. The paucity of studies of sex differences in 
the effects of cannabis limits conclusions and should be 
addressed by future research.
Effects persisting after stopping use. Several studies of 
long‑term effects after an individual stops using canna‑
bis are converging to show that cognitive impairments 
do not persist beyond 4–6 weeks after abstinence58,59. 
Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, one 
study30 demonstrated that chronic cannabis users showed 
downregulation of cortical CB1Rs that correlated with 
years of use. After ~4 weeks of continuously monitored 
abstinence from cannabis at a secure research unit, their 
CB1R density returned to control levels, further support‑
ing recovery within 4 weeks, and even, according to one 
recent study, after as little as 2 days31. Reversible downreg‑
ulation of brain CB1Rs after chronic exposure to cannabis 
has also been shown in rodent studies60. Other studies of 
‘persisting’ effects have used structural and/or functional 
imaging but with cross‑sectional designs, different absten‑
tion intervals and a range of confounds (including group 
differences in comorbid alcohol use and pre‑cannabis 
level of functioning), which make it difficult to draw any 
causal conclusions. Longitudinal studies are thus needed 
to determine whether these effects of abstinence are seen 
even in those starting use in adolescence61.
Cannabis addiction
Much research on cannabis and mental health has 
focused on psychosis (BOX 2), although addiction is a far 
more common problem: we estimate that people who 
try cannabis are ninefold more likely to become addicted 
to it than to develop psychosis in their lifetime62–64. In 
this section, we introduce the concepts of cannabis 
addiction and withdrawal, review the rewarding effects 
Box 2 | Cannabis and psychosis: cause, consequence or correlation?
Nearly 2,000 studies have been published on this topic since 1962, and the 
pro‑psychotic effects of cannabis have dominated media reporting about this drug. But 
how clear is the link? Several longitudinal, population-based studies show an earlier 
first episode176 and a roughly twofold increase in the risk of psychosis with regular 
cannabis use62. However, the vast majority of people who use cannabis do not develop 
psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and many people diagnosed with such 
disorders have never used cannabis.
More agreement is found in evidence that heavy cannabis use may mean that young 
people who are vulnerable to psychosis develop the disorder when they may not have 
otherwise done so. Converging data suggest that this may have a genetic basis, with 
certain polymorphisms of the gene encoding AKT1 potentially conferring risk of 
psychosis following smoking cannabis acutely177 and chronically178,179.
The type of cannabis used has recently been found to affect the risk of psychosis: 
self-reported hash use, even daily, is not associated with an increased risk of psychosis, 
whereas self-reported daily use of skunk (which contains high levels of 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and negligible amounts of cannabidiol (CBD)) is 
associated with a fivefold greater chance of having schizophrenia180. Several studies 
using objective biological markers of use have shown that CBD reduces the 
psychosis-like effects of Δ9‑THC154,181.
How cannabis interacts with the brain to increase the risk of psychosis is unclear. One 
confusing finding is that of reduced dopamine release in cannabis users116, which seems 
to be inconsistent with the higher levels of dopamine release observed in people with 
psychosis. Disruptions in the brain’s endocannabinoid system, conversely, have been 
found in psychosis and may provide clues as to the pro‑psychotic impact of cannabis. 
Higher levels of anandamide (AEA) in the cerebrospinal fluid have been associated with 
lower psychotic symptoms in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia182, in individuals 
classified as having prodromal schizophrenia183 who do not smoke cannabis and in 
cannabis users without a diagnosis of schizophrenia107. AEA is known to have a 
neuromodulatory role in the brain; thus, during prodromal or first‑episode psychosis, 
levels of AEA may be increased to attempt to control dysregulated brain dopamine184.
In addition, in vivo positron emission tomography imaging and post‑mortem receptor 
autoradiography studies have consistently reported higher levels of ligand binding to 
cannabinoid 1 receptors in several cortical regions of people with schizophrenia185. 
Whether these alterations are part of the disease pathology or a compensatory 
response remains unclear, but they do suggest a molecular basis for a heightened 
sensitivity to cannabis of individuals with schizophrenia, and perhaps of those at risk.

opioid and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems, and

for cannabis addiction.
Cannabis addiction and withdrawal. The term ‘addic‑
tion’ is in a terminological quagmire; here, however, we 
define it as an acquired, chronic, relapsing disorder that 
is characterized by a powerful motivation to continually 
engage in an activity despite persistent negative conse‑
quences. Addictive drugs can all cause similar changes to 
brain circuits underpinning reward, salience, impulsivity, 
compulsivity, learning and memory39,65–67, although these 
changes differ according to class of drug (including 
cannabis)68,69. Clinical problems associated with can‑
nabis use were previously diagnosed as cannabis abuse 
or cannabis dependence in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision 
(DSM‑IV‑TR). In the most recent version (DSM‑5), these 
categories were amalgamated into a single diagnosis of 
‘cannabis use disorder’ (CUD), as described in BOX 3. The 
estimated chances of becoming addicted to cannabis after 
lifetime exposure is 8.9%, which is considerably lower 
than for cocaine (20.9%), alcohol (22.7%) or tobacco 
(67.5%)64. Nevertheless, the clinical need for treatment 
of cannabis addiction is substantial and increasing in 
North America, Europe and Oceania5. Across Europe, 
cannabis now accounts for more first‑time entrants to 
drug treatment services than any other illicit drug70.
A specific cannabis withdrawal syndrome — one 
aspect of addiction — is well recognized and affects 
around 50% of daily users upon cessation of use, and 
typically begins 1–2 days after cessation, peaks at 
2–6 days and remits at 1–2 weeks71. Prominent symp‑
toms include craving, sleep problems, nightmares, anger, 
irritability, dysphoria and nausea72. Cannabis withdrawal 
symptoms correlate with reductions in CB1R availabil‑
ity during acute abstinence31 and can be alleviated by 
Δ9‑THC in a dose‑dependent manner73. Δ9‑THC with‑
drawal is also associated with increased release of the 
stress peptide corticotropin‑releasing factor (CRF) in the 
central nucleus of the amygdala74,75. Similar increases in 
amygdalar CRF release are evident during withdrawal 
from most classes of recreational drugs (including nic‑
otine, alcohol, psychostimulants and opiates) and con‑
tribute to negative affective states and decreased brain 
reward function76. It is therefore noteworthy that can‑
nabis is frequently rolled with tobacco in ‘joints’, and 
many users also smoke cigarettes (BOX 4). In daily users 
of cannabis and tobacco, individual withdrawal effects 
seem to be similar for both drugs; combined withdrawal 
produces stronger effects than does withdrawal for either 
one alone77.
Cannabinoids and reward. Δ9‑THC produces the effects 
that cannabis users seek; they report liking it and want‑
ing more24. In addition, cannabis with higher Δ9‑THC 
content (for example, 3.5% versus 2.0%) produces 
stronger reinforcement in human choice paradigms78. As 
the re 
inforce 
ment of drug use is considered to be one 
component in the transition from voluntary to compul‑
sive use67, these findings suggest that cannabis with high 
Δ9‑THC content might increase vulnerability to addiction. 
However, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to 
modern, high‑potency cannabis with ~15% Δ9‑THC16–18. 
Recent naturalistic studies indicate that people adapt to 
rising Δ9‑THC concentrations by adding less cannabis 
to their joints79 and/or inhaling less smoke80. Nevertheless, 
cross‑sectional data suggest that use of cannabis with 
high Δ9‑THC content is associated with greater addiction 
severity81. It is therefore possible that recent increases in 
cannabis potency15,16 might have contributed to the rising 
demand for treatment of cannabis addiction5,70.
Box 3 | Cannabis use disorder
Cannabis‑related problems vary on a continuum, and it is important to define these 
not only for clinical diagnosis and treatment but also for research. The Diagnostic 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)186 has combined the 
definitions for ‘cannabis abuse’ and ‘cannabis dependence’ to provide criteria for the 
diagnosis of ‘cannabis use disorder’ (CUD). DSM-5 states that CUD is: “A problematic 
pattern of cannabis use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as 
manifested by at least 2 of the [symptoms from the three lists below], occurring within 
a 12-month period” (REF. 186). Mild CUD is associated with having two or three of 
these symptoms, moderate CUD, with four or five symptoms, and severe CUD, with six 
or more symptoms. One DSM-IV criterion — concerning persistent legal problems 
related to cannabis use — was dropped and not included in DSM-5 because it largely 
reflected sociocultural factors to do with policing and law enforcement rather than 
cannabis use factors.
One advantage of combining abuse and dependence criteria in CUD is to provide 
a clearer continuum between mild and severe, because previously all cases of 
dependence also met criteria for abuse. Another advantage is that dependence is 
often a normal bodily response to a substance (for example, a prescribed pain killer) 
that should not to be confused with addiction (insomuch as stopping use of that pain 
killer does not necessarily lead to drug seeking).
Cannabis dependence symptoms from DSM-IV
The following symptoms are taken from the DSM-IV criteria for cannabis 
dependence187:
• Cannabis is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended
• There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control cannabis use
• A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain cannabis, use cannabis, 
or recover from its effects
• Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced 
because of cannabis use
• Cannabis use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent 
physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated 
by cannabis
• Tolerance, as defined by either [1] a need for markedly increased cannabis to achieve 
intoxication or desired effect or [2] a markedly diminished effect with continued use 
of the same amount of the substance
• Withdrawal, as manifested by either [1] the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for 
cannabis or [2] cannabis is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms
Cannabis abuse symptoms from DSM-IV
The following symptoms are taken from DSM-IV criteria for cannabis abuse187:
• Recurrent cannabis use resulting in a failure to fulfil major role obligations at work, 
school, or home
• Continued cannabis use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal 
problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of cannabis
• Recurrent cannabis use in situations in which it is physically hazardous
New symptom in DSM-5
This item was added as a new symptom to DSM-5:
• Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis

The presence or absence of CBD in evaluations of 
Δ9‑THC reward may also be relevant. One study found 
that people who smoked cannabis containing low levels 
of CBD were more prone to have their attention captured 
by cannabis‑related stimuli than were those smoking 
cannabis with high CBD content82. This suggests that 
CBD could protect against addiction, as attentional bias 
towards drug‑related stimuli correlates with craving 
and is sensitive to relapse‑provoking manipulations83. 
However, CBD does not influence the acute reinforc‑
ing effects of cannabis or the rewarding feeling of being 
‘stoned’ (REFS 82,84,85).
The reinforcing effects of cannabinoids in animals 
depend on species, route of administration and experi‑
mental design. Rats will perform an operant behaviour to 
receive Δ9‑THC infusions into the brain ventricular space 
and to receive CB1R agonist infusions into the nucleus 
accumbens shell and posterior ventral tegmental area86,87, 
as with other drugs of abuse. However, there has been 
substantial difficulty in establishing operant intravenous 
Δ9‑THC self‑administration in rodents78, possibly owing 
to the prolonged pharmacokinetic effects of Δ9‑THC that 
impede the establishment of discrete response–reward 
associations. The higher cognitive function in pri‑
mates may allow for clearer discernment as to whether 
lever‑pressing behaviour is causal for the somewhat 
delayed alterations in reward state resulting from intra‑
venous administration of Δ9‑THC. It is also possible that 
the aversive and motor‑depressant effects of Δ9‑THC pres‑
ent greater impediments to self‑administration in rodents 
than in primates.
Consistent with the human literature, studies in rats 
also demonstrate that Δ9‑THC reward is dose depend‑
ent. These effects appear to follow an inverted‑U‑shaped 
curve, whereby high‑Δ9‑THC doses are less reinforcing 
than medium doses. For example, as indexed using the 
intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) paradigm, reward‑ 
system function in the rodent brain is enhanced by low 
doses of Δ9‑THC88, whereas higher doses and more‑ 
potent CB1R agonists can decrease this function89,90. 
Consistent with this, the rewarding effects of low doses 
of Δ9‑THC or CB1R agonists in the conditioned place 
preference paradigm are supplanted by aversive effects 
at higher doses86,91,92. An inverted‑U‑shaped profile is 
consistent with data from human studies that indicate 
that cannabis with high Δ9‑THC content is preferred and 
associated with greater addiction severity than cannabis 
with  low Δ9‑THC content81, whereas extremely potent 
products (such as synthetic CB1R agonists) are less 
addictive than ‘natural’ cannabis, have more negative 
effects and are only preferred by 7% of users93.
In animals, CB1R antagonism produces a ‘rightward’ 
shift along this inverted‑U‑shaped reward–aversion 
dose‑effect function, blocking the rewarding effects of 
low doses of CB1R agonists and preventing the aversive 
effects of high CB1R agonist doses. This underscores the 
bimodal effects of CB1R activity on brain reward process‑
ing. Squirrel monkeys voluntarily self‑administer intra‑
venous Δ9‑THC94, and rats reliably self‑administer 
synthetic CB1R agonists95,96 — actions that are prevented 
by CB1R antagonism. Taken together, these studies sug‑
gest that CB1R activity has a crucial role in cannabinoid 
reinforcement and cannabis addiction.
Similar to Δ9‑THC and many synthetic cannabinoid 
agonists, eCBs exhibit agonist effects at brain CB1Rs. 
The eCB AEA takes its name from the Sanskrit word 
ananda, meaning ‘bliss’. Although pharmacologically 
enhanced eCB signalling (for example, through the 
inhibition of eCB clearance) generally does not produce 
rewarding effects per se, persistent disruptions in eCB 
signalling appear to contribute to facets of drug depend‑
ence across drug classes97,98. CB1R downregulation in 
chronic cannabis users has been reported in three 
studies30,31,99; these effects subside within days to sev‑
eral weeks of sustained abstinence30,31. Similarly, rodents 
chronically exposed to Δ9‑THC or synthetic CB1R ago‑
nists exhibit a reduction in CB1R function throughout 
the brain100,101 that persists for days to weeks following 
Δ9‑THC treatment, followed by a functional recovery 
that varies between brain regions102. eCB‑mediated 
forms of synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens 
and hippocampus are abolished following exposure 
to Δ9‑THC or CB1R agonists101,103,104 — and this may 
substantially affect reward processing and memory pro‑
cesses mediated by these regions. Chronic exposure to 
Δ9‑THC or CB1R agonists increases enzymatic clear‑
ance of AEA and reduces brain tissue AEA content in 
rodents19,105,106 and, consistent with these data, frequent 
cannabis smokers exhibit decreased AEA levels in cer‑
ebrospinal fluid107. Although evidence is limited, serum 
AEA levels may be elevated in former users of the drug 
following prolonged cannabis abstinence108.
Box 4 | The gateway theory
Although cannabis is traditionally considered to be a ‘soft’ drug, it is widely believed to 
act as a ‘gateway’ to harder drugs such as cocaine or heroin (with harm defined in terms 
of detrimental effects of using that substance on the individual and on society). 
According to this theory, there is a sequential progression from one drug to the next (for 
example, cannabis leading to cocaine, and then heroin)188. This theory rests on evidence 
that use of one drug increases the likelihood of using the next drug in the ‘sequence’, 
which may be interpreted as causal if all other confounds are accounted for188.
Evidence does support sequential progression and association between cannabis and 
other illicit drugs, and these effects increase with frequency of cannabis use and 
adolescent onset189. In addition, a twin study190 suggested that these effects cannot be 
attributed to shared genetic or environmental factors alone. Studies in rats 
demonstrate that adolescent Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) exposure results in 
increased opiate consumption and facilitated learning of cocaine self‑administration in 
adulthood191–193, and that the influence of adolescent Δ9-THC exposure on opiate 
reward may be transgenerational194.
However, establishing causality remains challenging, and putative mechanisms 
remain speculative. For example, one possibility is that the wide availability of cannabis 
means that people are more likely to use it first, and this increases the chances that 
other illicit drugs are used because of contact with other drug users and with people 
selling illicit drugs190. This formed part of the Netherlands’ rationale for the regulated 
sale of cannabis; incidentally, the rates of cocaine use among people who have used 
cannabis are lower there (22%) than in the United States (33%)195.
Biological explanations for the gateway hypothesis are supported by evidence 
that exposure to Δ9‑THC enhances the reinforcing effects of other drugs. 
Intriguingly, however, prior Δ9‑THC ingestion increases self‑administration of nicotine 
and the reinforcing effects of nicotine in rats196, but this does not occur with prior 
cocaine or heroin exposure197,198. Indeed, one of the most potentially harmful and 
under-appreciated effects of cannabis is the ‘reverse gateway’: by smoking tobacco 
together with cannabis in ‘joints’, individuals may progress to nicotine addiction160,199.

 Dopamine, opioids and noradrenaline. Human PET 
studies indicate that Δ9‑THC can increase dopamine 
release in the striatum109, although to a far lesser extent 
than do other recreational drugs, and not in all studies110. 
In rodents, Δ9‑THC and CB1R agonists increase the firing 
rate and bursting activity of ventral tegmental area dopa‑
mine neurons, resulting in dose‑ 
dependent increases 
in the mesocorticolimbic release of dopamine111–113. 
Conversely, withdrawal from chronic Δ9‑THC or CB1R 
agonist exposure is associated with decreased firing of 
dopaminergic cells and decreased dopamine release in 
the nucleus accumbens114,115. Consistent with these obser‑
vations in animal models, reduced capacity to synthesize 
striatal dopamine was recently reported in human can‑
nabis users, particularly among addicted individuals116. 
However, in humans, chronic cannabis exposure is not 
typically associated with abnormalities in striatal dopa‑
mine release or in D2 receptor expression117 and, together 
with the modest dopaminergic effects of acute Δ9‑THC, 
the available human data provide only weak support for 
dopaminergic involvement in cannabis addiction.
Δ9‑THC‑induced increases in opioid peptide 
release118,119 may also contribute to the rewarding effects 
of cannabis. The opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone 
reduces Δ9‑THC‑induced increases in meso 
limbic dopa‑
mine release, intravenous Δ9‑THC self‑administration and 
intracerebroventricular CB1R agonist self‑administration 
in rats and monkeys120,121. Sixteen days of naltrexone treat‑
ment reduced self‑ 
administration and some positive sub‑
jective effects of Δ9‑THC in humans122.
Δ9‑THC and other CB1R agonists stimulate nora‑
drenergic cell firing and increase levels of noradrenaline in 
multiple brain regions in which the neurotransmitter can 
affect motivated behaviours123 — including the nucleus 
accumbens, prefrontal and cerebral cortices, hippocampus 
and hypothalamus124–126. The behavioural importance of 
CB1R agonist‑induced increases in noradrenaline release 
has not been carefully evaluated, although evidence sug‑
gests that such increases in noradrenaline release may 
contribute to the aversive (but not anxiogenic) effects of 
high doses of CB1R agonists127. For example, the aversive 
effects of high doses of the CB1R agonist WIN 55,212‑2 
(as measured in the conditioned place aversion paradigm) 
are reduced by attenuation of noradrenergic signalling in 
the nucleus accumbens, although WIN 55,212‑2‑induced 
anxiety‑like behaviour (as measured on the elevated plus 
maze) is not reduced by these manipulations127.
Vulnerability factors. Irrespective of the drug constit‑
uents81,82, only a minority of cannabis users become 
addicted; therefore, other factors must predict vulner‑
ability. Concurrent tobacco use has been identified as 
a risk factor in several studies128–130, as have early adoles‑
cent onset and frequent (especially daily) use128,131. Males 
typically have an earlier opportunity to use cannabis, 
a greater risk of addiction and a faster progression from 
first opportunity of use to addiction64,128,129. These find‑
ings are consistent with normative data from European 
treatment services: the mean age of first treatment is 
24 years; the mean age at first cannabis use is 16 years; 
and 83% of treated individuals are male70.
Interestingly, a 3‑year prospective study of daily users 
found that variables related directly to cannabis use did 
not predict transition to addiction; more important were 
current factors such as living alone, coping motives and 
negative life events (such as having had a major financial 
crisis)215. A meta‑analysis of 24 twin studies132 suggested 
that genetic influences account for 55% of the vulnera‑
bility to cannabis addiction, with shared environmental 
factors and non‑shared environmental factors account‑
ing for much lower proportions (17.5% and 27.5%, 
respectively). Although isolated studies have identified 
specific gene variants associated with an increased risk of 
developing cannabis use disorder (reviewed in REF. 133), 
cannabis addiction phenotypes are likely to be polygenic, 
and genotypes probably overlap with those linked to 
substance addiction in general134.
Possible treatments for cannabis addiction. Cannabis 
addiction is not easily treated by psychological ther‑
apies135, and although many pharmacotherapies have 
been tested136 — including antidepressants, anxiolytics, 
noradrenaline‑reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, glu‑
tamatergic modulators and CB1R agonists — none has 
been approved. Based on existing clinical trial data, a 
12‑week trial of the GABA mimetic gabapentin137 and an 
8‑week trial of N‑acetylcysteine138 have shown promise 
for reducing cannabis use according to urine sampling 
during treatment. Gabapentin also improved several 
secondary outcomes, including withdrawal symptoms, 
executive function and self‑ 
reported depression137. CB1R 
agonists such as dronabinol (an oral synthetic Δ9‑THC)139 
and nabiximols (an oral spray containing Δ9‑THC and 
CBD in equal ratio)140 attenuated cannabis withdrawal 
symptoms and improved treatment retention, but did 
not reduce cannabis use compared with placebo. These 
findings suggest that substitution treatments can replace 
Δ9‑THC in cannabis but are not sufficient to promote 
abstinence from it.
Few studies have evaluated the contribution of dysreg‑
ulated eCB signalling to cannabis addiction and related 
physiological and behavioural disruptions. However, 
eCBs provide important homeostatic regulation over 
emotional state141 and sleep function142, and so it is plau‑
sible that Δ9‑THC‑induced impairment of eCB signalling 
contributes to the negative emotional states and sleep 
disturbances that are present during protracted cannabis 
abstinence71–73. Intriguingly, studies in rodents demon‑
strate a palliative effect of 2‑AG‑clearance inhibitors on 
the somatic symptoms of CB1R‑antagonist‑precipitated 
Δ9‑THC withdrawal105. Collectively, these observations 
have led to the proposed use of eCB‑clearance inhibi‑
tors as treatments for cannabis withdrawal, and perhaps 
addiction143,144. Given the largely unmet clinical need, 
developing effective pharmacological treatments should 
be a top research priority.
Cannabis, anxiety and depression
Like most addictions, cannabis addiction is often comor‑
bid with other mental health problems. Epidemiological 
evidence indicates a possible association between reg‑
ular cannabis use and the development of anxiety and

 depression. However, the evidence is more mixed and less 
consistent than that for an association between cannabis 
use and psychosis62. One recent study compared the men‑
tal health of individuals who were addicted to cannabis 
(according to the DSM‑IV) with that of non‑addicted 
cannabis users who had similar patterns of cannabis 
use. Only the addicted users had depression and anxiety 
problems145. Compared with the general population, 
non‑addicted frequent users were more likely to show 
externalizing disorders (such as attention‑deficit hyper‑
activity disorder), which were likely to have predated their 
cannabis use. Otherwise, these individuals were similar in 
terms of mental health to the general population, suggest‑
ing that cannabis contributes to mental health problems 
only in those who are vulnerable for other reasons.
Depression and anxiety disorders not only are associ‑
ated with cannabis addiction146 but also are predictive of 
whether individuals transition from use to addiction147. 
Strikingly, a high number of cases of depression and 
anxiety disorders were reported among obese individu‑
als who were treated with the anti‑obesity drug rimona‑
bant, a CB1R antagonist. Many of these individuals had 
no prior history of these disorders148,149, and so this led 
to the withdrawal of rimonabant from therapeutic use. 
These findings suggest that CB1R antagonists increase 
the risk of depression and/or anxiety. Moreover, pr 
e‑
clinical studies have shown that mice that genetically 
lack CB1Rs show increased depressive‑like symp‑
toms150 and, in wild‑type mice, CBD has antidepressant 
effects151. Rodent studies have implicated the eCB sys‑
tem in the regulation of emotion152. Similarly, there are 
also data from rodent studies suggesting that impaired 
CB1R signalling leads to depression‑like symptoms, 
and that enhancement of CB1R signalling produces 
antidepressant‑like behavioural effects in rodents153.
In our own studies of young (16–24‑year‑old) daily 
cannabis users, we have found that levels of Δ9‑THC 
in hair are significantly associated with self‑reported 
levels of both depression and anxiety154. However, a 
recent epidemiological study146 suggested that increases 
in self‑ 
reported depression in cannabis users are not 
long‑ 
lasting, as no consistent associations were found 
between adolescent cannabis use and depression at the 
age of 29 years. By contrast, the same study showed 
that daily cannabis use and cannabis addiction in early 
adulthood were associated with more than double the 
non‑user control rate of anxiety disorders at 29 years 
of age. The association between cannabis use and anx‑
iety may arise because the same factors that predispose 
people to use cannabis also predispose them to anxiety. 
Indeed, there is accumulating evidence that, in vulnera‑
ble individuals, cannabis is often ‘used’ to self‑medicate 
social anxiety155,156. This is interesting, as controlled 
studies of acute effects in humans have shown that 
Δ9‑THC increases anxiety6, whereas CBD decreases it9. 
Furthermore, Δ9‑THC and CBD acutely produce oppo‑
site but subtle effects on human facial affect recognition84 
and amygdala activation when viewing fearful faces32.
The interconnectedness of cannabis use, mental 
health problems and cognitive functioning is impor‑
tant. It is inherently difficult to determine causality 
in the type of studies discussed above because factors 
besides cannabis use (for example, premorbid cognitive 
and emotional function) may be directly associated with 
risk of mental illness. Such factors could predispose an 
individual both to mental illness and to using cannabis3, 
and the combination of these disorders would in turn 
increase their impact on cognitive functioning.
Conclusions and future directions
Cannabis has been used for thousands of years for a 
range of medicinal purposes as well as for its desired 
psychological and social effects, which recreational 
users value. This use can, however, carry a penalty: 
a range of undesired effects that vary in the severity of 
their impact on the individual’s life. Although evidence 
of clear causality is lacking, these undesired effects may 
range from mild cognitive impairment to disabling 
psychiatric disorders. However, most recreational and 
medical users appear to rate the benefits as outweighing 
the risks in choosing to continue their cannabis use. It 
should be noted that public health messages to users are 
distorted, because funding for research is often targeted 
to studying the harmful effects of cannabis rather than 
the benefits. Despite studies aiming to document nega‑
tive effects, occasionally positive effects are noted, such 
as enhanced divergent thinking following either oral 
THC or smoked cannabis24,157. Future research should 
evaluate perceived benefits to give a more balanced 
understanding; people clearly do not use cannabis only 
for its harms.
Throughout this Review, we have specified gaps in 
our knowledge. Although problems associated with 
cannabis use are mainly observed in heavy, frequent 
users, we are still not sure what level of use of what 
type of cannabis is non‑problematic. We need such 
data for harm‑reduction advice for both medical and 
recreational users.
Another question that needs answering is: how does 
repeated use of cannabis causally affect the human ado‑
lescent and adult brain given that most cannabis users 
also use alcohol, another cognitively impairing drug? 
A recent comparison of daily cannabis users who also 
drank alcohol and alcohol‑intake‑matched, non‑using 
controls in both adolescents and adults found no dif‑
ferences in brain structure between the two groups158, 
but longitudinal data are currently lacking. It is also still 
unclear exactly how the effects of cannabis vary across 
clinical populations. For example, a meta‑analysis 
showed that people who are diagnosed with schizo‑
phrenia and use cannabis function better cognitively 
than individuals with schizophrenia who do not use 
cannabis159. Finally, we need to understand more about 
how variants of the drug produce differential effects — 
variants not only in constituent cannabinoids but also 
in the new synthetic cannabis (such as ‘spice’)93, as well 
as new forms of administration (for example, through 
vaping or edible forms)160.
Future studies will help to fill these gaps of knowl‑
edge, especially if they incorporate methodologi‑
cal improvements. Most studies of long‑term effects 
assess level of cannabis use through various self‑report

 measures (such as frequency, years of use and time to 
smoke a specific amount of the drug) and could benefit 
from improved biomarkers such as Δ9‑THC and CBD 
levels in hair. We need longitudinal studies that follow 
young people from before puberty (and before drug use), 
through biologically defined puberty and into adulthood 
(while monitoring drug use) and again after subsequent 
abstinence or continued use. Such studies would use 
a comprehensive range of assessments (including: tests of 
cognition, motivation, brain function and mental health; 
biomarkers of different types; and quantities of canna‑
bis or cannabinoids and other recreational substances 
used) so that the interactions among these factors may 
be monitored. This need should be addressed by the 
US National Institutes of Health‑funded Adolescent 
Brain Cognition Development (ABCD) Study: a pro‑
spective, 10‑year, longitudinal study of 10,000 individu‑
als beginning at 9–10 years of age. This study is designed 
to assess the impact of substance use on brain develop‑
ment and neurocognitive function through a battery of 
measures obtained before cannabis use, following use 
at various levels and again following cessation of use. 
Given recent changes in the medical and legal status of 
cannabis in some countries, randomized controlled trials 
of the effects of different types and doses of cannabis can 
now be conducted. Work with animals will be important 
in delineating chronic effects, and studies administering 
doses and schedules within a human‑relevant range (as 
exemplified in REF. 47) are the most helpful.
The number of cannabis addicts may well grow as can‑
nabis use becomes more acceptable and the drug more 
accessible. Indeed, there is evidence that this is already 
happening in the United States161. We therefore urgently 
need to increase our efforts to understand what factors 
influence the development of addiction and build preven‑
tive measures against this. Currently, we lack an effective 
pharmacological treatment for cannabis addiction that 
can be used conjointly with psychosocial therapies to 
boost the currently low efficacy of treatment approaches. 
This need requires urgent research attention.
With hindsight, we can clearly see the enormous 
problems that have been caused to many individuals 
and to society by tobacco and alcohol. Unlike cannabis, 
these drugs are legal in most countries, despite the fact 
that, if asked to decide today which psychoactive drugs 
should be legal, cannabis (which rarely kills people) 
might well be judged as being comparatively benign. 
Legislative changes would help researchers, as current 
restrictive drug scheduling markedly hinders neurosci‑
ence research and the innovation of psychiatric treat‑
ments162. More importantly, if handled carefully from 
a harm‑reduction standpoint, a regulated market might 
increase the control over the age of initiation of use and 
other vulnerability factors; inform accurately about 
dosage; and increase the availability of more‑balanced 
cannabis (that is, with lower levels of Δ9‑THC and higher 
levels of CBD) to maintain desired effects while reducing 
the incidence of harms.

Neuropsychopharmacology 29, 15–22 (2004).
References 74 and 75 were the first to 
demonstrate that Δ9-THC withdrawal is associated 
with increased levels of the stress neuropeptide 
CRF in the amygdala, which probably contributes to 
negative affective states and diminished brain 
reward function; this withdrawal-related effect is 
also common to many other classes of abused 
drugs, including nicotine, alcohol and opiates.

studies. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 113, E500–E508 
(2016).
References 163 and 164 both examined 
associations between adolescent cannabis use and 
IQ by using data from large longitudinal cohorts in 
the United Kingdom and United States; both papers 
suggest that there are non-causal explanations 
for the observed associations between adolescent 
cannabis use and lower IQ.

6, e738 (2016).
This is the largest study to date conducted on 
the acute response to cannabis and shows that 
psychotic-like symptoms in young healthy cannabis 
users are predicted by their AKT1 genotype, 
replicating the same effect observed in 
schizophrenia (see references 178 and 179).

The risk of individuals having a psychotic disorder 
was roughly threefold higher in those saying they 
used skunk (which contains high concentrations 
of Δ9-THC and negligible CBD) and fivefold higher 
in those reporting daily skunk use, compared 
with non-users; hash (which has a lower Δ9-THC 
content and more CBD) did not affect risk of a 
psychotic disorder.

The first study to show that psychosis-like 
symptoms are greater in those whose hair contains 
only Δ9-THC than in those whose hair contains both 
Δ9-THC and CBD or no cannabinoids — suggesting
