Abstract
Objective: The marketing of infant/child milk-based formulas (MF) contributes to
suboptimal breast-feeding and adversely affects child and maternal health
outcomes globally. However, little is known about recent changes in MF markets.
The present study describes contemporary trends and patterns of MF sales at the
global, regional and country levels.
Design: Descriptive statistics of trends and patterns in MF sales volume per infant/
child for the years 2008–2013 and projections to 2018, using industry-sourced data.
Setting: Eighty countries categorized by country income bracket, for developing
countries by region, and in countries with the largest infant/child populations.
Subjects: MF categories included total (for ages 0–36 months), infant (0–6 months),
follow-up (7–12 months), toddler (13–36 months) and special (0–6 months).
Results: In 2008–2013 world total MF sales grew by 40·8 % from 5·5 to 7·8 kg per
infant/child/year, a figure predicted to increase to 10·8 kg by 2018. Growth was
most rapid in East Asia particularly in China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam and
was led by the infant and follow-up formula categories. Sales volume per infant/
child was positively associated with country income level although with wide
variability between countries.
Conclusions: A global infant and young child feeding (IYCF) transition towards
diets higher in MF is underway and is expected to continue apace. The observed
increase in MF sales raises serious concern for global child and maternal health,
particularly in East Asia, and calls into question the efficacy of current regulatory
regimes designed to protect and promote optimal IYCF. The observed changes
have not been captured by existing IYCF monitoring systems.

Breast-feeding is important for infant and young child health
and development, and for maternal health, in both devel-
oped- and developing-country settings(1–3). It is ranked as the
single most effective intervention for the prevention of
deaths in children under 5 years of age(4). To achieve optimal
growth, development and health the WHO recommends that
infants should be exclusively breast-fed for the first 6 months
of life and thereafter receive nutritionally adequate and safe
complementary foods while continuing breast-feeding for up
to 2 years of age or beyond(5,6). Although significant progress
has been made in some countries, the global exclusive
breast-feeding rate improved only marginally from 33% in
1995 to 37% in 2014(7). Every year an estimated 823000
deaths, or 13·8% of total deaths, in children under 2 years
of age would be prevented if breast-feeding were scaled up
to a near-universal level in high-mortality low- and middle-
income countries. For mothers, a universal level of breast-
feeding in all countries would prevent an estimated 20000
deaths from breast cancer annually(8). Suboptimal infant and
young child feeding (IYCF) also incurs higher health system
expenditures through increased paediatric and maternal
health-care needs(9–11) and productivity-related economic
losses of $US 302 billion or 0·49% of world gross national
income annually(12).

 The WHO/UNICEF Global Strategy for Infant and Young
Child Feeding commits member countries to implement
policies designed to protect, promote and support breast-
feeding and to give full effect to the International Code of
Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes and subsequent World
Health Assembly resolutions (hereafter referred to as ‘The
Code’)(13). These commitments were reaffirmed in 2012,
when member countries unanimously adopted the goal of
increasing
the
global
exclusive
breast-feeding
rate
(<6 months) to at least 50 % by 2025(14). Implementation
and monitoring of The Code is further supported by the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child and its monitoring
body, the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The Code is
a response to long-standing concern that the commercial
marketing of breast-milk substitutes (BMS), including milk-
based formulas (MF) and other foods represented to be
suitable as partial or total replacements of breast milk,
contributes significantly to suboptimal IYCF(13).
Despite these high-level policy commitments, recent
market reports indicate that a global MF ‘sales boom’ is
underway(15). This sales boom applies not only to infant
formula (for consumption by infants aged 0–6 months)
but
also
to
follow-up
(7–12
months)
and
toddler
(13–36 months) formulas, which can displace ongoing
breast-feeding if marketed and consumed inappropriately.
Because products in these latter categories are often bran-
ded, packaged and labelled in ways that resemble infant
formula, they can be erroneously introduced in the first
6 months of life(16–18). The WHO has long maintained that
these milks are unnecessary and unsuitable as BMS(19).
Such reports are concerning given the well-established
evidence that formula-fed children experience poorer
health and developmental outcomes than breast-fed chil-
dren, with additional adverse implications for maternal
health. Breast milk is a personalized source of nutrition,
providing optimal levels of nutrients in volumes regulated
by the mother–child feeding dyad and an array of
biological
factors
critical
for
normal
immunological,
gastrointestinal and neurological development(8). MF is an
ultra-processed food(20), defined as an industrial formula-
tion of (typically) bovine milk powder, sugars, vegetable
oils, vitamins and minerals, and other additives. Although
an appropriate food when breast-feeding is contraindicated,
MF is prone to microbial contamination (of the formula
product, when mixed with contaminated water or through
unsterile feeding equipment), industrial contamination
(e.g. the 2008 East Asia melamine poisoning crisis), and is
implicated in infant malnutrition when practised inappro-
priately (including under- and over-dilution and under- and
over-feeding). Evidence on the health and developmental
implications of MF comes from studies comparing never
and partially breast-fed v. breast-fed infants, including sig-
nificant increased risks of all-cause mortality, diarrhoea and
pneumonia mortality(2), obesity and type 2 diabetes(21),
otitis media(22), malocclusion(23), asthma(24) and sudden
infant death syndrome(25). Non-breast-fed children also
demonstrate significantly lower IQ (intelligence quotient)
scores, robust to adjustments for maternal IQ(26). Formula-
feeding affects maternal health primarily due to foregone
protective effects of breast-feeding against ovarian cancer,
breast cancer and type 2 diabetes(1).
Although the reported MF sales boom could have
important public health implications, it is not evidenced in
current WHO/UNICEF monitoring systems for IYCF. The
existing MF-relevant indicator of ‘proportion of children
0–23 months of age who are fed with a bottle’ is volun-
tarily reported, coverage is low and longitudinal data
patchy. To address the identified evidence gap the present
paper describes recent global trends and patterns in MF
sales volumes using market sales data in countries cate-
gorized by income level and in developing countries by
region. Sales volumes in countries with the largest infant/
child populations are also reported. We conclude with a
discussion of the potential factors driving global MF sales
and observed variations between regions and countries.
Methods
Setting and subjects
The analysis included eighty countries for which data were
available, categorized by World Bank income bracket:
fifteen lower–middle income countries (L-MIC), twenty-six
upper–middle income countries (U-MIC) and thirty-nine
high-income countries (H-IC), representing 280 220 000
infants/children aged 0–36 months in 2013 (Table 1)(27).
To ascertain regional trends in MF sales in developing
countries, where most of the recent MF market growth has
been reported, L-MIC and U-MIC were also categorized by
World Bank region (Table 2).
Data sources and measures
Data from food balance sheets (food supply), household
expenditure surveys and food consumption surveys are
commonly used to monitor population-level diets(28).
However, we were unable to obtain adequate national-
level, globally comparable, longitudinal data for MF from
these sources. Instead, similar to other analyses of global
food and beverage markets, we adopted country-level
retail sales volume per capita as a proxy measure of
consumption(29–31). Data were extracted from country
reports sourced from the Euromonitor Passport Global
Market Information database for the years 2008–2013 with
projections to 2018(32). Euromonitor collects these data
from trade associations, industry bodies, business press,
company financial reports and official government statis-
tics. The data are validated through consultation with
people working within industry. Projections are calculated
by establishing a historic market trend and then factoring
in possible future market changes (e.g. likelihood of
recession or government regulation)(32).
Rapid global growth in infant formula sales
2541
 To control for country population size differences and
growth rates, volumes were converted to kilograms per
infant/child, matched to the target age groups of the
respective MF product categories defined by Euromonitor.
These categories included: total MF (aggregates all product
categories; for consumption by infants and children aged
0–36 months), infant formula (IF; 0–6 months), follow-up
formula
(FUF;
7–12
months),
toddler
formula
(TF;
13–36 months) and special formula (SF; sold for infants with
dietary conditions and including soya-based and lactose-
free varieties; calculated for infants aged 0–6 months)(32).
Infant/child population estimates corresponding to these
categories were sourced from the Euromonitor Passport
Global Market Information database as derived from official
UN and national statistics. Data were unavailable for FUF in
the USA and TF in Japan, making the total MF sales figures
in these markets an underestimate.
Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (in inter-
national dollars at purchasing power parity to allow for
comparability between countries) was adopted as an
approximate measure of consumer purchasing power, with
data extracted from the World Bank World Development
Indicators database for the years 2008–2013(27).
Data analysis
Country total MF sales volumes per infant/child in 2013
were plotted against GDP per capita (in international
dollars at purchasing power parity for comparability
between countries). Country compound annual growth
rates for the period 2008–2013 were calculated and plotted
against sales volumes in 2013 for the respective categories.
Additionally, descriptive statistics were used to describe
total MF and category sales volumes and 5-year historical
(2008–2013) and projected (2014–2018) growth rates, for
each country income category and for the five country
markets with the largest infant/child population in each
country income category. Sales in L-MIC and U-MIC were
also analysed by region.

sales per infant/child and log GDP per capita in 2013.

 2008–2013, for the infant, follow-up and toddler formula
categories,
in
countries
grouped
by
income.
These
demonstrate a positive association between sales volume
and country income level, although with wide variability
in volumes and growth rates between countries within
each income category. For example, Indonesia and Viet-
nam had considerably higher sales volumes and growth
rates in contrast to other L-MIC such as Egypt, India and
Pakistan. The UK, Australia, New Zealand and Saudi
Arabia had considerably higher sales volumes and growth
rates than most other H-IC, particularly Scandinavian and
Eastern European countries such as Denmark, Sweden
and Croatia.
Table 3 describes MF product category sales volumes
in 2013 as well as historic and projected 5-year growth
rates for the country income categories and for countries
with
the
largest
infant/child
populations.
Figure
3
demonstrates MF category sales trends for the country
income categories. Between 2008 and 2013 the total
world MF sales volume grew by 40·8 % from 5·5 to 7·8 kg
per infant/child
per year,
a rate
greatly exceeding
GDP growth over the same period. Between 2014 and
2018 this figure is projected to increase by 30·4 % to
10·8 kg per infant/child per year, with growth led by
the infant and follow-up categories. The toddler category
demonstrated the strongest growth in the 2008–2013
period; however, the infant and follow-up formula cate-
gories were more significant in terms of absolute volume
growth. The infant and follow-up formula categories are
predicted to account for most of world volume growth in
2014–2018.
Much of the recent growth was explained by U-MIC,
where total MF sales volume per infant/child grew by
71·7 % in 2008–2013, led by China, Brazil, Peru and
Turkey. Growth was also strong in L-MIC led by Indonesia
and Vietnam, although with some exceptions (e.g. Indo-
nesia) absolute sales volumes were comparatively low;
whereas 19·9 kg per infant/child of total MF was sold in
H-IC in 2013, this figure was only 2·8 kg in L-MIC.
Although total MF sales grew in H-IC, many of the largest
markets, namely France, Japan, Korea, USA and Russia,
underwent negative growth in the infant and follow-up
categories. However, many H-IC demonstrated strong
growth in toddler formula. Hong Kong was an outlier with
a total MF volume of 256·9 kg per infant/child in 2013, and
growth of 83·5 % over the 2008–2013 period, likely
resulting from sales for informal export into neighbouring
China. Some H-IC, for example New Zealand, Australia,
Ireland and France, are significant dairy producers and
high volumes in these countries may also partly reflect
sales for informal export.
Figure 4 shows MF category sales trends in U-MIC and
L-MIC by region. Volume growth in all regions has been
led by the infant and follow-up formula categories.
Follow-up formula sales volumes exceeded infant formula
volumes in all regions except Latin America and sub-
Saharan Africa. The rate and scale of change in the East
Asia and Pacific region exceeded that of all other regions;
in 2008–2013 total MF sales there grew by 72·8 % from
9·8 to 16·9 kg per infant/child. In 2014–2018 this figure is
projected to increase by 57·7 % to 26·6 kg per infant/child.

2543
 explained much of the regional growth, with total MF sales
growing by 106·0, 69·4, 40·0 and 96·9 %, respectively, in
2008–2013. China has undergone the most significant
change in formula sales over the period 2008–2013
because of its relatively high category sales volumes and
growth rates, but also because of its large infant/child
population size. The Philippines is the only country in this
region where the market contracted. The Middle East and
North Africa region also demonstrated strong volume
growth led by Iran and Turkey with total MF growth rates
of 53·6 and 80·2 %, respectively, in 2008–2013. The Latin
America region demonstrated some heterogeneity; while
total MF sales in Brazil and Peru grew by 132·5 and
159·7 %, respectively, over the period 2008–2013, for
Mexico this figure was just 11·4 %. In sub-Saharan Africa
the low level of observed growth was led by South Africa,
with total MF growth of 37·0 % in 2008–2013. Among all
regions, sales volumes and growth rates were lowest in
South Asia, with negligible total MF volume growth in
India and negative growth in Pakistan.

 Discussion
In contrast to stable trends in global exclusive breast-
feeding measures(7), the total world MF sales volume grew
by 40·8 % from 5·5 to 7·8 kg per infant/child in the period
2008–2013. This figure is projected to increase to 10·8 kg
per infant/child by 2018. Volume growth has been led by
the infant (0–6 months) and follow-up (7–12 months)
formula categories. This indicates that a population-level
IYCF transition towards diets higher in MF is not only well
underway, but is expected to continue, and in some
regions and countries continues apace. Volume growth
has occurred most rapidly in the middle-income countries
of East and South-East Asia: China, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand and Vietnam. UNICEF recently called attention to
the ‘alarming’ decline in breast-feeding rates in this
region(33). As home to the world’s second largest infant/

 urbanization(34). Historical analyses demonstrate a decline in
breast-feeding rates in several countries, reaching a historic
low in the 1950s–1960s alongside the increasing hospitali-
zation and medicalization of births and more intensive
MF marketing(35–37). What appears to be novel is that the
contemporary IYCF transition is likely to be characterized by
rapid growth in MF sales and ultimately consumption, and
that this is potentially unprecedented in terms of the rate and
scale of change. Why now? Why especially in East and
South-East Asia? The results must be understood against a
backdrop of contemporary transformations to economic,
social and political systems that are driving changes in the
demand and supply of processed foods globally.
A theory of ‘nutrition transition’ can be adapted to pro-
pose that with increasing income growth, urbanization and
female labour-force participation (i.e. factors generally
associated
with
economic
development)
infant/child
populations shift to higher levels of MF consumption(38–40).
The results support this theory, demonstrating a positive
though variable association between MF sales and country
income level with the most rapid changes observed in East
Asian middle-income countries with high rates of GDP
growth. However, sales growth has significantly outpaced
GDP growth, suggesting that income change only partly
explains the reported results. East Asia also has some of the
highest rates of rural–urban migration globally with China
and Vietnam expected to urbanize most rapidly in coming
decades(41). As with other processed foods, this urbaniza-
tion is likely to increase population-level accessibility to MF.
The large-scale global increase in effective demand for MF
may also be explained by the contemporary ‘feminization’
of East Asia’s manufacturing workforce, particularly in the
region’s export processing and special economic zones
where women can comprise between 70 and 90 % of the
workforce(42). In the absence of supportive working con-
ditions (e.g. adequate maternity leave, paid lactation
breaks, flexible working hours and nursing facilities),
formula-feeding can be less time intensive and more con-
venient than breast-feeding for working mothers . Formula
also enables other carers to feed the infant(43,44).
A theory of ‘dietary dependency’ can be adapted to
propose that with global market integration the traditional
IYCF systems of developing countries (i.e. predominantly
breast-feeding and home-prepared complementary foods)
are displaced by, and thus increasingly dependent on,
the imports, investments and marketing practices of
transnational milk formula corporations (TMFC)(29). This is
particularly relevant to IYCF because the biology of breast-
feeding means that the form of dependency is extreme
when short-term lactation capacity is lost at an individual
level (i.e. mammary involution due to bottle-feeding) and
when cultural norms are changed (i.e. a shift from ‘breast-
feeding’ to ‘formula-feeding’ culture) at the population
level. Commercial marketing and promotion facilitates this
dependency by normalizing formula as an appropriate
food for all infants rather than as a specialized food for
those unable to breast-feed(45–47). Dependency can impair
infant and young child food security when there are dis-
ruptions
to
formula
supply,
accessibility
(including
affordability) and capacity to utilize(48).

 Abbot Laboratories(15). There are strong incentives for
these companies to expand transnationally. MF is highly
lucrative with reported net profit margins of 10–20 %. The
global total MF sales value was $US 44·8 billion in 2014,
projected to reach $US 70·6 billion by 2019. In 2014, the
Chinese MF market alone was worth $US 17·8 billion(12).
With stagnating growth in the more heavily regulated
high-income markets, developing Asian countries are seen
as new growth opportunities given their rising income
levels, young and growing populations, and openness to
foreign investment(49). Additionally, TMFC often donate
large quantities of MF to countries in post-disaster situa-
tions, potentially undermining breast-feeding in this con-
text. This is most pertinent for the Asia-Pacific region, the
world’s most disaster prone(50).
Approximately 10 % of MF sales is spent on marketing
and promotion(51). Extrapolating this to the reported
global sales value we estimate a global MF marketing
expenditure of $US 4·48 billion in 2014. MF is marketed
directly to consumers through online and print advertising,
and indirectly through health systems, sponsorship of
professional
organizations
and
lobbying
of
policy
makers(12). Such marketing can powerfully influence
social norms about IYCF through inter alia portraying MF
as a symbol of modernity, as comparable or superior to
breast milk, and formula-feeding as extensively prac-
tised(46). Strong evidence implicates MF marketing during
the perinatal period, especially the distribution of free or
low-cost samples and maternity discharge packs to health-
care workers and mothers, with reduced rates of breast-
feeding
initiation,
duration
and
exclusivity(12).
This
underpins the requirement of the Baby Friendly Hospitals
Initiative (BFHI) that hospitals are free of intrusive efforts
to market BMS(37). Evidence demonstrates that the BFHI
has had a significant positive effect on exclusive breast-
feeding rates at national and global levels. However, the
most recent monitoring data indicate that just 27·5 %
(representing 21 328 hospitals) of all maternities world-
wide had ever been designated as baby friendly, repre-
senting 8·5 % of those in industrialized countries and 31 %
in less developed countries(52).
The strong growth in the follow-up formula and toddler
formula categories observed in the present analysis is
concerning. Since 1986 the WHO has maintained that
follow-up formula is both unnecessary and unsuitable as a
BMS from 6 months of age onwards. Further, existing
formulations can result in excessive protein intake and
inadequate intakes of essential fatty acids, vitamins and
minerals(19). Sales growth in these categories may reflect a
market segmentation strategy whereby TMFC are exploit-
ing the erroneous perception that breast-feeding applies to
the first 6 months only, and not to continued breast-
feeding(53). The branding, packaging and labelling of
follow-up formula and toddler formula products fre-
quently resembles and is commonly mistaken for infant
formula(16,18,45).
This can circumvent
MF
regulations
focused exclusively on the 0–6 month age bracket and
may be exacerbated when IYCF policies and programmes
emphasize exclusive breast-feeding only, and not ongoing
breast-feeding(54).
The variability in the observed GDP–sales relationship
demonstrates that an IYCF transition is not an inevitable
consequence of economic growth. Several middle-income
and high-income countries have achieved comparatively
low sales levels. Government decisions concerning the
regulation of MF markets, as well as those concerning
breast-feeding protection, promotion and support, are
likely to be important determinants of country-level dif-
ferences. For example, one analysis found a significant
positive association between indicators of country-level
implementation of the Global Strategy for Infant and
Young Child Feeding and trends in exclusive breast-
feeding and
breast-feeding duration
over a 20-year
period(55). Further research is required to ascertain asso-
ciations between these same measures and global MF
sales patterns. Nevertheless, we now explore some of the
most important policy and regulatory factors likely to be
shaping MF markets.
Weak and inadequately implemented MF marketing
regulation is likely to be a key explanatory factor in the
observed differences in between-country sales. Violations
of the WHO/UNICEF International Code of Marketing of
Breast-milk Substitutes and subsequent resolutions (The
Code) by formula companies are common in both devel-
oped and developing countries(56–58). The Code is not
legally binding under international law (adopted under
Article 23 of the WHO constitution), nor is it enforceable
under domestic law unless adopted into national legisla-
tion(56). According to the latest WHO monitoring report
only thirty-seven (19 %) out of 199 reporting countries had
adopted all of the recommendations into law, just sixty-
nine (35 %) had fully prohibited the advertising of BMS,
and forty-five (23 %) had a functioning implementation
and monitoring system(56). In those with active monitoring
systems many are under-resourced and do not impose
legal sanctions against industry violators(58). Internet
marketing channels, including social media, are new
sources of non-compliance(59). In China, undoubtedly the
engine of the contemporary global MF sales boom, many
provisions of The Code were adopted into legislation in
1995. However, the legislative scope is outdated and
applies to the 0–4 month age category only, imple-
mentation and enforcement have been reported as weak
and poorly coordinated, and Code violations appear to be
common and widespread(12,57,60). In contrast, regulatory
responses appear to have constrained formula markets in
several countries. For example, sales volumes and growth
in India are negligible and at least partly explained by that
Government’s full adoption of The Code into legislation
with a scope of 0–24 months of age(45,56). Another country
with comparatively low levels of MF sales is Brazil where
The Code is fully adopted into legislation covering
Rapid global growth in infant formula sales
2547
 0–36 months of age, is rigorously monitored and has been
regularly strengthened in response to violations (although
sales are now beginning to grow rapidly)(12,56).
Maternity protection regulations determine the com-
patibility of IYCF choices with formal maternal employ-
ment. In the context of absent or ineffective regulation, the
choice of whether to formula-feed or breast-feed is not a
true choice. For many, formula-feeding is the only choice
if the alternative is the loss of employment and income.
Indeed, it is more common for new mothers to stay
employed and use BMS rather than leave work or school
in order to breast-feed(12). This not only discriminates
against the combined economic and reproductive rights of
women but also against the rights of the child to adequate
nutrition. The Maternity Protection Convention of the
International Labour Organization protects against mater-
nity
discrimination
and
provides
for
adequate
paid
maternity leave (minimum of 14 but preferably 18 weeks
at two-thirds of earnings), the right to continue breast-
feeding on return to work, paid nursing breaks and access
to appropriate and hygienic nursing facilities. Yet the most
recent monitoring report found that most countries in Asia
(81 %), the Middle East (92 %) and Latin America (79 %) fail
to meet the minimum leave and earnings standards. Just
31 % have legislated the mandatory provision of nursing
facilities.
Subsequently,
830
million
(68 %)
working
women worldwide do not have adequate maternity pro-
tection, of whom 80 % live in Africa and Asia. Just 330
million (28·4 %) are legally entitled to receive cash pay-
ments in the event of childbirth(61).
Free trade agreements, which have been extensive in
East Asia in recent decades, reduce barriers to the move-
ment of investments, production capacity, raw materials
and final products across borders(49). These processes
enable TMFC to more easily expand their operations
through the establishment of transnational networks of
affiliate firms and highly coordinated global supply
chains(62). Contemporary large-scale increases in dairy
production for export in many countries, particularly New
Zealand, have provided TMFC with a ready supply of milk
powder, the primary ingredient used in formula produc-
tion(53,62). The liberalization of trade in retail services has
also
spurred
the
‘supermarketization’
of
developing
countries since the late 1990s, creating new MF distribu-
tion channels. In this context, government regulators face
the paradoxical challenge of balancing the investments
and thus opportunities for economic development TMFC
provide against the public health implications of those
investments. This is especially the case when companies
such as Nestle and Danone are among the largest oper-
ating in developing countries and when government
agencies have only limited capacity to weigh the public
health implications(49).
In some countries conflicts in government policy objec-
tives exist. For example, more than half of MF purchases in
the USA are by the Government through its Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children(63). In China, MF consumption is promoted by
government subsidies with the aim of developing the
domestic industry including the development of new for-
mula products(51). The MF industry also generates large tax
revenues, creating an incentive to maintain or encourage
market growth. This is especially likely when the significant
economic value of reproductive services, including breast-
feeding, is excluded from national accounting systems(51).
In East Asia’s so-called ‘productivist welfare states’ we
hypothesize that MF may be viewed by policy makers as
instrumental
to
female
labour-force
participation
and
therefore to economic development, although this requires
further investigation(64).
There are several limitations of the current analysis. The
market data used capture sales volume only, an imperfect
measure of consumption because it does not capture BMS
products distributed through informal food systems or
wastage (i.e. the proportion of MF sold but not con-
sumed). Sales volumes may not accurately reflect domestic
consumption in some markets due to high sales for
informal export. For example, in Hong Kong total MF was
256·9 kg per infant/child in 2013 reflecting cross-border
purchases by mainland Chinese consumers. High sales
volumes in several high-income countries (e.g. New
Zealand) also partly reflect informal cross-border trade.
As described elsewhere, Euromonitor Passport is not a
scholarly database and the data have similar limitations to
official government trade and economic statistics(29). The
data have not been validated from a nutritional standpoint
through,
for
example,
comparisons
with
household
expenditure or food consumption surveys. However,
these data have several merits: their abundance, that they
are not subject to recall bias (i.e. in contrast with survey
data) and that they have been consistently reported across
countries and time using standardized measures(29). Lack
of comparable longitudinal data prevented analysis of the
relationship between MF consumption and breast-feeding
prevalence and duration. Thus there is an implicit
assumption in the present analysis that MF displaces breast
milk in infant and young child diets, rather than reflecting
the potential substitution of MF for other BMS such as
animal milks. Finally, we have not reported within-country
MF sales patterns although a ‘social transition’ inverse to
breast-feeding is likely, with formula-feeding initially most
prevalent among high-income groups and then in low-
income groups over the course of a country’s economic
and social development(34).
Conclusions
A global population-level IYCF transition towards diets
higher in milk-based formulas, especially infant and
follow-up formulas consumed in the first year of life, is
well underway, is expected to continue, and in some
2548
P Baker et al.
 regions and countries continues apace. While the concept
of such a transition is not new, the observed rapidity in
growth and volumes per infant/child is unprecedented.
This transition is most evident in the middle-income
countries of East Asia, particularly China, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Because of the large
infant/child population in this region, regulatory decisions
there concerning IYCF are likely to have an important
impact on global infant, child and maternal health over
coming decades. The results also raise serious concern that
the rapid changes observed are not being captured in a
timely manner by existing international IYCF monitoring
systems. Important questions must also be raised about the
efficacy of existing policy and regulatory regimes intended
to protect the health of children and mothers and to pre-
vent unethical formula marketing. As described elsewhere,
greater
political
priority,
strengthened
governance
mechanisms and strategic actions for IYCF are urgently
needed(47,53,54,58). New institutions established by WHO/
UNICEF including the Global Breastfeeding Advocacy
Initiative and the Network for Global Monitoring and
Support for Implementation of the International Code
(NetCode) may provide important platforms for coordi-
nating global action(47). The present analysis affirms a need
for renewed efforts towards the implementation, monitor-
ing and enforcement of The Code, including stronger
accountability mechanisms for governments and industry.
