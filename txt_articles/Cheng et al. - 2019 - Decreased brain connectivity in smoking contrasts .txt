Abstract In a group of 831 participants from the general population in the Human Connectome
Project, smokers exhibited low overall functional connectivity, and more specifically of the lateral
orbitofrontal cortex which is associated with non-reward mechanisms, the adjacent inferior frontal
gyrus, and the precuneus. Participants who drank a high amount had overall increases in resting
state functional connectivity, and specific increases in reward-related systems including the medial
orbitofrontal cortex and the cingulate cortex. Increased impulsivity was found in smokers,
associated with decreased functional connectivity of the non-reward-related lateral orbitofrontal
cortex; and increased impulsivity was found in high amount drinkers, associated with increased

 functional connectivity of the reward-related medial orbitofrontal cortex. The main findings were
cross-validated in an independent longitudinal dataset with 1176 participants, IMAGEN. Further,
the functional connectivities in 14-year-old non-smokers (and also in female low-drinkers) were
related to who would smoke or drink at age 19. An implication is that these differences in brain
functional connectivities play a role in smoking and drinking, together with other factors.

Introduction
Recent statistics have shown not only the widespread use of cigarettes and alcohol, but also the co-
occurrence of these high risk behaviors. Although dopamine mechanisms in the basal ganglia have
been implicated in addiction there is also considerable evidence for cortical, especially prefrontal
cortical, involvement (Ersche et al., 2011; Goldstein and Volkow, 2011; Ersche et al., 2012;
Ersche et al., 2013). For example, a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study found that smokers
exhibited reduced gray matter volumes and gray matter densities in frontal regions including pre-
frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate gyrus, as compared with non-smokers
(Wang et al., 2015). Resting state functional connectivity differences involving the prefrontal cortex
and insula have also been described in smokers (Fedota and Stein, 2015; Yuan et al., 2016;
Bi et al., 2017; Sutherland and Stein, 2018). A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study
found that increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
activation during ‘relaxing’ trials was correlated with high alcohol cue–induced and stress-induced
craving in early recovering alcohol-dependent patients (Seo et al., 2013). These neuroimaging stud-
ies in substance use behaviors suggest that the prefrontal cortex plays a key role in such behaviors.
The high levels of comorbidity in using cigarettes and alcohol demonstrated by a wealth of epide-
miological and genetic data (Farrell et al., 2001; Agrawal and Lynskey, 2006) makes it important
to consider the neurobiological commonalities and differences associated with these two drugs,
especially when they are consumed together. Thus, King et al. (2010) found that consumption of a
moderately intoxicating oral dose of alcohol increased ratings of the desire to smoke, and moreover
that alcohol amplified ventral striatum reactivity to appetitive cues associated with smoking in young
individuals who tend to use cigarettes in the context of alcohol intoxication.
Most studies have used relatively small sample sizes and focused on brain regions rather than
brain circuits identified with functional connectivity. Further, common and distinct connectivity fea-
tures underlying the use of different substances such as nicotine and alcohol have not been fully
explored with large numbers of participants (Zhu et al., 2017; Sutherland and Stein, 2018). In this
study, we examined whole-brain functional connectivity (i.e. not limited by particular hypotheses and
therefore unbiased) in groups using nicotine, or alcohol, or both, based on a large sample size (831
subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (and cross-validated by another 1176 subjects
from the IMAGEN collaboration as described in the Materials and methods) with resting-state func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The aim was to identify shared and distinct patterns
of different functional connectivity in smokers and drinkers in a sufficiently large sample to ensure
sufficient statistical power to provide robust findings on associations between functional connectivity
and smoking and drinking. Moreover, by including assessment of smoking and drinking in the same
study, we aimed to provide robust evidence on whether there were differences in functional connec-
tivity in smokers and drinkers. We also investigated aspects of substance use and impulsive behavior
that might relate to the changes in neural connectivity, and that might provide information about
the causation and aetiology of substance use.
Results
Decreased functional connectivity (FC) patterns for smoking
In the HCP participants, 273 links had significantly lower resting state functional connectivity in the
smoking group compared to the non-smoking group (after FDR correction p<0.005). Table 1 shows
the strengths of the top 30 significantly different FC links between smokers and non-smokers.
Figure 1A shows in the lower triangle matrix that functional connectivity across all FC links of the
smoking group relative to the non-smoking group was lower overall (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure

 supplements 1, 2, 3 and 4); and the upper triangle matrix shows which FC links were significantly
lower in the smoking group (p<0.005, FDR corrected). The links that are lower in the smoking group
are shown in Figure 2B. Many (90) of the significantly different links involved the lateral orbitofrontal
cortex (AAL2 areas OFClat and Frontal_Inf_Orb_2) and the adjacent inferior frontal gyrus (pars trian-
gularis BA45 and pars opercularis BA44) (Table 1). These areas had lower functional connectivity
with areas such as the hippocampus, temporal lobe, supramarginal gyrus, and insula (Figure 2).
Figure 2B and Table 1 show that in addition to these lower functional connectivities of the lateral
orbitofrontal cortex and related inferior temporal gyrus areas, there was also lower functional con-
nectivity for the middle and superior frontal gyri, mid- and superior temporal gyri, precuneus, hippo-
campus, and basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, and pallidum). Table 1 shows, by contrast with the
lateral orbitofrontal cortex, that there were only two significant medial orbitofrontal cortex areas
(OFCmed) in this set of different functional connectivities in the smoking group.
Increased functional connectivity patterns for high vs low drinking
In the HCP participants, the top 30 significantly different FC links between the low drinking and high
drinking group are shown in Table 1 (and Figure 3 shows all 214 significantly different FC links after
FDR correction with p<0.05). All the significantly different links are higher in the high level of drink-
ing group (HA, high amount) compared to the low level of drinking group (LA, low amount) (except
one FC between OFClat_R and Angular_R).
Figure 1B shows in the lower triangle matrix that across all links (except one) the functional con-
nectivity of the HA group relative to the LA group was higher overall; and the upper triangle matrix
shows the FC links that were significantly higher in the HA drinking group than the LA group
(p<0.05, FDR corrected). Those links that are higher in the HA group than the LA group are shown
in Figure 3, which show that, in addition to much higher functional connectivity involving the left
medial orbitofrontal cortex, there was also higher functional connectivity for the cingulate cortex,
supramarginal gyrus, globus pallidus, and pre-/post-central cortex. Table 1 shows the top 30 links
eLife digest To understand why people become addicted to alcohol or smoking, it is important
to look at how the brains of people who use these substances may be different than those who
abstain. Many studies show that substance use activates the reward systems in the brain via a
chemical called dopamine. Changes or differences in parts of the brain that control decision-making
and restraint also have been implicated in substance use.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one tool scientists can use to explore such
differences. It can measure how well different parts of the brain are communicating with each other
by measuring their activity when a person is at rest. The patterns of activity reveal which parts of the
brain are working closely together or have high functional connectivity and which parts are less well
connected, or have low functional connectivity.
Cheng, Rolls et al. measured the functional connectivity between different parts of the brain in
people who smoke and people who drink alcohol. Smokers had a low overall functional connectivity
between brain regions. Specifically, they had weaker connections involving two brain regions that
help people change or stop a behavior, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus.
These differences may make people more impulsive and less able to resist smoking. The stimulating
effects of nicotine may enhance communication between different parts of the brain, so people also
may use it to overcome some underlying communication deficits. Those who drink alcohol had high
overall functional connectivity. Reward-related systems, including the medial orbitofrontal cortex
and the cingulate cortex, were especially strongly connected. This may make them more sensitive to
the rewarding aspects of drinking, or more impulsive.
To confirm their results, Cheng, Rolls et al. analyzed fMRI data from another study. These showed
that the characteristic differences in brain connectivity were already present in 14-year olds who
would go on to drink or smoke at age 19. This suggests that these functional connectivity
differences in the brain make people more likely to smoke or drink.

 for the high drinking group, which are all higher compared to the low drinking (LA) group. Ten of
the top 30 links involved higher functional connectivity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and 13
higher functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex.
Comparisons between drinking and smoking
For the HCP participants, Figure 1C shows the distribution of the t values of all 4371 FC links (i.e.
between all 94 AAL2 areas) in the drinking and smoking groups respectively. Almost all links across
the whole brain were increased in the drinking group but decreased in the smoking group. Further
analysis shows that the t values of the links in the smoking group were significantly negatively corre-
lated with those in the drinking group (r = �0.289, p<10�10) (Figure 1D) and this finding was well

 cross-validated in an independent IMAGEN dataset (Figure 7C, r = �0.442, p<10�10). This finding
indicates a complementarity between the functional connectivities in drinkers and smokers. That is, if
links were high in the smoking group, they tended to be low in the drinking group. This provides evi-
dence that a difference in one direction (lower) may relate to smoking, and in an opposite direction
(higher) to drinking.
We also performed a direct comparison between drinkers and smokers, to ensure that the results
were not subject simply to possible baseline differences in the different control groups. In this con-
trast, we found, as predicted, that links involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (Frontal_Inf_Orb_2
and OFClat) were significantly (with FDR correction) positive, indicating that the lateral orbitofrontal
cortex links are lower in smokers than drinkers. Further, also as predicted, medial orbitofrontal cor-
tex and related areas (including OFCpost and Olf) were significantly more positive, indicating that
the medial orbitofrontal cortex links are greater in drinkers than smokers, consistent with the other
analyses in this investigation. Details are provided in the source data of Figure 4.
Comparison between smokers, drinkers, and both smokers and
drinkers
To analyse functional connectivity in those who both smoke and drink, the following comparison
between four groups was made, with a common baseline group who neither smoked nor drank.
Functional connectivity was compared over four groups (i.e smoking only n = 60, drinking only
n = 219, and both smoking and drinking n = 143) using a common baseline comparison group (a no
smoking and low drinking group n = 198) from the HCP dataset. Figure 4A shows the distribution
of t values of all the links for all AAL2 areas for the three comparisons. This shows that the functional
connectivity values for the smoking plus drinking group were similar to those for the only smoking
group.
For Figure 4B–D only the significantly different links identified in the HCP dataset as shown in
Figures 2 and 3 are considered. Figure 4B confirms that all these links are lower in the smoking
only group. Figure 4C confirms that almost all these links are higher in the drinking only group.
Figure 4D shows that there are mainly lower links in the group that both smokes and drinks. Fig-
ure 4—source data 1 shows that for the links that are lower in the smoking group as shown in
Table 1, they are also lower in the smoking only group, and the both smoking and drinking group.
Figure 4—source data 2 shows that for the links that are higher in the drinking group as shown in
Table 1, they are also higher in the drinking only group, while some are higher and some are lower
in the both smoking and drinking group.
Thus the group that both smokes and drinks shows a combination of the links found to be differ-
ent in the smoking group, and of those found to be different in the drinking group. However, it was
noticeable that in the combined smoking and drinking group the difference in functional connectivity
from the controls for the increases and decreases (expressed as a t value) found were smaller than in
the only drinking or only smoking group (Figure 4).
In summary, participants who both smoked and drank had a combination of the specifically differ-
ent links in those who only smoked or only drank, and these links had on average lower functional
connectivity. An implication is that the differences in functional connectivity in smokers and drinkers
described in this paper can, when combined, be related to, and potentially contribute to, both
smoking and drinking in the same individual.

 Correlation between the functional connectivity and the amount of
smoking and drinking
Figure 5A,B shows that for the smoking group, there was a negative correlation between the mean
strength of functional connectivity for both the significantly different links (n = 369, r = �0.102,
p=0.031, permutation test) and the links for the whole brain (n = 830, r = �0.080, p=0.026) with the
frequency of smoking across individuals. (This is consistent with the finding that the functional con-
nectivity is lower in smokers.). It should be noted that all correlation analyses involving identified
links were performed only within the smoking (or high drinking) group.
Figure 5C, D shows that for the drinking group, there was a positive correlation between the
mean strength of FCs for the links for the whole brain (n = 782, r = 0.075, p=0.037) and a trend also
for significantly different links (n = 471, r = 0.069, p=0.07, permutation test) and the amount of
drinking across individuals (drinks per drinking day in the past 12 months). (This is consistent with
the finding that the FCs are higher in drinkers).
Further, we found that this pattern of changes with the amount of use also applied to most of the
significant links for both smoking (Figure 5E) and drinking (Figure 5F). Specifically, 269 out of 273
links associated with smoking showed a negative correlation with the frequency of smoking, and 54
of these 273 identified links were significant (p<0.05 uncorrected). In addition, 177 out of 214 links
associated with drinking showed a positive correlation with the drinks per drinking day, and 38 of
these 214 identified links were significant (p<0.05 uncorrected).
Correlation between the functional connectivities involved in smoking
and drinking, and impulsivity (assessed by temporal discounting)
We also investigated the relationship between the amount of smoking and drinking, with inhibitory
control related to impulsivity (measured by the delay discounting score). Figure 6A,B shows that
there was a negative correlation between the frequency of smoking and both the delay discounting
scores, DDisc_AUC_200 (n = 830, r = �0.120, p=6.0 � 10�4) and DDisc_AUC_40K (n = 830,
r = �0.088, p=0.012). There was also a negative correlation between the amount of drinking and
both the delay discounting scores, DDisc_AUC_200 (n = 782, r = �0.122, p=7.0 � 10�4, Figure 6C)
and DDisc_AUC_40K (n = 782, r = �0.033, p=0.036, Figure 6D). Thus higher impulsivity was associ-
ated with more drinking and more smoking in the drinking and smoking groups. Furthermore,
canonical correlation analysis (CCA) revealed a significant model that relates functional connectivity
levels to the delay discounting score for the drinking group (Figure 6G, n = 782, r = 0.575,
p=9.9 � 10�4; Figure 6H, r = 0.572, p=0.002) with the same direction for the smoking group
(Figure 6E, n = 830, r = 0.643, p=0.005; Figure 6F, r = 0.610, p=0.185). (The links involved in this
analysis were all of the links shown in Figure 2B (for smoking) and Figure 3B (for drinking), ‘all links’
(with a different number of links for the two cases)).
The findings are consistent with decreases of functional connectivity in areas such as the lateral
orbitofrontal cortex and the adjacent inferior frontal cortex being associated with greater impulsivity
in the smoking group as measured with the delay discounting score.
For the drinking group, the significant increases in functional connectivity in the medial orbito-
frontal cortex found in this group (Figure 3B) were associated with greater impulsivity. This may indi-
cate that higher functional connectivity of the reward-related medial orbitofrontal cortex areas
(Rolls, 2017; Rolls, 2018b) can be associated with increased impulsivity, possibly arising because
rewards are driving behavior more strongly.
We further found that these measures of impulsivity had relatively high correlations, with respect
to the 68 behavior measures in the HCP, with the smoking and drinking, and their related functional
connectivities.

 Cross-validation using the IMAGEN dataset
Using a separate dataset (IMAGEN (Schumann et al., 2010)) we cross-validated the findings, as fol-
lows, with details provided in the Supplementary Material.
The results of this cross-validation for smoking are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7A shows the distri-
bution of t values of the links between all AAL2 areas in the HCP and IMAGEN dataset at age 19.
(Age 19 was used because by then some participants were smoking, and some were not.) The lower
global (i.e. overall) functional connectivity found with the HCP dataset was confirmed in the IMAGEN
dataset, with significant differences from zero at age 19 for smoking (t = �55.53, p<10�10, one sam-
ple t-test). With respect to cross-validation of the specific links identified in the HCP dataset,
Figure 7D shows that these links also had a significantly lower distribution of values compared to
the comparison control group for the IMAGEN dataset at age 19 (one sample t-test, t = �13.00,
p<10�10).
For the drinking, the results of the cross-validation are also shown in Figure 7. Figure 7B shows
the distribution of t values of the links between all AAL2 areas in the HCP and IMAGEN datasets at
age 19. (Age 19 was used because by then some participants were drinking, and some were not.)
The higher global functional connectivity found with the HCP dataset was confirmed in the IMAGEN
dataset, with a significant difference from zero for the IMAGEN dataset at age 19 (t = 98.00,
p<10�10, one sample t-test). Figure 7E shows that the significant links for drinking identified in the
HCP dataset also had a significantly higher distribution of t values compared to the comparison con-
trol group for the IMAGEN dataset at age 19 (one sample t-test, t = 15.32, p<10�10). As described
in the Supplementary Material, the comparison group was the low-drinkers.
Association between the functional connectivity at age 14 and the
smoking and drinking at age 19
To investigate whether the functional connectivity at 14 might be related to whether a participant
became a smoker by age 19, a longitudinal analysis with the same IMAGEN participants was per-
formed. The 19 years olds were split into two approximately equal size groups, of smokers vs non-
smokers. For each link, its value in the 14 years olds was compared between those who were smok-
ers and non-smokers at age 19 with a two sample t test. For the overall connectivity, this provided
4371 t values. A one-sample t-test was then performed for whether the mean of these t-values was
lower than 0 in those who became smokers at 19. That test was significant (t = �47.51, p<10�10,
Figure 7A), providing evidence that the value overall of the links was lower at 14 in those who
became smokers at 19. With respect to the significantly different links between smokers and non-
smokers identified in the HCP dataset, the test was also significant (t = �12.23, p<10�10,
Figure 7D), providing evidence that the values of the significantly different links found in the HCP
dataset were lower at age 14 in the IMAGEN dataset in those who became smokers at 19. An impli-
cation is that the low functional connectivities may not simply be produced by smoking, but may
instead contribute to the tendency to smoke.
Similar tests for drinking found analogous effects (t = 15.31, p<10�10 for the overall links
(Figure 7B), and t = 7.06, p<10�10 for the specific links (Figure 7E)) in female, but not in male,
IMAGEN participants.
The relation between impulsivity at age 14 and the smoking and
drinking at age 19
The analyses of impulsivity with the IMAGEN dataset are considered next. First, the impulsivity is sig-
nificantly positively correlated with the frequency of smoking (r = 0.106, p=1.4 � 10�4) and the
amount of drinking (r = 0.064, p=0.022) at age 19. The results for impulsivity at age 14 are shown in
Figure 7F. The 14 year olds who will smoke at age 19 (n = 421) have higher impulsivity than those
who will not smoke at 19 (n = 184) (t = �3.72, p=2.20 � 10�4). The 14 year olds who will drink at

 age 19 (n = 527) have higher impulsivity than those who will not drink at 19 (n = 298) (t = �3.67,

Discussion
Smokers and drinkers had contrasting patterns of cortical functional connectivity involving the orbi-
tofrontal cortex. Smokers relative to non-smokers exhibited reduced functional connectivity involving
the lateral orbitofrontal cortex which is implicated in stopping and changing behavior and thus to

 impulsive-compulsive disorders, and in related areas including the inferior frontal gyrus, superior
temporal gyrus, precuneus, and supramarginal gyrus (Figure 2A). By contrast, high drinkers relative
to low drinkers had higher functional connectivity in networks including the medial orbitofrontal cor-
tex (bilaterally though more on the left) which is involved in reward processing, and in related struc-
tures including the anterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, insula,
and superior temporal gyrus. In addition, the mean functional connectivity across the whole brain
was lower in smokers than non-smokers. In contrast, mean functional connectivity across the whole
brain was higher in high drinkers than low drinkers. The differences in both the overall and the iden-
tified links were correlated with the amount of smoking or drinking. For both the smoking and drink-
ing, the differences in overall functional connectivity were correlated with increased impulsivity.
These findings with the HCP dataset were cross-validated with the IMAGEN dataset. In addition,
analysis of the IMAGEN dataset showed that for the significantly different links between smokers
and non-smokers identified in the HCP dataset, those links were lower at age 14 in the IMAGEN
dataset in those who became smokers at 19 (Figure 7D). An implication is that the low functional
connectivities may not simply be produced by smoking, but may instead contribute to the tendency
to smoke. The same was found for the global functional connectivity (Figure 7A). For drinking, analy-
sis of the IMAGEN dataset showed that for the significantly different links between high drinkers
and low drinkers identified in the HCP dataset, those links were higher at age 14 in the IMAGEN
dataset in those who became high drinkers at 19 (Figure 7B,E) for females, though that effect was
not significant in the male participants.

 The low functional connectivity in smokers relative to non-smokers especially involved the lateral
orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann area 47/12) which is implicated in stopping and changing behavior,

Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2011; Rolls, 2014; Rolls, 2016), and when there is an instruction to stop in
the stop-signal task (Deng et al., 2017). This reduced connectivity also involved the inferior frontal
gyrus, pars opercularis (BA 44) and pars triangularis (BA45). Further, damage to the lateral orbito-
frontal cortex (Berlin et al., 2004; Rolls, 2014; Rolls, 2016) and to the right inferior frontal gyrus
(Aron et al., 2014) produces impulsive behavior (measured for example in the stop-signal task),
where impulsive behavior can be considered as behavior not directly inhibited by non-reward or
punishment feedback signals (Rolls, 2014; Rolls, 2017). Consistent with this, lower functional con-
nectivity involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex in the present study was related to increased
impulsiveness as measured by the delay discounting score (Figure 6). An implication is that smokers
may smoke in part because of increased impulsiveness and reduced sensitivity to non-reward and
punishment associated with reduced functional connectivity of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and
adjacent inferior temporal gyrus. Consistently, we found that the delay discounting score (DDS) was

 positively correlated with the strength of many of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex links (in the HCP
dataset). Thus high FC of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is correlated with low impulsivity.
The increased functional connectivity in drinkers relative to non-drinkers involved the medial orbi-
tofrontal cortex which is involved in reward processing (Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2011; Rolls, 2014;
Rolls, 2017) and structures to which it is connected including the anterior cingulate cortex, parahip-
pocampal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. We found that the delay dis-
counting score (DDS) was negatively correlated with the strength of many of the medial
orbitofrontal cortex links (in the HCP dataset). Thus high FC of the many medial OFC links was corre-
lated with high impulsivity, which correlated in turn with the amount of drinking. In rats, steeper
delay discounting (interpreted as greater impulsivity) is produced by lesions of the lateral OFC, and
reduced discounting by lesions of the medial OFC (Mar et al., 2011), possibly homologous regions
to those in the primate brain, suggesting a similar opponency of control over impulsivity by these
prefrontal cortex regions to that found in the present investigation in humans.
In the short term just after administration, alcohol increases impulsivity and decreases behavioral
inhibition (Smith et al., 2014) (and increases neurophysiological inhibition in some brain areas)
(Stephens et al., 2017). The mechanism for the increase in impulsivity produced by alcohol may
include reduced activity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, which tends to have activations recipro-
cally related to those of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (O’Doherty et al., 2001; Kringelbach and
Rolls, 2003; Rolls, 2016; Rolls et al., 2018a). The fact that both drinkers and smokers exhibited
greater impulsive choice is consistent with a possible causal role for impulsivity in either the initiation
of drinking or smoking or else its exacerbation, as well as other behaviors associated with impulsiv-
ity, including aggression in the case of alcohol consumption (Garofalo and Wright, 2017).
To check the main findings of this investigation, and to control for possible differences in the
comparison groups, we directly compared functional connectivity in drinkers and smokers. The
hypotheses were that functional connectivity involving the lateral orbitofrontal cortex would be
smaller in smokers than drinkers; that functional connectivity involving the medial orbitofrontal cor-
tex would be greater in drinkers than in smokers; and that the mean functional connectivity would
be higher in drinkers than non-smokers. All these hypotheses were confirmed by the direct compari-
son of drinkers – smokers in the Results section (see Figure 4).
Using a separate dataset (IMAGEN (Schumann et al., 2010)) we cross-validated the findings
obtained with the HCP dataset. In addition, analysis of the IMAGEN dataset showed that there was
an association between the low connectivity in smoking at age 14 (when participants were not smok-
ing) and whether at age 19 individuals were smoking. This association was found for both the global
functional connectivities (Figure 7A,B) and the specifically different functional connectivities
(Figure 7D,E). A similar relation was found in drinkers, namely that there was an association between
the high functional connectivitities at 14 and wherher an individual would be in the high drinking
group at age 19. This was significant for females, but not for males. An implication is that the differ-
ences in brain functional connectivities identified in this investigation may play a causal role in who
will become smokers or drinkers. It will be of interest in future to assess further whether the differen-
ces in functional connectivity described here in smokers and drinkers cause the smoking or drinking,
for example in research on alcohol drinking endophenotypes or smoking endophenotypes
(Ray et al., 2010; Ducci and Goldman, 2012). It is of course also a possibility that drinking may by
increasing impulsivity exacerbate the drinking.
The low functional connectivity that we describe here in smokers in frontal and associated areas
may be reflected in the hypofrontality that has previously been described in smokers and has been
associated in genome-wide association studies with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
human CHRNA5 gene, encoding the a5 nAcetylcholine receptor subunit, that increase the risks for
both smoking and schizophrenia (Barch et al., 2001; Hong et al., 2010; Tobacco and Tobacco and
Genetics Consortium, 2010); Schizophrenia Working Group of the Schizophrenia Working Group
of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014; Koukouli et al., 2017). So it is possible that smok-
ers self-administer nicotine which acting on this cholinergic receptor may increase cortical neuronal
firing, which stabilizes the activity of prefrontal attractor networks, making them more efficient at
cognitive control tasks involved in executive function. This has been proposed for the smoking in
schizophrenia (Rolls et al., 2008). Thus, we suggest that lower initial whole brain FC in smokers may
encourage them to enhance their functional connectivity and hence the functioning of the neural

 circuitry implicated in cognitive control; smoking can then be seen as a form of ‘self-medication’
which optimizes their behavior.
For female drinkers there was also an association between high functional connectivity at age 14
and who would be in the high drinking group at age 19. In this case a possible account for the drink-
ing is that it is related to increased functional connectivity or sensitivity of medial orbitofrontal cortex
and related reward circuitry, which makes the alcohol more rewarding, and which may also because
of the increased sensitivity to reward produce some increase in reward-related impulsivity
(Whelan et al., 2012). The acute effects of the alcohol may themselves reduce behavioral inhibition
and increase the drinking, thus exacerbating the drinking (Whelan et al., 2014).
Figures 1D and 7C show a negative correlation between the t values for all the connectivities in
the brain for drinkers vs smokers. This may be related to the fact that high values of t for the func-
tional connectivity relate to high drinking, and low values t for the functional connectivity relate to
smoking. Thus the negative correlation reflects whether individuals are more likely to perform an
action of either smoking or drinking. This reflects the fact that in this dataset those who smoke also
are more likely to drink. A common underlying factor might be impulsivity.
We note that although there were overall higher in FC in drinkers, and lower in smokers, to place
this in context, FCs were also smaller in males than females in this dataset in smokers and drinkers
(Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Accordingly, whilst we would not wish to over-interpret the differ-
ences in global mean FC in drinking and smoking, the negative correlation between all FCs in drink-
ing and smoking shown in Figure 1E is very suggestive that there is indeed complementarity of the
differences found in drinkers and smokers. An interpretation is that smoking and drinking are related
to opposite differences in some of many of the links involved. Examples from this investigation are
that medial orbitofrontal cortex links are decreased in smokers, but increased in drinkers; and vice
versa for lateral orbitofrontal cortex links.
The differences in functional connectivity described in this investigation were not due to any obvi-
ous possible confounding factors such as gender, ethnicity, level of education, marijuana use, or
basic brain structure (volume of gray and white matter), which were regressed out of the analysis.
The use of resting state fMRI is useful for this type of investigation as it does not require task per-
formance that might differ between participants, and such studies can for example predict behavior
(Rosenberg et al., 2016) and task performance (Tavor et al., 2016) in different individuals. Structure
based morphological comparisons for drinkers and smokers have been performed, but do not nec-
essarily relate closely to what is found with functional investigations, as parts of the brain may have
different physiology without much gross anatomical difference.
Possible limitations of this investigation are that linear analyses were used. It is also important to
stress that all participants were healthy adults, and that the levels of smoking and drinking exhibited
were not directly associated with diagnoses of substance dependence, although they may be rele-
vant to these disorders. Thus the effect size of this study involving the normal use of alcohol and cig-
arettes could be lower than in a case/control study. But the design of this study, use of individuals in
the general population, enable this investigation to have impact on public health, since the use of
substances for most of the smokers and drinkers was within a normal range, and we could identify
these changes by the use of two large-scale datasets. Although the current study was based on the
general population, the findings are in general consistent with previous studies based on clinical
populations. For example, chronic nicotine exposure associated with lower functional connectivity
was reported in a number of studies (Hong et al., 2009; Weiland et al., 2015). In addition, many
studies report that the orbitofrontal cortex, the key region identified in current study, play an impor-
tant role in the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction (Lucantonio et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2015;
Koob and Volkow, 2016). However, the results described here were obtained on populations from
the general community, and do not necessarily apply to heavy smokers or drinkers. Moreover, we
demonstrate with the IMAGEN dataset that the effect size is sufficient that there is a relation
between the brain functional connectivities that we identify at age 14 and who will smoke at age 19.
This is good evidence that the effects described in this paper are meaningful, in that the functional
connectivity at age 14 can be related to what will happen in terms of smoking and drinking five years
later. Additionally, we have removed several possible confounders that may distinguish the two
groups, but it might be useful in future investigations to investigate the relation of depression to
smoking and drinking. Another possible limitation is that impulsivity was assessed by delay discount-
ing, and it would be of interest to examine the relation to other measures of impulsivity. Another

 possible area in which future research might extend the findings reported here is that we focused on
the amount of drinking using the measure ‘drinking amount per drinking day’, as the relation
between the frequency of drinking and the functional connectivity was complex. But this enables us
to make an interesting point. The amount of alcohol consumed on a drinking day, the ‘amount’ mea-
sure, may well be related to how rewarding the consumption of the alcohol is. Once started on a
drinking day, an individual in the High Amount drinking group tends to have more, and this is consis-
tent with the reward value being high. That in turn is consistent with the higher functional connectiv-
ity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex found in the High Amount drinkers in this investigation, and
with the evidence that the medial orbitofrontal cortex contains a representation of reward value
(Rolls, 2014; Rolls, 2017; Rolls, 2018b). Another possible limitation of the drinking analysis is that
the control group was a low drinking group rather than a non-drinker group. The reason for this
choice was that only 55 participants did not drink any alcohol in the past 12 months, which would
have resulted in too small a sample size.
As shown in Figure 4, most of the links were lower in the group that both smokes and drinks.
One explanation is that the effect size for the comparison between non-smokers and regular smok-
ers is higher than the effect size for the comparison between low-drinkers and high drinkers.
In conclusion, we have related for the first time reduced functional connectivity involving the lat-
eral orbitofrontal cortex and related inferior frontal gyrus to smoking. We interpret the smoking as
being related to the increased impulsivity and decreased behavioral inhibition. In addition, smokers
have globally lower functional connectivity. A possible interpretation is that smokers may self-admin-
ister nicotine in order to increase brain functional connectivity and thereby attention and alertness.
We also describe for the first time that drinkers have increased functional connectivity of the medial
orbitofrontal cortex, a reward area, and globally increased functional connectivity as well as impul-
sive behavior. An interpretation is that there is a role in drinking of increased reward sensitivity
implemented in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. The increased impulsivity in drinkers may also be
related to increased reward processing in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and its connected areas.
These differences in functional connectivity may play a causal role, as shown by analyses showing
that there was an association between smoking or drinking at age 19 and the functional connectivi-
ties at age 14 of individuals who at 14 are not smoking or drinking. In both smokers and drinkers,
the increased impulsivity may exacerbate substance use. These findings open the way for further
investigations of the extent to which these differences contribute to the substance use, or are caused
by it. In any case, we note that there may be many factors that influence smoking and drinking,
though we have revealed some of the possible underlying factors and brain mechanisms in this
investigation.
Materials and methods
Participants and data preprocessing
The dataset used for this investigation was selected from the November 2015 public data release
from the Human Connectome Project (HCP, N = 900), WU-Minn Consortium. Our sample includes
831 subjects (ages 22–35 years, 463 females) scanned on a 3 T Siemens connectome-Skyra scanner.
The HCP consortium is a public shared large-scale neuroimaging dataset which aims to map macro-
scopic human brain circuits and their relationship to behavior in a large population of healthy adults
(Van Essen et al., 2012; Van Essen et al., 2013) and which has been widely used in neuroimaging
studies (Finn et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2015; Glasser et al., 2016). The sibships with individual hav-
ing severe neurodevelopmental disorders, neuropsychiatric disorders or neurologic disorders were
excluded, but individuals who are smokers, are overweight, or have a history of heavy drinking or
recreational drug use without having experienced severe symptoms were included in HCP consor-
tium. The details on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of HCP consortium were provided in the pre-
vious studies (Van Essen et al., 2012; Van Essen et al., 2013) and the HCP website (https://www.
humanconnectome.org/). It should be noted that the HCP dataset was not specifically designed for
the study of substance use, but it is useful for investigating the impact of alcohol and cigarette use
in a community sample. Two resting state fMRI acquisitions on different days were used. The four
resting-state runs of approximately 15 min each were acquired in separate sessions on two different
days, with eyes open with relaxed fixation on a projected bright cross-hair on a dark background.

 The WU-Minn HCP Consortium obtained full informed consent from all participants, and research
procedures and ethical guidelines were followed in accordance with the Washington University Insti-
tutional Review Boards (IRB #201204036; Title: ‘Mapping the Human Connectome: Structure, Func-
tion, and Heritability’). The demographic characteristics of participants are summarized in Table 2.
More details of subjects are provided in the Supplementary Material and the collection and prepro-
cessing of the data are provided at the HCP website (http://www.humanconnectome.org/).
We obtained minimally preprocessed R-fMRI data conducted using the HCP Functional Pipeline
v2.0 (Glasser et al., 2013) involving gradient distortion correction, head motion correction, image
distortion correction and spatial transformation to the 2 � 2 � 2 mm3 Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI) space using one step spline resampling from the original functional images followed by then
intensity normalization (Glasser et al., 2013). In this study, these minimally preprocessed images
were further analyzed using FSL (Jenkinson et al., 2012) and AFNI (Cox, 1996). Briefly, first the con-
stant, linear and quadratic trend were removed from these functional images. Next, several nuisance
signals were regressed from the time course of each voxel using multiple linear regression, including
cerebrospinal fluid signal, white matter signal, and Friston’s 24 head motion parameters. Then, tem-
poral band-pass filtering (0.01-0.1 Hz) was performed to reduce the influence of low-frequency drift
and the high-frequency physiological noise. Finally, 3D spatial smoothing is applied to each volume
of the fMRI data using a Gaussian kernel with Full-width at Half Maximum (FWHM) equaling to 4
mm. The first 50 volumes were discarded to suppress equilibration effects and participants without
the full 1200 time points in four resting-state runs were also removed from the following analysis.
Any data affected by head motion (mean framewise displacement larger than 0.3 mm) were
excluded using the protocol of Power et al. (2014). The resulting time courses were used for the
construction and analysis of the brain network. We also compared the findings based on the pipeline
described above and elsewhere (Cheng et al., 2016) with alternative pipelines for data preprocess-
ing including the HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline, and our pipeline but with global signal
removal. More details on the effect of the preprocessing pipelines are shown in the Supplementary
Material (Figure 1—figure supplements 1).
Construction of the whole-brain functional network
After preprocessing, the whole brain (gray matter) was parcellated into 94 regions of interest (ROI)
according to the automated anatomical labeling (AAL2 ) atlas (Rolls et al., 2015) (47 regions in each
hemisphere), and the time series were extracted in each ROI by averaging the signals of all voxels
within that region. The names of the ROIs and their corresponding abbreviations are listed in
Supplementary file 1. (This is a standard parcellation scheme, which provides a usable number of
different divisions for statistical purposes when differences between regions are being investigated,
and includes a useful parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex.). For comparison, we also provide the
results (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) based on another atlas (Shen et al., 2013) which has also
been validated in resting state fMRI studies (Finn et al., 2015; Rosenberg et al., 2016), although its
parcellation of the orbitofrontal cortex is less good than the AAL2 atlas. The Pearson cross-correla-
tions between all pairs of regional BOLD signals were calculated for each subject followed by
z-transformation to improve normality, and the whole-brain functional connectivity network (94 � 94
region-based network with 4371 links) was constructed. Finally, the mean functional connectivity
across two scans (each scan containing left to right and right to left phase encoding directions) was
used for the following analysis to provide a more reliable estimation of functional connectivity. The
correlation of the functional connectivities was high between the two different scans as shown in the
Supplementary Material (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).
Categorization of participants into groups
The following factors were considered in choosing the measures to define the groups. The main pur-
pose of the current study was to investigate whether there were differences in functional connectivity
that were related to smoking or drinking. Accordingly, in the initial analysis, we categorized the par-
ticipants for the smoking analysis into two groups, one which used significant amounts of cigarettes,
and the other using no or low amounts of cigarettes. The same was performed for the division into
two groups with respect to the amount of alcohol drunk. In making the cutoff, we ensured that there
were reasonable numbers of participants in the high and the low amount groups. After the initial

 analysis, we wished to investigate the effect of the different amounts of use of cigarettes or alcohol,
and therefore used measures of the different amounts of drinking of each participant, and the num-
ber of times each participant had smoked, as described in the results section (Figures 5 and 6).
Accordingly, to investigate smoking-associated functional connectivity, we divided all participants
into three groups according to their smoking history (SSAGA_TB_Smoking_History), that is non-
smokers (417 participants), occasional smokers (161 participants) and regular smokers (203 partici-
pants). The non-smoker group contained participants who had never smoked during their lifetime.
The occasional smoker group contained participants who experimented with cigarettes at least once
in their lifetime but never became a regular smoker. The regular smoker group included those who
smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime and smoked at least one day per week when
they were smoking regularly. (A score of 3 indicates a regular smoker; of 1 and 2 indicates an occa-
sional smoker, and 0 a non-smoker.) In the main analyses described in this paper to investigate
whether there was an effect of smoking, two of these groups were used, the non-smoker and regular
smoker groups. The third group was helpful in further analyses to investigate effects of the amount
of smoking (Figure 5).
To investigate drinking-associated functional connectivities, we divided all participants into two
groups. A Low Amount (LA) group with 311 participants drank one or fewer drinks per drinking day
in the past 12 months. A High Amount (HA) group with 470 participants drank two or more drinks
per drinking day in the past 12 months. (The descriptor was SSAGA_Alc_12_Drinks_Per_Day, and
this division into two groups was made to help comparison with the initial analysis for smokers, which
also used two groups.) It should be noted that the ‘amount’ of drinking in the current study refers to
the amount of drinks per drinking day (and not for example to the total number of drinks in the past
12 months). The rationale for the use of this measure is provided in the Discussion section, and a
complementary analysis showed that there was a good correlation between the association pattern
of the functional connectivities when the measures were the ’total drinks’ and the ’drinks per drink-
ing day’ (r = 0.72, p<1 � 10�10). In order to compare the results for smoking and drinking, only par-
ticipants with information
about both drinking and smoking behavior were included. The
demographic characteristics of the participants in each group are summarized in Table 2.
Statistical analysis
In order to investigate the relationship between functional connectivity (FC) and smoking, two sam-
ple two-tailed t tests were used to test whether smoking was associated with functional connectivity
after removing the confounding effects of age, gender, years of education, race, handedness, head
motion (mean framewise displacement, FD), BMI, blood pressure (diastolic and systolic), total gray
matter volume, total white matter volume, drinking, and marijuana use. Considering the purpose of
this study described above and the sample size in each sub-group, we used a two sample t-test
rather than a 2 � 2 ANOVA. Then a Storey’s FDR procedure was used to correct for multiple com-
parisons (Storey, 2002; Storey and Tibshirani, 2003; Erlikhman and Caplovitz, 2017). Storey’s
FDR is a modification of FDR, also called positive False Discovery Rate (pFDR) by conditioning on

 one false positive finding having occurred. The Storey’s FDR method was implemented by the Mat-
lab function mafdr.m with default parameters. In the present study FDR correction for the functional
connectivity between any pair of AAL2 regions was used, and the results for smoking are presented
based on this statistical test with FDR p<0.005. We then performed the same statistical analysis on
the high drinking and low drinking groups with the FDR correction at p<0.05. The effects of any use
of the other substance was always removed by regression when we performed the analysis on the
use of one of the substances. For the effect of the most recent drink/cigarette use, a correlation
analysis confirmed that the association pattern was highly consistent in the cases with and without
the covariates of the total drinks and total times smoked in the past 7 days (r = 0.957 for smoking
and r = 0.927 for drinking). This provides evidence that it is whether one is a smoker or drinker that
is relevant to the results described in this paper, and not just the most recent drug use.
Correlation of functional connectivity differences for substances with
extent of use and a measure of impulsivity
We explored the relationship between the functional connectivity links identified above as different
in substance use groups with behavioral measures (i.e. drinks per drinking day in the past 12 months
and the amount of smoking). Specifically, a partial correlation analysis was used to measure the cor-
relation between the identified functional connectivity and these behavioral measures with removal
of the confounding variables of age, gender, years of education, race, handedness, head motion
(mean FD), BMI, blood pressure (diastolic and systolic), total gray matter volume, total white matter
volume and use of the other substance.
We also investigated the relationship between the functional connectivity links identified above
as different in substance use groups and behavioral scores related to self-regulation and impulsivity.
We performed a partial correlation of the delay discounting score with the amount of drinking per
drinking day and the amount of smoking respectively. The score of self-regulation and impulsivity
was based on the delay discounting task which measures the undervaluing of rewards delayed in
time. We used an area-under-the-curve discounting measure (AUC) that provides a valid and reliable
index of how steeply an individual discounts delayed rewards (Myerson et al., 2001). Specifically,
we calculated the canonical correlation between the area under the curve for discounting of $200
and $40,000 (DDisc_AUC_200 and DDisc_AUC_40K) with the strength of associated functional con-
nectivities for drinking and smoking respectively, after removing the effects of age, gender, years of
education, race, handedness, head motion (mean FD), BMI, blood pressure (diastolic and systolic)
total gray matter volume, total white matter volume and use of the other two substances.
Cross-validation with the IMAGEN dataset
We used another separate large longitudinal fMRI dataset (the IMAGEN dataset (Schumann et al.,
2010)) which included 1176 participants to test whether the findings based on the HCP dataset
could be cross-validated with an independent dataset, which would considerably strengthen the
findings. This dataset also enabled examination of whether functional connectivity at age 14 when
participants neither smoke nor drank was associated with who would become drinkers or smokers at
age 19. This potentially thus provides a way to investigate whether differences between individuals
that were not caused by smoking and drinking (as there was little smoking and drinking when the
participants were 14) might lead to smoking or drinking by the time that the participants were 19.
The IMAGEN dataset also enabled investigation of gender differences in the behaviors that may be
predictable from brain functional connectivity in this important period of development. The details
of demographic characteristics of participants from the IMAGEN dataset are presented in
Supplementary file 2.
Participants
IMAGEN adopted a longitudinal design to collect genetic, neuroimaging, environmental, and behav-
ioural data in the UK and Europe, starting at age 14 years old with a sample 2087 healthy adoles-
cents, and followed at ages 16 and 19 years. The neuroimaging data were acquired at ages 14 and
19 years (Schumann et al., 2010). The demographic characteristics of participants who included
resting state fMRI scans are summarized in Supplementary file 2.

 IMAGEN 19: For the dataset at age 19, by using a similar criterion to define the sub-groups as in
the HCP database, a Low Amount (LA) drinking group with 378 participants who drank two or fewer
drinks per drinking day, and a High Amount (HA) drinking group with 566 participants who drank
three or more drinks per drinking day, were identified.
The small difference in the different definitions for the drinking groups for the HCP and IMAGEN
samples is because they used different questionnaires. We used the European School Survey Project
on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) to assess the lifetime drinking and smoking in the IMAGEN
dataset. The measure of drinking in the IMAGEN dataset is as follows:
“How many drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when you are drinking?
1: 1 or 2
2: 3 or 4
3: 5 or 6
4: 7 to 9
5: 10 or more’
For comparison, the measure of drinking in the HCP dataset is:
‘Drinks consumed per drinking day in past 12 months: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5–6 = 5, 7+ = 6.’
In fact, the control group for the HCP and IMAGEN datasets were similar, in that they had not
drunk alcohol.
For the smoking dataset, a smoking group (regular smoker) was defined as those who smoked at
least 100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime and smoked at least one day per week when they were
smoking regularly (180 participants), and a non-smoking group (who had never smoked, 295
participants).
IMAGEN 14: Since almost all participants did not take any cigarettes and alcohol at age 14, it
was not suitable to assess the difference between smoking and non-smoking group (or low drinking
and high drinking group). However, this longitudinal data enabled us to investigate possible causal
associations between substance use behaviors and functional connectivities. Therefore, for the data-
set at age 14, to investigate possible causal associations between drinking and functional connectivi-
ties, we focused only on the subjects who drank two or fewer drinks per drinking day. (This was the
great majority of participants.) We also divided all participants into two groups according to their
drinking behavior at age 14 and 19. Specifically, a Future Low Amount (FLA) group with 86 partici-
pants drank with two or fewer drinks per drinking day at both age 14 and 19. A Future High Amount
(FHA) group with 91 participants drank with three or more drinks per drinking day at age 19. It
should be noted that both of these groups drank two or fewer drinks per drinking day at age 14.
Similarly to the above, for the analysis of smoking, we still focused on the participants who never
smoked cigarettes at age 14: specifically, on a future non-smoking group with 56 participants who
never smoked at both age 14 and 19; and a future regular smoking group with 19 participants who
experienced smoking at age 19.
Then a two sample two-tailed t-test was used to assess the difference between the (F)LA group
and (F)HA group and the smoking and non-smoking groups in the datasets at both the ages of 14
and 19 after removing the effect of gender, BMI, head motion (mean FD) and the use of the another
substances use.
We also investigate the impulsivity of participants at age 14 by using the IMAGEN dataset. The
impulsivity measure is based on the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (Woicik et al., 2009) by using
the sum of the following question scores:
1. I often don’t think things through before I speak.
2. I often involve myself in situations that I later regret being involved in.
3. I usually act without stopping to think.
4. Generally, I am an impulsive person.
5. I feel I have to be manipulative to get what I want.
Drinking and smoking behavior
We used the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) at ages 14 and
19 years to assess life time drinking and smoking. The primary question of interest was regarding
lifetime alcohol and cigarette use and the questionnaire were as follows (Schumann et al., 2010):
1. On how many occasions during your lifetime have you smoked cigarettes?

Imaging data preprocessing for the IMAGEN dataset
Data preprocessing was performed using DPARSF (Chao-Gan and Yu-Feng, 2010) (http:// restfmri.
net) which is a toolbox based on the SPM8 software package. The first 10 EPI scans were discarded
to suppress equilibration effects. The remaining scans of each subject underwent slice timing correc-
tion by sinc interpolating volume slices, motion correction for volume to volume displacement, spa-
tial
normalization
to
standard

(MNI)
space
using
affine
transformation and nonlinear deformation with a voxel size of 3 � 3 � 3mm3, followed by spatial
smoothing (6 mm Full Width Half Maximum FWHM). To remove the sources of spurious correlations
present in resting-state BOLD data, all fMRI time-series underwent band-pass temporal filtering
(0.01-0.1 Hz), nuisance signal removal from the ventricles, and deep white matter, and regressing
out any effects of head motion using Friston’s 24 head motion parameters procedure. Finally, sub-
jects with the mean framewise displacement (FD) of head motion large than 0.3 were completely
excluded from the analysis as it is likely that such high-level of movement would have had an influ-
ence on several volumes (Power et al., 2014).
Methodological notes
Effect of the pipeline of data preprocessing
A comparison between different pipelines of data preprocessing was performed, as follows.
1)The complete HCP pipeline.
Data pre-processing was carried out using FSL (FMRIB Software Library), FreeSurfer, and the Con-
nectome Workbench software. All the data preprocessing procedures were performed by the human
connectome project (HCP) as described in (Glasser et al., 2013). Briefly, the data preprocessing

 included correction for spatial and gradient distortions and head motion, intensity normalization and
bias field removal, registration to the T1 weighted structural image, transformation to 2 mm Mon-
treal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and the FIX artefact removal procedure (Smith et al., 2013;
Navarro Schro
¨der et al., 2015).
2)The HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline + other standard preprocessing procedures but with-
out global signal removal.
The HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline was used for the HCP data set. This pipeline includes
artifact removal, motion correction and registration to standard space. Then standard preprocessing
procedures were applied to the fMRI data: first the linear trend and quadratic term were removed
from these functional images; several nuisance signals were regressed from the time course of each
voxel using multiple linear regression, including cerebrospinal fluid, white matter and head motion
parameters; finally, temporal band-pass filtering (0.09–0.1 Hz) was performed to reduce the influ-
ence of low-frequency drift and the high-frequency physiological noise. This pipeline has been widely
used in previous studies based on the HCP dataset (Zalesky et al., 2014; Schultz and Cole, 2016)
and our paper also focuses on the results based on this pipeline.
3)The HCP minimal preprocessing pipeline + other standard preprocessing procedures and with
global signal removal.
Same as pipeline two but with the global signal removal.
