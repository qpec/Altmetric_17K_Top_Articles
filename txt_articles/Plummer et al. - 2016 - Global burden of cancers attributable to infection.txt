Global burden of cancers attributable to infections in 2012: 
a synthetic analysis
Martyn Plummer*, Catherine de Martel*, Jerome Vignat, Jacques Ferlay, Freddie Bray, Silvia Franceschi
Summary
Background Infections with certain viruses, bacteria, and parasites are strong risk factors for specifi
 c cancers. As new 
cancer statistics and epidemiological fi
 ndings have accumulated in the past 5 years, we aimed to assess the causal 
involvement of the main carcinogenic agents in diff
 erent cancer types for the year 2012.
Methods We considered ten infectious agents classifi
 ed as carcinogenic to human beings by the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer. We calculated the number of new cancer cases in 2012 attributable to infections by country, 
by combining cancer incidence estimates (from GLOBOCAN 2012) with estimates of attributable fraction (AF) for the 
infectious agents. AF estimates were calculated from the prevalence of infection in cancer cases and the relative risk 
for the infection (for some sites). Estimates of infection prevalence, relative risk, and corresponding 95% CIs for AF 
were obtained from systematic reviews and pooled analyses.
Findings Of 14 million new cancer cases in 2012, 2·2 million (15·4%) were attributable to carcinogenic infections. The 
most important infectious agents worldwide were Helicobacter pylori (770 000 cases), human papillomavirus (640 000), 
hepatitis B virus (420 000), hepatitis C virus (170 000), and Epstein-Barr virus (120 000). Kaposi’s sarcoma was the 
second largest contributor to the cancer burden in sub-Saharan Africa. The AFs for infection varied by country and 
development status—from less than 5% in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and some countries in western 
and northern Europe to more than 50% in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
Interpretation A large potential exists for reducing the burden of cancer caused by infections. Socioeconomic 
development is associated with a decrease in infection-associated cancers; however, to reduce the incidence of these 
cancers without delay, population-based vaccination and screen-and-treat programmes should be made accessible 
and available.

Introduction
Carcinogenic infections are an important cause of cancer, 
particularly 
in 
less 
developed 
countries. 
Their 
contribution to the global burden of cancer has been 
periodically assessed in a series of publications for 1990, 
2002, and 2008.1–3 In 2008, 16·1% of all cancers worldwide 
were estimated to be attributable to infections, with 
substantial variation between geographical regions from 
3·3% in Australia to 32·7% in sub-Saharan Africa.1 Here, 
we update these statistics for the year 2012 using 
estimates of global cancer incidence from GLOBOCAN 
20124 and new estimates of population attributable 
fractions, hereafter referred to as attributable fractions 
(AFs), for infectious agents derived from a review of 
reports published in the past 20 years.
Methods
Infectious agents
11 infectious agents have been classifi
 ed as well established 
(group 1) carcinogenic agents in human beings by the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC): 
Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C 
virus (HCV), HIV type 1 (HIV-1), human papillomavirus 
(HPV; types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 
59—known collectively as high-risk types), Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV), human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8; also 
known as Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus), human T-cell 
lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Opisthorchis viverrini, 
Clonorchis sinensis, and Schistosoma haematobium.5 Among 
these agents, HIV is unique in attributable risk 
calculations because, at the best of current knowledge, 
HIV has been shown to increase cancer risk only in 
combination with other carcinogenic infectious agents;5 
therefore, we chose to attribute cancers in HIV-positive 
people to the co-infection. In 2015, we estimated that in 
the combined antiretroviral therapy era, 40% of cancers 
occurring in HIV-positive people in the USA are 
attributable to infections.6 However, essential information 
on the number of HIV-infected individuals and cancer 
incidence among them is lacking in most countries. 
Consistent with our previous report,1 we could not 
accurately estimate the contribution of HIV to the fraction 
of infection-attributable cancers.
Therefore, we considered the ten infectious agents other 
than HIV and the associated cancer types (table 1). A few 
cancer types or subtypes were added to those established

by an expert working group convened by the IARC.5 In 
high-risk areas for H pylori infection and gastric cancer in 
east Asia, evidence shows that a subset of cancers of the 
gastric cardia arise from severe atrophic gastritis due to 
H pylori along a pathway similar to that of non-cardia 
gastric cancer.7 Additionally, recent case series8,9 that used 
detection of viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 (ie, PCR with E6 
or E7 mRNA, the gold standard for detecting the presence 
of actively transcribing virus in cancer tissues) now allow 
the attribution of a small proportion of cancers of the oral 
cavity and larynx to HPV. Other methodological changes 
from the previous reports included updating of the fraction 
of non-cardia gastric cancer attributable to H pylori using 
data from immunoblot, a more sensitive method than 
ELISA in the detection of H pylori infection.10 We also used 
data from a meta-analysis of the worldwide distribution of 
HBV and HCV in hepatocellular carcinoma11 to obtain 
improved and separate estimates of liver cancer attributable 
to the two viruses. 
Geographical areas
Using data from GLOBOCAN 2012,4 we estimated the 
number of new cancer cases due to infections by country 
and then aggregated these estimates into eight 
geographical regions based on the UN classifi
 cation: sub-
Saharan Africa, north Africa and west Asia, central Asia, 
east Asia, Latin America, North America, Europe, and 
Oceania.1 We also aggregated results by the 2012 Human 
Development Index (HDI),12 a composite indicator of life 
expectancy, education, and gross domestic product per 
person. 187 countries were divided by quartiles of HDI 
distribution into four groups, each with an equal number 
of countries (although with substantially diff
 erent 
population sizes) and labelled as low, medium, high, and 
very high HDI.12 We also created a dichotomous HDI 
classifi
 cation by combining countries with low and 
medium HDI into less developed countries, and 
countries with high and very high HDI into more 
developed countries. In some instances, China was 
shown separately from other medium-HDI countries 
because of the large size of its population and cancer 
burden (accounting for 3·1 million [60%] of the 
5·2 million cancer cases in medium-HDI countries)4 and 
because changes in HDI methodology have classifi
 ed 
China as a high-HDI country since 2014.13 
Statistical analysis
The AF for carcinogenic infections is the proportion of 
new cancer cases that would have been prevented in a 
population if all infections had been avoided or 
successfully treated before they caused cancer. Briefl
 y, for 
HPV in cervical cancer, HTLV-1 in adult T-cell leukaemia 
and lymphoma, and HHV-8 in Kaposi’s sarcoma, 100% of 
cancers are attributed to the infection (table 1; see appendix 
for detailed methods).5 For HPV at other cancer sites and 
EBV-related cancers, the prevalence of viral transcripts in 
tumour cells in cases from case series and case-control 
studies was used to estimate the AF. For H pylori, HBV, 
and HCV, AF estimates were based on the prevalence in 
cases adjusted by the relative risk as previously described.1 
For rare cancers caused by parasites in endemic areas, 
specifi
 c methods were used as before,1 because of the 
dearth of available data (appendix).
We derived 95% CIs for the AF estimates from random-
eff
 ects meta-analysis of infection prevalence in case series 
(HPV and EBV). When the AF also depended on relative 
risk estimates (ie, for H pylori, HBV, and HCV), the 
95% CI accounted for the uncertainty in both prevalence 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Evidence on the association between infection and cancer was 
comprehensively reviewed by an expert working group of the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2009. On 
the basis of these expert reviews, we published estimates of the 
global burden of cancer due to infection for the year 2008. To 
estimate the strength of the associations between specifi
 c 
infection and cancer types in terms of population attributable 
fraction, we used published meta-analyses where possible and did 
our own systematic reviews when necessary. Since then, new 
cancer incidence estimates have become available from 
GLOBOCAN for the year 2012 and from many new epidemiological 
studies, including better evidence on the involvement of human 
papillomavirus in cancers of the head and neck and Helicobacter 
pylori in gastric cancer, notably gastric cardia cancer.
Added value of this study
In this study, we synthesised the available data to present an 
updated picture of cancer and infection burden worldwide, 
improving on the previous report by using the most recent 
data and giving more details of individual country estimates 
and analysis by level of socioeconomic development. The 
fraction of all cancers attributable to infection varies greatly 
between countries, with an important negative association 
between population attributable fraction and level of 
socioeconomic development. Despite this association, some 
highly developed countries continue to show a large burden of 
infection-attributable cancer because of the long interval 
between infection acquisition and cancer development.
Implications of all the available evidence
The global burden of infection-attributable cancer is mainly on 
less developed countries. To reduce this burden, vaccination or 
screening programmes used in more developed countries 
should become more widely available.

Results
Of the estimated 14 million new cancer cases worldwide 
in 2012, 2·2 million (15·4%) were attributable to infection 
(table 2). AFs varied by region from 4·0% in North 
America to 31·3% in sub-Saharan Africa. AF was highest 
in low-HDI countries and medium-HDI countries, and 
lowest in countries with very high HDI (table 2). Two-
thirds of infection-attributable cancers (1·4 million cases) 
occurred in less developed countries (table 2).
In 2012, the AFs of infection-related cancers were less 
than 5% in the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, 
and some countries in northern and western Europe, but 
more than 40% in several countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa and in Mongolia (fi
 gure 1). The AF by country 
ranged from 3·6% in Sweden to more than 50% in 
Malawi and Mozambique (appendix pp 22–26). 
H pylori, HPV, HBV, and HCV were together 
responsible for 2·0 million new cancer cases worldwide 
in 2012 (table 3), with H pylori being the largest 
contributor. The high burden of HPV-attributable cancer 
(predominantly cervical cancer) in women almost exactly 
counterbalanced the excess in men for all other infections, 
so that overall the numbers of cancers attributable to all 
infections were similar for both sexes (1·1 million each; 
table 3). According to GLOBOCAN 2012,4 64% of all 
cancers occur before age 70 years (which is the same age 
limit that has been used by WHO since 201015 to defi
 ne 
premature death from non-communicable diseases), but 
the corresponding proportion of such cancers was 
considerably higher for cancers caused by HPV (86%), 
EBV (88%), and HHV-8 (90%) than for other cancers, 
such as those caused by H pylori (57%; table 3).
The burden of cancers attributable to infections was 
dominated by cancers of the stomach, liver, and cervix

(table 4)—ie, the fi
 fth, sixth, and seventh most common 
cancers worldwide, respectively, after lung, breast, 
colorectal, and prostate cancers.4 These cancer types also 
had very high infection-related AFs: 89·0% of non-cardia 
gastric cancer was attributable to H pylori, 73·4% of liver 
cancer was attributable to HBV and HCV (a small 
number of intrahepatic bile duct cancers caused by liver 
fl
 ukes were also included), and 100·0% of cervical cancer 
was caused by HPV. The global burden of HPV-
attributable 
cancer 
other 
than 
cervical 
cancer 
(113 000 cases) was substantially lower than that of 
cervical cancer (530 000 cases).
Figure 2 shows the total number of cancer cases by 
cause, the burden of cancer attributable to infection by 
HDI (AF), and the proportion of cases attributable to 
each infectious agent. Low-HDI countries were the only 
category that had a high proportion of HHV-8-related 
cancers (14%, compared with 2% worldwide). Apart from 
the burden of HHV-8-related cancers, low-HDI and 
medium-HDI countries (excluding China) had a similar 
range of infection-attributable cancers. China had a 
unique pattern of such cancers, with a low proportion of 
HPV-attributable cancers and a high proportion of 
cancers caused by HBV and H pylori. H pylori also had an 
important contribution to the cancer burden in countries 
with high and very high HDIs. Whereas HBV 
predominates over HCV as a cause of liver cancer in low-
HDI and medium-HDI countries, HBV and HCV have 
similar contributions to the cancer burden in high-HDI 
countries, and HCV predominates in countries with very 
high HDI. 
In both less developed and more developed countries, 
the AFs were generally higher in younger age groups, 
peaking in people aged 40–45 years, except for women in 
more developed countries where the peak was in people 
younger than 40 years (fi
 gure 3).

Discussion
In 2012, around 15% of cancer cases worldwide were 
attributable to infectious agents. Two-thirds of infection-
attributable cancers occurred in less developed countries, 
in which infections accounted for nearly one in four 
cancers. The main infectious agents contributing to the 
cancer burden were H pylori, HPV, HBV, and HCV, 
which together accounted for 92% of all infection-
attributable cancers worldwide.
H pylori was the most important infectious cause of 
cancer in countries with high and very high HDIs. Of note, 
the very high incidence of stomach cancers in Japan and 
Korea is accompanied by an unusually good prognosis, 
because of the intensive search for gastric lesions through 
national endoscopic screening programmes.16
The ratio of liver cancers attributable to HBV and HCV 
varied substantially with HDI. Although HBV was more 
important than HCV as a cause of cancer in low-HDI 
and medium-HDI countries, the opposite was true in 
countries with high and very high HDIs because of the 
especially early spread of HCV in some countries with 
very high HDI (eg, in 1930s in Japan) and the 
diminishing prevalence of HBV with increasing HDI 
(fi
 gure 2). Of note, the prevalence of HCV in the general 
population varied greatly between countries because of 
diff
 erences in the presence and timing of mass episodes 
of 
iatrogenic 
transmission 
and, 
more 
recently, 
intravenous drug use.11,17
HPV caused more than half of all infection-attributable 
cancers in women worldwide. In low-HDI countries, it 
accounted for half of infection-attributable cancers in 
both sexes combined. Elevated rates of cervical cancer 
resulted from poor screening and treatment of 
precancerous cervical lesions, in combination with high 
prevalence of HPV and HIV infections.18
HHV-8 accounted for only 2% of infection-attributable 
cancers worldwide, but in low-HDI countries this 
proportion was 14%. Kaposi’s sarcoma mainly aff
 ects 
individuals younger than 50 years and continues to be a 
major public health concern in Africa, where HHV-8 is 
endemic and large numbers of HIV-infected individuals 
have late or no access to combined antiretroviral therapy.19
This Article is part of a periodic series of publications 
assessing the burden of cancer due to infection.1–3,6 
Worldwide, the AF for 2012 (15%) is similar to previous 
estimates for 2008 (16%),1 2002 (18%),2 and 1990 (16%).3 
However, these estimates are not directly comparable. Each 
publication in this series represents a snapshot of the state 
of knowledge at the time of publication, and the cancer data 
sources and methods have both evolved with time.
Major improvements over the previous report for 2008 
include AF estimates for individual countries, the re-
assessment of the AFs of some major infections, and the 
addition of confi
 dence intervals. We were able to separate 
data for liver cancers attributable to HBV and HCV on the 
basis of results from a systematic review in 2015.11 Other 
reviews in the past 5 years have allowed more accurate 
estimates of AFs using, for instance, prospective studies 
of H pylori and non-cardia gastric cancer10 and updated 
meta-analyses of Epstein-Barr virus infection prevalence 
in Hodgkin’s lymphoma.20 For HPV in cancers of the head 
and neck, multinational case series8,9 have added valuable 
additional evidence of causality (appendix pp 5–6, 13–15).
An important improvement is the calculation of 
country-level and HDI-level estimates of the burden 
of cancer attributable to infection. The distinct patterns 
of cancer incidence by HDI were previously analysed by 
Bray and colleagues,21 who noted that rapid societal and 
socioeconomic transition in many countries means that 
any reductions in infection-related cancers are off
 set by 
an increasing number of new cases that are more 
associated with reproductive, dietary, and hormonal

factors. AFs of cancers caused by infection were low in 
countries with very high HDIs, but exceptions exist, 
mainly because of a large burden of gastric and liver 
cancer in, for example, Japan and Korea (AFs around 
20% in both countries). Other countries with very high 
HDIs, notably those in Latin America and the Middle 
East, had AFs of more than 10% (appendix pp 22–26). 
These examples show that a substantial delay might exist 
between socioeconomic development and reduction in 
the proportion of infection-attributable cancers.
The main limitations of our study are associated with the 
scarcity of representative data for infection prevalence and 
of high-quality cancer registration in many populations, as 
well as the diffi
  culty in characterising the full degree of 
uncertainty of our estimates. The 95% CIs for AF estimates 
in table 1 represent the substantial strength of the 
association of individual infections with specifi
 c cancer 
types from meta-analyses or pooled data, but associations 
with other less well studied cancer types or subtypes 
remain less clear. For example, non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
cases were considered together as attributable to HCV, 
although the association might vary with histological 
subtypes. Furthermore, few data exist for EBV presence by 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype in immunocompetent 
populations, even though 5–10% of all non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma cases might be attributable to EBV (appendix 
p 7). Another possible example of underestimation of the 
AFs is those for H pylori and gastric cardia cancer outside 
east Asia, the only region where relevant data were 
available. Most importantly, the numbers of cases 
attributable to infection were derived from incidence 
estimates from GLOBOCAN 2012,4 which does not give a 
quantitative assessment of uncertainty. For individual 
countries, however, the alphanumeric quality score from 
GLOBOCAN—which describes the quality and coverage 
of incidence data (A–G) and the accuracy of the methods 
used to estimate incidence (1–9; appendix p 26)—provides 
a useful qualitative assessment of the uncertainty of the 
incidence estimates. Countries with the highest score (A1) 
should generally have accurate incidence estimates, 
whereas estimates for countries with the lowest score (G9) 
represent a best guess in the complete absence of country-
specifi
 c data. Special caution should be used for countries 
that showed very high AFs for infection, as this fi
 nding 
might be due to incomplete registration of cancers that are 
not associated with infections.22
Our fi
 ndings suggest that the potential for reducing the 
burden of cancer is large. However, the proportion of 
preventable cancers might be considerably lower than 
the AF and will depend on the resources available for the 
implementation of large-scale interventions. It is 
encouraging that highly eff
 ective prophylactic vaccines 
(against HBV and HPV) and screen-and-treat strategies 
(for HPV and HCV) exist and are being implemented in 
some countries.18,23
As of 2014, 184 countries had incorporated the HBV 
vaccine as an integral part of their national infant 
immunisation programmes.24 Vaccination has been 
shown to prevent liver cancer in children and young 
adults in Taiwan since it was introduced in 1984.25 The 
timely delivery of a vaccine dose within 24 h of birth has 
become a performance measure for HBV immunisation 
programmes.26 A birth dose had been introduced in 
96 countries by 2014, and the global coverage was 
estimated at 38%, reaching 80% in the western Pacifi
 c, 
but only 10% in Africa.24
In the past 10 years, most countries in Europe and the 
Americas, as well as Australia, have introduced national 
HPV vaccination programmes targeting adolescent girls, 
but coverage varies vastly from less than 30% to more than 
80%.27 Large eff
 orts are necessary to improve coverage and 
bring HPV vaccination to less developed countries in sub-
Saharan Africa and Asia. Vaccination programmes with a 
coverage of at least 80% have been shown to be achievable 
in less developed countries such as Rwanda and Bhutan. 
Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, is bringing relatively low-cost 
HPV vaccines to dozens of additional countries with few 
fi
 nancial resources.27 The screening of women older than 
30 years, possibly with aff
 ordable rapid HPV tests, has also 
been endorsed by WHO.28
A national HCV screen-and-treat programme of 
individuals born between 1945 and 1965 has been 
launched in the USA, taking advantage of highly eff
 ective 
but still very expensive new antiviral treatments.23 A 
global reduction in liver cancer caused by HCV and HBV 
will depend on the identifi
 cation and appropriate referral 
of individuals at risk, and on the widespread delivery and 
aff
 ordability of these new treatments in diff
 erent 
countries.29 
Early initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy is 
associated with massive reductions in the risk of 
developing Kaposi’s sarcoma.30 The 2015 WHO clinical 
guidelines31 recommend the initiation of combined anti-
retroviral therapy in all HIV-positive individuals

regardless of clinical stage or CD4-positive cell count. 
This strategy has the potential to prevent most cases of 
Kaposi’s sarcoma and possibly a fraction of HPV-
associated cancer in sub-Saharan Africa.32
Last but not least, our results highlight the continuing 
importance of H pylori as an infectious cause of cancer in 
many world regions, including some more developed 
countries. Anti-H pylori therapy has been overlooked as a 
strategy for cancer prevention because of concerns about 
the widespread use of antibiotics and the possibility that 
H pylori eradication might increase the risk of oesophageal 
cancer.7 Nevertheless, an IARC working group has 
recommended that countries explore the possibility of 
introducing population-based H pylori screening and 
treatment programmes for gastric cancer control.33
In conclusion, carcinogenic infections remain an 
important cause of cancer worldwide, especially in less 
developed countries. For several of the infections we 
assessed, with the exception of sexually transmitted 
HPV,18 socioeconomic development is associated with a 
reduction in transmission or in progression to cancer. 
However, socioeconomic development is not suffi
  cient to 
reduce the infection-associated cancer burden, unless 
population-based 
interventions 
similar 
to 
those 
implemented in some countries with very high HDIs are 
prioritised and made cost-eff
 ective in the rest of 
the world.
