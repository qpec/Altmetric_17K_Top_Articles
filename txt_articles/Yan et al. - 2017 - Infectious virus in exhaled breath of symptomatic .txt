Abstract 
Little is known about the amount and infectiousness of influenza virus shed into exhaled breath. 
This contributes to uncertainty about the importance of airborne influenza transmission. We 
screened 355 symptomatic volunteers with acute respiratory illness and report 142 cases with 
confirmed influenza infection who provided 218 paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and 30-minute 
breath samples (coarse >5 µm and fine ≤5 µm fractions) on days 1 to 3 post symptom onset. We 
assessed viral RNA copy number for all samples and cultured NP swabs and fine aerosols. We 
recovered infectious virus from 52 (39%) of the fine aerosols and 150 (89%) of the NP swabs 
with valid cultures. The geometric mean RNA copy numbers were 3.8x104/30-min fine, 
1.2x104/30-min coarse aerosol sample, and 8.2x108 per NP swab. Fine and coarse aerosol viral 
RNA was positively associated with body mass index (fine p<0.05, coarse p<0.10) and number 
of coughs (fine p<0.001, coarse p<0.01) and negatively associated with increasing days since 
symptom onset (fine p<0.05 to p<0.01, coarse p<0.10) in adjusted models. Fine aerosol viral 
RNA was also positively associated with having influenza vaccination for both the current and 
prior season (p<0.01). NP swab viral RNA was positively associated with upper respiratory 
symptoms (p<0.01) and negatively associated with age (p<0.01) but was not significantly 
associated with fine or coarse aerosol viral RNA or their predictors. Sneezing was rare, and 
sneezing and coughing were not necessary for infectious aerosol generation. Our observations 
suggest that influenza infection in the upper and lower airways are compartmentalized and 
independent.  
Significance 
Lack of human data on influenza virus aerosol shedding fuels debate over the importance of 
airborne transmission. We provide overwhelming evidence that humans generate infectious 
aerosols and quantitative data to improve mathematical models of transmission and public health 
interventions. We show that sneezing is rare and not important for, and that coughing is not 
required for influenza virus aerosolization. Our findings, that upper and lower airway infection 
are independent and that fine particle exhaled aerosols reflect infection in the lung, open a new 
pathway for understanding the human biology of influenza infection and transmission. Our 
observation of an association between repeated vaccination and increased viral aerosol 
generation demonstrated the power of our method, but needs confirmation.

Introduction  
The nature of infectious contacts and the relative importance of contact, large droplet spray and 
aerosol (droplet nuclei) transmission remain controversial.(1–6) Non-pharmaceutical 
interventions have been employed to control and reduce the impact of influenza epidemics and 
pandemics.(7) However, to design effective non-pharmaceutical interventions, it is necessary to 
accurately define the relative and absolute contribution of each route of transmission(8) and 
implement interventions that impede those of principal importance. 
Mathematical models that have been used to understand and estimate the contribution of each 
mode are very sensitive to estimates of unmeasured parameters,(9, 10) such as the viral load in 
exhaled breath and coughs and the frequency of sneezing by influenza cases.(8) However, due to 
limitations inherent to sampling virus shedding via various routes from infected individuals and 
the difficulty of distinguishing routes of transmission in observational studies, the quantitative 
dynamics and relative contributions of each route remain elusive.(4, 8) Recent reports have 
shown that infectious influenza virus can be recovered from exhaled aerosols.(11–13) These 
studies, based on small numbers of cases or artificial breathing maneuvers, do not provide 
sufficient data to quantify the extent of aerosol shedding during natural breathing, identify the 
contributions of spontaneous coughs and sneezes commonly thought to be the most important 
mechanism for viral shedding, nor identify other factors that may impact viral aerosol shedding. 
We address these key knowledge gaps by characterizing influenza virus in exhaled breath from 
community acquired influenza cases during natural breathing, prompted speech, coughing, and 
sneezing, and assess the infectivity of naturally occurring influenza aerosols.  
Results 
We screened 355 volunteers with acute respiratory illness; the 178 volunteers who met 
enrollment criteria provided 278 visits for sample collection. We confirmed influenza infection 
in 156 (88%) of the enrolled participants using RT-qPCR; 152 had at least one positive NP swab 
and 4 (3%) were confirmed based on positive aerosol samples alone. NP swab analysis was 
positive for 8 (33%) of 24 randomly selected volunteers from among the 177 screened who did 
not meet enrollment criteria; thus, sensitivity and specificity of our enrollment criteria, during the

2012-13 season, were approximately 73% (95% confidence interval (CI) 62 to 84%) and 84% 
(95% CI 80 to 88%), respectively. In the reported analyses, we excluded eight visits made on the 
day of symptom onset, 10 made >3 days after onset, seven with missing data for cough, and three 
with incomplete RT-qPCR data (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S1). The resulting data set for 
confirmed cases with complete data on RNA copies, cough, and symptoms included 218 visits 
by 142 cases: 89 influenza A (83 H3, 3 pdmH1, 3 unsubtypable), 50 influenza B, and 3 dual 
influenza infection cases.  
Our study population (Table 1) consisted mostly of young adults (19-21 years) with a high 
asthma prevalence (21%), normal Body Mass Index (BMI, median=22.7; 7% underweight, 20% 
overweight, and 8% obese, Table S2), and a low self-reported influenza vaccination rate (22%). 
We observed at least one cough during 195 (89%) and one or more sneezes during 11 (5%) of 
the 218 visits. Cough frequency varied considerably from 5 per 30 min. at the 25th centile to 39 
per 30 min at the 75th.  Most volunteers rated their upper respiratory symptoms as mild to 
moderate, systemic symptoms as moderate to severe, and lower respiratory symptoms as mild 
(Fig. 1).   
Infectious virus was recovered from 52 (39%) fine aerosol samples and 150 (89%) NP swabs 
(Table 2). Quantitative cultures were positive for 30% of the fine aerosol samples with a 
geometric mean (GM) for positive samples of 37 fluorescent focus units (FFU) per 30-min 
sample (Fig. 2A) and for 62% of NP swabs with GM for positive samples of 2,500. Using Tobit 
analysis to adjust the estimate of the GM for the presence of samples below the limit of detection 
we obtained GM 1.6 (95% CI 0.7 to 3.5) for fine aerosols and GM 60.6 (95% CI 22.7 to 1.6x102) 
for NP swabs.  
Influenza virus RNA was detected in 76% of the fine aerosol samples, 40% of the coarse aerosol 
samples, and 97% of the NP swabs of enrolled volunteers. For the positive samples, the GM viral 
RNA content of fine aerosol samples was 3.8x104, for coarse aerosols was 1.2x104, and for NP 
swabs was 8.2x108 (Fig. 2B). The adjusted GMs were 1.2x104 (95% CI 7.0x103 to 1.9x104) for 
fine aerosols and 6.0x102 (95% CI 3.0x102 to 1.2x103) for coarse aerosols. Quantitative culture 
was correlated with RNA copies in both NP swabs (Fig. 2C, r=0.58) and fine aerosols (Fig. 2D, 
r=0.34). The time course of shedding is shown in Fig. 2E.

Viral RNA in NP swabs was not correlated with cough frequency (number of coughs per 30 min, 
Fig. 2F and Fig. S2A, r=0.02). Viral RNA in in coarse aerosols was weakly correlated with 
cough frequency (Fig. 2G and Fig. S2B, r=0.24). However, viral RNA copy number in fine 
aerosols was moderately well correlated with cough frequency (Fig. 2H and Fig. S2C, r=0.45). 
Only 3 (13%) of 23 coarse aerosol samples where no coughs were observed had detectable viral 
RNA, while 11 (48%) of the corresponding 23 fine aerosol samples had detectable viral RNA 
and 8 were positive by culture. RNA copies in the fine aerosol, no-cough samples ranged up to 
3.7x105 (adjusted GM 1.5 x103, 95% CI 4.2x102 to 5.3 x103) and infectious virus to 1.4x102 FFU 
per 30-minute sample. The few sneezes observed were not associated with greater RNA copy 
numbers in either coarse or fine aerosols (Fig. S3).   
Results of regression analyses to identify predictors of viral RNA shedding are shown in Table 3, 
controlled for random effects of subject and repeated observations on individuals.  
Day post symptom onset (comparing day 1 post onset with day 2 and day 3) was associated with 
a significant decline in viral RNA shed into fine aerosols (p < 0.05 for day 2 and p < 0.01 for day 
3 in adjusted models), a borderline significant decline in coarse aerosol shedding (p < 0.10) and 
was not associated with a significant change in shedding detected in NP swabs (p > 0.10).  
In regression analyses, cough frequency was significantly associated with increased fine (p < 
0.001 to <0.0001) and coarse (p < 0.01) aerosol shedding, but was not associated with NP 
shedding. Fine aerosol shedding was significantly greater for males. Analysis of an interaction of 
cough with sex indicated that males produced, on average, 3.2 times more virus than did females 
per cough. However, females also coughed significantly (p = 0.005) more frequently than males: 
33 (SD 39) per 30-minute observation and 21 (21) respectively (Fig. S4).  
BMI was positively associated with shedding in fine and coarse aerosols in unadjusted models (p 
< 0.10). BMI was retained in the best fitting adjusted models for both fine and coarse aerosols 
where it was significantly associated with fine aerosol shedding (p < 0.05). However, BMI was 
not associated with shedding detected in NP swabs (p > 0.10). Standard categories of BMI were 
not as good a fit as the continuous BMI and were not significantly associated with shedding 
(Table S3), although a positive trend is evident for overweight and obese individuals in the 
adjusted model.

Self-reported vaccination for the current season was associated with a trend (p < 0.10) toward 
higher viral shedding in fine aerosol samples; vaccination with both the current and previous 
year’s seasonal vaccines, however, was significantly associated with greater fine aerosol 
shedding in unadjusted and adjusted models (p < 0.01); In adjusted models we observed 6.3 (95% 
CI 1.9 to 21.5) times more aerosol shedding among cases with vaccination in the current and 
previous season compared with having no vaccination in those two seasons. Vaccination was not 
associated with coarse aerosol or NP shedding (p > 0.10). The association of vaccination and 
shedding was significant for influenza A (p = 0.03) and not for influenza B (p = 0.83) infections 
(Table S4).   
Viral load in NP swabs was not a significant predictor of aerosol shedding (p = 0.16 for fine and 
p = 0.48 for coarse aerosols). Temperature measured at the time of sampling, asthma history, 
smoking, and influenza type were not significantly associated with the extent of measured 
shedding. While self-reported symptoms were not associated with aerosol shedding, they were 
significantly associated with shedding measured by the NP swab; only upper respiratory 
symptoms remained significant when adjusted for other symptoms and age. Increasing age was 
associated with a significant decrease in shedding in the NP swab; however, age was not 
associated with aerosol shedding.  
Discussion 
We recovered infectious influenza virus from 52 samples of fine aerosols collected from exhaled 
breath and spontaneous coughs produced by 142 cases of symptomatic influenza infection during 
218 clinic visits. Finding infectious virus in 39% of fine aerosol samples collected during 30 
minutes of normal tidal breathing in a large community based study of confirmed influenza 
infection clearly establishes that a significant fraction of influenza cases routinely shed infectious 
virus, not merely detectable RNA, into aerosol particles small enough to remain suspended in air 
and present a risk for airborne transmission. Because these data were collected without 
volunteers having to breathe through a mouthpiece or perform forced coughs, they allow us to 
provide estimates of average shedding rates, variability and time course of and risk factors for 
shedding that can be used to provide well-grounded parameter estimates in future models of the 
risk of airborne influenza transmission from people with symptomatic illness.

The first published estimates of the numbers of influenza virus variants transmitted from donor 
to recipient host indicated that the bottleneck for transmission between humans is fairly wide and 
highly variable (mean 192 with 95% confidence 66 – 392).(14, 15) Our observation that cases 
shed considerable quantities of virus into aerosols, geometric mean >104 RNA copies / 30 
minutes and up to 103 infectious virus particles/ 30 minutes, suggests that large numbers of 
variants could be transmitted via aerosols, especially via the short-range mode.(16) However, 
longer range aerosol transmission, as might be observed in less crowded environments than in 
the initial report from Hong Kong, would be expected to usually result in lower exposures and 
transmission of fewer variants, consistent with the narrower bottleneck described in ferret 
models.(17)(18) 
Sobel et al.(14) suggested that the width of the bottleneck increased with severity of illness, as 
indicated by a borderline significant positive association between temperature and number of 
variants transmitted. We did not see a significant association between measured temperature and 
shedding by any route. In contrast, symptoms were not a significant predictor of bottleneck size, 
and in our data, symptoms were not significant predictors for shedding into aerosols. Symptoms 
were, however, significant predictors for nasal shedding as measured in NP swabs. Thus, if 
aerosols were the more important route of transmission, our observations would be consistent 
with the currently available bottleneck analysis.   
We observed that influenza cases rarely sneezed, despite having just undergone two NP swab 
collections (a procedure that generally makes one feel an urge to sneeze). Sneezing was not 
observed in the absence of cough and was not associated with greater aerosol shedding than we 
observed with cough alone (Fig. S3). Thus, sneezing does not appear to make an important 
contribution to influenza virus shedding in aerosols. Sneezing might make a contribution to 
surface contamination. Because sneezes generate considerable amounts of large droplet spray 
composed of many ballistic droplets not collected by our sampler, we cannot assess that 
possibility with our data.    
Cough was prevalent and was a strong predictor of virus shedding into both coarse and fine 
aerosols. However, cough was not necessary for infectious aerosol generation in the ≤ 5 µm (fine) 
aerosol fraction; we detected culturable virus in fine aerosols during 48% of sampling sessions

when no coughs were observed. This suggests that exhaled droplets, generated by mechanisms 
other than cough, are responsible for a portion of the viral load observed in the fine aerosol 
fraction. Several researchers have recently shown that exhaled aerosol particles are frequently 
generated from normal healthy lungs by small airway closure and reopening.(19–21) It has been 
hypothesized that during respiratory infections, airway closure and reopening frequency would 
be increased due to inflammation with a commensurate increase in aerosol generation and 
contagiousness.(22)  
Cough is thought to produce aerosols from large airways by shear forces that produce relatively 
coarse aerosol droplets.(23) Our finding that only 13% of cases not observed to have coughed 
during sample collection produced detectable viral RNA in their coarse aerosols is consistent 
with that hypothesis. The remaining aerosols may have resulted from speaking; each subject was 
required to recite the alphabet three times. One might expect that viral replication in the large 
airways combined with cough generated coarse aerosol droplets would produce the majority of 
viral aerosols. However, we observed a weak correlation of coarse aerosol RNA copy number 
with cough frequency and a much stronger association of fine aerosol copy number with cough 
frequency even though cough would be expected to be the primary source of coarse aerosols. 
These observations suggest that cough is, at least in part, an epiphenomenon, more of a response 
to irritation associated with high viral loads in distal airways than a direct source of infectious 
aerosols.  
A striking finding was the association of gender with shedding into fine aerosols. This 
relationship appears to have resulted from a 3-fold greater impact of coughing on shedding in 
males. We observed these gender and gender by cough interaction effects only for the fine 
aerosol fraction. Absence of a gender effect in the coarse aerosol fraction suggests that this is not 
an effect of cough on aerosol generation by shear forces in the upper airway. We did not measure 
lung volumes and therefore cannot control for a lung size effect. An equally plausible 
explanation may be that women tend to have more sensitive cough reflexes.(24) Thus, women 
may have tended to cough in response to lower viral loads and coughed more frequently at a 
given viral load, which could have produced the observed steeper slope of viral load regressed on 
cough frequency in males compared with females. Consistent with this suggestion, we did

observe a significantly greater cough frequency in females (p=0.005) and a steeper slope of fine 
aerosol viral RNA with cough in males (Fig. S4). 
BMI was a borderline significant predictor of aerosol shedding in most models, was retained as 
an important predictor of both coarse and fine aerosols in adjusted models, and reached statistical 
significance for fine aerosols when adjusted for other factors; it was not a significant predictor of 
nasal shedding. This observation might be consistent with reports of increased inflammation in 
models of obesity and influenza and severity of ILI in obese persons. (25–30) Alternatively, 
increasing BMI is associated with increased frequency of small airways closure and the resulting 
increased aerosol generation during airway opening as described above may explain the stronger 
association of BMI with fine than coarse aerosols and lack of association with NP swabs. (31) 
Our analysis found a clear separation of factors associated with shedding from the nose and those 
with shedding into aerosols, especially fine particle aerosols. Upper airway symptoms, as would 
be expected, were strongly associated with shedding detected in NP swabs, and greatly reduced 
the size and significance of lower respiratory and systemic symptoms in the fully adjusted model. 
Age was negatively associated with nasal shedding but not a predictor of aerosol shedding. More 
surprisingly, no symptoms, including lower respiratory and systemic systems, were strongly 
associated with shedding into aerosols, in this population with relatively mild lower respiratory 
symptoms (Fig. 1). Furthermore, nasal shedding was not a significant predictor of aerosol 
shedding and none of the strong predictors of aerosol shedding were associated with nasal 
shedding. Thus, we can conclude that the head airways made a negligible contribution to viral 
aerosol generation and that viral aerosols represent infection in the lung. Moreover, upper and 
lower airway infection appear to behave as though infection is compartmentalized and 
independent. In this context, it is notable that Varble et al.(18) observed that intra-host viral 
variants differ in the nasopharynx and lung of ferrets.  
We did not observe a significant decline of viral load detected in NP swabs. If day 1 after onset 
of symptoms (used as baseline for these analyses) in our cases was equivalent to a mixture of day 
1 and day 2 after experimental influenza virus inoculation in the report by Hayden et al.,(32) then 
our lack of finding a clear drop in nasal shedding over the next two days is reasonably consistent 
with the pattern reported for experimental infection. There is no available data for comparison of

aerosol shedding from published experimental infections. That we saw a much clearer pattern of 
rapid decline in aerosol shedding again suggests a separation of infection into upper and lower 
airway compartments in humans. 
The association of current and prior year vaccination with increased shedding of influenza A 
might lead one to speculate that certain types of prior immunity promote lung inflammation, 
airway closure and aerosol generation. This first observation of the phenomenon needs 
confirmation. If confirmed, this observation together with recent literature suggesting reduced 
protection with annual vaccination would have implications for influenza vaccination 
recommendations and policies.   
Materials and Methods 
Study Population and Sample Collection Procedures 
We recruited volunteers with acute respiratory illness on the University of Maryland-College 
Park campus (UMD) and surrounding community from December 2012 through March 2013. 
The UMD Institutional Review Board approved the study, and we obtained a signed consent (or 
assent and parental verbal assent) from volunteers who reported fever with a cough or sore throat. 
(Supplemental Fig. S5.)  
During the initial visit, we administered a brief screening questionnaire, measured oral 
temperature, height, weight, and collected two nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs [Copan, Murrieta, 
CA] for each volunteer screened. One swab was used to perform QuickVue A/B rapid tests for 
influenza (except when results of a rapid test performed by medical provider were available).  
The second NP swab was used for viral culture and PCR for those meeting enrollment criteria 
and for PCR in a random sample of 24 of those not enrolled. 
Participants were asked about sex, age, antipyretic use, vaccination status, use of steroid 
medications, medical and smoking history, to rate current symptoms on a 4-level scale [none=0, 
mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3], and to rate the worst symptoms during the illness thus far. We 
defined symptoms as upper respiratory (runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat, and 
earache), lower respiratory (chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough), and systemic 
(malaise, headache, muscle/joint ache, fever/sweats/chills, and swollen lymph nodes).

Volunteers were enrolled in exhaled breath collection if they met the following criteria: (1) 
positive QuickVue rapid test, or oral temperature >37.8°C plus cough or sore throat, and (2) 
presented within the first 3 days of symptom onset. Exhaled breath samples were collected using 
the Gesundheit-II (G-II) human source bioaerosol sampler as previously described.(12, 33) We 
collected exhaled breath for 30 min while the participant was seated with their face inside of the 
large open end of a cone shaped inlet for the G-II. The inlet cone draws in 130 L of air per min 
and allowed participants to breathe, talk, cough, and sneeze naturally throughout sample 
collection while maintaining >90% collection efficiency for exhaled and coughed droplets ≤ 100 
µm. Subjects were asked to breathe normally and to recite the alphabet once at 5, 15, and 25 
min). We collected “coarse” (>5 µm) aerosol droplets by impaction on a Teflon® surface and 
“fine” droplets (≤5µm and >0.05µm) by condensation growth and impaction on a steel surface 
constantly rinsed into a buffer containing (phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum 
albumin) liquid reservoir. Audible spontaneous coughs and sneezes during breath collection were 
counted by direct observation in real-time (n = 59) or by playback of digital recordings (n = 159).  
Participants enrolled prior to the third day after symptom onset were asked to come in for up to 
two consecutive daily follow-up visits (Fig. S5) with repeat questionnaire, NP swab and exhaled 
breath collections. Final analyses included only visits for enrolled cases occurring on days 1 to 3 
post symptom onset with complete data on cough and sneeze, symptoms, PCR results for swab 
and aerosol samples. 
Laboratory Methods 
Detailed methods are described in the supporting information. Briefly, NP swabs were eluted in 
1 mL of a phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumen (PBS/0.1% BSA) or 
universal transport medium [UTM, Copan, Murrieta, CA], and Teflon® impactors were scrubbed 
with a nylon swab saturated with PBS/0.1% BSA. The swab was eluted in 1 ml PBS/0.1% BSA.  
Fine aerosol samples were concentrated to 1 mL using centrifugal ultrafiltration.    
RNA was extracted from NP swab, fine and course aerosol samples, and whole-virion standards 
using an automated Qiagen system and viral RNA was quantified by one-step real-time RT-PCR 
using Taqman primer probe sets designed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and made 
available through our cooperative agreement. Standard curves were calibrated for virus copy

number using plasmids containing a cDNA copy of the RT-qPCR target amplicon. 
Experimentally determined limits of detection and quantification for each of the RT-qPCR 
reactions are shown in Table S5.  
Virus culture on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells was used to detect infectious virus 
in NP swab and fine aerosol samples. Coarse aerosol samples were not cultured for infectious 
virus because impaction on a dry Teflon® surface was expected to reduce infectivity of those 
samples. Infectious influenza virus was quantified using an immunofluorescence assay for 
influenza nucleoprotein, and positive cells were counted as FFU by fluorescence microscopy. 
Details of laboratory methods can be found in the Online Supplement.  
Statistical Analysis 
We entered and cleaned data using locally hosted REDCap data capture tools(34) and performed 
data management and analyses in R (version 3.2.3 R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) 
and SAS (version 9.4, Cary, NC, USA), and produced graphics with Prism Software ((PRISM 
software version 7.0; GraphPad). We used the delta method to estimate confidence limits for 
sensitivity and specificity. We used Spearman correlation, generalized linear models (SAS Proc 
GENMOD), and Tobit regression(35) with nested random effects of sample within subject in 
(SAS Proc NLMIXED) to analyze infectious virus counts, RNA copy numbers and compute 
geometric mean virus concentrations. Tobit regression accounted for uncertainty and censoring 
of the observations by the limit of quantification. We included all independent variables with 
unadjusted p < 0.10 in initial adjusted models and selected final models using the Akaike 
information criterion while retaining adjustment for age and sex. Regression model results are 
presented as the ratio of shedding at the 75th percentile to shedding at the 25th percentile of the 
distribution of the independent variable so that clinical and epidemiological meaning of the 
relationship can be more easily interpreted.
