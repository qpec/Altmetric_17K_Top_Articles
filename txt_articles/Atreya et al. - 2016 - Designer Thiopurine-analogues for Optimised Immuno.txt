Abstract
Background and Aims: The clinical use of azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine is limited by their 
delayed onset of action and potential side effects such as myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity. As 
these drugs specifically target the Vav1/Rac1 signalling pathway in T lamina propria lymphocytes 
via their metabolite 6-thio-GTP
, we studied expression and optimised suppression of this pathway 
in inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD].
Methods: Rac1 and Vav1 expressions were analysed in mucosal immune cells in IBD patients. 
Targeted molecular modelling of the 6-thio-GTP molecule was performed to optimise Rac1 blockade; 
44 modified designer thiopurine-analogues were tested for apoptosis induction, potential toxicity, 
and immunosuppression. Activation of the Vav1/Rac1 pathway in lymphocytes was studied in IBD 
patients and in lamina propria immune cells in the presence or absence of thiopurine-analogues.
Results: Several thiopurine-analogues induced significantly higher T cell apoptosis than 
6-mercaptopurine. We identified a compound, denoted B-0N, based on its capacity to mediate 
earlier and stronger induction of 
T cell apoptosis than 6-mercaptopurine. B-0N-treatment resulted 
in accelerated inhibition of Rac1 activity in primary peripheral blood 
T cells as well as in intestinal 
lamina propria immune cells. Compared with 6-thio-GTP and 6-mercaptopurine, B-0N-treatment 
was associated with decreased myelo- and hepatotoxicity.
Conclusions: The Vav1/Rac1 pathway is activated in mucosal immune cells in IBD. The designer 
thiopurine-analogue B-0N induces immunosuppression more potently than 6-mercaptopurine.

 1. Introduction
During the past five decades, classic thiopurines like azathioprine 
and 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] have proven their therapeutic effi-
cacy in the treatment of a large variety of autoimmune and chronic 
inflammatory diseases. As a prime example, patients suffering from 
inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] benefit from a thiopurine-based 
long-term immunosuppressive therapy.1,2 Nevertheless, the main 
limitation of 6-MP is its delayed onset of action, which dramatically 
constricts the efficacy of thiopurines in settings of acute inflamma-
tion. Accordingly, thiopurine monotherapy has to be supported by 
concurrent steroid therapy during the initiation period.3,4
The specific induction of immunosuppression by azathioprine 
and 6-MP remained unclear for many decades and was initially 
thought to be due to random incorporation of 6-thioguanine [6-TG] 
into DNA and RNA in highly proliferating cells.5 However, lamina 
propria T cells are hypoproliferative and random incorporation of 
metabolites was unlikely to result in specific immunosuppression in 
IBD patients. Indeed, recent studies identified another, specific mech-
anism by which thiopurines induce mucosal immunosuppression.6,7,8 
Both azathioprine and 6-MP were found to produce the metabolite 
6-thio-GTP that blocks the activity of the small GTPase Rac1 in 
T lymphocytes.6,7,8 By competing with GTP for the binding to the 
small GTPase Rac1, 6-thio-GTP successfully diminishes the interac-
tion between Rac1 and its guanosine exchange factor Vav1, induces 
accumulation of 6-thio-GDP-bound inactive Rac1 molecules, blocks 
activation of NF-kappaB and STAT-3, and subsequently induces 
apoptosis of activated peripheral and lamina propria T lympho-
cytes.6,7 The clinical relevance of these findings was highlighted by 
quantification of 6-thio-GDP and 6-thio-GTP levels in erythrocytes 
from azathioprine- and 6-MP-treated IBD patients. These studies 
suggested quantification of functionally inactive 6-thio-GDP and 
functionally active 6-thio-GTP as useful parameters to monitor thio-
purine therapy in IBD patients and to predict clinical response.9
The 6-thio-GTP molecule appears a promising parent substance 
for the development of a new generation of immunosuppressive 
agents. Aiming at an optimised blockade of the interaction between 
Rac1 and Vav1 in lamina propria T cells in IBD, targeted modifica-
tions of 6-thio-GTP were synthesised based on molecular modelling. 
A compound leading to more rapid and potent apoptosis of T lym-
phocytes than 6-MP was identified and showed marked suppression 
of Rac1 activation in activated lamina propria immune cells.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Patients
Lamina propria mononuclear cells [LPMCs] and gut cryosections 
were obtained from surgical resections or biopsy specimens of IBD 
patients [n = 27] or control non-IBD patients [n = 18]; mRNA was 
isolated from biopsy specimens of IBD patients [n = 11] or control 
non-IBD patients [n = 7]. In order to analyse thiopurine-mediated 
effects on intestinal epithelial cells [IEC], biopsy specimens from IBD 
patients were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 in the presence of 
B-0N [5 µM] or were left untreated overnight.
2.2. Ethical statement
Human material was obtained from Department of Medicine 1, 
University Hospital of Erlangen [Germany]. The collection of sam-
ples was approved by the local ethical committee and the institu-
tional review board of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and 
each patient gave written informed consent.
2.3. Cells
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC] from buffy 
coat blood were purified using CD4 Dynal beads/ detachabeads 
[Invitrogen]. CD4+ T cells were stimulated in complete RPMI-
1640 with plate-bound antibodies to CD3 [BD Biosciences; 0.04–
0.2 µg/ml] and soluble CD28 antibodies [BD Biosciences; 1 µg/
ml] plus IL-2 [R&D Systems; 40 
U/ml]; 6-MP [Sigma-Aldrich], 
6-thio-GTP [JenaBioscience], and different thiopurine-analogues 
[JenaBioscience] were added at a final concentration of 5 μM.
For performing mixed lymphocyte reaction, PBMC from buffy 
coat blood of two allogenic donors were mixed in a 1:1 ratio and 
cultured for 5 days. Supernatants were analysed for IFN-γ concen-
tration by ELISA [ebioscience].
If indicated, isolated PBMC were exposed to LPS [10 
ng/ml] or 
recombinant tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha [10 
ng/ml] and cul-
tivated for 5 days. Supernatants were analysed for IFN-γ and IL-6 
concentration by ELISA [ebioscience].
Lamina propria mononuclear cells [LPMCs] were isolated from 
surgical resections or biopsy specimens using the Lamina Propria 
Dissociation Kit [Miltenyi Biotec]. LPMC were stimulated with 
plate-bound antibodies to CD3 or bead-bound antibodies to CD2 
[Miltenyi Biotec; 0.05 µg/ml], and soluble CD28 antibodies plus 
IL-2; 6-MP and B-0N were added to LPMC cultures at a final con-
centration of 20 µM.
2.4. Molecular modelling
Aiming at an increased affinity for Rac1, sites for the modifications 
on the 6-thio-GTP molecule were selected which were unlikely to 
interfere with the binding of nucleotide to Rac1.10 Three sites were 
finally selected [Supplementary Figure 1, available as Supplementary 
data at ECCO-JCC online]. A virtual library with more than 100 
compounds was generated and docked to the Rac1 structure. 
Preparation of compound library, protein structure, and own dock-
ing was done with program Maestro [Schrödinger, LCC, New York, 
NY]. If some particular compounds turned out to be non-synthesi-
sable or stable, other compounds from the ranked list were selected.
To explain observed differences between the groups, representa-
tive compounds from each group were re-docked as described above 
to the complex structure of Rac1 in complex with Vav1.11
2.5. Detection of apoptosis
For the detection of T cell apoptosis, the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay 
[Promega] was used. T cells were stimulated via CD3/CD28 and 
cultivated in triplicates in 96-well-plates in the presence of 6-MP 
or indicated thiopurine-analogues for indicated periods of time or 
were left untreated. At the day of analysis, Caspase-3/7 assay was 
performed [25 µl of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent/well]. After 30 
min of 
incubation, probes were analysed in a luminometer. Luminescence 
signal of untreated cells was defined as 100% Caspase-3 activity. 
Based on detected luminescence signals, the Caspase activity of 
treated cells was calculated accordingly: increase of Caspase activityx 
[%] = Caspase activityx [%] – Caspase activityuntreated [%].
For Nicoletti staining of apoptotis, 12 cells were stained over-
night in propidium iodide staining solution [1% sodium citrate, 1% 
Triton-x, 50 µg/ml propidium iodide] and were afterwards analysed 
by flow cytometry. Increase of apoptotic cell nuclei was defined as 
difference between the percentage of apoptotic cells in the treated 
and untreated probes.
AnnexinV BD Horizon V450 and propidium iodide [BD] 
were used in order to detect apoptotic LPMC. FACS analysis was

 performed by BD LSR Fortessa™, BD FACS Diva software, and 
FlowJo software [Tree Star]. Increase of apoptotic cells was defined 
as difference between the percentage of apoptotic cells in the treated 
and untreated probes.
2.6. Immunoprecipitation
Rac1/Vav1 interaction was analysed by immunoprecipitation of 
Rac1 followed by Vav1 western blot. Cell lysates were pre-incubated 
with A/G Plus agarose [Santa Cruz] in order to minimise unspecific 
protein binding. Cleared lysates were incubated with anti-Rac1 anti-
body [Santa Cruz] and A/G Plus agarose for 3 
h at 4°C. Agarose 
beads were collected followed by denaturation and Vav1 western 
blot analysis.
2.7
. Rac1 activation assay
Levels of activated GTP-bound Rac1 in T cells were determined by 
performing a Rac Activation Assay [Millipore] in accordance with the 
protocol provided by the manufacturer, with minor modifications.
Levels of activated GTP-bound Rac1 in LPMCs were determined 
by using Rac1 G-LISA Activation Assay [Cytoskeleton] in accord-
ance with the protocol provided by the manufacturer.
2.8. Rac1 and Vav1 expression
Rabbit anti-Vav1 antibody [Santa Cruz], rabbit anti-Rac1 antibody 
[Santa Cruz], mouse anti-CD4 antibody [BD], biotinylated anti-
rabbit IgG antibody [Jackson ImmunoResearch], Cy3 anti-mouse 
IgG antibody [Vector Laboratories], Cy3 streptavidin or Dylight488 
streptavidin [biolegend], and Hoechst 33342 [Molecular Probes] 
were used for immunofluorescence staining of gut cryosections or 
of LPMCs cytospins. Immunofluorescence microscopy [Olympus] 
or confocal microscopy [Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal micro-
scope] allowed imaging. If indicated, quantification was performed 
by counting positive cells in three high power fields per probe.
In order to perform FACS analysis of Rac1 in LPMCs, cells 
were stained with anti-CD4 VioBlue antibody [Miltenyi Biotec] 
and treated with eBioscience Fixation/Permeabilization and 
Permeabilization Buffer in order to allow intracellular staining with 
rabbit anti-Rac1 antibody [Santa Cruz] and anti-rabbit Cy3 second-
ary antibody [biolegend]. Rabbit IgG [Santa Cruz] was used for iso-
type control stainings. Mean fluorescence quotient of Rac1 signal 
in CD4+ cells and isotype signal was calculated in order to define 
relative expression of Rac1.
LPMCs were exposed to ex vivo activation by anti-CD3 [0.4 µg/
ml] and anti-CD28 [2 µg/ml] antibodies plus IL-2 [80 
U/ml] before 
Rac1 expression analysis.
Vav1 expression in gut biopsies was analysed by real-time poly-
merase chain reaction [RT-PCR]. Extracted mRNA [RNeasy Micro 
Kit; Qiagen] was reversely transcribed into cDNA [AffinityScript 
Multiple Temperature RT; Agilent Technologies]. ABsolute SYBR 
Green Mix [ThermoScientific] and gene-specific QuantiTect Primer 
Assays [Qiagen] were used for RT-PCR analysis. HPRT was used as 
reference gene and relative Vav1 expression was compared between 
different probes. A reference value was calculated in each set of 
probes based on the mean CT-values for Vav1 and HPRT of all con-
trol probes and was normalised to 1.
2.9. Western blot
Western blotting was performed as described recently,6 including 
anti-γ-H2A.X [Millipore], anti-Vav1 [Cell Signalling], anti-Actin 
[Cell Signalling], and anti-Rac1 [Santa Cruz] antibodies.
2.10. Quantification of 6-TG incorporation into 
cellular DNA
Cells were cultivated in the presence of 6-thio-GTP or B-0N. After 
isolation of DNA and enzymatic hydrolysis to the deoxynucleosides, 
6-thiodeoxyguanosine was quantified by HPLC as described for 
6-thioguanosine diphosphate and 6-thioguanosine triphosphate13 
with minor modifications.
2.11. Determination of genomic DNA methylation
Quantification of 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine and 2’-deoxycytidine in 
cellular DNA was performed by a LC-MS-MS based assay similar to 
a previously described method.14
2.12. Comet assay
Comet assay was performed as described recently.15 Cells were embed-
ded in low-melting point agarose onto agarose-coated slides and were 
lysed for 1 
h in lysis buffer [2.5 
M NaCl, 100 
mM EDTA, 10 
mM Tris-
HCl, 1% Na-laurylsarcosine, 1% Triton X-100, 10% DMSO]. Slides 
were alkali-denatured for 25 
min in electrophoresis buffer [300 
mM 
NaOH, 1 
mM EDTA; pH > 13] and electrophoresed at 25 
V [300 
mA] for 15 
min. After neutralisation [0.4 
M Tris; pH 7.5], slides were 
fixed in ethanol, dried, stained with ethidium bromide [20 µg/ml] 
and analysed microscopically [Olympus BX50]. Olive-tail-moment 
[OTM] was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity using 
Kinetic Imaging Komet 4.02 software [BFI Optilas].
2.13. In vitro toxicity assay
In vitro myelotoxicity was analysed by cultivating human bone mar-
row mononuclear cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of 
6-MP, 6-thio-GTP, or B-0N. Intracellular adenosine triphosphate [ATP] 
was determined by an assay based on a reaction between ATP, luciferin, 
and oxygen catalysed by luciferase. The emitted light is proportional 
to the amount of ATP present; 50 μl of ATP Releasing Reagent were 
added to each well. After 15 
min of incubation at 37°C, 100 μl of ATP 
Monitoring Reagent were added to each well and mixed carefully. The 
plates were left to equilibrate for 2 
min in the dark before luminescence 
measurement by using a Packard Lumicount™ spectrophotometer.
For the hepatotoxicity assay, HepG2 cells were cultivated for 48 
h 
in the presence of increasing concentrations of 6-MP, 6-thio-GTP, or 
B-0N or were left untreated. Cell viability was analysed based on 
intracellular ATP determination using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent 
Cell Viability Assay [Promega]. LDH release was analysed using the 
CytoTox 96 Non Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay [Promega]. Alamar 
Blue assay quantified cytotoxicity based on a fluorometric detection of 
reduction of rezasurin [alamar Blue] to resorufin in response to mito-
chondrial activity. Cells were seeded in 96-well-plates and, after 48 
h 
of treatment, 25 μl/well of the indicator were added and samples were 
incubated at 37°C for 3 
h. Plates were read spectrofluorimetrically.
2.14. Analysis of analogue binding to Rac1
Recombinant GST-Rac1 protein was incubated for 10 
min at 30°C 
with 5 µM radiolabelled GTP [1µCi [33P]GTP, Amershan Biosciences] 
and 50 µM test compound [nucleotide of B-0N] in 20 µl of Buffer-C 
[50 
mM Tris pH = 7.5, 12.5 
mM MgCl2, 750 
mM NaCl] in the pres-
ence of 10 
mM EDTA. After incubation, 10 
mM MgCl2 were added 
and probes were stored on ice. After addition of 900 µl Buffer-C, 
probes were filtered through glass microfibre filters [Whatman] fol-
lowed by scintillation counting.
Jurkat T cells were cultured for 72 
h in the presence of 
B-0N. Cells were lysed and 5 
mg of lysates were used for Rac1

 immunoprecipitation using the Catch and Release Assay [Millipore] 
and anti-Rac1 antibody [Santa Cruz]. Immunoprecipitates were 
denatured and analysed for the presence of B-0N by LC-MS-MS.
2.15. Statistical analysis
Tests for significance of differences were made by t tests using the 
program Excel.
3. Results
3.1. Increased expression of thiopurine target Vav1 
in IBD patients
The immunosuppressive efficacy of thiopurines in IBD is mainly based 
on the capacity of the thiopurine metabolite 6-thio-GTP to impair 
the Vav1/Rac1 interaction in activated T cells.6,7 To further study the 
Vav1/Rac1 pathway in IBD, we performed expression analysis of the 
guanosine exchange factor Vav1 and the small GTPase Rac1 in colonic 
lamina propria cells from IBD patients by using immunohistochemis-
try. Whereas the number of Rac1-expressing lamina propria mononu-
clear cells [LPMCs] was not increased in the inflamed mucosa of IBD 
patients, we observed a significantly higher number of Vav1-expressing 
immune cells within the inflamed intestinal lamina propria of IBD 
patients as compared with non-inflamed control tissue [Figure 1A]. 
Furthermore, significantly increased Vav1 mRNA levels could be 
detected in the inflamed gut mucosa of IBD patients as compared with 
control patients [Figure 1B], indicating upregulation of Vav1 expres-
sion in IBD. However, FACS and immunohistochemistry analyses on 
cellular Rac1 expression showed no differences between Rac1 expres-
sion in freshly isolated or ex vivo activated LPMCs from IBD patients 
as compared with controls [Figure 1C–E]. Taken together, these find-
ings suggested that the activation of the Vav1/Rac1 signalling pathway 
in IBD is dependent on augmented Vav1 rather than Rac1 expression.
3.2. Targeted modification of 6-thio-GTP for 
optimised blockade of the Vav1/Rac signalling 
pathway in 
T cells and apoptosis induction
As Vav1 activity on Rac1 is the molecular target of 6-MP, 6,7 we next 
focused on the identification of more specific inhibitors of Vav1 guano-
sine exchange activity. In these studies, the active thiopurine metabolite 
6-thio-GTP was chosen as parent compound for subsequent molecular 
modelling. Several modifications of 6-thio-GTP were designed, taking 
into account the results of structural analysis, molecular docking and 
the feasibility of the chemical synthesis. Different sites of 6-thio-guano-
sine were selected for modifications [Supplementary Figure. 1, available 
as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online], resulting in six different 
groups [A–F] of thiopurine-analogues by adding different linkers and 
functional groups to the ribose or the purine base [Figure 2A, C].
To determine the ability of thiopurine-analogues to induce T cell 
apoptosis, we analysed caspase-3 activation in primary human CD4+ 
T cells upon incubation with thiopurine-analogues. In an initial set of 
experiments, three groups of thiopurine-analogues [group A, group 
C, group D] were studied [Figure 2B]. All compounds were used at 
a 5 µM concentration, as the same concentration of azathioprine/6-
MP resulted in intracellular 6-thioguanine levels comparable to 
blood leukocytes of azathioprine-treated IBD patients.7 In contrast 
to 6-MP, none of the thiopurine-analogues from group A and group 
C was able to induce significant caspase-3 activation, suggesting 
that these modifications abolished the apoptosis-inducing activ-
ity. However, several thiopurine-analogues from group D, which 
were all modified at the ribose of 6-thio-GTP, induced a significant 
activation of caspase-3 [Figure 2B]. Docking of these compounds into 
X-structures of the Rac1/Vav1 complex11 suggested a relevant influ-
ence of ribose modifications on the Vav1/Rac1 interaction. Whereas 
linkers which were added to the purine base protruded from the 
Rac1/Vav1 interface, diminishing the chance to influence the activa-
tion by Vav1, atoms of the ribose modifications turned out to be 
in close proximity to the Rac1-binding site of Vav1, suggesting a 
high probability of interaction with Vav1 [Figure 2A]. Consequently, 
additional thiopurine-analogues [group B, group E, group F] with 
ribose-linked modifications were generated [Figure 2C]. All com-
pounds of group B and a vast majority of group E analogues resulted 
in a significant increase in caspase-3 activity, although this was less 
pronounced with group F compounds [Figure 2D]. Thus, the specific 
structure of the introduced linker had significant effects on the apop-
tosis-inducing capacity of thiopurine-analogues. In contrast to 6-MP, 
even lower concentrations [ < 5 μM] of group B compounds resulted 
in significant pro-apoptotic effects [Supplementary Figure 2, avail-
able as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]. Thus, in order 
to further characterise effects of group B compounds on T lympho-
cytes, B-0N was analysed exemplarily in subsequent experiments.
3.3. B-0N suppresses Rac1 activation and mediates 
early and more pronounced immunosuppressive 
effects than 6-MP
To further characterise the general immunosuppressive potential of B-0N 
[Figure 3A], we analysed mixed lymphocyte reactions [MLR]16 in subse-
quent studies. In an allogenic MLR setting, B-0N led to a significant reduc-
tion in production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ [Figure 3B], 
whereas 6-MP had no significant effect. This marked immunosuppressive 
capacity of B-0N in the context of allogenic T cell responses, as well as 
its inability to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in TNF- 
or LPS-exposed human PBMC in the absence of T cell specific stimuli 
[Supplementary Figure 3, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC 
online], implied that activated T lymphocytes represent the main target 
population of B-0N within the human immune system.
Considering the crucial role of 6-thio-GTP-mediated Rac1 block-
age in thiopurine-induced T cell apoptosis,6,7 we next tested the 
capacity of B-0N to interact with Rac1 activation. It was found 
that the nucleotide of B-0N was able to compete with radiolabelled 
GTP for binding to recombinant GST-Rac1 protein [Supplementary 
Figure 4, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online ]. 
Furthermore, B-0N could be retrieved by LC-MS-MS in Rac1 immu-
noprecipitates from B-0N-treated Jurkat T cells [0.75 pmol B-0N/ 
5 
mg cell lysate]. In addition, a diminished Rac1/Vav1 interaction 
was noted in B-0N-treated T cells [Figure 3C]. Thus, B-0N can suc-
cessfully block the interaction between Rac1 and Vav1 and subse-
quently the activation of effector immune cells.
To assess whether the new compounds would overcome the delayed 
onset of action of the classic thiopurine 6-MP
, the ability of B-0N to induce 
T cell apoptosis at earlier time points was assayed. B-0N was able to medi-
ate a significant induction of caspase-3 activity after 3 days, whereas treat-
ment with the classic thiopurine 6-MP did not result in significant effects 
[Figure 3D]. Comparing these early effects of B-0N in CD4+ T cells from 
patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, no differences could be 
observed between the two entities [Supplementary Figure 5, available as 
Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online]. B-0N-induced T cell apopto-
sis could furthermore be confirmed by Nicoletti staining12 [Supplementary 
Figure 6, available as Supplementary data at ECCO-JCC online, ].
Next, we focused on early Rac1 activation. Even at day 2 of in 
vitro treatment, B-0N was able to block effectively the activation of 
Rac1, whereas 6-MP-treatment did not result in detectable reduction

 of Rac1 activity [Figure 3E]. Thus, the thiopurine-analogue B-0N 
suppressed activation of Rac1 and induced T cell apoptosis of pri-
mary lymphocytes at earlier time points than 6-MP.
3.4 Favourable toxicity profile of B-0N
The clinical use of thiopurines, and in particular of 6-thioguanine, may 
be limited by side effects such as hepatotoxicity and myelotoxicity17–19 as 
well as by potential carcinogenic effects.20 Therefore, we next analysed 
toxicity of B-0N by using human bone marrow cells and HepG2 cells. 
The parent compound 6-thio-GTP showed markedly higher myelotoxic 
effects compared with 6-MP [Table 1], but B-0N showed significantly 
lower myelotoxicity than 6-MP.
Hepatotoxicity screening revealed a moderate L-lactic dehydrogenase 
[LDH] release in all treatment groups [< 50% at a 1000 µM concentration]

Mixed lymphocyte reaction [MLR] was performed in the presence of 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] or B-0N [B]. At Day 5, supernatants were analysed for IFN-γ 
concentration. IFN-γ production of untreated cells was defined as 100% [mean + SEM from three experiments]. In addition, effects of B-0N on the Rac1/Vav1 
interaction were analysed. CD4+ 
T cells were treated with 6-MP or B-0N and analysed for Rac1/Vav1 interaction by immunoprecipitation at Day 3 [C]. Early pro-
apoptotic effects of B-0N were quantified by measuring caspase-3 activity at Day 3 of in vitro treatment. Untreated cells were used as references [mean + SEM; 
n = 28] [D]. At Day 2 of in vitro treatment, cells were analysed for the activation of Rac1. Results from Rac1 activation assay were quantified by densitometry.

 and measurement of mitochondrial functionality showed overall no severe 
toxicity in HepG2 cells [Supplementary Figure 7]. However, analysis of 
ATP 
levels indicated a potent toxicity of 6-thio-GTP in hepatic cells [Table 2] 
consistent with several reports on severe liver damage [nodular regenerative 
 
hyperplasia, veno-occlusive disease] in 6-thioguanine-treated patients.21 In 
contrast, B-0N showed significantly lower hepatotoxicity, comparable to 
6-MP.
Taken together, these findings suggested that the thiopurine analogue 
B-0N has significantly lower myelotoxicity and hepatotoxicity than 
6-thio-GTP or 6-MP.
To understand the lower toxic effects of B-0N compared with 
its parent compound 6-thio-GTP, we next assessed a possible influ-
ence of these compounds on DNA integrity. As 6-TG incorporation 
into cellular DNA is a well established marker for DNA damage 
and cytotoxicity after thiopurine treatment,22,23 DNA incorpora-
tion was analysed for B-0N and 6-thio-GTP. Jurkat T and CCF-
CEM cells, both DNA mismatch repair defective cell lines,24 were 
used to clarify whether treatment with 6-thio-GTP and B-0N 
would result in any 6-TG incorporation into cellular DNA. As soon 
as 1 day after in vitro treatment with 6-thio-GTP, both cell lines 
showed marked 6-TG incorporation into cellular DNA [Figure 4A, 
Supplementary Figure. 8, available as Supplementary data at 
ECCO-JCC online].
Interestingly, markedly lower levels of DNA-incorporated 6-TG 
were found upon B-0N-treatment. B-0N-treated CCF-CEM cells 
showed an approximately 3-fold decreased 6-TG incorporation 
into cellular DNA compared with 6-thio-GTP-treated cells, and this 
difference was even more pronounced in Jurkat T cells [Figure 4A, 
Supplementary Figure 8] suggesting that the higher toxicity of 
6-thio-GTP might be due to more pronounced 6-TG incorporation 
into DNA, with subsequent DNA damage. Consistently, significantly 
elevated levels of Ser139 phosphorylated histone H2A.X [γ-H2A.X] 
could be detected in 6-thio-GTP treated Jurkat T cells [Figure 4B], 
indicating an increased presence of DNA double strand breaks. 25 In 
accordance with the low levels of DNA-incorporated 6-TG in B-0N-
treated Jurkat T cells, no elevated expression levels of γ-H2A.X 
were detected in these cells [Figure 4B]. Additionally, B-0N-treated 
primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes showed decreased levels of 
DNA-incorporated 6-TG [Figure 4C]. Further analysis of primary T 
cells in a comet assay15 revealed strong DNA-damaging capacity of 
6-thio-GTP, whereas 6-MP and B-0N showed significantly lower lev-
els of DNA damage than 6-thio-GTP [Figure 4D]. In agreement with 
the recently described DNA-demethylating capacity of thioguanine 
in T cells,26 our data also indicated an association between high lev-
els of 6-TG-incorporated DNA and reduced cytosine methylation. In 
fact, 6-thio-GTP-treated Jurkat T cells showed a reduced percentage 
of methylated cytosine within their DNA compared with untreated 
cells, whereas B-0N did not perturb this epigenetic pathway of gene 
regulation [Figure 4E].
3.5. B-0N induces significantly more apoptosis of 
activated gut immune cells in IBD as compared 
with 6-MP
As functional characteristics of T lymphocytes located in the gut 
lamina propria differ markedly from those of peripheral T cells,27 
the immunosuppressive capacity of B-0N was next studied in 
lamina propria mononuclear cells in IBD patients. In line with 
results acquired in blood CD4+ T cells, B-0N showed marked pro-
apoptotic effects in CD3/CD28-stimulated LPMCs [Figure 5A] 
and somehow milder, but still significant pro-apoptotic effects in 
CD2/CD28-stimulated LPMCs [Supplementary Figure 9]. B-0N 
was able to induce significantly more apoptotic cell death in CD3/
CD28-stimulated LPMCs from the inflamed gut of IBD patients 
than 6-MP [Figure 5A], but did not mediate relevant effects on 
proliferation or apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells [IECs] 
[Supplementary Figure 10, available as Supplementary data at 
ECCO-JCC online]. To determine whether this effect on LPMC 
apoptosis was related to specific blockade of the Vav1/Rac1 sig-
nalling pathway, we subsequently analysed Rac1 expression and 
activation in B-0N- and 6-MP-treated LPMCs. In these studies, 
we observed a significant blockade of Rac1 activation by 6-MP 
as compared with untreated cells [Figure 5B]. However, B-0N-
treatment resulted in a significantly higher suppression of Rac1 
activation as compared with 6-MP-treatment. As the expression 
levels of Rac1 were not affected [Figure 5 C,D], these findings 
suggested that B-0N specifically targets apoptotic cell death by 
blocking Rac1 activation.
4. Discussion
The clinical use of azathioprine and 6-MP is limited by their delayed 
onset of action and potential side effects such as myelosuppression and 
hepatotoxicity.3,4 As these drugs specifically target the Vav1/Rac1 sig-
nalling pathway via their metabolite 6-thio-GTP,6,7 we studied expres-
sion and optimised suppression of this pathway in IBD. We found 
that activation of this signalling pathway in IBD is mainly due to aug-
mented Vav1 expression in mucosal immune cells. Furthermore, we 
used rational drug design to develop thiopurine-analogues with higher 
potency to suppress Vav1-dependent Rac1 activation as compared 
with 6-MP. In an era in which many new drugs for therapy of IBD are 
introduced, our concept of modified thiopurine-analogues combines 
with key benefits: [i] it builds on six decades of clinical experience with 
thiopurine therapy and a well-described long-term safety profile; and 
[ii] it nevertheless might be able to translate newly gained insights into 
the molecular mechanism of action of thiopurines into an optimised 
therapeutic efficacy. Indeed, the thiopurine analogue B-0N blocked 
Rac1 activation faster and more effectively than 6-MP, and resulted in

Thiopurine-analogues for IBD

 significantly higher induction of apoptosis in CD3/CD28-stimulated 
mucosal immune cells in IBD. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggested 
that B-0N induces lower hepatotoxicity and myelotoxicity than 6-thio-
GTP and 6-MP. Collectively, our preclinical in vitro findings suggest 
that thiopurine-analogues such as B-0N may represent a novel class of 
optimised immunosuppressive agents for potential use in IBD.
The induction of T cell apoptosis has been linked to the therapeu-
tic efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs in IBD therapy. Specifically, 
the anti-TNF antibodies infliximab, certolizumab pegol, and adali-
mumab induce immunosuppression by causing T cell apoptosis.28,29 
Furthermore, apoptosis induction correlated with the clinical efficacy 
of anti-TNF therapy in IBD.30 Mechanistically, it was found that anti-
TNF antibodies target the interaction between membrane-bound 
TNF on antigen-presenting cells and TNFR2 on lamina propria T 
cells, thereby blocking costimulatory signalling and inducing T cell 
apoptosis.28 However, azathioprine targets another costimulatory 
pathway in T cells downstream of CD28 which is associated with 
activation of the Vav1/Rac1 signalling pathway. Here, we found that 
expression of the guanosine exchange factor Vav1 is augmented in 
mucosal immune cells in IBD patients, but expression of its target, the 
small GTPase Rac1, remained unaffected. Thus, these observations 
suggest that activation of the Vav1/Rac1 signalling pathway in IBD is 
at least partially due to augmented expression of Vav1. To optimise 
blockade of Vav1 activity on the Rac1 protein, we took advantage of 
steric modelling and searched for thiopurine-analogues with poten-
tially better capacity to block Vav1 binding to Rac1 and subsequently 
Rac1 activation. We synthesizsd more than 40 thiopurine-analogues, 
followed by testing of Rac1 blockade and apoptosis induction in T 
cells. The new compound B-0N caused earlier and more pronounced 
immunosuppressive and pro-apoptotic effects as compared with 
currently used thiopurines. As it was recently hypothesised that the 
latency of thiopurine efficacy reflects a slow step-by-step depletion 
of the antigen-specific memory T cell pool,8 the earlier and increased 
pro-apoptotic capacity of B-0N should significantly minimise this 
delay. Subsequent translational and clinical studies are now required 
in order to definitively verify this concept in IBD patients.
The therapeutic effects of thioguanine therapy in IBD were asso-
ciated with marked myelotoxicity and hepatotoxicity,21 raising con-
cerns that thiopurine-analogues might cause marked toxic side effects. 
Indeed, we found that the parent compound 6-thio-GTP results in 
significant myelotoxic and hepatotoxic effects in cell culture. In con-
trast, B-0N showed reduced toxicity levels even in comparison with 
6-MP. This favourable profile is probably due to the lower 6-thiogua-
nine DNA incorporation of 6-MP than 6-thio-GTP. Considering the 
recently described functional link between 6-thioguanine DNA incor-
poration and the pro-carcinogenic potential of classic thiopurine 
drugs,22 the decreased preference of B-0N for DNA incorporation 
suggests a potentially diminished cancer-promoting effect. Indeed, 
comet assays indicated relatively low DNA damage in T cells upon 
B-0N therapy when compared with 6-thio-GTP treatment.
As anti-TNF therapy is not effective in a subgroup of IBD 
patients, several new therapeutic approaches for IBD have been 
recently developed, targeting cytokine signalling or adhesion mole-
cules via antisense oligonucleotides or antibodies.31–35 Here, we have 
identified a new group of compounds that have potent apoptosis-
inducing capacities in activated mucosal immune cells and in blood 
peripheral T cells. The potential of B-0N for induction of immuno-
suppression in chronic colitis was implied by studies with ex vivo 
stimulated lamina propria immune cells from IBD patients, where 
B-0N caused a significant increase of immune cell apoptosis. The 
observed capacity of B-0N to induce higher levels of apoptosis in 
CD3/CD28-stimulated mucosal immune cells compared with 6-MP 
therapy was associated with a more prominent suppression of Rac1 
activity. Taken together with the favourable data on toxicity, these 
observations suggest a high potential of B-0N for optimised immu-
nosuppression, and might offer relevant implications for IBD ther-
apy. It will now be important to continue on the path and pave the 
way for subsequent clinical studies.
