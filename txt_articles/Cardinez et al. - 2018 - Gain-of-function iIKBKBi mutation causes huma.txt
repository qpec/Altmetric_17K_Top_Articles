Genetic mutations account for many devastating early onset immune deficiencies. In contrast, less severe and later onset 
immune diseases, including in patients with no prior family history, remain poorly understood. Whole exome sequencing in 
two cohorts of such patients identified a novel heterozygous de novo IKB 
KB missense mutation (c.607G>A) in two separate 
kindreds in whom probands presented with immune dysregulation, combined T and B cell deficiency, inflammation, and 
epithelial defects. IKB 
KB encodes IKK2, which activates NF-κB signaling. IKK2V203I results in enhanced NF-κB signaling, 
as well as T and B cell functional defects. IKK2V203 is a highly conserved residue, and to prove causation, we generated 
an accurate mouse model by introducing the precise orthologous codon change in Ikbkb using CRI 
SPR/Cas9. Mice and 
humans carrying this missense mutation exhibit remarkably similar cellular and biochemical phenotypes. Accurate mouse 
models engineered by CRI 
SPR/Cas9 can help characterize novel syndromes arising from de novo germline mutations 
and yield insight into pathogenesis.

Introduction
More than 300 single-gene defects that result in immunological 
disease have been described so far (Picard et al., 2018). Elucida-
tion of Mendelian immune diseases is important for the fami-
lies affected and, in some cases, provides insights into disease 
mechanisms that are of broader therapeutic significance for 
autoimmunity and lymphoproliferative disease (Woyach et al., 
2012). Among the known causes are many homozygous and bial-
lelic loss-of-function alleles that result in devastating early onset 
immunological disease. In addition, there is an emerging catalog 
of single-gene defects that result in much less severe phenotypes, 
and some of these syndromes share significant similarities with 
diseases assumed to be the result of polygenic variation.
Mutations that result in defective NF-κB signaling and tran-
scription are exemplary. NF-κB is a family of transcription fac-
tors that regulate gene expression in many tissues and exert 
important and well-characterized actions on lymphocyte ontog-
eny, homeostasis, activation, and maintenance of self-tolerance 
(Zhang et al., 2017). In the resting state, NF-κB molecules are re-
tained in latent form in the cytoplasm by molecules of the IκB 
family (Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1988). After receptor ligation, 
signals converge on a complex comprising IKK1, IKK2, and NEMO 
(encoded by IKB 
KA, IKB 
KB, and IKB 
KG, respectively), which 
phosphorylates IκBα, targeting it for partial degradation in the 
proteasome, which liberates NF-κB molecules p65 (RelA), c-Rel, 
and p50 (Fan and Maniatis, 1991; Salmerón et al., 2001; Häcker 
and Karin, 2006; Scheidereit, 2006) to the nucleus as transcrip-
tion factors (Plaksin et al., 1993; Weih et al., 1995; Bohuslav et al., 
1998; Hayden and Ghosh, 2004). Many germline NF-κB defects

have been identified as causes of immunological disease. In some 
cases, for example, CARD11, biallelic mutations cause early onset 
disease, while heterozygous variants cause different phenotypes 
(Snow et al., 2012; Stepensky et al., 2013). Interestingly, somatic 
mutations in many of the same NF-κB genes have also been im-
plicated in lymphoproliferative disease (Staudt, 2010).
Now that there is empirical evidence that single-gene vari-
ants can cause complex immune phenotypes, it is important 
that we explore rare and novel variants in cases where disease 
remains unexplained. De novo mutations are an important cause 
of severe sporadic disease with immunological and other pheno-
types (Vissers et al., 2010; Conley and Casanova, 2014; Flanagan 
et al., 2014), although in such cases, opportunities for proving 
causation by segregation analysis are usually limited. In addition, 
the catalog of variants of unknown significance is large. In both 
cases, methods for determining function of precise human muta-
tions that might account for a novel syndrome is a high priority. 
Here, we report how combined phenotyping of patients carrying 
a de novo gain-of-function mutation in IKB 
KB, and a mouse en-
gineered to carry the orthologous variant, helped to describe a 
novel immune syndrome.
Results and discussion
We assembled a cohort of patients with noncongenital immune 
deficiency, manifesting as either primary antibody deficiency, 
unexplained T cell deficiency, or various combined defects. 
From within this cohort we identified a patient who presented 
with recurrent respiratory tract infections, severe and atypical 
eczema, dental abnormalities consistent with ectodermal dyspla-
sia (without conical teeth), hidradenitis suppurativa and subcu-
taneous abscesses, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and premature 
cataracts. Both parents were alive with no evidence of immune 
deficiency or dysregulation. The proband had two children (aged 
2 and 5 yr), and both suffered with recurrent otitis media and 
sinusitis, but no inflammation or ectodermal dysplasia. Initial 
cellular analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) 
isolated from the proband and both children revealed lympho-
penias. One child, from whom blood was available for analysis, 
and the proband both exhibited T deficiency, and the other ex-
hibited a reduction in total lymphocytes for age. Lymphopenia 
was a fixed phenotype in the proband, with no significant change 
over at least 7 yr of observation (Table S1). In addition, she had 
mild hypogammaglobulinemia and defective specific antibody 
responses to pneumococcal vaccination.
Whole exome sequencing and analysis of kindred A using 
methods described previously (Field et al., 2015) identified a 
novel heterozygous missense mutation in IKB 
KB (c.607G>A, 
cDNA.793G>A, g.37639G>A) encoding a valine to isoleucine 
(V203>I) amino acid substitution (Fig. 1, a and b). No other rare 
or novel mutations were identified in genes encoding NF-κB 
proteins. The IKB 
KB mutation was not found in either parent, 
and after excluding nonpaternity with high confidence, we con-
cluded that the mutation had arisen de novo in the proband. An 
identical codon variation was discovered in a separate and geo-
graphically remote kindred (Fig. 1, a and b), involving a 33-yr-old 
male proband with a history of recurrent respiratory infections, 
otitis media, and tonsillitis since childhood. He was noted to 
have hypogammaglobulinemia at age 18 yr and subcutaneous 
abscesses at age 28 yr. Further investigations revealed bronchi-
ectasis (Fig. 1 c) and hepatosplenomegaly (Table S1).
Valine 203 is conserved to at least Drosophila melanogaster 
(Fig. 1 d), is located within the active site of IKK2 (Fig. 1, e and f), 
on the second lobe of the kinase domain, which phosphorylates 
the N-terminal region of IκBα, and leads to activation of NF-κB 
(Liu et al., 2013). The mutant protein is predicted to assume an 
unstable conformation, while maintaining the kinase activity, 
but disrupting the tetrameric interaction of IKK2. The mutated 
residue is conserved in protein paralogs of IKK2 (Fig. S1 a). In 
silico analysis predicted the mutation to be damaging (SIFT, 1.0; 
Polyphen2, 0.99; Mutation Taster, >0.99). This germline muta-
tion has not been reported before (GnomAD, ExAC, dbSNP), but 
two instances of the same mutation arising as a somatic variant 
in brain tumors have been reported (Fukumura et al., 2016). 
Consistent with our findings, this somatic variant was reported 
to confer gain of function. Thus, we report a novel syndrome of 
combined immune deficiency arising from germline gain-of-
function IKB 
KB mutations.
Flow cytometric analysis showed that IKK2 protein was ex-
pressed at similar levels in patient and control lymphocytes (Fig. 
S1 b). We proceeded to analysis of the mutant allele. First, we 
cloned mutant and WT alleles and expressed them in HEK293 
cells. After stimulation with TNF, we observed increased and pro-
longed IκBα phosphorylation, despite similar levels of WT and 
mutant allele IKK2 expression (Fig. 1 g). Similarly, we observed 
increased IκBα phosphorylation at baseline and after activation 
of PBMCs obtained from the proband (Fig. S1, c and d).
IKK2 activates the canonical NF-κB pathway. We examined 
the effect of the mutation by assessing abundance of phosphor-
ylated p65 in fibroblasts, T and B cells at rest, and after activation 
(Fig. 1, h and i; and Fig. S2 a). As had been observed for the proxi-
mal event (phospho-IκBα), we observed increased phospho-p65, 
particularly in the T cell compartment, and an increase in abun-
dance of phospho-p65 after activation out to 60 min (Fig. 1 h). 
Non-stimulated B cells from the patient showed increased phos-
phorylation of NF-κB to a level similar to that in CD40-stimulated 
control B cells (Fig. S2, b and c), with an enhanced response to 
PMA plus ionomycin and CD40 ligand plus IL-4 (Fig. S2, d and e).
We also assessed the transcriptional consequences of en-
hanced NF-κB activation. First, dendritic cells were induced in 
vitro from monocyte precursors. NF-κB2 is under transcriptional 
control by canonical NF-κB signaling, and while baseline expres-
sion was similar in patient and control, we observed an increase 
in patient cells after activation in vitro with TNF (Fig. S1, e and f). 
To demonstrate transcriptional regulation, we transfected fibro-
blasts isolated from patient and a healthy control with a construct 
containing NF-κB–dependent luciferase. We observed a modest 
increase in NF-κB–dependent transcription in the absence of 
stimulation and a significant increase relative to control after 
activation (Fig. 1 i). We performed a similar analysis after tran-
sient transfection of HEK293T cells with either WT, IKB 
KBV203I, 
IKB 
KBR272X (a known hypomorphic allele), or IKB 
KBK171E (a 
known gain-of-function allele; Fig. 1 j; Kataoka et al., 2015). Even 
in the absence of stimulation, IKB 
KBV203I resulted in enhanced

luciferase activity compared to the WT allele, and this response 
was enhanced after TNF stimulation.
Probands in both kindreds exhibited deficiencies of CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells, with a significant reduction in naive T cells in both 
compartments (Fig. 2, a and b; naive CD4+ T cells, A.II.2: 4.19%; 
B.II.2: 17.4%. Naive CD8+ T cells, A.II.2: 4.93%; B.II.2: 6.9%). In-
deed, this deficiency was observed in both αβ and γδ T cells (data 
not shown). We also observed a significant increase in circulat-
ing follicular helper T cells (Tfh cells; Fig. 2, c and d). Consistent 
with an effector memory T cell (TEM)/TEM CD45RA+ cell (TEMRA) 
phenotype, patient CD8+ T cells showed increased expression of 
CD107a, a degranulation marker (Fig. S2 f).
The probands were also found to exhibit a significant de-
ficiency of memory B cells (Freiburg class Ib), defined ei-
ther as CD19+IgD−CD27+ (Fig. 2, e and f; and Table S1) or 
CD19+CD38loCD24hi lymphocytes (Fig. S2 g). Transitional B cells 
were numerically normal, but were universally CD21hiCD10+ 
(Fig. S2 h). Analysis of IgD+CD19+ B cells revealed a relatively low 
level of IgM expression, a phenotype often observed as a result 
of a reduced threshold of B cell receptor activation (Fig. S2 i). We 
observed a modest reduction in CD86 induction by both naive 
and memory B cells after activation with bacteria cytidine-phos-
phate-guanosine (CpG), while induction of CD25, CD83, and 
CD69 was normal (data not shown). B cells failed to proliferate 
normally and exhibited a defect in immunoglobulin production 
after CD40 or CpG stimulation (Fig. 2, g and h).
We purified naive and memory T cells and assessed their 
responses to activation in vitro. We observed similar prolifera-
tion responses by memory T cells (CD45RO+) from proband and 
controls (Fig. 3 a). In contrast, activation of naive CD4+ T cells 
from the proband responded with greater proliferation relative 
to those from unrelated healthy controls. Activation of naive cells 
was accompanied by increased expression of markers of activa-
tion CD25 and CD69 (Fig. 3, a and b). To confirm the enhanced 
proliferative response in cells from the proband, we stimulated 
cells with CD3 only (rather than CD2, CD3, and CD28), which nor-
mally induces only a small proportion of cells to enter cycle, and 
observed a substantial proliferative response in cells from the

proband, but not in controls (Fig. 3 c). In these proliferation as-
says, although we observed an enhanced proliferative response, 
there were far fewer cells present in cultures at time of analysis, 
consistent with substantial cell death.
We also observed a significant increase in circulating regu-
latory T cells (T reg cells) in A.II.2, but not in B.II.2, defined as 
CD25+CD127− and FOXP3+, and effector T reg cells, defined as 
CD45RA−, FOXP3+CD25+, and CD127− (Fig. 3, d and e). Interest-
ingly, we also observed an increase in FOXP3 expression per cell, 
which was evident within T reg cells and also in the otherwise 
low-level FOXP3 expression in CD4+ T cells considered to be con-
ventional T cells by surface phenotype (Fig. 3, f and g).
IKK2V203 is highly conserved across species and in similar pro-
teins (Fig. 1 d and Fig. S1 a), so to investigate the action of this 
novel germline mutation in vivo, and to confirm its causal action 
in immune dysregulation, we engineered a G-to-A transversion 
in codon 203 of mouse Ikbkb using CRI 
SPR/Cas9 (Fig. 4 a). The 
mutant allele was propagated, and heterozygous and homozy-
gous mice were born at expected Mendelian ratios.
Analysis of isolated splenocytes revealed constitutive IκBα 
phosphorylation, with evidence of a gene dose effect: phos-
phorylation was greater in cells with homozygous mutation 
compared with heterozygotes, both at baseline (Fig. 4 b) and for 
at least 120 min after stimulation (Fig. 4, c and d). This result, 
taken together with transfection results, and analysis of cells 
from the proband, confirms that the p.V2013>I mutation con-
fers gain of function on IKK2. These findings are consistent with 
previous reported results for the same mutation identified as a 
somatic mutation in patients with central nervous system B cell 
lymphoma, where gain of function was demonstrated biochem-
ically (Fukumura et al., 2016).
As characterized in the proband, we observed that mice het-
erozygous and homozygous for IkbkbV203I exhibited a relative 
deficiency of T cells (Fig. 4, e and f). T cells were reduced as a

proportion of splenocytes. We also observed a reduction in ab-
solute number of T cells within spleens of affected mice, and a 
reduction in absolute numbers of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 
S3), consistent with the human phenotype. In mice, we observed 
greater reduction in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4 g).
In humans, we observed specific deficiency of naive T cells. In 
mice, effector T cells are marked by expression of CD44 and ab-
sence of CD62L. This subset was increased in both CD4 and CD8 
compartments, again with evidence of a gene dose effect (Fig. 4, 
h and i). We also observed a significant increase in T cell activa-
tion, indicated by up-regulation of CD69 in both CD4 and CD8 
compartments (Fig. S3, c and d). This bias toward activation was 
a fixed phenotype, observed in both young and old mice (Fig. S3, 
e and f). The proband exhibited an increase in circulating T reg 
cells. In mutant mice, we found an increase in T reg cells defined 
either according to CD25+ surface phenotype or Foxp3 expression 
(Fig. 4, j and k). A similar increase in T reg cells was observed 
within thymus of mutant mice, suggesting that the defect arises 
during T reg cell development (Fig. 4 l).
We have identified a novel germline IKB 
KB allele in patients 
with a clinical phenotype of cellular abnormalities of lymphope-
nia combined with immune activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells. In addition, one patient presented with inflammatory dis-
ease and possible ectodermal defect. High evolutionary conser-
vation of the affected codon within IKB 
KB provided us with an 
opportunity to generate an accurate mouse model of this novel 
syndrome, which we generated using CRI 
SPR/Cas9 so that they 
carry the same amino acid substitution in IKK2 identified in our 
patient. Phenotypic analysis revealed close phenotypic similar-
ities between mouse and humans carrying the mutant protein, 
with phenotypes in heterozygotes intermediate between normal 
and homozygotes, providing strong support for the contention 
that the novel mutation is responsible for a novel syndrome of 
immune deficiency (Table 1).
In both human and mouse, we observed pathological immune 
activation, but this finding needs to be reconciled with clinical 
manifestation of mild immune deficiency. One possible explana-
tion is the increase in thymic T reg cells, observed in the mouse 
model, and increased FOXP3 expression in the proband. FOXP3 
expression is known to be regulated by canonical NF-κB signaling 
(Isomura et al., 2009; Long et al., 2009). Furthermore, in loss-of-
function defects of canonical NF-κB signaling, concurrent defects 
in both conventional T cells and T reg cells have been observed, 
which result in at least partial maintenance of homeostasis be-

cause deficiencies of T reg cells are offset by defects in conven-
tional T cell activation conferred by the same mutation (Altin 
et al., 2011). Patient B.II.1, however, had a late-onset combined 
immunodeficiency alone and presented with normal T reg cells.
Now that de novo mutations have emerged as important 
causes of sporadic disease, it is necessary to have methods to 
confirm causation of novel variants. Our results reveal that 
even when novel mutations are isolated to a single individual 
as a result of a de novo mutation, confirmation of function 
can be confirmed by engineering an orthologous mutation to 
generate a precise model. This is particularly feasible for im-
munological diseases, because immunity is highly conserved 
between mouse and human. In the future, this strategy should 
prove important for investigating therapeutic interventions for 
personalized therapy.
Our discovery provides another example of a heterozygous 
missense mutation in an NF-κB pathway gene that presents with 
less catastrophic phenotypes than homozygous defects in the 
same genes. Indeed, given the complex circuits of negative and 
positive regulatory interactions within NF-κB signaling, cellu-
lar, biochemical, and clinical manifestations of specific defects 
are not always predictable, and complete gene deletions arising 
spontaneously from nonsense mediated decay or by homologous 
recombination in mice do not necessarily predict the actions of 
single–amino acid substitutions. Previously, rare homozygous 
mutations of IKB 
KB have been reported that result in absence 
of protein expression and confer severe early onset immune 
deficiency, in which the cellular phenotype was the opposite of 
that conferred by the hypermorphic allele reported here, with 
expansion of naive T cells, which were refractory to activation,

and therefore, there was minimal differentiation of memory or 
effector T cells. These individuals also exhibit a deficiency of T 
reg cells (Pannicke et al., 2013; Mousallem et al., 2014). Despite 
the divergence of cellular phenotypes, we can now conclude 
that both loss-of-function and hypermorphic alleles of IKB 
KB 
confer immune deficiency. Similar effects of mutations confer-
ring different biochemical functions have been observed with 
other genes (Minegishi et al., 2007; Boisson-Dupuis et al., 2012; 
Haapaniemi et al., 2015). Finally, the relatively mild nature of the 
phenotype in the patient described here also serves to emphasize 
that monogenic causes should be considered not only in patients 
with extreme phenotypes. The corollary is that by elucidating 
Mendelian versions of less severe phenotypes, we can start to 
gain insights into the mechanisms of common disease.
Materials and methods
Enrollments and approvals
The family described in this study is part of a larger cohort of 
primary antibody deficiency kindreds enrolled and recruited 
through the Australian and New Zealand Antibody Deficiency 
Allele Study. This study has been approved by human research 
ethics committees at Australian Capital Territory Health and 
Australian National University. A Japanese patient was identi-
fied from a cohort of Japanese primary immunodeficiency dis-
ease. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tokyo 
Medical and Dental University. All subjects provided written 
informed consent to participate, in accordance with the Decla-
ration of Helsinki. All animal experiments were approved from 
the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of Australian National 
University in agreement with the code of practice from the Na-
tional Health and Medical Research Council in Australia.
Flow cytometry and antibodies
The following antibodies were used for human cell analysis: CD19 
(SJ25C1), CD27 (L128), CD38 (HB7), CD3 (HIT3A), CD4 (SK3), CD8 
(SK1), CCR7 (3D12), CXCR5 (RF8B2), CD24 (ML5), CD69 (FN50), 
ΥδTCR, and αβTCR (from BD Biosciences); CD45RA (HI100), CD10 
(H110a), CD21 (BU32), and CD45RO (UCH 
LI; from BioLegend); 
CD86 (from Miltenyi Biotec); anti-IgM (from Dako); anti-IgD 
(IAG-2), CD25 Foxp3 (2A3), and phospho-p65 (B33B4WP; from 
eBioscience); and FOXP3 (259D/C7; from BD Biosciences). The 
following antibodies were used for mouse flow cytometry anal-
ysis: B220 (RA3/6B2), FOXP3 (MF23), and CD127 (A7R34; from 
eBioscience); and CD3 (17A2), CD4 (RM4-5, GK1.5), CD8 (53/6.7), 
CD44 (IM7), CD62L (MEL-14), and CD25 (PC61; from BioLegend).
Human PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifu-
gation on Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare), washed twice in 
PBS, and maintained in complete RPMI (Sigma-Aldrich) contain-
ing 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 U/ml 
penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). For mouse studies, 
spleens and thymuses were disrupted to generate single-cell sus-
pensions in RPMI/FCS. For human primary fibroblasts, cells were 
suspended at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in DMEM with 10% FBS.
For surface staining, PBMCs, sorted cells, or mouse cell sus-
pensions were washed with PBS containing 5% FBS (FACS buf-
fer) and then incubated for 20 min at 4°C in dark in FACS buffer 
containing appropriate fluorochrome-labeled antibodies. Each 
antibody labeling experiment included an Fc-blocking step 
 
(anti-CD16/CD32). Intracellular staining was performed accord-
ing to standard protocols. Cells were fixed (Fixing Buffer; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) and then permeabilized with Perm Buffer III 
according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences).
Proliferation assay
Naive and memory CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were bead sorted 
(Miltenyi Biotec), and enriched CD4+ or CD8+ cells or PBMCs 
were cultured with anti-CD3/CD28 expansion beads (Miltenyi 
Biotec) for 4 or 6 d. Proliferation of cells was then analyzed using 
Cell Trace Violet Cell Proliferation kit (Invitrogen) according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions.
For CFSE experiments, PBMCs were labeled with 3 µM 
CFSE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 5 min at room tempera-
ture. CFSE-labeled cells were plated at 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells/ml in 
triplicate (200 µl/well) in 96-well flat-bottom plates and left 
unstimulated or stimulated for 7 d with CD40L (1 µg/ml) and 
CpG (1 µg/ml) for B cell proliferation assay. After staining with 
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, CFSE dilution peaks of 
CD19+ B cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as a measure 
of cell division.
CD107a expression analysis
PBMCs were stimulated with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (1 µg/
ml) or anti-CD3/CD28 beads in the presence of PE-anti-CD107a 
(BD Biosciences) and monensin (1 µg/ml) for 6 h and stained for 
CD8. Cells were analyzed using flow cytometry.
In vitro immunoglobulin production and secretion
PBMCs were stimulated with mitogens (IL-21, 10 ng/ml; CD40L, 
2 µg/ml; CpG, 1 µg/ml), and cultured for 11 d. Immunoglobulin 
levels were evaluated by in-house ELI 
SA assay.
Luciferase assay
Fibroblasts from a healthy control and the patient were trans-
fected with 5 µg NF-κB–dependent firefly luciferase reporter 
plasmid (pNiFty-Luc) and 0.1 µg of Renilla Luciferase plasmid 
(pRLC). 20 h after transfection, a portion of the cells were stim-
ulated with 5 ng/ml IL-1B for 4 h. Relative NF-κB activation was 
measured using Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) 
and Glomax plate reader (Promega), and it was calculated by 
normalizing the relative ratio of firefly to Renilla.
Also, the pFN21A expression vector containing WT or mutant 
IKB 
KB, together with Igkcona-Luc (provided by S. Yamaoka, 
Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan) and pRL-TK 
(Promega), were transfected into the HEK293T cells. At 24 h after 
transfection, the cells were treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 4 h 
and subjected to luciferase reporter assay. The luciferase assays 
were performed as described above.
Genotyping and Sanger sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated either from saliva using Oragene-DNA 
OG-500 kit (DNAgenoTek) or from blood using the QIAamp DNA 
Blood kit (QIA 
GEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Genomic DNA was then amplified with primers via a thermocy-

cler. The presence of candidate mutations was then confirmed 
by Sanger sequencing using Big Dye Terminator v1.1 Sequenc-
ing kit (Applied Biosystems), and the amplimers were sent to 
Biomolecular Resource Facility (Australian National University, 
Canberra, Australia) to be analyzed by 3730 DNA Analyzer (Ap-
plied Biosystems). 
Whole exome capture sequencing
For whole exome sequencing, input DNA was extracted from 
whole blood, analyzed for integrity, and then fragmented by 
nebulization. DNA library preparation was performed with the 
Illumina paired-end sample prep kit (Illumina) and followed by 
exome enrichment (TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit; Illumina). 
Libraries were sequenced as paired-end reads (100-bp runs) on 
an Illumina HiSeq 2500.
Analysis comprised alignment of sequences to the human ref-
erence sequence GRCh37, using a Burrows-Wheeler aligner (Li 
and Durbin, 2009). Raw single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were 
called against the reference with SAMTools (Li et al., 2009). Com-
mon exome variants and deep SNVs were excluded, and coding 
and splicing variants were captured by alignment with the En-
sembl Exomic database. Non-synonymous substitutions were fil-
tered using ANN 
OVAR. For novel SNVs, prediction of functional 
effect were done using SIFT (Kumar et al., 2009), PolyPhen-2 
(Adzhubei et al., 2010), and Mutation Taster (Schwarz et al., 
2014). Filtering of variants for novelty was performed accord-
ing to the sum of scores for mouse mutant phenotype in the ho-
mologous mouse gene, Mendelian disease associations (OMIM), 
pathway analysis (gene ontology), immune system expression 
(Immgen), and PolyPhen-2 score. After filtering and ranking 
variants, heterozygous IKB 
KB variant was investigated further.
Whole exome sequencing data were deposited in the Sequence 
Read Archive website, accession ID SAMN10107916.
Gene expression
Mutant and WT IKB 
KB mammalian expression constructs pcDNA 
3.1(−)/myc-His were obtained from Biomatik, and pFN21A ex-
pression vector containing IKB 
KB was purchased from the 
Promega corporation. The WT and mutant vectors were trans-
fected into HEK293 with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and then 
incubated for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2. Transfectants were stim-
ulated with TNF-α for indicated time.
Western blot
Total protein was extracted from cell line, PBMCs, or mouse 
spleen cells using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer with 
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and a Halt phosphatase in-
hibitor (Pierce Net). 25 µg of protein was loaded on a 10% Bolt 
Bis-Tris PLUS gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After separation, 
proteins were wet-blotted on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane 
(Bio Rad). Blots were performed with antibodies to phospho-IκBα 
(Cell Signaling), total IκBα (Cell Signaling), phospho-P100 (Cell 
Signaling), B-actin (Cell Signaling), and GAP 
DH (Abcam). Horse-
radish peroxide–conjugated secondary antibodies were detected 
with Amersham ELC Western blotting system (GE Healthcare); 
band intensity was quantitated with Fujifilm multigauge soft-
ware and normalized to a loading control.

SPR/Cas9 mouse construction
Single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design and cloning
For SpCas9 editing, two sgRNAs were designed to ensure a pro-
tospacer adjacent motif sequence as close as possible to the de-
sired nucleotide change and to ensure Cas9 endonuclease would 
generate a double strand break close to the nucleotide of interest, 
yielding the following sgRNAs: guide 1, 5′-CTC

was Topo TA–cloned into a pCR2.1TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), and the cloned fragments were Ampicillin-selected 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The vector was 
transformed into Escherichia coli (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Mouse husbandry and zygotes microinjection
C57BL6/Ncrl and Swiss Webster CFW/crl recipient mice (Charles 
River) were maintained at the Australian Phenomics Facility 
under specific pathogen–free conditions. 5-wk-old C57BL/6Ncrl 
females were superovulated then mated with 20-wk-old 
C57BL/6Ncrl stud males. Fertilized zygotes were collected 
from the oviduct and maintained under M16 medium (M7292; 
Sigma-Aldrich) overlaid with mineral oil. A mix of 50 ng/µl 
of SpCas9 protein (PNA Bio), Ikbk

were coinjected into the mouse zygotes. Pronuclear injections 
were performed in a M2 medium (M7167; Sigma-Aldrich) over-
laid with mineral oil under a DMi8 (Leica) inverted microscope 
apparatus associated with mechanical micromanipulators and a 
microinjection apparatus. Microinjected zygotes were cultured 
overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator and then surgically 
transferred at two-cell stage into the ampulla of CFW/crl pseu-
do-pregnant females.
Genotyping
DNA extraction was performed on ear punches lysed in Tris-EDTA-
Tween lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 0.125 mM EDTA, and 
2% Tween 20, plus proteinase K) and incubated at 56°C for 1 h 
before the DNA was denatured at 95°C for 10 min. Genotyping 
primers were as follows: SF, 5′-TTC

tralian National University.
Protein structure
The structure data of the human IKK2 protein (PDB code: 4KIK) 
was used. The structures of the mutants, p.K171E and p.V203I, of 
IKK2 protein were built with the Molecular Operating Environ-
ment software (2013.08; Chemical Computing Group Inc.), and 
the structural figures were prepared.
Statistical analysis
Student’s t test, ANO 
VA, and χ2 tests were used to determine the 
statistical significance, which was set at the 95% confidence level.
