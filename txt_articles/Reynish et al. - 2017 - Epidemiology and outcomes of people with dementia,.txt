admissions

Abstract
Background: Cognitive impairment of various kinds is common in older people admitted to hospital, but previous
research has usually focused on single conditions in highly-selected groups and has rarely examined associations
with outcomes. This study examined prevalence and outcomes of cognitive impairment in a large unselected
cohort of people aged 65+ with an emergency medical admission.
Methods: Between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2013, admissions to a single general hospital acute medical unit
aged 65+ underwent a structured specialist nurse assessment (n = 10,014). We defined ‘cognitive spectrum disorder’
(CSD) as any combination of delirium, known dementia, or Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) score < 8/10. Routine
data for length of stay (LOS), mortality, and readmission were linked to examine associations with outcomes.
Results: A CSD was present in 38.5% of all patients admitted aged over 65, and in more than half of those aged
over 85. Overall, 16.7% of older people admitted had delirium alone, 7.9% delirium superimposed on known
dementia, 9.4% known dementia alone, and 4.5% unspecified cognitive impairment (AMT score < 8/10, no delirium,
no known dementia). Of those with known dementia, 45.8% had delirium superimposed. Outcomes were worse in
those with CSD compared to those without – LOS 25.0 vs. 11.8 days, 30-day mortality 13.6% vs. 9.0%, 1-year
mortality 40.0% vs. 26.0%, 1-year death or readmission 62.4% vs. 51.5% (all P < 0.01). There was relatively little
difference by CSD type, although people with delirium superimposed on dementia had the longest LOS, and
people with dementia the worst mortality at 1 year.
Conclusions: CSD is common in older inpatients and associated with considerably worse outcomes, with little
variation between different types of CSD. Healthcare systems should systematically identify and develop care
pathways for older people with CSD admitted as medical emergencies, and avoid only focusing on condition-
specific pathways such as those for dementia or delirium alone.

 Background
Ageing populations mean that health and social care sys-
tems internationally are increasingly stressed by large in-
creases in the number of multi-morbid and frail people
needing care who fit badly in systems designed to man-
age single conditions. People with dementia and other
disorders resulting in confusion are an important subset
of frail older people who present specific challenges, par-
ticularly when admitted to acute hospitals. In 2001, the
UK Department of Health [1] estimated that two-thirds
of hospital beds were occupied by patients aged over 65
years, up to half of whom might have some kind of cog-
nitive impairment, including dementia and delirium [2].
In the US, people with cognitive impairment have more
than three times as many hospital stays as individuals
who are hospitalised for some other condition [3, 4].
Further, inpatient costs were found to be higher for both
Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease and
other dementias than for other Medicare beneficiaries
and for inpatients with delirium compared to those
without [5, 6].
In the hospital setting, cognitive impairment may be
due to a number of overlapping conditions. People may
have pre-existing dementia before admission, may de-
velop delirium (characterised by an acute onset of confu-
sion, a fluctuating course and inattention) as part of the
acute illness precipitating admission, or may have delir-
ium superimposed on dementia. Finally, unspecified cog-
nitive impairment due to undiagnosed dementia or
delirium, adverse effects of medication, poorly controlled
physical morbidities (e.g. diabetes) or a combination of
these is also common. The symptoms and presenting
features of all these conditions show considerable over-
lap, which can lead to misdiagnosis; for example, the on-
set of neuropsychiatric symptoms in a patient with
dementia may be labelled as worsening of their dementia
rather than properly attributed to delirium. We therefore
use the term ‘cognitive spectrum disorders’ (CSD) to sig-
nify the presence of cognitive impairment whether for-
mally diagnosed or not.
Older people admitted to hospital with a CSD are a
heterogeneous and highly vulnerable population who are
typically poorly assessed and managed, and it is import-
ant to better understand their needs in order to focus
care and treatment. However, most research in older
people admitted to hospital has studied either dementia
or delirium in isolation, and is most commonly done on
relatively small cohorts of selected volunteers in special-
ist geriatric settings, risking selection bias and poor gen-
eralisability.
Relatively
few
studies
have
examined
outcomes in this population, particularly outcomes after
discharge. Systematic reviews which separately examined
dementia [7], delirium [8, 9] and delirium superimposed
on
dementia
[4]
in
hospital
inpatients
have
been
published. Findings show the estimated prevalence in
hospital inpatients varied from 9% to 63% for dementia
[7], 10% to 31% for delirium [8], and 32% to 89% for de-
mentia with superimposed delirium [10]. The estimated
prevalence of cognitive impairment of any cause varied
from 21% [11] to 40% [12]. Prevalence varied depending
on the population studied (e.g. specialist settings vs. un-
selected medical admissions; early vs. later assessment
after admission, age range considered) and the assess-
ment methods used, with dementia assessment not nor-
mally including a delirium screen increasing the risk of
misclassification.
The dementia review [7] included studies showing sig-
nificant associations with increased length of stay (LOS),
functional decline and discharge to institutional care,
but there was no association with increased mortality in
the one study examining this [13], and no study exam-
ined readmission [7]. A prospective cohort study per-
formed after the review found that people with dementia
had an increased risk of in-hospital death (adjusted HR
2.09, 95% CI 1.10–4.00) [14]. The delirium review found
an increased risk of death at mean follow-up of 22.7
months (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.51–2.52) [8]. More recently,
studies of delirium superimposed on dementia have ex-
amined outcome. A number of these have suggested an
association with higher mortality [15, 16]. Few studies of
cognitive impairment in general reported associations
with outcomes, but more severe cognitive impairment
on admission was associated with both increased institu-
tionalisation [17, 18] and mortality [18].
Unlike most previous research in selected volunteers,
this study is based on structured assessment of all CSDs
(dementia, delirium and cognitive impairment) in a large
unselected population of people aged ≥ 65 years admit-
ted as an acute medical emergency, with an assessment
completed in 10,014 (79.0%) of admissions. The object-
ive of this study was therefore to examine the relative
frequencies and the associated outcomes of people with
the full range of CSDs in a large, unselected population
of older people admitted as an acute medical emergency.
Methods
The design is a prospective cohort study of all people
aged 65 years and over with an acute medical admission
to one district general hospital in the Fife region of
Scotland, with complete 1 year follow-up. This study
reports data for all older people admitted to the acute
medical unit (AMU) between January 2012 and June
2013 inclusive.
NHS Fife provides acute medical care from a single
640-bedded district general hospital to a diverse urban
and rural population of ~360,000. Fife has an ageing
population and has seen a 76% rise in emergency admis-
sions of people aged 65 and over during the last 10
Reynish et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:140 
Page 2 of 12
 years. The population of Fife accounts for 7% of the
population of Scotland and its acute healthcare system
comprises the acute hospital in addition to four non-
acute community hospitals. There is no other inpatient
healthcare provision in Fife. In the period of the study,
all emergency medical admissions from any source were
admitted via a single AMU with subsequent discharge or
step-down to appropriate medical wards after 12–24
hours. Medical admissions are unselected with exception
to acute stroke and acute ST elevation myocardial in-
farction. Operative orthopaedic trauma patients are
admitted via the Surgical Admissions Unit and all non-
operative trauma patients are admitted via the Medical
Admissions Unit. At the time of censoring, the Hospital
at Home service was not yet operational and therefore
alternatives to admission were not available.
Starting in 2009 and funded by the Scottish Government
Joint Improvement Team, the NHS Fife Dementia Co-
ordinating Group designed and implemented the Older
Persons Routine Acute Assessment (OPRAA). OPRAA is
based on the principles of “comprehensive geriatric assess-
ment” [19], with trained specialist nurses carrying out a
structured assessment during the first 24 hours of admis-
sion, including an Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) [20],
the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) [21] for the
presence of delirium, an assessment of the presence of de-
lirium based on clinical history, examination and informant
report, and documentation of the presence of a pre-
admission diagnosis of dementia from self/informant re-
port and/or hospital and primary care records. By design,
individuals with a predicted LOS less than 24 hours, where
death was expected, or with an acute illness requiring crit-
ical care intervention do not undergo an OPRAA.
All specialist nurses carrying out the assessment
underwent a structured training programme for the use
of these tools, delivered by a specialist mental health
nurse and an occupational therapist. For the CAM, the
specialist nurses underwent training in its use as set out
in the training manual for CAM that was available in
2009. In addition to this, the findings of the paper by
Inouye et al. [22], namely that nurses who based assess-
ment of delirium on routine clinical observations “often
missed delirium when present, but rarely identified delir-
ium when absent” and that “Recognition of delirium can
be enhanced with education of nurses in delirium fea-
tures, cognitive assessment, and factors associated with
poor recognition”, were taken into account and all nurses
had training in cognitive assessment and in the features
of delirium. Specialist nurse training began in autumn
2008, with initial implementation of OPRAA commen-
cing in January 2009, meaning that, by the time of col-
lection of the data analysed (January 2012 to June 2013),
evaluation was being routinely performed by very experi-
enced staff.
All people aged 65 years and older admitted to the
AMU were identified from Scottish Morbidity Records
01 (SMR01) data, which is a validated NHS Scotland
routine dataset including age, sex, date of admission and
discharge, type of admission, and whether the patient
was admitted from a residential care or nursing home.
The SMR01 dataset was then linked to the Community
Health Index (CHI – the NHS Scotland patient register),
the OPRAA dataset, SMR04 data on psychiatric admis-
sions, CHI national mortality data and community dis-
pensed prescribing data, resulting in a linked dataset of
all admissions between January 2012 and June 2013 in-
clusive, with at least 1 year of follow-up data for LOS,
death and re-admission. OPRAA was used to define the
presence of a CSD, defined as one or more of known de-
mentia diagnosed before admission, delirium and un-
specified cognitive impairment. Dementia was defined as
a reported dementia diagnosis in the OPRAA assess-
ment, a prior community prescription of drugs for de-
mentia (anticholinesterase inhibitors or memantine), or
a prior dementia diagnosis recorded in SMR01 or
SMR04. Delirium was defined as both full syndromic de-
lirium (a positive score on the CAM) or a clinical diag-
nosis
of
delirium
made
by
the
specialist
nurses.
Outcomes were defined as inpatient LOS, death within 30
days and 1 year after admission, and a composite of death
or readmission within 30 days or 1 year from discharge
(competing risks mean that we did not examine readmis-
sion alone, since those who die cannot be readmitted and
post-discharge mortality varies between groups).
Data linkage used the CHI number (the NHS Scotland
unique patient identifier) and was carried out by the
University of Dundee Health Informatics Centre (HIC).
HIC Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been
reviewed and approved by the NHS East of Scotland Re-
search Ethics Service, which does not require review of
individual projects provided they follow SOPs and obtain
Caldicott permission to use the data. This project used
HIC SOPs and consent for research using this data was
obtained from the NHS Fife Caldicott Guardian, based
on researcher access only to anonymised data held in
the HIC ISO27001 and Scottish Government accredited
safe haven [23, 24].
Data for all admissions over the 18 month period of
January 2012 to June 2013 were included in the study.
Characteristics of patients at the time of admission were
defined as described above, for all admissions (admission
cohort) and for an incident cohort of patients admitted
(defined as being the first admission for an individual in
the study period where there had not been a previous
admission in the prior 6 months).
Comparative descriptive statistics based on means and
proportions for patients with and without an OPRAA
assessment
were
calculated,

 intervals (CIs) for proportions or difference between two
proportions calculated based on Wilson’s method [25,
26]. Logistic regression (binary and multinomial) was
used to test for main and interaction effects of sex and
age on prevalence of CSDs. For the missing variables of
delirium and dementia, it was assumed that patients did
not have the condition, whereas for missing AMT
scores, it was assumed that patients did not have un-
specified cognitive impairment (low AMT) only in ab-
sence of known dementia or delirium. Data linkage and
analysis was carried out using SAS® 9.4 software (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
All admissions
Between January 2012 and June 2013, there were 12,673
admissions for 8374 individuals aged 65 years and over
to the AMU, accounting for 61% of all AMU admissions.
An OPRAA was completed in 10,014 (79%) admissions.
Of those patients who did not undergo an OPRAA as-
sessment (n = 1632), 1102 (67.52%) had a LOS ≤ 2 days,
and 59 patients (3.62%) died within 5 days. Admissions
where an OPRAA assessment was completed were for
patients who were on average 2.3 (95% CI 2.0–2.7) years
older than admissions without an OPRAA assessment,
more commonly for women (56.7% vs. 51.4%, difference
5.3%, 95% CI 3.2–7.4), more likely to be admissions from
a care home (8.0% vs. 5.8%, difference 2.1%, 95% CI 1.1–
3.1), and less likely to have a short LOS (31.4% staying
0–2 days vs. 66.6%, difference 35.2%, 95% CI 33.2–37.2).
The same patterns were present in the incident cohort
(Table 1).
One or more CSDs were present in 38.5% (95% CI
37.5–39.4) of admissions with an OPRAA assessment
(Table 1). A known diagnosis of dementia was present in
17.3% (95% CI 16.6–18.1) of admissions, and 24.6% (95%
CI 23.8–25.5) of admissions were for a person with delir-
ium. Delirium superimposed on dementia was present in
7.9% (95% CI 7.4–8.5) of admissions (45.8% of people
with known dementia had delirium; 32.3% of people
with delirium had known dementia). A further 4.5%
(95% CI 4.1–4.9) of admissions were for people with un-
specified cognitive impairment (AMT < 8 in the absence
of delirium or known dementia), most likely due to the
presence of undiagnosed dementia.
Incident cohort
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of CSDs in the incident
cohort (n = 7201) by age and sex (detailed data is in
Additional file 1: Table S1). Age was strongly associated
with the prevalence of any CSD (Wald χ2 P < 0.001), ris-
ing from 18.4% in people aged 65–69 to 51.2% in people
aged 85 years and over. After adjustment for age, CSD
prevalence was not significantly associated with sex
(Wald χ2 P = 0.776) and there was no evidence of an
age-sex interaction (Wald χ2 P = 0.572), indicating that
men and women share the same trend in CSD preva-
lence within the different age groups. Similar results
were found for underlying mutually exclusive conditions
(known dementia alone, delirium alone, delirium super-
imposed on known dementia and unspecified cognitive
impairment).
Outcome data in the incident cohort
Mean LOS in the incident cohort was 14.3 days (95% CI
13.6–15.0), and was longer in patients with a CSD (25.0
days, 95% CI 23.1–26.9) compared to those without
CSD (11.8 days, 95% CI 11.0–12.6) (Table 2). Patients
with delirium superimposed on dementia had signifi-
cantly longer LOS (34.3 days, 95% CI 28.5–31.2) than
those with dementia alone (20.1 days, 95% CI 16.9–23.3)
or delirium alone (23.0 days, 95% CI 20.3–25.6).
Mortality is reported from date of admission in Table 2,
but also from date of discharge combined with readmis-
sion in Table 3, in which just those individuals who are
discharged alive were considered.
Mortality in the entire incident cohort was high, with
9.9% (95% CI 9.2–10.9) dying within 30 days of admission
and rising to 29.0% (95% CI 28.0–30.1) at 1 year (Table 2).
Patients with a CSD had higher mortality at 30 days after
admission (13.6% vs. 9.0%, difference 4.6%, 95% CI 2.9–
6.4) and at 1 year (40.0% vs. 26.0%, difference 14.0%, 95%
CI 11.4–16.6). There was no clear pattern of varying mor-
tality across different CSDs, although patients with de-
mentia alone had significantly higher mortality at 1 year
than those with delirium alone (Table 2).
Table 3 shows the prevalence of death or readmission
after discharge alive following the incident admission. For
all patients in the incident cohort, death or readmission
occurred in 17.9% (95% CI 17.0–18.9) within 30 days of
discharge, rising to 53.0% (95% CI 51.8–54.2) at 1 year.
People with a CSD had significantly higher rates of death
or readmission at 30 days and 1 year after discharge com-
pared to those without (62.4% vs. 51.4%, difference 10.9%,
95% CI 8.0–13.8 at 1 year). Death or readmission by 30
days and 1 year after discharge showed no clear pattern
across different CSDs, although patients with dementia
alone had significantly higher mortality or readmission
than those with delirium alone at 1 year after discharge.
Overall, LOS, mortality and readmission were statisti-
cally and clinically significantly worse for admitted older
people with a CSD, but were high even for those with
normal cognition (Fig. 2).

 commonly delirium (in 24.6% of all admissions) either
on its own (16.7%) or superimposed on dementia (7.9%).
Known dementia was less common than delirium (17.3%
of all admissions) and almost half of admissions for
people with known dementia were complicated by
superimposed delirium. There were additionally 4.5% of
admissions where there was unspecified cognitive im-
pairment, in who many were likely to have undiagnosed
dementia and therefore warranted post-discharge follow-
up. As expected, the prevalence of CSD rose steeply with
age, and CSD of some kind was present in half of
admissions for patients aged 85 years and over. Older
people with CSD had significantly worse outcomes than
those without – mean LOS was 13.2 days longer, they
had higher mortality in the year after admission (40.0%
vs. 26.0%), and higher mortality or readmission in the
year after discharge (62.4% vs. 51.5%). All categories of
CSD were associated with poor outcomes, although LOS
was greatest in those with delirium superimposed on de-
mentia, and once discharged, patients with dementia
alone had a higher mortality/risk of readmission or
death than those with delirium alone.

 Strengths and weaknesses
The study’s strengths lie in the fact that it examines an
unselected population cohort of older people admitted
as a medical emergency to a single healthcare system
(one acute hospital and four non-acute hospitals) pro-
viding all such care to patients resident in its catchment
area, with complete follow-up of mortality and readmis-
sion outcomes using linked data from routine clinical
practice. Although it is difficult to be precise about the
generalisability of the findings, given the proportion of
the population covered (7% of the Scottish population),
the characteristics of the ageing population, and the
standard
mode of
emergency admission
into non-
specialised acute hospital care in the UK, parts of
Europe, North and South America, and Australasia, it is
assumed that, due to the large sample size and time period
covered, these findings will not be dissimilar to other parts
of the world where this healthcare system exists.
The study reports on the findings of a brief standar-
dised screening assessment of all emergency admissions.
Analysis is not restricted to specific types of cognitive
disorder, which is important given the overlaps and the

 poor outcomes observed across all CSD groups, and
therefore individual conditions such as dementia or de-
lirium are viewed in the context of all cognitive disorder
subtypes. Additionally, when discussing the strengths of
the work, the size of the population examined is notable.
By using routine data, the study included 12,673 emer-
gency medical admissions in 8374 patients, which is
more than the total patients in all studies included in
the most recent systematic reviews of dementia [7] and
delirium [8] in hospital inpatients.
The key limitations and possible sources of bias reflect
the use of routine healthcare data and the cross-
sectional nature of the OPRAA assessment. The OPRAA
assessment was introduced to support the initial multi-
disciplinary assessment and management of frail older
patients as part of a clinical service. This raises five areas
that require further discussion, namely (1) coverage, (2)
accuracy of brief assessment tools, (3) cross-sectional
nature of assessment, (4) lack of full dementia diagnostic
workup, and (5) differences between admission and inci-
dent cohorts.
(1)Coverage
By design, the OPRAA assessment was not
performed in patients with brief admissions to
exclude serious illness like myocardial infarction in
people with chest pain, or who required immediate
escalation to critical care, or who were admitted for
palliative care. OPRAA coverage was therefore 79.0%
of all admissions and 77.3% of incident admissions.
However, this compares favourably with most
consented research cohorts, including those with the
highest coverage, such as Sampson et al. [14], who
in their study of dementia prevalence screened
88.2% of people aged 70 years and older admitted
for at least 48 hours, and included 76.7% (617
patients in total) after exclusions. For comparison,
88.3% of all admissions of over 48 hours in those
aged above 70 were included in this analysis.
(2)Accuracy of brief assessment tools
OPRAA used relatively simple instruments suitable
for identifying delirium and cognitive impairment in
a routine clinical context, which may not always
match assessment using gold-standard research in-
struments, although OPRAA assessment was per-
formed by trained, experienced specialist nurses. The
sensitivities of the screening tools used in OPRAA
have been discussed in the literature.
Only 31% of people diagnosed with delirium in this
dataset were CAM positive. This contrasts with the
literature comparing CAM to a gold-standard assess-
ment of delirium, where CAM sensitivity ranges
from 46% to 100% [27]. This likely reflects the differ-
ence between assessments done by dedicated staff
during research studies and assessments like OPRAA
performed in routine clinical practice where high
workload and competing clinical demands constrain
when assessments can be done, making it difficult to
repeatedly return to perform an optimal assessment
(for example, with an informant present). During the
period of the study, the nurses applied the original
scoring for the CAM in terms of CAM positivity re-
quiring “an acute ‘and’ fluctuating course”, which the
CAM developers have since recognised is often diffi-
cult to assess when using the CAM in routine clin-
ical practice. The CAM manual was updated in 2014
to allow two methods of scoring this criteria [28]. It
states that the original scoring (‘and’) maximises spe-
cificity but reduces sensitivity in clinical use, and
suggests the use of “an acute ‘or’ fluctuating course”
to maximise sensitivity at the cost of specificity. In
addition, delirium by its nature is fluctuant, and
others have found that CAM positivity varies over
time in people with delirium, with, for example, 35%
of assessments being CAM negative in people with
hip fracture who were ever CAM positive [29]. As
implemented in this study, CAM would therefore be
expected to be highly specific but less sensitive,
which is consistent with the observed patterns, and
with the conclusion of a recent systematic review of
the CAM that “the use of these tools should not re-
place clinical judgement” [30].
Similar discussions are present for the AMT in the
literature. Initial reports of the accuracy of the AMT
in screening for cognitive impairment suggested
“The best cut-off point was 8, with less than 8 sug-
gesting abnormal cognitive function” [31]. A recent
systematic review and meta-analysis examined its ac-
curacy when used as an instrument to screen for de-
mentia [32, 33]. In this meta-analysis with a cut-off
of < 7, pooled analysis of the AMTs showed a sensi-
tivity of 81%, and a specificity of 84% for a diagnosis
of dementia. As noted in this paper a cut-off of < 8 is
considered more usual in clinical practice. In the
current study, we use a cut-off of < 8 to report un-
specified cognitive impairment.
(3)Cross-sectional nature of assessment
The OPRAA assessment was carried out within the
first 24 hours of admission, and therefore captures
prevalent cases of CSD at time of admission. Any
changes in patients’ cognitive status during the
course of admission are not captured in the study
design. For example, patients admitted to hospital
with no CSD or with known dementia alone may
develop incident delirium through the course of
their admission, and their outcomes will be
narrowing the divide between the CSD subgroups in
the reported analyses.
Reynish et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:140 
Page 8 of 12
 (4)Lack of full dementia diagnostic workup
Data on results of further diagnostic workups for
definitive diagnoses of dementia are not included.
As such, the categories of the CSDs are based on
the diagnoses that were known about at the time
of admission, i.e. known dementia, along with
diagnoses that can be attributed as a result of the
brief assessment. It is therefore most likely that
those patients with a low AMT (unspecified
cognitive impairment) are those with undiagnosed
dementia.
(5)Differences between admission and incident
cohorts
For analysis, two cohorts were examined. Within the
admission (prevalence) cohort each hospital episode
is featured and therefore an individual may be
counted a number of times with each readmission to
hospital. The incident cohort differs from the
admission cohort in that it identifies individuals at
the beginning of their interaction with acute
healthcare services and follows them through that
journey capturing all re-admissions and mortality.
Outcomes reported from this incident cohort are
applicable therefore to individual patients. Data from
the admissions (prevalence) cohort can be seen as
reporting the impact that this population has on the
acute hospital.
(6)Lack of adjustment for other factors
The analysis reported here is unadjusted for other
factors which may be associated with the outcomes,
including physical health, function and nutrition.
The OPRAA assessment did not include evaluation
of nutrition. It did include an assessment of
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and variation in
function may explain some of the observed
associations. This is an area that requires further
in-depth analysis since declines in ADL may re-
flect both physical and/or cognitive impairment,
making adjustment complicated, and any inter-
action between cognitive status and ADL may
vary with time.
Comparison with other studies
The estimated prevalence of dementia and delirium
varies widely in the literature, reflecting varying age
inclusion criteria in particular, and the specific diag-
nosis focused on and methods for its ascertainment.
Reported dementia prevalence ranges from 2.8% to
63.0% [7] and delirium prevalence from 10.0% to
31.0% [8], compared with this study which found a
prevalence of 17.3% for known dementia, 4.5% for
likely
undiagnosed
dementia
(low
AMT
with
no
known dementia and no delirium), and 24.6% for de-
lirium. In particular, the methodological differences of
age cut-off, minimum LOS plus subsequent diagnostic
workup account for the reported differences in preva-
lence when comparison is made with the paper by
Sampson et al. [14]. In Sampson’s cohort, patients re-
cruited were aged 70 or over and had to have a LOS
of 48 hours or more to be included. Their study also
followed up those patients with unspecified cognitive
impairment, who underwent a full dementia diagnos-
tic workup. Prior to this workup their prevalence rate
of known dementia was approximately 20%. When
compared with the current study, the prevalence of
known dementia (with and without delirium super-
imposed) in those patients aged 70 or over with a
LOS of over 2 days is 18.3%, which is in agreement
with the findings in the Sampson paper.
Additionally, the reporting of the prevalence of de-
lirium superimposed on dementia frequently uses the
population with known dementia as the reference
population. This is the case in the review by Fick et
al. [10], where the prevalence of delirium super-
imposed on dementia ranges from 22.0% to 89.0% of
older inpatients with dementia. Once again, our find-
ing of a prevalence of delirium of 45.8% of those with
known dementia (7.9% of all admissions) compares
favourably with previous findings.
Also worth noting is that most studies of dementia
prevalence exclude those with delirium, but in this study
almost one-third of those with delirium had known de-
mentia, emphasising that a single condition focus may
be misleading.
Only a limited number of previous studies have exam-
ined mortality or readmission, with some evidence of
higher mortality in people with dementia [32, 33], but
conflicting findings in other studies [13, 34]. Higher
mortality is reported for delirium [8, 9, 35–37], delirium
superimposed on dementia [10, 15, 38], and cognitive
impairment irrespective of cause [11]. A striking feature
of this study is that outcomes (LOS, mortality after
admission, and death or readmission after discharge)
are significantly worse in people with any CSD with
relatively little difference between different types of
CSD, although delirium superimposed on dementia was
associated with significantly longer LOS compared to
delirium or dementia alone, and dementia alone was
associated with significantly higher mortality compared
to delirium alone.
Implications of the study
This study shows that over one-third of emergency
medical admissions in people aged 65 years and over
will be for individuals with a CSD, who will stay in
hospital on average almost 2 weeks longer than
those without. Almost one in seven of those with
CSD will die in the 30 days after admission, and two
Reynish et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:140 
Page 9 of 12
 fifths will die in the year after admission. Of those
who survive to be discharged, one in five will die or
be readmitted within 30 days, and three in five
within a year. These findings are put in context in
Box 1.
The key implication is that healthcare systems have to
systematically identify and manage CSD in older people
admitted as medical emergencies, but avoid only focus-
ing on dementia or delirium alone. Additionally, those
with likely undiagnosed dementia (low AMT without
known dementia or delirium) need follow-up for diagno-
sis after the acute episode. Condition-specific care plans/
pathways such as those for dementia or delirium alone
risk missing the complexities of a person-centred ap-
proach to CSDs. There is good evidence of reduced
mortality and nursing home admission after discharge
from ‘comprehensive geriatric assessment’ of older in-
patients, which includes co-ordinated multidisciplinary
assessment, geriatric medicine expertise, a problem-
rather than a disease-focused approach [39], and the
creation and implementation of a longer-term man-
agement plan.
Future research implications
Further longitudinal research and analysis adjusting
for physical comorbidity and function is needed to
examine whether cognitive impairment is an inde-
pendent predictor of mortality or whether worse out-
come
is
mediated
by
physical
comorbidity,
by
functional status or frailty. The very high mortality
observed in people with CSD (40.0% by 1 year after
admission) requires further examination, since it is
likely a mixture of both unavoidable deaths and inad-
equate management of older people with cognitive
impairment (although it is also important to note that
mortality is also high in those without CSD – 26% by 1
year). Research is needed to identify how best to distin-
guish which older inpatients would be better served by
a palliative approach to care and which require the
same
high-intensity
diagnosis
and
management
as
younger people, and to develop and evaluate interven-
tions to ensure appropriate delivery of both.
Conclusions
Over one-third of admissions to hospital in the older
population have a CSD, and this is associated with
worse outcomes. Delirium is more common than de-
mentia in the acute hospital, but of those people with
known dementia, 46% had delirium superimposed.
There is significant overlap between all these condi-
tions with outcomes that are broadly similar across the
spectrum of disorders. Management pathways should
aim to be person focused and encompass the spectrum
of these disorders rather than condition specific. Fur-
ther research is needed to determine direct causal
relationships, predictors of decline and optimal care
pathways for this very common, vulnerable and com-
plex population.
Box 1 What this paper adds
What is already known on this subject
In the hospital setting, cognitive impairment may be due to a
number of overlapping conditions – people may have pre-
existing dementia, may have developed delirium, may have
delirium superimposed on dementia, or may have unspecified
cognitive impairment due to undiagnosed dementia, adverse
effects of medication, poorly controlled physical morbidities (e.g.
diabetes) or a combination of these.
Research to date in older people admitted to hospital has
studied the epidemiology and outcomes of these conditions in
isolation.
This study examines the relative frequencies and associated
outcomes of people with the full range of cognitive
spectrum disorders (CSDs) in a large, unselected population
of older people admitted as an acute medical emergency.
What this study adds
The results show that cognitive spectrum disorders (delirium,
dementia, delirium superimposed on dementia, or non-specified
cognitive impairment) affect over one-third of older acute medical
admissions and over a half of those over the age of 85 years.
Delirium is most common (24.6%) followed by known dementia (17.3%),
with 7.9% of those with dementia having delirium superimposed.
Patients with CSDs have an excess length of stay of 13.2 days,
have increased mortality (40.0% vs. 26.0% at 1 year after
admission), and increased risk of death or readmission once
discharged (59.4% vs. 49.4% at 1 year).
The key implication is that healthcare systems should
systematically identify and manage CSD in older people
admitted as medical emergencies, but avoid only focusing on
dementia or delirium alone. Additionally, they should ensure that
those with likely undiagnosed dementia (low Abbreviated Mental
Test score without known dementia or delirium) are followed up.
At practice level, this necessitates the design of care pathways for
patients with CSD as opposed to condition-specific manage-
ment. Further longitudinal research is needed to examine
whether cognitive impairment is an independent predictor of
mortality or whether worse outcome is mediated by physical
comorbidity, functional status, frailty or people with cognitive
impairment receiving less effective care
