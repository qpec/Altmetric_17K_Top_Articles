Abstract
Background: Body hair shafts from the beard, trunk, and extremities can be used to treat baldness when patients have inadequate amounts of scalp
donor hair, but reports in the literature concerning use of body hair to treat baldness are confined to case reports.
Objectives: This study aimed to assess the outcome of body hair transplanted to bald areas of the scalp in selected patients.
Methods: From 2005 through 2011, 122 patients preselected for adequate body hair had donor hair transplanted from the beard, trunk, and the ex-
tremities to the scalp by follicular unit extraction (FUE) by the author at a single center. All patients were emailed surveys to assess surgical outcomes and
overall satisfaction.
Results: Seventy-nine patients (64.8%) responded with a mean time of 2.9 years between date of last surgery and time of survey. Patients were general-
ly very satisfied with results of their procedure, giving mean scores of at least a 7.8 on a Likert-like scale of 0 to 10 for their healing status, hair growth in
recipient areas, and overall satisfaction with their surgeries. These scores were comparable to mean scores provided by patients whose transplants included
scalp donor sources.
Conclusions: FUE using body hair can be an effective hair transplantation method for a select patient population of hirsute individuals who suffer from
severe baldness or have inadequate scalp donor reserve.

It has been estimated that there are up to 12,500 hairs, or ap-
proximately 6000 follicular units consisting of 2 to 3 hairs,
that are pragmatically transplantable in the average standard
donor area (SDA) of the head, an area considered not at risk
for hair loss due to androgenic alopecia.1 However, individu-
als with severe baldness or severely depleted donor areas
from previous hair restoration procedures are not good can-
didates for traditional hair transplantation methods with hair
from the SDA. In these cases, body hair transplantation
(BHT), which refers to the use of beard and body hair donor
sources in the treatment of baldness, remains a viable option
in hirsute patients.1-7 In contrast, body hair restoration

 (BHR) describes use of head or body hair in areas of loss in
nonscalp areas (such as pubic or eyebrow hair restoration or
eyelashes).8-14 Body hair from the beard, trunk, and the ex-
tremities can be transplanted by follicular unit extraction
(FUE) methods and combined with head hair, if available, to
cover both scalp and nonscalp areas to improve severe bald-
ness,1 create more natural and softer hairlines,5 repair donor
strip scars from previous hair restoration surgeries,6 and
restore facial and body hair.8-13
Although the application of BHT to treat baldness is
promising, reports in the literature have been confined to
case reports.2-8,12,13 The objectives of the current article are
to present the author’s experience in a large series of pa-
tients who have undergone BHT using FUE, define suitable
candidates selected for the procedure, illustrate the use of
different donor and recipient areas, and provide information
on patient satisfaction with the procedure and outcomes.
METHODS
Study Design
The guidelines of the Department of Health and Human
Services Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects
were followed. No IRB approval was sought because this
was not a prospective or systematic investigation. Patients
were eligible to be included in the study if they were men
and had undergone BHT performed using FUE between
September 2005 and October 2011. Only beard hair (both
facial and anterior neck hair areas) was used for strip scar
repair. Body hair was combined with, when available, hair
from the head that also included the nape and periauricular
areas (NPA) of the scalp. Written informed consent was ob-
tained from patients prior to surgery, and the study was
conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Patient Selection and Considerations
Potential candidates for BHT have a relative or absolute
lack of traditional head donor hair to adequately address
their baldness. The main reasons for the lack of traditional
head donor hair for transplant are extensive baldness or
donor area depletion by prior surgeries. In general, finer
and shorter hairs from the leg are more appropriate for re-
storing or repairing the hairline and temple areas, while
coarser beard hair is more appropriate for imparting
density and for repair of surgical scars.5,7 The choice of
body hair graft source is in part influenced by the observa-
tion that body hair generally retains its characteristics when
transplanted to recipient head sites.2,6,8 For example, beard
hair is much coarser and can grow longer than finer,
shorter hair originating from the legs. The diameter of the
follicle, color, curliness, texture, growth rate, and shaft
angle must also be taken into consideration to best match
transplanted hair with the recipient hair site, bearing in
mind that combinations of hair from different areas of the
body can provide a more blended look and that some
sources of body hair, such as the beard, will lose pigment
faster over a long period of time.
A robust supply of good quality hair in the beard or
other body areas is essential. In the author’s experience,
terminal (nonvellous) hair and uniform average density

tory hair density demonstrated on this 40-year-old man.

satisfactory, but the lower abdominal areas indicated by the X

 spread of ≥8 per cm2 (Figure 1) is of good quality for trans-
plantation. Patchy areas of hair, regardless of location on
the body, are to be avoided. For example, Figure 2 shows a
patient’s abdomen in which the areas marked with an X
have densities less than 8 per cm2 compared with the
circled area, which shows a higher density and more
uniform hair spread. In practice, it is common to demarcate
areas from a specific body location area into viable vs non-
viable sources. Figure 3 shows an example in which the
legs have totally nonviable hair sources because of com-
plete hair loss in most areas; in those areas with hair, the
hair is vellous-looking and has an unsatisfactory density.
Another important preoperative consideration is the tar-
geting of anagen hair for extraction as these hairs are less
susceptible to damage during the extraction process.5 Two
methods were employed in these patients. The first is the
treatment of the identified donor areas with 5% minoxidil
once or twice daily between 6 weeks and 6 months prior to
surgery.5,7 This treatment is intended to shorten the telogen
phase by inducing follicles resting in the telogen phase to
begin the anagen phase,15 as well as lengthen the anagen
phase and increase hair caliber.16 About 7 to 10 days before
surgery for nonbeard BHT (or 2-3 days for beard BHT),
donor areas are shaved bare to identify late-phase anagen
hair,1,5-7,12,13 based on the phototrichogram method de-
scribed by Saitoh et al17 for anagen hair quantification.
Hair Transplantation Technique
Body hair transplantation was accomplished using FUE
techniques previously described.7 In general, approximately
1500 to 1800 grafts can be transplanted during an 8- to
9-hour operation day, divided into 2 blocks of time: graft ex-
traction and placement of grafts in their intended recipient
areas. Consequently, planning is required in terms of sched-
uling once the number of grafts required has been estimated.
Although back-to-back operational days can be scheduled
when required, patient availability and tolerance are factors
as is the target density issue for those patients at risk for scalp
necrosis in which hair density in a recipient area is built up
over a long period time (several sessions over 6-12 months).
A versatile orthopedic table that can accommodate
lateral tilt, normal and reverse Trendelenberg positions,
height adjustments, and head and neck maneuverability, at
a minimum, is recommended.7 A table with leg-splitting ca-
pabilities is also useful when leg hair extractions are to be
performed. Each session starts with the surgeon mapping
out the extraction and recipient areas and approximately
how many hair shafts will be extracted from each donor
area. If scalp hair is to be extracted in the session, this is
done first prior to any body hair extraction.

without tumescence. Graft extraction was done by use of a
hypodermic needle with a modified tip in which the cir-
cumference has been flared outward to form a punch-like
instrument mounted on a rotary tool (the UPunch Rotor).
The cutting tip was fabricated by the author from 19- or
18-gauge needles. This modification minimizes much of
the customary graft damage that accompanies the use of
straight punches, resulting in clean extraction of intact
grafts as the axis of the punch cutting edges is directed
away from the follicles.7,18 In addition, because wounds
created by these customized punches widen with depth,
injury to follicles is lessened, and wound closure accelerat-
ed. Of note is the author’s use of only 18-gauge needles for
the extraction of gray hairs on the premise that using
smaller punches may increase the possibility of disrupting
the integrity and viability of the follicles. Although the
strength of gray hair is comparable to pigmented hair, it has
a higher susceptibility to ultraviolet radiation damage and
is under higher oxidative stress.19,20 Grafts were hydrated
with a piece of wet gauze using a 2- to 3-minute interval
between the time of scoring and actual removal of the folli-
cles. This process has been subsequently automated by the
author wherein grafts were hydrated by the rotary device
(UGraft Revolution Pro-Dex Inc., Irvine, CA) that irrigates
them with a physiologic solution at the time of scoring. The
irrigation system delivered fluid to a chamber in the hand
piece and is activated by the operator via a foot pedal. Hair
follicles were then removed with the occasional assistance
of hypodermic needle tip dissection and placed in chilled
Ringer’s lactate solution.
The author has observed that following scoring by the
UPunch Rotor, a variable percentage of grafts is completely

extraction because of complete hair loss in most areas. In the
areas with hair, the hair is also vellous-looking with densities
below 8 per cm2.

 separated from all tissue attachments. It is possible that
these grafts are susceptible to ischemia and desiccation at a
faster rate than grafts with residual attachments to the sur-
rounding tissue, which require hypodermic needle separa-
tion. Consequently, a simple procedure (“FUE swipe
maneuver”) was devised to rapidly identify these follicles
and to remove and store them in physiologic media sepa-
rately ahead of attached grafts. The procedure entails
rubbing wet gauze over the donor areas soon after 50 to
100 follicles have been scored. This maneuver typically
removes most of these free grafts (Figure 4). Although the
relationship between graft survival and time between
scoring and actual removal of grafts has not been well
studied, biochemical evidence would suggest that this time
should be minimized.21 For recipient grafting, slits were
created by means of blades custom-sized to the dimensions
of the extracted grafts.
Postoperative nonhead hair donor sites were left open
and coated with bacitracin or Neosporin ointment for the
first 7 days after surgery twice a day, and triamcinolone
lotion 0.1% was used daily for the first 3 days after surgery.
Patient Surveys
A survey was emailed to patients from June 2011 through
June 2012 to evaluate donor healing, recipient growth, and
overall satisfaction with the procedure. Patients were identi-
fied on the survey sheet. Reminders were re-emailed to non-
responders at least twice. The following indices were
evaluated using 11-point Likert-like scales: healing status
(0 = not well at all and 10 = very well); hair growth in the
restored area (0 = no growth and 10 = excellent growth);
donor area wound healing (0 = not well at all and 10 = very
well); hair growth in strip hair surgery scar area, as applica-
ble (0 = zero growth and 10 = excellent growth); and
overall satisfaction with the procedure and results (0 = not
satisfied and 10 = extremely satisfied). Additionally, the
transplanted graft count was extracted from patient records
and evaluated. A blank copy of the survey is available as
Supplemental Material at www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com.
RESULTS
One hundred and twenty-two men were included in the study.
The mean patient age of the patients undergoing BHT was
42.7 years (standard deviation [SD], 8.67; range, 24-66 years).
In 113 patients (92.6%), beard hair was one of the BHT
donor sources used. In 78 BHT patients (63.9%), head and
NPA hair were additional donor sources. Six patients
(4.9%) had donor hair from only the trunk, limbs, armpits,
and pubic area transplanted, in which no hair was used
from the beard, head, or NPA areas. Main recipient areas
included the hairline, scar strip surgery, and crown of the
scalp (Figure 5). In over half of patients (n = 65, 53.3%),
strip surgery scar surgery repair was the sole procedure or
done in conjunction with restoration of balding scalp recipi-
ent areas whereby beard hair was transplanted into the
linear scars of a previous strip hair transplantation. Four pa-
tients requested minor touch up transplants to their eye-
brows in addition to their BHT and were included in the
survey. In all 4 of these patients, over 6000 grafts were im-
planted to their scalps in contrast to less than 100 grafts
total for eyebrow implants.
The mean graft count was 4346 (Table 1). The propor-
tion of BHT grafts as a percentage of total grafts was 75%

Some grafts are also found laying on the skin surface free of
any tissue attachments.

 (SD, 33.3). Eighteen patients (14.8%) underwent multiple
surgery sessions—typically 2 or 3—although a few had as
many as 6 or 7 sessions.
Survey Results
Seventy-nine patients responded to the survey, a response
rate of 64.8%. Individual question response rates varied,
but for overall satisfaction questions, the mean response
rate was 62.6%. Mean follow-up time between last surgery
and administration of the survey was 2.9 years (SD, 1.17;
range, 0.2-6.3 years).
Patients were generally very satisfied with the results of
their procedure, giving average scores of at least a 7.8 on a
Likert-like scale of 0 to 10 for their healing status, hair
growth in the recipient areas, and overall satisfaction with
their surgeries. Patients who assessed the healing of their
donor areas (n = 74, 60.2%) gave a mean score of 8.6 (SD,
1.63) (Table 2). Patients who, in addition to their BHT
donor sources, also had head and NPA hair as a donor
source reported the most satisfaction with the healing
status (n = 46), giving a mean score of 8.9 (SD, 1.56). For
patients who had contributions from beard hair as a donor
source, rating of donor area healing made little difference
whether they also had a strip scar surgery or not (mean, 8.7
vs 8.6, respectively).

 Seventy-nine patients (64%) assessed the transplanted
hair growth in the recipient areas, providing a mean score
of 8.2 (SD, 1.71) (Table 3). Of the 65 patients in whom
beard hair was used to improve the appearance of their
strip scar from previous hair restoration procedures, 48
(73.8%) responded to the question of overall hair growth
rate. The mean growth score provided was 8.2 (SD, 1.64).
Almost all strip scar patients had beard hair used as their
sole donor source (n = 60), which is characteristic of my
practice. These patients provided a slightly higher mean
score of 8.3 (SD, 1.64) for just their strip scar growth out-
comes. Patients who had the beard as a donor source but
did not have a strip scar surgery rated their overall hair
growth rate as 8.3 (SD, 1.65).
Overall satisfaction with the surgical outcomes reported
by the patients (n = 77, 63.1%) was high with a mean score
of 8.3 (SD, 1.71) (Table 4). Patients whose donor sources in-
volved only 1 or more of trunk, limbs, armpits, pubic areas,
or beard areas for nonstrip scar head recipient sites were
well satisfied with the results, providing mean scores of 8.2
and 8.3, respectively. This compared favorably with patients
who, in addition to their BHT transplants, also included the
use of head or NPA grafts, who reported a mean score of 8.3
(Table 4). For the 6 BHT patients in whom only trunk, limb,
armpits, or pubic donor sources were utilized (ie, no head or
beard donor sources were used), the mean scores for donor
healing, overall growth rate, and overall satisfaction were
7.1, 6.9, and 8.0, respectively.
Patient Outcomes
No complications were encountered in any patients.
Figure 6 depicts a 46-year-old patient who had experi-
enced multiple failed attempts at hair restoration with head
donor areas used exclusively. In particular, the crown area
was mostly bald with pluggy and misplaced rows of hair.
After transplantation of 14,000 grafts from the head and
beard, the result is a cosmetically excellent restoration over
the entire Norwood (NW) level 6 area,7 with a softer re-
paired hairline in which chest hair was mainly used as the
donor source.
Figure 7 presents preoperative photographs of another
representative patient who was severely bald with no
option to using head donor that had been exhausted from
previous hair surgeries. In addition to thinning that in-
volved an NW 7 area, several scars in the NW 7 area and
hairline needed to be covered. After using 8000 grafts from
the chest, abdomen, thighs, and legs, as well as 2000 grafts
from the beard areas, the results show a nicely restored
Norwood level 6 area as well as the camouflaging of the
scars and the creation of a more natural hairline that is ap-
propriate for a middle-aged man.1
DISCUSSION
In preselected hirsute patients, BHT to the head can be a
viable technique to produce cosmetically acceptable results
when adequate scalp donor hair is not available. In my prac-
tice, about 45% of patients receive BHT, although this figure
might be much lower in other practices. However, it is impor-
tant to understand that, for the majority of patients, BHT is
used along with more traditional donor sources such as
the SDA or NPA. Despite the methodological limitations
(self-selection) of a retrospective survey, patients who re-
sponded had good assessments of healing, hair growth, and
overall satisfaction with their surgeries. The highest scores
were given by patients who, in addition to BHT grafts, also
utilized head and NPA hair as a donor source. However,
when comparing the results among patient subgroups, pa-
tients with BHT without contributions from head or NPA
donor sources also had good overall satisfaction (range,
8.1-8.2). In fact, BHT patients with beard-involved donor hair
provided the same mean score as BHT patients with head and
NPA-involved donor hair for both growth rate assessment

 and overall satisfaction with the results. For healing status,
the mean score was nearly as high for beard-involved donor
BHT patients (8.7) as head and NPA-involved donor BHT pa-
tients (8.9). Incidentally, the overall satisfaction score with
BHT in this study regardless of donor source (8.3) was the
same as the overall satisfaction score achieved when only
finer head hairs from the NPA areas were used to create softer
hairlines and temples (8.3).18
The 6 BHT patients in whom no head or beard donor
sources were used (ie, only hairs from any 1 or more of
trunk, limbs, armpits, and pubic hair were used as donor
sources) generally provided marginally lower scores (7.1
for donor healing and 6.9 for growth rate) However, in
terms of overall satisfaction with the results, these pa-
tients were nearly as equally satisfied (mean score, 8.0) as
their counterparts in whom their BHT also involved the

 utilization of beard, head, or NPA counterparts (mean
score, 8.3).
The major limitations to the use of BHT in hair restora-
tion (compared with traditional use of scalp hair as a sole
donor source) are that the procedure is longer and more
costly, requires a higher surgical skill level and specialized
equipment and instruments, may result in lower quality
outcomes, and is not an option in nonhairy individuals.7 In
particular, it is worth noting that while the overall graft
take using SDA/NPA is about 95%, for BHT it is around
75%-80%.1,5 It is also relatively labor intensive and, given
the complexity and delicate nature of the procedure, the ap-
plicability of robotic options seems less likely in the near
future.
From clinical experience, the author has observed a
large number of patients with patchy areas of baldness
both on the body (Figure 3) and in the beard. Although the
most common cause of such patchy hair loss in the beard
area is alopecia areata, other conditions are also often re-
sponsible.22,23 In one instance, a biopsy by the author of
patchy leg area of hair loss revealed a single hair follicle in
catagen-telogen phase with no significant peribulbar in-
flammatory cell infiltrate; no follicular ostia in the epider-
mis; no interface dermatitis, dermal mucinosis, or scarring;
and no melanin pleating. There was scant superficial peri-
vascular lymphocytic infiltrate with rare melanophages.
These were nonspecific findings and may be related to
chronic friction in the area. In cases in which the cause of
patch hair loss is unclear, it is advisable to refrain from ex-
tracting hair from these and adjacent areas. Earlier in his
experience with BHT, the author noted a relatively higher
graft transection and trauma rate during extractions of hairs
from the back regions of the torso. This is attributed to the
fact that the reticular dermal layer in the region is the thick-
est of all body regions24; for this reason, back hairs should
be routinely avoided in BHT. The beard is the easiest skin
area from which to extract with other areas slightly more
difficult. When extracting from the abdomen, lack of
patient sedation is important so the patient can coordinate
breathing movements with the surgeon’s activities. The
trunk areas involved in the reported patients only involved
the chest, abdominal, and upper shoulders, and transection
rates were acceptable at 10% or less. In the beard area, it is
typically less than 5%, and it is 5%-10% in the area below
the neck. The UPunch Rotor also pulls the follicle into its
lumen as it cuts around it, and the operator does need not
push the punch all the way to the follicular root as the
punch pulls the follicle upward in effect carrying the cut
down to the follicular root level and beyond it (3-6 mm).
This pulling action is attributed to the textured inner
surface of the device, which the author considers a critical
component to the success of the technique in his hands.
Healing of donor areas can leave white dots, which are
hypopigmented, tiny but flat, and insignificant scars that
are hardly visible in Caucasian patients but may be more
visible in patients with darker skin. The author has not
observed any instance of hypertrophic scarring or keloids
in part because patients with history of abnormal scarring
are disqualified from having surgery and also because of
good surgical practice, technique, and tooling, such as use
of the UPunch Rotor, which enhances wound closure and
aesthetics. However, the most common side effects of FUE
in general still apply, including the occasional ingrown
hair.
Because transplanted body hair (with the exception of
beard hair) does not grow as long as head hair, hair is rou-
tinely maintained short after the procedure for the best cos-
metic results. Another factor favoring a shorter haircut
stems from the observation that in predominantly beard
graft-involved BHT, a longer hair cut could present groom-
ing challenges as beard hair is relatively wirier and may be
difficult to style. In addition to maintaining hair short to op-
timize cosmetic results of BHT by FUE, hair dyes can be
used to produce a more even coloring at the recipient site.2
In general, men naturally tend to be better candidates than
women for BHT to the head because they typically possess
beard and body hair. Finally, patient expectations must be
managed accordingly, with the realization that their recipi-
ent area hair will be short, but still cosmetically acceptable,
when body hairs have been transplanted.
While patient satisfaction of BHT was good in the
present patients, and about two-thirds of patients answered
questions, retrospective surveys have inherent limitations.
Not all patients returned their surveys, which can result in
response bias, as well as over- or underestimation of means
and variance estimates. Second, when patients are asked to
rate items that happened in the past (eg, donor healing
areas), responses can be inaccurate. In addition, question-
naires were not returned anonymously, which can also be a
source of bias. Despite these limitations, most patients re-
turned their survey and reported good results. Third, a
blinded, third-party assessment of patients’ results based
on preoperative and postoperative photos was not possible,
which limits confirmation of patient assessment. Last, com-
plete graft information was not available for every patient,
which could lead to more uncertainty regarding the statis-
tics. Strengths of the study include a relatively large sample
size and breadth of combinations of donor sources.
CONCLUSIONS
This series of patients suggests that transplantation of body
hair to the scalp by FUE can be a cosmetically viable treat-
ment in a select patient population of hirsute individuals
who suffer from severe baldness or have inadequate hair in
their SDA.
