Abstract 
Background: Psychological disorders including depression and anxiety are not rare in primary care clinics. The 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a clinical diagnostic tool that is widely utilized by primary health care physicians 
worldwide because it provides a practical in‑clinic tool to screen for psychological disorders. This study evaluated the 
validity of the Arabic version of the PHQ in all six modules including depression, anxiety, somatic, panic, eating, and 
alcohol abuse disorders.
Methods: This is a quantitative observational cross‑sectional study that was conducted by administrating the trans‑
lated Arabic version of PHQ to a sample of King Saud University students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Results: The sample was 731 university students who participated in this study including 376 (51.6%) females and 
354 (48.4%) males with a mean age of 21.30 years. Eight mental health experts carried out the face validation process 
of the PHQ Arabic version. The internal consistency reliability was measured using Cronbach’s alpha for the PHQ9, 
GAD7, PHQ15, and panic disorder modules. The results were 0.857, 0.763, 0.826, and 0.696, respectively. In compari‑
son, the eating disorders and alcohol abuse modules demonstrated poor internal consistency due to small number of 
participants in these modules.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the Arabic version of the PHQ is a valid and reliable tool to screen for 
depression, anxiety, somatic, and panic disorders in a Saudi sample.

Background
Psychological disorders are relatively common in the 
community and in primary care patients. A recent study 
of three large primary care clinics in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 
reported that nearly half of the patients expressed depres-
sive symptoms [1]. Also, Al-Khathami and Ogbeide 
found that nearly one-third of the primary health clinic 
patients at Alkharj, Saudi Arabia demonstrated a high 
prevalence of psychological disorders [2]. Becker studied 
a primary care clinic in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and showed 
that primary care physicians had poor diagnostic skills 
and could not accurately detect depression or somatiza-
tion [3].
Many reliable self-report screening psychological 
instruments are available to help physicians in detecting 
psychological symptoms and improving their abilities to 
diagnose mental illness. Self-report questionnaires can 
provide an accurate diagnosis that is equally valid when 
compared to the structured interviews [4]. Thus, there is 
a widespread need to provide clinical instruments that 
can improve the diagnosis of psychological disorders at 
primary care clinics in Saudi Arabia.
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is one of the 
most widely used clinical diagnostic instruments in pri-
mary care settings. It is valid and reliable in detecting

psychological disorders. It is a self-administrated instru-
ment that was developed in 1999 as an improved ver-
sion of the original Primary Care Evaluation of Mental 
Disorders (PRIME-MD). It has good utility and accept-
able validity compared to the original questionnaire. It 
measures six disorders: depression, generalized anxiety, 
panic, somatization, eating, and alcohol abuse disorders 
[4]. In the last two decades, studies have shown that the 
PHQ is efficient, reliable, and highly acceptable for diag-
nosing depression, anxiety, and somatic disorders. Löwe 
et al. compared the PHQ with The Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS) and the WHO Well-being 
(WBI-5), tools designed for screening depression and 
anxiety. The PHQ had better diagnostic accuracy com-
pared to the two well-established instruments [5]. This 
study used the international classification of diseases 
ICD-10 diagnosis criteria for depression. Conversely, the 
original PHQ study used the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders revised third edition and 
the fourth edition (DSM-III-R and DSM-IV) as criteria 
[4]. There is no big difference in diagnostic criteria for 
depression and anxiety disorders in ICD-10 and DSM-IV. 
Thus, it appears that the PHQ demonstrates reliable diag-
nostic accuracy of mental disorders whether the diagnos-
tic criteria were based on the ICD-10 or the DSM-IV.
The PHQ has been adapted into many languages as a 
valuable diagnostic instrument because it exhibits high 
cultural sensitivity among different cultures and ethnic 
groups. For instance, the PHQ-9—the depression mod-
ule—is a good instrument to evaluate depression cases 
among diverse ethnic groups in the United States such 
as African Americans, Chinese Americans, and Latinos 
[6]. Accordingly, many international adaptations of the 
instrument have shown that it is valid and reliable instru-
ment. Karekla et al. examined the validity of the PHQ for 
a Greek population and concluded that it demonstrated 
good validity and reliability. Other studies also supported 
these findings [7]. Liu et al. [8] reported that the Chinese 
version of the (PHQ-9) and its subscales are valid and 
can accurately detect major depression in Taiwan. Fur-
thermore, a study showed that the Patient Health Ques-
tionnaire—Somatic, Anxiety, and Depressive symptoms 
(PHQ-SAD), is valid and reliable for a Turkish population 
[9]. Many other countries and cultures adapted PHQ9 as 
a diagnostic and screening tool including Nepal, Nigeria, 
Greece, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and China [7, 10–14]. The 
PHQ-9 is also adapted in many medical diagnoses like 
AIDS, coronary artery diseases, migraine, morbid obe-
sity, and stroke [15–19].
The PHQ was first adapted into Arabic in 2002 by 
a study that examined its validity in terms of detect-
ing depression, anxiety, and somatization in primary 
care. The study used the Structured Clinical Interview 
(SCID-R) as the standard criterion and reported that the 
PHQ is valid in a Saudi population for diagnosing depres-
sion and somatization but not anxiety [3, 20]. However, 
the study did not illustrate the causes of the low sensi-
tivity of the PHQ anxiety module. Nevertheless, its sen-
sitivity could be improved by lowering the threshold to 
“several days” instead of “more than half of the days” [20]. 
To the best of our knowledge, no other study has shown 
the validity of the PHQ and its anxiety module for a Saudi 
population.
Other studies used the PHQ-9 to examine depression 
prevalence in primary care clinics. Abdelwahid and Al-
shahrani reported that the prevalence of depression was 
12% among patients of Family Medicine in Southeastern 
Saudi Arabia by using the (PHQ-9) as a detecting instru-
ment [21]. A cross-sectional study surveyed four primary 
care clinics in Alkhobar, Saudi Arabia and reported that 
the prevalence of depression among the primary care 
patients was 16% by using the PHQ-9 [22]. Finally, Al-
Qadhi et al. investigated the prevalence of depression in 
primary care clinics and reported high prevalence. They 
also compared the PHQ-9 and the ultra-brief version 
PHQ-2 and stated that the two versions are equally valid 
for screening depression [1]. It was evident in various 
studies that university students had prevalent and persis-
tent mental health problems. In all these studies, the Ara-
bic (Tunisian version) PHQ9 translation was used. There 
are no other Arabic translations available in the PHQ 
website other than PHQ9 and GAD7.
Until recently there was no study examining the validity 
of the entire PHQ with all modules in an Arabic speakers 
population. This study examines the validity of the PHQ 
in screening for depression, anxiety, somatic, panic, eat-
ing, and alcohol abuse disorders in a population of uni-
versity students.
Methods
This is a quantitative observational cross-sectional study.
Subjects and procedure
We recruited university students from King Saud Uni-
versity in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The sample was collected 
through convenience sampling. We included students 
agreeing to participate in the study and able to read and 
understand Arabic. Almost all participants are Saudi and 
all of them are fluent in Arabic and English languages. 
We offered questionnaire to all university students in the 
medical college through representatives in each class. 
Data were collected from January to May 2015.

s standard deviation = 4.91 of PHQ-9 from previous 
study [1]; d the accuracy of estimate, we chose 1 differ-
ence score in the total score of PHQ-9 score; Za/2 a nor-
mal deviate reflects the type I error which = 1.96 for 
95% confidence level; Sample size = (1.96)2 * (4.91)2/
(1)2 = 3.84 * 24.11/1 = 92.58–93 participants; So the 
required sample for power analysis is 93 participants.
Measures
We used a paper and pen questionnaire. The ques-
tionnaire included demographic data and formal (not 
dialect) Arabic translation of the whole PHQ. PHQ 
consists of six modules. Depression (PHQ9-9 items), 
generalized anxiety (GAD7-7 items), and somatiza-
tion (PHQ15-15 items) modules have items with Likert 
scales. Panic (15 items), eating (8 items), and alcohol 
abuse (5 items) modules are all Yes/No answers. The 
Arabic version is exactly the same structure of the 
original English scale. We followed the guidelines of 
Sousa et al. in translation, adaptation, and validation 
of PHQ [23]: Step 1: forward translation—translation 
of the PHQ into the Arabic language by two independ-
ent translators. Step 2: synthesis I—comparison of the 
two translated versions of the PHQ and the develop-
ment of an initial translated version. Step 3: blind back-
translation of the preliminary initial translated version 
of the PHQ from Arabic to English. Step 4: synthesis 
II—comparison of the two back-translated versions of 
the PHQ. Step 5: pilot testing of the pre-final version 
of the instrument in Arabic. We also did face validity 
by sending the pre-final version to eight referees from 
mental health experts.
Ethical
The PHQ measures are in the public domain. No per-
mission was required to reproduce, translate, display, or 
distribute. IRB approval from King Saud University was 
granted before data collection was begun.
Data analysis
Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for 
Social Sciences (SPSS) [24] (Armonk, NY, USA) ver-
sion 21.0. Descriptive statistical data are presented by 
mean values, standard deviations, and percentages for 
the sociodemographic variables. Pearson’s correlation 
was used to assess the relationship between different 
variables. We used Cronbach’s alpha coefficients, cor-
rected item-total correlation and inter-item correlation 
matrix analysis to assess the internal consistency reli-
ability. A Cronbach’s alpha of ≥0.7 and item-total cor-
relation of >0.2 were considered statistically acceptable 
[25]. Only statistically significant differences at p < 0.05 
were reported.
Results
We recruited 731 university students out of 1400 students 
with response rate of 52%. Almost half of them were 
female 376 (51.6%) with a mean age of 21.30 (SD = 1.46) 
years. Almost all the participants were single. Table 1 
shows the demographic characteristics of the sample.
Translation process
It took approximately 2 months to finalize the process. 
We hired independent certified translators who are not 
familiar with the questionnaire. The authors of this study 
were the focus group that made the synthesis. All are flu-
ent in both Arabic and English languages—some of them 
are mental health experts and some of them were medi-
cal students.
Validity analysis
Face validity was carried out by a group of eight experts 
in mental health (psychiatrists and psychologists) flu-
ent in Arabic and English. The final draft of the Arabic 
version with the original English scale and was sent via 
email. They completed a form stating whether they agree 
with the translation of each item or not and provided 
comments or alternative translations. They agreed on 
approximately 98% of the translation with few comments 
and suggestions. The authors reviewed all feedback

Reliability and item analysis
PHQ‑9
Table 2 shows the mean scores and standard deviation 
for all PHQ-9 items. The most frequently endorsed item 
was “Feeling tired.
” Suicidal ideation was the item that 
was endorsed the least. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.857. All 
items, if deleted, would decrease the total scale of Cron-
bach’s alpha except item 9 (suicidal ideation). All items 
correlated with the total scale to a good degree (lowest 
r = 0.378). Inter-item correlations range between 0.177 
and 0.648 as shown in Table 3.
GAD‑7
Table 4 shows the mean scores and standard deviation 
for all GAD7 items. The most frequently endorsed item 
was “Feeling nervous, anxious, on edge, or worrying a 
lot about different things.
” “Feeling restless so that it is 
hard to sit still” was the item that was endorsed the least. 
Cronbach’s alpha was 0.763. All items, if deleted, would 
decrease the total scale of Cronbach’s alpha. All items 
correlated with the total scale to a good degree (lowest 
r = 0.410). Inter-item correlations range between 0.204 
and 0.426 as shown in Table 5.
PHQ‑15
We calculated it as instructed in PHQ instruction man-
ual [26] by assigning scores of 0, 1, and 2 to the response 
categories of (not at all, bothered a little, and bothered 
a lot) for the 13 somatic symptoms of the PHQ (items 
1a-1 m). Also, 2 items from the PHQ-9 were added (sleep 
and energy) and scored 0 (not at all), 1 (several days) or 
2 (more than half the days or nearly every day). Table 6 
shows the mean scores and standard deviation for all

PHQ-15 items. The most frequently endorsed item was 
“Feeling tired or low energy.
” “Pain or problems during 
sexual intercourse” was the item that was endorsed the 
least. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.826. All items, if deleted, 
would decrease the total scale Cronbach’s alpha with 
the exception of “Pain or problems during sexual inter-
course.
” All items correlated with the total scale to a good 
degree (lowest r = 0.207) except item 5 “Pain or problems 
during sexual intercourse” with r = 0.032. Inter-item cor-
relations range between −0.040 and 0.588 as shown in 
Table 7.
Other scales
Panic disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol abuse sec-
tions were all Yes/No answers. It is different than PHQ-9, 
GAD-7, and PHQ-15, which are Likert scale answers.
The panic disorder scale consists of 15 items. It started 
with a single question “In the last 4 weeks, have you had 
an anxiety attack suddenly feeling fear or panic?” If the 
subject answered “No” then there was no need to com-
plete the rest of the items. The next 3 items asked about 
attack details, and the next 11 items focused on the phys-
ical symptoms during attacks. It measures the diagnosis 
not the severity. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.696. All items, 
if deleted, would decrease the total scale of Cronbach’s 
alpha except “Have you had an anxiety attack—suddenly 
fear or panic?”
, “Has this ever happened before?” and “Did 
you tremble or shake?” they will increase alpha to 0.700, 
0.709, and 0.707, respectively.
Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder have 8 
items. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.110. Again, it measures the 
diagnosis not the severity. This scale started with 2 items. 
If any were answered with a “Yes” then the participant 
needs to proceed; otherwise, he stops.
The alcohol abuse scale consisted of 5 items. Cron-
bach’s alpha was 0.280. This scale starts with a question: 
“Do you ever drink alcohol (including beer or wine)?” If 
participant checks “NO” then he needs to stop and not 
answer the remaining 5 items.
Discussion
This study evaluated the validity and reliability of the 
PHQ in a sample of university students. The PHQ is very 
helpful tool for diagnosis and also for severity measures 
for many psychiatric disorders. Some studies already 
used the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PHQ-15 in Saudi Arabia. 
Most of them used a straightforward translation method 
or the Tunisian Arabic version of the PHQ-9 in PHQ 
screeners website [22].

The PHQ-9 showed good internal consistency with 
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.857. Usually, self-reported scales 
are considered to have good reliability if Cronbach’s 
alpha ranges between 0.70 and 0.95 [25]. This is consist-
ent with the results of PHQ in the US where the alpha 
coefficient ranged from 0.79 to 0.89 [6, 27]. It also agrees 
with a Nigerian study that showed the alpha PHQ9 to be 
0.85 [11]. The suicidal ideation item is the only item that 
if deleted will increase the reliability by 0.002. This small 
increment does not motivate removing the item. How-
ever, there is another version of PHQ-9 without this item. 
It is called PHQ-8 and is used mainly in non-depression 
research studies [26]. All other items correlated to the 
total scale nicely. Ideally, the average inter-item correla-
tion for a set of items is better between 0.20 and 0.40 [28].
The GAD-7 reliability is acceptable with Cronbach’s 
alpha of 0.763, and all the items are nicely correlated with 
the total scale and also to each other. The PHQ-SADS 
includes PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PHQ-15 measures plus 
panic measure from the original PHQ. However, GAD7 
in PHQ is not the same as in PHQ-SADS in many points. 
First, only 3 items are the same in both versions of GAD7. 
Second, answers in GAD7 of the PHQ include 3 options 
“Not at all, several days, and more than half the days” 
where “nearly every day” is added in GAD-7 of PHQ-
SADS. Third, duration of symptoms is 4 weeks in GAD-7 
of PHQ, while it is 2 weeks in GAD-7 of PHQ-SADS. We 
used GAD7 of the PHQ and found it to be reliable. We 
do not know which version of GAD7 was used in Becker 
et al. which found that the anxiety scale is not valid in 
Arabic (Saudi Arabia) [20]. We tried to get this informa-
tion or to get the Arabic version that was used but we 
were unable because of no response from the authors.
The PHQ-15 somatization scale showed good internal 
consistency with Cronbach’s alpha with 0.826. A Greek 
study found PHQ-15 Cronbach’s alpha to be 0.73 for 
women and 0.71 for men [29]. In a Swedish sample, the 
alpha coefficients of the PHQ-15 ranged from 0.75 to 
0.85 between study groups [30]. Becker et al. found sen-
sitivity and specificity for Arabic somatization scale 0.65 
and 0.96, respectively [20]. All PHQ-15 items are nicely 
correlated with the total scale with the exception of item 
5 “Pain or problems during sexual intercourse.
” This item 
showed poor correlation with other items in inter-item 
correlations. The inter-item correlations of the PHQ-15 
showed 5 negative scores out of 15 scores—none of these 
were >0.2. This could be because almost all participants 
were single (98.1%). Only 10 of the participants answered 
this question, and the rest of participants left it blank. 
Eight chose “not at all,
” and only two chose “bothered a 
little.
” To correctly test this item, it is better to select a 
cohort with more married participants.
Other scales
Panic disorder scale showed acceptable internal consist-
ency with alpha = 0.696. This confirms a Greek study that 
found alpha = 0.73 [7]. We believe that the items—that if 
they are deleted may increase the reliability—are worth 
to stay in the scale. First, the increase is not that much 
(a 0.013 maximum). Second, they are crucial—especially

the first one, which is the gate for the scale. Also, the sec-
ond item focuses on attack recurrence, which is a crite-
rion for panic disorder diagnosis. The least important 
item is shaking and tremor although it is among common 
physical symptoms in the panic attack.
Unfortunately, eating disorders and alcohol abuse 
modules have low internal consistency scores. This can 
be explained by the small number who answered these 
modules and small number of items. The Cronbach alpha 
depends on the sample size and on the items number in 
the scale. Small item numbers (<10) have Cronbach alpha 
values that are usually very small [28]. Eating disorder 
modules have only 8 items and were answered by only 
41 participants (5.6%). This is not consistent with other 
studies. For example, the Greek study found that Cron-
bach’s alpha for an eating disorder module is 0.70 [7].
The alcohol abuse scale showed low reliability. Alcohol 
drinking is prohibited and illegal in Saudi Arabia. This 
low reliability score could be due to the low participation 
rate in this section. It has only 5 items, and only 6 partici-
pants (<1%) answered the scale. All were male. Although 
no females answered the scale, the last item in the scale 
stated “Driving under the influence,
” and this cannot be 
measured in Saudi women because it is illegal for females 
to drive in Saudi Arabia.
Conclusion
The PHQ Scale is a widely used tool with many trans-
lations worldwide. The Arabic version of the PHQ is a 
valid and reliable measure to screen depression, anxiety, 
somatic, and panic disorders in a Saudi sample. Eating 
disorders and alcohol abuse modules need to be admin-
istered on different samples to have more participation. 
We hope our study will encourage researchers and prac-
titioners to conduct more studies in Saudi Arabia regard-
ing mental health disorders.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, the study was 
conducted among university students; therefore, it can-
not be generalized. Second, it would be better if the reli-
ability was examined through test–retest and not limited 
to the internal consistency tests. Third, we did not do 
convergent validity by comparing the scale to another 
gold standard. Fourth, there were few participants in the 
eating disorder and alcohol abuse modules.
Clinical implications
The application of validated and reliable Arabic PHQ 
will have a better impact in the recognition and detec-
tion of various mental health disorders that are 
under-diagnosed.
