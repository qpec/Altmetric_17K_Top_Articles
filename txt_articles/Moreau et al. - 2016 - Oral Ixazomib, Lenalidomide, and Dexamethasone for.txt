BACKGROUND
Ixazomib is an oral proteasome inhibitor that is currently being studied for the treatment 
of multiple myeloma.
METHODS
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 722 patients 
who had relapsed, refractory, or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive ixazo-
mib plus lenalidomide–dexamethasone (ixazomib group) or placebo plus lenalidomide–
dexamethasone (placebo group). The primary end point was progression-free survival.
RESULTS
Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ixazomib group than in the placebo 
group at a median follow-up of 14.7 months (median progression-free survival, 20.6 months 
vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death in the ixazomib group, 0.74; 
P 
= 
0.01); a benefit with respect to progression-free survival was observed with the ixazomib 
regimen, as compared with the placebo regimen, in all prespecified patient subgroups, in-
cluding in patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. The overall rates of response 
were 78% in the ixazomib group and 72% in the placebo group, and the corresponding rates 
of complete response plus very good partial response were 48% and 39%. The median time 
to response was 1.1 months in the ixazomib group and 1.9 months in the placebo group, 
and the corresponding median duration of response was 20.5 months and 15.0 months. At 
a median follow-up of approximately 23 months, the median overall survival has not been 
reached in either study group, and follow-up is ongoing. The rates of serious adverse events 
were similar in the two study groups (47% in the ixazomib group and 49% in the placebo 
group), as were the rates of death during the study period (4% and 6%, respectively); adverse 
events of at least grade 3 severity occurred in 74% and 69% of the patients, respectively. 
Thrombocytopenia of grade 3 and grade 4 severity occurred more frequently in the ixazomib 
group (12% and 7% of the patients, respectively) than in the placebo group (5% and 4% of 
the patients, respectively). Rash occurred more frequently in the ixazomib group than in the 
placebo group (36% vs. 23% of the patients), as did gastrointestinal adverse events, which 
were predominantly low grade. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 27% in the ixa-
zomib group and 22% in the placebo group (grade 3 events occurred in 2% of the patients 
in each study group). Patient-reported quality of life was similar in the two study groups.
CONCLUSIONS
The addition of ixazomib to a regimen of lenalidomide and dexamethasone was as-
sociated with significantly longer progression-free survival; the additional toxic effects 
with this all-oral regimen were limited. (Funded by Millennium Pharmaceuticals;

O
utcomes of multiple myeloma 
have improved substantially over the past 
15 years with the introduction of protea-
some inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs,1,2 
and these agents now form the backbone of 
therapy for multiple myeloma.3 In phase 3 stud-
ies, triplet regimens based on these agents were 
shown to be more efficacious than doublet regi-
mens when these regimens were used as a first-
line treatment4-6 and in relapsed disease.7,8 In 
addition, there has been a shift in treatment 
patterns toward the use of extended treatment to 
further improve long-term outcomes,9 and this 
shift highlights the need for additional effective 
agents with acceptable side-effect profiles that 
will enable patients to continue receiving ther-
apy for prolonged periods.
Ixazomib is a peptide boronic acid protea-
some inhibitor that is administered orally and 
that has a chemical structure and pharmaco-
logic properties that are distinct from those of 
bortezomib.10,11 Ixazomib was shown to have 
synergy with lenalidomide in preclinical stud-
ies.12 In an early-phase study, ixazomib was ad-
ministered orally once weekly in combination 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients 
with previously untreated multiple myeloma and 
was shown to have encouraging efficacy (58% of 
patients who could be evaluated had a complete 
response or a very good partial response) and 
manageable adverse events that included some 
peripheral neuropathy; the results from this 
study showed that long-term treatment could be 
continued for more than 4 years.13,14
These early-phase data provided the ratio-
nale for the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial reported here. We com-
pared the efficacy and safety of ixazomib, admin-
istered weekly, plus lenalidomide–dexamethasone 
(an all-oral triplet regimen containing a protea-
some inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug, 
together with dexamethasone) with those of 
placebo plus lenalidomide–dexamethasone in 
patients with relapsed, refractory, or relapsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma.
Methods
Patients
Adult patients were eligible for enrollment if 
they had relapsed, refractory, or both relapsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma; had measur-
able levels of disease (even if measurable by se-
rum free light-chain assay only); had an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor-
mance status score of 0 to 2 (on a scale from 
0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 
higher scores indicating increasing disability); 
had received one to three prior therapies; and 
had adequate hematologic and hepatic function. 
Patients with mild-to-moderate impairment of 
renal function (i.e., patients with a calculated 
creatinine clearance of at least 30 ml per minute 
per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area) were eligible. 
Patients were not eligible if they had peripheral 
neuropathy of grade 1 with pain or grade 2 or 
higher or had disease that was refractory to prior 
lenalidomide therapy or proteasome inhibitor–
based therapy; however, patients with primary 
refractory disease (defined as no response to 
prior therapy) were eligible. Eligibility criteria 
are described in detail in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org.
Study Design
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 
to receive, in 28-day cycles, either 4 mg of oral 
ixazomib or matching placebo on days 1, 8, and 
15; in addition, all patients received 25 mg of 
oral lenalidomide on days 1 through 21 (10 mg 
for patients with a creatinine clearance of ≤60 or 
≤50 ml per minute per 1.73 m2, with the cutoff 
point determined according to the local pre-
scribing information) and 40 mg of oral dexa-
methasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Randomiza-
tion was stratified according to the number of 
prior therapies (1 vs. 2 or 3), previous exposure to 
proteasome inhibitors (not exposed vs. exposed), 
and International Staging System disease stage 
(I or II vs. III, with higher stages indicating more 
advanced disease) (Table S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Treatment was continued until 
disease progression or the development of unac-
ceptable toxic effects. Thromboprophylaxis was 
required in all patients (97% of the patients in 
the ixazomib group and 98% of the patients in 
the placebo group received thromboprophylax-
is); prophylactic medications and permitted con-
comitant treatments are listed in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix. Dose adjustments for toxic effects 
were permitted according to established dose-
adjustment guidelines specified in the protocol 
or prescribing information for each study drug.
The primary end point was progression-free 
survival, which was defined as the time from the

date of randomization to the date of first docu-
mentation of disease progression or death from 
any cause, as assessed by an independent review 
committee, whose members were unaware of the 
study-group assignments. Prespecified key sec-
ondary end points were overall survival in the 
intention-to-treat population and overall sur-
vival in patients with chromosome 17p deletion 
[del(17p)]. Other secondary end points included 
the overall rate of response, the rate of complete 
response plus very good partial response, the 
duration of response, the time to disease pro-
gression, progression-free survival in patients 
with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, safety, 
and change in global health status. Additional 
end points are listed in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.
Study Oversight
The trial was conducted in accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines and appropriate reg-
ulatory requirements. Local ethics committees 
or institutional review boards approved the pro-
tocol, which is available at NEJM.org. All pa-
tients provided written informed consent.
The trial was designed by the first, last, and 
other authors in collaboration with the sponsor, 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of 
Takeda Pharmaceuticals. Data were gathered by 
the investigators and the sponsor and were ana-
lyzed by the sponsor; all the authors had access 
to the data. The initial draft of the manuscript 
was written by the first and last authors and two 
other authors, along with a professional medical 
writer who was funded by the sponsor. All the 
authors contributed to subsequent drafts, all 
the authors and the sponsor reviewed the drafts, 
and all the authors made the decision to submit 
the manuscript for publication. The investigators, 
participating institutions, and sponsor agreed to 
maintain confidentiality of the data. All the au-
thors vouch for the integrity, accuracy, and com-
pleteness of the data and analyses and for the 
fidelity of the study to the protocol.
Assessments
Assessments of the response to the study regi-
men were performed every cycle until disease 
progression. Assessments of response and dis-
ease progression were based on central labora-
tory results and International Myeloma Working 
Group 2011 criteria (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix),15 as evaluated by an independent 
review committee whose members were unaware 
of the study group assignments and investigator 
assessments. All patients were followed for sur-
vival after disease progression (every 12 weeks 
until death or termination of the study). Cytoge-
netic abnormalities were assessed by a central 
laboratory at screening, with high-risk abnormali-
ties defined as del(17p), translocation between 
chromosomes 4 and 14 [t(4;14)], or translocation 
between chromosomes 14 and 16 [t(14;16)]. 
Health-related quality of life was evaluated with 
the use of patient self-reported instruments that 
included the European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Question-
naire–Core 30 module (EORTC QLQ-C30) and 
the myeloma-specific module (EORTC QLQ-MY20) 
(for additional information on assessments, see 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
The primary end point of progression-free sur-
vival and the key secondary end points of overall 
survival and overall survival in patients with 
del(17p) were evaluated with the use of a closed 
sequential testing procedure to control for the 
type 1 error rate at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05; 
the test for overall survival was to be conducted 
on its own alpha-spending functions only if 
progression-free survival was significant. Three 
sequential interim analyses and a final analysis 
were planned. We calculated the total sample 
size such that the study would have 80% power 
to detect a 30% difference in overall survival 
(hazard ratio for death with ixazomib, 0.77), at 
a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. The study was 
powered to detect the superiority of ixazomib 
over placebo with respect to progression-free 
survival (hazard ratio of 0.74). An O’Brien–Flem-
ing stopping boundary for efficacy was calculated 
with the use of a Lan–DeMets alpha-spending 
function16 on the basis of the number of events 
observed at the time of data cutoff. An interim 
analysis was planned when approximately 36% of 
the patients had an event of progression or death.
At the first prespecified analysis at a median 
follow-up of approximately 15 months, the 
progression-free survival results crossed the pre-
specified O’Brien–Fleming boundary and showed 
that the ixazomib regimen was associated with 
a significant benefit as compared with the pla-
cebo regimen; therefore, in accordance with the 
statistical analysis plan in the protocol and the

principle of group sequential design, this was 
the final statistical analysis of progression-free 
survival. According to the protocol, the study 
continued in a double-blind manner to gain more 
mature data on overall survival; a second pre-
specified analysis at a median follow-up of ap-
proximately 23 months was conducted to assess 
survival.
The intention-to-treat population, which in-
cluded all patients who underwent randomiza-
tion, was evaluated for all primary and secondary 
efficacy analyses. The safety population included 
all patients who received at least one dose of a 
study drug or placebo. Additional details regard-
ing the populations included in our analyses are 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix. The 
Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate 
time-to-event distributions, and stratified log-
rank tests and Cox models, at a two-sided alpha 
level of 0.05, were used for between-group com-
parisons of time-to-event end points. We per-
formed prespecified subgroup analyses of pro-
gression-free survival, including in subgroups 
defined according to cytogenetic characteristics. 
A stratified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel chi-square 
test was used to assess between-group differ-
ences in response rates.

Patients
A total of 722 patients at 147 sites in 26 coun-
tries were enrolled in the study from August 28, 
2012, to May 27, 2014 (Fig. S1 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Baseline characteristics of the 
patients in the intention-to-treat population were 
well balanced between the study groups (Table 1). 
The results of cytogenetic analysis were available 
for 76% of the patients and showed that 19% of 
the intention-to-treat population had high-risk 
cytogenetic abnormalities, including 10% with 
del(17p).

The International Staging System (ISS) consists of three stages: stage I, serum β2-microglobulin level lower than 3.5 
mg per liter (300 nmol per liter) and albumin level 3.5 g per deciliter or higher; stage II, neither stage I or III; and 
stage III, serum β2-microglobulin 5.5 mg per liter or higher (470 nmol per liter). Higher stages indicate more severe 
disease.
¶  
High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and were de-
fined as chromosome 17p deletion [del(17p)], translocation between chromosomes 4 and 14 [t(4;14)], and transloca-
tion between chromosomes 14 and 16 [t(14;16)]. A total of 36 patients in the ixazomib group and 33 patients in the 
placebo group had del(17p) alone or in combination with either t(4;14) or t(14;16) or both; 36 and 25 patients, re-
spectively, had t(4;14) alone; and 3 and 4 patients, respectively, had t(14;16) alone. Standard-risk cytogenetic abnor-
malities were defined as the absence of high-risk abnormalities in the samples that were available for evaluation; 
samples from some patients were not available for testing because the sample was missing or clotted or for other 
reasons. In accordance with the protocol, the cutoff values for defining the presence of high-risk cytogenetic abnor-
malities were established by the central diagnostic laboratory on the basis of the false positive rates (or technical cut-
off values) of the FISH probes that we used. These cutoff points were 5% positive cells for del(17p), 3% positive cells 
for t(4;14), and 3% positive cells for t(14;16).

Efficacy
At the time of data cutoff for the first analy-
sis (October 30, 2014), the median follow-up 
was 14.8 months in the ixazomib group and 
14.6 months in the placebo group. As assessed 
by an independent review committee, 129 events 
of disease progression or death occurred in the 
ixazomib group and 157 in the placebo group. 
The median progression-free survival was 20.6 
months in the ixazomib group and 14.7 months 
in the placebo group and the hazard ratio for 
disease progression or death was 0.74 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.94; P=0.01), rep-
resenting a 40% longer progression-free survival 
with ixazomib plus lenalidomide–dexametha-
sone as compared with placebo plus lenalido-
mide–dexamethasone. Because the primary end 
point of progression-free survival was signifi-
cantly longer in the ixazomib group than in the 
placebo group, no further statistical testing of 
this end point was performed.
The benefit with respect to progression-free 
survival was consistent in all key prespecified 
patient subgroups (Fig. 1B), including patients 
with a poor prognosis, such as those with high-
risk cytogenetic abnormalities, those with Inter-
national Staging System stage III disease, those 
older than 75 years of age, and those who had 
received two or three prior therapies; no signifi-
cant interactions were observed between these 
subgroups and study-group assignment. The 
median progression-free survival among the 
patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormali-
ties (75 patients in the ixazomib group and 62 
patients in the placebo group) was 21.4 months 
and 9.7 months, respectively (hazard ratio for 
disease progression or death in the ixazomib 
group, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.92; P 
= 
0.02); the 
median progression-free survival among the 
patients with del(17p) (36 patients in the ixazo-
mib group and 33 in the placebo group) was 
21.4 months and 9.7 months, respectively (haz-
ard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.24), and, 
among the patients with t(4;14) without del(17p) 
or t(14;16) (36 patients in the ixazomib group 
and 25 in the placebo group), was 18.5 months 
and 12.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 
0.65; 95% CI, 0.25 to 1.66).
Overall rates of response were 78.3% in the 
ixazomib group and 71.5% in the placebo group 
(P 
= 
0.04) (Table 2). The responses were rapid 
and durable (Table 2) and deepened with in-
creasing duration of treatment (i.e., more people 
had a response and the type of response also got 
better over time, with more people having a very 
good partial response or a complete response) 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Because the primary end point of progres-
sion-free survival was significantly longer in the 
ixazomib group than in the placebo group and 
because the groups did not differ significantly 
with respect to overall survival at the first analy-
sis, a subsequent analysis of overall survival at a 
data-cutoff date of July 12, 2015, was performed; 
the median follow-up was 23 months. The me-
dian overall survival had not yet been reached in 
either study group; 171 deaths had occurred by 
the 23-month analysis (81 in the ixazomib group 
and 90 in the placebo group), which represents 
35% of the prespecified number of deaths re-
quired for final analysis of overall survival, and 
follow-up is ongoing (for additional details re-
garding the subsequent analysis, see the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Safety
Safety data were evaluated at both the first and 
second analyses. The safety profile with the lon-
ger duration of exposure (second analysis) was 
consistent with the safety profile with the 
shorter duration of exposure (first analysis). At 
the 23-month analysis, the safety population 
included 361 patients in the ixazomib group and 
359 in the placebo group (Fig. S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Patients in the ixazomib 
group received treatment for a median of 17 cy-
cles (range, 1 to 34), and those in the placebo 
group received treatment for a median of 15 cy-
cles (range, 1 to 34) (48% and 43% of patients in 
the respective study groups received treatment 
for ≥18 cycles, and 20% and 19% received treat-

was discontinued in 62% of the patients in the 
ixazomib group and in 63% of the patients in 
the placebo group (Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The main reasons for discontinua-
tion of the study regimen were disease progres-
sion, which was the reason for discontinuation 
in 34% of the patients in the ixazomib group 
and in 40% of the patients in the placebo group, 
and adverse events, which were the reason for 
discontinuation in 17% and 14% of the patients, 
respectively. The median relative dose intensity 
for lenalidomide and dexamethasone was simi-

Ixazomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone for Myeloma
are summarized in Table 3; the rates of serious 
adverse events, discontinuation of the study regi-
men because of adverse events, and death during 
the treatment period (recorded through 30 days 
after receiving the last dose of the study drug or 
placebo) were similar in the ixazomib group and 
the placebo group. The most common hemato-
logic and nonhematologic adverse events are 
summarized in Table 4.
Thrombocytopenia, an overlapping adverse 
event that is seen with ixazomib and lenalido-
mide–dexamethasone,14,17-19 was reported in 31% 
of the patients in the ixazomib group and in 
16% of the patients in the placebo group; throm-
bocytopenia of grade 3 and of grade 4 occurred 
more frequently in the ixazomib group (12% and 
7%, respectively) than in the placebo group (5% 
and 4%, respectively). Transient and cyclical de-
creases in platelet count were observed in both 
study groups. The rate of platelet transfusion 
was similar in the two groups (8% in the ixazo-
mib group and 6% in the placebo group), as were 
the rates of serious adverse events of thrombo-
cytopenia (2% in each group) and discontinua-
tion of the study regimen because of thrombo-
cytopenia (1% in each group).
Nonhematologic adverse events that have 
been observed to occur both with the use of ixa-
zomib and with the use of lenalidomide–dexa-
methasone include gastrointestinal events and 
rash.14,17-19 Gastrointestinal events were more 
common in the ixazomib group than in the pla-
cebo group, but they were observed primarily 
within the first 3 months after initiation of 
therapy and were low grade and manageable 
with supportive therapy; 22% of the patients in 
the ixazomib group and 19% in the placebo 
group received antidiarrheal agents, and 21% 
and 13%, respectively, received antiemetic drugs. 
The medical management of diarrhea included 
the use of antidiarrheal agents (primarily loper-
amide) and dose adjustment of lenalidomide or 
ixazomib. The incidence of rash (data were based 
on a standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities [MedDRA] query) was 36% in the ixazo-
mib group and 23% in the placebo group; the 
difference between groups was driven primarily 
by grade 1 and grade 2 events. The rash events 
occurred primarily in the first 3 months after 
initiation of the study regimen and were fre-
quently self-limiting; 21% of the patients in the 
ixazomib group and 12% in the placebo group

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
reported that the events had resolved without 
intervention. The medical management of rash 
included the use of antihistamines (primarily 
cetirizine) or topical glucocorticoids and dose 
adjustment to manage symptoms.
Peripheral neuropathy is a known side effect 
of bortezomib, a first-in-class proteasome inhibi-
tor.20 The incidence of peripheral neuropathy

ixazomib group and 15% in the placebo group), 
as well as in the rates of hypertension (6% and 
5%, respectively) and myocardial infarction (1% 
and 2%). At the 23-month analysis there was no 
significant difference in the rate of new primary 
malignant tumor (5% in the ixazomib group 
and 4% in the placebo group). At the 23-month 
analysis, EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-MY20 scores 
indicated similar patient-reported quality of life 
in the ixazomib group and the placebo group 
over the course of the follow-up (Fig. S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
This study showed that in patients with re-
lapsed, refractory, or relapsed and refractory 
myeloma, treatment with oral ixazomib plus 
lenalidomide–dexamethasone was associated 
with significantly longer progression-free sur-
vival — by a median duration of approximately 
6 months — than the progression-free survival 
observed with the use of placebo plus lenalido-
mide–dexamethasone. An overall survival bene-
fit has not yet been shown. On the basis of the 
data from this study, the Food and Drug Admin-
istration approved the use of ixazomib in com-
bination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
for the treatment of multiple myeloma in patients 
who have received at least one prior therapy.21
The benefit of the ixazomib regimen with 
respect to progression-free survival was observed 
consistently in all key prespecified subgroups, 
including in the subgroups of patients with a 
poor prognosis, such as elderly patients, those 
who have received two or three prior therapies, 
those with advanced-stage disease, and those with 
high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, for whom 
lenalidomide–dexamethasone has been shown 
to be a less effective treatment on the basis of 
emerging data.22 Data on median progression-
free survival suggest that an ixazomib regimen 
may improve the prognosis for patients with 
high-risk cytogenetic features, which have tradi-

This adverse event was reported in at least 20% of the patients in either group.
‡  
Data were based on a standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) query that incorporated pooled preferred terms or 
multiple preferred terms. “Thrombocytopenia” was coded according to the preferred terms of thrombocytopenia and decreased platelet 
count. “Neutropenia” was coded according to the preferred terms of neutropenia and decreased neutrophil count. “Peripheral neuropathy” 
represents the high-level term peripheral neuropathies not elsewhere classified, excluding neuritis; preferred terms included peripheral neu-
ropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and peripheral motor neuropathy.
§  
Data for the “standardized MedDRA query” for rash were based on a standardized MedDRA query that pooled 27 preferred terms; data for 
the “high-level term” for rash were taken from the high-level term of rashes, eruptions, and exanthems not elsewhere classified, according 
to the data on rash reported in the U.S. prescribing information.

In addition, grade 5 arrhythmia was reported in two patients in the ixazomib group and in three patients in the placebo group; grade 5 
thromboembolism was reported in one patient in each group; grade 5 hypotension was reported in one patient in the ixazomib group; 
grade 5 heart failure was reported in one patient in the ixazomib group and in three patients in the placebo group; and grade 5 myocardial 
 
infarction was reported in one patient in the ixazomib group and in two patients in the placebo group.

tionally been associated with a poor prognosis, 
by lengthening the progression-free survival to a 
point that is similar to that among patients with 
standard-risk cytogenetic features.23 In accor-
dance with the protocol, the cutoff values for 
defining the presence of these cytogenetic ab-
normalities were established by the central diag-
nostic laboratory on the basis of the false posi-
tive rates (or technical cutoff values) of the 
fluorescence in situ hybridization probes we used. 
These cutoff values differed from those used in 
other studies8,24,25; standard clinical cutoff values 
remain an area of investigation.
The reported clinical benefit in our trial is 
consistent with findings from previous reports 
that have shown triplet regimens to be more 
efficacious than doublet regimens4-8 — particu-
larly two previous studies of lenalidomide–dexa-
methasone plus a third agent versus lenalido-
mide–dexamethasone in patients with early 
relapsed multiple myeloma.8,24 However, the re-
sults with respect to response rates and median 
progression-free survival differ among the stud-
ies. In our study, the median progression-free 
survival was 20.6 months in the ixazomib group 
and 14.7 months in the placebo group; in the 
study by Stewart et al.,8 the median progression-
free survival was 26.3 months in the group that 
received carfilzomib plus lenalidomide–dexa-
methasone and 17.6 months in the group that 
received lenalidomide–dexamethasone alone, and 
in the study by Lonial et al.,24 the median pro-
gression-free survival was 19.4 months in the 
group that received elotuzumab plus lenalido-
mide–dexamethasone and 14.9 months in the 
group that received lenalidomide–dexamethasone 
alone. However, cross-trial comparisons are con-
founded by differences in study designs, methods, 
and patient populations (e.g., differences in the 
inclusion of patients with renal impairment, 
primary refractory disease, and measurable levels 
of disease as measured by serum free light-chain 
assay only). Nevertheless, the relative benefit of 
these triplet regimens over lenalidomide–dexa-
methasone, as evaluated by hazard ratios, ap-
peared to be consistent, with hazard ratios of 
0.74 (current study), 0.69,8 and 0.70.24
An increased focus on continuous thera-
py8,9,17,26,27 has heightened the need for regimens 
that have acceptable side-effect profiles, that 
allow quality of life to be maintained, and that 
are easy to administer. The duration of therapy 
with the ixazomib regimen was notable; almost 
half the patients had received treatment for at 
least 18 cycles at the 23-month analysis. The 
rates of adherence to the ixazomib regimen and 
the placebo regimen appeared to be high and 
were similar in the two groups, a finding that is 
consistent with the observed side-effect profiles; 
these findings suggest that the all-oral ixazomib 
regimen was as simple and convenient for pa-
tients to follow as the placebo regimen. No ad-
verse effect on quality of life was reported by the 
patients in the ixazomib group in this double-
blind study. In considering this finding in the 
context of quality-of-life data from other studies, 
it should be noted that there is a tendency to 
overestimate the benefit on quality of life in 
open-label studies.28 This finding should also 
be considered in the context of the limitations 
of existing instruments.29,30
The rates of serious adverse events, discontinu-
ation of the study regimen because of adverse 
events, and death during the study period were 
similar in the two groups, and the only adverse 
event of grade 3 or higher for which there was at 
least a 5% difference between the ixazomib and 
placebo groups was thrombocytopenia, a known 
side effect of bortezomib and carfilzomib,31,32 
for which there were no apparent clinical se-
quelae. No cardiac, renal, or respiratory safety 
signals were associated with the use of ixazo-
mib. The addition of ixazomib to a regimen of 
lenalidomide–dexamethasone resulted in a high-
er rate of peripheral neuropathy (27% in the ixa-
zomib group and 22% in the placebo group), 
and 2% of patients in the ixazomib group had 
grade 3 events, as compared with 6% of patients 
who received subcutaneous bortezomib33 and 3% 
of patients who received carfilzomib8 in other 
studies.
In conclusion, the addition of ixazomib to a 
regimen of lenalidomide–dexamethasone led to 
significantly longer progression-free survival in 
patients with relapsed, refractory, or relapsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma, with limited 
additional toxic effects; in consideration of its 
adverse-event profile and efficacy, this all-oral 
regimen provides an additional therapeutic op-
tion for patients with relapsed, refractory, or 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.34
