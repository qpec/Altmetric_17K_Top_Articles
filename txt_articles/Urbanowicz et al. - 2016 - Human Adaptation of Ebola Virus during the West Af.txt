SUMMARY
The 2013–2016 outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) in
West Africa was the largest recorded. It began
following the cross-species transmission of EBOV
from an animal reservoir, most likely bats, into hu-
mans, with phylogenetic analysis revealing the co-
circulation of several viral lineages. We hypothesized
that this prolonged human circulation led to genomic
changes that increased viral transmissibility in hu-
mans. We generated a synthetic glycoprotein (GP)
construct based on the earliest reported isolate and
introduced amino acid substitutions that defined
viral lineages. Mutant GPs were used to generate a
panel of pseudoviruses, which were used to infect
different human and bat cell lines. These data re-
vealed that specific amino acid substitutions in the
EBOV GP have increased tropism for human cells,
while reducing tropism for bat cells. Such increased
infectivity may have enhanced the ability of EBOV
to transmit among humans and contributed to the
wide geographic distribution of some viral lineages.
INTRODUCTION
Since its beginnings in December 2013, the West African
outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV; Makona variant) has resulted in
more than 28,000 confirmed or suspected cases and more
than 11,000 deaths (W.H.O., 2016). As with previous human out-
breaks, the West African epidemic began following the success-
ful cross-species transmission of EBOV from an animal reservoir
into humans, with mounting evidence that a number of bat spe-
cies are the likely natural reservoir and maintain the virus be-
tween human outbreaks (Leroy et al., 2005; Ogawa et al.,
2015). The successful ongoing transmission of viruses within a
new host species is often associated with the acquisition of
host-adaptive mutations (Moncla et al., 2016; Pepin et al.,
2010). Minor changes in the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) can impact
its ability to mediate viral entry into cells from different mamma-
lian species (Ng et al., 2015), such that it is clearly a major
component of host specificity and viral fitness. Although the evo-
lution of EBOV Makona during the West African outbreak was
characterized by the emergence and spread of genetically
distinct viral lineages (Carroll et al., 2015; Gire et al., 2014; Lad-
ner et al., 2015; Quick et al., 2016; Simon-Loriere et al., 2015;
Tong et al., 2015), it is unknown whether this prolonged human
circulation enabled the virus to better adapt to exclusively human
transmission. We speculated that a number of GP substitutions,
including those at potential N-linked glycosylation sites and
those within and around the mucin-like domain (Lee et al.,
2008), could affect GP-mediated entry and, in turn, facilitate hu-
man adaptation.
RESULTS
To identify GP amino acid changes that may have increased viral
transmissibility in humans, we compared 1,610 full-length
genome sequences of EBOV Makona viruses from the West Af-
rican outbreak of 2013–2016. These viruses were sampled from
Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Mali. Phylogenetic analysis of

 these sequences revealed the presence of two major lineages:
lineage A, which only comprised sequences obtained from
Guinea, including the earliest sampled viruses from the outbreak
as a whole; and lineage B, which contained a much larger num-
ber of sequences (including those previously assigned to line-
ages SL1, SL2, and SL3 [Gire et al., 2014]) from all of the affected
countries and hence has a far wider geographic distribution (Fig-
ure 1 and Data S1). Mapping all GP amino acid substitutions onto

Phylogenetic Tree of 1,610 Complete EBOV
Makona Genomes
The tree is color coded according to lineage, and
the
lineage-defining
amino
acid
substitutions
in the viral GP studied here are marked. To
enhance data display, monophyletic groups of
sequences were collapsed, and the tree was
vertically compressed in multiple sections. The
tree was rooted using the earliest Kissidougou-
C15 sequence, and all horizontal branch lengths

our whole-genome phylogeny revealed
that lineages A and B are distinguished
by a single Ala-Val amino acid substitu-
tion
in the receptor
binding domain
(RBD) of GP at residue 82 (A82V; Figure 1).
In addition, both lineages A and B con-
tained a number of sub-lineages that
were defined by additional amino acid
substitutions elsewhere in the GP (Fig-
ure 1 and Data S1).
To determine whether these lineage-
specific amino acid substitutions resulted
in more efficient human cell infection, and
hence increased fitness, we generated a
panel of GP mutants based on the earliest
sampled Makona isolate, Kissidougou-
C15
(GenBank:
KJ660346,
sampled
from Guinea in March 2014; Figure 2),
and tested their ability to support entry
into a range of human and bat cell lines
using a lentiviral pseudotype assay (Ur-
banowicz et al., 2016). Although variants
from both lineages A and B reached
higher infectivity in human cells than
Kissidougou-C15 (Figure 3), the A82V
change appears to have set the GP on
separate evolutionary pathways, as we
observed distinct sets of additional amino
acid
changes
in
each
lineage
that
increased entry efficacy in human cells.
However,
despite
the
evolutionary
diversification
that
was
apparent
in
both lineages, the V82 background (line-
age B) appeared conducive to reaching
higher infectivity than viruses with A82
(lineage A; Figure 3).
The A82V substitution (variant B1) alone resulted in an almost
2-fold increase in infectivity in human cells compared to the
reference Kissidougou-C15 strain (Figure 3; p < 0.01). Other
amino acid changes further increased the effect of A82V. For
example, R29K (variant B7), which falls within the GP signal
peptide, resulted in a major increase in entry efficacy. Similarly,
substitutions T206M (variant B12) and T230A (variant B13)
in the GP glycan cap, which resulted in a loss of conserved
1080
Cell 167, 1079–1087, November 3, 2016
 N-glycosylation branching at N204 and N228, respectively,
strongly increased GP entry in human cells. Subsequent substi-
tutions in the T230A cluster of EBOV sequences, such as T485A
(variant B14) in the mucin-like domain of GP or D637G at the end
of GP2 (variant B16), did not appear to modulate viral entry
further. Within the more geographically restricted lineage A,
variant A1, containing a single W291R substitution in the glycan
cap, resulted in a marked increase in entry efficacy in HuH7 and
BEAS-2B cells (Figure 3; p < 0.01).
These data also revealed the importance of epistatic interac-
tions to viral adaptation. In lineage A, we observed strong posi-
tive epistasis involving residue 330. Specifically, following an
initial G480D change, a P330S substitution occurred with either
N107D (variant A6) or H407Y after a reversion of G480D (variant
A5; Figure 1). Strikingly, the co-occurrence of P330S with G480D
evolved independently in lineage B (Data S1), compatible with
the idea that, in combination, these mutants increase fitness.
Indeed, in our HuH7 entry assay, mutants A5 and A6 were
significantly more entry efficient than the reference Kissidou-
gou-C15 strain (Figure 3; p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively).
In contrast, variants with the P330S substitution alone (mutant
A02), or in combination with either G480D (mutant A03) or
N107D (mutant A04), were all less infectious than the reference
sequence in HuH7 cells (p < 0.05); none of these changes were
sampled during the outbreak.
The impact of epistasis can also be seen within lineage B
involving glycan cap domain residues P202L and L239S. While
the initial P202L substitution (variant B4) decreased infectivity
in HuH7 cells compared to the A82V mutant, the subsequent
emergence of L239S (variant B6), which occurred in two different

 branches within this cluster (Data S1), resulted in significantly
higher infectivity than the A82V change alone in all human cell
lines tested (p < 0.01). Importantly, the L239S substitution alone,
which was not observed during the outbreak, did not result in
increased entry (variant B05; Figure 3). This again suggests that
fitness increases result from epistatic interactions.
GP residue 82 was also seemingly involved in epistatic interac-
tions. For example, the I371V change (variant B2), which defines
a large cluster of sequences from Sierra Leone (Data S1),
increased entry efficacy up to 2-fold in the 82V background (line-
age B). However, in the context of the 82A background that
defines lineage A, I371V (variant AB03) decreased HuH7 cell
infectivity (p < 0.001). The AB03 variant was not sampled during
the outbreak. Conversely, the presence of P375S, in association
with 82A, increased infectivity (variant AB011) but decreased
infectivity in the presence of 82V (variant B10; Figure 3).
While the majority of amino acid substitutions observed in the
outbreak improved human cell entry, some changes in lineage B,

 including R410S (variant B8), resulted in reduced fitness.
Notably, a subset of viruses in this cluster acquired an additional
K439E change (variant B9) that enhanced entry efficacy 3-fold
(p < 0.01) in HuH7 cells. Interestingly, a set of lineage B viruses
with R410S and K439E were sampled in a community of fisher-
men in Sierra Leone, characterized by an unusually severe
disease presentation (Capobianchi et al., 2015). Finally, it is
important to note that pseudovirus entry in one human cell line
correlated well with the infectivity observed in the other human
lines tested (Figures 3D–3F), indicating that the effect was inde-
pendent of the anatomical site from where the cells were derived.
Having seen evidence of adaptation to human cells, we next
determined whether EBOV evolution during the outbreak
impacted the entry into liver and kidney cell lines derived from
Hypsignathus monstrosus, one of the putative fruit bat hosts.
The most striking feature of this analysis was the general reversal
in infectivity compared to human cells (Figure 4); indeed, there
was a statistically significant negative correlation between infec-
tivity in H. monstrosus compared to human cell lines (Figure 5).
Obvious reversals in phenotype were apparent for individual mu-
tants. For example, the lineage B variant R410S (variant B8),
which resulted in low entry efficacy in human cells, was highly
efficient in infecting H. monstrosus cells. In contrast, the addi-
tional K439E substitution (variant B9), which enhanced infectivity
in human cells, abolished this effect (p < 0.05; Figure 4). This
pattern of decreased infectivity in fruit bat cells concomitant
with GP evolution was also observed for kidney cells derived
from Epomops buettikoferi (Figure S1A) and Rousettus aegyptia-
cus bats (Figure S1B), although the strength of the effect, and
hence the correlations of infectivity in human cells compared

shown in Figure 1, with gray bars indicating vari-
ants not sampled during the outbreak. These data

ences in the mean infectivity of each outbreak-

measures one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple

to these alternative fruit bat cells, were
less pronounced (Figure S2). Finally, we
assessed EBOV-GP-mediated entry in
cell lines derived from the insectivorous
bats Hipposideros abae and Myotis dau-
bentonii. Neither of these could be in-
fected by EBOV GP pseudoviruses but
were permissive for entry by PVs supplemented with control
VSV G protein (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Although the genome-scale evolution of EBOV during the West
African outbreak has been described in detail (Carroll et al.,
2015; Gire et al., 2014; Ladner et al., 2015; Quick et al., 2016;
Simon-Loriere et al., 2015; Tong et al., 2015), little is known
about whether the virus also experienced heritable changes in
phenotype during the outbreak, including adaptation to exclu-
sively human transmission. As selectively advantageous muta-
tions that spread through the viral population will fall on deeper
branches on the phylogeny, we identified a number of lineage-
defining GP amino acid substitutions and, using a pseudotype
entry assay, showed that many of these conferred increased hu-
man cell entry. Hence, these data strongly suggest that a number
of specific amino acid substitutions in EBOV, particularly
although not exclusively A82V, increased tropism for human
cells and facilitated adaptive evolution. Interestingly, the re-
ported increase in overall viremia in the Conakry (Guinea) area
during the summer of 2014 (Faye et al., 2015) is coincident
with the introduction of lineage B variants from Sierra Leone.
An accompanying manuscript from Diehl and colleagues in this
issue of Cell independently shows that A82V increased viral
infectivity in a variety of human primary cells and continuous
cell lines, supporting the hypothesis that A82V is a fitness adap-
tation (Diehl et al., 2016).
Residue 82 lies in a short a-helix (termed a1) of the RBD, which
is involved in binding the filovirus receptor protein Niemann-Pick
Cell 167, 1079–1087, November 3, 2016
1083
 C1 (NPC1). In the helix, residue 82 points toward the hydropho-
bic core of GP in the face opposing the one contacted by NPC1.
The crystal structure of the complex (Wang et al., 2016) shows
that the interaction with the receptor results in displacement
(gliding) of the helix along the hydrophobic core of the GP (Fig-
ure 6), implying that the nature of the side chain at position 82
will affect this gliding. Homology modeling (data not shown)
shows that the presence of valine instead of alanine makes the
a1 helix slightly protrude outward to accommodate the two extra
methyl groups of its side chain. Although the residues in bat
NPC1 that are directly contacted by the GP a1 helix are
conserved with respect to human NPC1, some changes fall
nearby, for instance, residue NPC1 127 (labeled in green in Fig-
ure 6), which is a charged lysine in human NPC1 and a hydropho-
bic isoleucine in bats. This could lead to a more favorable overall
interaction with human versus bat NPC1. Indeed, single substi-
tutions in the two protruding loops of NPC1 that contact the
GP were shown to restrict host susceptibility to EBOV (Ng
et al., 2015). The reduction of infectivity in bat cells associated
with the lineage-defining A82V substitution further highlights
the key role played by amino acid changes in and around the
a1 helix of the GP in modulating EBOV entry in different mamma-
lian hosts (Martinez et al., 2013). In addition, because there is a
rearrangement of the GP in the region of the a1 helix upon recep-
tor binding, it is possible that the A82V change may also affect
the dynamics of the conformational changes that occur during
the entry process. Indeed, a number of epistatic changes, for
example, I371V and P375S, were associated with residue 82,
and these observations hint at functional interactions between
the mucin-like domain, cleaved during GP priming, and the re-
ceptor-binding domain, which must be uncovered after cleavage
for NPC1 binding to take place (Figure 6A).
In addition to A82V, a number of additional amino acid
changes that arose during the outbreak also conferred increased
efficiency for human cell entry. One of these—R29K (variant
B7) —was located in the signal peptide, mutations in which
have previously been associated with changes in glycosylation
and the enhancement of infectivity (Marzi et al., 2006). Similarly,
mutations that resulted in the loss of conserved N-glycosylation
sites (T206M in variant B12 and T230A in variant B13, affecting
N-glycosylation on N204 and N228) strongly increased GP entry
into human cells. Removal of N-glycosylation sites has been
shown to enhance viral entry in vitro, although leaving the GP
more susceptible to neutralization (Lennemann et al., 2014).
Coincidently, amino acid substitutions that occurred following
the emergence of the T230A change (such as T485A; variant
B14 and D637G; variant B16), while not impacting cell entry,
may have been involved in immune escape. For example, the
threonine at residue 485 is a key determinant for binding by the
highly neutralizing antibody 14G7, in which any amino acid aside
from serine fully abolishes the interaction (Olal et al., 2012).
Correspondingly, T485A also had no effect on GP entry efficacy
in the context of A230T (variant B015; Figure 3). Similarly, the
R410S substitution, which lies in a B cell epitope that is a domi-
nant target for humoral responses (Capobianchi et al., 2015) and
does not improve viral entry, might also have been favored by
immune selection. Antibody protection underpins a number of
emerging vaccines and therapies, so it will be important for

 future studies to define the impact of GP evolution on antibody-
mediated immunity.
There is conflicting evidence on whether EBOV is restricted to
fruit bats (Leroy et al., 2005; Ogawa et al., 2015; Pourrut et al.,
2007; Swanepoel et al., 1996) or if it is also present in insectivo-
rous bat species (Han et al., 2016; Leendertz et al., 2016; Pourrut
et al., 2009; Swanepoel et al., 1996). For example, Marı
´ Sae
´ z
et al. (2014) suggested that the 2013–2016 outbreak might
have originated from a spill-over involving the insectivorous bat
species Mops condylurus, although no EBOV-positive wildlife
species have been documented in the area to date. Our finding
that Hipposideros abae and Myotis daubentonii insectivorous
bat cell lines were non-permissive for all the EBOV GP pseudo-
viruses lends credence to the hypothesis that fruit bats, rather
than insectivorous bats, are the likely natural reservoir for EBOV.
Overall, these data provide strong evidence that specific
amino acid substitutions in the EBOV glycoprotein that arose
during the 2013–2016 outbreak affect entry and increase tropism
for human cells while simultaneously reducing tropism for fruit
bat cells. These changes, involving various modifications in
glycosylation, as well as subtle structural changes in the receptor
binding a1 helix, may therefore have enhanced the ability of
EBOV to transmit among humans, particularly those viruses of
lineage B that spread to multiple countries throughout the
affected region. Although some studies have suggested that
the EBOV Makona genome carries signatures of positive selec-
tion compatible with adaptive evolution (Liu et al., 2015), others
have argued against this process (Azarian et al., 2015; Hoenen
et al., 2015; Olabode et al., 2015). Critically, however, all
these studies have relied exclusively on genome sequence
Figure 6. Residue 82 in the GPcl/NPC1-C
Complex
(A) Cartoon showing the organization of the GP
complex as anchored in the viral membrane,
colored according to domains as labeled (left). The
right panel shows the cleaved GP (GPcl), i.e., what
remains on the viral membrane after cathepsin
cleavage in the endosome, which eliminates the
glycan cap and the mucin-like domain (MLD) from
the GP trimer. The endosomal membrane and the
multiple transmembrane spanning protein NPC1
(Gong et al., 2016) are also shown, with domain C,
which is bound by cleaved GP, in orange, con-
tacted by the RBD of GP.
(B) Crystal structure of NPC1-C domain in complex
with GPcl (PDB 5F1B [Wang et al., 2016]). NPC1-C
is in orange, and residues that are different in bat
NPC1-C displayed in green and with sticks. GPcl is
shown in yellow, with the GP2 moiety in cyan (as in
the cartoon in A). Overlaid is the structure of the GP
complex in its pre-fusion form (gray, PDB 3SCY
[Lee et al., 2008]), which lacks the MLD but still
contains the glycan cap. The side chains of GP1
Y232 and NPC1-C Y134 are shown in sticks. The
a1 helix, which moves upon complex formation, is
indicated.
(C) Zoom of the region framed in (B), rotated to
better display the interactions. The ring of P80, the
first residue on the a1 helix, packs against the
phenol ring of Y232 within GP1 prior to cathepsin
cleavage. Removal of the 191–503 region after
cathepsin cleavage frees the a1 helix to interact
with NPC1-C, where Y134 takes the same place.
The helix packs against the side chains of W86 and
Y109, which remain relatively unchanged, while
A82 glides downward, accompanying the move-
ment of P80 to maintain the interaction with
NPC1-C Y134 in the complex. Because the envi-
ronment is different in bat NPC1, where residue
127 (labeled in green in (B)) changes from a
charged lysine to a hydrophobic isoleucine, our
data point to a more favorable interaction with the
human NPC1 by acquiring a valine at position 82.
(D and E) Same as (C) but showing, for clarity, only
the individual structures in the same orientation.

 comparisons without access to the types of experimental data
generated here that clearly demonstrate changes in viral pheno-
type. In addition, some comparative studies have ruled out
adaptive evolution by considering the EBOV phylogeny as a
whole, thereby failing to distinguish short-term evolution during
human outbreaks such as that in West Africa from the far longer
evolutionary history in the reservoir species (Olabode et al.,
2015).
Despite the experimental data provided here, it is impossible
to clearly establish whether the adaptive mutations observed
were in part responsible for the extended duration of the
2013–2016 epidemic. Indeed, it seems likely that the prolonged
nature of the outbreak in West Africa was primarily due to epide-
miological factors, such as an increased circulation in urban
areas that in turn led to larger chains of transmission. It is also
important to recall that EBOV has crossed the species barrier
from its reservoir hosts to humans on multiple occasions since
the first report of EBOV in 1976. Hence, most, if not all, animal
variants of EBOV have the ability to effectively transmit among
humans such that host adaptation is not a pre-requisite for
future outbreaks. Similarly, it is impossible on current data to
determine whether and how the amino acid substitutions
observed in the EBOV Makona genome might have impacted
pathogen virulence. However, because there is a strong positive
correlation between EBOV viremia and mortality (Faye et al.,
2015; Fitzpatrick et al., 2015; Schieffelin et al., 2014), increased
transmissibility could conceivably result in viruses of enhanced
virulence, although this clearly needs to be addressed with addi-
tional studies.

Therefore, we determined whether amino acid changes that defined deep nodes (i.e., major clusters of lineages, particularly lineages
A and B) on the EBOV Makona phylogeny resulted in more efficient human cell infection. Accordingly, a maximum likelihood phylo-
genetic tree was inferred using 1610 full-length sequences (sequence alignment of 18,996 nucleotides; dataset kindly provided by
Dr. Andrew Rambaut, University of Edinburgh; available from Virological.org and https://github.com/ebov/space-time) representing
EBOV Makona viruses sampled throughout the West African outbreak, utilizing the GTR+I+G model available in PhyML (Guindon
et al., 2010) and NNI branch-swapping. Lineage-specific GP amino acid substitutions were mapped onto this phylogeny, and the
robustness of individual nodes was provided by SH-like branch support values (Anisimova and Gascuel, 2006)
Construction of Ebola virus glycoprotein mutant panel
A codon-optimized version of Zaire ebolavirus GenBank: AKG65286.1, designated GIN_1316_opt, was commercially synthesized
and cloned into pCDNA3.1(+) by GenScript. Oligonucleotides (see Key Resources Table and Table S1) were designed using
NEBaseChanger (New England Biolabs) to introduce non-synonymous mutations into GIN_1316_opt by site directed mutagenesis
(SDM) using the Q5 SDM kit (New England Biolabs). Mutant plasmid clones were prepared with a GenElute mini kit (Sigma-Aldrich),
quantified by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop) and verified by Sanger sequencing (Source BioScience).
Transfection
Mutant plasmids were used to generate a panel of retroviral pseudoviruses (PVs). Transfections were performed as previously
described (Mohan et al., 2015; Urbanowicz et al., 2016). Briefly, 1.2x106 HEK293T cells were seeded overnight in a 10cm diameter
Primaria coated dish (Corning) in 10mL of DMEM supplemented with non-essential amino acids and heat-inactivated FBS. Trans-
fections were performed with 2 mg of phCMV MLV Gag/Pol, 2 mg of pTG126 Luciferase and 0.2 mg of EBOV GP, using 24 mL cationic
polymer transfection reagent (Polyethylenimine), in the presence of Optimem (Invitrogen), and the media replaced with 10mL com-
plete DMEM after 6 hr. Pseudovirus-containing supernatants were recovered after 72 hr, passed through a 0.45 mM filter and used
either immediately or stored at 4�C for a maximum of one week. PVs were generated using a Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) backbone
rather than HIV backbone as our preliminary experiments indicated that the bat cells had an effective HIV cellular restriction factor
(Besnier et al., 2003; Yap et al., 2014). This highlights the need to carefully consider the impact of cellular restriction when performing
PV experiments in different cell lines.
Pseudovirus infection assays
Using the previously harvested PVs, 100 mL aliquots, in triplicate, were used to infect 1.5x104 HuH7 cells or 2x104 for all other cells
(Key Resources Table) for 4 hr in a 96-well white plate (Corning). Following infection, 200 mL DMEM was added to the cells. Seventy-
two hours following infection, media was discarded, cells lysed with 50 mL Cell Lysis Buffer (Promega) and luminescence assessed
for each infection using a BMG Labtech FluoroStar Omega luminometer. PMT gain was set to 3600 and 50 mL of Promega luciferase
substrate was injected immediately before a one second luminescence reading. Using this protocol negative control readings
following addition of pseudoviruses bearing no glycoproteins routinely resulted in luminescence of between 0-100 Relative Light
Units (RLU), dependent on the experiment. Each infection was performed in triplicate and the amount of infectivity for each mutant
GP (measured in relative light units) was normalized to that observed for the initial EBOV Makona Kissidougou-C15 isolate sampled in
March 2014. No normalization to MLV Gag p30 was undertaken as previous studies (Herrera et al., 2005) have highlighted that PV
preparations contain a heterogeneous mix of core particles, GP-containing micro-vesicles and intact PV particles incorporating
various molar ratios of GP, making standardization difficult. In contrast, we have used the same PV preparations to infect the various
cells under study and have seen differences in infectivity in these different cells (bat versus human) using these same PV preps, mean-
ing that the differences observed were a property of the cell line permissiveness rather than anything to do with the PV prep (i.e., the
bat and human cells acts as reciprocal controls and increase in infectivity in one cell line and a concomitant decrease in the other is
unlikely to arise because of PV heterogeneity). While we do not feel that these experiments are valuable in the comparative study that
we performed, it is worth noting that the western blot analyses of PV particles in the accompanying manuscript (Diehl et al., 2016)
shows no difference in expression levels for the various mutants analyzed.

 QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data are presented as mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated in figure legends. Experimental repeats are indicated in figures and
figure legends. Data were analyzed using the repeated-measures one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test unless
otherwise indicated in figure legends. Correlations between infectivity observed in different cell lines were determined using Pearson
correlation. Data analysis was not blinded. Differences in means were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Significance
levels are: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; **** p < 0.0001; n.s., non-significant. Analyses were performed using the GraphPad
PRISM 6.05 software.

 Supplemental Figures
Figure S1. Infectivity of Pseudoviruses Supplemented with EBOV GP Mutants Observed in Kidney Cells from Two Different Fruit-Bat Spe-
cies, Related to Figures 4 and S2
(A and B) Relative infectivity of each glycoprotein was expressed as a proportion (%) of that observed for the Kissidougou-C15 strain in Epomops buettikoferi
kidney cells (EpoNi/22.1; A) and Rousettus aegyptiacus kidney cells (RoNi/7.1; B). Histogram bar colors correspond to the lineage color-coding shown in Figure 1.
These data are the means ± 1 SD of three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. Differences in the mean infectivity of each mutant compared to
the Kissidougou-C15 EBOV strain and the lineage B viruses to the A82V mutant were assessed using repeated-measures one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test and indicated in the table inset; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001; n.s., not significant.
