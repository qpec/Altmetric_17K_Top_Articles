ABSTRACT
We describe a nearly complete pedal ungual phalanx, discovered in the Kem Kem
Beds (Cenomanian) of Tafilalt region, south-eastern Morocco. The bone is
symmetric, pointed, low, elongate, and almost flat ventrally in lateral aspect. This
peculiar morphology allows to refer the specimen to the smallest known individual
of the genus Spinosaurus. The bone belongs to an early juvenile individual and it is
proportionally identical to the ungual of the third digit of a large partial skeleton
recently found, suggesting an isometric growth for this part of the pes and the
retention of peculiar locomotor adaptations—such as traversing soft substrates or
paddling—during the entire lifespan.

INTRODUCTION
In recent decades, several theropod remains have been reported from the mid Cretaceous
of North Africa (Sereno et al., 1994, 1996, 1998, Sereno, Wilson & Conrad, 2004; Russell,
1996; Riff et al., 2004; Dal Sasso et al., 2005; Mahler, 2005; Novas, Dalla Vecchia & Pais,
2005; Brusatte & Sereno, 2007; Sereno & Brusatte, 2008; D’Orazi Porchetti et al., 2011;
Ibrahim et al., 2014; Chiarenza & Cau, 2016; Hendrickx, Mateus & Buffetaut, 2016). Most
have been referred to abelisauroids and basal tetanurans (i.e., allosauroids and
spinosaurids) of medium to large body size. In May 1999, the Museo di Storia Naturale di
Milano, in collaboration with the Geological Service of Morocco and with the logistical
support of G. Pasini (Appiano Gentile, Italy), carried out a palaeontological expedition in
the southern part of the Errachidia Province, Morocco, focusing on invertebrate fauna
(Alessandrello & Bracchi, 2003). Some prospecting was also carried out in the Tafilalt
region, near Erfoud. Among fossil finds, there was an almost complete, very small pedal
ungual, surface collected by Pasini to the South of Erfoud, between the villages of Taouz
and Begaa (Fig. 1). This specimen remained unnoticed in the Vertebrate Paleontological
Collection of the Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano, until the recent discovery of a new
partial skeleton of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus published by Ibrahim et al. (2014), which
preserves an almost complete right pes with peculiar pedal ungual morphology. The
striking similarities with the pedal unguals of Spinosaurus allowed us to refer the isolated
specimen to this genus, of which it represents the smallest individual reported up to today.

 This fact is even more remarkable, considering the dramatic size attained by some large
specimens of Spinosaurus, which are possibly the longest, and among the largest theropod
dinosaurs ever found (Dal Sasso et al., 2005; Ibrahim et al., 2014).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The specimen described herein was legally collected and transported to Italy together
with the material published by Alessandrello & Bracchi (2003), in agreement with
the Geological Service of Morocco, and permanently deposited in the Vertebrate
Palaeontological Collection of the Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano (MSNM V), where
it is catalogued as MSNM V6894. In conformity with Weishampel, Dodson & Osmo
´lska
(2004), we adopt the following anatomical terms of the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria
(NAV 1994) and the Nomina Anatomica Avium (NAA 1993): plantar (opposite to the
back), dorsal (toward the back), proximal (toward the mass of the body), and distal
(away from the mass of the body). Specimen images were taken with a Canon PowerShot
S50, mounted on an ocular tube attached to a Leica MS5 stereomicroscope with Plan Apo
1.0� objective and carrier AX, then stacked with software Combine ZP.

 MSNM V6894 strongly resembles the pedal ungual phalanges associated to diagnosable
skeletal remains of specimen FSAC-KK18888, described by Ibrahim et al. (2014) and
defined as the neotype of S. aegyptiacus. MSNM V6894 shares with FSAC-KK18888 the
following diagnostic characters: pedal unguals with flat plantar surface; pedal unguals
broader than deep with length almost four times of the proximal depth. The overall
morphology, proportions, and pattern of furrows are also very similar (see “Description
and comparisons”). Following Ibrahim et al. (2014) we refer the ungual MSNM V6894 to
cf. S. aegyptiacus. The variability found in cervicodorsal vertebrae (Evers et al., 2015)
and quadrates (Hendrickx, Mateus & Buffetaut, 2016) might indicate a higher diversity
among the spinosaurid material from the Albian–Cenomanian of North Africa than
previously recognized. This proportional and morphological diversity may be related
to individual variability or sexual dimorphism, or it could be above the species level.
However, taking into account the low number of the known specimens, their low degree
of completeness, their apparently strict taxonomic affinities, their occurrence in the same
strata (or, more often, their uncertain stratigraphic provenance), and all the difficulties
and controversies in investigating these aspects and, ultimately, in defining a species in
palaeontology, we prefer to regard all the spinosaurid material (including pedal unguals)
from the Kem Kem Beds as belonging to cf. S. aegyptiacus, pending more complete,
articulated remains and reliable geological data. Further comments on this topic are
beyond the purpose of this paper.
Locality: MSNM V6894 comes from some kilometers south of Erfoud, between the
villages of Taouz and Begaa, Errachidia Province, Morocco (Fig. 1).
Horizon: Kem Kem Beds, Cenomanian, Upper Cretaceous (Sereno et al., 1996). The
specimen was collected by G. Pasini (2008, personal communication) together with rostral
teeth of the Aptian–Cenomanian elasmobranch Onchopristis sp. (Rage & Cappetta, 2002;
Russell, 1996).
Description and comparisons
The specimen MSNM V6894 is almost complete, except for the distalmost 2 mm of the tip
and most of the proximal articular surface (Fig. 2). Sediment remains are inset in the bone
pits and cemented in a few small patches on the bone surface, documenting the
provenance of the specimen from a fine grained sandstone layer. The general morphology
(i.e., shape, proportions, pattern of furrows) of MSNM V6894 strongly recalls that of
the pedal ungual phalanges of the partial skeleton FSAC-KK18888, that are articulated to
the rest of the pes (Fig. 3A; Ibrahim et al., 2014: fig. S1), and that of three isolated
unguals, the specimen MPCM 13574 (Novas, Dalla Vecchia & Pais, 2005: fig. 2), the
lost specimen Nr. 1922 X45 “Spinosaurus B” (Stromer, 1934: taf. I, figs. 17a–b; Ibrahim
et al., 2014: fig. S2D), and the unlabelled ungual reported by De Lapparent (1960: pl. VI,
figs. 10–12) and erroneously referred to Carcharodontosaurus. All these unguals are
nearly flat ventrally and greatly differ from the deeper recurved unguals of many other
Mesozoic theropods (Novas, Dalla Vecchia & Pais, 2005; Maganuco et al., 2007; Maganuco,
Cau & Pasini, 2008). Among the pedal unguals of the specimen FSAC-KK18888, the

 ungual of digit III is the most similar to MSNM V6894, due to its proportions and
symmetry. Based on these apparent features, we then refer MSNM V6894 to a pedal digit III.
The shape of this bone is slightly and continuously convex along its dorsal margin,
whereas its plantar surface is almost flat, especially on the preserved distal half of the bone,
thus resulting low and elongate in lateral aspect, and with sharply defined margins
separating the plantar surface from the medial and lateral sides. Both the lateral and
medial surfaces are slightly convex and bear a single, unforked vascular furrow extending
for most of the ungual length; these collateral furrows match the faint ungual curvature
in lateral aspect, and are located close to the plantar margin of the bone, flowing into
the plantar surface proximally. Two shallow semicircular depressions exist on the proximal
end of the plantar surface, as in MPCM 13574 (Novas, Dalla Vecchia & Pais, 2005: fig. 2C)
and FSAC-KK18888. The depressions are separated by a low median bump wider than
the ridge that can be seen in MPCM 13574 and in some pedal unguals of FSAC-KK18888.
A distinct flexor tubercle is absent on the plantar surface. In proximal view, the bone is
as tall as broad. The proximal articular surface is not well-preserved but it is faintly
divided in two sub-equal articular surfaces, it being slightly convex along the midline and
slightly concave on the preserved right side. The base of the proximodorsal lip (extensor
tubercle) is robust but the rest of the lip is eroded. Its preserved portion projects
proximally overhanging the proximal articular surface and it slopes proximodorsally
forming an angle of about 45� respect to the plantar surface of the bone. Numerous
foramina are present. The collateral furrows exhibit either the smoother surface or the
largest foramina, which are more numerous in the right lateral furrow.
Ontogenetic assessment
The ungual MSNM V6894 shows several features that indicate skeletal immaturity. The
bone surface is densely pitted, not only towards the distal tip (Fig. 2C), but also all
along its lateral and plantar sides/walls, whereas in the unguals of the subadult FSAC-
KK18888, nutrition pits are retained only within the collateral furrows. A porous texture,
with even more dense furrows and pits producing a “scarred” effect, is found in archosaur
hatchlings (Sanz et al., 1997; Horner, de Ricqle
`s & Padian, 2000; de Ricqle
`s et al., 2000),
and disappears gradually during growth, as it can be seen in immature extant crocodilians
(C. Dal Sasso & S. Maganuco, 2010, personal observation), and birds (L. M. Chiappe,
2006, personal communication). The scarred effect is marked on the limb bones of the
perinate and juvenile theropods, such as Scipionyx (Dal Sasso & Maganuco, 2011),
Sinornithoides (Currie & Dong, 2001), Juravenator (Go
¨hlich & Chiappe, 2006), the young
adult Sinosauropteryx (Currie & Chen, 2001), and extant birds (Tumarkin-Deratzian, Vann
& Dodson, 2006; Watanabe & Matsuoka, 2013).
In specimen MSNM V6894, the interior of the bone is also highly porous, as is well
exposed in proximal view (Fig. 2E). Under the cortex, which is limited to a 600–800 mm
thick layer, there are thin pillars of bone, with a honeycomb arrangement delimiting
large trabecular spaces. This indicates that the spongy bone was highly spongy and
vascularized. In sum, taking into account the degree of “scarring” and porosity of the
Maganuco and Dal Sasso (2018), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.4785
5/10
 bone, we estimate that the ungual MSNM V6894 pertained to a very young, but not
perinate spinosaurid.
The measurements of MSNM V6894, compared to those of the ungual phalanges of
FSAC-KK18888 (Table 1), in primis III-4 R, indicate fundamental growth isometry for
these bone elements. Minor morphological difference exists. For instance, the proximal
articular surface is slightly taller dorsopalmarly than wide mediolaterally, approaching
the compression index of the ungual that in adults occupy different (internal) positions
in the pes (e.g., I-2 and II-3 R in FSAC-KK18888); and the bone margins (or bony carinae)
underlying the collateral furrows do not possess the arrow-like, backward pointed apices
seen in some adult specimens (Stromer, 1934: taf. I, figs.17a–b).
Recently, Curry Rogers et al. (2016) found that the titanosaurian sauropod
Rapetosaurus, in spite of massive changes in body size, maintained isometric relationships
in the limb bones throughout ontogeny, which indicates an active precocial growth
strategy. Similarly, Mateus, Antunes & Taquet (2001) documented that the proportions of
presacral vertebral centra, between embryos and adults of the theropod Lourinhanosaurus,
are identical and even superposing in published graphs. On the other hand, non-
phalangeal elements of theropod hind limbs are reported to show significant allometry
(Holtz, 1995; Christiansen, 1998; Currie, 2003), affecting limb proportion and cursorial
potential.
CONCLUSION
The specimen described here improves the knowledge about the appendicular skeleton of
the spinosaurid theropods from the Kem Kem Beds (Late Cretaceous of Morocco)
published by Ibrahim et al. (2014).
The new material indicates that the pedal ungual phalanges of Spinosaurus grew with
isometry and it documents the smallest individual referable to Spinosaurus, a genus/taxon
usually indicated as the longest if not the largest theropod dinosaur (Dal Sasso et al.,
2005). The specimen FSAC-KK18888, with an estimated body length of 11 m, has
an ungual phalanx of digit III that is 130 mm long. Assuming isometry—although
isometrical scaling of the other parts of the spinosaur hind limb skeleton shown in Fig. 3

 must be considered as tentative—the 21 mm long ungual MSNM V6894 would pertain
to an early juvenile individual, 1.78 m long (Figs. 3B–3D), that is half the estimated
length of the smallest Spinosaurus published up to date, represented by the isolated
quadrate MNHN KK374 (Hendrickx, Mateus & Buffetaut, 2016).
According to Ibrahim et al. (2014), the unguals in Spinosaurus are reminiscent of
the flattened pedal unguals of shorebirds that do not perch (Manegold, 2006), and the
whole foot may have been adapted to traversing soft substrates or webbed for paddling.
We agree with this hypothesis although it needs to be tested in the future based on more
complete fossil remains and biomechanical analyses. The isolated tiny ungual here
referred to a small, early juvenile of Spinosaurus indicates that the pes had the same
locomotor adaptations observed in large individuals, that were probably achieved early
in ontogeny and retained for the entire lifespan.
