Clinical Practice
A 57-year-old woman has a fasting serum calcium level of 10.8 mg per deciliter 
(2.70 mmol per liter; reference range, 9.0 to 10.2 mg per deciliter [2.24 to 2.56 mmol 
per liter]) detected on routine laboratory testing. On repeat testing a week later, the 
level is 10.5 mg per deciliter (2.62 mmol per liter). The serum phosphorus level is 
2.4 mg per deciliter (0.75 mmol per liter), the estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) more than 60 ml per minute, the total serum protein level 7.0 g per liter, and 
the albumin level 4.0 g per liter. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is 95 pg per 
milliliter (reference range, 20 to 65). The patient’s last menstrual period occurred at 
54 years of age. She has no history of fracture or renal stones and no family history 
of hypercalcemia. Her mother fractured her hip slipping on ice at 70 years of age. 
How should this patient’s condition be evaluated and treated?
The Clinical Problem
I
n highly resourced health care systems, in which serum calcium is 
routinely measured, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism typically present 
with mild-to-moderate hypercalcemia and nonsuppressed or high PTH levels, 
measured in an immunoassay that predominantly detects intact hormone. The 
prevalence of the condition in the United States has been estimated at 23 cases per 
10,000 women and 8.5 per 10,000 men, with an incidence of 66 cases per 100,000 
person-years in women and 25 per 100,000 person-years in men.1 Patients with 
normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism have consistently normal serum calcium levels 
and have hypercalciuria less often than patients with hypercalcemic hyperparathy-
roidism, but they are not spared the skeletal complications of the disease.2 In one 
cohort of U.S. patients with mild-to-moderate hypercalcemia, approximately 50% 
underwent surgical treatment. During 15 years of follow-up, 30 to 40% of the 
remaining patients ultimately had surgery.3 In resource-limited health care set-
tings, patients present with more advanced disease,4,5 and those with few or no 
symptoms are presumably less likely to be evaluated or treated.
Approximately 80% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a single 
parathyroid adenoma, 10 to 11% have more than one adenoma, and less than 10% 
have hyperplasia of all four glands.6 Parathyroid carcinoma causes less than 1% of 
cases of hyperparathyroidism.
Symptoms
In resource-rich health care systems, less than 20% of patients present with overt 
symptoms. Occasionally, patients present with pain from a fracture or from renal

colic. Obtundation, neuromuscular weakness, or 
both from severe hypercalcemia are very uncom-
mon and are usually caused by a large adenoma or, 
in rare cases, parathyroid carcinoma. Moderate-
to-severe hypercalcemia can cause constipation 
and is a risk factor for pancreatitis (Fig. 1). De-
hydration or immobilization can worsen hyper-
calcemia. Hyperparathyroidism is not causally as-
sociated with peptic ulcer disease but, in multiple 
endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome, patients 
can have parathyroid tumors and gastrinomas. 
Fatigue, depression, and impaired memory are 
not infrequent, but a causal link between these 
conditions and parathyroid disease is uncertain. 
In resource-limited health care settings, patients 
present with higher serum calcium levels and 
are more often symptomatic.4,5
Complications
Biochemical Progression
In most asymptomatic patients, the serum and 
urine biochemical profiles remain stable for years. 
In one study involving 49 asymptomatic patients 
who did not meet criteria for surgery and who 
were followed without intervention for 15 years, 
only slight changes in serum and urine calcium 
and PTH levels occurred, although the number of 
patients who were followed beyond 5 years was 
small.3 In another study involving 73 patients 
with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism who un-
derwent observation for at least 5 years,7 5 patients 
(7%) underwent parathyroid surgery for hyper-
calcemia between years 3 and 5 (Bollerslev J: 
personal communication).
Bone Loss and the Risk of Fracture
Skeletal health is a frequent concern in hyper-
parathyroidism. In one study, 23% and 58% of 
patients with hyperparathyroidism had bone-
density values in the femur and radius, respec-
tively, that were less than 80% of that among 
age- and sex-matched persons who did not have 
the condition.8 In another study, it was estimated 
that 15% of patients with hyperparathyroidism 
had osteopenia in the lumbar spine.9 A more 
recent report included 4016 unselected patients 
undergoing bone densitometric measurements, of 
whom 451 had z scores for bone mineral density 
that were below −2.0 SD at either the spine or 
the femoral neck; of these patients, 52 (12%) had 
primary hyperparathyroidism, which suggested 
that the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism is 
higher among patients with low bone mineral 
density.10
Bone mass usually declines, albeit slowly, in 
patients with hyperparathyroidism. During a 15-
year observational study, spinal bone mineral 
density was preserved, whereas bone density in 
the femoral neck and radius slowly declined.3 
Nonetheless, studies have shown an increased 
risk of fractures of the spine, wrist, rib, and 
pelvis.11-13 Whether there is an increased risk of 
hip fracture is less clear: two studies showed a 
nonsignificantly higher risk of femur fracture 
(of the proximal femur in one study and the 
femoral neck in the other) in patients with hyper-
parathyroidism than in persons without the con-
dition.11,12 High rates of bone remodeling and 
impaired bone microarchitecture and quality may 
contribute to the risk of fracture.14
Key Clinical Points
Primary Hyperparathyroidism
• 
In primary hyperparathyroidism, serum calcium levels are elevated in the context of nonsuppressed 
parathyroid hormone levels. It is most often caused by a single parathyroid adenoma.
• 
Patients with mild hyperparathyroidism are at increased risk for renal stones, cortical bone loss, and 
fractures.
• 
Evaluation should include measures of serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 
glomerular filtration rate, 24-hour urine calcium excretion, and bone density (including the distal third of 
the radius), as well as a renal ultrasound examination to detect stones.
• 
Surgery is recommended for patients younger than 50 years of age and for patients with clinically 
significant hypercalcemia, osteoporosis or a fragility fracture, renal calculi, hypercalciuria (especially 
with a lithogenic urine biochemical profile), or impaired renal function.
• 
Medical management includes correction of dietary calcium and vitamin D insufficiency. Cinacalcet 
lowers serum calcium levels but does not affect rates of bone loss. Bisphosphonates improve bone 
density, but whether they reduce the risk of fracture is unknown.
• 
Surgery does not correct cardiovascular abnormalities in hyperparathyroidism, and whether it alleviates 
psychiatric and cognitive deficits is a subject of controversy.

Nephrolithiasis
In mild hyperparathyroidism, renal function is 
not compromised. Symptomatic renal stone dis-
ease is less frequent than in the past, at least in 
resource-rich health care systems. A U.S. referral 
urology service reported that 3% of 1190 adults 
who underwent evaluation for renal stones had 
hyperparathyroidism.15 The estimated prevalence 
of radiographically identified renal stones among 
patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in in-
dustrialized nations has ranged from 7 to 20%.16-18
As compared with the general population with 
renal stones, patients with hyperparathyroidism 
and renal stones have higher 24-hour urinary cal-
cium levels15 and higher serum 1,25-dihydroxy-
vitamin D levels, whereas serum calcium, PTH, 
and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are not signifi-
cantly different.19,20 Hypocitraturia and hyperoxal-
uria are also reported risk factors for renal stone 
disease in these patients.21 Patients with mixed 
calcium oxalate–apatite stones (apatite content 
>5% and <30%) or pure apatite stones may be 
more likely to have hyperparathyroidism than 
patients with renal stones that are more than 
90% calcium oxalate.22
 
Neuropsychiatric Disease
Depression, anxiety, and difficulty with memory 
and concentration are frequently observed in pa-
tients with primary hyperparathyroidism. How-
ever, the pathogenesis of these disorders in hyper-
parathyroidism is uncertain.
 
Cardiovascular Disease
The incidence of hypertension, changes in left 
ventricular mass and function, and other adverse 
cardiac changes have been observed to be higher 
among patients with primary hyperparathyroidism 
than in the general population.23 Observational 
studies have reported increased risks of death 
from any cause and death from cardiovascular 
causes in patients with hyperparathyroidism.24,25

Clinical Practice
Str ategies and Evidence
Diagnosis and Evaluation
In addition to calcium levels that are usually 
high and associated PTH levels that are not ap-
propriately suppressed (and therefore inappropri-
ately normal or high), serum levels of 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D are usually normal or low-normal in 
patients with hyperparathyroidism. These normal 
or low-normal levels of serum 25-hydroxyvita-
min D are found in part because PTH increases 
conversion of this metabolite to 1,25-dihydroxy-
vitamin D; levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D are 
correspondingly often high or high-normal.
Primary hyperparathyroidism should be dis-
tinguished from other causes of elevated levels 
of intact PTH. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, a 
physiologic response to hypocalcemia, is seen in 
association with severe vitamin D deficiency, 
intestinal calcium malabsorption, and chronic 
kidney disease (Table 1). Tertiary hyperpara-
thyroidism occurs in some patients with end-
stage renal disease when chronic hypocalcemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, and impaired synthesis of 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D lead to parathyroid 
hyperplasia and eventually to hypercalcemia.
Several uncommon genetic disorders also cause 
hyperparathyroidism. Patients with familial hypo-
calciuric hypercalcemia type 1 have heterozy-
gous loss-of-function mutations in the calcium-
sensing receptor and lifelong modest elevations 
in serum calcium with low calcium excretion in 
the urine.26 These patients generally do not re-
quire treatment. Hyperparathyroidism due to four-
gland hyperplasia is seen in multiple endocrine 
neoplasia type 1 and type 2 syndromes.27 Pa-
tients with the hyperparathyroidism–jaw tumor 
syndrome often have more severe hypercalcemia 
than do patients with sporadic disease due to a 
benign adenoma but can present with what ap-
pears to be typical primary hyperparathyroid-
ism.27 They are at increased risk for recurrent 
disease and parathyroid carcinoma. In these 
genetic syndromes, a detailed family history is 
the most important diagnostic tool, followed by 
genetic testing if appropriate.
Long-term lithium therapy can cause a clini-
cal picture indistinguishable from hyperparathy-
roidism. Although thiazide diuretics are often 
cited as worsening hypercalcemia in patients 
with hyperparathyroidism, this may not be the 
case in those with mild disease (serum calcium 
level, <11.5 mg per deciliter [<2.88 mmol per 
liter]; serum PTH level, <2.5 times the upper 
limit of the normal range).28 Primary hyperpara-
thyroidism is uncommon among children and 
adolescents; when it occurs, the levels of calcium 
in serum are often higher and germline muta-
tions more frequent than among adults.
After the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism 
has been made, if there is clinical concern about 
nephrolithiasis, a renal ultrasound examination 
should be ordered. A 24-hour urine calcium 
measurement can aid in assessing the risk of 
stone formation. The effects of hyperparathy-
roidism on bone density are assessed by bone 
densitometry at the spine and hip, as well as in 
the distal third of the radius, which is a corti-
cally enriched site and is particularly sensitive to 
the effects of hyperparathyroidism.8,9
Surgical Management
Surgery remains the only definitive treatment for 
hyperparathyroidism. Guidelines from the 4th 
International Workshop29,30 recommend surgery 
for patients whose serum calcium level is more 
than 1.0 mg per deciliter (0.24 mmol per liter) 
above the upper limit of the normal range, for 
patients younger than 50 years of age, and for 
men and perimenopausal or postmenopausal 
women 50 years of age or older who have T scores 
of −2.5 or lower at a central bone densitometry 
site or in the distal third of the radius or who 
recently have had a fragility fracture. A glomeru-
lar filtration rate of less than 60 ml per minute, 
renal stones, and a urine calcium level of more 
than 400 mg per day (10.0 mmol per day) (par-
ticularly if the hypercalciuria is accompanied by 
urine biochemical measures that are indicative 
of an increased risk of stone formation) are each 
considered indications for surgery. In patients 
with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism, these 
same criteria apply, with the exception of the 
serum calcium criterion. The American Associa-
tion of Endocrine Surgeons also recommends 
surgery for hyperparathyroidism accompanied by 
neurocognitive or neuropsychiatric findings like 
those quantified using the Short Form 36 Gen-
eral Health Survey, although they note that the 
strength of evidence is weak (see below).31
Although parathyroid imaging is not necessary 
to establish a diagnosis of primary hyperparathy-
roidism, four preoperative imaging methods are 
routinely used to localize abnormal parathyroid

Clinical Practice
tissue32,33 (Table 2 and Fig. 1, and Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org). Precise preop-
erative localization enables minimally invasive 
parathyroidectomy, in which a single offending 
adenoma can be resected with limited operative 
time (15 to 20 minutes) — sometimes using just 
a cervical block with sedation.
Surgical treatment of hyperparathyroidism 
should incorporate intraoperative PTH measure-
ments where available. After removal of a single 
adenoma, the intraoperative PTH should decrease 
by at least 50% and into the normal range.34 
Intraoperative measurements of PTH are particu-
larly valuable when more than one gland is ab-
normal (Fig. 2). In centers with expertise in 
parathyroid surgery, cure rates are above 95%.6,35 
Recurrent hyperparathyroidism after surgery 
occurs infrequently, but, in experienced hands, a 
second procedure is often curative. In multigland 
hyperplasia, the goal is to reduce the mass of 
abnormal tissue to normalize the serum calcium 
level without causing permanent hypoparathy-
roidism. Complications are rare when the proce-
dure is performed by an experienced surgeon. 
Potential complications (all uncommon) include 
recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (<1% of cases), 
wound infection, and bleeding. Postoperative 
transient hypocalcemia (usually mild) occurs in 
15 to 30% of cases but can be minimized by the 
appropriate use of calcitriol and supplemental 
calcium.36
Surgical cure is followed by an increase in 
bone mass in increments in the range of 2 to 4% 
in the first postoperative year.37-40 Consequently, 
it is prudent, except in severe cases, to withhold 
antiosteoporotic therapy after surgery until it is 
clear to what extent bone mass has improved. 
Preoperative serum levels of c-telopeptide of 
type 1 collagen are correlated with the degree of 
gain in bone mass after surgery.41 In a 15-year 
retrospective study, patients who received a sur-
gical cure had a 10-year absolute risk of hip 
fracture that was 64% lower than that among 
patients who had not received any treatment.42 
An earlier controlled cohort study also reported 
a 50% lower risk of hip and upper arm fracture 
in association with surgery.43 Successful surgical 
cure is associated with a lower risk of recurrent 
stone passage,44,45 and the urine calcium level 
usually declines.
Randomized, controlled trials have not consis-
tently shown alleviation of hyperparathyroidism-
related neurocognitive and emotional symptoms 
after surgical cure.46 Similarly, whether surgery 
reduces the cardiovascular disease risk associated 
with hyperparathyroidism remains unclear. Ob-
servational data and follow-up data from random-
ized trials comparing parathyroidectomy with 
observation have shown no significant improve-
ment in blood pressure or markers of metabolic 
syndrome47 and have shown, at most, modest 
changes in echocardiographic measures.48,49

calciuria in hyperparathyroidism. The guidelines 
for medical monitoring30 recommend annual 
measurement of serum calcium levels and repeat 
measurements of bone density (spine, hip, and 
radius) annually or biennially, with radiographs 
of the spine or vertebral fracture assessment if 
height loss occurs or there are symptoms of a 
vertebral facture. Imaging of the kidneys and 
a 24-hour urine biochemical profile to assess the 
risk of renal stone formation are recommended 
annually for patents with a history of renal 
stones or prevalent renal calculi.
 
Vitamin D and Calcium
Deficiencies in vitamin D and dietary calcium 
worsen hyperparathyroidism, so patients should 
have a calcium-sufficient diet (1000 to 1200 mg 
per day) and maintain a serum 25-hydroxyvita-
min D level in the range of 20 to 30 ng per milli-
liter, with the use of vitamin D supplements as 
Figure 2. Parathyroid Hormone Measurements before and after Parathyroid Resection.
Shown are the intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurements in a 59-year-old woman with osteoporosis who 
was found to have a serum calcium level of 10.4 mg per deciliter (2.60 mmol per liter), a serum phosphorus level 
of 2.4 mg per deciliter (0.75 mmol per liter), a parathyroid hormone level of 122 pg per milliliter, a serum creatinine 
level of 0.8 mg per deciliter (70 μmol per liter), a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 37 ng per milliliter, and a urine calcium 
level of 241 mg per day (6.0 mmol per day). After resection of the left inferior parathyroid adenoma, the intraopera-
tive parathyroid hormone level did not drop appropriately. Resection of the right inferior parathyroid adenoma resulted 
in normalization of the intraoperative parathyroid hormone level. Nine days after surgery, the serum calcium level 
was 8.9 mg per deciliter (2.22 mmol per liter) and the parathyroid hormone level was 15 pg per milliliter.

Clinical Practice
necessary.50 Although calcium supplements do 
not worsen hypercalcemia in most patients with 
mild disease,51 dietary sources of calcium are 
always preferred, and patients should be care-
fully monitored if supplements are prescribed. 
Hydration is important, to prevent worsening 
hypercalcemia and reduce the risk of nephroli-
thiasis.
Calcimimetic Therapy
Cinacalcet is an allosteric activator of the calcium-
sensing receptor and in hyperparathyroidism sen-
sitizes that receptor to serum calcium which, 
when activated, suppresses the secretion of PTH.52 
In a double-blind, randomized trial, after 1 year 
of treatment, the serum calcium level was 1 mg 
per deciliter lower and the mean PTH level 19% 
lower among patients with hyperparathyroidism 
who received cinacalcet than among those who 
received placebo, but cinacalcet had no signifi-
cant effect on bone loss. In the 4.5-year open-
label extension study in which all the patients re-
ceived cinacalcet, serum calcium levels remained 
normal and PTH levels remained below baseline 
at the end of the study, but there continued to be 
no substantial change in rates of bone loss.53
Antiresorptive Therapy
A meta-analysis of 25 observational studies and 
8 randomized, controlled trials evaluating sur-
gery as compared with bisphosphonate therapy 
showed similar increases in bone mass in the 
spine and femoral neck at 1 year in the two 
treatment groups. Fewer data were available for 
analysis at 2 years, but the increase in bone mass 
was still similar in the two groups.39 Data from 
long-term studies or studies with fracture as an 
outcome that can inform the use of anti-resorp-
tive therapy in primary hyperparathyroidism are 
limited. Oral bisphosphonates do not correct the 
hypercalcemia in hyperparathyroidism.
Thiazide Diuretics
In a retrospective analysis involving 72 patients, 
hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg to 50 mg daily) was 
found to significantly reduce urinary calcium and 
parathyroid hormone levels with no increase in 
serum calcium.28 Because reducing urinary cal-
cium excretion reduces the risk of calcium stone 
disease,54 thiazides may be considered for hyper-
calciuric patients who are deemed at risk for 
nephrolithiasis. Careful monitoring of blood cal-
cium is still advisable.
Areas of Uncertainty
The relationship between neurocognitive and 
emotional problems and hyperparathyroidism re-
mains unclear. There is heterogeneity in the end-
organ effects of similar levels of hyperparathy-
roidism and in the response to changes in 
calcium intake.55 Research is needed to better 
predict which patients who do not meet the cri-
teria for surgery are at greatest risk for fracture 
and other complications. Although rates of sur-
gical cure are high, late recurrences still occur 
in what appears to be sporadic primary hyper-
parathyroidism, so a more comprehensive under-
standing of disease pathogenesis is still needed.
Conclusions and 
Recommendations
The patient described in the vignette appears to 
have mild hyperparathyroidism, given her mild 
hypercalcemia, normal eGFR, and absence of 
complications, but further evaluation is warrant-
ed. The maternal history of fragility fracture in-
creases her risk of fracture. She is early in meno-
pause and may have accelerated bone loss because 
of both estrogen deficiency and parathyroid dis-
ease. If a bone densitometric study shows a T score 
of −2.5 or less at any site, I would recommend 
surgery. Sonographic evidence of renal stones or 
a urine calcium level of more than 400 mg per 
day, particularly if accompanied by hyperoxal-
uria or hypocitraturia, would prompt a surgical 
referral.
If the patient does not have indications for 
surgery now or prefers medical management, I 
would advise a calcium-sufficient diet (1000 mg 
per day) and use a vitamin D supplement if nec-
essary to maintain her serum 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D level in the range of 20 to 30 ng per milliliter. 
I would stress the importance of hydration and 
encourage regular exercise. If her urine calcium 
level was higher than 400 mg per day, I would 
consider using a thiazide. If her bone density 
was in the osteoporotic range, I would discuss 
antiresorptive therapy. I would see her annually 
to reassess her symptoms and biochemical pro-
file and would repeat the renal ultrasound ex-

ed the presence of a renal stone. Depending on 
her baseline bone mineral density and whether 
antiresorptive therapy was initiated, I would re-
peat the bone densitometric study in 2 years.
