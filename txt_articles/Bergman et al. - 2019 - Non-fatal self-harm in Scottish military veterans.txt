Abstract
Purpose Although suicide risk in veterans has been widely studied, there is little information on the risk of non-fatal self-
harm in this population. We used data from the Scottish Veterans Health Study to conduct an epidemiological analysis of 
self-harm in veterans, in comparison with people who have never served.
Methods We conducted a retrospective, 30-year cohort study of 56,205 veterans born 1945–1985, and 172,741 people with 
no record of military service, and used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between veteran status 
and cumulative risk of non-fatal self-harm, overall and stratified by birth cohort, sex and length of service. We also examined 
mental and physical comorbidities, and association of suicide with prior self-harm.
Results There were 1620 (2.90%) first episodes of self-harm in veterans, compared with 4212 (2.45%) in non-veterans. The 
difference was statistically significant overall (unadjusted HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.21–1.35, p < 0.001). The risk was highest in 
the oldest veterans, and in the early service leavers who failed to complete initial training (unadjusted HR 1.69, 95% CI 
1.50–1.91, p < 0.001). The risk reduced with longer service and in the intermediate birth cohorts but has increased again in 
the youngest cohort.
Conclusions The highest risk of non-fatal self-harm was in veterans with the shortest service, especially those who did not 
complete training or minimum engagement, and in the oldest birth cohorts, whilst those who had served the longest were at 
reduced risk. The risk has increased again in the youngest veterans, and further study of this subgroup is indicated.

Introduction
In recent years provision for the health and welfare needs 
of veterans has assumed increasing importance [1], and it 
is acknowledged that the planning of effective support has 
to be underpinned by sound data [2]. The Scottish Veterans 
Health Study was conceived in order to demonstrate areas 
where the health of military veterans in Scotland differed 
fom that of the wider non-veteran population, and thereby 
act inter alia as a needs assessment to identify where specific 
support or intervention may be required [3].
A number of studies have examined suicide in UK mili-
tary veterans [4–7], and other studies have looked at suicidal 
ideation in recently deployed US veterans [8], but to date 
there has been little research on the longer term risks of 
non-fatal self-harm in the overall veteran population [9], par-
ticularly in the UK where risks are known to differ from the 
US military population [10]. This represents an important 
knowledge gap since self-harm is a recognised risk factor for 
subsequent suicide [11] and may act as a pointer to unmet 
welfare needs.
Non-fatal self-harm encompasses both failed suicide and 
events having no suicidal intent; conversely, suicide may 
encompass events where a fatal outcome was not intended 
but the lethality of the method was not appreciated. Intent is

rarely documented and, therefore, at a population level, it is 
necessary to consider all non-fatal episodes together.
We used data from the Scottish Veterans Health Study, a 
retrospective cohort study of 57,000 veterans and 173,000 
matched non-veterans, to examine the epidemiology of non-
fatal self-harm over a 30-year period in a broad national 
cohort of veterans in Scotland, irrespective of combat or 
deployment, in comparison with people having no record of 
military service. We investigated the association between 
suicide and a previous episode of self harm. We also exam-
ined a range of comorbidities and explored potential risk 
factors for self-harm so far as was feasible within the avail-
able retrospective dataset.
Methods
The Scottish Veterans Health Study is a retrospective cohort 
study of all 56,570 military veterans in Scotland who were 
born between 1945 and 1985, who were resident in Scotland 
and were registered with the National Health Service (NHS) 
Scotland both before and after service, and a comparison 
group of 172,753 individuals with no record of service 
(‘non-veterans’), matched 3:1 for age, sex and postcode sec-
tor of residence (mean population 5,000). We used Scottish 
linked health records (which cover all individuals registered 
with NHS Scotland) and mortality data to compare long-
term risk of suicide and major self-harm in veterans and 
non-veterans, obtaining a single retrospective data download 
as at 31 December 2012. The study cohort and methods have 
been described in detail previously [12], and the findings 
in respect of suicide have recently been published [7]. This 
paper examines non-fatal self-harm leading to hospitalisa-
tion, encompassing both non-suicidal intent and failed sui-
cide. Baseline demographic data, including veteran status 
and dates of entering and leaving military service for veter-
ans, were provided by NHS electronic registration records. 
Reservists with no regular military service were excluded 
as their veteran status cannot be determined from the NHS 
registration record. The data were linked at an individual 
level to routine acute hospital and mental healthcare data 
(Scottish Morbidity Record SMR01 and SMR04) and death 
certificates to identify episodes of self-harm. The maxi-
mum period of follow-up was from 1 January 1981 to 31 
December 2012; veterans were followed up from the point 
of leaving military service if later than 1 January 1981. The 
data extract was pseudo-anonymised and approval for the 
study was granted by the Privacy Advisory Committee of 
the Information Services Division of NHS Scotland.
Socio‑economic status
Socio-economic status (SES) was derived from the most 
recent registered postcode of residence, using the Scottish 
Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), in quintiles ranging 
from 1 (most deprived) to 5 (least deprived). SIMD is calcu-
lated on a regional basis, in data zones having a mean popu-
lation of 800, and is based on income, employment, health, 
education (including skills and training), housing, crime and 
access to services [13] to provide a comprehensive measure.
Definitions
‘Non-fatal self-harm’ was defined as the first occurrence of 
ICD10 code X60-X84, Y87.0, Y10-Y34 or Y87.2, or ICD9 
codes E950-E959 or E980-E959, at any position in the 
record other than the cause of death, excluding any indi-
vidual whose death was classified as suicide [4] or whose 
date of death was the same as the recorded date of self-
harm, whilst suicide was classified as the occurrence of 
any of the specified ICD codes in the cause of death field. 
‘Early service leavers’ (ESL) were defined as veterans who 
had left with 2.5 years’ service or less. Although shorter 
than the current 4-year minimum period of service, this 
ensured that veterans who completed the earlier minimum 
of 3 years’ service were not incorrectly classified as ESL 
[14]. Veterans having 0.4 years’ service (20 weeks) or less 
were categorised as not having completed initial training.
Statistical methods
Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the 
association between veteran status and cumulative risk of 
self-harm, using age as the time-dependent variable, age 
at first admission for self-harm as the failure time, and 
age at death (if no self-harm) as the censor time. The use 
of a time-dependent analysis (Cox proportional hazards) 
protects against immortal time bias [15, 16]. Cox pro-
portionality assumptions were tested using methodology 
based on Schoenfeld residuals [17]. The log-likelihood test 
was used to test for interactions between veteran status, 
mental health co-morbidity and length of service. The a 
priori rejection level was set at 0.05. The models were 
run univariately and then repeated adjusting for SES. The 
analyses were repeated stratifying by grouped year of birth 
to examine potential birth cohort effects, and by length of 
service. The association between suicide and a previous 
episode of non-fatal self-harm was examined, as were co-
morbidities with non-fatal self-harm. All analyses were 
performed using Stata® v12.1.

Results
Main findings
After data cleansing to remove incomplete or invalid records, 
56,205 (99.3%) veterans and 172,741 (99.9%) non-veterans 
were included in the analysis. There were 50,970 (90.7%) 
male veterans and 5,235 (9.3%) female, reflecting the gen-
der balance of the UK armed forces. The mean period of 
follow-up was 29.3 years, and there was a total of 6.7 million 
person years of follow-up among veterans and non-veterans 
combined. The non-veteran group may have included an 
estimated 327 people who were Reservist veterans (0.2%).
Overall, 1620 (2.90%) veterans had a record of a first 
episode of admission to an acute or psychiatric hospital 
following non-fatal self-harm, compared to 4212 (2.45%) 
non-veterans. Veterans were at statistically significantly 
increased risk, unadjusted HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.21–1.35, 
p < 0.001 (Fig. 1). The difference was slightly attenu-
ated after adjusting for SES but remained highly signifi-
cant, HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.14–1.27, p < 0.001. Testing for 
non-proportionality of the hazards was non-significant, 
p = 0.124. The Nelson-Aalen plot (Fig. 1) demonstrated 
a sharp increase in risk in the youngest veterans, and a 
further steep increase in middle age.
Sex, age, and birth cohort
The increase in risk was only significant for men (Table 1); 
for women, the statistical power was reduced on account 
of the smaller number of cases, and may have been insuf-
ficient to demonstrate a statistically significant difference. 
The mean age at first episode of self-harm was 41.9 years 
(SD 9.5) for male veterans, compared with 40.1 years 
(SD 9.5) for male non-veterans. In women the mean age 
was 38.9 years (SD 10.1) for veterans and 37.5 years (SD 
10.7) for non-veterans. Subgroup analysis by birth cohort 
showed a U-shaped curve, with the highest risks in both 
in the oldest (1945–1949) and the youngest (1980–1985) 
birth cohorts, consistent with the pattern of risk demon-
strated by the Cox proportional hazard model. Veterans 
born between 1965 and 1979 showed no significant dif-
ference in risk from non-veterans (Fig. 2).

Length of service
Analysis by length of service showed that the increase in risk 
was almost entirely confined to ESL, with the highest risk in 
those who did not complete training, unadjusted HR 1.69, 
95% CI 1.50–1.91, p < 0.001. Older veterans with between 
4 and 9 years’ service also showed an increase in risk but 
when stratified by birth cohort, the risk was only increased 
beyond 6 years of service in those born before 1960. The 
risk was reduced, in comparison with non-veterans, in older 
veterans with over 16 years’ service, although veterans born 
from 1960 showed a reduction in risk for all lengths of ser-
vice beyond 6 years. (Table 1).
The kernel density plot for the youngest (1980–1985) 
birth cohort, comparing age at first episode of self-harm in 
Early Service Leavers against matched non-veterans, shows 
that these veterans have fewer pre-service (age 16 and under) 
episodes but a peak in the early 20s (Fig. 3).
Association with suicide
We examined data on 266 veterans and 901 non-veterans 
who died as a result of suicide. Of these, 50 (18.80%) vet-
erans had a record of a previous episode of self-harm, as 
did 176 (19.53%) non-veterans. The difference was not sta-
tistically significant, p = 0.860. The median elapsed time 
between the first recorded episode and the fatal episode was 
2.0 years for veterans (IQR 0.4–4.3), whilst for non-veterans 
it was 2.4 years (IQR 0.5–5.8), although the range extended 
to 13 years for veterans and 23 years for non-veterans. The 
mean age at suicide for veterans with a previous history of 
self-harm was 45.5 years (SD 7.9), compared with 43.6 years 
(SD 8.1) for veterans with no such history, whilst for non-
veterans it was 41.6 years (SD 8.6) compared with 41.1 years 
(SD 9.8). Only 9% of veterans who died as a result of suicide 
aged under 30 had a previous recorded episode of self-harm, 
whilst for veterans aged 50 and over at suicide, the figure 
was 26%. For non-veterans, the change was less marked and 
the corresponding figures were 16% and 19%.
Co‑morbidities
Fifty per cent of veterans and 46% of non-veterans who were 
admitted following self-harm also had a recorded secondary 
care diagnosis of mental health disorder (mood disorder, 
anxiety including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or 
psychosis), either concurrently or on a separate occasion, 
compared with 5% of the wider veteran population and 4.5% 
of the non-veterans (Table 2). Of these, the commonest was 
mood disorder (37% of veteran cases and 35% of non-veter-
ans). A diagnosis of severe stress or PTSD was recorded in 
17% of veterans and 12% of non-veterans who self-harmed. 
Testing for interaction between severe stress/PTSD and ESL 
status was highly significant, p < 0.001. Physical co-morbid-
ities were common; 13% of both veterans and non-veterans 
who self-harmed had a history of COPD, compared with 
4% of the wider veteran and non-veteran population, whilst 
7% had a history of peptic ulcer, approximately twice the 
proportion in the overall population. Diabetes was also more 
common in those who self-harmed, as were alcoholic liver 
disease and hepatitis C, although in the case of the latter two 
conditions, at a lower level in veterans than in non-veterans. 
Small numbers precluded analysis of multi-morbidity.
Discussion
We have demonstrated that non-fatal self harm is more com-
mon in veterans than in non-veterans matched for age, sex 
and area of residence, but we have also shown that it is most

common in both the oldest and the youngest veterans. The 
excess risk is restricted to those with the shortest service 
and is highest in those who left before completing initial 
training, whilst longer service is protective, suggesting that 
there is both a ‘healthy worker effect’ [18] and a selection 
bias effect owing to early discharge of those least suited to 
military service, who have been shown previously to be at 
increased risk of mental health disorder [19]. There are two 
distinct patterns of risk, in the early 20s for the youngest 
veterans who left service early, and in middle age. We had 
no clinical details of the cases and were, therefore, unable to 
distinguish between non-suicidal self-harm and failed sui-
cide; however, it seems likely that the younger ESL cases 
largely represent the former whereas those presenting in 
middle age may be more likely to represent failed suicide 
attempts, based on patterns of deliberate self-harm reported 
in other studies [20], on the pattern of suicide in veterans 
that we have previously reported [7], and on the reported 
occurrence of prior self-harm in relation to completed sui-
cide that we have found in this study.
Although deliberate self-harm and parasuicide (attempted 
suicide) are frequently considered to lie on the same spec-
trum, there is good evidence that the two have different 
underlying psychopathology and should be considered sepa-
rately, as now recognised by the separate DSM-5 classifica-
tions of ‘non-suicidal self-injury’ and ‘suicidal behavior’ 
[21, 22]. Whilst suicide attempts often involve poisoning 
with drugs or chemicals, hanging, or jumping from a height, 
with the clear intention of ending life, deliberate self-harm 
more often involves disfiguring or painful behaviours of 
relatively low lethality such as cutting, biting, or mutilation. 
The behaviour pattern often commences in adolescence, and 
episodes may occur repeatedly [23]. The lifetime prevalence 
of self-harm has been estimated to lie between 2.2 and 6% 
[24], and approximately 4% of a sample of US Air Force 
recruits were found to have self-harmed [20]. Although self-
harming may occur at any age, it is more common in ado-
lescents and young adults. Our finding that suicide in older 
veterans was more often associated with a previous episode 
of self-harm than in younger veterans would tend to sup-
port the two groups being considered separately in planning 
preventive strategies.
The literature on gender difference is inconclusive but 
generally the risk is considered to be higher in women. How-
ever a large study in Oxford, UK has provided clarification 
of any apparent discrepancies by demonstrating a changing 
ratio with age, with a high female:male ratio for self-harm in 
adolescents which reverses to give an excess in men beyond 
the age of 50 [25]. Adverse childhood events, and especially 
childhood sexual trauma, have consistently been found to be 
associated with self-harming behaviour [24], and there is a 
well-documented association with anxiety and depression 
[20] which is consistent with our finding of a high level of 
mental health comorbidity.
In a systematic review of 90 prospective studies of people 
who had self-harmed, Owens et al. found a median 16%

repeating non-fatal self-harm within a year, rising to 20–25% 
after 4 or more years. The risk of subsequent suicide was 
much lower, 2% at 1 year rising to 7% after 9 years. The 
authors suggest that recent self-harm is associated with a 1% 
risk of suicide, although there is a very low positive predic-
tive value for any method of risk assessment for suicide even 
in groups of patients considered to be at high risk [26, 27]. 
In a small study of serving Irish military personnel, only 
10% of those who died as a result of suicide had a docu-
mented history of previous self-harm [28], which is broadly 
consistent with our finding of 9% in people under 30. Our 
findings are also supported by the Oxford study which has 
has demonstrated that the risk of subsequent suicide after 
self-harm changes with age, being rare in teenagers (less 
than 1 in 200), but increasing to more than 1 in 10 in people 
over 60 [29].
In a study of 1986 male and female military recruits, 
of whom 4% reported a history of self-harm, self-harming 
behaviour was strongly associated with negative tempera-
ment including aggression, mistrust and manipulativeness, 
as well as disinhibition and a range of personality disorders 
including borderline and dependent. Many stated that they 
self-harmed as a means of relieving tension [20]. The asso-
ciation between aggression and self-harm may be an impor-
tant factor in understanding the excess risk which we have 
documented. In a study by Rona et al. anger/aggression was 
positively associated with young age, low rank, being in the 
Army, combat service and being a veteran [30]. Other fac-
tors included childhood adversity and anti-social behaviour, 
which are prevalent in ESL [31] and are also associated with 
risk of self-harm [32]. Anger and aggression were strongly 
associated with PTSD, psychological distress and multi-
ple physical symptoms [30]. The link between premature 
departure from service and poor long-term mental health 
outcomes mental has previously been documented [14, 31]. 
It seems probable that there is an inevitable association 
between suitability for military service, especially combat 
service, and aggressive personality traits, which provides 
some explanation for our findings.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of the present study are similar to those 
described elsewhere [7, 12]. The study was based on a large 
cohort covering the whole of Scotland with up to 30 years’ 
follow-up. The records of morbidity and causes of death 
were taken from acute and psychiatric hospital records and 
national vital records and are, therefore, likely to be reliable. 
The use of record linkage to analyse individual level data 
directly derived from these records allowed a robust cohort 
study design to be employed. The results were able to be 
matched or adjusted for potential confounders including sex 
and SES. It was possible to do subgroup analysis by sex, 
birth cohort and length of service, enabling a picture of the 
pattern of self-harm in veterans to be built up.
Limitations of the study include possible loss to follow-
up of subjects due to migration away from Scotland, which 
could not be quantified, and the lack of any follow-up data 
prior to 1981. As the dataset was derived from demographic, 
vital record and hospital admissions data, there was no 
information on individual deployments, combat exposure 
or individual factors such as childhood events or alcohol 
use. These may represent potential explanatory variables 
for which we were unable to analyse the impact, or residual 
confounding for which we were unable to adjust. No infor-
mation was available about events which did not come to 
medical attention or were managed solely in primary care; 
therefore, only the more severe end of the spectrum of self-
harm is represented. We have made the assumption that there 
were no differences between veterans and non-veterans in 
respect of the setting in which self-harm was managed, other 
than the frequency of occurrence. Only the last recorded 
postcode was available which, for veterans, was necessarily 
post-service. Therefore, the impact of childhood depriva-
tion could not be assessed. Veterans with Reserve service 
only could not be identified and were included amongst the 
non-veterans; this could have had the effect of reducing any 
observed differences between veterans and non-veterans if 
they also had an increased risk of self-harm, although as the 
number of Reservist veterans inappropriately classified as 
non-veterans is likely to have been small, significant impact 
on our findings is unlikely.
Summary
Our findings show that the highest risks of non-fatal self-
harm are in veterans with the shortest service, including 
those who did not complete training, and in the oldest and 
youngest birth cohorts, whilst veterans who had served for 
longest are at reduced risk. This pattern is not consistent 
with a causal role for military service but instead suggests 
that the risk in early service leavers reflects other vulner-
abilities such as adverse childhood events. We have also 
highlighted an important association between mental health 
disorder, in particular PTSD, and self-harm in ESL veter-
ans. Although overall, fewer than one-fifth of those who 
died from suicide had a previous record of self-harm, we 
have illustrated that this risk is higher in older veterans, sug-
gesting that failed suicide attempts in middle age contribute 
to the increased risk of self-harm which we observed and 
underlining the importance of treating every self-harm epi-
sode in this older age group as a ‘red flag’. The higher risk 
of self-harm in the most recent birth cohort warrants fur-
ther investigation. We recommend that specific inquiry into 
self-harm should be made in all veterans who present with

mental health conditions, and especially those with PTSD 
who left service prematurely.
