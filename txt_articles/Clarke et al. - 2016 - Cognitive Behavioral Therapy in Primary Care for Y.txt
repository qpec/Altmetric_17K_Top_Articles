abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Health care providers have few alternatives for youth depression 
other than antidepressants. We examined whether brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
is a viable alternative in primary care.
METHODS: A total of 212 adolescents aged 12 to 18 with major depression who had recently 
declined or quickly discontinued new antidepressant treatment were randomized to self-
selected treatment as usual (TAU) control condition or TAU plus brief individual CBT. 
Blinded evaluators followed youth for 2 years. The primary outcome was time to major 
depression diagnostic recovery.
RESULTS: CBT was superior to the control condition on the primary outcome of time to 
diagnostic recovery from major depression, with number needed to treat from 4 to 10 
across follow-up. A similar CBT advantage was found for time to depression diagnosis 
response, with number needed to treat of 5 to 50 across time points. We observed a 
significant advantage for CBT on many secondary outcomes over the first year of follow-up 
but not the second year. Cohen’s d effect sizes for significant continuous measures ranged 
from 0.28 to 0.44, in the small to medium effect range. Most TAU health care services did 
not differ across conditions, except for psychiatric hospitalizations, which occurred at a 
significantly higher rate in the control condition through the first year of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Observed results were consistent with recent meta-analyses of CBT for youth 
depression. The initial year of CBT superiority imparted an important clinical benefit and 
may reduce the risk of future recurrent depression episodes.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Depressed 
youth and families are often reluctant to try 
antidepressants (ADs), resulting in signifi
 cant 
undertreatment. Unfortunately, primary care 
providers have few alternatives to offer for 
youth depression other than ADs. Brief cognitive 
behavioral therapy is a potentially effective 
alternative.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study shows that 
brief, primary care cognitive behavioral therapy 
can be effective for depressed youth who decline or 
discontinue ADs, with benefi
 ts that endure for 1 year 
or longer, and possible reductions in high-intensity 
services (eg, psychiatric hospitalizations).

CLARKE et al 
Adolescent depression is often 
initially identified in primary 
care, and is increasingly 
treated there, 
1–4 typically with 
antidepressant (AD) medications.5, 
6 
However, a 2004 warning from 
the Food and Drug Administration 
regarding AD-associated suicidality 
contributed to reduced prescription 
of ADs over many years, with 
no corresponding increase in 
psychotherapy rates.7–10 Among 
depressed youth in primary 
care, as many as 50% decline 
pharmacotherapy.5 Of those who 
do initiate ADs, as many as half fail 
to maintain adherence or duration 
sufficient to realize the expected 
benefit.7
This mismatch between ADs typically 
available in primary care, and 
frequent rejection and/or premature 
discontinuation of ADs, suggests 
that many depressed youth may be 
under/untreated. This is especially 
concerning given difficulties referring 
to specialty mental health.3, 
11, 
12 
Consistent with youth and parent 
pre 
ferences for nonpharmacologic 
treatments such as psychotherapy, 
13–15 
we examined whether a viable 
alternative could be effectively 
delivered in primary care: brief 
cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT). Although primary care 
CBT has been tested with 
depressed adolescents in several 
previous trials, 
13, 
16, 
17 none 
specifically examined the effects 
of CBT in patients unreceptive to 
pharmacotherapy.
METHODS
Participants
From September 2006 to June 
2010 we enrolled 212 depressed 
adolescents between 12 and 18 
years old. All study procedures 
were approved by the local 
institutional review board. 
Participants were 68.4% girls 
(145/212), 16.0% Hispanic 
(34/212), 11.8% racial minority 
status (25/212), and were an 
average of 14.6 years old (SD 
1.7). Parents had an average 
socioeconomic status level of 
40.8 (12.2), and family income 
averaged $64 073 (SD $27 528). 
There were no significant 
differences across study 
conditions on these factors.
Recruitment, Enrollment
Potential participants (n = 2387) 
were identified by reviewing the 
health maintenance organization 
(HMO) electronic medical record for 
depression diagnoses and a recent 
AD prescription that was unfilled, 
or was initially dispensed but not 
refilled. We sought primary care 
provider permission to mail study 
brochures; 455 (19.1%) declined, 
often for incompatible clinical 
issues or absence of 
youth depression. Assenting 
youth and consenting parents 
were administered a brief 
telephone screen (n = 635), 
followed by a full baseline 
assessment for screen-positive 
youth (n = 357).
Qualifying Criteria
Youth had to have a Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text 
Revision 18 diagnosis of major 
depression obtained via the 
Children’s Schedule for Affective 
Disorders and Schizophrenia 
(KSADS).19 All youth had to 
have recently declined ADs or 
discontinued prematurely (<30 
days’ adherence). Exclusion 
criteria included the following: 
current AD use, bipolar disorder 
or any psychotic diagnosis, or 
mental retardation or autism 
spectrum disorder. All other 
comorbid psychiatric diagnoses 
were permitted. One youth was 
excluded due to imminent suicide 
risk. Non-CBT psychotherapy once 
monthly or less was permitted. 
Three youth were excluded for 
having received ≥8 sessions of CBT.
Randomization
We randomized youth 1:1 to either 
(1) self-selected treatment as usual 
(TAU) control condition, or (2) 
TAU plus individual CBT (Table 1). 
Randomization was stratified 
on baseline depression severity 
(Center for Epidemiological Studies-
Depression Scale [CES-D] <34 vs 
≥34), gender, Hispanic 
ethnicity, and age 
(12–15 vs 16–18).
Assessments
All instruments were administered 
at baseline and at 6, 12, 26, 52, 78, 
and 104 weeks. Figure 1 
presents follow-up rates. 
Assessors were blinded to 
randomization.
Depression Measures
Assessors administered the KSADS 
diagnostic interview to generate 
diagnoses of major depression (MD) 
and assess suicidal ideation.19 At 
each follow-up, the Longitudinal 
Interval Follow-Up Evaluation20 
was used to obtain weekly MD 
Diagnostic Status Ratings. The 
primary outcome of depression 
recovery was defined as ≥8 
weeks of no or minimal symptoms 
(Diagnostic Status Rating ≤1–2) 
and little or no impairment.21 
Supervisors rerated a random 5% 
sample of interviews (n = 64); 
diagnostic reliability was high, with 
MD κ = 0.81 (92% agreement).
Assessors rated the 17-item 
Children’s Depression 
Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), 
a continuous measure of 
depression symptomatology.22–24 
Youth also completed the 
20-item CES-D.25

Other Psychological Outcomes
Youth completed the 7-item self-
report Insomnia Severity Index 
(ISI)26 and 12 items from the 
Carskadon sleep survey captured 
insomnia severity and other sleep 
parameters.27 Youth also completed 
the 6-item CRAFFT screener for 
substance use.28 Parents completed 
the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), 
29 
rating youth internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms, and 
social competence.
Assessors administered an 
abbreviated, 10-item Dysfunctional 
Attitudes Scale (DAS) to assess 
unrealistic and irrational 
cognitions.30
Youth completed an abbreviated 
12-item Pleasant Events Schedule 
(PES)31 as a measure of behavioral 
activation.
Assessors administered the Target 
Complaint Checklist (TCC).32 Each 
youth and parent identified up to 
3 target complaints at baseline 
(eg, “Having no friends”) and then 
at each follow-up rated the severity 
and degree of improvement for all 
targets.
Quality of Life, Functioning
Both youth and parents completed 
the Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory (PEDS-QL), 
33 with 
additional items to address school 
and family functioning. Assessors 
rated youth overall functioning on 
the Children’s Global Adjustment 
Scale (CGAS).34
Health Care Services
Assessors obtained youth and 
parent report of youth health 
care utilization with the Child 
and Adolescent Services 
Assessment (CASA).35 Youth 
completed the 8-item, 
self-report Client Satisfaction 
Questionnaire36 to evaluate 
satisfaction with TAU depression 
treatments.
Intervention Conditions
TAU
Youth in both conditions were 
permitted to continue and/or initiate 
any nonresearch mental health or 
general medical treatment (see Table 
2). TAU did not mean that all youth 
received the same type of treatment. 
Instead, it was self-selected and 
varied among the options listed in 
Table 2. Data regarding HMO services 
were captured via the electronic 
medical record. All non-HMO services 
were assessed with the CASA 
interview.
CBT-Depression
The acute-phase CBT program 
consisted of 2, 4-session modules: 
cognitive therapy (CT) to address 
unrealistic thinking, and increasing 
pleasant activities (behavioral 
activation, or BA). The program 
had been previously evaluated 
in individual16, 
37 and group 
formats.38–40 Youth and therapist 
jointly selected 1 module to begin 
(Fig 2). Youth could stop after 
the first module if they were 
nearly or completely recovered. 
Partial and nonresponders were 
encouraged to continue with the 
second module. Up to 6 elective 
continuation contacts were 
permitted. Therapists had at least 
a master’s degree, and several 
years’ experience delivering CBT in 
previous studies.16, 
24, 
37, 
41 Biweekly 
supervision addressed CBT 
implementation.

nearly all in person. Four youth 
(4% of 106) did not attend any 
CBT sessions; 84 (79%) received 
the minimum threshold dose of ≥4 
sessions, yielding an overall mean 
of 6.6 sessions (SD 2.5). Of those 
attending any sessions, 67 (66% 
of 102) received 1+ sessions of 
CT, 63 (62%) received 1+ sessions 
of BA, and 46 (45%) received 1+ 
sessions each of both CT and BA. 
Eighty youth (76%) received ≥1 
continuation contact, for an 
average of 3.4 continuation 
contacts (SD 1.7).
A random selection of 64 audio-
recorded sessions (10%) yielded 
mean adherence of 85% on the 
Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale, 
42 
and a mean of 96% of session 
content delivered per the CBT 
manual.
Analysis Plan
The primary outcome 
analysis used the intent-to-treat 
sample. The primary outcome 
was time to recovery from 
major depression (assessed via 
Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up 
Evaluation/KSADS diagnosis). 
Secondary outcomes included 
major depression response; 
CDRS-R continuous total score; 
≥50% CDRS-R improvement; 
depression “caseness” (CDRS-R <, 
≥28); psychosocial function on the 
CGAS; KSADS suicidal ideation; and 
change on all other symptom or 
functioning measures.
To address incomplete follow-up 
data, we used restricted maximum 
likelihood methods to estimate 
the treatment effect using mixed 
models (SAS PROC MIXED or PROC 
GLIMMIX; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, 
NC). For continuous measures, the 
effect size was the standardized 
adjusted mean difference between 
treatments (Cohen d). For 
binary measures, we used Cox

size in terms of number 
needed to treat (NNT).43 
In analyses of both continuous 
and binary outcomes, we a 
priori adjusted for baseline 
depression severity 
(CDRS-R <, ≥40).
We based power analyses on a 
20% difference in major depression 
recovery, based on an earlier study 
of depressed adolescents treated 
in primary care.13 With 2-tailed α = 
0.05, 80% power would be achieved 
with 92 participants per 
condition. To account for attrition, 
we set the enrollment target to 
216; actual enrollment 
was 212.
RESULTS
Retention, Attrition
Figure 1 lists assessment completion 
at all assessment points, ranging 
from 79% to 96%, with 210 (99%) 
youth having at least 1 postbaseline 
assessment. Follow-up rates were not 
significantly different between study 
arms.
Primary Depression Outcome
Depression Recovery
Figure 3 presents major depression 
diagnostic recovery by condition. 
Significantly better rates of 
recovery were observed for the 
CBT condition from baseline to 
each of study follow-up points, 
with maximal separation between 
the curves at 15 to 20 weeks 
after enrollment. At immediate 
posttreatment (week 12) the NNT 
was 6; for time points from weeks 
52 through 104 the NNT was 10. 
TAU youth had an average of 30.0 
weeks to recovery (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 25.3–34.7; median 23 
weeks), compared with an average 
of 22.6 weeks for CBT youth (95% 
CI 18.7–26.5, median 15 weeks).
Secondary Outcomes
Depression Response
We employed Figure 3 survival 
analyses to examine treatment 
response, defined as ≥8 weeks 
below the threshold of 5 or more 
MD symptoms necessary for full 
diagnosis, but where full recovery 
has not yet occurred. CBT condition 
response was significantly better 
through each study follow-up point 
compared with TAU. NNT ranged 
from 5 at posttreatment to 50 at the 
final follow-up point (week 102). 
TAU participants had an average of 
18.0 weeks until response (95% CI 
14.7–21.3, median 12 weeks), versus 
an average of 13.3 weeks for CBT 
youth (95% CI 10.6–15.9, median 9 
weeks).
CDRS-R
CDRS-R scores were significantly 
lower for the CBT arm from baseline 
to week 52 (P = .04, Cohen d = 0.28) 
but in year 2 there was no between-
condition difference. A similar 
pattern was observed for CDRS-R

“depression caseness” (<, ≥28), 
44 
with a significant advantage for the 
CBT condition through week 52 
(P = .03, NNT = 16), but no difference 
in weeks 52 to 104. A final CDRS 
variable, ≥50% improvement from 
baseline score, was not significantly 
different across conditions through 
any time period.
CES-D
The CES-D total score was 
significantly improved for the CBT 
condition compared with the control 
condition, from baseline to week 
52 (P = .005, d = 0.39). However, no 
significant differences were found 
between conditions from week 52 
through week 104.
Substance Use
A CRAFFT28, 
45 cutoff score of 
≥ 2 did not differentiate between 
conditions through either of the 2 
time periods.
Insomnia, Sleep Problems
Neither the Carskadon sleep scale nor 
the ISI significantly differed between 
conditions in either of the 2 time 
periods.
Functioning
The CGAS was significantly 
improved in the CBT arm compared 
with the TAU control through 
week 52 (P = .007, d = 0.43), but 
no differences were found in the 
second year.
Quality of Life
CBT youth had improved PEDS-QL 
quality of life (P = .03, d = 0.28) and 
physical subscale scores (P = .22, d 
= 0.27) through week 52 compared 
with control youth, but not in the 
second year. No effects were found 
for the psychosocial subscale.
Dysfunctional Thoughts
Through week 52, youth in the CBT 
condition demonstrated a greater 
reduction in dysfunctional thoughts 
on the DAS compared with the TAU 
control youth (P = .003, d = 0.44), but 
this was not observed in the second 
year.
Suicidal Behavior
There was no statistical 
difference between CBT and 
TAU conditions.
Activity Level, Enjoyment
Neither PES subscale was 
significantly different between 
conditions across time.
Satisfaction With Treatment
There were no differences 
across conditions regarding 
satisfaction with depression 
treatment in either the 
first or second year of 
the study.
TCC
CBT youth reported significantly 
greater improvement in their 
self-identified TCC complaints 
than TAU youth through week 52 
(P = .01, d = 0.251), but there was 
no difference through the second 
year.
Parent-Reported Outcomes
None of the parent-report scales 
(CES-D; PEDS-QL total, physical, 
or psychosocial subscales; TCC; 
CBCL depression, Internalizing 
or Externalizing subscales) were 
significantly different across 
conditions over time.
TAU Health Care
Table 2 summarizes self-selected 
TAU health care services reported by 
youth and/or parents on the CASA. 
There were no differences across 
conditions for outpatient mental 
health visits, school counseling, 
juvenile justice contact, use of 
antidepressants, or any type of 
mental health medication. Youth 
in the TAU condition did report 
significantly higher rates 
of psychiatric hospitalization 
though week 52 compared with 
CBT youth (8.5% vs 0.9%, P = .01, 
odds ratio [95% CI] = 9.7 
[1.2–78.3]).
DISCUSSION
This study represents the most 
recent large trial of CBT for

youth depression. Previous 
large investigations include the 
single-site Adolescent Depression 
Antidepressants and Psychotherapy 
Trial (ADAPT) (n = 208), 
46 and the 
multisite Treatment of Adolescents 
with Depression Study (TADS) 
(n = 439) and Treatment Of Resistant 
Depression In Adolescents trial 
(TORDIA) (n = 334).23, 
24 Across 
these large trials and many smaller 
studies, CBT for youth depression 
has performed inconsistently. 
In TADS and TORDIA, combined 
CBT and ADs was superior to 
monotherapy ADs, suggesting 
an important adjunctive benefit; 
however, the ADAPT trial46 
failed to find a similar benefit for 
combined treatment. Further, 
meta-analyses of monotherapy CBT 
for youth depression have found it 
to be only moderately effective.47–49 
For instance, the TADS study 
monotherapy CBT was significantly 
less effective than monotherapy 
AD, and was not superior to a 
medication placebo control.23 
In contrast, our earlier trial16 
found a general pattern of 
modest superiority of brief CBT 
plus TAU ADs over a control 
condition of TAU ADs 
without CBT.
In the current trial, brief CBT 
plus TAU was superior to the 
TAU control condition on the 
primary outcome of recovery from 
major depression (Fig 3), with a 
posttreatment NNT of 4. Although 
there are no standards for a 
clinically meaningful NNT, a review 
of ADs for adolescent depression 
found an overall posttreatment 
NNT of 10.50 We found a similar 
result for depression diagnosis 
response, with a significant 
CBT advantage at all follow-up 
time points and an NNT of 5 at 
posttreatment.
Beyond the immediate posttreatment 
period, CBT’s advantage on the 
primary outcome (MD recovery) 
and for some secondary outcomes 
persisted for the 2-year follow-up 
period. This enduring effect sets 
this study apart from most previous 
youth depression CBT trials. 
However, CBT’s advantage over TAU 
appears to have occurred mostly 
in year 1, with some advantages 
diminishing modestly in year 2. 
The pattern suggests that adding 
a maintenance/continuation 
component might sustain benefit 
over longer periods.
CBT was not beneficial for 
nonaffective outcomes such as 
substance use and sleep problems. 
This is not surprising, as CBT for 
depression shares only limited 
elements with CBT variants 
addressing other health targets. 
Broadening the impact of this 
intervention might require adding 
other CBT elements, such as 
exposure and response prevention 
to address anxiety, or stimulus 
control and sleep restriction for 
sleep problems.
The magnitude of effects found 
in this trial (d’s from 0.08–0.34; 
NNTs from 5–50) were small to 
moderate, and are consistent 
with recent meta-analyses of 
CBT for depression in youth.47–49 
However, effects sizes are highly 
dependent on the potency of 
the control condition, which in 
this trial was active TAU, albeit 
self-selected and highly variable 
(Table 2). Although this sample 
declined or discontinued ADs 
before enrollment, many youth in 
both conditions initiated ADs or 
other treatments during follow-up, 
presumably for unresolved 
depression but potentially to treat 
other conditions, such as anxiety. 
Most categories of post-baseline 
TAU mental health services were 
not significantly different across 
conditions, except for inpatient 
psychiatric hospitalizations, 
which occurred at a significantly 
higher rate in the TAU control arm 
through week 52. The high cost of 
these services suggests a possible 
advantage for CBT, which 
we plan to examine in future 
economic analyses. Detecting 
CBT effects against this background 
TAU is challenging. Presumably, in 
some proportion of youth in both 
conditions, TAU services imparted 
a depression benefit that was not 
“available” for CBT to improve on. 
The greater the response to TAU 
(estimated in the control condition), 
the less variability remains to be 
impacted by incremental CBT. In 
this context, the observed small-
moderate benefits are a 
reasonable estimate of real-world 
benefits when CBT is delivered with 
good fidelity against a backdrop of 
usual care.
Is there a genuine clinical 
benefit to the significant CBT 
advantage in the first year? First, 
it is important to recall that not 
all outcomes showed a loss of 
significant advantage for CBT in 
the second year. MD diagnosis 
recovery and response still favored 
CBT through the final 24-month 
follow-up, although the advantage 
was reduced by this point. 
Nonetheless, even if there were 
no advantages in the second year 
we still believe that the initial year 
of CBT advantage is an important 
clinical and developmental benefit. 
For example, longer-duration 
depressive episodes increase risk 
for future depression recurrence.51 
Thus, any intervention that curtails 
episode duration not only improves 
short-term outcomes but may also 
reduce the risk of future recurrent 
episodes. Furthermore, depressed 
adolescents often experience social 
and academic “decoupling” from 
peer groups during depressive 
episodes, leading to lower rates of 
important milestone attainment, 
such as high school graduation, 
disadvantages that may persist even 
after episodes have ended.52, 
53 
Thus, any reduction in the 
duration of depressive episodes 
may potentially reduce future

recurrence and improve the 
probability and speed of social 
and academic reintegration 
and developmental milestone 
attainment.
CONCLUSIONS
The conclusions of this study are 
limited by the low numbers of 
racial and ethnic minority youth, 
which hampers our ability to 
generalize these results to more 
diverse populations. Nonetheless, 
this sample was more clinically 
representative than in many 
previous CBT trials. All youth 
had been diagnosed as clinically 
depressed by their TAU provider 
before recruitment. Furthermore, 
CBT was delivered in the context 
of TAU (Table 2), and all effects 
were obtained beyond the benefits 
imparted by TAU.
An important question is whether 
this sample was comparable to 
samples in other depression-
treatment trials. Consistent with 
other large recent CBT trials, 
all youth were required to meet 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders criteria for 
major depression at baseline. 
However, depression severity was 
somewhat lower in this sample 
(baseline CDRS-R mean = 53.2, SD 
9.3) than in other trials such as 
TADS (mean = 60.0, SD 10.4)54 or 
TORDIA (mean = 59.0, SD 10.0).55 
That our sample was slightly less 
depressed is not surprising, given 
that these youth were initially 
identified as depressed in primary 
care. The enduring CBT benefits 
observed in this study for major 
depression recovery may have been 
partially due to this lower baseline 
depression level.
One implication for clinical practice 
is that brief CBT can be delivered 
in primary care to depressed youth 
who have initially declined ADs. 
Also, our results indicate that brief 
CBT can impart small-to-moderate 
clinical benefit above and beyond 
TAU health services, and that this 
benefit persists for at least 1 year 
after baseline. These conclusions 
are contrary to the negative 
findings regarding CBT from the 
TADS and ADAPT trials.23, 
46 Along 
with other positive trials such 
as TORDIA, 
24 this study suggests 
that CBT can be a viable if modest 
treatment of adolescent depression.
