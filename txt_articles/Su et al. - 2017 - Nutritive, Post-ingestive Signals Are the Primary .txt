In Brief
Su et al. demonstrate that nutrient
content in the GI tract is rapidly signaled
to hypothalamic neurons activated by
hunger. This rapid effect is mediated by
three satiation signals that synergistically
reduce the activity of AgRP neurons.
These findings uncover how hunger
circuits in the brain are regulated and
raise the possibility that hunger can be
pharmacologically controlled.

SUMMARY
The brain regulates food intake by processing
sensory cues and peripheral physiological signals,
but the neural basis of this integration remains
unclear.
Hypothalamic,
agouti-related
protein
(AgRP)-expressing neurons are critical regulators of
food intake. AgRP neuron activity is high during
hunger and is rapidly reduced by the sight and smell
of food. Here, we reveal two distinct components of
AgRP neuron activity regulation: a rapid but transient
sensory-driven signal and a slower, sustained calo-
rie-dependent signal. We discovered that nutrients
are necessary and sufficient for sustained reductions
in AgRP neuron activity and that activity reductions
are proportional to the calories obtained. This change
in activity is recapitulated by exogenous administra-
tion of gut-derived satiation signals. Furthermore,
we showed that the nutritive value of food trains
sensory systems—in a single trial—to drive rapid,
anticipatory
AgRP
neuron
activity
inhibition.
Together, these data demonstrate that nutrients are
the primary regulators of AgRP neuron activity.
INTRODUCTION
Food intake is tightly controlled by interactions between the
brain and the periphery. Three types of signals can influence
feeding behavior: (1) pre-consummatory sensory signals, such
as visual and olfactory cues that predict the availability of food
(Petrovich et al., 2002; Weingarten, 1983); (2) orosensory signals,
such as taste (Booth, 1972; Campbell and Davis, 1974; Lucas
and Sclafani, 1989); and (3) physiological signals, such as the
detection of nutrients and the release of post-prandial satiation
signals (Cummings and Overduin, 2007; McHugh and Moran,
1978; Sobrino Crespo et al., 2014).
Classical studies have demonstrated the ability to associate
a novel sensory cue with the presentation of food (Pavlov and
Fol’bort, 1926; Weingarten, 1983). Cues predicting food lead
to physiological changes before food is available and can
even drive food intake in sated individuals, a phenomenon
known as cue-potentiated feeding (Petrovich et al., 2002;
Weingarten, 1983). More recently, it has been demonstrated
that animals can learn to associate nonnutritive orosensory
cues with gastric nutrients (Han et al., 2016; Lucas and Scla-
fani, 1989). These studies suggest that individuals use both
pre-consummatory and orosensory food cues to predict en-
ergy availability.
Once food is consumed, nutrients are detected in the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Ingested substances are sensed
by mechanoreceptors in the stomach, which are activated
by gastric distension. Stomach contents are emptied in pro-
portion to caloric load, and nutrients are detected in the small
intestine (Cummings and Overduin, 2007; Powley and Phillips,
2004). The ability for GI preloads to reduce food intake in a
calorie-dependent manner (McHugh and Moran, 1978) sug-
gests that gut-derived signals control food intake. Indeed,
as nutrients are detected, satiation hormones are released
from the GI tract to terminate meals (Cummings and Over-
duin, 2007; Sobrino Crespo et al., 2014). These effects are
mediated, at least in part, by hindbrain circuits (Berthoud
et al., 2006; Carter et al., 2013; Hayes et al., 2008). A critical
next step is to understand how these signals are transmitted
to other brain regions, such as the hypothalamus, that inte-
grate
different homeostatic
signals to
influence
feeding
behavior.
The activity of hypothalamic, agouti-related protein (AgRP)-
expressing neurons is influenced by both energy status and
exteroceptive sensory cues, suggesting that this neural pop-
ulation is a node for the integration of these signals. These
neurons stimulate voracious feeding when excited (Aponte
et al., 2011; Krashes et al., 2011), and when AgRP neurons
are ablated, animals stop consuming food and die of starva-
tion (Luquet et al., 2005). AgRP neurons exhibit high levels of
activity in nutrient deficit (Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015; Taka-
hashi and Cone, 2005), and their activity is reduced following
food consumption (Betley et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Man-
delblat-Cerf et al., 2015). Recent studies have shown that ac-
tivity in AgRP neurons rapidly decreases upon presentation of
cues that predict food, such as the sight or smell of food (Bet-
ley et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Mandelblat-Cerf et al.,
2015). These studies have challenged the classical view that
AgRP neurons are homeostatically regulated, leading to the
current model of AgRP neurons as sensory detectors of
food (Betley et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Mandelblat-Cerf
et al., 2015). However, consuming food appears necessary
to maintain reduced AgRP neuron activity levels, since
removing food after a short interval leads to a rapid reversion

 to high levels of AgRP neuron activity (Betley et al., 2015;
Chen et al., 2015).
In this study, we used in vivo calcium imaging to disentangle
the roles of sensory and post-ingestive signals on the regulation
AgRP neuron activity. We demonstrate across multiple comple-
mentary experiments that calories, but not external sensory
cues, are necessary and sufficient for sustained reductions in
AgRP neuron activity. The rapid suppression of AgRP neurons
by sensory cues is a transient and dynamic response that has
been learned from prior consumption of caloric food. Taken
together, our data show that GI nutrients provide the primary
signal that teaches anticipatory responses to food cues and
sustains AgRP neuron activity reductions.
RESULTS
Calories Are Required for Sustained Reductions in AgRP
Neuron Activity
To gain insight into the physiological regulation of AgRP neu-
rons, we monitored AgRP neuron calcium dynamics in freely
moving animals. Fiber photometry was performed in animals
engineered to express the genetically encoded calcium indica-
tor, GCaMP6s, in AgRP neurons (Figure 1A). We measured cal-
cium-dependent fluorescence (excited at 490 nm) as a mea-
sure of AgRP neuron activity (Cui et al., 2013; Gunaydin
et al., 2014) and calcium-independent fluorescence (excited
at 405 nm) as a control for movement and bleaching artifacts
(Figure 1B) (Lerner et al., 2015). As previously reported (Betley
et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015),
AgRP neuron activity was rapidly decreased by the presenta-
tion of chow and was sustained following consumption (Fig-
ures S1A and S1B).
We first sought to dissociate the role of nonnutritive sensory
cues from the nutritive content of food in the regulation of
AgRP neuron activity. We monitored AgRP neuron activity in

 food-restricted mice while providing access to an artificially
sweetened, calorie-free gel (CFG), with which they had no
previous experience. Exposure to this novel, nonnutritive tastant
allows the animal to experience all sensory and ingestive pro-
cesses without obtaining calories, testing the sufficiency of
nonnutritive sensory cues in regulating AgRP neurons. The first
trial of CFG consumption resulted in a small, transient reduction
in AgRP neuron activity (Figures 1C–1F) that was significantly
different from encountering a non-food object (Figures S1C
and S1D). This transient decrease was associated with some
aspect of ingestion, as the sight and smell of an inaccessible
novel food was not sufficient to suppress AgRP neuron activity
(Figures S1E–S1L). Subsequent consumption of the CFG led to
smaller and more transient AgRP neuron inhibition (Figures
1C–1F). This observation suggests that the sensory qualities of
CFG have been devalued due to lack of calories and that sensory
systems learn the contingency between cues and caloric content
in a single trial.
Following two exposures to CFG, the same mice were next
allowed to consume a sugar-sweetened, caloric gel (CG) with
similar visual, olfactory, and gustatory profiles as those of CFG.
The robust and rapid anticipatory reduction of AgRP neuron
activity was not observed when the mice encountered CG for
the first time (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1G–1I), likely due to previous
exposure to the CFG with similar sensory profiles. However, the
first trial of CG consumption led to a slower but robust and sus-
tained AgRP neuron activity reduction (T3 in Figures 1C–1E and
1G). On the ensuing exposure to CG, the rapid and robust antic-
ipatory reduction of AgRP neuron activity was observed (Figures
1C, 1D, 1H, and 1I), again suggesting that the contingency
between sensory cues and nutritive value of food is learned in a
single trial. Analogously, a single trial with caloric food is sufficient
to condition visual and olfactory cues to drive the anticipatory
reduction of AgRP neuron activity (Figures S1E–S1M). In all
cases, the suppression of AgRP neuron activity by nonnutritive
sensory cues is transient (�200 s) compared to the suppression
by nutritive food, which persists during and following feeding (Fig-
ures 1C and S1E). Together, these data suggest that calories are
required for sustained suppression of AgRP neuron activity.
Further, these findings demonstrate that AgRP neurons dynami-
cally calculate the contingency between sensory cues and caloric
content of food so that significant changes in the neural response
to food cues occur in a single trial.
We next explored the ability of AgRP circuits to ‘‘unlearn’’ the
contingency between sensory cues and the nutritive value of
calorie-containing food. We gave naive mice access to CG for
two trials and, as expected, observed a sustained reduction in
AgRP neuron activity (Figures 2A and 2B). The inhibition of
AgRP neuron activity by CG was faster on the second trial,
reflecting the learned sensory anticipation of calories (Figures
2A–2D). The mean and maximum AgRP neuron inhibition was
similar in both trials (Figures 2A and 2G–2I). After two exposures
to CG, we broke the contingency between sensory cues and the
expected caloric content of food by giving the same mice trials
with CFG. On the first trial, consumption of the CFG led to a rapid
inhibition of AgRP neuron activity, which is not surprising, since
similar sensory cues had previously been paired with calories
(Figures 2A, 2B, and 2E). Notably, this inhibition of AgRP neurons
was transient (�200 s) and was not observed with naive CFG
consumption (Figure 1C). This suggests that nutrients are
required for sustained AgRP neuron inhibition, despite the pres-
ence of visual, olfactory, gustatory, and non-nutritive interocep-
tive sensory cues. Further, a single exposure to CFG teaches a
new contingency between these sensory cues and calorie
content, as a subsequent exposure to CFG led to a greatly
diminished anticipatory inhibition of AgRP neuron activity (Fig-
ures 2A, 2B, and 2F). The ability to reduce AgRP neuron activity
is independent of the amount of the gel consumed, as animals
consumed similar amounts of both the CG and CFG (Figure 2J).
By isolating the sensory and nutritive properties of food, we
uncovered two distinct phases of AgRP neuron inhibition:
(1) a transient, sensory-mediated anticipatory inhibition and
(2) a sustained, calorie-mediated inhibition.
GI Calorie Detection Is Sufficient for Sustained AgRP
Neuron Activity Reduction
We next sought to understand whether calories, without sensory
cues associated with ingestion, are sufficient to reduce AgRP
neuron activity. To isolate the caloric content of food, we deliv-
ered calories directly to the stomach while monitoring AgRP
neuron activity in food-restricted mice (Figure 3A). As previously
demonstrated (Canbeyli and Koopmans, 1984; McHugh and
Moran, 1978), gastric infusion of calories (Ensure) significantly
reduced subsequent chow intake (Figure 3B). Gastric delivery
of Ensure resulted in robust and sustained reductions in AgRP
neuron activity (Figures 3C–3E). This effect was independent of
osmotic, stretch, and taste signaling in the gut, as neither water,
hypertonic saline, methylcellulose nor sucralose significantly
altered AgRP neuron activity (Figures 3C–3E).
The magnitude and time course of AgRP neuron activity
reduction is dependent on caloric content, as gastric infusion
of 1/3 kcal of Ensure leads to a slower, more transient, and
less substantial reduction in AgRP neuron activity compared to
infusion of 1 kcal (Figures 3F and 3G). This phenomenon is
also observed upon oral consumption of 1/3 and 1 kcal of
chow, peanut butter, or Ensure. In each case, more calories
consistently led to a more substantial and sustained reduction
in AgRP neuron activity (Figures 4A–4I). In contrast to sugges-
tions that AgRP neuron activity is reduced in proportion to palat-
ability (Chen et al., 2015), we find similar mean and maximum
AgRP neuron activity reductions following consumption of palat-
able foods (peanut butter or Ensure) and less palatable foods
(chow) (Figures 4J–4M). Taken together, these data suggest
that caloric content detected by the GI tract, rather than palat-
ability, drives activity changes in AgRP neurons.
Are all calories capable of reducing AgRP neuron activity?
Infusions of glucose, lipids, and amino acids all reduced the
activity of AgRP neurons (Figures 5A–5C), demonstrating that
AgRP neurons respond to the detection of various macronutri-
ents. Similar to the activity reduction observed upon infusion of
Ensure, we observed a calorie-dependent reduction of AgRP
neuron activity when infusing glucose, lipids, or amino acids (Fig-
ures 5D–5F and S2). These results demonstrate that calories are
both necessary and sufficient for sustained reductions in AgRP
neuron activity, consistent with our observations during the
consumption of CG and CFG.

Cell Reports 21, 2724–2736, December 5, 2017
 Satiation Signals Reduce AgRP Neuron Activity
We next sought to explore potential molecular mechanisms by
which gastric nutrients inhibit AgRP neuron activity. Several GI
satiation signals are released following food intake (Figure 6A)
and contribute to food intake suppression (Bhavsar et al.,
1998; Chaudhri et al., 2006; Erlanson-Albertsson and Larsson,
1988; Kopin et al., 1999; Neary et al., 2005; Pittner et al., 2004;
Wright et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2005). The effects of these
satiation signals on in vivo activity in hypothalamic circuits are
unknown. We combined 8 satiation peptides, each known to
acutely reduce food intake when administered exogenously
(Bhavsar et al., 1998; Chaudhri et al., 2006; Erlanson-Albertsson
and Larsson, 1988; Kopin et al., 1999; Neary et al., 2005; Pittner
et al., 2004; Wright et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2005) and injected

 this cocktail intraperitoneally (i.p.) while monitoring AgRP neuron
activity in food-restricted mice. The satiation peptide cocktail
dramatically reduced activity in AgRP neurons (Figures 6B–6D
and S3). The reduction in AgRP neuron activity was dose depen-
dent, as a lower (1/3) dose of the peptides led to a reduced
magnitude and duration of AgRP neuron activity suppression
(Figures 6B–6D and S3). This reduction in AgRP neuron activity
is likely independent of malaise that is often associated with
satiation signaling (Deutsch and Hardy, 1977; Kanoski et al.,
2012; le Roux et al., 2008), as this peptide cocktail neither
induced a conditioned taste avoidance (Figure 6E) nor reduced
locomotor activity (Figure 6F). Additionally, feeding-suppressive
doses of noxious substances (lithium chloride [LiCl] or lipopoly-
saccharide [LPS]) (Morme
` de et al., 2004; West et al., 1987)
have no impact on AgRP neuron activity (Figures 6B–6D and S3).
We next explored whether AgRP neuron activity inhibition by
satiation signaling is functionally relevant for food intake control.
We reasoned that if satiation signals inhibited food intake via a
reduction in AgRP neuron activity, restoring AgRP neuron
signaling would attenuate the anorexia resulting from peptide
cocktail injection. As expected, administration of the peptide
cocktail to food-deprived animals reduced food intake by
42.6 ± 10.3% in comparison to saline-treated mice (Figures
6G–6I). This effect was abrogated by optogenetically restoring

contribute to AgRP neuron inhibition, we individually evaluated
the role of each satiation signal on AgRP neuron activity.
Cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), and
amylin each suppressed AgRP neuron activity (Figures 7A and
7B; Figures S4A and S4C), albeit at higher concentrations than
those used in the cocktail (Figure 6A). Conversely, the other 5 sati-

 doses known to reduce food intake (Chaudhri et al., 2006;
Erlanson-AlbertssonandLarsson,1988; Nearyetal.,2005;Wright
et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2005). Relative to other satiation signals,
CCK reduced the activity of AgRP neurons on a fast time course
so that maximal suppression was reached in 1.9 ± 0.3 min. How-
ever, CCK-induced suppression was more transient in compari-
sontothecocktail,PYY,oramylin(Figures7Aand7C).Incontrast,
PYY-mediated suppression of AgRP neuron activity plateaued in
26.8 ± 2.0 min but continued for significantly longer than CCK,
suggesting that PYY has a slower latency but a longer lasting
effect on AgRP neuron activity (Figures 7A and 7C; Figure S4A).
Amylin had intermediate kinetics and suppressive effects on
AgRP neuron activity (Figures 7A and 7C).
Doses of CCK, PYY, and amylin used in our cocktail that are
known to reduce food intake (Bhavsar et al., 1998; Kopin et al.,
1999; Pittner et al., 2004) did not substantially influence AgRP
neuron activity when administered individually (Figures 7D
and 7E). However, combining lower doses of these 3 peptides
(3 mg/kg CCK, 10 mg/kg PYY, and 10 mg/kg amylin), robustly
reduced AgRP neuron activity (Figures 7D–7F; Figures S4D
and S4E), suggesting a synergistic effect of these peptides.
Conversely, no effect on AgRP neuron activity was observed
when we applied a cocktail of the 5 satiation peptides that are
individually insufficient to suppress activity (Figures 7D and 7F;
Figures S4D and S4E). Together, these data suggest that CCK,
PYY, and amylin synergistically interact to reduce the activity of
AgRP neurons.
DISCUSSION
Detection of nutrients by the CNS is critical to food intake
control. Despite compelling demonstrations that AgRP neuron
activity dramatically responds to the sensory detection of food
(Betley et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Mandelblat-Cerf et al.,
2015), our activity analyses reveal that the response of AgRP
neurons is primarily driven by the homeostatic, nutritive value
of food. We find that (1) AgRP neuron activity reductions only
persist when coupled with the consumption of calorie-containing
foods, direct infusion of nutrients, or GI satiation signals; and
(2) calories are required to entrain sensory circuits that signal
AgRP neurons upon the detection of food (Figure 7G).
AgRP Neuron Activity Levels Are Regulated by the
Ingestion of Caloric Food
In this study, we unmask the relative contributions of the sensory
and nutritive properties of food on AgRP neuron activity. We
provide several lines of evidence demonstrating that calorie-
containing nutrients reduce AgRP neuron activity independent
of non-nutritive sensory cues. First, the sight, smell, taste,
and ingestion of non-caloric but palatable (i.e., artificially sweet-
ened) substances—such as calorie-free gel—do not lead to a
sustained suppression of AgRP neuron activity. Second, the
silencing of AgRP neurons is not dependent on the presence
of any external sensory cues, as direct gastric infusion of nutritive
substances causes a persistent reduction in AgRP neuron
activity, similar to the consumption of a meal. Additionally, the
sensation of substances in the GI tract is not sufficient to reduce
activity of AgRP neurons, as nonnutritive and artificially sweet-
ened solutions infused into the stomach do not change AgRP
neuron activity. Third, AgRP neuron silencing scales with the
number of calories ingested or infused. In addition to our direct
gastric infusions, we show that consuming equicaloric quantities
of palatable foods (i.e., peanut butter or Ensure) reduces AgRP
neuron activity to magnitudes similar to that for chow. While pre-
vious studies suggest that palatability may drive greater reduc-
tions in AgRP neuron activity, these studies do not account
for the energy density of foods consumed (Chen et al., 2015).
Fourth, post-prandially released satiation signals are sufficient
to inhibit AgRP neuron activity, suggesting that peptides
released following food intake mediate the suppression of
AgRP neuron activity. Taken together, these data show that
calories are both necessary and sufficient—and, importantly,
that external sensory cues are neither necessary nor suffi-
cient—for sustained reduction in AgRP neuron activity.
Rapid Activity Reductions in Homeostatic Systems Are
Learned
Although sensory cues do not sustain reductions in AgRP neuron
activity, AgRP neurons are clearly wired to detect cues that
predict known foods. Our findings begin to unpack how AgRP
circuits learn to respond to these food cues. We find significant
differences in how quickly AgRP neurons respond to novel
nutritive food between the first and subsequent exposures.
The single-trial learning of caloric content is also dynamic, as
breaking the contingency between sensory cues and the nutri-
tive value of food rapidly reverses previously learned associa-
tions that impact anticipatory AgRP neuron activity. These
observations demonstrate that AgRP neurons are wired primarily
to respond to calories and that the preemptive modulation of
these circuits by sensory detection is simply a learned conse-
quence. These data suggest that (1) calories train AgRP circuits
to respond to the sight, smell, and taste of food and that
(2) learning can occur in a single trial. These findings are consis-
tent with our observations that the first exposure to a novel food
or the direct infusion of calories into the stomach produces a
maximal AgRP neuron activity suppression on a much slower
time course (�200 s) than the consumption of a known food
(<1 s). The longer time course may reflect the innate latency of
calorie detection by the GI tract. The nature and site of this
calorie detection and how this detection trains sensory systems
remain interesting questions.
What is the purpose of the preemptive inhibition of AgRP
neuron activity in response to food? In theory, a homeostatic sys-
tem would not require such speed. While our data demonstrate

 that the caloric content of food rapidly entrains the inhibition of
AgRP neurons as a response to food cues, the function of this
rapid sensory inhibition remains unknown. Since these neurons
transmit a negative valence signal to drive food intake (Betley
et al., 2015), it is possible that the rebound in AgRP neuron activity
that occurs when a non-nutritive substance is identified serves as
a reward prediction error (Schultz et al., 1997; Watabe-Uchida
et al., 2017) that devalues non-food substances. This would be
conceptually similar to the function of dopamine neurons in the
ventral tegmental area, which first fire upon presentation of a

 reward but, over time, fire instead at the presentation of a cue
predicting a reward. Conversely, when known food is identified,
AgRP neurons are inhibited, and the negative affect of being hun-
gry is alleviated. This ability to identify food in the environment is
evolutionarily advantageous and, thus, may be ‘‘rewarded’’ by the
reduction in AgRP neuron activity and, correspondingly, a reduc-
tion in negative affect. Why does feeding persist after AgRP neu-
rons are inhibited by sensory cues? It is possible that the animal
has learned to consume a sufficient amount of food to avoid a
resurgence of AgRP neuron activity levels that we observe upon
inadequate consumption of calories (i.e., <1/3 kcal). This learning
system may be ethologically relevant for animals seeking food in a
natural environment, as detection and consumption of sufficient
caloric food is important for survival.
Fast Signaling along the Gut-Brain Axis
Even though maximal AgRP neuron activity reductions induced
by calories in the GI tract require �200 s, we find that the activity
begins to decline within seconds of gastric infusion of a nutritive
substance (Figure 3C). This suggests that, devoid of all external
sensory cues, nutrients have the ability to signal AgRP neurons
along the gut-brain axis within seconds. Fast gut-brain signaling
also occurs in central reward systems, which detect signals from
sweet substances in the GI tract within minutes (Tellez et al.,
2016). However, these rapid effects on neural activity may
require more time to influence behavior, as the emergence of
taste preferences for caloric substances requires �30 min
(Lucas and Sclafani, 1999). One hypothesis that explains the
rapid gut-AgRP neuron signaling is that the gut has ‘‘learned’’
to sense incoming substances that predict calories. Given that
osmotic sensing (infusion of hypertonic saline) and taste sensing
(infusion of sucralose) do not reduce AgRP neuron activity, non-
nutritive interoceptive sensing does not appear to drive AgRP
neuron activity reductions. Since non-nutritive substances
empty from the stomach rapidly (McHugh and Moran, 1979),
we further explored the role of gastric distension by infusing a
load of methylcellulose, a calorie-free and non-digestible
constituent of fiber. Similar to the infusion of water, saline, or
sucralose, mechanical distension of the stomach did not sub-
stantially reduce AgRP neuron activity. Rather, calorie sensing
drives AgRP neuron activity reductions, as gastric infusions of
Ensure, glucose, lipids, and amino acids are each capable of
reducing AgRP neuron activity levels. Taken together, these
findings demonstrate that calorie detection in the gut rapidly
signals the brain to influence homeostatic systems.
A Molecular Mechanism for the Inhibition of AgRP
Neurons
AgRP neurons are inhibited by gastric infusion of nutrients faster
than it takes for these nutrients to reach the brain in circulation
(Page et al., 2013). It is possible that cells with primary receptors
in the gut detect these nutrients (Efeyan et al., 2015) and release
hormones that signal to the brain (Cummings and Overduin,
2007; Sobrino Crespo et al., 2014). Here, we identify molecular
mediators released by the gut upon food intake that reduce
AgRPneuron activity.Wedemonstrateasynergisticeffectofthree
satiation signals: CCK, PYY, and amylin. When administered
together at doses that are individually subthreshold to affect
AgRP neuron activity (Figures 7D and 7E), these 3 peptides strik-
inglyrecapitulatetheeffectofintragastricinfusionofnutrients.The
effect of these hormones on AgRP neurons is the first neural
reflection of the behavioral observation that satiation signals can
act synergistically to reduce food intake (Bhavsar et al., 1998;
Hinton et al., 1986; Roth et al., 2007; Talsania et al., 2005).
Individually, CCK, PYY, and amylin are all known to reduce food
intake (Bhavsar et al., 1998; Kopin et al., 1999; Pittner et al., 2004),
and we demonstrate that each of these peptides reduce AgRP
neuron activity. While amylin only moderately reduces AgRP
neuron activity, the time course and magnitude of the neural
inhibition driven by individual administration of CCK or PYY may
explain both the rapid and sustained suppression observed
following administration of the peptide cocktail. CCK leads to a
rapid and robust inhibition of AgRP neuron activity. Since CCK
is primarily released from cells in the duodenum in the proximal
intestine (Buffa et al., 1976), the fast time course of action is
sensible, as nutrients begin to enter the duodenum shortly after
entering the stomach. Additionally, CCK is thought to act via vagal
afferent CCK1 receptors (Cummings and Overduin, 2007),
providing a plausible explanation for the fast rate of signaling to
AgRP neurons. Conversely, PYY is released primarily by the ileum
of the distal small intestine (Adrian et al., 1985) and is thought to
act both through vagal afferent signaling (Koda et al., 2005)
and through direct action in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus
(Batterham et al., 2002). When the 3 peptides are administered
together, we observe synergistic effects on AgRP neuron activity
whereby the early phase of inhibition is predominantly explained
by the actions of one molecular actor (CCK) and the late phase
of inhibition is explained by another (PYY).
Satiation peptides have become attractive therapeutic agents
for weight loss but have side effects of nausea and vomiting
(Kanoski et al., 2012; le Roux et al., 2008). Thus, we examined
the possibility that the peptide cocktail reduces AgRP neuron
activity by inducing visceral malaise. Our peptide cocktail did
not cause a conditioned taste avoidance, which is a classic
test for nausea and malaise (Ferreira et al., 2006), nor did it cause
alterations in overall locomotor activity. Furthermore, noxious
stimuli that are well known to cause visceral malaise and sick-
ness (i.e., LiCl and LPS) did not affect AgRP neuron activity.
Thus, the reductions we observed in AgRP neuron activity and
feeding behavior induced by this cocktail are not likely due
to malaise or sickness. Together with our data showing that
AgRP
neuron
stimulation
attenuates
the
intake
inhibition
by the peptide cocktail, these observations suggest that
satiation signals, but not signals of visceral malaise, activate a
neural pathway that converges on AgRP neurons to inhibit
food intake.
Interestingly, we identified several satiation peptides known
to reduce food intake that do not affect the activity of AgRP neu-
rons. Given the anatomically distributed control of food intake
(Andermann and Lowell, 2017; Berthoud et al., 2006; Denis
et al., 2015; Grill and Hayes, 2012), this finding is not surprising.
These peptides likely target systems that communicate with other
important neural targets for the regulation of food intake, such as
MC4R neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), the
GABAergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and
hedonic/reward pathways in the midbrain and ventral forebrain.

 Deconstructing the Regulation of AgRP Neurons
Gaining insight into the coordinated regulation of food intake
involves unraveling the complex biological processes that occur
during hunger and satiety. In addition to recent evidence pro-
vided by Beutler et al. (2017), we demonstrate that calories in
consumed nutrients are essential for sustained reductions in
AgRP neuron activity and demonstrate the ability of post-prandial
satiation signals to recapitulate this inhibition. Furthermore, we
have demonstrated that nutrients can train sensory cues to inhibit
AgRP neuron activity in a single trial. Thus, there are two distinct
phases of AgRP neuron inhibition by food: an early, sensory-
driven component that is learned and a slower, nutrient-driven
process. These findings clarify the respective roles of sensory
cues and nutritive, post-ingestive signals on AgRP neuron
activity, laying the foundation for the design of weight loss strate-
gies that are grounded in minimizing AgRP neuron activity.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Further details and an outline of resources used in this work can be found in the
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Animal Strains
All protocols were conducted according to NIH guidelines for animal research
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. Adult male and female mice (2 to 6 months old) were
used. AgRP-IRES-Cre mice were used for monitoring AgRP neuron activity
and crossed with Ai32 mice to express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) for photo-
stimulation experiments. C57BL/6J mice were used for all other experiments.
Dual-Wavelength Fiber Photometry
Two excitation wavelengths (490 nm and 405 nm) were modulated at different
frequencies to detect calcium-dependent and calcium-independent GCaMP6s
fluorescence signals, respectively. The emission lights were converted to
electrical signals by a photoreceiver and demodulated by a real-time processor.
Photostimulation
10-ms pulses of 450-nm light were provided at 20 Hz for 1 s and repeated
every 4 s. The output power at the tip of the terminal fiber was set to ensure
at least 2 mW/mm2 irradiance on AgRP neurons.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as means ± SEMs. Comparisons between two groups
were made with paired or unpaired two-tailed t tests using Prism. One-way,
two-way, and repeated-measures ANOVAs were performed in Prism to
make comparisons across multiple groups. Detailed statistical analyses are
summarized in Table S1.
