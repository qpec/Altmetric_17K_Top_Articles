IMPORTANCE Few tools exist for assessing the risk for early atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (ASCVD) events in young adults.
OBJECTIVE To assess the performance of the Healthy Heart Score (HHS), a lifestyle-based tool
that estimates ASCVD events in older adults, for ASCVD events occurring before 55 years of age.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study included 4893 US adults
aged 18 to 30 years from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)
study. Participants underwent measurement of lifestyle factors from March 25, 1985, through
June 7, 1986, and were followed up for a median of 27.1 years (interquartile range, 26.9-27.2
years). Data for this study were analyzed from February 24 through December 12, 2016.
EXPOSURES The HHS includes age, smoking status, body mass index, alcohol intake, exercise,
and a diet score composed of self-reported daily intake of cereal fiber, fruits and/or vegetables,
nuts, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red and/or processed meats. The HHS in the CARDIA
study was calculated using sex-specific equations produced by its derivation cohorts.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The ability of the HHS to assess the 25-year risk for ASCVD
(death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and fatal or nonfatal
ischemic stroke) in the total sample, in race- and sex-specific subgroups, and in those with
and without clinical ASCVD risk factors at baseline. Model discrimination was assessed with
the Harrell C statistic; model calibration, with Greenwood-Nam-D’
Agostino statistics.
RESULTS The study population of 4893 participants included 2205 men (45.1%) and 2688
women (54.9%) with a mean (SD) age at baseline of 24.8 (3.6) years; 2483 (50.7%) were
black; and 427 (8.7%) had at least 1 clinical ASCVD risk factor (hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
or diabetes types 1 and 2). Among these participants, 64 premature ASCVD events occurred
in women and 99 in men. The HHS showed moderate discrimination for ASCVD risk
assessment in this diverse population of mostly healthy young adults (C statistic, 0.71; 95%
CI, 0.66-0.76); it performed better in men (C statistic, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68-0.79) than in
women (C statistic, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.75); in white (C statistic, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.71-0.84)
than in black (C statistic, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.60-0.72) participants; and in those without
(C statistic, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66-0.76) vs with (C statistic, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.55-0.73) clinical risk
factors at baseline. The HHS was adequately calibrated overall and within each subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The HHS, when measured in younger persons without ASCVD
risk factors, performs moderately well in assessing risk for ASCVD events by early middle age.
Its reliance on self-reported, modifiable lifestyle factors makes it an attractive tool for risk
assessment and counseling for early ASCVD prevention.

ortality rates associated with atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease (ASCVD) have steadily declined in
past decades owing to advances in prevention, de-
tection, and treatment.1 Unfortunately, scientists caution this
trend may soon reverse owing to increasing obesity rates and
unhealthy diet and exercise patterns in younger individuals.2
Adolescents and young adults are a prime target for ASCVD
prevention efforts,3,4 especially because most do not yet have
major clinical risk factors for ASCVD, such as hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.1 Often termed primordial
prevention, such efforts to prevent the development of these
clinical risk factors through healthy behaviors hold promise
for reducing ASCVD events across the life course.5 Decades of
epidemiologic research have demonstrated that adults who
maintain optimal levels of traditional ASCVD risk factors over
time have low rates of ASCVD.6-8 Furthermore, restoration of
lowriskisdifficultaftertheseclinicalriskfactorsdevelop,even
with efficacious pharmacologic treatment.9
Although numerous risk calculators exist to estimate the
future risk for ASCVD among individuals and populations,10
fewarevalidatedforuseinadultsyoungerthan30yearsofage.
Even fewer focus on the behavioral factors (diet, exercise, to-
bacco exposure, and weight status) that are key for primor-
dial prevention and most likely to need improvement in this
age group. One promising lifestyle-based tool to estimate
ASCVD risk is the Healthy Heart Score (HHS).11 Chiuve et al11
developedtheHHSformiddle-agedadultsforwhomtheshort-
term risk for ASCVD is low but the long-term risk is high.12,13
A range of health behaviors known to affect the develop-
ment of ASCVD risk factors were considered in the develop-
ment of the tool. Derived and validated in adults aged 40 to
75 years at the time of lifestyle factor measurement, the HHS
demonstrated good discrimination (C statistic, 0.72 in men
and 0.77 in women) and calibration for predicting ASCVD
events during 24 years of follow-up, especially for individu-
als without elevated blood pressure or cholesterol levels at
baseline.8
The ability of the HHS to estimate ASCVD events in indi-
viduals without established clinical risk factors makes it an at-
tractivetoolforestimatingearlyASCVDeventsinyoungadults.
The present study aimed to assess the performance of the HHS
for estimating ASCVD events occurring before 55 years of age
in a population of young adults aged 18 to 30 years at the time
of lifestyle factor measurement.
Methods
Study Sample
The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDIA) study is a population-based longitudinal cohort be-
gun with baseline collection of data from March 25, 1985,
throughJune7,1986,with5115youngadultsaged18to30years
from 4 sites across the United States (University of Alabama
atBirmingham;NorthwesternUniversity,Chicago,Illinois;Uni-
versity of Minnesota, Minneapolis; and Kaiser Permanente of
Oakland, California).14 Participants were selected to include
approximately equal distribution by sex, self-identified race
(black or white), educational attainment (high school gradu-
ateorbeyond),andage(18-24or25-30years).Participantswere
contacted for follow-up every 6 months and queried regard-
ing interim medical events annually. For the current analy-
ses, participants missing data required to complete the HHS
at baseline or who were pregnant at the baseline examination
were excluded, for a final sample of 4893 individuals (95.7%
of the original cohort). The CARDIA study has been continu-
ously approved by the institutional review boards at each of
the 4 sites, and all participants provided written informed con-
sent to participate.
Healthy Heart Score
Chiuve et al11 developed the HHS using data from 61 025
women in the Nurses’Health Study (NHS) and 34 478 men in
the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) who did not
have ASCVD, cancer, or diabetes at the time of baseline ascer-
tainmentofhealthhabitsin1986.Themean(SD)ageforwomen
and men at baseline was 52 (7) and 52 (9) years; women were
followedupforamedianof23.9years(interquartilerange,0.24
years) and men for a median of 23.7 years (interquartile range,
0.28 years). To derive the most parsimonious model to best
estimate20-yearriskforischemicASCVDevents(nonfatalmyo-
cardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, and ischemic
stroke, all verified through medical record review), the inves-
tigators considered a variety of health behaviors previously
shown to be associated with ASCVD in the literature. The fi-
nal sex-specific score included age (in years), smoking status
(past, current, or never), body mass index (BMI) (calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), ex-
ercise (hours per week), alcohol consumption (grams per day),
and a diet score consisting of cereal fiber consumption (grams
per day) and servings of fruits and/or vegetables, nuts, sugar-
sweetened beverages, and red and/or processed meats (serv-
ings per day) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Because the origi-
nal HHS includes negative coefficients for unhealthy dietary
habits such as intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and red
and/or processed meat, negative values of the dietary compo-
nent of the score are possible. A higher overall HHS indicates
Key Points
Question How effective is a lifestyle-based risk tool at estimating
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events that occur before 55
years of age?
Findings In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young
Adults cohort study, the Healthy Heart Score performed
moderately well at estimating the 25-year risk for early
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events when applied to
healthy adults aged 18 to 30 years. The Healthy Heart Score did
not perform as well in young adults who already had at least 1
clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factor, such as
elevated blood pressure or cholesterol or glucose levels.
Meaning The Healthy Heart Score is an attractive tool for risk
assessment and counseling for primary prevention of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, especially in those who
have not yet developed traditional clinical risk factors.

Application of the HHS to the CARDIA Cohort
We calculated the HHS for each CARDIA participant using data
from the baseline 1985-1986 examination. Body mass index
was calculated from height and weight measured with par-
ticipants wearing light clothing and no shoes. Physical activ-
ity was measured with the CARDIA Physical Activity History
questionnaire, which assesses 13 categories of varying inten-
sity during the past 12 months.15 We included only data re-
garding moderate- to vigorous-intensity activities assessed in
CARDIA (running, racquet sports, biking, swimming, danc-
ing,basketball/softball,andbowling/golf)tobeconsistentwith
exercise categories assessed in the NHS and HPFS derivation
cohorts. Because the CARDIA Physical Activity questionnaire
did not ask about hours per week of physical activity, we cal-
culated hours per week by multiplying the number of months
inwhichparticipantsreportedmeetingthethresholdofxhours
per week of each activity by 4.2 weeks, then divided by 52
weeks per year to arrive at x hours per week. We then summed
eachoftheactivitycategoriestocreateavariablefortotalhours
perweekofmoderate-tovigorous-intensityexercise.Foodand
alcohol intake during the previous 28 days was assessed with
the CARDIA dietary history interview.16 Cereal fiber data were
not available in CARDIA; therefore, we used grams per day of
fiber intake from whole grain foods as a surrogate because
correlations between whole grain and cereal fiber were high
in the original cohorts from which the HHS was derived.17
Cigarette smoking, age, sex, and race were self-reported via
questionnaire.
Assessment of Clinical ASCVD Risk Factors
and ASCVD Events
We defined the presence of clinical ASCVD risk factors at the
baseline examination as any hypertension (measured blood
pressure, ≥140/90 mm Hg or use of blood pressure–lowering
medication), hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level
≥240 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0259] or use of medication to lower lipid levels), or diabe-
tes (fasting glucose level ≥126 mg/dL [to convert to milli-
moles per liter, multiply by 0.0555] or self-reported diabe-
tes). Blood pressure was measured after 5 minutes of rest in
the seated position using a random zero sphygmomanom-
eter; the means of the second and third systolic and fifth-
phase diastolic recordings were used.18 After a 12-hour fast,
total cholesterol and glucose levels were measured using
standard methods.18 Participants self-reported medication
use and clinical history of diabetes.
WedefinedtheoutcomeofASCVDeventsasanydeathdue
to coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and
fatalornonfatalischemicstroke.Participantswereaskedabout
hospitalizations during annual telephone interviews, and
deaths were reported by participants’next-of-kin every 6
months.19 Reported events were validated through medical
record review from year 15 onward and adjudicated by 2 mem-
bers of the morbidity and mortality committee using stan-
dard definitions.20-23
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from February 24 through December 6,
2016. We estimated the 25-year risk for ASCVD using Cox pro-
portional hazards models. The HHS was calculated using the
originalcoefficientsfromtheHHSderivationcohortsfirst,then
withCARDIAcohort–specificcoefficientsinasecondaryanaly-
sis. Proportional hazard assumptions were found to be appro-
priate. We evaluated the predictive utility of the HHS in the
CARDIA sample based on discrimination and calibration of the
model for the full study sample, then separately for men and
women, for white and black participants, and for those with
and without risk factors. Discrimination assesses the ability of
the model to differentiate those with and without events and
was evaluated using the Harrell C statistic; larger values indi-
cate better discrimination. We compared the discrimination
of models incorporating the HHS score with models includ-
ingageonly.Weassessedcalibrationusingplotscomparingthe
estimatedprobabilitiesofASCVDwiththeobservedeventrates.
We used the Greenwood-Nam-D’
Agostino statistic to evalu-
ate goodness of fit of the models. All analyses were con-
ducted using SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Baseline characteristics of the 4893 individuals included in the
sample are displayed in Table 1. Mean (SD) age at ascertain-
mentoftheHHSwas24.8(3.6)years;2688participants(54.9%)
werewomen;2205(45.1%)weremen;2483(50.7%)wereblack;
and 427 (8.7%) had at least 1 clinical ASCVD risk factor (hyper-
tension, hyperlipidemia, or diabetes) at baseline. CARDIA par-
ticipants were a mean of 27 years younger than participants
in the NHS and HPFS cohorts in which the HHS was derived
and thus had lower mean HHS scores (Table 2). CARDIA par-
ticipants had slightly lower mean BMI levels and better exer-
cise habits compared with NHS and HPFS participants but
poorer diet quality and greater frequency of smoking.
Duringamedianfollowupof27.1years(interquartilerange,
26.9-27.2 years), 69 total ASCVD events occurred in 64 women
(31 coronary heart disease events [1.2% of female partici-
pants] and 38 ischemic stroke events [1.4% of female partici-
pants]) and 104 total ASCVD events occurred in 99 men (75
coronary heart disease events [3.4% of male participants] and
29 ischemic stroke events [1.3% of male participants]). The in-
cidence of ASCVD per 1000 person-years was 0.90 for women
and 1.75 for men. ASCVD events occurred at a mean age of 45.9
years (range, 28.0-58.8 years). Most cases (121 of 163 [74.2%])
occurred in participants with no clinical ASCVD risk factors at
the baseline examination, although participants who later had
an ASCVD event had higher mean systolic and diastolic blood
pressures and fasting glucose and total cholesterol levels in
young adulthood compared with those who did not (eTable in
the Supplement). Participants who experienced an ASCVD
event had on average unhealthier levels of all HHS variables
in young adulthood (eTable in the Supplement).
The discrimination of the HHS was moderate in the
CARDIA study. Compared with the model with age only, the
HHS score increased the C statistic from 0.63 (95% CI, 0.59-

 0.68) to 0.71 (95% CI, 0.66-0.76). Furthermore, the HHS in-
creased the C statistic compared with models based on age
alone for all subgroups (Table 3). We further compared model
discrimination across subgroups. The model performed bet-
ter in white vs black participants (C statistic difference, 0.11;
95% CI, 0.02-0.20) and somewhat better in men vs women
(C statistic difference, 0.05; 95% CI, −0.03 to 0.13) and in the
absence vs presence of clinical risk factors at baseline (C sta-
tistic difference, 0.08; 95% CI, −0.03 to 0.19). Model discrimi-
nation was weakest for those with at least 1 clinical ASCVD risk
factor at baseline (C statistic, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.55-0.73).
Application of cohort-specific coefficients for the lifestyle fac-
tors improved model discrimination slightly (Table 3). The
Greenwood-Nam-D’
Agostino statistic suggested adequate fit
of the HHS model for the total population and for all subgroups
(Table 3). The HHS model was overall well calibrated for 25-
year ASCVD risk assessment based on the calibration plots for
the total population (C statistic, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66-0.76)
(Figure) and all subgroups (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this population of healthy young adults with low rates of
traditional clinical ASCVD risk factors similar to rates seen in
nationally representative samples of the same age group,1 the
HHS performed moderately well at estimating 25-year risk for
early ASCVD events. The C statistics for the HHS in the total
population, for white participants, and for men are similar to
those seen in the original derivation cohorts.8 They also ap-
proach those seen with the Framingham Risk Score (which has
C statistics of 0.75 to 0.80, depending on the population),24 a
well-established tool for estimating 10-year risk for ASCVD
events in middle-aged and older adults. Because the 10-year
risk for ASCVD events is so low in individuals younger than 30
years, the Framingham Risk Score and other 10-year risk cal-
culators such as the 2013 American College of Cardiology–
American Heart Association Pooled Cohort Equations25 have
limited utility in this younger population. Furthermore, those

 10-year risk calculators incorporate the clinical ASCVD risk fac-
tors of elevated blood pressure, blood cholesterol level, and
diabetes, which often have not yet developed in young adults.
The HHS did not perform particularly well in CARDIA partici-
pants who had already established clinical ASCVD risk factors.
Therefore, a risk calculator that uses lifestyle and clinical risk
factors may best estimate ASCVD risk in those individuals.
The major strength of the HHS lies in its reliance on life-
style factors, including BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, physi-
cal activity, and dietary patterns, all of which can easily be self-
reported. Practicing physicians could choose to have patients
complete the HHS in advance of a visit at home or in the wait-
ing area and use the resulting report to begin a patient-
centered discussion of ways to improve cardiovascular health
and prevent early ASCVD. The HHS could also be used to edu-
cate young persons about their ASCVD risk at community-
based public health outreach events or online through web-
sites and social media. This outreach could be coupled with
healthpromotionmaterialsorindividuallytailoredactionplans
targeting healthy behavior change, as well as encouragement
to follow up with a primary care physician for additional blood
pressure, cholesterol level, and diabetes screening as needed.

 Lack of awareness of cardiovascular risk factors among young
adultsiswelldocumented,26andthisagegroupisalsothemost
likely to forego routine primary care.27 Whether and how a risk
estimation tool such as the HHS can be used to motivate young
persons to seek regular primary care and lower their risk for
ASCVD through behavior change remains an area for future
research.
PreviousstudiesintheCARDIAcohorthavefoundthatpar-
ticipants who adopted healthy lifestyle factors after young
adulthood had lower odds of subclinical atherosclerosis28 and
a higher prevalence of the low cardiovascular risk profile29 in
middle age compared with participants who did not demon-
strate behavior change. In older adults, the HHS estimates
ASCVD events and the antecedent clinical risk factors of hy-
pertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.30 The prevention of
these risk factors through sustained healthy lifestyle behav-
iorsisaviablestrategyforreducingASCVDmorbidityandmor-
tality. Because few individuals retain the full constellation of
healthy behaviors and absence of clinical risk factors identi-
fied by the American Heart Association as ideal cardiovascu-
lar health,1 individual and population strategies are needed to
increase the HHS of young adults worldwide.
Limitations
Study limitations should be noted. Healthy Heart Score vari-
ablesotherthanBMIwereself-reportedandaresubjecttomea-
surement error and desirability bias. We used modified di-
etary variables (substituting whole grain for cereal fiber) and
physical activity variables (calculating total hours per week
from more general estimates of exercise habits). In general,
these limitations most likely improved the HHS score of
CARDIA participants, thus underestimating the risk for ASCVD
events. Vital status data were not available for 307 individu-
als (6.0%); censoring these individuals before the full 25 years
of follow-up also likely underestimates the performance of the
models. Other factors such as family history of early ASCVD,
illicit drug use, or pregnancy-related complications may be im-
portant in the pathogenesis of ASCVD events in younger per-
sons; because our goal was to validate the previously pub-
lished HHS, we did not investigate the role of these potential
factors.Finally,healthbehaviorswereascertainedandtheHHS
was calculated at only 1 point. Young adulthood is a time of
significantchange,andimprovementsinhealthbehaviorsdur-
ing this period have been shown to reduce the likelihood of
havingintermediatemarkersofatherosclerosisintheCARDIA28
and other longitudinal cohorts.31
Conclusions
Among participants aged 18 to 30 years in a longitudinal co-
hort study, the HHS performed moderately well at assessing
the risk for an ASCVD event before 55 years of age, especially
when applied to individuals without any established clinical
ASCVDriskfactors.Itsrelianceonself-reported,modifiablelife-
style factors makes it an attractive tool for risk assessment and
counseling for early ASCVD prevention.
