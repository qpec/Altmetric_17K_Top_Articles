IMPORTANCE Few data are available concerning surgical site infection (SSI) and noninfectious
wound complications (NIWCs) after delayed (DR) and secondary reconstruction (SR)
compared with immediate reconstruction (IR) procedures in the breast.
OBJECTIVE To compare the incidence of SSI and NIWCs after implant and autologous IR, DR,
and SR breast procedures after mastectomy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included women aged
18 to 64 years undergoing mastectomy from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2011.
Data were abstracted from a commercial insurer claims database in 12 states and analyzed
from January 1, 2015, through February 7, 2017.
EXPOSURES Reconstruction within 7 days of mastectomy was considered immediate.
Reconstruction more than 7 days after mastectomy was considered delayed if the
mastectomy did not include IR or secondary if the mastectomy included IR.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification diagnosis codes for SSI and NIWCs.
RESULTS Mastectomy was performed in 17 293 women (mean [SD] age, 50.4 [8.5] years);
61.4% of women had IR or DR. Among patients undergoing implant reconstruction, the
incidence of SSI was 8.9% (685 of 7655 women) for IR, 5.7% (21 of 369) for DR, and 3.2%
(167 of 5150) for SR. Similar results were found for NIWCs. In contrast, the incidence of SSI
was similar after autologous IR (9.8% [177 of 1799]), DR (13.9% [19 of 137]), and SR (11.6% [11
of 95]) procedures. Compared with women without an SSI after implant IR, women with an
SSI after implant IR were significantly more likely to have another SSI (47 of 412 [11.4%] vs 131
of 4791 [2.7%]) and an NIWC (24 of 412 [5.8%] vs 120 of 4791 [2.5%]) after SR. The incidence
of SSI (24 of 379 [6.3%] vs 152 of 5286 [2.9%]) and NIWC (22 of 379 [5.8%] vs 129 of 5286
[2.4%]) after implant SR was higher in women who had received adjuvant radiotherapy.
Wound complications after IR were associated with significantly more breast surgical
procedures (mean of 1.92 procedures [range, 0-9] after implant IR and 1.11 [range, 0-6] after
autologous IR) compared with women who did not have a complication (mean of 1.37
procedures [range, 0-8] after implant IR and 0.87 [range, 0-6] after autologous IR).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The incidence of SSI and NIWCs was slightly higher for
implant IR compared with delayed or secondary implant reconstruction. Women who had an
SSI or NIWC after implant IR had a higher risk for subsequent complications after SR and more
breast operations. The risk for complications should be carefully balanced with the
psychosocial and technical benefits of IR. Select high-risk patients may benefit from
consideration of delayed rather than immediate implant reconstruction to decrease breast
complications after mastectomy.

reast reconstruction is increasingly performed after
mastectomyinwomenwithbreastcancer1,2andforpro-
phylaxis in women at high risk for breast cancer.
Steadily increasing use of mastectomy in women with early
breast cancer has been reported in the past decade, along
with increasing use of bilateral mastectomy, even for unilat-
eral disease.3 Coinciding with this trend is increased use of im-
mediate breast reconstruction (IR), particularly in women un-
dergoing bilateral mastectomy, more than half of whom
undergo reconstruction.3,4 Using the Nationwide Inpatient
Sample, the proportion of women undergoing mastectomy for
cancerorprophylaxiswithIRincreasedbyalmost1.5-foldfrom
28.5% in 2005 to 42% in 2011 (M.A.O., unpublished data;
November 2015).
Immediate breast reconstruction is often recommended
towomenundergoingmastectomybecauseitisthoughttocon-
fer psychosocial benefits and result in better cosmesis.5 The
true influence of reconstruction on quality of life is difficult
to assess, because women who only undergo mastectomy tend
to be older, white, have higher educational attainment, and
place less importance on body image than women who un-
dergobreastreconstruction.6-9TheperceivedbenefitofIRdoes
not, however, take into account the potential for serious com-
plications, including delays in initiating chemotherapy and
radiotherapy that may affect the potential for cure, survival,
quality of life, psychosocial well-being, return to work, and
overall cost.
Theproportionofwomenwithhigh-riskcharacteristicsun-
dergoing implant IR has increased 3-fold since the late 1990s,
driven primarily by increased use of implant reconstruction.10
Increased use of IR was found in all high-risk groups by Albor-
noz et al10 using the National Cancer Database, including
the elderly, women with advanced breast cancer, women
with comorbidities, and women who required adjuvant
radiotherapy.
Few studies with sufficient sample size in the literature
compare wound complication rates, including surgical site
infection (SSI) and noninfectious wound complications
(NIWCs), to make firm conclusions about the relative inci-
denceofcomplicationsafterIRvsdelayedreconstruction(DR).
Given this paucity of data, we compared the incidence of
wound complications after implant and/or autologous IR, DR,
and secondary breast reconstruction (SR) using insurance
claims data from nonelderly (aged 18-64 years) women. The
goal of this study was to determine and compare complica-
tion rates to facilitate discussion of options with women con-
sidering breast reconstruction and the timing of reconstruc-
tive surgery after mastectomy (ie, IR vs DR).
Methods
Data
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 12
Anthem-affiliated plans in the HealthCore Integrated Re-
search Database, including individuals from 12 Anthem-
affiliatedplans(California,Connecticut,Georgia,Indiana,Ken-
tucky, Maine, Missouri [excluding 30 counties in the Kansas
City area], Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, and Vir-
ginia [excluding the northern suburbs of Washington, DC]).
Data include all fully adjudicated claims submitted from cli-
nicians, facilities, and outpatient pharmacies linked to health
plan enrollment information. Fully insured women with en-
rollment in a fee-for-service plan and complete medical cov-
erage were eligible for cohort inclusion. We excluded women
with codes for end-stage renal disease, organ transplant, or hu-
man immunodeficiency virus owing to unique risk factors for
complications. Medical claims were restricted to paid claims.
This study was approved by the Washington University Hu-
man Research Protection Office, which did not require in-
formed consent for this retrospective review of claims data.
Patient Population
We identified mastectomy operations among women aged 18
to 64 years from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2011,
using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
ClinicalModification(ICD-9-CM)and/orCurrentProceduralTer-
minology, 4th edition (CPT-4) procedure codes from inpa-
tient and outpatient facility and clinician claims, as previ-
ously described.11 We limited primary analyses to the first
mastectomy per patient and the first subsequent reconstruc-
tion procedure within 365 days of mastectomy. We required
at least 90 days of insurance coverage after the mastectomy
and after the first DR or SR to identify SSIs and NIWCs. Pa-
tient characteristics, including demographic features, comor-
bidities, and cancer-related and operative factors, were de-
fined as previously described.12
Procedure Dates and Definitions
Mastectomy and reconstruction dates within 7 days were col-
lapsed into single-surgery dates because of potential date
inaccuracy.11 An implant or autologous breast reconstruction
code within 7 days of the index mastectomy was considered
IR.Breastreconstructioncodedmorethan7daysafterthemas-
tectomy date was considered to be a subsequent reconstruc-
tion, which we defined as delayed if the index mastectomy did
not involve IR and secondary if the index mastectomy in-
cluded IR.
Key Points
Question Does the incidence of wound complications differ after
implant and autologous immediate, delayed, and secondary breast
reconstruction?
Findings In this cohort study of 17 293 patients who underwent
mastectomy, the incidence of surgical site infection was
significantly higher after immediate (8.9%) compared with
delayed (6.0%) and secondary (3.3%) implant reconstructions,
with similar results for noninfectious wound complications. In
contrast, the incidence of surgical site infection was similar after
immediate (9.8%), delayed (13.9%), and secondary (11.6%)
autologous reconstructions.
Meaning Delayed implant rather than immediate implant
reconstruction may be beneficial in some high-risk patients to
reduce the risk of wound complications.

 Classification of Procedures
We classified mastectomy and IR as described previously.11 Im-
plant IR included tissue expander and permanent implant in-
sertion;autologousIRincludedlatissimusdorsi,transverserec-
tus abdominus myocutaneous, deep inferior epigastric artery
perforator, superficial inferior epigastric artery, and gluteal ar-
tery perforator flaps. Delayed reconstruction included im-
plant insertion and/or autologous reconstruction; SR in-
cluded implant insertion, exchange of tissue expander or
permanent prosthesis (CPT-4 code 11970 or codes for implant
removalplusinsertion),and/orautologousreconstruction.Im-
plant DR procedures were excluded if another implant recon-
structioncode(s)wasused,suggestingthattheprocedureswere
morelikelytobesecondstage(CPT-4codes11970,11971,19328,
19370,19371,or19380;ICD-9-CMprocedurecodes85.93,85.94,
or 85.96). Secondary reconstruction included second-stage or
revision ipsilateral reconstruction and symmetry procedures
on the contralateral breast. In addition to the implant and au-
tologous procedures captured as part of IR, DR, or SR, other
reconstruction procedures were captured within 2 years af-
ter the index mastectomy, including implant removal with-
out insertion, revision of reconstruction, mastopexy, capsu-
lectomy, nipple reconstruction, and reduction mammoplasty.
Identification and Timing of SSIs and NIWCs
We identified SSIs using a claims-based adaptation of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Health-
care Safety Network definition of SSI.13 We identified NIWCs
(ie, tissue necrosis, dehiscence, hematoma, and fat necrosis)
using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, as described previously.11,14
The time frame for identifying wound complications was
limited to 2 to 90 days after each immediate, delayed, and
secondary reconstructive operation (1-90 days for hema-
toma; hematomas can occur soon after the procedure)
because we only required health insurance coverage through
90 days after each procedure. Complications were further
categorized by severity. We defined serious complications as
those diagnosed during an inpatient admission or within 14
days before or after surgical wound care (incision/drainage
codes except ICD-9-CM procedure codes 85.91, 86.01, and
86.28)14 requiring reoperation (identified by UB-04 medical
revenue code[s] for operating room services) or implant
removal or exchange (CPT-4 code 11970 or codes for implant
removal plus insertion).11 In the analysis of complications
after secondary reconstruction, 198 women with implant IR
were excluded because they had an SSI coded more than 90
days after the index mastectomy, of whom 105 underwent
SR. Similarly, 136 women with implant IR were excluded
because they had an NIWC coded more than 90 days after the
index mastectomy, of whom 79 underwent SR.
Identification of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy
Adjuvant treatment was defined as having 2 or more distinct
dates coded for radiotherapy or chemotherapy, as defined pre-
viously except for ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for chemo-
therapy and radiotherapy and CPT-4 code 96402 for
chemotherapy.12 We examined the association of radio-
therapy with complications after DR and SR, including only ra-
diotherapy after mastectomy and before DR or SR. To exam-
ine the association of IR complications within 90 days with
initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, we de-
termined the time to first chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy
treatment within 365 days of mastectomy, excluding women
who had treatment initiation before a wound complication.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from January 1, 2015, through February
7, 2017. We compared the incidence of wound complications
within 90 days after IR, DR, or SR using a χ2 test or logistic re-
gressionforunpairedcomparisons.TheMcNemartestwasused
forpairedcomparisonsofcomplicationsafterimplantIRvsim-
plant SR within a woman. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to
compare continuous variables. All data management and sta-
tistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version
9.3; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
A total of 17 293 women (mean [SD] age, 50.4 [8.5] years) with
mastectomy met study eligibility criteria (Figure 1). Mastec-
tomy procedures included IR in 10 047 women (58.1%), of
which7655(76.2%)involvedanimplantonly;1799(17.9%),au-
tologous reconstruction; and 593 (5.9%), autologous plus im-
plant reconstruction. A total of 6425 women had at least 1 sub-
sequent breast reconstruction procedure within 1 year after
mastectomy; the breakdown of DR vs SR and type of recon-
structive procedure is shown in Figure 1. Most implant IR and
implant DR procedures involved tissue expanders (7102
[92.8%] and 349 [94.6%], respectively), whereas most im-
plant SR procedures involved a permanent implant (5207
[91.9%]).
Women who had DR (vs IR) were more likely to live in a
rural (vs urban) location (69 [18.8%] vs 667 [9.7%]; P < .001);
have tobacco use disorder (62 [16.8%] vs 831 [12.1%]; P = .007);
use oral corticiosteroids (54 [14.7%] vs 695 [10.1%]; P = .01);
have anemia (29 [7.9%] vs 379 [5.5%]; P = .05); have a higher
cancer stage, defined as regional or metastatic cancer (135
[23.5%] vs 1734 [17.3%]; P < .001); and were less likely to have
hadpreviousbreastcancer(45[12.2%]vs1170[17.0%];P = .02).
WomenwithDRwerealsomorelikelytohaveundergonemodi-
fiedradicalmastectomy(163[44.3%]vs2227[32.4%];P < .001)
and unilateral mastectomy (240 [65.2%] vs 3118 [45.3%];
P < .001).
Overall Wound Complication Incidence After Reconstruction
The incidence of SSI and NIWCs within 90 days after IR, DR,
and SR are shown in Table 1. Overall, 865 SSIs (74.9%) and 734
NIWCs(59.0%)werecategorizedasseriouscomplications.The
incidence of SSI and NIWCs were significantly higher after im-
plant IR (373 of 5150 [7.2%] and 420 of 5150 [8.2%], respec-
tively) compared with implant SR (167 of 5150 [3.2%] and 134
of 5150 [2.6%]; P < .001 for both in matched comparisons
within a woman) (Table 1). The 90-day SSI incidence was sig-
nificantly higher after implant IR (685 of 7655 [8.9%]) com-
pared with implant DR (21 of 369 [5.7%]; P = .04) (Table 1). The

 SSIincidencewasalsosignificantlyhigherafterimplantIRcom-
pared with implant SR after autologous tissue flap plus im-
plant IR (6 of 340 [1.8%]; P < .001) and with implant SR after
autologous IR (3 of 175 [1.7%]; P = .003). Similarly, the 90-day
NIWC rates were significantly higher after implant IR (717 of
7655 [9.4%]) compared with implant DR (15 of 369 [4.1%]) and
implant SR after autologous tissue flap plus implant IR (9 of
340 [2.7%]; P < .001) and with implant SR after autologous tis-
sue flap IR (8 of 175 [4.6%]; P = .03). In contrast, the 90-day
wound complication rates were similar in women who under-
went autologous tissue flap reconstruction regardless of the
timing of reconstruction (Table 1). In women undergoing IR,
we found no difference in the incidence of SSI (629 of 7102
[8.9%]vs56of553[10.1%];P = .31)orNIWC(664of7102[9.3%]
vs 53 of 553 [9.6%]; P = .86) based on the use of tissue expand-
ers vs permanent implants.
Failed implant reconstruction, defined as implant re-
moval or exchange within 60 days of insertion, occurred in 532
women (7.0%) after IR and 30 women (8.1%) after DR (P = .39).
Among women with SSI, implant failure occurred in 300 IR
(43.8%) and 12 DR procedures (57.1%; P = .23).
Influence of Wound Complications After IR
The association of SSI after implant IR with wound complica-
tions after SR is shown in Figure 2A. The incidence of SSI af-
ter SR (implant or autologous) in women who had an SSI after
implant IR was significantly higher than in women who did not
have an SSI within 365 days after implant IR (47 of 412 [11.4%]
vs 131 of 4791 [2.7%]; P < .001). An analogous result was ob-
tained for NIWCs, with significantly higher incidence of
NIWCs in women who had an SSI after implant IR compared
with women without an SSI after implant IR (24 of 412 [5.8%]

17 293 Patients undergoing
mastectomya
a We required all women included in the study population to have at least 90
days of insurance coverage after mastectomy. The women with subsequent
breast reconstruction procedure(s) were more likely to have at least 1 year of
health insurance coverage after mastectomy than those without a subsequent
reconstruction procedure (5763 [89.7%] vs 8194 [75.4%]; P < .001). Among
women with less than 1 year of coverage after mastectomy, those with a
subsequent procedure had a greater median number of days of health
insurance coverage (295 vs 227 days; P < .001).
bImmediate reconstruction (IR) occurred within 7 days of mastectomy.
c Includes tissue expander or permanent implant.
dIncludes use of an autologous tissue flap (abdominal, buttock, and back tissue
transferred on its vascular pedicle or by free tissue transfer microsurgical
anastomosis techniques).
e Includes use of an implant and autologous tissue flap, as defined above.
f Includes a woman’
s first subsequent reconstruction 8 to 365 days after the
index mastectomy. The first subsequent implant reconstruction (secondary
reconstruction [SR] or delayed reconstruction [DR]) was performed a median
of 156 days after mastectomy (interquartile range [IQR], 112-210 days); the first
subsequent autologous reconstruction (with or without implant), a median of
232 days (IQR, 157-294 days) after mastectomy (P < .001). Implant DR was
performed at a later date after mastectomy than was implant SR (181 days
[IQR, 113-252 days] vs 155 days [IQR, 112-207 days]; P < .001), and autologous
DR was performed at a later date than was autologous SR (250 days
[IQR, 189-299 days] vs 209 days [IQR, 133-279 days]; P = .007).
g Performed in patients without IR.
h Indicates no implant or flap reconstruction within 365 days of mastectomy.
Implant procedures consistent with contralateral procedures were included in
this group (eg, implant insertion in a woman with unilateral mastectomy
without immediate reconstruction but with other code[s] consistent with
secondary implant procedures [eg, capsulectomy]). Because we only required
90 days of health insurance enrollment after mastectomy, some women may
have had DR at 91 to 365 days that we could not identify owing to cessation of
insurance coverage.

 vs 120 of 4791 [2.5%]; P < .001). When the analysis was re-
stricted to women who had only implant SR (excluding women
with autologous SR after implant IR), the SSI rate after im-
plant SR remained significantly higher in women who had an
SSI after implant IR compared with women without an SSI af-
ter implant IR (42 of 373 [11.3%] vs 117 of 4673 [2.5%]; P < .001).
Similar to the results depicted in Figure 2A, the rates of NIWC
and SSI after SR were significantly higher in women with an
NIWC after implant IR (35 of 455 [7.7%] and 42 of 455 [9.2%],
respectively; P < .001) (Figure 2B).
Compared with women without a wound complication af-
ter IR, women with IR-associated wound complications un-
derwent significantly more breast procedures within 2 years
after the index operation (Table 2). The difference in number
of procedures after implant IR was greater in women with SSI

andNIWCs(mean,1.12;range,0-6)vswomenwithoutawound

wound complication after IR started chemotherapy 2 weeks
later than women who did not have an IR wound complica-
tion (median start of chemotherapy, 53 vs 39 days after mas-
tectomy; P < .001). Similarly, women who had a wound com-
plication after IR had a median 3-week delay in initiation of
radiotherapycomparedwithwomenwhodidnothaveawound
complication after IR (median start of radiotherapy, 162 vs 142
days after mastectomy; P < .001).
Association of Adjuvant Radiotherapy With Incidence
of Wound Complications
Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered after mastectomy to
34 of 369 women before implant DR (9.2%) and 379 of 5665
women before implant SR (6.7%) (Table 3). Prior receipt of ad-
juvant radiotherapy was associated with approximately 2-fold
higher incidence of wound complications after implant SR but
was not associated with higher complication rates in women
who underwent implant DR after adjuvant radiotherapy
(Table 3). Among women who had subsequent autologous tis-
sue reconstruction, 85 of 205 (41.5%) with autologous DR and
51 of 186 (27.4%) with autologous SR received adjuvant radio-
therapybeforethereconstruction.Theincidenceofanywound
complication was not significantly different when compar-
ing implant DR, autologous DR, or autologous SR according to
receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy, although the number of
womenwithcomplicationsinindividualcomparisonswasvery
small (Table 3).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the largest to date comparing
rates of SSI and NIWCs after immediate, delayed, and sec-
ondary breast reconstruction. We found that the incidence
of wound complications was higher after implant IR than
after implant DR or SR. In contrast, no difference was found
in the incidence of complications after autologous IR com-

 pared with autologous DR or SR, although the number of
procedures was smaller. Our finding of lower rates of wound
complications after DR compared with IR is important
because the women who had DR were more likely to have
characteristics associated with a higher risk for SSI than were
women who underwent IR (eg, tobacco use disorder, rural
residence).12 Thus, these women likely would have had even
higher wound complication rates if they underwent immedi-
ate rather than delayed reconstruction. Wound complica-
tions after implant IR were associated with high rates of
implant failure, and women who had wound complications
after implant IR were also more likely have additional
wound complications after secondary reconstructive proce-
dures. Women who had a wound complication after IR
underwent more subsequent breast procedures and had
delayed adjuvant treatment initiation compared with
women who did not have a wound complication after IR.
Consensus is lacking in the literature regarding differ-
ences in complication rates after IR vs DR for autologous tis-
sue flap and implant reconstructions. Several small studies15-18
have reported similar wound complication rates after autolo-
gous IR vs DR, whereas others19,20 have found higher compli-
cation rates after autologous IR. Sullivan and colleagues15 re-
portedahigherincidenceofoverallcomplicationsafterimplant
IR compared with DR procedures, whereas 2 other groups21,22
reported no difference, although these studies included only
a small number of implant DR procedures. Consistent with our
finding of increased incidence of wound complications after
implant IR vs implant SR, Lovecchio et al23 and Cordeiro and
McCarthy22 reported significantly higher complication rates
after implant IR compared with SR exchange procedures. In
contrast to studies that did not find a difference in complica-
tion rates, our study was larger and we compared wound com-
plication rates after implant IR vs SR within a woman using
matched-pairs analysis to account for lack of independence
of events.
Several investigators24-26 have used the National Surgi-
cal Quality Improvement Program database to analyze 30-
day complication rates after IR compared with DR. Gart and
colleagues24 reported a decreased risk for SSI and total com-
plications associated with immediate compared with de-
layed autologous reconstruction, although these findings var-
ied by tissue flap type. Chung et al25 found no difference in SSI
rates between IR and DR microvascular autologous tissue flap
procedures. More recently, Sanati-Mehrizy et al26 found an in-
creased risk for 30-day complications after autologous DR and
implant DR using tissue expanders compared with IR. In con-
trast to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
studies, we compared SSI and NIWC rates after IR, DR, and SR
procedures and identified complications within 90 days of op-
eration rather than 30 days, based on a previous finding27 that
only 50% of SSIs were identified within 30 days of mastec-
tomy with implant IR but almost 90% were identified within
90 days.
One possible explanation for increased complication rates
after implant IR is the substantial dead space and hypovascu-

 lar field in which the initial implant is placed, compared with
the surgical field at the time of delayed or second-stage im-
plant insertion.23 Another explanation for the higher compli-
cation rates is the longer operation times often required for IR
owing to the performance of 2 sequential procedures.
Women who developed an SSI after implant IR were more
likely to have another SSI and/or an NIWC after any SR proce-
dure. Similarly, NIWCs after implant IR were associated with
a higher incidence of NIWCs and SSI after SR. Adkinson and
colleagues28 reported higher rates of complications and per-
manent implant loss after implant SR in women who had a
complicationaftertissueexpanderinsertion,althoughtheydid
not report the secondary procedure complication risk accord-
ing to the specific type of wound complication after the ini-
tial surgery. Thus, wound complications after implant IR ap-
pear to result in a prolonged risk for complications after
subsequent procedures, possibly because of a poor soft-
tissue envelope or continued low-level infection. An addi-
tional explanation may be that women who had a complica-
tion after their initial procedure had an inherently higher risk
for complications and thus were more likely to have another
complication after SR.
We found that adjuvant radiotherapy was associated with
higher SSI and NIWC rates after implant SR. Several investi-
gators have reported higher rates of total complications with
second-stageimplants,23infectionandwoundbreakdown,29,30
and reconstruction failure29-34 in women who received adju-
vant radiotherapy after tissue expander or implant IR. In con-
trast, among women undergoing subsequent autologous re-
construction, we did not find increased rates of SSI or NIWCs
after adjuvant radiotherapy. This finding is consistent with re-
ports in the literature of the lack of association between ra-
diotherapy and outcomes of autologous reconstruction.19,35
Limitations
Claims data were designed for administrative purposes and
have limitations, including misclassification of diagnoses and
likely undercoding of SSIs and NIWCs, especially minor com-

was lower than for a composite NIWC group (dehiscence or fat

a Subsequent reconstruction or revision procedures included the first
secondary implant or autologous procedure; implant removal without
insertion, revision of reconstruction, mastopexy, capsulectomy, nipple
reconstruction, reduction mammoplasty, and any additional subsequent
autologous or implant procedures (ie, autologous and implant insertion codes

Of all procedures within 2 years after mastectomy and before any subsequent
mastectomy, 5851 (43.0%) were the first secondary implant or autologous
procedure. Overall, the most common follow-up procedure was implant
exchange or insertion (8212 [60.4%] of all procedures within 2 years),
followed by nipple reconstruction (with or without revision or mastopexy,
2565 [18.9%]), revision or mastopexy only (1063 [7.8%]), implant removal
only (806 [5.9%]), and autologous flap reconstruction without an implant
(230 [1.7%]).
bSSI and NIWC categories are not mutually exclusive; thus, the sum of the
number of women by complication category is greater than the number of
women with IR.
c Includes subsequent procedures up to 2 years after mastectomy and before
any subsequent mastectomy. Among women with IR, 8172 (81%) had at least
1 year of enrollment and 5683 (57%) had at least 2 years of health insurance
enrollment after mastectomy.

 eral side. Because the duration of continuous private insur-
ance enrollment was variable, we limited our study to subse-
quent breast reconstruction within 1 year and complications
within 90 days to limit loss to follow-up. Therefore, we are
missing later complications and subsequent procedures and
may be underestimating these rates. The incidence of com-
plications after procedures performed from 2004 to 2011 may
also underestimate the burden in the current era because of
increased use of skin- and nipple areola complex–sparing mas-
tectomy to optimize cosmesis,38 with a potentially increased
risk for complications.39
Conclusions
We found an increased incidence of infectious and noninfec-
tiouswoundcomplicationsafterimmediatecomparedwithde-
layed implant reconstruction, despite the higher risk profile of
thepopulationundergoingDR.Confirmationoftheseresultsin
a prospective multicenter study that tracks individual out-
comes in all settings will be important to verify the increased
riskforwoundcomplicationsafterIR.Ourfindingofpoorerout-
comes associated with IR complications, including increased
wound complication rates after the next reconstruction proce-
dure,moresubsequentbreastprocedures,anddelayofthestart
of adjuvant treatment, underscores the need to communicate
individualizedcomplicationrisktowomenconsideringIR.Con-
sideration of the timing of implant reconstruction in relation to
radiotherapy is also important. Our results suggest that some
high-risk patients may benefit from delayed rather than imme-
diate implant reconstruction or from the use of autologous re-
construction to decrease their risk for serious wound compli-
cations. Given trends of patients with increasingly medically
complex problems undergoing breast reconstruction, tailor-
ingofpreventivemeasurestopatients’uniqueriskfactorsand/or
careful consideration of the best timing of reconstruction may
be needed to prevent complications after immediate and sub-
sequent breast reconstruction procedures.
