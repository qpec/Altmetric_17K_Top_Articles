 Nephropharmacology

Pharmacology behind Common Drug Nephrotoxicities
Mark A. Perazella
Abstract
Patients are exposed to numerous prescribed and over-the-counter medications. Unfortunately, drugs remain
a relatively common cause of acute and chronic kidney injury. A combination of factors including the innate
nephrotoxicity of drugs, underlying patient characteristics that increase their risk for kidney injury, and the
metabolism and pathway of excretion by the kidneys of the various agents administered enhance risk for drug-
induced nephrotoxicity. This paper will review these clinically relevant aspects of drug-induced nephrotoxicity for
the clinical nephrologist.

Introduction
Medications are a relatively common cause of kid-
ney injury (1–12). The epidemiology of drug-induced
nephrotoxicity is currently based on literature focus-
ing on AKI. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity in adults is
approximately 14%–26% in prospective cohort studies
of AKI, whereas 16% of hospitalized AKI is due to drugs
in the pediatric population (1–4). Drug-induced neph-
rotoxicity is more common in hospitalized patients, in
particular intensive care unit patients (2,5).
Importantly, the general population is exposed to
a large number of prescribed and over-the-counter
drugs as well as a variety of substances available at
health food stores (natural products, supplements,
herbal remedies) (6–20). Various imaging agents used
for diagnostic purposes are also associated with neph-
rotoxicity (21–23). However, not all patients exposed
to the various potential nephrotoxins develop kidney
disease. Thus, the nephrotoxicity of medications, drugs,
and other ingested substances is a complicated process
that involves a combination of factors. These include the
inherent nephrotoxic potential of the drug, underlying
patient characteristics that enhance their risk for kidney
injury, and the metabolism and excretion of the poten-
tial offending agent by the kidney (6–9).
As part of the Clinical Journal of the American Society
of Nephrology series “Nephropharmacology for the
Clinician,” this review will cover some of the common
nephrotoxic drugs that the kidney is exposed to in clin-
ical practice, the factors that increase vulnerability of the
kidney to these potential toxins, provide insight into the
mechanisms by which kidney injury occurs, and cover
some of the associated clinical kidney syndromes that
develop in response to these agents (1–33).
Factors Associated with Drug-Induced
Nephrotoxicity
The development of drug-induced nephrotoxicity
can be best understood by examining the factors
that contribute to nephrotoxicity (1–9). Exposure to a
potentially nephrotoxic medication is an obvious re-
quirement. Drugs may be modestly nephrotoxic or
maintain high risk to cause kidney injury on the basis
of their structure, dose, metabolic handling, excretory
pathway through the kidney, and other characteris-
tics (5–9). Underlying patient characteristics, such as
comorbid conditions, genetic determinants of drug
metabolism and transport, and immune response genes,
are also important in drug nephrotoxicity (5–9). As the
kidney metabolizes and excretes (through filtration and
tubular secretion) many ingested drugs, the interaction
of these substances with various parts of the nephron
may be associated with nephrotoxicity (5–9). For kidney
injury to occur, some combination of these three risk
factors is generally present. More often than not, more
than one is present. It is the differences in structure of
the ingested drug, underlying patient characteristics,
and alterations in kidney handling of the ingested sub-
stance that likely explain the variability and heteroge-
neity observed with drug-induced nephrotoxicity.
The Drug
The initial step in the development of kidney in-
jury involves exposure to a potentially toxic offending
agent. The general population is exposed to a variety
of potential nephrotoxic substances including pre-
scribed therapeutic agents, over-the-counter products,
diagnostic agents, and environmental substances
(Table 1). Examples of potentially nephrotoxic drugs
that are utilized to treat various disease processes
include antimicrobial agents, anticancer drugs, anal-
gesics, and immunosuppressive agents (1–34). Fur-
thermore, a large number of new medications with
unknown nephrotoxic potential make it through clin-
ical trials and are subsequently released into clinical
practice where they cause kidney injury. This is likely
related to exposure of these new drugs in patients
who have comorbidities or other characteristics that
increase nephrotoxic risk that were not included in
clinical trials. Although clinicians prescribe the vast

 majority of potentially nephrotoxic medications, many are
also available as over-the-counter preparations. Radiocon-
trast agents, in particular those delivered intra-arterially at
high dose, are another potential cause of AKI (22,23).
In addition to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–
approved medications, unregulated sources of potentially
nephrotoxic substances are the alternative/complementary
products, which are widely available at most health food
stores (17–20). Included are items described as herbal rem-
edies, natural products, and nutritional supplements (16).
Another concern is that these products often contain a
number of harmful chemicals and/or contaminants that
are not listed on the label (16–20). Not uncommonly, the
substances listed on the package label are present in varying
amounts ranging from large, to small, to even nonexistent. In
addition to direct nephrotoxicity, herbal products may in-
teract with conventional drugs producing another potential
avenue of nephrotoxicity. Examples of such unlisted contents
include Ephedra species and aristolochic acid as well herbal
products adulterated with phenylbutazone and other non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cadmium, and
dichromate (16–20).
Drug Dose and Duration of Therapy
One of the most important parts of drug-induced
nephrotoxicity is the innate kidney toxicity of the offending
agent. A number of drug characteristics and their varied
mechanisms of action play a role in causing kidney injury
(Figure 1). High doses and prolonged courses of certain
nephrotoxins will enhance risk for kidney injury via exces-
sive exposure of the kidney, even in patients with minimal
or no underlying risk. Several drugs such as the amino-
glycosides, platinums, amphotericin B, and colistin fall into
this category (24–28).
Drug Characteristics (Solubility, Structure, and Charge)
Drugs and metabolites that are insoluble in the urine
may cause acute crystalline nephropathy by precipitating
in distal tubular lumens (11,29–31). This process is en-
hanced further by reduced urinary flow rates, urine pH
(depending on drug pKa), excessive drug dosing, and rapid

 infusion rates. In addition to obstructing urinary flow, pre-
cipitated crystals induce inflammation in the surrounding
interstitium. Medications associated with development of
crystalline nephropathy include methotrexate, acyclovir,
indinavir/atazanavir, sulfadiazine, vitamin C, foscarnet, oral
sodium-phosphate, and triamterene.
A number of medications used for intravascular volume
repletion (dextran, hydroxyethyl starch) or as carrier mol-
ecules (sucrose with intravenous immunoglobuling) are
associated with osmotic nephropathy (32,33). These drugs
accumulate within phagolysosomes of proximal tubular
cells. Because of their structure, these molecules cannot be
metabolized and ultimately cause lysosomal dysfunction
and cell swelling.
An interesting drug characteristic that enhances neph-
rotoxicity is the positive charge of polycationic amino-
glycosides, which are attracted to the negatively charged
proximal tubular membrane phospholipids (24,34). This
facilitates drug binding to the megalin/cubilin receptor
complex. For example, aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is in
part related to their cationic charge—neomycin has higher
cationic charge and is more nephrotoxic than amikacin, which
has a lower cationic charge.
Drug Combinations
Combinations of potential nephrotoxic drugs can increase
risk for kidney injury with examples including vancomycin1
piperacillin/tazobactam, aminoglycosides1cephalothin,
NSAIDs1radiocontrast, and cisplatin1aminoglycosides
(35–39). As will be reviewed, the pathway of excretion by the
kidney represents another risk for drug nephrotoxicity. Med-
ications compete with endogenously produced substances
(and other drugs) for transport proteins and influx/efflux
transporters, which can increase intracellular drug concen-
tration and risk for kidney injury (5–7). These drug-drug
interactions increase kidney injury and overall drug toxicity.
Innate Drug Nephrotoxicity. A number of medications
maintain higher potential for causing kidney injury on the
basis of their more significant innate nephrotoxicity. These
drugs, which include the aminoglycosides, amphotericin B,
the polymyxins, and cisplatin, may cause kidney injury with
therapeutic doses and brief durations of exposure (5–7,40–42).

methotrexate, acyclovir, and sulfadiazine) lead to kidney injury. In addition, increased drug concentrations within tubular cells are due to
transport effects (such as tenofovir and cisplatin), intracellular accumulation of certain drugs due to lack of metabolizing enzymes (such as
sucrose and hydroxyethyl starch), innate direct cell toxicity (such as aminoglycosides, colistin, and amphotericin B), and intratubular cast

 Accumulation of high concentrations of the polycationic
aminoglycosides within intracellular lysosomes causes
lysosomal injury, which is associated with phospholipid
membrane injury, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dys-
function. This promotes proximal tubular cell apoptosis and
necrosis with clinical manifestations such as an isolated
proximal tubulopathy or AKI (5–7,40–42).
Amphotericin B, and the lipid/liposomal formulations
to a lesser degree, cause kidney injury by disrupting tubular
cell membranes and increasing permeability to cations,
which result in tubular dysfunction due to cell swelling/
dysfunction (40). In general, the lipid/liposomal formula-
tions are less nephrotoxic. The polymixin antimicrobial
agents, colistin and polymyxin B, are highly nephrotoxic
with a very narrow therapeutic window. Nephrotoxicity
is related to their D-amino content and fatty acid compo-
nent, which increases cellular membrane permeability and
allows cation influx (41). This effect leads to tubular cell
swelling and lysis with AKI development.
The acyclic nucleotide phosphonates (adefovir, cidofovir,
tenofovir) enter the cell via basolateral human organic anion
transporter–1(hOAT-1) and promote cellular injury primarily
through disturbing mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial
injury is manifested by mitochondrial enlargement, clumped
cristae, and convoluted contours that impair cellular ener-
getics (8,10,26,43). Tenofovir, which is employed widely to
treat hepatitis B virus and HIV infection, is associated with
proximal tubulopathy and AKI (8,10,26,43).
Antiangiogenesis therapy with monoclonal antibodies
against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), circu-
lating soluble VEGF receptors, and small molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitors that impair intracellular VEGF signaling
pathways are associated with various forms of kidney
injury (11,44–47). In the kidney, VEGF is produced by
podocytes and binds glomerular and peritubular capillary
endothelial cell VEGF receptors. Glomerular endothelial
VEGF receptor binding maintains normal fenestrated
endothelial health and is important for normal functioning
of the glomerular basement membrane (11,44–47). Reduc-
tion in VEGF levels or signaling pathways by antiangio-
genic drugs promotes loss of the healthy fenestrated
endothelial phenotype and promotes microvascular injury
and thrombotic microangiopathy, causing proteinuria and
AKI. Reduced nephrin expression in the slit diaphragms
may also contribute to the development of proteinuria. Al-
though other kidney lesions occur with these drugs, endo-
thelial injury and thrombotic microangiopathy are most
common (11,44–47). By interfering with local alternative
complement pathway regulators, these drugs may also
activate complement and increase risk for TMA (48).
Drug-Induced Inflammation
Another pathway of drug-induced nephrotoxicity is
through induction of an inflammatory response by the
host, which can target the kidney (49–53). Through multiple
mechanisms (hapten/prohapten, molecular mimicry, immu-
ne-complex formation), medications can promote the devel-
opment of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) leading to AKI
and/or various urinary abnormalities such as tubular
proteinuria, pyuria, and hematuria (49–52). Classic drugs
associated with AIN include antimicrobial agents (in partic-
ular B-lactams and sulfonamides), NSAIDs, proton pump
inhibitors, and aminosalicylates (49–53). Newer agents such
as the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ipilimumab, nivolumab,
pembrolizumab) cause AIN via activation of T cells and
perhaps reducing tolerance to exogenous drugs (54–56). As
will be discussed, the patient’s genetic makeup may enhance
immunogenicity to exogenous agents.
Drug-Induced Cast Nephropathy
Another intriguing drug-related kidney injury is vancomycin-
related obstructive tubular cast formation. Using immuno-
histologic staining techniques to detect vancomycin in kidney
tissue, casts composed of noncrystal nanospheric vancomy-
cin aggregates entangled with uromodulin have been ob-
served in patients with AKI (57). In these patients, high
vancomycin trough plasma levels were observed. These
same vancomycin casts were reproduced experimentally in
mice using in vivo imaging techniques. Thus, the interaction
of uromodulin with nanospheric vancomycin aggregates re-
presents a new mode of tubular injury with development of
vancomycin-associated cast nephropathy (57).
The Patient
There are a number of patient-specific factors that in-
crease risk for medication-induced nephrotoxicity (Figure
2, Table 2). Underlying risk factors for nephrotoxicity may
be nonmodifiable, such as older age and female sex, which
are associated with decreased lean body mass and reduced
total body water that can lead to excess drug dosing (6–9).
A “normal serum creatinine” in these patients may actually
be a lower GFR. Women and the elderly have lower serum
albumin concentrations—hypoalbuminemia results in re-
duced drug binding and increased free drug concentrations
that can be nephrotoxic (6–9,35–38). In addition to these
factors, the elderly have an increased propensity to vaso-
constriction from excessive circulating angiotensin II and
endothelin levels and have higher levels of oxidatively
modified biomarkers (58). These factors combine to in-
crease patient exposure to excess drug concentrations and
nephrotoxicity risk.
Genetic Makeup
Along the lines of nonmodifiable risk factors is the patient’s
underlying genetic makeup. In fact, the role of pharmacogenetics
as an explanation for the heterogeneous patient response
to drugs (underdosing, therapeutic dosing, and overdosing)
reflects genetic makeup and supports the need for “person-
alized” or “precision” medicine. As such, underlying host
genetic makeup can enhance vulnerability of the kidney to
potential nephrotoxins (59–63). There are data that sug-
gest that metabolic pathways, transport proteins, and drug
transporters vary between patient populations due to the
effect of genetic composition. Several enzymes that com-
prise the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme
system have gene polymorphisms that are associated with
reduced drug metabolism and subsequent end organ toxicity.
Because the kidney also possesses CYP450 enzymes that
participate in drug metabolism (59–63), it is not surprising
that gene polymorphisms favoring reduced drug metabolism
could increase nephrotoxic risk.

the metabolism and subsequent elimination of drugs by the

 kidney as well as the repair pathways after drug injury are
correlated with various levels of drug sensitivity. Polymor-
phisms in genes encoding ERCC1, a key enzyme in the
DNA repair pathway by which cells repair platinum-induced
DNA damage, may be associated with increased nephro-
toxicity (64). Polymorphisms in cytosolic glutathione-S-
transferase enzymes, which normally function to detoxify
reactive molecules such as cisplatin, increase risk for
nephrotoxicity with exposure to this drug (65).
Loss-of-function mutations in apical secretory transporters
that reduce drug efflux from the cell into the urine, and
mutations in kinases that regulate drug carrier proteins, can
impair drug elimination and promote nephrotoxicity by
elevating intracellular drug concentrations (59–63). It is prob-
able that patients differ in the function and regulation of re-
ceptors, channels, carriers, and transporters that regulate the
metabolism and elimination of drugs by the kidneys. Tenofovir-
induced Fanconi syndrome represents one such example (66).
Patients with HIV receiving tenofovir who developed Fanconi
syndrome were noted to have a single nucleotide polymorphism:
1249 G→A single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene coding
the multidrug-resistant protein-2 efflux transporter, which
transports tenofovir out of the cell into the urine. In contrast,
treated patients with HIV who did not develop Fanconi
syndrome did not have the gene polymorphism (66).
Genetic alterations in a patient’s immune system may
also enhance risk for drug nephrotoxicity via inflammatory
injury. The administered drug or its metabolite may form
adducts that modify their physical structure, which en-
hances their immunogenicity (49,53). Heterogeneity in
patient response to drugs and exogenous agents exists, with
one example being the heightened allergic response of some
individuals as compared with others. As such, differences in
innate host immune response genes can predispose some
patients to developing an allergic reaction to a medication
(49,53). In fact, the variability of immune responses has
been demonstrated in patients who develop drug-induced
AIN, which appears to be a T cell–driven process (49).
Thus, enhanced vulnerability to an allergic response in the
kidney and the associated development of AIN reflect yet
another form of drug nephrotoxicity.
Comorbid Diseases
Underlying AKI and CKD are also important risk factors
for increasing vulnerability to nephrotoxic injury (6–9,
35–37). The decline in GFR and increase in tubular secretion
of endogenous substances (and medications) increase risk
for adverse drug-related kidney effects. GFR reduction
can also result in excessive drug dosing for medications
excreted by the kidneys, increased drug exposure in a
reduced number of functioning nephrons and ischemia
preconditioned tubular cells, and more robust oxidative
injury response to various medications by the kidney. In
addition, increased tubular secretion of drugs that are
cleared by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion
may enhance kidney tubular toxicity (6–9).
Figure 2. | Patient factors that increase risk for drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Patients have risk factors from nonmodifiable characteristics
such as age, sex, race, and the genetic makeup of immune response genes and drug metabolizing enzymes and transport pathways that
enhance the nephrotoxicity of drugs. Comorbid conditions such as liver disease, heart disease, and CKD and acutely developed diseases such
as intravascular volume depletion, metabolic perturbations, and AKI are also important risk factors for drug-induced nephrotoxicity.

Adverse Kidney Effects of Drugs, Perazella
1901
 Other types of systemic and kidney disease may also
increase the nephrotoxic effects of drugs. Nephrotic syn-
drome and cirrhosis enhance nephrotoxic risk through
multiple mechanisms that include altered kidney perfusion
from reduced effective circulating blood volume, hypoal-
buminemia with increased free circulating drug levels, and
unrecognized kidney impairment (6–9,35–38). Obstructive
jaundice also enhances toxicity to certain drugs, such as
the aminoglycosides, through altered hemodynamics such
as decreased renal blood flow and direct toxic effects of
bile salts on tubular epithelia (67). True volume depletion
from vomiting, diarrhea, and diuretics as well as effective
volume depletion associated with congestive heart failure,
ascites, and sepsis increase risk for drug nephrotoxicity.
Induction of kidney hypoperfusion and prerenal physi-
ology by these comorbidities increases the nephrotoxicity
of many drugs (6–9,35–38). Ultimately, reduced kidney
perfusion enhances nephrotoxicity in drugs excreted
through the kidneys by fostering drug overdosing, in-
creasing drug concentrations within tubular cells in drugs
reabsorbed by the proximal tubule, and enhancing drug/
metabolite crystal precipitation within distal tubular
lumens in the setting of sluggish urinary flow rates of
insoluble drugs (6–9,35–38).
Metabolic Disturbances
A number of metabolic abnormalities can also increase
risk for adverse kidney effects with certain drugs. For
example, electrolyte disorders such as hypokalemia, hypo-
magnesemia, and hypocalcemia increase the nephrotoxicity
associated with the aminoglycosides (6–9,35–38,68). Severe
hypercalcemia leads to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction
and tubular sodium and water wasting, which induces
prerenal physiology, which enhances nephrotoxic drug in-
jury. Metabolic disorders that alter urinary pH also increase
risk for intratubular crystal deposition with certain drugs (6–
9,29–31,68). Systemic metabolic acidosis or alkalosis may
decrease or increase urine pH, whereas proximal and distal
renal tubular acidoses are associated with alkaline urine due
to impaired ability of the kidney to excrete H1 ion. Acidic
urinary pH (,5.5) increases intratubular crystal deposition
with drugs such as sulfadiazine, methotrexate, and triamterene
that have limited solubility in a low-pH environment (11,25–
27). Alkaline urine (pH.6.0) increases crystal precipitation
within tubular lumens from drugs such as indinavir,
atazanavir, oral sodium phosphate solution, and ciproflox-
acin (10,11,21,29–31). In addition, drugs such as topiramate,
zonisamide, and acetazolamide induce the formation of an
alkaline urine by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase thereby
promoting precipitation of calcium-phosphate within tu-
bules and enhancing risk for nephrolithiasis (30,31).
The Kidney
The mechanism by which the kidney metabolizes and
excretes various drugs and toxins importantly contributes
to drug nephrotoxicity (Figure 3). The high rate of drug and
toxin delivery to the kidney, a result of high renal blood
flow, which approximates 25% of cardiac output, exposes
the kidney to significant drug concentrations (6–9). In ad-
dition, many tubular cells, particularly those in the loop of
Henle, reside in a relatively hypoxic environment due to
the high metabolic requirements associated with active
solute transport by Na1-K1-ATPase–driven transport
(6–9,68,69). Excessive cellular workload of these cells in
this relatively hypoxic environment enhances risk for a
nephrotoxic-related injury. High concentrations of certain
medications and their metabolites develop in the kidney
medulla and interstitium from the enormous concentrat-
ing ability of the kidney, which can induce kidney injury
through direct toxicity as well as ischemic damage from
reduced prostaglandin and increased thromboxane pro-
duction (6–9,68,69).
Drug Metabolism
In addition to hepatic metabolism, a number of drugs
undergo biotransformation by kidney enzyme systems, in-
cluding the CYP450 and flavin-containing monooxygenases

 (6–9,68–71). This leads to the potential formation of nephro-
toxic metabolites and reactive oxygen species as seen with the
aminoglycosides, platinums, and several other medications
(6–9,34,68–74). These byproducts of biotransformation may
swing the balance in favor of oxidative stress, which outstrips
natural antioxidants and increases kidney injury via DNA
strand breaks, nucleic acid alkylation or oxidation, lipid
peroxidation, and protein damage (6–9,34,68–74).
Drug Excretory Pathway
Drugs are excreted from the body by both glomerular
filtration and tubular secretion. An important avenue of
kidney injury occurs with excretion of drugs via the active
transporters in proximal tubular cells (6–9,75–79). Exten-
sive tubular cell uptake of potential nephrotoxic drugs via
both apical and basolateral transport systems underlies
development of kidney injury. From the urinary space,
apical uptake of drugs occurs via endocytosis/pinocytosis
and other active/passive transport pathways (6–9,32–34).
Medications taken up via this pathway include polycationic
aminoglycosides (Figure 4A), heavy metals, and various
complex sugars and starches. In the case of aminoglyco-
sides, after endocytic receptor (megalin/cubilin) binding
and uptake of these cationic ligands, these drugs are
translocated into the lysosomal compartment where they
accumulate and subsequently form myeloid bodies
(6,34,68,69). Myeloid bodies are membrane fragments
and damaged organelles formed as a consequence of
aminoglycoside inhibition of lysosomal enzymes. This api-
cal pathway of uptake leads to accumulation of a critical con-
centration of aminoglycoside within cells, which triggers
an injury cascade leading to cell injury and death, which
present clinically as a proximal tubulopathy and/or AKI.
Filtered dextran, sucrose, and hydroxyethyl starch may cause
tubular injury when they undergo pinocytosis by proximal
tubular cells (6,9,34,35). Similar to the aminoglycosides, after
pinocytosis these substances are taken up by and collect in
lysosomes (Figure 4B). The absence of cellular enzymes ca-
pable of metabolizing these substances allows them to build
up within the cytoplasm and cause tubular cell injury and
AKI (6,9,34,35).
In addition to apical uptake of drugs, another pathway of
proximal tubular cell drug exposure occurs via basolateral
delivery via the peritubular capillaries (6,26,43,72–76). After
delivery of potentially nephrotoxic drugs by the peritubular
capillaries, uptake into proximal tubular cells occurs via a
family of active transporters (6,26,43,72–76). These include
the hOAT for negatively charged drugs and the human
organic cation transporters (hOCT) for positively charged
drugs (6,26,43,72–76). Endogenously produced anionic
and cationic substances, as well as exogenously admin-
istered drugs, compete for transport via these pathways. Clas-
sic examples of potentially nephrotoxic drugs utilizing these
transport pathways are the acyclic nucleotide phosphonates
such as tenofovir (Figure 5A), which are transported via
hOAT-1 (6,26,43), and cisplatin, which is transported via
Figure 3. | Kidney factors that enhance risk for drug-induced nephrotoxicity. High RBF increases drug delivery and exposure to the kidney.
High metabolic rates of TALH tubular cells increase risk for drug nephrotoxicity. Kidney metabolism of drugs to toxic metabolites and ROS
overwhelms local antioxidants and promotes tubular injury. Increased concentrations of potentially nephrotoxic drugs in the medulla and
interstitium increase kidney injury. Apical uptake of certain drugs (aminoglycosides, hydroxyethyl starch) and basolateral transport of drugs
through the organic anion transporter (tenofovir) and organic cation transporter (cisplatin) increase kidney toxicity. PCT, proximal convoluted

 hOCT-2 (Figure 5B) (72–74,76). Upon transport of drugs
into proximal tubular cell cytoplasm, they move through
the intracellular space by various regulated carrier proteins,
and subsequently exit from cells via apical transport pro-
teins (5,6,26,43,72–74,76). Transport of drugs through
proximal tubular cells, as well as the buildup of drug con-
centrations when transport out of cells is blunted (or transport
into the cell is increased), enhances risk for nephrotoxicity
(6,9,26,43,72–74,76). Examples of the former are loss-of-
function mutations in and competition for apical secretory
transporters (6,9,26,43,66,72–74,76). This reduces nephrotoxin
efflux from cell into urine, which may promote accumulation
of toxic substances within proximal tubular cells and cause
cellular injury via apoptosis or necrosis (Figure 5). An example
of the latter is reduced glomerular filtration of drug, which
increases proximal tubular drug secretion and increases
tubular cell drug exposure (6–9). Ultimately, this extensive
trafficking of drugs increases tubular exposure and risk for
elevated concentration of potentially nephrotoxic drugs
when other risk factors supervene.

 physiologic structures and continuous flow conditions
(74,80,81). Most systems consist of kidney tubular epithe-
lial cells embedded on the surface of an extracellular ma-
trix, which is attached to perfusable microchannels that
allow for nutrient enrichment, waste clearance, and flow
(81). These in vitro models, in particular the 3D models, are
thought to more reliably replicate the in vivo environment
and predict nephrotoxicity that occurs with certain drugs
in the clinical setting (81). Proximal tubular cells cultured
under these physiologic conditions demonstrate various
markers of drug cytotoxicity. Kidney-on-a-chip models have
been successfully employed with known nephrotoxins such
as cisplatin (74).
Novel biomarkers of injury are also useful to examine
for the possibility of structural kidney injury due to vari-
ous drugs. To this point, the FDA and European Medicines
Agency (EMEA) approved seven novel kidney biomarkers,
along with traditional clinical chemistry and histopathol-
ogy, for preclinical animal studies to detect nephrotoxicity
in the development of new drugs (82). Biomarkers were

may lead to cellular injury. Tenofovir is delivered to the basolateral membrane, transported into the cell via the human organic anion transporter-1,
and excreted by various apical transporters into the urinary space. In this example, transport by the multidrug-resistance protein transporters is
inhibited or dysfunctional, causing intracellular accumulation of drug and nephrotoxicity via mitochondrial toxicity. (B) Cisplatin. Basolateral

 added to preclinical studies on the basis of their superior
sensitivity and specificity in detecting drug-induced neph-
rotoxicity as compared with traditional tests. Because these
biomarkers detect injury in various parts of the nephron,
they would be well suited not only to signal the occurrence
of parenchymal kidney injury, but also point to the site
of injury. Thus, animal experiments measuring these bio-
markers after administration of a medication under devel-
opment would provide insight into potential nephrotoxicity.
In addition to drug development, the FDA and EMEA rec-
ommend that biomarkers should eventually be evaluated
for their utility in clinical studies to promote patient safety
and guide therapeutic clinical decisions (83). Novel bio-
markers could also be measured in stored urine samples
from patients participating in clinical trials studying the
efficacy and safety of various drugs. The results of animal
and human studies would provide a potential avenue to
identify drug-induced structural kidney injury and allow
recognition of drug-induced nephrotoxicity at earlier time
points to allow drug discontinuation before further kidney
injury occurs. Kidney-on-a-chip technology in combination
with the urine microscopy (84) and novel biomarkers may
allow clinicians to better understand if a drug is nephrotoxic
and, if so, the site of injury and mechanism underlying de-
velopment of kidney injury.
Summary
Medications are widely prescribed and ingested by pa-
tients and remain a relatively common cause of kidney injury.
Drug nephrotoxicity is a complicated process that involves a
combination of factors including the innate nephrotoxicity of
drugs, underlying patient characteristics that enhance their
risk for kidney injury, and the metabolism and excretion of
the potential offending agent by the kidney.
