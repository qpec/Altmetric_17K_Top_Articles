Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an emerging risk for chronic behavioral, cognitive, and neuro-
degenerative conditions. Athletes absorb several hundred mTBIs each year; however, rodent models of
repeat mTBI (rmTBI) are often limited to impacts in the single digits. Herein, we describe the effects of
30 rmTBIs, examining structural and pathological changes in mice up to 365 days after injury. We found
that single mTBI causes a brief loss of consciousness and a transient reduction in dendritic spines,
reflecting a loss of excitatory synapses. Single mTBI does not cause axonal injury, neuroinflammation,
or cell death in the gray or white matter. Thirty rmTBIs with a 1-day interval between each mTBI do not
cause dendritic spine loss; however, when the interinjury interval is increased to 7 days, dendritic spine
loss is reinstated. Thirty rmTBIs cause white matter pathology characterized by positive silver and
Fluoro-Jade B staining, and microglial proliferation and activation. This pathology continues to develop
through 60 days, and is still apparent at 365 days, after injury. However, rmTBIs did not increase
b-amyloid levels or tau phosphorylation in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer disease. Our data
reveal that single mTBI causes a transient loss of synapses, but that rmTBIs habituate to repetitive
injury within a short time period. rmTBI causes the development of progressive white matter pathology
that continues for months after the final impact. (Am J Pathol 2016, 186: 552e567; http://dx.doi.org/

Athletes participating in contact sports are at high risk of
exposure to large numbers of concussive and subconcussive
mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs). Recent studies using
head impact telemetry systems have begun to reveal how
many head impacts an individual football player can receive
in the process of playing his or her sport. In a study of
high school football players, the number of helmet impacts
>20 g recorded in a single season ranged from a low of 226
(average, 4.7 per session) to a high of 1855 (average, 38.6
per session).1 Most of these impacts do not result in the
clinical diagnosis of a concussion; however, it is not known
if the cumulative effects of these impacts can result in
increased damage to the brain.
mTBI has been extensively modeled in mice and rats.2
Most of these rodent models use fewer than five mTBIs,

 events prevent the scaling up of these animal models to
reproduce the highly repetitive mTBI seen in impact
sports. It is also unlikely that the severity of injury occurs
with sports mTBI on a regular basis.
Repeat mTBI (rmTBI) is a risk factor for the develop-
ment of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a
chronic neurodegenerative disease most often reported in
boxers and football players.9,10 This disease is associated
primarily with the buildup of neurofibrillary tangles of
hyperphosphorylated tau throughout the brain; however,
52% of cases also present with diffuse amyloid-b (Ab)
deposits.11 There has been difficulty reproducing tau
pathology in rodents after rmTBI, and to date the only
study that has seen a chronic (21 days after TBI) increase
in hyperphosphorylated tau after rmTBI has required the
use of aged tau transgenic mice to observe an effect.12
In this study, we examine changes to the neuronal
structure and brain pathology after a single mTBI or
rmTBI. We are especially interested in changes that can
occur after mTBI that may explain the changes in brain
function after concussion. Herein, we characterize a new
model of mTBI, determining the effects of a single
mTBI, and up to 30 � rmTBI, in C57Bl/6 mice. We
establish the effect of a 60- and 365-day period of
convalescence on pathology, and the effect of increasing
the interinjury interval from 1 to 7 days. Because the
cumulative effects of rmTBI may cause the development
of CTE in humans, and a recent study showed that 52%
of CTE brains have both amyloid and tau pathology,11
we also explore the effects of rmTBI on concurrent
amyloid and tau pathology in a mouse model of Alz-
heimer disease (3�Tg-AD) that develops both types of
pathology.
Materials and Methods
This study was performed in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals13 of the NIH. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Georgetown University (Washington, DC).
mTBI Procedure
The device used for these experiments has been previously
published as a diffuse TBI model for rats,14,15 with modi-
fications for use in mice (Figure 1A). A Teflon impactor tip,
10 mm in diameter, was driven by a high-velocity pneu-
matic impactor that was targeted to contact directly onto the
top of the mouse head. The mouse head was supported by a
molded, gel-filled base (HandStands, Salt Lake City, UT),
which also acts to decelerate the head after impact
(Figure 1B). The middle diameter of the gel mold is 170
mm, and its compressibility is approximately 64 kPa/mm.
Speed, head deflection depth, and surface dwell time can all
be individually adjusted, and each impact is monitored with
a PowerLab System (Stoelting, Wood Dakem, IL) for con-
sistency and reproducibility. The device has a piston with a
stroke length of 101 mm and a bore diameter of 27.025 mm,
and for these experiments, we used 861.85 kPa of pressure,
resulting in a force output stroke of 494 N. With a 10-mm
diameter Teflon tip at the end of the impactor, the impact
energy delivered to the mouse head was 6.3 N/mm2. The
impactor tip had an end velocity of 2.35 m/second, and the
dwell time was 31.5 milliseconds (Figure 1, C and D).
Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in oxygen for
120 seconds in an induction chamber, and then transferred to

 the injury device, where they continued breathing anesthetic
through a pliable, nonfixed nose cone. There was no skin
deflection or surgery of any kind. The mouse head was
positioned on the gel pad so that the flat surface of the skull
was presented perpendicular to the impactor tip and the ears
were held away from the impact site with tape. The impactor
tip was lowered to the surface of the mouse head, retracted,
and manually dialed down to the required deflection depth.
After impact, the mice were removed from isoflurane and
placed on their backs. The latency to return of righting reflex
was determined and used as the primary measure of injury
severity. For pathology and behavioral studies in C57Bl/6
mice, the animals were impacted once a day, 5 days a week,
for 30 impacts. Mice were euthanized at 1, 30, 60, or 365 days
after the final impact. To determine the effects of an extended
interinjury interval on C57Bl/6 mice, animals received one
impact per week for 30 weeks. Sham mice received similar
handling and anesthesia, but received no impact.
Mice
C57Bl/6J male mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor,
MA) were used for all experiments, except the amyloid/tau
analysis, which used 3xTg-AD mice. C57Bl/6 mice were
aged from 3 to 5 months at the time of injury onset, except
for a 12-month-old cohort that was used to determine the
interaction of age and mTBI on dendritic spines.
The 18-month-old male 3xTg-AD mice,16 expressing
human amyloid precursor protein (APP; K670M/N671L),
human tau (P301L), and PS-1 (M146V) (knock-in) mutant
genes, were used from the colony previously characterized at
Georgetown University.17These mice were agedto 18months,
because that is the age that amyloid plaque deposition and tau
pathology begin to appear in this colony. Mice were housed at
the Georgetown University animal facility in a temperature-
controlled room at 22�C and were kept on a 12-hour light/12-
hour dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum.
Golgi Staining
For detailed characterization of neuronal processes and
spines, we performed Golgi staining using the FD Rapid
Golgi Stain Kit (FD NeuroTechnologies, Ellicott City, MD),
as previously reported.18 Bright-field microscopy images of
pyramidal neurons in layers II/III of the cortex were
captured, and the number of dendritic spines on basal shaft
(BS) and apical oblique (AO) dendrites was quantified. BS
dendrites project directly off the cell soma, and our counts
incorporated dendritic spines along a 20-mm section of the
shaft between 30 and 100 mm away from the soma. AO
dendrites project off the apical dendrite, and our counts only
incorporated primary AO dendrites. We counted spines in a
20-mm section of the primary AO. Different neurons were
used to quantify AO and BS segments of healthy pyramidal
neurons of cortical layers II/III. Slides and resultant images
were coded, and dendritic spines were counted in a blinded
manner (C.N.W., A.Ne., D.B., D.C., T.E.W., A.D.A.) using
ImageJ software version 1.46a (NIH, Bethesda, MD; http://
imagej.nih.gov/ij). The group mouse and neuron numbers
for each experiment are noted in the figure legends.
For Sholl analysis, images of Golgi-stained pyramidal
neurons were overlaid with concentric circles, consisting of
a 10-mm radius between each circle. The concentric circles
spanned from 0 to 70 mm, with a radial interval of 10 mm
between each circle. The center point of the circles was
superimposed over the cell body of previously acquired
Golgi-stained neurons, and the number of AO and BS
dendrites crossing each circle was manually counted and
plotted as number of crossings against distance from soma.
Immunohistochemistry and Staining
Mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and brains were drop fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight before cryoprotection in
30% sucrose for 48 hours. Brains were cut into sections
(40 mm thick) using a microtome and were stored free floating
in cryoprotectant solution. Before immunostaining, sections
were incubated in 0.3% H2O2 and blocked with 3% normal
goat serum in PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100, and incubated in
PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 and 1% normal goat serum
with primary antibody. The following primary antibodies used
included rabbit polyclonal antieIba-1 (1:5000; Wako Chem-
icals, Richmond, VA; catalog number 019-19741), mouse
monoclonal anti-CD68 (1:200; Serotec, Raleigh, NC; catalog
number MCA1957T), rabbit polyclonal anti-APP (1:1000;
Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA; catalognumber 36-6900), and rabbit
polyclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (1:500; Dako,
Carpinteria, CA; catalog number Z-0334). After washes in PBS,
sections were incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or anti-
mouse secondary antibodies (1:2000; Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA; catalog number BA-100) in PBS with 0.25%
Triton X-100, followed by the Vectastain avidin/biotinylated
enzyme complex kit (1:400; Vector Laboratories; catalog
number PK-6100) and 3,30-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) substrate to visualize primary antibodies.
For FluoroeJade B, floating sections were hydrated in
distilled water and incubated in a solution of 0.06% potassium
permanganate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes. After washing,
the sections were incubated in a 0.0004% solution of
FluoroeJade B for 20 minutes. Brain sections were rinsed in
distilled water, dried, and cleared in xylene before mounting
with Fluoro-Gel with Tris Buffer (Electron Microscopy Sci-
ences, Hatfield, PA). For silver staining, coronal sections were
washedindistilledwater andstainedusingamodifiedprocedure
of DeOlmos-Ingram cupric silver technique, as previously
reported.19
Quantitative and Densitometry Analysis
Histological sections were assessed for staining in the regions
covering the entire optic tract (�2.18 to �2.70 mm Bregma).

 Every fourth coronal section of the optic tract was selected,
yielding at least four sections collected per animal. From each
section, three distinct fields within the optic tract were
randomly selected and four images of sequential optical z
sections were obtained from each field. Images from each
field were combined into a single overlay image, and
Iba-1epositive cells were counted using the overlay. Helicon
Focus software version 3.2 (HeliconSoft, Kharkov, Ukraine)
was used for three-dimensional reconstruction of z section
thickness. The total number of Iba-1epositive cells was
expressed per mm2. Bushy microglial cells were identified by
short thick processes, few branches, and larger cell body
volume.20 For phenotypic analysis of the microglia popula-
tion, the expression level of microglial cells containing this
bushy phenotype was quantified as the percentage of total
number of Iba-1epositive cells.
For densitometry analysis, a total of three sections per
brain of silver-stained images were captured using a 20�
objective. These images were converted to grayscale with
background subtraction, and the mean gray levels were
measured with ImageJ software. Images were taken on an
Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America, Center
Valley, PA), using Olympus CellSens software version 1.5.
Only general adjustments of contrast and brightness were
made using Adobe Photoshop CS5 for Macintosh (Adobe
Systems, San Jose, CA). The images were not otherwise
manipulated.
Western Blot Analysis and Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay
To avoid transient artifactual changes in tau phosphoryla-
tion, 3xTg-AD mice were sacrificed by decapitation without
anesthesia,21 and the brain was rapidly dissected on ice.
Samples were snap frozen and stored at �80�C. Frozen
tissues were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25%
C24H39NaO4, 1 mmol/L NaVO3, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg/mL protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)] and centrifuged at

for
45
minutes
at
4�C.
The
radio-
immunoprecipitation assayeinsoluble pellet from cortical
homogenates was resuspended in one volume of 70% for-
mic acid, sonicated, and centrifuged at 23,500 � g for 15
minutes at 4�C. The supernatant was collected (formic acid
fraction containing insoluble proteins) and neutralized in 20
volumes of neutralization buffer containing 1 mol/L of Tris
base and 0.5 mol/L of Na2PO4. The resulting supernatants
were collected and analyzed for protein content using bicin-
choninic acid assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.,
Logan, UT). Samples were stored at �80�C until processing.
For Western blot analysis, samples were prepared as pre-
viously described.22 Proteins (5 to 10 mg) were separated on
SDS-PAGE gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and
blocked 1 hour at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk
in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were probed
with primary antibodies (listed below) diluted in SuperBlock
blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL),
washed, and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with the
corresponding
horseradish
peroxidaseelinked
secondary
antibody. For tau analysis, a secondary antibody directed
against light chain of immunoglobulins was used to detect
monoclonal primary antibodies to avoid non-specific signals
coming from the heavy chains of Igs.22 Membranes were
revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; GE
Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) in a Fujifilm
LAS4000 imaging system (Fujifilm USA, Valhalla, NY).

Human Ab40 was quantified by enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as previously
described.23 This kit uses a neo-epitopeespecific antibody
to specifically detect human Ab40.
Behavioral Analysis
Behavioral analysis was performed to test motor ability,
anxiety, and cognitive function.
Rotarod Test
The rotarod test is a test of motor function and consists of a
mouse walking on a rotating beam, which accelerates from 4
to 40 rpm over 300 seconds. Mice were exposed to the
rotarod test for two trials on the day before the first injury,
and then their postinjury performance was tested 1 and 365
days after injury. Two trials were performed on each test
day, and the average time to fall from the rotating beam was
measured in seconds.
Morris Water Maze
Spatial learning and memory deficits were evaluated starting
7 and 365 days after injury, using the Morris water maze
paradigm, as described previously.24 Briefly, the water maze
apparatus consisted of a 4-foot diameter pool (San Diego
Instruments, San Diego, CA) filled with water maintained at
Synaptic/White Matter Changes after rmTBI

 20�C and made opaque using white paint. Extramaze visual
cues were hung on the walls surrounding the pool, and a
hidden platform (4 inches in diameter) was submerged 1 cm
below the surface of the water. Initial training was started
1 week and 1 year after injury and consisted of four trials per
day. Mice were introduced into the pool using one of four
entry points, with each entry point used during the course of
the day. The location of the platform remained constant
throughout the entire training period. Mice were given 90
seconds to locate the platform and remained on the platform
for 10 seconds before being removed. Mice that did not
locate the platform within 90 seconds were placed onto the
platform for 10 seconds before removal from the maze.
Tracking software (Anymaze version 4.50; San Diego In-
struments) was used to record latency to find the platform,
swim speed, and swim path. On the fifth day of testing, a
probe trial was conducted in which the platform was removed
and the time spent in each quadrant was recorded over one
90-second trial.
Elevated Plus Maze
The elevated plus maze was used to assay anxiety-like
behavior 21 days after injury, as previously described,24
with
modifications.
The
apparatus
(San
Diego
In-
struments)
consists
of
a
26-inch
long
cross-shaped
platform made of nonporous white plastic and elevated
15 inches above the ground. One set of arms is enclosed
with walls (closed arms), and one set is exposed (open
arms). A spotlight was positioned overhead to provide
750-lux illumination over the center of the maze and the
exposed open arms. Mice were placed at the center
junction of the maze, facing an open arm, and given 5
minutes to explore. The number of entries into each arm,
the time spent in each arm, and the total distance trav-
eled in the maze (and in each individual arm) were
tracked using the video camera positioned over the maze
and analyzed using Anymaze software. The software
tracked the center point of the mouse body, and mice
were considered to have entered an arm when their
center point crossed into the arm.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance,
followed by post hoc analysis with Bonferroni multiple
comparisons test, and presented as the means � SEM. All
statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism
software, version 5.0d (GraphPad Software, Inc., San
Diego, CA), and P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Increasing the Depth of Head Deflection Results in
Graded LOC
Although loss of consciousness (LOC) is not a necessary
component of mTBI in humans, the presence or absence of
LOC is a useful tool in grading concussion severity in an-
imal models. The return of the righting reflex time is an
acute neurological evaluation of injury severity that we used
to quantify the LOC after a single mTBI. For this procedure,
all mice received a total of 180 seconds of 3% isoflurane in
oxygen. Because of this, all mice, including shams, had a
period of LOC after withdrawal of anesthesia. We found
that sham mice had an average LOC of 29.9 seconds.
Inducing mTBI with a head deflection setting of 5 mm did
not result in any change to the LOC time (31.0 seconds).
When the head deflection setting was increased to 7.5 mm,
the LOC increased to 53.4 seconds (P < 0.001 versus sham
and 5 mm) (Figure 2A). We also piloted a 10-mm head
deflection, and the LOC was significantly increased to 330.4
seconds in a few animals. This was associated with an in-
crease in what we considered to be adverse events,
including prolonged apnea and LOC, and a single case of
skull fracture. The results of our injury severity experiment

 showed that the 7.5-mm head deflection setting provided us
with the lowest identifiable and quantifiable LOC in the
absence of any discernable injury to the mice. Because the
overall goal of this study was to develop and characterize
this device as a preclinical model of repetitive injury, we
selected the 7.5-mm head deflection setting for all subse-
quent experiments.
The Duration of LOC Remains Static after rmTBI
The effect of rmTBI on the duration of LOC is difficult to
determine in humans, because factors such as impact force
and impact location vary from one impact to the next. In our
model, we were able to deliver an almost identical mTBI on
a daily basis, and as a result, we wanted to quantify LOC
duration after rmTBI. In the anesthesia alone sham group,
we found that the day-to-day LOC could fluctuate from a
high of 62.7 � 12.5 seconds on day 26 to a low of 25 � 2.3
seconds on day 22. To account for these fluctuations in
LOC, we averaged the readings from each 5-day week so
that we could better assess the effect of rmTBI on LOC
(Figure 2B). A repeated-measures 2-way analysis of vari-
ance revealed a significant effect of injury (F1,16 Z 29.47,
P < 0.0001), but no effect of time. There was a significant
interaction
between
time
and
injury
(F5,80
Z
3.38,
P < 0.01). Post hoc analysis revealed that rmTBI mice had
significantly elevated LOC at weeks 1 through 5 (P < 0.05)
(Figure 2B), but not week 6. During the entire study, the
average LOC for sham mice was 44.0 � 1.8 seconds; and
for rmTBI mice, 78.6 � 6.1 seconds (P < 0.0001)
(Figure 2C).
Neuronal Architecture Changes after mTBI
After a single 7.5-mm mTBI, mice were sacrificed at
various time points up to 3 days after injury, and we
visualized individual neurons using Golgi staining. We
found no evidence of unhealthy neurons after a single
mTBI that would have been indicated by Golgi-positive
cells displaying dendritic dystrophy, dendritic blebbing, or
atrophic cell bodies. Our blinded spine analysis (C.N.W.,
A.Ne., D.B., D.C., T.E.W., A.D.A) found that mTBI
caused a 13% decrease in the number of AO dendritic
spines at 1 day (P < 0.01 versus sham). This was followed
by a 25% increase in spine number by 3 days after injury,
resulting in a 12% increase in spines compared with sham
mice (P < 0.05 versus sham) (Figure 3A). BS dendritic
spines were not significantly affected by mTBI (data not
shown). Dendritic complexity was also unaffected, with
Sholl analysis revealing no differences in neuronal arbor-
ization between sham and mTBI mice at 1 day after injury
(Figure 3B).
We repeated our study using 12-month-old C57Bl/6
mice. We found that a single (7.5-mm) mTBI resulted in a
29% reduction in AO dendritic spines at 1 day after injury
(P < 0.001) (Figure 3C). There was a 13% reduction in BS
dendritic spines of aged mTBI mice, but this failed to reach
significance (P Z 0.06) (Figure 3C).

mTBI (rmTBI) mice is prevented by extending the interinjury interval. A: A single 7.5-mm mTBI causes a time-dependent, and transient, loss of apical oblique
(AO) dendritic spines in the superficial layers of the parietal cortex. Results represent an average of 32 to 76 neurons per time point from three to six mice per
group. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc test was used. B: mTBI has no impact on dendritic arborization at 24 hours after mTBI. C: The
loss of AO spines is more pronounced in 12-month-old C57Bl/6 mice at 24 hours after injury. D: There is no effect of 30 rmTBI (over 6 weeks) on dendritic spine
numbers in layer II/III of the cortex at 1, 60, or 365 days after injury. E: Mice were exposed to either anesthesia once a week for 30 weeks (sham), anesthesia
for 29 weeks, followed by a single mTBI (1 � mTBI), or mTBI once a week for 30 weeks (30 rmTBIs over 30 weeks). Both single mTBI and 30 mTBIs over 30
weeks result in a significant loss of AO dendritic spines 24 hours after the final injury. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001. n Z 16 to 26 neurons from

Synaptic/White Matter Changes after rmTBI

 To determine the effect of rmTBI, we exposed mice to 30
rmTBIs administered one per day, 5 days a week, for 6
weeks. Mice were euthanized 1, 60, or 365 days after injury
with time-matched sham controls. We found no difference
in dendritic spine numbers at any of the three time points
(Figure 3D).
To assess if the lack of effect of rmTBI on dendritic
spines is because of habituation, we extended the interinjury
interval from 1 to 7 days. Mice received 30 mTBIs, one per
week, for 30 weeks. As a positive control, we also exposed
a cohort of mice to weekly anesthesia for 29 weeks with a
single mTBI at week 30. Mice were euthanized 1 day after
the final mTBI. We found that the reduction in synapses
returned to 30 � rmTBI mice when there was a 7-day
interinjury period between impacts. Mice with a single
mTBI had an 11% reduction in AO dendritic spines
(P < 0.01 versus sham), and mice with 30 � rmTBI over 30
weeks had a 14% reduction in AO dendritic spines
(P < 0.001 versus sham) (Figure 3E).
The Acute Effect of Single mTBI and rmTBI on Neuronal
Cell Death and Axonal Injury
To determine whether the 30 mTBIs (over 6 weeks) model
causes axonal injury, we stained sections with the bAPP and
silver stain. We did find evidence of axonal distress in
discrete white matter tracts after 30 � rmTBI (Figure 4).
Strong positive silver staining (Figure 4, AeC) and
FluoroeJade Bepositive staining (Figure 4, GeI) were
observed in the optic tract of rmTBI mice 1 day after the
final injury, suggesting that the supporting cells of the optic
tract were degenerating as a result of rmTBI. No APP
staining was observed in the optic tract (Figure 4, DeF).
Although we saw occasional silver staining in the white
matter tracts of the cerebellum of rmTBI mice, no other
evidence of damaged white matter tracts, including the
corpus callosum, internal capsule, or hippocampal fimbria,
was observed. In addition, no evidence of cell death or
axonal injury in the gray matter of the rmTBI brain,
including the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, or cerebellum
(data not shown), was observed.
The Acute Effect of Single mTBI and rmTBI on Brain
Inflammation
To detect changes in glial populations after single mTBI and
rmTBI, we used glial fibrillary acidic protein as a marker of
astrocytes, and Iba-1 and CD68 to probe for microglia/
macrophages. Once again, we found no detectable effect of a
single mTBI on inflammatory markers 1 day after injury
(Figure 5). However, we found increased immunoreactivity
for both astrocytes and microglia in the optic tract after
30 � rmTBI (over 6 weeks) (Figure 5). Iba-1e and
CD-68epositive microglia were found extensively throughout
the optic tract (Figure 5), with infiltration into the lateral
geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (Figure 5).
rmTBI Causes Chronic White Matter Pathology
To study the effects of rmTBI on chronic pathology, mice
were euthanized at 1, 60, and 365 days after final injury. We
found a 21-fold increase in silver staining of the optic tract 1
day after the final injury compared to sham (P < 0.001)
(Figure 6, AeF). At 60 days after injury, there was still a
fourfold increase in silver staining in the optic tract, but this
was significantly less than at 1 day after injury (P < 0.001)

 (Figure 6, AeF). At 365 days after injury, there was little
silver staining remaining (Figure 6, DeF).
We also quantified the number of Iba-1epositive cells, and
the number of Iba-1epositive microglia with an enlarged,
bushy phenotype (Figure 6, GeL). Quantification of the
Iba-1epositive cells in the optic tract revealed a 206% increase
in microglia 1 day after 30 � rmTBI (over 6 weeks)
(P < 0.001) (Figure 6, GeL), which continued to increase to
249% above sham levels at 60 days after injury (P < 0.001)
(Figure 6, GeL). There were 49% more Iba-1epositive cells
in 30 � rmTBI 60 days after injury compared with 1 day after
injury (P < 0.001) (Figure 6, GeL). The morphology of these
cells also continued to develop because 60-day postinjury
mice had 78% more microglia with a bushy phenotype
compared with mice 1 day after injury (P < 0.001) (Figure 6,
GeL). There were still significantly more Iba-1epositive
microglia in the optic tract compared with sham mice 365 days
after rmTBI (P < 0.01) (Figure 6, GeL); however, there were
only a few bushy microglia remaining at this time point
(Figure 6, GeL).
The Effect of rmTBI on Behavior
We tested acute and chronic behavioral changes in mice
after 30 � rmTBI (over 6 weeks). For motor function, we
used the accelerating rotarod test and found that rmTBI mice
were not impaired at 1 day after final injury. However, at
365 days after injury, the same mice showed a 20.9%
reduction in the latency to fall from the rotarod (P < 0.05)
(Figure 7A).
For learning and memory testing, we performed the
Morris water maze. We found that rmTBI mice had no
cognitive deficits at 7 or 365 days after injury in either the
acquisition phase of the test (Figure 7, B and C) or the
retention phase of the test (Figure 7, D and E). Both rmTBI
and sham mice were able to find a visible platform with
similar latencies, and we observed no difference in veloc-
ities between groups in the water maze.
For anxiety testing, we used the elevated plus maze. We
found that rmTBI mice had no phenotypic changes at 6
months after injury, but we did observe a 46% decrease in
the time spent in the open arm of the maze in the 30 �
rmTBI mice at 365 days after injury (P < 0.05), reflecting
an increased anxiety phenotype in the repeat injury group
many months after the final mTBI (Figure 7F).
The Effect of rmTBI on Amyloid and Tau Pathology
Because rmTBI has been implicated in the development
of AD and CTE, we wanted to examine the effects of
rmTBI on amyloid and tau pathology. We used 18-month-
old 3xTg-AD mice for these studies, and because of their
advanced age, we limited them to 20 rmTBIs. We
euthanized one cohort of sham and rmTBI mice 24 hours
after the final injury and a second cohort 1 month after
injury.

 First, we determined if rmTBI altered tau phosphorylation
in 3xTg-AD mice. For this purpose, tau phosphorylation
was analyzed by Western blot analysis using a panel of
specific antitau antibodies that we have previously charac-
terized.22 We found no changes in tau phosphorylation state
in multiple brain regions, including the cortex (Figure 8),
hippocampus, and midbrain (Figure 9).
We also examined radioimmunoprecipitation assay
soluble and insoluble pools of Ab40 by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. We found that rmTBI had no ef-
fect on Ab at either time point after injury (Figure 9).
Discussion
Our aim was to determine the acute effects of a single
mTBI, and the chronic effects of rmTBIs on neuronal ar-
chitecture and the development of brain pathology in mice.
We have developed a new model of rmTBI that allows for
up to 30 mTBIs without the need for head restraint or sur-
gery. Our model allowed for a highly regulated, reproduc-
ible head impact to be delivered directly to the mouse head.
LOC is not a necessary component of mTBI in humans;
however, its presence in animal models can be useful for
grading injury severity, and we optimized our model to
select the lowest head deflection depth that caused a minor,
but statistically significant, LOC. This gave us a quantifiable
outcome measure to indicate that an mTBI had occurred, but
with a low enough deflection depth to prevent major
structural damage from occurring. This allowed us to scale
our model to 30 mTBIs, and will allow us to scale up to
more human appropriate numbers for future studies. We
were able to increase the duration of LOC by increasing the
head deflection depth, suggesting that the period of LOC is
directly related to the force delivered and rotation of the
head after impact. Our model also allows us to ask clinically
relevant questions, such as the effect of rmTBI on LOC over
time. In a study of sports athletes, it was found that players
with a history of three or more concussions were three times
more likely to have an incident concussion than those with
no concussion history.25 In our model, we can determine
whether the threshold for LOC is reduced by exposure to
earlier mTBI.
The Duration of LOC Remains Constant after rmTBI
Our experiments demonstrate that 6 weeks of rmTBI do not
alter the period of LOC, with all mice remaining unconscious
for similar periods of time from week 1 to week 6. Recently,
it was reported that mice exposed to seven rmTBIs have
reduced LOC with increased impact number.26 The authors
of that study report a significant LOC on days 1 and 2, but
not on days 3 to 7; however, an examination of the published
data shows that the reduction in the difference in LOC be-
tween sham and rmTBI mice is because of a combination of
an increase in LOC in the sham mice and a reduction in LOC
of the rmTBI mice.26 Indeed, in our study, we find that on
certain days, there is not a significant LOC in rmTBI mice, so
to smooth out daily variability, we assessed our LOC data by
weekly averages. We find that the period of LOC in the
rmTBI mice remained consistent for the 6-week duration of
Figure 7
Discrete behavioral changes continue in repeat mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) mice up to 365 days after injury. A: The 30 rmTBI (over 6

 the study. We also find that the period of LOC in the sham
mice increased by almost 50% over the same 6-week period.
We interpret this as an effect of repeat isoflurane anesthesia,
more than an effect of repetitive exposure to mTBI. It is also
possible that as the isoflurane alone is producing a deeper and
longer LOC at week 6 versus week 1, it may be masking a
habituating effect of rmTBI on LOC. Indeed, if we subtract
the LOC because of anesthesia from the combined LOC, we
see that the effect of mTBI decreases from 38 seconds in
week 1 to 18 seconds in week 6. The issue of anesthesia and
its interaction with mTBI-induced LOC will require future
studies, but the introduction of rodent rmTBI models with no
anesthesia will help to address these long-standing issues.27 It
is clear that exposure to previous mTBI does not increase
LOC time in later mTBI exposures, and because our model is
sensitive to increased impact strength, we conclude that the
increased risk of developing incident concussions after prior
mTBI25 does not appear to be because of a lowering of
threshold by prior mTBI.
Rapid but Temporary Synaptic Loss Occurs after a
Single mTBI
We also report that a single mTBI in mice caused an acute
reduction of excitatory synapses, as indicated by a reduction
in the number of dendritic spines in multiple regions of the
injured brain. We have recently demonstrated that a global
decrease in dendritic spine number occurs in mice after a
controlled cortical impact injury,18 with a 27% loss of
dendritic spines occurring in layer II/III of the ipsilateral
cortex, and spine loss in sites far distant from the impact
zone, such as the contralateral entorhinal cortex.18 Dendritic

 spine loss also occurs after rat lateral fluid percussion injury
(FPI),28 where in the absence of a lesion there is a 21% loss
in total spines on the AO dendrites of layer II/III cortical
neurons 24 hours after injury.28 In vitro stretch injury of
neurons also causes a prolonged loss of excitatory synaptic
transmission.29 In the present study, we focused our spine
counts on layers II/III of the cortex and report that a single
mTBI causes a 13% loss of spines in the AO dendrites in
young male mice, with a greater spine loss occurring after
mTBI on the same dendrites in aged male mice. Combined
together, these studies of dendritic spines after TBI show
that this is a common phenomenon that occurs in a severe
TBI model (controlled cortical impact),18,30 a moderate TBI
model (FPI),28 and our mild TBI model. Thus, our work and
that of others demonstrate that the loss of dendritic spines is
an event that occurs after all severities of TBI and may be
one of the common acute events that occur after head
trauma, even in the absence of neuronal cell death, axonal
injury, or inflammation. The reduction in dendritic spines is
a dynamic event after mTBI. Other groups have previously
shown that dendritic spines rebound and are increased by 7
days after a midline FPI,28 and herein we observe that spine
loss is a temporary and spontaneously recoverable phe-
nomenon in our mTBI model with a significant increase in
spine numbers at 3 days after injury.
Given that dendritic spine loss occurs after all severities
of TBI, we predicted that spine loss would also be a feature
of rmTBI. However, when 30 rmTBIs were given over a
6-week period, we found that neurons appear to adapt to
rmTBI with no significant differences in dendritic spine
numbers between sham and rmTBI mice at 1, 60, or 365
days after injury. We postulated that this was a habituation
to the effect of mTBI. To test our hypothesis, we increased
the time period between rmTBI from 1 to 7 days, which
increased the period of convalescence between rmTBI
reinstated dendritic spine loss after the final mTBI. The
spine loss in 30 rmTBI mice over 30 weeks was not
significantly greater than the loss occurring after a single
mTBI, showing that there is not an additive effect of
rmTBI on dendritic spinedeven if there is a sufficient
period of rest between injuries. One of the mechanisms that
control dendritic spine loss after TBI includes calcineurin,
a
calcium/calmodulin-dependent
phosphatase.28,31
TBI
results in an increase in extracellular glutamate,32e34
leading to stimulation of glutamate receptors and activa-
tion of synaptic calcium/calmodulin-dependent proteins.35
Thus, a transient loss of dendritic spines may be a neuro-
protective effect to reduce calcium influx and to allow the
neuron to regain calcium homeostasis. The results of the
current study lead us to hypothesize that dendritic spine
loss after mTBI may not be a detrimental event, but instead
may reflect a normal response of the neuron to adapt to the
changing environment. This neuroprotective event after
mTBI does not happen if repetitive injuries occur without a
period of rest and recuperation between head impacts. The
chronic consequences of habituation to this response are
unclear.
Chronic White Matter Inflammation Is Induced by
rmTBI
Our intent in developing this model of mTBI was to
have a model that presented with minimal cell death or
neuroinflammation after a few impacts. Although pre-
clinical
models
of
mTBI
have
been
reported
by
numerous groups, many report serious adverse effects,
including skull fracture, extensive white matter axonal
injury, and widespread cell death, that would not make
these models suitable for scaling up to a greater number
of rmTBIs.3e8 More recent models have reduced these
adverse events, but remain limited in their number of
repeat impacts.27,36e41 Our model has limited adverse
events; however, we do find slowly accumulating white
matter damage in the optic tract. Damage to the optic
tract occurs concurrently with microglial transformation
from ramified microglia to large, bushy microglia. These

 activated microglia can also be found in the lateral
geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. The optic nerve and
tract have now been shown to be damaged in diverse
injury models, including blast injury,42,43 rmTBI,38,41,44
and FPI,45,46 suggesting that the visual system could
be studied as an indicator of exposure to trauma. It is
unclear why the visual system is susceptible to different
types of injury, but the vulnerability of the optic tract to
rmTBI may stem from the position of the optic nerve
below the brain. The vasculature of the optic nerve is
derived from the pial arteries, and it is possible that any
swelling of the optic nerve after rmTBI will cause a
localized ischemia that may be exacerbating the injury to
this nerve. Indeed, disruption of the blood-brain barrier
around the optic tract has been reported after FPI and
rmTBI.41,46 These same studies noted optic nerve dam-
age, a loss of retinal ganglion cells, and functional eye
deficits after rmTBI,41,44 although the loss of RCG is not
reported after FPI.46 We did not quantify retinal gan-
glion cells in our model system.
We also observed that the number of Iba-1epositive cells
in the optic tract continued to significantly increase through
60 days after injury. These cells, which were also CD68
positive, presented with a large, bushy morphology. Inter-
estingly, the significant increase in these cells from 1 to 60
days after injury corresponded to a significant reduction in
silver staining from 1 to 60 days after injury, suggesting that
their presence may be involved in the resolution of axonal
injury in these mice. By 365 days after injury, the silver
staining abnormalities had resolved, but the number of
microglia remained significantly elevated and sporadic
bushy microglia remained. These data demonstrate that
white matter pathology after rmTBI is chronic, similar to
reports from human TBI brains that show that white matter
inflammation is a long-lasting consequence of TBI, with
activated microglia residing in white matter tracts up to 18
years after TBI in humans,47 and 1 year after mTBI in
mice.48 We have not characterized the functional state of the
microglia in the optic tract after rmTBI. Further character-
ization will be needed to identify which glial phenotypes are
expressed in these microglia. We also do not know the
underlying condition of the optic tract at 365 days after
injury. Axonal degeneration of the optic nerve can occur
after rmTBI,41 and without further studies, we do not know
how chronic inflammation is involved in axonal loss and
remyelination.
Persistent Anxiety Phenotype after rmTBI
Motor impairments and cognitive deficits are commonly
reported
acutely,
subacutely,
and
chronically
after
rmTBI,5,26,27,37,48e50 and we confirm those findings in our
model. Although other groups have reported cognitive defi-
cits in their models,26,36,37 we do not see learning or memory
deficits acutely or chronically after the final mTBI. This is
consistent with the lack of dendritic spine loss in the same
mice. Anxiety-like behavior is increasingly being assessed in
animal models of rmTBI because of the increased risk of
post-traumatic stress disorder. Several groups have demon-
strated that injured rmTBI mice spend more time in the open
arms at 17 days and 3 months after injury,26 at 1 and 6
months after injury,27 and at 12 months after injury,48 which
corresponds to reduced anxiety and increased risk-taking
behavior. Herein, we find that rmTBI mice spend less time
in the open arms at 365 days after injury, which corresponds
to increased anxiety.
Our study shows that extending the interinjury interval
can alter the response of dendritic spines to rmTBI, and we
believe that a shorter interinjury interval will also affect
behavioral outcome measures. Recently, preclinical studies
of rmTBI suggest that impacts sustained within vulnerable
time periods will amplify brain pathology,51 and result in
cognitive and behavioral deficits5,36,52 up to a year after
injury.26,48 Conversely, increasing the recovery time be-
tween impacts can improve cognitive outcome and attenuate
brain pathology after rmTBI.37 Future studies on the inter-
injury interval in our model will determine whether that
precipitates a worse outcome after rmTBI.
rmTBI Does Not Induce Amyloid or Tau Pathology in
3xTG-AD Mice
We introduced the 3xTg-AD mouse model into these
experiments to study acute and chronic amyloid and
tau changes after rmTBI. CTE is primarily known as a
tauopathy;
however,
because
52%
of
114
neuro-
pathologically confirmed CTE brains also demonstrate
concomitant
Ab
plaque
deposition,11
we
wanted
to
introduce a mouse model that has the ability to produce
both amyloid and tau pathology. The 3xTg-AD mouse
overexpresses mutant human APP and tau, leading to
amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain.16 In AD, the
formation of neurofibrillary tangles is preceded by the
accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau.53 However,
although hyperphosphorylation of tau seems to be a
prerequisite for tau pathogenesis,54 it does not necessarily
lead to tangle formation, as exemplified by tau hyper-
phosphorylation during early development.55 Which form
of
tau
is
actually
pathogenic
is
still
an
ongoing
debate.56,57 Nevertheless, phosphorylation is routinely
examined in animal models of AD as a first step to
examine tau pathology, because there is no animal model
that develops tangles without tau hyperphosphorylation.
In our study, we found no changes in tau phosphorylation
in multiple brain regions, including the cortex, hippocampus,
or thalamus/striatum. However, multiple groups, including
ours, have reported acute increases in phosphorylated
(phospho-tau) epitopes after a single TBI, including after
controlled

 closed-head injury.61 Those reports involve a single TBI, are
limited in the number of phospho-epitopes they describe, and
are using animal models of higher severity than the model
we describe herein. Acute increases in phospho-tau after
rmTBI have been reported in wild-type mice at 12, 24, and
48 hours after two mTBIs,38 but again this mouse model is
more severe than our rmTBI model, with more extensive
white matter damage through the corpus callosum. There has
been one report of accelerated hyperphosphorylated tau
staining, accompanied by an increase in Gallyas silver
staining, in aged human tau mice exposed to 5 rmTBIs over
a 9-day period and euthanized 21 days after the final
injury.12 However, we found no evidence of increased
phospho-tau at either 1 or 30 days after injury in our aged
3xTg-AD mice. There are differences between our study
and the study by Mouzon et al.49 We used a different
transgenic mouse model (3xTg-AD has a single mutant
human tau isoform, but the human tau mouse has all
six human tau isoforms), and the trauma model used in
the human tau study appears to be more severe than our
model, with traumatic axonal injury evidenced by APP
accumulation in the corpus callosum in their model. We did
not see any APP accumulation in our mice. Because the
acute increases in phospho-tau appear to occur primarily in
traumatically injured axons,58,59 this difference between the
level of axonal injury might explain why we do not see
changes in phospho-tau in our mice. This rationale also
holds true for the lack of an increase in Ab, or a shift in
solubility of Ab, after 30 rmTBIs. We, and others, have
previously shown that the abnormal production of Ab after
TBI occurs at sites of axonal injury,23,59,62 and in the
absence of APP-positive varicosities, it is unlikely that Ab
is being produced in higher amounts in our 3xTg-AD mice.
Conclusions
We have described a new model of rmTBI that can be
scaled to mimic the numbers of rmTBIs that have been
reported in professional athletes. We find that the brain has
complex reactions to a repeat versus a single mTBI with
no adaptation to LOC after impact, but with adaptation
occurring because of the loss of dendritic spines. Dendritic
spine loss can be reinstated if the number of impacts is
spaced further apart, suggesting that the temporary loss of
spines is a normal response to mTBI that is lost when the
interinjury interval is too short. Repeat strain on white
matter pathways can result in prolonged inflammation that
continues for months after the final mTBI, confirming pre-
vious groups’ assertions that the optic system may be
vulnerable to rmTBI.41,44 The relationship between rmTBI
and the development of tauopathy remains complex, and
herein we report no evidence of phospho-tau or Ab accu-
mulation in 3xTg-AD mice after rmTBI. This model will be
useful for the study of synaptic loss after mTBI and rmTBI
as a trigger of white matter pathology.
