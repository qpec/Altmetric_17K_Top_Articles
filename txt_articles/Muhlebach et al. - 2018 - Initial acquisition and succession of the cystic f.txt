Abstract
The cystic fibrosis (CF) lung microbiome has been studied in children and adults; however,
little is known about its relationship to early disease progression. To better understand the
relationship between the lung microbiome and early respiratory disease, we characterized
the lower airways microbiome using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from
clinically stable CF infants and preschoolers who underwent bronchoscopy and chest com-
puted tomography (CT). Cross-sectional samples suggested a progression of the lower air-
ways microbiome with age, beginning with relatively sterile airways in infancy. By age two,
bacterial sequences typically associated with the oral cavity dominated lower airways sam-
ples in many CF subjects. The presence of an oral-like lower airways microbiome correlated
with a significant increase in bacterial density and inflammation. These early changes
occurred in many patients, despite the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in our cohort during the
first two years of life. The majority of CF subjects older than four harbored a pathogen domi-
nated airway microbiome, which was associated with a further increase in inflammation and
the onset of structural lung disease, despite a negligible increase in bacterial density com-
pared to younger patients with an oral-like airway microbiome. Our findings suggest that
changes within the CF lower airways microbiome occur during the first years of life and that
distinct microbial signatures are associated with the progression of early CF lung disease.

 Author summary
CF lung disease is characterized by persistent airway infection by complex microbial com-
munities. These communities often consist of pathogens and endogenous microbes typi-
cally associated with the oral cavity. The development of these complex communities and
their relationship to CF lung disease progression is unclear. To understand the evolution
of the CF lower airways microbiome, we applied sensitive molecular detection methods to
characterize the bacterial DNA sequences in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples
obtained from clinically stable infants and preschoolers who underwent bronchoscopy.
Our findings demonstrate that CF infants have relatively sterile lower airways with a pro-
gressive shift to a microbiome dominated by aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species
commonly associated with the oral cavity. This initial acquisition of a lower airways
microbiome was associated with a significant increase in bacterial burden and increased
airway inflammation. Transition from an oral dominated to a pathogen dominated lower
airways microbiome correlated with a further increase in inflammation and the onset of
structural disease despite a negligible increase in bacterial density. Our findings suggest
that oral microbes may play an important role in early CF airway disease and could poten-
tially predispose subjects to subsequent infection by pathogens.
Introduction
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem genetic disease in which pulmonary manifestations
account for the majority of morbidity and mortality. CF lung disease is characterized by thick-
ened airway secretions, bacterial infection, and neutrophil dominated inflammation that leads
to progressive airway destruction (bronchiectasis) and, ultimately, respiratory failure [1]. Tra-
ditional pathogens associated with CF lung disease include Staphylococcus aureus and Haemo-
philus influenzae in the first years of life, followed by an increasing prevalence of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa in older children and adults [2].
Sensitive molecular based (16S rRNA gene sequencing) microbiome analysis of respiratory
secretions from children and adults with CF suggest that infection is polymicrobial and often
includes both traditional CF pathogens and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria typically found in
the oral cavity [3–8]. Extended culture methods have confirmed that bacteria typically found
in the oral cavity are present and viable in CF respiratory secretions, with densities similar to
those of pathogens [9, 10] and higher than that seen in samples from healthy volunteers [11].
Oral bacteria have also been found in distal areas of the lung from a young CF patient at time
of lobectomy [12]. However, contamination of lower airways samples by oropharyngeal secre-
tions during collection remains a significant concern in airway microbiome research [13].
Consistent with this concern, it has been shown that oral bacteria are abundant in sputum and
throat swabs from end-stage CF patients immediately prior to lung transplant, but airway sam-
ples obtained directly from the explanted lungs immediately after transplant are dominated
almost exclusively by traditional CF pathogens [14].
Carefully controlled bronchoscopy studies indicate that the lower airways microbiome of
healthy volunteers is similar in composition, albeit significantly lower in density, to that of the
oropharynx [15–18]. The lower airways microbiome in healthy individuals is likely derived
from normal microaspiration of upper airways secretions and not contamination during bron-
choscopy [13, 19, 20]. In healthy individuals, oropharyngeal bacteria are presumed to be tran-
sient in the lower airways and their detection is unlikely to represent true colonization. As
seen in microbiome studies of healthy porcine lungs, much of the bacterial DNA recovered by

 bronchoscopy is DNase sensitive, indicating that it is largely derived from bacteria that have
been killed by lung defenses [21]. Increased DNA from oral bacteria in the lower airways, dur-
ing disease, may reflect increased residence time due to defective clearance or diminished
innate immune function rather than colonization. It has been proposed that exposure of the
lower airways to anaerobes and/or oral bacteria, even if transient, is likely to influence lung
physiology, local metabolites and mucosal immune homeostasis [20, 22, 23].
In several countries (United Kingdom, Germany, and most CF Centers in Australia) antibi-
otic prophylaxis is given to children with CF until they are two years of age [24], while other
European countries treat any bacteria detected in cough-swabs during routine CF clinic visits
[25]. In the United States prophylactic antibiotic therapy for infants and young children with
CF is not recommended [26]; however, a recent clinical trial in the US and Canada showed
that children less than 6 years of age spent an average of two months per year on antibiotic
therapy for increased respiratory symptoms [27].
Airway inflammation in CF can be detected within the first few months to years of life,
despite the absence of clinically diagnosed infection [28, 29]. Furthermore, increased inflam-
mation and structural lung disease occurs in children with CF despite the use of prophylactic
antibiotics [30–33]. The underlying cause of early airway inflammation in CF remains contro-
versial and may reflect undiagnosed infection [28, 29, 34], altered immune function [35, 36],
or a response to mucus obstruction [37].
To better understand the microenvironment in very young, clinically stable, CF subjects,
we applied sensitive molecular detection methods to characterize the microbiome of the lower
airways using cross-sectional BAL samples obtained from infants and preschoolers who under-
went bronchoscopy as part of the Australian Respiratory Early Surveillance Team for Cystic
Fibrosis (AREST CF) study. The early CF lower airways microbiome was analyzed in relation
to antibiotic prophylaxis, BAL markers of inflammation and structural lung disease, measured
by chest computed tomography (CT), to elucidate the evolution of the lower airways micro-
biome with respect to disease progression.
Results
Study population and control samples
To examine the early lower airways microbiome in CF, we obtained BAL samples collected
during annual AREST CF study bronchoscopies from 46 CF subjects, ranging in age from
approximately 3.5 months to five years with a median age of 1.95 years and an interquartile
range (IQR) of 1.13–4.06 years. All subjects were diagnosed with CF through newborn screen-
ing. Patients were intubated during CT and bronchoscopy to control breathing and avoid aspi-
ration. Per Australian clinical care standards, all children with CF are prescribed amoxicillin-
clavulanic acid as antibiotic prophylaxis during the first two years of life. Thirty samples
were obtained from subjects aged two years or younger. Seventeen samples showed clinically
defined infection (i.e., BAL cultures showed a density of �105 colony forming units/ml of a
recognized pathogen). Twenty-three subjects were homozygous and 22 subjects were hetero-
zygous for the F508del CFTR mutation. One subject had two other CFTR mutations. All sub-
jects were seen routinely by a CF nutritionist and recommended a high fat diet with enzyme
supplementation. Breastfeeding status was not collected.
For 25 patients, we processed two separate aliquots of pooled BAL collected from the right
middle lobe (RML) for methods development. A single RML-derived BAL sample was studied
from an additional 21 patients. Seven of the 46 subjects in this study had a second longitudinal
BAL sample collected from the RML four to 22 months after the initial sampling. Longitudinal
samples were included in observational analyses, while only a single sample per patient was

 considered in statistical analyses (see Methods). Clinical and study related data for all patients/
samples is provided as Supporting Information (S1 Appendix). To control for background sig-
nal introduced during patient sampling, a saline wash was collected from two study associated
bronchoscopes prior to BAL; bronchoscope washes were not available for all samples. Addi-
tionally, an aliquot of sterile water was included as a process control at the DNA extraction
step. All patient and control samples were analyzed by bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing
and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to determine bacterial identity and den-
sity, respectively.
Composition of the early CF lower airways microbiome
DNA was extracted from all samples as previously reported for similar studies [14, 15]. Given
that infant BAL is likely to have low biomass, we randomly selected a subset of patient samples
for protocol development, using the method of Lundberg et al. as a starting point [38]. Empiri-
cal testing indicated that 25 cycles of initial amplification of the V4 16S rRNA gene region
followed by 20 cycles of barcoding was necessary to generate sufficient 16S rRNA gene ampli-
cons for sequencing. All samples, including controls were individually barcoded, pooled and
sequenced simultaneously. After sequence processing and quality control, a total of 7.5 million
sequences were classified into 423 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs).
Given the potential for PCR bias in low biomass samples, we assessed the reproducibility of
our methods by comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequence data for all 25 duplicate BAL aliquots
(three were longitudinal), which matched the age distribution of the larger cohort (median,
1.86 years; IQR, 1.11–3.97). For analysis, these replicate samples were partitioned from the
main sample set and rarefied to 6,000 sequences to retain all samples and represent their
sequencing depth evenly. For the 25 duplicate BAL aliquots, the median Pearson product-
moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC, r) between replicates was 0.98 (IQR, 0.81–1.00), at
the OTU level. Community composition was highly similar between most replicates when
OTUs were binned to both phylum (Fig 1A) and the lowest identifiable taxonomic level (Fig
1B), where the median PPMCC was 0.98 (IQR, 0.85–1.00) for the latter.
Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis of the replicates showed that
patient samples separated into discrete groups (S1 Fig). Those replicates with the lowest correl-
ative values generally co-localized to the same group (Fig 1B, S1 Fig) and were subsequently
determined to contain low biomass (S1 Appendix) and background sequences (see below).
Comparison of the replicate samples suggested that our methodology was sufficiently robust,
and that single BAL samples were likely to provide a reasonable description of the lower air-
ways microbiome in our cohort.
Distinct bacterial community structures define the early CF airways
microbiome
Given the general agreement of the replicate samples, sequence data were pooled for each of
the 25 duplicate BAL aliquots and rarefied to 11,000 sequences. Analysis of the combined ali-
quot data by NMDS confirmed that the samples separated into three discrete groups at the
OTU level, designated as G1, G2 and G3 (Fig 2). G1 was composed of samples with the lowest
replicate correlative values (median, 0.68; IQR, 0.44–0.87), while samples with the highest rep-
licate correlative values segregated to G2 (median, 0.99; IQR, 0.98–1.00) and G3 (median, 1.00;
IQR, 1.00–1.00). The groups also showed a trend with regard to patient age (Fig 2); G1 includ-
ing the youngest patients (median, 1.08 years; IQR, 1.00–1.17), while G2 (median, 1.67 years;
IQR, 1.20–1.96) and G3 (median, 4.09 years; IQR, 4.02–4.31) included increasingly older
patients. Shannon diversity indices for each group were similar between G1 and G2; however,

 G3 was significantly lower than G2 (S2A Fig). The samples within G1 tended to have the larg-
est differences in diversity scores between replicate pairs (median, 0.52; IQR, 0.27–0.71) as
opposed to G2 (median, 0.20; IQR, 0.15–0.25) and G3 (median, 0.09; IQR, 0.03–0.29).
Analyses of the two bronchoscope washes and a process control (three background con-
trols) showed high correlations with each other at the OTU and genus level (average r = 0.94,
r = 0.94, respectively). As shown previously, the background signal originating from sample
collection reagents and DNA extraction kits [39, 40] can dominate extremely low biomass
samples and provide a signature for samples that otherwise lack appreciable amounts of bacte-
ria [41]. Approximately 90% of the sequences in the three background controls were sourced
from OTUs assigned to families Enterobacteriaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, and Comamonada-
ceae (S3A Fig). Previous sequencing studies have reported at least two of these taxa as contami-
nants derived from DNA extraction reagents [39, 40].
To determine whether background sequences contributed to the observed BAL OTU
groups, we compared the average sequence signature for the background controls to the aver-
age for each of the observed sample groups. At the OTU level, the average background signal
correlated highly with G1 (r = 0.81) and not with G2 or G3 (r = 0.02, r = -0.01, respectively).
Further, the average background signal grouped with G1 samples, by NMDS (Fig 2). OTUs
within G1 were dominated by Bradyrhizobiaceae, Comamonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae,
similar to the background controls (S3B Fig). In contrast, G2 was dominated by Streptococcus
and G3 was dominated by Haemophilus and Moraxella (S3B Fig). Based on this analysis, we

 conclude that two potential bacterial community types are present in our early CF cohort, rep-
resented by G2 and G3, while G1 samples were largely explained by background signal and
represent samples that lack an appreciable host-derived microbiome.
To determine whether these groups were maintained in a larger sample set, we expanded
our analysis to include an additional 28 BAL samples (four of which were longitudinal) for
which only a single aliquot was available. In addition, the average background signal was
treated as an independent sample and included for reference. NMDS analysis of the complete
cohort, at the OTU level, showed that many of the additional samples distributed closely with
the previously defined groups (G1-G3). A subset of samples appeared to contain unique OTU
distributions or a mixture of OTUs from multiple groups (S4 Fig). Additionally, the age distri-
bution of the samples continued to exhibit a group associated trend (S4 Fig).
Identification of early CF airways bacterial community determinants
To identify the taxonomic associations that distinguish samples within our cohort, we con-
ducted a principal component analysis (PCA). Previous studies have demonstrated that low
biomass airway microbial community structure can be adequately defined by considering only
the most abundant community members [41–43]. Therefore, to reduce complexity in our
dataset, we considered taxa that contributed �0.5% of the average relative abundance across
all samples. Based on this cut-off, 23 taxa accounted for >95% of all sequence data. Principal
component analysis of all samples indicated that these 23 taxa separated into three distinct
associations or clusters, designated C1, C2 and C3. (Fig 3). Cluster type C1 was defined by
seven taxa; most often associated with the environment or abundant in our background con-
trols (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae, Comamonadaceae, and Bradyrhizobiaceae). Further, the aver-
age background signal grouped with the C1 dominated BAL samples (Fig 3, white circle),
indicating that these samples lack an appreciable lung derived microbiome. C2 was primarily
defined by ten taxa typically associated with the oral cavity (e.g., Streptococcus, Prevotella and
Veillonella). C3 was represented by six taxa, including those recognized clinically as pathogens
in CF (e.g., Haemophilus, Staphylococcus, Moraxella and Pseudomonas). Shannon diversity for
C1 and C2 samples were similar, while C3 values were significantly lower (S2B Fig).
To further examine and visualize the relationships between the members of these cluster
types, we generated a correlation matrix for the 23 taxa used in the PCA, across all BAL sam-
ples (S5 Fig). As expected, there was a positive correlation between taxa within C1 (average
r = 0.39±0.12) and C2 (average r = 0.43±0.06). However, taxa in C1 and C2 negatively corre-
lated with each other (average r = -0.29±0.10), suggesting that the C1 and C2 clusters of bacte-
ria tended to be mutually exclusive within our BAL samples. In contrast, taxa within C3 did
not correlate with each other (average r = -0.02±0.03) or with taxa from C1 or C2 (average r =
-0.08±0.11 and -0.10±0.05, respectively), indicating that members of cluster type C3 generally
occur independently of each other consistent with the lower diversity ascribed to this cluster.
Cluster types are associated with differences in age and bacterial
density
Given that >95% of sequences could be assigned to three associative clusters, we examined
the BAL samples based on the relative proportion of each cluster (Fig 4). When viewed in this
way, it was clear that some samples contained a mixture of cluster types, which helped describe
the overall lower airways microbiome structure of the study cohort when observed through
NMDS (S6 Fig). C1 dominated samples were most prevalent in the youngest patients (<1
year), whereas the C3 signature was generally associated with older subjects (>4 years) (Fig 4).
The C2 BAL cluster type was most prevalent in the intermediate age group. While cross-

 sectional, these results suggest that the dominant cluster type may change in a temporal or
age-associated manner. To test this hypothesis, each patient sample was defined as C1, C2 or
C3 according to its dominant cluster type (S1 Appendix). Comparison of patient age based on
these cluster designations showed that C1 dominated patients were generally younger, but not
significantly different from C2. In contrast, C3 designated samples came from patients that
were significantly older than both C1 and C2 patients (Fig 5A).
Samples assigned to C1 were associated with background signal, suggesting that they har-
boured extremely low levels of airways derived bacterial DNA. To determine if bacterial bur-
den differed between samples based on the assigned dominant cluster type, we used qPCR to
assess absolute bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies in each sample (Fig 4). Groupwise comparisons
showed that C2 and C3 dominated samples were not different from each other, but had signifi-
cantly greater bacterial densities than C1 (Fig 5B), which was similar to background (Fig 4).
This further supports the conclusion that C1 dominated samples lack an appreciable lung-
derived bacterial microbiome. As expected, there was a positive correlation between age and
16S rRNA gene copy number (r = 0.32; p�0.05). Cluster assignments were further supported

 by clinical culture results, which showed that 10 of 12 subjects in C3 were infected with a
known CF pathogen compared to 6 of 21 in C2 and 1 of 20 in C1 (S1 Appendix).
Bacterial cluster type is associated with patient phenotype
We next evaluated the relevance of the dominant BAL cluster types to disease progression
using BAL markers of inflammation and CT-defined structural lung disease as measures of
disease severity (Fig 5C–5G, S1 Table). Patients with BAL samples defined as C1 had the low-
est inflammation (total cell counts, total neutrophils and IL-8) and minimal to no detectible
structural lung disease (bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis) based on CT scan.
Patients with samples identified as C2 showed intermediate inflammation, with significantly
higher total cell counts and total neutrophils compared to those designated as C1, but
showed minimal structural change to the airways. While C2 samples were dominated by oral
associated bacterial sequences, they often contained a small proportion of pathogen derived
(C3) sequences (Fig 4). However, the presence of pathogen sequences in C2 designated sam-
ples did not account for the increase in inflammation (S7 Fig) in this patient group. Those
patients with samples belonging to C3 exhibited further increases in both, inflammation and

cluster type suggests acquisition of an oral-like airway microbiome between one and two years of age. A gradual transition to a pathogen dominated
community type begins around age four. Bacterial density is presented as the log of 16S rRNA gene copies/ml BAL for each sample on the secondary

 structural lung disease (Fig 5, S1 Table). To account for additional factors, including study
site and antibiotic prophylaxis, we conducted multivariate analyses of the clinical data.
When adjusted for these factors, the data indicated significantly higher BAL inflammation
in patients with samples identified as C2 and C3 compared to C1 (S1 Table), and increased
structural lung disease (bronchiectasis) in C3 designated patients compared to C1. Taken
together, these results suggest that increasing disease severity correlates with changes in the
lung microbiome.
To evaluate the specific contribution of oral flora and conventional CF pathogens, as dis-
tinct groups, to disease severity and progression, we used multiple regression analysis (S2
Table). When corrected for the presence of conventional pathogens, the relative abundance
of oral-associated taxa (as a group) was significantly associated with increased bacterial 16S
rDNA copy number, total cell counts and total neutrophils. These results demonstrate that the
presence of an oral-like lower airways community is directly associated with early inflamma-
tion. In contrast, increasing relative abundance of conventional pathogens (as a group) was
significantly associated with increased bacterial 16S rDNA copy number, measures of inflam-
mation and structural lung disease (bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis scores).
Further, the increasing relative abundance of both oral taxa and pathogens were significantly
associated with measures of early inflammation when regression analyses were controlled for
patient age (S2 Table).

 Longitudinal evaluation of community type
While the vast majority of samples in this study were cross-sectional, we evaluated seven sub-
jects who had longitudinal BAL samples to test for temporal related changes in bacterial cluster
type. Samples from five of the seven subjects did not show a change in cluster type over time.
However, samples from two subjects showed a changed from an initial background dominated
cluster type (C1) to an oral dominated cluster type (C2) (S4, S6 and S8 Figs). Interestingly, the
single pathogen dominated longitudinal pair showed a shift from Haemophilus to Moraxella
during the sampling interval (S8 Fig). Despite this genus level shift, the pathogen cluster type
(C3) was maintained. While the number of longitudinal samples available for this study was
limited, our analysis suggests that the relative composition of taxa within a given cluster type
may be dynamic over time, but cluster typing designations are relatively stable. When cluster
type did change within this subset of patients, it resulted in progression from C1 to C2.
Discussion
Methodological considerations
This study describes early changes in the CF lower airways microbiome in a unique study pop-
ulation, namely infants and preschool children who underwent bronchoscopy and CT scan at
times of clinical stability. This young and clinically stable population showed absence of an
appreciable lower airways infection in a subset of samples derived from the youngest subjects.
Given the inherent low biomass in BAL samples from our cohort, extensive PCR amplification
was needed to enhance sensitivity, which increased the risk of detecting background contami-
nation [40]. Here, the background signal allowed for the differentiation and comparison of
samples that lacked appreciable host derived bacteria, from those in which bacteria were pres-
ent in appreciable quantities. The microbial signal present in BAL from the C1 subjects closely
resembled the background detected in bronchoscope washes and processing reagents. The pre-
dominance of background sequences and low detectible bacterial biomass by qPCR (approxi-
mately 100 bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies/ml BAL on average) enhances our confidence that
C1 designated samples came from patients that were not bacterially infected. This was consis-
tent with clinical microbiology results, which showed that only one of the twenty C1 samples
was culture positive for a pathogen. Importantly, the relative abundance of background
sequences became negligible in the C2 and C3 samples, where non-background taxa domi-
nated and bacterial biomass was increased by 3–4 orders of magnitude. Comparison of dupli-
cate aliquots of the same BAL samples showed that our methodology was reproducible and
that PCR bias was negligible. As expected, the greatest variability between replicates was seen
in C1 samples that lacked appreciable patient derived bacterial DNA.
Dynamics of microbial community structures and lung disease
Interestingly, we found that bacterial sequences detected in the lower airways samples of these
CF infants and young children separated into three distinct cluster types. Further evaluation
indicated that samples from our C1 group lacked a true lower airways bacterial community
and represented an uninfected state. C2 samples harbored an actual microbial community
resembling that found in the upper airway or oral cavity. We hypothesize that these samples
represent the initial acquisition of a lower airways microbiome. Finally, we found that older
subjects often harbored a lower airway bacterial community dominated by one or a few tradi-
tional CF pathogens.
We hypothesize that the increased abundance of bacteria typically found in the oral cavity
in BAL reflects repeated micro-aspiration. Despite aspiration typically being more prevalent in

 infants less than one year of age, and bacterial communities being established in the oral cavity
in the first few months of life [44, 45], subjects with BAL samples dominated by oral micro-
biota were mostly >12 months old in this study. Thus, we hypothesize that additional events
early in life are necessary to establish lower airway niches capable of supporting the accumula-
tion and persistence of oral microbes (e.g., decreased mucociliary clearance, increased mucus
accumulation, and an anaerobic microenvironment). Given that bacterial density in BAL was
similar in samples dominated by oral bacteria and pathogens, it seems possible that orally
derived microbes may colonize or infect the lower airways; however, our study was not
designed to distinguish airway colonization or infection from reduced clearance of aspirated
bacteria. The oral community in these BAL samples included taxa identified in studies of older
CF subjects by both molecular-based [3, 4, 8] and culture-based detection with densities
approximating those of pathogens [11]. The role that these aerobic and anaerobic oral bacteria
play in CF pathogenesis remains a subject of discussion. Recent functional studies have dem-
onstrated that members of the oral microbiota may play an important role in conditioning the
mucin rich lower airways environment for subsequent colonization by pathogens [22]. While
many CF pathogens are incapable of efficiently metabolizing intact mucins for growth, consor-
tia of oral microbes can use mucin carbohydrates as a primary nutrient source [22, 46]. Metab-
olites derived from degradation of mucins by these oral-derived consortia, support growth of
traditional pathogens [22]. In addition, short chain fatty acids released by fermentation also
contribute to inflammation [47]. As such, the oral dominated community type, detected in
our study, may drive nutritional changes and inflammation in the lower airways environment,
providing a potential mechanistic explanation for the increase in BAL markers of inflamma-
tion and the microbial succession seen in our young CF cohort.
Those subjects with BAL samples harbouring recognized pathogens had the highest mark-
ers of inflammation and overt structural lung disease. When present, pathogen sequences were
at a higher relative abundance than other taxa, despite the BAL not having significantly greater
microbial density than oral bacteria dominated samples. This dominance of pathogens is con-
sistent with previous reports of decreased microbial diversity in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs
across a wide age range [3, 48, 49]. Sputum based studies typically showed a progressive
decrease in diversity with increasing disease [4, 50, 51]. In older patients, these findings may
reflect increased antibiotic exposure [52] and/or once acquired, pathogen competition [53].
Here, progression of the airway microbiome and disease markers was heterogeneous, but gen-
erally changed with age. Multivariate analyses adjusted for age, indicated that the association
of the pathogen dominated community type with increased neutrophil counts and bronchiec-
tasis remained significant.
Challenges of assessing the earliest CF airways microbiome
Although contamination of BAL with oral secretions can occur during bronchoscopy, this was
minimized by placement of an endotracheal tube prior to the procedure. Importantly, contami-
nation during the procedure does not explain the age dependent appearance of distinct commu-
nity types, or the presence of lower airway inflammation with oral microbiota. We acknowledge
that we did not have access to healthy non-CF infant control BAL samples to assess the normal
lower airways microbiome or measure baseline inflammatory markers; however, given the inva-
sive nature of bronchoscopy, collection of such samples would not be ethical. Further, the focus
of this study was to elucidate the development of a lower airway microbiome in children with
CF.
All children in this study were prescribed amoxicillin-clavulanic acid during the first two
years of life, which could have affected our results, or delayed the onset of lower airways

 acquisition of oral microbes. Our multi-variate analyses corrected for this; however, we cannot
accurately determine or predict the effect of early antibiotics has on presence of the lower air-
way microbiome in general. Antibiotics are prescribed frequently and early to infants and chil-
dren with CF during times of increased respiratory symptoms [27] and antibiotic prophylaxis
is recommended in young children with CF in several countries [24].
However, in the face of antibiotic prophylaxis a transition from background to an oral-like
lower airways microbiome occurred, which may imply that bacteria are able to persist or accu-
mulate in lower airways niches (e.g., mucus) despite antibiotic exposure. Further, adjustment
for antibiotic prophylaxis in the multivariate analyses showed progressive disease in those
dominated by oral bacteria at an age while children were still on prophylaxis.
True longitudinal studies of BAL microbiome in infants and children are difficult to per-
form but several groups have taken approaches to assess the development of the airway coloni-
zation in CF children. Hoen et al. examined the development of the gastrointestinal and
respiratory microbiome in infants with CF, where respiratory samples were obtained by OP
swab [54]. They showed a core microbial community spanning oral and intestinal samples that
included genera detected in our study. For the gut microbiota, a predictive change occurred
prior to onset of P. aeruginosa detection. However, as shown by clinical microbiology, the pre-
dictive value of OP swabs to BAL derived lower airways samples is modest [55, 56]. In our
study, such comparisons of oral and/or stool microbiome to BAL microbiome was not possible
as the AREST CF protocol does not include upper airway samples or stool collection. A more
recent study compared the microbiome of OP and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs to BAL in chil-
dren with different underlying airway diseases. The study found that microbial community
composition differed significantly between the sample types [57]. Nonetheless, the underlying
microbial communities detected were predictive of disease state (i.e., prolonged cough, non-
CF bronchiectasis, and children without lower airway infection).
Longitudinal comparisons of nasal microbiota have revealed that differences emerged
within the first year of life in CF compared to healthy infants [58]. Comparison of the NP
microbiome in infants with CF to healthy infants showed increasing separation of the micro-
bial composition (e.g., increased Staphylococcus OTUs in CF) between the groups during the
first six months of life [59]. Our data using BAL sampling in all subjects supports the premise
that CF infants are initially uninfected. With time, our subjects exhibited a progressive increase
in the density of oral bacteria in the lower airways, which ultimately changed to a pathogen
dominated environment.
This conclusion is consistent with data from a small subset of patients in our study that had
longitudinally collected BAL. Five of seven patients maintained the same microbial commu-
nity type between sampling intervals (3.6 to 24 months), while two subjects progressed from
an uninfected or background cluster type to an oral bacteria dominated community over time.
Summary and implications
This study is unique in that it utilized lower airways samples obtained by bronchoscopy
through an endotracheal tube from clinically stable subjects with CF ranging from infancy to
preschool age. The study revealed that most CF subjects less than one year old had negligible
bacterial densities in their BAL. Subsequently, a change in composition was seen with predom-
inance of oral bacterial sequences in the 1–2 year olds and increasing presence of pathogens in
samples from 3–5 year old subjects. The acquisition of an oral bacteria dominated lower air-
way microbiome and the succession to a pathogen dominated microbiome were each associ-
ated with increased markers of disease. Based on our analyses, we conclude that stratification
of patients based on BAL cluster type was highly indicative of disease status. Testing the

 hypotheses of microbial community succession, the relevance of oral aspiration, and mucus
plugging as a contributor to disease progression will require a larger longitudinal sample set.
Methods
Subjects
AREST CF conducts annual bronchoscopy and chest CT scans on infants and children diag-
nosed with CF when clinically stable [60]. In this study we included BAL samples from chil-
dren who had undergone bronchoscopy and CT between 2011 and 2013. Subjects were
enrolled in the CF clinics at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Australia and the
Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. Antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin-cla-
vulanic acid (15 mg/kg/day) is prescribed during the first two years of life to all children with
CF in Perth and Melbourne. Subjects / BAL samples in this study were stratified to include a
range from the earliest BAL to 5 years with and without infection on BAL diagnosed by clinical
microbiology.
Ethics statement
All BAL samples used in this study were collected under AREST CF protocols at Princess Mar-
garet Hospital for Children, Perth, Australia and the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne,
Australia. AREST CF protocols were approved by Ethics Committees at both institutions. All
samples were anonymized and stored for research purposes. The parents of participating chil-
dren were informed of risks and given time to agree or decline voluntary participation prior to
the start of all research procedures. Written parental consent was obtained for all subjects and
included approval to share samples with other studies. The use of anonymized AREST CF
BAL samples in this study was approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
office of Human Research Ethics.
Bronchoalveolar lavage and CT scan
Bronchoscopy and CT scan procedures were performed as previously described [60]. Briefly,
intravenous general anaesthesia with intubation was used to control breathing for the CT scan
and to avoid contamination of the bronchoscope. BAL was performed with three aliquots of 1
ml/kg normal saline instilled into and aspirated from the right middle lobe (RML) and one ali-
quot into the most diseased lobe per CT-scan. The first aliquot from the RML was collected in
a separate suction trap and sent to clinical microbiology lab for culture. The pooled 2nd and 3rd
aliquots were collected into a single suction trap and stored frozen at -80˚C in separate 1ml ali-
quots. These aliquots were subsequently used for assessment of inflammatory markers and
microbiome analysis.
Volumetric CT scans were used for inspiratory assessment and either a 3-slice protocol at
end expiration or volumetric expiratory assessment. The previously used semi-quantitative
CF-specific CT scoring system measures gas trapping, bronchial wall thickening and bronchi-
ectasis [30, 61]. Markers of lung inflammation in BAL included total and differential cell
counts, and IL-8 measured by ELISA as done previously [62, 63].
Microbiome analyses
The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was targeted for sequencing in a two-step prepa-
ration, using modified universal primers adapted from Lundberg et al. [38]. Bead-cleaned,
equimolar concentrations of amplicons (approximately 450 base pairs in size) were sequenced
on an Illumina MiSeq using a V2 paired-end 500 cycle kit. Raw sequence data was deposited

 in the European Nucleotide Archive (Study ID PRJEB13657). Read and data processing was
performed in QIIME 1.8.0 and R version 3.2.3. Specific details of quantification, sequencing,
and analysis are provided (S1 File).
Statistical methods
Clinical data were archived prospectively in the AREST CF database. Data are reported as
median and interquartile (25–75%) range using inflammatory markers and CT scores as con-
tinuous outcomes. To account for multiple sampling, patients with longitudinal samples had
either time point 1 or time point 2 randomly selected to be included in all statistical compari-
sons. This random selection was performed once and maintained throughout all analyses (see
S1 Appendix). Group comparisons were performed using Tukey’s HSD with a significance
threshold of 0.05. Multiple regression analysis was performed in R version 3.3.3. Multivariate
analyses used linear mixed effects models adjusted for age, antibiotic prophylaxis, and study
site with significance at 0.05. Analyses were performed using Stata 13.0 (StataCorp LP) and
JMP Pro 12.0.1 Software (SAS).
