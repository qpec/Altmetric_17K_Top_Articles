 Summary
Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB) is a critical virulence factor causing diseases associated with 
C. difficile infection (CDI). Here we carried out CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-wide screens 
and identified the members of the Wnt receptor Frizzled (FZDs) family as TcdB receptors. TcdB 
binds to the conserved Wnt-binding site known as the cysteine-rich domain (CRD), with the 
highest affinity toward FZD1, 2, and 7. TcdB competes with Wnt for binding to FZDs, and its 
binding blocks Wnt signaling. FZD1/2/7 triple-knockout (KO) cells are highly resistant to TcdB, 
and recombinant FZD2-CRD prevented TcdB binding to the colonic epithelium. Colonic 
organoids cultured from FZD7 KO mice, combined with knock-down of FZD1 and 2, showed 
increased resistance to TcdB. The colonic epithelium in FZD7 KO mice was less susceptible to 
TcdB-induced tissue damage in vivo. These findings establish FZDs as physiologically relevant 
receptors for TcdB in the colonic epithelium.
Introduction
Infection of the colon by the opportunistic Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile 
leads to a range of manifestations from diarrhea to life-threatening pseudomembranous 
colitis and toxic megacolon1–5. It is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated 
diarrhea and a leading cause of gastroenteritis-associated death in developed countries, 
accounting for nearly a half-million cases and 29,000 deaths annually in the United States6. 
Two homologous exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), are the causal agents for 
diseases associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI)4,7–9. These toxins enter cells 
via receptor-mediated endocytosis and inactivate small GTPases by glucosylating a key 
residue, resulting in cell-rounding and eventual death of cells4,7,10. Of the two toxins, TcdB 
alone is capable of causing the full spectrum of diseases, as TcdA−B+ strains have been 
clinically isolated and engineered TcdA−B+ strains induced death in animal models11–14.
How TcdB targets the colonic epithelium remains unknown. TcdB can enter a variety of cell 
lines, suggesting that its receptor(s) are widely expressed in transformed cells. It has also 
been reported that TcdB is enriched in the heart after injection into zebrafish embryos15. 
Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4, also known as neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2)) 
has been identified as a TcdB receptor in a shRNA-mediated knock-down (KD) screen16, 
and was shown to be a functional receptor for TcdB in HeLa cells and in HT-29 cells, a 
human colorectal cell line. However, CSPG4 is not expressed in the colonic epithelium17. 
Poliovirus receptor-like 3 (PVRL3) was recently identified from a gene-trap insertional 
mutagenesis screen in Caco-2 cells, a human colorectal cell line, as a factor involved in 
necrotic cell death (cytotoxicity) induced by TcdB18, but whether it functions as a TcdB 
receptor remains to be established.
Here we carried out unbiased genome-wide screens using the CRISPR (clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats) / Cas9 approach19,20 and identified the members of 
the Frizzled (FZDs) family as TcdB receptors. Utilizing colonic organoid models and FZD7 
KO mice, we established FZDs as physiologically relevant receptors for TcdB in the colonic 
epithelium.

 Results
CRISPR/Cas9 screen for TcdB receptors
The C-terminal domains of TcdA and TcdB contain a region known as combined repetitive 
oligopeptides (CROPs) (Extended Data Fig. 1a), which can bind carbohydrates and may 
mediate toxin binding to cells21. Recent studies suggested the presence of an additional 
receptor-binding region beyond the CROPs22–25. Consistently, we found that a truncated 
toxin (TcdB1-1830) lacking the CROPs induced cell-rounding in various cell lines at 
picomolar concentrations (Extended Data Figs. 1b–d)26. In order to identify both the 
receptor(s) recognized by the CROPs and the receptor(s) recognized by other regions, we 
carried out two separate screens, with either full-length TcdB or TcdB1-1830 (Fig. 1a).
HeLa cells that stably express RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 were transduced with 
lentiviral libraries that express short guide RNAs (sgRNA) targeting 19,052 genes, with six 
sgRNAs per gene19. After four rounds of selection with increasing concentrations of toxins, 
the sgRNA sequences from the surviving cells were identified via next-generation 
sequencing (NGS). We ranked candidate genes based on the number of unique sgRNAs 
versus NGS reads (Fig. 1b, c, Extended Data Fig. 2, Source Data).
UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP2) stood out in both screens (Fig. 1b, c). UGP2 is a 
cytosolic enzyme producing UDP-glucose, which is used by TcdA and TcdB to glucosylate 
small GTPases. Mutations in UGP2 have been shown to render cells resistant to TcdA and 
TcdB27,28. Besides UGP2, the top hit from the full-length TcdB screen is CSPG4 (Fig. 1b), 
confirming a previous report that identified CSPG4 as a TcdB receptor16. The highest-
ranking plasma membrane protein from the TcdB1-1830 screen is Frizzled 2 (FZD2) (Fig. 
1c). FZD2 is a member of the Frizzled family of receptors for Wnt signaling, which is a key 
signaling pathway regulating proliferation and self-renewal of colonic epithelial cells29,30. 
Besides FZD2, an unusual group of high-ranking hits are subunits of the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC)31,32.
To validate the screening results, we generated UGP2−/−, CSPG4−/−, FZD2−/−, and EMC4−/− 
HeLa cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach (Supplementary Table 1). Two additional 
KO cells were also generated and examined: SGMS1−/− (sphingomyelin synthase 1) and 
IL1RAPL2−/− (Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 2) (Fig. 1c). These cells were 
challenged with either TcdB or TcdB1-1830 using the cytopathic cell-rounding assay1 
(Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). UGP2−/− cells were highly resistant (~3000-fold) to both TcdB 
and TcdB1-1830 compared to wild-type (WT) HeLa cells (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 2). 
CSPG4−/− cells showed increased resistance to TcdB (~240-fold), but not to TcdB1-1830. 
FZD2−/− and EMC4−/− cells both showed increased resistance (~15 and ~11-fold, 
respectively) to TcdB1-1830, but not to TcdB. SGMS1−/− and IL1RAPL2−/− cells did not 
show significant changes in the sensitivity to toxins under our assay conditions. Increased 
resistance of UGP2−/−, CSPG4−/−, FZD2−/−, and EMC4−/− cells was further confirmed by 
immunoblot analysis for glucosylation of Rac1, a small GTPase (Extended Data Fig. 3c).

 CSPG4 is a CROPs-dependent TcdB receptor
We next focused on CSPG4 and FZD2 as potential TcdB receptors. Binding of TcdB to 
CSPG4−/− cells was reduced compared to WT HeLa cells (Fig. 2b). Ectopic expression of 
NG2 (rat CSPG4) restored binding and entry of TcdB (Fig. 2b, d). TcdB binds directly to 
purified NG2 extracellular (EC) fragments, independent of the chondroitin sulfate glycan in 
NG2 (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). The above results are consistent with a previous report16. 
However, contrary to the previous suggestion that CSPG4 does not bind to the CROPs16, we 
conclude that the CROPs is essential for TcdB binding to CSPG4 because: (1) TcdB1-1830 
does not bind to either purified NG2-EC or NG2 expressed on cell surfaces (Extended Data 
Fig. 4b, c); (2) CSPG4−/− cells showed similar levels of sensitivity to TcdB1-1830 as WT 
cells (Fig. 2a); and (3) the CROPs is capable of competing with TcdB for binding to CSPG4 
on cell surfaces (Extended Data Fig. 4d, e). We note that the previous study utilized 
TcdB1851-2366 as the CROPs16. Recent structural studies confirmed that the CROPs region 
starts around residue 1834 instead of 185133. Here we used full-length CROPs (residues 
1831–2366). It is possible that the region 1831–1850 is required for TcdB binding to 
CSPG4.
FZDs are CROPs-independent receptors
Transfecting CSPG4−/− cells with FZD2 also increased binding of TcdB (Fig. 2c) and 
restored entry of TcdB into CSPG4−/− cells (Fig. 2d), suggesting that FZD2 is an alternative 
receptor. In contrast to CSPG4, ectopically expressed FZD2 increased binding of TcdB1-1830 
and TcdB1501-2366 on cell surfaces, but not the CROPs (Extended Data Figs. 4c, f), 
suggesting that it is a CROPs-independent receptor. FZD2 is a 7-pass transmembrane protein 
and contains a sole distinct extracellular domain known as the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) 
(Fig. 2e)29. Consistently, recombinant Fc-tagged FZD2-CRD binds directly to glutathione S-
transferase (GST) tagged TcdB1501-2366, but not to the CROPs in pull-down assays (Fig. 2e).
It is possible that CSPG4 is expressed at a much higher level than FZD2 in HeLa cells, 
which may explain why TcdB binding to CSPG4−/− cells is barely detectable using 
immunostaining and immunoblot assays. Notably, TcdB can enter CSPG4−/− cells at 
picomolar concentrations, as detected by the sensitive cytopathic cell-rounding assay (Fig. 
2f). Such entry is blocked by recombinant FZD2-CRD in a dose-dependent manner, as 
evidenced by a lack of cell-rounding and Rac1 glucosylation (Fig. 2f, g), suggesting that 
endogenous FZD2 mediates TcdB binding and entry in CSPG4−/− cells.
The FZD family includes ten members (FZD1–10) in humans29. The ectopic expression of 
FZD1, 2, and 7 each increased binding of TcdB to CSPG4−/− cells (Fig. 2h, Extended Data 
Fig. 5a), likely because the CRDs of FZD1, 2, and 7 share ~98% sequence similarity 
(Extended Data Fig. 5b)29. Consistently, FZD7-CRD, but not FZD8-CRD, when expressed 
on cell surfaces via a fused GPI anchor, mediated strong binding of TcdB to cells (Extended 
Data Fig. 5c).
HeLa cells express multiple FZDs34. We next generated FZD1 and FZD7 single-KO HeLa 
cells, as well as FZD1/2/7 triple-KO cells. FZD1/2/7−/− cells exhibited normal growth rates, 
likely because HeLa cells still express other FZDs. FZD1−/− and FZD7−/− cells showed

 reductions in sensitivity to TcdB1-1830 similar to those of FZD2−/− cells (Fig. 2i). 
FZD1/2/7−/− cells were highly resistant to TcdB1-1830 (~300-fold), confirming that FZD1, 2, 
and 7 all contribute to TcdB1-1830 entry into HeLa cells. Transfection of FZD1, 2, or 7 
restored TcdB1-1830 entry into FZD1/2/7−/− cells (Fig. 2j). FZD1/2/7−/− cells also become 
~10-fold more resistant to full-length TcdB than WT cells (Fig. 2i), indicating that 
endogenous FZD1/2/7 are responsible for a portion of TcdB entry into WT HeLa cells. 
FZD1/2/7−/− cells showed the same level of sensitivity to TcdA as WT cells (Extended Data 
Fig. 5d), confirming that the resistance of FZD1/2/7−/− cells is specific to TcdB.
We further quantified the binding kinetics between CRDs of FZD1, 2, and 7 and TcdB using 
the bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay. The results revealed a single binding site with low 
nanomolar affinities (KD = 32 nM for FZD1, 19 nM for FZD2, and 21 nM for FZD7) (Fig. 
2k, Extended Data Fig. 5e, Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, FZD2-CRD showed the 
same binding affinity to TcdB1-1830 (KD = 17 nM) as to full-length TcdB (Extended Data 
Fig. 5f). FZD5-CRD also binds to TcdB when measured by the sensitive BLI assay, but with 
a much weaker affinity than FZD1/2/7 (KD = 670 nM, Fig. 2k, Extended Data Fig. 5e). It is 
possible that additional FZD family members may function as low-affinity receptors for 
TcdB.
The finding that EMC4−/− cells showed a similar level of toxin resistance as FZD2−/− cells is 
also consistent with FZDs being TcdB receptors (Fig. 2a). Although its function remains to 
be established, the EMC appears to be critical for the folding/stability of multi-
transmembrane proteins35,36. Consistently, expression of transfected FZD1, 2, or 7 was 
reduced in EMC4−/− cells compared to WT cells (Extended Data Fig. 5g, h).
CSPG4 versus FZDs in cell lines
We next addressed whether TcdB is capable of simultaneous binding to both CSPG4 and 
FZDs. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 6a, FZD2-CRD binds to TcdB pre-bound by 
immobilized NG2-EC on the microtiter plate, confirming that CSPG4 and FZDs do not 
compete with each other for binding to TcdB.
We then examined the receptors responsible for TcdB entry in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, 
which are known to express multiple FZDs37. FZD2-CRD protected both HT-29 and Caco-2 
from TcdB1-1830 (Fig. 3a, b), suggesting that FZDs are functional receptors in these two cell 
lines. Interestingly, CSPG4 is expressed at high levels in HeLa, much lower levels in HT-29, 
and is undetectable in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3c). Consistently, NG2-EC alone was sufficient to 
reduce TcdB entry into HeLa cells, whereas a combination of NG2-EC and FZD2-CRD was 
required to reduce TcdB entry into HT-29 cells, and FZD2-CRD alone protected Caco-2 
cells (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 6b). These data suggest that CSPG4 and FZDs represent 
non-competing TcdB receptors, each capable of mediating binding and entry of TcdB. Their 
particular contribution in a given cell type may depend on their expression levels.
We also tested the potential role of PVRL3. Ectopically expressed PVRL3 did not increase 
either binding or entry of TcdB into CSPG4−/− HeLa cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b). The 
recombinant ecto-domain of PVRL3 failed to protect Caco-2 cells from TcdB in the 
cytopathic cell-rounding assay, whereas FZD2-CRD protected cells (Extended Data Fig. 7c). 
Tao et al.

 Thus, PVRL3 is not likely a relevant receptor for the cytopathic effect of TcdB in HeLa and 
Caco-2 cells.
FZDs are TcdB receptors in colonic organoids
To determine the receptors that mediate TcdB entry into the colonic epithelium, we first 
utilized colonic organoids, an in vitro “mini-gut” model that recapitulates many important 
features of normal colonic epithelium38. Exposure to TcdB caused dose-dependent atrophy 
and death of organoids, which was quantified using a viability assay (Fig. 4a). We found that 
TcdB1-1830 and TcdB were equally potent, suggesting that CSPG4 is not a relevant receptor 
in colonic organoids (Extended Data Fig. 8a). It has been reported that CSPG4 is not 
expressed in the colonic epithelium17, which was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of 
colonic organoids and isolated mouse colonic epithelium (Extended Data Fig. 8b).
We next utilized colonic organoids cultured from FZD7 KO mice, combined with 
adenovirus-mediated KD of FZD1 and FZD2 (Extended Data Fig. 8c, d). FZD7 is critical 
for maintaining intestinal organoids, but FZD7−/− organoids can be cultured in the presence 
of CHIR99021, a small molecule inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), which 
activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling downstream of FZDs39. FZD7−/− organoids showed 3-fold 
more resistance to TcdB than WT organoids (Fig. 4b). Further KD of FZD1/2 in FZD7−/− 
organoids yielded 9-fold greater resistance to TcdB than WT organoids (Fig. 4b), 
demonstrating that FZDs are relevant TcdB receptors in colonic organoids.
As both TcdB and Wnt bind to the FZD-CRD, we examined whether TcdB binding 
competes with Wnt and inhibits Wnt signaling. We utilized a non-toxic TcdB fragment 
(residues 1114–1835), which contains the FZD binding region but not the enzymatic domain 
of TcdB. This fragment blocked Wnt3a-mediated signaling in 293T cells in a dose-
dependent manner, demonstrated by the TOPFLASH/TK-Renilla dual luciferase reporter 
assay (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 9a), as well as by phosphorylation levels of LRP6 (a FZD 
co-receptor) and Dvl2 (a downstream Wnt signaling component) (Extended Data Fig. 9b)29. 
TcdB1114-1835 did not glucosylate small GTPases in colonic organoids (Extended Data Fig. 
9c), yet it inhibited organoid growth and induced death (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 9d, e). 
The death of colonic organoids was rescued by CHIR99021, demonstrating that the effect of 
TcdB1114-1835 is due to blockage of Wnt signaling. These data raised the intriguing 
possibility that binding of TcdB to FZDs may directly contribute to disruption of the colon 
epithelium by inhibiting Wnt signaling.
FZDs are TcdB receptors in colonic epithelium
Finally, we examined the colonic epithelium in vivo. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis 
showed that FZD2 and FZD7 are expressed in mouse and human colonic epithelium (Fig. 
5a, b, Extended Data Fig. 10a–f). In contrast, CSPG4 is predominantly expressed in the 
multi-nucleated sub-epithelial cells termed ISEMFs (intestinal sub-epithelial myofibroblasts) 
and is not detectable in the colonic epithelium (Fig. 5c, Extended Data Figs. 10c), which is 
consistent with a previous report17.
As TcdB is released into the lumen of the colon during CDI, we developed a model in which 
we injected TcdB directly into the lumen of ligated colon segments in mice (Fig. 5d), which

 resulted in binding and entry of TcdB into the colonic epithelium (Fig. 5e). Co-injection of 
FZD2-CRD largely abolished binding of TcdB (Fig. 5e), suggesting that FZDs are the 
dominant receptors in the colonic epithelium.
To further verify the role of FZDs in vivo, we turned to FZD KO mouse models. FZD2/7 
double-KO mice are embryonic lethal, and FZD2−/− mice also displayed developmental 
defects40. FZD7−/− mice appear to develop normally and exhibit no overt intestinal defects 
under basal conditions39,40. Thus, we chose FZD7−/− mice to assess whether a loss of a 
major colonic FZD member may reduce TcdB toxicity in vivo. To focus the analysis on the 
colonic epithelium and avoid the potential effects of TcdB entry into CSPG4-expressing 
ISEMFs, we utilized TcdB1-1830 and injected the toxin into the lumen of ligated colon 
segments of live mice. Following an 8-hour incubation period, fluid accumulation was 
observed in WT mice, but was significantly reduced in FZD7−/− mice (Fig. 5f). Histological 
scoring revealed extensive disruption of the epithelium, inflammatory cell filtration, and 
edema in WT mice, but much less in FZD7−/− mice (Fig. 5g, Extended Data Fig. 10g). To 
further assess epithelial integrity, we performed immunofluorescent analysis on colonic 
sections for the cell-cell junction markers Claudin-3 and ZO-1. Both markers were 
extensively disrupted in WT mice after exposure to TcdB1-1830 but remained largely intact in 
FZD7−/− mice (Fig. 5h, Extended Data Fig. 10h). Together, these data demonstrate that 
FZDs are physiologically relevant receptors for TcdB in the colonic epithelium in vivo.
Discussion
Our findings support a previously proposed two-receptor model for TcdB20, but with a 
notable amendment: FZDs and CSPG4 may act as receptors in different cell types. CSPG4 is 
expressed in the ISEMFs, which are involved in diverse processes from wound healing to 
inflammation41. Although the role of ISEMFs in CDI remains to be established, it is 
conceivable that targeting these cells by TcdB could contribute to the disease progress 
following FZD-mediated disruption of the colonic epithelium.
Our unbiased genome-wide screens revealed multiple host factors involved in all major steps 
of toxin actions, from receptors (FZDs and CSPG4) to acidification in endosomes (Vacuolar-
type H+-ATPase)42,43, to enzymatic activity in the cytosol (UGP2) (Extended Data Fig. 10i). 
Many other top-ranking hits remain to be validated, such as FBXO11 and enzymes involved 
in phospholipid metabolism/signaling including phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase 
(PIP4K2B), phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KB), and phospholipase C (PLCG1) 
(Extended Data Fig. 10i).
Our screen identified many key players in Wnt signaling pathways, including APC, 
GSK-3β, Wnt5a, and LRP6 (Extended Data Fig. 10i). It has been suggested that TcdA 
attenuates Wnt signaling in cells, although the effects appear to be indirect, largely due to 
deactivation of Rho GTPase by TcdA44. Wnt signaling is particularly important for 
maintaining colonic stem cells30,45, which continuously give rise to new colonic epithelial 
cells. The health of these stem cells is critical for self-renewal and repair of the colonic 
epithelium, which has an extraordinarily fast turnover rate44. Our findings suggest that 
colonic stem cells are a major target of TcdB. The potential role of Wnt signaling inhibition

 in CDI pathogenesis, and the therapeutic potential of modulating Wnt signaling downstream 
of FZDs warrant further study. Finally, dysregulation of Wnt signaling pathways is 
associated with many cancers, particularly colorectal cancers30,46. The receptor-binding 
domain of TcdB, or its homologs, may serve as valuable tools and potential therapeutics for 
targeting Wnt signaling pathways.

 Generating stable HeLa-Cas9 cells and lentivirus sgRNA libraries
The human codon-optimized sequence of S. pyogenes Cas9 was subcloned from plasmid 
lentiCas9-Blast (Addgene #52962) into the pQCXIH retroviral vector (Clontech), which was 
used to generate retroviruses to transduce HeLa cells. Mixed stable cells were selected in the 
presence of hygromycin B (200 μg/ml, Life Technologies). Lentivirus sgRNA libraries were 
generated following published protocols using the human GeCKO v2 sgRNA library 
(Addgene #1000000049)19. The GeCKO v2 library is composed of two half-libraries 
(library A and library B). Each half-library contains three unique sgRNA per gene and was 
independently screened with toxins. Cells were transduced with lentivirus-packaged sgRNA 
library at a MOI of 0.2.
Screening CRISPR libraries with TcdB and TcdB1-1830
For each CRISPR half-library of cells, 4×107 cells were plated onto two 15-cm culture 
dishes to ensure sufficient coverage of sgRNAs, with each sgRNA on average being 
represented about 650 times (i.e., there are on average 650 cells transduced with the same 
sgRNA). This over-representation rate was calculated from titration plates that were set up in 
parallel with the library. These cells were exposed to either TcdB or TcdB1-1830 for 48 h. 
Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove loosely 
attached round-shaped cells. The remaining cells were re-seeded and cultured with normal 
medium without toxins until ~70% confluence. Cells were then subjected to the next round 
of screening with increased concentrations of toxins. Four rounds of screenings were carried 
out with TcdB (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 pM) and TcdB1-1830 (5, 10, 20, and 50 pM). The 
remaining cells were harvested and their genomic DNA extracted using the Blood and Cell 
Culture DNA mini kit (Qiagen). DNA fragments containing the sgRNA sequences were 
amplified by PCR using primers lentiGP-1_F 
(AATGGACTATCATATGCTTACCGTAACTTGAAAGTATTTCG) and lentiGP-3_R 
(ATGAATACTGCCATTTGTCTCAAGATCTAGTTACGC). Next-generation sequencing 
(Illumina MiSeq) was performed by a commercial vendor (Genewiz).
Generating HeLa KO cell lines
The following sgRNA sequences were cloned into LentiGuide-Puro vectors (Addgene) to 
target the indicated genes: CCGGAGACACGGAGCAGTGG (CSPG4), 
GCGCTGCTGGGACATCGCCT (EMC4), ACCTTATACCACACAACATC (IL1RAPL2), 
TGCGAGCACTTCCCGCGCCA (FZD2), AGCGCATGACCACTACACTG (SGMS1), 
ACAGGCAGAAAACGGCTCCT (UGP2), GTGTAATGACAAGTTCGCCG (FZD1), and 
GAGAACGGTAAAGAGCGTCG (FZD7). HeLa-Cas9 cells were transduced with 
lentiviruses that express these sgRNAs. Mixed populations of stable cells were selected with 
puromycin (2.5 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). FZD1/2/7−/− cells were created by 
sequentially transducing FZD1 and FZD7 sgRNA lentiviruses into FZD2−/− cells and further 
selected in the presence of 100 pM TcdB1-1830. The mutagenesis rate in these mixed stable 
cells was determined by NGS (Supplementary Table 1).

 Cytopathic assay
The cytopathic effect (cell-rounding) of TcdA and TcdB was analyzed using standard cell-
rounding assay as previously described1. Briefly, cells were exposed to a gradient of TcdB 
and TcdB1-1830 for 24 h. Phase-contrast images of cells were taken (Olympus IX51, 10–20X 
objectives). The numbers of round-shaped and normal shaped cells were counted manually. 
The percentage of round-shaped cells was plotted and fitted using the Origin software.
Blocking TcdB entry into cells with NG2-EC and FZD2-CRD-Fc
Recombinant proteins used for cell protection assays were pre-filtered (0.22 μm, Millipore). 
Toxins were pre-incubated with FZD2-CRD-Fc and/or NG2-EC (P1) for 30 min on ice with 
a toxin/protein ratio of 1:400 (except when specifically noted in the figure legend). The 
mixtures were added into cell culture medium and cells were analyzed by the cytopathic 
assay.
Transfection, TcdB binding to cells, and immunoblot analysis
Transient transfection of HeLa cells was carried out using PolyJetTM (SignaGen). Binding of 
TcdB to cells was analyzed by exposing cells to TcdB or truncated TcdB fragments for 10 
min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then either fixed for 
immunostaining analysis or harvested with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 1% NP40, 150 mM 
NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, plus a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-
Aldrich)). Cell lysates were centrifuged and supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and 
immunoblot analysis using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce). The full blot 
images are shown in Supplementary Figure.
Pull-down assays
Pull-down assays were carried out using glutathione Sepharose 4B as previously 
described48. Briefly, 5 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST) tagged TcdB1831-2366 and 
TcdB1501-2366 were immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with FZD2-CRD-Fc 
(10 nM) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed, pelleted, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and 
subjected to immunoblot analysis.
Biolayer interferometry (BLI) assay
The binding affinities between TcdB and FZD-CRDs were measured by BLI assay using the 
Blitz system (ForteBio). Briefly, the CRDs-Fc of FZD1, 2, 5, 7 or human IgG1 Fc (20 
μg/ml) were immobilized onto capture biosensors (Dip and Read Anti-hIgG-Fc, ForteBio) 
and balanced with PBS. The biosensors were then exposed to TcdB or TcdB1-1830, followed 
by washing with PBS. Binding affinities (KD) were calculated using the Blitz system 
software (ForteBio).
Wnt signaling assay
The TOPFLASH/TK-Renilla dual luciferase reporter assay was utilized to detect Wnt 
signaling activities as previously described51. Briefly, 293T cells in 24-well plates were co-
transfected with TOPFLASH (50 ng/well), TK-Renilla (internal control, 10 ng/well), and 
pcDNA3 (200 ng/well). After 24 h, cells were exposed to Wnt3a (50 ng/ml) and

 TcdB1114-1835 (1:8, 1:40, and 1:200 to Wnt3a) in culture medium for 6 h. Cell lysates were 
harvested and subjected to either firefly/renilla dual luciferase assay or immunoblot analysis 
for detecting phosphorylated Dvl2 and LRP6. Wnt signaling activates expression of 
TOPFLASH luciferase reporter (firefly luciferase). Co-transfected renilla luciferase serves 
as an internal control.
Microtiter plate-based binding assay
Binding assays were performed on 96-well plates (EIA/RIA plate, Corning Costar) as 
described previously50. Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with 10 μg/ml NG2 proteins in 
coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.3) at 4 °C overnight, and then blocked with 1% bovine 
serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Plates were then incubated with the indicated proteins for 1 h 
in PBS. Wells were washed three times with PBS plus 0.05% tween-20 at room temperature. 
One-step Turbo TMB (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used as the substrate, and absorbance 
at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader.
Organoid Culture, KD, and TcdB challenge assay
Crypt isolation from WT or FZD7−/− mouse colon was carried out as previously described, 
and organoids were expanded as spheroid cultures using conditioned medium52. Except for 
WT organoids used for Wnt signaling inhibition assay, CHIR99021 (3 μM) was also added 
to the medium39. Five days after passaging, organoids were re-suspended with Cell 
Recovery Solution (ThermoFisher Scientific) and mechanically fragmented. Fragments were 
transduced with adenoviruses expressing shRNA for FZD1, FZD2, or a control shRNA 
sequence using medium supplemented with Nicotinamide (10 mM, Sigma), Polybrene (8 
μg/ml, Sigma), and Y-27632 (10 μM, Sigma), washed, and plated in growth factor-reduced 
Matrigel (Corning)53. Three days following viral transduction, organoids were challenged 
with TcdB by adding the toxin into the medium. Viability of organoids was quantified after 
72 h.
Wnt signaling inhibition in WT colon organoids
TcdB1114-1835 was added into the culture medium of WT colon organoids. For rescue 
experiments, 5 μM CHIR99021 was also added to the medium. The medium was changed 
every 48 h with the constant presence of TcdB1114-1835 and/or CHIR99021. Viability of cells 
was analyzed after six days.
Generating FZD1 and FZD2 KD adenovirus
All shRNAs were purchased from Sigma (MISSION shRNA library). The KD efficiency 
was validated as described in Extended Data Fig. 8c, d. ShRNA sequences showing the 
highest efficiency were selected to generate adenoviruses. Adenoviruses expressing a control 
shRNA (5’-CTGGACTTCCAGAAGAACA-3’), shRNAs against mouse FZD1 (shRNA#2: 
5’-TGGTGTGCAACGACAAGTTTG-3’), or FZD2 (shRNA#5: 5’-
CGCTTCTCAGAGGACGGTTAT-3’) were constructed using the Block-it U6 adenoviral 
RNAi system (Life Technologies), followed by viral packaging and multiple rounds of 
amplification in 293A cells (Life Technologies).

 Viability assay for colonic organoids
The viability of colonic organoids was assessed using the MTT assay as previously 
described54. Briefly, the MTT solution was added to the organoid culture (500 μg/ml). After 
incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the medium was discarded. For each well (containing 20 μl of 
Matrigel, in a 48-well plate), 60 μl of 2% SDS solution was added to solubilize the Matrigel 
(1 h, 37 °C), followed by the addition of 300 μl of DMSO to solubilize reduced MTT (2 h, 
37 °C). The absorbance at 562 nm was measured on a microplate reader. Twenty μl of 
Matrigel without organoids was used as blank control. Normal organoids without exposure 
to toxins were considered as 100% viable.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and histology analysis
Colons from adult mice (C57BL/6 strain (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, 
#000664), 10–12 weeks old, both male and female mice were used and randomly distributed 
into experimental groups) were dissected out and subjected to cryosectioning into sections 
8–10 μm thick. Colonic sections were fixed in cold acetone for 5 min and then washed three 
times with PBS. The colonic sections were then blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 30 
min at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies overnight (anti-TcdB: 
1:600; anti-FZDs: 1:250; rabbit anti-NG2: 1:250), followed with biotinylated goat anti-
chicken or rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:200, Vector Lab) for 1 h at room temperature. 
The sections were then incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:500, DAKO) for 30 
min. Immuno-reactivity was visualized as red color with 3-amino-9-thyl carbazole (DAKO). 
Cell nuclei were labeled blue with Gill’s Hematoxylin (1:3.5, Sigma). Frozen human colon 
tissue slides were purchased from BioChain Institute Inc. and subjected to IHC analysis. IF 
analysis of Claudin-3 and ZO-1 was carried out using mouse colon tissues fixed in 10% 
formalin and embedded in paraffin (anti-Claudin-3: 1:100; anti-ZO-1: 1:100). Confocal 
images were captured with the Ultraview Vox Spinning Disk Confocal System. Histology 
analysis was carried out with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of paraffin-embedded 
sections. Stained sections were coded and scored by observers blinded to experimental 
groups, based on disruption of the colonic epithelium, inflammatory cell filtration, and 
edema, on a scale of 0 to 3 (mild to severe).
Competition assays in colonic tissues with recombinant proteins
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Boston 
Children’s Hospital IACUC (#3028). TcdB (40 nM) was pre-incubated with either human 
IgG1-Fc or FZD2-Fc (2.4 μM) for 30 min on ice. To generate the ex vivo colon segments, 
mice (C57BL/6, 6–8 weeks, both male and female mice were used, repeated three times, 
each time four mice per group, the experiments were not randomized or blinded) were 
euthanized and the colon exposed via laparotomy. A segment in the ascending colon (~ 2 cm 
long) was sealed by tying both ends with silk ligatures. The toxin samples (40 μl) were 
injected through a LV catheter into the sealed colon segment. The injection site was then 
sealed with a hemostat. The colon was covered with PBS-soaked gauze for 2 h, then excised 
and its lumen flushed with PBS three times, and subjected to IHC analysis.

 Colon loop ligation assay
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Boston 
Children’s Hospital IACUC (#3028). WT or FZD7−/− mice (The Jackson Laboratory, 
#012825, strain B6;129-Fzd7tm1.1Nat/J, 6–8 weeks old, sample size indicated in Fig. 5f, g, 
both male and female mice were used, the experiments were not randomized or blinded) 
were anesthetized following overnight fasting. A midline laparotomy was performed to 
locate the ascending colon and seal a ~2 cm loop with silk ligatures. Two μg of TcdB1-1830 
in 80 μl of normal saline or 80 μl of normal saline were injected through a LV catheter into 
the sealed colon segment, followed by closing the wounds with stitches. Mice were allowed 
to recover. After 8 h, mice were euthanized and the ligated colon segments were excised, 
weighed, and measured. The colon segments were fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and 
subjected to either H&E staining for histological score analysis or immunofluorescent 
staining for Claudin-3 and ZO-1.

blue-stained gel. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that this band is not a fragment of 
TcdB. The top matching protein is the bacterial chaperone protein ClpB.
c, Cytopathic toxicity of recombinant TcdB and TcdB1-1830 on HeLa cells was neutralized 
by anti-TcdB polyclonal antibody (pAb), confirming that the toxicity is from TcdB and 
TcdB1-1830 (error bars indicate mean ± s.d., two independent experiments).
d, HeLa, CHO, HT-29, and Caco-2 cells were exposed to TcdB or TcdB1-1830 as indicated 
for 24 h. TcdB1-1830 induced cell rounding at picomolar concentrations. Scale bars = 25 μm 
(HT-29) or 50 μm (HeLa, CHO, and Caco-2). Representative images are from one of three 
independent experiments.

 Extended Data Figure 4. The CROPs is essential for TcdB binding to CSPG4, but not required 
for TcdB binding to FZDs
a, Schematic drawings of NG2 (rat CSPG4). Two fractions of recombinant extracellular 
domain (EC) fragments were used: one that does not contain chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains 
(EC P1), and the other that contains CS (EC P2). TMD-cyto: transmembrane and 
cytoplasmic domain.
b, TcdB, but not TcdB1-1830, binds directly to both EC P1 and EC P2 of NG2 in a microtiter 
plate-based binding assay (error bars indicate mean ± s.d., two independent experiments).
c, CSPG4−/− cells transfected with the indicated constructs were exposed to TcdB (10 nM), 
TcdB1-1830 (10 nM), or the receptor-binding domain of botulinum neurotoxin B (BoNT/B, 
100 nM) for 10 min. Cell lysates were collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis. 
IL1RAPL2 and synaptotagmin II (Syt II, a receptor for BoNT/B) served as controls. 
Transfection of NG2 increased binding of TcdB, but not TcdB1-1830, whereas transfection of 
FZD2 increased binding of both TcdB and TcdB1-1830. One of three independent 
experiments is shown.
d, The CROPs domain binds to CSPG4 on cell surfaces in a dose-dependent manner. High 
concentrations of recombinant CROPs reduced CSPG4-dependent binding of TcdB to cell 
surfaces, indicating that the CROPs can compete with TcdB for binding to CSPG4 on cell 
surfaces. One of three independent experiments is shown.
e, The CROPs domain reduced cytopathic toxicity of TcdB (5 pM) on WT HeLa cells (error 
bars indicate mean ± s.d., two independent experiments).
f, CSPG4−/− cells were transfected with FZD2 and then exposed to TcdB or indicated TcdB 
fragments. FZD2 mediated binding of TcdB, TcdB1-1830, and TcdB1501-2366, but not the 
CROPs (TcdB1831-2366). One of three independent experiments is shown.

g, WT and EMC4−/− cells were transfected with 1D4-tagged FZD1, 2, or 7. Cell lysates 
were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Expression of FZD1, 2, and 7 are reduced in 
EMC4−/− cells compared to WT cells (n = 6, *p < 0.005, one-way ANOVA). Representative 
blots are from one of three independent experiments.
h, Expression levels of CSPG4 in EMC4−/− cells is similar to those in WT cells, suggesting 
that EMC is not required for single-pass transmembrane proteins. One of three independent 
experiments is shown.

a, NG2-EC was immobilized on microtiter plates, followed by binding of TcdB, washing 
away unbound TcdB, and addition of FZD-CRD. FZD2-CRD binds robustly to TcdB that is 
pre-bound by NG2-EC on the microtiter plate. FZD2-CRD did not bind to NG2-EC without 
TcdB, and FZD5-CRD showed no detectable binding to NG2-TcdB in this assay (error bars

a, CSPG4−/− HeLa cells transfected with the indicated constructs were exposed to TcdB in 
medium for 10 min. Cell lysates were collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis. 
Expression of PVRL3 was confirmed using an anti-PVRL3 antibody. Transfection of FZD2, 
but not PVRL-3, increased binding of TcdB to CSPG4−/− cells. One of three independent 
experiments is shown.
b, Cells were challenged with TcdB (300 pM). Ectopic expression of PVRL3 failed to 
restore the sensitivity of CSPG4−/− HeLa cells towards TcdB, while expression of FZD2 
restored entry of TcdB and resulted in rounding of transfected cells. Co-transfected GFP 
marked transfected cells. Scale bar = 50 μm. One of three independent experiments is 
shown.
c, Recombinant extracellular domain of PVRL3 (PVRL3-EC) did not reduce TcdB entry 
into Caco-2 cells, analyzed by cytopathic cell-rounding assay. In contrast, FZD2-CRD 
prevented entry of TcdB into Caco-2 cells. Scale bar = 50 μm. One of three independent

a, TcdB1114-1835 blocked Wnt3a-mediated signaling in 293T cells in a dose-dependent 
manner. Increasing concentrations of Wnt restored Wnt reporter activity blocked by 
TcdB1114-1835. Wnt signaling activity was analyzed using the TOPFLASH/TK-Renilla dual

 Extended Data Figure 10. FZDs are receptors for TcdB in the colonic epithelium
a–c, Human colon cryosections were obtained from a commercial vendor and subjected to 
IHC analysis for detecting FZD7 (a), FZD2 (b), and CSPG4 (c). Ep: epithelial cells; Mf: 
sub-epithelial myofibroblasts. Scale bar = 50 μm. Representative images are from one of 
three independent experiments.
d, Expression of FZD1 is not detectable in mouse or human colonic tissues. One of three 
independent experiments is shown.
e, FZD7 antibody labeled WT colonic sections, but showed no signals on colonic tissues 
from FZD7−/− mice in IHC analysis, confirming the specificity of this antibody. One of three 
independent experiments is shown.

 f, Immunostaining of FZD2 (green) is reduced in FZD2-KD colonic organoids compared to 
control organoids, confirming the specificity of FZD2 antibody. Cell nuclei were labeled by 
DAPI (blue). Scale bar = 30 μm. One of three independent experiments is shown.
g, Experiments are described in Fig. 5g. Representative images from one of three 
independent experiments are shown. Scale bar = 100 μm.
h, Experiments were carried out as described in Fig. 5h. Low-magnification images of 
immunofluorescent staining of the cell-cell junction markers Claudin-3 (green) and ZO-1 
(red) were stitched together to show an overview of the colon tissue. The middle panel (WT/
TcdB) showed disruption of the normal staining pattern for Claudin-3 and ZO-1, indicating a 
loss of epithelial integrity, compared with both control and FZD7−/−/TcdB1-1830. Scale bar 
represents 200 μm. Representative images are from one of three independent experiments.
i, A schematic overview of cellular factors identified in the CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Validated 
and plausible cellular factors identified in our unbiased genome-wide screens were grouped 
based on their presence in the same protein complexes and/or signaling pathways. The color 
of the gene names reflects the number of unique sgRNA identified. The arrows link these 
genes to either confirmed or plausible roles in four major steps of TcdB action: (1) receptor-
mediated endocytosis; (2) low pH in the endosomes triggers conformational changes of the 
TD, which translocates the GTD across endosomal membranes; (3) GTD is later released via 
auto-proteolysis by the CPD, which is activated by the cytosolic co-factor inositol 
hexakisphosphate (InsP6); (4) released GTD glucosylates small GTPases such as Rho, Rac, 
and CDC42.

 Figure 2. FZDs are functional receptors for TcdB
a, The sensitivities of the indicated HeLa KO cells to TcdB and TcdB1-1830 were quantified 
using the cytopathic cell-rounding assay (see Extended Data Fig. 3) and normalized to WT 
HeLa cells as fold-of-resistance. The experiments have been repeated three times.
b–c, Immunostaining analysis showed that TcdB binding (10 nM, 10 min) to CSPG4−/− cells 
was reduced (b). Ectopic expression of NG2 (rat CSPG4) increased binding of TcdB. 
Transfection of FZD2 also increased TcdB binding to CSPG4−/− cells (c). Scale bar = 20 
μm. DIC: differential interference contrast.
d, Ectopic expression of CSPG4 or FZD2 restored TcdB entry into CSPG4−/− cells, resulting 
in cell-rounding (5 pM, 3 h). GFP marked transfected cells. Scale bar = 50 μm.
e, A schematic illustration of FZD (upper panel). Fc-tagged FZD2-CRD binds to GST-
tagged TcdB1501-2366, but not to GST-tagged CROPs.
f–g, FZD2-CRD prevented TcdB (300 pM, 3 h) entry into CSPG4−/− cells, measured by the 
cell-rounding assay (f) and glucosylation of Rac1 (g). Human IgG1-Fc (hIgG1-Fc) is a 
control.
h, Transfection of FZD1, 2, and 7 each increased TcdB binding (10 nM, 10 min) to 
CSPG4−/− cells, assayed by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates. Actin is a loading control.
i, The sensitivities of FZD1−/−, FZD2−/−, FZD7−/−, and FZD1/2/7−/− cells to TcdB and 
TcdB1-1830 were analyzed as described in panel a.
j, Ectopic expression of FZD1, 2, or 7 restored TcdB1-1830 entry into FZD1/2/7−/− cells (300 
pM, 3 h). Scale bar = 50 μm.
k, Characterization of TcdB binding to Fc-tagged CRDs of FZD1, 2, 5, and 7 using the bio-

Representative images are from one of three independent experiments. Scale bars = 25 μm 
(a) or 50 μm (b).
c, Expression of CSPG4 in HeLa, HT-29, and Caco-2 cells was examined via immunoblot 
analysis of cell lysates. One experiment from four is shown.
d, Protection from TcdB using FZD2-CRD and NG2-EC on HeLa (5 pM TcdB), HT-29 (50 
pM TcdB), and Caco-2 (150 pM TcdB) cells was quantified by the cytopathic cell-rounding 
assay. Representative images are shown in Extended Data Fig. 6b.

organoids exposed to TcdB (0.5 pM, 3 days). Right panel: viability of organoids exposed to 
TcdB for 3 days was quantified by the MTT assay. n = 6, *p < 0.005, t-test.
b, The IC50 (the TcdB concentration that results in 50% viability after 3 days) of WT, 
FZD7−/−, and FZD7−/−/FZD1/2 KD organoids were quantified as described in panel a. n = 8, 
*p < 0.005, one-way ANOVA.
c, TcdB1114-1835 blocked Wnt3a mediated signaling in 293T cells. n = 6, *p < 0.005, t-test.
d, Viability of colonic organoids after exposure to TcdB1114-1835 (25 nM), with or without 
CHIR99021 (5 μM), was quantified by the MTT assay. n = 8, *p < 0.005, one-way ANOVA.
Scale bars = 200 μm. Representative images are from one of three independent experiments.

 Figure 5. FZDs are TcdB receptors in the colonic epithelium
a–c, Mouse colon cryosections were subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis to 
detect FZD7 (a), FZD2 (b), and CSPG4 (c). Blue marks cell nuclei, red labels target 
proteins. Ep: epithelial cells; Mf: sub-epithelial myofibroblasts; SM: smooth muscles.
d, A schematic illustration of the colon loop ligation assay.
e, Co-injection of FZD2-CRD with TcdB into the ligated colonic segments prevented TcdB 
binding to the colonic epithelium, analyzed by IHC. Red labels TcdB and blue marks cell 
nuclei.
f–h, TcdB1-1830 was injected into the ligated colonic segments and incubated for 8 h in WT 
and FZD7−/− mice. The colon segments were then excised and analyzed for fluid 
accumulation (f), histological scoring by H&E staining (g, the representative images are in 
Extended Data Fig. 10g) and for the cell-cell junction markers Claudin-3 and ZO-1 by 
immunofluorescent staining (h, blue marks cell nuclei).
Each data point represents one mouse (f, g). Boxes represent mean ± s.e.m., and the bars 
represent s.d. (*p<0.005, one-way ANOVA). Scale bars = 50 μm. Representative images are
