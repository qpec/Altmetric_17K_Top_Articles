Abstract
Background: Physical function is integral to healthy aging, in particular as a core component of mobility and independent
living in older adults, and is a strong predictor of mortality. Limited research has examined the role of diet, which may be an
important strategy to prevent or delay a decline in physical function with aging.
Objective: We prospectively examined the association between the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), a
measure of diet quality, with incident impairment in physical function among 54,762 women from the Nurses’ Health Study.
Methods: Physical function was measured by the Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical function scale
and was administered every 4 y from 1992 to 2008. Cumulative average diet was assessed using food frequency
questionnaires, administered approximately every 4 y. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate
the HRs of incident impairment of physical function.
Results: Participants in higher quintiles of the AHEI-2010, indicating a healthier diet, were less likely to have incident physical
impairment than were participants in lower quintiles (P-trend < 0.001). The multivariable-adjusted HR of physical impairment
for those in the top compared with those in the bottom quintile of the AHEI-2010 was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.90). For individual
AHEI-2010 components, higher intake of vegetables (P-trend = 0.003) and fruits (P-trend = 0.02); lower intake of sugar-
sweetened beverages (P-trend < 0.001), trans fats (P-trend = 0.03), and sodium (P-trend < 0.001); and moderate alcohol intake
(P-trend < 0.001) were each significantly associated with reduced rates of incident physical impairment. Among top contributors
to the food components of the AHEI-2010, the strongest relations were found for increased intake of oranges, orange juice,
apples and pears, romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts. However, associations with each component and with specific foods
were generally weaker than the overall score, indicating that overall diet pattern is more important than individual parts.
Conclusions: In this large cohort of older women, a healthier diet was associated with a lower risk of developing
impairments in physical function.

Introduction
In the United States, the proportion of the population 65 y or
older is expected to reach nearly 20% by the year 2030 (1).
Physical function is increasingly recognized as key to healthy
aging, in particular as a core component of mobility and indepen-
dent living in older adults. Prior research has demonstrated that poor
physical function is related to hospitalization (2), long-term nursing
home care (3, 4), and increased mortality (4, 5) among older adults. It
is thus critical to identify modifiable factors that might prevent or
delay physical function decline.
The Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010)9 was
created as an update to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index and
incorporates foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk
(6). The AHEI-2010 emphasizes the intake of whole compared
with refined grains and distinguishes proteins based on individual
health impacts (e.g., nuts, legumes, fish, and red and processed
meats are considered separately) (6). Higher adherence to the
AHEI-2010 has been associated with better lipid and inflamma-
tory profile and decreased risk of clinical vascular disease (6).
These factors have all been previously related to physical function
(7–9). Prior studies have also indicated that low intake of some
micronutrients may be associated with reduced physical perfor-
mance, indicating that diet may play an important role in the
prevention of impairment in physical function (10).
However, to our knowledge, there has been one long-term
prospective study on the relation between diet quality and

 physical function. Thus, we used data from 54,762 participants
from the Nurses� Health Study to examine the association
between the AHEI-2010 and incident impairment in physical
function over 18 y of follow-up.
Methods
Study population. The Nurses� Health Study began in 1976, when
female registered nurses, aged 30–55 y, completed a mailed questionnaire
on their health and lifestyle. Follow-up questionnaires have been mailed to
participants every 2 y thereafter, and follow-up remains complete for
>90%. Beginning in 1980, a FFQ was included, which was repeated in
1984, 1986, and every 4 y thereafter (11). In 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, and
2008, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) was admin-
istered, a 36-item questionnaire that evaluates 8 health concepts, including
physical functioning. The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Brigham & Women�s Hospital.
Diet assessment. On the FFQ, participants report the average frequency
of food consumption during the previous year, by specified units or standard
portion sizes, by use of 9 possible responses ranging from ‘‘never or less than
once/mo’’ to ‘‘6 or more times/d.’’ The FFQ in the Nurses� Health Study has
been validated carefully against repeated 7-d diet records, and reproduc-
ibility of the dietary questionnaires has been documented (12, 13).
Criteria and methods for scoring of the AHEI-2010 have been
previously described in detail (6); the AHEI-2010 was developed to
incorporate data from food frequency questionnaires (6). Briefly, the
AHEI-2010 consists of 11 components: 6 components for which higher
intakes are better (vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts and legumes,
long-chain omega-3 FAs, and PUFAs); 1 component for which moderate
intake is better (alcohol: 2.5 or more drinks/d is assigned 0 points,
nondrinkers are assigned 2.5 points, and 0.5–1.5 drinks/d is assigned 10
points); and 4 components for which lower intake is better (sugar-
sweetened beverages and fruit juice, red and processed meats, trans fats,
and sodium). Each component is given a minimal score of 0 to indicate
‘‘worst’’ level of intake and a maximum score of 10 to indicate ‘‘best’’ level
of intake, with intermediate values scored proportionally. The best levels
of intake were determined a priori and based on a combination of the
current dietary guidelines and the scientific literature regarding the dietary
factor and chronic disease risk. All of the component scores are summed to
obtain the total AHEI-2010 score, with a range from 0 (nonadherence) to
110 (perfect adherence). For these analyses, to reduce measurement error
and to represent long-term dietary intake, the cumulative mean of all
AHEI-2010 scores from 1980 to the start of a given follow-up period was
calculated at each 4-y follow-up cycle. Thus, because baseline physical
function in this analysis was in 1992, at the first follow-up cycle, we
averaged all dietary assessments from 1980 through 1990 (see Figure 1); at
each subsequent follow-up cycle, the diet data for another year were
incorporated into the cumulative mean.
Physical function. Information on physical function was collected by
use of the SF-36 questionnaire, a widely used and validated instrument
(14). The physical function score (PFS) is a consistent and reliable
predictor of morbidity and mortality in a variety of populations (5, 15, 16).
The PFS was administered to participants starting in 1992 and every 4 y
thereafter and is comprised of 10 questions regarding physical limitations
in performing the following activities: bathing/dressing yourself, walking
one block, walking several blocks, walking more than one mile, bending/
kneeling, climbing stairs, lifting groceries, moderate activities, and vigorous
activities. Each question has the same 3 response choices; each answer of
‘‘Yes, limited a lot’’ is assigned 1 point, an answer of ‘‘Yes, limited a little’’ is
assigned 2 points, and an answer of ‘‘No, not limited at all’’ is assigned 3
points. A raw score is calculated from the set of 10 questions and ranges
from a minimum of 10 points to a maximum of 30 points. The raw score is
then transformed to a 100-point scale. A PFS score of 100 is considered
highest physical function, and a score of 80 or less is considered substantial
physical impairment (17); this cutoff point has been used in other
epidemiologic studies (17, 18). At the end of each follow-up cycle, incident
cases of impairment were defined as a PFS decreasing to 80 or below. As an
additional way to test the face validity of the PFS scoring in our cohort, we
found that only 10% of participants who scored above 80 on the PFS
reported adverse physical impact on their ability to perform their work or
other daily activities; in contrast, 40% of even those who scored between
70 and 80 also reported limitations in daily activities caused by physical
health. Thus, multiple lines of evidence support this cutoff point.
Statistical analysis. Women were excluded from this analysis if they
did not complete the FFQ at analytic baseline or had an unreasonably
high (>3,500 kcal/d) or low (<500 kcal/d) caloric intake. Additionally,
women with prevalent physical impairment (PFS # 80) in 1992, or
women who were missing information on either the AHEI-2010 or PFS
score at baseline were excluded from this analysis. The final baseline
population included 54,762 women in 1992.
To evaluate the association between quintiles of the AHEI-2010
score and incident impairment in physical function, we used age-
adjusted and multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards
models. Sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health-related covariates
were obtained from the questionnaires and updated at each 4-y time
period in the analysis. Multivariable-adjusted models included pri-
mary, a priori risk factors for physical function impairment: BMI
(continuous), total caloric intake (quintiles), physical activity [<3.0,
3.0–8.9, 9.0–17.9, 18.0–26.9, or $27 metabolic equivalents of task
(METs)/wk], SF-36 Mental Health Index score (continuous), smoking
status (never, past, current 1–14 cigarettes/d, current 15–24 cigarettes/d,
or current $25 cigarettes/d), history of hypertension (yes or no), high
cholesterol (yes or no), myocardial infarction (yes or no), stroke (yes
or no), and type 2 diabetes (yes or no). There were few missing data, but
missing data on BMI, physical activity, and smoking status were
accounted for by carrying forward data from the previous questionnaire
cycle or creating a missing indicator variable. In the Cox proportional
hazards models examining the individual components of the AHEI-2010
score, we adjusted for the same potential confounders and also included,
simultaneously in the model, the AHEI-2010 score without the compo-
nent of interest. Because physical activity is so highly related to physical
function, we modeled physical activity as a continuous variable and a
categorical variable and also conducted models with and without
physical activity and with and without updating physical activity at each
time point.
We also conducted analyses in which we investigated the relation
between the top 5 contributors to the food component groups based on
caloric intake in the study population: fruits, vegetables, nuts/legumes,
red/processed meats, or sugar-sweetened beverages. The specific foods
were categorized into servings of ‘‘never or <1/mo,’’ ‘‘1–3 times/mo,’’
‘‘1/wk,’’ or ‘‘$2/wk.’’ These are the response categories provided on the
FFQ, with the top categories of intake collapsed into one category
because of smaller numbers. For the nuts/legumes component (but not
for primary analyses of nuts), we began follow-up in 1998 because
more detailed information on specific types of nuts eaten was collected
on the 1998 FFQ, permitting specific analyses of different nut types.
Tests for trend across quintiles of the total AHEI-2010 score and score
components were calculated by treating the categories as an ordinal
variable in the proportional hazards models and assigning the median
value for that category.
To assess possible sources of bias, especially caused by the
possibility that women with early signs of physical function decline
may change their diet, we conducted several secondary analyses. First,
we conducted analyses in which we excluded participants with a

 borderline PFS (>80–85 points) at the start of each follow-up period. In
another analysis, we imposed a 6-y lag period between diet assessment
and physical function assessment. In additional research to consider
diet at midlife, we also investigated the association between diet score
at baseline and subsequent physical function. Because vascular factors
could be potential intermediates, we also constructed multivariable
models without these factors. To further consider vascular factors, we
constructed models among those with and without hypertension at
baseline and among those with and without high cholesterol at
baseline. Lastly, we conducted analyses to examine effect modification
by age by separately examining women <60, 60–66, and >66 y of age at
analytic baseline in 1992. All analyses were conducted in SAS version
9.3 (SAS Institute).
Results
Characteristics of the study population. Characteristics of
women according to quintiles of the AHEI-2010 at baseline in
1992 are presented in Table 1. In these descriptive results, there
were few apparent differences in health and lifestyle character-
istics of women across AHEI-2010 categories. However, 8.6%
of women in the highest quintile (i.e., healthiest diet) of AHEI-
2010 were current smokers, 16.1% had master�s or doctoral
degrees, and mean METs/wk were 27.8; in the lowest AHEI
quintile, 19.8% of women were current smokers, 6.4% had
master�s or doctoral degrees, and mean METs/wk were 15.9.

 AHEI-2010 and risk of physical function impairment. In age-
adjusted models (Table 2), the HR of incident impairment in
physical function was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.73; P-trend < 0.001)
comparing women in the highest quintile of AHEI-2010 score
with those the lowest quintile. After controlling for numerous
potential confounders, this HR was attenuated but remained
significant (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.90; P-trend < 0.001). The
results were similar after excluding participants with a borderline
PFS at the start of each cycle; imposing a 6-y lag between
assessment of diet and of physical function; removing vascular
factors from multivariable-adjusted models; stratifying by hyper-
tension or high cholesterol at baseline; modeling physical activity
in different ways; and stratifying by age (results not shown). In
analyses in which we examined only baseline/mid-life AHEI-2010
(i.e., we did not update diet at each cycle), we found a similar
reduced risk of impairment (e.g., for top compared with bottom
quintile of AHEI-2010 in 1990, HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.89). In
addition, the correlation between diet score at baseline and diet
score in 2002 was 0.52, indicating that diet patterns remained
fairly consistent over time.
AHEI-2010 score components, food contributors, and
physical function impairment. To ascertain whether specific
individual components of the AHEI-2010 varied in importance,
we examined the association between each AHEI-2010 com-
ponent and risk of incident impairment in physical function
(Table 2). In general, we found modest associations between
each individual component and physical function, suggesting
that overall dietary pattern is more important than its compo-
nents. Only for sodium intake did we find HRs similar in
magnitude to the overall HR of AHEI-2010 score; comparing
extreme quintiles of sodium as mg/d, the HR was 1.15 (95%
CI: 1.10, 1.19; P-trend < 0.001).
For the 5 food groups in the AHEI-2010, we also considered
the top individual contributors in our cohort (by caloric intake)
to each food group (Table 3). In multivariable-adjusted models,
similar to findings for AHEI-2010 components, the overall
pattern appeared more important than individual foods. Among
the foods examined, the strongest relations were found for
greater intake of oranges, orange juice, apples and pears,
romaine or leaf lettuce, and walnuts; we found a HR of 0.91
(95% CI: 0.88, 0.95) for extreme intakes of oranges, a HR of
0.86 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.92) for extreme intakes of orange juice, a
HR of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.99) for extreme intakes of apples
and pears, a HR of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.93) for extreme
intakes of romaine or leaf lettuce, and a HR of 0.93 (95% CI:
0.86, 0.99) comparing those who ate $2 servings of walnuts/d
compared with <1 serving/mo.
Discussion
In this large, prospective study, greater adherence to the AHEI-
2010 was associated with a lower risk of developing physical
impairment over 18 y of follow-up. Overall, the AHEI diet
pattern appeared more strongly associated with physical func-
tion than the individual components or individual foods,
although greater intake of vegetables and fruits; moderate
alcohol intake; and lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages,
trans fats, and sodium were all significantly associated with
modestly lower rates of incident physical impairment. Similarly,
greater intakes of oranges, orange juice, apples and pears, romaine
or leaf lettuce, and walnuts were associated with reduced risk
of physical function impairment.
Our results are consistent with the existing, although
limited, literature that supports an association between diet
quality and physical function. Most prior studies have been
cross-sectional with modest sample sizes. These studies have
reported that better diet quality is associated with better
physical function, as measured by the SF-36 combined with an
in-person assessment (19) or self-reported disability (20); in 2
cross-sectional studies that also used the SF-36 PFS as in our
analysis, participants with better diet quality had significantly
higher mean physical function scores (21, 22). However, in
cross-sectional studies, it is plausible that better physical
function may lead to better diet rather than the reverse. To our
knowledge, there has been only one prospective study con-
ducted. Among 3,000 participants in a French cohort of middle-
aged adults, those with best adherence to dietary guidelines had
increased physical function scores as measured by the SF-36 over
the 12-y follow-up period (23), consistent with our findings. The
epidemiologic research is supported by biologic research dem-
onstrating that higher adherence to the AHEI-2010 is associated
with a better lipid and inflammatory profile and decreased risk
of clinical vascular disease (6). These factors are all strongly
related to physical function (7–9) and thus provide a clear
biological rationale for the findings observed in this analysis.
One somewhat surprising overall finding was that increased
intake of nuts and legumes was associated with an increased
risk of physical impairment. However, after we separated this
component into the top 5 food contributors, we found the
association was driven by increased intake of peanut butter, with

 no increased risk associated with peanuts or other nuts and a
significantly reduced risk of impairment with greater walnut
intake. Thus, there is no clear explanation for this isolated
increase with peanut butter; it could potentially be a chance
finding but deserves further investigation. Moreover, evidence
from the PREDIMED (Prevenci´
on con Dieta Mediterr´
anea)
randomized trial has demonstrated that a Mediterranean diet
[made up of components very similar to the AHEI-2010 (6)]
supplemented with mixed nuts (24) leads to reduced blood
pressure (25) and LDL cholesterol levels (26) and a reduction in
the incidence of type 2 diabetes (27) and cardiovascular disease
(28) compared with placebo; these are all associated with dimin-
ished physical function (7–9).
Our study has numerous strengths including the prospective
design with 18 y of follow-up, the multiple measures of diet and
physical function, the ability to control for multiple potential
confounders, and the large sample size. Potential limitations also
need to be considered. Residual confounding cannot be ruled
out in an observational study, and thus the results should be
interpreted with caution. However, associations between diet
quality and physical function remained strong and significant
after adjustment for a wide array of health and lifestyle factors.
Also, there is potential for measurement error in both the dietary
assessment and the outcome measurement. However, both
assessment instruments are validated, and cumulative averages
of diet were used to reduce measurement error of the exposure.
Additionally, dietary intake was collected prospectively, and
thus any misreporting of diet is expected to be random and
would result in bias to the null, suggesting that our results may
underestimate true associations.
In summary, we found that better diet quality as measured
by the AHEI-2010 was associated with a lower risk of incident
physical impairment among older women and that the overall
diet quality appeared more important than individual com-
ponents or foods. Given the value of physical function to
healthy aging and quality of life, this may represent a particu-
larly compelling public health rationale for persons to improve
their diet.
