Introduction
Phthalates are a class of high production 
volume industrial chemicals that are ubiqui-
tously used in commerce. High-molecular-
weight phthalates, such as di(2-ethylhexyl) 
phthalate (DEHP), are used as plasticizers 
to impart flexibility in polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) materials such as food packaging, 
flooring, and medical devices (U.S. EPA 
2012). In recent years, other phthalates, 
including diisononyl phthalate (DiNP), have 
been replacing DEHP in these applications 
due, in part, to legislation limiting the use 
of DEHP in certain applications (European 
Chemicals Agency 2012). Bisphenol A (BPA) 
is a high production volume chemical used to 
make polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, 
found in food and beverage cans as well as 
thermal receipt paper (Calafat et al. 2008).
Phthalates and BPA can leach, migrate, 
or off-gas from products over time and enter 
the human body via ingestion, inhalation, 
and dermal absorption. Once in the body, 
phthalates and BPA are quickly metabolized 
and excreted in urine, with elimination 
half-lives less than 24 hr (Johns et al. 2015; 
Vandenberg et al. 2007). Human exposure 
to these chemicals is widespread (CDC 
2013). Urinary metabolites of DEHP and 
DiNP are detected in 98% of the US general 
population (Zota et al. 2014) with higher 
exposures observed in children (Koch et al. 
2004; Wittassek et al. 2011). Urinary metab-
olites of BPA are detected in 90% of the U.S. 
population with higher exposures observed in 
non-Hispanic Blacks, children, females, and 
those of lower socioeconomic status (Calafat 
et al. 2008; Nelson et al. 2012).
Experimental animal studies demonstrate 
that DEHP and DiNP have endocrine-
disrupting properties because of their anti-
androgenic effects on the male reproductive 
system (National Research Council 2008). 
Human exposure to DEHP has been associ-
ated with adverse reproductive, neurobehav-
ioral, and respiratory outcomes in children 
(Braun et al. 2013; Ejaredar et al. 2015) and 
metabolic disease risk factors such as insulin 
resistance in adolescents and adults (James-
Todd et al. 2012; Attina and Trasande 2015). 
Though epidemiologic evidence of DiNP 
is less complete, recent studies report asso-
ciations between exposure and similar health 
outcomes including adverse respiratory and 
metabolic outcomes in children (Bertelsen 
et al. 2013; Attina and Trasande 2015). 
BPA is also a suspected endocrine disrupter, 
and experimental and human evidence 
suggest that BPA is a reproductive toxicant 
(Peretz et al. 2014). In addition, prenatal 
BPA exposure has also been associated with 
adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in children 
(Mustieles et al. 2015).
Given the concern over chemical toxicity, 
it is important to identify modifiable sources 
of exposure that may be targeted for exposure 
reduction strategies. Simulated exposure 
modeling, observational epidemiologic 
studies, and intervention studies all suggest 
that diet is an important exposure pathway 
for both high-molecular-weight phthalates 
and BPA (Carwile et al. 2011; Geens et al. 
2012; Rudel et al. 2011; Serrano et al. 2014; 
Trasande et al. 2013; Wormuth et al. 2006). 
For example, a recent review of dietary and 
non-dietary exposures to BPA concluded 
that food sources contributed to more than 
90% of overall BPA exposure among non-
occupationally exposed individuals (Geens 
et al. 2012), and a second study that examined 
five individuals in Bochum, Germany fasting 
for 48 hr found that diet was the most signifi-
cant source for DEHP and DiNP exposures 
as well (Koch et al. 2013). Food is likely 
contaminated with phthalates and BPA 
during processing (Cao 2010; Geens et al. 
2012). Phthalates have been shown to leach 
into food from PVC in materials like tubing 
used in the milking process, lid gaskets, food 
preparation gloves, conveyor belts and food 
packaging materials (Cao 2010; Serrano et al. 
2014). In fact, an intervention study reported

Background: Phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are widely used industrial chemicals that may 
adversely impact human health. Human exposure is ubiquitous and can occur through diet, 
including consumption of processed or packaged food.
oBjective: To examine associations between recent fast food intake and BPA and urinary metabo-
lites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (ΣDEHPm) and diisononyl phthalate (DiNPm) among the 
U.S. population.
Methods: We combined data on 8,877 participants from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES 2003–2010). Using 24-hr dietary recall data, we quantified: a) fast 
food intake [percent of total energy intake (TEI) from fast food]; b) fast food-derived fat intake 
(percent of TEI from fat in fast food); and c) fast food intake by food group (dairy, eggs, grains, 
meat, and other). We examined associations between dietary exposures and urinary chemical 
concentrations using multivariate linear regression.
results: We observed evidence of a positive, dose–response relationship between fast food intake 
and exposure to phthalates (p-trend < 0.0001) but not BPA; participants with high consump-
tion (≥ 34.9% TEI from fast food) had 23.8% (95% CI: 11.9%, 36.9%) and 39.0% (95% CI: 
21.9%, 58.5%) higher levels of ΣDEHPm and DiNPm, respectively, than nonconsumers. Fast 
food-derived fat intake was also positively associated with ΣDEHPm and DiNPm (p-trend 
< 0.0001). After adjusting for other food groups, ΣDEHPm was associated with grain and other 
intake, and DiNPm was associated with meat and grain intake.
conclusion: Fast food may be a source of exposure to DEHP and DiNP. These results, if 
confirmed, could inform individual and regulatory exposure reduction strategies.

that urinary BPA and DEHP were reduced 
by 66% and 53–56%, respectively, when 
participants’ diets were restricted to food with 
limited packaging (Rudel et al. 2011). Foods 
high in fat, such as dairy and meat, may be 
more contaminated by high-molecular-weight 
phthalates that are more lipophilic such as 
DEHP (Serrano et al. 2014).
Fast food may be an important source of 
exposure to phthalates and BPA because it is 
highly processed, packaged, and handled. A 
recent study of children 1–5 years old found 
that those who ate one or more fast food 
meals a week had greater DiNP and butyl-
benzyl phthalate exposures than did those 
who ate less than one meal a week (Watkins 
et al. 2014); however, that study was limited 
by the small age range of participants and 
the imprecise measure of fast food consump-
tion. In this study, we investigated the asso-
ciation between recent fast food consumption 
(derived from 24-hr dietary recall data) and 
exposure to high-molecular-weight phthal-
ates (DEHP and DiNP) and BPA in the U.S. 
population using data from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES). We focus on DEHP and DiNP 
because previous work shows that estimated 
dietary exposures to these phthalates are 
higher than other commonly studied phthal-
ates (Sakhi et al. 2014). We hypothesized that 
increased consumption of fast food will be 
associated with higher urinary levels of BPA 
and the metabolites of these two phthalates.
Methods
Study Population
We used data from the 2003–2004, 
2005–2006, 2007–2008, and 2009–2010 
cycles of NHANES, a nationally representa-
tive survey and physical examination of the 
civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. popula-
tion conducted by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC). The study 
sample included all participants ≥ 6 years old 
who completed a 24-hr dietary recall survey 
and provided a urine sample for phthalate 
or BPA analysis. The National Center for 
Health Statistics Research Ethics Review 
Board approved the study protocol. All 
participants gave informed consent; parents 
or guardians provided consent for participants 
< 18 years of age.
There were 10,506 participants with 
urinary measurements of phthalate metabo-
lites and creatinine. We sequentially excluded 
participants who did not self-identify as 
non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, 
or Mexican American/Hispanic (n = 495); 
who were missing information on household 
income (n = 702); who were missing informa-
tion on body mass index (BMI; n = 89); or 
who were missing kilocalorie data (n = 343) 
resulting in a final sample size of 8,877 study 
participants for the DEHP analyses. The final 
sample size for the DiNP analyses was 6,629 
because the DiNP oxidative metabolite, 
monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP), was 
not measured in 2003–2004. Most chemical 
analytes are measured in approximately one-
third of the overall NHANES population, 
and phthalate metabolites and BPA were 
measured in different subpopulations. There 
were 10,418 participants with urinary BPA 
measurements. Using our sequential exclusion 
criteria, we removed 1,626 participants and 
an additional 3 participants who were missing 
creatinine measures. The final sample size for 
BPA analyses was 8,789 study participants.
Urinary Chemical Analysis
Phthalate metabolites and total BPA (free 
plus conjugated species) were measured 
in spot urine samples collected during the 
in-person exam at the Mobile Examination 
Center (MEC) and stored at –20°C until they 
were shipped to the CDC’s National Center 
for Environmental Health (Atlanta, GA) 
for analysis. Analytical methods have been 
described in detail elsewhere (CDC 2013). 
Briefly, chemical analytes were quantified in 
urine using solid-phase extraction coupled 
online with high-performance liquid chro-
matography and tandem mass spectrometry 
and expressed as wet weights (ng/mL). The 
limits of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.2 
to 1.2 ng/mL for the phthalate metabolites 
and varied across study cycles. Therefore, 
we assumed the maximal LOD for each 
phthalate metabolite in our analysis to facili-
tate aggregation of data across study cycles 
(Zota et al. 2014). The LOD for BPA was 
0.4 ng/mL for all study cycles. For both 
phthalates and BPA, concentrations below 
the LOD were substituted with the LOD 
divided by the square root of two. All analytes 
were detected in more than 90% of the study 
population except for mono(2-ethylhexyl) 
phthalate (MEHP; 64% > LOD).
To approximate DEHP exposure, we 
calculated a summary metric (ΣDEHPm) 
equal to the molar sum of four DEHP 
metabolites: MEHP, mono(2-ethyl-5-
hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-
ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and 
mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate 
(MECPP) using an approach previously 
described in Zota et al. (2014). DiNP 
exposure was characterized by its oxidative 
metabolite MCOP (referred to as DiNPm 
throughout the manuscript).
Dietary Assessment
The primary 24-hr dietary recall interview 
was administered in person at the MEC by 
dietary interviewers. Detailed protocols are 
described elsewhere and are briefly summarized 
here (CDC 2002). Survey participants 
≥ 12 years old completed the dietary interview 
on their own, and proxy-assisted interviews 
were conducted with children 6–11 years 
old. During the interview, participants were 
prompted to report an uninterrupted listing of 
all foods and beverages consumed in a 24-hr 
period the day before the interview (midnight 
to midnight). This information was used 
to estimate the types and amounts of foods 
and beverages consumed as well as intakes of 
energy, nutrients, and other food components 
from those foods and beverages. Analysts at the 
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
in partnership with the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture’s (USDA) Food Surveys Research 
Group processed the intake data using the 
USDA’s Food and Nutrient Database for 
Dietary Studies (CDC 2002, 2007). Their 
output included publicly available datasets that 
summarize total nutrients for each participant 
as well as individual food profiles.
The dietary recall interview also asked 
about the source of each food item. Fast food 
was defined as food obtained from restau-
rants without waiter/waitress service, or 
from pizza restaurants regardless of waiter/
waitress service. All carryout and delivery food 
was also considered fast food. Foods from 
all other sources, including restaurants with 
waiters/waitresses, bars, taverns, lounges, 
vending machines, and mail or packaged 
foods, were not considered fast food (CDC 
2007). For this analysis, we extracted 24-hr 
intake of kilocalories and grams of fat, in total 
and from fast food specifically, by participant. 
We also extracted kilocalories of fast food by 
the following food groups as designated by 
the USDA: dairy, eggs, grains, meat, other 
(examples of fast food items in each food 
group are provided in Table 1).
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted in SAS (version 
9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Because 
we combined four survey cycles, we calcu-
lated new sample weights for each participant 
according to the NCHS analytical guidelines 
(CDC 2002). The degrees of freedom for our 
study sample were calculated by subtracting 
the number of clusters in the first level of 
sampling (strata) from the number of clusters in 
the second level of sampling (PSUs) (National 
Center for Health Statistics 2006). Based on 
our degrees of freedom, we used the following 
critical values from the t distribution for the 
calculation of all confidence intervals (CIs): 
DEHPm (1.99); DiNPm (2.01); and BPA 
(1.99). All analyses were adjusted for the non-
random sampling design and the sample popu-
lation weights. A (two-sided) p-value < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
Consumption of fast food was modeled 
several ways. First, we compared those who ate

any fast food to those who did not. Second, 
we calculated fast food intake as the percent 
of total energy intake (TEI) from fast food 
in the 24-hr period. Third, we calculated fast 
food-derived fat intake as the percent of TEI 
from kilocalories of fat in fast food in the 
24-hr period. Intake of fast food and fast food-
derived fat were modeled as the following 
three categories: none, low, and high; where 
the low and high categories are divided at the 
weighted median of the exposed population. 
As a sensitivity analysis, we separately adjusted 
our final fast food intake models for intake 
from vending machines and from restaurants 
(percent of TEI; modeled as none, low, high) 
to account for other potential sources of 
packaged and processed food.
We additionally examined fast food 
intake by the five USDA food groups. First, 
we examined each food group separately, 
dividing the percent of TEI from fast food for 
each food group into three categories (none, 
low, high). Second, to account for potential 
confounding by non-fast food sources, we 
adjusted each food group by its non-fast food 
counterpart (e.g., percent of TEI from fast 
food meat was adjusted for percent of TEI 
from non-fast food meat). Percent of TEI 
from non-fast food sources were also modeled 
as three categories (none, low, high). Third, to 
account for potential confounding by other 
food groups, we included all five of the fast 
food groups in the same model.
We used multivariate linear regression 
models to examine the association between 
fast food consumption and urinary chemical 
concentrations. We performed natural log-
transformation of chemical concentration 
data prior to regression analysis to improve 
normality and stabilize the variance. All regres-
sion models included natural log–transformed 
urinary creatinine [a marker of urine dilution 
(Barr et al. 2005)] and the following demo-
graphic variables: age (continuous); sex, race/
ethnicity [non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic 
black, or Hispanic (including Mexican 
American)], BMI [underweight (< 18.5), 
normal (18.5–24.99), overweight (25–29.99) 
and obese (> 30)], poverty:income ratio (PIR; 
the ratio of household income to poverty 
threshold adjusted to family size and inflation; 
[< 1 (i.e., beneath the poverty threshold), 1–3, 
and > 3], and NHANES survey cycle (2003–
2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010).
From these regression models, we esti-
mated: a) percent difference in urinary 
chemical concentrations by fast food 
consumption as (e(β) – 1) × 100% with 95% 
CIs estimated as (e(β ± critical value × SE) – 1), 
where β and SE are the estimated regres-
sion coefficient and standard error, respec-
tively; and b) least squares geometric means 
of urinary chemical concentrations by fast 
food consumption as e(least squares means) with 
95% CIs as e(least squares mean ± critical value × SE), 
where the least square means is the mean 
of urinary chemical concentrations by fast 
food intake after adjustment for covariates. 
When exposure was modeled as three catego-
ries, percent differences were estimated by 
comparing each of the upper two groups 
to the lowest group. Additionally, a test for 
trend was performed by modeling the integer 
value of each exposure category (i.e., 0, 1, 2) 
as an ordinal term, and using its p-value as a 
test of departure from the null hypothesis of 
no linear trend. We tested for potential effect 
modification by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 
household income by including multiplicative 
interaction terms in the statistical models. To 
further assess whether our results were specific 
to fast food, we also examined associations of 
TEI (tertile categories: low, medium, high) 
and total fat intake (percent of TEI; tertile 
categories: low, medium, high) with urinary 
chemical concentrations.
Results
Approximately one-third of the 8,877 partici-
pants reported consuming fast food on the 
day prior to their urine sample collection. 
Participants who ate fast food were more 
likely to be < 40 years old, male, and non-
Hispanic black and to have higher TEI and 
total fat intake. Fast food consumers had 
higher levels of ΣDEHPm, DiNPm, and BPA 
than did nonconsumers. This difference was 
statistically significant for phthalates but not 
for BPA (Table 2).
We observed evidence of a positive, 
dose–response association between fast 
food intake and ΣDEHPm (p for trend 
< 0.0001) (Table 3). Compared to noncon-
sumers, low consumers had 15.5% (95% CI: 
6.3%, 25.6%) and high consumers had 
23.8% (95% CI: 11.9%, 36.9%) higher levels 
of ΣDEHPm, respectively. Fast food-derived 
fat intake was also significantly associated with 
ΣDEHPm (p for trend < 0.0001) but smaller 
in magnitude than the association with fast 
food intake. For example, high consumers of 
fast food-derived fat had 18.9% (95% CI: 
8.9%, 29.9%) higher levels of ΣDEHPm 
compared to nonconsumers. Furthermore, 
total fat intake (of all foods) but not TEI 
was associated with ΣDEHPm. Consumers 
in the highest tertile had 17.3% (95% CI: 
9.2%, 26.0%) higher levels of ΣDEHPm, 
respectively, than consumers in the lowest 
tertile (Table 3).
Similar to ΣDEHPm, there was evidence 
of a positive dose–response association 
between fast food intake and DiNPm (p for 
trend < 0.0001) (Table 3). Compared to 
nonconsumers, low consumers had 24.8% 
(95% CI: 12.9%, 37.9%) and high consumers 
had 39.0% (95% CI: 21.9%, 58.5%) higher 
levels of DiNP, respectively. The association 
with fast food-derived fat intake and DiNPm 
was smaller in magnitude than the asso-
ciation with fast food intake. Furthermore, 
total fat intake but not TEI was associated 
with DiNPm; however, this association was 
not monotonic and only the middle tertile 
estimate was significant (Table 3).
In sensitivity analyses, adjustment for 
restaurant intake increased the associations 
between fast food intake and ΣDEHPm 
and DiNP by 10% to 20% (see Table S1) 
while there was virtually no change in the 
main effects after adjustment for vending 
machine intake.
Next we calculated the association 
between fast food intake specific to each 
USDA food group with ΣDEHPm. All food 
groups were frequently consumed except 
for eggs, which were consumed in fast food 
meals by only 2% of the population. When 
each food group was modeled individually, 
we observed significant associations for all 
food groups except for eggs, although none 
of the associations were monotonic (Table 4; 
Model 1). These associations were virtually 
unchanged when each food group model 
was further adjusted for intake of non-fast 
food sources from the same food group 
(Table 4; Model 2). However, when all the 
food groups were examined together in the 
Table 1. Common fast food items classified by their USDA-designated food groups.

same model, only the individual categories 
of high grain and low other intake remained 
significant. Furthermore, the association 
between grain intake and ΣDEHPm became 
monotonic with a significant test for trend 
(p for trend = 0.01) (Table 4, Model 3).
Similar to ΣDEHPm, we observed signifi-
cant associations between DiNPm and all 
food groups except for eggs when each group 
was modeled individually (Table 5, Model 1). 
When each food group was further adjusted 
for intake of non-fast food sources from the 
same food group, associations were virtu-
ally unchanged (Table 5, Model 2). When 
all the food groups were examined together 
in the same model, we observed significant, 
monotonic associations for grain and meat 
intake (p for trend < 0.05). Those with high 
fast food grain and meat consumption had 
21.9% (95% CI: 9.4%, 35.8%) and 20.1% 
(95% CI: 3.0%, 40.1%) higher levels of 
DiNPm, respectively, than did nonconsumers 
of those fast food groups (Table 5, Model 3).
There was a monotonic, dose–response 
association between fast food meat and BPA 
in all three models (p for trend ≤ 0.01) (see 
Table S2). When all the food groups were 
examined together in the same model (see 
Table S2, Model 3), those with high fast 
food meat intake had 11.9% (95% CI: 
2.0%, 22.7%) higher levels of BPA, respec-
tively, than did nonconsumers of fast food 
meat. Low egg intake was significantly associ-
ated with BPA in all three models although 
the estimates for high egg intake were near 
the null and the linear test for trend was not 
significant. Lastly, the highest tertile for grain 
intake was negatively associated with BPA 
across all three models.
Tests for interaction by sex and house-
hold income were not significant. Tests for 
inter 
action by age were not significant for 
ΣDEHPm or BPA, but were significant for 
DiNPm (pinteraction < 0.05) (Figure 1; see also 
Table S3). Exposure to DiNPm was not associ-
ated with fast food intake in children, but was 
positively associated with fast food intake in 
adolescents and adults. Tests for interaction by 
race/ethnicity were not significant for DiNPm 
or BPA, but were significant for ΣDEHPm 
(pinteraction < 0.05) (Figure 1; see also Table S4). 
Exposure to ΣDEHPm was positively associ-
ated with fast food intake in all three racial/
ethnic groups; however, the association 
did not reach statistical significance among 
Hispanics. Moreover, the highest tertile 
estimate for fast food intake was greater in 
magnitude for non-Hispanic blacks compared 
to non-Hispanic whites or Hispanics.
Discussion
In this cross-sectional study of the U.S. popu-
lation, we found a consistent, positive asso-
ciation between recent fast food consumption 
and phthalates exposure. Furthermore, there 
was evidence of a monotonic, positive dose–
response; participants with high fast food intake 
had 20–40% higher urinary concentrations of 
phthalate metabolites than did nonconsumers. 
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to 
date on fast food consumption and biomarkers 
of environmental chemical exposure and the 
first to use a population-based sample.
We did not find an association between 
total fast food consumption and BPA. Our 
null finding may, in part, be explained by the 
fact that the intake of BPA from non-canned 
foods is likely minimal compared to BPA from 
canned foods and nondietary sources (e.g., 
contact with thermal receipts) (Geens et al. 
2012). We did find a significant, monotonic 
association between fast food meat intake 
and BPA, which corresponds to the small but 
growing evidence suggesting that hamburgers 
may be a source of BPA exposure. In a 2008 
total diet study in Quebec, Canada, levels 
of BPA in fast food composite samples were 
generally low (1–3 ng/g) except for in the 
hamburger (10.9 ng/g) (Cao et al. 2011). In 
a study of 491 Mexican-American pregnant 
women, those who consumed hamburgers 
three or more times a week had 20% higher 
urinary BPA levels than did nonconsumers of 
hamburgers (Quirós-Alcalá et al. 2013).
While fast food consumption was associ-
ated with exposure to both phthalates, our 
results highlight some important differences 
between DEHP and DiNP. The magnitude 
of the associations was 40–50% higher for 
DiNP than for DEHP. Moreover, associa-
tions for fast food-derived fat and DiNP were 
more pronounced than associations for TEI or 
total fat intake and DiNP suggesting DiNP 
contamination sources may be specific to fast 
food. In contrast, the magnitude of the asso-
ciation for highest intake of fast food-derived 
fat and total fat were similar for DEHP 
suggesting that some DEHP contamination 
sources may be common to all high fat foods. 
While many of the studies on dietary intake

of phthalates do not include DiNP (Cirillo 
et al. 2011; Colacino et al. 2010; Schecter 
et al. 2013; Trasande et al. 2013), our 
results are consistent with a recent study of 
296 children from Ohio ages 1–5 years that 
reported positive associations between fast 
food consumption and urinary metabolites of 
DiNP but not DEHP (Watkins et al. 2014). 
Additionally, a recent study of 10 phthalates 
in Norwegian food items found that DiNP 
was the most detected phthalate, and that 
estimated dietary exposures were also highest 
for DiNP (Sakhi et al. 2014). Our results 
show an interesting parallel with the changing 
trends in U.S. phthalate exposure as measured 
in biomonitoring data; between 2001 and 
2010, ∑DEHP metabolites decreased by 37% 
and MCOP (DiNP metabolite) increased by 
149% (Zota et al. 2014). Collectively, this 
work suggests that DiNP may be replacing 
DEHP in food contact materials. Future 
studies should further examine the human 
health effects associated with DiNP exposure 
and its potential synergy with other phthalates 
such as DEHP.
Our analysis of fast food consumption by 
food groups found that intake of grain items

was significantly associated with DiNP and 
DEHP with evidence of a monotonic, positive 
dose response. Meat intake was also associated 
with DiNP and DEHP, but the association 
with DEHP did not remain significant after 
adjusting for other food groups. Many food 
monitoring studies report higher phthalate 
residues in high fat foods, including oils, 
meat, and dairy (Cao 2010; Serrano et al. 
2014). In line with these data, some epide-
miological studies show positive associations 
between consumption of meats, fats, and dairy 
products and DEHP (Serrano et al. 2014). 
The robust association between fast food 
grain items and both phthalates in our study 
may, in part, be a result of the way the food 
items were classified. The grains category was 
heterogeneous and included a wide variety 
of items (Table 1) such as bread, cake, pizza, 
burritos, rice dishes, and noodles. Similar to 
our results, however, the recent Norwegian 
food monitoring study also identified grains 
to be the largest contributor to estimated daily 
intake of DEHP and DiNP, suggesting that 
grains consumption may be a true source of 
exposures (Sakhi et al. 2014). For example, 
since grain products are found on the exterior 
of foods such as pizza or burritos, they may 
be in greater contact with packaging mate-
rials. Future research should further investi-
gate phthalate content in specific fast food 
menu items or by fast food chains to further 
 
characterize dietary exposures to phthalates.
Our findings also suggest that associa-
tions between fast food intake and phthalate 
exposure are not uniform across the population. 
The association between DiNP and fast food 
was observed in adolescents and adults, but not 
in children 6–11 years old, potentially reflecting 
differences in exposure sources or behavior 
between groups. Furthermore, the association 
between fast food intake and DEHP exposure 
was more pronounced in blacks than in 
Hispanics, which may be linked to the higher 
consumption of fast food calories among blacks 
(see Table S4), or to differences in the types 
of fast food meals consumed between racial/
ethnic groups. Future research could expand 
on these findings by examining how the contri-
bution of dietary and non-dietary sources to 
phthalates exposures varies by race/ethnicity or 
socioeconomic status.
The complexity and variability of fast 
food production makes it difficult to identify 
the sources of high-molecular-weight phthal-
ates, though some likely sources have been 
suggested, including PVC gloves, PVC 
tubing, and plastic packaging. Food moni-
toring and duplicate diet studies conducted 
in Japan found that use of disposable PVC 
gloves during the preparation and packaging

of meals was a major source of dietary intake 
of DEHP and that sterilizing the gloves with 
alcohol increased DEHP migration (Tsumura 
et al. 2001a, 2001b). The same study team 
also demonstrated a decline in DEHP levels 
in prepared meals after the ban of DEHP in 
PVC gloves in Japan (Tsumura et al. 2003). 
PVC tubing and plastic packaging may play 
a role since many of the food items available 
at fast food restaurants are prepared in bulk 
quantities at central supply facilities and then 
shipped to individual restaurants where they 
are cooked, reheated, or assembled (Schlosser 
2012). For example, an Italian study that 
compared levels of DEHP and di-n-butyl 
phthalate in school meals before and after 
the food was packaged found that packaging 
increased phthalate concentrations by more 
than 100% (Cirillo et al. 2011). Future 
research should further characterize the role of 
food production, processing, and handling in 
dietary phthalate exposure.
One main study limitation is the cross-
sectional design of NHANES; thus, we cannot 
infer a causal relationship between fast food 
consumption and urinary phthalate metabo-
lites. Future research should confirm our 
findings using a longitudinal study design that 
includes assessment of phthalates exposure in 
individuals before and after the consumption 
of fast foods. Other study limitations included 
the reliance on a single spot urine sample. 
While multiple urine samples or a 24-hr total 
urine sample is ideal, the collection of a single 
spot urine within 24 hr of the reported dietary 
consumption corresponds well with the short 
elimination half-lives of phthalates and BPA. 
We also relied on self-reported dietary data, 
which may have been prone to errors in 
reporting. However, the measurement error 
arising from both the urine sample collection 
and dietary recall is likely nondifferential. 
Lastly, the fast food category encompassed a 
wide variety of food items and establishments, 
which makes it difficult to isolate specific 
types of food production or menu items that 
may be underlying the observed associations. 
However, there are also advantages to use of 
NHANES dietary data. The dietary interview 
used a specific definition of fast food that 
eliminates subjectivity by the participant, and 
the broad array of food choices included in the 
fast food category increases the generalizability 
of our results.
There are several notable strengths to 
our study. To our knowledge, this is the first 
study to use NHANES dietary recall data to 
examine the association between fast food 
consumption and urinary measures of envi-
ronmental chemicals in the U.S. population. 
This study design allowed us to evaluate the 
associations among a large, representative 
sample of the U.S. population that included 
children. Moreover, we were able to quantify 
population-level consumption of fast food 
using information on energy and nutrients. 
Finally, our findings were robust to sensi-
tivity analyses including adjustment for other 
potential sources of processed or packaged 
food as well as several different categorizations 
of fast food intake.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our findings suggest that 
fast food consumption may be a source of 
exposure to DEHP and DiNP, but not BPA, 
among the general population. These results, if 
confirmed in future longitudinal studies, may 
have great public health significance given 
the recommendations by various scientific 
and governmental bodies to limit exposure 
to phthalates due to concern over poten-
tial adverse health effects (Chronic Hazard 
Advisory Panel on Phthalates and Phthalate 
Alternatives 2014; U.S. EPA 2012). Despite 
public health interest in reducing exposures, 
few modifiable sources have been identified. 
Therefore, our results may represent an impor-
tant step forward in individual and regulatory 
phthalate exposure reduction strategies while 
population health effects remain under study.
