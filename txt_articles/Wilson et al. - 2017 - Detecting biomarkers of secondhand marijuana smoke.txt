Background: The impact of secondhand marijuana smoke 
exposure on children is unknown. New methods allow detec-
tion of secondhand marijuana smoke in children.
Methods: We studied children ages 1 mo to 2 y hospital-
ized with bronchiolitis in Colorado from 2013 to 2015. Parents 
completed a survey, and urine samples were analyzed for coti-
nine using LC/MS/MS (limits of detection 0.03 ng/ml) and mar-
ijuana metabolites including COOH-THC (limits of detection 
 
0.015 ng/ml).
results: A total of 43 subjects had urine samples available 
for analysis. Most (77%) of the subjects were male, and 52% 
were less than 1 y of age. COOH-THC was detectable in 16% of 
the samples analyzed (THC+); the range in COOH-THC concen-
tration was 0.03–1.5 ng/ml. Two subjects had levels >1 ng/ml. 
Exposure did not differ by gender or age. Non-white children 
had more exposure than white children (44 vs. 9%; P < 0.05). 
56% of children with cotinine >2.0 ng/ml were THC+, com-
pared with 7% of those with lower cotinine (P < 0.01).
conclusion: Metabolites of marijuana smoke can be 
detected in children; in this cohort, 16% were exposed. 
Detectable COOH-THC is more common in children with 
tobacco smoke exposure. More research is needed to assess 
the health impacts of marijuana smoke exposure on children 
and inform public health policy.
t
he use of marijuana has been increasing in both accept-
ability and legality in the past 15 y. Currently 23 states plus 
Guam allow the legal use of marijuana for medical reasons, and 
4 states plus Washington, DC have legalized recreational use. 
In 2013, 5.7 million persons aged 12 or older used marijuana 
on a daily or almost daily basis in the previous 12 mo; this rep-
resents an increase from the 3.1 million daily or almost daily 
users in 2006 (1). While marijuana can also be aerosolized, or 
ingested as hash oil or leaf, combusted marijuana is still the 
most common form of consumption (2). A recent analysis of 
data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) finds that daily marijuana users have higher 
levels of combustion biomarkers (e.g., volatile organic com-
pounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) than nonusers 
(3). Exposure to combustion products likely extends to adja-
cent nonusers, as has been shown for tobacco smoke (4). Most 
states with legal marijuana use do not have any restrictions on 
combustible marijuana use in the presence of children.
While there is clear research on the dangers of secondhand 
tobacco smoke (4), the impact of secondhand marijuana 
smoke on children has not yet been studied. There are several 
studies suggesting that marijuana smoke contains particu-
late matter known to be harmful when inhaled, in addition 
to other toxic and carcinogenic chemicals, such as volatile 
organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 
aromatic amines (5,6). A recent study in rats found that brief 
exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke impaired endothe-
lial function (7). Studies in adults have demonstrated that it 
is possible to feel the effects of marijuana smoke from intense 
secondhand marijuana smoke exposure (8). Children could 
be exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke when parents or 
other household contacts smoke marijuana indoors, similar to 
the way children who live with tobacco smokers are exposed to 
secondhand tobacco smoke (9). Since the co-use of marijuana 
and tobacco is high (10), there is a significant possibility that 
children are being exposed to both substances.
Marijuana contains two primary active components: ∆9-tet-
rahydrocannabinol (THC), and cannabidiol (CBD) (10). THC 
is the primary psychoactive chemical in marijuana;CBD is 
nonpsychoactive, but has other demonstrated effects (11). 
Currently available analytical methods are not sensitive enough 
to detect exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke. This is suf-
ficient when testing for active marijuana use. However, in the 
case of secondhand marijuana smoke, the levels of these chem-
icals in urine are usually too low to be detected. The Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention has recently developed a 
new high sensitivity assay to monitor trace levels of marijuana 
biomarkers at levels that might be seen in secondhand mari-
juana smoke exposure, allowing us to more accurately assess 
whether children have been exposed (12). The objectives of

this study were to (i) document the presence of metabolites of 
secondhand marijuana smoke exposure in children admitted 
to a hospital in Colorado for treatment of bronchiolitis, and 
(ii) to examine the association between secondhand marijuana 
and tobacco smoke exposure in this population.
METHODS
This study was a secondary analysis of urine samples and question-
naire data collected for a study examining the impact of secondhand 
tobacco smoke exposure on children hospitalized for bronchiolitis.
Participants/Procedures
We recruited previously healthy children ages 1 mo to 2 y who were 
admitted to Children’s Hospital Colorado with a diagnosis of bronchi-
olitis from 2013 to 2015; Recreational marijuana use became legal in 
Colorado on 1 January 2014. We obtained urine samples from the child 
within 24 h of admission; these were placed in a −80 °C freezer. Families 
were given a $25 gift card for participation. For this secondary analysis, 
only samples from children whose parents consented for future research 
were used, and the data and samples were anonymized prior to analysis. 
At the time of the secondary analysis, samples were shipped on dry ice 
to the laboratory at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The initial study and secondary analysis were both approved by the 
Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board; since families had con-
sented for future research we did not need to reconsent.
Measures
After completing informed consent, parents had completed a ques-
tionnaire about their child’s health, and demographics. Since birth-
dates were removed from the secondary dataset to ensure anonymity, 
we obtained patient age from the family census. Parent report of 
tobacco smoke exposure was assessed with the question: “Does any-
one who lives in your home or who cares for your child smoke tobacco 
(yes or no)?” Parent report of marijuana smoke exposure was assessed 
after October 2014 with the question “Does anyone who lives in your 
home or who cares for your child smoke marijuana (yes or no)”
.
Analysis of Urinary Marijuana Biomarkers
Analysis for marijuana biomarkers was performed using the method 
by Wei et al.(12) Urine samples were equilibrated with isotopically 
labeled internal standards, deconjugated by enzymatic and alkaline 
hydrolysis, and extracted using C18 sorbent. The final extracts were 
concentrated and 10 μl of each sample was injected into an ultrahigh 
performance liquid chromatograph and analyzed using tandem mass 
spectrometry under electrospray ionization mode (ESI-MS/MS). This 
method has limits of detection of 0.005, 0.015, and 0.009 ng/ml for 
the three metabolites tested: total urinary THC, COOH-THC, and 
CBD, respectively.
Analysis of Urinary Tobacco Biomarkers
Urinary cotinine (COT) was analyzed using a modification of the 
method developed by Bernert et al.(13) After adding isotopically 
labeled internal standards to 200 µl of urine, the samples were hydro-
lyzed with β-glucuronidase, purified using supported liquid extrac-
tion, concentrated, and then taken up in 100 µl water. A 5 µl aliquot of 
this solution was injected into a ultrahigh performance liquid chro-
matograph and analyzed using atmospheric pressure chemical ioniza-
tion tandem mass spectrometry. The limits of detection for COT was 
0.030 ng/ml. We used a cutoff of 2.0 ng/ml to identify children with 
likely household contact exposure, based on Matt et al.(8) Laboratory 
blank and quality control samples were simultaneously processed and 
analyzed to assure the quality of the analytical results (14).
Data Analysis
Chi square tests were done to assess bivariable differences, and all 
analyses were done using SAS, (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For 10 sub-
jects (23%), there was more than one family member under 2, making 
identification of the subjects’ exact age difficult, so we performed two 
sensitivity analyses in which we assumed all of the missing partici-
pants were (i) in the younger age group and (ii) in the older age group; 
our results did not change significantly.
RESULTS
Of 180 eligible inpatients in the original study, we enrolled 99 
(55%); 86 were able to provide a urine sample. Of these, 43 
agreed to the use of the urine for future research and had suf-
ficient sample remained for the current analyses. Most (77%) 
were male and 52% were less than 1 y of age (Table 1). Patients 
were predominantly white (79%); 47% were of Hispanic eth-
nicity. All were residents of the state of Colorado, and 28% lived 
in multiunit housing. Of those who were screened for con-
tact with marijuana or tobacco users (N = 25), 16% reported 
marijuana use in the home or by a caregiver and 28% reported 
tobacco use (Table 2). Total urine THC and CBD in all urine 
samples were below the detection limit; the THC metabolite 
11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (COOH-THC) was detected in urine 
from 16% of patients. The range in COOH-THC concentra-
tion was 0.03–1.5 ng/ml, with two patients having levels > 1 ng/
ml. Almost one quarter (23%) had urine cotinine levels above 
2.0 ng/ml, suggesting household contact exposure.
There was no difference in COOH-THC detection by gen-
der, age, or living in multiunit housing (Table 1). Non-white 
children were more likely to have detectable COOH-THC 
(44%) compared to white children (9%; P = 0.026); there were 
no differences by ethnicity. Of those who reported contact 
with marijuana users, 75% had detectable COOH-THC, com-
pared to 10% of those who reported no exposure (P < 0.016).

Secondhand marijuana smoke and children         Articles
Urinary COOH-THC and cotinine were also positively asso-
ciated; of those with a urine cotinine of >2.0 ng/ml, 56% had 
detectable COOH-THC, compared to 7% of those with lower 
tobacco smoke exposure (P < 0.004). While the prevalence of 
detectable COOH-THC was higher after legalization (21 vs. 
10% prior), this difference was not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of THC 
metabolites in children exposed to marijuana smoke. While 
documenting the presence of metabolites of THC in children 
does not imply causation of disease, it does suggest that, like 
tobacco smoke, marijuana smoke is inhaled by children in the 
presence of adults who are using it. High sensitivity testing 
will give us the opportunity to study the effects of secondhand 
marijuana smoke on children’s health more effectively, and 
researchers and funders should prioritize these investigations. 
National surveys such as NHANES offer opportunities to track 
trends in secondhand marijuana smoke exposure, as they do 
for secondhand tobacco smoke. In the interim, parents should 
be cautioned not to smoke marijuana in the presence of their 
children.
In our study, there was a relationship between detectable 
COOH-THC and having a urinary cotinine level >2.0 ng/ml, 
indicating that children exposed to marijuana smoke were also 
more likely to be exposed to tobacco smoke, which increases 
their risk for cognitive deficits (15) and respiratory illness (4). 
More study is warranted to investigate if marijuana smoke 
exposure adds additional risk. This research will help inform 
appropriate educational materials and outreach to parents and 
caregivers who use both marijuana and tobacco in the pres-
ence of their children.
Parent report of marijuana exposure was strongly associ-
ated with detection of urinary COOH-THC. While we had 
initially suspected that social desirability bias would lead to 
underreporting of exposure, this finding suggests that a par-
ent report screening question would be useful for institutions 
in areas where marijuana is legal. Parents who report house-
hold marijuana smoking could then be counseled on safe use 
around children. It is still possible that the screening ques-
tion is underestimating use, and further research is needed to 
understand whether the marijuana use is taking place in the 
presence of the child, or whether the exposure could represent 
third-hand exposure.
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. As we were working 
with limited samples remaining from a prior study, we have a 
very small sample size. We had insufficient power to be able to 
determine additional associations, such as with illness severity, 
or to complete more quantitative associations, and thus it has 
limited external validity. Since this was a secondary analysis on 
previously collected samples, we were unable to assess addi-
tional demographic, socioeconomic status, and other factors 
that may have been associated with marijuana use. Since we 
could only analyze the samples from those with consent for 
future research, it is possible that there was bias towards non-
marijuana using families in the sub-sample, and thus the true 
proportion of exposed children could be higher. We did not 
assess for medical use of marijuana in these children specifi-
cally, but since we enrolled only previously healthy children, 
medicinal marijuana use would be highly unlikely. We are also 
unable to assess whether the exposure was from secondhand 
marijuana smoke vs. neonatal transmission or breastfeeding; 
however the fact that our exposure rate was similar in the <1-
y-old age group as the 1–2-y-old age group would suggest that 
the detectable COOH-THC is more likely from the second-
hand smoke. Finally, this is a sample of children hospitalized 
for bronchiolitis in Colorado, and the findings may not be gen-
eralizable to other populations.
Conclusion
Marijuana metabolites are detectable in young children with 
exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke. These children are 
exposed to the psychoactive compounds in marijuana, and are 
potentially at risk for negative health effects. More than half 
of children with tobacco smoke exposure were also exposed 
to marijuana. Understanding the health consequences of
