IMPORTANCE Despite cross-sectional evidence linking racial residential segregation to
hypertension prevalence among non-Hispanic blacks, it remains unclear how changes in
exposure to neighborhood segregation may be associated with changes in blood pressure.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of changes in neighborhood-level racial residential
segregation with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure over a 25-year period.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational study examined longitudinal data of
2280 black participants of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)
study, a prospective investigation of adults aged 18 to 30 years who underwent baseline
examinations in field centers in 4 US locations from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986, and then
were re-examined for the next 25 years. Racial residential segregation was assessed using the
Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, a measure of SD between the neighborhood’
s racial composition
(ie, percentage of black residents) and the surrounding area’
s racial composition. Segregation
was categorized as high (Gi* >1.96), medium (Gi* 0-1.96), and low (Gi* <0). Fixed-effects linear
regression modeling was used to estimate the associations of within-person change in
exposure to segregation and within-person change in blood pressure while tightly controlling
for time-invariant confounders. Data analyses were performed between August 4, 2016, and
February 9, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Within-person changes in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure across 6 examinations over 25 years.
RESULTS Of the 2280 participants at baseline, 974 (42.7%) were men and 1306 (57.3%) were
women. Of these, 1861 (81.6%) were living in a high-segregation neighborhood; 278 (12.2%),
a medium-segregation neighborhood; and 141 (6.2%), a low-segregation neighborhood.
Systolic blood pressure increased by a mean of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06-0.26) mm Hg with each
1-SD increase in segregation score after adjusting for interactions of time with age, sex, and
field center. Of the 1861 participants (81.6%) who lived in high-segregation neighborhoods at
baseline, reductions in exposure to segregation were associated with reductions in systolic
blood pressure. Mean differences in systolic blood pressure were −1.33 (95% CI, −2.26 to
−0.40) mm Hg when comparing high-segregation with medium-segregation neighborhoods
and −1.19 (95% CI, −2.08 to −0.31) mm Hg when comparing high-segregation with
low-segregation neighborhoods after adjustment for time and interactions of time with
baseline age, sex, and field center. Changes in segregation were not associated with changes
in diastolic blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Decreases in exposure to racial residential segregation are
associated with reductions in systolic blood pressure. This study adds to the small but
growing body of evidence that policies that reduce segregation may have meaningful
health benefits.

acial residential segregation is the systematic separa-
tion of groups into different neighborhoods by race.
While largely thought to be caused by structural dis-
crimination (eg, in housing and lending markets), differential
residential preferences by race are believed to play a role as
well.1,2 Residential segregation has been identified as a fun-
damental cause of black-white health disparities because of its
effect on access to a wide range of health-promoting re-
sources and opportunities, including quality education,
jobs, healthy food options, and social capital.3-6 Some cross-
sectional evidence suggests that the greater the seg-
regation, the higher the hypertension prevalence in black
communities.7-9 To our knowledge, no study has yet investi-
gated the association of changes in exposure to segregation
with changes in blood pressure or the association of moving
to less segregated neighborhoods with improvements in blood
pressure. Longitudinal analyses are required to strengthen
these causal inferences and to determine whether policies that
reduce segregation have beneficial effects on blood pressure.
First, using more than 25 years of data, we examined the
association between change in neighborhood-level racial resi-
dential segregation and change in blood pressure in the total
sample of non-Hispanic black participants of the Coronary Ar-
tery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Sec-
ond, to better understand the effect of reducing segregation
on blood pressure, we investigated the association of reduc-
tioninsegregationwithreductioninsystolicanddiastolicblood
pressure among the subset of black CARDIA participants liv-
ing in highly segregated neighborhoods at baseline.
Methods
The CARDIA study is a prospective, multicenter investigation
of changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors, onset, and
progression during the transition from young adulthood to
middle age. From March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986, a total of
5115 black and white adults aged 18 to 30 years were recruited
and examined in field centers in 4 locations: Birmingham, Ala-
bama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oak-
land, California.10,11 (The race/ethnicity of all participants were
self-reported.) These participants were re-examined 2, 5, 7, 10,
15, 20, 25, and 30 years later, with a high participant reten-
tion rate of 91%, 86%, 81%, 79%, 74%, 72%, 72%, and 71%, re-
spectively. Our current study uses data from all of the exami-
nation years in which participant addresses were geocoded:
the baseline and 7-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-year examinations.
Given the unique historical context of residential segregation
of black from white individuals in the United States and the
nearlynonoverlappinglevelsofsegregationscoresinblackand
white CARDIA participants, we limited participation in our
study to black adults. Of the 2637 baseline participants, 313
(11.9%) were excluded for not having 2 measures of blood pres-
sure, and 44 (1.7%) were excluded for missing data on base-
line covariates. The final total sample comprised 2280 partici-
pants. Data analyses were performed between August 4, 2016,
and February 9, 2017. The CARDIA study was approved by the
institutional review boards at each field center: the Univer-
sity of Alabama at Birmingham, Northwestern University, Uni-
versity of Minnesota, and Kaiser Permanente. All partici-
pants provided written informed consent.

of all black participants. Segregation was categorized as high

Key Points
Question Are changes in exposure to neighborhood-level racial
residential segregation associated with changes in blood pressure?
Findings In this cohort study of 2280 black adults, increases in
neighborhood-level racial residential segregation were associated
with small but statistically significant increases in systolic blood
pressure, and reductions in segregation levels were associated
with more than a 1–mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure.
Meaning Policies that reduce racial residential segregation may
have meaningful health benefits, such as reductions in blood
pressure.

 marital status (married or cohabiting vs not married or cohab-
iting),educationallevel(highschoolgraduateorless,somecol-
lege, or college degree or higher), neighborhood poverty (per-
centage of neighborhood residents living below the US Census
Bureau–defined poverty threshold), and neighborhood popu-
lation density. Individual income data were not collected at
baseline and thus were not included in our primary analyses.
For sensitivity analyses, we ran all models adjusting for time-
varying income using data from the year 5 examination for
baseline income.
Cigarette smoking was dichotomized as current vs not cur-
rent. Leisure time physical activity was assessed with the
CARDIA physical activity questionnaire, which included ques-
tionsonthefrequencyofparticipationin13categoriesofsports
and exercise during the previous 12 months.16 A score was
summed across all activities and expressed continuously in ex-
ercise units. The reliability and validity of the instrument are
comparable to other activity questionnaires.17,18 Body mass in-
dex was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared. Body weight in light clothing was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.5 lb using a balance beam scale. (To con-
vert pounds to kilograms, multiply by 0.45.) Height without
shoes was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm using a vertically
mounted centimeter ruler and a metal carpenter’
s square.
We calculated descriptive statistics for study variables by
examinationyearandsegregationcategory(highandmedium/
low). Segregation scores can change over time if participants
move to neighborhoods with different levels of segregation or
if participants stay in the same place and the level of segrega-
tion changes in their neighborhood. To get a better sense of
what drove changes in segregation score, we used a paired
t test to calculate the mean within-person change in segrega-
tion score between each successive examination separately for
“movers” (those who changed census tracts between exami-
nations) and “stayers” (those who did not). Fixed-effects re-
gression models were used to estimate the association of
within-person changes in segregation with within-person
changes in blood pressure.19 Fixed-effects models focus only
on within-person variation rather than between-person varia-
tion.Thisapproachhastheadvantageovermixed-effectsmod-
els in that it tightly controls for all measured and unmea-
sured time-invariant characteristics. In fixed-effects models,
characteristics that do not change over time are conditioned
out of the estimation process. For this reason, fixed-effects
models cannot be used to examine the main effects of time-
invariantcharacteristics.However,interactionsinvolvingthese
variables can be examined. Baseline time-invariant covari-
ates, including age, sex, and field center, were tested for in-
teractions with time to allow for different trends in blood pres-
sure over time that were associated with these characteristics.
All statistically significant interactions (α = .05) were re-
tained in the models.
Our first set of multivariable regression models was
designed to assess the overall relationship between within-
person changes in neighborhood-level racial residential seg-
regation and within-person changes in blood pressure over
the follow-up period. For these analyses, we modeled segre-
gation continuously using the total sample of participants
(n = 2280). We also assessed whether this relationship var-
ied by participant age, neighborhood poverty, educational
level, and income by testing interaction terms between these
covariates and segregation. To investigate whether reduc-
tions in segregation were associated with reductions in
blood pressure among residents who lived in highly segre-
gated neighborhoods at baseline, we examined this relation-
ship among the 1861 participants (81.6% of the total sample)
living in highly segregated neighborhoods at baseline. For
these analyses, we modeled segregation categorically to esti-
mate changes associated with more meaningful changes in
levels of segregation. As a sensitivity analysis, this same
model was run excluding the participants who changed to
lower-segregation neighborhoods but changed back to high-
segregation neighborhoods at any subsequent examination.
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Ofthe2280participantsatbaseline,974(42.7%)weremenand
1306 (57.3%) were women. Of these, 1861 (81.6%) were living
in a high-segregation neighborhood; 278 (12.2%), a medium-
segregation neighborhood; and 141 (6.2%), a low-segregation
neighborhood.Themedian(interquartilerange)follow-uptime
for participants was 24.8 (4.8) years. Overall, the mean (SD)
segregation score was 4.8 (3.1) at baseline, 3.9 (3.1) at year 7,
3.0 (3.1 and 2.8) at years 10 and 15, and 2.5 (2.9 and 2.6) at years
20 and 25. Table 1 presents baseline and subsequent exami-
nation year characteristics separately for those who lived in
highly segregated census tracts at baseline (1861 [81.6%]) and
those who did not (419 [18.4%]). Both the mean segregation
scores and the mean percentage of neighborhood poverty de-
creased over time for participants who started out in high-
segregation neighborhoods (Table 1). Segregation scores in-
creased and neighborhood poverty remained steady among
those who started in medium- or low-segregation neighbor-
hoods, whereas the segregation scores and poverty rates both
decreasedforthosewholivedinahigh-segregationcensustract
at baseline.
Almost all participants (2144 [94%]) moved at least once,
and more than half (1179 [51.7%]) moved 3 or more times over
the follow-up examinations. Participants lived in 10 different
metropolitan areas or counties at baseline, and by year 7 they
lived in more than 100 (Figure). By year 25, participants lived
in more than 170 metropolitan areas or counties. Participants
who stayed in the same neighborhood for more than 2 suc-
cessive examinations did not experience large changes in seg-
regationscoresbetweenthose2examinations(Table2).Incon-
trast, those who moved tended to move to less-segregated
neighborhoods, particularly in earlier examinations.
A 1-SD increase in segregation score was associated with
a mean systolic blood pressure increase of 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06-
0.26) mm Hg after adjusting for time and interactions of time
with baseline age, sex, and field center (Table 3; eAppendix 2
in the Supplement provides a more detailed description of the
interactions of age, sex, and field center with time).

Changes in segregation score were not associated with changes
in diastolic blood pressure.

estimates were smaller but of the same statistical signifi-
cance when blood pressure medication use was adjusted for

tions of changes in all covariates with changes in blood pres-

 hoods at baseline, reductions in exposure to segregation were
associated with reductions in systolic blood pressure (Table 4).
Mean differences in systolic blood pressure were −1.33 (95%
CI, −2.26 to −0.40) mm Hg when comparing high-segrega-
tion with medium-segregation neighborhoods and −1.19 (95%
CI, −2.08 to −0.31) mm Hg when comparing high-segregation
with low-segregation neighborhoods after adjustment for time
and interactions of time with baseline age, sex, and field cen-
ter.Theseassociationsremainedessentiallyunchangedinfully
adjusted models. (See eTable 2 in the Supplement for associa-
tions of changes in all covariates with changes in blood pres-
sure.) Associations were even stronger in sensitivity analyses
excluding participants who moved back to high-segregation
neighborhoods at some point (n = 521). Changes to low-
segregation neighborhoods were associated with 5.71–mm Hg
(95% CI, −7.97 to −3.45–mm Hg) decreases, and changes to me-
dium-segregation neighborhoods were associated with
3.94–mm Hg (95% CI, −6.47 to −1.41–mm Hg) decreases.
Changes in segregation category were not associated with
changes in diastolic blood pressure.
Findings were similar in magnitude and statistical signifi-
cance when the models were adjusted for family income. As
in the models shown in Table 3, point estimates were smaller
but of the same statistical significance when blood pressure
medication use was adjusted for as a covariate. Associations
between changes in segregation and changes in blood pres-
sure did not vary significantly by age, educational level, in-
come, or neighborhood poverty.
Discussion
Previous studies of the association of racial residential segre-
gation with blood pressure have been cross-sectional, but no
study has examined changes in blood pressure.7-9,20 In a geo-
graphicallydiversesampleofblackadultsfollowedupformore
than 25 years, we found that increases in neighborhood-level
racial residential segregation were associated with small but
statistically significant increases in systolic but not diastolic
blood pressure. In addition, among those living in high-
segregation neighborhoods at baseline, reductions in expo-
sure to neighborhood segregation were associated with de-
creases in systolic blood pressure of more than 1 mm Hg.
Reductions in systolic blood pressure of this magnitude
could have important implications for reducing cardiovascu-

 10 fewer coronary heart disease and stroke events and ap-
proximately 20 fewer heart failure events per 100 000 person-
years in black individuals.22 Given the higher burden of el-
evated blood pressure and cardiovascular disease seen among
black persons, even a 1–mm Hg reduction in blood pressure,
such as that seen in this study, has the potential to meaning-
fully combat persistent health disparities.
The association between reductions in segregation and re-
ductions in systolic blood pressure was even stronger (3– to
5–mmHgreductions)whenparticipantswhosesegregationex-
posure levels fluctuated over time were excluded. These de-
creases in segregation (from one category to another) could be
causedbymovestomoreintegratedneighborhoodsorchanges
over time in the racial composition of neighborhoods where
people reside (eg, because of gentrification). Our comparison
of within-person changes in segregation scores across exami-
nations among those who move or stay (Table 2) suggests that
our findings are largely driven by moving, many of which were
intercounty or intermetropolitan moves. Consistent with this
finding is the suggestion from recent research using US Cen-
sus data that intermetropolitan movers are more likely than
intrametropolitan movers to take advantage of the opening of
housing markets brought on by increased enforcement of the
Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibited race, religion, na-
tional origin, and sex–based discrimination in the sale, rental,
and financing of housing.23
The persistence of these findings after adjustment for
neighborhood poverty, physical activity, body mass index, and
smoking suggests that other factors may operate to link seg-
regation and systolic blood pressure. For example, some sa-
lubrious dietary changes (eg, use of less sodium) may be as-
sociated with systolic blood pressure in the short term but
perhaps not at all or only in the long term with body mass in-
dex. Stress may also account for the association of changes in
segregation with changes in systolic blood pressure. Segrega-
tion affects the quality of schools, the value of housing, and
the physical access to health-promoting resources (eg, phar-
macies, full-service grocers, and gyms).3,24,25 Improved ac-
cess to these resources and opportunities for participants and
their children could reduce stress and in turn systolic blood
pressure. Differences in access to health care could also pro-
mote better blood pressure management.26
Limitations
This study is not without limitations. The use of fixed-effects
models offers the advantage of accounting for measured and
unmeasured time-invariant confounders, but there may still
be residual confounding by unmeasured time-varying fac-
tors (eg, residential priorities and preferences). In addition, al-
though retention rates in CARDIA are high, loss to follow-up
could bias our findings if loss is patterned by residential seg-
regation and blood pressure.
Conclusions
Among participants in our study, temporal changes in expo-
sure to racial residential segregation were associated with
changes in systolic blood pressure. Recent evidence suggests
that differences of this magnitude at the population level can
meaningfully reduce cardiovascular events, particularly in
black individuals.22 Several strategies need to be employed at
the policy level to reduce the persistent racial health dispari-
ties we see in the United States, including policies that not
only improve access to resources for those who live in segre-
gated neighborhoods but also provide residents in segregated
neighborhoods with the opportunity to move to neighbor-
hoods with better access to resources. Findings from our
observational study suggest that social policies that mini-
mize segregation, such as the opening of housing markets,
may have meaningful health benefits, including the reduc-
tion of blood pressure.
