The global burden of tuberculosis: results from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2015
GBD Tuberculosis Collaborators
Summary
Background An understanding of the trends in tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality is crucial to tracking 
of the success of tuberculosis control programmes and identification of remaining challenges. We assessed trends in 
the fatal and non-fatal burden of tuberculosis over the past 25 years for 195 countries and territories.
Methods We analysed 10 691 site-years of vital registration data, 768 site-years of verbal autopsy data, and 361 site-years 
of mortality surveillance data using the Cause of Death Ensemble model to estimate tuberculosis mortality rates. We 
analysed all available age-specific and sex-specific data sources, including annual case notifications, prevalence 
surveys, and estimated cause-specific mortality, to generate internally consistent estimates of incidence, prevalence, 
and mortality using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We assessed how observed tuberculosis 
incidence, prevalence, and mortality differed from expected trends as predicted by the Socio-demographic Index 
(SDI), a composite indicator based on income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate. We also 
estimated tuberculosis mortality and disability-adjusted life-years attributable to the independent effects of risk factors 
including smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes.
Findings Globally, in 2015, the number of tuberculosis incident cases (including new and relapse cases) was 
10·2 million (95% uncertainty interval 9·2 million to 11·5 million), the number of prevalent cases was 10·1 million 
(9·2 million to 11·1 million), and the number of deaths was 1·3 million (1·1 million to 1·6 million). Among individuals 
who were HIV negative, the number of incident cases was 8·8 million (8·0 million to 9·9 million), the number of 
prevalent cases was 8·9 million (8·1 million to 9·7 million), and the number of deaths was 1·1 million (0·9 million 
to 1·4 million). Annualised rates of change from 2005 to 2015 showed a faster decline in mortality (–4·1% 
[–5·0 to –3·4]) than in incidence (–1·6% [–1·9 to –1·2]) and prevalence (–0·7% [–1·0 to –0·5]) among HIV-negative 
individuals. The SDI was inversely associated with HIV-negative mortality rates but did not show a clear gradient for 
incidence and prevalence. Most of Asia, eastern Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa had higher rates of HIV-negative 
tuberculosis burden than expected given their SDI. Alcohol use accounted for 11·4% (9·3–13·0) of global tuberculosis 
deaths among HIV-negative individuals in 2015, diabetes accounted for 10·6% (6·8–14·8), and smoking accounted 
for 7·8% (3·8–12·0).
Interpretation Despite a concerted global effort to reduce the burden of tuberculosis, it still causes a large disease 
burden globally. Strengthening of health systems for early detection of tuberculosis and improvement of the quality 
of tuberculosis care, including prompt and accurate diagnosis, early initiation of treatment, and regular follow-up, are 
priorities. Countries with higher than expected tuberculosis rates for their level of sociodemographic development 
should investigate the reasons for lagging behind and take remedial action. Efforts to prevent smoking, alcohol use, 
and diabetes could also substantially reduce the burden of tuberculosis.

Introduction
Tuberculosis kills more than 1 million people every year, 
most of them in low-income and middle-income 
countries.1–3 An understanding of the trends in 
tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality is 
crucial to track the success of tuberculosis control 
programmes and to identify remaining intervention 
challenges for tuberculosis care and prevention. 
Rigorous evaluation of these trends is, however, 
challenging.1 The primary data sources used to estimate 
the epidemiological burden of tuberculosis, including 
annual case notifications, prevalence surveys, and cause 
of death data, have various shortcomings.1,4,5 Also, their 
availability differs across regions and time periods.
In countries where tuberculosis is endemic, health 
and surveillance systems are usually weak, with 
underdiagnosis 
and 
under-reporting 
common.5 
Prevalence surveys are designed to provide unbiased 
measures of tuberculosis prevalence, but low response 
rates and contamination of tuberculosis specimens 
affect the quality of these surveys.4,6 The validity of 
imputation methods to correct for low response rates in

prevalence surveys has been questioned; even in 
countries with a more than 90% response rate, 
imputation can increase the prevalence of smear-
positive tuberculosis by 6–13%.4 The need for large 
sample sizes makes prevalence surveys expensive and 
hence they are carried out only intermittently or not at 
all by countries with a substantial burden. In many 
tuberculosis-endemic countries where reliable vital 
registration systems are unavailable, verbal autopsy is 
commonly used to measure cause-specific mortality. 
Verbal autopsy studies are prone to misclassification 
errors as they have to rely on information recalled by 
family 
members 
of 
the 
deceased.7 
Given 
the 
imperfections in data sources, we propose that 
statistical triangulation of multiple data sources could 
provide a more robust assessment of tuberculosis 
epidemiology than has been done so far.1
An assessment of the contribution of potentially 
modifiable risk factors is also a crucial input into 
tuberculosis control policy. Moreover, an assessment of 
how incidence, prevalence, and mortality change as 
countries 
progress 
through 
the 
epidemiological 
transition (ie, an epidemiological shift from comm-
unicable to non-communicable causes of disease burden 
related 
to 
sociodemographic 
development)3,8,9 
can 
enhance understanding of a country’s tuberculosis status 
in the context of its sociodemographic position. 
Knowledge of which countries lag behind the 
sociodemographic development trajectory for these 
measures can inform both investments in research and 
subsequent intervention efforts that aim to meet the 
Sustainable Development Goal to end tuberculosis by 
2030.10
For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015),3,8,9 we assessed the levels 
and trends in the fatal and non-fatal burden of 
tuberculosis over the past 25 years for 195 countries and 
territories. We also analysed the relationship between 
tuberculosis burden and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), 
a composite indicator based on income, education, and 
fertility and developed for GBD 2015. We also estimated 
tuberculosis deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) attributable to the independent effects of risk 
factors including smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes.
Methods
Overview
The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is a systematic, 
scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude 
of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors 
by age, sex, and geography over time. GBD 2015 includes 
195 countries and territories, 11 of which (Brazil, China, 
India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, 
Sweden, the UK, and the USA) were analysed at the 
subnational level. The conceptual and analytical 
framework for GBD, with details of the hierarchy of 
causes and risk factors, data inputs and processing, and 
analytical methods, has been published elsewhere.3,8,9,11 
We summarise the methods used for analysis of the 
burden of tuberculosis.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Tuberculosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, 
especially in low-income and middle-income countries. The 
global burden of tuberculosis has been estimated by several 
groups, including the WHO Global TB Programme and the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2013. 
However, the contribution of potentially modifiable risk factors 
to tuberculosis burden and how the burden changes as countries 
progress through the epidemiological transition have not been 
well characterised. We searched PubMed with the search terms 
“tuberculosis” AND (“burden” OR “estimates”) AND “trend”, 
with no language restrictions, for articles published up to 
Nov 21, 2017, which produced 17 studies that provided 
population-wide tuberculosis burden time trends (incidence, 
prevalence, or deaths), of which ten were at the country level, six 
were at the subnational level, and one was at the regional and 
country level. Of all studies, the most recent period assessed was 
1999–2013 in Lebanon. None of these studies assessed the 
tuberculosis burden attributable to risk factors over time or the 
epidemiological transition.
Added value of this study
This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the trends 
in tuberculosis burden and the burden attributable to risk 
factors (smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes). Moreover, it 
includes analysis of the relationship between tuberculosis 
burden and Socio-demographic Index (a composite indicator 
based on income, education, and fertility developed for the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors 
Study 2015) to enhance the understanding of a country’s 
tuberculosis status in the context of its sociodemographic 
position. It identifies key areas for prioritisation of resources 
and areas for further research and interventions.
Implications of all the available evidence
Whereas progress is being made in reduction of tuberculosis 
mortality, tuberculosis is still responsible for an enormous 
disease burden worldwide. Moreover, incidence is declining 
more slowly than mortality in many countries. Strengthening 
of health systems for early detection of tuberculosis and 
improvements in diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up 
should therefore be priorities. Countries where the burden of 
tuberculosis is higher than predicted by their 
sociodemographic development should work to investigate 
the reasons for the discrepancy and address them as 
appropriate. Efforts to prevent smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, 
and HIV are also likely to substantially reduce the global 
burden of tuberculosis.

Case definition
Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The case definition 
includes all forms of tuberculosis, including pulmonary 
and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which are bacterio-
logically 
confirmed 
or 
clinically 
diagnosed. 
The 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes 
are A10–19.9, B90–90.9, K67
.3, K93.0, M49.0, and P37
.0, 
and the ICD-9 codes are 010–19.9, 137–37
.9, 138.0–38.9, 
and 730.4–30.6. For HIV–tuberculosis, the ICD 10 code is 
B20.0.
Tuberculosis mortality among HIV-negative individuals
The appendix shows the input data, analytical process, 
and output from the analysis of tuberculosis mortality 
among HIV-negative individuals. Input data for this 
analysis included 10 691 site-years of vital registration 
data, 768 site-years of verbal autopsy data, and 361 site-
years of mortality surveillance data. Country-specific data 
sources and citations are available online. The assessment 
and adjustment of vital registration data for completeness 
have been reported in detail previously.3 Vital registration 
data were adjusted for garbage coding (including ill-
defined codes and use of intermediate causes) following 
GBD algorithms and misclassified HIV deaths (ie, HIV 
deaths being assigned to other underlying causes of 
death, such as tuberculosis or diarrhoea because of 
stigma or misdiagnosis). Country-specific data before 
and after garbage code redistribution are available in the 
online data visualisation tool. Verbal autopsy data in 
countries with high HIV prevalence (using an arbitrary 
cutoff of 5% age-standardised HIV prevalence) were 
removed because of a high probability of misclassification, 
as verbal autopsy studies have a poor ability to distinguish 
HIV 
deaths 
from 
HIV–tuberculosis 
deaths 
(ie, 
tuberculosis deaths among HIV-positive people).
We used our Cause of Death Ensemble modelling 
(CODEm) strategy,2,12–14 which has been widely used to 
generate global estimates of cause-specific mortality. The 
CODEm strategy evaluates potential models that apply 
different functional forms (mixed-effects models and 
spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models) to 
mortality rates or cause fractions with varying 
combinations of predictive covariates.2 These covariates 
consist of alcohol consumption (litres of pure alcohol per 
person per year), diabetes (fasting plasma glucose 
concentration in mmol/L), education (years per person), 
health system access, lag-distributed income (LDI; gross 
domestic product per capita that has been smoothed over 
the preceding 10 years), the proportion of malnutrition 
(children younger than 5 years of age who are 
underweight), indoor air pollution prevalence, population 
density 
(people 
per 
km²), 
smoking 
prevalence, 
sociodemographic status, and a summary exposure 
variable (SEV) scalar. The SEV scalar reflects the exposure 
to risk factors related to tuberculosis weighted by their 
relative risk value. The methods used to develop the SEV 
scalar covariate for GBD 2015 have been described in 
detail elsewhere.11 The ensemble of CODEm models that 
performed best on out-of-sample predictive validity tests 
was then selected.
HIV–tuberculosis mortality
To establish tuberculosis deaths in HIV-positive 
individuals, we first computed the fraction of HIV–
tuberculosis deaths among all tuberculosis deaths using 
144 country-years of high-quality vital registration data 
(appendix). Second, we calculated the proportion of 
HIV–tuberculosis cases among all tuberculosis cases 
with an HIV test result as reported in the WHO 
tuberculosis register. We used a mixed-effects regression 
on the logit of the proportion of HIV–tuberculosis cases 
among all tuberculosis cases to predict the proportions of 
HIV-positive tuberculosis cases for all locations and 
years, using an adult HIV death rate covariate and 
country random effects. Third, we assumed that the 
fraction of HIV–tuberculosis deaths among all tuber-
culosis deaths in each location and year (Dc,y) is a function 
of the prevalence of HIV–tuberculosis among tuber-
culosis cases (Pc,y) and that the relative risk (RR) of 
tuberculosis death among patients with HIV infection 
and tuberculosis can be generalised over time and 
between locations:
Solving the equation for RR gives:
We took the RR from each location and year for which we 
had data for the fraction of HIV–tuberculosis deaths 
among all tuberculosis deaths to estimate a median RR. 
We then applied that median RR to the predicted 
proportions of HIV–tuberculosis cases among all tuber-
culosis cases to estimate the fraction of HIV–tuber 
culosis 
deaths among all tuberculosis deaths for all locations and 
years. Next, we calculated location-year-specific HIV–
tuberculosis deaths (DeathsHIV–TBc,y) using the following 
equation:
where DeathsTBc,y is location-year-specific deaths from the 
CODEm tuberculosis HIV-negative model. Finally, we 
applied the age-sex pattern of the HIV mortality estimates 
to these HIV–tuberculosis deaths to generate HIV–
tuberculosis deaths for all locations and years by age and 
sex. Since the HIV–tuberculosis deaths were estimated on 
the basis of the fraction of HIV–tuberculosis deaths 
among all tuberculosis deaths, the total number of

HIV–tuberculosis deaths could exceed the total number of 
HIV deaths in some locations. To avoid this occurrence, 
we applied a cap of 45% to the fraction of HIV–tuberculosis 
deaths among HIV deaths on the basis of the largest 
fraction reported in a review by Cox and colleagues15 and a 
systematic review and meta-analysis by Ford and 
colleagues.16
Non-fatal tuberculosis and HIV–tuberculosis
We used all available cause of death data, case notifications, 
and data from prevalence surveys to produce consistent 
estimates of tuberculosis epidemiology (appendix). From 
these inputs, we calculated priors (expected values) on 
excess mortality and remission to guide the model. We 
used DisMod-MR 2.1,17 the GBD Bayesian meta-regression 
tool that adjusts for differences in methods between data 
sources and imposes consistency between data for 
different parameters. We explain in detail below the 
preparation of each of these data sources and the 
modelling in DisMod-MR 2.1.
We used the age-specific and sex-specific notifications 
(from WHO and our network of collaborators) in our 
modelling of tuberculosis incidence. Our definition of 
incident cases include new and relapse cases diagnosed 
within a given calendar year. If the notification data 
represented new and relapse cases combined, we used the 
data as they were. If cases were broken down by case type 
(new pulmonary smear-positive, new pulmonary smear-
negative, new extrapulmonary, and relapse), we summed 
them to represent all forms of tuberculosis. Smear-positive 
notification data were missing for at least one age group 
for at least 1 year in 41 countries. These countries were 
from sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and the 
Caribbean, north Africa and the Middle East, eastern, 
central, and western Europe, and high-income north 
America. Smear-negative and extrapulmonary tuberculosis 
data were missing for at least one age group for at least 1 
year in almost all countries. We imputed missing age 
groups for three forms of tuberculosis notifications 
(pulmonary smear-positive, pulmonary smear-negative, 
and extrapulmonary). We increased smear-positive age-
specific notifications by the proportions of smear-unknown 
and relapsed cases that were only reported at the country-
year level. Some countries reported pulmonary smear-
positive cases only for selected years (eg, 67 countries in 
2006 and 33 in 2012). Most of these countries were from 
sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia). We predicted 
missing smear-negative and extrapulmonary cases from 
adjusted smear-positive cases using a seemingly unrelated 
regression approach.18 We then added all three types of 
notifications. We categorised countries on the basis of 
WHO’s estimates of country-year-specific case detection 
rates (CDRs) into ten bins using a 5 year moving average. 
We assumed all high-income countries to be in the highest 
decile of CDR. For all other countries, we used covariates 
for their CDR decile as an initial guide for how much 
notifications need to be increased in DisMod-MR 2.1 to 
reflect the incidence of all tuberculosis. We then generated 
a final incidence estimate that is consistent with prevalence 
data and cause-specific mortality estimates using Bayesian 
meta-regression. We included SEV as a location-level 
covariate to help inform variation over year and geography, 
with priors that at higher SEV values, incidence increases.
We estimate point prevalence for tuberculosis. Point 
prevalent cases represent people in the population who at 
any point during a given calendar year have active 
tuberculosis. We included data from prevalence surveys 
reporting on pulmonary smear-positive tuberculosis and 
bacteriologically positive tuberculosis. Because all forms of 
tuberculosis are included in notification data, we adjusted 
prevalence surveys to account for extra 
pulmonary cases. 
We predicted proportions of extra 
pulmonary tuberculosis 
among all tuberculosis cases for all locations and years by 
age and sex using data for the three forms of tuberculosis 
from the notification data and LDI as a covariate and 
applied them to data from prevalence surveys. We included 
a covariate to adjust smear-positive tuberculosis estimates 
to the value of bacteriologically positive tuberculosis. We 
found no systematic bias comparing data from studies that 
used both symptoms and chest x-rays as screening 
methods and studies that used only one of these methods. 
We therefore did not adjust these data but allowed 
DisMod-MR 2.1 to estimate the additional uncertainty 
associated with datapoints from studies that had used only 
one of the screening methods. Similarly, we added 
uncertainty to datapoints from subnational surveys. The 
method used to increase the uncertainty around datapoints 
in the dataset has been described in detail elsewhere.19 We 
also included the SEV scalar as a covariate for prevalence.
We matched each prevalence survey datapoint and 
tuberculosis cause-specific mortality rate (CSMR) among 
HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals by location, 
year, age, and sex to calculate the excess mortality rate 
(EMR) as the ratio of CSMR to prevalence. We also 
matched each notification datapoint and tuberculosis 
CSMR by location, year, age, and sex to calculate EMR for 
data-rich countries (defined as countries with vital 
registration more than 95% complete for more than 
25 years3 [appendix]), assuming a remission of 2—ie, an 
average duration of 6 months (1/0·5 years). We estimated 
priors on remission for countries where both incidence 
and prevalence data were available. We matched incidence 
and prevalence data by location, year, age, and sex and 
calculated remission as the ratio of incidence to prevalence 
minus the EMR. We ran two DisMod-MR 2.1 models, one 
for data-rich countries using the assumed remission, and 
another for remaining countries for which we used the 
estimated priors on remission. To reflect a gradient in 
EMR and remission, we added the log-transformed LDI as 
a covariate, with priors that as LDI values increase, EMR 
decreases and remission increases. For final results, we 
combined results from the two DisMod-MR 2.1 models. 
β coefficients and exponentiated values for covariates 
from the two models are shown in the appendix.

For each location, we included the following inputs 
in the DisMod model: case notifications representing 
all forms of tuberculosis, prevalence survey data 
(adjusted for extrapulmonary tuberculosis) if available, 
excess mortality priors, remission priors, and cause-
specific mortality estimates (tuberculosis and HIV–
tuberculosis combined) by age and sex. DisMod-MR 2.1 
generated internally consistent estimates for each 
5 year interval between 1990 and 2015 for 195 countries 
and territories.
As an example, the internally consistent modelling of 
tuberculosis (all forms) for male individuals in rural 
Gujarat, India, in 2015 is shown in the appendix. 
Statistical triangulation of death, prevalence, and 
adjusted notifications shows inconsistencies between 
data sources, as evident in the incidence model, showing 
a pattern in under-reporting increasing with age. The 
internally consistent modelling for each country and 
territory is available online.
The output from the DisMod-MR 2.1 model described 
above is for all forms of tuberculosis in HIV-negative and 
HIV-positive individuals. We applied the predicted 
location-specific and year-specific proportions of HIV–
tuberculosis cases among all tuberculosis cases (as 
described in the HIV–tuberculosis mortality section 
above) to tuberculosis incident and prevalent cases from 
DisMod-MR 2.1 to generate HIV–tuberculosis incident 
and prevalent cases by location and year. Subsequently, 
we split the estimates on the basis of the age-sex pattern 
of estimated HIV prevalence by country-year to generate 
HIV–tuberculosis incident and prevalent cases for all 
locations and years by age and sex.
SDI
The methods used to develop the SDI for GBD 2015 have 
been described in detail elsewhere.3,8,9,11 Briefly, the SDI 
was computed on the basis of the geometric mean of three 
indicators: income per capita, average years of schooling, 
and total fertility rates. SDI scores were scaled from 0 
(lowest income, lowest average years of schooling, and 
highest fertility) to 1 (highest income, highest average 
years of schooling, and lowest fertility), and each location 
was assigned an SDI score for each year. Average 
relationships between SDI and rates of tuberculosis 
incidence, prevalence, and mortality were estimated using 
spline regressions, which were then used to estimate 
expected values at each level of SDI. Five SDI quintiles 
were also created for country-year combinations. The 
results presented for SDI quintiles in this study reflect 
each country’s position based on its SDI values in 2015.
Comparative risk assessment
The basic approach for the GBD 2015 comparative risk 
assessment was to calculate the proportion of deaths and 
DALYs attributable to risk factors (eg, tuberculosis 
attributable to smoking) as a counterfactual to the 
hypothetical situation that populations had been exposed 
to a theoretical minimum level of exposure in the past. 
As in previous GBD studies, a set of behavioural, 
environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks 
were evaluated in GBD 2015. Inclusion of a risk–outcome 
pair was based on the evidence of convincing or probable 
causal relationship between the risk and the outcome. 
We had evidence for such a relationship between 
diabetes, alcohol use, and smoking and risk of 
tuberculosis.11,20 Some risk factors (eg, indoor air pollution 
and malnutrition) have been hypothesised to have a 
strong link with tuberculosis, but we did not quantify the 
burden attributable to these risk factors because of 
insufficient evidence of a causal relationship.21–23 For 
example, evidence for indoor air pollution was based on 
cross-sectional studies (which are limited by their 
inability to establish a temporal relationship) and case-
control studies (which are prone to recall bias as none of 
the studies measured indoor air pollution objectively).23 
To date, we have not quantified the contribution of other 
classes of risk factors (eg, social, cultural, economic, and 
genetic factors).
DALYs were computed as the sum of years of life lost 
and years lived with disability for each location, age, sex, 
and year. Estimates of attributable DALYs (or number of 
deaths) were computed by multiplying DALYs (or 
number of deaths) for the outcome by the population-
attributable fraction (PAF) for the risk-outcome pair for 
a given age, sex, location, and year. Full details of 
methods used in the comparative risk assessment have 
been reported elsewhere11 and are also provided in the 
appendix. To generate estimates of alcohol consumption 
in g per day, data from population surveys were used in 
combination with estimates of per-person consumption 
from the Food and Agriculture Organization24 and 
Global Information System on Alcohol and Health.25 
For smoking, we included 2818 sources of primary data 
from the Global Health Data Exchange database.26 In 
addition to these primary data sources, we supplemented 
these data with secondary database estimates from the 
WHO InfoBase and International Smoking Statistics 
databases for sources for which primary data were 
unavailable. We included 281 sources from WHO 
InfoBase and 313 sources from International Smoking 
Statistics. For diabetes, we included 717 sources of 
population-based survey data identified through our 
systematic search of PubMed and the Global Health 
Data Exchange. A full list of data sources and citations 
for the three risk factors and RRs for the associations 
between risk factors and tuber 
culosis are provided in 
the appendix.

Results
Levels and trends of tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, 
and mortality
Globally, in 2015, 10·2 million (95% uncertainty interval 
[95% UI] 9·2 million to 11·5 million) tuberculosis 
incident cases occurred, 10·1 million (9·2 million to 
11·1 million) prevalent cases occurred, and 1·3 million 
(1·1 million to 1·6 million) deaths from tuberculosis 
(HIV negative and HIV positive combined) occurred. 
Among individuals who were HIV negative, the number 
of incident cases was 8·8 million (8·0 million to 
9·9 million), the number of prevalent cases was 
8·9 million (8·1 million to 9·7 million), and the number 
of deaths was 1·1 million (0·9 million to 1·4 million). 
Globally, among HIV-negative individuals, more incident 
cases and deaths occurred in men than in women in most 
age groups (figure 1). The age-standardised tuberculosis 
incidence rate (per 100 000 people) among men (154·4 
[140·0–172·2]) was 1·8 times higher than that among 
women (86·3 [78·0–97·4]), and the age-standardised 
tuberculosis mortality rate (per 100 000 people) among 
men (21·9 [16·5–29·5]) was about twice as high as that 
among women (10·8 [8·5–13·1]). We estimated that 
690 262 (551 275–859 100) incident cases of tuberculosis, 
612 183 (498 242–744 815) prevalent cases, and 69 681 
(57 982–88 962) deaths from tuberculosis occurred among 
children younger than 15 years in 2015.
Age-standardised tuberculosis mortality rates (HIV 
negative and HIV positive combined) changed at –1·8% 
(95% UI –2·4 to –1·4) per year from 1990 to 2005, with 
accelerated improvements from 2005 to 2015 (–4·6% 
[–5·4 to –3·9] per year; appendix). The corresponding 
change among individuals who were HIV negative was 
–3·1% (–3·6 to –2·6) per year from 1990 to 2005 and –4·1% 
(–5·0 to –3·4) per year from 2005 to 2015 (table 1). A much 
slower decrease has occurred in global age-standardised 
tuberculosis incidence and prevalence annualised rates of 
change (ARCs) than in mortality rates among HIV-negative 
individuals. We observed a similar pattern when including 
HIV-positive individuals (appendix).
When examining ARCs by SDI quintile, we observed a 
gradient in ARCs for tuberculosis age-standardised 
mortality rates among HIV-negative individuals during the 
period 2005–15: ARCs ranged from –2·8% (95% UI 
–4·8 to –0·9) in the lowest SDI quintile to –7·2% 
(–7·9 to –6·5) in the highest quintile. We did not see a 
clear gradient, however, in ARCs for tuberculosis incidence 
and prevalence among HIV-negative individuals across the 
SDI quintiles (table 1). Across regions, in the period 
2005–15, incidence ARCs among people who were HIV 
negative ranged from 0·3% (–0·4 to 1·1) in Australasia to 
–3·5% (–4·1 to –2·7) in eastern Europe (table 2). South Asia 
accounted for 35·8% of incident cases and 49·2% of 
deaths in 2015. Southeast Asia accounted for 14·6% of 
incident cases and 15·5% of deaths in 2015. In eastern 
Europe, during the period 1990–2005, mortality, incidence, 
and prevalence all increased. In the period 2005–15, 
however, the trends for all three indicators reversed to 
show decreasing trends. 
Figure 2 shows maps of age-standardised incidence 
and death rates for tuberculosis in HIV-negative 
individuals in 2015. The age-standardised incidence rate 
of tuberculosis in HIV-negative people was more than 
210 per 100 000 population in 17 countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa as well as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. 
Death rates in HIV-negative individuals were more than 
50 per 100 000 population in 25 countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa as well as Indonesia, Kiribati, Myanmar, and 
Nepal. Death rates varied greatly in north Africa and the 
Middle East, ranging from 0·1 (95% UI 0·1–0·2) 
per 100 000 in Palestine in 2015 to 30·1 (18·2–44·5) 
per 100 000 in Afghanistan. Detailed results, broken 
down by age and sex, are available online.
Observed versus expected tuberculosis incidence, 
prevalence, and mortality
Globally 
and 
in 
most 
regions, 
age-standardised 
tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates 
showed a steady decline with rising SDI (figure 3). Many 
regions (eg, southeast Asia, south Asia, central Asia, 
eastern Europe, Andean Latin America, and sub-Saharan 
Africa) had higher than expected incidence, prevalence,

and mortality rates, whereas a few others (eg, Oceania 
and north Africa and the Middle East) showed lower than 
expected levels over time (appendix). Of all regions in 
2015, southern sub-Saharan Africa had the largest 
difference between observed and expected levels, 
although the observed mortality has begun to fall closer 
to expected levels since around 2007
. The gaps between 
observed and expected incidence and mortality also 
gradually decreased over time in several other regions 
(eg, southeast Asia, south Asia, and Andean Latin 
America), but we observed little change in the gaps for 
central, eastern, and western sub-Saharan Africa. In east 
Asia, we observed little change in the gap between 
observed and expected levels of incidence and prevalence 
over time, although the observed mortality converged 
with expected levels during 2015. In eastern Europe, the 
observed incidence, prevalence, and mortality increased 
between 1990 and 2005 but has begun to fall closer to 
expected levels in the last decade.
Tuberculosis mortality and DALYs attributable to 
individual risk factors
Table 3 shows the global and regional tuberculosis deaths 
attributable to smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes in 2015 
and the corresponding ARCs for age-standardised rates of 
death in individuals who are HIV negative (the appendix 
contains DALYs attributable to the three risk factors 
and ARCs). Globally, in 2015, among HIV-negative 
individuals, alcohol use accounted for 126 459 (95% UI 
94 124–168 699) tuberculosis deaths, followed by diabetes 
(118 298 [73 111–169 308] deaths) and smoking (86 849 
[41 265–140 152] deaths). The corresponding PAF due to 
alcohol was 11·4% (9·3–13·0), due to diabetes was 10·6% 
(6·8–14·8), and due to smoking was 7·8% (3·8–12·0), 
and we observed no significant difference between the 
PAFs due to these three risk factors (appendix). Age-
standardised tuberculosis deaths attributable to smoking 
changed at a faster rate per year than did those attributable 
to alcohol use and diabetes from 2005 to 2015 (table 3). 
Across regions, ARCs for age-standardised tuberculosis 
deaths attributable to smoking varied from –2·4% 
(–7·3 to 2·3) in central sub-Saharan Africa to –8·7% 
(–9·7 to –7·6) in eastern Europe and to alcohol use from 
–1·9% (–6·3 to 2·4) to –8·3% (–9·3 to –7·1). ARCs for 
age-standardised tuberculosis deaths attributable to 
diabetes varied from –1·3% (–5·3 to 2·3) in central sub-
Saharan Africa to –8·6% (–10·0 to –6·8) in east Asia.
Figure 4 shows the age-standardised PAFs for global 
tuberculosis deaths due to the three risk factors among 
HIV-negative male and female individuals in 1990, 2005, 
and 2015 (the appendix contains PAFs for DALYs). The 
age-standardised PAFs for tuberculosis deaths due to 
smoking and alcohol use were between four times and 
six times higher among men than among women across 
all three timepoints, whereas they were similar between 
sexes for diabetes. In both men and women, PAFs for 
smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes did not change 
substantially from 1990 to 2005 and 2005 to 2015.
Discussion
Globally, substantial progress has been made in reducing 
mortality from tuberculosis. However, age-standardised 
tuberculosis incidence and prevalence are declining 
much more slowly than mortality in many countries. 
Despite a powerful interaction between tuberculosis and 
HIV, most tuberculosis cases and deaths occur among 
HIV-negative people in south and southeast Asia, where 
HIV prevalence is relatively low. Most of Asia, eastern 
Europe, and all of sub-Saharan Africa had higher 
tuberculosis burden than expected given their level of 
sociodemographic develop 
ment.
Despite a decline in mortality from tuberculosis, an 
estimated 1·1 million deaths still occurred among HIV-
negative individuals worldwide in 2015, along with 
0·2 million deaths among HIV-positive individuals. Age-
standardised mortality rates due to tuberculosis are 
declining at a slower pace than are those due to HIV and 
malaria.3 Whereas improved access to treatment probably 
reduced tuberculosis deaths, large funding gaps remain, 
with the largest gap being for multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
tuberculosis.27 WHO and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria estimated that at least 
US$1·6 billion of international support was required 
annually to fill the funding gap for tuberculosis control 
between 2014 and 2016 in 118 low-income and middle-
income countries.27 However, the growth rate of devel-
opment assistance for tuberculosis has decelerated 
substantially since 2010,28 making it more challenging for 
health systems to reduce the burden of tuberculosis in 
low-income countries than in middle-income and high-
income countries.
Tuberculosis incidence is either stagnant or declining 
more slowly than mortality in many tuberculosis-endemic 
countries, suggesting delays in diagnosis and treatment.29–33 
One untreated patient with tuberculosis can infect many 
healthy contacts.34,35 Although only a small proportion of 
infected people progress to active tuberculosis, it is difficult 
to predict who will progress from latent infection to active 
disease.36 Early diagnosis of active tuberculosis is chal-
lenging; substantial delays in diagnosis and treatment 
have been linked to multiple factors, including absence of 
awareness of symptoms, absence of access to health 
services, shortages of trained clinicians and laboratory 
personnel to make the diagnosis, and poor diagnostic 
tools.30,31,37,38 High proportions of initial default (ie, never 
starting tuberculosis treatment) have been reported in

settings relying on passive case finding.39–42 Community-
wide active case finding aims to reduce barriers to early 
detection, but few studies have evaluated the cost-
effectiveness of screening for active tuberculosis.43 
Evidence suggests that compared with conventional 
smear microscopy, use of sputum Xpert-MTB/RIF 
(Cepheid, USA) substantially increases case detection (by 
almost 50%) during intensified case finding in high-burden 
community settings.44 Studies evaluating the cost-
effectiveness of screening for active tuberculosis using 
new diagnostic tools, such as Xpert-MTB/RIF, would 
therefore be very useful. Tuberculosis incidence is also 
declining more slowly than mortality in various low-
tuberculosis-burden countries, with some showing either 
stagnant or increasing trends in incidence. Several low-
tuberculosis-burden countries do not have a national 
tuberculosis programme or elimination plan to guide 
control efforts.45
Our results showed a notable difference in the global 
age distribution of tuberculosis cases and deaths: cases 
were highest among young adults, but deaths were 
highest among old adults. This finding might be 
explained by a greater risk of reactivation of latent 
tuberculosis in younger adults as reported by 
longitudinal birth cohort studies46,47 and a higher risk of 
adverse reactions from anti-tuberculosis drugs48 and 
mortality in older people.49,50 Our results also showed 
that age-standardised incidence and mortality from 
tuberculosis were about twice as high in men than in 
women. Various explanations have been suggested for 
the sex difference in tuberculosis risk, including 
differential access to health care, differential exposure to 
risk factors (eg, smoking), and genetic variation.51–53 An 
understanding of the age–sex distribution of tuberculosis 
cases and deaths has implications for tuberculosis 
control programmes in terms of targeting of inter-
ventions to high-risk groups.
Risk factors also play an important part in the control of 
tuberculosis. For example, alcohol abuse has been linked 
to 
poor 
tuberculosis 
treatment 
compliance 
and 
outcomes.54–56 Moreover, tuberculosis risk factors, including 
diabetes, alcohol use, and smoking, could increase the risk 
of tuberculosis through suppression of the immune 
system, especially cell-mediated immunity.57–60 With an 
increase in diabetes prevalence as countries go through 
demographic and epidemiological transition,8 many low-
income and middle-income countries will increasingly 
bear the double burden of tuberculosis and diabetes. 
Globally, in 2015, diabetes, alcohol use, and smoking 
together accounted for about a quarter of tuberculosis 
deaths and DALYs. Efforts to prevent these risk factors can 
therefore have a substantial collateral impact on the 
burden of tuberculosis.
Our method for computation of tuberculosis burden 
differs from that used by WHO and results in different 
estimates in some locations. At the global level, our 
tuberculosis (all forms) incidence estimate (10·2 million 
cases) is slightly lower than that of WHO (10·4 million 
cases) in 2015, but we estimate a higher proportion of 
HIV–tuberculosis (13%) than does WHO (11%).5 Our 
estimated number of all tuberculosis deaths (1·3 million) 
is lower than WHO’s estimate (1·8 million) for 2015. The 
WHO global prevalence estimates for 2015 were 
unavailable for comparison. At the country level, our list 
of countries with a high burden of tuberculosis is

consistent with that of WHO, with a few exceptions. The 
WHO top 20 high-burden countries as assessed by 
incident case numbers include Angola, Kenya, and 
North Korea, which in our list are replaced by Uganda, 
Ukraine, and Zimbabwe.
These discrepancies stem from differences in the 
methods used. WHO generated incidence estimates for 
74 countries by adjusting notification data on the basis of 
expert opinion of the case detection rate. By contrast, our 
estimates of prevalence and incidence are driven by the 
statistical 
triangulation 
that 
enforces 
consistency 
between the data overall for different parameters and are 
ultimately based on the logical relationships between 
age-specific and sex-specific incidence, prevalence, 
remission, excess mortality, and cause-specific mortality 
with use of a Bayesian meta-regression method. Our 
statistical triangulation of all sources of data for a country 
revealed discrepancies between notifications, prevalence, 
and cause of death data in some countries (eg, the 
incidence model showed a pattern in under-reporting of 
notification data, which increased with age). In many 
high-tuberculosis-burden settings, tuberculosis cases 
treated in the private sector are not notified; barriers to 
notification include, but are not limited to, confidentiality 
concerns, ignorance of reporting procedure, and scarcity 
of time.61 Strengthening tuberculosis notification and 
vital registration systems is needed to improve the quality 
of data.62,63 Until such systems are fully developed, 
variation in estimates is unavoidable and should be 
appreciated by users of these estimates. Various interim 
improvement options have been suggested, including 
use of inventory studies to assess under-reporting of 
notification 
data62,64 
and 
sample-based 
mortality 
surveillance to generate more robust cause-of-death data 
than so far possible.65 The availability of widely shared, 
high-quality data for low-income and middle-income 
countries and efforts to use a common set of data for 
estimation (which is being increasingly facilitated by 
WHO) would help reduce the discrepancy between GBD 
and WHO estimates.
Paediatric tuberculosis incidence has been estimated by 
different groups. We estimated that 690 262 (95% UI 
551 275–859 100) incident cases of tuberculosis occurred 
among children aged younger than 15 years in 2015. Our 
estimate is lower than that from WHO (1 000 000 
[900 000–1 100 000]) for both 201466 and 20155 and from 
Dodd and colleagues67 (847 000 [558 000–1 280 000]) for 
2014. These differences are due to differences in the 
methods used. Dodd and colleagues67 used WHO 
tuberculosis prevalence data and demographic information 
to estimate childhood tuberculosis using a mathematical 
model. WHO combines the CDR adjustment approach (ie, 
incidence=notifications/estimated CDR68) and the method 
of Dodd and colleagues67 to produce their childhood 
tuberculosis incidence estimates.
This study has several limitations. First, our 
assessment of tuberculosis mortality in countries 
without vital registration data is driven by verbal 
autopsy studies, which have modest sensitivity in 
identifying tuberculosis deaths.69–71 Verbal autopsy 
studies have poor ability to distinguish HIV deaths 
from HIV–tuberculosis deaths; for this reason, we 
excluded verbal autopsy data in countries with high 
HIV prevalence. We applied various modelling methods 
by assuming that countries in the same region have a 
similar age–sex distribution of the tuberculosis burden 
as do other countries in that region and using many 
different combinations of covariates to help predict for 
locations and years with sparse or no data. Estimates 
for a location with sparse data are reflected by wide 
uncertainty intervals. Tuberculosis mortality estimates 
could be improved in the future by inclusion of 
additional covariates that have proximal relationships 
with tuberculosis mortality (eg, prevalence of latent 
tuberculosis infection).
Second, a major challenge in our statistical triangulation 
exercise has been the difficulty of finding consistent 
estimates between tuberculosis death rates and prevalence 
data from surveys, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, 
where we have few prevalence surveys and often no usable 
cause of death data because of high HIV prevalence.
Third, although we used Bayesian meta-regression to 
generate a final incidence estimate that is consistent with 
prevalence data and cause-specific mortality estimates, 
use of CDRs as covariates is controversial since they are 
based on expert opinion. We plan to avoid using CDRs in 
the next iteration of GBD.
Fourth, our analysis of the relationship between SDI 
and tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality 
cannot be interpreted as being causal as it only reflects 
the average historical correlation between SDI and each 
of the measures. SDI use might also be low in countries 
with high income inequality. The applicability of SDI 
could be enhanced in the future by taking into account 
social heterogeneity within countries.
Fifth, despite the biological plausibility of a strong 
link between malnutrition and tuberculosis, we have

deaths due to diabetes, alcohol use, and smoking among HIV-negative men 
and women in 1990, 2005, and 2015

not quantified the burden of tuberculosis attributable 
to malnutrition because of insufficient evidence of a 
causal relationship and a scarcity of information about 
the relative risk of tuberculosis associated with 
different levels of malnutrition.21,22 We plan to assess 
the evidence for a causal relationship between low 
body-mass index in adults and risk of tuberculosis in a 
future iteration of GBD. We also have not quantified 
the burden of tuberculosis attributable to indoor air 
pollution since the evidence is based on cross-sectional 
(from 
which 
a 
causal 
relationship 
cannot 
be 
established) and case-control (none of which measured 
biofuel exposure objectively and were thus prone to 
recall bias) studies.23
Finally, in our modelling of tuberculosis, we did not 
separately examine the burden of MDR tuberculosis. 
Given the epidemiological and clinical importance of 
MDR tuberculosis, we plan to include MDR and 
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis estimates in the 
next round of GBD estimation. Despite these limitations, 
we believe the methodological innovation with use of 
statistical triangulation of data sources has yielded more 
robust estimates than would be yielded from reliance on 
a single source of data. This approach could probably be 
further strengthened by incorporation of population-
based surveys of latent tuberculosis infection and then 
modelling of the progression from latent tuberculosis 
infection to active tuberculosis disease. Estimation and 
mapping of tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and 
deaths at a finer spatial resolution than current national 
and subnational estimates could also better inform 
surveillance and targeting of resources for interventions 
than at present.72
Strengthening of national surveillance systems to 
capture all tuberculosis cases is an important public health 
goal for all countries. Until this goal is achieved, statistical 
data triangulation methods will be needed to make use of 
the available data for tracking of the tuberculosis burden. 
Despite general progress in reduction of tuberculosis 
mortality, the disease is still an enormous burden globally. 
Strengthening of health systems for early case detection 
and improvement of the quality of tuberculosis care, 
including prompt and accurate diagnostics, early initiation 
of treat 
ment, and routine follow-up, are priorities.32,73 
Countries where the tuberculosis burden is higher than 
expected based on sociodemographic development should 
investi 
gate the reasons for lagging behind and address 
them as appropriate. Efforts to prevent smoking, alcohol 
use, diabetes, and HIV will also probably have a substantial 
collateral impact on reduction of the burden of tuberculosis.
