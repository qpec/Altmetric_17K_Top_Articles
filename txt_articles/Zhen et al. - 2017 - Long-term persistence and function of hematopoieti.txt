Abstract
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells have emerged as a powerful immunotherapy for
various forms of cancer and show promise in treating HIV-1 infection. However, significant
limitations are persistence and whether peripheral T cell-based products can respond to
malignant or infected cells that may reappear months or years after treatment remains
unclear. Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs) are capable of long-term engraft-
ment and have the potential to overcome these limitations. Here, we report the use of a pro-
tective CD4 chimeric antigen receptor (C46CD4CAR) to redirect HSPC-derived T-cells
against simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in pigtail macaques. CAR-
containing cells persisted for more than 2 years without any measurable toxicity and were
capable of multilineage engraftment. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) treatment
followed by cART withdrawal resulted in lower viral rebound in CAR animals relative to con-
trols, and demonstrated an immune memory-like response. We found CAR-expressing cells
in multiple lymphoid tissues, decreased tissue-associated SHIV RNA levels, and substan-
tially higher CD4/CD8 ratios in the gut as compared to controls. These results show that
HSPC-derived CAR T-cells are capable of long-term engraftment and immune surveillance.
This study demonstrates for the first time the safety and feasibility of HSPC-based CAR
therapy in a large animal preclinical model.

 Author summary
Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cell (HSPC) based gene therapy can be used to treat
many infectious and genetic diseases. Here, we used an HSPC-based approach to redirect
and enhance host immunity against HIV-1. We engineered HSPCs to carry chimeric anti-
gen receptor (CAR) genes that detect and destroy HIV-infected cells. CAR therapy has
shown huge potential in the treatment of cancer, but has only been applied in peripheral
blood T-cells. HSPC-based CAR therapy has several benefits over T cell gene therapy, as it
allows for normal T cell development, selection, and persistence of the engineered cells for
the lifetime of the patient. We used a CAR molecule that hijacks the essential interaction
between the virus and the cell surface molecule CD4 to redirect HSPC-derived T-cells
against infected cells. We observed >2 years of stable production of CAR-expressing cells
without any adverse events, and wide distribution of these cells in lymphoid tissues and
gastrointestinal tract, which are major anatomic sites for HIV replication and persistence
in suppressed patients. Most importantly, HSPC-derived CAR T-cells functionally
responded to infected cells. This study demonstrates for the first time the safety and feasi-
bility of HSPC based therapy utilizing an HIV-specific CAR for suppressed HIV infection.
Introduction
HIV-1 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes mount a key immune response to HIV and are crucial
for the control of viremia and the elimination of HIV infected cells. Previous studies have
shown that a chimeric antigen receptor containing the CD4 molecule linked to the signaling
domain of the T cell receptor z chain (CD4CAR) can be used to redirect peripheral T cells to
target HIV infected cells[1]. CD4 CAR modified T cells can recognize and respond to HIV
gp120 envelope protein on infected cells and can effectively kill HIV infected cells and limit
HIV replication in vitro. Early clinical trials with CD4CAR modified T cells were shown to be
safe but had limited antiviral efficacy[2,3]. The lack of in vivo functionality of the transferred T
cells may have been due to suboptimal T-cell handling and expansion, or because CD4CAR-
expressing CD8+ T-cells were susceptible to HIV infection and elimination[1,2]. Protection of
the CD4CAR modified cells from viral entry is essential in order to ensure T-cell functionality
and survival[4,5].
Hematopoietic Stem/progenitor Cell (HSPC) -based gene therapy has several advantages
over T cell adoptive therapy. First, the regenerative nature of HSPC provides a lifelong supply
of engineered T cells against antigen-expressing target cells, which is key to achieve long term
immune surveillance and a functional cure of HIV infection. Secondly, modified cells undergo
normal T cell differentiation and selection, eliminating potentially self-reactive T cells and
increasing the potential for the development of immunological memory[6–8]. Our previous
studies using humanized mice demonstrated that HSPCs modified with a protective CD4CAR
resulted in successful differentiation of CD4CAR expressing T cells and significant suppres-
sion of HIV replication, suggesting a high degree of feasibility in redirecting immunity with an
HSPC-based approach[4].
The nonhuman primate model is an ideal preclinical surrogate for the development of
cure strategies in HIV+ patients. A series of well-characterized HIV-like viruses are available
to recapitulate acute, chronic, and cART-suppressed infection [9,10]. Furthermore, use of a
large animal model facilitates the detailed measurement of viral reservoirs in peripheral
blood and in tissues. We and others have used macaque models extensively to evaluate autol-
ogous HSPC transplantation to combat a number of human diseases, including HIV

 infection. We have previously demonstrated that infection with the highly CCR5-tropic,
HIV-enveloped simian/human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-1157ipd3N4 (“SHIV-C”)
resembles suppressed infection in patients, including suppression by cART, rebound follow-
ing cART withdrawal, and seeding of viral reservoirs in tissues [11,12]. Further, we have
shown that autologous HSPCs can be modified to resist infection, for example via CCR5
gene editing [13], or expression of a potent inhibitor of HIV/SHIV fusion, the enfuvirtide-
related peptide C46[14]. We have optimized these experiments in pigtail macaques (M.
nemestrina), which carry a TRIM5 genotype that is permissive to lentivirus-mediated gene
therapy approaches [15]. In short, our nonhuman primate model recapitulates virological
and immune facets of HIV infection in patients, and facilitates evaluation of gene therapy-
based HIV cure strategies.
Here, we asked whether HIV/SHIV-specific immunity could be engendered in HSPCs and
their progeny, via modification of autologous HSPCs with a C46CD4CAR-expressing lentivi-
rus vector. Modified cells were evaluated in vitro, and in SHIV-infected nonhuman primates.
Results
C46CD4CAR-modified cells are infection-resistant and HIV-antigen
specific
Our lentivirus constructs contain a CD4 based CAR (CD4CAR) that is composed of the
human CD4 extracellular and transmembrane domain linked to the human CD3z signaling
domain (4). CD4 is the primary receptor for HIV, hence to protect CD4CAR expressing T
cells from viral infection, we co-expressed the C46 fusion inhibitor in the CAR-containing vec-
tor (C46CD4CAR)(Fig 1A) [16]. We also generated a control vector that contains C46 and a
truncated form of CD4CAR that lacks the signaling domain of CD3 z (C46CD4CARΔzeta)
(Fig 1A). Expression of CD4CAR (without C46) resulted in increased HIV infection of Jurkat
T cells (35.8% HIV+, as compared to 12% for unmodified cells) (Fig 1B). However, expression
of C46CD4CAR blocked HIV infection (0.21% HIV+ cells), indicating that C46 protected gene
modified cells from HIV infection. We next tested if the CD4CAR molecule can functionally
respond to antigen in pigtail macaque T cells. We transduced pigtail macaque T cells with con-
trol C46CD4CARΔzeta or C46CD4CAR vector, then stimulated the cells with either unin-
fected or HIV-infected cells that expressed HIV envelope. C46CD4CAR transduced pigtail
macaque T cells produced IL-2 and IFNγ in response to stimulation, indicating that the
CD4CAR molecule is functional in the NHP cells (Fig 1C). In contrast, control cells that
expressed C46CD4CARΔzeta did not respond to HIV infected cells. These data show that
C46CD4CAR cells are protected against HIV infection and respond functionally and specifi-
cally to HIV antigen in NHP cells in vitro.
Multilineage engraftment of C46CD4CAR-modified HSPCs
To examine the effects of the CD4CAR in vivo, four male juvenile pigtail macaques were trans-
planted with autologous HSPCs that were transduced with lentivirus expressing C46CD4CAR
(“CAR1” and “CAR2”) or C46CD4CARΔzeta (“Control 1” and “Control 2”). As shown in S1
Fig, percent lentivirus marking from each animal’s HSPC infusion product ranged from 4.65%
to 40% in colony forming assays. After HSPC transplant, recovery kinetics of total white blood
cells, platelets, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in both control and CAR animals were normal
[14,17] (S2 Fig). We detected stable gene marking of PBMCs from all animals prior to SHIV
challenge (Fig 2A). In addition, we were able to detect C46CD4CAR or C46CD4CARΔzeta

 modified cells in peripheral blood by using an anti-human CD4 antibody clone (13B8.2)
that detects human, but not pigtail macaque CD4 (Fig 2B). Because this antibody will only
label the human CD4CAR in our animals, we refer to CAR+ cells as “huCD4+”. We found that
0.1% to 1.25% of CD45+ peripheral blood leukocytes from control or CAR animals were
huCD4+ (Fig 2C). Importantly, huCD4+ CAR cells from both control and CD4CAR animals
differentiated into multiple hematopoietic lineages, including T cells (CD45+CD3+), NK cells
(CD3−CD2+NKG2A+)[18], B cells (CD45+CD3−CD20+) and monocytes and macrophages
(CD3−CD20−CD14+) (Fig 2D). These results show that autologous transplantation of
C46CD4CAR-transduced HSPC is safe and well tolerated, and results in stable, multilineage
engraftment with typical kinetics of hematopoietic recovery.

 Reduced SHIV rebound in C46CD4CAR animals
To study the effect of C46CD4CAR transplantation on SHIV replication, animals were
infected with SHIV-C for ~24 weeks followed by 28 weeks of combination antiretroviral ther-
apy (cART) and subsequent cART withdrawal. At least 12 weeks after cART cessation, animals
were then sacrificed for necropsy (Fig 3A). Both CD4CAR and control animals had slightly

 higher plasma viral loads prior to cART, and did not achieve full virus suppression following
cART (Fig 3B). This was likely due to residual immune suppression from the transplant proce-
dure [11,19]. The CAR1 animal had approximately 1 log higher viral load as compared to con-
trol animals during acute and chronic SHIV infection, while the CAR2 animal, in which more
than 1% of PBMCs were modified with C46CD4CAR prior to SHIV infection, had lower peak
viremia during acute infection and showed progressively decreasing viral loads prior to cART
(Fig 3B). While CAR 1 and control animals appear to have reached set points after 4 weeks of
SHIV infection, CAR 2 animal demonstrated a trend of continuous reduction of viral load
throughout primary infection (Fig 3B). Interestingly, when we compared average viral load
after cART withdrawal to average viral load during primary infection (week 2 to week 22), we
found that both CAR containing animals had lower average rebound viremia (1.4–2.11 log
lower than primary setpoint) as compared to the control animals (0.4–0.8 log lower than pri-
mary setpoint) (Fig 3C). These findings are consistent with a model in which C46CD4CAR
cells are capable of establishing virus-specific immune memory and responding to recrudes-
cent SHIV viremia.
C46CD4CAR cells expand in a SHIV-dependent manner in vivo
We next measured antigen-dependent responses in C46CD4CAR and control animals by
monitoring CAR gene marking as a function of SHIV plasma viremia. Lentivirus-marked cells
were readily detectable by Taqman in CAR and control animals over the course of our nearly
two-year study (Fig 4A). Interestingly, CAR animals, but not controls, showed increased gene
marking in the periphery at multiple time points. These were coincident with increases in
SHIV viremia, notably during primary infection and viral rebound after cART withdrawal
(Fig 3B). To investigate further, we used flow cytometry to stain for huCD4+ PBMCs at multi-
ple time points following SHIV infection. Consistent with Taqman-based gene marking data,
we found that huCD4+ cells from CAR animals, but not control animals, expanded upon
SHIV infection and post-cART withdrawal viral rebound (Fig 4B–4E). This confirms that
functional C46CD4CAR cells require intact CD3z signaling in order to expand in response to
SHIV antigen. Furthermore, we observed an increase of C46CD4CAR+ cells during acute and
chronic SHIV infection (Fig 4D and 4E), reminiscent of a primary immune response to infec-
tion. After the cessation of cART treatment, the percentage of CD4CAR+ cells again increased
rapidly, mimicking a memory response. The CAR2 animal, which had higher gene marking
prior to SHIV infection (Fig 2A), contained as many as 10% and 12.6% huCD4+ PBMCs dur-
ing primary untreated infection and after cART withdrawal, respectively. We also observed
expansion in percentage of huCD4+ cells among T cells (S3A Fig) and in huCD4+ T cell num-
bers (S3B Fig). The expansion of CD4CAR+ cells is primarily driven by CAR expressing T cells
as shown in Sup Fig 3A and 3B. During viral rebound, the 4–10 fold higher levels of CAR
marking in C46CD4CAR animals relative to controls was consistent with the 1.5–2 log
decrease in rebound viremia relative to primary infection in these animals (Fig 3C). These data
suggest that CAR-marked cells engraft long term and are capable of antigen-specific expansion
months or years after transplantation.
SHIV-dependent effector differentiation and function of CD4CAR cells
Our in vitro data suggest that expansion of C46CD4CAR cells is specific to HIV/SHIV antigen
(Fig 1). To examine how CAR modified cells respond to SHIV replication in vivo, we moni-
tored the naïve, effector, and memory phenotypes of CAR T cells longitudinally in our trans-
planted animals following SHIV infection. Prior to SHIV infection, huCD4+ (CAR+) and
unmarked T cells (CAR-) shared similar percentages of naïve (CD28+CD95−), effector

became predominantly effector T cells after SHIV infection, consistent with a response to
SHIV antigen. During cART-dependent viral suppression, when the percentage of huCD4+ T
cells contracted, we found that most displayed a naïve or memory phenotype. After cART

 withdrawal, huCD4+ T cells again displayed a predominant effector phenotype. Antigen-
dependent increases in the percentage of effector cells were observed in C46CD4CAR animals,
but not in CD4CARΔzeta controls (Fig 5B–5E).
To investigate if CAR+ effector cells can mediate specific killing of HIV Env expressing
cells, we performed ex vivo killing assays using PBMCs from CAR or control animals during
primary SHIV infection prior to cART treatment and after cART withdrawal (S4A Fig). We
used U1 cells stimulated to express HIV envelope as targets. Notably, this human cell line lacks
rhesus MHC molecules, and therefore should only be killed following CAR-dependent recog-
nition of the HIV envelope. While PBMCs from control animals failed to mediate specific kill-
ing of Env+ U1 cells, PBMCs from CAR animals effectively mediated specific killing of Env+
U1 cells over control U1 cells (S4B and S4C Fig). Interestingly, we observed a trend of an
increase in IFNγ production of cryopreserved T cells from CAR animals in response to SHIV
peptide pool stimulation, suggesting a potential synergy between CAR T cells and anti-SHIV
natural T cell response (S5A–S5C Fig). However, we did not observe a clear difference in pro-
duction of natural anti-SHIV or anti-HIV Env antibody (S6A and S6B Fig). These findings are
consistent with our previous data (Figs 1 and 3), demonstrating that C46CD4CAR HSPC-
derived cells generate a long-lived, functional response to SHIV antigen. Previous CD19 CAR
T cell therapy has been associated with cytokine release syndrome, and the principle cytokines
elevated in patients treated with CD19 CAR T cells were IFNγ and IL-6[20].
To monitor toxicity associated with the CD4CAR HSPCs treatment, we measured plasma
cytokine levels from transplanted CAR and control animals blood collected prior to SHIV
challenge, during untreated SHIV infection, during cART treatment and after cART with-
drawal (S7A Fig). As shown in S7B Fig, most proinflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ, IL-
1β, IL-2, IL-6, MIP1β, MIP1α, MCP1 have mostly undetectable levels or no clear difference
between control and CAR animals (S7C Fig). We observed lower sCD40L levels for CAR con-
trol animals during untreated SHIV infection and after cART, which may be a result of
reduced SHIV-mediated inflammation in CAR animals. Overall, we observed no toxicity asso-
ciated with the CAR transplant as compared to control animals.
Multilineage, antigen-dependent engraftment of C46CD4CAR cells in
tissues
We extended our analysis of C46CD4CAR cells by examining trafficking to multiple tissue
sites, including those that have been characterized as viral reservoirs[21–23]. Both
C46CD4CAR and C46CD4CARΔzeta cells were found in multiple lymphoid tissues, includ-
ing various lymph nodes, gut, and bone marrow (S8 Fig). Similar to PBMCs, CAR animals
had higher percentage of huCD4+ cells among T cells in various tissues as compared to con-
trol animals(S8A Fig). As with huCD4+ PBMC, tissue-associated CAR cells were multiline-
age, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and macrophages/monocytes. There were
no obvious differences in cell composition between C46CD4CAR and C46CD4CARΔzeta
modified cells (S8B–S8E Fig).
To examine the ability of C46CD4CAR cells to protect against SHIV-dependent depletion
of CD4+ cells in the gut, biopsies were taken from the GI tract (colon or duodenum/jejunum)
before SHIV infection and after cART withdrawal, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Control
animals displayed a profound loss of CD4+ cells, both in terms of CD4+CD3+ T cell percentage
(Fig 6A and S9A Fig) and CD4/8 ratio (Fig 6B and S9B Fig). Strikingly, CD4+ T-cell percentage
and CD4/8 ratio were substantially higher in C46CD4CAR animals following cART with-
drawal as compared to the control animals, suggesting that functional CAR cells contributed
to protection of immune homeostasis in this compartment. Furthermore CD4+ effector

 memory T-cells (CD3+CD4+CCR7−CD45RA−), which are major target cells of HIV infection,
were also protected in the gut of C46CD4CAR animals (Fig 6C and S9C Fig).

 (including duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum) was significantly higher in
CAR animals relative to controls (Fig 6D). Interestingly, SHIV RNA measurements in these
tissues showed that CAR containing animals had substantially lower viral loads (Fig 6E).
Although we did not observe significant differences in gene marking in the brain (including
hippocampus, basal ganglia, thalamus, parietal cortex, and cerebellum) between CAR and con-
trol animals, SHIV RNA measurements were also lower in this compartment in CAR animals,
relative to controls (Fig 6D and 6E). In particular, the CAR2 animal had dramatically lower
SHIV mRNA (4–5 logs) across all lymphoid tissues as compared to control animals (S10 Fig).
Collectively, these results demonstrate that C46CD4CAR cells in tissues are capable of long
term, multilineage engraftment, and are protected against SHIV replication, consistent with
our observations in peripheral blood.
Discussion
The seminal case study for HIV cure/remission is the Berlin patient, who received an alloge-
neic, HLA-matched HSPC transplant from a donor homozygous for CCR5Δ32[24], and has
stimulated the search for HSPC-based cure approaches. Allogeneic HSPC transplantation
without CCR5Δ32-protected donor cells in 2 HIV+ recipients initially resulted in undetectable
HIV-1 after patients achieved full donor chimerism; this was likely due to a “graft versus reser-
voir” effect in which donor lymphocytes destroyed latently infected host cells. Ultimately, this
intervention failed to eradicate latently infected cells, which rebounded after cART cessation
[25]. These studies indicated that a combinatorial approach, rendering the blood and immune
system resistant to infection and at the same time harnessing the immune system to attack
infected cells, would be required. Numerous studies have used various gene therapy and gene
editing approaches to genetically modify autologous stem cells, rendering them resistant to
HIV infection[13,14,26–30]. Our nonhuman primate model of suppressed HIV infection is
highly relevant to HIV cure studies in humans, utilizing a virus that is suppressed by a clini-
cally relevant cART regimen, establishment of viral persistence in secondary lymphoid tissues,
and rebound of viral replication following cART withdrawal[11,12]. We have previously
shown that C46-expressing T-cells are protected against CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses,
and support a more robust immune response against infected cells in vivo [14,16]. Here, we
demonstrate that HIV/SHIV-specific CAR cells possess strong antiviral activity even at low
levels. These cells should act as sentinels, generating a robust immune response to reactivated
infected cells months or years after they are introduced, without requiring expression in a high
percentage of immune cells.
The most novel aspect of our approach is the generation of CAR cells from autologous
HSPCs. Stem cell-based expression of CARs contributes a long-lived source of these cells,
capable of providing lifelong immune surveillance against recrudescent virus. In contrast,
adoptive transfer of CAR-modified T-cell products must overcome barriers including immune
exhaustion, limited trafficking to tissues, and lack of functionality at these sites [31,32]. Fur-
thermore, although CD4CAR T-cells persist long term in patients [33], it is unclear whether
persisting cells are capable of responding to increased antigen loads, for example during cART
treatment interruption. Here, we show for the first time in a clinically relevant large animal
model, that autologous transplantation with a CAR-modified HSPC is safe and can be used to
redirect long-term anti-viral immunity. We observed multilineage engraftment of autologous,
gene-modified cells that persisted for almost 2 years. Moreover, we found that CAR-expressing
cells expanded in response to SHIV infection in an antigen-driven fashion, and differentiated
into effector cells in a CD3z domain-dependent manner. Intriguingly, we found that engi-
neered CAR cells contracted during cART treatment during lower levels of antigen expression,

 followed by a rapid expansion after cART withdrawal, mimicking a memory response. As a
result, CAR animals had decreased viremia during post-cART viral rebound, as compared to
control animals. More importantly, we were able to detect CAR cells in multiple lymphoid tis-
sues, including gut-associated lymphoid tissues. CD4+ T-cells at these sites facilitate viral repli-
cation, are significantly depleted during untreated infection, and are slow to regenerate during
cART treatment[34]. We found significantly lowered SHIV mRNA in lymph nodes, gut and
brain from C46CD4CAR animals as compared to control animals. Strikingly, both CAR ani-
mals showed substantially improved CD4/CD8 ratios and higher percentages of CD4+ and
CD4+ effector memory cells in the gut after cART withdrawal, suggesting CD4+ T-cell protec-
tion was C46CD4CAR-dependent.
A small percentage of CAR-modified cells appeared to be sufficient to redirect an effective
immune response against SHIV-infected cells in our study. For both CAR animals, we
observed robust expansion of C46CD4CAR cells after SHIV infection and cART withdrawal,
which was dependent on CD3z signaling. The immediate, memory-like response for CAR cells
after cART withdrawal from both CAR animals likely contributed to improved control of
SHIV viremia and CD4 protection in the gut as compared to control animals. Many of the
same optimization parameters used in T-cell-based CAR products are also applicable to
HSPC-based CAR cells. For example, 2nd and 3rd generation chimeric antigen receptors with
co-stimulatory molecules such as 41BB and/or CD28 [35] may further boost the primary and
secondary responses of HSPC-derived CAR T cells, although the impact of these modifications
on thymopoiesis has not yet been tested. Another novel aspect of our HSPC-based approach is
the generation of CAR cells in lineages other than T-cells (Figs 2 and S3). The contribution of
CAR-expressing cells other than T-cells in our model remains to be determined. While CAR
expressing natural killer cells can contribute to clearance of infected cells[36,37], C46CD4CAR
is likely not functional in other cell types due to the lack of signaling pathway for CD3z[38]. If
necessary, cell type-specific expression of the chimeric antigen receptor from transduced
HSPCs may further improve efficacy and safety.
Our studies clearly demonstrate the potential of using CAR gene therapy in HSPCs to redi-
rect anti-HIV immunity against HIV-1 infection. These results set the stage for future attempts
to eradicate viral infection and provide more effective immune surveillance for HIV, using
optimized CAR vectors and combinatorial approaches, for example with latency reversing
agents and/or additive immunotherapies. Importantly, these findings have broad implications
beyond HIV: additional preclinical studies should be performed to explore HSPC-expressed
CARs against other infectious diseases and cancer in greater detail.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (”The Guide”), and
was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Protocol # 3235–01. All animals were
housed at and included in standard monitoring procedures prescribed by the Washington
National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC). This included at least twice-daily observation
by animal technicians for basic husbandry parameters (e.g., food intake, activity, stool consis-
tency, overall appearance) as well as daily observation by a veterinary technician and/or veteri-
narian. Animals were housed in cages approved by “The Guide” and in accordance with
Animal Welfare Act regulations. Animals were fed twice daily, and were fasted for up to 14
hours prior to sedation. Environmental enrichment included grouping in compound, large

 activity, or run-through connected cages, perches, toys, food treats, and foraging activities. If a
clinical abnormality was noted, standard WaNPRC procedures were followed to notify the vet-
erinary staff for evaluation and determination for admission as a clinical case. Animals were
sedated by administration of Ketamine HCl and/or Telazol and supportive agents prior to all
procedures. Following sedation, animals were monitored according to WaNPRC standard
protocols. WaNPRC surgical support staff are trained and experienced in the administration
of anesthetics and have monitoring equipment available to assist, including monitors of heart
rate, respiration, blood pressure, temperature, and blood oxygenation. Monitors supplied
readily and easily interpretable alerts, including audible alarms, LCD readouts, etc. For minor
procedures, the presence or absence of deep pain was tested by the toe-pinch reflex. The
absence of response (leg flexion) to this test indicates adequate anesthesia for this procedure.
Similar parameters were used in cases of general anesthesia, including the loss of palpebral
reflexes (eye blink). Analgesics were provided as prescribed by the Clinical Veterinary staff for
at least 48 hours after the procedures, and could be extended at the discretion of the clinical
veterinarian, based on clinical signs. Decisions to euthanize animals were made in close con-
sultation with veterinary staff, and were performed in accordance with guidelines as estab-
lished by the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia (2013). Prior to
euthanasia, animals were first rendered unconscious by administration of ketamine HCl.
Autologous transplantation of pigtail macaques
Four juvenile male pigtail macaques were transplanted with autologous, lentivirus modified
HSPCs as previously described [14]. In short, animals were mobilized with granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor (G-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) for 4 days prior to collection of large vol-
ume bone marrow aspirates and bead-based positive selection of CD34+ cells. Over a 48-hour
ex vivo culture period, cells were transduced twice with the lentiviruses indicated in Fig 1 at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 (CAR 1) or 10 (CAR 2, Control 1, Control 2). During
HSPC transduction ex vivo, animals received a myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting
of a fractionated dose of 1020 cGy total body irradiation. Following conditioning, the HSPC
product was infused back into the autologous animal. A small aliquot of the infused cell prod-
uct was plated in Colony Gel Medium (Reach Bio, Seattle, WA) and analyzed as previously
described[14,39]. Individual colonies and total genomic DNA (gDNA) isolated at the indicated
post-transplant time points were measured by gel-based and Taqman-based PCR methods,
respectively, as previously described [14,17].
SHIV infection, cART, and peripheral blood/tissue analyses
Animals were allowed to recover for approximately 200 days prior to infection with SHIV-C,
which was administered to animals via the intravenous challenge route as previously described
[11]. Combination antiretroviral therapy consisted of 20 mg/kg Tenofovir and 40 mg/kg FTC
dosed 1X/day subcutaneous, and 150mg Raltegravir, dosed 2X/day oral with food. Plasma
viral loads, peripheral T-cell counts, longitudinal tissue surgeries, and necropsy tissue collec-
tions were conducted as previously described [12,14]. Taqman-based peripheral blood mea-
surements were performed from gDNA isolated from total leukocytes. Total RNA and gDNA
from tissue samples were isolated using a Precellys 24 homogenizer and CK28-R hard tissue
homogenizing beads (Bertin Corp.) as previously described [12]. Normalized SHIV RNA copy
number in tissue was calculated by normalizing SHIV RNA copy number to the crossing
threshold of macaque RNase P subunit p30 RNA. PCR-based assays for SHIV were designed
not to detect HIV-based lentiviral vectors and average viral loads and log reduction in viral
load were calculated as described previously [12]. Briefly, average viral loads following cART

 withdrawal were calculated by averaging each measurement from the first detection of recru-
descent plasma viremia to the final measurement taken at necropsy (11–13 weekly data
points). Average viral loads before cART were calculated by averaging plasma viremia over the
same number of weekly data points from primary infection, beginning with the first detection
of virus following intravenous SHIV challenge.
Flow cytometry
To detect huCD4+ CAR modified cells, PBMCs and tissue necropsy samples were stained with
the following antibodies: anti-human specific CD4 antibody (for detection and analysis of
CD4CAR modified cells; Beckman Coulter, clone 13B8.2), anti-NHP CD45 (BD Biosciences,
clone D058-1283), anti-CD4 (eBiosciences, clone OKT4), anti-CD8 (eBiosciences, clone SK1),
anti-CD20 (eBiosciences, clone 2H7), anti-NK2Ga (Beckman Coulter, clone A60797), anti-
CD14 (Beckman Coulter, clone IM2707U), anti-CD95 (BD Biosciences, clone DX2), anti-
CD28 (BD Biosciences, clone D28.2), and anti-CD3 (BD Biosciences, clone SP34-2). Fluoro-
phore conjugates included FITC, PE, PE-Cy5, PE-Cy7, alexa700, V500, efluor450, APC, and
APC-efluor780.
Cytokine assay
To test C46CD4CAR cell functions in NHP cells, NHPPBMCs were purified from healthy pig-
tail macaque blood and stimulated with bead bound anti-CD3 (BD Biosciences, clone SP34-2)
and anti-CD28 (BD Biosciences, clone D282.2) for 3 days. Afterwards, cells were transduced
with either C46CD4CAR or C46CD4CARΔzeta lentivirus. 2 days after transduction, cells were
co-incubated with either T1 cells or HIV-infected Sup-T1 cells (AIDSreagent) for 16 hours,
followed by 6 hours of GolgiPlug treatment. Afterwards cells were first surface-stained with
anti-CD3, anti-human CD4 (for detection of CD4CAR transduced cells) and then intracellu-
lar-stained with anti-IFNγ (eBiosciences, clone 4S B3), anti-IL-2 (BD Biosciences, clone MQ1-
17H12) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
To measure natural T cell response to SHIV infection, PBMCs were isolated from trans-
planted pigtail macaque peripheral blood collected during primary SHIV infection prior to
cART treatment, and after cART withdrawal and cryopreserved. Total PBMCs were then
thawed and stimulated with either no stimulation or SIVmac Gag, Pol, tat, nef, vif and HIV
Env peptide pool overnight, followed with 6 hours of GolgiPlug (BD biosciences) incubation.
Afterwards, cells were harvested and stained with anti-NHP CD3, CD4, CD8, huCD4 and
intracellular IFNγ.
In vitro HIV infection
Jurkat cells (clone E6-1, AIDSreagent) were either untransduced or transduced with 2MOI
CD4CAR (without C46) or C46CD4CAR for 2 days and infected with HIV-1NL4.3 (100 ng
p24/106 cells) for 3 days. Afterwards, cells were intracellularly stained with anti-Gag (clone
KC57) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Ex vivo killing assay
PBMCs were isolated from transplanted pigtail macaque peripheral blood collected during pri-
mary SHIV infection prior to cART treatment, and after cART withdrawal. Total PBMC were
co-incubated with unstimulated U1 (HIV latent cell line, Env-) or PMA activated U1 (HIV
Env+) at 3:1, 10:1 and 20:1 ratios for 10 hours. In order to quantify target killing, target cells
were pre-stained with celltrace Vioblue (ThermoFisher Scientific) prior to co-incubation, and

 percent killing was calculated as the percent loss of live celltrace Vioblue+ target cells after co-
incubation with effector PBMC.
Multiplex assay
Plasma was isolated from transplanted pigtail macaque peripheral blood collected during pri-
mary SHIV infection prior to cART treatment, and after cART withdrawal and frozen at -80.
After necropsy, plasma was thawed and 25ul (max) was used to carry out Milliplex none-
human-primate multiplex assay (EMD Millipore) for detection of proinflammatory cytokines
IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP1β, MIP1α, sCD40L, TNFα. Detection range of cytokines
are between 2.44 to 10,000 pg/ml. Data shown was average of 2 replicate wells.
