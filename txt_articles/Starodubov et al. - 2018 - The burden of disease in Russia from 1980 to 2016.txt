Introduction
After episodes of disruption and interim improvements 
in life expectancy at birth in Russia and other former 
Soviet republics in the 1990s, the decade of 2006 to 2016 
was characterised by reductions in mortality from many 
causes of death and a steady improvement in life 
expectancy. These mortality reductions have been 
substantial over the past decade, in many cases reversing 
the trends in increasing mortality that were initiated by 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. These reductions reflect 
changes in social and economic conditions, better health 
policies, and improved outcomes of many diseases.
The purpose of our study was to describe the trends 
in life expectancy, the causes of mortality, and the 
contribution of major risk factors to mortality and 
morbidity in Russia compared with those in selected 
comparator countries from 1990 to 2016. Russia has 
expertise and data on demographic and epidemiological 
trends in the country and, although some of these 
patterns have been presented elsewhere,1–3 the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2016 (GBD 2016) contributes a comprehensive estimation 
of morbidity and mortality by cause, age, and sex, and 
allows benchmarking of these metrics in Russia 
compared with data from other countries. These analyses 
support the development of policy priorities that are 
based on the most up to date and accurate information 
about health, disability, and mortality.
Methods
We focused on the data and analyses from the GBD 2016 
study that quantified mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), 
years lived with disability (YLDs), and life expectancy at 
birth in Russia and comparator countries. Additional 
results from our study and from GBD 2016 can be 
explored with online data visualisation tools and 
downloaded by use of a results query tool. We reported

Summary
Background Over the past few decades, social and economic changes have had substantial effects on health and 
wellbeing in Russia. We aimed to use data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 
(GBD 2016) to evaluate trends in mortality, causes of death, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and associated risk factors in Russia from 1980 to 2016.
Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by use of a multistage modelling process that synthesised data from vital 
registration systems, surveys, and censuses. A composite measure of health loss due to both fatal and non-fatal 
disease burden (DALYs) was calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs for each age, sex, year, and location. Health 
progress was evaluated in comparison with patterns of change in similar countries by use of the Socio-demographic 
Index that was developed for GBD 2016.
Findings Following rapid decreases in life expectancy after the collapse of the Soviet Union, life expectancy at birth in 
Russia improved between 2006 and 2016. The all-cause mortality rate decreased by 16·6% (95% uncertainty interval 
9·4–33·8) between 1980 and 2016. This overall decrease encompasses the cycles of sharp increases and plateaus in 
mortality that occurred before 2005. Child mortality decreased by 57·5% (53·5–61·1) between 2000 and 2016. 
However, compared with countries at similar Socio-demographic Index levels, rates of mortality and disability in 
Russia remain high and life expectancy is low. Russian men have a disproportionate burden of disease relative to 
women. In 2016, 59·2% (55·3–62·6) of mortality in men aged 15–49 years and 46·8% (44·5–49·5) of mortality in 
women were attributable to behavioural risk factors, including alcohol use, drug use, and smoking.
Interpretation Trends in mortality in Russia from 1980 to 2016 might be related to complicated patterns of behavioural 
risk factors associated with economic and social change, to shifts in disease burden, and to changes in the capacity of 
and access to health care. Ongoing mortality and disability from causes and risks amenable to health-care interventions 
and behaviour modifications present opportunities to continue to improve the wellbeing of Russian citizens.

population standards that were developed for the GBD 
study, and each point estimate includes 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs).
Estimates incorporated data from vital registration 
systems, surveys, and censuses; all data sources used in 
this analysis can be explored in detail with the online 
data source tool. Details of the development and 
implementation of GBD methods for addressing 
variation in data quality are published elsewhere.4 The 
cause of death database developed for GBD 2016 was 
used to generate cause-specific estimates of mortality 
rate by location, year, sex, and age for 264 causes of 
death.4 The Cause of Death Ensemble model and 
Bayesian meta-regression were used to generate 
estimates of mortality and morbidity by cause for each 
combination of location, year, age, and sex. Adult 
mortality and mortality of children younger than 5 years 
were 
modelled 
separately. 
In 
conjunction 
with 
established GBD study methods, YLLs were calculated by 
multiplying cause-specific deaths within each age group 
by the normative standard life expectancy at each age. 
Total YLDs were calculated after adjusting for disease 
severity, exclusivity, and comorbidity. All-cause and 
cause-specific disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)—a 
composite measure of health loss due to both fatal and 
non-fatal disease burden—were calculated as the sum of 
YLLs and YLDs for each combination of age, sex, year, 
and location. The GBD study employs a comparative risk 
assessment framework to quantify a set of behavioural, 
environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks by 
use of evidence rules for the inclusion of risk-outcome 
pairs in the analysis. The attributable burden of deaths or 
YLLs for a risk-outcome pair was calculated as the total 
number of deaths or YLLs for that outcome, multiplied 
by the calculated fraction of cases in a population that 
were attributable to a specific exposure. Additional details 
of the GBD 2016 comparative risk assessment and 
attribution methods are published elsewhere.5,6
Changes in life expectancy and causes of death in 
Russia were compared with patterns of change in seven 
comparison countries, which were selected to include 
those with the longest shared borders with Russia 
(Finland, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, China, and Japan) to 
provide regional comparisons, and included Germany 
and the USA to represent other advanced economies. 
GBD 2016 uses the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) to 
compare health progress between locations.4 Because of 
the greater availability and reliability of data on all-cause 
mortality compared with cause-specific mortality, all-
cause mortality and life expectancy estimates are reported 
for 1980–2016, but cause of death analyses are limited to 
1990–2016.

Results
The lowest life expectancy in Russia during 1980–2016 
was estimated to be in 1994, when life expectancy for 
both sexes combined was 63·7 (95% UI 62·5–64·9) years 
(appendix). In 2016, male life expectancy at birth in 
Russia was 65·4 (60·8–70·7) years, but life expectancy at

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched for articles published in PubMed on or before 
Sept 1, 2017, with the search terms “Russia”, “burden”, 
“mortality”, and “health”; relevant papers were translated as 
necessary. Cause-specific mortality and morbidity in Russia 
have been detailed by previous studies, many of which are 
available in Russian language publications or from government 
repositories. Our expertise allowed us to identify and translate 
information from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service, 
and to access Russian language assessments of life expectancy 
and mortality trends, tuberculosis, and the alcohol-related 
burden of disease. These analyses generally evaluated a single 
cause or groups of causes, often focused on specific 
subpopulations by age or sex, and restricted the analytical 
frame to Russia.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first study of Russia to 
comprehensively estimate the frequency of, causes of, and risk 
factors associated with mortality and morbidity by sex and age 
over a long period of time in Russia. By use of standardised 
methods to control for data quality and completeness, 
we facilitated benchmarking of health progress in Russia 
against its regional and socioeconomic peers. To achieve this 
goal, we evaluated 333 causes of death and disability and 
84 risk factors by age, sex, and year between 1980 and 2016.
Implications of all the available evidence
Although the rate of all-cause mortality in Russia remains 
greater than for the other countries in the highest quintile of 
socioeconomic development, life expectancy at birth has now 
returned to the levels observed before the economic and social 
events of the 1990s. Regional similarities in persisting patterns 
of increased mortality associated with behavioural risk factors, 
particularly for men of working age, appear related to 
similarities in political and social contexts that have developed 
since the collapse of the Soviet Union. This work represents a 
first step in understanding the patterns and trends in disease 
burden across Russia by age and by sex. The complexity of 
Russian geography supports the use of this comparative 
evaluation on a national scale as a base onto which more 
detailed subnational investigations can be added.

birth for women reached an historical high of 
76·2 (71·4–80·7) years. This disparity in life expectancy 
between men and women decreased slightly from 
1980 to 2016, from 11·6 years in 1980 to 10·9 years in 
2016. However, this disparity between the sexes remains 
the greatest of any country worldwide.
All-cause, age-standardised rates of DALYs in Russia, 
Kazakhstan, and Ukraine increased sharply and then 
plateaued between 1990 and 1995. DALYs in Russia 
subsequently 
decreased

the

rate 
of 
53 140·5 
(95%

DALYs 
per 
100 000 people in 1994 to 43 056 (34 476·2–53 258·6) 
DALYs per 100 000 people in 2016, representing an 
annualised decline of 3·1% (1·1–4·9; appendix). Similarly, 
the all-cause mortality rate in Russia in 2016 decreased by 
16·6% (9·4–33·8) relative to 1980 levels (appendix). This 
overall decrease in mortality rate was largely driven by 
changes after 2005. Similar to all-cause rates of DALYS, 
all-cause mortality was dominated by sharp increases 
from 1991 to 1994, a plateau, and then a 26·3% (5·2–43·3) 
decrease from 2005 to 2016. Overall rates of mortality in 
Russia in 2016 were between 1·4 and 2·7 times greater 
than rates for the comparator countries that are not 
former Soviet republics.
Annualised rates of change (AROC) of all-cause 
mortality rate were negative for most age groups in most 
time intervals, and the largest decreases were observed 
in children younger than 5 years (figure 1). The notable 
exception to this finding was in the decade following the 
collapse of the Soviet Union (1990–2000), when AROC 
were positive (reflective of the higher mortality rates) for 
all age groups except for children aged 5–9 years and 
boys aged 10–14 years. AROC in this period were notably 
high for men of working age, remaining above 4% for 
age groups between 20 and 54 years and for women 
between 20 and 39 years. In 2010–16, negative AROC 
were shown for all age groups; the maximum AROC in 
this period was a negative rate of change of 3·4% (95% UI 
1·7–4·9) for males younger than 5 years. Most of the 
observed decreases in mortality in children younger 
than 5 years occurred between 2000 and 2016, when 
mortality decreased by 57·5% (53·5–61·1; appendix). 
Between 1980 and 2016, child mortality decreased by 
71·4% (68·7–73·8) in Russia.
Ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease 
were leading causes of YLLs in Russia in 1990 and in 2016 
(figure 2). Self-harm, the third leading cause of YLLs 
in Russia in 2016, was also unchanged in rank order 
from 1990. However, there have been changes in the 
relative rank of the other top 20 causes of YLLs. Cardio-
myopathy (predominantly from alcohol), lower respiratory 
infections, alcohol use disorders, HIV
/AIDS, colorectal 
cancer, drug use disorders, breast cancer, cirrhosis 
from alcohol, Alzheimer’s disease, and tuberculosis all 
increased in their relative contribution to YLLs by more 
than two rank positions between 1990 and 2016. Among

the leading causes of YLLs, the largest decreases in age-
standardised rates of YLLs between 1990 and 2016 were 
reported for stomach cancer (51·3%, 95% UI 34·0–65·2), 
drowning (46·4%, 28·3–61·3), COPD (45·0%, 25·9–60·8), 
and lung cancer (36·9%, 13·2–56·8). Between 1990 and 
2016, the greatest increases in age-standardised rates 
of YLLs were observed for HIV
/AIDS (448·4 years, 
395·3–510·9) and cirrhosis and other chronic liver 
diseases due to alcohol use (217·7 years, 122·7–348·6). 
The leading 20 sources of YLDs in Russia in 2016 were 
mostly non-communicable diseases, including alcohol 
use disorder and drug use disorder, except for falls 
(third leading source of YLDs), road injuries (14th), and 
mechanical forces (20th; appendix).
In Russia in 2016, YLL rates from the leading 20 causes 
were higher in men than in women for all causes except 
for breast cancer, cirrhosis from causes other than alcohol 
or hepatitis C, and Alzheimer’s disease (figure 3). The 
ratio of YLLs by men to YLLs by women was skewed most 
strongly towards men for lung cancer, in whom the rate 
of YLLs in 2016 was 1197·6 (95% UI 806·1–1635·9) YLLs 
per 100 000 people, which was 7·4 times the equivalent 
rate for women. This ratio was similarly skewed towards 
men in Ukraine and Kazakhstan; however, in other 
comparator countries, YLLs for lung cancer were not as 
strongly skewed by men. In Russia, rates of YLLs in men 
from self-harm, drug use disorders, alcohol use disorders, 
COPD, environmental heat and cold, and falls were all 
more than four times the equivalent rates in women in 
2016. Other than COPD in Kazakhstan, where YLLs in 
men were 2·9 times greater than those in women, these 
sex-specific patterns of YLLs were broadly similar to those 
in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. With a few exceptions, 
disparities between YLLs by men and women were 
greater in Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan than other 
comparator countries.

In 2016, 53·4% (95% UI 48·7–57·8) of deaths in Russia 
were attributable to behavioural risk factors, 48·5% 
(45·1–51·7) were attributable to metabolic risks, and 
8·2% (7·2–9·3) were attributable to environmental and 
occupational risks (appendix). In both sexes (of all ages), 
high systolic blood pressure was the leading risk factor 
(figure 4) and was responsible for 32·7% (28·4–36·7) of 
deaths in Russia in 2016. These deaths were mostly 
due to the resulting cardiovascular disease. For males, 
smoking was the second most common risk factor and 
was responsible for 24·1% (21·7–26·5) of deaths, 
followed in attributable burden by alcohol use, which 
was responsible for 18·2% (13·6–22·6) of deaths and was 
a factor in several leading causes of death in Russia 
(figure 4). For females, high total cholesterol was the 
second most common risk factor and was associated with 
23·2% (16·4–30·7) of deaths, and high body-mass index 
was the third most common risk factor and was 
associated with 19·0% (12·4–25·4) of deaths (figure 4). 
Behavioural risk factors were particularly relevant to the 
mortality of adults aged 15–49 years and were associated 
with 59·2% (95% UI 55·3–62·6) of deaths in males and 
46·8% (44·5–49·5) of deaths in females (figure 4) in 2016. 
For males in this age group, alcohol use as a risk factor 
was responsible for 34·4% (29·5–38·6) of deaths in 
2016 versus 20·1% (17·1–23·4) of deaths in females. In 
comparison, the highest attributions of deaths to alcohol 
use among comparator countries for males in this age 
group were in Ukraine, where alcohol was associated with 
33·1% (28·5–37·9) of deaths; Kazakhstan, where it is was 
associated with 25·4% (19·7–31·2) of deaths; and Finland, 
where it was associated with 21·5% (16·0–27·4) of deaths 
(appendix). Of deaths in males aged 15–49 years in Russia 
in 2016, cardio 
vascular disease attributed to alcohol use 
comprised 9·1% (7·5–11·0) of deaths, alcohol-attributed 
transport injury comprised 2·6% (1·6–3·9) of deaths, 
alcohol-attributed self-harm and violence comprised 
8·1% (5·6–11·0) of deaths, and mental and substance use 
disorders attributed to alcohol comprised 6·1% (5·3–7·0) of 
deaths (figure 4).
In Russia in 2016, increases in the ratio of observed to 
expected YLLs (based on SDI level) exceeded 4:1 for 
cardiomyopathy (observed to expected ratio 7·14), alcohol 
use disorders (10·34), interpersonal violence (4·39), 
HIV
/AIDS (19·52), drug use disorders (7·24), and 
tuberculosis (12·90; figure 5). In comparator countries in 
2016, this ratio exceeded 4:1 for alcohol use dis 
orders (7·71), 
HIV
/AIDS (17·96), drug use disorders (4·27), and 
tuberculosis (6·47) in Ukraine; tuberculosis (4·62) in 
Kazakhstan; alcohol use disorders (4·86) in Finland; and 
for HIV
/AIDS (4·07) and drug use disorders (7·33) in the 
USA. By contrast, the ratio of observed to expected YLLs 
in Russia in 2016 had decreased relative to that of 1990 for 
stroke; road injuries; tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer; 
colon and rectal cancer; stomach cancer; congenital birth 
defects; drowning; and COPD.
Discussion
As with other former Soviet republics, cycles of decreasing 
and increasing life expectancy and mortality rates 
occurred in Russia in the years following the dissolution 
of the Soviet Union. During the 1990s and 2000s, social 
and economic turmoil produced an acute mortality 
crisis in former Soviet republics. Several potential causes 
for this mortality crisis and its subsequent echoes have 
been suggested.7–9 Stress associated with the transition 
from Soviet economies to capitalism has been linked 
with an increased risk of circulatory diseases, which

are exacerbated by increased alcohol consumption as a 
behavioural response to stress.10 This interpretation is 
supported by the rapid recovery of life expectancy in the 
Baltic states during the late 1990s11 while life expectancy 
in Russia continued to be affected by political and 
social upheavals, such as the economic crisis of 1998. 
Behavioural risk factors such as alcohol use and smoking, 
and metabolic risk factors including high systolic blood 
pressure, high total cholesterol, and high body-mass 
index continue to contribute strongly to the burden of 
disease in Russia. The loss of effective public health 
interventions through successive changes to health 
policies probably interacted with cultural and economic 
factors to magnify the effects of socioeconomic transition 
on mortality.
Economic and social turmoil often increase the mortality 
of infants and the elderly,12 yet we did not observe this 
pattern in Russia. Mortality rates decreased for older 
adults and for those younger than 20 years, particularly 
children younger than 5 years since 2000, in conjunction 
with continuing declines in mortality from both maternal 
and neonatal disorders. Probable explanations for these 
patterns include the success of the acute care system 
in reducing deaths from infectious disease and deaths 
occurring in infancy,13 the previous success of the Soviet 
health system in many of its efforts to reduce com-
municable diseases and set up comprehensive childhood 
vaccination programmes, and improvements in care for 
many aspects of cardiovascular disease that have lessened 
adverse outcomes for older patients.13,14
In contrast to decreases in mortality for older adults 
and children younger than 5 years, we found that 
mortality rates in Russian adults increased from 1990 to 
2000, particularly in men aged 20–34 years. One of the 
most notable characteristics of the mortality patterns in 
Russia in the past 36 years is the high mortality rates in 
men who are of working age. Rapid increases in death 
rates at working age in Russia, particularly in men, have 
been linked to socioeconomic upheaval following the 
dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1989 and the economic 
crisis in 2008.14 Across the leading causes of premature 
mortality in Russia, the burden for men remains greater 
than that for women, most notably in the case of lung 
cancer and alcohol-related conditions (which have 
mirrored the cycling patterns of mortality of the post-
Soviet era) but also for self-harm, drug use, COPD, and 
falls. The prevalence of smoking in women in Russia is 
low, particularly relative to its prevalence in men,15 which 
is reflected in the extent of the disparity in burden 
between the sexes from associated diseases; for example, 
in 2016, mortality from lung cancer (rates of which were 
12 times higher in men) and cardiovascular diseases 
(rates of which were six times higher in men than 
women) were both higher in men. In Russia, as in most 
countries, women tend to live longer than men, albeit 
with higher levels of disability in both absolute and 
relative terms.
When ranked by SDI, Russia is 33rd globally, which 
is within the highest quintile of scores among countries. 
Despite the potential suggested by this ranking, pre-
mature mortality in 2016 from several leading causes 
(such as tuberculosis, alcohol use disorders, and HIV
/
AIDS) was more than ten times greater than expected 
based on SDI alone. Clear direct links exist between 
alcohol and causes of death such as alcohol poisoning, 
liver cirrhosis, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and stroke.16 
Alcohol use is also a behavioural component of other 
causes of death; many types of injuries and violence are 
associated with inebriation17,18 and connections between 
alcohol use, drug use, and infectious disease such as 
tuberculosis and HIV
/AIDS are well known.19 We have 
found increases in mortality from HIV
/AIDs in Russia 
between 1990 and 2016 that were relatively unaffected by 
the cycles of mortality correlated with economic upheaval 
that were observed for other causes of death. The con-
tinuing increase in mortality associated with HIV
/AIDS 
in Russia has been attributed to unsafe sex20 and to drug 
use,21 with both causes exacerbated by the cultural context 
of alcohol use.19 Certain populations, such as individuals 
with tuberculosis, could also be more vulnerable to 
negative health outcomes caused by the interaction 
of physiological and behavioural components of heavy 
alcohol use.22 Prison populations, in particular, serve as a 
nexus for the transmission of HIV
/AIDS, viral hepatitis, 
and tuberculosis; the prevalence of multidrug resistant 
tuberculosis in prisons of post-Soviet states is estimated 
to be 16 times the worldwide prevalence.23 Migrant worker 
populations are another vulnerable population because 
they can lack access to health care.24 
In a widely cited retrospective case-control study25 in 
Russia (that was supported by a subsequent prospective 
observational study26), Zaridze and colleagues reported 
that, of those aged 15–54 years, 59% of deaths in men 
and 33% of deaths in women were attributable to 
alcohol. By contrast, our study estimated that, of those 
aged 15–49 years, 34·4% (29·5–38·6) of deaths in 
males and 20·1% (17·1–23·4) of deaths in females were 
attributable to alcohol. There are several probable 
reasons for the disparity in these estimates. Participants 
in the retro 
spective case-control study were recruited 
from urban locations in Siberia where heavy drinking 
might be more prevalent than elsewhere in Russia. 
Additionally, the study by Zaridze and colleagues25 
used an implausibly high level of relative risk for 
injuries, 
contributing 
to 
the 
higher 
estimated 
attributable deaths than our study. GBD 2016 estimated 
the relative risk across outcomes from alcohol use 
from a meta-analysis of prospective cohorts that 
encompassed 336 000 individuals to derive continuous 
relative risks and included systematic controls for 
likely confounding variables.6
Russia (together with other former Soviet republics, 
particularly Ukraine) continues to be among the countries 
with the highest alcohol-related mortality globally; the

contribution of drug use disorders to mortality in 
Russia also remains at high levels. After the introduction 
of restrictive alcohol policies in the 1980s, reductions 
in mortality from causes attributable to alcohol were 
observed, and the more recent decreases in alcohol-
related mortality can be similarly correlated with public 
health measures that were introduced in the mid-2000s.27 
Our results document substantial trend reversals in rates 
of mortality from alcoholic cardiomyopathy, self-harm, 
alcohol use and drug use disorders, and cirrhosis due to 
alcohol in the last decade. These improvements have not 
fully ameliorated the mortality peaks that occurred in the 
mid-1990s and mid-2000s, however, and despite these 
recent decreases, mortality rates attributable to alcohol 
and drug use remain higher for Russia than for other 
countries at comparable levels of development. The 
substantial role of alcohol and drug abuse in premature 
mortality in Russia is both avoidable and demonstrably 
responsive to national policy.
In contrast to successes that have improved the trends 
in morbidity and mortality related to alcohol use, the 
prevalence of smoking in Russia remains high and 
increases in smoking have been noted for women.15 
Simultaneously, taxes on tobacco in Russia remain among 
the lowest in the world.28 Ross and colleagues28 found that 
the higher taxes collected in countries such as Poland and 
Ukraine since the early 1990s have contributed to higher 
rates of smoking cessation in those countries compared 
with Russia. As with alcohol use, policies are available that 
could lead to decreased smoking prevalence and a 
reduction in the overall burden of disease; such policies 
include increased taxes on tobacco, education on health 
outcomes, improved access to cessation treatments, and 
restrictions on public consumption. Legislative measures29 
that started in 2010 hold promise for reducing Russia’s 
tobacco burden. Additionally, the government has been 
recognised by WHO for implementing substantive 
policies towards monitoring tobacco use and prevention.30
Limitations of our study include those described 
for the whole GBD 2016 study.4 Despite robust vital 
registration data, information on morbidity and health 
outcomes associated with risk factors are comparatively 
limited for Russia; specifically, inpatient and outpatient 
hospital data from Russia were not available for the 
GBD 2016 study. Because of the uncertainty associated 
with the evidence used to quantify the risks associated 
with different patterns of alcohol use (such as binge 
drinking), we assumed uniform consumption of alcohol 
across the year; greater measurement of the effects of 
episodic consumption (both in prospective studies and 
surveys that evaluate consumption) are required before 
this effect can be considered for incorporation into the 
GBD study. Additionally, GBD 2016 estimated mortality 
and morbidity in Russia at the national level. Due to its 
large geography and population, health patterns in 
Russia have substantial diversity that would be better 
captured by subnational estimation.
Despite 
substantial 
improvements 
across 
many 
maternal and neonatal sources of mortality between 1980 
and 2016, some communicable diseases, particularly 
the nexus of HIV
/AIDS and tuberculosis and their inter-
action with substance use disorders, have shown less 
improvement. The association between mortality, alcohol, 
and social stress is notable for its enduring role in trends 
in the burden of disease in Russia. Mortality from causes 
amenable to health care or behavioural modification, 
such as hypertension, cerebro 
vascular disease, smoking, 
and alcohol-related disease, remains high, indicating a 
substantial scope for future improvements in health in
