Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in men worldwide. The relationships between PC and
possible risk factors for PC cases (n 5 1,181) and male controls (n 5 875) from the New South Wales (NSW) Cancer, Life-
style and Evaluation of Risk Study (CLEAR) were examined in this study. The associations between PC risk and paternal
history of PC, body mass index (BMI), medical conditions, sexual behaviour, balding pattern and puberty, after adjusting
for age, income, region of birth, place of residence, and PSA testing, were examined. Adjusted risk of PC was higher for
men with a paternal history of PC (OR 5 2.31; 95%CI: 1.70–3.14), personal history of prostatitis (OR 5 2.30; 95%CI:
1.44–3.70), benign prostatic hyperplasia (OR 5 2.29; 95%CI: 1.79–2.93), being overweight (vs. normal; OR 5 1.24;
95%CI: 0.99–1.55) or obese (vs. normal; OR 5 1.44; 95%CI: 1.09–1.89), having reported more than seven sexual part-
ners in a lifetime (vs. < 3 partners; OR 5 2.00; 95%CI: 1.49–2.68), and having reported more than 5 orgasms a month
prior to PC diagnosis (vs. �3 orgasms; OR 5 1.59; 95%CI: 1.18–2.15). PC risk was lower for men whose timing of puber-
ty was later than their peers (vs. same as peers; OR 5 0.75; 95%CI: 0.59–0.97), and a smaller risk reduction of was
observed in men whose timing of puberty was earlier than their peers (vs. same as peers; OR 5 0.85; 95%CI: 0.61–
1.17). No associations were found between PC risk and vertex balding, erectile function, acne, circumcision, vasectomy,
asthma or diabetes. These results support a role for adult body size, sexual activity, and adolescent sexual development
in PC development.

 Introduction
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common non-cutaneous
cancer in men worldwide, with incidence having dramatically
risen in developed countries since the introduction of pros-
tate specific antigen (PSA) testing.1 Internationally, age stand-
ardised PC incidence rates are highest in Australia and New
Zealand (111.6 new cases per 100,000).2
Although the aetiology of PC is unclear, there is strong
evidence that PC risk increases with advancing age, family
history and African ancestry and, possibly, with a history of
prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and obesity.3–7
Other possible risk factors include the timing of puberty
onset, vertex balding pattern and sexual activity8–14
Prostate carcinogenesis is associated with altered androgen
metabolism, where increased risk is associated with increased
production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the active metabo-
lite of testosterone.15 Some of these possible risk factors for
PC are also associated with androgen activity, for example,
(i) the onset of puberty is associated with elevated androgen
levels which have growth promoting effects on the pros-
tate,16,17 (ii) balding is associated with elevated levels of
androgen receptors and DHT, where inhibition of the latter
can stop the progression of balding and even lead to hair
regrowth,18,19 (iii) obesity is associated with elevated aroma-
tase activity, which converts testosterone to estradiol, thus
lowering testosterone levels and consequently DHT produc-
tion,15,20 and (iv) sexual function and desire are associated
with high testosterone levels.21 These associations support an
underlying role for androgen regulation in the initiation of
PC.13,21
The current study examines the associations between PC
incidence and a number of potential risk factors for PC,
including some androgenic factors such as timing of puberty,
balding pattern, body mass index (BMI), and sexual activity,
in the New South Wales (NSW) Cancer, Lifestyle and Evalu-
ation of Risk Study (CLEAR).
Methods
Study population
The NSW CLEAR study is an all incident cancer case-control
study of NSW residents aged 18 years and over. Approxi-
mately 75% of case participants were identified through ‘tar-
geted’ recruitment sources using medical or health related
databases, that provided lists of potential cases who were
diagnosed with any cancer type in the preceding 18 months.
The remaining case participants were recruited through ‘non-
targeted’ sources including participants who responded to
widespread promotion at community events, and face-to-face
recruitment at participating oncology clinic rooms. All poten-
tial participants were mailed an invitation to participate in
the CLEAR study, and were each asked, “What is your cancer
type”, with prostate cancer listed as an option to choose
from. For this analysis we excluded (i) anyone who reported
another cancer diagnosis (other than cutaneous keratinocyte
cancer) before their diagnosis of prostate cancer or that of
their spouse case (for controls), or (ii) was aged younger
than 18 years, or (iii) was diagnosed with cancer >18 months
ago prior to recruitment. We have referred to all our cases as
‘self-reported’ prostate cancer cases, as they also represented
the 25% of participants who were recruited from sites where
databases of histopathologically confirmed cancer were not in
use.
CLEAR recruited 10,796 participants (8556 cancer cases
and 2240 cancer-free partner controls) between 2006 and
2014. Only men with a self-reported diagnosis of prostate
cancer were included as cases in the current analysis. Control
participants were cancer-free (except for cutaneous keratino-
cyte cancers) male partners of women who were cases in the
study. Details of the study methods, recruitment strategy and
study rationale have been published elsewhere.22
CLEAR was approved by St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney
Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 07/SVH/106,
20.12.07), and this analysis was approved by the NSW Popu-
lation & Health Services Research Ethics Committee (HREC/
14/CIPHS/36; HREC/11/CIPHS/52).
Data collection
All consenting participants were asked to complete a self-
administered paper questionnaire or online questionnaire
(available from 2010); 4.6% of participants to whom it was
available completed the online questionnaire. Information
collected included paternal history of PC, income, region of
birth, anthropometric measures, lifestyle, timing of reaching
puberty, sexual activity, medical history, and history of PSA
testing. The residential Accessibility Remoteness Index of
Australia (ARIA plus), which was derived from residential
postcode, was used to classify each participants’ place of
residence.23
Data analysis
Participants’ demographic characteristics were categorised as
follows: Age was derived from age at diagnosis for cases and
What’s new?
Many risk factors have individual associations with prostate cancer including age, obesity and family history. Here the authors
formally examined the independent and interactive effects of a range of risk factors in the development of prostate cancer.
The findings support a role for indicators of adult body size, sexual activity, and adolescent sexual development, supporting
the concept that risk determinants early in life can influence prostate cancer development later on.

Routine PSA testing (Yes, No or Do not know) was based on
participants’ responses to a series of questions on current
and past PSA testing history excluding PSA tests in the year
before diagnosis for cases. Risk factors for PC were derived
and categorised as follows: History of Prostatitis (Yes, No)
and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) (Yes, No) were
derived from responses to a list of conditions. Responses to
questions on family history of various cancers were used to
derived Paternal history of PC (Yes, or No).
Pubertal
development
was
based
on
participants’
responses to the questions on timing of commencing shaving
and timing of voice break (Later than peers, Same as peers
(reference category), Earlier than peers, Non-respondents).
Responses to both questions were combined to derive a new
variable called “Timing of reaching puberty” which consisted
of the following three groups: those who reached at least one
of these time points earlier than their peers were grouped as
“Earlier than peers”, those remaining who reached at least
one of these time points later than their peers were grouped
as “Later than peers” and those still remaining were grouped
as “Same time as peers”, and, finally, those who did not give
informative responses to both questions were grouped as
“Non-respondents”.
Body Mass Index (BMI), was calculated as weight (kg)/
[height (m)]2 using self-reported weight and height before PC
diagnosis for cases, or partners’ cancer diagnosis for controls,
and classified into specified groups established by the World
Health Organisation.24 The number of those in the under-
weight category (�18.5 kg/m2) was small (n 5 8) and therefore
was combined with those with a normal BMI. Three categories
were formed: Normal/underweight (<25 kg/m2-reference),
Overweight (25 to <30 kg/m2) and Obese (�30 kg/m2).24
Height and weight, divided into respective quartiles, were also
examined for each of their associations with PC risk.
Each participant was asked to self-assess their hair balding
pattern before their or their partner’s diagnosis, using images
from the Hamilton-Norwood scale of male balding patterns
showing – Full head of hair (reference category), Frontal
balding, Vertex balding and combined Vertex and Frontal
balding.11
Participants were asked to recall their lifetime number of
sexual partners (0–2 (reference), 3 to 7 and >7 partners),
Age at first sexual intercourse (<17, 17–19, 20–22 and >22
years(reference)), Frequency of orgasms per month, before
case’s diagnosis or partner’s diagnosis for controls, (0–3 (ref-
erence), 4–5, >5) and Ability to maintain erection (Low (ref-
erence), Moderate, High). Participants who preferred not to
answer
any
of
these
questions
were
grouped
as
non-
respondents.
Participants were
also
asked
if they
were
diagnosed with other suspected risk factors for prostate can-
cer such as asthma, diabetes, or had a vasectomy, circumci-
sion or facial acne scarring.
Statistical analysis
We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for a complete
case analysis, where all missing responses for variables in this
study, were excluded. Based on relevant published evidence,
odds ratios were firstly adjusted for age at diagnosis, place of
residence, income, region of birth and paternal history of
PC.11–13 This level of adjustment is referred to as “Adjusted”1
in Tables 2 and 3. Odds ratios were simultaneously adjusted
for timing of puberty, BMI, and lifetime number of sexual
partners, where appropriate, as each of these factors involve
androgen metabolism making them potential confounders of
each other’s effects;16–21 to our knowledge this level of adjust-
ment has not been performed in other studies (each level of
adjustment is shown in Table 4). The interactions between
the main exposures of interest were assessed by including
appropriate interaction terms in the regression models.
We carried out the following sensitivity analyses for the
association between PC risk and known risk factors for PC
(prostatitis, BPH, paternal history of PC): (i) using only
NSW Cancer Registry (NSWCR) confirmed PC cases and
cancer-free controls, for all those who were recruited until
December 2009, as cancer registrations in NSW were only
complete until December 2009 at the time of analysis, (ii)
cancer-free male controls who were partners of women diag-
nosed with breast cancer were excluded (to allow for the pos-
sibility
that
women’s
screening
for
breast
cancer
was
associated with more PSA testing in their partners), (iii) men
classified as “underweight” BMI were excluded to assess
whether combining underweight and normal BMI categories
affected results, and (iv) men who reported not having any
treatment for their cancer were excluded to allow for the pos-
sibility that sexual bother after treatment would bias the self-
report of sexual activity. To assess whether our results were
affected by the higher proportion of cases being without a
partner compared to controls, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis restricting the analyses to cases and controls who at
the time of completing the questionnaire were married, living
with a partner or in a de facto relationship.
All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (32) English.
Results
CLEAR recruited 10,796 participants (8556 cancer cases and
2240 cancer-free partner controls) between 2006 and 2014.
The average response rate for potential cases across targeted
sites was 25.4% while that for controls was 48.6%.22 There
were 1388 eligible PC cases and 1059 cancer-free male con-
trols. Of these, 1181 cases and 875 controls provided suffi-
cient data to be included in the current analysis.
Cases were older than controls, with median ages 65.6
years and 59.0 years respectively. After adjusting for age,

report routine PSA testing (OR 5 2.85; 95%CI: 2.23–3.64;
Table 1). There were no significant differences between cases
and controls in terms of income or region of birth.
Paternal history of PC, prostatitis and BPH were associat-
ed with PC risk (Table 2). Restricting the analysis to only
NSWCR-confirmed PC cases and cancer-free male controls
and, separately, to controls for whom the partner’s index
cancer was not breast cancer, did not appreciably change the
strength of these associations (results not shown).
Compared with men who reached the following mile-
stones at the same time as their peers, men who started shav-
ing regularly later than their peers (OR 5 0.72 95%CI: 0.56–
0.92) were at lower risk of being diagnosed with PC, and
those whose voice broke later than (OR 5 0.73 95%CI: 0.51–
1.04) or earlier than (OR 5 0.71 95%CI: 0.48–1.07) their
peers, were at lower risk of being diagnosed with PC,
although the evidence for this is weak (Table 3). With respect
to “Timing of reaching puberty” which is a combination of
both these variables, showed the risk of developing PC was
lower for men who reached these milestones later than their
peers (vs. same as peers; OR 5 0.75; 95%CI: 0.59–0.97), and a
smaller risk reduction was observed for men whose timing of
puberty was earlier than their peers (vs. same as peers;
OR 5 0.85; 95%CI: 0.61–1.17), although the confidence inter-
val suggests a lower degree of certainty in the latter estimate.
The highest risk was for those in the non-respondents cate-
gory, for all three variables.

 Men classified as overweight (OR 5 1.24: 95%CI: 0.99–
1.55) were at higher risk of PC, while those classified as obese
(OR 5 1.44: 95%CI: 1.09–1.89) were at highest risk of PC,
compared to normal/underweight men. Excluding those who
were underweight from the normal/underweight reference
group did not appreciably change the estimated odds ratio.
Successive quartiles of height (ptrend 50.29; Table 3) and
weight (ptrend 5 0.71; data not shown) were not associated
with PC risk.
Having >7 sexual partners in a lifetime was positively
associated with PC risk compared to men that have <3 sexu-
al partners in their lifetime (OR 5 2.00; 95%CI: 1.49–2.68). A
similar adjusted odds ratio was obtained in a sensitivity anal-
ysis excluding men who reported receiving no cancer treat-
ment (OR 5 1.76; 95%CI: 1.30–2.38; data not shown). Men
who reported commencing sexual intercourse before 17 years
of age were at higher risk of PC (OR5 1.68; 95%CI: 1.18–
2.40), than those who were older than 22 years of age.
Risk of PC was also highest for those who reported having
>5 orgasms per month in the period just prior to PC diag-
nosis (OR 5 1.59; 95%CI: 1.18–2.15) than for men who
reported 3 or less orgasms. There was no evidence of an
association with increasing levels of erectile function and PC
risk. Non-respondents to the question on erectile function
(OR 5 0.60; 95%CI: 0.42–0.87) and that relating to frequency
of orgasms (OR 5 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51–0.95), had lower odds
of PC, which may indicate that healthy men may be less
inclined to report these indicators of male virility than are
men who have been diagnosed with PC. Balding pattern was
not associated with PC risk (p 5 0.78).
Additionally adjusting the odds ratios of timing of puber-
ty, BMI, and lifetime number of sexual partners for potential
confounding by each of these factors, where appropriate, did
not appreciably change the respective odds ratios (Table 4).
There was no substantial evidence for two-way interactions
between any pairs of risk factors included in Tables 2 and 3
(Pinteraction >0.1 in all instances).
Restricting all analyses to only cases (n 5 965) and con-
trols (n 5 860) who are married or who are living with a
partner or who are in a de facto relationship, did not appre-
ciably change the point estimates of ORs (Supplementary
Tables S1, S2, S3, S4).
We found no significant associations between PC risk and
having ever smoked (OR5 1.09; 95%CI:0.90–1.32), asthma
(OR 5 0.91;
95%CI:0.66–1.25),
diabetes
(OR 5 0.73;
95%CI:0.53–1.10), vasectomy (OR5 1.05; 95%CI:0.85–1.31),
circumcision (OR 5 0.96; 95%CI:0.77–1.19) and facial acne
scarring (OR 5 0.88; 95%CI:0.61–1.27), after adjusting for
age; data not shown.
Discussion
In addition to a paternal history of PC and histories of pros-
tatitis and BPH, we found the risk of being diagnosed with
PC to be positively associated with higher levels of sexual
activity and elevated BMI. There was weak evidence that ado-
lescent sexual development may also be a predictor of PC
risk, where risk was lower for men who reached puberty later
or earlier, than their peers, when compared with men who
reached puberty at the same time as their peers. We found
no association between PC risk and hair balding pattern.

Prostate cancer risk factors
Int. J. Cancer: 140, 565–574 (2017) V
C 2016 UICC
 There was no evidence for interactions between the possible
risk factors for PC that operate from early in life and the
other factors studied, that may affect a man’s subsequent risk
of prostate cancer, although our study may have been limited
by statistical power to detect any such interactions
A recent meta-analysis of prospective studies and another
by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) have con-
firmed that BMI is a risk factor for PC.27,28 They reported an
inverse association between BMI and PC risk among men
with low-risk, localised disease, but BMI was positively asso-
ciated among men with advanced disease. Similar patterns of
association by disease aggressiveness were also reported in
the
15-year
follow-up
of
The
Melbourne
Collaborative
Cohort Study (MCCS) but not in the Cancer of the Prostate
in Sweden study (CPS) participants.29,30 Although we found
an increased risk of PC among overweight and obese men,
this was without regard to the aggressiveness of their cancer
as we did not have this information. We found no associa-
tions between height or weight, and PC risk in the CLEAR
participants. In contrast, the MCCS reported an inverse asso-
ciation between height and PC risk in participants with
aggressive disease, and a positive association in participants
with non-aggressive disease.29 WCRF also reported an associ-
ation between increasing height and greater overall PC risk
while the CPS reported that the increase in risk was only for
men with low-intermediate risk disease; they found no
increasing risk of aggressive or fatal disease.30 Conversely, a
nested case control study in the ProtecT trial reported an
association between increasing height and increased risk of
advanced PC.31 There were slight variations in disease classi-
fication between these studies; the MCCS and CPS included
all men with a Gleason score > 7 as men with aggressive dis-
ease, whereas the ProtecT trial also included those with a
Gleason score 7 in their advanced disease category.
The role of sexual activity in the aetiology of PC is unlike-
ly to be straight forward due to the multifaceted aspects of
sexual activity. We found an association of increasing PC risk
for increasing number of sexual partners and decreasing risk
for age at first sexual intercourse. A meta-analysis of case
control studies, by Dennis et al reported a positive associa-
tion between increasing number of sexual partners and can-
cer risk (RR 5 1.2; 95%CI:1.1–1.3), although a recent study
by Spence et al showed a reduced risk of PC with more sexu-
al partners (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–1.00).10,32 Dennis et al
also reported no association with age at first intercourse, but
two other case control studies have shown that PC risk was
higher for those who commenced sexual activity in their
teenage

 later.3,10,33 Results from the MCCS reported no association
between PC risk and frequency of sex but found an inverse
association between PC risk and number of ejaculations. We
observed no association with erectile function but a positive
association between frequency of orgasms and PC risk.
Previous evidence to support a role for pubertal develop-
ment in PC risk is limited and unclear. Although our finding
that pubertal growth spurt later than peers was protective
against prostate carcinogenesis, is similar to that reported by
another Australian-based case control study, we also observed
a non-significant risk reduction of similar magnitude for men
who experienced early onset of puberty.11,12,14 The lack of
statistical significance for the early onset group might be due
to the smaller numbers in this group, noting that the propor-
tions in each category for pubertal development in CLEAR
(12.1% earlier than peers, 56.6 same as peers, and 23.5% later
than peers) are similar to those reported by the Melbourne
Collaborative Cohort Study (12.8% earlier than peers, 69.2%
same as peers and 18.8% later than peers) and by Giles et al
in the Australian Case Control Study (12.6% earlier than
peers, 68.6% same as peers and 18.8% later than peers).
Regardless the non-significant protective effect for the early
onset group in CLEAR is consistent with the results of a US-
based case control study which showed no difference in the
mean ages for commencing shaving between PC cases and
controls,9 or those from the 19-year follow-up of men from
the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program which reported
no overall association between age at shaving initiation and
PC risk.9
Balding pattern is a potential non-modifiable risk factor
for PC, with highest risk reported for men with vertex bald-
ing.8,11 Results from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovar-
ian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) showed no overall
increased PC risk for men with frontal plus moderate vertex
balding at age 45 years, but they were at �40% higher risk of
developing aggressive disease, compared with men with a full
head of hair.25 The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study
(MCCS) showed that men with vertex balding at age 40 years
had a higher risk of early onset PC, but a lower risk of late
onset PC, compared with men without vertex balding at 40
years of age; risk of PC was similar for men with and without
vertex balding between ages 60 and 70 years, suggesting that
it is important to report age of balding when addressing its
effect on PC risk.26 The lack of such an association in our
study, may partly be explained by the absence of information
on age of onset for balding which we did not collect.

Prostate cancer risk factors

C 2016 UICC
 PC development is strongly associated with alterations in
androgen metabolism and production of DHT, the active
metabolite of testosterone.20 Each of these factors that we
have shown to be associated with PC risk, have the potential
to alter androgen metabolism. Levels of androgen receptors
and testosterone are elevated during the onset of puberty,15,34
which impact the development, maturation, and maintenance
of the prostatic gland, consequently affecting both prolifera-
tion and differentiation in the luminal epithelium.15,34 Bald-
ing pattern and PC share common risk factors, such as
ageing and genetics, and both factors are hormonally-
regulated by DHT. Bald men have higher levels of DHT
within the hair follicles and its blockage helps to slow the
progression of baldness.35 Androgen metabolism is altered in
obese men due to elevated aromatase activity, which can con-
vert testosterone (T) to estradiol (E), instead of DHT.34 Aro-
matase activity is contained within the stroma of the prostate
in non-malignant tissue, and is also detected in the epitheli-
um with disease malignancy.36 These changes to aromatase
activity in malignancy can result in overall changes in the
T:E ratio to further influence its paracrine activity in cancer
development.36,37 Sexual function is strongly influenced by
circulatory levels of androgens, and its interaction with pros-
tatic glandular cells and their luminal fluid may influence the
development of PC.13 However it is unclear if sexual activity
is the cause or consequence of androgen status.21 A 2-year
follow-up of men in the Concord Healthy Aged Men’s Pro-
ject showed that a decline in testosterone, and not DHT or
estrogen levels, was strongly associated with a decline in sex-
ual activity and sexual desire, but not erectile function. This
may be the basis to explain the fundamental difference
between frequency of sexual activity and ejaculation and their
effects on PC development.21
The protective effect of ‘late bloomers’ on PC risk may be
analogous to the effect of age at menarche on breast cancer
risk.38 A shorter duration of exposure to endogenous estro-
gen, in women who have late menarche, may lower their risk
of developing breast cancer. However, these early develop-
mental factors alone cannot solely increase the risk of cancer.
The Collaborative Group on Hormonal Factors in Breast
Cancer showed that although breast cancer risk increased for
each year younger at menarche and for each year older at
menopause, these factors were attenuated by adiposity,38 sug-
gesting that duration of exposure may be significant, but
estrogen regulation in this duration is also relevant. We
found no evidence for an interaction between PC risk and
any of the risk factors that we examined.
A strength of this study is the high concordance between
self-report and NSWCR confirmed cases for PC, with a posi-
tive predictive value of 99.8%,22 which justifies the use of
self-reported PC cases in our analysis. Sensitivity analyses
with only NSWCR confirmed cases and controls (who are
confirmed to be cancer-free), and another excluding male
controls who were partners of breast cancer cases, did not
change the strength of associations of factors of interest and
PC risk.
The overall response rate of 25.4% for cases and 48.6% for
controls in the CLEAR Study may appear low but it is within
the expected range from other studies using a once only
postal approach. Nevertheless cases with short survival times
(eg men with regional spread or metastatic disease) may be
under-represented in our study. Some risk factors examined
in the current study have previously been shown to be associ-
ated with cases of aggressive disease, and thus an under-
representation of such cases may have biased results regard-
ing this risk factors towards null.22,39
There is potential for bias due to non-differential error
from the inaccurate recall of timing of pubertal development.
Information on onset of shaving is a surrogate for facial hair
growth and depends on the individual’s need to want to
shave and so does not capture the true commencement of
facial hair growth. This variable was correlated with timing
of voice break and thus combined to derive a composite vari-
able that represented timing of reaching puberty. Men who
could not recall timing of puberty (7.8% controls and 12.3%
cases) were grouped separately and showed to have a higher
risk of PC, than men who reached these events earlier or at
the same as their peers. In addition, based on recent studies
that have shown that balding pattern at age 45 is a strong
predictor of PC risk, the lack of information on age at bald-
ing in the CLEAR study, may have biased our result towards
the null.40
There is potential for differential misclassification bias in the
reporting of sexual activity between cases and controls, as a
potential disincentive to having active treatment is the high risk
of erectile dysfunction.41 Approximately 85% of the PC cases in
CLEAR reported having received active treatment for their can-
cer, which may influence their response on sexual activity; a
sensitivity analysis excluding all men who did not receive any
treatment showed no change in the outcome to the questions
on sexual activity, suggesting that our questions on sexual histo-
ry and at various time points may not be subject to this bias.
Despite the possible limitations of this study, our findings
are in broad agreement with those from other Australian and
international studies. Our results support a role for adult
body size, sexual activity and adolescent sexual development
in predicting PC risk, suggesting that risk determinants oper-
ating early in life may affect men’s subsequent PC risk.
