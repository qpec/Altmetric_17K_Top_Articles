Ideally, therapy for autoimmune diseases should eliminate pathogenic autoimmune cells
while sparing protective immunity, but feasible strategies for such an approach have been
elusive. Here, we show that in the antibody-mediated autoimmune disease pemphigus
vulgaris (PV), autoantigen-based chimeric immunoreceptors can direct T cells to kill
autoreactive B lymphocytes through the specificity of the B cell receptor (BCR). We
engineered human T cells to express a chimeric autoantibody receptor (CAAR), consisting
of the PV autoantigen, desmoglein (Dsg) 3, fused to CD137-CD3z signaling domains.
Dsg3 CAAR-T cells exhibit specific cytotoxicity against cells expressing anti-Dsg3 BCRs
in vitro and expand, persist, and specifically eliminate Dsg3-specific B cells in vivo.
CAAR-T cells may provide an effective and universal strategy for specific targeting of
autoreactive B cells in antibody-mediated autoimmune disease.
P
emphigus vulgaris (PV) is a life-threatening
autoimmune blistering disease caused by
autoantibodies to the keratinocyte adhe-
sion protein Dsg3 (1). CD20-targeted B cell
depletion results in short-term disease re-
mission in 95% of pemphigus patients, but 81%
relapse and fatal infection may occur (2). After
CD20-targeted depletion, serum autoantibody
titers drop, indicating that short-lived plasma-
blasts are the source of autoantibodies in PV
and targeting of CD20+ memory B cell precursors
indirectly depletes autoantibody-secreting CD20–
plasmablasts (3, 4). Relapsing pemphigus demon-
strates the same anti-Dsg3 B cell clones observed
during active disease, whereas disease remission
is associated with disappearance of circulating
anti-Dsg3 B cells (5). Thus, targeted elimination of
anti-Dsg3 memory B cells should cure PV with-
out the risks of general immunosuppression.
Recently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) tech-
nology has revolutionized cancer therapy. A
CD19-specific CAR, consisting of an extracellular
single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody
to CD19 fused to T cell cytoplasmic signaling
domains, activates T cell cytotoxicity upon con-
tact with CD19+ B cells, causing specific and
permanent elimination of B cells and durable
remission of leukemia (6–14). In PV, pathogenic
memory B cells express anti-Dsg3 B cell receptors
(BCRs). We reasoned that by expressing Dsg3 as
the extracellular domain of a chimeric immuno-
receptor, cytotoxicity would become specific for
only those B cells bearing anti-Dsg3 BCRs, pro-
viding targeted therapy for PV without general
immunosuppression. Such a strategy would di-
rectly eliminate surface immunoglobulin (sIg)+
anti-Dsg3 memory B cells and indirectly elimi-
nate sIg− Dsg3-specific short-lived plasma cells
that produce the disease-causing antibodies. We
thus created a chimeric autoantibody receptor
(CAAR) (fig. S1A), with the autoantigen Dsg3 as
the CAAR extracellular domain, in order to en-
gineer T cells to kill autoimmune B cells in PV.
Dsg3 consists of five extracellular cadherin
(EC) domains, with residues important for cell
adhesion residing in EC1 and EC2 (15). Auto-
antibodies to EC1, EC2, EC3, EC4, and EC5 occur
in 91, 71, 51, 19, and 12% of PV sera; no PV sera
target only the EC4 and/or EC5 domains (16).
Since T cell activation depends on the intermem-
brane distance of the immunologic synapse (17),
we reasoned that shorter conformational frag-
ments of Dsg3 should enhance CAAR efficacy.
We therefore designed a panel of Dsg3 CAARs
for expression in primary human T cells (Fig. 1A),
using Dsg3 EC1-3/EC1-4/EC1-5 as the extracellu-
lar domain, fused to a dimerization-competent
CD8a transmembrane (18) and CD137-CD3z cy-
toplasmic signaling domains, which were used
successfully in CD19 CAR clinical trials (6, 7).
EC1-3/EC1-4 CAARs demonstrate robust surface
expression of mature, conformational Dsg3 in
primary human T cells, whereas EC1-5 CAAR
expression is more variable (fig. S1, B to D).
We first evaluated the ability of Dsg3 CAAR-T
cells (CAAR-Ts) to kill anti-Dsg3 B cells in vitro,
using antibody-secreting hybridomas that tar-
get EC1 (AK23), EC2 (AK19), and EC3-4 (AK18)
(19), or K562/Nalm-6 cells expressing pathogenic
F779/anti-EC1 or PVB28/anti-EC2 IgG cloned from
PV patients (20, 21) (fig. S2). All BCRs were ex-
pressed at a density comparable to human B cells
(fig. S3). Dsg3EC1-3/EC1-4 CAAR-Ts demonstrate
interferon-g (IFN-g) secretion and specific cytol-
ysis against anti-EC1/EC2 but not control tar-
gets (Fig. 1, B and C, and fig. S4). Dsg3EC1-5
CAAR-Ts exhibit minimal cytolysis, and Dsg3EC1-3
CAAR-Ts do not lyse anti-EC3/4 targets. Thus,
the Dsg3EC1-4 CAAR demonstrates the best com-
bination of potency and breadth, with specific
cytolysis of cells expressing anti-Dsg3 BCRs.
To investigate the mechanism of CAAR-T ac-
tivation, we examined the molecular organiza-
tion within CAAR-Ts upon binding sIg target by
total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.
CAAR-Ts form immunologic synapses analogous
to T cell receptor (TCR)–peptide/major histocom-
patibility complex (MHC) interaction (22, 23),
with actin reorganization and centripetal move-
ment of CAAR-IgG clusters resulting in a central
supramolecular activation complex (SMAC)–like
structure (fig. S5A and movie S1). The protein
tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is excluded from early
CAAR-IgG microclusters (fig. S5B and movie S2),
similar to findings with the anti-CD19 CAR (24)
and the native TCR-MHC synapse (25), sugges-
tive of a kinetic segregation model for CAAR ac-
tivation (26).
PV patients have serum anti-Dsg3 IgG that
might neutralize, or alternatively could help stim-
ulate, Dsg3 CAAR-Ts. We therefore evaluated
Dsg3 CAAR-T cytotoxicity in the presence of sol-
uble monoclonal IgG matching the targeted BCR
to maximize the neutralization capacity of the
soluble IgG. Soluble anti-Dsg3 IgG decreases but
still preserves compelling CAAR-T cytotoxicity
against AK19/PVB28, minimally affects AK23/
AK18, and potentiates cytotoxicity against F779
targets (Fig. 2, A and B). Because CAAR-Ts will
encounter polyclonal anti-Dsg3 IgG in PV patients,
we next tested Dsg3 CAAR-T cytotoxicity against
polyclonal targets in the presence of polyclonal
PV serum IgG. Dsg3EC1-3, and to a lesser extent
Dsg3EC1-4, CAAR-Ts retained efficient levels of
cytolysis against AK hybridomas (Fig. 2C), de-
spite the presence of PV serum IgG as well as
secreted anti-Dsg3 IgG by these hybridomas.
Both Dsg3EC1-3 and EC1-4 CAAR-Ts effectively
killed Nalm6 cells expressing human anti-Dsg3
IgG in the presence of PV serum IgG (Fig. 2D).
Surface binding competition assays indicate that
antibodies that inhibit cytotoxicity (AK19/PVB28)
persist on the CAAR-T surface, which reduces the
number of accessible CAAR molecules to bind
target cells, while noninhibitory F779/AK23/AK18
aremorerapidlyreplacedbycompetingantibodies,
with AK18 replacement occurring even at 4°C,
suggesting low affinity (Fig. 2, E and F). Indeed,
surface plasmon resonance analysis indicates that
noninhibitory antibodies tend to have faster
off-rates and lower affinity (Fig. 2, G and H,
and fig. S6A). Furthermore, F779 and PV serum
IgG stimulate Dsg3EC1-4 CAAR-Ts, more so than
the Dsg3EC1-3 CAAR-Ts, to secrete low levels of
IFN-g and proliferate (fig. S6, B and C). Thus,
the effect of soluble antibodies to Dsg3 on CAAR-T
function and activation is a complex process that
is affected by affinity and binding kinetics of the

 antibody, as well as the relative position of the
epitope in the CAAR molecule, highlighted by
the different susceptibility of the EC1-3 and EC1-4
CAARs to blockade and activation. Collectively,
these data suggest that soluble anti-Dsg3 IgG
will not prevent and may in fact promote CAAR-
T efficacy and persistence due to CD137-mediated
costimulatory signals that have been shown to
enhance CAR-T activity (27–30) and ameliorate
T cell exhaustion (31).
We tested the in vivo efficacy of Dsg3 CAAR-
Ts against AK23/AK19/AK18 target cells in a
PV mouse model (19). We selected the PV hy-
bridoma model for in vivo proof of concept, be-
cause this model allows preclinical testing of
human Dsg3 CAAR-T efficacy against B cells
targeting distinct and defined Dsg3 epitopes.
Furthermore, the mice have polyclonal serum
anti-Dsg3 IgG (like PV patients) that might neu-
tralize or eliminate CAAR-Ts, and disease burden
can be serially and objectively quantitated by bio-
luminescence imaging. NSG (NOD-scid-gamma)
mice were injected with a polyclonal mixture of
bioluminescent AK18/AK19/AK23 hybridomas,
followed by injection with either Dsg3 CAAR-Ts
or control CAR-Ts at day 5 (fig. S7A), at which
time serum antibody titers to Dsg3 were detect-
able by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) (Fig. 3A). Dsg3 CAAR-Ts robustly con-
trol all PV hybridomas, resulting in decreased
Dsg3 serum autoantibody titers (Fig. 3A), absence
of autoantibody binding (Fig. 3B) and blistering
in oral mucosa (Fig. 3C), and significantly delayed
or no hybridoma outgrowth (Fig. 3D). Dsg3EC1-4
CAAR-Ts showed equal efficacy when tested
against each individual hybridoma in vivo (fig. S8,
A to G). We further analyzed a subset of Dsg3EC1-
4 CAAR-T–treated mice with increasing biolumi-
nescence at day 18. Increasing flux was due to
outgrowth of sIg– hybridomas that comprised
~1% of injected cells (fig. S8, H to J). This mech-
anismofCAAR-Tescapeobservedinmiceisirrelevant
in patients because sIg– long-lived plasma cells
do not significantly contribute to PV autoantibody
production. Dsg3 CAAR-T frequencies in both
“escape” and “cured” mice were comparable, in-
dicating that lack of CAAR-T cell persistence or
loss of Dsg3 CAAR expression is not responsible
for CAAR escape in vivo (fig. S8K).
We further tested the in vivo efficacy of
Dsg3EC1-4 CAAR-Ts against human CD19+ Nalm-6

 B cells expressing anti-Dsg3 BCRs (F779/PVB28)
cloned from PV patients. This model addition-
ally allows comparison with anti-CD19 CAR-Ts
(CART19) that have proven clinical efficacy (6, 7).
Although CAAR-T treatment is delayed until the
exponential growth phase of the target cells, Dsg3
CAAR-Ts effectively eliminate anti-Dsg3 Nalm-6
B cells with efficacy comparable to CART19, mea-
sured by bioluminescence and flow cytometric
analysis of bone marrow/spleen (Fig. 3, E to G,
and fig. S7, B and C). Collectively, these models
show that Dsg3 CAAR-Ts eliminate anti-Dsg3
BCR+ but not BCR– cells in vivo, indicating spe-
cific cytolysis, as opposed to bystander activation
and off-target cytolysis, even in the presence of
soluble anti-Dsg3 IgG. Notably, CAAR-Ts persist
in the presence of soluble autoantibodies to Dsg3
in vivo (fig. S8K), indicating that circulating au-
toantibodies do not cause Fc-mediated clearance
of CAAR-Ts. Furthermore, CAAR-Ts showed en-
graftment and persistence in the spleen 3 weeks
after CAAR-T transfer, even in the absence of
target cells (fig. S8L), suggesting that persist-
ence of CAAR-Ts does not depend on target cell
encounter.
We next addressed CAAR-T safety by evaluat-
ing off-target effects against keratinocytes, which
express desmocollins and desmogleins, the phys-
iologic binding partners of Dsg3. The Dsg3CAAR
does not exhibit CD3z-mediated signaling in re-
porter cells after incubation with keratinocytes
(Fig. 4, A and B), in contrastto positive control anti-
Dsg3/1 (Px44) CAR. Correspondingly, Dsg3EC1-4
CAAR-Ts do not lyse human keratinocytes in vitro,
whereas Px44 CAR-Ts show potent lysis (Fig. 4C).
To evaluate toxicity in vivo, we tested CAAR-Ts in
human skin-xenografted mice (Fig. 4D). Px44
CAR-Ts exhibit exuberant epidermal infiltration
by day 3 (Fig. 4, D and E). Despite similar T cell
density in the graft dermis, Dsg3EC1-4 CAAR-Ts
do not demonstrate enhanced skin toxicity com-
pared with CART19, which has shown no skin
side effects in humans. Additionally, no off-target
toxicity against other tissues was observed in
Dsg3EC1-4 CAAR-T–treated mice (fig. S9). Because
human Dsg3 rescues the loss of mouse Dsg3, indi-
cating functional interaction between human Dsg3
and mouse desmosomal components (32), these
experiments indicate that Dsg3EC1-4 CAAR-Ts
cause no toxicity to desmosome-bearing tissues in
vivo.Theabsenceofoff-targettoxicitytodesmosome-
bearing tissues might be explained by several fac-
tors. The intermembrane distance in desmosomes
is 35 nm (15), greater than the 15-nm optimum

 distanceforTcellactivation.Additionally,cadherin-
cadherin affinity is in the micromolar range (33),
whereas CAR-T function typically requires nano-
molar affinity (34–36). Finally, Dsg3 truncation
(EC1-3/EC1-4) potentially compromises CAAR in-
teraction with desmosomal ligands while preserv-
ing epitopes required for autoantibody binding,
thus preventing off-target toxicity.
We also considered that FcgR-expressing cells
bind serum antibodies to Dsg3 and might be-
come targets for Dsg3 CAAR-Ts, although signif-
icant toxicity is unlikely because anti-Dsg3 IgG
comprises only a small fraction of total serum
IgG. In the presence of PV serum, cytotoxicity
against CD64+ (FcgR+) K562 cells was undetect-
able (fig. S10, A and B). Additionally, Dsg3EC1-4
CAAR-T treatment in the setting of circulating
anti-Dsg3 IgG does not reduce FcgR-expressing
cells such as neutrophils and monocytes in vivo
(fig. S10C), indicating that redirected killing via
CAAR-antibody-FcgR interaction does not occur.
Furthermore, CAAR-T reporter cells do not acti-
vate when exposed to bone marrow B cells that
harbor a polyreactive and/or autoreactive rep-
ertoire (37), in contrast to CART19, which reacts
with bone marrow B cells (fig. S11). Thus, toxicity
by Dsg3EC1-4 CAAR-Ts is undetectable, under-
scoring the specificity of the CAAR concept.
In summary, CAAR-Ts represent a targeted
approach to therapy of antibody-mediated auto-
immune diseases, with the potential for gener-
ation of long-term memory CAAR-Ts that can
potentially cure disease. CAAR-Ts expressing the
PV autoantigen Dsg3 specifically kill anti-Dsg3
target cells, even in the presence of circulating
autoantibodies, and without off-target toxicity. We
acknowledge that short-termobservationsof CAAR-
T safety and efficacy in preclinical models are
inherently limited. Nevertheless, several of the
limitations of CAR-T therapy for cancer likely will
not apply to CAAR-T therapy of autoimmunity.
Target cell escape due to epitope spreading or so-
matic mutation is impossible, because B cells that
no longer bind Dsg3 will become irrelevant to
disease. Additionally, memory B cells depend on

Fig. 4. Dsg3 CAAR-Tcells do not showoff-target toxicity. (A) Flow-cytometric
quantification of CAAR-mediated signal transduction, as indicated by nuclear
factor of activated Tcells (NFAT)–driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) expres-
sion in Jurkat reporter cells, using anti-Dsg3/1 Px44 CAR as a positive control for
keratinocyte expression of Dsg3. Numbers indicate percentage of live, single cells
in the GFP-positive gate. (B) Mean fluorescence intensity of GFPexpression from
(A). Representative data were replicated in at least five independent experiments
with keratinocytes from different human donors. (C) 51Cr release after T cell–
target cell coculture at indicated E:T ratios to measure cytotoxicity by Dsg3
CAAR-T
s and controls against human HaCat keratinocytes. Mean values of
triplicate cultures are shown; similar results were obtained in two independent
experiments. (D) Microscopic analysis of human skin xenografts to evaluate
epidermal infiltration by Dsg3CAAR-T
s, positive control Px44 CAR-T
s, and neg-
ative control CART19. (Inset) Dyskeratotic keratinocytes surrounded by T cells.
Dashed line shows dermal-epidermal junction. Scale bar, 125 mm. (E) Quantifi-
cation of T cell infiltration into epidermis and dermis of human skin xenografts.
Each symbol represents one mouse; ratio-paired t test, two-tailed, *P < 0.05; n.s.
nonsignificant; data are pooled from two independent experiments.
