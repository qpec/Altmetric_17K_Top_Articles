Abstract
Background—Postpartum depression (PPD) can result in negative personal and child 
developmental outcomes. Only a few large population based studies of PPD have used clinical 
diagnoses of depression and no study has examined how a maternal depression history interacts 
with known risk factors. The objective of the study was to examine the impact of a depression 
history on PPD and pre- and perinatal risk factors.

 Method—Nationwide prospective cohort study of all women with live singleton births in Sweden 
from 1997 through 2008. Relative risk of clinical depression within the first year postpartum and 
two-sided 95% confidence intervals.
Results—The relative risk of PPD in women with a history of depression was estimated at 21.03 
(confidence interval: 19.72–22.42), compared to those without. Among all women, PPD risk 
increased with advanced age (1.25[1.13–1.37]) and with gestational diabetes (1.70[1.36–2.13]). 
Among women with a history of depression, pre-gestational diabetes (1.49[1.01–2.21]) and mild 
preterm delivery also increased risk (1.20[1.06–1.36]). Among women with no depression history, 
young age (2.14 [1.79–2.57]), those undergoing instrument assisted (1.23[1.09–1.38]) or cesarean 
(1.64[1.07–2.50]) delivery and moderate preterm delivery increased risk (1.36[1.05–1.75]). Rates 
of PPD decreased considerably after the first postpartum month (relative risk = 0.27).
Conclusion—In the largest population based study to date, the risk of PPD was more than 20 
times higher for women with a depression history, compared to women without. Gestational 
diabetes was independently associated with a modestly increased PPD risk. Maternal depression 
history also had a modifying effect on pre- and perinatal PPD risk factors.
INTRODUCTION
Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most common non-obstetric complications 
associated with childbearing.1 PPD also constitutes a serious threat to the infant’s well-being 
as the period immediately surrounding birth is a critical window for many infant 
developmental events.2 Many reports have suggested that a history of depression is 
associated with increased PPD risk.3–5 Additional factors associated with PPD include age 
and other demographic characteristics,3 pregnancy complications,5 and obstetric factors.5
Research exploring risk factors associated with PPD has generally included important 
methodological limitations. First, the vast majority of studies have relied on clinical rather 
than epidemiological samples. Epidemiological samples are population-based, whereas 
clinical samples from care-based clinics, referral centers, and inpatient samples involve 
patient series, which may not represent the entire population of women with PPD.1 Second, 
past studies have tended to rely on PPD symptomatology rather than clinical depression 
diagnoses.6 Symptom based PPD inventories7 have a tendency to overestimate prevalence 
especially given the overlap between surveyed symptoms and common maternal discomforts 
of pregnancy and the postpartum.1,6 Third, while a history of depression is a strong predictor 
of depressive disorders throughout the lifespan, and could be an important predictor of PPD, 
studies to date have predominantly relied on retrospective self-report methods to determine 
psychiatric history.1–5 Such methods are prone to recall bias, experimenter bias, and most 
importantly lack clinical specificity, which may lead to further misclassification and poor 
estimation.1,6
This population-based, nationally inclusive, study therefore aimed to address each of these 
limitations by determining the extent to which a history of depression contributes to the risk 
of clinically recognized PPD and determining the degree to which a history of depression 
modifies the association between maternal obstetric and perinatal conditions and PPD. Using 
data on more than 700,000 deliveries in Sweden between 1997–2008, this is the largest

 study to date to characterize unipolar depression in the postpartum period in relation to a 
maternal depression history. We identified all recorded cases of PPD using national health 
registers with high reliability for mental health diagnoses8 and determined the clinical 
history of depression in all participants. We describe patterns of PPD in relation to 
depression history and previously identified demographic and behavioral risk factors.9 
Finally, we adjusted for important confounders and multiple demographic characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Using the nationwide Swedish Medical Birth Register, which includes information on all 
births in Sweden, we identified a cohort comprising all Swedish born women who delivered 
a live singleton infant between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2008. To avoid problems 
with correlated data, we included only information on the first childbirth during the study 
period for each woman. Since Sweden has a publically financed health system with 
universal access, the Medical Birth Register covers virtually all births in Sweden. The study 
protocol was approved by Icahn Medical School at Mount Sinai’s Program for the 
Protection of Human Subjects, The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and The 
Ethical Review Board at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm.
Outcomes
Since 1973, the nationwide Swedish National Patient Register has been prospectively 
capturing admission dates and clinical diagnoses for virtually all psychiatric hospitalizations. 
Since 2000, hospital outpatient care has been included in the registry as well. Diagnostic 
information is based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. Dates of 
inclusion were selected to conform to the Swedish health system’s implementation of the 
ICD-10th Revision (ICD-10) in 1997. Data linkage between the Medical Birth Register and 
the Swedish National Patient Register was accomplished using the unique national 
identification number assigned to Swedish residents.10
For PPD we included diagnoses of postpartum depression, as well as major depressive 
disorder (single or recurrent), unspecified episodic mood disorder, or depressive disorder 
that occurred within the first year postpartum (Table 1). Contemporary diagnostic nosology 
characterizes PPD as a specifier of a major depressive disorder (unipolar) with an onset of 
symptoms within four weeks according to the American Psychiatric Association11 or six 
weeks according to the World Health Organization12 after delivery. Consistent with prior 
research9 and in agreement with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology 
guidelines and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,1 we defined PPD as a 
depression diagnosis within 12 months following the date of delivery. The additional 
diagnostic codes for unipolar depression reflect the range of classifications used by 
clinicians who diagnose depression. We defined lifetime depression history as a clinical 
diagnosis of depression anytime prior to the delivery date of the child using the same 
ICD-9/1012 codes (Table 1).

 Covariates with high reliability and accuracy within the Swedish Medical Birth Register13 
were selected based on previous PPD research9 and included history of depression (yes/no), 
year of delivery (1997–2002, 2003–2008), maternal age at delivery (15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 
30–34, 35–39, 40+), cohabitation with the father of the infant (yes/no), hypertensive diseases 
(no, preeclampsia, essential hypertension), diabetic diseases (no, pre-gestational type1 or 
type 2, gestational), prolonged labor (as defined by a documented ICD-code; yes/no), mode 
of delivery (vaginal non-instrumental, vaginal instrumental, emergency or elective cesarean 
section), gestational age (<32, 32–36, 37–41, >42 weeks), birth weight for gestational age 
(<3rd, 3rd to 14th, 15th to 84th, 85th to 97th, and >97th percentiles), congenital 
malformation (yes/no), and sphincter rupture (yes/no). Estimation of gestational age was 
based on early second trimester ultrasonic scan of fetal dimensions. If no early ultrasound 
investigation was available, information from the last menstrual period was used to calculate 
gestational age. Birth weight for gestational age was categorized into percentiles according 
to the Swedish reference curve for normal fetal growth.14 Information on delivery and 
gestational age is recorded at the time of delivery. Information on maternal and infant 
diagnoses are noted by the obstetrician and pediatrician, when the mother and infant are 
discharged from hospital.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the relative risk (RR) of PPD with incidence rate ratios from Poisson 
regression models fitted to the data. Women were followed from the date of delivery until 
PPD, death, emigration or 12 months following the date of delivery, whichever came first. 
RRs of PPD were calculated for each of the covariates in the model. First, we calculated 
crude RRs by only including a categorical covariate for month since date of delivery and the 
covariate of interest. In adjusted models, we included the following covariates: maternal 
depression history, year of delivery, maternal age, cohabitation with father of the infant, 
hypertensive diseases, diabetic diseases, prolonged labor, mode of delivery, gestational age, 
birth weight for gestational age, congenital malformations, and sphincter rupture. Variables 
were categorized according to Table 2.
These models were repeated for women with and without a depression history. To facilitate 
the interpretation of the results, figures depicting rate of PPD (cases/10,000) by month were 
produced comparing women with and without a depression history; Using Kaplan-Meier 
techniques, log survival curves were calculated and plotted. Poisson regression models 
similar to above were fitted with the first month postpartum as a reference to calculate the 
RR of PPD in each month after delivery compared with the first month.
For all estimated RRs, the associated two-sided 95% Wald type confidence intervals (CI) 
were calculated, corresponding to a statistical test on the two-sided 5% level of significance. 
We tested for interaction between history of depression and each of the maternal obstetric 
and perinatal conditions in the two-sided 10% level of significance. Data management and 
all statistical models were conducted using SAS software (Poisson regression using proc 
glimmix) version 9.4 64-bit running Debian linux.

 Sensitivity Analysis
As a check of robustness secondary to the inclusion of outpatient care, we repeated analyses 
for women who delivered an infant between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008, while 
restricting the definition of history of depression to the period from January 1, 2003 to 
December 31, 2005. Because some outpatient diagnoses could have represented ongoing 
treatment for women previously diagnosed with depression, we restricted the definition of 
PPD to only include those diagnoses following hospitalization or coded in the register as an 
“acute visit” as opposed to “planned.” Information on when the visit was booked was not 
available in our data, but since “planned” visits scheduled one day in advance may include 
events of an “acute” nature, the RRs estimated using this restricted definition will, if 
anything, underestimate the true RR.
For all estimated RRs the associated two-sided 95% Wald type CIs were calculated, 
corresponding to a statistical test on the two-sided 5% level of significance.
RESULTS
Characteristics of study cohort
We identified at total of 707,701 unique women with a live singleton birth between 1997 and 
2008. Table 2 presents the demographic and birth characteristics for the study cohort. Within 
the first year after delivery, there were 4,397 PPD cases (62 per 10,000; Table 2). Both 
among women with and without a history of depression, rates of PPD dropped dramatically 
one month after delivery (Figure 1), and especially after the first week (Figure 2).
Compared with the first month after delivery, the risk of PPD rapidly decreased at the 
second month postpartum; RR=0.27(0.2 to 0.3) and thereafter decreased slowly for the 
remaining 10 postpartum months; RR=0.16(0.1 to 0.2) at month 12. As a consequence, 33% 
of all PPD cases were diagnosed within the first month following delivery, 50% within the 
first three months and 68% within the first 6 months postpartum (supplementary file, etable 
1).
Maternal depression history and risk for PPD
Compared with women without a depression history, there was a statistically increased risk 
for PPD in women with a history of depression; RR=21.03(19.72 to 22.42).
Maternal obstetric and perinatal factors and risk for PPD
Independent of depression history, there was a statistically significant increase in PPD risk 
for women older than 35 years compared with women aged 25 to 29 years, RR=1.25(1.13 to 
1.37), shorter gestational age, week <32 RR=1.36(1.05 to 1.75) and week 32 to 36 
RR=1.20(1.06 to 1.36) compared with gestational week 37 to 41 and for women with 
gestational diabetes RR=1.70(1.36 to 2.13), compared with women without pre- or 
gestational diabetes (Table 3).

 Modifying effect of maternal depression history on maternal obstetric and perinatal factors 
and risk for PPD
Depression history had a modifying effect on the risk for PPD associated with maternal age, 
mode of delivery, and presence of diabetic disease.
For women with a depression history, there was a statically significant lower risk for 
younger mothers, aged 15 to 19 and 20 to 24, but a statistically significant higher risk for 
mothers 30 to 34 and 35 to 39 years of age compared with mothers aged 25 to 29. There was 
also a statistically significant increase in PPD risk for women with pre-gestational diabetes 
compared with women without pre- or gestational diabetes, RR=1.49(1.01 to 2.21) in those 
women with a depression history.
For women without a depression history there was a statistically significant increase in PPD 
risk in younger mothers (aged 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 years) and in older mothers (aged 35 to 
39 years and >40 years). Women without a depression history also had a statistically 
significant increased risk for PPD associated with mode of delivery; vaginal instrumental 
RR=1.23(1.09 to 1.38) and CS RR=1.64(1.07 to 2.50) compared with vaginal delivery. Tests 
of interactions between history of depression and each of the factors above revealed 
statistically significant interactions on the nominal 2-sided 10% level of significance for 
maternal age (p<0.001) and gestational age (p<0.05).
Sensitivity analyses
There was no evidence for bias due to time trends in diagnosed PPD, or changes in 
administrative reporting (supplementary file, eTables 2–7). Sensitivity analyses for visits 
registered as “acute” as opposed to “planned” also showed similar results, except that there 
was no longer an association between sphincter rupture and PPD in women without a history 
of depression (supplementary file, eTables 8–13). In this restricted sample of birth, only 
maternal age showed a statistically significant interaction with history of depression.
DISCUSSION
In the largest longitudinal population based PPD study to date with prospective follow-up 
using clinically ascertained rates of depression, we found a highly increased risk for PPD in 
women with a history of depression compared to women without a history of depression. 
Second, we clarify previously identified maternal perinatal and obstetric risk factors for 
PPD. Finally, for the first time, we show how maternal and obstetric risk factors for PPD 
may differ between new mothers with and without a history of depression.
The observed rate of PPD in the Swedish population (62/10,000) was within the range 
suggested by the few other population-based reports that also used the more stringent criteria 
of clinical diagnoses: United States9 (31/10,000), Denmark15 (51/10,000), and Finland16 
(28/10,000). Notably, depressive disorders after pregnancy exist along a continuum of 
severity rather than as an all or none phenomenon1 and the vast majority of studies exploring 
PPD risk have relied on symptom based measures that are prone to producing higher 
prevalence estimates.1,6 This is in part due to their inability to differentiate between 
clinically significant symptoms of depression and commonly reported, non-pathological,

 postpartum discomforts including sleep disturbance, changes in appetite, decreased energy, 
and concentration difficulties.
Our findings show that a history of depression represents more than a 20-fold increased risk 
for PPD. Though the association between a history of depression and the risk for PPD has 
been recognized,1,3,5 the extent to which a history of depression confers and may modify 
PPD risk has not been rigorously examined nor quantified. Several other maternal 
characteristics and medical conditions have also been previously shown to be associated 
with PPD including maternal age,3 pregnancy complications,5 and obstetric factors.5 Our 
findings add to this body of work and for the first time detail the risk for PPD in relation to 
depression history potentially helping to clarify previously indeterminate results.
Maternal Age and PPD
Some studies have shown that adolescents are at higher risk for PPD17 while others show no 
increased risk for adolescents, but rather a five-fold increased risk for those over the age of 
30.18 Our findings show that PPD risk is associated with maternal age, but also how this risk 
is modified by depression history. That is, among women with no history of depression, 
young mothers had an increased risk for PPD compared with mothers aged 25 to 29 years. 
Pregnancy during adolescence is well understood to pose additional challenges for new 
mothers as they seek to navigate both their own development and the responsibilities of 
caring for a newborn. However, because of their youth and the nature of depression as a 
disorder with increasing likelihood across the lifespan, younger women simply due to their 
age would presumably be less likely than their more mature counterparts to have received a 
diagnosis of depression prior to pregnancy. It is therefore intuitive that a larger proportion of 
younger mothers who experience PPD, would not only be free of a depression history, but 
might also receive their first diagnosis in the postpartum period. Conversely, among those 
mothers with a depression history, our findings showed an increased risk with advanced 
maternal age (>35 years) compared with mothers aged 25 to 29 years. Indeed, in those 
women with a depression history, trends in PPD risk in the later age ranges of 30–34 years 
and 35–39 years all conferred a significantly greater likelihood. Notably, this observation did 
not hold for women >40+ years of age and may be due to the comparatively lower number 
of women in this particular cohort.
Diabetes and PPD
Prior studies examining the relationship between diabetes and PPD have been 
indeterminate.19 Complicating the matter is that the differences between gestational and pre-
gestational diabetes are not fully understood,20 and because gestational diabetes represents 
any degree of glucose intolerance identified during pregnancy, even if it existed before 
pregnancy (i.e., pre-gestational) and regardless of whether it persists or emerges after 
pregnancy, research exploring this relationship has generally suffered from incomplete 
diagnostic resolution. Not yet demonstrated before, our findings show that for those with a 
history of depression, diabetes adds an additional 1.5 fold increased risk for PPD. Further, 
our study shines new light on the relationship between diabetes and depression by showing 
that gestational diabetes was strongly associated with increased risk for PPD in women 
regardless of their depression history, while pre-gestational (type 1 or type 2) diabetes

 represented an increased risk only in those women with a history of depression. Given that 
pre-gestational diabetes is generally considered to be a more serious and life altering 
medical condition, this finding initially appears somewhat surprising. However, because 
diabetes and depression are highly correlated21 with bidirectional causality,22 it is possible 
that those with pre-gestational diabetes who have no history of depression represent a PPD 
resilient sub-group.23,24
Preterm Delivery
Previous studies into the association between gestational age and PPD have been 
inconclusive.25,26 Our results show that independent of depression history, preterm delivery 
was associated with an overall increased risk for PPD. A possible explanation for this 
finding relates to our methodology of following women for a full year after delivery,1,9 
thereby potentially capturing later depression diagnoses. In line with current convention, we 
defined preterm delivery as a live birth that occurs before 37 weeks gestation. In an effort to 
potentially increase the resolution of the relationship we stratified prematurity into mild (32–
36 weeks gestation) and moderate (<32 weeks gestation) categories. Further analysis 
revealed that women free of a depression history were at a 1.5-fold increased risk for PPD 
when their child was born moderately premature. While it is possible that this finding is 
closely associated with the separation of the mother from her newborn via admission to a 
prolonged intensive care stay, because women with a depression history were at a 
significantly increased PPD risk even with mild prematurity, it is possible that like 
diabetes22 the two factors share a bidirectional causal path.
Mechanistic Causes of PPD
This is the first study to clarify the role of a maternal history of depression with clinically 
ascertained risk factors for PPD in a nationally inclusive sample. The results of this study 
suggest the possibility of two major pathways into the development of PPD: one through a 
history of depression, and the other through specific pregnancy related risk factors. PPD in 
woman with a history of depression may represent the natural recurrence of depressive 
episodes,27 while PPD due to events surrounding pregnancy and delivery may represent a 
different mechanism. While the stress associated with the responsibilities of caring for a 
newborn represents a challenge for most, if not all, new mothers, a possible unifying 
biological mechanism for PPD includes abnormalities associated with the immune system.
The reproductive process is profoundly immunologic28 as well as hormonal29 and human 
studies have consistently demonstrated a role for inflammatory processes in the etiology of 
depression outside of pregnancy.30,31 Inflammatory dysregulation has also been 
demonstrated as a cause for preterm birth32 and adverse obstetric outcomes.33 Similarly, 
alterations in the immune system have been documented with aging34 as well as the 
pathophysiology of diabetic disease.30,35 While it remains unknown whether these systemic 
events share etiologic mechanisms with PPD,34 future studies should consider the possibility 
of neuroimmunological mechanisms of PPD along with other biological aspects of 
childbirth, such as fluctuations in reproductive hormone levels.34–36

 Strengths and Limitations
This study was designed, in part, to directly address limitations of previous research on PPD. 
Strengths of this study include the use of a population-based cohort with complete national 
coverage ascertaining clinically significant instances of depression after childbirth. However, 
the results of the study should be interpreted in light of several potential limitations. Even 
though the Swedish registers have been repeatedly shown to have high validity with 
complete coverage of all psychiatric discharges10 and that the outcome of clinical depression 
is likely to have high specificity, there will be incomplete sensitivity if women did not seek 
medical care.37 It is therefore possible that the association between depression history and 
PPD is underestimated. However, due to Sweden’s nationwide perinatal health initiatives 
and universal health care provision mandating universal postpartum “in home” visits 
conducted by specialist clinicians, with near 100% participation,38 observed registry rates 
for PPD more likely represent treatment capture as opposed to merely reflecting self-
initiated treatment behavior. Similarly, our method of following women for one year post-
delivery circumvents the need for the depression diagnoses to be limited to the immediate 
postpartum or even a single practitioner visit. It should be noted that registry based clinical 
diagnoses do not only represent new incident cases, but also service utilization. However, a 
sensitivity analysis restricting PPD cases following only acute or inpatient visits revealed a 
comparably sized risk.
Finally, we observed an increased number of PPD cases in the later cohort years. 
Interestingly, this observation is consistent with a few other recent population-based studies 
of PPD, one from the United Kingdom4 and two others from the United States.9,.39 While 
we know of no study that has explored this time-trend phenomenon, possible explanations 
include the increased awareness of PPD as well as improved strategies aimed at identifying 
early maternal depression. Indeed, the importance of identifying depression after childbirth 
has gained considerable attention and universal postpartum screening programs have become 
an appealing option for many.40 Importantly, a sensitivity analysis restricting our model to 
the 2003–2008 cohort, in an effort to address the increase of diagnoses in the register due to 
the addition of outpatient data, verified our reported findings.
CONCLUSION
In the largest population based study to date, PPD risk was associated with a history of 
depression and with obstetric and perinatal factors. There is a highly elevated risk for PPD 
among women with a history of depression compared to women without a history of 
depression. Never shown before, some of the risks associated with obstetric and perinatal 
factors are modified by a history of depression, suggesting differences in the etiology of 
PPD between women with and without a personal history of depression.
