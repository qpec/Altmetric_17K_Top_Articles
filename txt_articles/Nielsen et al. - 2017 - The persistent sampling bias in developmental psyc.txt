Abstract 
Psychology must confront the bias in its broad literature towards the study of participants 
developing in environments unrepresentative of the vast majority of the world’s population. Here, 
we focus on the implications of addressing this challenge, highlight the need to address over-reliance 
on a narrow participant pool, and emphasize the value and necessity of conducting research with 
diverse populations. We show that high impact-factor developmental journals are heavily skewed 
towards publishing papers with data from WEIRD populations (Western, Educated, Industrialized, 
Rich and Democratic). Most critically, despite calls for change and supposed widespread awareness 
of this problem, there is a habitual dependence on convenience sampling and little evidence that the 
discipline is making any meaningful movement towards drawing from diverse samples. Failure to 
confront the possibility that culturally-specific findings are being misattributed as universal traits has 
broad implications for the construction of scientifically defensible theories and for the reliable public 
dissemination of study findings.

Growing attention has been drawn to the lack of diversity in psychological testing, and in 
particular, to the fact that the vast majority of psychological research has been conducted on 
populations that are unrepresentative of human culture more globally – those from Western, 
Educated, Industrial, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) backgrounds (Henrich, Heine, & 
Norenzayan, 2010; Legare & Harris, 2016; Nielsen & Haun, 2016). The dearth of systematic 
research outside of Western cultural contexts is a major impediment to theoretical progress in the 
psychological sciences (Legare & Nielsen, 2015; Rowley & Camacho, 2015). Where psychological 
researchers assume data are not specific to the sample of participants under direct test (i.e., that 
findings are generalizable) lack of attention to cultural variation and its psychological consequences 
risks yielding incomplete, and potentially inaccurate, conclusions (e.g., Apicella & Barrett, 2016; 
Evans & Schamberg, 2009; Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, & Zhao, 2013; Votruba-Drzal, Miller, & 
Coley, in press).  
A complete understanding the ontogeny and phylogeny of the developing human mind 
depends on sampling diversity (Clegg & Legare, 2016; Herrmann, Call, Hernandez-Lloreda, Hare, 
& Tomasello, 2007; Machluf & Bjorklund, 2015; Nielsen, 2012; van Schaik & Burkart, 2011). 
Where research efforts are focused on identifying core mechanisms or universal aspects of 
psychology, failure to acknowledge the possible impact of environment on the behavior of 
participants must be considered at best neglectful and at worst bad science. Our aim here is to show, 
presenting new data, that the influence of culture ("a set of meanings or information that is non-
genetically transmitted from one individual to another, which is more or less shared within a 
population (or a group) and endures for some generations", Kashima & Gelfand, 2012, p. 640) is 
not afforded sufficient attention in the developmental literature. Moreover, despite growing 
awareness of a need to change, we show that there little shift in research practices that overly rely on

data from a markedly narrow sample pool and little acknowledgement that this is potentially 
problematic for interpreting data and arising theoretical assumptions. 
From the limited research that exists, there is clear evidence of substantial differences 
between Western educated, industrialized communities and non-Western populations in 
fundamental aspects of child development (Bornstein, 1991; Corsaro, 1996; Gaskins & Paradise, 
2010; Kruger & Tomasello, 1996; Lave & Wenger, 1991; Levine, Levine, Schnell-Anzola, Rowe, & 
Dexter, 2012; Miller & Goodnow, 1995; Rogoff, 2003). This includes evidence for cross-cultural 
variation in child socialization and how parents interact with their infants (Kärtner, 2015; Keller, 
2007; Keller & Kärtner, 2013), the kinds of tasks they engage them in (Cole, 1996; Lancy, Bock, & 
Gaskins, 2010), and the amount of time children spend with non-parental caregivers and peers 
(Gaskins, 2006; LeVine, 1980). For example, there is cultural variation in the degree to which 
mothers focus on face-to-face interaction and object play when engaging their infants that leads to 
culture-specific maternal reactions to infants’ communicative signals (Kärtner, 2015; Keller et al., 
2004; Little, Carver, & Legare, 2016). 
Cultural variation has also been documented in other fundamental aspects of human 
cognition (Wang, 2017). For example, Haun and colleagues (2006) found Bushman children tend to 
employ a geocentric search strategy (where the position of relevant items is maintained relative to 
the larger surrounding environment) to find something hidden among an array of overturned cups, 
in contrast to the egocentric approach (where the position of relevant items is maintained relative to 
the viewpoint of the child) adopted by Western children. Our aim here is not to dwell on culturally 
determined differences in children’s developmental environments. Rather we wish to draw attention 
to interpretation and the assumptions that would be made without consideration of potential 
cultural influences. Had Haun et al. tested only Western children it could have easily been assumed, 
as is typically written, that ‘children’ employ egocentric search strategies. But ‘children’ generally 
don’t do so: Only children from specific cultural backgrounds do.

Critically, there is no universal developmental context in which children grow up, nor is 
there a universal environment for the human mind. To understand psychological processes it is thus 
necessary to exercise caution when generalizing beyond the specific sociocultural context at hand. 
To reiterate, if an underlying goal of any research endeavor is to identify globally relevant patterns 
of development – and not patterns that are specific to one population in isolation – then failure to 
acknowledge the possible influence of cultural factors on participants’ responses is either neglectful 
or bad science (an error each of us as authors acknowledge that we have been guilty of making). It is 
the equivalent of missing a glaringly obvious confound and assuming the data at hand is untainted. 
For example, it would be ill-advised to interpret children’s responses to questions relating to folk 
biological reasoning without acknowledging that such answers are population-dependent and vary 
with culturally determined interactions with the natural world (Medin, Waxman, Woodring, & 
Washinawatok, 2010; Proffitt, Coley, & Medin, 2000; Ross, Medin, Coley, & Atran, 2003). It would 
be similarly ill-advised to make claims about human perceptual attention processes based on data 
collected with only Western or Asian participants (Nisbett & Miyamoto, 2005). For developmental 
science to be sure it is built on solid foundations it is thus critical that culturally-variant and 
culturally-invariant patterns of development are identified, and that it is acknowledged when 
reported-on data could be different if collected in a distinct sample. The alternative, that a sample 
lacking in cultural diversity is representative of all children, should no longer be treated as an 
acceptable default option. 
Evidence for a persistent bias 
Arguments that there is an inherent bias in what constitutes our participant pools are of 
course not new (Bornstein, 2002; Cole, 1996; Levine, Martinez, Brase, & Sorenson, 1994; Rogoff, 
1990; Scribner & Cole, 1973; Serpell, 1976; Shweder, 1990; Super & Harkness, 1986; Whiting & 
Whiting, 1975). Building on these earlier endeavors, in a prominent and highly cited paper Henrich 
and colleagues (2010b) drew attention to the disproportionate representation in psychology of what

they coined “WEIRD” participants (ie., those from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and 
Democratic backgrounds). This extended previous work by Arnett (2008) who analyzed papers 
published from 2003-2007 in peak journals from six sub-disciplines of psychology, revealing that 
96% of the participants were from Western, industrialized countries (68% from the United States 
alone) and 99% of first authors were at universities in Western countries (73% from the United 
States). Putting this in the context of population size, 96% of psychological samples came from 
countries with only 12% of the world’s population and this skew in sampling was apparent in 
Arnett’s analysis of the journal Developmental Psychology. Perhaps a wider assessment of developmental 
journals would have yielded a more representative picture.  
To evaluate this possibility, we surveyed every paper published between 2006 and 2010 in 
the prestigious journals Child Development, Developmental Psychology and Developmental Science (consistently 
the highest ranked experimental developmental psychology journals by impact factor) and recorded 
the geographical region of the participants, whether they were human or non-human primates, and 
the affiliation of the first author. Participant information was gleaned from information on where 
data was collected provided in Method sections and it was noted if such information was not 
provided. Meta-analyses based on previously published data were excluded to avoid artificial 
inflation. Participant region and author affiliation were classified as: (1) The United States (coded 
separately given Arnett’s prior identification that individuals from the US are over-represented in 
psychology research); (2) countries with English as their first language (i.e., effectively United 
Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada); (3) European countries that do not have English as 
their first language; (4) Central and South America; (5) Africa; (6) Asia; and (7) Israel and the Middle 
East. Coding was not mutually exclusive in that a paper featuring participants from different regions 
contributed data to all regions identified. The proportion of participant samples from each region 
from these journals across the 5 years assessed are presented in Table 1 (i.e., the percentage of the 
total number of papers surveyed featuring children from that region).

In terms of raw numbers, of the 1582 papers, 912 featured participants from the US, 284 
from English-speaking countries and a further 236 from Non-English-speaking Europe. Compare 
this with 112: The total number of papers featuring participants from all of Central and South 
America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Israel combined. Perhaps more sobering, only 11 papers 
featured participants from Central and South America, and only 10 featured participants from 
Africa – less than the 23 papers devoted to non-human primates AND less than the 15 papers that 
did not specify where their participants were from. In terms of total participant numbers, 633,775 
were from the United States – well over double the entire number from the rest of the world 
combined (286,321 – with a further 1,959 unspecified), after excluding data from one study 
involving all 654,707 births in Sweden from 1983 to 1991. From another angle, less than 3% of the 
participants contributing to the expansion in our knowledge of children’s psychological 
development came from all of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Israel

combined (which notably contain approximately 85% of the world’s population - 
http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/).  
Of 1,6911 papers assessed for author affiliation, 1,029 (61%) were first-authored by faculty of 
institutions in the United States, 341 (20%) by those in English-speaking countries and another 251 
(15%) by those in non-English-speaking European countries – with the remaining 4% first-authored 
by those from institutions in Asia and Israel. Only 2 papers had the first author located in Central 
and South America, and none from the Middle East or Africa. The critical point about author 
origin is that it emphasizes how developmental psychology, as a discipline, is characterized as one in 
which individuals in WEIRD institutions study WEIRD participants.  
A wider assessment of developmental journals than reported by Arnett (2008) did not, 
therefore, yield a more representative picture. But perhaps this skew in sampling is historical. It has 
been over 8 years since Arnett (2008) and 6 years since Henrich et al. (2010) were published. Given 
the citation count for the latter (over 3000 times according to Google Scholar), change could 
reasonably be expected. Is there any evidence that our research has become less biased in its 
underrepresentation of the majority of the world’s humans over the last 8 years? 
Following the same method outlined previously, we collated data on participant origin for all 
papers published in 2008 (361 papers) – the year Arnett’s review was published – and in 2015 (383 
papers). As is evident in Figure 1, little has changed in the sampling region. In 2008, 91.67% of all 
papers published featured participants from the US, English-speaking countries or Non-English-
speaking Europe, leaving 8.33% representing all of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, the 
Middle East and Israel combined. In 2015, the distribution between those two groups was 
remarkably similar to 2008 (92.37% and 7.63% respectively). This does not present a picture of a 
discipline thoughtfully contemplating its limitations and readily embracing change.

Conclusion and a way forward 
We have highlighted how the vast majority of the world’s population is under-represented in 
high-impact developmental psychology research. There are many possible reasons for this. 
Opportunities for research with culturally heterogeneous samples are typically limited and depend 
on the commitment of unique, often substantive, temporal and fiscal resources, and sometimes on 
years investing in building trust among relevant communities with little immediate return. Authors 
from WEIRD backgrounds are hence not incentivized to pursue heterogeneous data collection 
practices. Further, papers published in the journals sampled here are held to the highest standards 
of empirical rigor, and rejection rates are high. To meet standards for publication commonly 
requires extensive university training in scientific design, analysis and writing. Research by staff at 
non-WEIRD institutions may be less consistent with Western-centric scientific practice, or not done 
at all. Language is also a barrier. While journals may encourage submission by authors from non-
English-speaking backgrounds, and offer to copyedit manuscripts, researchers without sufficient

grasp of English to get to that level are forced to publish in local journals (or not at all). This runs 
another way too. If reading in English is challenging, identifying cutting edge research may be 
elusive, leading to research being done that is outside contemporary trends. Similarly, access to peak 
journals is expensive and may be beyond the budgets of many of the world’s universities. The 
obstacles may be many, but our preference is that these reasons be viewed as support for 
encouraging research featuring sampling diversity, not as excuses for perpetuating the status quo of 
failing to do so.  
In certain situations the exploration of possibly skewed findings as a result of restricted 
participant sampling might be redundant, but decisions about this need to be made through a lens 
of awareness and with appreciation of the potential impact of using homogenous data. This latter 
point is key. Our suggestion is not that all developmental psychology studies must involve 
heterogeneous samples. This would be unreasonable and in many cases impractical. We are saying 
that where samples are from homogenous groups consideration should be given to the notion that 
whatever is being reported may be culturally specific and hence possibly unrepresentative and not 
generalizable, and that this be openly acknowledged in print (e.g., in Discussion sections).  
There is a complementary need to acknowledge the implicit ‘othering’ that can occur when 
issues of culture are referenced. Othering, a form of marginalization whereby individuals or groups 
are marked as distinct from oneself, is anchored in feminist theory and has been applied to the study 
of racism, identify and difference (Ahmad, 1993; Fine, 1994; Hall, 1991; Tomaselli, 2003, 2005; 
Weis, 1995). Here we use it to refer to situations where participants drawn from WEIRD cultures 
are considered to be the norm and those who are not are treated as exceptions to the norm. In this 
light we borrow from the APA (2003) publication of the guidelines on multicultural education, 
training, research, practice, and organizational change for psychologists and encourage researchers 
to recognize that as cultural beings they may hold attitudes and beliefs that can detrimentally 
 The Sampling Bias in Developmental Psychology

influence their perceptions of research undertaken in populations that are economically, ethnically 
and racially different from themselves.   
If progress away from the sampling bias inherent in developmental psychology research 
identified here is to be made, we need to shift away from this ‘othering’ point of view. Positive steps 
forward include: (1) encouraging publication of studies that feature non-WEIRD participants; (2) 
encouraging replication in a new population of a previously established finding; and (3) encouraging 
theoretically-motivated cross-cultural comparisons that examine how children’s cultural 
environments might impact their development. Having members of editorial boards and grant-
funding bodies with sufficient knowledge of the challenges encountered in collecting heterogeneous 
data will also help, especially when there is a need to distinguish reasonable from unreasonable 
reviewer critique.  
We must be ever attentive to the possibility that where we think we are exploring human 
universals we are rather exploring cultural specifics. A continued WEIRD-centric approach also has 
implications for the ways in which research is used. Where it forms the foundation for policy 
development it is critical that the research match the target population. For example, in the United 
States there has been considerable political agitation and policy implementation aimed at bridging 
what has been termed the “word gap” – the disparity in the amount and quality of language that 
low-income children hear relative to their more-affluent peers (Hart & Risley, 1995; Hirsh-Pasek et 
al., 2015). Many interventions focus on supporting change in the way caregivers interact with their 
children. Such interventions may be relevant in the United States but they might not be in other 
countries where children and their caregivers engage with each other in ways that are not 
commensurate with dyadic interaction (Little et al., 2016; Rogoff, Mistry, Göncü, & Mosier, 1993).    
Reflecting the above, developmental research commonly makes its way into the public 
domain, and hence it is important to make apparent when there is no foundation for broad 
generalization of reported findings. For example, the impact of divorce on children has been shown 
 The Sampling Bias in Developmental Psychology 
12 
to differ across cultures and economic strata (Fischer, 2007) – if a parent is seeking to gain insight 
into the issues that might confront his/her children post-divorce, consulting literature that does not 
apply to his/her circumstances may lead to unsubstantiated concerns or misguided intervention. 
Similarly, early childhood development programs are frequently based on sensitivity and mind-
mindedness (Meins et al., 2002; Slade, 2005) as the core elements of optimal parenting that should 
be supported. However, these ideals are highly cultural and may deviate wildly from the models 
followed by caregivers from other cultures. This might lead practitioners to misinterpret caregivers’ 
behavior as ‘problematic’ where, in fact, it is just an expression of another developmental pathway 
(Otto & Keller, 2014). 
There will be criticisms of the concerns laid out here. Haeffel and colleagues (2009) have 
suggested that: “… the problem of generalizability is often overstated. Studies using one sample of 
humans (e.g., Americans) often generalize to other samples of humans (e.g., Spaniards), particularly 
when basic processes are being studied (e.g., Anderson, Lindsay, & Bushman, 1999)” (p. 570).  This 
assertion has several shortcomings. First, Haeffel et al. define basic processes as “those psychological 
or biological processes that are shared by all humans at appropriate developmental levels (e.g., 
cognition, perception, learning, brain organization, genome)”. This may be true, but the 
universality of such basic processes is commonly assumed rather than empirically documented. 
Second, the paper they use to support their claim aimed to provide external validity to lab-based 
research, not to identify human universals. Haeffel et al. also argue: “It is not enough to show that 
American culture is different from other cultures. This fact is not disputed. The critical question is 
what these differences mean for human psychology”. We agree, and this is the essence of our point. 
Theoretically driven, empirically falsifiable endeavors that involve participants across a range of 
environmental circumstances will enrich our understanding of psychology and help clarify the 
validity of research findings.

A new path forward for developmental science is needed to meet this challenge to 
understand continuity and diversity in human cultural background. While there may be widespread 
awareness of this challenge what we highlight here is that this awareness is not translating into 
change in the approaches taken to publication strategy.  Systematic comparisons across a wide 
variety of human environments is needed to enable examination of variation and stability in core 
domains of human psychology, and where convenience sampling is adhered to the limitations of 
such an approach must be acknowledged. We need to accept the challenge posed by diversity, 
provide the explanations it requires, and harness this information to build an improved set of 
encompassing theories about the development of the human mind.
