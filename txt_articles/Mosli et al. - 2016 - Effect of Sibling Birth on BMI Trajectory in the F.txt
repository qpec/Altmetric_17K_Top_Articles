BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study examined the longitudinal association between birth of a 
sibling and changes in body mass index z-score (BMIz) trajectory during the first 6 years of 
life.
METHODS: Children (n = 697) were recruited across 10 sites in the United States at the time of 
birth. Sibship composition was assessed every 3 months. Anthropometry was completed 
when the child was age 15 months, 24 months, 36 months, 54 months, and in first grade. 
Children were classified based on the timing of their sibling’s birth. A piecewise quadratic 
regression model adjusted for potential confounders examined the association of the birth 
of a sibling with subsequent BMIz trajectory.
RESULTS: Children whose sibling was born when they were 24 to 36 months or 36 to 54 
months old, compared with children who did not experience the birth of a sibling by first 
grade, had a lower subsequent BMIz trajectory and a significantly lower BMIz at first grade 
(0.27 vs 0.51, P value = 0.04 and 0.26 vs 0.51, P value = 0.03, respectively). Children who did 
not experience the birth of a sibling by the time they were in first grade had 2.94 greater 
odds of obesity (P value = 0.046) at first grade compared with children who experienced 
the birth of a sibling when they were between 36 to 54 months old.
CONCLUSIONS: A birth of a sibling when the child is 24 to 54 months old is associated with a 
healthier BMIz trajectory. Identifying the underlying mechanism of association can help 
inform intervention programs.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Having younger 
siblings is associated with lower obesity risk cross-
sectionally. The longitudinal association between 
birth of a sibling and child BMI has not been 
established. Whether this association varies by the 
timing of the sibling’s birth is unknown.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: A birth of a sibling when 
the child is 24 to 36 months or 36 to 54 months old 
is associated with a lower subsequent BMI z-score 
trajectory and a lower BMI z-score at fi
 rst grade.

The rate of obesity among children 
in the United States continues to 
be high1 and novel strategies for 
effective interventions are needed. 
The home environment is an 
important venue for intervention 
programs, and although much work 
has focused on the association 
between parenting and obesity, 
2 the 
potential role of siblings in shaping 
obesity risk is not fully understood. 
Understanding the role of siblings 
may provide novel intervention 
strategies by targeting related 
behaviors and interaction patterns 
between siblings, as well as between 
siblings and parents.
Having younger siblings, compared 
with having older or no siblings, 
is associated with a lower risk of 
being overweight and obese cross-
sectionally.3–8 However, there 
is limited understanding of how 
the birth of a sibling may relate 
to changes in BMI longitudinally 
during early childhood. Monitoring 
changes in child BMI after the 
birth of a sibling could help 
further establish the association 
between having younger siblings 
and lower child BMI by examining 
temporality of events. Furthermore, 
identifying sensitive time periods 
in the association between the 
birth of a sibling and child BMI 
could contribute to the targeting 
and tailoring of interventions and 
may inform research investigating 
the underlying mechanism of the 
association between the birth of a 
sibling and lower child BMI. Previous 
work in other domains of child 
development provides evidence that 
the age of a child when a sibling is 
born moderates the effects of the 
sibling’s birth on the child’s course 
of development.9–13 Therefore, the 
birth interval between the child 
and his/her younger sibling may 
be associated with behaviors that 
influence weight status, such as 
physical activity.14
The main goal of this study was to 
test the hypothesis that children 
who experience the birth of a sibling, 
compared with those who do not, 
have a lesser subsequent increase in 
BMI z-score (BMIz). A secondary goal 
was to test the hypothesis that the 
effect varies by the age of the child at 
the time of the sibling’s birth.
METHODS
Participants and Procedures
Data from the National Institute 
of Child Health and Human 
Development Study of Early Child 
Care and Youth Development were 
used for this analysis. The study 
sample included 1364 families 
recruited in 1991 at the time of the 
child’s birth across 10 sites in the 
United States. Conditional random 
sampling was used to prevent 
selection bias. Inclusion criteria 
were that the mother was healthy, at 
least 18 years of age, and an English 
speaker; the child was a singleton 
with an uncomplicated delivery; and 
the family resided within 1 hour of 
the research site in a relatively safe 
neighborhood, and was not planning 
to move.
Children and their families 
participated in home, laboratory, 
and phone assessments beginning 
at birth. For the present analysis, 
we only included children who had 
complete anthropometric and sibship 
composition data at every time 
point (15 months, 24 months, 36 
months, 54 months, and first grade). 
Of the 1364 participants, 953 had 
complete sibship composition data, 
742 had complete anthropometric 
data, and 697 had both at all 5 time 
points. Thus, our final sample size 
was 697 (52% of total participants). 
The original sample of 1364 was 
described in more detail elsewhere.15 
The sample of children included in 
this analysis (n = 697) did not differ 
from the sample not included (n = 
667) with regard to socioeconomic 
status. However, compared with 
the sample not included, the sample 
included in this analysis had a 
significantly higher percentage of 
females (52.6% vs 43.8%) and non-
Hispanic whites (80.2% vs 76.8%).
Measures
Mothers reported children’s birth 
weight (grams), which was later 
converted into z-scores based on 
national datasets.16 Children’s 
lengths/heights and weights were 
measured by using standardized 
procedures during laboratory visits 
when the children were 15 months, 
24 months, 36 months, and 54 
months old, as well as during the 
spring of the child’s first grade year 
in school. Weight-for-length and 
BMI were calculated and age and sex 
specific weight-for-length z-score 
and BMIz were calculated based on 
the US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reference growth 
curves.17
Family composition was assessed 
every 3 months throughout the 
duration of the study. Mothers 
were asked whether a new sibling 
was born since last contact during 
regularly scheduled telephone 
contacts or during home interviews 
that occurred at 15, 24, 36, and 
54 months. These data were used 
to determine whether the child 
experienced a birth of a sibling as 
well as the timing of the sibling’s 
birth.
Additional characteristics for 
adjusted analysis were identified a 
priori from the literature. Mothers 
reported the child’s sex and race/
ethnicity, family income and family 
size when the child was 24 months of 
age, and maternal years of education 
at the time of the child’s birth.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted by 
using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC). Descriptive statistics were used 
to assess sample characteristics. 
Analyses were performed by 
using mixed models with random 
coefficient to account for having 
repeated weight-for-length z-score/

BMIz measures for each individual 
subject. Both linear and quadratic 
growth curve models were 
considered, with quadratic growth 
having a better fit as assessed by 
Bayesian Information Criteria. Thus, 
to model the possible impact of a 
sibling’s birth on children’s weight-
for-length z-score/BMIz during 
the first 6 years of life, a piecewise 
quadratic regression model was 
examined. A piecewise quadratic 
regression model allows the weight-
for-length z-score/BMIz growth 
curve to be altered in correspondence 
to a sibling’s birth. To examine how 
the effect of a sibling’s birth on the 
child’s weight-for-length z-score/
BMIz trajectory varies by the timing 
of the sibling’s birth, children were 
classified into the following groups: 
(1) no siblings born by the time the 
child was in first grade (mean child 
age 72 months); (2) sibling born 
when the child was 9 to 24 months 
old (mean child age 16.5 months); (3) 
sibling born when the child was 24 
to 36 months old (mean child age 30 
months), and; (4) sibling born when 
the child was 36 to 54 months old 
(mean child age 45 months). There 
was insufficient follow-up time to 
examine changes in BMIz attributed 
to the birth of a sibling between 54 
months and first grade. For children 
who had more than one sibling born 
during the 6-year period, weight-for-
length z-score/BMIz data after the 
birth of the second sibling were not 
included in the analysis. Therefore, 
any modification in weight-for-length 
z-score/BMI trajectory would be 
attributed to the birth of 1 sibling. 
To further assess the association of a 
sibling’s birth during the first 6 years 
of life with children’s weight status, 
we used a multiple logistic regression 
model to estimate the prevalence of 
obesity at 72 months for each sibling 
category and test for differences. 
All analyses were adjusted for child 
sex (male versus female) and race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white versus 
Hispanic or not white), income-to-
needs ratio (calculated by dividing 
the total reported family income 
by the official federal poverty line 
for a family of that size in that 
particular year), and maternal 
years of education. Each of these 
characteristics has been previously 
associated with fertility choices and 
parity18–20 as well as child weight 
status.1 Significance level was set at 
0.05.
RESULTS
Sample characteristics for the whole 
sample and stratified by having or 
not having a sibling by first grade 
are shown in Table 1. Figure 1 
shows changes in weight-for-length 
z-score and BMIz from birth to first 
grade, as well as the possible effect 
of the age of the child when the 
sibling was born on child weight-
for-length z-score/BMIz trajectory. 
Adjusting for covariates, the birth 
of a sibling when the child was 
between 9 months and first grade 
was associated with lower child BMIz 
at first grade. Children who did not 
experience the birth of a sibling by 
the time they were in first grade had 
a quadratic growth curve from birth 
to first grade, such that BMIz did not 
change during the first 24 months, 
and then increased between 24 
months and first grade.
The magnitude of effect varied by 
the age of the child when a sibling 
was born. Children who experienced 
the birth of a sibling when they 
were ages 9 to 24 months had a 
lower subsequent increase in BMIz 
compared with children who did 
not experience the birth of a sibling 
by the time they were in first grade. 
However, children who experienced 
the birth of a sibling when they 
were ages 9 to 24 months did not 
have a significantly lower BMIz at 
first grade compared with children 
who did not experience the birth of 
a sibling by the time they were in 
first grade (0.47 vs 0.51, P value = 
0.53). Children who experienced the 
birth of a sibling when they were 24 
to 36 months old had a significantly 
lower subsequent increase in BMIz 
and a significantly lower BMIz at 
first grade compared with children 
who did not experience the birth 
of a sibling by the time they were 
in first grade (0.27 vs 0.51, P value 
= 0.04). Similarly, children who 
experienced the birth of a sibling 
when they were 36 to 54 months old 
had a significantly lower subsequent 
increase in BMIz and a significantly

lower BMIz at first grade compared 
with children who did not experience 
the birth of a sibling by the time 
they were in first grade (0.26 vs 
0.51, P value = 0.03). There was 
no difference in BMIz at first grade 
between children who experienced 
the birth of a sibling when they were 
24 to 36 months old versus those 
who experienced the birth of a sibling 
when they were 36 to 54 months old 
(P value = 0.97).
Children who did not experience 
the birth of a sibling by the time 
they were in first grade had the 
highest prevalence of obesity at 
12.8%. Children who experienced 
the birth of a sibling when they 
were 36 to 54 months old had the 
lowest prevalence at 4.8%. The 
prevalence of obesity was 7.8% 
for children who experienced the 
birth of a sibling when they were 
9 to 24 months old and 8.4% for 
children who experienced the birth 
of a sibling when they were 24 to 36 
months old. The difference in obesity 
prevalence between children who did 
not experience the birth of a sibling 
by the time they were in first grade 
versus children who experienced the 
birth of a sibling when they were 36 
to 54 months old was statistically 
significant (odds ratio = 2.94, P 
value = 0.046); children who did not 
experience the birth of a sibling by 
the time they were in first grade had 
2.94 greater odds of obesity at first 
grade compared with children who 
experienced the birth of a sibling 
when they were between 36 to 
54 months old. No other pairwise 
comparisons of obesity prevalence 
at first grade were statistically 
significant.
DISCUSSION
We found that the birth of a sibling 
before first grade, especially when 
the child is 24 months to 54 months 
old, is associated with a healthier 
BMIz trajectory from the time of 
the sibling’s birth to first grade. Our 
findings are consistent with previous 
reports from cross-sectional studies 
that having younger siblings is 
associated with a lower risk of being 
overweight and obesity.3–8 To our 
knowledge, this study is the first to 
document a longitudinal association 
between the birth of a sibling and a 
lesser subsequent increase in BMIz. 
Although 1 study reported positive 
child behavior (eg, greater expression 
of affection and joyful behavior and 
less aggression) with a birth interval 
of >2 years between the child and 
his/her sibling, 
13 no previous study 
has reported a differential effect of 
the birth of a sibling on child BMIz 
based on the child’s age when his/her 
sibling was born.
There are several potential 
mechanisms of association. Changes 
in parenting practices that are 
specific to feeding may occur after 
the sibling is born. For example, 
because children who do not have 
siblings (ie, only children) are more 
likely to experience restrictive 
feeding behaviors, 
21 it is possible 
that parents may lessen their use of 
restrictive feeding practices after the 
birth of a sibling, and less restrictive 
feeding is associated with a lower 
child obesity risk.22 Furthermore, 
because children develop long-lasting 
eating habits and food preferences 
around the age of 3 years, 
23 altering 
feeding behaviors when the child is 
∼3 years of age because of the birth 
of a sibling may contribute to the 
observed differential effect of the 
birth of a sibling on child BMIz. It 
is also possible that after the birth 
of a sibling, the older child assumes 
a caregiver or teacher role, which 
involves facilitation of active play.24, 
25 This behavior is more prevalent 
when the siblings are >2 years 
apart.13 Assuming the role of a leader 
in active play may contribute to older 
siblings becoming more physically 
active, resulting in greater caloric 
expenditure and maintenance of a 
healthy weight status.
The strengths of this study include 
the longitudinal design, which helps 
further establish the association 
between the birth of a sibling and 
lower child BMIz. We were uniquely 
positioned to examine how the 
association between the birth of a 
sibling and child BMIz differs by the 
age of the child when his/her sibling 
was born. Moreover, our sample 
was drawn from 10 sites across the 
United States, potentially making 
our findings more generalizable. The 
limitations of this study include that 
the data used for the analysis were 
collected from 1991 to 1998. Future 
work may consider examining this 
question in more contemporaneous

data sets, as it is possible that secular 
trends in child obesity and family 
size, although null or modest, 
26, 
27 
could alter results. We were unable 
to test the mechanism of association 
longitudinally because measures 
were not available in the data set 
used. Future longitudinal studies are 
needed to identify the mechanism 
of association between the birth of a 
sibling and child BMI. Furthermore, 
the number of children from racial/
ethnic minorities is relatively limited, 
and thus the findings may not be 
generalizable to certain racial/ethnic 
groups. Interpretation of the results 
may also be limited by the necessary 
transition from using weight-for-
length z-score to BMIz as the index of 
adiposity at 24 months. These are the 
US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention recommended indices 
of adiposity based on weight and 
length/height at these ages, but the 
change in index is methodologically 
challenging. Future studies might 
consider employing a feasible 
measure of adiposity that can be used 
repeatedly across this developmental 
period. Additionally, children’s 
birth weights were not objectively 
measured and thus errors may exist 
due to reporting bias. Finally, we did 
not have detailed information on 
family instability, which may relate to 
sibship composition. Instability could 
lead to disruptions in household 
routines and sleep patterns that 
are known to have an impact on 
children’s weights.28
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest a novel 
framework for researchers and 
practitioners for designing child 
obesity interventions. Identifying 
the underlying mechanism for the 
association between the birth of a 
sibling, especially when the child 
is between age 24 months and 
first grade, and lesser subsequent 
increases in BMIz could help 
inform interventions and improve 
children’s outcomes. For example, 
behavioral characteristics of the 
child and his/her family members, 
such as mealtime behaviors and 
physical activity, may be evaluated 
and targeted for children who do 
not have younger siblings to help 
prevent excessive weight gain during 
early childhood. If the birth of a 
sibling changes behaviors within the 
family in ways that are protective 
against obesity, these patterns of 
behavior could be promoted among 
families without a younger sibling. 
For example, if it were determined 
that the birth of a sibling leads to 
less restrictive feeding behaviors by 
parents, interventionists may focus 
on counseling families of children 
without younger siblings regarding 
appropriate feeding strategies. 
Alternatively, if it were determined 
that the birth of a younger sibling 
is followed by healthy increases in 
active play due to a child playing 
with his/her younger siblings, 
interventionists might describe 
this phenomenon to families in 
which the youngest child has a 
high BMI and no younger siblings. 
Families may be made aware that 
the research suggests that having 
a younger sibling seems to lead to 
more active play, presumably as 
a result of the children serving as 
playmates to each other. Therefore, 
families might consider more actively 
seeking out same age or slightly 
younger playmates for these children 
to replicate the benefits of having 
a younger sibling. Incorporating 
such information regarding family 
structure and related behaviors 
into prevention and intervention 
strategies could contribute to efforts 
that aim to reduce the prevalence of 
childhood obesity.
