Abstract 
Background 
Sub-optimal adherence to inhaled steroids is common in children with asthma and is 
associated with poor disease control, reduced quality of life and even death. Previous 
studies using feedback of electronically monitored adherence data have demonstrated 
improved adherence but have not demonstrated a significant impact on clinical outcomes. 
The aim of this study was to determine whether introduction of this approach into routine 
practice would result in improved clinical outcomes.  
Methods 
Children with  asthma aged 6-16 years were randomised to the active intervention 
consisting of electronic adherence monitoring with daily reminder alarms together with 
feedback in the clinic regarding their inhaled corticosteroid use or to the usual care arm 
with adherence monitoring alone. All children had poorly controlled asthma at baseline, 
taking inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long acting beta agonists (LABAs).   Subjects were 
seen in routine clinics every three months for one year. The primary outcome was the 
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score. Secondary outcomes included adherence and 
markers of asthma morbidity. 
Results 
77 of 90 children completed the study (39 intervention, 38 control).  Adherence in the 
intervention group was 70%, vs 49% in the control group (p = <0.001). There was no 
significant difference in the change in ACQ but children in the intervention group required 
significantly fewer courses of oral steroids (p= 0.008) and fewer hospital admissions (p= 
<0.001).  
Conclusion  
The results indicate that electronic adherence monitoring with feedback is likely to be of 
significant benefit in the routine management of poorly controlled asthmatic subjects.

Can electronic adherence monitoring with feedback and alarms improve clinical outcomes in 
children with poorly controlled asthma? 
What is the bottom line? 
Electronic monitoring with feedback and alarms improved adherence, decreased hospital admissions

INTRODUCTION 
Adherence to inhaled steroids is often sub-optimal in children with asthma, resulting in poor disease  
control1, increased need for oral steroids2 and decreased lung function3. This leads to increased 
healthcare utilisation, and associated cost4. The recent National Review of Asthma Deaths in the UK  
reported that poor adherence was associated with 34% of deaths due to asthma, emphasising the 
significance of the problem5. 
Large adult population studies, and smaller paediatric studies have shown that adherence rates of 
75-80% are required to significantly improve asthma control6-8. However, when objectively 
measured, the average rate of adherence in children with asthma is around 50%, some way below 
this desired therapeutic level9. 
Subjective and indirect measurements of adherence have been shown to over-estimate rates due to 
patients wanting to be looked upon favourably by their clinician- the social desirability bias10,11. 
Electronic monitoring devices (EMDs) record adherence rates by logging the exact date and time an 
inhaler is actuated, with modern devices proven to be highly accurate and reliable in the clinical 
setting12. Monitoring allows intentional adherence barriers such as negative illness perceptions or 
medication beliefs to be identified, and addressed with regular open dialogue13-15. Reminder alarms 
built into the devices can address non-intentional practical barriers such as simply forgetting to take 
the medication16.  
Due to their cost, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) has questioned the viability of EMDs outside the 
research setting17,  and The National Institute of Health and Excellence (NICE) has recommended 
further studies to investigate their use clinically18. 
A� A��������� ����� ������������ ���� ���������� ��������� ��������� when electronic data was fed 
back, although it was under-powered to show any improvement in clinical outcomes19.   A recent 
study in New Zealand improved self-reported asthma control in the short-term using electronic 
monitoring, no feedback and reminder alarms20. However, this study involved seeing subjects out of 
clinic every 2 months, used covert monitoring, and had no effect on objective clinical outcomes.   
In order to determine whether clinically relevant benefits could be observed in a routine clinical 
setting through the use of electronic monitoring we undertook a study in which children with poorly 
controlled asthma were randomised to the use of reminder alarms and feedback or routine care.  
 5 
 
We hypothesized that by addressing both the intentional and non-intentional adherence barriers, 
rates would increase to a degree necessary to improve asthma control and clinical outcomes.

METHODS 
The STAAR study (STudy of Asthma Adherence Reminders) was a multi-centre, open label, parallel 
group randomised controlled trial, with an allocation ratio of 1:1.  Written consent was taken from 
the parents/ carers of all participants, and ethical approval for the study was granted by the South 
Yorkshire Research Ethics committee, REC reference 13/YH/0289. The protocol was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02451709.  
Participants & setting 
Children with doctor-diagnosed asthma aged 6-16 years attending clinics in Sheffield or Rotherham 
were screened for eligibility. Participants had to be taking regular inhaled steroids, with no change in 
their medication in the last month. At recruitment, participants had to have an Asthma Control 
Questionnaire (ACQ) score of at least 1.5, indicating they had poorly controlled asthma21. 
Participants were excluded if they could��� speak English, or if they had another significant chronic 
condition. The EMDs available for this trial were only compatible with seretide or symbicort inhalers. 
Therefore all participants were at BTS level 3 at the start of the trial. 
Interventions  
Prior to randomisation, all participants had their inhaler technique checked by a qualified asthma 
nurse, and received a brief asthma education session, emphasizing the importance of taking inhaled 
steroids regularly. All participants were seen in their standard asthma clinics 3 monthly and all 
treatment decisions were made by the clinical team. A member of the study team downloaded data 
from the EMD at each visit.   
Intervention Group 
Participants in the intervention group had an EMD attached to their regular inhaler. The devices 
���� �� ���� ����� ���� �“������������� ��� �“������������ ��������ured by Adherium, [Auckland, 
New Zealand] (figure 1).   The EMDs are commercially available, have a CE safety mark, and are 
validated for adherence monitoring in asthma12. Participants were told the devices monitored the 
date and time of all actuations. At clinic visits, the adherence data from the previous 3 months was 
uploaded to the website www.smartinhalerlive.com, which displays the data graphically. These data 
were reviewed with the patient and parent/ carer (figure 2).  Open, non-judgemental discussions 
were held about the adherence rate, barriers identified and, if necessary, personalised strategies for 
improvement were devised. Devices were set to play reminder alarms ����������� ����� �� ��������� 
noises), with different times agreed for weekdays and weekends.  Alarms sounded for 5 seconds, 
 7 
 
every minute for 15 minutes ��� ����� ���������� �� ��� ������� ������ ���� �������� ������ ��� 
previous 6 hours of the specified time. The devices were locked to prevent tampering. Times were 
reviewed each study visit and changed if necessary. An example was a child who missed evening 
doses due to Arabic classes, therefore alarms were changed to later in the evening on weekdays.  
Control Group  
Control participants had the same EMDs attached to their regular inhaler, they were also told the 
devices monitored how much the inhalers were taken, but that these data would not be reviewed. 
Participants were seen in their standard asthma clinic and the data was downloaded, but not 
reviewed. The alarms were disabled, and the devices locked. 
Primary Outcome 
The primary outcome for the study was change in the ACQ score at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The ACQ 
is a questionnaire validated for the use in children aged 6-1622. There are 6 clinical questions related 
to  symptoms in the previous week, and the 7th score corresponds to the Forced Expiratory Volume 
in one second, per cent predicted (FEV1%). A mean of the 7 values is calculated, giving a score of 0-6, 
with a higher score indicating more poorly controlled asthma. 
Secondary Outcomes 
Secondary outcomes recorded  at baseline and each  visit were FEV1% 23, number of unplanned 
attendances to GP/ED for asthma since last visit (as reported by parents), number of r courses of oral 
steroids required, number of days off school due to asthma,  use of-agonists in the past week and 
BTS level of asthma therapy. Quality of life was measured using the  Mini Paediatric Asthma Quality 
of Life Questionnaire (mini PAQLQ)24.  The adherence rate was calculated for each 3 month period, 
both morning and afternoon doses, and recorded as a percentage. This was calculated as number of 
doses actually taken/ number of doses prescribed x 100. The daily adherence was capped at 100%, 
to avoid falsely increased values due to dose dumping. The overall 3 monthly figure was a mean of 
each daily %. Parental beliefs about inhaled steroids and perceptions about asthma were recorded 
at baseline and 12 months with the Beliefs about medicines questionnaire (BMQ) and the Brief 
Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (IPQ)25, 26. 
Sample Size 
The sample size was calculated using a repeated measures analysis for 4 follow-up visits. The 
Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MID) for the ACQ is 0.522. Using a repeat measure analysis 
 8 
 
����� �� ���������� ��� � ������������ �� �� �� � ����), and a power of 80%, with a repeated measure 
correlation of 0.4, that n = 76 27. To allow for a 15% attrition rate we aimed to recruit 90 participants 
to the study. 
Randomisation 
Participants were randomised using  permuted block randomisation, with an allocation of 1:1, which 
resulted in equal group sizes of 45, created from a computer generated random number sequence. 
The allocation of subjects following recruitment involved phoning the independent holder of the 
randomisation code.   
Blinding 
Due to the nature of the intervention, neither the participants nor the study team were blinded in 
this study. In the intervention group adherence data was made available to clinicians if requested, 
but not in the control group. 
Statistical analysis 
The ACQ and FEV1% were compared statistically by two approaches.  First, by calculating a paired 
difference between 12-months and baseline for each group separately. T�� ����������� �� ��� 
����������� ������� ���������� ��� �������� �� �� ����������� �-test.  A 95% confidence interval 
was calculated.   Second, an area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each group and the 
between-group difference was determined by an independent t-test.  The AUC is a mean value 
weighted by time 28.  An arbitrary level of 5% statistical difference was assumed (two-tailed).     
Incident rates were estimated by Poisson regression, and compared by incident rate ratios 
(IRRs). The assumption of Poisson regression (mean=variance) was confirmed.  Continuously 
distributed data was summarised by the median (quartiles); categorical data by n (%). A sensitivity 
analysis was carried out on the primary outcome measure (ACQ) using multiple imputation 
(MI). The approach used is detailed in appendix 1, with charts demonstrating the patterns 
for missing data. T�� �“����� ����������� �������� ������� ��� ���� ��� ���� ��������.

Primary Outcome 
The ACQ decreased in both groups between the baseline and the 3-month visit.  It fell by 1.0 in the 
control group and 0.9 in the intervention group (p=0.35), both significantly exceeding the  MID for 
changes in ACQ scores of 0.522.  This improvement was maintained to 12 months in both treatments 
arms (figure 4). At 12 months there were no significant differences between the two groups for 
either the mean change from baseline (table2) or the areas under the curve (table 3).  The individual 
participant trajectories for ACQ across the study visits are shown in appendix 1 (figure A3).

Secondary Outcomes 
Average adherence over the 12 months for the intervention group was 70%, vs. 49% for the control 
group (p=<0.001). Higher mean and median adherence rates were maintained for the 12 month 
period in the intervention group, but declined over time in the control group (figure 5). 20 
Participants in the intervention group, and 6 in the control group had a mean adherence rate of 
>80% for the 12 month period. 4 participants in the intervention group and 11 in the control group 
had rates of <30%.  
Event rates are shown in table 4. The mean (SD) days in study was 351 (117) days for the 
intervention group, and 358 (101) days for the control group. Figure 5 shows the timing of rescue

There were no significant differences between the two groups for ����� ������ �-agonist use, change 
in BTS stage, mini PAQLQ, BMQ or IPQ scores.  FEV1% improved in both treatment arms, with no 
significant difference between treatments at 12-months compared to baseline (table 2). The mean 
(SD) beclometasone equivalent ICS dose at the end of the study was 673 (303) mcg in the 
intervention group, and 767 (369) mcg in the control group.   
 
Clinic visits 
Patients did not attend (DNA) or cancelled 143 scheduled appointments (73 intervention, 66 
control). Appointments were re-scheduled, but where this was not possible, 35 non-clinical study 
visits (15 intervention, 20 control) were performed.  As a result of these missed study visits, only 
41% of participants in the intervention group received feedback at all three time points (3,6 & 9 
months). Missing data for ACQ and adherence is shown in tabulated form in Appendix 1.

DISCUSSION 
While use of electronic adherence monitoring with feedback and regular alarms by children with 
poorly controlled asthma did not significantly improve self�reported asthma control, there was a 
significant increase in adherence rates that was maintained over the 12 months.  This improvement 
was associated with a significant decrease in the number of exacerbations requiring a course of oral 
steroids or an admission to hospital. This is the first study to our knowledge that has shown that 
regular alarms and feedback of electronic adherence data has a significant effect on a number of 
clinically relevant outcomes.   Importantly, the intervention was built into routine clinical care and 
the benefits were sustained over the 12 month study period.   
Previous studies using this approach have also demonstrated improved adherence through the use 
of reminders with or without feedback, but they have failed to demonstrate a significant difference 
in clinical outcomes.  These studies have variously involved relatively well controlled and adherent 
subjects29, relatively mild asthmatic subjects managed in the community30 or have been too small to 
demonstrate significant difference19� I� ���� ����� ��� �������� ��� ��� ������� ���������� ������� 
(ACQ � ����, and hence there was possibly greater potential to have an impact than those included in 
previous studies. Our results are consistent with the study of Williams et al., who in a study of 298 
adults with asthma found that patients with an adherence in excess of 75%, as assessed by 
pharmacy records, were significantly less likely to require an ED visit, a course of oral steroids or a 
hospital admission6. 
The results from this study suggest that this approach is likely to be beneficial if introduced into 
routine clinical care, at least in those children with poor asthma control. It is likely that the 
intervention resulted in an overall reduction in health costs, given that the majority of the direct 
costs associated with asthma are attributable to  hospital admissions, or exacerbations sufficient to 
require intervention31.  In this study the hospitalisation rate was five times higher in the control 
group despite self-reported symptoms being similar. This approximates to the prevention of 12 
hospitalisations in one year amongst the 47 intervention subjects giving an approximate figure for 
the number to treat of 3.25.  There would appear to be a cost saving in using this approach, even at 
current prices (£120 per device). The BTS questioned the utility of this approach due to high device 
cost, but its introduction into routine practice would reduce unit price, as it would drive competition 
and innovation.   
Adherence in the control group fell progressively over the year, consistent with results from previous 
studies 29, 30, 32.  At  49% the median adherence  was similar to the value of  53% derived from our  
 14 
 
analysis of 18 previous studies using electronic monitors to quantify adherence rates in children9.  In 
contrast, the intervention group maintained a significantly higher level of adherence throughout the 
study and this was associated with the important improvements in clinical outcomes. Whilst both 
groups required fewer courses of oral steroids during the study compared to baseline rates, 
significantly more courses were required in the control group throughout. This difference between 
groups was more marked at nine and twelve months, with rates increasing in the control group in 
the second six months (figure 6). Similar patterns of increasing control group rates in the second six 
months were seen for hospital admissions, days off school and GP/ED visits. This would suggest the 
benefit of this intervention was over a prolonged period of time, maintaining increased adherence 
rates with regular feedback and discussion.  
Which part of the intervention had the greatest impact is unclear.  A previous study found reminders 
alone can have an impact on adherence but this was in a self-selecting group of well controlled adult 
subjects whose mean adherence was high (74%) in the control group 30. It is likely that the feedback 
in this study played a major role in sustaining improved adherence rates, since other studies using 
reminders alone have observed declining adherence over time 20, 29.  Burgess et al also reported 
sustained improvements in adherence over time through feedback though the study only ran for 4 
months and subjects were seen every 4 weeks19. Accurate electronic data that could be discussed 
with the family appeared to facilitate an open and honest discussion about adherence and the 
barriers encountered, leading to evolving practical solutions. Social-desirability could be used in a 
positive way to influence medication taking behaviour. However, for some participants the 
interventions did not appear to impact on adherence and there were a disproportionate number in 
this group who reported damaged or lost devices.  This approach may not fully address the issue of 
intentional non-adherence, but it does help to confirm the problem, should the devices remain 
operational. 
 In support of the argument that feedback and discussion are important are the results from a recent 
study which demonstrated that in 220 children, despite improving self-reported asthma control, 
electronic monitoring and alarms had no effect on objective clinical outcomes20.  Subjects were seen 
out of clinic every 2 months for 6 months, with adherence declining at each time point in both 
groups, possibly leading to the initial impact on exacerbations disappearing beyond 2 months. 
Importantly the participants received no direct feedback, preventing the opportunity to initiate an 
open dialogue. Moreover, covert adherence monitoring was used, an approach that cannot be 
recommended in routine practice.   
 15 
 
Out of necessity this was an open label study. The risk of introducing an inadvertent bias was 
minimised by ensuring both groups had the same number of clinic visits (136 intervention, 124 
�������� ��� �������� �������� ���������� ��� ���������� �� ��� ��������� ����� ��������ns.  The 
control participants were aware that their adherence was being monitored in a clinical trial, and the 
increased rates seen at 3 months may be due to this33. It is possible that true adherence was lower in 
the intervention group than that recorded as the devices (and all EMDs currently available) simply 
recorded actuations with no guarantee the medication was inhaled. Participants or family members 
could have potentially pressed the device randomly, or to silence alarms. Future devices are likely to 
overcome this problem by detecting inhalation using thermistors or other air flow monitors, an 
approach  used successfully in electronic respiratory rate monitors34.  
The lack of difference in ACQ in the two groups despite what appear to be significant differences in 
adherence rates is consistent with results reported in other studies29, 30.   Similarly recent community 
studies have reported a disconnect between self-reported symptoms and other clinical outcomes 
such as exacerbations30, 35.  This is possibly because the ACQ score is a subjective measure.  Open, 
honest dialogue facilitated by adherence discussions may have made children more honest about 
the severity of their symptoms in the intervention group. In contrast, answers from control subjects 
may have been more guarded, with denial of symptoms, as is the case in standard clinical practice, 
particularly in adolescents36. Additionally patients who knew their adherence has been poor may 
have minimised symptom reporting13. The ACQ scores and FEV1% may also reflect short term 
influences such as the recent use of oral steroids, which was significantly more common in the 
control group. The lack of a significant difference in FEV1% between groups and poor correlation 
with exacerbations may be due to FEV1% being an inaccurate way of grading asthma severity in 
children38. 
This was designed to be a pragmatic study in which asthmatic children continued with usual care 
with or without the intervention.  There was a high rate of participants cancelling appointments, or 
simply not attending.  This appears to reflect the attitude of many patients and their families who 
����� ����������� ������ �������� ������ � ����������� ���������� The overall DNA rate in this study 
was 20% (71/360 appointments, 38 group A, 33 group B), and this compares to a rate of 12% in 
respiratory clinics in Sheffield. This may demonstrate a reluctance to attend if the participant felt 
they may be judged or blamed for poor adherence by the study team or parent. Alternatively, due to 
their improved clinical condition (shown by improved ACQ), participants may have missed 
appointments because they felt better, a common reason for non- attendance39. Related to this 
issue were the high levels of devices r������� �� �� ���������  P���� and colleagues reported a 
 16 
 
Smartinhaler malfunction rate of 1.9%, and 3.5% lost when assessing 2642 monitors in an adult 
study12. Our rates of malfunction and loss were much higher (35% and 8% respectively), suggesting 
some of the devices were deliberately broken or lost. The higher rates in the intervention group 
(50% broken, 11% lost) suggest that children are more likely to break or lose their device when their 
adherence is being openly monitored. The next generation of devices provide automated uploading 
of data via smartphones such that adherence can be monitored in real-time, which offers significant 
advantages in terms of logistics and opportunity to influence behaviour.  These high rates of damage 
may suggest that this approach was disliked by the participants. However, the devices were popular 
and positive feedback was received, with the majority of participants asking to keep their device 
after the study period.  A recent qualitative study to investigate young peoples� opinions on 
electronic monitoring and feedback using these Smartinhaler devices also reported positive 
opinions, concluding  that this is a popular intervention for both adolescents and their parents 40.   
 In summary, these data indicate that significant clinical benefits can be derived from using 
electronic adherence monitoring with feedback and alarms. A sustained improvement in adherence 
rates was associated with a decreased number of courses of oral steroids required and hospital 
admissions when used in a population of poorly controlled asthmatic children using combination 
therapy.
