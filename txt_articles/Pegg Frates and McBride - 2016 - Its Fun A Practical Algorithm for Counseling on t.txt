Abstract
A growing body of research indicates that exercise is an effective intervention for depression, anxiety, and stress.
Exercise as medicine provides an additional treatment tool for mental health professionals. With the initiation of the
exercise prescription process, clinicians serve as an important link between physical and mental health. By
collaborating with a team of health professionals and the patient, clinicians can successfully encourage patients to
increase their physical activity, which will lead to positive mental and physical health changes.
Exercise and fun are not always used as synonyms. To start and sustain an exercise routine, the clinician and the
patient need to work together to find connections between the two words. The "It's Fun!" algorithm provides the
clinician with a guide to hold exercise counseling sessions that are empowering and fun for both clinician and
patient.  Taking into account all the essential steps in exercise prescription writing and counseling- the interest level
of the patient, a patient's past exercise history and timeline, the signs, symptoms, and risk factors for disease,
favorite activities, unusual ideas for motivation and exercise, and finally negotiating as well as narrowing down the
ways forward - the patient will engage in and enjoy the benefits of regular physical activity.

Introduction
“IT’S FUN” usually isn’t the first phrase that comes to a
practitioner’s mind when facing the responsibility of making a
determination of what exercise to recommend to a patient with a
mental health related issue or illness. Yet, as an algorithm, the six
letters represent a formula that can lead to a successful, healthy
outcome. In 2013, a meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of exercise
and drug interventions on the mortality rate of certain physical
ailments (heart disease, chronic heart failure, stroke and diabetes)
found that in many cases, exercise can be just as effective as medicine
[1]. Similar findings result from research studies on the efficacy of
exercise on the outcomes of mental health ailments including
depression, anxiety, and stress [2,3]. This paper will explore the use of
exercise prescriptions as an important tool in the practitioner’s toolbox
that alleviate not only individual suffering, but collectively lower
worldwide health care costs.
According to a 2011 report by the World Economic Forum and the
Harvard School of Public Health, the global direct and indirect cost of
mental illness in 2010 was $2.5T and is estimated to grow to $6T by
2030 [4]. Currently, depression accounts for nearly a third of this
expenditure. In 2014, 6.6% of all US adults (15.7 million people)
reported experiencing a major depressive episode within the past
twelve months [5]. Individuals who suffer from depression are more
susceptible to other medical problems that affect the physical body
such as cardiovascular disease or substance abuse. Further, feelings of
anxiety were reported by 18.1% of the US adult population. Anxiety
disorders disproportionately affect certain populations like women and
military workers and include debilitating conditions such as post-
traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). In addition, chronic stress, while
not considered a mental illness, can lower the immune system, bring
about sleeplessness, and cause headaches- all symptoms a patient may
report without making the connection that these symptoms are
frequently reactions to stress. In recent years, a strong evidence base
has been mounting which advocates for the use of exercise as an
effective treatment to lower both the economic and personal costs of
these mental health issues.
Exercise as Medicine
Exercise works by using several biochemical methods including
increasing the presence of endorphins, regulating serotonin and
dopamine levels, and affecting prefrontal cortex activity in the brain. It
is now common knowledge that exercising regularly can have effects
on the physical body such as: reducing blood pressure, reducing resting
heart rate, increasing fitness, preventing obesity, reducing blood
cholesterol levels, reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL), increasing
high-density lipoprotein (HDL), reducing triglycerides, changing body
composition, increasing muscle mass which increases metabolism,
reducing pain such as back pain, increasing circulation, increasing the
number of capillaries, increasing the number of mitochondria in cells,
reducing fibrinogen and increasing fibrinolysis, improving sexual
desire and function, releasing nitric oxide as vasodilator, and helping
to prevent bone loss; for these reasons alone, there is value in writing
an exercise prescription. As early as 1988, research began looking at
the apparent link between exercise and depression [6]. The study found

 that the more physical activity the study participants reported, the
fewer symptoms of depression they reported. The opposite was true as
well: the more physical inactivity reported, the more depressive
symptoms the subjects reported [6,7]. The effects of this study were
duplicated in 2006 when a national study comprised of 5451 men and
1277 women found that subjects in the insufficiently active category
reported more depressive symptoms than those in the sufficiently
active category [8].
While it could be said that feeling depressed may cause individuals
to lack the motivation needed to exercise, review studies have found
that using exercise was more effective than receiving no treatment [9].
Patients in the studies that were depressed did exercise and did benefit.
One study compared the effect size to that of psychotherapy and
pharmacotherapy [10]. Another systematic review and meta-analysis
of studies that investigated the effects of physical activity on post-
traumatic stress syndrome, found that there was evidence that physical
activity may be helpful as an intervention for those suffering from
PTSD [3]. Similar results have been found for exercise as treatment for
anxiety and stress [11,12]. Thus, working with patients to find
powerful motivators to get moving, formalizing the counseling into an
exercise prescription, and collaborating with the patient to co-create
goals that are specific, measurable, action oriented, realistic and time
sensitive, increases a patient’s self-efficacy that he or she can indeed be
successful at exercising. With exercise, small successes breed large
rewards for the body and mind.
Exercise Prescription Basics
Even though physical activity has been found to be useful as a
treatment for depression, anxiety and stress, many clinicians hesitate to
write an exercise prescription, despite calls for making physical activity
counseling a priority [13]. Many point to lack of knowledge or time as
a factor [14]. Although the benefits of regular exercise have been well
documented, exercise is also not risk free [15]. Regular physical activity
reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease overall, however,
vigorous physical exertion does acutely and transiently increase the
risk of sudden cardiac death [16,17]. To get started writing safe
exercise prescriptions, follow these key recommendations: Never have
a sedentary patient go from no activity to vigorous activity. This is the
most common way to experience a myocardial infarction while
exercising [18].
Always perform a risk stratification process prior to prescribing
exercise. Partnering with the patient’s primary care physician or
cardiologist will be important if the patient has known metabolic,
endocrine or cardiovascular disease or signs and symptoms of these
diseases.
Patients must properly warm-up and cool-down as part of the
training session. The American College of Sports Medicine advocates
for a warm-up that consists of at least 5-10 minutes of light to
moderate intensity cardiorespiratory and muscular endurance
activities. The conditioning phase consists of 10-60 minutes of aerobic,
resistance, balance, and/or sports activities. This phase is followed by a
cool-down period of at least 5-10 minutes of light to moderate
intensity activity. Stretching for at least 10 minutes is recommended to
conclude the session [19].
Start low and go slow: when commencing an exercise routine, start
at low intensity, low frequency, and low duration and work up slowly,
first increasing time of exercise until reaching 30 minutes, then
increasing frequency of exercise until reaching five days a week and
then slowly increasing intensity of exercise, making sure the patient is
medically cleared for an increase in intensity.
Assessing Exercise Program Risk
Prior to starting any exercise program, safety must be ascertained.
For healthy patients, a screening Physical Activity Readiness
Questionnaire (PAR-Q) can be used [20]. If a patient answers ‘No’ to
all of the PAR-Q questions they can consider slowly initiating physical
activity without seeing a physician. However, if a patient answers ‘Yes’
to one or more questions, further questioning should occur. A more
detailed examination can risk stratify a patient into the ACSM’s low
risk, moderate risk, or high risk groups. There are 8 risk factors to
consider, adding up the number of risk factors can classify a patient’s
risk status (Table 1).
Risk Factors to Consider
Age: male ≥ 45 or female ≥ 55 years old
Family history: history of a myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death in first degree relatives;
a male < 55 or female < 65 years old
Hypertension: (blood pressure ≥ 140/90)
Smoking : Current smoker or quitting within the previous 6 months
Dyslipidemia : (LDL ≥ 130 mg/dl or HDL ≤ 40 mg/dl; or total ≥ 200 mg/dl if only available cholesterol level)
Blood glucose level: fasting blood glucose ≥ 100 mg/dl
BMI: BMI > 30 or waist > 102 cm for men and > 88 cm in women
Sedentary lifestyle: not achieving thirty minutes of physical activity three days a week for three months
Note: Having a HDL of > 60 mg/dl is considered a negative risk factor.

 Note. Data adapted from ACSM’s Health-Related Physical Fitness
Assessment Manual, pages 15-20, 2008 and ACSM’s Guidelines for
Exercise Testing and Prescription Ninth Edition, pages 19-38, 2014.
Patients are considered low risk if they are a male < 45 years old or a
female < 55 years old, asymptomatic, and have no more than one risk
factor. These patients can be cleared for low, moderate, and vigorous
intensity activity. It is recommended that they start with low intensity
exercise and gradually increase. Moderate risk patients include males ≥
45 years old and females ≥ 55 years old or those who meet the criteria
for two or more risk factors. These patients can be cleared for low and
moderate 
intensity 
exercise. 
However, 
further 
evaluation 
is
recommended for vigorous intensity physical activity. Sedentary
patients should start at a low intensity and gradually build to greater
intensities [21]. The most dangerous time to exercise is a sedentary
patient starting a high (vigorous) intensity program or activity. High
risk patients are individuals with one or with known cardiovascular,
metabolic, or pulmonary disease. Further evaluation and testing are
recommended before initiating an exercise program in these patients
[19]. Utilizing a team of complementary expert specialists, such as a
cardiologist, endocrinologist, or pulmonologist is helpful at this stage
as the patient will likely require a stress test.
Physical Activity Guidelines and Program Design
Once a patient has been cleared to exercise safely, exercise
prescription conversations can commence. The ultimate goal is to get
patients to meet, or exceed the Health and Human Services (HHS)
National Guidelines for physical activity for adult Americans. These
recommendations call for people to achieve 150 minutes of moderate
intensity physical activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity,
in a week [22]. Additionally, the HHS states that more extensive
benefits come from increased minutes of exercise, up to 300 minutes,
and beyond, of moderate physical activity achieved in a week [22].
However, any physical activity is better than none.
Progression
A well designed program gradually progresses patients from their
current level of activity, to the recommended levels in a safe and
effective fashion. For sedentary individuals, the initial conditioning
stage occurs during the first 4 weeks of activity. General advice is to
“start low and go slow,” and increase by no more than 10-20% per
week. Two to three exercise sessions per week is a good place to start.
Exercise intensity should be around 50% of a person’s maximal heart
rate (MHR). MHR can easily be estimated by subtracting a person’s age
from 220 (220 - age in years). Exercise duration should gradually be
increased until patients can complete a 30 minute session. At this
point, additional exercise sessions can be added [19]. Patients are more
likely to sustain an exercise routine if they enjoy the activity.
After 4 weeks, patients enter the improvement stage. This period
lasts up to 6 months and consists of systematic increases in time,
intensity, and frequency [19]. Caution should be taken to adhere to the
10-20% increase rule per week, and to adjust only one domain at a
time. Once a patient has been exercising for 6 months, according to the
ACSM, they are considered to be in the maintenance phase [19]. Cross
training and variety in exercise selection become more important
variables to manipulate in this phase. Variety can help keep exercise
fun, fresh, and exciting and is an important component for injury
prevention.
Similar approaches should be taken for resistance training and
flexibility. The ACSM recommends training each major muscle group
two times per week on non-consecutive days. The same 10-20%
progression apply. Recommendations include working up to 2-4 sets of
each exercise. Repetition ranges vary depending on the goal. In young
adults, strength and power can be improved by doing 8-12 repetitions
per set. In middle age and older adults, the ACSM recommends doing
10-15 repetitions for strength and power increases. Muscular
endurance can be prioritized by doing 15-20 repetitions per set [19].
Flexibility is another important area of fitness to consider as part of
the exercise prescription. It is most effective when the muscle is warm
and can be done after light aerobic activity or a hot bath. The ACSM
recommends 2-3 days per week of dedicated stretching to improve
range of motion. This can include static, dynamic, and ballistic
stretching. Each stretch should be held for 10-30 seconds to the point
of tightness or slight discomfort. The stretch should be repeated 2-4
times, accumulating 60 seconds per stretch [19].
Lastly, an often overlooked area of fitness is neuromotor control
including balance, coordination, gait and agility. Recommendations for
adults, particularly older individuals, are 2-3 bouts of 20-30 minutes
per weeks of balance oriented exercise. Examples of this include Tai
Chi, Qigong, and Yoga [19]. After considerations regarding risk and
physical activity guidelines are made, it is time to write the
prescription.
FITT: Exercise Prescription Components
The exercise prescription is simple and composed of four parts. The
exercise prescription is much like a prescription for medicine with type
of medicine, dose, frequency and duration. Clinicians can easily
remember the components of the exercise prescription by using the
acronym FITT, which stands for frequency, intensity, time and type.
Frequency
The frequency, or number of occurrences of exercise sessions,
should be matched to the patient’s availability and current level of
activity. It is always better to err on the side of caution and start low
and go slow. Some patient’s may only be able to realistically complete
one exercise session per week, and that is fine to start with. Initial
frequency goals should aim for 3 sessions per week. Once a patient can
complete a 30 minute session, additional exercise bouts can be added
to achieve 5 or more days per week [19].
In addition to formal exercise sessions, it is still important to
encourage more physical activity throughout one’s day. Sedentary
behavior is associated with reduced functional capacity, osteoporosis,
obesity, anxiety and depression, hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
colon cancer, stroke, breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus [23].
Some research has suggested that one hour of daily physical exercise
cannot compensate for the negative effects of inactivity on insulin
levels and plasma lipids if the rest of the day is spent sitting [24]. In
general, some is good, but more is better!
Intensity
Multiple different methods exist to determine exercise intensity.
Cardiorespiratory fitness generally focuses on heart rate. A percent of
the maximal heart rate (MHR) of an individual is selected (estimated
MHR = 220 - age in years) based on the level of intensity one is seeking
[25]. The different intensities and their respective percentages of MHR

 include: very light (<50% MHR), light (50-63% MHR), moderate
(64-76% MHR, vigorous (77-93% MHR), very hard (> 94% MHR), and
maximal (100% of MHR) [19]. Using heart rate in not effective if the
patient is on beta blockers and is less useful in the elderly.
Alternatively, the Borg scale of perceived exertion was developed
[26]. It is a subjective scale, ranging from 6-20 where a patient rates
how hard they feel like they are working (e.g. 7 = very, very light; 11 =
fairly light; 13 = somewhat hard; 15 = hard; 19 very, very hard). A high
correlation exists between a person's perceived exertion rating times 10
and his or her actual heart rate during physical activity. Despite being
subjective measure, a person’s exertion rating may provide a fairly good
estimate of heart rate during physical activity [26]. This scale is widely
used in cardiac rehabilitation centers as an easy way to monitor
intensity.
Perhaps the most simplified testing method to estimate intensity is
the “sing” or “talk test”
. “In general, if you’re doing moderate-intensity
activity you can talk, but not sing, during the activity. If you’re doing
vigorous-intensity activity, you will not be able to say more than a few
words without pausing for a breath [27]. Low intensity exercise still
allows for one to talk or sing while exercising.
Time
Fitness can improve in sessions as short as 10 minutes long and can
be split into morning and afternoon workouts [28-30]. If the patient
can only do 5 minutes, then starting at 5 minutes works. Some time is
better than no time! Perhaps the most basic prescription for patients is
a 5 minute walk from their home before turning around to come back.
Whatever the initial time goal, the most important aspect is allowing
the patient to set their own goal and their own type of exercise. The
ultimate goal for time is to meet the guidelines of accumulating 150
minutes of moderate intensity physical activity in a week or 75 minutes
of vigorous intensity physical activity in a week. Working slowly
towards these goals is recommended. Patients should only participate
in vigorous intensity physical activity if cleared medically for that level
of exertion.
Type
What is the best type of exercise? The exercise that a patient will
actually do. There is limitless flexibility in this category. The only real
salient points are patient safety and patient engagement. For many,
variety is key. If a patient enjoys walking, biking, swimming, yoga, or
Zumba encourage them to do all of them if they have the time and
opportunity. There is no right or wrong answer to the question what
type of exercise should a patient do. The danger point is intensity of the
activity. For example if a sedentary patient loves soccer or ice hockey
and decides to sign up for an adult league, this is dangerous, as the
patient will be going from sedentary to vigorous activity. The place to
start with these patients is doing basic drills of that sport at low
intensity at home or in a local field or ice rink. Patients should partake
in activities that they truly enjoy. The exercise counselor or
professional fitness trainer can encourage activity exploration and help
ensure that patients are getting a balanced fitness program that
includes cardiorespiratory exercise, resistance training, flexibility work,
and balance/agility training. The most important part of choosing the
type of exercise is to be supportive of the patient choosing the most
exciting, interesting, enjoyable, safe, and fun activities for them, FITT:

The Coach Approach
Research has shown that 15% of pharmaceutical prescriptions given
to patients are never filled and 50% of those suffering from chronic
disease cease to adhere to prescription recommendations [31]. Yet,
when the patient feels recognized by their clinician as a partner in the
health process, the rate of adherence is increased [32]. The clinician
can achieve this level of connection by utilizing the COACH™
Approach. Adhering to the COACH™ Approach will motivate the
patient to be more likely to follow through on the exercise prescription
recommendations. The COACH™ Approach differs from interacting
with the patient as an expert or sole authority and instead recognizes
the autonomy of the individual as a method of gaining trust and
encouraging compliance with recommendations.
Curiosity
Each patient is unique. The determination to maintain a level of
curiosity about the patient as an individual plays a role in not only
understanding them, but also, in creating a prescription that will hold
their interest and create a level of excitement instead of dread. Some
people like to run or pursue solitary activities, for others group
activities are best. Curiosity will help bring out what is important and
what matters.
Openness
An attitude of openness, non-judgment, and acceptance toward the
patient help the patient to feel understood and encourage
collaboration. Physicians sharing personal experiences with efforts to
increase physical activity levels themselves have been shown to
increase the patient’s perception of how believable and how motivating
the physician is [33]. With the physician using an open mind, the
patient sees the process as one of collaboration instead of dictation.
Appreciation
Expressing appreciation may not come naturally in the typical
clinician-patient relationship. However, appreciation and recognition
are powerful motivators. Appreciating any effort made by the patient
to be more active and acknowledging the patient’s character strengths
that can help the patient reach his or her goals are forms of
appreciation that will help propel the patient forward.
Compassion
Showing compassion to a patient requires focusing on delivering
messages and listening without a judgmental attitude. Compassion
recognizes humanity and failure. It also is the belief that one can
overcome obstacles to achieve a goal. When a clinician listens
attentively and reflects statements used by the patient or summarizes
ideas, thoughts and feelings expressed by the patient, the patient feels
heard and understood. In this way, the clinician demonstrates to the
patient the compassion that he or she feels inside. This is an important
step toward collaborating successfully.

 Honesty
All interactions with patients are built on a foundation of trust.
Honesty fosters trust and establishes an atmosphere that is conducive
to the work of co-creating a plan of action toward a healthier lifestyle.
This means honesty with the medical facts, the clinical findings, and
lab results. “This BMI puts you in the category of obesity which is a
recognized clinical condition according to the American Medical
Association,” might be difficult to say to a patient, but when said in a
non-judgmental, matter of fact way, it is more acceptable and can allow
for further discussion about the topic. “You fall into the category of
sedentary, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease,” is another
fact that needs to be communicated in this COACH approach style.
After stating the facts, checking in with the patient and asking, “What
do you think about that?” can help a patient manage the difficult news
and express his or her fears and feelings. This too fosters a high quality
connection between clinician and patient.
A study by Hillsdon et al compared two approaches of counseling
patients on the addition of physical activity with a control. The first
approach involved collaborating, negotiating, and conversing with the
patient about exercise. The second approach utilized warning, advising
and directing about the exercise and its benefits. When compared,
those patients who experienced the collaboration and negotiation
approach to their care were found to have exercised more minutes with
compared with the second approach [34]. The COACH™ Approach is a
powerful tool to aid in the likelihood of success when writing exercise
prescriptions.
Its Fun: Exercise Prescriptions that Work
A relative newcomer to the field of medicine and wellness, the
exercise prescription is designed to take advantage of the use of
exercise as medicine. By the addition of this lifestyle behavioral change
tool, patients can lose weight, improve their cardiovascular health, and
reduce the effects of depression, anxiety and stress. Yet, the
prescription can only be effective if it contains the right information
for the patient to follow and the patient has inherent interest in the
prescribed activity. Similar to pharmaceutical prescriptions, missing
information leaves the patient confused and unable to follow the
recommendation or worst, renders it useless. The IT’S FUN algorithm
is an easy way to remember what considerations must be made and
what information to include when writing an exercise prescription
(Table 2).
I = Interest level in exercise
t = Timeline of exercise history
s = Signs, symptoms and risk factors for disease
F = Favorite activities
u = Unusual activities or ideas
n = Negotiate and narrow the focus for exercise
Table 2:
Table 2: It’s fun mnemonic.
Interest level
The first step, that must take place as soon as an exercise
prescription is considered, is a conversation with the patient to
determine their interest level in participating in an exercise program. If
the level of interest or confidence level is too low, this will become an
impediment to the process that may not be overcome. Interest level can
be determined by asking a series of questions while showing
compassion and curiosity toward the patient.
How interested are you in talking about physical activity today?
Are you looking to increase your level of exercise any time soon?
Are you interested in how exercise may help decrease the amount of
stress (depression, anxiety) you are feeling?
If the patient is not interested in exercise at all, and says, “There is
no way that I can exercise. I have no time, and I am too tired.” Then, he
or she is in the pre-contemplative stage of change for adopting routine
physical activity. This patient is not ready to go forward in the
algorithm. Thus, strategies directed at the pre-contemplative stage are
the first step in counseling this type of patient. One simple strategy is
to ask the patient’s permission to share how exercise can benefit their
particular ailments and conditions. A statement and question similar
to this can open the door for a conversation, “I hear you say that there
is no way you can possibly exercise now since you are working two jobs
and your feet hurt. May I share with you some ways that exercise could
help you with glucose control and perhaps reduce the amount of
insulin you require each day?” Most patients respond to this request
for permission with a yes. They have control and use their autonomy to
allow the clinician to share information that is directly relevant to
them as the patient. This plants a seed for the initiation of exercise.
There are several ways to plant seeds for pre-contemplators. Another
way is to tell stories of people who were in similar situations to that
patient and let them hear the dramatic story of how the patient’s life
was changed by exercise. Recommending a book such as Spark by John
Ratey will allow them to consider the psychological benefits of exercise
on their own time, if they are interested. If nothing else, stating, “I
understand that exercise is not a possibility for you at this point in
your life. There are so many powerful effects of exercise that help a
patient’s mind including improving mood, decreasing stress levels, and
reducing anxiety levels as well as effects that help a patient’s body
including improving cardiac and metabolic functioning. Exercise is
powerful medicine. It effects are as powerful as many medications.
When you are ready and willing to speak about how exercise can
enhance your life, I am here for you and will be really excited to have a
conversation about exercise with you.” This simple statement honors
that patient’s autonomy, and it demonstrates how important exercise is.
Most importantly, it keeps the door open for future counseling sessions
to focus on exercise.
Timeline
Key sources of information about a patient’s condition related to
depression, anxiety and stress can be discovered by referring to a
detailed functional medicine timeline. By examining the antecedents
(family history, genetic factors, and trauma), triggers, and mediators in
the order in which they occurred, the clinician can gain valuable
insight into what will likely be the best course of action to help alleviate
a patient’s suffering. Asking about an exercise history including “What
did you do as a child for exercise, as a teenager in high school, as a
college student, as a young adult, and what are you currently doing?” is
important. It helps the clinician to understand how exercise has played
a role in the patient’s health and well-being throughout their lives.
Time of depression might correlate with times of sedentary behavior
preceding and or during the depression. Times of health and happiness
might be connected to times of increased physical activity. By asking

 about an exercise history, the clinician can really get to know the
patient and how activity affects his or her health.
Signs and symptoms
As with any prescription, it is important to make an accurate
assessment of signs and symptoms to determine the appropriateness of
the recommendation. Answers to direct questions, such as “
Are you
having any chest pain?” Or “
Are you experiencing any episodes of
shortness of breath?” will indicate the effectiveness of the exercise
recommendation for the patient. The Physical Activity Questionnaire
(PAR-Q) is used at many fitness facilities to screen members before
starting an exercise routine. The clinician can follow the American
College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for risk stratification
reviewed in detail previously in this article. It is important for a patient
to be properly screened prior to beginning an exercise routine. Any
history of, risk factors for, signs of or symptoms of cardiac, metabolic,
or endocrine conditions warrant further evaluation with a work up,
labs, EKG, stress test, or consultation with a specialist, depending on
the patient’s individual situation.
Favorites
Adherence to a physical activity program is aided if the activity
holds inherent enjoyment for the patient. It is therefore helpful to
inquire about the patient’s preferred ways to exercise. Probing for
favorites can take the following form:
When you were active, what was your favorite physical activity?
If you could do any exercise in the world, what would it be?
If you had all the time in the world, what would you do for exercise?
What activities bring you the most joy?
Unusual activities and ideas
While it is useful and recommended to investigate exercises known
and enjoyed by the patient, it is equally important to serve as a
resource for unusual activities. When thinking of exercises, many
patients may struggle to look for new ideas and relate the term
“exercise” only to working out in a gym, jogging or biking. Creative
approaches to physical activity can excite and motivate patients to get
started. In addition, discussing motivators, pesky obstacles, strategies
around barriers, and individual strengths, requires searching for the
unique, the personalized, and the most powerful ideas, which are not
usually the most common or straightforward ideas. Discovering
motivators to exercise that connect to the patient’s priorities and sense
of purpose is essential. For example, the patient might want to be able
to keep up with his or her grandchildren on the playground and in a
game of scrabble, describing the benefits of exercise in relation to brain
derived growth factor, BDNF, (also known as miracle grow for
neurons) as well as the cardiorespiratory fitness gains that exercise
provides can help the patient view exercise as a way of empowering his
or her body and mind and a way to keep up with young people. Many
people equate exercise with weight loss efforts, but it is much more
than that. Not many people know that exercise can increase the size of
the hippocampus (area of the brain that is involved in memory
consolidation). Emphasizing this little known, unusual fact, can help to
change a patient’s perspective on exercise. Providing new ideas
becomes particularly important once the patient has adhered to
exercise prescriptions for a length of time and has reached the level of
maintenance. Novel ideas infuse a measure of freshness to the exercise
program and may prevent periods of relapse.
Negotiate and narrow the focus
The final product of the exercise prescription will be the result of a
collaborative process in which the patient is included and the terms are
negotiated. Undoubtedly, the conversation between the clinician and
the patient created a myriad of ideas- each valuable in its own right.
The list of ideas needs to be narrowed down to create a plan that can be
implemented. The following series of questions can be used to help
narrow the focus and create a prescription in which the patient feels
both included and motivated:
Of all the things we have discussed today about exercise, what sticks
with you?
What are you taking away from our discussion about exercise?
What way forward do you see for yourself with regards to increasing
physical activity?
What is one small step you could take to move toward your exercise
goal?
A critical part of the negotiation step is to make sure the patient has
a safe goal. For example, it is not safe for a sedentary patient to engage
in vigorous activity. Often after an inspiring counseling session on
exercise, a patient might feel motivated to get started by “running a
marathon.” This is a lofty goal but not one that is appropriate in the
short term for a sedentary patient. This long term goal needs to be
broken down into multiple small steps, starting with a walking routine.
A sedentary patient needs to start with a low intensity exercise. This
will be a negotiation process with the patient. Similarly, if a sedentary
man wants to go back to enjoying ice hockey, he will need to start with
small steps such as buying skates that fit, sharpening the skates if he
has older ones that fit, going to an open ice skating session and starting
at a low intensity while comfortably skating around the rink.
Explaining the importance of increasing cardiorespiratory fitness levels
before jumping into a game situation is critical with the patient.
Negotiating and discussing the possibility of a walking program or a
stationary bicycling program that could be used to increase fitness in a
safe and effective way so that the patient will ultimately, in weeks or
months, be able to enjoy his target activity of ice hockey will be the art
of exercise prescription writing and counseling (Figure 1).

 Description of Figure 1: The algorithm has six main steps.
Step one:
Step one: Check in on interest level. If the patient is not interest and
is in pre-contemplation for exercise, then planting seeds, sharing
information with permission and most importantly making a
connection that leaves the door open for future conversations are the
goals.
Step two:
Step two: Create an exercise timeline and determine the patient’s
current level of exercise as well as past levels.
Step three:
Step three: Or safety, use the risk stratification system to determine
the level of risk the patient has for cardiac events during exercise.
Depending on the level of risk, the patient is cleared for different
intensities of physical activities. Collaborating with a primary care
physician, cardiologist, or other specialist depending on the patient’s
medical condition is advised. Further work up may be required prior
to moving forward with the algorithm. It is risky and dangerous for a
patient to go from sedentary to vigorous intensity exercise.
Step four:
Step four: Explore past and present favorite activities.
Step 
Step five:
five: Discover unusual activities of interest and unusual ideas
about motivators for exercise, unusual ideas to get around barriers to
exercise or unusual ways to use particular character strengths to reach
exercise goals.
Step six:
Step six: Negotiate and narrow down the focus of the exercise
session by discussing ways forward and making sure they are realistic,
safe, and empowering for the patient.
By using the IT’S FUN algorithm to guide the exercise prescription
writing process, a clinician can help reduce the effects of depression,
anxiety, and stress in a way that is safe for the patient, honors their
autonomy, and increases motivation as well as self-confidence. It is
important that this process include the utilization of the COACH
Approach to reach its maximum potential. By acting as a coach, and
not a dictator, a clinician will be the catalyst for sparking the patient’s
desire to participate in their own story of wellness success.
