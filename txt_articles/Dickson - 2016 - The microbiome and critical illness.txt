Abstract
The central role of the microbiome in critical illness is supported by a half century of experimental 
and clinical study. The physiological effects of critical illness and the clinical interventions of 
intensive care substantially alter the microbiome. In turn, the microbiome predicts patients’ 
susceptibility to disease, and manipulation of the microbiome has prevented or modulated critical 
illness in animal models and clinical trials. This Review surveys the microbial ecology of critically 
ill patients, presents the facts and unanswered questions surrounding gut-derived sepsis, and 
explores the radically altered ecosystem of the injured alveolus. The revolution in culture-
independent microbiology has provided the tools needed to target the microbiome rationally for 
the prevention and treatment of critical illness, holding great promise to improve the acute and 
chronic outcomes of the critically ill.
The forgotten organ in multiorgan failure
The common conditions of critical illness (including sepsis, acute respiratory distress 
syndrome [ARDS], and multiorgan failure) cause tremendous global mortality and an 
enormous and growing economic burden.1 Although specialties such as oncology and 
rheumatology have been revolutionised by the breakthroughs of molecular medicine, 
decades of research into the diseases of critical illness have yielded no targeted therapies. In 
practice, critical care remains synonymous with supportive care.
There are several possible reasons why no molecular therapies have been developed for 
these common and fatal diseases. One credible explanation is that the primary focuses of 
investigation, host inflammation and cellular injury, are downstream consequences of an 
overlooked upstream source: the diverse ecosystems of microbes on and in the human body. 
Interest in the microbiome has exploded in the past decade due to the advent of culture-
independent methods of identifying microbes.2,3 Although a wealth of clinical and 
experimental evidence suggests that the microbiome is central to the pathogenesis of critical 
illness, the common diseases of critical illness have been included in surprisingly few 
modern microbiome studies. In turn, review articles and clinical guidelines on critical illness

 largely ignore the microbiome, neglecting what is, effectively, a 1·5 kg organ containing 
more DNA than every host organ combined.
Critical illness and the interventions of intensive care substantially alter the microbiome. In 
turn, the microbiome predicts patients’ susceptibility to disease, and manipulation of the 
microbiome has prevented or modulated critical illness in animal models and clinical trials. 
In this Review, I describe the altered ecosystem of the microbiome in critically ill patients, 
focusing on the gut and lungs. I discuss the microbiome’s role in sepsis, ARDS, pneumonia, 
and exacerbations of chronic lung disease, and identify important unanswered questions that 
may now be resolved with the techniques of modern microbiology.
The ecological effects of critical illness
The observation at the heart of this Review—that critical illness alters the ecosystem of the 
body’s microbiota—was first made in a seminal study by Johanson and colleagues4 in 1969, 
decades before the dawn of high-throughput sequencing. Exposure to the hospital setting has 
minimal effect on the bacterial communities of the upper respiratory tract: the oropharynges 
of healthy hospital workers and minimally ill patients staying in hospital are no more 
frequently colonised by Gram-negative rods than are those in people with no hospital 
exposure (figure 1). Rather, the change in microbiota seen in patients staying in hospital 
depends on the severity of their illness rather than their physical location. Critical illness 
substantially alters the physiology of the host, which in turn alters the environmental 
conditions and community structures of resident microbes. This clinical observation 
illustrates an oft-cited tenet in microbial ecology, “Everything is everywhere, but the 
environment selects”.5 Decades later, we have an incomplete but growing understanding of 
how the internal environment of critically ill patients creates selective pressure on the 
relative growth of its microbiota.
The composition of every community, microbial or otherwise, is determined by the balance 
of three ecological factors: immigration into the community, elimination of members from 
the community, and the relative reproduction rates of the community’s members. Any 
change in the microbiome, whether it be chronic or acute, must be attributable to some 
combination of these three forces. All three are greatly altered in the gut and lung 
ecosystems of critically ill patients by the pathophysiological effects of critical illness and 
interventions of intensive care (tables 1, 2).
The primary route of immigration of microbes into the gut microbiome is via the 
oropharynx, which itself changes strikingly in critical illness. Johanson and colleagues4,7 
noted that in critically ill patients, healthy oral microbiota are displaced by gram-negative 
aerobes (figure 1), including prominent members of the Proteobacteria phylum. The 
catabolic starvation state of critical illness results in decreased immigration of food-
associated bacteria and decreased nutritional supply for commensal microbes.6 Well-studied 
interventions, such as topical oral decontamination, decrease the bacterial burden of the 
oropharynx and decrease immigration from the source community.44
In healthy individuals, the primary means of microbial elimination from the gut microbiome 
is transit through and from the gastrointestinal tract, which is normally rapid. Via defecation,

 a healthy adult expels about 1014 bacterial cells per day.63 In critically ill patients, transit 
time is substantially slowed by various pathophysiological (glucose and electrolyte 
disturbances8,9 and endogenous opioid production) and therapeutic (sedatives, opiates, and 
systemic catecholamines21) factors. In the stomach, which is normally fast to empty and 
extremely acidic, transit time slows36 and pH is neutralised by the use of agents to suppress 
the production of gastric acid.38,39 Other mechanisms of microbial elimination are impaired 
in critical illness: bile salt production drops,17 IgA production is impaired,31 and the dense 
mucosal barrier of secreted antimicrobial peptides is lost.25,26,32 The net effect is reduced 
elimination of bacteria, especially in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which is transformed 
into a pH-neutral reservoir that quickly becomes overgrown by Gram-negative bacteria.64
Environmental growth conditions of the gut are transformed in critical illness, which affects 
the relative reproduction rates of community members. Hypoperfusion and reperfusion of 
the intestinal wall results in intense mucosal inflammation, leading to a cascade of 
environmental changes. Increased nitrate concentrations13 and an altered mucosal oxygen 
gradient29 favour the growth of microbes in the Proteobacteria phylum, which contains 
many clinically familiar gram-negative rods, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
Escherichia coli, and some members of the Firmicutes phylum, such as Staphylococcus 
aureus and Enterococcus spp.14–16 Importantly, in many critically ill patients, the dense 
intestinal mucus layer is thinned, disrupted, or absent.25,26 This crucial anatomical 
component of gut anatomy harbours its own protective microbiota and provides a physical 
barrier between the intestinal ecosystem and the host. Almost every common clinical 
intervention used in intensive care (eg, enteral feeding,43 proton-pump inhibitors,38,39 
systemic catecholamines,22,23 and systemic antibiotics65,66) changes environmental growth 
conditions for intestinal bacteria (table 1).
The net effect of these alterations in ecology is an unstable and often collapsed community 
with catastrophically low diversity. The stomach and proximal small intestine, which are 
usually sparsely populated, become overgrown by a small number of species, such as E coli, 
P aeruginosa, and Enterococcus spp.67,68 The upper gastrointestinal tract becomes a 
stagnant reservoir of potential pathogens, the presence of which is predictive of extra-
abdominal infections and multiorgan failure.64,67 The lower gastrointestinal tract, which in 
healthy people contains hundreds of distinct bacterial species, loses diversity, and the 
community is overrun by a few (in some cases only one) bacterial species.20,69,70 Dominant 
species include S aureus, Enterococcus spp, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae family 
(including E coli and Klebsiella spp). P aeruginosa, which is normally low in abundance, 
grows in prominence.20,69,71 Additionally, normally rare fungi, such as Candida spp, bloom 
and thrive;20 culture-based detection of candidaemia is a marker of disease severity and 
predictive of a poor outcome.72 Viruses, archaea, and eukaryotes comprise less than 10% of 
the gut community in healthy individuals,73 and the effects of critical illness on abundance 
and behaviour of these organisms are unknown. This catastrophic drop in bacterial diversity, 
compared with the relatively subtle differences seen across chronic disease states, is 
astounding. In critical illness the gut microbiome resembles an infection rather than a 
community.

 The absence of specific bacteria in the gut is just as important as the presence of others. The 
resident microbes of the lower gastrointestinal tract normally serve essential metabolic and 
immunomodulatory functions. Even slight differences in the abundance of healthy gut 
bacteria have been implicated in diverse systemic diseases.74 The lower gastrointestinal tract 
in critically ill patients becomes an inhospitable desert for these stabilising resident 
microbes. For example, butyrate is the primary energy source for the epithelial cells that line 
the colon. Without butyrate these cells are starved and shrivel and degrade.75 Butyrate also 
dampens the intestinal and systemic immune response by stimulating the development of 
regulatory T cells.76 In studies of the gut microbiome in critically ill patients, butyrate-
producing bacteria are uncommon or absent,20,69–71 and butyrate production is at a 
minimum.71 The pathophysiological consequences of this condition are predictable 
(epithelial cell death and dysregulated inflammation), but the clinical consequences are 
unknown.
The ecological effects of critical illness are similarly extreme in the respiratory tract (table 
2). Although even healthy lungs are subject to constant immigration from oropharyngeal 
microbes via microaspiration,77–79 this immigration is accelerated due to depressed 
consciousness and endotracheal intubation. The dynamics of the aerodigestive tract become 
inverted during critical illness: whereas in health, the oropharynx is the primary source 
community for the lungs and the stomach,80 the overgrown microbial reservoir of the 
stomach and small intestine becomes the primary source community for the mouth and 
lungs.64,67 The oropharynx is usually populated by benign Prevotella spp and Veillonella 
spp,2,77,78 but becomes overrun by potentially pathogenic bacteria, including prominent 
Proteobacteria, such as P aeruginosa and K pneumoniae.4,7,81
Although elimination of microbes from the respiratory tract is accelerated in critical illness 
partly by the activation of immune defences, most pathophysiological and clinical factors 
decrease the rate of microbial elimination. Depressed consciousness and sedation blunt the 
cough reflex,46 and endotracheal intubation and acute illness impair the mucociliary 
escalator.47 Elevation of the head of the bed decreases the immigration rate of gastric 
microbiota,58 but it also impedes microbial elimination, which is predominantly gravity-
dependent when cough and mucociliary clearance are impaired.59 The inactivation of 
alveolar surfactant decreases the elimination of surfactant-sensitive bacteria.55,57
Finally, as discussed in detail below, acute illness substantially changes the environmental 
growth conditions of the lungs. The normally nutrient-poor environment of the alveolus is 
flooded with nutrient-rich oedema,55 pockets of oxygen and heterogeneous temperature 
gradients are established,48,49 and the signalling molecules of the host stress response 
selectively promote the growth of potential pathogens.23,50,51 The ubiquitous use of 
systemic antibiotics further alters the relative reproduction rates of community members. 
The predicted effect of these ecological forces in the lungs, therefore, is a state of increased 
immigration, decreased elimination, and favourable growth conditions for potential 
pathogens.61,82–84 Understanding of these ecological forces will be informed by 
longitudinal, culture-independent surveys of microbial com munities in the upper and lower 
respiratory tracts in critically ill patients.

 Gut-derived sepsis: the inarguable and the unknown
The suspicion that the intestinal microbiome can be turned against the host is as old as germ 
theory. In 1868, contemporaneous with Pasteur, Herman Senator speculated that “self-
infection” within the gastrointestinal tract could release systemic factors that cause fever, 
tachycardia, and obtundation.85 In 1952, a decade after the introduction of penicillin,86 Fine 
and colleagues87 reported that pretreating the gut with enteric antibiotics significantly 
lessened the risk of death in an animal model of haemorrhagic shock. In 1972, 5 years after 
the first description of ARDS,88 Cuevas and colleagues89 showed that the disease could be 
prevented in animal models of shock by pretreatment with enteric antibiotics.
During severe systemic illness, such as sepsis or haemorrhagic shock, the bacterial content 
of the gut determines the severity of systemic injury (figure 2). When the bacterial burden of 
the gut is minimised, either by pretreatment with enteric antibiotics or by use of germ-free 
animals, the inflammation and injury sustained by distal organs in shock is lessened. This 
relation has been reported consistently across species (mice,90,93 rats,94 rabbits,89 and 
dogs87), types of shock (haemorrhage,87 sepsis,89 and ischaemia–reperfusion90), and 
decades of rigorous inquiry. The microbiome, therefore, is of clear relevance to any 
discussion of precision medicine in critical care: the treatment groups in these studies 
differed not in genetics or exposure history but rather only in their microbiota (figure 2).
In the 1980s, these experimental observations prompted clinical investigation of the 
suppression of gut bacteria in patients at risk of critical illness. Selective decontamin ation of 
the digestive tract (SDD) is achieved by prophylactic administration of antibiotics tailored to 
keep overgrowth of potential pathogens in the gut to a minimum. Since the first (which was 
also the first positive) randomised controlled trial in 1987,95 SDD has been tested in more 
than 65 randomised controlled trials studying more than 15000 patients.96 The findings are 
unambiguous: patients who receive SDD are less likely to develop multiorgan failure91 or 
die96 than patients who do not (figure 2). Nevertheless, clinical use of SDD remains 
uncommon, especially in North America, due to perceived risk of antimicrobial resistance, 
although this concern is not supported by large clinical trials and meta-analyses.97 Although 
the ecological effects of SDD on antibiotic-resistant pathogens at the intensive-care-unit 
level remain controversial,98 the reality of the patient-level benefits are beyond debate.
This connection between patients’ microbiota and their susceptibility to critical illness has 
been reinforced by an even broader scope of study. When more than 10000 hospital 
inpatients were stratified according to estimated degrees of intestinal dysbiosis, a strong and 
consistent dose–response relation was uncovered between disorder of the microbiome and 
subsequent development of severe sepsis.99 This association between the microbiome and 
susceptibility to critical illness has, therefore, been shown at every level of inquiry: the 
laboratory bench, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and population studies. Yet, despite the 
clarity of this biological signal, the mechanisms behind it remain controversial and 
incompletely understood.
The oldest, most intuitive explanation for so-called gut-derived sepsis is that in states of 
critical illness, bacteria and bacterial products escape from the gut and translocate via the

 bloodstream to distal organs, where they provoke inflammation and injury. The intestinal 
wall of critically ill patients is permeable, and the degree of permeability correlates with 
subsequent risks of organ injury and death.100 However, in a study of trauma patients at high 
risk of multiorgan failure,101 serial blood cultures drawn from indwelling portal vein 
catheters have shown minimum evidence of bacterial translocation and no association 
between portal vein bacteraemia and subsequent illness. The explanation of bacterial 
translocation, at least via a blood-borne route, therefore, waned in popularity. The 
explanation was subsequently refined after consideration of intestinal anatomy.12 The lower 
gastrointestinal tract drains not only into the portal circulation but also into mesenteric 
lymph nodes. These nodes drain to the thoracic duct, which in turn empties into the left 
subclavian vein. Therefore, the lungs are the first capillary bed in the body to filter the 1–4 L 
chyle per day that is emptied into the blood via the thoracic duct. These anatomical 
considerations gave rise to the so-called gut-lymph hypothesis.12
Substantial clinical and experimental evidence supports the gut-lymph hypothesis. In clinical 
studies of critically ill high-risk surgical patients and in animal studies of shock, bacteria 
have been cultured from the mesenteric lymph nodes.10,12,102 Furthermore, detection of 
bacteria in mesenteric lymph is predictive of subsequent sepsis and infectious 
complications.10,103 In animal studies of shock, ligation of the mesenteric duct protected 
against lung injury,102 and the harvested mesenteric lymph of critically ill animals can 
provoke lung injury in otherwise healthy animals.104 Of note, the toxicity of this lymph does 
not depend on the presence of endotoxin or of detectable bacteria,104 which suggests that 
other bacterial or tissue injury factors are important mediators of injury.
A final explanation for gut-derived sepsis posits that translocation of microbes and microbial 
products is not necessary for the microbiome to cause systemic inflammation and 
injury.22,105,106 Just as the community composition of the gut microbiome is altered by the 
intestinal environment in critically ill patients, the behaviour and virulence of individual 
community members are also changed.22 A bacterial strain that is normally inert and 
invisible to the host immune system can be transformed by the conditions of critical illness, 
gaining virulence that ignites systemic inflammation and sepsis. The virulence of pathogens 
familiar in intensive care is promoted by conditions of nutrient scarcity, competition from 
neighbouring community members, disruption of stabilising commensal relationships,20 and 
exposure to the mediators of the host stress response (eg, catecholamines, inflammatory 
cytokines, and endogenous opioids39,47,48).
In all likelihood, the pathogenesis of gut-derived sepsis, like most processes in critical 
illness, is multifactorial, replete with biological redundancy.106,107 All three hypotheses 
(systemic translocation, gut-lymph translocation, and in-situ virulence) probably explain 
complementary features of a complex pathogenesis of multiorgan failure, and all three will 
be informed by the revolution in culture-independent microbiology. The detection and 
identification of translocated bacteria and characterisation of collapsing gut communities are 
no longer limited by insensitive culture-based techniques, which cannot detect most gut 
bacteria.108 Modern techniques will also inform understanding of how clinical interventions 
contribute to these parallel processes. Many daily therapies and interventions in intensive 
care increase intestinal permeability (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs109 and

 parenteral feeding55,82), bacterial translocation (eg, antibiotics,65 corticosteroids,110 and 
opiates111), and bacterial virulence (eg, opiates19 and catecholamines22,51). With modern 
techniques, the mechanisms behind the microbiome’s role in the progression from acute 
injury to systemic inflammation to multiorgan failure to death can finally be unfolded.
The radically altered ecology of the injured alveolus
Even in healthy individuals the lungs are subject to constant bombardment by bacteria from 
the upper respiratory tract.77–80 Unlike the gut, however, the alveolar space is an 
ecologically unfavourable environment for most bacteria and reproduction is minimal.77,112 
An important reason for low reproduction is the lack of nutrient substrate for bacterial 
metabolism. Whereas the gut lumen offers an abundance of protein and carbohydrate energy 
sources, the alveolus is empty except for the thin bactericidal layer of lipid-rich surfactant 
that lines the epithelium. From the perspective of bacteria, healthy alveoli are inhospitable. 
In states of alveolar injury, however, such as in ARDS or pneumonia, the environmental 
conditions shift abruptly (figure 3). The previously empty alveoli are flooded with protein-
rich fluid, providing a newly abundant energy source for reproducing microbes. The 
bactericidal surfactant layer is inactivated55,57 and microbial elimination is slowed by 
impairment of mucociliary clearance.47 Ecologically, the injured alveoli begin to resemble 
the gut more than healthy lungs and, therefore, it is unsurprising that most pathogens that 
arise in critical illness are of enteric origin. The microbiome and alveolar injury can propel 
each other in a dysregulated feedback loop that spans the host–microbiome divide (figure 
3).55,113
Important features of the relation between alveolar injury and lung microbiota have been 
validated by innovative animal studies.56 Sterile direct lung injury in mice leads to increases 
in the bacterial content of the lungs, indicating increased reproduction. The lung community 
membership shifts towards overgrowth of specific community members that were present in 
small numbers before injury. Lavage fluid from injured lungs contains the specific nutrients 
that are metabolised by the newly enriched species, as predicted by the hypothesis that lung 
injury alters the microbiome via changes in nutrient availability. Finally, when the bacterial 
communities from injured lungs are introduced into the lungs of otherwise healthy mice, 
they provoke more inflammation and injury than do bacteria acquired from uninjured lungs. 
These novel findings reveal numerous new targets for clinical intervention. Virtually all 
preventive and therapeutic strategies for ARDS have been aimed at blunting host 
inflammation and injury. This model suggests that the dynamic interface between the host 
and its disordered lung communities (figure 3) is a ripe, unexplored target for intervention.
This model of pathogenesis can apply to ARDS and to pneumonia, and might explain why 
such extensive clinical overlap exists between the two disorders. Pneumonia is the most 
common cause of ARDS,114 and roughly half of patients with established ARDS develop 
pneumonia during intensive care.114,115 In the most convincing study so far to test the 
preventive value of lung-protective ventilation in patients without ARDS, the intraoperative 
use of larger tidal volumes (which induce alveolar injury and leak,60 figure 3) increased the 
rate of postoperative pneumonia by a factor of five (from 1·5% to 8·0%).116

 Nutrient supply is not the only way the ecology of the alveolus changes in critically ill 
patients. The influx of oedema creates steep oxygen gradients, which shape bacterial 
community structure.29,48 Surfactant is inactivated, which disinhibits the growth of sensitive 
bacteria,55,57 and mucociliary clearance is impaired.47 The cells of innate immunity 
(macrophages and neutrophils) increase in number and activation, which causes the alveolar 
concentration of molecules related to the host stress response to increase.117
These molecular stress signals—increased concentrations of catecholamines and 
inflammatory cytokines—affect lung bacteria.118,119 In vitro, the growth of P aeruginosa is 
increased by the presence of catecholamines (figure 4).51 In human bronchoalveolar lavage 
samples, increased alveolar catecholamine concentrations correlate strongly with collapse of 
the lung microbiome around one dominant species (most frequently P aeruginosa, figure 
4).50 Thus any source of alveolar injury and inflammation, whether direct (eg, aspiration or 
ventilator-induced lung injury60) or indirect (eg, sepsis or shock) can trigger a cascade of 
inflammation leading to increased concentrations of intra-alveolar catechol amines,120 
which in turn promote the growth and virulence of select bacterial community members and 
a disordered bacterial community that perpetuates alveolar inflammation (figure 4). 
Bacterial growth promotion by host stress molecules is not unique to P aeruginosa, and is 
also seen with Streptococcus pneumoniae,121 S aureus,122 and Klebsiella pneumoniae.123 
Additionally, as well as catecholamines, growth promotion is seen with TNFα, interleukins 
1, 6, and 8, and glucocorticoids.23,24,124,125 The web of interactions between the lung 
microbiome and alveolar inflammation is complex, dynamic, and bidirectional.
Exacerbations of chronic lung disease are not acute bacterial infections
Not all respiratory failure in intensive care is attributable to alveolar injury. A common 
presentation is the clinical exacerbation of chronic airway diseases, such as asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. These 
exacerbations are associated with increased and persistent airway inflammation, and result 
in severe morbidity and death and high expense related to intensive care.126
Although viral infections have an unambiguous role as a common precipitant of 
exacerbations, the role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of exacerbations has been 
controversial for decades.126 The theory that exacerbations represent acute bacterial 
infections ranges from universally assumed (cystic fibrosis127 and bronchiectasis128) to 
highly controversial (COPD53) to widely dismissed (asthma129). Confusion and debate on 
this issue stems from the poor sensitivity of culture-based approaches in the characterisation 
of lung communities.2,126 Culture-independent techniques have helped to clarify this long-
debated relation between bacteria, infections, and exacerbations.
Ecologically, infections are characterised by an increase in microbial burden and a decrease 
in community diversity, coupled with increased host inflammation and tissue injury. 
Bacterial pneumonia, a true lung infection, exemplifies these features: it is characterised by 
increased bacterial burden and low community diversity (generally one dominant 
pathogen).62,83,130 These features correlate tightly with multiple indices of host

 inflammation, including alveolar neutrophilia93 and high alveolar concentrations of 
catecholamines50 and TNF-α.131
By contrast, exacerbations consistently lack these defining ecological features of infection. 
Culture-independent studies have compared bacterial communities at baseline and during 
exacerbations in the airways of patients with COPD,132,133 cystic fibrosis,134–138 or 
bronchiectasis.139 With remarkable consistency, all studies report no increase in bacterial 
burden and no decrease in community diversity during exacerbations. By any conventional 
or modern definition, therefore, exacerbations are not acute bacterial infections of the 
airways.
Nor do exacerbations behave clinically like true acute respiratory infections, such as 
pneumonia. Whereas invitro bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics is crucial in the management 
of pneumonia, there is no detectable relation between antibiotic susceptibility of cultured 
organisms and clinical response to therapy in exacerbations, even in cystic fibrosis.140,141 
Antibiotics are unquestionably useful in the treatment of pneumonia, but in respiratory 
exacerbations views on their use range from controversial (COPD) to useless (asthma). 
Additionally, whereas pneumonia is the most common cause of sepsis, exacerbations rarely 
or never provoke a septic response.
Although exacerbations are not bacterial infections, the microbiome is clearly involved in 
the pathogenesis of exacerbations. Baseline differences in airway microbiota are predictive 
of subsequent exacerbation frequency.142 The intervention most consistently proven to 
decrease exacerbation frequency (in COPD,143 cystic fibrosis144 and bronchiectasis145) is 
azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic. In exacerbation states, membership of the lung 
bacterial community shifts, often towards enrichment of the Proteobacteria phylum,133,146 
which contains clinically relevant Gram-negative rods, such as Pseudomonas spp and 
Haemophilus spp. As opposed to infections, therefore, exacerbations are more accurately 
described as respiratory dysbiosis: disorder of the respiratory ecosystem coupled with a 
dysregulated host immune response. Airway inflammation leads to altered microbial growth 
conditions and the resulting disordered bacterial community further drives airway 
inflammation.126 This self-perpetuating positive-feedback loop might explain why clinical 
exacerbations can last weeks longer than the presence of their triggers, and why macrolides 
(which have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects147) have such consistently 
demonstrated preventive benefits across diseases.143–145
Important clinical lessons and areas for further study
With virtually every treatment used in intensive care, the patient’s microbiota are knowingly 
or unknowingly manipulated (tables 1, 2). In view of the clear relevance of the microbiome 
to outcomes in critically ill patients, the ecological effects of interventions must be studied 
rigorously. In instances in which the effects are known, they should be taken seriously. For 
instance, proton-pump inhibitors decrease elimination of gastric microbiota38 and increase 
immigration of bacteria into the lungs, which increases the risk of pneumonia.148 
Maddeningly, however, proton-pump inhibitors are commonly included in treatment bundles 
purported to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, and are prescribed indiscriminately to

 critically ill patients. Other common interventions need to be reconsidered from an 
ecological perspective. Raising of the head of the patient’s bed decreases immigration to the 
lungs of gastric microbiota compared with supine positioning,149 but this practice also 
compromises microbial elimination from the lungs, which is gravitationally dependent in 
critically ill patients.59 Lowering the head of the bed might be more protective than raising 
it,59 but has not been studied in clinical trials. Historically, the composition of enteral 
nutrition has been tailored to meet the perceived metabolic needs of the host, without taking 
into account its effects on the microbiome. This approach, however, might overlook the 
most direct means of shaping environmental growth conditions within the gut microbiome.41 
Observational human studies alone cannot disentangle the effects of critical illness from the 
effects of its treatment (eg, antibiotics). Thus future investigation of the microbiome’s role 
in critical illness will require the use of animal studies and prospective, controlled human 
trials.
The microbiome can be manipulated therapeutically, as has been shown by the success of 
faecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of refractory Clostridium difficile 
infection. Evidence of therapeutic manipulation of the microbiome in critical illness is 
promising.106 SDD is the most thoroughly studied intervention in critical care research, and 
has unambiguous benefits in the prevention of infections, multiorgan failure, and death.91,96 
Early intensive-care studies of probiotics suggest that they decrease the risk of pneumonia 
and shorten the length of stay in the intensive-care unit for ventilated patients150 and 
decrease systemic infections in high-risk postoperative patients.151 Improved survival has 
been reported in a mouse model of sepsis.152 These blunt and broad interventions, with one-
size-fits-all cocktails of antibiotics or probiotics, however, represent the opposite of targeted 
therapy. With the advent of culture-independent microbiology, the means are at last 
available to identify specific features of the microbiome that promote and disrupt 
homoeostasis in critically ill patients. At the current pace of development, point-of-care 
community sequencing and identification of pathogens will be available and affordable 
within years rather than decades.62,144 Improved understanding of what constitutes a healthy 
microbiome is urgently needed in this population so that rational therapies to restore and 
maintain it can be developed.
The microbiome is central to the biology of critical illness and, therefore, should be included 
in any discussion of disease phenotyping in intensive care. Most studies and reviews of 
precision medicine in critical illness, however, focus on host genetics, immune responses, 
and exposures.153–155 None of these accounts for the differences in outcomes attributable 
solely to differences in patients’ microbiota (figure 2). Before tailored therapy can be 
provided to patients, how the microbiota informs prognosis and response to treatment needs 
to be understood. All clinical trials in critical illness should consider assessment of the 
microbiome, in the gut and the lungs, as an important secondary outcome, as both a 
mediator of disease and as a modifier of therapy.
Neonates represent an important and understudied population as they are highly vulnerable 
to alterations in the developing microbiome and to life-threatening critical illnesses. 
Premature neonates are subjected to innumerable microbiome-altering exposures (eg, 
antibiotics and formula feeding) and lack mature innate and adaptive immune responses. In

 multiple studies, the composition of the early gut microbiome has been predictive of 
neonatal sepsis,70,156,157 which can be plausibly explained by either enteric harbouring of 
potential pathogens or systemic immune derangements provoked by intestinal dysbiosis. 
Experimental data suggest that early exposure to a diverse intestinal microbiome is essential 
for the development of an intact immune response: newborn mice with antibiotic-suppressed 
microbiota have increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections158 and bacterial sepsis.159 
Necrotising enterocolitis, a devastating and idiopathic disease of neonates, has been linked 
to intestinal dysbiosis in animal160 and human studies,161 and randomised controlled trials 
support a protective role of probiotics.162,163 The acute and chronic consequences of 
dysbiosis in neonates are worthy of immediate clinical and experimental study.
Finally, although this Review has focused on the causes and consequences of acute 
perturbations of the microbiome in critical illness, the research into intensive-care outcomes 
in the past decade has convincingly shown that the sequelae of critical illness persist long 
after patients are extubated and discharged. Survivors of ARDS and sepsis have chronic 
deficits in cognitive function and functional status, and are at high risk of re-admission in 
the months after discharge,164 disproportionately so for infection-related events. The 
mechanisms underlying this so-called postintensive-care syndrome are poorly understood, 
but the contribution of a persistently altered microbiome should be explored. Derangements 
of the microbiome persist for weeks and months after even a short antibiotic course,66 and 
how quickly or completely the microbiome recovers after the insults and disruptions of 
critical illness are unknown. Research is needed to define the natural history of microbiome 
recovery after critical illness, to determine whether recovery can be accelerated (eg, via 
probiotics or faecal microbiota transplantation), and whether this recovery improves long-
term outcomes for patients. In patients recovering from multiorgan failure, it may be that 
microbiome is the last organ to recover.
Conclusions
Although the importance of the microbiome in critical illness has been established for a half 
century, the revolution in culture-independent microbiology has at last yielded tools capable 
of determining its contribution to the pathogenesis of sepsis, ARDS, and multiorgan failure. 
Continuing clinical and experimental trials will explore how the microbiome is altered in 
disease, and in turn how its disturbance perpetuates organ injury. The microbiome represents 
a key therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of critical illness, and should be 
included in any discussion of precision medicine in the intensive care unit.

 Search strategy and selection criteria
I searched MEDLINE and Web of Science without date or language restrictions, with the 
initial search terms of “([microbiota] OR [flora]) AND ([sepsis] OR [shock] OR [acute 
respiratory distress syndrome] OR [multiorgan failure]).”
I manually screened titles and abstracts to exclude unrelated studies. I read all relevant 
articles, and identified additional relevant articles via citations. Due to space limitations, 
only references with immediate relevance to topics discussed in the Review are included.

 Key messages
•
The microbial ecosystems of the gut and the lungs change substantially in 
critically ill patients, resulting in dramatic changes to bacterial communities
•
In animal studies of shock, the microbial contents of the gut determine the 
severity of multiorgan failure and the risk of death, an observation supported by 
trials of selective manipulation of the gut microbiome in human beings
•
The mechanisms that drive gut-derived sepsis are incompletely understood and 
multifactorial, offering numerous unexplored therapeutic targets
•
During lung injury, the bacterial ecosystem of the alveolus shifts to a state of 
abundance in nutrients and growth-promoting host stress signals, leading to a 
positive feedback loop of inflammation and dysbiosis
•
The microbiome is a key therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of 
critical illness, and it should be included in any discussion of precision medicine 
in the intensive care unit

(A) In diverse models of shock, germ-free mice are protected from the alveolar 
inflammation and injury seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.90 (B) In clinical trials, 
manipulation of gut microbiota with antibiotics (selective decontamination of the digestive 
tract) protects against extra-abdominal infections, multiorgan failure, and death.91,92 Part A

 Figure 3. Alteration of bacterial ecology in injured alveoli
(A) Unlike in the healthy gut, the environment in healthy lungs is nutrient poor for bacteria 
and the protein content of alveolar lavage fluid is at a minimum. (B) In states of health, 
bacterial growth in the alveolar space is limited by the local inflammatory response it 
provokes and by its depletion of available nutrients. In conditions of alveolar injury, such as 
in ARDS and pneumonia, the alveolar space is flooded with nutrient-rich fluid, which 
promotes bacterial growth that in turn perpetuates a positive-feedback loop of inflammation, 
injury, alveolar oedema, and further dysbiosis. BAL=bronchoalveolar lavage. ARDS=acute 
respiratory distress syndrome. Part B was reproduced from reference 113 by permission of

 Figure 4. Catecholamines and disorder in the alveolar bacterial ecosystem
(A) The growth of bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is promoted in vitro by 
catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and dopamine.51 (B) In the human lung 
microbiome, increased catecholamine concentrations are strongly associated with 
community collapse and the emergence of one dominant species.50 (C) In states of critical 
illness, direct and indirect lung injury provoke alveolar inflammation, which promotes 
catecholamine production and creates a positive-feedback loop of dysbiosis and 
inflammation.50 CFU=colony forming unit. VILI=ventilator-induced lung injury. Part A
