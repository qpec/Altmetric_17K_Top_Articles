IMPORTANCE Self-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) has the
potential to increase access and availability of evidence-based therapy and reduce the cost of
depression treatment.
OBJECTIVES To estimate the effect of self-guided iCBT in treating adults with depressive
symptoms compared with controls and evaluate the moderating effects of treatment
outcome and response.
DATA SOURCES A total of 13 384 abstracts were retrieved through a systematic literature
search in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library from database inception to
January 1, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials in which self-guided iCBT was compared with a
control (usual care, waiting list, or attention control) in individuals with symptoms of
depression.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Primary authors provided individual participant data from
3876 participants from 13 of 16 eligible studies. Missing data were handled using multiple
imputations. Mixed-effects models with participants nested within studies were used to
examine treatment outcomes and moderators.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory, Center
for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale, and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire
scores. Scales were standardized across the pool of the included studies.
RESULTS Of the 3876 study participants, the mean (SD) age was 42.0 (11.7) years, 2531
(66.0%) of 3832 were female, 1368 (53.1%) of 2574 completed secondary education, and
2262 (71.9%) of 3146 were employed. Self-guided iCBT was significantly more effective than
controls on depressive symptoms severity (β = −0.21; Hedges g = 0.27) and treatment
response (β = 0.53; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.52-2.50; number needed to treat, 8).
Adherence to treatment was associated with lower depressive symptoms (β = −0.19;
P = .001) and greater response to treatment (β = 0.90; P < .001). None of the examined
participant and study-level variables moderated treatment outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Self-guided iCBT is effective in treating depressive symptoms.
The use of meta-analyses of individual participant data provides substantial evidence for
clinical and policy decision making because self-guided iCBT can be considered as an
evidence-based first-step approach in treating symptoms of depression. Several limitations of
the iCBT should be addressed before it can be disseminated into routine care.

M
any studies1-4 have found that depressive symp-
toms can be effectively treated with psycho-
therapy, pharmacotherapy, or both. Nevertheless,
many people with depressive symptoms do not seek help, and
evenwell-resourcedhealthcaresystemsfinditdifficulttomar-
shal enough qualified therapists to offer psychological inter-
ventions. Access barriers to psychotherapy include limited
availability of trained clinicians, high cost of treatment, and
fear of stigmatization.5-8 As a consequence, a significant
number of individuals with depressive symptoms remain
untreated.9,10
Self-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy
(iCBT) without therapist support can allow physicians, such
as general practitioners, to provide easy and affordable ac-
cess to psychological treatments and reduce the cost of such
treatments. A meta-analysis11 found a small but significant ef-
fect size of self-guided iCBT compared with control condi-
tions.However,recentlargetrialsfoundarangeofeffects,vary-
ing from small to moderate effect sizes12,13 to no effect.14,15
These contradicting findings drew much attention and raised
concerns about the benefits of these interventions.
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and study-level system-
atic reviews often lack adequate power and precision in their
estimates. Statistically underpowered samples also preclude
identification of clinically useful moderators or predictors of
treatment outcome.16 Meta-analyses using individual partici-
pant data (IPD) estimate aggregate effect sizes using IPD from
RCTs. The IPD maximize power to detect a true effect while
allowing the exploration of study variability (eg, level of sup-
port, treatment adherence, setting) and participant character-
istics as moderators of treatment outcome. The present study
reports the results of an IPD meta-analysis of trials on self-
guided iCBT for adult depressive symptoms compared with
control conditions. The term self-guided iCBT is defined as CBT
delivered via the internet, which may involve automated feed-
back but does not provide support related to the therapeutic
content.
Methods
Eligibility Criteria
Studies were included if the participants were adults (aged >18
years) with elevated symptoms of depression based on any di-
agnosis or any self-report scale of depression. Only those RCTs
in which self-guided iCBT was compared with a control con-
dition (usual care, waiting list, or attention control) were in-
cluded. No language or publication status exclusions were
applied.
Study Identification and Selection Process
The analysis was completed in compliance with the Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-
analyses (PRISMA) IPD Statement.17 We used an existing da-
tabase on psychological treatments for depression18 that is
updated annually by a systematic literature search in the bib-
liographicdatabasesofPubMed,Embase,PsycINFO,andCoch-
rane Library (from inception to January 1, 2016). In these
searches, various index and free terms of psychotherapy and
depression are used in different combinations (full search
stringsforPubMedareprovidedintheeMethodsintheSupple-
ment). Two researchers (P.C. and E.K.) independently exam-
ined titles and abstracts of 13 384 articles. The full text of stud-
ies that possibly met the inclusion criteria according to 1 of the
2 reviewers was retrieved. In case of disagreement regarding
inclusion, consensus was sought through discussion. We also
asked key researchers in the field whether they knew of un-
published trials.
Data Collection and Data Items
Authors of eligible articles were contacted for permission to
use their data sets. Reminders were sent after 2 weeks and if
necessary after 1 month. If no response was received, we ex-
cluded the trial. Authors were asked to provide data on so-
ciodemographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics, in-
cludinginformationregardingrandomizedgroup,baselineand
follow-up total scores of depressive symptoms, treatment
adherence information (total number of sessions completed
divided by total number of treatment sessions), age, sex, edu-
cationallevel(primary,secondary,andtertiaryeducation),em-
ployment status (employed or unemployed), relationship
status (in a relationship or not), and comorbid anxiety symp-
toms at baseline (yes or no; based on a clinical interview or el-
evated anxiety symptoms ratings on self-report measures). Fi-
nally, we combined all individual data sets into a merged data
set, using a generic standardized protocol for integrating IPD
sets.1 We also used study-level variables, which were avail-
able from the full reports (type of comparator condition, re-
cruitment, level of support). The selection of moderator vari-
ables has been based on previous literature related to
moderators of face-to-face CBT or iCBT.16,19
Risk of Bias Assessment in Individual Studies
We examined the risk of bias in the included studies using the
criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias assessment
tool.20 Two independent reviewers (E.K., P.C.) evaluated the
included studies to determine whether there was a risk for bias
relatedtoselection,performance,detection,attrition,andout-
come reporting. In case of unclear risk of bias for 1 or more key
domains, we contacted the first authors of the included stud-
ies for clarifications.
Key Points
Questions Is self-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral
therapy effective in treating depressive symptoms and which
variables moderate treatment outcome?
Findings In this meta-analysis of individual participant data from
3876 adults, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy was
more effective compared with controls. Adherence predicted
better treatment outcomes within the experimental condition.
Meaning Self-guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy
may be a viable alternative to current first-step treatment
approaches for symptoms of depression, particularly in those
individuals who are not willing to have any therapeutic contact.

Traditional Meta-analysis
We conducted a traditional meta-analysis to examine differ-
ences among the 13 studies that provided the IPD and the 3
studies that did not. We used data reported in the articles to
calculate the effect sizes (Hedges g).21 The reader is referred
to the eMethods in the Supplement for details regarding the
methods of the traditional meta-analysis.
IPD Meta-analysis
Studies included in this IPD meta-analysis used measures such
as the Center of Epidemiologic Studies–Depression Scale,22 the
Beck Depression Inventory I23 or II,24 (hereafter referred to
as Beck Depression Inventory) or the 9-item Patient Health
Questionnaire25tomonitorchangeindepressivesymptomsse-
verity. These depression measures were standardized by trans-
formation into z scores across the pool of the studies before
conducting the main analysis.
Missing outcome data at the posttreatment assessment
were estimated using multiple imputation under the missing-
at-randomassumption(miimputemvninSTATAsoftware,ver-
sion 13.1; StataCorp). This method generated 100 imputed data
sets using data on baseline depressive symptoms scores, age,
sex, and group. These new imputed data sets included the ob-
served and the imputed standardized depressive symptoms
scores for the missing values. They were analyzed separately
using the selected model, and the results were averaged ac-
cordingtoRubin’
srules.26Wealsoconductedsensitivityanaly-
ses using only participants with complete data after treat-
menttoexaminewhethertherewasadifferencebetweenthose
who dropped out of the RCTs and those who provided post-
treatment data.
In a 1-stage IPD meta-analysis, we merged all IPD from all
studies with participants nested within studies. One-stage IPD
meta-analysis yields more precise and less biased estimates
of effect, maximizes the power, and accounts for parameter
correlation.27,28 We calculated the standardized β coefficient
for the examined comparisons. This estimate indicates how
many SDs the dependent variable (depressive symptoms se-
verityorthelogoddsratio[OR]oftreatmentresponse)changes
per SD increase in the predictor variable. Thus, the higher the
β is the greater the effect of the predictor variable on the de-
pendent variable, although there is no association among the
variables if the β is 0. All analyses were conducted with STATA
statistical software, version 131. The primary analysis was
2-fold. First, we analyzed the effects of the interventions on
depressive symptom severity at the end of treatment using a
multilevel mixed-effects linear regression (using a random in-
tercepts model with a random effect for each trial and fixed
effects for the intervention and the symptoms severity, using
STATA’
s mixed command). The posttreatment depression
scores were used as the dependent variable and trial arm con-
dition(treatmentvscontrol)astheindependentvariable,while
controlling for baseline depressive symptom severity.
Second, we analyzed the effects of the interventions on
treatment response (defined as a 50% reduction in baseline de-
pressive symptoms scores) at the posttreatment assessment
usingamultilevelmixed-effectslogisticregression(usingaran-
dom intercepts model with a random effect for each trial and
fixed effects for the intervention and the depressive symp-
toms severity, using STATA’
s melogit command). The re-
sponse (yes or no) was the dependent variable, and condition
was the independent variable.

ses were conducted using a mixed-effects model in which the
random-effects model was used to pool studies within sub-
groups, whereas between-subgroup differences were tested as
fixed effects. We also ran meta-regression analyses to examine
theassociationbetweentreatmentdurationandtreatmentout-
comes (severity of depressive symptoms and treatment
response).
Exploration of Variation in Effects:
Participant-Level Moderators
We tested whether available demographic and clinical char-
acteristics moderated the effect of self-guided iCBT on de-
pression outcomes (depressive symptoms severity and treat-
ment response). Not all included studies reported data on the
examinedmoderators(forprecisenumbersregardingthemiss-
ing data, see Table 1 and Table 2). To examine moderators, we
added the interaction between each potential moderator and
treatment outcome on depression severity into the multi-
levelmixed-effectslinearregressionmodel.Wesimilarlyadded
the interaction between each potential moderator and treat-
ment response into the multilevel mixed-effects logistic re-
gression model. Each potential moderator was included in a
separate model as a main effect.

of the 16 eligible trials (81%), yielding a total of 3876
participants.12,14,15,30-38 Three eligible data sets39-41 were un-
available and thus could not be included in the IPD meta-
analyses. Figure 1 shows the study selection process.
Study and Participant Characteristics
Seven of the included studies30,31,34,35,37,38 recruited partici-
pants through the community. The included RCTs examined
iCBT,withinterventionscomprising5to11onlinesessions.Four
of the included trials provided support related to the techni-
cal aspects of the online platforms,15,31,33,36 whereas 9 trials
were purely self-guided.12-14,30,32,34,35,37,38 The control condi-
tions used were attention placebo, no treatment, treatment as
usual, or waiting list. The included studies were conducted in
6 countries: Australia, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, the Neth-
erlands, and the United Kingdom (eTable 1 in the Supplement
presents a summary of study characteristics).
Of the 3876 study participants, the mean (SD) age was 42.0
(11.7) years, 2531 (66.0%) of 3832 were female, 1368 (53.1%) of
2574completedsecondaryeducation,and2262(71.9%)of3146
were employed. The mean baseline depressive symptoms
scores were 25.7 on the Center of Epidemiologic Studies–
Depression Scale, 28.3 on the Beck Depression Inventory, and
14.1 on the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire in their re-
spective studies. Finally, 71 (1.8%) of 3876 randomized par-
ticipants did not start the treatment or did not provide base-
lineandposttreatmentdata,and1048(27.0%)of3876dropped
out of the RCT and did not provide posttreatment depressive
symptomsscores.(eTable2inthe Supplementprovidesasum-
mary of participants’characteristics.)

Risk of Bias Assessment
All included studies scored low on all examined items of the
Cochrane risk of bias tool. Random allocation sequences were
adequately generated, and the allocation was sufficiently con-
cealed in all included RCTs. Participants were not masked be-
cause this is difficult to achieve in psychotherapy research. All
studies used self-report outcome measures. Missing data were
imputed as part of the present IPD to minimize study attri-
tion bias. Finally, studies were assessed as being free of out-
come reporting bias and other sources of bias (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Results of Traditional Meta-analysis
Sixteen studies examined the comparison between self-
guided iCBT and control groups. The results of the traditional
meta-analysisrevealedthatself-guidediCBToutperformedthe
control conditions at posttreatment assessment (g = 0.33; 95%
CI, 0.19-0.46; P < .001). Heterogeneity was moderate to high
and significant (I2 = 71%; 95% CI, 51%-82%; P < .001). There
was no significant difference between the outcome findings
of studies included in the present IPD meta-analysis and stud-
ies with unavailable data (P = .95) (Figure 2). There was some
indication of publication bias. With the use of the Duval and
Tweedie trim and fill method, values for 5 studies were
imputed and the point estimate reduced to g = 0.21 (95% CI,
0.07-0.34), and the Egger test result was significant (P < .001)
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
One-Stage IPD Meta-analysis:
Depressive Symptoms Severity
Table 1 presents the main findings of the 1-stage IPD meta-
analysis on depressive symptoms severity after testing (rang-
ing from 6 to 16 weeks after randomization). There was a sig-
nificant effect of self-guided iCBT over control conditions on
depressive symptoms (β = −0.21; P < .001). Complete cases
yieldedsimilaroutcomes(β = −0.19;P < .001).Noneofthepar-
ticipant-level variables (sociodemographic and clinical char-
acteristics) significantly moderated outcome after treatment
(Table 1). However, adherence to treatment predicted signifi-
cantly better outcomes within the self-guided iCBT group
(β = −0.19; P = .001).
Two-Stage IPD Meta-analysis:
Depressive Symptoms Severity
The 2-stage IPD meta-analysis resulted in a pooled effect size
of g = 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.37; P < .001) in favor of self-

0.17-0.46; P < .001). None of the examined study-level vari-
ables (type of comparator condition, recruitment, level of sup-
port, and treatment duration) were significantly associated
with treatment outcome (eTable 4, eFigure 2, and eFigure 3
in the Supplement).
One-Stage IPD Meta-analysis: Treatment Response
A significant effect in favor of self-guided iCBT over controls
wasfoundfortreatmentresponse(β = 0.53; P < .001)(Table2).
Complete cases analyses resulted in similar outcomes
(β = 0.50; P < .001). None of the sociodemographic and clini-
cal characteristics of participants were significantly associated
with treatment response (Table 2). Treatment adherence sig-
nificantly predicted treatment response (β = 0.90; P < .001).
Two-Stage IPD Meta-analysis: Treatment Response
The OR was 1.95 (95% CI, 1.52-2.50; P < .001) in favor of the
self-guided iCBT group, which corresponds to a NNT of 8 (95%
CI, 6-12) (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Similar outcomes were
found when we conducted complete case analysis (OR, 1.88;
95% CI, 1.34-2.64; P < .001; NNT, 9; 95% CI, 6-17). None of the
examined study-level variables was significantly associated
with treatment response (eTable 5, eFigure 4, and eFigure 5
in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this study, we examined the effects of self-guided iCBT on
severity and treatment response. We aimed to identify mod-
erators of treatment outcome. We found that self-guided iCBT
had lower depressive symptom severity and greater treat-
ment response compared with control conditions after test-
ing. These findings were robust in complete case analyses.
Treatment adherence was significantly related to treatment
outcomes within the self-guided iCBT group. None of the ex-
amined participant- and study-level variables significantly
moderated the treatment effect.
The finding that self-guided iCBT results in a significant
effect on depression outcomes is consistent with previous
literature.42 However, the present IPD meta-analysis pro-
vides stronger evidence and improves the precision of the es-
timates because of the novel methodologic approach used.
Moreover, previous literature42 did not examine NNTs. The
current findings indicate that we need to treat 8 individuals
with depressive symptoms with self-guided iCBT to expect
a 50% symptom reduction. Although this NNT is relatively
large and its clinical relevance could be doubted, it can still
have a considerable effect when large groups of patients use
the treatment, especially considering the low costs of self-
guided iCBT.

The role of treatment adherence in outcomes has been
identified by a previous review in the field conducted by
Donkinandcolleagues.43Theauthorsconcludedthatthenum-
ber of sessions correlated with outcomes in the interventions
that targeted at depressive symptoms.43 In other words, par-
ticipants did better when they adhered to the intervention.
However, treatment adherence follows the course of the in-
tervention and may be influenced by response to treatment as
much as vice versa. As previous research findings44 have sug-
gested, there may be different preexisting factors (eg, age and
sex) that influence the association between treatment adher-
ence and treatment outcomes.
It is also interesting that baseline depressive symptoms
scoresdidnotmoderatetreatmentoutcomes.Thisfindingcon-
trasts with the findings of the IPD meta-analysis of low-
intensity interventions by Bower et al,16 who found that higher
levelsofdepressivesymptomsatbaselinewereassociatedwith
better depressive outcomes (greater decrease in depressive
symptoms) after the completion of low-intensity interven-
tions. However, this effect was relatively small. The authors
concluded that it might not be clinically relevant and that it is
safer to assume that low-intensity interventions work equally
across a range of severities.
Strengths and Limitations
Among the strengths of the present study was its high power
to detect small statistically significant differences between in-
tervention and controls and to yield more precise and robust
evidence compared with traditional meta-analyses. More-
over, the included RCTs had high methodologic quality, which
allows us to be confident that the present analysis is rela-
tively free of critical biases. However, many internet-
delivered interventions incorporate repeated use of symp-
tom inventories with each online session. This repeated
administrationofsymptominventoriesmightyieldlowermean
scores with each wave of measurement (completer biases re-
lated to self-report ratings).45 Moreover, the included studies
didnotreportonrecruitmentissuesrelatedtolarge-scale,fully
unguided internet-administered interventions, including fac-
tors such as repeated registration attempts by individuals who
did not meet inclusion criteria or who were dissatisfied with
their intervention allocation. These matters constitute a po-
tential threat to validity and should be addressed by future
research in this field.
SeverallimitationsofourIPDmeta-analysisshouldbemen-
tioned. We observed moderate to high heterogeneity. Unfor-
tunately, the subgroup analyses did not provide any indica-
tion of which study-level variables are associated with the
observed heterogeneity. Moreover, our findings are at risk (al-
beit low) of availability bias because we could not access data
from 3 eligible studies of the 16. However, the results of the
traditional meta-analysis indicated that the findings of these
3 unavailable trials did not differ from the findings of the in-
cluded RCTs. Another limitation is that we could not exam-
ine duration of symptoms as a potential moderator of treat-
ment outcome. Duration of symptoms is important because
individuals with chronic depressive symptoms may not al-
ways respond rapidly to treatment. Furthermore, most of the
includedtrialsrecruitedtheirself-referredparticipantsthrough
the community, thereby limiting our ability to generalize the

present results to clinical samples. Finally, there was some in-
dication of publication bias, suggesting that unpublished trials
with negative findings might be missing from the present
sample of studies.
Conclusions
Self-guided iCBT produces results that are encouraging. The
absence of a significant difference in treatment outcomes as-
sociatedwithclinicalandsociodemographiccharacteristicsim-
pliesthatself-guidediCBTcanbeusedbymostindividualswith
depressive symptoms regardless of the severity of their symp-
toms or their sociodemographic background. Currently, anti-
depressant medications are widely used in the treatment of
depressive symptoms, whereas psychotherapeutic interven-
tions are provided to a lesser degree, despite many individu-
als with depressive symptoms preferring psychotherapy to
antidepressants.46 However, the high treatment costs and the
limited number of trained clinicians hamper the implemen-
tation of psychotherapy in practice.
The findings of the present IPD meta-analysis suggest that
self-guided iCBT may be a viable alternative to current first-
step treatment approaches for symptoms of depression, par-
ticularly in those individuals who are not willing to have any
therapeuticcontact.Thisformofinterventionseemstobevalu-
able for patients with primary depressive problems and those
with depressive symptoms in the context of a primary so-
matic problem.47,48 This self-help form of CBT can provide
treatment access at low cost to large numbers of individuals
worldwide who have depressive symptoms. Although it is be-
yond the scope of this study, unguided iCBT has several limi-
tations that should be addressed before it is disseminated as
part of routine care (eg, high dropout rates, small effects com-
pared with face-to-face and guided internet interventions, and
possible participant selection bias).
Given the effects found for treatment adherence, future
research should focus on improving retention of partici-
pants in self-guided iCBT programs with the aim of maxi-
mizing positive therapeutic outcomes. Further research is
also needed to examine additional moderators (eg, sleep
quality, cognitive performance, duration of symptoms),
long-term outcomes, and the value of adding therapist or
coach support to these treatments. Finally, future studies
should focus on the pragmatic effectiveness of iCBT in rou-
tine care settings.
