BACKGROUND: In August 2012, the Food and Drug Administration investigated the safety of 
codeine use by children after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, culminating in a black 
box warning in February 2013. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association 
between the investigation and opioid prescribing to children undergoing these surgeries.
METHODS: We identified 362 992 privately insured children in the 2010–2015 Truven 
MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database who underwent tonsillectomy 
and/or adenoidectomy. Using an interrupted time series design, we estimated level and 
slope changes in the proportion of children with ≥1 prescription fills for codeine and ≥1 fills 
for an alternative opioid, such as hydrocodone, within 7 days of surgery.
RESULTS: The investigation was associated with a significant −13.3 (95% confidence interval: 
−14.5 to −12.1) percentage point level change in the proportion of children with ≥1 
prescription fills for codeine after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Despite this drop, 
5.1% of children had ≥1 prescription fills for codeine in December 2015. The investigation 
was not associated with significant level changes in alternative opioid prescribing, although 
the proportion of children receiving alternative opioids increased during the study period 
because of other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The Food and Drug Administration investigation substantially decreased 
codeine prescribing to children after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. However, 1 in 
20 children undergoing these surgeries were still prescribed codeine in December 2015 
despite its well-documented safety and efficacy issues.

 Historically, codeine has been 1 
of the most commonly prescribed 
analgesics to children after 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy 
in part because of its perceived 
favorable safety profile compared 
with higher-potency alternative 
opioids, such as oxycodone and 
hydrocodone.1 However, between 
1969 and 2012, the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) received 
13 reports of children who died 
or overdosed after taking codeine, 
including 8 who had recently 
undergone these surgeries.2 Many of 
these adverse events were associated 
with genetic polymorphisms 
resulting in high function of the 
enzyme that metabolizes codeine to 
morphine, leading to dangerously 
elevated blood morphine levels.2 
–4 On 
August 1, 2012, the FDA responded 
to these reports by announcing 
an investigation into the safety 
of codeine use by children after 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. 
On February 20, 2013, this 
investigation culminated in a black 
box warning.2 Notably, the warning 
recommended against codeine use 
in all children undergoing these 
surgeries and not just children with 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which 
is a risk factor for opioid-induced 
respiratory depression.5
To date, the association between 
this investigation and changes in 
codeine prescribing to children 
after tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy is unknown. Previous 
FDA safety investigations have 
been associated with sizable but 
incomplete changes in provider 
practice.6, 
 
7 For example, the FDA 
issued several warnings between 
2003 and 2004 on the increased 
risk of suicidal ideation among 
children taking antidepressants. 
These warnings were associated 
with a 20% to 30% reduction in 
antidepressant prescribing to 
children but no significant changes 
in recommended patient monitoring 
after antidepressant initiation.6, 
 
7 As 
another example, the FDA issued 
a warning in January 2008 against 
the use of cough and cold medicines 
in children <2 years of age. This 
warning, along with concomitant 
labeling and marketing changes 
by the pharmaceutical industry, 
decreased but did not eliminate 
prescriptions for cough and cold 
medicines in this age group.8
Similarly, the association between 
the FDA investigation and prescribing 
of alternative noncodeine opioids  
to children after tonsillectomy and/or  
adenoidectomy is unknown.  
In theory, providers could have 
responded to the investigation by 
relying on nonopioid agents, such as 
ibuprofen, 
9 resulting in decreased 
overall opioid prescribing to 
children after tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy. However, they could 
also have responded by substituting 
codeine with higher-potency opioids, 
such as hydrocodone. Documenting 
any substitutions is crucial because 
some noncodeine opioids may 
also be unsafe for children after 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. 
For example, in April 2017, the FDA 
announced a contraindication against 
the use of tramadol by children 
after these surgeries, citing similar 
concerns about genetic variability in 
tramadol metabolism.10
In this study, we used a quasi-
experimental approach and 2010–
2015 commercial claims data to 
examine the association between 
the FDA safety investigation and 
opioid prescribing to children after 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. 
We conducted a subgroup analysis 
to examine whether this association 
varied among children with and 
without OSA.
MethODs
Data source
We analyzed data from the 
2010–2015 Truven MarketScan 
Commercial Claims and Encounters 
database, which is a convenience 
sample of claims from individuals 
aged 0 to 64 years with employer-
sponsored insurance. MarketScan 
enrollees receive insurance from 1 
of >100 employers across the United 
States.11 Annual sample sizes in the 
2010–2014 MarketScan database 
range from 45.2 million to 53.1 
million. In 2015, the sample size 
decreased to 28.3 million because 
of changes in data contributors; 
however, results were similar when 
we excluded data from this year 
(Supplemental Table 4).
study Population
Among 72 million children aged 
0 to 18 years in the 2010–2015 
MarketScan database, we initially 
included 469 647 who underwent 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. 
To identify these surgeries, we 
searched the MarketScan inpatient, 
outpatient, and facility files for 
procedure codes corresponding to 
tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or 
both (Current Procedural Terminology 
codes 42820, 42821, 42825, 
42826, 42830, 42831, 42835, and 
42836; International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision and 
International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision procedure 
codes 28.2, 28.3, 28.6, 0CTP0ZZ, 
0CTPXZZ, 0CTQXZZ, and 0CTQ0ZZ). 
We defined the index date as the first 
instance of 1 of these codes.
We made 2 sample exclusions. First, 
we excluded 95 901 children whose 
prescription drug claims data were 
not included in MarketScan (ie, the 
employer only contributed medical 
but not pharmacy claims). Second, 
because we searched for opioid 
prescription fills within 7 days of 
surgery as described below, we 
eliminated 10 754 children whose 
health care utilization could not be 
observed for this time period (eg, 
children undergoing surgery on 
the last 7 days of 2010–2015). In 
a sensitivity analysis, results were 
similar when including these children

 (Supplemental Table 5). Our final 
sample included 362 992 children.
study Measures
We created 2 dichotomous 
dependent variables: the occurrence 
of ≥1 prescription fills for codeine 
after tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy, and the occurrence 
of ≥1 prescription fills for an opioid 
other than codeine (alternative 
opioids). We included prescription 
fills that occurred on the index date 
and within 7 days. This interval is 
consistent with previous research on 
opioid use12 and reflects the period 
in which many patients experience 
the most intense pain after 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. 
Estimates changed minimally when 
we searched for prescription fills 
occurring within 3 or 14 days of the 
index date instead of 7 (Supplemental 
Table 6).
To identify opioid prescription 
fills, we searched the MarketScan 
prescription drug files for specific 
opioid national drug codes (NDCs) by 
using a slightly modified version of 
the list of opioid NDCs compiled by 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.13 We excluded cough and 
cold preparations containing opioids, 
both because these were unlikely 
to be prescribed after tonsillectomy 
and/or tonsillectomy and because the 
FDA announced an investigation into 
the safety of codeine cough and cold 
preparations for children during the 
study period (July 2015).14 Based on 
a substring search of the medication 
name, we classified opioids as 
codeine products and alternative 
opioid products (oxycodone, 
hydrocodone, butorphanol, 
fentanyl, hydromorphone, 
levorphanol, meperidine, morphine, 
oxymorphone, pentazocine, 
propoxyphene, tapentadol, and 
tramadol). The list of NDCs used in 
our search was identical across data 
years.
study Design
To quantify the impact of the FDA 
investigation on opioid prescribing, 
we used an interrupted time 
series design, which is a strong, 
quasi-experimental approach that 
is frequently used to estimate 
the effects of interventions on 
prescription drug fills.15 Following 
previous research on FDA safety 
investigations, we did not include a 
control group because the national 
nature of the investigations may have 
caused spillover effects on codeine 
prescribing in other populations (eg, 
adults undergoing tonsillectomy 
and/or adenoidectomy) and in 
other clinical scenarios (eg, children 
undergoing other types of outpatient 
surgery).6
We assigned children to 1 of 72 
months on the basis of their index 
dates and defined the investigation as 
the 7-month period between August 
2012 and February 2013. Thus, the 
preinvestigation period included 
the 31 months between January 
2010 and July 2012, whereas the 
postinvestigation period included 
the 34 months between March 2013 
and December 2015; data from 
the 7-month investigation period 
were excluded in the analyses. We 
chose not to model the effects of the 
announcement and the black box 
warning separately because the net 
effect of the entire investigation may 
be of more policy relevance than 
the effect of individual components. 
We provide results from an analysis 
that models the effects separately in 
Supplemental Table 7.
statistical analysis
We fit linear segmented regression 
models predicting the 2 dependent 
variables as a function of month, 
an indicator of postinvestigation 
period status (post), and the number 
of months after the investigation 
ended (monthsafter). The coefficient 
for month represented the absolute 
percentage point change per month 
in prescribing outcomes over the 
study period, the coefficient for post 
represented the level change in the 
fitted line between the beginning 
and end of the investigation, and 
the coefficient for monthsafter 
represented the slope change in the 
fitted line after the investigation 
ended.15, 
 
16 We used the SAS 
AUTOREG procedure to account for 
first-order autocorrelation.
We also conducted a descriptive 
analysis to examine changes in 
the types of opioids prescribed to 
children after tonsillectomy and/or  
adenoidectomy. Among all  
opioid prescription fills occurring 
within 7 days of these surgeries, we 
calculated the monthly proportion 
that fell into the following 4 
categories: (1) products containing 
codeine, (2–3) products containing 
the 2 most commonly prescribed 
alternative opioids (hydrocodone 
and oxycodone), and (4) products 
containing other opioids.
In a subgroup analysis, we analyzed 
whether associations varied among 
children with and without OSA. 
Following previous research, we 
defined OSA as the presence of 
any of the following International 
Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision or International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision diagnosis codes on a claim 
occurring on the index date: 327.23, 
OSA; 780.57, unspecified sleep apnea; 
780.51, insomnia with sleep apnea 
(unspecified); 780.53, hypersomnia 
with sleep apnea (unspecified); 
G47.33, OSA; and G47.30, unspecified 
sleep apnea.17 
– 
19 In a sensitivity 
analysis, results were similar when 
we defined OSA as the presence of 
these codes on a claim occurring on 
the index date or in the previous 90 
days (Supplemental Table 8).
To evaluate the possibility of 
selection bias from abrupt changes in 
the case mix during the investigation, 
we determined whether our 
estimates changed substantially 
when controlling for demographic 
characteristics in regressions (mean

To evaluate whether our estimates 
could be biased by other events 
occurring at the same time as the 
investigation, we searched for opioid 
shortages by using the drug shortage 
lists maintained by the FDA and the 
American Society of Health-System 
Pharmacists.20,

Results
sample characteristics
Among the 362 992 children in our 
sample, 48.7% were girls, 49.9% 
were aged 0 to 5 years, 35.4% 
were aged 6 to 12 years, and 14.7% 
were aged 13 to 18 years (Table 
1). Overall, 13.3% were from the 
Northeast census region compared 
with 26.6% from the Midwest, 43.8% 
from the South, and 14.5% from 
the West. Children in the sample 
lived in all 50 states and the District 
of Columbia. According to our 
definition, 60 535 children (16.7% 
of the sample) had OSA, whereas 
302 457 (83.3%) did not.
Main Results
 
Figure 1 displays trends in the 2 
dependent variables during the 
study period. In January 2010, 31.0% 
of children had ≥1 prescription 
fills for codeine within 7 days of 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. 
This percentage declined −0.3 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: −0.3 to 
−0.2) percentage points per month 
between January 2010 and July 2012, 
which was the month before the 
investigation started (Table 2). The 
investigation was associated with a 
significant −13.3 (95% CI: −14.5 to 
−12.1) percentage point level change 
and a significant 0.1 (95% CI: 0.1 to 
0.2) percentage point slope change in 
codeine prescription fills, indicating 
that the monthly rate of change in the 
postinvestigation period was slower 
but still negative. In December 2015, 
5.1% of children had ≥1 prescription 
fills for codeine within 7 days of 
surgery.
Similarly, in January 2010, 31.7% of 
children had ≥1 prescription fills for 
an alternative opioid within 7 days of 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. 
This percentage increased 0.2 (95% 
CI: 0.1 to 0.3) percentage points per 
month between January 2010 and 
July 2012 (Table 2). The investigation 
was associated with a nonsignificant 
−1.2 (95% CI: −3.5 to 1.0) 
percentage point level change and 
a significant −0.2 (95% CI: −0.3 to 
−0.1) percentage point slope change 
in alternative opioid prescription 
fills, indicating that the monthly rate 
of change in the postinvestigation 
period was close to 0. In December 
2015, 46.1% of children had ≥1 
prescription fills for an alternative 
opioid within 7 days of surgery.
During the overall study period, an 
average of 1.1% of the children had 
prescription fills for both codeine and 
an alternative opioid within 7 days of 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. 
In January 2010, 38.8% of children 
had no prescription fills for any 
opioid within 7 days of surgery 
compared with 50.4% of children in 
December 2015.

trends in the proportion of these fills 
in which the active ingredient was

or another opioid. In January 2010, 
codeine products constituted 46.8%

a The number of children undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy fluctuates from year to year largely because of differences in the number of children in each year of the

 2015, codeine products constituted 
9.1% of fills compared with 72.7% 
for hydrocodone products, 17.4% 
for oxycodone products, and 0.8% 
for other opioid products. Thus, 
providers who chose to prescribe 
opioids to children increasingly 
relied on high-potency agents, such 
as hydrocodone and oxycodone, over 
time.
subgroup analysis
In the subgroup analysis, 38.0% 
of children with OSA and 30.0% 
of children without OSA had ≥1 
prescription fills for codeine within 
7 days of tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy in January 2010, 
compared with 3.0% and 5.6% in 
December 2015, respectively. The 
investigation was associated with 
a −16.2 (95% CI: −18.2 to −14.3) 
percentage point level change in the 
proportion of children with OSA who 
had ≥1 prescription fills for codeine 
after surgery, compared with a −12.6 
(95% CI: −13.9 to −11.4) percentage 
point level change among children 
without OSA (Table 3). As indicated 
by the nonoverlapping confidence 
intervals, the magnitude of these 
level changes was significantly 
different between subgroups. Similar 
to the main analysis, the investigation 
was not associated with significant 
level changes in alternative opioid 
prescription fills in either subgroup.
Conclusions were unchanged 
when additionally controlling for 
demographic characteristics in 
regressions (Supplemental Table 9). 
We did not find evidence that any 
opioid drug shortages occurred at 
the same time as the investigation. 
Among 484 opioid-related news 
articles in LexisNexis Academic 
that were published while the 
investigation was underway, many 
reported on the toll of the opioid 
epidemic generally, whereas a 
handful reported on the January 24, 
2013, FDA hearing on tightening 
restrictions for hydrocodone 
prescribing.22 None reported the 
occurrence of events other than 
the investigation that specifically 
pertained to opioid prescribing to 
children after tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy.
DIscussIOn
The 2012–2013 FDA investigation  
into the safety of codeine use by 
children after tonsillectomy and/or  
adenoidectomy was associated  
with a significant 13.3 percentage  
point drop in codeine prescribing  
to these children. Despite this, 5.1%  
of all children and 3.0% of children  
with OSA were still prescribed  
codeine after tonsillectomy and/or  
adenoidectomy in December 
2015. The existence of residual 
inappropriate codeine prescribing 
is concerning not just because 
of codeine’s safety risks but also 
because many patients receive poor 
analgesia from codeine because 
of low function of the enzyme that 
metabolizes codeine to morphine.9 
Thus, the decision to prescribe  
codeine may increase the risk  
of either respiratory depression

Our finding of residual inappropriate 
codeine prescribing is consistent with 
previous policy literature suggesting 
that FDA safety investigations can 
alter provider behavior but only 
to a certain degree.6, 
 
23 It is likely 
that the reductions in codeine 
prescribing occurred among 
providers who are amenable to 
change. Therefore, further reductions 
may be difficult without concerted 
quality-improvement efforts aimed 
at overcoming potential barriers 
among providers who are resistant 
to change, including clinical inertia, 
a lack of agreement, or a lack of 
experience with alternative options.24
The FDA investigation was not 
associated with significant level 
changes in the proportion of children 
with prescription fills for alternative 
opioids after tonsillectomy and/or  
adenoidectomy. However, the 
unadjusted proportion of children 
receiving alternative opioids rose 
substantially during the study 
period, presumably because of 
factors other than the investigation 
itself. This increase deserves further 
examination given the abuse liability 
associated with higher-potency 
opioids25 as well as the growing 
evidence of genetic variability in 
the metabolism of many alternative 
opioids, including oxycodone and 
tramadol.9, 
 
10
Our study has a number of strengths, 
including its large sample size and 
use of a strong quasi-experimental 
design. We found little evidence 
that results were biased by changes 
in the case mix at the time of the 
intervention. Furthermore, we 
negated the possibility of bias 
from changes in our measurement 
instrument by using an identical 
strategy to identify opioid 
prescription fills across the study 
period.
Our study also has limitations. First, 
because we relied on a convenience 
sample of commercial claims, the

2010–2015). Month 1 corresponds to January 2010, and month 72 corresponds to December 2015. 
The investigation period (shaded in gray) is defined by month 32 (the FDA announcement of the safety 
investigation in August 2012) and month 38 (the FDA black box warning in February 2013). The y-axis 
represents the percentage of opioid prescription fills after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy 
that were comprised of products containing hydrocodone, codeine, oxycodone, or other opioids. 
Triangles represent hydrocodone, squares represent codeine, diamonds represent oxycodone, and 
empty circles represent other opioids.

 generalizability of the results to other 
commercially insured children and to 
publicly insured children is unclear. 
Second, we assessed prescription 
fills for opioids, which may be lower 
than the number of actual opioid 
prescriptions (eg, if parents choose 
not to fill an opioid prescription). 
Third, although adjusting for 
available demographic information 
did not substantially change results, 
we cannot exclude the possibility 
that our results might be biased 
by abrupt changes in unmeasured 
demographic factors during the 
investigation. Fourth, because of data 
limitations, we could not ascertain 
the characteristics of providers who 
were still prescribing codeine to  
children after tonsillectomy and/or  
adenoidectomy in 2015. Fifth, we 
could not assess the use of over-the-
counter agents such as ibuprofen 
because we relied on claims data.
Finally, there was not a plausible 
control group because of the national 
nature of the investigation and the 
resulting potential for spillover 
effects. Therefore, we cannot 
completely rule out the possibility 
that our results could be biased by 
the occurrence of other events that 
affected opioid prescribing. However, 
our review of drug shortages and 
opioid-related news articles did not 
support this possibility. Although 
several recent events have focused 
on codeine prescribing to children, 
including the September 2016 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommendation that providers 
stop prescribing codeine to children 
for any indication, 
26 the timing of 
these events was too late to bias our 
findings.
cOnclusIOns
The FDA safety investigation was 
associated with large reductions in 
codeine prescribing to children after 
tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. 
However, ∼1 in 20 children were 
still prescribed codeine in December 
2015 despite its well-documented 
safety and efficacy issues. Future 
quality-improvement efforts should 
focus on eliminating this residual 
inappropriate codeine prescribing 
and on encouraging the use of 
effective nonopioid medications such 
as ibuprofen.9
