Objective To understand challenges in care after stillbirth and
provide tailored solutions.
Design Multi-centre case study.
Setting Three maternity hospitals.
Population Parents with a stillborn baby, maternity staff.
Methods Thematic analysis of parent interviews and staff focus
groups and service provision investigation.
Outcomes 1 Themes; 2 Triangulation matrix; 3
Recommendations.
Results Twenty-one women, 14 partners, and 22 staff
participated.
Service Provision: Care for parents after stillbirth varies excessively;
there are misconceptions; post-mortem does not delay follow-up.
Presentation: Women ‘do not feel right’ before stillbirth; their
management is haphazard and should be standardised.
Diagnosis: Stillbirth is an emergency for parents but not always for
staff; communication can seem cold; well-designed bereavement
space is critical.
Birth: Staff shift priorities to mother and future, but for parents
their baby is still a baby; parents are not comfortable with staff
recommending vaginal birth as the norm; there are several reasons
why parents ask for a caesarean; better care involves clear communi-
cation, normal behaviour, and discussion of coping strategies.
Post-mortem: Parents are influenced by discussions with staff. Staff
should ‘sow seeds’, clarify its respectful nature, delineate its
purpose, and explain the timescale.
Follow-up: It is not standardised; parents wish to see their multi-
professional team.
Conclusions There is unacceptable variation in care after stillbirth,
and insensitive interactions between staff and bereaved parents.
Understanding parents’ needs, including why they ask for
caesarean birth, will facilitate joint decision-making. Every
bereaved parent is entitled to good, respectful care.
Keywords Bereavement, communication, mode of birth, post-
mortem, stillbirth, training.

Mixed-methods – Care & outcome after stillbirth
 Plain Language Summary
Why and how was the study carried out?
Previous studies have shown that improving care after stillbirth is important for families. We investigated the opinions of bereaved
parents and maternity staff to find ways to improve care.
At three hospitals in 2013, all women who experienced a stillbirth were invited to an interview along with their partners. Thirty-five
parents of 21 babies agreed to participate. Twenty-two obstetricians and midwives took part in focus group discussions.
What were the main findings?
• Care was often not as good as it should and could be. Communication with parents was not always as sensitive as they would have
liked because staff did not have appropriate training.
• Some women reported they did not ‘feel right’ before going to hospital. Once they arrived, there was no standard approach to how
care was given. Sometimes there were long delays before the death of the baby was confirmed and action was taken.
• After it had been confirmed that the baby had died, staff focussed on the mothers’ needs, but the parents’ priorities were still with
their baby. There were several reasons why parents asked for a caesarean birth that staff had not considered.
• Staff influenced parents’ decisions about post-mortem examinations. Parents found it helpful when staff explained the respectful
nature and purpose of the examination.
• After discharge from hospital, there was no consistent plan for how follow-up care would be given. Parents would have liked more
information about their next hospital appointment.
What are the limitations of the work?
The parents interviewed depended on their memories of the details of the care, which happened some time ago. In staff group
discussions, junior doctors may not have spoken openly because there were senior doctors present. Further research is necessary to
understand and improve care globally.
What is the implication for parents?
Every bereaved parent is entitled to the best possible care after stillbirth, but some do not get good care. Parents and staff made
suggestions that can help to develop processes for how care is given after stillbirth. These suggestions can also inform staff training, so
that every single parent is treated respectfully and participates in decision making.

Introduction
In the UK, about 4000 babies per year are stillborn.1 Glob-
ally, the figure is about two and a half million, yet stillbirth
did not feature until recently on the global agenda.2 Break-
ing the silence on stillbirth is one of ‘parents’ most heartfelt
wishes’3 and has at last become a global priority.2 System-
atic reviews of more than 200 studies show that the socioe-
conomic impact of stillbirth on society is immense, ranging
from stigma to disenfranchised grief; broken relationships
to long term impact on the wider family; unresolved grief
to clinical depression; chronic pain to substance use;
increased use of health services to employment difficulties;
and from staff despair to resignation.4 There is a lack of
comprehensive programmes to support and guide staff.
The few interventions that exist have had little or no
impact, perhaps because they have not been mapped to the
actual problems in bereavement care.4
Many problems stem from inadequate staff preparation.
A survey of over 2000 UK staff found that one-third did
not have satisfactory training to counsel parents after
stillbirth,5 and an international guideline identified an
urgent need for research to improve care and experience.6
A survey of 473 parents showed that fewer than half of the
parents felt involved in the decision-making process after
stillbirth.7 A confidential enquiry of 133 term stillbirths
showed wide variation in care, including inadequate com-
munication between health professionals and parents.8
Interactions between parents and staff have been described
as clumsy and insensitive,8,9 with partners ignored and little
attention to women’s needs,9 leading to a lasting negative
impact on bereaved parents’ memories.10
The need to improve care after stillbirth is urgent and
has been reiterated in the NHS Maternity Review10 and
two briefing notes for the UK parliament.11,12 What has
not been known is how to effect improvements. The spar-
sity of empirical evidence and lack of awareness thereof has
meant that teams draw on practice experience, which inevi-
tably involves assumptions and misconceptions that might
harm parents and their relationship with the health system.
The aim of the INSIGHT study was to conduct an in-depth
investigation of bereaved parents’ perspectives and the

 main challenges for staff that care for them, and identify
how to improve care with specific examples of good and
bad practice.
Methods
Three hospitals in the South West of England participated
in the INSIGHT Study. All women and their partners/
companions were invited to participate in a semi-struc-
tured interview if they had experienced a late intrauterine
fetal death (gestational age of more than 23 weeks and
6 days) between January and November 2013. All obstet-
ric consultants, obstetric trainees (level of training ST4
and above) and senior midwives (>5 years’ experience,
including caring for parents after stillbirth) working dur-
ing the study in the three maternity units (Bristol South-
mead Hospital, Gloucester Royal Hospital, and Taunton
Musgrove Park Hospital), were invited to participate in
focus groups. Service provision (audit, case notes, and
governance) data were collected in each unit to provide
context.
The study methodology, including the schedules for the
semi-structured interviews and focus groups, were designed
by a team comprising the clinical researchers (DS, CC,
CW, AE, and TD), a bereaved parent co-investigator (CS),
and two experienced qualitative researchers (SJ and KG),
with input from a lay Public/Patient Involvement (PPI)
panel and a multi-professional Project Advisory Board
(PAB) with representation from Sands, the stillbirth and
neonatal death charity. The topics for discussion were
agreed in advance with the bereaved parent co-investigator,
based on her experience supporting other bereaved families
through Bristol Sands. The topics were grouped under four
main areas — diagnosis and breaking bad news, mode of
birth, post-mortem discussions, and follow-up period and
consultation — based on the gaps previously identified by
the authors during development of an international still-
birth guideline6 and the experience of the clinicians and
the
bereaved
parent
co-investigator.
The
qualitative
researchers made suggestions about the ordering, wording
and tone of the questions to facilitate engagement by the
participants.
Τo recruit for the parent interviews, the PPI panel
and the bereaved parent co-investigator recommended that
the midwife who cared for the mother initially approached
the bereaved parents on the day they were discharged
from the hospital and were due to return to the commu-
nity after the stillbirth. Women and their partners were
given a brief information leaflet and were asked to indicate
whether they agreed to receive further information using
their preferred communication method (email or post).
Those who agreed were sent a Research Pack six weeks
after the initial discharge from hospital. The research team
contacted the parents by telephone approximately one week
later. If they wished to participate, with or without their
partners, the researcher recorded their consent. The final
part of the call was to inform the parents that they would
be contacted by the qualified (PhD) and experienced (fe-
male)13 psychologist (KG) to set a convenient date, time
and location
for
the
interview after
their
follow up
appointment with a hospital consultant.
The interviews with parents were conducted at a place
chosen by them, either at home or in a private room at the
hospital away from the maternity unit. Each interview
started with a familiarisation period. KG followed the inter-
view schedule (Appendix 1a), using clarification questions
and prompts as necessary. The interviews lasted one to two
hours and were audio-recorded.
For the focus groups, all staff were initially emailed gen-
eral study information. A second email was sent to all eligi-
ble staff inviting them to participate. Once at least two
healthcare
professionals
from
each
professional
group
within each hospital had volunteered to participate, the
dates and times for the focus groups were arranged. If fur-
ther healthcare professionals volunteered to participate,
they were encouraged to attend, up to a maximum of 10
participants per focus group.
The focus groups were conducted in private rooms
within each hospital by an experienced chartered psycholo-
gist (SJ), and facilitated by a research midwife and another
experienced qualitative researcher. Τhe focus groups lasted
one to two hours, and followed a specified schedule
(Appendix 1b). They were also audio-recorded.
All audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and
checked for accuracy with the aid of the field notes. For
thematic analysis, a six-stage process was followed:14 famil-
iarisation with the data; generation of initial codes; search-
ing for themes; reviewing themes; defining themes; and
naming themes. The two qualitative researchers (SJ+KG)
conducted the analyses, with supervision and consultation
from the wider team. Psychosocial issues and influences on
participants’ experience within each case were identified
before considering common themes that transcended cases,
with additional consideration to identify and describe
diverse cases and the full range of experience.
Issues arising from the interviews and focus groups were
examined and explored alongside a range of service provi-
sion data to determine their factual status. After the inter-
views and focus groups had been transcribed and checked,
SJ and KG identified the required data. The list was exten-
sive and covered a wide range of supplementary data from
hospital floor plans with equipment identified and staffing
rotas, to clinical notes and blank copies of relevant docu-
ments (e.g. post-mortem consent forms). The clinical
research fellow and the research midwives contacted local
leads within each hospital and audited the clinical notes of

 all the stillbirth cases to establish timelines for each parent’s
journey.
We did not know a priori what the defining element
would turn out to be. Possible examples for defining case
studies had included: 1. Following diagnosis, women are
offered one of three possible mode of birth choices, with
those receiving their choice possibly having a very different
experience from those who did not; 2. Geographic factors -
women in more urban areas might have been better served
than women in more rural locations; 3. Maternity unit fac-
tors - management, and therefore women’s experiences of
care, might vary significantly between units. However, no
women in this study were offered a choice of mode of
birth, with geography seemingly not a significant factor: the
data from the three different maternity units did not differ
in any significant ways. The factor that determined the
structure (caseness) seemed to be the point at which
the baby died. In this report, we focus on the data from
the three maternity units relating to the experiences of fetal
death diagnosed before labour.
To triangulate the findings from the data sets (parent
interviews and staff focus groups) at the interpretation
stage,15 the investigators examined them and developed a
triangulation matrix. The two data sets were described as
showing convergence when they generally agreed, comple-
mentarity when they described perspectives of the same
issue, dissonance when they had contradictory findings,
and silence when issues were discussed in one data set but
not the other.15 The analysis and the ensuing recommen-
dations were agreed in interactive investigator meetings
and at the Project Advisory Board. Data saturation was
achieved.
Full ethical (Ref: 12/SW/0330; NRES Committee South
West - Central Bristol) and NHS research and innovation
(Ref: 2762) approvals were obtained by a dedicated team
including the bereaved parent co-investigator and the PPI
panel representative.16 Written consent was obtained from
all participants. The study adhered to COREQ principles.13
Patient involvement
A bereaved parent co-investigator and a patient panel were
involved from the outset in all aspects of study conception,
design, development of study documents for recruitment
and consent, ethics approval,16 project management and
steering, analysis and interpretation, and co-authorship of
this manuscript.
Results
Data were collected from January 2013 to November 2013
from participants in three maternity units in the South
West of England. Thirty-three stillbirths were diagnosed
during this period; 21 of the mothers (64%) and 14 of
their partners agreed to participate in the study. One case
involved death of one twin and survival of the other (sur-
viving multiple), and four cases involved intrapartum still-
births. These five cases will be reported separately. We
focus in this report on the 16 remaining cases: singleton
stillbirths with the fetal death diagnosed before the onset of
labour. Additionally, three staff focus groups took place,
one in each maternity unit. Between six and nine partici-
pants took part in each group, with a minimum of two
obstetric consultants, two senior obstetric trainees, and two
senior midwives per group, for a total of 22 participants
(reported in aggregate without demographics to maintain
confidentiality).
The themes arising from the parent interviews and the
staff focus groups are summarised in Table S1 alongside
example quotes. In addition to the four areas selected a
priori (diagnosis, mode of birth, post-mortem, follow-up),
another area featured strongly in parents’ remarks even
though not specifically prompted: the signs and symptoms
preceding diagnosis and leading to presentation at the hos-
pital. For staff, training and the emotional aspects of birth
were also prominent and overarching.
When comparing the recounted experiences and opin-
ions between parents and staff, there were areas of conver-
gence or complementarity, but also areas of dissonance
where the perceptions and opinions differed, and erroneous
assumptions caused tension and interactions that could be
viewed as insensitive. These areas are summarised in
Table 1, alongside service provision (contextual) data and
multidisciplinary recommendations arising from the inter-
pretation of the integrated evidence, including specific sug-
gestions by parents and staff.
In summary, despite each hospital having a guideline on
how to manage intrauterine fetal death, there was a great
deal of variation within and between hospitals in how the
mothers’ symptoms and signs were managed initially, and
in how diagnosis was undertaken and reported to parents.
Moreover, women were told that reduced fetal movement
is an emergency, but when they reached the hospital they
were not always treated by staff with any apparent sense of
urgency. This was confusing, and parents did not like being
left on their own for long periods of time without informa-
tion. Some examples of the variation in diagnosis are given
in Box 1. Figure 1 shows the large variation in timings
between presentation and first scan, and between presenta-
tion and first intervention (induction of labour or cae-
sarean birth), with case 14 having long delays before both
diagnosis (being sent home for the stillbirth to be con-
firmed the next morning) and intervention.
Whereas families often asked for a caesarean birth, this
was considered unacceptable by staff and gave rise to sig-
nificant dissonance and tension, including two patient
complaints in one maternity unit, largely because of lack of

Signs and
Symptoms
Silence – Signs and symptoms did
not arise in the staff focus groups
but were a critical component of
care for parents even if not
specifically asked about them.
• The variation in manage-
ment of the initial symptoms
was so varied and haphaz-
ard – was likened to a
‘game of snakes and
ladders’
• Antenatal notes should make women
aware of stillbirth and signpost them to fur-
ther information
• There is a need to educate women and
their partners about getting symptoms that
are of concern and out of character to be
checked urgently
• Every obstetric unit should have a protocol
for primary care referral for suspected fetal
death and an integrated care pathway for
management once in hospital
• Healthcare professionals should be trained
to deliver consistent care in response to
worrying signs and symptoms
Diagnosis
Convergence – Both a well-designed
maternity unit and a specific care
pathway are necessary
Complementarity – The initial
diagnosis of stillbirth is urgent but
difficult for parents and staff alike.
Expertise and training in diagnosis
by scan were often missing.
There was a great deal of variation
within and between hospitals in
how the diagnosis was undertaken
and reported to parents. The main
common characteristic was delay
and deferral, particularly at night.
Dissonance – For parents,
management always remains
‘urgent’ whereas for professionals
this urgency stops after the first
scan, sometimes even before final
confirmation.
Parents valued personal space but
not being left alone for long periods
of time without information.
• There was large variation in
the time taken to confirm
diagnosis (Figure 1)
• Initial assessment to confirm
diagnosis was possible in a
private room only in one
maternity unit; in a cur-
tained area in the other two
units
• Every unit should have private room 24/7
for confirming the diagnosis of stillbirth
with scan and for giving parents time after-
wards
• Every unit should always have available at
least one professional experienced in con-
firming with certainty the diagnosis of still-
birth and trained in straightforward,
empathic, but not over-emotional (‘touchy-
feely’) communication
• Training in breaking the bad news should
include all the professionals likely to be
involved; for example, sonographers.
• The professional undertaking the scanning
should warn parents about the silence dur-
ing scanning and be aware of their non-
verbal cues
• There is a range of grief reactions antici-
pated by psychological theories but not by
maternity staff; healthcare professionals
need structured training to manage these
reactions
• Staff need to be aware of the importance
of keeping parents informed of what is
happening and sowing seeds slowly, along
with well written information and normal
expressions of empathy
• A private space is necessary for privacy, not
for abandonment
Birth and
Aftercare
Convergence – Parents and staff
agree that parents’ usual first
reaction is to ask for a caesarean
Dissonance – Staff automatically
shift priorities to the mother,
physical issues, and future
pregnancies, whereas for bereaved
parents their baby is still a baby
Staff wrongly assume that all
families ask for a caesarean as the
easy way out, whereas there are
several different reasons (Panel B)
why bereaved parents ask for one
• All units had a dedicated
bereavement suite for vagi-
nal birth. All units strived for
1:1 midwifery care, but it
was not always possible.
• Two women had a cae-
sarean for medical reasons
(low placenta, previous
history)
• There were two formal com-
plaints from bereaved par-
ents in the last 3 years in
one unit, related to mode of
birth; asking for a caesarean
that was refused
• Staff should not automatically change focus
away from the dead baby, as it creates
tension
• To enable joint-decision making on mode
(and timing) of birth, staff should first
explore the reason(s) why families ask for a
caesarean
• Discussions of mode of birth should include
the thorough preparation of parents for
every step of the process, and conclude
with the development of a revised parent-
centred birth plan
• One-to-one care is as important for
bereaved parents as for other women in
labour; arguably even more so given their
emotional strain

Consent for
Post-Mortem
examination
(PM)
Convergence – Discussions with
staff influenced parents significantly
in their decision making
Dissonance – Some staff found the
PM consent forms onerous, but
parents did not as long as their
completion was supported by
discussion with a professional they
trusted. Some parents thought staff
discouraged them from having a
PM.
• The role of chaplaincy varied
among units
• 57% consented to PM
• The influence of all staff on decision-mak-
ing makes critical their appropriate training
to understand and communicate the pur-
pose and respectful nature of PM and their
ability to explain the role of staff involved
in PM and the local processes and time-
scales for PM
• Not finding a reason for stillbirth is useful
in its own right and should be framed in
positive not negative terms
Follow-Up
Convergence – Parents and staff
agreed that the period between
initial hospital discharge and follow-
up consultation is characterised by
delay, lack of information for
parents, and varied support.
Dissonance - Healthcare staff tend
to assume that primary care (GPs,
community midwives, health visitors)
automatically continues care after
parents are discharged, and follows-
up and supports parents, including
providing the appropriate diagnosis
and management of psychological
issues, counselling needs, and risk of
depression. These assumptions are in
contrast with what bereaved parents
experienced in this study.
• Two of the three units had a
bereavement midwife, one
without dedicated job
description
• The frequency, type, and
number of people involved
in follow-up contacts varied
among cases and units
• One unit offered hospital-
based counselling
• Average time to follow-up
was 71 days with PM and
73 days without PM
• Bereaved parents should be given informa-
tion at initial discharge, including a single
point of contact in the follow-up period
• Care should be streamlined and standard-
ised, including test result reports and letters
• For follow-up consultations, every unit
should provide a dedicated private space, a
named known professional, and a pre-
determined structure to the meeting and
the output of the hospital follow-up consul-
tation; the consultation should include
assessments for pathological/complex grief
• Better collaborative care at the interface
between hospital and community is needed
urgently
Staff Training
in Caring for
Parents with
Stillbirth
Silence – Training was not addressed
by parents in this study.
• One unit had teaching ses-
sions provided by a local
charity
• Another had teaching sus-
pended because there was
no time to fit it in
• The third unit started a 10-
minute training session for
staff after the INSIGHT study
was completed
• Dedicated training in care after stillbirth is
needed and should focus on supporting the
implementation of an evidence-based and
parent-centre integrated care pathway
• Training should include: evidence-based
principles of care and management, com-
mon challenges, difficult situations and
how to address them, psychological theo-
ries and their application in bereavement
care, and good communication principles
as well as techniques for self-composure
and dealing with expected and unexpected
grief reactions, the post-mortem consent
process, and the necessary information to
be given/discussed at discharge from hospi-
tal and in the community
• Training should address common erroneous
assumptions that often compromise care
• Training of out-of-hours staff in ultrasound
scanning skills to be able to diagnose
intrauterine death competently and confi-
dently is critical in providing 24/7 optimal
care
• Dedicated training modules are necessary
for all staff likely to come into contact with
bereaved parents including, for example,
receptionists and porters

All bereaved parents are entitled to good care
 staff awareness of the several different reasons why parents
(and their families) might ask for a caesarean birth
(Box 2). Parents were not prepared for a vaginal birth,
which felt imposed on them by staff. There was provision
of a private space for birth in all three units, but provision
of 1:1 care was not always possible (Table 1).
With regards to discussions around post-mortem exami-
nation of the baby (PM), parents reported many decisions
to make once their baby was born. Parents stated that at
the time of the PM discussion they had not realised how
important the choices they made during this time might
eventually be. Some parents had not consented to a post
mortem, but stated that they would have agreed to a PM if
the healthcare professionals had convinced them that it was
respectful and useful. Parents found useful the ‘drip feed-
ing’ of information by the healthcare professionals and the
trusting relationships they formed, especially with the mid-
wives.
Box 1. Variation in Diagnosis
• Mother being given the diagnosis before the second confir-
matory scan had been performed
• Mother had a physical examination before staff started to
try to find the baby’s heartbeat
• One mother was left sitting in the waiting room and was
then seen in an ordinary room in the unit
• A long delay while staff changed shift – the mother reported
being left sitting for 20 to 30 minutes with nothing being
done
• Being moved between several rooms during the process of
diagnosis with no explanations as to why this was happening
• Being made to wait for two hours alone for a final confir-
matory scan despite being in labour with contractions com-
ing every 2 minutes (it turned out later that the staff on
duty had not called the consultant in)
• One woman reported being left on her own with her Mum
“for ages” after she had been diagnosed
• One couple was sent home to return the next morning for
confirmation of the diagnosis
Box 2. Reasons why bereaved families often ask for a caesarean
birth
Parents
• To restore women’s sense of control by giving them the
option to choose the timing and mode of birth
• Parents have not prepared sufficiently for a vaginal birth pro-
cess, particularly with the added complexity of a stillbirth
• To shorten the (variably long) process from diagnosis to
eventual birth and discharge
• Parents’ wish to avoid labour pains
Baby
• Some parents believe that a quick caesarean section followed
by resuscitation might save the baby
• Because their baby is still a baby to the bereaved patents,
they do not appreciate the automatic shift of priorities to
the mother and her future pregnancies, and the consequent
recommendation of vaginal birth
• For some parents, a baby that has died might still feel pain,
and caesarean birth is perceived as less traumatic for the baby

 The median time to follow-up consultation (with a con-
sultant obstetrician) was very similar, regardless of whether
parents consented to a post-mortem examination of the
baby: 71 days with a PM and 73 days without a PM.
Between their discharge from hospital and their return for
the follow-up consultation, parents would have appreciated
being given information as to who was their nominated
caregiver, the timescale involved, and the purpose of the
follow-up consultation. There were also misunderstand-
ings,
delays,
lack
of
clarity,
and
some
inappropriate
settings (for example antenatal clinics) for the follow-up
consultation.
Discussion
Main findings
The INSIGHT study reveals that, despite the best intentions
of staff who care for bereaved parents, care after stillbirth is
often not as good as it should and could be. There is no
standardised approach to the management of the initial

was wrong before their
baby died
• At the point when parents
felt something was wrong,
only 57% felt that their
concerns were taken
seriously
• There is a need to edu-
cate both parents and
staff; but also to have
systems in place to
support training (tools,
pathways)
Diagnosis and
Breaking News
• Parents have a range of
emotions and reactions
• Parents appreciate having
options and adequate
time to consider them
• Less than half were
involved in decision
making
• One third did not feel
listened to
• Examples of poor prac-
tice included one
woman sent home to
return the next day for
a repeat scan to con-
firm the fetal death,
and one who waited
2 hours
• There is need to train
ALL relevant staff in
ultrasound scanning,
but also in communica-
tion and empathic skills
Birth and Aftercare
• Support and Information
from staff may help par-
ents who feel emotionally
unprepared for a vaginal
birth
• Pain relief options should
be fully discussed
• Only 8% were offered a
caesarean birth
• One in five were left alone
and worried
• Less than half had a room
away from live crying
babies
• Care was sometimes
compromised by delays
in analgesia, absence
of the midwife for sev-
eral hours, women
labouring on the ante-
natal ward, and delays
in care without reason
• Staff should be edu-
cated in discussing
mode of birth with
bereaved parents,
without forgetting that
a baby is always a
baby (even if it has
died)
Consent for
Post-Mortem (PM)
• Staff should be trained to
provide tailored PM dis-
cussions
• Many factors influence PM
consent
• Parents may regret PM
decisions
• Long delays and inconclu-
sive PM results cause
distress
• One in eight were not
asked about a PM
• Less than half found out
the results of the PM
within 8 weeks
• One third of cases had
no documented PM
offer
• Only two thirds of par-
ents were seen within
12 weeks
• Discussions with all
staff influence the par-
ents’ decision more
than staff think
Follow-Up
• Emotional support is
necessary
• Need information on what
to expect postnatally
• The debriefing and follow-
up appointment help
resolve uncertainty
• Clear care pathways are
required at the interface
between primary and
secondary care
• A third were not given
information about lacta-
tion suppression
• There was gap in care and
handover between services
• Care was variable, with
staff uncomfortable about
calling or visiting
• Only half had docu-
mented lactation sup-
pression discussion
• There was lack of
documented handover
to other healthcare
professionals and
organisations
• Delays, substandard
care, and lack of conti-
nuity can be prevented
with streamlined path-
ways and should not
be blamed on investi-
gations (e.g. PM)

All bereaved parents are entitled to good care
 presentation, resulting in inconsistency and at times severe
delays before diagnosis is confirmed. Once the diagnosis is
made, any urgency in management disappears for staff but
not parents. Assumptions, misconceptions, and lack of staff
training result in insensitive interactions and lack of joint
decision-making, particularly with regards to mode of birth
or the decision to have a post-mortem examination of the
baby. After discharge from the hospital, there is no stan-
dardised pathway or protocol for seamless handover and
transition
across
caregivers.
Parents
and
staff
have
described how care could be improved, including through
better education.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first in-depth study to investigate and triangu-
late with a specific framework the experiences and recom-
mendations of bereaved parents and the staff who care for
them, along with service provision data to put the findings
into context. For example, the delays and inconsistencies in
management captured by the INSIGHT study were not just
reported but confirmed, and the reasons clarified for the
first time in the literature.
The staff focus group discussions could have been inhib-
ited by the presence of senior clinicians, but this was not
observed. For example, junior doctors freely commented
on their lack of scan training. However, some findings
might reflect opinion rather than clinical reality; ethno-
graphic observation would be needed for confirmation.
With regards to parent interviews, they relied on recall.
We had therefore arranged for the interviews to take place
reasonably soon after the stillbirth, at a time suitable for cap-
turing the parents’ experience. Some issues — for example
‘not feeling right’ before diagnosis — could be explored in
more detail in a longitudinal study of late pregnancy.
Whereas the study took place in three maternity hospitals
in the same region (southwest England), which might reduce
generalisability, their catchment areas had varied demo-
graphics. Moreover, comparison to the worldwide literature
(Table 2) revealed many similarities; some findings and rec-
ommendations may be applicable to other high- and mid-
dle-income settings. Moreover, the INSIGHT study went
beyond the literature to reveal some previously Unreported
misconceptions with regards to mode of birth, for example,
and to provide specific recommendations to implement

 improvements, inform education programmes, and help
design integrated care pathways and tools to support parents
and staff alike. We acknowledge that the findings are not
directly applicable to low-income countries or to parents
from all cultures and religions, and further research is neces-
sary to understand and improve care in other settings.
Interpretation
It is important to make prospective parents aware of the
possibility of stillbirth before it happens. Stillbirth is ten
times more common than sudden infant death syndrome,17
yet parents might only be aware of the latter. A brief men-
tion of stillbirth in maternity notes alongside signposting
to further information might strike the balance between
scaring all women about pregnancy outcome and prevent-
ing them from being totally unprepared in the event. In
the UK, awareness and management of reduced fetal move-
ment has been prioritised18 in an effort to prevent still-
births from happening. The INSIGHT findings show that
educating parents about the symptoms and signs of still-
birth and, if they occur, having systems in place to manage
them consistently, are essential to reduce the potential for
harm4,19 that might otherwise occur.
INSIGHT has revealed that parents can be exposed to
further avoidable harm because staff, particularly out-of-
hours, might not have been trained adequately in either
practical (ultrasound confirmation of fetal death) or com-
munication skills that are necessary for effective and sensi-
tive handling of the diagnosis. It might not be poor staff
that fail parents, but poor training that fails staff.
Training for staff should move beyond standard technical
and non-technical skills, and should start with a clear
understanding of bereaved parents’ reactions and the under-
lying reasons. The tension between staff and parents with
regards to the latter’s requests for caesarean birth, with rea-
sons for this disconnect explored for the first time, is a clear
example that care cannot and will not improve without first
exploring the problems in depth. In INSIGHT, not a single
set of bereaved parents was offered a choice between differ-
ent modes of birth, similar to what had been shown in pre-
vious
studies
(Table 2)
yet
never
fully
understood.
Moreover, the study revealed that the disconnect between
staff and parents (Table 1) had led to complaints. It is obvi-
ous that staff should be trained to reach joint decisions, not
by paternalistically resisting requests, but by appropriately
preparing both parents for birth and afterwards, and sup-
porting their desires to retain or regain some sense of con-
trol.20 Staff should also be trained to focus on the current
pregnancy, respecting the baby that has died, and not
immediately shifting priorities to the future. It is also obvi-
ous that training staff in exchanging appropriate informa-
tion with parents and maintaining a respectful attitude will
help parents reach decisions that they will be less likely to
regret long-term such as in regards to mode of birth or
post-mortem examination of the baby.

synthesises
the
findings
from
INSIGHT
to
describe what an evidence-based intervention to improve
bereavement care might look like. Additional components
not addressed by INSIGHT might be necessary for a com-
prehensive intervention, for example involving parents in
the hospital perinatal mortality review process.
Conclusion
Staff training alone will not suffice for improving care. Simi-
lar to surgical safety,21 it is the combination of evidence-
based tools, integrated care pathways, and training in how to
use these tools that is likely to improve care for bereaved par-
ents after a stillbirth. It is imperative to standardise
processes, while educating staff to address the parents’ and
their own needs, so they neither ‘make it up as they go’
nor are they or the parents ‘scarred for life’. It is time to
understand, time to educate, time to stop preventable harm
after stillbirth. Every bereaved parent is entitled to good care.
