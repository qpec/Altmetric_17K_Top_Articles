a b s t r a c t
There has been extensive outsourcing of hospital cleaning services in the NHS in England, in part because
of the potential to reduce costs. Yet some argue that this leads to lower hygiene standards and more
infections, such as MRSA and, perhaps because of this, the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish health
services have rejected outsourcing. This study evaluates whether contracting out cleaning services in
English acute hospital Trusts (legal authorities that run one or more hospitals) is associated with risks of
hospital-borne MRSA infection and lower economic costs.
By linking data on MRSA incidence per 100,000 hospital bed-days with surveys of cleanliness among
patient and staff in 126 English acute hospital Trusts during 2010e2014, we find that outsourcing
cleaning services was associated with greater incidence of MRSA, fewer cleaning staff per hospital bed,
worse patient perceptions of cleanliness and staff perceptions of availability of handwashing facilities.
However, outsourcing was also associated with lower economic costs (without accounting for additional
costs associated with treatment of hospital acquired infections).

1. Introduction
There is a long-standing debate in the United Kingdom about
the impact of outsourcing of hospital cleaning services to private
sector contractors. Beginning in 1983, cleaning services were one of
the first parts of the NHS to be contracted to private providers
under HC(8318) “Competitive tendering in the provision of do-
mestic, catering and laundry services”. The then Department of
Health and Social Security wanted hospitals to save money and
argued that they would “make the maximum possible savings by
putting services like laundry, catering and hospital cleaning out to
competitive tender. We are tightening up, too, on management
costs,
and
getting
much
firmer
control
of
staff
number-
s”(Conservative Party, 1983)._ENREF_1_ENREF_1.
Always controversial, in the 1990s critics linked outsourcing to
growing concerns about hospital acquired infections, and in
particular,
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus
(MRSA),
which was felt to be especially frequent in the UK (Johnson, 2011;
Washer and Joffe, 2006). Media coverage emphasised the role
played by “dirty” hospitals (Chan et al., 2010), drawing on evidence
of the importance of hospital cleanliness (Dancer, 2009; Dancer,
2008; Davies, 2009; Davies, 2010), patients’ perception of cleanli-
ness (Greaves et al., 2012; Trucano and Kaldenberg, 2007) and
frequency of handwashing to preventing infections (Sroka et al.,
2010; Stone et al., 2012). There was speculation, and extensive
anecdotal evidence, that contractors were seeking to save money,
for example by employing fewer staff, with poorer working con-
ditions and hence lower motivation, and were as a result achieving
lower levels of cleanliness than the in-house NHS staff they
replaced (Davies, 2010). In addition, contracted-out services were
considered too inflexible to deal with changing circumstances,
including
problems
with unscheduled
cleaning out-of-hours,
which might have increased risks of outbreaks (Davies, 2010).
Because of these concerns, the Royal College of Nursing called for
hospital cleaning to be brought in-house in 2008 (BBC News, 2008)
and, later that year, Nicola Sturgeon, then Scottish Health Minister,
instructed that this be done in all Scottish hospitals to reduce risks
of infection (European Federation of Public Service Unions, 2011)
_ENREF_11_ENREF_1, later linking this move with the subsequent
fall in cases of C. difficile infection (Daily Record, 2011), although

 this view was not universally accepted, with others linking it to
improved antimicrobial stewardship (Nathwani et al., 2012).
Outsourcing has also ceased in Wales and Northern Ireland
(European Federation of Public Service Unions, 2011). However,
these fears were dismissed by others, with the Business Services
Association, representing outsourcing companies, arguing that
“There is no evidence to suggest that outsourcing cleaning services
causes increased rates of infection” (BBC News, 2008)_ENREF_11.
This debate has been handicapped by the scarcity of robust
empirical evidence on the impact of outsourcing per se. A few
descriptive studies from the 1990s, which compared the crude NHS
Audit scores across hospitals, suggested potentially worse perfor-
mance among hospitals outsourcing cleaning services (Davies,
2010). These studies argued that outsourcing to private contrac-
tors led to poorer coordination between nursing staff and inde-
pendent cleaners, especially as previous lines of accountability had
been broken. However, the ability to evaluate these claims was
limited by _ENREF_9a lack of data on rates of hospital-acquired
infection. This has now changed, with the NHS's mandatory sur-
veillance of MRSA, implemented in 2005 (Johnson et al., 2012),
creating a set of comparative data over time. Under the new system,
the MRSA rate is calculated as the number of MRSA bacteraemia
reports from that Hospital Trust per 100,000 bed days (in the UK a
Hospital Trust is a public entity that hospital operates facilities on
one or more sites). Starting from October 2005, all Trusts in England
were asked to submit data electronically, and in 2006 this system
was further enhanced to provide data on possible sources of the
MRSA bacteraemia, although this was only on voluntary basis. Until
2009 reports on MRSA bacteraemia rates in each acute Trust were
published at six or 12 months interval; afterwards the reports were
published on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis.
Here, for the first time to our knowledge, we test the hypothesis
that outsourcing cleaning facilities is associated with greater inci-
dence of MRSA, by linking newly available comparative data on its
incidence with data on the provision of cleaning across English
Acute Hospital Trusts.
2. Methods
2.1. Data sources
We linked data on MRSA incidence with patient reports of
perceived hospital cleanliness, and health workers' reports of
availability of handwashing facilities for 126 Acute Trusts. Data on
hospital-borne MRSA incidence per 100,000 hospital bed-days
were taken from Public Health England's annual reports (Public
Health England, 2015). Data on patient-reported cleanliness were
obtained from the Picker Institute NHS Patient Survey Programme
(Care Quality Commission, 2010e2014) while data on handwashing
facilities were from the Picker NHS National Staff Survey (Picker
Institute Europe, 2010e2014). The two surveys are commissioned
by NHS England from Picker Institute Europe. In the first, each Trust
sends a questionnaire to 850 patients who have spent at least one
night in the hospital between June and August each year. All the
sampled patients are asked “In your opinion, how clean was the
hospital room or ward (toilets and bathrooms) that you were (used)
in? Very clean (excellent), fairly clean, not very clean, not clean at
all”. In the NHS staff survey, each Trust selects a random group of
staff (sample sizes will depend on the number of staff employed by
the organisation from 600 to 850) to be interviewed. The survey
asks all selected employees about their job, management, health/
safety, and well-being in the Trust as well as their personal devel-
opment. Here we are interested in a particular question “Are
handwashing materials always available? Yes/No”. All data were for
the years 2010e2014. Data on whether hospitals outsourced
cleaning were obtained from Patient Environment Action Teams
(2010-2)(Health & Social Care Information Centre, 2010e2014b)
and Patient-Led Assessments of the Care Environment (2013-4)
(Health & Social Information Centre, 2013e2014) (the name
changed but collection practices did not). In practice, virtually all
Trusts either fully outsourced or operated in-house cleaning ser-
vices. Additional data on economic costs of cleaning per bed, staff
numbers, patient mix and demographics, as well as size and ser-
vices provided by the hospitals were taken from Estates Return
Information Collection (ERIC) for the period 2010e2014 (Health &
Social Care Information Centre, 2010-2014a). Table 1 in the web
appendix provides further descriptive statistics for all variables
used in the study.
Our initial sampling frame included all acute general hospital
Trusts in England. We excluded single speciality orthopaedic, car-
diac/ophthalmology/otolaryngology, gynaecology and paediatric
hospitals given their atypical case mix (namely, Harefield, Royal
National Orthopaedic, Royal National Throat, Nose and East Hos-
pital, Papworth, Alder Hey, Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Ortho-
paedic, Great Ormond, Moorefield Eye Hospital, Birmingham
Children's Hospital, Heart of England NHS Foundation, Birmingham
women's NHS foundation Trust and Sandwell and West Birming-
ham Hospital NHS Trust, and Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust).
Between 2010 and 2014 there were a total of 320 Acute Care Trusts,
of which complete data existed for 201. It was not possible to track
data over time in 119 Trusts because they changed identification
codes during mergers. Of the 201, 140 report MRSA rates for the
entire period. To avoid potential confounding from mixed service
providers and switching (and numbers were too small to permit
difference-in-difference analysis), we exclude a further four Trusts
that use a combination of in-house and outsourced services and
another four that changed from in-house to outsourcing (2) or vice-
versa (2). Another four Trusts were removed because of small
numbers or because they reported very high numbers (e.g. 7-fold
higher than the median that indicated major outbreaks likely to
have specific causes). Thus, our final analytical sample includes 126
acute Trusts. Of these 51 outsourced cleaning and 75 retained it in-
house. Web appendix Fig. 1 further documents the sample inclu-
sion criteria.
It is important to ascertain whether there were any pre-existing
differences between hospitals that outsourced cleaning and those
retaining it in-house, which might bias results, for example if
hospitals with a worse cleaning record selectively outsourced it.
Unfortunately, there are few sources of data that would allow such
a comparison. One that does provide some insight is the dataset on
hospital cleanliness, as assessed by the Healthcare Commission,
from between three and five years prior to the data used in the
main analysis, which start in 2010. We use these data to explore
whether our results are consistent after adjusting for pre-existing
differences in hospital sites, as measured by this indicator many
years before the differences in out-sourcing (see web appendix
Fig. 2 for more details).
2.2. Statistical modelling
We used multi-variate regression models to assess the associ-
ation of outsourcing with MRSA incidence rates, as follows:
MRSAit ¼ a þ bOutsourcei þ gTrustit þ mi þ nt þ εit
(1)
Here i is Trust and t is year. MRSA is the MRSA incidence rate per
100,000 hospital beds; Outsource is a dummy for whether the Trust
outsourced cleaning services or retained them in-house; Trust is a
series of variables controlling for Trust differences, including the
number of beds in the Trusts and the average length of stay in the
V. Toffolutti et al. / Social Science & Medicine 174 (2017) 64e69
65
 Trust; m adjusts for four regional dummies (North, South, East, and
West), and n is a set of year dummies to control for geo-spatial
correlation, such as periods of MRSA outbreaks. ε is the error term.
To further adjust for potential confounding and facilitate
comparability across Trusts, in a subsequent step we matched
hospitals
within
geographic
regions
on
dimensions
of
size
(measured by number of hospital beds), complexity (measured as
numbers of specialist and multiservice sites hospital within each
Trust i) and case mix using propensity score matching (Rosenbaum
and Rubin, 1983). Importantly, we match the two dimensions
separately with respect to complexity, to take account of the pos-
sibility that differences in the number of specialist and multiservice
sites might confound the results. Our ability to adjust for patient
case mix is constrained by the absence of any severity measure
based on diagnostic codes or something similar that predicts hos-
pital acquired infection (as opposed to, for example and with ca-
veats, the well-established case mix predictors of mortality).
Propensity Score matching reduces potential confounding by
comparing hospitals operating in similar regions, with matching
size and complexity, but differing their management's choice of
cleaning operation. It is used in policy evaluation because it reduces
confounding compared with simple OLS models (Imbens, 2004). At
this stage the 126 Trusts that had data on both MRSA rates in at
least one year and sufficient information on complexity to enable
matching were analysed. As a further robustness check we also
implement coarsened exact matching (Iacus et al., 2011), which
further address potential sources of residual confounding. The
comparative advantage of coarsened exact matching vis-a-vis
propensity
score
matching
is
that
it
ensures
multivariate
balancing between treated and control group.
All data and models were estimated using Stata version 13. All t-
tests were two-tailed assuming unequal variances. Standard errors
were bootstrapped and clustered by Trust to account for non-
independence of sampling (Abadie and Imbens, 2009).
3. Results
3.1. Unadjusted comparison of outsource and in-house cleaning
provision
Fig. 1 compares the pattern of MRSA incidence per 100,000
hospital bed-days in outsourced and in-house hospitals in 2010.
The mean MRSA incidence in outsourced hospitals is 2.28 per
100,000 bed-days, almost 50% greater than the observed mean of
1.46 per 100,000 bed days in those that retained in-house cleaning
(Stone et al.). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3 in the web appendix, the
entire MRSA risk distribution is greater in outsourced hospitals,
which reflect the high levels of MRSA risk.
Next, we evaluated patient perceptions of cleanliness of bed-
rooms and bathrooms (web appendix Fig. 4a and b). Fewer patients
in Trusts with outsourced services (57.6%) compared to in-house
services (59.7%) described the cleanliness of the bedrooms as
‘excellent’ (t-test: 2.55, p ¼ 0.01). We also observe a similar pattern
for bathroom cleanliness (67.0% for outsourced hospitals compared
with 68.5% for in-house hospitals; t-test ¼ 2.04, p ¼ 0.04).
In web appendix Fig. 5 we present the distribution of the per-
centage of staff who report access to hand-washing material across
Trusts. 63.0% of staff who work in Trusts with outsourced cleaning
services report that hand-washing materials are always available
compared with 68.0% in Trusts with in-house cleaning (t-test: 3.47
p¼<0.001).
3.2. Adjusted association of outsourcing with MRSA incidence rates
Table 1 shows the results of our statistical models, which can be
interpreted as the average variation in MRSA incidence rate be-
tween Trusts which outsourced their cleaning services and those
which retained their cleaning services in house. (In web appendix
table 4, we also present the results using log-outcomes). Using
simple OLS models we estimate that Trusts which outsourced their
cleaning services tend to report on average 0.42 more cases of
MRSA bacteraemia per 100,000 bed-days (95% CI: 0.24 to 0.61, p-
value ¼ 0.001). To translate this number into the original frame-
work, we estimate the level of MRSA infection in two scenarios
when cleaning services for the Trust i are outsourced vis-�
a-vis
when they are provided in house. Accordingly, while outsourced
Trusts will report an average rate of MRSA bacteraemia of to 1.44
cases per 100,000 bed days, their counterpart with in-house
cleaning will report an average MRSA bacteraemia rate of 1.02.
Next, to adjust for differences due to potential observable con-
founding
across
hospitals,
we
estimated
the
association
of
outsourcing with MRSA, adjusting for hospital size, patient mix,
and complexity. As shown Table 1, after correcting for these
potentially confounding factors, we find that outsourcing is still
associated with 0.22 more cases of MRSA bacteraemia per 100,000
bed-days (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.39, p-value ¼ 0.01). Again, to translate
our estimation into a measure that will be meaningful in the
original framework, we estimate the level of MRSA infection in our
two scenarios, setting all the other covariates at their median value.
According to this model, while Trusts outsourcing cleaning will
report a MRSA rate of 1.32 per 100,000 bed-days, their matched in
house comparator will report an average rate of 1.10.
As an additional step, we matched hospitals within geographic
regions of the UK and to the nearest-neighbour on size and
complexity. It was not possible to match 34 of the 126 Trusts using
this method (including 18 Trusts with in-house cleaning and 16
that outsourced it) because they were too different in size (in 18
cases) or complexity (in 12 cases) or in terms of propensity itself
(based on the maximum permitted difference - i.e. the caliper -
between observations) (4 cases), leaving a total of 92 matched
Trusts (see web appendix Tables 3 and 3b for more details).
Table 1 further presents the results of the matched models. As
anticipated, this yields a more precise estimate, with outsourcing
now associated with 0.29 more cases of MRSA bacteraemia per
100,000 bed-days (95% CI: 0.17 to 0.37, p-value ¼ 0.01).
Trusts outsourcing cleaning report an average rate of MRSA
bacteraemia of 1.34 per 100,000 bed-days while their in-house
counterparts report an average rate of 1.05 per 100,000 bed-days.
Finally, we implemented a Heckman selection model to assess
the possibility of selection bias into outsourcing. We do not find
clear evidence suggesting selection (IMR ¼ 0.27, p ¼ 0.38) (Table 1
column 4). The coefficient is not, however, statistically significant,
mainly because standard errors tend to be large when the common
support condition is not reached (Caliendo and Kopeinig, 2008).
Table 2-presents the estimation of the association between
outsourcing of cleaning services on outcomes other than MRSA
infection rates, adjusting the differences between in-house and
outsourced cleaning procedure through propensity score matching,
namely percentage of staff reporting ready access to hand-washing
material (column 1), percentage of patients reporting excellent
cleanliness for the bathroom they used (column 2). We present the
results in terms of the average variation in MRSA incidence be-
tween Trusts which outsource their cleaning services and those
which retain their cleaning services in house. The variation in
percentage points is presented in web appendix table 5.
Our evidence indicates that in outsourced Trusts fewer people
report ready access to hand-washing material (i.e. our proxy for the
shortage of handwashing materials) by about 1.22% (95% CI –1.79%
to �0.58%), and about 1 percentage points fewer patients reporting
excellent cleanliness for the bathrooms (�0.45% percentage of

66
 patients reporting excellent cleanliness 95% CI: �0.46% to �0.44%0)
and for rooms/wards (�0.76%, 95% CI: �0.01% to �0.002%). Trans-
lating the coefficients into the original framework, we find that
while 61.3% of the outsourced Trusts will report having hand-
washing material always available, their in-house peers will have
62.7%. The percentage of patients reporting excellent cleanliness in
the bathrooms (rooms) are 58% (66.8%) and 58.49% (67.5%)
respectively.

 3.3. Comparing economic costs
Since one of the main arguments for outsourcing cleaning ser-
vice in hospitals was to reduce costs, we also estimate the associ-
ation between outsourcing of cleaning services on the cleaning cost
per bed (see column 1 in Table 3) and cleaning personnel (column
2). The variation in percentage points is presented in web appendix
table 6.
Our models estimate that outsourced Trusts have a lower cost of
cleaning per bed of about £236 per bed per year (95% CI: £294 to
-£172), and employ fewer cleaning staff, by about �0.006 people
(95% CI: �0.008 to �0.001). Translating these coefficients into
predictions, we find that the average cost per bed for Trusts that
outsourced their cleaning services is about £2,894, while the
average cost per bed for their in-house counterpart is about £3130.
Here, adjusting for potential confounding factors appear to be
particularly relevant, since the unadjusted comparison between the
two average cost would have been misleading. With respect to the
cleaning staff employed, we predict that outsourced Trusts would
employ 0.126 staff per-bed, while in-house Trusts would employ
0.133 staff per-bed.
3.4. Robustness checks
We applied a series of sensitivity tests to our main statistical
models, presented in web appendix table 7. The variation in per-
centage points is presented in web appendix table 8.
First, we restricted the sample to only those Trusts which had
one hospital site (63% of the final sample e column 1). The results
did not qualitatively differ (0.30 more cases of MRSA bacteraemia
per 100,000 bed-days; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.43). Second we used
Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to re-estimate our matching
models (Iacus et al., 2011), with similar results (0.30; 95% CI: 0.23 to
0.41). Third, to ensure that our results were not driven by the
balanced panel, we ran a robustness test including all the Trusts
observed at least once, and we find qualitatively similar results.
Fourth, we check whether our results were driven by any pre-
existing difference between outsourced and in-house Trusts. We
replicated our analysis dropping two out of the five years, finding
results consistent with our main ones. Fifth, to ensure that our
results are not driven by the linear functional form we use a
Poisson-model, again finding similar results (0.24, 95% CI: 0.19
0.65). Unfortunately, the models for counting data, such as Poisson
models are limited to nonnegative numbers, therefore we cannot
compute this robustness check for the log-outcomes. _ENREF_22.
4. Discussion
Outsourcing cleaning services was associated with significantly
greater MRSA incidence, more reports that handwashing materials
are not always available, and patient perceptions of less clean
bathrooms and rooms/wards. However, economic costs per bed of
outsourcing were also lower.
Our study has several limitations. First, we are currently using
data only on Trusts whose MRSA incidence rate was recorded in all
five years of the analysis. Attrition might be associated with a
higher MRSA incidence rate, although we assume that this is not
associated with the cleaning service type. We ran a robustness test
including all the Trusts observed at least once, and we find quali-
tatively similar results. Outsourced Trusts tend to exhibit 0.35 (95
CI: 0.25 to 0.46) more cases of MRSA bacteraemia per 100,000 bed
days. In the matching exercise, we were unable to include all Trusts
because some lacked data on complexity and only 92 could be
matched on these variables. Secondly, we only use data at Trust
level, because of the lack of MRSA incidence data at site level. Since
different sites within a single Trust might have adopted different
cleaning-services, we might have misclassified the type of cleaning
service. However, even when we restrict our models to include only
single-site Trusts, we find similar results, suggesting that any bias
created by misclassification of cleaning services is minor. Third,
cleanliness is very likely to affect incidence rates of other hospital
acquired infections but MRSA is currently the only infection for
which we have comparable data. In addition, MRSA data are limited
to infections that are detected in an individual's bloodstream and
not all isolations. Hence our assessment of the problem is likely to
be a substantial underestimate. Fourth, we would ideally wish to
evaluate Trusts that switched cleaning services; however, in the
period for which data were available, relatively few trusts switch,
and a complicating factor is that these switches were likely to have
occurred in relation to performance issues. However we can draw
on the findings of a study that introduced an extra cleaner to two
matched wards for six months each, using a crossover design, and
found a 27% reduction in infections with MRSA, with the benefit
disappearing after removal of the cleaner (S. J. Dancer et al., 2009).
This is directly relevant to our finding that outsourced cleaning
employs fewer staff. Fifth, we do not have any information on the
screening practises used by the Trusts but there is no reason to
believe that this would be systematically different between the in-
house and the outsourced ones. Sixth, we did not have any data on
staff-turnover or recruitment and/or sickness leave, which might
be a good measure of both job-dissatisfaction and cleaning quality.
Seventh, using data from several years before our study, we found
no evidence that those Trusts outsourcing cleaning were system-
atically less clean, a possible cause of confounding by indication.
However, caution is required as we cannot be sure that the
Healthcare Commission data exclude a selection effect. Unfortu-
nately, there are no other data that would be able to do so.
These findings have important implications. Although, from a
narrow accounting perspective, Trusts outsourcing cleaning seem
to incur lower costs of cleaning per bed, this is also associated with

(PLACE) (2013e2015), ERIC (Estates Return Information Collection) (2010e2015), NHS Inpatient Survey (2010e2014), NHS Staff Survey (2010e2014), and Public Health for
England (2010e2014). Bootstrapped SE-values in parentheses (250 replications), stratifying by type of cleaning service. Coefficients represent average variation in MRSA
incidence rate between Trust which outsource their cleaning services and those which retain their cleaning services in house. The dependent variable represents: cost for
cleaning (per-bed column 1, measured in £), staff employed for cleaning per-bed (column 2, measured in people per bed [p]).Trust are matched through Propensity Score
Matching and their distribution are aligned by region, number of beds, number of specialist sites, number of multi sites. After having aligned the distribution we regress,
through a linear model, the dependent variable on the number of beds, average length of stay, regional and year dummies.

 fewer staff and reduced reported availability of hand-washing
material as well as an overall increased incidence of MRSA. How-
ever, it is not possible to conduct a full economic analysis because of
an absence of comprehensive data on the nature and severity of the
entire range of infections associated with poor cleaning, any addi-
tional deaths, the additional cost of treatment, and any associated
costs, such as litigation. This is clearly an area for future research.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the fact that the antibiotic
armamentarium is rapidly depleting means that our findings
should be considered a reason for considerable concern.
