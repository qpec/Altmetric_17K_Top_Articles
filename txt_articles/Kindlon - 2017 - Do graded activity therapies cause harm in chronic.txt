In their response to Geraghty’s editorial, White 
et al. (2017) claimed that the PACE (Pacing, 
graded Activity, and Cognitive behavioural ther-
apy: a randomised Evaluation) trial, along with 
other studies, provide evidence that both cogni-
tive behavioural therapy (CBT) and graded 
exercise therapy (GET) are ‘safe and effective 
treatments’ for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). 
In this commentary, I consider some issues that 
deserve more attention regarding the safety and 
potential harms associated with CBT and GET, 
both within the PACE trial and also as they are 
used in clinical practice.
Historically, there has been more of a focus 
 
on efficacy measures than on the reporting of 
adverse events in clinical trials. This has led to 
specific Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT) guidelines being developed 
for the reporting of harms (Ioannidis et al., 
 
2004). However, there remains much scope for 
improvement in the reporting of harms in clinical 
trials, particularly with non-pharmacological 
interventions (Duggan et al., 2014; Meister et al., 
2016). Compounding this issue is the fact that out-
side of clinical trials, systems for reporting adverse 
events associated with non-pharmacological 
interventions are more ad hoc and less well-devel-
oped than those for pharmacological interven-
tions. This all means that signs of harm can be 
missed, leading to a false level of confidence that 
particular therapies are safe for all.
Exercise is a widely used intervention, pro-
viding benefit for people with many conditions. 
Do graded activity therapies cause 
harm in chronic fatigue syndrome?

Abstract
Reporting of harms was much better in the PACE (Pacing, graded Activity, and Cognitive behavioural therapy: 
a randomised Evaluation) trial than earlier chronic fatigue syndrome trials of graded exercise therapy and 
cognitive behavioural therapy. However, some issues remain. The trial’s poor results on objective measures 
of fitness suggest a lack of adherence to the activity component of these therapies. Therefore, the safety 
findings may not apply in other clinical contexts. Outside of clinical trials, many patients report deterioration 
with cognitive behavioural therapy and particularly graded exercise therapy. Also, exercise physiology 
studies reveal abnormalities in chronic fatigue syndrome patients’ responses to exertion. Given these 
considerations, one cannot conclude that these interventions are safe and risk-free.

Commentary

But it has the potential to cause harm (Barg 
et al., 2011; Cooper et al., 2007). As Cooper 
et al. highlight, ‘like pharmaceutical therapies, 
prescribing exercise as therapy, an activity that 
is gaining in acceptance throughout the medical 
community, must be predicated on understand-
ing the risks and benefits of exercise as thor-
oughly as possible’ (p. 706). Some examples 
given by Cooper et al. (2007) of possible harms 
from exercise include exercise-associated aller-
gic responses, overuse syndromes, exercise-
induced bronchoconstriction and exacerbation 
of intercurrent acute and chronic illnesses.
Even low-intensity exercise has the potential 
to exacerbate symptoms in CFS, and the effects 
of exercise have been found to persist for more 
than a week after exertion. Single-trial studies 
have found that gentle exercise of less than an 
average of 7-minute duration can lead to a self-
reported worsening of fatigue, pain, sore throat 
and/or general health (Nijs et al., 2008; Van 
Oosterwijck et al., 2010). Long-term studies 
show that the effects of exercise can persist well 
beyond 24 hours. One study followed 25 women 
with CFS and 23 age-matched sedentary con-
trols for 7 days after a maximal cardiopulmo-
nary exercise test (VanNess et al., 2010). In all, 
85 per cent of the sedentary controls but none of 
the CFS patients had recovered based on ques-
tionnaire responses after 24 hours; the equiva-
lent figures for 48 hours were 100 and 4 per 
cent. In total, 60 per cent of the CFS patients 
took more than 5 days to recover. Similarly, 
Lapp (1997) followed 31 of his patients for 
12 days after a maximal exercise test. The aver-
age relapse lasted 8.82 days although 22 per 
cent were still in relapse when the study ended 
at 12 days. Some evidence suggests that there is 
an ‘activity ceiling’ in CFS above which patients 
cannot go without experiencing a worsening of 
symptoms (Black and McCully, 2005). These 
findings, taken together, suggest that interven-
tions involving exercise could provoke a gen-
eral and persistent worsening or exacerbation of 
symptoms in CFS. They also offer an explana-
tion as to why it might be difficult for patients 
with CFS to adhere to graded activity/exercise 
interventions.
The PACE trial demonstrated many ele-
ments of good trial reporting including regard-
ing harms. For example, they published the 
manuals for both therapist and participants, as 
recommended by the CONSORT extension for 
trials assessing non-pharmacologic treatments 
(Boutron et al., 2008). Trial outcomes included 
not just efficacy but also specific harms meas-
ures and the protocol included systems to track 
possible adverse events. This was a significant 
improvement over previous trials of CBT and 
GET, where the reporting of harms has been 
described as poor (Chambers et al., 2006; 
Marques et al., 2015; Price et al., 2008; Smith 
et al., 2015). Consequently, virtually, all the 
evidence we have about the harms associated 
with CBT and GET is derived from the PACE 
trial. This is unfortunate, because it applies only 
to the particular variants of CBT and GET that 
were used in the PACE trial: many differences 
can exist between behavioural interventions 
that appear superficially similar (Marks, 2009).
Reporting of adverse events 
and reactions in the PACE 
trial
The PACE trial researchers have been criticised 
for how some of the efficacy outcome measures 
were reported (Stouten et al., 2011; White et al., 
2007; Wilshire et al., 2016). The changes to the 
composite recovery outcome are arguably the 
most notable: all four elements of the criteria 
were changed. Two of the criteria were relaxed 
so much that participants could deteriorate on 
the measures from baseline and still be counted 
as recovered. Some post-protocol changes were 
also made to the criteria for defining adverse 
events. Originally, adverse outcomes were 
defined as a score of 5–7 on the participant-
rated Clinical Global Impression (PCGI) scale 
or a drop of 20 points on the 36-Item Short 
Form Survey (SF-36) physical function (PF) 
score from the prior measurement (White et al., 
2007). But by the time the Lancet paper was 
published, ‘serious deterioration in health’ was 
defined as any of the following outcomes (bold-
ing by the present author): (1) a decrease in 
 1148 
Journal of Health Psychology 22(9)
SF-36 PF score of 20 or more between baseline 
and any two consecutive assessment interviews, 
(2) scores of ‘much worse’ or ‘very much 
worse’ (6 or 7) on the PCGI scale at two con-
secutive assessment interviews, (3) withdrawal 
from treatment after 8 weeks because of a par-
ticipant feeling worse or (4) a ‘serious adverse 
reaction’. Data on those participants whose 
scores on the SF-36 PF scale dropped by 20 
points or more at a single timepoint were never 
published nor were data on those who scored 5 
on the PCGI. Also, the changes from the proto-
col were never highlighted explicitly to readers. 
Subsequently, data on post hoc measures of 
deterioration, 8 points on the SF-36 PF scale or 
2 points on the Chalder fatigue questionnaire 
(Likert scoring), were published (Dougall et al., 
2014).
In total, 3774 adverse events were recorded 
across the four arms of the PACE trial (White 
et al., 2011). In the final reports from the trial, 
the following categories were used to define 
severe adverse events (SAEs): (1) death; (2) 
life-threatening event; (3) hospitalisation (hos-
pitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-exist-
ing condition is not included); (4) increased 
severe and persistent disability, defined as a sig-
nificant deterioration in the participant’s ability 
to carry out their important activities of daily 
living of at least 4-week continuous duration; 
(5) any other important medical condition which 
may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the other categories listed; and 
(6) any episode of deliberate self-harm. Using 
this coding scheme, the researchers identified 48 
SAEs during the trial, though without detailing 
which trial arm they occurred in. This seems 
unfortunate especially given that the authors 
stated that there was a statistically significant 
difference between the number of SAEs that 
occurred in the GET group (17) compared to the 
specialist medical care (SMC)-only group (7).
Severe adverse reactions (SARs) were defined 
as any of the SAEs that could be considered to be 
causally related to the interventions themselves. 
The PACE trial researchers further identified 10 
events as SARs, and for these, we were given 
information about treatment condition. There 
were two SARs in the GET condition 
(‘Deterioration in mobility and self-care’ and 
‘Worse CFS symptoms and function’) and four in 
the CBT condition (‘Episode of self harm’, ‘Low 
mood and episode of self harm’, ‘Worsened 
mood and CFS symptoms’ and ‘Threatened self 
harm’). All of these were considered by an asses-
sor to be ‘possibly related’ rather than ‘probably 
related’ or ‘definitely related’ to the intervention.
However, the trial’s definitions of SAEs/
SARs may not be sensitive enough to isolate 
some significant adverse events. Indeed, it was 
possible to have a ‘non-serious adverse event’ 
in the PACE trial that was classed as ‘severe’. 
Adverse events can include those in the eco-
nomic and social domains as well as those of a 
biological or psychological nature (Office for 
the Protection from Research Risks, NIH, PHS, 
DHHS, 1993). Deteriorations that lasted less 
than 4 weeks, particularly those that occurred 
more than once, could, for example, affect 
somebody’s ability to maintain a job or keep up 
with an educational course: harms affecting 
major life goals.
In total, the non-serious adverse events were 
divided up as follows between the trial arms: 
adaptive pacing therapy (APT): 949, CBT: 848, 
GET: 992 and SMC alone: 977. Most participants 
reported at least one non-serious adverse event: 
APT: 152 (96% of the sample), CBT: 143 (89%), 
GET: 149 (93%) and SMC: 149 (93%). Data for 
the numbers and percentages of participants with 
one or more non-serious adverse events were cat-
egorised as follows: eyes and ENT, CFS/ME/
PVFS, gastro-intestinal, psychol[ogical]/psychiat-
ric, musculoskeletal, obs/gynae/urinary, respira-
tory, 
dermatological, 
neurological, 
stressful 
events, cardiovascular, nutrient and blood, aller-
gies, endocrine and miscellaneous. There were no 
statistically significant differences in any of these 
categories (Dougall et al., 2014). A lot of informa-
tion on harms was published in the two papers that 
dealt with these issues but it would have been 
interesting if additional data had been made avail-
able, particularly on ‘non-serious’ adverse reac-
tions (as opposed to events) and on the ‘non-serious 
adverse events’ which had been classified as 
‘severe’ (Dougall et al., 2014; White et al., 2011).
 Kindlon 
1149
Both the forms of CBT and GET investi-
gated were based on models that view inactivity 
and deconditioning as the major driver in per-
petuating CFS symptoms (Burgess and Chalder, 
2004b). Similarly, with both interventions, par-
ticipants were encouraged to consider increased 
symptoms as a ‘natural response to increased 
activity’ (Burgess and Chalder, 2004b: 28). 
Such a view has the potential to bias the report-
ing of adverse events by participants and indeed 
professionals. For example, a participant in the 
CBT or GET group might not mention the 
occurrence or exacerbation of a particular 
symptom, because they may see it as a normal 
response to increased activity, while a partici-
pant in the other trial arms who had the very 
same experience might be more inclined to 
mention it. It is difficult to know how to defini-
tively deal with such issues given the nature of 
the therapies. Hopefully, with further progress 
in understanding the pathophysiology of CFS, 
more objective tests will be developed to help 
identify the risk of harm with a particular dos-
age of activity and/or record when harm has 
actually occurred.
Adherence
Since there were few differences among the dif-
ferent trial arms in terms of adverse outcomes that 
were reported, the results appear reassuring. 
However, an important issue remains: the degree 
of adherence to the interventions. The CONSORT 
statement on harms notes that ‘it is important to 
report participants who are non-adherent or lost to 
follow-up because their actions may reflect their 
inability to tolerate the intervention’ (Ioannidis 
et al., 2004: 785). If participants do not take medi-
cation as prescribed, one is left with little useful 
information about harms associated with it. 
Similarly, with non-pharmacological interven-
tions, one should look for evidence of adherence 
to the programmes before feeling reassured that 
they are safe. The principal measure reported in 
the PACE trial was attendance at appointments 
(either in person or by telephone; White et al., 
2011). For some non-pharmacological interven-
tions, this might be the most important measure of 
compliance. However, attendance at an appoint-
ment every 2 weeks or so seems unsatisfactory as 
the chief measure of compliance in a trial of GET 
where participants were encouraged to exercise 
several times a week. The same is true for the 
CBT intervention, since it also required partici-
pants to gradually increase both physical and 
mental activities (White et al., 2011). The form of 
CBT assessed regarded CFS as being ‘reversible’ 
(White et al., 2011: 825). Interestingly, there were 
minimal changes in fitness levels at 12 months for 
both the CBT and GET groups compared to base-
line (Chalder et al., 2015). There was also no dif-
ference in the fitness outcome measure compared 
to the other two treatment arms neither of which 
encouraged participants to increase activity levels. 
This suggests a lack of compliance to the activity 
component of the CBT and GET interventions.
In terms of the 6-minute walking test, from a 
low baseline of 333 m, the CBT group only 
improved by an average of 21 m over the 
12 months of the PACE trial, a similar amount to 
the APT and SMC-only groups (White et al., 
2011). The GET group did have a statistically 
significant improvement reaching 379 m, 35 m 
more than the group that received SMC alone 
when baseline adjustments were applied (White 
et al., 2011). However, this remained a very poor 
result: less than, for example, the average for a 
sample of over 1000 cardiopulmonary patients 
reported in a review of 11 studies (Ross et al., 
2010). Using a reference equation for the 6-min-
ute walking test, the expected group average for 
a healthy cohort with a similar gender make-up 
(77% female) and average age to the PACE trial 
cohort is 719 m (Beekman et al., 2014). In fact, 
only two individual participants in the CBT arm, 
one in the SMC-only arm and no individuals in 
the GET arm of the PACE trial exceeded the 
expected lower bound of normal for individuals 
in such a group (589 m) (QMUL, 2016; Wilshire 
et al., 2016). It is also possible that a single exer-
cise test may be insufficient to demonstrate the 
degree of functional impairment in CFS patients 
due to the abnormal response to exercise in the 
condition (Keller et al., 2014; VanNess et al., 
2008). These results again suggest that the 
degree of adherence to the activity/exercise 
 1150 
Journal of Health Psychology 22(9)
components of the CBT and GET programmes 
may have been unsatisfactory.
Such poor results on objective measures 
were not fully unexpected. For example, a 
review of three trials of Dutch-graded, activity-
oriented CBT interventions found that CFS par-
ticipants did not increase their total activity 
level compared to the control groups as meas-
ured objectively with actometers, with activity 
levels remaining low (Wiborg et al., 2010), 
despite improvements being reported on some 
self-report measures. A similar result was found 
in a US study (Friedberg and Sohl, 2009). The 
PACE trial researchers initially planned to use 
actigraphy as an outcome measure in the PACE 
trial but ‘decided that a test that required par-
ticipants to wear an actometer around their 
ankle for a week was too great a burden at the 
end of the trial’ (White et al., 2008). This deci-
sion is puzzling, given that the researchers 
required participants to wear an actometer for a 
week at baseline when they would have been 
expected to be less well than at the end of the 
trial. Information from actigraphy would have 
provided useful information on fidelity with the 
treatment protocols.
An alternative interpretation of the poor fit-
ness and walking-distance results in the PACE 
trial is that instead of demonstrating a lack of 
adherence to the therapies, participants faith-
fully undertook the graded activity and exercise 
elements of the interventions but still only had 
very poor levels of improvement in the 6-min-
ute walking test and in fitness post CBT and 
GET. This might be possible if there was an 
ongoing disease process in CFS. It would, how-
ever, seem to contradict the models proposed in 
the PACE trial’s CBT and GET treatment man-
uals where the problems associated with CFS 
are seen as reversible using the interventions 
(Bavinton et al., 2004a, 2004b; Burgess and 
Chalder, 2004a, 2004b).
A review of patient surveys outside of clini-
cal trials found pacing was associated with far 
fewer reports of deterioration than CBT and 
GET (Kindlon, 2011). If, as seems likely, there 
was some non-adherence in the PACE trial to 
the CBT and GET interventions, it would be 
interesting to have data on what form this non-
adherence took. With GET in the PACE trial, 
what participants were asked to do was deter-
mined by ‘their planned physical activity, and 
not their symptoms’ (Bavinton et al., 2004a); 
similarly, ‘a central concept of GET is to 
MAINTAIN exercise as much as possible dur-
ing a CFS/ME setback’ (p. 51) and ‘if the par-
ticipant reports an increase in fatigue as a 
response to a new level of exercise, they should 
be encouraged to remain at the same level for 
an extra week or more’ (p. 66). A similar view 
was taken with CBT in the PACE trial where 
reducing activity based on increased symptoms 
was seen as a maintaining factor in the illness 
and part of a ‘vicious circle of fatigue’ (Burgess 
and Chalder, 2004b: 21). Conversely, in the 
APT arm in the PACE trial, ‘activity is planned 
and then modified in the light of its effect on 
symptoms’ (Bavinton et al., 2004a: 16). If par-
ticipants in the GET and CBT arms of the trial 
reduced their activity levels based on symp-
toms, this could be described as treatment con-
tamination with pacing.1
Data from patient surveys and 
exercise studies
Why is all this important? Because outside of the 
confines of clinical trials, high rates of adverse 
effects have been reported with CBT and particu-
larly GET by myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) 
and CFS patients. A review of 10 patient surveys 
from four countries found that 51 per cent of 
respondents (range = 28%–82%, n = 4338, eight 
surveys) reported that GET worsened their health, 
whereas 20 per cent of respondents (range = 7%–
38%, n = 1808, five surveys) reported similar 
results for CBT (Kindlon, 2011). These results 
are consistent with a 2015 report which also 
included much qualitative data highlighting the 
sometimes long-term and severe nature of the 
deterioration following CBT and GET (ME 
Association, 2015). Clinical trials can represent 
artificial environments where clinicians may, for 
example, be more cautious with some interven-
tions, given the closer monitoring they are 
 
under compared to when non-pharmacological 
 Kindlon 
1151
interventions are used in routine practice (Chou 
et al., 2008; Rawlins, 2008).
Post-exertional malaise is a key symptom of 
ME/CFS, and though it is not required for the 
Oxford criteria which were used to select partici-
pants in the PACE trial, it is an essential part of 
many criteria used by researchers (indeed it was 
proposed that the condition be renamed ‘systemic 
exertion intolerance disease’ in 2015) (Institute of 
Medicine (IOM), 2015; Jason and Fragale, 2016; 
Sharpe et al., 1991). It is not, therefore, that sur-
prising that interventions aiming to increase lev-
els of activity and exercise could cause adverse 
events in those affected by this symptom com-
plex. In the PACE trial, which used the broad 
Oxford criteria, post-exertional malaise at base-
line was reported by 84 per cent in the APT group, 
85 per cent in the CBT group, 82 per cent in the 
GET group and 87 per cent in the control (SMC-
only) group (White et al., 2011).
Numerous biological abnormalities have also 
been found following exertion in the condition 
(Lane et al., 2003; Light et al., 2009; Sorensen 
et al., 2009; Twisk and Maes, 2009). They have 
been categorised as follows: energetic abnormal-
ities and reduced oxygen uptake amplified by 
exertion; muscular abnormalities related to exer-
cise; long-lasting oxidative stress in response to 
exercise; increased pain sensitivity and lower 
pain thresholds during and after exercise; immu-
nologic abnormalities in response to exertion; 
cardiovascular dysfunction related to exertion 
and orthostasis; autonomic abnormalities associ-
ated with exercise and orthostatic stress; and 
neurologic abnormalities in relation to physical 
and mental exertion (Twisk and Geraghty, 2015). 
These abnormalities again highlight the potential 
for harm from exercise in the illness.
Conclusion
Even if one assumes that there were no significant 
adverse events associated with CBT and GET in 
the PACE trial, it is unclear what healthcare staff, 
patients and others can read into such findings, 
given the question marks over compliance. What 
activity and exercise regimes are actually safe to 
use? Ones that do not increase fitness levels?
Future trials need to collect and report on 
objective data using devices, such as actometers 
and heart rate monitors, to help us establish 
what exactly is tested in trials of CBT and GET 
for CFS. Until that time and given the high rates 
of harm that have been reported outside clinical 
trials, caution needs to be used before propos-
ing that any individual ME/CFS patient can 
safely increase their total exercise or activity 
levels using CBT or GET.

Note
1. 
It is possible to devise a hybrid programme where 
symptom-contingent pacing can be combined with 
exercise (Goudsmit et al., 2012). For example, a group 
of Australians developed a programme of exercise in 
which ‘on days when symptoms are worse, patients 
should either shorten the session to a time they con-
sider manageable or, if feeling particularly unwell, 
abandon the session altogether’ (Wallman et al., 2005). 
However, that should not be confused with the type of 
GET programme assessed in the PACE trial.
