Abstract
Background
In 2015, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended tar-
geted screening for prediabetes and diabetes (dysglycemia) in adults who are aged 40 to
70 y old and overweight or obese. Given increasing prevalence of dysglycemia at younger
ages and lower body weight, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities, we sought to deter-
mine whether the current screening criteria may fail to identify some high-risk population
subgroups.
Methods and Findings
We investigated the performance of the 2015 USPSTF screening recommendation in
detecting dysglycemia among US community health center patients. A retrospective analy-
sis of electronic health record (EHR) data from 50,515 adult primary care patients was con-
ducted. Longitudinal EHR data were collected in six health centers in the Midwest and
Southwest. Patients with a first office visit between 2008 and 2010 were identified and fol-
lowed for up to 3 y through 2013. We excluded patients who had dysglycemia at baseline
and those with fewer than two office visits during the follow-up period. The exposure of inter-
est was eligibility for screening according to the 2015 USPSTF criteria. The primary out-
come was development of dysglycemia during follow-up, determined by: (1) laboratory
results (fasting/2-h postload/random glucose � 100/140/200 mg/dL [5.55/7.77/11.10 mmol/

aged �40 y, 33,537 (66.4%) were overweight or obese, and 39,061 (77.3%) were racial/eth-
nic minorities (34.6% Black, 33.9% Hispanic/Latino, and 8.7% Other). Overall, 29,946
(59.3%) patients had a glycemic test within 3 y of follow-up, and 8,478 of them developed
dysglycemia. Only 12,679 (25.1%) patients were eligible for screening according to the
2015 USPSTF criteria, which demonstrated the following sensitivity and specificity (95%
CI): 45.0% (43.9%–46.1%) and 71.9% (71.3%–72.5%), respectively. Racial/ethnic minori-
ties were significantly less likely to be eligible for screening yet had higher odds of develop-
ing dysglycemia than whites (odds ratio [95% CI]: Blacks 1.24 [1.09–1.40]; Hispanics 1.46
[1.30–1.64]; and Other 1.33 [1.16–1.54]). In addition, the screening criteria had lower sensi-
tivity in all racial/ethnic minority groups compared to whites. Limitations of this study include
the ascertainment of dysglycemia only among patients with available test results and find-
ings that may not be generalizable at the population level.
Conclusions
Targeted diabetes screening based on new USPSTF criteria may detect approximately half
of adult community health center patients with undiagnosed dysglycemia and proportion-
ately fewer racial/ethnic minorities than whites. Future research is needed to estimate the
performance of these screening criteria in population-based samples.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• In October 2015, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a
new diabetes screening recommendation for adults who are aged 40–70 y and over-
weight or obese.
• These screening criteria may miss high-risk groups who develop prediabetes and diabe-
tes (together called dysglycemia) at younger ages or at a normal weight.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We conducted a study of electronic health record data from adult primary care patients
at US community health centers between 2008 through 2013.
• The goal of the study was to determine patient characteristics associated with being eligi-
ble for diabetes screening, receiving a screening test, and developing dysglycemia over a
3-y period.
• The USPSTF screening criteria identified approximately half of patients who developed
dysglycemia and proportionately fewer cases of dysglycemia among racial/ethnic minor-
ities than whites.

 What Do These Findings Mean?
• Primary care providers may miss a substantial proportion of patients with dysglycemia
by following the current USPSTF screening recommendation.
• Providers may consider screening patients from racial/ethnic minority groups before the
age and weight ranges recommended by the USPSTF.
• However, patients may incur out-of-pocket costs when their doctors obtain a diabetes
screening test that does not follow the USPSTF recommendation.
Introduction
Diabetes affects over 410 million adults worldwide, with a growing global burden that is pro-
jected to increase [1,2]. In the US, 14% of adults have diabetes [3], which results in significant
associated morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures [4]. An estimated 38% of US
adults have prediabetes [3], which comprises impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting
glucose. These two high-risk states are characterized by elevations of plasma glucose above the
normal range but below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes. Large randomized trials on three
continents have demonstrated that structured, intensive lifestyle interventions can prevent or
delay the onset of diabetes in adults with impaired glucose tolerance [5–8]. Of the many medi-
cation trials to prevent diabetes among those at high risk, metformin has been most widely
studied and has found to be safe and effective at achieving this outcome [5,9,10]. The standards
of care for treating diagnosed diabetes have been informed by an even larger evidence base
[11]. The availability of effective treatments to prevent and treat diabetes underscores the
importance of population-based strategies for identifying those at high risk.
Screening for prediabetes and diabetes (collectively referred to here as dysglycemia) has
been recommended by many expert groups to improve evidence-based diabetes prevention
and treatment efforts. In the US, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an inde-
pendent group of experts that reviews the evidence supporting screening tests and other clinical
preventive services, and develops recommendations for their use in practice [12]. Federal law
in the US requires that health insurance plans cover services recommended by the USPSTF
without cost sharing [13]. In October 2015, this group issued a new recommendation to screen
asymptomatic adults who are 40 to 70 y old and overweight or obese for dysglycemia using one
of the following tests: hemoglobin A1C (A1C), fasting plasma glucose, or 2-h postload glucose
during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test [14].
Previous studies have investigated the effectiveness of various diabetes screening guidelines,
but to our knowledge, none has yet examined the 2015 USPSTF criteria. Detecting dysglycemia
is an increasingly important public health imperative, given rising rates of diabetes across all
population subgroups. Recent research demonstrating a higher prevalence of diabetes at youn-
ger ages and lower body weight [15], particularly among racial/ethnic minorities [16–18], sug-
gests that the USPSTF criteria may identify proportionately fewer cases of dysglycemia among
certain high-risk groups. The objective of our study was to evaluate the performance of the
2015 USPSTF screening criteria among US community health center patients. We hypothe-
sized that racial/ethnic minorities would be less likely to be detected by these screening criteria
yet more likely to develop dysglycemia over time.

 Methods
Ethics Statement
The research protocol was approved by each of the participating community health centers’
research evaluation boards and was deemed exempt from review by the Northwestern Univer-
sity Institutional Review Board.
Data Source and Participants
In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed longitudinal electronic health record (EHR)
data from a US network of publicly funded community health centers between 2008 and 2013.
This study is reported as per STROBE guidelines (S1 STROBE Checklist). EHR data from rou-
tine primary care encounters were collected retrospectively by Alliance of Chicago Commu-
nity Health Services (Alliance), a Health Center Controlled Network and member of the
Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN). The affiliated clinics offer compre-
hensive clinical services to vulnerable populations including large proportions of women and
racial/ethnic minorities [19]. Six community health centers in the CHARN network serving
patients in the American Midwest and Southwest participated in this study [20]. We used
structured query language to extract from a centralized data warehouse the following EHR
data on patients receiving primary care in these centers: age, sex, self-reported race/ethnicity,
insurance type, laboratory testing results, physical measurements (height, weight, and blood
pressure), medications ordered, comorbidities (coded according to the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9]) [21], and the date on which these data elements
were collected.
Adult patients who were at least 18 y old were identified in the EHR between January 2008
and December 2010 based on their first office visit during this time period, defined as the index
visit. Patients who had fewer than two subsequent office visits were excluded after examining
all face-to-face encounters with a licensed primary care provider. We also excluded those with
dysglycemia at baseline, determined by the following EHR criteria documented any time before
the end of the calendar year in which patients attended the index visit: (1) ICD-9 diagnosis
code for prediabetes or diabetes; (2) prescription order for any antidiabetic medication; and/or
(3) glycemic testing result consistent with dysglycemia (fasting glucose � 100 mg/dL [5.55
mmol/L], 2-h postload glucose �140 mg/dL [7.77 mmol/L], random glucose � 200 mg/dL
[11.10 mmol/L], or A1C � 5.7% [39 mmol/mol]). These patients were excluded because the
study’s primary outcome was incident dysglycemia during a 3-y follow-up period. In addition,
we excluded five subjects with unknown sex. The final study population included 50,515
patients, who were followed after the index visit for up to 3 y through December 2013. We
chose this duration of follow-up because it is the recommended time interval for dysglycemia
screening [14]. Each patient was observed for a single follow-up period and was analyzed only
once.
Measures and Definitions
Screening eligibility, diabetes risk factors, and other covariates.
According to the 2015
USPSTF criteria, we considered all patients who were aged 40 to 70 y old and overweight or
obese to be eligible for screening. In addition to age and body mass index (BMI), we analyzed
baseline data on each of the following diabetes risk factors as defined according to the Ameri-
can Diabetes Association (ADA): nonwhite race/ethnicity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, poly-
cystic ovary syndrome, history of gestational diabetes, and family history of diabetes [22]. The
ADA includes physical inactivity as a diabetes risk factor, which was not routinely collected in

 the EHR data source and therefore was not examined in this study. Race/ethnicity data were
derived from self-reports obtained upon patient registration in the participating community
health centers and used to create mutually exclusive categories. Nonwhite race and ethnicity
categories included in our analysis were Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Other. All patients report-
ing Hispanic/Latino ethnicity were categorized as Hispanic/Latino in the analysis. The Other
category comprised American Indians, Asians, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders,
biracial or multiracial individuals, and those with missing data for race/ethnicity. Definitions
for each risk factor were based on a combination of EHR data elements: ICD-9 diagnosis
codes, laboratory results, physical measurements, and medications prescribed (definitions pre-
sented in Table 1). We summed the number of diabetes risk factors, including age � 45 y [22]
and those mentioned above, to create an individual risk score. Sociodemographic variables
including sex and insurance status were also assessed at the index visit and examined as covari-
ates [23,24].
Receipt of diabetes screening and incident dysglycemia. Glycemic testing conducted
during routine clinical encounters is often called opportunistic diabetes screening. This
approach has proven effective for identifying undiagnosed dysglycemia in US practice-based
settings and has also been advocated as a case finding strategy in low- and middle-income
countries [25,26]. Following the current USPSTF guideline [14], we considered receiving at

 least one of the following glycemic tests during follow-up as screening for dysglycemia: fasting
glucose, 2-h postload glucose, and A1C. According to the ADA [22], we also considered the
results of random glucose tests, which may be more effective at detecting dysglycemia than
fasting glucose tests, as receipt of opportunistic screening [27].
The development of dysglycemia was the primary outcome, ascertained using a combina-
tion of screening laboratory results, ICD-9 diagnosis codes, and prescribed medications.
Patients with one of the following glycemic testing results were considered to have dysglycemia:
fasting glucose � 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L), 2-h postload glucose � 140 mg/dL (7.77 mmol/
L), or A1C � 5.7% (39 mmol/mol). Patients with random glucose � 200 mg/dL (11.10 mmol/
L) were classified as having diabetes and therefore included among those who developed dys-
glycemia [22]. A label of “fasting,” “random,” or “2-h postload” for all glucose results in the
EHR enabled laboratory definitions of the outcome, which was based on the first result
observed during the follow-up period. Establishing a diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes
requires confirmation by repeat testing, which was not assessed here. Dysglycemia was also
defined by documentation of diagnosis codes for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes during follow-
up. Patients with a new antidiabetic medication prescription were also considered to have dys-
glycemia. We classified patients who met any of the criteria described above as screening posi-
tive for dysglycemia.
Statistical Analysis
We used summary statistics to characterize the entire study cohort with respect to all covariates
at baseline. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association between diabetes screening
eligibility according to 2015 USPSTF criteria (eligible versus ineligible) and the following indi-
cators: (1) baseline characteristics, (2) receipt of screening during follow-up, and (3) develop-
ment of clinically detected dysglycemia. Using data on USPSTF eligibility and dysglycemia
incidence among patients who were screened during follow-up (n = 29,946), we assessed the
performance characteristics of the USPSTF criteria (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value [PPV], and negative predictive value [NPV]) based on available screening test results.
Estimation of these performance characteristics did not include those who were not screened
during follow-up, in whom the incidence of dysglycemia was unknown. We conducted strati-
fied analyses by race/ethnicity to examine the development of dysglycemia separately in these
groups. Also in the screened population, we estimated the odds of developing clinically
detected dysglycemia during follow-up using logistic regression adjusted for all the covariates,
in addition to community health center site. Participants with missing race/ethnicity data were
included in bivariate and multivariable analyses as part of the Other category. Those with miss-
ing data for insurance status were included in all analyses under a separate Missing category. In
a sensitivity analysis, we estimated the performance characteristics of the USPSTF criteria
including patients who also had undiagnosed dysglycemia at baseline, who would also be eligi-
ble for screening according to the recommendation. A p-value of <0.05 was considered signifi-
cant for all statistical testing. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina).
Our team designed the analysis plan for this study before receiving the data and made no
major departures from it. Table 1, presenting the criteria used to define our outcome and other
clinical covariates, was used by our co-authors at Alliance to extract the EHR data used in our
study. The age and insurance categories analyzed here represent the only departures from our
initial analysis plan. The analysis was originally planned using the following categories for age
and insurance status: 18–39, 40–70, and �71 y and Medicaid, Medicare, Private, Uninsured,
and Other, respectively.

 Results
Cohort Characteristics
The Fig 1 flow diagram displays the numbers of the total patient population (n = 112,662), the
patients excluded and reasons for their exclusion (n = 62,147), the participants comprising the
study sample (n = 50,515), and those analyzed (n = 50,515). The mean follow-up time was 1.9
y and the maximum was 3.0 y. At baseline, the patient cohort was predominantly less than 40 y
old (62.7%), overweight/obese (66.4%), nonwhite (77.3%), women (72.5%), and uninsured or
publicly insured (74.3%). There were missing data for race/ethnicity (n = 977, 1.9%) and insur-
ance status (n = 4,103, 8.1%), but not for other variables. Over 95% of the sample had at least
one risk factor for diabetes, and 25.1% met current USPSTF criteria for diabetes screening.
According to these criteria, all patients less than 40 y old or with a normal body weight would
have been ineligible for screening. In addition, the following patient characteristics were signifi-
cantly associated with being ineligible: nonwhite race/ethnicity, female sex, history of gesta-
tional diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome (Table 2).
Receipt of Screening and Development of Dysglycemia
Overall, 29,946 patients (59.3% of the total sample) underwent a screening test within 3 y of
the index visit. Screening was completed in 77.8% of patients who were eligible according to
Fig 1. Flow diagram.

 the 2015 USPSTF criteria and 53.1% of those who were not. Based on available test results, a
total of 8,478 patients developed dysglycemia during the follow-up period (5,960 with predia-
betes [70.3% of dysglycemia cases] and 2,518 with diabetes). The following proportion of dys-
glycemia cases were identified by each glycemic test: A1C (77.9%), fasting glucose (18.2%), 2-h
postload glucose (0.7%), and random glucose (3.1%). Only 45.0% of those who developed dys-
glycemia would have met current USPSTF criteria. Among the dysglycemia cases missed by
the USPSTF criteria, 77.7% were less than 40 y old and 29.3% had a normal body weight. The

 yield of screening for detecting dysglycemia was 38.8% among those who were eligible and
23.2% among those who were not (Table 3). Using data from all patients who had a screening
test during the follow-up period, the 2015 USPSTF criteria had the following test performance
characteristics (95% CI) for identifying dysglycemia: sensitivity 45.0% (43.9%–46.1%), specific-
ity 71.9% (71.3%–72.5%), PPV 38.8% (37.8%–39.7%), and NPV 76.8% (76.2%–77.4%). A sensi-
tivity analysis including individuals who had undiagnosed dysglycemia at baseline did not
substantively impact the reported USPSTF performance characteristics.

 Screening Eligibility, Receipt, and Development of Dysglycemia by
Race/Ethnicity
Racial/ethnic minorities were significantly less likely to be eligible for screening based on the
USPSTF recommendation than were whites, with the greatest disparity occurring among His-
panics/Latinos (Table 2). A higher proportion of racial/ethnic minorities who were screened
developed clinically detected dysglycemia during the follow-up period (Fig 2). This was sup-
ported by multivariable logistic regression analysis showing higher odds of dysglycemia among
all racial/ethnic minority groups compared to whites (odds ratio [95% CI] for Blacks 1.24 [95%
CI, 1.09–1.40]; Hispanics 1.46 [95% CI, 1.30–1.64]; and Other 1.33 [95% CI, 1.16–1.54])
(Table 4). In addition, dysglycemia cases among minority patients were less likely to be identi-
fied by the USPSTF screening criteria (i.e., lower sensitivity) than were cases among whites.
The sensitivity (95% CI) of the criteria was 54.5% (52.0%–57.1%) in whites, 50.3% (48.4%–
52.1%) in Blacks, 42.0% (37.7%–46.2%) in Other, and 37.7% (36.1%–39.2%) in Hispanics/

greater proportion of patients who developed dysglycemia at a normal weight and ages less
than 40 within these groups, relative to whites (Table 5).
Discussion
Using longitudinal data from US community health center patients, we report eligibility for
diabetes screening according to the 2015 USPSTF criteria, as well as receipt of screening and
positive test results within a 3-y follow-up period. Overall, one-quarter of patients were eligible
for screening, and almost 60% received a screening test during follow-up. Less than half of the
patients who developed dysglycemia would have been eligible for screening according to cur-
rent USPSTF criteria. Our findings also suggest that certain population groups that are at high
risk for developing dysglycemia are more likely to be missed when using these criteria, particu-
larly racial/ethnic minorities.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine USPSTF diabetes screening criteria
released in October 2015. Using US population-based data in which all participants received
glycemic testing, previous analyses tested the detection of dysglycemia according to a prior
2008 USPSTF recommendation to screen adults with hypertension. One study reported that
28.2% of US adults aged 18 y or older had hypertension and were therefore eligible to be
screened according to the 2008 recommendation [28]. Screening adults based on hypertension
alone was estimated to identify 53% of individuals with diabetes and 31% of those with predia-
betes [29]. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting dysglycemia by the previous screening crite-
rion (blood pressure >135/80 mmHg) were 40.6%–44.4% and 74.8%–78.0%, respectively
[30,31]. Despite studying different screening criteria in nationally representative populations,
these analyses reported remarkably similar performance characteristics to those we report in a
clinic-based sample. Alternate diabetes screening criteria based on a greater number of risk fac-
tors generally found higher sensitivity and lower specificity than the 2008 USPSTF recommen-
dation [29,31,32].
Our study found comparable rates of opportunistic screening with previous reports from
US primary care settings [32–34]. Studies analyzing US survey data have found a lower preva-
lence of diabetes screening [31,35]. The discrepancy between estimates derived from clinical

 cohorts and population-based studies likely reflects an increased probability of those receiving
health care to be screened and recall bias from using self-reported data to ascertain this out-
come. We found a higher prevalence of screening in patients who would have been eligible
based on the current USPSTF criteria, compared to those who would not be eligible. Screening
was also more common among patients with other diabetes risk factors, except for gestational
diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. Because rare conditions are infrequently captured in
EHR data [36], our screening estimates for these patients may be biased. Opportunistic screen-
ing in patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia may reflect monitoring of electrolytes,
renal function, and liver function among those taking medication.
While diabetes screening occurred in approximately half of the patients who would not be
eligible according to the 2015 USPSTF recommendation, this practice may change after imple-
mentation of the new screening criteria. Previous studies have reported good adherence to
other USPSTF screening recommendations [37–40], which suggests that dysglycemia screen-
ing may occur less frequently among ineligible patients in the future. The lack of mandated
insurance coverage for screening among ineligible patients in the US may also result in lower
screening rates than those observed here [13]. This may be especially true in safety-net settings
like those we studied, where patients are less able to afford out-of-pocket medical expenses
[41].
Our sample presents a unique opportunity to investigate demographic groups that may be
missed by the 2015 USPSTF screening criteria, given the proportion of young and lean patients
who developed dysglycemia. We found that racial/ethnic minorities were less likely than whites
to be eligible for dysglycemia screening. Similarly, one population-based study found that
screening eligibility based on age �45 y was lower among Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos com-
pared to whites [42]. Nonwhites in our study had a higher risk of developing dysglycemia than
whites, a finding that is well established in the epidemiologic literature. We found that dysgly-
cemia develops at younger ages and lower body weight in racial/ethnic minority groups, which
is supported by a recent body of research [16–18]. In addition, the proportion of incident dys-
glycemia cases detected by the USPSTF criteria was lower among all racial/ethnic groups than
among whites. Taken together, these observations raise concern that the current USPSTF
screening criteria may postpone a diagnosis of dysglycemia in racial/ethnic minorities, which
could potentially delay interventions to prevent or treat diabetes in these groups. Prospective
studies in which all individuals receive screening are needed to further investigate the perfor-
mance of these criteria and to assess whether following them contributes to diabetes-related
disparities [43]. In contrast to the current USPSTF screening criteria, other diabetes screening
guidelines include nonwhite race/ethnicity as a risk factor that warrants screening independent
of age or weight [22,44,45].
Because prediabetes represented the majority of incident dysglycemia cases, our findings
have implications for diabetes prevention among disadvantaged US adults. The low sensitivity
of current USPSTF screening criteria reported here could result in missed opportunities to
offer intensive lifestyle interventions or metformin. Adults with prediabetes who are missed by
these screening criteria will also not learn that they have the condition, which may impact their
efforts to prevent diabetes. One recent study found that adults who were aware of having predi-
abetes were more than twice as likely as those who were not to engage in meeting evidence-
based lifestyle goals [46]. Without receiving any intervention to lower their diabetes risk,
patients with prediabetes who are not detected by the USPSTF screening criteria may develop
diabetes sooner and have a longer period of exposure for developing complications. Future
research should investigate the impact of screening positive for prediabetes on the adoption of
diabetes prevention treatments and resulting metabolic outcomes.

 Strengths of the current study include its timeliness given the recent release of the 2015
USPSTF screening recommendation, large sample size, and use of longitudinal clinical data
from an understudied population in the US. The sociodemographic characteristics of our
cohort were similar to those reported among over 15 million adult patients served in similar
community health centers [19]. While these community health centers are the primary source
of outpatient care for immigrants living in the US [47]—many of whom are racial/ethnic
minorities—the performance of these diabetes screening criteria may differ in their countries
of origin. However, diabetes also develops at young ages and lean body weight among adults in
Latin America, Africa, and Asia [48–52]. This suggests that screening programs targeting mid-
dle-aged and overweight/obese adults may also have low sensitivity for detecting dysglycemia
in these regions [53].
Our analysis has the following limitations. We did not have individual-level data for patients
who were excluded because they had fewer than two follow-up visits, which precluded analysis
of differences between the study sample and the larger patient population from which it was
drawn. We were only able to examine the effectiveness of current USPSTF screening criteria
among patients who had available test results or evidence of a new diagnosis code or treatment,
which were required to ascertain whether patients developed dysglycemia during follow-up.
Therefore, the performance characteristics reported here (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and
NPV) may differ from those in the entire patient sample because of unobserved factors associ-
ated with being screened. However, the findings from this sample of tested patients are relevant
to practicing clinicians, who similarly lack data on glycemic status among patients without
available test results. In addition, one main contribution of our study is identifying patient
characteristics associated with screening eligibility, which were derived from the entire study
sample. These findings suggest how the criteria may perform if implemented with fidelity in a
similar patient population. Because of differences between the current sample and patients
who receive primary care in other settings, our findings may have limited generalizability out-
side of safety-net clinics like the ones studied here.
The ascertainment of dysglycemia was based on a single glycemic test result. The intraindi-
vidual variation observed with these tests may have resulted in misclassification of cases. How-
ever, this limitation did not likely have a large impact on our findings because the two tests
with the least variability (A1C [coefficient of variation <1%] and fasting glucose [coefficient of
variation 5.7%]) were used to ascertain the outcome in 96.1% of cases [54]. Two-hour postload
glucose, which has the greatest intraindividual variability (coefficient of variation 16.7%), was
used to define dysglycemia in only 0.7% of cases [54]. Because the current USPSTF criteria
were not recommended during the 2008–2013 study period, we could not investigate how this
guideline influenced providers’ screening behavior.
Conclusions and Implications
Our findings suggest that the 2015 USPSTF screening recommendation may identify approxi-
mately half of US community health center patients with undiagnosed prediabetes and diabe-
tes. Future studies are needed to estimate the performance of these screening criteria in
population-based samples in which all individuals are screened. EHR data can enable prag-
matic identification of patients who are eligible for diabetes screening or evidence-based inter-
ventions to prevent or treat diabetes. For those who have undiagnosed dysglycemia and are not
detected by the USPSTF screening criteria, such interventions may be delayed. Also concerning
is the fact that certain high-risk groups who develop dysglycemia at younger ages and lower
body weight may be missed by following this screening recommendation, most notably racial/
ethnic minorities. Our findings suggest that primary care providers should consider screening

 patients from racial/ethnic minority groups before the age and weight ranges recommended by
the USPSTF. Such a practice could enable earlier management of dysglycemia in these high-
risk groups but may impose cost sharing on patients.
