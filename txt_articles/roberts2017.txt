Young people in and leaving state care are more likely than the general population to become parents at a young
age. Relatively little is known about the experiences and progress of care leaver parents and their children, but
emerging evidence suggests an increased risk of intergenerational state intervention. Drawing on data from the
Wales Adoption Study, this paper examines the prevalence and profiles of care leavers amongst birth parents
whose children were placed for adoption. Findings showed that more than a quarter (27%) of birth mothers and
a fifth (19%) of birth fathers with children placed for adoption were themselves care leavers. There were no
significant differences between care leaver and non-care leaver birth parents in terms of involvement in crime or
substance misuse, but carer leaver birth parents were distinguishable from other birth parents by their own
experiences of abuse and neglect. Care leaver birth mothers were also more likely than their non-care leaver
counterparts to have diagnosed mental health problems and were less likely to appeal the adoption plan. The
profiles of children placed for adoption between care leaver and non-care leaver birth parents were similar. The
findings presented in this paper strengthen the moral imperative to address the over-representation of care
leavers amongst birth parents whose children are placed for adoption. There is an urgent need to revise how
children and young people in state care are prepared for parenthood and supported as parents.
1. Introduction
Evidence suggests that young people in and leaving state care are
more likely than the general population to become parents at a young
age (Svoboda, Shaw, Barth, & Bright, 2012). Whilst often based on non-
representative samples of varying size, the findings from studies in the
UK and elsewhere that focus on pregnancy and parenthood whilst in
care, and/or the initial years after leaving care, remain consistent.
(Biehal & Wade,
1996;
Cashmore & Paxman,
1996;

Byford, Weatherly, & Lee, 2006; Del Valle, Bravo, Alvarez, & Fernanz,
2008; Vinnerljung & Sallnäs, 2008; Roca, García, Biarnés, & Rodríguez,
2009; Oshima, Narendorf, & McMillen, 2013; Craine et al., 2014; King,
Putnam-Hornstein, Cederbaum, & Needell, 2014; Courtney et al., 2011).
There is less consensus as to why young people with experience of
state care are more likely than their peers to enter parenthood early. It
may be a positive choice for some, who consider it an opportunity
imbued with stability, purpose and love (Cashmore & Paxman, 2007;
Haydon, 2003; Roca et al., 2009). However, the higher incidence of
early pregnancy and parenthood has also been related to experiences
during and prior to being cared for by the state. For example, an ana-
lysis of adolescent births in California showed that 9.7% of parents had
previously spent time in foster care, but 44.9% of the total sample had
been reported as victims of abuse in the preceding decade (Putnam-
Hornstein, Cederbaum, King, Cleveland, & Needell, 2013). In this way,
the care system may be a protective factor for some young people
(Dworsky & Courtney, 2010), a suggestion supported by findings of a
US study which noted a ‘graded relationship’ between length of time in
foster care and birth rate, in which girls were more likely to give birth
the less time they had been in care (King et al., 2014). Yet in contrast,
structured interviews with 325 US care leavers, showed few factors
were significant and “simply being in the foster care system is a sig-
nificant risk factor for pregnancy in and of itself.” (Oshima, Narendorf,
and McMillen, 2013: 1763). Adding to the complexity, the type of
placement experienced by a young person has been highlighted as an
important consideration, with higher incidences of pregnancy asso-
ciated with kinship care and residential care (Sakai, Lin, & Flores, 2011;
Svoboda et al., 2012). Likewise, Wade (2008) found parents leaving
state care in England were more likely than their non-parenting coun-
terparts to have experienced placement instability, been involved in
offending and substance misuse, or run away frequently whilst looked
after.
The evidence base is also under-developed in relation to what

 happens after young people who have been looked after by the state
become parents. This includes the outcomes for young people who
enter parenthood whilst in or officially leaving state care, as well as for
those who become parents at a later age. Bublitz et al. (2014) in-
vestigated the relationship between maternal childhood experience of
adoption or foster care and pre-term birth. Mothers with prior experi-
ence of state care were found to be four times as likely to give birth
prematurely (prior to 37 weeks gestation). Whilst acknowledging the
need for further research, the authors surmise that the findings may be
related to difficulties with biopsychosocial regulation resulting from
separation or trauma. In addition, findings from the Millennium Cohort
Study suggest that women with experience of care can “carry social
disadvantage into motherhood”, and are more likely to have a baby of
low birth weight, be a single parent and experience symptoms of de-
pression (Botchway et al. 2015:1).
Third sector organisations in Wales have collectively released a
statement of concern in respect of discrimination and support available
to parents in and leaving left state care (Voices from Care, NYAS,
Family Rights Group, Tros Gynnal Plant, 2016). The disparity between
the support needs of care-experienced parents and the available support
provision has been noted (Rutman, Strega, Callahan, & Dominelli,
2002) as has a dearth of evidence capable of informing the development
of effective interventions for this population (Fallon & Broadhurst,
2015). Such factors are compounded by research findings related to the
relationships between professionals and parents with experience of
state care. For example, Rutman et al. (2002) highlighted the potential
for professionals to perceive intergenerational cycles of care as ‘in-
evitable’ whilst Chase, Maxwell, Knight, and Aggleton, (2006) found
parents felt unhelpfully monitored rather than supported.
The inter-generational continuity of state intervention within fa-
milies has attracted some research interest (Bartlett & Easterbrooks,
2012; Putnam-Hornstein et al., 2013; Dworsky, 2015). In his review of
the literature, Mendes' (2009) noted that studies often made only
fleeting references to rates of child protection intervention and results
were frequently based on small sample sizes. Nevertheless, he con-
cluded that “care leavers who became teenage parents are more likely
than the general population to come to the attention of child protection
authorities” (2009:14). In 2015, the Centre for Social Justice submitted
freedom of information requests to local authorities in England. They
highlighted a “worrying number of care leavers' children … being taken
into care” with “at least one in 10 young care leavers aged 16–21 … hav
[ing] had a child taken into care in the last year” (Centre for Social
Justice, 2015: 72). Such concern is supported by evidence from a
longitudinal study of young people leaving care across three US states
in which 10% of mothers, identified at age 21, reported as living apart
from at least one biological child (Courtney et al., 2007). This figure
increased to 17% by age 23/24 (Courtney, Dworsky, Lee, & Raap,
2009), and to 19% by age 25/26 (Courtney et al., 2011). Similarly,
findings from a large cohort study in the US (742 care leaver parents
aged between 20 and 49) revealed that 9% reported having a child in
foster care, compared to a foster care rate of 1.1% in the general po-
pulation (Foster Jackson, Beadnell, & Pecora, 2015). Broadhurst and
Mason (2013) have also raised concern about the over-representation of
care-experienced parents in their English sample of women who have
been subject to repeat care proceedings. Yet despite these insights,
significant gaps in knowledge remain in respect of the outcomes for
families where one or both parents has experience of state care. This
includes a lack of evidence about the numbers of parents who retain
care of their children and parent autonomously or with voluntary
support, and the numbers who are subject to compulsory state inter-
vention, including those who have children who become ‘looked after’
and those whose children go on to be adopted. Adoption is a particu-
larly salient consideration, given that the intervention permanently
severs the legal ties between a child and their birth family.
1.1. Adoption outcomes for children born to care leavers in Wales
The paper draws on data from the Wales Adoption Study to establish
how many of the children placed for adoption in the study time period
had birth parents who were care leavers. Birth mothers and fathers
were identified as care leavers if they were recorded as ‘looked after’ as
they turned sixteen in the Child Assessment Reports for Adoption
(CARA) (see Strengths and Limitations for further discussion). The
profiles of birth parents identified as care leavers (hereto referred to as
care leaver parents) were compared with those of other birth parents,
and the profiles of children born to care leaver parents were compared
with those of other children placed for adoption. The purpose of this
analysis was to see what, if any, insights the data provides in terms of
the needs of care leaver parents and their children, social work practice
for this group and/or the impact of state care.
2. Method
2.1. Sample
The data derives from the Wales Adoption Study, a national re-
search study that used a mixed-methods approach to examine the
characteristics and experiences of a sample of children recently placed
for adoption in Wales, to consider the early support needs of adoptive
families into which these children were placed, and to better under-
stand what helps these families to flourish. Detailed information about
this mixed methods study can be found elsewhere (Anthony et al.,
2016).
2.2. Ethical considerations
Ethical permission for the Wales Adoption Study was granted by the
School of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee and School of
Psychology at Cardiff University. The university is registered with the
Information Commissioner as a Data Controller, to process personal
data for research purposes. In addition, permission from the Welsh
Government was obtained to access the local authority data. Senior
Adoption managers were also consulted and their approval obtained. A
multi-disciplinary advisory group for the study provided valuable gui-
dance for developing best practice with respect to the ethics pertaining
to safeguarding and data protection.
2.3. Retrieval of social work records
The sample comprised the records of all children placed for adop-
tion by every local authority (LA) in Wales between 01 July 2014 and
31 July 2015. Three hundred and seventy four CARA records were
reviewed. The template for the CARA was developed by BAAF Cymru,
in response to the Adoption Agencies (Wales) Regulations 2005, which
set out the information that local authorities must include when re-
porting on children put forward for adoption. More than 250 discrete
pieces of information were sought from each CARA record. The CARAs
report on children's experiences and needs within the domains of
health, education, emotional/behavioural development, self-care skills,
identity, family and social presentation. They also provide a record of
the characteristics and experiences of the children's birth parents, the
given reasons children were placed for adoption and the actions taken
by the LA. CARAs are completed by social workers, who record in-
formation based on their work with the birth parents, contact with
foster carers, liaison with other professionals (such as police, health
visitors and medical officers) and reviews of historical social services
records. Under the Adoption Agencies (Wales) Regulations 2005,
adoptive parents should be provided with the CARA when matched
with a child, so that they have detailed information about the child and
their pre adoption experiences.
About two-thirds of the CARAs reviewed were in electronic format,
L. Roberts et al.

 whilst the remainder were reviewed from a hard copy of the report. The
researchers worked on site at the LA offices, and to avoid errors in
copying, entered data directly into an SPSS database. More than 250
discrete pieces of information were sought from each CARA record. As
well as providing valuable information about the characteristics, needs
and experiences of all children placed for adoption by every LA in
Wales over a 13 month period, the information extracted from the
CARAs was also used to check the extent to which the children in those
adoptive families who participated in other strands of the study (the
questionnaires and interview work), were representative of all children
placed for adoption in Wales during the study period. The CARA data
forms the basis for the present study.
2.4. Measures
A number of theoretically meaningful adverse childhood and adult
experiences were included as part of the analysis to examine potential
associations between care leaver status and the profile of birth parents.
Children's characteristics were coded as ‘yes’/present (1) and ‘no’/
absent (0). These included developmental delay (not achieved devel-
opmental milestones within the normal age range in one or more do-
mains: physical, language, cognitive, social and emotional); attachment
difficulties (concerns recorded by child social worker regarding the
child's attachment behaviour), learning difficulties and low birth
weight (below 2.5 kg).
Parents' childhood experiences of physical abuse, emotional abuse,
sexual abuse and neglect were coded as present (1) or absent (0) using
the CARA. Birth mother's experience of domestic violence was coded as
present (1) or absent (0) as was each parent's experience of mental
illness. The inclusion of the variable for ‘mental illness’ was not
straightforward. It was not always possible to discern from the CARAs
whether or not birth parents had a clinical diagnosis for symptoms of
anxiety and/or depression. Very many birth mothers (and some fathers)
were simply described in the CARA as depressed or anxious, others
were not described in this way but were reported to be taking pre-
scribed anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication. The ambiguity
around whether or not a personality disorder should be classed as a
mental illness (Kendell, 2002), further complicated identification of the
variable parameters. We initially created a broad yes/no variable for
either birth parent having any reported mental health problem or
personality disorder. The vast majority of parents coded positively for
this variable. Due to the ambiguity in confirming a diagnosis of anxiety
and/or depression and because of the very many parents who were
identified with a mental health problem of any nature when anxiety/
depressive conditions were included, a second yes/no variable was
created for either birth parent having a diagnosed mental illness or
personality disorder (excluding anxiety and/or depression). It was this
second variable that was used in the analysis.
A parental decision to appeal the order to place for adoption was
recorded as ‘Yes’ (1) or ‘No’ (0). Social workers would sometimes record
suspected childhood abuse, domestic violence, and mental illness as
‘suspected’. We ran analyses including these cases as a ‘yes’/‘present’
and then excluded them to provide a more stringent test of association.
Unless otherwise stated, we treated suspected cases as a ‘yes’/‘present’
because of the challenges for social workers of evidencing notoriously
under-reported domestic events (including parent-to-child and inter-
adult violence/abuse) in the absence of a police record.
Regular meetings were held between the researchers reviewing the
case files to maintain a common understanding of, and consistent ap-
proach to coding. The parameters of most variables were unambiguous.
Those that had the potential to be coded more subjectively (for ex-
ample, attachment difficulties) were thoroughly discussed. It was
agreed that team members would not make judgements about the ex-
istence of factors, based on an interpretation of what a social work
report might suggest. Variables were recorded as present only when
they were explicitly documented.
2.5. Statistical analysis
t-Test and chi-square analysis was conducted using SPSS Version
20.0.
3. Results
Of the 374 social work (Child Adoption Records; CARA) files re-
viewed for Welsh children placed for adoption during the study period,
the care history for 356 birth mothers and 240 birth fathers was re-
corded. Of these, 27% (n = 96) of birth mothers and 19% (n = 45) of
birth fathers were identified as care leavers. Both birth parents were
recorded as care leavers for twenty three children, representing 6% of
the reviewed child adoption records. Six birth mothers who were care
leavers and 14 birth mothers who were not carer leavers, were under
the age of 18 when their child was born. There were no children born to
mothers in care and under the age of 16. Table 1 presents the

 frequencies and percentages by care leaver status for the primary study
variables.
3.1. Child characteristics
Just over half (n = 205; 55%) of children in the study were male;
the majority were white British (n = 358; 96%). Most children had no
recorded religious orientation; those that did were mainly identified as
Christian. English was the first language for nearly all the children in
the study. The majority of children had been removed from their birth
parent/s just the once, but a small number (n = 28, 8%) had experi-
enced more than one care episode, by having been removed, returned
home then removed again. In these instances the date of the child's last
entry to care was used for calculation purposes. The average age of
children on entry into care was one year and two months (range
0 months to 6½ years). Just over two fifths (n = 153; 41%) of the
children entered care at, or shortly after birth (within four weeks),
whilst just 5% did so after the age of four (n = 20). A third (n = 122;
33%) of all children in the sample were placed for adoption as part of a
sibling group. The average (mean) number of days between entry into
care and adoptive placement was 528 days; the median was 434 days
(range 129 to 2662 days).
3.2. Birth parent characteristics and experiences
Table 2 presents the results of t-test comparisons of care leavers
compared to non-care leavers. There was no difference between the
care leaver and non-care leaver group in age when the child placed for
adoption was born. For fathers, but not mothers, the time the child
spent with the parent before entering care was shorter for care leavers
compared to non-care leavers (see Table 2). No association was iden-
tified between fathers' care leaver status and employment status or
receipt of benefits. An association was identified between mothers' care
leaver status and unemployment (χ2 = 9.23, p < 0.05; care leavers
84.4% unemployed, non-care leavers 90.7% unemployed) but not with
the receipt of benefits (χ2 = 2.86, p > 0.05; care leavers 75% in re-
ceipt, non-care leavers 91% in receipt). No association was found be-
tween fathers' care leaver status and unemployment (χ2 = 4.50) or
receipt of benefits (χ2 = 1.98).
Associations were identified between care leaver status and birth
parent experiences of childhood abuse and exposure to violence, in-
cluding childhood physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, ex-
posure to domestic violence in childhood (mothers only) and neglect
(see Table 3). The odds ratios indicated that birth mothers who were
care leavers were two to five times more likely to have experienced
childhood abuse and neglect whilst birth fathers who were care leavers
were three to seven times more likely to have experienced these indices
of childhood adversity. There was a relationship between a record of
mothers' mental illness and care leaver status but not for fathers. No
relationship was found between mothers and fathers' care leaver status
and involvement in crime, substance misuse or alcohol abuse.
Table 3 shows that no relationship was identified between social
worker records regarding child characteristics (low birth weight,
learning
difficulties,
developmental
concerns,
and
attachment
difficulties) and birth parent care leaver status, although cell sizes were
too small to generate some estimates.
Of nine mothers who were recorded in the Child Adoption Record as
having voluntarily relinquished their children adoption with no social
services involvement, three were care leavers. An association was
identified between birth mother care leaver status and a parent ap-
pealing the decision to place the child for adoption, whereby the fre-
quency of appeals was lower for care leavers. Although cell sizes were
too small to make this estimation for fathers, an equivalent percentage
of parents appealed the decision in each group (i.e. 9% of parents where
mother was a care leaver mothers and 9% of parents where father was
identified as a care leaver appealed compared with 20% and 18% of
non-care leaver birth mothers and birth fathers, respectively).
4. Discussion
The aim of this paper was to make a contribution to the under-
developed evidence base relating to the experiences of care leavers who
become parents. The findings provide valuable insights into the char-
acteristics and needs of care leaver parents whose children are placed
for adoption, and raise important questions about social work practice
in respect of this group. The findings in this paper provide some vali-
dation for concerns raised by third sector organisations in Wales re-
garding the negative trajectories for care leavers as they transition to
parenthood (Voices from Care, NYAS, FRG, Tros Gynnal Plant, 2016).
With < 1% of children in state care in Wales at any given period (Welsh
Government, 2016), it is concerning that care leavers represented over
a quarter of birth mothers and almost a fifth of birth fathers within the
sample of birth parents whose children were being adopted.
Comparisons of birth parent profiles revealed that carer leavers
were distinguishable from other birth parents by their own childhood
experiences of abuse and neglect. This was perhaps is to be expected
considering the need for care leaver parents to have been looked after
the state. In addition, care leaver birth mothers were statistically more
likely to suffer from mental illness. Aside from these factors, the profiles
of care leaver and non-care leaver birth parents and their children were
largely comparable. Evidence suggests that young people in and leaving
state care are more likely than the general population to experience
early parenthood, and endure poorer outcomes in areas such as health
and well-being, homelessness, involvement in the criminal justice
system and education, training and employment (e.g. Svoboda et al.,
2012; Courtney et al., 2011; Dixon et al., 2006; Mannay et al., 2015;
Stein and Munro 2008; Ministry of Justice, 2012). However, the find-
ings of this study showed care leaver parents to be of similar age to
other birth parents and no more likely to have problematic behaviours
in respect of substance misuse, alcohol dependency or criminal beha-
viour. Analysis of educational achievement, employment and receipt of
welfare benefits also indicated few associations. Similarly, children
born to care leaver parents were no more likely than other children
within the cohort to have been subject to abuse or neglect. The groups
also appeared comparable in respect of birth weight, learning difficul-
ties, development concerns and recorded attachment difficulties.
Such comparability is likely explained by the sample characteristics.

 and subsequently being placed for adoption. As such, the sample
comprises parents with the most extreme and intractable difficulties
and sizable proportions of mothers and fathers from both care leaver
and non-care leaver groups were recorded as having problematic be-
haviours or difficulties, such as substance misuse, involvement in
criminal activity, mental illness and unemployment. Considered in this
way, the analysis did not find care leaver parents to be more vulnerable
when compared to the group of vulnerable parents, who were not care
leavers. Notably, two thirds (67%) of birth mothers in the total sample
had been known to Children's Services when younger. Some of these
mothers, although not in care as they turned the age of sixteen, had a
history of being looked after by the state in earlier childhood. Similarly,
whilst prevalence of abuse or neglect and exposure to domestic violence
was high for all children within the cohort, as a group, children born to
care leaver parents did not present as statistically more likely to have
had suffered such experiences or have difficulties in respect of learning
and attachment (pre-adoptive placement).
The comparable characteristics of birth parents and children placed
for adoption suggests some parity in social work practice. With the
exception of mental ill health for care leaver birth mothers, care leaver
parents did not present as having more or less needs in relation to other
birth parents and the findings of this study did not uncover significant
practice differences in relation to age of removal of children from care
leavers or age at adoption. This provides some evidence to dispel
concerns regarding the potential for social workers to discriminate
against care leavers on the basis of care history. Yet despite this positive
inference, some additional information is noteworthy and warrants
further investigation. Among the 96 women care leavers, the CARA
records suggest that for about a third of the mothers (n = 19) the
adoption was in respect of their first child; of which over half of the
children were placed at birth (58%). For non-care leaver birth parents,
it was their first child for 51 of the 278 mothers (18%). This disparity
raises questions about the support and opportunities provided to care
leavers when they experience parenthood. With the state as parent, it is
of concern that sizeable proportions of care leaver mothers are con-
sidered incapable as new parents. This may reflect inadequate pre-
paratory and supportive measures in respect of parenthood for care
leavers or may be indicative of findings by Rutman et al. (2002) which
suggest professionals' can perceive intergenerational cycles of state care
as ‘inevitable’. In addition, it is noteworthy that non-care leaver mo-
thers were statistically more likely to appeal the adoption orders than
care leaver mothers. This may indicate that care leaver parents were
more accepting of their inability to maintain care for their children
and/or more likely to agree that adoption offered the best outcome for
their children. Alternatively, care leaver parents may have limited
resources to secure the necessary legal support to oppose local authority
plans. Qualitative research also highlights the potential for care leaver
parents to have fractious relationships with social workers and to feel
powerless against the ‘system’ (Rutman et al., 2002; Chase et al., 2006;
Roberts, 2016). As such, care leaver parents may have been less likely
to appeal the adoption orders because they perceived their actions as
futile and/or may have lacked the necessary psychological and practical
resources to pursue an appeal. Viewed in this way, continued attention
is needed regarding the relationship care leavers have with the state as
parent, as well as examinations of social work practice with care leaver
parents.
5. Strengths and limitations
A strength of the data presented in this analysis was the use of in-
formation derived from Child Adoption Records completed by social
work professionals. Social workers complete these records, making re-
ference to several sources of information, including official doc-
umentation (e.g. police incident data). This adds to our confidence that
the information is evidence based and less prone to problems of recall
or rater bias. However, the possibility of recording imprecise or in-
complete information is acknowledged. Quinton (2012) and Farmer
and Dance (2015) observe the potential for missing or inaccurate in-
formation within case file records, which rely on social workers making
sense of complex information that may not be within their field of ex-
pertise. This is particularly pertinent in respect of our efforts to identify
birth parents who were care leavers. In our study, there were instances
of missing data, particularly for birth fathers' care histories (36%
missing). It should be noted that our approach to defining birth parents
as care leavers (birth parents recorded as ‘looked after’ as they turned
sixteen) was an attempt to make positive use of the data we had
available and provide some meaningful comparison. However it is re-
cognised that the findings would have been strengthened had there
been greater consistency in reporting birth parents' care histories and
legal status. Moreover, ‘care leaver’ is a generic term and it is ac-
knowledged that experiences prior and during state care, as well as the
age of entry and length of stay, will likely be highly variable. Therefore,
future studies would benefit from more nuanced consideration of in-
dividual care histories.
Finally, adoption was the outcome experienced by all children
within the sample. As such, the analysis can only make a contribution to
what is known about a particular sub-set of care leaver parents: parents
whose child goes on to be adopted. In addition, data analysis was
constrained by the relatively small sample size available across a large
number of study variables. Process-oriented research is required that

6. Conclusion
In conclusion, proponents of adoption may argue that regardless of
parents' care histories, for families with significant and entrenched
needs, adoption provides children with the best chance of permanence
and stability. It is not the intent of this paper to debate the merits of
adoption for children or to make suggestions about which families, in
which circumstances, adoption or family support is appropriate. The
vulnerabilities and challenges facing birth parents within this sample,
including those who were care leavers and those who were not, is ac-
knowledged. Nevertheless, it is of concern that sizable proportions of
parents within this study, subject to the most drastic form of state in-
tervention in respect of family life, had themselves been parented by
the state. During their childhoods, they were visible to professionals;
their vulnerabilities, histories and needs were known. Yet it would
appear there were missed opportunities whilst in state care and/or
during the process of leaving care, to positively influence the trajec-
tories of these individuals. The outcomes for care leavers in this study
suggest that state care was ineffective in supporting young people to
overcome difficulties or to help break cycles of family separation. We
argue that there is a moral imperative to seek to address these poor
outcomes for care leaver parents and an urgent need to revise how
children and young people in state care are both prepared for future
parenthood and supported as parents.
Aside from adoption, the Welsh Government has made explicit its
policy commitment to reduce the number of children in state care
(Welsh Government, 2011; Drakeford, 2015). Our findings suggest that
care leavers would be a key group to target as part of an effort to break
the intergenerational cycle of state care. The children of care leaver
mothers suffering from mental illness appear particularly vulnerable to
care proceedings that culminate in adoption.
