Abstract
Background: Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug. In the general population, its use has been linked to
a heightened propensity for suicidal behavior (SB). We hypothesize that this association varies in patients with psychiatric
disorders. SB is known to vary by sex and therefore an investigation of cannabis’ association with SB must consider sex
differences. The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between cannabis use and suicide attempts in men
and women with psychiatric disorders.
Methods: We merged data collected for two studies based in Ontario, Canada (n = 985). We employed a multivariable
logistic regression to assess the association between cannabis use and suicide attempts in men and women with
psychiatric disorders.
Results: We analyzed data from 465 men and 444 women. Amongst these, 112 men and 158 women had attempted
suicide. The average age of our participants was 40 years (standard deviation (SD) 12.4). We found no significant
association between suicide attempts and cannabis use in men (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81,
2.22, p = 0.260) or women (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.61, 1.54, p = 0.884). In a sensitivity analysis using a sample of patients with
substance use disorder only, the heaviness of cannabis use was associated with small but significant association with SB
in men (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01, 1.05, p = 0.007).
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that there is no association between cannabis use and suicidal behavior in men or
women with psychiatric disorders unlike what was reported for the general population, though the heaviness of cannabis
use may have an effect in men. The impact of cannabis use in psychiatric disorders needs ongoing examination in light
of its common use, impending legalization with expected increased access and the uncertainty about cannabis’ effects
on prognosis of psychiatric disorders. In addition, research should continue to investigate modifiable risk factors of SB in
this population of which cannabis is not a significant factor based on this study.

 Background
Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance
worldwide, and its consumption is only expected to in-
crease as more jurisdictions, including Canada, legalize rec-
reational use [1–4]. While this legislation may serve to
lower societal costs associated with criminal penalties, the
increased consumption of cannabis will likely lead to an in-
creased prevalence of its various detrimental consequences
on memory, judgment, cognition, and mental health [3–5].
Cannabis use has consistently been shown to be associ-
ated with a heightened propensity for suicidal behavior (SB)
in the general population [6–9]. A twin study, for instance,
revealed that amongst a sample of 277 same-sex twin pairs,
cannabis users were 2.9 times more likely to attempt sui-
cide than their non-cannabis-dependent co-twin.[6]. A pro-
spective cohort study also found a robust association
between regular cannabis use and suicide attempt after
adjusting for important cofounders (odds ratio (OR) =
2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 6.1) [9].
However, the majority of the studies investigating the
aforementioned association included general population
cohorts and limited characterization of psychopathology
in the participants being studied. Given the high preva-
lence of cannabis use in patients with psychiatric
disorders and the detrimental impact of suicide on indi-
viduals and societies, uncovering the associations, if any,
between cannabis use and risk of suicide in this patient
population is critical [10–12].
Furthermore, there is an abundance of evidence to
suggest that women are more frequently diagnosed with
psychiatric illnesses, in particular anxiety and depression,
compared to men [13–15]. Women have also repeatedly
been shown to have an increased risk of attempting
suicide in the general population [16, 17]. Given this, we
sought to determine the association between cannabis
use and suicide attempt in women and men with psychi-
atric disorders separately. We hypothesize that cannabis
use will be associated with an even greater risk of
attempting suicide in women compared to men, given
that women have been shown to be more susceptible to
the detrimental mental, medical and social consequences
of substance use including cannabis [15, 18–21]. For in-
stance, compared to men, women have repeatedly been
shown to become more rapidly addicted to drugs, suffer
from more severe medical problems despite less heavy
use (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or alco-
holic liver disease), and report more intense subjective
responses to drug use [15, 22, 23]. A study by Patton et
al. found that although the prevalence and heaviness of
cannabis use is greater amongst men, women who used
cannabis daily had more than a fivefold increase in the
risk of
having depression or anxiety compared to
non-users, whereas no association was found in the
same analysis of men [24].
This is the first study, to our knowledge, to investigate
the association between cannabis use and suicidal behav-
ior in the psychiatric population by sex. Our findings
will assist in stratifying the risk of suicide attempt in
psychiatric patients, who are amongst the most likely to
attempt suicide [12, 19]. Provided the World Health
Organization’s (WHO) Mental Health Action Plan to re-
duce the rate of suicide by 10% by 2020, as well as the
legalization of cannabis in Canada to start September
2018, our study is both timely and relevant [18].
Methods
Data collection
We merged patient data that were obtained using similar
protocols to collect homogenous data on adults with
psychiatric disorders for two studies whose methods
have previously been described [20, 25]. Briefly, these
two studies are the Genetics of Opioid Addiction
(GENOA) study, a prospective cohort study of opioid
use disorder using structured scales to assign psychiatric
diagnoses, and the Determinants of Suicidal Behavior:
Conventional and Emergent Risk (DISCOVER) study, a
case-control study of SB using the same diagnostic
methods to reach a psychiatric diagnosis including
substance use [20, 25]. These studies were approved by
the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (10-661,
11-3479, and 11-056). In order to be included into the
current study, participants had to be 18 years of age or
older, provided written informed consent, must have
been interviewed by trained research personnel using
the
Mini-International
Neuropsychiatric
Interview
(M.I.N.I.) and must have also had at least one confirmed
psychiatric diagnosis based on the M.I.N.I. The M.I.N.I.
is a fully validated alternative to the Structured Clinical
Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders’ (DSM-IV) diagnoses and the Compos-
ite International Diagnostic Interview for the Inter-
national
Classification
of
Diseases,
Tenth
Revision
(ICD-10) [26]. From both studies, 683 and 302 patients
were screened for inclusion into our present study (n =
985). See participants’ flow diagram (Fig. 1).
Our primary outcome was the presence or absence of
a lifetime suicide attempt based on patients’ dichotom-
ous response to the question “Did you ever make a sui-
cide attempt?” on the M.I.N.I., coded “yes” or “no.”
Cannabis use was also a dichotomous covariate based on
participants’ response to the question on the M.I.N.I.,
“In the past 12 months, did you take any of [hashish,
“hash”, THC, “pot”, “grass”, “weed”, or “reefer”] more
than once, to get high, to feel elated, to get “a buzz” or
to change your mood?”. The past 12 months of cannabis
use is commonly used in published literature to identify
cannabis users [9, 27]. Data on heaviness of cannabis use
in the GENOA sample was also obtained through
Naji et al. Biology of Sex Differences  (2018) 9:22 
Page 2 of 8
 participants’ reported “average number of days of cannabis
use in the past 30 days” as part of the Maudsley Addiction
Profile [28]. Demographic data including age, sex, marital
and
employment
status
were
obtained
through
face-to-face interviews with all study participants as previ-
ously described [20, 25]. Psychiatric diagnoses were made
if patients met the criteria on the M.I.N.I. for that specific
diagnosis during their intake interview. Patients diagnosed
with co-occurring psychiatric disorders were classified as
having a single principal diagnosis as per the DSM-IV
hierarchy of diagnoses [29].
Statistical analysis
We used descriptive statistics to summarize the participants’
demographic and baseline characteristics. We reported con-
tinuous variables using mean (standard deviation (SD)) and
categorical variables using proportions (percent).
A multi-variable logistic regression model with suicide
attempt as the dependent variable and cannabis use as the
explanatory variable was employed to determine the
strength of the association between cannabis use and sui-
cide attempts in the entire sample, while adjusting for the
following clinically relevant factors: sex, age, marital sta-
tus, employment status, and psychiatric diagnoses. Two
additional multi-variable logistic regressions using the
same independent and dependent variables described
above were conducted for men and women separately.
Lastly, a separate analysis was conducted including the inter-
action variable “sex*cannabis use.” The most commonly
found primary psychiatric diagnoses were substance use
disorders (including drugs other than cannabis), mood dis-
orders (including depression and bipolar disorders), anxiety
disorders (including generalized anxiety, social anxiety,
obsessive-compulsive and post-traumatic stress disorders),
and psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia, schizo-
phreniform, schizoaffective, delusional, and brief psychotic
disorder). However, the covariate “substance use disorder”
(which included drugs other than cannabis) was eliminated
from the analysis due to a high level of collinearity as per
the variance inflation factor.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis using data from the
GENOA sample to look at the impact, if any, of heaviness
of cannabis use on suicide attempt in men and women with
psychiatric diagnoses. Lastly, we conducted secondary ana-
lyses investigating the association between cannabis use
(yes/no) and suicide attempts amongst GENOA and DIS-
COVER participants separately, to ensure robustness of our
findings. Our study was adequately powered to detect an
association using our logistic regression analyses with well
more than 10 events per predictor variable [30]. Specific-
ally, we analyzed data from 465 men and 444 women
against 7 covariates (age, employment, marital status, can-
nabis use, mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders). All stat-
istical analyses were conducted using Stata 13 [31].

 Results
Participant characteristics
Amongst the 985 participants included in our study,
76 participants were excluded for having missing data
in one or more of the covariates analyzed (Fig. 1).
Therefore,
909
participants
were
included
in
the
regression analysis.
The mean age of participants included in our study was
40.2 years (SD = 12.4). Amongst the 909 participants,
more women (n = 158) than men (n = 112) reported
attempting suicide (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.09, 2.01, p =
0.012). Men reported twice as much rate of cannabis use
compared
to
women
(45.6
versus
23.4%,
respect-
ively). Please see Table 1 for a full description of the partic-
ipants' characteristics.
Suicide attempts and cannabis use
No significant association was found between cannabis
use and suicide attempts amongst the total sample of
psychiatric patients (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.77, 1.51, p =
0.663). However, our findings did reveal that amongst
participants with psychiatric disorders, having a mood
disorder (OR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.90, 4.23, p < 0.001) or be-
ing a woman (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.09, 2.01, p = 0.012) is
associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt,
while having a job is protective against suicide attempts
(OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.24, 0.48, p < 0.001). When the same
statistical model described above is used to analyze
GENOA and DISCOVER data separately, the association
between cannabis use and suicide attempt remained in-
significant (data not shown). Lastly, the interaction term
“sex*cannabis use” remained insignificant when included
in the logistic regression model (data not shown).
Sex differences
Cannabis use was not found to be significantly associ-
ated with suicide attempts in women (OR = 0.97, 95% CI
0.61, 1.54, p = 0.884) or men (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.81,
2.22, p = 0.260). Please see Table 2.
Sensitivity analysis: heaviness of cannabis use
Within the GENOA sample, heaviness of cannabis use
was found to be significantly associated with suicide at-
tempt in men (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01, 1.05, p = 0.007),
but not women (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.97, 1.01, p = 0.277).
See Table 3 in Appendix.
Discussion
Findings from this study suggest that amongst patients
with a psychiatric comorbidity, women, unemployed in-
dividuals, and those with mood disorders are at a signifi-
cantly heightened risk of attempting suicide. Heaviness
of cannabis use was also found to be associated with an
increased risk of suicide attempt in men in a subset of
the study sample. Contrastingly, no association was
found between the risk of attempting suicide and
cannabis use, marital status, age, or having an anxiety or
psychotic disorder. Interestingly, the negative impact of
a mood disorder and the protective effect of employ-
ment were more pronounced in men compared to
women with psychiatric disorders.
While cannabis use in the general population leads to
an increased risk of suicide attempts as seen in some
studies, our findings suggest that this association does
not hold true in a large cohort of psychiatric patients
who are at an already heightened risk of attempting sui-
cide [6–9]. Heaviness of cannabis use was, however,
found to have a slight but significant association with
suicide attempt in men in a subset of our study sample.
The pathophysiological link between cannabis use and
suicidal behavior in the general population has yet to be
established, though both direct and indirect associations
between cannabis use and suicide attempt have been hy-
pothesized [9]. One hypothesis suggests that tetrahydro-
cannabinol (THC, the active ingredient of cannabis) has
direct neurophysiological effects that lead to impaired
cognition and behavior, whereas another hypothesis sug-
gests that cannabis use indirectly increases one’s risk for
suicide attempt because cannabis users tend to have
other predisposing social factors that increase their risk
of attempting suicide [9]. Having a psychiatric disorder
including other substance use is likely associated with

 altered neurophysiological state and therefore the effect
of cannabis is less well known and difficult to isolate
from the underlying psychopathology [32, 33].
It is also likely that the association between cannabis
use and suicide risk described in the literature varies by
the type of suicidal behavior. We have previously shown
that certain epidemiological observations of suicide risk
factors, such as obesity, differ for suicide ideation,
attempts, and completed suicide [34]. In addition, we
have also found that genetic risk factors associated with
suicide also varied by the type of suicidal behavior [35].
Taken together, these observations call for homogenous
definitions of suicidal behaviors in order to infer conclu-
sions with any certainty on the association between cer-
tain risk factors and suicide.
Our significant findings related to suicide attempts
and
risk
factors
are
mostly supported
by
existing
literature. Previous studies have established that while
men are at an increased risk of completing suicide, the
prevalence of attempted suicide is significantly higher
in women amongst the general population [16, 17].
Amongst psychiatric disorders, mood disorders are
the most strongly associated with suicidal attempts
[36]. Similarly, unemployment has been linked to a
heightened risk of suicide. Whether this association is
directly causal or indirectly associated with suicide by
precipitating other risk factors for suicide, such as
depression, has yet to be established [17, 37, 38].
Interestingly, the association between having a mood
disorder and attempting suicide was twice as promin-
ent in men as it was in women. Similarly, employ-
ment was more protective against suicide attempt in
men compared to women. While such differences
have not been previously reported, a plausible explan-
ation may be the fact that women are already at a
heightened risk of attempting suicide such that these
additional predisposing factors may play a smaller
role. A similar rationale may explain the significant
association between heaviness of cannabis use and
suicide attempt in men but not in women. This find-
ing
has
not
previously
been
reported
in
this
population, and previous literature has actually re-
vealed that even amongst cannabis users, women are
more likely than men to attempt suicide [9]. It is pos-
sible that, given that women experience deleterious
effects of cannabis use at lower doses and more fre-
quently than men as we describe above, the dose re-
sponse
relationship
is
less
pronounced
[22,
24].
Ultimately, our study adds to the existing body of lit-
erature showing that the elevated suicidal behavior
risk amongst women, the unemployed, and those with
a mood disorder seen in the general population re-
mains consistent in a cohort of psychiatric patients
and that the effects of unemployment, mood disor-
ders, and heavy cannabis use are more pronounced in
men compared to women.
Our current study findings advance knowledge regard-
ing suicide risk in psychiatric patients and warrant fur-
ther investigation into the effect of cannabis on specific
psychiatric disorders. With the WHO’s plans to reduce
suicide rate by 10% by 2020, it is imperative that we
establish clear risk factors to assist in stratifying individ-
uals’ suicidal risk [18]. While such data exist on a general
population level, they are lacking amongst psychiatric
patients who comprise a large proportion of patients
with suicidal behavior. The prevalence of suicide attempt
in our patient sample (29.7%) falls on the higher end of
the spectrum of what has previously been reported for
psychiatric patients [39]. Given that 50% of patients who
attempt
suicide
are
known
to
have
a
concurrent
substance use disorder, this finding is expected as the
majority of patients in our sample have a substance use
disorder [40].
Our study reveals that in a large population of psychi-
atric patients, women, those who are unemployed, those
who have a mood disorder, and men with heavier canna-
bis use are at a heightened risk of attempting suicide
and may therefore require closer follow-up, additional
counseling, and/or screening for underlying mental
health processes to mitigate the risk of SB [41]. Con-
trastingly, cannabis use as a whole does not seem to add
to the suicide risk in this patient population despite its

 established association with suicide risk in the general
population, though this effect may vary in certain sub-
groups and based on the amounts used. Nonetheless,
cannabis use has been associated with other psychopath-
ology such as mood and psychotic symptoms which may
in turn increase the risk of suicide and therefore
cannabis use in this high-risk population should not be
overlooked [42].
Limitations
It is important to acknowledge the limitations of our
findings. Firstly, we merged data from two studies that
recruited patients for different purposes. However, the
outcomes and covariates we analyzed in the present
study were collected from all patients using the same
consistent case report forms and the M.I.N.I., meaning
that it should not have had an impact on our findings.
Additionally, all patients included met the inclusion cri-
teria of our present study, including the presence of a
psychiatric diagnosis. It is also worth reiterating that our
findings remained unchanged when data from both
studies were analyzed separately, indicating robustness
of our findings. However, when data on heaviness of
cannabis use were investigated, which were available
from one study only (GENOA), we noticed a significant
association between heaviness of cannabis use and SB in
men. This may indicate that the amount and/or fre-
quency of cannabis use may have negative effects on SB
and that further studies should examine the amount and
frequency of cannabis use in psychiatric patients if we
are to draw any firm conclusions.
Secondly, cannabis use and suicide attempt were based
on self-report, inevitably subjecting our findings to social
desirability
bias.
However,
we
can
argue
that
the
self-reported
use
of
cannabis
is
relatively
accurate
despite the expected bias. In a previous study, we have
shown self-reported cannabis use to be significantly as-
sociated with urine drug screen for cannabis with 79.9%
sensitivity
and
80.0%
specificity
[43].
Our
primary
question assessing cannabis use also specifies recre-
ational use, which may exclude participants who believe
their illicitly obtained cannabis is for medical use or
those who obtain medicinal cannabis but use it recre-
ationally, thus potentially biasing our findings towards
the null. Once again, this is unlikely to have a major im-
pact on the findings given that approximately 90% of
adult cannabis users report recreational use [44].
Moreover, while it is important to identify suicide at-
tempts in a longitudinal study, this is challenging due to
the low incidence of suicide attempts and the need for a
very large cohort that must be followed for a lengthy
period of time making the study not feasible and the
cost prohibitive. As such, the majority of the literature
on cannabis use and suicide attempt relies on self-report
in cross-sectional studies [6, 9]. It is also worth noting
that we wanted to identify if differences exist based on
how we captured the suicide question and thus con-
ducted a secondary analysis using data from the 231 par-
ticipants for whom we had access to hospital records of
clinically documented suicide attempt, and we found
that the association between cannabis use and suicide at-
tempt (as per hospital records) remained insignificant
(data not shown).
Lastly, given that our sample comprised of a large
number of patients with opioid use disorder, it is pos-
sible that the established association between opioid use
and SB as well as unintentional overdoses may have con-
founded our findings [45–47]. However, it is unlikely to
have changed our results given that our results remained
unchanged in a subgroup analysis of DISCOVER pa-
tients of whom a minority were patients with substance
use disorders. Nonetheless, it may be worthwhile for
future studies investigating the association between
cannabis use and suicide attempt in psychiatric patients
to
stratify
findings
based
on
specific
psychiatric
comorbidities.
Conclusion
While previous research has demonstrated a positive
association between cannabis use and suicide attempt
in the general population [6–8], our study reveals that
such association does not exist amongst both men and
women with psychiatric disorders. However, the heavi-
ness of cannabis use in men had a modest but signifi-
cant association with suicide attempts in a subset of
this study. The impact of cannabis use, although com-
mon, in people with psychiatric disorders is therefore
different than that in the general population. This
study identified significant risk factors for suicide at-
tempts
in
psychiatric
patients
including
being
a
women, being unemployed, and having a mood dis-
order, in keeping with previous research [16, 37, 38].
Findings from this study may serve to educate health
professionals when stratifying patients’ risk of suicide
as well as policy makers when reviewing current strat-
egies to mitigate suicide risk. This may include more
aggressive treatment of mood disorders in primary
care, more social services to support patients with psy-
chiatric disorders to assist in job placements, skills de-
velopment, and programs to encourage return to work
plans. Further data on cannabis use including heavi-
ness are also needed to identify those at risk of suicide
attempts. Taken together, our findings provide data
upon which we may base decisions when striving
towards achieving the WHO’s Mental Health Action
Plan to reduce the rate of suicide by 10% by 2020, by
addressing modifiable risk factors such as unemploy-
ment as described above [18].

This table contains the results of the sensitivity analysis investigating the association between the heaviness of cannabis use and suicide attempts amongst a
sample of patients with substance use disorders. Heaviness of cannabis use was found to have a modest but significant association with suicide attempt in men
(OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01, 1.05, p = 0.007), but not women (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.97, 1.01, p = 0.277)
