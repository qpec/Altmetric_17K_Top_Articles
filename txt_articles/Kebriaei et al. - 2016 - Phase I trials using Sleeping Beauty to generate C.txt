Introduction
The adoptive transfer of clinical-grade T cells genetically modified 
with retrovirus or lentivirus to express a chimeric antigen recep-
tor (CAR) has been shown in clinical trials to lyse CD19+ tumor 
cells (1–10). Nonviral gene transfer could potentially reduce the 
costs and complexity associated with recombinant viral vector–
based immunotherapy. Synchronous activation of CAR T cells 
can cause acute adverse events, especially for patients with a high 
disease burden (11–13). The issues of cost and cytokine release 
syndrome may be mitigated by infusing T cells genetically modi-
fied with the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon/transposase system 
to express a CD19-specific CAR after autologous and allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to target mini-
mal residual disease (MRD).
BACKGROUND. T cells expressing antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) improve outcomes for CD19-expressing  
B cell malignancies. We evaluated a human application of T cells that were genetically modified using the Sleeping Beauty 
(SB) transposon/transposase system to express a CD19-specific CAR.
METHODS. T cells were genetically modified using DNA plasmids from the SB platform to stably express a second-generation 
CD19-specific CAR and selectively propagated ex vivo with activating and propagating cells (AaPCs) and cytokines. Twenty-six 
patients with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia safely underwent hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) and infusion of CAR T cells as adjuvant therapy in the autologous (n = 7) or allogeneic settings (n = 19).
RESULTS. SB-mediated genetic transposition and stimulation resulted in 2,200- to 2,500-fold ex vivo expansion of genetically 
modified T cells, with 84% CAR expression, and without integration hotspots. Following autologous HSCT, the 30-month 
progression-free and overall survivals were 83% and 100%, respectively. After allogeneic HSCT, the respective 12-month rates 
were 53% and 63%. No acute or late toxicities and no exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease were observed. Despite a 
low antigen burden and unsupportive recipient cytokine environment, CAR T cells persisted for an average of 201 days for 
autologous recipients and 51 days for allogeneic recipients.
CONCLUSIONS. CD19-specific CAR T cells generated with SB and AaPC platforms were safe, and may provide additional 
cancer control as planned infusions after HSCT. These results support further clinical development of this nonviral gene 
therapy approach.

tional hot spots from separate SB-mediated genetic modifications 
(Figure 1A). Of 7,436,108 raw reads from 33 independent librar-
ies, 99.9% of SB integrations were identified, as expected, at TA 
dinucleotide sites highlighting the lack of illegitimate homologous 
recombination events. Intragenic insertions represented only 
39% of the total and 96.5% of these were within introns, while 
only 3.5% were within coding (exons) and noncoding (5′ UTR and 
3′ UTR) regions. Integrations were distributed widely throughout 
the genome without apparent bias (Figure 1B). One of the largest 
libraries, C26, shared more than 40% of its insertional sites with 
either C12 or C13, and C4 shared many integration sites with C19 
(Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online 
with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI86721DS1), despite all libraries 
being generated from independent genetic modifications. The 
majority of libraries had fewer than 20% of sites shared in com-
mon with any other library. Thus, the vast majority of insertion 
sites were observed only once, arguing against the presence of fre-
quently used, common insertional hot spots.
Manufacturing of genetically modified T cells. To produce CAR 
T cells for infusion, peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) simply obtained by venipuncture (Supplemental Table 
1), were electroporated with SB transposon and transposase plas-
mids encoding CD19RCD28 and SB11. Electroporated cells were 
expanded on γ-irradiated clone 4 AaPCs for a median of 28 days 
(autologous: average 29 days, SD 1.4 days; allogeneic: average 28.5 
days, SD 3.9 days) with IL-2 and IL-21, enabling selective growth 
of T cells stably encoding the CD19-specific CAR (Figure 2A), fol-
lowing methods reported previously (34–38). This process resulted 
in the selective outgrowth of T cells with integrated CAR (average 
cell expansion: ~2,200-fold autologous and ~2,500-fold allogene-
ic). Numerically expanded CAR T cells at the time of infusion had, 
on average, 1 (allogeneic) and 1.3 (autologous) CAR integrants by 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Figure 2B). The majority of manufac-
tured T cells expressed the CAR and most coexpressed CD8 (Fig-
ure 2C and Supplemental Table 2). Expanded T cells were cryopre-
served, passed release testing to generate a certificate of analysis 
(as published) (36), and were thawed on the day of infusion after 
the recipient met eligibility.
Manufactured T cell products. Our approach to manufacturing 
was based on the desired outgrowth of a heterogeneous population 
of T cells that can sustain proliferation (on AaPCs in the presence 
of IL-2 and IL-21) mediated by recursive signaling through the 
introduced CAR. As part of in-process testing, we showed that the 
karyotypes of the first 5 autologous and 4 allogeneic products (plus 
5 additional T cell products not used in these trials) were normal 
by G-banding (Supplemental Table 2). The median CAR expres-
sion in released CD3+ T cells was 88.5% (SD 6%, range 77%–96%) 
and 83% (SD 6%, range 59%–97%) for patient- and donor-derived 
T cells, respectively (Supplemental Table 2). The manufactured 
products consisted of T cells with a phenotypic mixture of CCR7neg 
CD45RAnegCD27+CD28+ differentiated effector memory (TEM), 
CCR7+CD45RA+CD27+CD28+ naive (TN) or stem cell memory T 
cells (TSCM), and CCR7+CD45RAnegCD27+CD28+ central memory 
(TCM) immunophenotypes (Supplemental Figure 2). No produced 
T cells with an exhausted and immune-incompetent phenotype 
were observed by flow cytometry. However, quantification of 
mRNA species did reveal that LAG3, PDCD1LG2, and E2F were 
The SB system (14) uses a synthetic DNA transposon for 
nonviral somatic gene transfer. Genomic incorporation of the 
CAR transcript from an electrotransferred SB transposon into TA 
dinucleotide base pairs is enzymatically mediated by an SB trans-
posase (e.g., SB11) (15) coded in trans from another DNA plasmid. 
The SB transposon was modified to express a second-generation 
CD19-specific CAR (designated CD19RCD28) (16, 17) that acti-
vates T cells through cytoplasmic CD28 and CD3 upon binding 
cell-surface CD19, independent of HLA (18).
Patients with advanced CD19+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 
and leukemias undergoing allogeneic HSCT remain at high risk 
for disease relapse. HSCT can be curative in some patients, with 
reported 1-year overall survival (OS) rates ranging from less than 
20% to 34% after reinduction of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) (19–23) and disease progression as the major cause 
of treatment failure. Recipients of allogeneic HSCT for advanced 
CD19+ NHL also have high relapse rates, as patients with chemo-
therapy-sensitive PET-positive NHL had a 3-year progression rate 
of approximately 40% versus 26% for those who were PET nega-
tive (24). No effective conventional treatment options exist for 
recipients who relapse following HSCT. The OS for adults with 
ALL who relapse after initial therapy is poor, with less than 10% 
5-year OS and a median survival of 2–3 months (19, 24–26). To date, 
the most common relapse-reduction strategy after HSCT involves 
immune manipulation, ranging from donor lymphocyte infusion 
(DLI) to second HSCT (27–29). While graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD) reduces relapse risk (30), conventional (not genetically 
modified) DLI provides minimal benefit in these patients, with 
remission rates below 10% and a high GVHD incidence (31, 32).
CAR T cells have clinical activity against NHL and ALL, but 
with potentially life-threatening cytokine release syndrome when 
used in patients with high disease burdens. We hypothesized that 
CAR T cells might be used more safely in the state of MRD after 
HSCT while retaining a targeted graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect. 
Herein, we report the first human application of the SB system for 
26 patients with advanced CD19+ NHL or ALL, all of whom safely 
and successfully received a single administration of patient- or 
donor-derived CD19-specific CAR T cell infusions in the phase I 
 
adjuvant setting following autologous (n = 7) or allogeneic (n = 19) 
HSCT. Indeed, the administration of donor-derived CAR T cells 
also expressing endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) apparently did 
not exacerbate GVHD. The trials met the primary (safety, fea-
sibility, T cell persistence) and secondary (efficacy) objectives 
and these data support the clinical use of SB-modified T cells to 
improve outcomes of patients with malignancies.
Results
Integration of CAR after Sleeping Beauty transposition. High-
throughput sequencing was used to examine the CAR integration 
pattern after T cells were genetically modified by electrotransfer of 
2 SB system DNA plasmids and propagated on γ-irradiated activat-
ing and propagating cells (AaPCs) clone 4 (33) in the presence of 
soluble recombinant IL-2 and IL-21. Genomic DNA (gDNA) librar-
ies were made from independent polyclonal T cell populations 
genetically modified with the SB system to express CD19RCD28, 
and each integration site was determined in each library. We com-
pared insertions between libraries, assessing for common inser-

IMGTrepertoire) simultaneously in a multiplex digital assay to 
quantify the TCR transcriptome. Analyses of 5 patient CAR T cell 
preparations performed before (day 0) and 28 days after electro-
poration demonstrated that a broad TCR Vα and Vβ repertoire was 
maintained, similar to that present before gene transfer (Supple-
mental Figure 3, B–D). In addition, CAR T cells from donor P411 
underwent an additional cycle of stimulation, and the diversity 
of the TCR Vβ repertoire (assessed by flow cytometry on day 35) 
revealed no outgrowth of an oligoclonal T cell population (Supple-
increased. Telomere length was not significantly changed over 28 
days of ex vivo culture (in fact, there was a trend toward longer 
telomeres), indicating that CAR T cells did not enter into repli-
cative senescence (Supplemental Figure 3A), presumably due to 
IL-21–mediated activation of telomerase via STAT3 (39).
We investigated whether expression of TCR Vα and Vβ vari-
ants within the CAR T cell populations changed during culture. 
Using the direct TCR expression assay (DTEA) (40), we assessed 
the abundance of 45 TCR Vα and 46 Vβ genes (www.imgt.org/

CD19RCD28 CAR. From greater than 7 
million raw sequences, 696,059 nonre-
dundant sequences were obtained. The 
inverted repeats (IRs) and direct repeats 
(DRs) were digitally removed, leaving 
571,533 unique integrations, of which 
100,000 were mapped. The percentages 
in AT-rich regions and in intragenic regions 
are displayed in the right-hand graphics.

eration; and RNF125, which plays a positive role in TCR-mediated 
signaling; all of which, as expected, were higher in unmanipulated 
(day 0) T cells. Effector molecules (GzmA, GzmB, CTSW, inhibito-
ry receptor NKG2C), transcriptional regulators involved in differ-
entiation and proliferation (BATF, OPTN, E2F1, RUNX2), signal-
ing and activation (IL2RA, IL2RB, IL2RG, CD38, JAK3, ADAM19, 
SIT1, chloride ion channel gene CLIC1, CXCR6), migration and 
homing (ITGB7, ADAM19, chemokines CCL3 and CCL5), metabo-
lism (GLIPR1), exhaustion-related molecules (LAG3, PDCD1LG2), 
negative regulators of T cell function (LGALS1, IRF4), and the 
senescence-inducing molecule E2F1, were among the genes 
upregulated in day-28 CAR cells. Gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) was performed using the Molecular Signature Database 
mental Figure 4). Thus, no significant changes in the TCR reper-
toire were observed during culture, consistent with random inte-
gration after gene transfer (as per Figure 1) followed by unbiased 
propagation. Measurement of mRNA levels using barcoded digital 
probes for genes associated with T cell function (Supplemental 
Table 3) revealed that 93% (533 of 574) of genes had unchanged 
expression in the manufactured products compared with T cells in 
PBMCs (autologous n = 1, allogeneic n = 2). Genes that were signif-
icantly different were predominantly those associated with T cell 
activation (Figure 2, D and E). These included transcription factors 
known to be expressed in naive and memory cells (Lef1, FoxP1), 
integrin ITGB1, and type 1 cytokine receptor IL7R; costimulatory 
molecule ICOS; multifunctional protein BIRC2 that regulates not 
only caspases and apoptosis, but also modulates inflammatory sig-

(MSigDB v5.0) on the C2 and C5 libraries from Supplemental Fig-
ure 1. However, no specific gene set was enriched (FDR < 5% or 
< 1%) either in day-0 or day-28 cells (data not shown). To avoid 
transposition after infusion, the presence of SB11 was excluded by 
PCR at the time of cryopreservation in all infused products (Sup-
plemental Table 2) (35, 38). In addition, aliquots of each CAR T 
cell product were tested for autonomous growth according to our 
published methods (38), and no aberrant growth was seen (Sup-
plemental Figure 5). As expected, all CAR T cells exhibited signifi-
cant CD19-specific cytolysis (Supplemental Table 4). These data 
demonstrate that the electrotransfer of SB plasmids into T cells, 
and their subsequent numeric expansion on AaPCs with IL-2 and 
IL-21, results in CAR T cells that are free of detectable SB11, have 
unaltered TCR diversity and telomere length, and include T cell 
subpopulation(s) that are predicted to persist after adoptive trans-
fer. Indeed, the electroporation of the SB system and subsequent 
propagation results in unbiased outgrowth of CAR T cells with 
TCR diversity that is similar to PB and phenotypes and genotypes 
that are consistent with CAR-dependent physiological stimulation 
of T cells on AaPCs with cytokine support.
Patient characteristics and disease response. We administered 
thawed CD19-specific patient- or donor-derived T cells into 26 
patients with multiply relapsed B-lineage ALL (n = 17) or B cell 
NHL (n = 9) on 2 intent-to-treat investigator-initiated clinical tri-
als at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD 
Anderson) after autologous (n = 7, NCT00968760), or allogeneic 
non-neonatal (n = 19, NCT01497184) HSCT (Table 1). There were 
an additional 18 prospective patients (36% of all enrollees) who 
did not receive their manufactured T cells due to being ineligible 
after HSCT, which highlights the medical fragility and advanced 
state of disease within the cohort. Twelve percent of all enroll-
ees did not receive T cells due to difficulties during manufacture: 
inability to grow adequate T cells, n = 1; contamination of CAR 
product during manufacture, n = 5 (Figure 3A). All recipients of T

enrolled in the 2 trials (NCT00968760 and NCT01497184, respectively). Enrollment occurred to obtain peripheral blood for manufacture of the genetically 
modified T cells and then the prospective patients were required to meet eligibility to administer the T cells. Some potential recipients were deemed 
ineligible to receive a successfully manufactured product, which highlights the medical fragility and advanced malignant disease of the enrollees. Some 
potential recipients were unable to receive T cells due to difficulties associated with their manufacture. All patients who received genetically modified T 
cells were included in survival analyses. Overall (blue line) and progression-free (red line) survival for (B) autologous as well as (C) allogeneic recipients and

cells were analyzed for survival (Figure 3, B–D). Infusions of CAR 
T cells followed an interpatient dose escalation schema based on 
the number of cryopreserved CD3+ T cells per recipient’s calcu-
lated body surface area (41) (107/m2 to 5 × 109/m2 for autologous 
 
T cells and 106/m2 to 108/m2 for allogeneic T cells, Table 1).
Seven patients with a median age of 52 years (range 36 to 61 
years), including 4 with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBL), 
were treated with autologous HSCT, conditioned with BEAM 
(carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan), followed by 
administration of CAR T cells at an average of 2 days after infu-
sion of PB stem cells (PBSCs). Six of 7 patients remain in complete 
remission (CR) with a median follow-up of 25.5 months (range: 6.4 
to 32.7 months). The patient that did not achieve a CR was trans-
planted with persistent CNS disease and also received CAR T cells 
with reduced activation marker expression (Supplemental Figure 
2F). For the autologous HSCT group, the 30-month progression-
free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 83.3% and 100%, 
respectively (Figure 3B).
Nineteen patients (B-ALL, n = 17; DLBL, n = 2) (Figure 3C) with 
a median age of 31 years (range 21 to 56 years) received allogeneic 
CAR T cells. The majority of patients had advanced-stage disease 
(prior HSCT, n = 3; CR2, n = 7; CR3, n = 1; primary induction failure 
or refractory relapse, n = 8) at the time of HSCT and T cell infusion. 
CAR T cells were administered without additional lymphodeple-
tion or other preparation at a median of 64 days (range 43–84 days) 
following PBSC infusion. The preparative regimen was at the dis-
cretion of the treating physician; 11 patients received a myeloab-
lative, mainly busulfan-based regimen, and 8 patients received a 
fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning regimen. GVHD 
prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and minidose methotrexate as 
described for patients after matched-sibling HSCT (42), and tacro-
limus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-HSCT cyclophosphamide 
after haploidentical HSCT (43). GVHD prophylaxis was tapered 
and discontinued by 6 months after HSCT, as feasible. Eleven of 19 
patients remain in remission with a median follow-up of 7.5 months 
(range 2.7 to 17.9 months), with 1-year PFS and OS rates of 53% and 
63%, respectively. When the subset of allogeneic patients receiving 
haploidentical PBSCs were examined, 8 patients had 1-year PFS 
and OS rates of 75% and 100%, respectively (Figure 3D). These 
survival data after allogeneic HSCT also compare favorably with 
the reported data in the literature (19–24). Furthermore, we dem-
onstrate that up to 108/m2 of CAR T cells can be safely infused after 
allogeneic HSCT without exacerbating GVHD. These 2 phase I pro-
tocols reveal the feasibility of infusing T cells genetically modified 
with the SB system. Furthermore, while the primary objectives of 
these trials were not to establish efficacy, the recipients’ survival 
outcomes are encouraging.
Safety of infusing genetically modified T cells. No unexpected 
acute infusion or delayed toxicities were noted in the autologous 
or allogeneic recipients. In the allogeneic trial, 3 patients devel-
oped GVHD, which is within expectations. One patient developed 
grade 1 acute skin GVHD that resolved with topical steroids, 1 
patient developed chronic skin GVHD that responded to systemic 
steroids, and 1 patient with a prior history of drug-induced liver 
toxicity developed recurrent liver toxicity with a component of 
liver GVHD 1 month following T cell infusion, ultimately dying 
from liver failure. The remaining 5 deaths all were due to disease 
relapse. No significant infections were noted. In fact, the rate of 
CMV reactivation in the allogeneic recipients after infusion of 
genetically modified T cells was only 21% (n = 4) versus 41% pre-
viously reported for our patients without CAR T cell infusion (44). 
This lower rate of CMV reactivation may be due to the polyclonal 
nature of the genetically modified product and presence of a sub-
set of T cells with TCR(s) specific for pathogen(s). Our results are 
consistent with a favorable safety profile for the administration of 
autologous and allogeneic CAR T cells after HSCT and fulfill a pri-
mary objective of these 2 phase I trials.
Persistence of CAR T cells. CAR T cells were intravenously 
administered into PB (Supplemental Table 5) at defined times 
(Supplemental Table 6) after autologous and allogeneic HSCT. 
The persistence of the infused T cells in serial PB samples was 
assessed by both droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and qPCR using 
CAR-specific amplimers (Figure 4). CAR T cells could be detected 
an average of 201 days (n = 7, SD = 118) and 51 days (n = 19, SD = 
50) after autologous and allogeneic HSCT, respectively (Supple-
mental Table 7). Within the allogeneic group, 2 recipients had 
detectable CAR at 90 days, and one of these still had presence of 
genetically modified T cells at 1 year. The majority of allogeneic

presence of CAR sequences. Values at each time point are the average 
transgene copy number with standard error from all available patient 
samples at that time point.

not tested for these recipients). P396 experienced a BM relapse 3 
months following the first CAR T cell infusion, was treated with 
multiagent chemotherapy, achieved minimal residual disease, 
and was reinfused with 5 × 107/m2 CAR T cells under a compas-
sionate need protocol (CIND 12-0067) 6 months following the 
first infusion. The patient progressed 1 month following the sec-
ond T cell infusion with no response to salvage therapy, includ-
ing blinatumomab, ultimately dying from disease progression. 
P410 relapsed in the BM 3 months following the first CAR T cell 
infusion, was reinduced into a fourth CR after multiagent chemo-
therapy, and received a second CAR T cell infusion of 107/m2 CAR 
T cells under a compassionate need protocol (CIND 12-0060) 
4 months following the first infusion. The patient remained in 
remission for 9 months, then experienced isolated leukemia cutis, 
eventually succumbing to malignant disease. The trial was then 
amended to allow for reinfusion of CAR T cells at the treating 
physician’s discretion, and patients P564, P647, and P671 were 
reinfused on protocol. P564 had widespread progression of ALL 
1 month following infusion of CAR T cells, received further sal-
vage therapy to achieve a third CR, and was reinfused with 107/
m2 CAR T cells 3 months after the first administration. The patient 
subsequently developed liver failure with evidence of GVHD and 
veno-occlusive disease, and died in CR 3 months after the second 
CAR T cell infusion. P647 had disease progression 1 month follow-
ing infusion of CAR T cells, received further salvage therapy, and 
was reinfused with 5 × 107/m2 CAR T cells 9 months after the first 
infusion. The patient died in CR from complications of pneumo-
nia 1 month after this infusion. P671 relapsed 402 days after the 
initial CAR T cell infusion following a haploidentical HSCT with 
multiple PET-avid lymph nodes in the right and left axilla, neck, 
and abdomen. Biopsy revealed recurrent CD19+ follicular lympho-
ma. The patient was then reinfused with an additional 5 × 107/m2 
CAR T cells without lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Repeat PET 
1 month after repeat CAR T cell infusion showed an improvement 
of the standard uptake value from 13 to 7.9 (Supplemental Figure 
8, A and B) and biopsy 2 months after infusion found no evidence 
recipients tested had measurable CAR expression through day 
30, with expression in most patients declining by 60 to 90 days 
after administration. There was no apparent positive correlation 
between T cell dose and persistence. CAR T cell survival was less 
in the allogeneic compared with autologous recipients, which 
may reflect the concomitant use of immunosuppressive medica-
tions used to prevent GVHD. On occasion, infused T cells also 
could be detected in cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow (BM) by 
 
ddPCR (P564/BM, 3,896 copies/μg gDNA; P580/BM, 49 copies/
μg gDNA; P661/cerebrospinal fluid, 422 copies/μg gDNA). The 
absolute T cell count on the day of infusion was 38 ± 59/μl and 932 ± 
954/μl for autologous and allogeneic recipients, respectively (Sup-
plemental Table 5). These data demonstrate that the persistence 
of the infused T cells can be sustained after autologous and alloge-
neic HSCT despite some recipients appearing lymphoreplete, and 
despite the low levels of B cells in PB at the time of T cell infusion in 
both autologous and allogeneic recipients (Supplemental Table 5  
and Supplemental Figure 6).
Cytokine data. The persistence of infused CAR T cells is likely 
dependent on activation through the CD19RCD28 CAR (to pro-
vide signals 1 and 2 through chimeric CD3 ζ and CD28, respec-
tively) and costimulation through the common cytokine receptor 
γ chain (to provide signal 3) (45). The cryopreserved CAR T cells 
expressed receptors for IL-15 and IL-21, but expression of other 
cytokine receptors was below the threshold of detection (Figure 
5A). At the time of infusion the recipients had absent to low cir-
culating levels of IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, despite the immunosup-
pressive environments associated with autologous and allogeneic 
HSCT (Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure 7); thus, the CAR T 
cells could not apparently benefit from prosurvival signals through 
the common cytokine receptor γ chain.
Reinfusion of CAR T cells and antitumor activity independent 
of HSCT. Five patients (Supplemental Table 8) with progression 
of underlying malignancy received a second administration of 
their prior cryopreserved donor-derived, CD19-specific CAR 
T cells (the CD19 status of the relapsed B cell malignancies was

(52). Furthermore, only 2 of 10 recipients who underwent HLA-
matched sibling donor HSCT and 2 of 9 patients who received 
haploidentical or mismatched family donor transplants developed 
reactivation of CMV after receiving CAR T cells. These data com-
pare favorably with our reported CMV reactivation rates of 41% 
following matched-sibling (44) and 71% following haploidentical 
HSCT (53), suggesting that CAR T cells may help with immune 
reconstitution. Furthermore, in contrast with the expected rate 
of 50% GVHD noted after traditional donor lymphocyte infu-
sion (54), we observed a lower rate of acute GVHD (11%). These 
findings are intriguing and suggest that the process of gene 
transfer and ex vivo CAR-dependent propagation may confer 
immune tolerance. These safety data are in line with the infu-
sion of donor-derived CD19-specific CAR+ virus-specific T cells 
infused without exacerbating GVHD or inducing cytokine storm 
after allogeneic HSCT (55). The NCI recently updated their data 
for infusing donor-derived CAR T cells for CD19+ malignancies 
that relapsed after allogeneic HSCT. They noted a response in a 
quarter of patients treated and no recipient developed new-onset 
GVHD (56). One possible general criticism of infusing CAR T cells 
as adjuvant therapy is the cost associated with making a product 
for potential patients who are unable to receive the therapy due 
to complications from HSCT. We emphasize that ours was a fea-
sibility, rather than an intention-to-treat, study. However, we do 
note that 36% of current enrollees did not receive manufactured 
T cells due to adverse events soon after transplant that precluded 
further therapy with CAR T cells. It is expected that this number 
will decrease as investigators gain additional experience adminis-
tering CAR T cells after HSCT.
Efficacy attributable to the administered CAR T cells can be 
ascertained after HSCT by undertaking a lengthy follow-up of the 
recipients. The PFS rates for recipients of both autologous and 
allogeneic HSCT and CAR T cells appeared improved compared 
with historical data. For patients who received CAR T cells after 
autologous HSCT, the 30-month PFS rate was approximately 83% 
(Figure 3B) compared with a 3-year PFS rate of 49% reported for 
patients receiving auto-HSCT for advanced PET-positive DLBL at 
the time of HSCT (57). We note that 4 of 7 patients in the autolo-
gous trial had PET-positive NHL at HSCT, and 3 of these patients 
cleared their malignant disease with infusions of CAR T cells. 
The only autologous patient who did not achieve a CR had CNS 
disease, and that patient’s T cells exhibited the lowest expression 
of HLA-DR and PDL-1 and the highest levels of TIM3 and BTLA 
(Supplemental Figure 2F), and thus were less active and perhaps 
less able to eradicate tumor cells. In our allogeneic trial, the 1-year 
OS was approximately 63% (Figure 3C), compared with reported 
1-year OS rates ranging from less than 20% to 34% in this patient 
population (19–23). Specifically, among our 8 patients receiving 
haploidentical HSCT for advanced CD19+ ALL, 6 remain in CR, 
which is especially encouraging for such recipients who have 
reported relapse rates of 70% when transplanted beyond second 
remission (58). Furthermore, the remission of patient P671 follow-
ing an infusion in the setting of bulky disease provides strong evi-
dence of antitumor activity for the CAR T cells.
Following administration, we were able to detect CAR T cells 
an average of 201 days in autologous HSCT recipients and 51 days 
in allogeneic HSCT recipients (Supplemental Table 7). This persis-
of lymphoma. One month later he was noted to have increased 
activity by PET imaging and received a third dose of haploidenti-
cal donor-derived CAR T cells (also at 5 × 107 T cells/m2), without 
prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and again a reduction in 
PET activity was observed. P671 experienced no cytokine storm or 
other adverse events associated with CAR T cell infusions, despite 
the presence of bulky disease.
Discussion
We report on 2 phase I clinical trials of a potentially new nonvi-
ral approach to the genetic modification of T cells to express a 
second-generation CAR. First, we describe what is to our knowl-
edge a first-in-human application of genetic engineering based 
on SB nonviral gene transfer. When combined with γ-irradiated 
AaPCs and exogenous cytokines, the clinical data meet the trials’ 
primary objectives regarding the safety and feasibility of employ-
ing this transposon/transposase system to generate CD19-spe-
cific CAR T cells for human therapy. Second, we combined the 
planned administration of CD19-specific CAR T cells after con-
ventional autologous and allogeneic HSCT in efforts to improve 
the GVT effects and thus decrease the relapse rate of patients 
with advanced disease. Clinical observations suggest that infused 
T cells sustain proliferation in lymphopenic recipients through 
homeostatic mechanisms, apparently mediated by the removal 
of regulatory/suppressor cells as well as increased availability of 
prosurvival cytokines and by attenuation of deleterious immune 
responses that might otherwise develop against the CAR (7, 46, 
47). We note that 108/m2 of CAR allogeneic T cells could be safely 
infused, including from haploidentical donors, without exacer-
bating GVHD, which is more than would typically be considered 
tolerable for administering nongenetically modified DLI (48). The 
administration of genetically modified T cells in the MRD (adju-
vant) setting following HSCT may maximize safety and avoid 
the potential for cytokine storm that has been reported when T 
cells are infused in a high tumor burden setting (4, 8). A similar 
approach recently was advocated to avoid cytokine storm when 
CD19-specific CAR T cells were used to treat a patient with multi-
ple myeloma (49). This approach reverses the treatment sequence 
suggested by others (50), in which recipients would initially be 
infused with tumor-specific CAR T cells, necessitating anticyto-
kine therapy to control toxicities, followed by a standard-of-care 
HSCT. Furthermore, by using donor-derived CAR T cells in the 
setting of allogeneic HSCT, we genetically reprogrammed healthy 
T cells not previously exposed to chemotherapy. Indeed, there is 
interest in developing allogeneic CAR T cells (recently reviewed in 
ref. 51), especially for developing an off-the-shelf product.
We demonstrated that it is safe and feasible to infuse both 
autologous and allogeneic CAR T cells produced in compliance 
with cGMP for phase I/II trials. Ex vivo coculture of T cells on 
K-562–derived AaPCs with IL-2 and IL-21 was achievable, with 
no apparent concerns of genotoxicity associated with the use of 
a transposon and transposase derived from SB and no cytokine 
storm. This absence of toxicity presumably reflects the low burden 
of CD19 antigen at the time of CAR T cell infusion. Among our 
allogeneic HSCT recipients, we did not observe increased rates of 
infection or GVHD, which stands in contrast with infusion of allo-
geneic mouse CD19-specific CAR T cells into tumor-bearing mice

required to retrieve CAR T cells during tissue culture. This diffi-
culty was apparently solved using the SB system, which employs 
transposition to overcome the low rates of illegitimate recombina-
tion to stably integrate plasmid DNA into the T cell genome. An 
advantage of the SB system is that plasmids can be produced for 
use in compliance with cGMP for less than the cost of generat-
ing clinical-grade recombinant retrovirus or lentivirus (16). Many 
academic and pharmaceutical companies can produce plasmids 
for human applications, avoiding the time delay and difficulties 
associated with reliance upon a small number of manufacturing 
facilities skilled in producing virus for clinical trials. Furthermore, 
gene therapy with purified DNA avoids the delay and cost of test-
ing the infusion product for the unwanted presence of replication-
competent virus. We note that in these studies a transposase of 
intermediate activity (SB11; ref. 35) was used, rather than the more 
active SB100X transposase that may direct multiple integrations 
of transposons into individual cells (68, 69). Another advantage 
of our approach is that we avoided the expense and inconvenience 
associated with steady-state apheresis, as the electroporation and 
propagation of T cells was accomplished from PB obtained by 
venipuncture. Thus, the SB system provides a nimble and efficient 
approach for genetic modification of T cells, enabling investiga-
tors to exchange a transgene or coexpress multiple transgenes to 
improve therapeutic potential.
In addition to possibly enhancing the GVT effect after HSCT, 
the human application of CAR T cells to eliminate MRD will have 
increased importance as this adoptive immunotherapy is applied to 
patients who have attained remission following alternative thera-
pies and/or if additional infusions of genetically modified T cells are 
needed to achieve or sustain complete responses. Indeed, T cells are 
among the few agents that appear to completely eliminate cancer 
cells and thus potentially offer cure to recipients. Furthermore, our 
finding that large doses of HLA-mismatched CAR (TCR+) T cells can 
apparently be safely infused provides encouragement for the human 
application of third-party-derived T cells as off-the-shelf allogeneic 
therapy. In summary, the human application of this potentially new 
approach to gene transfer based on the SB system will enable mul-
tiple investigators to advance immunology into immunotherapies 
for the investigational treatment of human disease.
Methods
Patient eligibility
Autologous trial. As published (41), research participants were eligible 
if they were between 18 and 75 years of age with advanced CD19+ lym-
phoid malignancies, including NHL, small lymphocytic lymphoma 
(SLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B cell lym-
phoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma 
beyond first relapse or primarily refractory to conventional treat-
ment (IRB no. 2007-0635, NIH-OBA no. 0804-922, IND no. 14193, 
Clinical 
Trials.gov Identifier: NCT00968760).
Allogeneic trial. Patients were eligible if they were between 1 and 
65 years of age with advanced CD19+ lymphoid malignancies, includ-
ing NHL, SLL, CLL, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and 
ALL  (IRB no. 2009-0525, NIH-OBA no. 0910-1003, IND no. 14577, 
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01497184). Patients were required 
to have an available HLA-identical donor, HLA 8/8–matched unre-
tence is encouraging and compares favorably with that reported in 
other clinical trials employing a second-generation CAR that signals 
through chimeric CD28 and CD3-ζ (1, 2, 9, 49, 59), but may be low-
er than protocols employing a CAR that signals through chimeric 
CD137 as the source of signal 2, which can last in some cases up to 
4 years after infusion (60). The persistence of infused T cells may 
have been improved by lymphodepletion of the recipient during 
HSCT conditioning. Indeed, in a study infusing donor-derived CAR 
T cells following allogeneic HSCT without prior lymphodepletion, 
in vivo proliferation of the CAR T cells was observed, but the cells 
apparently did not persist (56). We note that in our study, concur-
rent administration of tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis may have 
reduced the survival of infused allogeneic T cells compared with 
the persistence of autologous T cells. Consideration of shortened 
GVHD-prophylaxis approaches or using CD34-selected grafts may 
provide a better platform for adoptive transfer of CAR T cells.
The CAR T cells in our studies were detected by PCR meth-
ods and typically not by flow cytometry. The infused T cells can 
receive prosurvival signals through signals 1 and 2 mediated by 
the CD19RCD28 CAR upon docking with CD19, and presumably 
receive signal 3 through the common cytokine receptor γ chain. 
However, the recipients of T cells in our trial had low levels of B 
cells at the time of infusion (Supplemental Figure 6) and B cell 
numbers remained low for several months thereafter, though we 
did not observe long-term B cell aplasia, a toxicity observed in oth-
er CD19-specific CAR T cell trials (2, 7, 8). Measurements of serum 
cytokines that signal through the common cytokine receptor γ 
chain revealed absent levels of IL-2 and IL-15, with low to normal 
levels of IL-4 and IL-7 and normal to elevated IL-9 (61, 62). (Figure 
5B). Thus, even though the infused CAR T cells could not read-
ily benefit from CAR-dependent as well as cytokine-dependent 
in vivo signaling, we were still able to detect the sustained persis-
tence of CAR T cells. The combination of low levels of antigen-
driven stimulation and cytokines is predicted to compromise the 
persistence of infused T cells. Indeed, as a safety consideration, it 
was verified that the CAR T cells died upon withdrawal of AaPCs 
and exogenous cytokine (Supplemental Figure 5). These reduced 
levels of T cells may have benefited the recipients, as they did not 
suffer adverse events associated with a cytokine storm stemming 
from synchronous activation of administered CAR T cells encoun-
tering large numbers of CD19+ cells (4, 8). Modifications to the 
CAR stalk to reduce binding of Fc receptor(s) may further improve 
the persistence of the genetically modified T cells (63). A follow-
up clinical trial based on the SB system to address these concerns 
is enrolling at MD Anderson (IND no. 16474). In this protocol we 
will assess whether CAR T cells infused in the clinical setting of 
advanced (active) disease will help determine the proliferative 
capacity of a next-generation CAR design when T cells encounter 
an elevated tumor burden.
The human application of the SB system combined with the 
AaPC propagation platform may help further advancements for 
T cell therapy in particular and gene therapy in general (64, 65). 
Nonviral gene transfer has been used previously to genetically 
modify T cells, with limited clinical success (47, 66, 67). This was 
likely due to the inefficiency of gene transfer and resultant need 
to include immunogenic drug resistance transgenes (66) to select 
for genetically modified T cells, and the lengthy culturing periods

human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1, HCV, and HBV, as well as 
analysis of PB collected before manufacture of CAR T cells for pro-
tein expression and genetic profiling. Before initiating the HSCT con-
ditioning regimen, the patients were restaged, including BM biopsy 
and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) 
scans, as clinically indicated. Immediately after the T cell infusion 
(last split dose) weekly for 2 weeks, and at approximately 1, 3, 6, and 12 
months, the research participants had physical and laboratory evalua-
tions, such as PB for protein expression and genetic profiling, includ-
ing PCR analyses for the presence of infused T cells. Skewing of the 
TCR repertoire may indicate that some infused T cells can preferen-
tially survive and thus the PB was serially analyzed for emergence of 
oligoclonal or clonal population(s) of CAR T cells. In addition, PB was 
obtained to measure cytokine levels. Routine imaging studies and BM 
aspirate/biopsies were obtained for restaging of disease at 1, 3, 6, and 
12 months after infusion of PBSCs. Patients were monitored for 30 
days after administration of T cells to assess possible adverse events. 
Enrolled research participants who received genetically modified 
product were required to participate in the long-term follow-up proto-
col (IRB no. 2006-0676, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01492036) 
at 1 year after completion of the T cell protocols per the guidelines set 
forth by the FDA’s Biologic Response Modifiers Advisory Committee 
that apply to gene transfer studies. Enrollees were assigned a unique 
patient number to maintain anonymity.
qPCR and ddPCR to measure T cell persistence
qPCR was performed essentially as previously described (35). Details 
of the process, including the primers used, are provided in the Supple-
mental Methods.
PCR to detect the presence of SB11
Detection of SB11 in genetically manipulated T cells was per-
formed essentially as described previously using primers to detect 
transposase (Forward: 5′-ATGGGAAAATCAAAAGAAATC-3′ and 
Reverse: 5′-CTAGTATTTGGTAGCATTGC-3′) and GAPDH as a 
loading control (Forward: 5′-TCTCCAGAACATCATCCCTGC-
CAC-3′ and Reverse: 5′-TGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCACCCTG-3′) 
(16, 35, 38). Detailed methods are available in the supplemental 
material from ref. 35.
Linker-mediated PCR (LM-PCR)
LM-PCR was performed as previously described (70). The primers 
used for secondary PCR were barcoded and designed for Illumina 
sequencing; these have been published previously (70). Detailed 
methods are provided in the Supplemental Methods.
Direct TCR expression analysis to quantify TCR Vα  
and Vβ gene expression
We used DTEA to determine TCR variable Vα and Vβ gene diversity 
in T cells before and after electroporation/propagation, essentially 
as described (35, 40). For further information, please see Supple-
mental Methods.
Multiparameter flow cytometry
Multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of different cell subsets was 
performed on banked samples. The reagents for all flow cytometric 
evaluations are described in detail in the Supplemental Methods.
lated adult donor, or haploidentical family donor. Additional eligibil-
ity criteria for both trials included adequate organ function, a Zubrod 
performance status of 0-1 or Lansky greater than or equal to 60%, no 
evidence of uncontrolled infection, and negative serology for hepati-
tis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus. Patients with 
known allergy to bovine or murine products were excluded. Further-
more, recipients were not allowed to receive systemic corticosteroids 
within 3 days before, or be experiencing any new clinically significant 
toxicity within 24 hours before, a T cell infusion. Prospective patients 
for both trials were referred, recruited, and enrolled at MD Anderson 
prior to beginning manufacture and then were required to meet eligi-
bility to receive the genetically modified T cells.
T cell manufacture in compliance with cGMP for phase I/II trials
Approximately 200 ml of PB was obtained by venipuncture. The 
2 supercoiled SB DNA plasmids (manufactured by Waisman Bio-
manufacturing, and meeting release criteria) (36) encoding the CAR 
(CD19RCD28) transposon (16–18) and SB11 transposase (16, 33, 38), 
were simultaneously electrotransferred into 2 × 108 T cells with a 
Nucleofector II (Lonza Group). Release criteria to produce banks were 
as described (36–38). Details of the manufacturing and expansion pro-
cess are provided in the Supplemental Methods.
Cytolytic activity assessment for CAR T cells
The specific redirected killing of CAR T cells was evaluated in a stan-
dard 4-hour chromium release assay, as described previously (38).
Stem cell procurement
PBSCs from patients on the autologous trial were collected at MD 
Anderson after mobilization with filgrastim and chemotherapy. PBSCs 
were obtained from related allogeneic donors using standard mobili-
zation protocols and apheresis techniques at MD Anderson. The target 
PBSC dose for both trials was 4 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg and the minimal 
acceptable dose was 2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg.
HSCT
Autologous and allogeneic HSCT was undertaken at MD Anderson 
(see the Supplemental Methods for the conditioning regimens).
Intravenous infusions of electroporated and propagated T cells
Autologous trial. T cells were administered no sooner than 48 hours 
and no later than 5 days after PBSC infusion.
Allogeneic trial. T cells were administered 6 to 12 weeks fol-
lowing infusion of PBSCs, based on a median time to occurrence 
of acute GVHD of 6 weeks after HSCT. For details, please see the 
Supplemental Methods.
Supportive care
MD Anderson’s institutional HSCT guidelines for antimicrobial, anti-
fungal, and antiviral prophylaxis were followed. Patients did not receive 
filgrastim to enhance neutrophil recovery. Immunoglobulin levels were 
monitored every 28 days for autologous and allogeneic recipients, and 
replaced with intravenous immunoglobulin if less than 500 mg/dl.
Study assessments
Assessments for patients (and healthy donors on the allogeneic trial) 
included HLA typing, serology for cytomegalovirus (CMV), HIV,

Statistics
The maximal tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the highest T cell dose 
at which we were able to treat at least 6 patients with fewer than 2 of 6 
patients having a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), was not reached. DLT 
was defined as a new adverse event of grade greater than 3 involving 
cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic (excluding albumin), neu-
rological, or renal toxicity (CTC, version 4) that is probably or defi-
nitely related to the infused T cell products. Patients could be removed 
from the study for withdrawal of informed consent/authorization, an 
increasing or unexpected pattern of toxicity deemed unacceptable 
by the principal investigator, death, noncompliance with study pro-
cedures, inability to receive a T cell infusion, or study completion. 
The method of Kaplan and Meier (71) was used to estimate the dis-
tribution of OS and PFS from the time of transplant. The nanoString 
gene expression data were initially normalized as suggested by the 
manufacturer. The normalized data were log2 transformed and used 
for analysis. Student’s 2-tailed t tests (paired) were used to compare 
the mRNA levels between day 28 and day 0 for each gene. The raw 
P values are reported; an average fold change greater than or equal 
to 2 and a P value less than 0.0171 (false-positive rate < 0.05) was 
considered statistically significant (multiple comparison adjustment 
was performed using the Bum method, http:/
/bioinformatics.mdan-
derson.org/Software/OOMPA/ClassComparison/html/bum.html). 
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to check and visual-
ize the similarities and variation among samples using differentially 
expressed genes. The log2 transformed data were median centered 
at the gene level for hierarchical clustering analysis using Euclidean 
distance by GenePattern v3.9.5 (Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT). 
GSEA was performed using the differentially expressed gene data by 
GSEA v2.2.0 (Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT). For TCR Vα and 
TCR Vβ data the Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to 
determine similarity and dissimilarity in repertoire between day 0 and 
ex vivo–expanded day 28. All statistical analyses used SAS 9.3 (SAS 
Institute) and R version 3.0.2 (R Foundation).
Study approval
Clinical trials were approved by the MD Anderson IRB. All research 
participants were provided with written, informed consent prior to 
study participation at MD Anderson.
