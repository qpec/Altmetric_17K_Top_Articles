SUMMARY
We report that astrocytic insulin signaling co-regu-
lates hypothalamic glucose sensing and systemic
glucose metabolism. Postnatal ablation of insulin
receptors (IRs) in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-
expressing
cells
affects
hypothalamic
astrocyte
morphology, mitochondrial function, and circuit con-
nectivity. Accordingly, astrocytic IR ablation reduces
glucose-induced activation of hypothalamic pro-
opio-melanocortin(POMC)neuronsandimpairsphys-
iological responses to changes in glucose availability.
Hypothalamus-specific knockout of astrocytic IRs, as
well as postnatal ablation by targeting glutamate
aspartate transporter (GLAST)-expressing cells, repli-
cates such alterations. A normal response to altering
directly CNS glucose levels in mice lacking astrocytic
IRs indicates a role in glucose transport across the
blood-brain barrier (BBB). This was confirmed in vivo
in GFAP-IR KO mice by using positron emission
tomography and glucose monitoring in cerebral
spinal fluid. We conclude that insulin signaling in
hypothalamic astrocytes co-controls CNS glucose
sensing and systemic glucose metabolism via regula-
tion of glucose uptake across the BBB.
INTRODUCTION
Glucose availability in the CNS is critical for neuronal function,
and glucose levels in the brain regulate local neuronal activity
and whole-body energy metabolism. Although glucose handling
in the brain has been considered an insulin-independent process
(Cranston et al., 1998; Hasselbalch et al., 1999), an open debate
exists about the role of insulin action in controlling cerebral
glucose metabolism. Several lines of evidence suggest that insu-
lin signaling regulates central and systemic metabolic homeosta-
sis (Bru
¨ ning et al., 2000; Woods et al., 1979). However, the molec-
ular mechanisms and the main cellular targets mediating central
actions of insulin are far from being completely understood.
Interestingly,alterations in the insulin-CNS axis have been asso-
ciated with the progression of some neurodegenerative diseases,
including Alzheimer’sdisease (Kleinridderset al.,2014;Kochet al.,
2008), indicating that an inappropriate control of central insulin
signaling might be relevant for pathological conditions affecting
neuronal integrity and function. Insulin receptors (IRs) are widely
distributed in the CNS (Havrankova et al., 1978) and abundantly
expressed in epithelial cells in the choroid plexus and in brain
endothelial cells (Frank et al., 1986). Cerebral blood vessels are
ensheathed by endothelial cells that interact with adjacent astro-
cytes, the combination regulating the entry of nutrients, such as
glucose, by changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability
(Alvarez et al., 2013). Importantly, regulation of blood glucose sup-
ply to and within the brain is controlled via glucose transporter
(GLUT)-1 (Abbott et al., 2006; Armulik et al., 2010). Although
GLUT-1ishighlyexpressed along the BBB inbothendothelial cells
and astrocytes (Barros et al., 2007; Simpson et al., 2001), it is more
abundant in astrocytes (Simpson et al., 1999). Astrocytes are
the most abundant cells in the brain, and they provide a
nurturing environment regulating all aspects of neuronal function,
including synaptic plasticity, survival, development, metabolism,
and neurotransmission, among others. In fact, astrocytes are
abletorespondtolocallevelsofnutrients,acting asmetabolicsen-
sorsand expressing specificreceptorsand transportersextending
throughout their membrane surface (Garcı
´a-Ca
´ ceres et al., 2012).
Consistent with this, astrocytes are located at the interface

867
 between vessels and neurons,putting them in a privileged position
to control glucose fluxes between the periphery and the CNS.
However, the possibility that insulin signaling in astrocytes plays
a functional role in systemic metabolism has never been studied.
We therefore used a series of glia-specific loss-of-function models
to uncover the function of astrocytic insulin signaling in the brain
and, more specifically, for hypothalamic glucose sensing.
RESULTS
Postnatal Ablation of Insulin Receptors from Astrocytes
To uncover the role of IRs in astrocytes, we used a Cre/lox
approach to genetically remove IRs exclusively from human glial
fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP)- and glutamate aspartate trans-
porter (GLAST)-positive cells. Because glial cells act as neuronal
progenitor cells during brain development (Goldman, 2003), we
generated tamoxifen-inducible transgenic hGFAP-CreERT2 (Ga-
nat et al., 2006) and knockin GLASTCreERT2 (Buffo et al., 2008;
Mori et al., 2006) mouse models to achieve time-specific IR flox/
flox (f/f) deletion in adult mice. Using Rosa26 ACTB-tdTomato/
EGFP (tdTomato/eGFP) reporter mice, we confirmed that Cre-
mediated recombination occurred following intraperitoneal (i.p.)
tamoxifen (Tx) injection (Figure S1A). In agreement with previous
studies demonstrating that both hGFAPCreERT2 (Kim et al.,
2014) and GLASTCreERT2 (Mori et al., 2006) mouse modelsaresuit-
able to achieve Cre-mediated recombination in astrocytes, we
observed that virtually all of the Cre-recombined cells in the medi-
obasal hypothalamus (MBH) exhibited the stellated morphology
characteristic of astrocytes, as well as immunoreactivity for
GFAP and S100b after Tx administration (Figure S1B; Table 1).
To demonstrate IR deletion in cells undergoing Cre-recombina-
tion, we crossed hGFAP-CreERT2:IRf/f and IRf/f mice with
hGFAP-eGFP mice in which the fluorescent protein GFP was
placed under control of the human GFAP promoter (Nolte et al.,
2001). Using this reporter mouse model, we purified hGFAP-
GFP+ cells from brains of adult mice by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) and confirmed that IR expression was signifi-
cantly reduced exclusively in the brains of hGFAP-CreERT2:IRf/f
mice treated with Tx (named GFAP-IR KO mice; Figure 1A). IR
mRNA expression was absent from GFP-targeted astrocytes in
the hypothalamus of GLAST-IR KO mice (GLASTCreERT2:IRf/f
mice injected with Tx) and crossed with tdTomato/eGFP mice,
whereas IR mRNA was present in astrocytes of GLAST-IR wild-
type (WT) mice (Figures 1B and S1C).
Finally, we confirmed that insulin treatment enhanced protein
kinase B (Akt) activation in hypothalamic GFAP-positive cells of
GFAP-IR WT mice (IRf/f mice treated with Tx), but not in GFAP-IR
KO mice (Figure 1C). In contrast, similar levels of Akt activation
were observed in peripheral insulin-sensitive tissues (e.g., liver,
skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue) of mice with or without
IRs in astrocytes (Figure S2), demonstrating that the loss of IRs
in astrocytes uniquely reduced insulin signaling activation in
astrocytes of the brain.
Insulin Receptors Control Glucose Availability in
Astrocytes
Next, we assessed the impact of IR ablation on glucose availabil-
ity in astrocyte cultures from the hypothalamus of IRf/f male pups
at postnatal day 1 in which IR deletion was induced by adeno-
virus Cre-mediated recombination. First, we confirmed that
adenoviral-based vectors mediated Cre-recombination widely
in astrocyte cultures, succeeding in reducing IRb protein levels
(Figure 1D), IR expression levels (Figure 1E), and the ability of as-
trocytes to phosphorylate Akt following insulin administration
(Figures 1F and 1G). Moreover, the loss of IRs in astrocytes re-
sulted in a lower glucose uptake upon stimulation with glucose
(Figure 1H), consistent with a reduced glycolytic rate (Figure 1I),
lower GLUT-1 expression levels (WT: 1.00 ± 0.09, n = 6 versus
KO: 0.63% ± 0.09% of WT values, n = 6; p < 0.02) and decreased
L-lactate efflux (Figure 1J) in those glial cells. However, no differ-
ences were observed in cellular glycogen content among exper-
imental groups (Figure 1K). Despite having a lower glycolytic flux,
astrocytes without IRs exhibited higher basal mitochondrial
respiration (Figure 1L), and this was associated with higher
expression levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C (CPT1C),
the key enzyme responsible for long-chain fatty acid transport
into mitochondria (Figure 1M). To corroborate that the lack of
IRs in astrocytes elevated mitochondrial fatty acid (beta)-oxida-
tion for compensation of reduced glucose uptake, we used
etomoxir to inhibit CPT1C and thus fatty acid oxidation. Indeed,
etomoxir reduced basal mitochondrial respiration (Figure 1N)
and maximal substrate oxidation (Figure 1O), without causing
changes in glycolytic rate (Figure S3A).
Next, we examined whether insulin signaling in astrocytes
controls mitochondrial responses to glucose. We found that
hypothalamic astrocytes of GFAP-IR WT mice responded to
elevated systemic glucose levels by reducing the overall mito-
chondrial area, whereas there was no such significant change
in hypothalamic astrocytes of GFAP-IR KO mice (Figure S3B).
Despite having no reduced cytosolic mitochondria area, astro-
cytes from the hypothalamus of GFAP-IR KO mice did have a
reduced mitochondrial aspect ratio, a parameter reflecting mito-
chondrial length, due to fewer elongated mitochondria (aster-
isks; Figures 2A and 2B), and an increase in the presence of
autophagosomes (arrows; Figures 2C and 2D) in response to
elevated blood glucose. Both parameters remained unchanged
in GFAP-IR WT mice.
Astrocyte-Specific Loss of Insulin Receptors Affects
Astroglial Morphology
To verify a morphological impact following loss of astrocytic
IRs in vivo, and given the effect of insulin-related peptides
on astroglial differentiation (Toran-Allerand et al., 1991), we
analyzed whether the morphology of hypothalamic astrocytes

 was affected following loss of IRs in vivo. While postnatal astro-
cyte-specific loss of IRs did not alter the total number of hypo-
thalamic GFAP-positive cells (GFAP-IR WT: 93.7 ± 4.4: n = 39
versus GFAP-IRKO: 80.7 ± 5.6: n = 39 astrocyte number /field),
fewer (Figure 2E) and shorter (Figure 2F) primary astrocyte pro-
cesses were quantified in GFAP-IR KO mice compared to levels
in GFAP-IR WT mice (Figure 2G), indicating a potentially altered
interaction with surrounding cells. A comparable reduction in the

 number of primary projections was also seen in extra-hypotha-
lamic areas, such as the hippocampus (Figure S3C), whereas
no changes were detected in the length of the astrocyte pro-
cesses in this area (Figure S3D).
Astrocyte-Specific Loss of Insulin Receptors Reduces
Glucose Sensing in Specific Hypothalamic Brain Nuclei
and Pro-opio-melanocortin Neurons
To evaluate glucose sensing in the hypothalamus in response to
systemic glucose fluctuations, we examined c-Fos immunoreac-
tivity in specific hypothalamic areas following intraperitoneal
(i.p.) glucose injection. GFAP-IR KO mice had a reduced number
of glucose-induced, activated (c-Fos) cells in the dorsomedial
hypothalamus (DMH) (Figures 3A and 3B). No significant differ-
ences were observed in response to elevated blood glucose
levels in the number of c-Fos immunoreactive cells in other hypo-
thalamic areas analyzed, including the ventromedial hypothala-
mus (VMH), lateral hypothalamus (LH), and the arcuate nucleus
of the hypothalamus (ARC) (Figure 3B). Even though peripheral
glucose injection increased the total number of c-Fos-labeled
cells in the ARC of both groups, mice lacking astrocytic IRs
had less of an increase in the number of glucose-activated
pro-opio-melanocortin (POMC) neurons (c-Fos-immunoreac-
tive) in response to i.p. glucose (Figures 3C and 3D).

 associated with changes in neuron-mitochondrial network
complexity (Baltzer et al., 2010; Mandl et al., 2009). Indeed, we
found that POMC neurons of mice lacking IRs in astrocytes
had reduced mitochondrial density (Figure S3E) and mitochon-
drial coverage (Figure S3F) in response to high peripheral
glucose levels, whereas no differences were found in GFAP-IR
WT mice. Both groups had an elevated mitochondrial aspect
ratio in POMC neurons in response to i.p. glucose injection (Fig-

autophagosomes (asterisks; Figures 4A and 4B) and disrupted

 support and functional interorganellar communication regulating
Ca2+ homeostasis, metabolism of glucose, phospholipids, and
cholesterol (Tubbs et al., 2014). After peripheral glucose admin-
istration, GFAP-IR KO mice had higher number of ER-mitochon-
drial contacts in POMC neurons relative to GFAP-IR WT mice
(arrows; Figures 4E and 4F). Taken together, these findings sug-
gest that the lack of IRs in astrocytes induces alterations in neu-
ral-mitochondrial network responses to glucose, which may
impair POMC neurons to appropriately respond to cellular meta-
bolic needs.
Astrocyte-Specific Loss of Insulin Receptors Alters Glial
Coverage Remodeling and Synaptic Input Organization
on Hypothalamic POMC Neurons
To evaluate whether our observed changes in astrocyte
morphology and c-Fos activation affect hypothalamic neural cir-
cuits controlling systemic glucose homeostasis, we analyzed the
patterns of glial ensheathment of perikaryal membranes of immu-
noreactive POMC neurons in the hypothalamus. Mice lacking IRs
exclusively in astrocytes responded to peripheral glucose injec-
tion by less glial coverage of POMC neurons than occurred in
controlmice(Figure5A),asindicatedbyusingelectron(Figure5B)
or confocal microscopy (Figure 5C; GFAP-IR WT + glucose i.p.:
26.81 ± 2.2; n = 15 versus GFAP-IR KO + glucose i.p.: 11.8% ±
1.9% of astrocyte coverage per POMC cell; n = 12; p < 0.002).
Finally, we analyzed the impact of glial coverage changes on
the number and type of synaptic profiles on POMC neurons.
There was an increase in the number of symmetric synapses (Fig-
ure S3H) and no change in the number of asymmetric synapses
(Figure S3I) in response to peripheral glucose injection in both
groups. However, the overall changes in the synaptic profile of
POMC neurons in GFAP-IR KO mice resulted in an elevated num-
ber of total synapses on POMC perikarya (Figures 5D and 5E).

 feeding behavior and glucose regulatory responses to altered
systemic glucose availability. First, mice with or without
astrocytic IRs were subjected to a fasting-induced hyper-
phagia paradigm to generate a physiological situation of
reduced glucose availability. GFAP-IR KO mice were unable
to appropriately curb the hyperphagic response to fasting,
likely due to insufficient availability or delayed appearance
of glucose in the brain (Figure 6A). Consistent with that possi-
bility, GFAP-IR KO mice had a reduced suppression of fast-
ing-induced hyperphagia in response to the administration
of peripheral glucose (Figure 6B), a finding which may reflect
reduced activation of POMC neurons. We also observed
that GFAP-IR KO mice failed to efficiently readjust systemic
glucose levels when subjected to hyperglycemia induced
by peripheral glucose injection (Figure 6C). This effect was
associated with a delayed response to increased peripheral
insulin levels (Figure 6D). Consistent with that, those mice
exhibited a higher area under the curve (AUC) of blood
glucose levels in response to peripheral insulin injection
(Figure 6E).
Next, we evaluated feeding in response to a peripheral
glucose deficiency elicited by the glucoprivic agent, 2-deoxy-
D-glucose (2DG) (Smith and Epstein, 1969). The expected
physiological hyperphagic response was absent in mice lack-
ing astrocytic insulin signaling (Figure 6F), demonstrating
that astrocyte-specific loss of IRs impacts in vivo glucose
metabolism.
GFAP-positive astrocytes only represent one subpopulation of
astrocytes in the brain. We assessed whether the functional
role of astrocytic insulin signaling in regulating glucose meta-
bolism is restricted to the GFAP astrocyte-specific population
or is also relevant for other astroglial populations such as

 GLAST-expressing astrocytes. To accomplish that, we ablated
IRs in astrocytes from adult GLASTCreERT2 mice (Figure 6G),
and replicated the systemic glucose metabolic phenotype.
GLAST-IR KO mice had an exaggerated fasting-induced hyper-
phagia comparable to that observed when we targeted IRs of
GFAP-expressing cells (Figure 6H). In addition, those mice also
had impaired regulation of systemic glucose levels in response
to hyperglycemia (Figure 6I). Thus, both astrocyte-specific
KO models had a significantly increased glucose AUC when
compared to their respective WT groups (Figure 6J). Taken
together, these findings confirm the relevance of a functional
contribution of insulin signaling in astrocytes to systemic glucose
control.
Mice Lacking Insulin Receptors in Astrocytes Exhibit a
Systemic Glucose Metabolic Phenotype that Is Not a
Direct Consequence of Mitochondrial Alterations in
Hypothalamic Astrocytes
To evaluate whether the alterations in systemic glucose meta-
bolism may simply be due to mitochondrial alterations in hypo-
thalamic astrocytes of GFAP-IR KO mice, we generated a mouse
model in which we altered astrocytic mitochondrial function by
ablating uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in GFAP-positive cells of
adult mice (named GFAP-UCP2 KO). Mice lacking UCP2 in as-
trocytes had a higher overall mitochondrial area in the cytosol
of hypothalamic GFAP-positive cells (Figure S3J), and this was
not associated with changes in their mitochondrial aspect ratio

 (aspect ratio; Figures S3K and S3L). Despite mice having mito-
chondrial deregulation in astrocytes caused by the lack of
UCP2, they did not exhibit altered glucose handling (Figure S3M),
as we had observed in GFAP-IR KO mice. Thus, astrocytic mito-
chondrial changes per se, are unlikely cause of altered glucose
control of astrocyte-specific IR conditional KO mice, but
rather represent an adaptive consequence of altered glucose
availability.
Integration of Energy-Related Signals in Astrocytes
Contributes to Regulate Systemic Glucose Metabolism
Leptin and insulin are fundamental energy-related peripheral sig-
nals that have complementary yet distinct action in the brain. In
order to dissect how both signals are integrated at the level of
the astrocyte, we generated a specific adult double-knockout
mouse model to simultaneously ablate both the insulin and leptin
receptors (IR/LepR) in GFAP-positive cells of adult mice. Mice
lacking both IR/LepR in astrocytes (hGFAP-CreERT2- IRf/f/
LepRf/f treated with Tx) had a glucose intolerance phenotype
compared to their control littermates (Figure 6K). These mice
also exhibited elevated basal blood glucose levels (GFAP-IR/
LepR WT mice: 109.8 ± 3.4; n = 12 versus GFAP-IR/LepR KO
mice: 133.8 ± 6.8 mg/dl; n = 5; p < 0.004), thus not only showing
replication but also enhancement of the glucose metabolic
phenotype of astrocyte-specific IR knockout mice. These find-
ings corroborate that hormone signaling in astrocytes has an
important and previously underappreciated role in the control
of systemic glucose metabolism.
Insulin Signaling in Hypothalamic Astrocytes Is
Required for Systemic Glucose Homeostasis
Given that GFAP expression is also observed in non-CNS tissues
(Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010) and that the hypothalamus plays a
pivotal role in the central control of glucose homeostasis, we
used a viral-mediated Cre/lox system approach to delete IRs
exclusively in astrocytes located in the MBH. Using tdTomato/
eGFP mice, we confirmed that viral delivery of Cre-recombination
in hypothalamic GFAP-IR KO mice occurred specifically in astro-
cytes located in the infected area of the hypothalamus, which
also exhibited immunoreactivity to both GFAP and S100b (Fig-
ures 7A and S3N; Table 2). Mice lacking IRs in hypothalamic
astrocytes also had significantly decreased IR mRNA levels (Fig-
ure 7B) and failed to increase activation of Akt in MBH astrocytes
in response to i.p. insulin injection (Figures 7C and 7D). Hypotha-
lamic disruption of IRs in astrocytes of adult mice led to a pheno-
type that corresponded to that of GFAP-IR KO mice. Specifically,
virus-assisted IR knockout in astrocytes of the MBH significantly
impaired the systemic regulatory response to a peripheral
glucose challenge (Figure 7E). Consistent with that observation,
there was a reduction in 2DG-induced hyperphagia in those
mice compared with littermate controls (Figures 7F–7H). These
data collectively suggest that insulin signaling in hypothalamic
astrocytes is required for efficient brain glucose handling.
Astrocytic Insulin Signaling Is Required for Adequate
Insulin and Glucose Uptake into the Brain
To assess if astrocytic insulin signaling, in addition to being
required for the CNS control of peripheral glucose homeostasis,
also participates in the brain control of systemic energy balance,
we compared the energy metabolic phenotype between GFAP-
IR KO and GFAP-IR WT mice. No differences in body weight or
weekly food intake were detected between groups on either
standard chow or on a high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) diet (Fig-
ure S3O). Next, we determined whether astrocytic insulin
signaling may be directly required for CNS glucose availability.
As a first step, we determined the impact of astroglial IR ablation
on glucose uptake into the brain. Both GFAP-IR WT mice and
GFAP-IR KO mice had comparably elevated systemic glucose
levels after glucose challenge (Figure 7I). However, GFAP-IR
KO mice failed to increase insulin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF), and a lower increase in CSF glucose was observed (Fig-
ures 7J and 7K). Accordingly, a lower glucose CSF/peripheral
glucose ratio was found in mice lacking astrocytic insulin recep-
tors exposed to elevated systemic glucose levels (Figure 7L). To
corroborate these observations, we used in vivo 18FDG positron
emission tomography (PET) imaging to visualize and quantify
glucose accumulation in the CNS. GFAP-IR KO mice had
reduced brain glucose appearance in response to increased pe-
ripheral glucose levels (Figures 7M and 7N). Interestingly, the
reduced brain glucose availability in GFAP-IR KO mice was
associated with lowered brain expression of GLUT-1 (Figure 7O).
Altogether, these data indicate key role for astrocytic insulin
signaling in mediating proper glucose and insulin entry to the
brain.
Astrocytic Insulin Signaling Is Expendable for Glucose
Handling within the Brain
Astrocytes are well positioned to act as primary regulators of
local CNS blood flow, nutrient flux, and synaptic function since
they are in direct contact with both blood vessels and neurons
(Magistretti and Pellerin, 1999; Nedergaard et al., 2003; Sofro-
niew and Vinters, 2010). To determine whether insulin signaling
in astrocytes, in addition to regulating glucose influx into the
brain, also directly modifies the responsiveness of hypothalamic
neurons to CNS glucose availability, we assessed the feeding re-
sponses of mice to direct manipulations of CSF glucose concen-
trations. Although mice lacking IRs in hypothalamic astrocytes
showed less reduction in their food intake following i.c.v. glucose
injection, there was no interaction between genotype and the
glucose response between groups (Figure 7P). Accordingly, we
found that, comparable to what occurred in hypothalamic
GFAP-IR WT mice, hypothalamic GFAP-IR KO mice had a
normal hyperphagic response when subjected to selective cen-
tral glucose deprivation by i.c.v. 2DG injection (Figure 7Q). These
data indicate that the lack of insulin signaling in astrocytes does
not affect glucose responsiveness or the counter-regulatory
impact of hypothalamic neurons when glucose fluctuations orig-
inate within the BBB. Collectively, our data demonstrate that as-
trocytic insulin signaling regulates hypothalamic glucose sensing
and systemic metabolism via the control of glucose uptake into
the brain.
DISCUSSION
Here, we propose a novel model for the functional role of insulin
action in the brain. We demonstrated that insulin signaling in
Cell 166, 867–880, August 11, 2016

 astrocytes is required for efficient glucose uptake into the brain
in response to changes in systemic glucose availability. In situa-
tions of impaired astroglial insulin signaling, such as in our genet-
ically engineered models or during diet-induced systemic insulin
resistance, brain glucose uptake becomes less efficient, thereby
compromising hypothalamic glucose sensing and consequently
impairing CNS control of systemic glucose homeostasis. For de-
cades, intense efforts have been made to dissect the exact
neuronal circuits responsible for glucose sensing in the brain.

 however, remained understudied. To uncover a potential role for
insulin action on non-neuronal cells in the brain, we used a series
of ex vivo and in vivo loss-of-function models to dissect IR func-
tion uniquely in astrocytes and to ascertain its relevance for the
CNS control of systemic glucose homeostasis. We discovered
that insulin signaling in astrocytes plays a key role in allowing effi-
cient hypothalamic neuronal responses in order to appropriately
counter fluctuations in systemic glucose availability. Genetic
ablation of IRs from GFAP-expressing cells of adult mice altered
hypothalamic cellular adaptations corresponding to changes in
glucose accessibility in both astrocytes and POMC neurons. In
response to elevated blood glucose levels, mice with reduced
insulin signaling in GFAP-positive cells had hypothalamic astro-
cytes with fewer and smaller mitochondria but increased auto-
phagy-related organelles relative to controls. These cellular
adaptations are consistent with decreased intracellular glucose
availability and lactate release caused by the reduced glucose-
uptake capabilities of astrocytes lacking insulin receptors, as
we had demonstrated ex vivo. Such metabolic response pat-
terns may seem counterintuitive for astrocytes facing a relative
intracellular glucose deficit, but have actually been previously
observed, even in situations of glucose depletion (Brown and
Ransom, 2007). Beta-oxidation of fatty acids was elevated by
the lack of IRs, and was reflected in increased CPT1C expres-
sion and elevated etomoxir-sensitive mitochondrial respiration.
Changes in mitochondrial number and architecture were also
found in hypothalamic POMC neurons, resulting in an elevated
number of disrupted mitochondria and ER-mitochondrial con-
tacts. Recent reports (Dietrich et al., 2013; Schneeberger et al.,
2013) have indicated that cells regulate mitochondrial function
and architecture as a cellular mechanism of adaptation to energy
deficits. This suggests that these glial and neuronal modifica-
tions of mitochondrial function might be caused by reduced
cellular glucose availability. In addition, we found that mice lack-
ing IRs in astrocytes have altered activity and remodeling of hy-
pothalamic glia and neurons when exposed to high blood
glucose levels. This suggests that astrocyte insulin signaling
changes in the hypothalamus may modulate morphology and
function of the tripartite synapse. Further, a lower activation of
POMC neurons was associated with a shift in their synaptic
profile.
The CNS constantly responds to hormones and nutrients,
including glucose, through a rapid rearrangement of hypotha-
lamic connectivity, evoking the signal transduction necessary
for regulating energy homeostasis (Pinto et al., 2004; Zeltser
et al., 2012). Therefore, the differences in glial coverage and
POMC activity and synaptology that we found might predict al-
terations in the regulation of feeding behavior and whole-body
glucose metabolism that arise as a consequence of deficient as-
trocytic insulin signaling. Previous studies have indeed reported
that changes in the glial distribution around hypothalamic POMC
neurons can affect their capacity to respond to variations of
glucose (Fuente-Martı
´n et al., 2012).
To corroborate whether IRs in astrocytes are involved in main-
taining glucose homeostasis, we examined dynamic responses
to altered systemic glucose availability. As expected, mice lack-
ing astrocytic IRs were unable to appropriately curb the normal
hyperphagic responses to fasting or glucoprivation. Likewise,
exogenous glucose did not suppress hyperphagia and failed to
increase c-Fos activity in glucose-sensitive hypothalamic areas.
Consistent with this observation, mice lacking astrocytic IRs
were also unable to efficiently readjust systemic glucose levels
when subjected to hyperglycemia, even when IRs in astrocytes
were deleted selectively in the hypothalamus. Similar impairment
of systemic glucose metabolism was also found after postnatal
ablation of IRs in GLAST-expressing astrocytes. This astrocyte
population partially overlaps with GFAP-positive astrocytes
and GLAST is almost undetectable in neurons or oligodendro-
cytes (Mori et al., 2006). This independent set of studies shows
that the functional relevance of astrocytic insulin signaling in
regulating systemic glucose homeostasis is relevant for more
than one population of astrocytes in the brain.
To explore further whether mice failed to curb overfeeding
in response to glucose due to insufficient cellular sensing or inef-
ficient uptake of glucose into the brain, we measured brain
glucose accumulation in the CSF following peripheral glucose
administration. Glucose and insulin availability were both
reduced in the CSF in mice lacking astrocytic insulin receptors
when subjected to elevated blood glucose levels. Likewise, brain
glucose accumulation was also diminished when brain glucose
levels where monitored using PET imaging. These observations
were paralleled by reduced expression of GLUT-1, the predom-
inant transporter responsible for facilitation of glucose transport
across the BBB (Klepper and Voit, 2002).
Cerebral blood vessels are ensheathed by endothelial cells
that interact with adjacent astrocytes, the combination regu-
lating the entry of nutrients, such as glucose, by changes in
BBB permeability (Alvarez et al., 2013). Although GLUT-1 is
highly expressed along the BBB in both endothelial cells and as-
trocytes (Barros et al., 2007; Simpson et al., 2001), it is more
abundant in astrocytes (Simpson et al., 1999). Previous reports
indicate that GLUT-1 deficiency leads to restricted delivery of
glucose into the brain (Barros et al., 2007; Klepper and Voit,
2002), suggesting that the reduced expression of GLUT-1
observed in the brain of mice without IRs in astrocytes likely de-
creases glucose transport across the BBB, resulting in lower
CSF glucose concentrations. Recently, alterations in GLUT-1
expression at the BBB were associated with the development
of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). In fact, early reductions in GLUT-1 at the BBB have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, promoting neuro-vascular
dysfunction associated with AD progression (Winkler et al.,
2015). Indeed, a link between AD and insulin resistance is

 currently emerging in a model whereby insulin signaling defi-
ciencies contribute to develop the neuropathy and cognitive
decline associated with the development of AD (De Felice
and Ferreira, 2014; Ferreira et al., 2014). Therefore, insulin
signaling/GLUT-1 interventions in astrocytes might represent
useful therapeutic targets to prevent or slow down neurodegen-
eration and cognitive defects associated with the progression of
AD. Finally, we have found that insulin signaling in astrocytes is
expendable for central glucose responsiveness when glucose
fluctuations originate inside the BBB. Central manipulations of
glucose reversed the phenotype of mice lacking astrocytic IR.
That said, it is unknown if the long-lasting effects of a glucose-
transport deficiency into the brain might increase the risk to elicit
alterations in glucose sensitivity. Collectively, our findings indi-
cate that insulin signaling in astrocytes is required to interlink
CNS glucose levels with systemic nutrient availability and is
therefore indispensable for an appropriate regulation of systemic
glucose homeostasis.
Conclusions
Here, we have demonstrated that insulin signaling in astrocytes
co-regulates behavioral responses and metabolic processes via
control of brain glucose uptake to maintain systemic glucose
homeostasis. Specifically, our findings uncover a role for insulin
action in non-neuronal cells of the hypothalamus to regulate
glucose entry into the CNS. Consistent with a model whereby as-
trocytes are functionally involved in both nutrient sensing and the
CNS control of systemic metabolism, we have recently reported
that astrocytes respond to another afferent metabolic hormone,
leptin. Astrocytic leptin deficiency also affects glial structure, en-
sheathment of hypothalamic POMC neurons, and feeding re-
sponses (Kim et al., 2014). We therefore propose a model
whereby, similar to neurons, astrocytes respond directly to a
plethora of nutrient and endocrine signals and, in turn, contribute
to adjusting CNS control of systemic metabolism according to
nutrient availability. This model may offer improved strategies
for the discovery of novel therapeutics for metabolic and neuro-
degenerative diseases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
hGFAP-CreERT2 are Tx-inducible transgenic mice in which the Cre transgene
is expressed under the control of the hGFAP promotor. These mice were
generated on a C57BL/6J background (provided by F.M. Vaccarino, Yale Uni-
versity School of Medicine) and were mated with mice having the sequence
of the IR gene flanked by loxP sites (IRf/f) (generated by Ronald Kahn, Joslin
Diabetes Center). Mouse cohorts for experiments were generated by mating
IRf/f and hGFAP-CreERT2:IRf/f mice.
In parallel, GLAST CreERT2, a knockin mouse line, was obtained and crossed
with IRf/f mice. In this model, the CreERT2 allele is expressed in the locus of the
control of the astrocyte-specific glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST)
locus (Mori et al., 2006). Mice were generated by mating GLASTCreERT2 mice
and GLASTCreERT2: IRf/f mice. All experiments with GLAST-specific KO mouse
models were performed with the GLASTCreERT2 allele in heterozygotes.
To evaluate whether astrocytic mitochondrial or energy signals dereg-
ulation causes systemic glucose metabolic alterations, we crossed hGFAP-
CreERT2 mice with UCP2f/f mice (Jackson Laboratory, stock no. 022394) or
double combination of IRf/f mice and LepRf/f mice (McMinn et al., 2005). Co-
horts of mice were generated by mating UCP2f/f mice and hGFAP-CreERT2:
UCP2f/f mice or IRf/f:LepRf/f mice and hGFAP-CreERT2:IRf/f:LepRf/f mice,
respectively.
To excise loxP sites by Cre recombination (see also the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures), 6-week-old male mice were injected daily with Tx
(10 mg per kg of body weight, i.p.) for 5 days. Tx (Sigma) was dissolved in sun-
flower oil at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml at 37�C and then filter sterilized
and stored for up to 7 days at 4�C in the dark.
All mice were housed on a 12:12-hr light-dark cycle at 22�C with free access
to food and water, unless indicated otherwise. They were maintained on a pel-
leted chow diet (5.6% fat; LM-485, Harlan Teklad) until 12 weeks of age. Sub-
sequently, the mice were either maintained on chow or switched to high-fat,
high-sugar (HFHS: 58% kcal fat w/sucrose; Research Diets) diet for 12 weeks.
All studies were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cajal Institute, Yale
University, and the Helmholtz Centre Munich.
Glucose Tolerance Test, Insulin Tolerance Test, and Insulin
Secretion Test
Mice were subjected to 6 hr of fasting and then injected i.p. with glucose
(2 g/kg body weight of D-glucose in 0.9% saline) for the glucose tolerance
test (GTT) and 0.75 U/kg bw of insulin (0.1 U/ml; Humolog Pen, Eli Lilly) for
the insulin tolerance test (ITT). Tail-blood glucose levels (mg/dl) were
measured with a handheld glucometer (TheraSense Freestyle) at the following
time points: 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after injection. For the insulin secretion
test (IST), blood samples were collected at 0, 15, and 30 min after glucose in-
jection (2 g of glucose /kg body weight) for insulin determination by ELISA.
Feeding Experiments
For all feeding experiments, mice (3 months of age) were individually housed
and fed a chow diet (see also the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Astrocyte-Specific Cre-Mediated Recombination by Adeno-
Associated Virus Bilaterally Injected into the MBH
In order to ablate IRs specifically in astrocytes, we used adeno-associated vi-
rus (AAV) viral particles (serotype 2/5) expressing GFP or Cre protein under
control of the hGFAP promoter (Vector Biolabs). We stereotaxically injected
AAV-hGFAP-GFP (hypothalamic GFAP-IR WT) or AAV-hGFAP-Cre (hypotha-
lamic GFAP-IR KO) particles bilaterally (2 3 109 viral genome particles per
side) into the MBH of IRf/f littermates by using a motorized stereotaxic device
(Neurostar). Stereotaxic coordinates were �1.5 mm posterior and �0.3 mm
lateral to bregma, and �5.8 mm ventral from the dura. Surgeries were
performed using a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 and 7 mg/kg, respec-
tively) as anesthetic agents and Metamizol (50 mg/kg, subcutaneous [s.c.]) fol-
lowed by Meloxicam (1 mg/kg, on 3 consecutive days s.c.) for postoperative
analgesia.
Primary Astrocyte Cultures Collection and Adenovirus-Cre In Vitro
Infection Mediated IR Knockout
Hypothalami and cortices were extracted from IRf/f male mice at postnatal day
1 and were dissociated to single cells as previously described (Fuente-Martı
´n
et al., 2012).
Hypothalamic or cortical astrocyte cultures were seeded onto 6-well plates
in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotic
(penicillin 100 IU/ml and streptomycin 100 micro-g/ml) in 5% CO2 at 37�C. Af-
ter 24 hr, cells were incubated with Adenovirus-GFP (AAV(5)-GFAP(2.2)-GFP,
13 1013 gc/ml; WT) or Adenovirus-Cre-mediated deletion of allele with loxP
sites coexpressed with GFP (AAV(5)-GFAP(2.2)-iCre, 1x 1013 gc/ml; KO)
from Baylor College of Medicine in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 1% FBS
for 6 hr in 5% CO2 at 37�C. To increase the binding of adenovirus to the cell
surface, we added 0.25% of AdenoBOOST (Sirion Biotech). After extensive
washing in PBS, cells were incubated in DMEM-F12 with 10% FBS for 3 days.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Two groups
were compared by using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. Two-way
ANOVA was performed to detect significant interactions between genotype
and treatment (tamoxifen, glucose, insulin, or 2DG), and multiple comparisons

 were analyzed following Bonferroni’s post hoc tests. Two-way repeated mea-
sures ANOVA was performed to detect significant interactions between geno-
type and time, and multiple comparisons were analyzed following Bonferroni’s
post hoc tests. p values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. All results
