Summary
Transient receptor potential melastatin subfamily 3 (TRPM3) ion channels
play a role in calcium (Ca21) cell signalling. Reduced TRPM3 protein
expression
has been
identified in
chronic
fatigue
syndrome/myalgic
encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) patients. However, the significance of TRPM3
and association with intracellular Ca21 mobilization has yet to be
determined. Fifteen CFS/ME patients (mean age 48�82 6 9�83 years) and 25
healthy controls (mean age 39�2 6 12�12 years) were examined. Isolated
natural killer (NK) cells were labelled with fluorescent antibodies to
determine TRPM3, CD107a and CD69 receptors on CD56dimCD161NK
cells and CD56brightCD16dim/– NK cells. Ca21 flux and NK cytotoxicity
activity was measured under various stimulants, including pregnenolone
sulphate (PregS), thapsigargin (TG), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB)
and
ionomycin.
Unstimulated
CD56brightCD16dim/–
NK
cells
showed
significantly reduced TRPM3 receptors in CFS/ME compared with healthy
controls (HC). Ca21 flux showed no significant difference between groups.
Moreover, PregS-stimulated CD56brightCD16dim/–NK cells showed a significant
increase in Ca21 flux in CFS/ME patients compared with HC. By comparison,
unstimulated CD56dimCD161 NK cells showed no significant difference in
both Ca21 flux and TRPM3 expression. PregS-stimulated CD56dimCD161 NK
cells increased TRPM3 expression significantly in CFS/ME, but this was not
associated with a significant increase in Ca21 flux. Furthermore, TG-stimulated
CD56dimCD161 NK cells increased K562 cell lysis prior to PregS stimulation in
CFS/ME patients compared with HC. Differential expression of TRPM3 and
Ca21 flux between NK cell subtypes may provide evidence for their role in the
pathomechanism involving NK cell cytotoxicity activity in CFS/ME.

Introduction
Chronic
fatigue
syndrome/myalgic
encephalomyelitis
(CFS/ME) is a complex illness presenting with debilitating
post-exertional malaise accompanied by other neurological,
immunological, autonomic and ion transport impairments
[1,2]. The most consistent biological evidence reported in
CFS/ME has been reduced natural killer (NK) cell cytotox-
icity (reviewed by Stayer et al. [3]).
NK cells belong to the innate immune system and are
distinguished
into
two
main
subsets
known
as
CD56brightCD16dim/– NK cells and CD56dimCD161 NK
cells. CD56brightCD16dim/– NK cells are predominately
immunosurveillance cells with potent cytokine production,
whereas CD56dimCD161 NK cells are cytotoxic and kill
infected, tumour or ‘missing self’ cells [4].
Activated NK cells increase CD69 receptors and may be
modulated by protein kinase C (PKC) and protein tyrosine
kinases [5]. NK cells from CFS/ME patients have been
reported to have a significant reduction in CD69 receptors
after stimulation [6]. When NK cells come into contact
with virus-infected or tumour cells, an immune synapse is

 formed and degranulation is activated. Degranulation is
detected when NK cells increase the lysosome-associated
membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1, CD107a) receptor [7]. NK
cells require Ca21 to regulate cellular functions, which play
a major role in signalling pathways that are essential for
development of immune synapse formation, cytokine pro-
duction and cytotoxic activity [8].
Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels modu-
late ion entry in the cell plasma membrane, and are
expressed differentially on tissues throughout the body.
Their dysfunction has been associated with several diseases,
such as cancer, glomerulosclerosis and polycystic kidney
disease [9]. Transient receptor potential melastatin 3 ion
channels
(TRPM3)
are
transmembrane
ion
channels
belonging to the melastatin subfamily of TRP cation ion
channels [10,11]. There are seven isotypes identified in the
human TRPM3 gene; in particular, the TRPM3a2 isotype
has been characterized as having a Ca21 and Mg21 ion-
conducting
pore
[12,13].
TRPM3
ion
channels
are
expressed in various tissues, predominantly in sensory neu-
rones, kidney, brain, pituitary gland and pancreas. While
expressed ubiquitously in mammalian cells, the roles and
functions of TRPM3 have yet to be determined in immune
cells [10]. TRPM3 ion channels are activated selectively by
a potent neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulphate (PregS) [14].
Pregnenolone is synthesized from cholesterol by many tis-
sues, including adrenal glands, brain and skin. These tissues
have been reported to express TRPM3 [10]. Physiologically,
PregS plays a role in both the central nervous system and
immune system, which include improvement of memory
and cognitive function, enhanced neuronal myelination,
activation of neurotransmitter-gated channels, modulation
of glutamate–nitric oxide–guanosine 30,50-(cyclic) phos-
phate pathways, regulation of insulin secretion and the
management of noxious pain [14,15].
Recently, TRPM3 ion channels were identified on NK
cells and B cells from CFS/ME patients [16], and these cells
were shown to have significantly reduced expression of the
TRPM3 receptor on the cell surface compared with healthy
controls (HC) [17]. However, the role of TRPM3 in terms
of receptor number and Ca21 mobilization following
stimulants, such as PregS on NK cell function, has not been
investigated in CFS/ME patients. Therefore, the objective
of this study was to determine the effects of PregS on
TRPM3, including CD69 and CD107a receptor expression
in NK cells. Additionally, we investigated intracellular Ca21
mobilization and cytotoxic activity of NK cells after PregS
treatment in HC and CFS/ME patients.
Materials and methods
Participants
CFS/ME patients meeting the Fukuda definition were
included into the study, along with HC [2]. All participants
were recruited between the ages of 18 and 65 years, with no
previous history of smoking or chronic disease (auto-
immune diseases, cardiac diseases and primary psychologi-
cal
disorders).
Participants
were
further
excluded
if
pregnant, breast feeding or taking hormone therapy and
pharmaceutical immunoregulatory medications. Alterna-
tively, participants on immunoregulatory medications were
included into the study if medications were discontinued 2
weeks prior to their blood collection.
Participants living in the South East Queensland region
of Australia donated 80 ml of blood between 8:00 a.m. and
10:30 a.m. Seventy ml of blood was used to isolate NK cells
for further study, while the remaining 10 ml was used for
routine pathology screening to help determine any under-
lying illness. Pathology results included a full blood cell
count, electrolytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-
reactive protein, dehydroepiandrosterone, adrenocortico-
trophic hormone and cortisol. All participants completed a
self-reported questionnaire on their current symptoms,
which also included the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)
and WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.9 (WHO DAS
20.0) to assess participants’ physical health.
Drugs and antibodies
In-vitro assays consisted of using the following drugs at a
final concentration of 1 lM ionomycin, 50 lM 2-
aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), 1�42 lM thapsigar-
gin (TG) and 1�35 lM PregS. All drugs were purchased
from Bio-Techne (Tocris Bioscience, Sussex, UK) except
ionomycin, which was purchased from Sigma (Mansfield,
Victoria, Australia). Antibodies CD3, CD56, CD16, CD69
and CD107a were purchased from Beckon Dickinson Bio-
science (Miami, FL, USA). TRPM3 primary and secondary
antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Dallas, TX, USA). Isotypes were used to determine nega-
tive cell populations. TRPM3 primary antibody was
blocked by peptide amino acids that bind to the 816-897aa
of TRPM3 of human origin (Accession number Q9HCF6)
and binds to the extracellular domain to determine non-
specific binding.
NK cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated
from ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) whole blood
by centrifugation over a density gradient medium (Ficoll;
GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), followed by magnetic
isolation
for
unlabelled
NK
cells
using
EasySep,
as
described by the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated NK
cells from PBMCs were determined to be 90�4% 6 3�82
purity for CFS/ME patients and 91�6% 6 5�61 for HC. Iso-
lated NK cells were identified as CD56brightCD16–/dim and
CD56dimCD161 NK cells.

 TRPM3, CD69 and CD107a surface expression on NK
cells
TRPM3 expression on resting NK cell subsets was identified
as described previously [16]. Briefly, NK cells were labelled
with CD3, CD56, CD16 and primary TRPM3 antibodies for
30 min at room temperature. NK cells were washed and
stained with TRPM3 secondary antibody for 30 min. Stimu-
lated NK cells were assessed further in the presence of PregS,
ionomycin, 2APB 1 PregS and TG 1 PregS for 4 h at 37˚C.
Cells were stained with CD69, CD107a and TRPM3 primary
antibody for 30 min to determine CD69, CD107a and
TRPM3 receptor expression on CD56brightCD16dim/– NK cells
and CD56dimCD161 NK cell subpopulations. True cell count-
ing beads were used to calculate NK cell concentration as well
as absolute cell counts and was determined using the manu-
facturer’s instructions outlined in the following formula:

Cytoplasmic Ca21 in NK cells
Ca21 flux was performed as described previously [16].
Briefly, Ca21 mobilization in NK cells was measured in the
presence of ionomycin, 2-APB and TG. Ionomycin is an
ionopore that raises cytoplasmic Ca21 levels independently
of activated receptors, whereas 2-APB and TG inhibit
Ca21-dependent receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER). 2-APB prevent the release of intracellular Ca21 stores
compared to TG, which inhibit the replenishment of the
Ca21 into intracellular stores (Fig. 1). Furthermore, assess-
ment of Ca21 influx-dependent TRPM3 receptors was
determined using PregS. Isolated NK phenotypes were
stimulated with PregS. Following this, NK cells were prein-
cubated with either TG or 2APB prior to PregS stimulation.
Cells were stimulated for 5 min and recorded in real time
on flow cytometry.
NK cytotoxic activity
NK cell cytotoxicity baseline measurements were per-
formed using 25 : 1, 12 : 1, 6 : 1 and 1 : 1 effector to target
ratios, as described previously [18]. NK cell cytotoxicity
activity was measured indirectly through the percentage of

 apoptotic K562 cells. The NK cells were stimulated for 20
min in the presence of ionomycin, TG, 2APB and PregS or
a combination of TG 1 PregS and 2APB 1 PregS. Cells
were washed and plated with K562 cells at a 1 : 1 ratio, fol-
lowed by incubation for 4 h at 37˚C. K562 cells were
stained with annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-
AAD) to determine K562 cell viability. K562 cell viability
was determined into four stages; live/viable K562 cells
(annexin V– 7AAD–), K562 cells undergoing early stage
apoptosis (annexin V1 7AAD–), late stage apoptosis
(annexin V1 7AAD1) and dead K562 cells (annexin V–
7AAD1). K562 cell death was calculated as described previ-
ously [18] and outlined below.

Data and statistical analyses
Data were exported from FacDiva version 8.1 and analysed
using FlowJo software version 10 (TreeStar, Inc., Ashland, OR,
USA). Data were quantified using SPSS version 22.2 software
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Multivariate analysis of var-
iance (MANOVA) was performed to determine TRPM3 receptor
expression in various stimulation conditions between HC and
CFS/ME groups, as well as within each group. The Mann–
Whitney statistical U-test was used to determine the specific
relationship
effects
between
each
stimulant
(PregS,
TG 1 PregS and 2APB 1 PregS) on TRPM3, CD69 and
CD107a surface expression on NK cell subsets from CFS/ME
patients and HC. The Gaussian smoothing method was
applied on the Ca21 flux response curve, prior to analyses of
area under the curve (AUC), time of peak and slope. NK cell
cytotoxic activity was measured by the percentage of K562 cell
deaths as described by Aubry et al. [18]. Statistical significance
was reported at P< 0�05.
Results
Participants
A total of 40 participants were included in this investiga-
tion, 25 of which were HC and 15 were CFS/ME. The par-
ticipants’ demographic and standard serological results
were recorded (Table 1). There were no significant differen-
ces in gender, body mass index (BMI), full blood counts,
electrolytes, stress hormones or inflammatory markers
between
HC
and
CFS/ME.
There
was
a
significant
between-group difference for age, as CFS/ME patients were
significantly older than HC.
CFS/ME patients reported greater impairment compared
with HC in all SF-36 subscales (lower scores indicate
greater impairment; P < 0�05) and WHO DAS 2.0 subscales
(higher scores indicate greater impairment; P < 0�05), as
shown in Table 1. Significantly reduced SF-36 scores and
elevated WHO DAS 2.0 scores have been observed previ-
ously in other CFS/ME studies [19–21].
TRPM3 expressed on CD56brightCD16–/dim NK cells
CFS/ME had significantly reduced expression for TRPM3
receptors without stimulation in CD56brightCD16–/dim NK
cells compared with HC (Fig. 2a–c) Similarly, TG-
stimulated CD56brightCD16–/dim NK cells had depleted
intracellular Ca21 stores and significantly reduced TRPM3
receptor expression in CFS/ME compared with HC (Fig.
2b). Overall, CD56brightCD16–/dim NK cells from both
groups (CFS/ME and HC) had increased TRPM3 receptors
after depletion of intracellular Ca21 stores with TG and/or
in combination with activating TRPM3 receptor with
PregS, when compared without stimulation (Fig. 2b).
Furthermore, inhibiting inositol trisphosphate receptor
(IP3R) with 2APB and/or in combination with activating the
TRPM3 receptor with PregS in CD56brightCD16–/dimTRPM31
NK cells was not significantly different between or within each
HC and CFS group (Fig. 2c).
TRPM3 expressed on CD56dimCD161 NK cells
There was no significant between-group difference in
TRPM3 expression without stimulation of CD56dimCD161
NK cells. However, there was a significant between-group
difference (CFS/ME and HC) in TRPM3 expression follow-
ing PregS stimulation (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, within the
HC group there was a significant increase in TRPM3 ion
channels on PregS-stimulated CD56dimCD161 NK cells
compared without stimulation. The CFS/ME group showed
no significant difference in TRPM3 ion channel numbers
in CD56dimCD161 NK cells after PregS stimulation. In
addition, ionomycin- stimulated CD56dimCD161 NK cells
within HC and CFS/ME groups demonstrated a significant
increase in TRPM3 ion channels (Fig. 2d). Similarly,
CD56dimCD161TRPM31 NK cells within both groups
increased TRPM3 receptors with TG 1 PregS, TG and ion-
omycin when compared without stimulation. By compari-
son, no significant difference was observed after 2APB or
2APB 1 PregS stimulation between or within each of the
groups (HC and CFS/ME) (Fig. 2f).

 Activation markers on NK cell subsets
There was no significant difference in either CD56bright
CD16–/dim or CD56dimCD161 NK cells in CD107a and
CD69 receptors between groups (data not shown). How-
ever, both NK cell subsets within groups showed no signifi-
cant
difference
in
CD69
receptor
numbers
between
unstimulation and PregS. There was a significant reduction
of CD69 receptor after TG and TG 1 PregS stimulations
(Fig. S1). CD56dimCD161 NK cells within groups showed a
further reduction of CD69 receptor after 2APB and iono-
mycin compared without stimulation.
Ca21 mobilization in NK cell subsets was determined
using FlowJo, as shown in Fig. 3. Each subset Ca21
response curve was reported as peak time (peak t) to deter-
mine the time for a reaction to reach its maximum. Slope
is determined as follows: a positive slope implies that the
y-axis value is increasing over the time-period, while a
negative value implies that it is decreasing. The AUC is

Intracellular Ca21 mobilization
CD56bright CD16dim/– NK cell Ca21 flux showed signifi-
cantly increased AUC in CFS/ME compared with controls
after PregS (Fig. 4a). There was no significant difference in
the AUC in CD56dimCD161TRPM31 NK cells (Fig. 4b).
Overall, within both groups there was an increase in AUC
after PregS stimulation compared with no stimulation.

Discussion
Previous investigations have reported significant reductions
in NK cell cytotoxic activity in CFS/ME patients, and the
current investigation supports those findings [16]. The cur-
rent investigation also confirms our previous results of sig-
nificantly reduced TRPM3 receptors on NK cells as well as
significantly reduced intracellular Ca21 mobilization in iso-
lated NK cells [16]. The current investigation showed inhi-
bition of the ER Ca21/ATPase pump and depletion of
intracellular
Ca21
stores
followed
by
PregS-activated
TRPM3 increased cytotoxic activity in NK cells from CFS/
ME patients (Fig. 6).
TRPM3 receptors are constitutively open [10,12,22] and
are activated by steroids [15], hypotonic cell swelling and
Ca21 store depletion [10], but these findings are inconsis-
tent [22]. Our results support increased TRPM3 surface
protein expression when intracellular Ca21 stores are
depleted through inhibition of the ER Ca21/ATPase pump
when activated by PregS.
Under no stimulation, CD56brightCD16dim/–TRPM31
NK cells from CFS/ME demonstrated significantly lower
TRPM3 surface expression compared with HC, which is
consistent with previous findings [16]. TRPM3 can be acti-
vated by PregS concentration in the range of 0�1–5 lM,
corresponding to physiological PregS serum concentrations
[23,24]. At 1�35 lM PregS (within physiological range),
CD56brightCD16dim/–TRPM31 NK cells did not change
between groups. However, these cells increased intracellular
Ca21 significantly compared with HC. In comparison,
PregS-stimulated
CD56dimCD161
NK
cells
increased
TRPM3 receptor expression significantly and may not be
associated with Ca21 flux in CFS/ME patients. This is
based on the assumption that an increase in TRPM3 recep-
tor should result in an increase in cytoplasmic Ca21 levels.
A possible rationale for this finding may be that TRPM3
ion channels expressed on CD56dimCD161 NK cells have
impaired Ca21 flux function, which is compensated by
increasing their surface expression. Moreover, it may be
suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
identified in TRPM3 genomic DNA from PBMCs and NK
cells in CFS/ME patients result in impaired protein expres-
sion and reduced TRPM3 Ca21 function [17]. Importantly,
when Ca21 influx is prevented or reduced, an immunologi-
cal synapse is not formed, preventing the formation of
mitotic spindles for cytoskeleton movement to facilitate the
secretory vesicles leading to abnormal lysis of target cells
[25]. The deficits identified above may thus contribute to
impaired lysis of CFS/ME NK cells.
Interestingly, our study supports the finding that iono-
mycin alone does not improve NK cytotoxic activity, but it
elevates TRPM3 expression on CD56dimCD161 NK cells
compared with HC. TRPM3 expression is increased when
ionomycin raises cytosolic Ca21 through phospholipase C-
dependent mobilization of Ca21 stores [26]. Prolonged
treatment with ionomycin has been reported previously to
render NK cells hyporesponsive, and hence these cells prob-
ably require a higher signal intensity to mount an effective
response [27].
CFS/ME
patients
have
significantly
decreased
extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in CD56dimCD161
NK cells and significantly increased mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 and p38 in CD56brightCD16dim/– NK
cells following incubation with K562 cells [28]. ERK 1/2 is acti-
vated in a P13K-dependent manner that may also be associated
with cytoplasmic Ca21 ion levels through activation of TRPM3
[10]. In the absence of phosphatidylinositol biphosphate
TRPM3 is not activated, resulting in reduced cytosolic Ca21
[29]. Stimulating CD56dimCD161 NK cells with TG prior to
PregS resulted in a significant elevation in cytotoxic activity.

 These findings are noteworthy, as it has been reported that
depleting intracellular stores with TG increases activity of ERK.
Phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 allows polarization of secretory
granules for degranulation and therefore increased NK cell lysis
in CFS patients [30–32].
CFS/ME patients have been reported to have a signifi-
cant reduction in CD69 expression on T cells and NK cells
upon stimulation, which may correspond to impaired
initial cell activation through a PKC-dependent signalling
pathway [6]. However, this current investigation found no
significant difference between groups. In vitro, degranula-
tion is activated in NK cells when an immunosynapse is
formed between NK cells and K562 tumour cells [7,33].
During degranulation, cytolytic granules containing lytic
proteins are released and CD107a receptors are expressed
on the NK cell surface. In the current investigation CD107a
was not significantly different between groups, and this
finding is supported by others [28]. PKC is activated by ele-
vated intracellular Ca21 concentration, which activates
ERK
signalling
pathways
and
transcription
factors
[32,34,35]. Inhibition of PKC has been shown to impaired
signaling pathways that activate TRPM3-induced transcrip-
tion factor activator protein-1 (AP-1) [35]. Our results also
show that CD69 is reduced when NK cells are stimulated
with TG. However, in combination with PregS stimulation,
which facilitates an increase in cytoplasmic Ca21 and acti-
vates PKC and ERK signalling pathways, NK cell cytotoxic
activity in CFS/ME patients increased.
The current investigation confirms our previous reports
of significant changes in TRPM3 receptor numbers in NK
cells in CFS/ME. Following PregS stimulation, however,
there was no significant increase in Ca21 mobilization in
CD56dimCD161 NK cells from CFS/ME patients. These
novel findings suggest that TRPM3 receptor function is
impaired, resulting in impaired Ca21 mobilization with
adverse consequences for homeostasis. As TRPM3 recep-
tors are expressed throughout the human body, the current
findings suggest that impaired TRPM3 function may play a
significant role in the multisystemic pathomechanism of
CFS/ME. Other TRP receptors, such as TRPM1, may possi-
bly have a similar role in CFS/ME pathomechanism due to
its sequence homology with TRPM3; however, further inves-
tigation is warranted [36]. We have previously identified

 genomic changes in other TRPs and autonomic receptors,
which should be investigated further [17,37,38].
The results of this study are considered preliminary, and
are limited by our small sample size. Accordingly, we found
that our CFS/ME patients were older compared with HC;
however, routine pathological screening showed no differ-
ence between groups. As CFS/ME is a heterogeneous condi-
tion, future directions aim to optimize these findings in a
larger cohort. In this pilot study, we characterized our CFS/
ME patients by reduced NK cytotoxic activity compared
with HC. We further aimed to capture those with signifi-
cant functional impairment according to SF-36 and WHO
DAS 2.0 disability scores. To define further the role of
TRPM3 and Ca21, future study will examine findings in
distinct clinical phenotypes of CFS/ME to elucidate the dis-
tinct physiological effects of this mechanism.
Conclusions
TRPM3 activity and function in NK cells in CFS/ME
patients is impaired, resulting in changes in Ca21 ion con-
centration in the cytosol and intracellular stores which
may, in turn, change the NK cells’ activation threshold.
Cytotoxic NK cells from CFS/ME patients may attempt to
compensate for impaired TRPM3 receptors by increasing
intracellular Ca21 for sufficient NK cell activity. Increasing
Ca21 concentrations to activate the ERK signalling pathway
may help to improve NK cell cytotoxicity in CFS/ME.
Improvement of Ca21-dependent NK activity may help to
improve the immune system in CFS/ME patients to facili-
tate a quicker response to eliminate pathogens. Moreover,
improvement of cell-to-cell interaction could improve the
development of antigen-specific memory cells. This investi-
gation may inform the pathomechanism of reduced NK
cell cytotoxicity in CFS/ME patients.
