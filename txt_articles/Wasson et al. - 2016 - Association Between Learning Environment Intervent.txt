Abstract
Importance—There are concerns about the current quality of undergraduate medical education 
(UME) and its effect on students’ well-being.
Objective—This systematic review was designed to identify best practices for UME learning 
environment interventions that are associated with improved emotional well-being of students.
Data Sources—Learning environment interventions were identified by searching the biomedical 
electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the ERIC database 
from the database inception dates to October 2016. Studies examined any intervention designed to 
promote medical students’ emotional well-being in the setting of a US academic medical school, 
with an outcome defined as students’ reports of well-being as assessed by surveys, semistructured 
interviews, or other quantitative methods.
Data Extraction and Synthesis—Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and 
full-text articles. Data were extracted into tables to summarize results. Study quality was assessed 
by the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERQSI), which has a possible 
range of 5–18; higher scores indicate higher design and methods quality, and a score of ≥ 14 
indicates a high-quality study.
Findings—Twenty-eight articles including at least 8224 participants met eligibility criteria. 
Study designs included single-group cross-sectional or post-test only (n=10), single-group pre-/
post-test (n=2), nonrandomized two-group (n=13), and randomized clinical trial (n=3); 93% were

 conducted at a single site, and the mean MERSQI score for all studies was 10.3 (range 5–13, 
SD=2.11). Studies encompassed a variety of types of interventions, including those focused on 
pass/fail grading systems (n=3, mean MERSQI=12.0), mental health programs (n=4, 
MERSQI=11.9), mind-body skills programs (n=7, MERSQI=11.2), curriculum structure (n=3, 
MERSQI=9.5), multicomponent program reform (n=5, MERSQI=9.4), wellness programs (n=4, 
MERSQI=9.0), and advising/mentoring programs (n=3, MERSQI=8.2).
Conclusions and Relevance—In this systematic review, limited evidence suggested that some 
specific learning environment interventions were associated with improved emotional well-being 
among medical students. However, the overall quality of the evidence was low, highlighting the 
need for high-quality medical education research.

Introduction
Medical schools strive to educate knowledgeable, caring, and professional physicians and 
pay particular attention to opportunities for improving the undergraduate medical education 
(UME) learning environment as they realize its influence on the education of future 
physicians.1
A critical element of the learning environment is its effect on student well-being. Although 
matriculating US medical students begin training with significantly lower rates of depression 
and burnout and report better mental and emotional quality of life than other college-
educated young adults,2 their reported well-being decreases during the UME years. The 
reported rate of moderate to severe depression is approximately 14% and of burnout 
symptoms is 52%—higher than reported by other graduate students or population control 
samples.3,4 Studies indicate that up to 11% of medical students report suicidal ideation.5
The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) includes in its vision for 
improving medical education “the health and well-being of learners.”6 This systematic 
review evaluated the association between UME learning environment interventions and the 
emotional well-being of students.
Methods
Search strategy
Potentially relevant articles were identified by searching the biomedical electronic databases 
Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the ERIC database from the 
database inception dates to October 2016 (Appendix A). Additional records were identified 
by scanning the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews published between May 2011 
and October 2016, by using the Similar Articles feature in PubMed and the Cited Reference 
Search in the Web of Science. We searched for grey literature (“that which is produced on all 
levels of government, academics, business and industry in print and electronic formats, but

 which is not controlled by commercial publishers”)7 through ongoing trial registries, 
academic dissertations, and websites of relevant organizations (eg, AAMC) (Appendix A).
Selection criteria
Studies must have examined the outcomes associated with any intervention aiming to 
promote students’ emotional well-being in the setting of an academic US medical school. 
The well-being outcome had to be obtained through surveys, semistructured interviews, or 
other quantitative methods. Open-ended response formats were excluded because their 
methodologic quality could not be appraised with the methodology rating used in this 
review. Medical education interventions measured with open-ended responses are reviewed 
and appraised elsewhere.8,9
Methodology quality rating
Study quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument 
(MERSQI), which was developed to appraise the methodologic quality of quantitative 
medical education research.10 MERSQI scores have been positively correlated with editorial 
decisions to publish and with the presence of external funding for the research conducted.10 
The instrument is based on 10 design and methods criteria: study design, number of 
institutions studied, response rate, data type, internal structure, content validity, criterion 
validity, appropriateness of data analysis, complexity of analysis, and outcome level. These 
criteria form six domains, each with a maximum score of 3 and a minimum of 0 or 1, that 
sum to produce a total score that ranges from 5 to 18.
The MERSQI was preferred to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale-Education (NOS-E), another 
assessment tool for medical education research quality, because it was found to have 
generally higher interrater reliability (0.68–0.89)11 than the NOS-E. This may be due to its 
more objective assessments of design strengths and weaknesses, although it omits items on 
the comparability of groups and blinding11 Although there are no defined cut-off values 
differentiating high-quality from low-quality study methods, one study used a MERSQI 
score of ≥ 14.0 as an a priori cutoff of high quality.12
Data extraction
Two review authors independently scanned the title or abstract of all search results to 
determine which studies required further assessment, investigated all potentially relevant 
articles as full text, selected studies to include in this review, assigned a MERSQI score for 
each, and calculated a mean quality score across studies (Table 1). Data disagreements were 
resolved by consultation with the third and fourth review authors. The original intention 
noted in the study protocol was to conduct a meta-analysis, but due to the considerable 
variation in the interventions, study designs, and outcomes, we did not pool the studies 
quantitatively, as they were judged to not be combinable.13
Results
The literature search yielded 4207 publications, of which 28 met the eligibility criteria for 
this systematic review (Figure 1). Publications were excluded if they were irrelevant or did

 not meet the inclusion criteria; for example, we excluded publications that focused on 
medical residents rather than medical students, measured academic rather than well-being 
outcomes, or that contained interventions not focused on the learning environment. The 
studies included at least 8224 (one study did not report a sample size) student participants 
and encompassed a variety of designs, including single-group, cross-sectional or post-test 
only (n=10), single-group pre-/post-test (n=2), nonrandomized two-group (n=13), and 
randomized clinical trial (RCT) (n=3) designs; 96% were conducted at a single site. They 
had a wide range of approaches to improving students’ well-being that are categorized and 
described below (pass-fail [P/F] grading systems [n=3], mental health programs [n=4], 
mind-body skills education/training [n=7], curriculum structure [n=3], multicomponent 
program reform [n=5], wellness programs [n=4], and group-based faculty advisor/mentor 
programs [n=3]). Individual study results are described below and statistical details are 
provided for many key findings; additional results and methods are detailed in Tables 1 and 
2. The included studies’ methodologic rigor varied, with MERSQI scores ranging from 5.0 
to 13.0 (mean 10.3, SD=2.11, n=28). The mean MERSQI score in published medical 
education studies, as assessed in another review, was 10.0.10 The highest methodology 
studies crossed all types of interventions and all types of outcome measures. The highest 
scored categories tested interventions involving P/F grading, mental health programs, and 
mind-body skills education/training.
Pass/fail grading system (average MERSQI=12.0)
Bloodgood et al14 (n=281, MERSQI=11.5) and Rohe et al15 (n=81, MERSQI=12.0) each 
described that a cohort of preclinical students graded according to a P/F grading system, 
compared with an earlier student cohort evaluated according to a 5-interval grading system 
(A/B/C/D/F), reported statistically significantly better well-being. They reported less 
anxiety, depression,14 and stress,15 and better well-being14 and group cohesion scores at 
various study timepoints.15 These two studies differed, however, in the durability of 
improvements. Bloodgood et al14 found no difference at 2 years between the cohort of 
students with a 2-year P/F system compared to a cohort of students with a 5-interval system 
on measures of anxiety (General Well-Being Schedule [GWB]16 anxiety subscore range 3–
28; lower scores indicate more severe distress; there is no accepted minimum clinically 
important difference [MCID]; M=14.08 vs. 14.20; P=.86), depression (GWB16 depression 
subscore range 2–22; lower scores indicate more severe distress; there is no accepted MCID; 
M=15.56 vs. 15.35; P=0.71), or well-being (GWB16 well-being subscore range 3–18; lower 
scores indicate more severe distress; there is no accepted MCID; M=10.59 vs. 10.40; P=.67). 
Rohe et al15 did report a persistent difference at 2 years between grading cohorts on a 
measure of stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]17 range 0–40; higher score indicates more 
stress; there is no accepted MCID; M[SD]=15.8 [6.8] vs. 20.5 [7.8]; P=.01) and speculated 
this difference was due to continuing reports of elevated group cohesion (Perceived 
Cohesion Scale18 range 0–36; higher scores indicate more cohesion; there is no accepted 
MCID; M[SD]=33.8 [8.0] vs. 29.0 [9.9]; P=.02).
Reed et al19 (n=2056, MERSQI=12.5) compared well-being among students at different 
medical schools with grading systems that were categorized as either 3+-interval (eg, 
honors/P/F) or P/F and found that 3+-interval systems were associated with statistically

 significantly more stress (β=1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05–2.78; P<.001) and 
burnout (odds ratio [OR]=1.58; 95% CI, 1.24–2.01; P<.001), and a higher likelihood of 
considering withdrawing from medical school (OR=1.91; 95% CI, 1.30–2.80; P=.001).
Mental health programs (MERSQI=11.9)
Thompson et al20 (n=120, MERSQI=11.5) evaluated a multipronged program aimed at 
reducing mental health stigma and making services more accessible. The study found that 
significantly smaller proportions of the student cohort exposed to the program compared 
with the prior student cohort reported symptoms of mild or probable depression (14/58 
(24.1%) vs. 26/44 (59.1%); P<.01) and suicidal ideation (1/33 (3.0%) vs. 13/43 (30.2%); P<.
001).22 Seritan et al21 (n=not reported, MERSQI=11.5) examined a different multipronged 
mental health/wellness program offering prevention, support, and enhanced clinical services, 
which was associated with improved student ratings of personal counseling, mental health, 
and stress management services.21 Percentages of self-referral to mental health services 
increased from a baseline rate of 50% to a postintervention rate of 91%. For both findings, 
statistical significance was not reported.21
Two studies evaluated programs consisting of education and a web-based mental health 
screening survey to facilitate students’ use of mental health services. Downs et al22 (n=1008, 
MERSQI = 13.0) described a program that was associated with an increase in mental health 
service utilization and a decrease in assessed suicide risk during the 4 years that was not 
statistically significant, perhaps due to low screening rates (34%). Moutier et al23 (n=498, 
MERSQI = 11.5) reported that that 11% of medical students exposed to another educational 
program were referred to a mental health professional, though no comparison was provided 
and the screening rate was also low (27%).
Mind-body skills education/training programs (MERSQI=11.3)
Two RCTs evaluated mind-body programs. Erogul et al24 (n=58, MERSQI=12.0) found that 
students randomized to attend a mindfulness program reported a significant reduction in 
stress after intervention (PSS17 range 0–40; higher score indicates more stress; there is no 
accepted MCID; Mchange=3.63; 95% CI, 0.37–6.89; P=.03) but not at 6-month follow-up 
(Mchange=2.91; 95% CI, −0.37–6.19; P=.08). However, students in the mind-body program 
reported a significant increase in self-compassion that persisted at 6-month follow-up (Self-
Compassion Scale [SCS]25 range 0–5; higher score indicates more self-compassion; there is 
no accepted MCID; Mchange=0.56; 95% CI, 0.25–0.87; P=.001).24 In the study by 
Holtzworth-Munroe et al26 (n=40, MERSQI=10.0), students randomized to a mind-body 
program were reported to have significantly more awareness of tension (F[5, 18]=37.16; P<.
001), better ability to deal with school stress (F[5,18]=5.05; P<.04), and less test anxiety at 
10-week follow-up (F[1,22]=10.42; P<.005).
Three studies evaluated mind-body programs using a pre-/post-test design with 
nonrandomized control groups. Kraemer et al27 (n=52, MERSQI=12.0) found that students 
undergoing mind-body skills training reported significantly improved distress tolerance 
(Distress Tolerance Scale-G28 range 1–5; higher scores indicate higher levels of distress 
tolerance; there is no accepted MCID; Mchange=0.53; 95% CI, .92 to .14; P=0.01); no

 difference was found for the control group. Rosenzweig et al29 (n=302, MERSQI=11.0) 
described a mindfulness-based stress reduction program associated with significant 
improvements in total mood disturbance (Profile of Mood States30 range 0–200; higher 
scores indicate higher mood disturbance; there is no accepted MCID; intervention group pre-
M[SD]=38.7 [33.3] vs. post-M=31.8 [33.89]; P=0.05; control group pre-M[SD]=28.0 [31.2] 
vs. post-M=38.6 [32.8]; P<0.001; interaction P<.001). Finkelstein et al31 (n=72, 
MERSQI=11.0) found a significant group-time interaction association with improved 
anxiety (F[1,2]=3.95; P<.05).
Two studies evaluating medical student mind-body programs with a pre-/post-test design 
without a control group also reported associations with significant improvements in well-
being. Greeson et al32 (n=44, MERSQI=11.5) reported improved stress (PSS17 range 0–40; 
higher score indicates more stress; there is no accepted MCID; pre-M[SD]=29.73 [9.61]; 
post-M[SD]=20.25 [9.03]; t33=7.90; P<.001; d=1.38) and mindfulness (pre-M[SD]=29.24 
[5.54]; post-M[SD]=33.88 [6.13]; t33=5.27; P<.001; d=0.92). Bond et al33 (n=27, 
MERSQI=11.5) reported improved self-regulation (Self Regulation Questionnaire34 range 
1–5; higher score indicates more self-regulation; there is no accepted MCID; Mchange[SD]= 
0.13 [0.20]; P=.003; d=−0.41) and self-compassion (SCS25 range 0–5; higher score indicates 
more self-compassion; there is no accepted MCID; Mchange[SD]=0.28 [0.61]; P=.04; d=
−0.55).
Curriculum structure (MERSQI=9.5)
Elements of curriculum structure targeted by studies identified in this review were varied. 
Reed et al19 (n=2056, MERSQI=12.5) compared elements of curriculum structure at 
different medical schools. Students who reported more clinical contact hours were 
significantly less likely to report serious thoughts of dropping out (OR=0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–
1.00; P=.03). Although the number of tests was not associated with any difference in well-
being, spending more time taking tests was associated with significantly higher perceived 
stress (β=0.29; 95% CI, 0.10–0.84; P=.003) and lower mental quality of life (β=2.79; 95% 
CI, 4.09–1.50; P<.001).19
Camp et al35 (n=275, MERSQI=12.0) found that students in a new problem-based learning 
curriculum, compared with a lecture-based one, had similar reports of depression with 
covariate adjustment. A prematriculation summer enrichment program for medicine and 
nonscience undergraduate majors from underrepresented groups described reports of gaining 
confidence, making friends, and perceiving an easier transition to medical school (n=92, 
MERSQI=7.0).36
Multicomponent program reform (MERSQI=9.4)
Vanderbilt University restructured its medical school learning environment, which, after 
multiple iterations, ultimately took the form of “learning communities” or colleges within 
the school. These intentionally developed groups of faculty and students work together 
longitudinally, with functions that include mentoring, wellness programming (including 
mind-body skill training, career advising, and personal and professional development), and 
formal medical humanities coursework. Several different studies evaluated the

 multicomponent program at various stages of its development and implementation. Drolet 
and Rodgers37 (n=116, MERSQI=6.5) evaluated the faculty advisor/mentor program after 
the addition of several components and found that 95% of students reported a positive 
experience with the Wellness Program. Fleming et al38 (n=245, MERSQI=6.0) assessed the 
association of the most recent program iteration, including colleges, and found that more 
than 91% of students reported that colleges contributed at least somewhat meaningfully to 
their medical school experience. Real et al39 (n=450, MERSQI=10.5) reported that students 
credited the program in general (and, more specifically, faculty mentors), the student-led 
programming committee, and annual retreats with lowering reported rates of burnout.
The Saint Louis University School of Medicine also undertook multicomponent program 
reform that was introduced in phases to preclinical students: (1) P/F grading for preclinical 
courses, reduced preclinical contact hours, extended electives, and learning communities; 
(1/2) addition of mind-body skills training; and (1/2/3) addition of anatomy course reform. 
As reported in a study by Slavin et al40 (n=890, MERSQI=12.0), Phase 1 was significantly 
associated with improved depression, stress, and cohesion by the end of the second year of 
UME. Phase 1/2 was associated with significantly improved anxiety, stress, and cohesion by 
the end of the first year of UME; depression was reported to be improved by the end of the 
second year of UME.40 Phase 1/2/3 was associated with statistically significant 
improvements in all measures of well-being by the end of the first year, persisting through 
the second year of UME.40
Strayhorn41 (n=478, MERSQI=12.0) compared one school’s curriculum changes to a 
comparison school and found significant time-school interactions that favored the changes 
with regard to reported stressors (F[1467]=6.41; P=.01), mental well-being (F[1460]=9.32; 
P=.002), and social well-being (F[1466]=5.37; P=.02).
Miscellaneous wellness programs (MERSQI=9.0)
In self-hypnosis training RCT, Whitehouse et al42 (n=35, MERSQI=12.0) reported 
significant improvements in anxiety (Brief Symptom Inventory43 range 20–80; higher scores 
indicate higher anxiety; there is no accepted MCID; F[3,96]=2.96; P<.05).42 A cross-
sectional survey (n=26, MERSQI=9.0) about access to student support groups reported that 
a majority of students felt less lonely and unique with their problems.44 An evaluation of a 
wellness elective (n=66, MERSQI=7.0) reported that only a minority of students agreed or 
strongly agreed that it altered their report of the importance of well-being or permission for 
self-care, or provided coping strategies (no significance values reported).45 Kushner et al46 
(n=343, MERSQI=8.0) evaluated a wellness course that included a section on behavior 
change plans; out of the 9 students who set mental/emotional health goals, 6 reported 
achieving their goals (no significance values reported).
Group-based faculty advisor/mentor programs (MERSQI=8.2)
Three studies evaluated small group-based faculty advisor/mentor programs that were 
formally integrated into the academic curriculum. Sastre et al47(n=318, MERSQI=9.5) 
evaluated a program in which competitively selected faculty had protected time for advising 
groups of students. Compared with students with traditional one-on-one volunteer faculty

 advisors, intervention students were significantly more likely to report that they agreed or 
strongly agreed that they were satisfied with how faculty advisors promoted wellness (72% 
vs. 27% ; P<.001) and that they agreed or strongly agreed that they would feel comfortable 
discussing their personal stress (62% vs. 24%; P<.001) or mental health with their advisor 
(51% vs. 27%; P<.001).47 Coates et al48 (n=100, MERSQI=8.0) reported that fourth-year 
medical students involved in an intervention said they felt connected with faculty and with 
classmates (no significance values reported).
The evaluation of a program exclusively for first-year students by Ficklin et al49 (n=151, 
MERSQI=7.0) reported that students stated they were better acquainted with their peers, 
became close with some classmates, and were helped with anxiety related to starting 
medical school as a result of the program, but there was no comparison group and no 
significance values reported.
Discussion
This systematic review identified hundreds of articles on the UME learning environment, but 
only a small subset contained empirically evaluated interventions. No studies included in 
this systematic review met the quality cutoff of 14.0.12 Improving the content and context of 
the delivery of UME will benefit from studies with rigorous design, objective data 
collection, and appropriate intervention comparators, as used in other scientific and 
educational fields. Despite these limitations in the evidence, there are a number of key 
findings from this review that may be relevant for US medical schools.
First, implementation of a preclinical P/F grading system should be considered. All of the 
studies reviewed here show that a preclinical P/F grading system improves medical student 
well-being. The duration of benefit can be finite, with any positive effect perhaps more likely 
to persist in the context of good medical school class cohesion.15 It is also important to 
consider educational repercussions of changing grading systems, to ensure that rigorous 
mastery of educational material and professional preparedness is balanced with student well-
being. Two studies in this review addressed this concern by showing that P/F grading 
systems can be associated with improved well-being without any significant change in 
course test scores, including United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and 2 
scores and subsequent postresidency specialty board certification scores.14,15 This is 
consistent with other literature exclusively focused on academic outcomes of P/F 
grading.50–52 According to the 2014–2015 Liaison Committee on Medical Education 
Annual Medical School Questionnaire, 87 of the 144 participating schools used P/F grading 
systems for at least some portion of the preclinical courses.53
Second, the accessibility and quality of mental health programs for medical students, as well 
as any stigma associated with these programs, should be taken into account.54 Students with 
mental health problems may be undertreated; in one study, fewer than half of the students 
who reported having contemplated suicide during medical school received counseling for 
their depression.55 Addressing mental health conditions with a formal program that includes 
treatment services is essential, and a multipronged program aimed at improving awareness,

 reducing stigma, and improving access to mental health professionals seems to be an 
efficacious approach, and is associated with lower depression and suicidal ideation rates.20
There are specific components of mental health programs that can be critical to improving 
students’ well-being. Barriers to medical students’ mental health treatment reported 
elsewhere include concern about stigma and lack of confidentiality, including fear of 
documentation in the academic record and evaluators’ knowledge of student mental health 
conditions with subsequent career implications.55–59 Medical students reported preferring 
help from a mental health specialist, family, or friends, rather than medical school 
personnel,58 and reported preferring accessing mental health services through a location 
other than the office of student affairs.59 In other studies, students have reported concerns 
about time, convenience of office hours, location, and financial costs.56–59 Although these 
are small studies of implementation issues, they are worth considering for the introduction of 
student mental health programs.
Third, introducing wellness programs that teach mind-body-based stress-reduction skills 
should be considered. The majority of studies in this category, including 2 RCTs, indicate 
that such programs are associated with reduced stress, anxiety, mood, and distress tolerance. 
This association was found even when skills were taught in condensed workshops lasting 
only 4 weeks,32 which is an important factor because programs must balance benefit derived 
from wellness programs with time investment.
Fourth, implementation of formal faculty advisor/mentor programs based in small groups 
and linked with curricular content should be examined. All 3 studies in this review that 
evaluated faulty advisor/mentor programs were highly regarded by students as a method of 
promoting wellness, although only one study tested for statistical significance.47 However, it 
is important that mentors do not grade students, to keep their role as advisors separate from 
assessment so as to foster open communication.49 A small group-based mentoring model—
rather than a one-on-one mentoring system—reduces the number of required faculty 
mentoring positions, allowing medical schools to have competitive selection for a subset of 
excellent faculty and may even enable financial support for this function.49 Outstanding 
faculty mentors are critical to the success of any mentoring program, because they both relay 
explicit academic knowledge and exemplify implicit knowledge on professionalism, ethics, 
and values—the “hidden curriculum.”60
Fifth, the curriculum should be structured to balance clinical and nonclinical learning 
environments. Medical students report less burnout and stress when clinical time is 
increased.19 Many recent changes to curriculum have decreased clinical learning exposures, 
so consideration of where this movement can be reversed will be useful.
Sixth, comprehensive reform of the learning environment that incorporates many of these 
interventions is likely required. A detailed evaluation of the sequential implementation 
phases indicates that there may have been synergies among program components that were 
associated with improvements in medical student well-being.40
This study has a number of limitations. First, the primary studies varied widely in design, 
intervention content, and outcomes collected, precluding meta-analytic pooling. Second, the

 scope of the review was restricted to studies evaluating the quantitative effect of learning 
environment interventions on medical student well-being, although there are other aspects of 
the learning environment that deserve attention in a comprehensive redesign of the learning 
offered to medical students. Third, qualitative research was not included in this systematic 
review. Fourth, there are concerns about the ethics of randomization of education 
research.61,62 Historically, research conducted in established educational settings and 
involving normal educational practices were considered exempt from institutional review 
board oversight.63 However, issues of coercion and lack of informed consent about 
randomization of medical students when conducting learning environment interventions tests 
have recently been raised.64,65 These issues are complex and include whether there is a 
research component to the investigation of the education practice, whether there is an intent 
to publish, whether empirically established practices already exist, and whether the 
investigator has a hierarchical relationship to the participants, such as a clerkship director or 
faculty advisor holds. Guidance is provided elsewhere for future UME educators to decide 
when and under what circumstances randomization is ethical and practical for learning 
environment interventions.64,65
Conclusions
In this systematic review, limited evidence suggested that some specific learning 
environment interventions were associated with improved medical student emotional well-
being. However, the overall quality of these studies was low, highlighting the need for high-
quality medical education research.

 Key Points
Question
What undergraduate medical education learning environment interventions are associated 
with improved emotional well-being among medical students?
Findings
In a systematic review of the medical literature, only 28 articles described empirically 
evaluated interventions and only 3 included randomization, so methodologic rigor was 
limited. However, some data support preclinical pass/fail grading, mental health 
programs, wellness programs, mentoring programs, curricular restructuring, and 
multicomponent program reform.
Meaning
There is limited evidence to support learning environment interventions for improvement 
of emotional well-being among medical students. There is a need for high-quality 
research.
