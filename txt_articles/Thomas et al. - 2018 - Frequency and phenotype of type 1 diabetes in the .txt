survival analysis from UK Biobank

Summary
Background Type 1 diabetes is typically considered a disease of children and young adults. Genetic susceptibility to 
young-onset type 1 diabetes is well defined and does not predispose to type 2 diabetes. It is not known how frequently 
genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes leads to a diagnosis of diabetes after age 30 years. We aimed to investigate the 
frequency and phenotype of type 1 diabetes resulting from high genetic susceptibility in the first six decades of life.
Methods In this cross-sectional analysis, we used a type 1 diabetes genetic risk score based on 29 common variants to 
identify individuals of white European descent in UK Biobank in the half of the population with high or low genetic 
susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to evaluate the number of cases of diabetes in 
both groups in the first six decades of life. We genetically defined type 1 diabetes as the additional cases of diabetes 
that occurred in the high genetic susceptibility group compared with the low genetic susceptibility group. All 
remaining cases were defined as type 2 diabetes. We assessed the clinical characteristics of the groups with genetically 
defined type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
Findings 13 250 (3·5%) of 379 511 white European individuals in UK Biobank had developed diabetes in the first six 
decades of life. 1286 more cases of diabetes were in the half of the population with high genetic susceptibility to type 1 
diabetes than in the half of the population with low genetic susceptibility. These genetically defined cases of type 1 
diabetes were distributed across all ages of diagnosis; 537 (42%) were in individuals diagnosed when aged 31–60 years, 
representing 4% (537/12 233) of all diabetes cases diagnosed after age 30 years. The clinical characteristics of the 
group diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when aged 31–60 years were similar to the clinical characteristics of the group 
diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when aged 30 years or younger. For individuals diagnosed with diabetes when aged 
31–60 years, the clinical characteristics of type 1 diabetes differed from those of type 2 diabetes: they had a lower BMI 
(27·4 kg/m² [95% CI 26·7–28·0] vs 32·4 kg/m² [32·2–32·5]; p<0·0001), were more likely to use insulin in the 
first year after diagnosis (89% [476/537] vs 6% [648/11 696]; p<0·0001), and were more likely to have diabetic 
ketoacidosis (11% [61/537] vs 0·3% [30/11 696]; p<0·0001).
Interpretation Genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes results in non-obesity-related, insulin-dependent diabetes, 
which presents throughout the first six decades of life. Our results highlight the difficulty of identifying type 1 diabetes 
after age 30 years because of the increasing background prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Failure to diagnose late-onset 
type 1 diabetes can have serious consequences because these patients rapidly develop insulin dependency.

Introduction
Type 1 diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of 
pancreatic β cells in genetically predisposed indivi­
duals and results in severe insulin deficiency with 
a requirement for treatment with insulin. It is typically 
considered a disease of childhood and adolescence, but 
can occur at any age. Type 2 diabetes is predominantly a 
disease of adulthood and is associated with obesity, 
insulin resistance, and relative but not absolute insulin 
deficiency. Type 2 diabetes is initially treated with 
lifestyle measures and oral glucose­lowering drugs.
Correct diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in young people 
(<20 years) is usually straightforward because it 
accounts for most (≥85%) cases of diabetes in that 
population.1 By contrast, identification of type 1 diabetes 
in adults older than 30 years is challenging because of 
the much higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than 
type 1 diabetes in older adults (type 1 diabetes accounts 
for <5% of all cases).2,3 Errors are often made when 
diagnosing type 1 diabetes later in life. For example, 
more than 50% of patients diagnosed with type 1 
diabetes after age 35 years were shown to have type 2 
diabetes in long­term follow­up.4,5 Conversely, many 
older patients initially believed to have type 2 diabetes 
because of their age at diagnosis deteriorate rapidly and 
are subsequently found to have type 1 diabetes.6 Few 
studies2 have investigated how frequently type 1 diabetes 
presents in later life.

Biomarkers, such as C­peptide and islet­specific auto­
antibodies, can be used to distinguish type 1 diabetes from 
type 2 diabetes, but are not routinely measured or 
completely discriminatory. Progression to absolute insulin 
deficiency, defined by measurement of serum C­peptide 
concentration, can be used to identify type 1 diabetes, but 
is only useful 3–5 years after diagnosis. No studies to date 
have tested C­peptide in sufficiently large cohorts of 
patients.2,7 Autoantibodies to the islet antigen glutamic acid 
decarboxylase (GAD) have been used for diagnosis, but are 
only present in 70% of patients with type 1 diabetes.8 The 
low incidence (5%) of type 1 diabetes compared with type 2 
diabetes in people older than 30 years means that the 
proportion of people who have a true­positive autoantibody 
test (about 3·5% of all cases) is similar to the proportion 
with a false­positive test (around 2·5% of all cases because 
the definition of antibody positive is based on a 
97·5th centile cutoff for a population without diabetes). 
Therefore, slightly less than half of autoantibody­positive 
patients older than 30 years will have type 2 diabetes and 
not type 1 diabetes.9 Clinical diagnosis based on a patient’s 
clinical features, such as age of diagnosis and BMI, does 
not have sufficient discriminatory power because of the 
low prevalence of type 1 diabetes. These difficulties in 
accurate diagnosis mean that, although older­onset type 1 
diabetes is recog 
nised, accurate assessment of the 
proportion of type 1 diabetes that occurs at older ages and 
identification of its clinical features is challenging.
Polygenic risk for disease is rarely used to identify 
disease in populations because most individuals with 
high genetic risk do not go on to develop the disease.10 
The concept of absent genetic susceptibility is used 
clinically to exclude conditions such as coeliac disease11,12 
and ankylosing spondylitis.13 Genetic predisposition to 
type 1 diabetes is polygenic, well defined by large genome­
wide association studies,14 and does not predispose to 
type 2 diabetes.15 Strong genetic susceptibility to type 1 
diabetes is predominantly HLA mediated, with other 
associated variants modifying immune recognition and 
function. This genetic susceptibility can be captured by the 
typing of 10–30 single nucleotide polymorphisms as 
a type 1 diabetes genetic risk score.16,17 We have previously 
shown that, although a high type 1 diabetes genetic risk 
score can occur in people with type 2 diabetes or without 
diabetes,16 very few individuals (<5%) with type 1 diabetes 
have a type 1 diabetes genetic risk score below the 
50th centile of a non­diabetes control or type 2 diabetes 
population.18 Thus, half of the population has such a low 
genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes that any diabetes 
they have is probably not type 1 diabetes but type 2 diabetes. 
Research in context
Evidence before the study
Type 1 diabetes affects people of all ages, but data on the 
epidemiology of type 1 diabetes in adulthood are scarce. Most 
studies focus exclusively on type 1 diabetes in individuals who 
were diagnosed when aged 20 years or younger, which accounts 
for more than 85% of all cases and is easy to identify. 
Distinguishing between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes in 
adulthood is more difficult because, in middle and old age, the 
incidence of type 2 diabetes increases sharply; thus, type 1 
diabetes represents a small minority of cases in adulthood and 
recognition of these patients can be challenging. A systematic 
review by Diaz-Valenica and colleagues in 2015 emphasised the 
paucity of data on the incidence of type 1 diabetes in adults and 
encouraged the launch of epidemiological studies of adult-onset 
type 1 diabetes. The authors identified only ten studies reporting 
the incidence of type 1 diabetes after age 40 years. We repeated 
their systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of 
Knowledge for articles published up to April 20, 2017, and 
identified no additional studies. Considerable problems exist in 
the definitions of type 1 diabetes in older adults used in these 
studies: four studies solely relied on a clinical definition of insulin 
treatment by the clinician for classification as type 1 diabetes and 
only six studies used C-peptide or autoantibodies to confirm a 
diagnosis. However, use of autoantibodies has disadvantages: 
1–7% of individuals without diabetes have positive 
autoantibodies depending on the cutoff used, and 1–7% of 
individuals with type 2 diabetes will have false-positive antibody 
results. Therefore, in older adults, in whom type 1 diabetes is rare 
(2–5% of all diabetes cases), patients with diabetes who are 
positive for autoantibodies are as likely to be false positive with 
type 2 diabetes as true positive with type 1 diabetes.
Added value of this study
We used a genetic, population-based approach to classify 
diabetes type over a broad age range and to compare 
two groups differing only by their genetic susceptibility to 
type 1 diabetes. We defined type 1 diabetes genetically as any 
excess of diabetes in the group with high type 1 diabetes 
genetic susceptibility compared with the group with low type 1 
diabetes genetic susceptibility. Type 1 diabetes was shown to 
present throughout the first six decades of life, with 42% of 
type 1 diabetes occurring after age 30 years, representing 4% of 
all patients with diabetes diagnosed after age 30 years. We also 
examined the clinical characteristics of the patients with type 1 
diabetes and found that the group diagnosed when aged 
31–60 years had similar clinical characteristics and risk of 
diabetic ketoacidosis to the group diagnosed when aged 
30 years or younger.
Implications of all the available evidence
Late-onset type 1 diabetes is difficult to diagnose in people aged 
31–60 years because it represents only a small minority of 
patients diagnosed with diabetes; its misdiagnosis as type 2 
diabetes results in inappropriate treatment. Patients with 
older-onset type 1 diabetes have been excluded from almost 
every major study of the biology of type 1 diabetes and, hence, 
little is known about its aetiopathology.

The half of the population with high susceptibility to type 1 
diabetes can have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The 
number of type 1 cases will corres 
pond to the excess of 
diabetes cases compared with the number of cases of 
type 2 diabetes in the half of the population with low 
genetic susceptibility.
In this study, we aimed to define type 1 diabetes based 
solely on genetic susceptibility to determine the number of 
cases of type 1 diabetes, relative proportion of all cases of 
diabetes, and clinical features of type 1 diabetes throughout 
the first six decades of life.
Methods
Study design and participants
Between 2006 and 2010, UK Biobank recruited more than 
500 000 individuals aged 37–73 years (99·5% aged 
40–69 years) from across the UK. Individuals were 
registered with the UK National Health Service and 
lived within 25 miles of one of 22 assessment centres. 
Recruitment was unselected to provide a population­based 
cohort.19
From the initial UK Biobank dataset, for our genetic 
susceptibility analysis, we selected unrelated individuals of 
white European descent who had genetic data available. 
People of white European descent were those who self­
identified as white European and were confirmed as 
ancestrally white by use of principal­components analyses 
of genome­wide genetic information.20
Genetic susceptibility testing
We established the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score using 
published variants16 known to be associated with risk of 
type 1 diabetes (appendix). All variants were present in the 
imputed genotype data in UK Biobank. We used tag 
variants rs2187668 and rs7454108 to establish the HLA-DR 
haplotype and hence calculate the HLA­haplotype com­
ponent of each individual’s score.16,21 The HLA-DR 
haplotype score was added to the score of the remaining 
variants, generated by summation of the number of 
predisposing alleles for each variant multiplied by the 
natural log of the odds ratio. All variants were well imputed 
(minimum imputation r² 0·99). The variant rs4948088 was 
out of Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium (p<1 × 10–⁴⁰) and was 
thus excluded from the score, leaving a total of 29 variants 
included in the score.
Diabetes outcomes
Features of diabetes, including age of diagnosis, insulin 
use within 1 year of diagnosis, and insulin use at enrol­
ment to the study, were self­reported via an interactive 
questionnaire completed at baseline enrolment into UK 
Biobank. Self­reported diabetes diagnosis has been shown 
to have a high accuracy compared with use of primary 
health records.22 Anthropometric measurements were 
collected at baseline when participants attended the 
assessment centre. We used the BMI recorded in UK 
Biobank, calculated as (weight [kg]/height [m]²). Gender 
was self­reported. Results were coded as missing if 
individuals had answered “don’t know” or “prefer not to 
answer”. Records with inconsistencies in the data were 
removed (appendix).
Admissions for primary or secondary diabetic keto­
acidosis were identified by use of diagnosis codes from 
hospital admissions data between April 1, 1997, and 
March 31, 2015. Diagnoses were coded according to the 
Inter 
national Classification of Diseases version 10 
(appendix).
Statistical analysis
To define type 1 diabetes excess, we ranked individuals by 
type 1 diabetes genetic risk score and then split them by 
the median score into a high genetic risk score group and 
a low genetic risk score group. The 50% cutoff for type 1 
diabetes genetic risk score was 0·231, which corresponded 
to the fourth centile for type 1 diabetes (individuals with 
diabetes who were diagnosed when younger than 17 years

any excess in the top 50% will be cases of type 1 diabetes. In a population where the proportions of type 1 diabetes and 
type 2 diabetes are unknown, this method can be used to determine the proportion of type 1 diabetes cases. (B)

and who progressed straight to insulin) in the Wellcome 
Trust Case Control Consortium cohort.16 We evaluated the 
number of cases of diabetes in the two groups using 
Kaplan­Meier analysis, examining the number of years 
without diabetes before diagnosis by a doctor (as per 
participant self­report). Participants without diabetes were 
censored at their age of enrolment into UK Biobank.
Figure 1 shows how we used the type 1 diabetes genetic 
risk score to determine genetically defined type 1 diabetes. 
Almost all (96%) individuals with type 1 diabetes in the 
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium cohort16 have a 
genetic risk score above the 50th centile of the type 2 
diabetes cohort, and, by definition, the numbers of type 2 
diabetes cases above and below the 50th centile are equal. 
The type 1 genetic risk score in the general population 
has the same distribution and median as the type 2 
diabetes popu 
lation. Therefore, we genetically defined 
type 1 diabetes as the additional diabetes cases occurring 
in the 50% of the population with high genetic sus­
ceptibility to type 1 diabetes compared with the 50% of the 
population with low genetic susceptibility to type 1 
diabetes. All remaining cases were defined as type 2 
diabetes. For participants older than 60 years, data were 
censored at age 60 years because the overwhelming 
preponderance (>95%) of type 2 diabetes cases relative to 
type 1 diabetes cases in the diminishing at­risk population 
available for analysis rendered the subtraction method 
uninterpret 
able.3
Although we can determine the number of patients with 
type 1 diabetes from the excess, we could not use our 
method to establish individual diagnoses. However, we 
were able to derive summary characteristics for genetically 
defined type 1 diabetes. Categorical variables (eg, insulin 
treatment at 1 year) were recorded as the excess in the high 
type 1 diabetes susceptibility group compared with the low 
type 1 diabetes susceptibility group for each category. 
Continuous characteristics (eg, BMI) were derived by use 
of the mean value of the low susceptibility group (type 2 
diabetes) and the mean of the high susceptibility group 
(combined type 1 and type 2 diabetes) to calculate a mean 
for the group with type 1 diabetes. For example, for BMI:
where nH, nL, and nT1D represent the number of individuals 
and 
,      
, and 
represent the mean BMI of 
the high, low, and excess groups, respectively. We derived 
summary statistics for the type 1 diabetes group from the 
means and SDs of the high and low genetic susceptibility 
groups for all normally distributed variables (apart from 
BMI) using standard algebra (appendix). Because of the 
bimodal distribution of BMI, we used the SD of the type 2 
diabetes group when calculating the type 1 diabetes group’s 
summary statistics. 
We first compared the characteristics of type 1 versus 
type 2 diabetes in individuals diagnosed aged 31–60 years; 
we then compared the characteristics of type 1 diabetes in 
individuals diagnosed aged 30 years and younger versus 
those diagnosed aged 31–60 years. χ² analysis was used for 
comparison of categorical characteristics. For continuous 
data, we used t tests to assess significance and calculated 
CIs for these summary statistics. Because seven clinical 
characteristics were tested, p values were adjusted for 
multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. All analyses 
were done with Stata, version 14.

Results
We selected 379 511 unrelated individuals of white 
European descent from the initial UK Biobank dataset of 
502 667 individuals with genetic data available. We 
ranked those individuals by type 1 diabetes genetic risk 
score and then split them around the median score into a 
high genetic risk score group (n=189 508) and a low 
genetic risk score group (n=190 003). 13 250 (3·5%) 
individuals had developed diabetes in the first six decades 
of life, 7268 of whom had a high type 1 diabetes genetic 
risk score and 5982 of whom had a low type 1 diabetes 
genetic risk score (figure 2). There was an excess of 
1286 cases of genetically defined type 1 diabetes in the 
high genetic risk score group than in the low genetic risk 
score group (p<0·0001), which is consistent with 9·7% 
(95% CI 9·2–10·2) of all cases of diabetes being type 1 
diabetes (figure 2).
Cases of genetically defined type 1 diabetes were 
distributed across the first six decades of life 
(figures 3, 4). Of 1286 individuals with type 1 diabetes, 
537 (42%, 95% CI 39–45) were diagnosed when aged 
31–60 years and 749 (58%, 55–61) were diagnosed when 
aged 30 years or younger (p<0·0001). Type 1 diabetes 
accounted for 537 (4%, 4–5) of the total 12 233 diabetes 
cases diagnosed between ages 31 and 60 years and 
749 (74%, 71–76) of the 1017 diabetes cases diagnosed 
aged 30 years or younger.
For diabetes diagnosed aged 31–60 years, clinical char­
acteristics differed substantially between type 1 diabetes 
and type 2 diabetes (table 1). The group with type 1 
diabetes had a lower BMI, was diagnosed at a younger 
age, and progressed to insulin more rapidly than the 
group with type 2 diabetes. For the group diagnosed 
aged 31–60 years, all 537 individuals (100%) with type 1 
diabetes were being treated with insulin (at a mean of 
14 years [95% CI 13–16] after diagnosis), whereas only 
1924 (16%) individuals with type 2 diabetes were being 
treated with insulin (at a mean of 7 years [7–7] after 
diagnosis; p<0·0001). 61 (11%) of 537 individuals in the 
type 1 diabetes group had a recorded hospital admission 
for diabetic ketoacidosis compared with 30 (0·3%) of 
11 696 individuals in the type 2 diabetes group 
(p<0·0001).
The clinical characteristics of type 1 diabetes in 
patients who had been diagnosed when aged 31–60 years 
were similar to the clinical characteristics of the disease 
in patients who had been diagnosed when aged 30 years 
or younger (table 2). Specifically, sex, BMI, insulin 
treatment at the time of enrolment into UK Biobank, 
and diabetic ketoacidosis as a discharge diagnosis were 
not different between the groups. A higher proportion 
of people in the 30 years or younger at diagnosis cohort 
received insulin within 1 year of diagnosis than in the 
cohort diagnosed at an older age.
Discussion
We used a novel genetically stratified survival analysis to 
identify cases of type 1 diabetes in a cross­sectional 
population of 379 511 people in UK Biobank. Genetically 
defined type 1 diabetes represented 9·7% (1286 of 13 250) 
of all diabetes cases diagnosed in the first six decades of 
life, with 58% (749 cases, 74% of all cases of diabetes in 
this age range) of type 1 diabetes cases diagnosed when 
patients were aged 30 years or younger and 42% 
(537 cases, 4% of all cases) of cases diagnosed when 
individuals were aged 31–60 years. The phenotype of 
type 1 diabetes was similar for the group diagnosed when 
aged 31–60 years and the group diagnosed when aged 
30 years or younger; individuals in both groups had a low 
BMI, rapidly progressed to insulin treatment, and were at 
increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis compared with 
participants with assumed type 2 diabetes. Our findings 
suggest that type 1 diabetes presents throughout the 
first six decades of life. Although type 1 diabetes is easy to 
identify and study in individuals aged 30 years or younger, 
identification of type 1 diabetes in individuals who present 
when older than 30 years is more challenging because of 
the much greater background incidence of type 2 diabetes 
in older populations.
We have shown that genetic predisposition to type 1 
diabetes, defined in children, predisposes to diabetes at all 
ages. Our subtraction method allowed a genetic definition 
of disease. Although monogenic disease is usually defined 
by its genetic aetiology, to our knowledge, this study is the 
first to use a subtraction method with genetic predisposition 
to define cases of a common complex polygenic disease.
Numerous studies2 have shown that type 1 diabetes can 
occur in individuals older than 30 years, but researchers 
have been unable to quantify to what degree it occurs.

Approaches to this dilemma have broadly categorised 
type 1 diabetes either by clinical definitions, C­peptide 
negativity, or autoantibody positivity. In clinical practice, 
further investigations are rarely done and, when they are, 
interpretation is challenging because of the high 
prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the population older than 
30 years. Clinical diagnosis is often based on poorly 
discriminatory clinical characteristics and, as a result, 
misdiagnosis is common. Among individuals diagnosed 
with diabetes when older than 35 years, 56% of those 
who commence insulin treatment immediately do not 
progress to absolute insulin deficiency, and 7% of those 
not initially treated with insulin do progress to absolute 
insulin deficiency.4
The clinical characteristics resulting from a genetic 
definition of type 1 diabetes can be compared with the 
clinical character 
istics of type 1 diabetes defined by the 
presence of islet autoantibodies. In children and young 
adults with diabetes, who are typically non­obese and 
rapidly insulin dependent, both genetically defined type 1 
diabetes and islet­antibody­positive diabetes define 
almost all patients. We identified a similar phenotype 
when genetically defined type 1 diabetes was diagnosed in 
individuals aged 31–60 years: 89% of patients were treated 
with insulin within 1 year of diagnosis and about one in 
nine were admitted to hospital with documented diabetic 
ketoacidosis. By contrast, most patients with diabetes 
diagnosed in middle age who have islet antibodies do not 
usually proceed rapidly to insulin therapy. In latent 
autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA)—defined as 
patients diagnosed when aged 35–70 years who have 
antibodies to GAD and who are not initially treated with 
insulin—about 30–40% of patients are treated with 
insulin within the first 3 years after diagnosis, and the 
BMI, lipid profiles, and genetic susceptibility of these 
patients are intermediate between young­onset type 1 
diabetes and type 2 diabetes.24 Rather than a single 
intermediate phenotype, a possible explanation is that 
patients who are antibody positive when the prevalence of 
type 1 diabetes is low represent a mixture of true positives 
(young­onset type 1 diabetes phenotype) and false 
positives (type 2 diabetes). The phenotypic heterogeneity 
seen in LADA, depending on the population studied and 
the titre and number of antibodies used, supports this 
concept.24 Further research is needed to investigate 
genetically defined type 1 diabetes, autoantibodies, and 
C­peptide within a single cohort.
Our genetically stratified survival analysis approach to 
identifying type 1 diabetes in a population has several 
advantages. First, the permanence of genetic risk from 
birth allows survival analysis to be done in a cross­
sectional study. Second, the survival curve for type 2 
diabetes in the low genetic risk score group allows use of 
a sensitive, but not specific, cutoff to identify almost all 
type 1 diabetes cases and then remove type 2 diabetes 
cases by subtraction. Third, a genetic definition of type 1 
diabetes at a population level identifies cases without 
making assumptions about associated clinical features or 
requiring autoantibody measurement. This approach 
meant that we were able to assess clinical features in our 
study because they were not used to define type 1 
diabetes. This strategy of using type 1 genetic suscep­
tibility is independent of and complementary to methods 
based on clinical features, autoantibodies, or C­peptide 
measurement. Notably, this method could potentially be 
applied to other polygenic diseases with strong genetic 
susceptibility to provide an unbiased population assess­
ment of their contribution to a common phenotype with 
multiple alternative causes.
This study has clear clinical implications. Our findings 
alert clinicians that type 1 diabetes occurs often after age 
30 years, but that it is difficult to detect because of the 
predominance of type 2 diabetes in older adults. A high 
index of suspicion for type 1 diabetes in later life is 
important because it has a rapidly progressive phenotype 
with a substantial risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Diagnosis 
of type 1 diabetes should be considered in any middle­aged 
patient with type 2 diabetes who does not show good

glycaemic control on rapidly escalating therapy, especially 
if they are slim. At the individual level, a high type 1 
diabetes genetic risk score (above the median of the 
population) cannot be used to diagnose type 1 diabetes in a 
patient with diabetes diagnosed in middle age because 
most (>90%) individuals with a high score will have type 2 
diabetes. By contrast, a low genetic risk score (below the 
median of the population) can be used to say that a patient 
is unlikely to have type 1 diabetes. This genetic exclusion 
method is also used in existing clinical guidelines for 
diagnosis of coeliac disease11,12 and ankylosing spondylitis.13 
Calculating the probability of a type 1 diabetes diagnosis 
for an individual will be helped in the future by develop­
ment of statistical models that incorporate quantitative 
clinical features, such as age of diagnosis and BMI, with 
the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score.
This study has several limitations. UK Biobank is a 
voluntary study recruiting from 22 sites across the UK; 
these volunteers are typically healthier and of higher 
socioeconomic status than the general UK population.25 
All participants have reached the age of 37 years, 
introducing a selection bias against people who are 
unhealthy or have not survived to this age. This selection 
bias might lead to an underestimate of type 1 diabetes at 
all ages and particularly in those diagnosed as children 
because they would be more likely to have serious 
morbidity or mortality from complications that could 
reduce likelihood of entry into the study. In our study, the 
prevalence of diabetes diagnosed in children younger 
than 10 years was 35 cases per 100 000 population, which 
is lower than expected from previous studies (around 
100 cases per 100 000 population).3,26 A further contri­
buting factor is that UK Biobank participants were born 
between 1934 and 1971, and type 1 diabetes has been 
presenting at younger ages over time.27 Underestimation 
of type 1 diabetes diagnosed in the youngest decade 
would have reduced the proportion of cases diagnosed 
when aged 30 years or younger in our study. However, 
this underestimation will not alter the phenotypic 
similarity in the clinical characteristics of patients 
diagnosed in the two age groups or the finding that 
presentation after age 30 years is common.
The age distribution of people in UK Biobank meant 
that we only had power to assess diabetes in individuals 
aged 60 years or younger. Therefore, we cannot predict 
whether the frequency of type 1 diabetes diminishes 
after age 60 years. We limited the study to individuals of 
white European descent because the type 1 diabetes 
genetic risk score has only been validated in white 
people. This approach means the results are specific to 
this ethnic group, and other studies are needed to 
validate the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score in other 
ethnic groups and to investigate older­onset type 1 
diabetes in these popu 
lations. We used a type 1 diabetes 
genetic risk score developed in a reference population 
who were all diag 
nosed with type 1 diabetes when 
younger than 17 years.16,23 Although the type 1 diabetes 
genetic risk score has not been tested in an adult­onset 
type 1 diabetes population, genetic susceptibility to 
type 1 diabetes in later life almost completely overlaps 
with that of childhood diabetes.28 Large studies16,18 of well 
defined type 1 and type 2 diabetes populations have 
shown that almost no overlap exists between risk of 
type 1 diabetes and risk of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, 
in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium cohort, 
type 2 diabetes had an identical distribution of type 1 
diabetes genetic risk scores to a control population 
without diabetes and a population with monogenic 
diabetes. These data support our assumption that the 
excess of cases in the high genetic risk score group are 
type 1 diabetes.
In conclusion, use of a novel genetic approach to define 
type 1 diabetes has shown that it presents across the first 
six decades of life and should not be considered a disease 
of children and young adults. Whatever age it presents, 
type 1 diabetes is associated with rapid requirement for 
insulin and risk of ketoacidosis, suggesting that it is not a 
milder phenotype if diagnosed later in life. A key area for 
both clinical practice and research in the future is to 
improve recognition of late­onset type 1 diabetes.
