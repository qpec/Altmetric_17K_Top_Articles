ABSTRACT
Background. Outpatient palliative care clinics facilitate early
referral and are associated with improved outcomes in cancer
patients. However, appropriate candidates for outpatient
palliative care referral and optimal timing remain unclear. We
conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify
criteria that are considered when an outpatient palliative
cancer care referral is initiated.
Methods. We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1948–2013 citations)
and Ovid Embase (1947–2015 citations) for articles related to
outpatient palliative cancer care. Two researchers indepen-
dently reviewed each citation for inclusion and extracted the
referral criteria.The interrater agreement was high (k 5 0.96).
Results. Of the 186 publications in our initial search, 21 were
included in the final sample. We identified 20 unique referral
criteria. Among these, 6 were recurrent themes, which in-
cluded physical symptoms (n 5 13 [62%]), cancer trajectory
(n 5 13 [62%]), prognosis (n 5 7 [33%]), performance status
(n 5 7 [33%]), psychosocial distress (n 5 6 [29%]), and end-of-
life care planning (n 5 5 [24%]). We found significant varia-
tions among the articles regarding the definition of advanced
cancer and the assessment tools for symptom/distress
screening. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (n 5 7
[33%]) and the distress thermometer (n 5 2 [10%]) were used
most often. Furthermore, there was a lack of consensus in the
cutoffs in symptom assessment tools and timing for outpa-
tient palliative care referral.
Conclusion.This systematic review identified 20 criteria in-
cluding 6 recurrent themes for outpatient cancer palliative
care referral. It highlights the significant heterogeneity regard-
ing the timing and process for referral and the need for fur-
ther research to develop standardized referral criteria.

Implications for Practice: Outpatient palliative care clinics improve patient outcomes; however, it remains unclear who is
appropriate for referral and what is the optimal timing. A better understanding of the referral criteria would help (a) referring
clinicians to identify appropriate patients for palliative care interventions, (b) administrators to assess their programs with set
benchmarksforqualityimprovement,(c)researcherstostandardizeinclusioncriteria,and(d)policymakerstodevelopclinicalcare
pathways and allocate appropriate resources. This systematic review identified 20 criteria including 6 recurrent themes for
outpatient palliative cancer care referral. It represents the first step toward developing standardized referral criteria.
INTRODUCTION
Over the past few years, there has been an increasing call for
greaterintegrationofpalliativecareandoncology,withmultiple
organizations, such as the Institute of Medicine, the American
Society of Clinical Oncology, and the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network, promoting early palliative care referral for
cancerpatients[1–3].Because most oncologypatientsare seen
in the ambulatory setting, outpatient palliative care is partic-
ularly appropriate to facilitate early access [4]. Outpatient
palliative care clinics are increasingly available, with 59% of
National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer centers and
22% of non-NCI-designated cancer centers reporting their
presence [5]. Multiple randomized controlled trials and cohort

 studies found that introduction of outpatient palliative care
fromthetimeofdiagnosisisassociatedwithimprovedqualityof
life, symptom burden, patient satisfaction, and even prolonged
survival compared with routine oncological care [6–9]. Out-
patient palliative care referral is also associated with significant
improvement in end-of-life care outcomes compared with
inpatient palliative care consultation [10].
Currently, the volume and timing of referral to outpatient
palliativecareforcancerpatientsvarywidely[11].Thisispartly
attributed to the lack of standardized referral criteria for
outpatient palliative care, coupled with variable oncologists’
attitudes and beliefs about palliative care and differences in
availability and resources of the palliative care service. A better
understanding of the criteria when initiating an outpatient
palliative care referral would help (a) referring clinicians to
identify potentially eligible patients for palliative care inter-
ventions, (b) administrators to assess their programs with
clear benchmarks for quality improvement purposes, (c) re-
searchers to standardize the design for future trials involving
outpatient palliative care, and (d) policymakers to develop
clinical care pathways and to allocate appropriate resources
toward development of palliative care programs. We con-
ducted a systematic review of the literature to identify criteria
that are considered when an outpatient cancer palliative care
referral is initiated. This represents the first step toward
developing a standardized set of referral criteria.
METHODS
Literature Search
The institutional review board at MD Anderson Cancer Center
provided approval to proceed without the need for full
committeereview.OnDecember18,2013,ourclinicallibrarian
searched all the citations on Ovid MEDLINE from 1948 to 2013
and Ovid Embase from 1947 to 2013. We subsequently
updated this search of both databases on October 25, 2015,to
include the latest publications. Our search strategy consisted
of Medical Subject Headings and text word or text phrase
for “neoplasms,” “palliative care,” or “supportive care” and
“outpatient”or“ambulatory”or“clinic.”Weincludedalloriginal
studies, reviews, systematic reviews, guidelines, editorials,
commentaries, and letters and excluded duplicates, non-
English articles, dissertations, and conference abstracts.
After the initial search, two investigators (D.H., S.B.) in-
dependentlyreviewedthetitleandabstractofeachcitationfor
inclusion. Publications were included for further review if
either of the two investigators coded that article as related
to referral criteria for palliative care.This approach was taken
to maximize inclusion. The interrater agreement was high
(k 5 0.96; p , .001).
Data Collection
We retrieved the full text of each article of interest and
excluded any publications not relevant to outpatient pallia-
tive care referral. A few articles provided palliative care refer-
ral criteria but did not specifically state whether they were for
outpatient or inpatient. We included these articles as well.
Subsequently,weexaminedeacharticleindetailandextracted
the referral criteria. One investigator reviewed all articles
for consistency (D.H.). Any disagreements were discussed to
arrive at a consensus. If a referral criterion was described by at
least five articles (e.g., performance status), it was considered
as a major category. This qualitative systematic review follows
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses guideline for reporting where applicable [12].
Statistical Analysis
We used frequencies and percentages to summarize the data.
The k statistic was used to assess interrater reliability. The
StatisticalPackagefortheSocialSciences(SPSS,version16.0;IBM,
Armonk, NY, http://www.ibm.com) was used. A p value of ,.05
was considered to represent a statistically significant difference.
RESULTS
Literature Search
Our literature search identified 186 articles. Ninety-six were
excluded because they represented duplicates, conference
abstracts, or non-English articles. A total of 90 articles were
reviewed, and 21 (23%) were included in the final sample
(Fig. 1). The characteristics of the articles are summarized in
Table1.AmajorityofthestudieswerefromNorthAmerica(n516
[76%]) and were published after 2010 (n 5 14 [67%]). All except
one of the publications were specific to oncology (n 5 20 [95%]).
Criteria for Referral
Six major categories for referral criteria were identified
(Table 2), including physical symptoms (n 5 13 [62%]), cancer
diagnosis(n513[62%]),prognosis(n57[33%]),performance
status (n 5 7 [33%]), psychosocial distress (n 5 6 [29%]), and
end-of-life care planning (n 5 6 [29%]).
Cancer Diagnosis/Trajectory
Although the diagnosis of an advanced cancer was the most
commonly cited criterion, only 2 articles (n 5 2 [9.5%]) [6, 13]
specifically stated a time interval (i.e., within 8 weeks of
diagnosis of metastatic lung carcinoma). The definition of ad-
vanced cancer varied among the 13 studies. Advanced disease
was defined as metastatic disease in all 13 articles and also as
locally advanced disease in 5 articles. Three studies (n 5 3
[14.3%]) [1, 14, 15] further qualified that advanced cancer
should be in the absence of curative treatment. Zimmerman
etal.statedthatadvancedbreastandprostatecancershouldbe
hormonal refractory [9]. Gaertner et al. provided specific criteria
for defining advanced cancer for 19 different tumor types [16].
Prognosis
Prognosis was the third most common criterion quoted for
palliative care referral. As shown in Table 3, the prognostic
criteria for referral varied widely among the 7 articles. None

Physical Symptoms
Thirteen (61.9%) articles cited symptom management as
reason for referral. Only 9 articles mentioned the validated
toolsforsymptomassessmentintheoncologysetting,with7
articles suggesting using the Edmonton Symptom Assess-
ment Scale (ESAS) (Table 4). Only 2 studies provided a cutoff
for symptom severity before initiating a palliative care referral
[17, 18].

 Performance Status
Seven articles (33.3%) cited performance status as one of the
referral criteria.The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) guideline used a Karnofsky Performance Scale score of
#50%and/oranEasternOncology Cooperation Group(ECOG)
score of $3 as cutoffs [1]. Another 4 articles used ECOG
performance status (cutoffs of 0–2 for 3; 1 study did not mention
cutoff) [6, 9, 13, 19], and 2 other articles used the Palliative
Performance Scale (PPS) (1 article mentioned cutoff PPS score
of ,60%; the other article did not specify the cutoff) [20, 21].
Psychosocial Distress
Six (28.6%) articles quoted psychosocial distress as an indicator
for referral, but only 2 (9.5%) articles indicated the tools for dis-
tress screening—both with the NCCN distress thermometer. NCCN
guidelines recommended a distress score of 4 of 10 [1], whereas
Morita et al. recommended a cutoff score of 6 or greater [17].
End-of-Life Care Planning
Fivearticlesquotedend-of-lifecareplanningasanotherreason
for referral. However, these publications provided little fur-
ther details on what encompassed end-of-life care planning.
Other Criteria
We identified 14 other criteria that were mentioned less
commonly. These included patient request [1, 17, 19, 22],
initiation of intravenous or tumor-specific chemotherapy
[14–16], family concerns [1, 19], serious comorbidities [1,
19],andmultiplehospitalizations[1,20].Theremainingcriteria
were only suggested by the NCCN guideline once, including
history of drug abuse, communication barriers, financial
limitations, impaired cognitive function, frequent emergency
visits, complicated intensive care unit admission, multiple
allergy, request for hastened death, and caregiver stress.
DISCUSSION
We systematically reviewed outpatient palliative care referral
criteria, and we identified 20 unique criteria. Among these,
there were 6 common themes for referral: 2 time-based

 criteria (cancer diagnosis/trajectory and prognosis) and 4
needs-based criteria (physical symptoms, performance status,
end-of-life care planning, and psychosocial distress). We found
no universally accepted criteria for which patients should be
referred and when they should be referred. Findings from this
studycaninformthedevelopmentofconsensus-basedreferral

Having a diagnosis of advanced cancer was clearly an
important criterion for outpatient palliative care referral.
Interestingly, the definition for advanced cancer varied widely
among the articles. Thus, our study highlights the need to
establish an operational definition for this commonly used
term. Another important aspect relates to when patients with
advanced cancer should be referred. Only a few stated that
referral should occur shortly after cancer diagnosis [6]. For in-
stance, the landmark randomized controlled trial from Temel
et al. suggested that patients should be referred to palliative care
within 8 weeks from the time of diagnosis of metastatic non-small

 celllungcancer,regardlessofprognosisorneed[6,13].Compared
with patients who received only usual oncology care, those ran-
domly assigned to receive concurrent early palliative care had
improved outcomes; this finding highlights that palliative care
involvement may be beneficial regardless of care needs. Despite
theenthusiasticsupportforearlyspecialistpalliativecarereferral
in clinical guidelines concurrent with primary palliative care
delivered by oncology teams, referral is often initiated on the
basis of patient needs instead of where the patient is along the
disease trajectory in actual clinical practice. This discrepancy
occurs partly because (a) existing palliative care programs often
do not often have the necessary infrastructure to accommodate
universal early referrals and (b) need-based referral is more in-
tuitive to referring oncologists. Randomized trials are ultimately
needed to directly compare both short- and long-term patient
outcomes related to universal referral from the time ofdiagnosis
of advanced cancer versus more selective referral based on
patient needs. Our group is also conducting an international
Delphi study to address the issue of who should be referred, bal-
ancingthelimitations inexistingevidence andclinical realities.
Despite the enthusiastic support for early specialist
palliativecarereferralinclinicalguidelinesconcurrent
with primary palliative care delivered by oncology
teams,referralisofteninitiatedonthebasisofpatient
needs instead of where the patient is along the
disease trajectory in actual clinical practice.
Because prognosis varies widely among different cancer
diagnoses, some investigators have proposed that the tim-
ing of referral should be disease specific. Gaertner et al. have
published their institutional guidelines on disease-specific
timing for integrating palliative care [16]; however, these criteria
havenotyetbeenfullyvalidatedorwidelyendorsed.Becauselife
expectancy and palliative care needs vary widely, even among
patients with the same cancer type (e.g.,triple-negativebreast
cancer has a more aggressive disease course than other types of
breastcancer),thedecisionforpalliativecarereferrallikelyneeds
to be further personalized.
Prognosis is another commonly cited time-based criterion
for outpatient referral. Similar to the advanced cancer diagnosis
criterion, the optimal timing for referral based on prognosis has
not been clearly defined.The main challenge with application of
this criterion is that clinicians often overestimate survival with
clinician prediction ofsurvival and rarely use prognostic toolsto
augment their accuracy [23].This could result in fewer eligible
patients being referred. Encouragingly, the probabilistic ques-
tionandthe“surprise”questionhaverecentlybeenshowntobe
moreaccuratethanthetemporalquestion[24].Thesequestions
may be particularly useful as triggers for palliative care referral
(e.g.,“What is the probability that the patient would be alive in 1
year?” If the clinician answered “30% or less,” the patient may be
referred). Furthermore, novel bedside prognostic tools, such as
phase angle, may improve the prognostic accuracy further [25].
Patients with physical or psychological distress are clearly
candidates forpalliative carereferral.Successful applicationof
these as referral criteria requires close collaboration between
the oncology and palliative care teams to conduct routine
symptom screening with validated questionnaire(s), a mech-
anism to trigger referral based on predefined cutoffs, and
quality improvement programs to optimize the referral
process. As shown in this study,the tools for distress screening
have not been standardized. ESAS and the distress thermom-
eteraretwosimplebedsidetoolsthathavebeenvalidatedand
adopted by several institutions [26, 27]. A randomized con-
trolled trial that compared three types of distress screening
(minimal screening vs. full screening vs. full screening plus
psychosocial referral) found no difference in the level of dis-
tress at 3 months; however, patients in the full screening plus
psychosocial referral group had lower distress scores and more
referrals compared with the minimal screening group [28].
Moreover, psychosocial referral was associated with greater
reductions in depression and anxiety. Ultimately, the cutoffs

 for referral may need to be individualized for each institution,
depending on the tools used, the local availability of specialist
palliativecare,andthelevelofprimarypalliativecaredeliveryby
the oncology team [29–31]. Finally, for patients with pre-
dominantly psychological distress, there should be communi-
cation among the oncology team, palliative care, psychiatry,
psychology, and social work services to coordinate the most
appropriate team for management of these issues.
Performance status is also commonly considered as a re-
ferral criterion because it not only is a measure of daily function
and care needs but also is strongly associated with prognosis and
treatment eligibility [32–36]. Although randomized controlled
trials supporting early palliative care included only patients with
performance status of 0–1 [6, 9], it remains unclear whether an
“enrichment” strategy that includes only patients who have
greatercareneedsbutnotthosealreadyattheend-of-life(i.e.,last
6 months) would result in greater benefits [21].Thus,the optimal
cutoff remains to be defined. Furthermore, the accuracy of
performance status assessment has been questioned. A recent
study at MD Anderson Cancer Center reported significant dis-
crepancies between palliative care specialists and oncologists in
theirECOGperformancestatusratings[37].Thus,furtherresearch
is needed to examine how performance status could be used to
trigger referrals.
End-of-life care planning represents another category for
referral. This encompasses a wide range of issues, such as
discussing advance care plans, enhancing illness understanding
and prognostic awareness, exploring further treatment options,
establishing goals of care, and transitioning to hospice care. End-
of-life discussions and early palliative care referral are both
associated with improved quality of end-of-life care [38]. Out-
patientpalliativecareclinicscanplayaparticularlyimportantrole
in facilitating these important discussions over time and help-
ing patients refine their goals of care [10]. However, the optimal
timing and nature of these interventions need to be further
studied. For example, the need for hospice referral may not be
an appropriate criterion for outpatient palliative care referral
because patients should ideally be seen by the palliative care
teammuchearlierinthediseasetrajectorythanwhenhospiceis
needed.Moreresearchalsoneedstobeconductedtodetermine
how the need for end-of-life care planning can be operational-
ized as a trigger for referral, and similar to psychological dis-
tress, which team would be best to address each need.
End-of-life discussions and early palliative care re-
ferral are both associated with improved quality of
end-of-life care. Outpatient palliative care clinics can
play a particularly important role in facilitating these
important discussions over time and helping patients
refine their goals of care.
One important consideration is whether these criteria
shouldbeusedaloneorinconjunctionwitheachother.Indeed,
among the 21 articles, 17 (81%) mentioned 2 or more criteria
for referral (Table 2). For example, the diagnosis of advanced
cancer may be a necessary criterion for referral but may be
insufficienttotriggerareferralonitsown.Glareetal.developeda
screening tool based on the NCCN guideline to identify patients
who may benefit from an outpatient palliative care referral.
Advanced cancer diagnosis, performance status, prognosis, and
symptom distress were assigned different weights, and all
contributed to a composite score that ranged from 0 to 13; a
scoreof4ormoreindicatedaneedforpalliativecarereferral[19].
This scoring system requires additional time for screening and
needs to be further validated in different institutions.
Oursystematicreviewhasseverallimitations.First,despite
our updated search, we identified only 21 articles, suggesting
that more research on outpatient palliative care and referral
criteria should be conducted. Second, a minority of the articles
(e.g., the NCCN guideline) did not indicate whether the criteria
werespecificallydesignedforoutpatientpalliative careonlyor
forbothinpatientandoutpatientservices.Thus,thismayresult
in some degree of contamination because referral criteria for
inpatients may be different. Third, we included the eligibility
criteria of randomized controlled trials of early outpatient
palliative care as referral criteria, although they may not be
specifically designed for this purpose. Finally, we focused only
on the oncology population. Referral criteria for patients in
other disease groups may be different.
CONCLUSION
Outpatient clinics are increasingly being recognized for their
critical role in facilitating early palliative care access. Our
systematic review highlighted the lack of consensus in the
literature on which patients should be referred in the am-
bulatory setting. We found general agreement that cancer
diagnosis, prognosis, physical symptoms, performance status,
psychosocial distress, and end-of-life care planning needs
should be considered when appropriate candidates are being
identified. At the same time, more work is clearly needed to
define the most appropriate assessment tools and optimal
cutoffs for routine screening and referral. Referral criteria also
need to be tailored to the local institution and to maximize
outpatient palliative care access. Importantly, the use of
standardized referral criteria should complement, instead of
replace, clinical judgment to facilitate appropriate referrals.
