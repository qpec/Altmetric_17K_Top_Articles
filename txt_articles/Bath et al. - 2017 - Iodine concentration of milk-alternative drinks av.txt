Abstract
Iodine deficiency is present in certain groups of the UK population, notably in pregnant women; this is of concern as iodine is required for
fetal brain development. UK milk is rich in iodine and is the principal dietary iodine source. UK sales of milk-alternative drinks are increasing
but data are lacking on their iodine content. As consumers may replace iodine-rich milk with milk-alternative drinks, we aimed to measure the
iodine concentration of those available in the UK. Using inductively coupled plasma-MS, we determined the iodine concentration of seven
types of milk-alternative drink (soya, almond, coconut, oat, rice, hazelnut and hemp) by analysing forty-seven products purchased in
November/December 2015. For comparison, winter samples of conventional (n 5) and organic (n 5) cows’ milk were included. The median
iodine concentration of all of the unfortified milk-alternative drinks (n 44) was low, at 7·3 μg/kg, just 1·7 % of our value for winter
conventional cows’ milk (median 438 μg/kg). One brand (not the market leader), fortified its soya, oat and rice drinks with iodine and those
drinks had a higher iodine concentration than unfortified drinks, at 280, 287 and 266 μg/kg, respectively. The iodine concentration of organic
milk (median 324 μg/kg) was lower than that of conventional milk. Although many milk-alternative drinks are fortified with Ca, at the time of
this study, just three of forty-seven drinks were fortified with iodine. Individuals who consume milk-alternative drinks that are not fortified with
iodine in place of cows’ milk may be at risk of iodine deficiency unless they consume alternative dietary iodine sources.
Key words: Iodine: Iodine deficiency: Milk: Diets: Public health: Pregnancy: United Kingdom
Iodine deficiency is of public health concern because iodine is an
essential component of the thyroid hormones, thyroxine and tri-
iodothyronine, that are required for brain and neurological devel-
opment of the fetus(1). Recent UK evidence suggests that even mild-
to-moderate iodine deficiency during early pregnancy is associated
with impaired child cognition, with lower intelligence quotient (IQ)
and reading scores in the offspring of iodine-deficient pregnant
women(2).There is concern that pregnant women(3) and teenage
girls(4) in the UK are mildly-to-moderately iodine deficient. Indeed,
the ‘Global Scorecard of Iodine Nutrition’ classifies UK pregnant
women as iodine deficient, although school-aged children are
classified as iodine sufficient(5).
Cows’ milk is a rich source of iodine in many countries, its
high iodine content being a result of dairy-farming practices(6).
The use of iodine-fortified concentrates given to cattle (parti-
cularly in the winter months) and iodine-containing disin-
fectants (iodophors) increase the natural iodine concentration
of milk(6). Though iodophor disinfectants have been replaced
by other disinfectants in some countries (e.g. in New Zealand(7)
and Australia(8)), they are still permitted(9) and used in the UK.
The iodine concentration of UK milk (median 300μg/kg from the
2008 Food Standards Agency survey)(10) is higher than that of
other countries, for example Australia (median 195μg/l (≡189 μg/
kg assuming a specific gravity of 1·03(11)))(8), Spain (mean 259 μg/l
(≡251 μg/kg))(12) and Denmark (mean 120μg/l (≡117 μg/kg))(13).
Furthermore, as the UK has no programme of iodine fortification
and the availability of iodised salt is low(14), the UK is heavily
reliant on dairy products for iodine intake. Indeed, milk and dairy
products are the principal source of dietary iodine in the UK,
accounting for approximately 33% of the intake in adults (19–64
years) and 40% in adolescents (11–18 years)(15). Consumption of
cows’ milk has been positively associated with iodine status in UK
pregnant women(16), women of childbearing age(17), adolescent
girls(4) and 8–10-year-old children(18).
Though milk consumption has remained relatively steady in
recent years, there has been a decline since the 1950s(19).
Meanwhile, plant-based drinks, particularly soya drinks, have
increasingly been used as substitutes for cows’ milk(20).
Consumers may choose these cows’ milk alternatives if they
cannot tolerate dairy products, for example, as a result of milk

There has been a surge in the number of milk alternatives on
the UK market in recent years, with companies launching var-
ious nut, rice, coconut and oat drinks. Though milk-alternative
drinks have a relatively small share of the total milk market
(2 % share by volume)(22), the sector has experienced rapid
growth in recent years(20,22). From 2011 to 2013, the volume of
milk alternatives sold (including soya and rice drinks) increased
by 155 % from 36 to 92 million litres/year(20). These drinks are
increasingly a part of mainstream shopping habits, for example,
soya (and, more recently, coconut) is offered as a milk sub-
stitute in many UK cafés and coffee chains. Almond drinks have
risen in popularity and are outselling soya drinks in some UK
supermarkets(23). It is reported that 10 % of UK consumers have
used soya drinks and 7 % have used almond drinks(24); con-
sumers of these drinks are not necessarily using them exclu-
sively, with an estimated 6–8 % of cows’ milk consumers also
using plant-based alternative drinks(24).
It is important to understand how the shift away from
iodine-rich dairy products to these milk alternatives may affect
iodine status in the UK, given the major contribution of milk and
dairy products to iodine intake(15). Although there are data on
the iodine concentration of a limited number of milk-alternative
drinks from the USA(25), there is no information on the
iodine concentration of such drinks available in the UK; the
McCance and Widdowson UK food tables only provide an
iodine value for soya drinks(11). We therefore aimed to compare
the iodine content of available milk-alternative drinks with that
of UK cows’ milk. Our hypothesis was that these drinks were an
inadequate replacement for cows’ milk with respect to dietary
iodine.
Methods
Selection of samples for laboratory analysis
We first surveyed the consumer market between October 2013
and February 2014 to establish the range of milk-alternative
products available for purchase in the UK and the extent
of
iodine
fortification(26).
That
survey
included
twenty
grocery chains (including a health-food shop), and identified
twenty-eight
brands
(including
supermarket
own-brands)
that produced milk-alternative drinks(26).
In November 2015, the results of the 2013–2014 survey(11)
were reviewed and updated (online Supplementary Table S1),
omitting flavoured drinks and those only available in health-
food shops and online. Several products had been discontinued
(including an iodine-fortified soya drink), whereas other pro-
ducts had been launched. This resulted in a list of ninety drinks
from twenty brands and this was then used to select samples for
laboratory measurement of iodine in milk-alternative drinks.
Resources were available for the measurement of approxi-
mately fifty drink samples. As it was not possible to analyse all
ninety drinks identified in the updated survey of November
2015, the following selection criteria were applied: drinks that
were: (i) long-life, (ii) unsweetened (except some sweetened
drinks, as explained below), (iii) unflavoured and (iv) widely
available from major retail outlets (i.e. not those only available
via online-only health shops). This included three drinks (soya,
oat and rice) from one brand (Marks & Spencer) that were
fortified with iodine (as potassium iodide) according to the
product label. In addition, chilled products were included from
the market leader, and some sweetened drinks where these
were labelled as ‘original’ and therefore likely to be a popular
choice with consumers (e.g. Alpro Original). Where possible,
we also included samples of drinks that incorporated seaweed
as a source of Ca as this is also a likely source of iodine. We
purchased one sample of each milk-alternative drink for
laboratory analysis.
Cows’ milk samples were also acquired at the same time as
milk-alternative drinks (November/December 2015). Samples
of supermarket own-brand fresh semi-skimmed (<2 % fat)
conventional and organic milk were obtained from five leading
supermarkets (total market share 77·0 %(27)). Semi-skimmed
milk was chosen as this is the most commonly consumed milk
type in the UK(22). Milk-alternative drinks and cows’ milk were
purchased
on two occasions
in the
winter
(November/
December 2015), either online via supermarket websites or
from stores in various locations in Surrey, UK. The samples
were transferred to the laboratory at LGC Limited. Chilled
samples were kept below 5°C until they were digested (within
48 h).
Laboratory analysis
Sample preparation and analysis were performed using a
method previously validated in-house against a primary refer-
ence method, namely isotope dilution MS(28). In brief, the
samples were first digested by mixing 0·5 g liquid (weighed to
four decimal places) in a glass vial with 5 ml of 5 % tetra-
methylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), prepared using solid
TMAH (≥ 97 %; Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in ultrapure water
(18·2 MΩ cm; Elga PureFlex; Elga Veolia). The vial was placed
in a preheated oven at 100°C for 2 h. Once cooled, 0·5 ml of
internal standard (1300 ng/ml Tellurium; Romil, in 1 % TMAH)
was added and the samples were made up to 50 g with 1 %
TMAH. Tellurium was selected as internal standard as it has a
similar ionisation energy and isotopic mass:charge ratio to
iodine and has been previously demonstrated in-house to be
suitable for use with food samples.
The iodine content in the digested samples was determined
by inductively coupled plasma-MS (8800 ICP-QQQ-MS; Agilent
Technologies)
in
standard
analysis
mode
using
external
calibration. The stock standard solution for iodine was gravime-
trically prepared in-house from high purity potassium iodide
(+99·99%; Alfa Aesar) in 5% TMAH. The calibration standards were
prepared by serial dilution of this stock, using 1% TMAH, with the
internal standard also added at the same level as in the samples.
The relative measurement uncertainty (± 10 %) was calcu-
lated using in-house validated ISO/IEC 17025 accredited pro-
cedures and in accordance with the Guide to the Expression of
Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM, JCGM 100:2008). The
method accuracy was monitored using ERM-BD150 Skimmed
Milk Powder certified reference material (LGC Standards) with a
certified iodine content of 1730 (SD 140)μg/kg (dry weight basis).

 The recovery of the certified reference material was 92% (n 4, dry
weight basis) which is within the uncertainty of the certified
reference material and the accredited measurement uncertainty.
In addition, four samples were spiked using the calibration
standard stock and showed recoveries in the range 95–99%
(relative SD ±2%). The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 3·6µg/kg.
Statistical analysis
A minimum sample size of two was required to detect a
difference in iodine concentration of at least 275 μg/kg between
the milk-alternative drinks (not fortified with iodine) and con-
ventional cows’ milk(11), with 80 % power and 5 % significance
(two-sided test). These calculations are based on mean and
standard deviation values from the literature for both conven-
tional cows’ milk(10) and milk-alternative drinks(25).
The number of samples for each matrix was small (n < 14)
and as the iodine concentration results were not normally dis-
tributed, the medians and 25th, 75th percentiles (where possi-
ble) are reported. The results for the three drinks that were
fortified with potassium iodide are reported separately to the
unfortified milk-alternative drinks.
The non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was used to
compare the difference in iodine concentration between con-
ventional cows’ milk and firstly, all matrices of milk-alternative
drinks, and secondly, organic cows’ milk.
The iodine concentration was calculated as a percentage of
that of conventional cows’ milk in three ways: (i) of winter
cows’ milk samples collected and analysed for the current
study; (ii) of summer cows’ milk samples (from a previous study
that analysed eighty samples collected in 2009 with the same
method, in the same laboratory(29)); and (iii) as an average of
the summer and winter cows’ milk values to give an all-seasons
percentage value.
Results
Iodine concentration of milk-alternative drinks
In all, forty-seven milk-alternative drinks from twenty brands
were selected for laboratory analysis, that is 51·1 % of the ninety
drinks available in November 2015 (online Supplementary
Table S1). We included samples from all twenty brands which
amounted to fourteen soya, eleven almond, six coconut, six oat,
five rice, three hazelnut and two hemp drinks. We analysed
between 30·4 (for soya) and 100 % (for hazelnut and hemp) of
available drinks within each matrix (online Supplementary
Table S1).
The majority of the samples were long-life (n 40, 85·1 %) but
seven samples (14·9 %) were chilled (online Supplementary
Table S1). Though most samples were non-organic (80·9 %),
nine organic samples (19·1 %), at least one from each matrix,
were included in the sample selection (online Supplementary
Table S1).
The unfortified milk-alternative drinks had a low iodine
concentration (Table 1; Fig. 1); the median for all milk-
alternative drinks that were not fortified with iodine (n 44)
was 7·3 µg/kg (25th, 75th percentile: 4·6, 13·4; Table 1).

Iodine content of milk alternatives

 The median iodine concentrations for the different matrices
ranged from 4·1 to 21·7 µg/kg and the results are detailed in
Table 1. A considerable number of samples (n 13; 27·7 %) had
an
iodine
concentration
that
was
below
the
LOQ
for
the assay (3·6 µg/kg). One brand of oat drink had a relatively
high iodine concentration (63·1 μg/kg) compared with other
oat-based drinks so an additional sample was analysed in the
second laboratory run to check the value. It was again found to
be high (73·4 μg/kg); the two results were averaged.
One brand (Marks & Spencer) fortified three (soya, oat and
rice) of their five milk-alternative drinks with iodine; according
to the product labels, the drinks were fortified to give an iodine
concentration of 225, 289 and 307 µg/l for the soya, oat and rice
drinks, respectively. The laboratory results for these three
fortified drinks were 280, 287, and 266 µg/kg for the soya, oat
and rice, respectively (Table 1); the iodine concentration was
considerably higher than in the unfortified drinks of the same
matrix (Fig. 1). Assuming a density of 1 g/ml for these drinks,
the measured values are within ± 0–20 % of the values reported
on the labels.
Iodine concentration of cows’ milk and comparison with
milk-alternative drinks
The conventional cows’ milk samples had a median con-
centration of 438 μg/kg, a value that was higher than all the
unfortified milk-alternative matrices. The unfortified milk-
alternative drinks had an iodine concentration that was 1·7 %
(range 0·9–4·9; Table 1) of the cows’-milk value.
The
median
iodine
concentration
of
the
organic-milk
samples
(324 μg/kg)
was
26 %
lower
than
that
of
the
conventional-milk samples, a difference that was statistically
significant (Mann–Whitney U test: P = 0·009, Table 2). The
iodine concentration of the milk-alternative drinks was con-
siderably lower than the calculated year-round values for
conventional and organic cows’ milk (344 and 234µg/kg,
respectively) (Fig. 1).
Effect of seaweed ingredient on iodine concentration
Two of the samples that were analysed – an almond drink and a
hemp drink – contained a red seaweed, Lithothamnium
calcareum, as a source of Ca. The iodine concentration of the
hemp drink with Lithothamnium calcareum was considerably
higher than that of the other hemp sample (36·3 v. 7·0 μg/kg),
whereas the iodine content of the almond sample with
added seaweed (18·0 μg/kg) was not vastly different from
that of the other almond drinks (range <3·6 (i.e. the LOQ) –
17·6 μg/kg).
Discussion
The natural iodine content of milk-alternative drinks was found
to be low, with more than a quarter of samples below the LOQ

 (< 3·6 µg/kg). The median iodine concentration of all unfortified
drinks was 2·1% (range 1·2–6·3 for the seven matrices) of that of
conventional cows’ milk (using the year-round value of 344µg/kg).
A portion (200g) of the unfortified milk-alternative drinks would
give from 0·9 to 4·3μg of iodine which is a negligible proportion of
the adult iodine intake recommendation of 150μg/d(30,31).
At the time of our study, just one brand – Marks & Spencer –
fortified its products with iodine. The product label showed
potassium iodide as an ingredient and iodine was included in the
table of nutritional information. However, only three (soya, oat and
rice) of the five matrices sold by Marks & Spencer were iodine
-fortified
(coconut
and
almond
drinks
were
not
fortified).
The fortified products had a measured iodine concentration that
was 77·3–83·4% of that of year-round cows’ milk (344μg/kg).
A portion (200g) of fortified soya, oat and rice drinks would
provide 45·0, 57·8 and 61·4μg of iodine – approximately 30–41% of
the adult iodine recommendation (150μg/d(30,31)) and thus could
be considered as a reasonable substitute for cows’ milk, in terms of
iodine content.
To our knowledge this is the largest systematic study of milk-
alternative drinks and the first to report on the iodine concentra-
tion of oat and hazelnut drinks. A recent study by Ma and
Braverman in Boston, USA, analysed thirty-one milk-alternative
drinks and, in support of our findings, found that the mean iodine
concentration of the drinks (12·4μg/l) was low in comparison
with US cows’ milk (387 μg/l)(25). Ma and Braverman included
drinks that were not available on the UK market at the time of our
study (e.g. walnut and pistachio drinks) and had smaller numbers
of rice, soya and hemp drinks than we did. They did not report the
iodine concentration for each different matrix but by using the
values provided in their paper, and assuming a density of 1g/ml,
the median iodine concentration was similar to our result for soya
drinks (12·7 v. 11·6 μg/kg), slightly higher for almond drinks (8·4
v. 5·6μg/kg) and slightly lower for coconut drinks (5·4 v. 8·4μg/kg).
Iodine concentration was measured in one sample of a rice drink
(iodine concentration: 29μg/l) and four samples of a soya drink
(iodine concentration range: 15–27μg/l) in Australia(32); the iodine
concentration values were slightly higher than ours but the sample
size was very small. The iodine concentration given for soya drink
in the McCance and Widdowson food tables (6th edition)(11), at
10μg/kg, is similar to our median value for soya.
The products of the major brands of the milk-alternative market
(e.g. Alpro or Dream) are not fortified with iodine (these include
soya, oat, almond, rice and hazelnut drinks). It is interesting to
note that many milk alternatives, including those of the market
leaders, often state on the label that they are enriched with Ca
(and sometimes vitamin B12) to match the profile of cows’ milk
but no attempt has been made to match the iodine content.
Dietitians would likely recommend that patients who follow a
milk-free diet use a milk-alternative product that is fortified with
Ca but they are less likely to consider the necessity of replacing
the missing iodine(21,33–35). Goats’ milk is sometimes used as an
alternative to cows’ milk, although it is not a suitable substitute for
those with cows’ milk protein allergy(21); the iodine concentration
of goats’ milk is higher than that of cows’ milk(10). Our results
suggest that the majority of individuals who switch to milk-
alternative drinks will not make up the missing iodine, as the
iodine-fortified drinks are not available in popular supermarket
chains. Indeed, we have previously found that iodine status (as
assessed by 24h iodine excretion) was lower in consumers of
soya drinks in a group of UK women of childbearing age,
reflecting the negative correlation between intake of soya drinks
and cows’ milk(17). However, the number of women who con-
sumed soya drinks was small (n 5) and therefore further research
would be required to confirm those findings.
Some drinks used red seaweed, Lithothamnium calcareum,
for Ca fortification but our results suggest that this had little
effect on their iodine concentration (although our sample size
was small). The manufacturer of the hemp drink confirmed that
a seaweed extract, Aquamin F, was added to the drink at 0·35 %
(Good Hemp, personal communication, July 2014). Aquamin is
a multi-mineral ingredient produced from the red alga, species
Lithothamnion(36)
with
a
reported
iodine
concentration
of <9(37) to 32·8 mg/kg(38). Thus, at 0·35 %, the Aquamin would
provide 31·5–114·8 µg/kg. Food Standards Australia New Zeal-
and has analysed the iodine concentration of drinks fortified with
seaweed products, including Aquamin, and found that samples of
soya (n 6) and rice drinks (n 3) had a mean iodine concentration
of 40 (range 10–100) and 50 (range 40–60)µg/kg, respectively(39).
Though this is considerably higher than the values we found for
seaweed-fortified
drinks,
40–50 µg
iodine/kg
is
still
con-
siderably lower than the 266–280 µg/kg in iodine-fortified
drinks or the 438 µg/kg in cows’ milk
It is important to point out that the iodine concentration of
the red seaweed extract product, Aquamin F, is relatively low in
comparison with that of the brown seaweed kombu (or kelp;
family name Laminariaceae), which has an approximate iodine
concentration of 2400 mg/kg(10). Indeed, in December 2009,
Food Standards Australia New Zealand recalled batches of
soya drinks that had been fortified with kombu(40) as the soya-
drink product had an extremely high iodine concentration
(25 000 µg/l)(32) and had been associated with iodine excess
and iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction(32); the product was
subsequently reformulated and returned to market in April
2010(41). This experience has highlighted the need for manu-
facturers to give careful consideration to the source of iodine
that they use if they wish to fortify their products with iodine.
Soyabeans are a known goitrogenic food as they contain
isoflavones that can inhibit the thyroid peroxidase enzyme that
is required for thyroid hormone synthesis(1). In iodine-replete
individuals, soya intake has little effect on thyroid function(42).
However, individuals who consume high quantities of soya
drinks (and hence goitrogenic isoflavones) against the back-
ground of a low iodine intake (as may be the case in consumers
of milk-alternative drinks), may theoretically be at risk of thyr-
oid dysfunction; data are needed in this area.
Organic v. conventional milk
As in our previous work(29), we found that samples of organically-
produced milk had a lower iodine concentration than conven-
tional milk. The percentage difference between organic and
conventional milk in the current study, conducted in the winter
months, was smaller than in our previous study (26 v. 42%(29)),
where samples were collected in the summer months(29). Another
UK study, conducted in the winter of 2014, found that organic

 milk was 32·2–35·5 % lower in iodine(43). These values might
suggest that the difference between organic and conventional
milk has reduced over time. Indeed, the Organic Milk Suppliers
Co-operative (OMSCo), which represents 65% of UK organic-milk
producers, issued a press release in February 2016 that stated that
the iodine concentration in organic milk was now comparable to
that of conventional milk(44). However, as that report is not
published nor available to the public, it is not possible to review
either the milk-sampling methodology or the accuracy of the
iodine-concentration measurements. In fact, data from other stu-
dies also showed a smaller difference between mean iodine
concentration in organic and conventional milk in the winter than
in the summer(45,46), as do data from the UK Food Standards
Agency 2008 study of iodine in milk(10). We conclude that our
finding of lower iodine in organic milk suggests that while it is a
reasonable source of iodine, it still does not match the iodine
content of conventional milk. This is likely to result from restric-
tions on mineral-fortified concentrates in organic farming, as well
as a reliance on clover as a natural nitrogen-fixer (used in place of
artificial fertilisers)(47); certain strains of white clover contains
goitrogens that may reduce the carry-over from feed to milk by
blocking the iodine transporter in the mammary gland(48). If the
organic sector is making changes that might affect milk-iodine
content (as suggested by OMSCo(44)), future monitoring of milk-
iodine concentration will be required.
Limitations
Our survey is cross-sectional in nature and therefore the results
are limited to the current market; in future years manufacturers
may become more iodine-aware and begin to fortify their milk-
alternative products. A second limitation is the fact that our
sampling was restricted to one time-point in the year (autumn/
winter). Although we do not expect milk-alternative drinks to
exhibit the same large seasonal variation that is seen in cows’
milk iodine concentration(6,10), it is possible that there is varia-
bility in the iodine concentration of milk-alternative drinks as a
result of seasonal variation in the crops used for their manu-
facture (e.g. soyabeans). However, in view of the generally low
iodine concentration in plants, any variation is likely to have
minimal impact on iodine intake and status. Furthermore, as we
included both chilled and long-life milk-alternative drinks, with
a use-by date between 1 and 11 months from the purchase date,
the manufacture of the drinks is unlikely to have been from the
same time as the purchase month and may therefore include
some seasonal variation. As our sampling of cows’ milk was
limited to the winter months in the current study, we also
compared the iodine concentration of milk-alternative drinks
with that of summer milk from 2009(29), as well as an all-seasons
value calculated from the iodine concentration of both winter
and summer milk. We did not collect information on the geo-
graphical source of the ingredients which may have affected
their iodine concentration. However, as we sampled from
twenty brands that are likely to use different sources for their
ingredients, we may have captured some variation in iodine
concentration relating to geographical location. As the iodine
concentration of most drinks was very low, any variation is
unlikely to change our conclusions. Finally, sample sizes were
relatively small for some drinks (e.g. hazelnut and hemp) and
we only sampled one drink for each product. It is for this reason
that we have reported results as an average value and an
average for each matrix rather than a value for each of the
products that we analysed. We therefore recommend that future
surveys of nutrients in food should include a wider variety
of milk alternatives to provide values for the UK food table
(currently, the only milk-alternative drink in the table is
soya(11)).
In conclusion, unfortified milk alternatives have negligible
iodine content and are not suitable substitutes for cows’ milk in
terms of iodine provision. Individuals who consume these
products need to ensure adequate iodine intake from alter-
native dietary sources, such as seafood and eggs. For those who
cannot, or do not, consume these iodine-rich foods, use of an
iodine-containing supplement (though not kelp or seaweed
owing to risk of iodine excess(49)) should be considered, par-
ticularly in women of child-bearing age. Other manufacturers
could consider fortifying milk-alternative drinks with iodine in
order to match the profile of cows’ milk, particularly as milk is
the premier source of iodine in the UK diet.
