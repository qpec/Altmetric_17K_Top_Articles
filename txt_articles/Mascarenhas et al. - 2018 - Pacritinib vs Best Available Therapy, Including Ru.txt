IMPORTANCE Myelofibrosis is a hematologic malignancy characterized by splenomegaly and
debilitating symptoms. Thrombocytopenia is a poor prognostic feature and limits use of
Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor ruxolitinib.
OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy and safety of JAK2 inhibitor pacritinib with that of best
available therapy (BAT), including ruxolitinib, in patients with myelofibrosis and
thrombocytopenia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this phase 3 randomized international multicenter
study—the PERSIST-2 study—of pacritinib vs BAT, 311 patients with myelofibrosis and platelet
count 100 × 109/L or less were recruited for analysis. Crossover from BAT was allowed after
week 24 or for progression of splenomegaly.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to pacritinib 400 mg once daily, pacritinib
200 mg twice daily, or BAT.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coprimary end points were rates of patients achieving 35%
or more spleen volume reduction (SVR) and 50% or more reduction in total symptom score
(TSS) at week 24. Efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat efficacy
population, comprising all patients with a randomization date allowing for week 24 data.
RESULTS Overall, 311 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.70 [9.08] years; 171 men [55%] and 140
women [45%]) were included in the study; 149 patients (48%) had prior ruxolitinib. The most
common BAT was ruxolitinib (44 patients [45%]); 19 patients (19%) received
watchful-waiting only. The intention-to-treat efficacy population included 75 patients
randomized to pacritinib once daily; 74, pacritinib twice daily, and 72, BAT. Pacritinib (arms
combined) was more effective than BAT for 35% or more SVR (27 patients [18%] vs 2 patients
[3%]; P = .001) and had a nonsignificantly greater rate of 50% or more reduction in TSS (37
patients [25%] vs 10 patients [14%]; P = .08). Pacritinib twice daily led to significant
improvements in both end points over BAT (�35% SVR: 16 patients [22%] vs 2 patients [3%];
P = .001; �50% reduction in TSS: 24 patients [32%] vs 10 patients [14%]; P = .01). Clinical
improvement in hemoglobin and reduction in transfusion burden were greatest with
pacritinib twice daily. For pacritinib once daily, pacritinib twice daily, and BAT, the most
common (>10%) grade 3 or 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (32 patients [31%], 34
patients [32%], 18 patients [18%]), and anemia (28 patients [27%], 23 patients [22%], 14
patients [14%]). In the pacritinib once daily, twice daily, and BAT arms, discontinuation owing
to adverse events occurred in 15 patients (14%), 10 patients (9%), and 4 patients (4%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia,
including those with prior anti-JAK therapy, pacritinib twice daily was more effective than
BAT, including ruxolitinib, for reducing splenomegaly and symptoms.

Methods
Patients
Adult patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis were
eligible if they had intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high-
risk disease by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring
System(DIPSS),plateletcountlessthanorequalto100 × 109/L,
and palpable splenomegaly 5 cm or larger below the left
costal margin. Additional eligibility criteria included: total
symptom score (TSS) greater than or equal to 13 on the Myelo-
proliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form Total
Symptom Score (MPN-SAF TSS 2.0); Eastern Cooperative On-
cology Group performance status 0 to 3 (scale from 0 to 5, with
0 indicating no symptoms and higher numbers indicating in-
creasingdisability);peripheralbloodblastcountlessthan10%;
absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5 × 109/L; adequate
liver and renal function; and life expectancy 6 months or
longer. Prior treatment with 1 or 2 other JAK inhibitors was
allowed. Patients with active bleeding requiring hospitaliza-
tion during screening or significant cardiac abnormalities
(eg, recent history of myocardial infarction, severe/unstable
angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, ongoing
grade ≥3 dysrhythmias, prolonged QTc) were excluded
(eMethods in Supplement 1). The study was approved by the
institutional review boards at each participating institution
and conducted in accordance with the principles outlined in
the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written
informed consent, and the trial protocol is available in
Supplement 2.
Randomization and Treatment
Patients were centrally randomized 1:1:1 via interactive web or
voice response system to pacritinib 400 mg once daily, pacri-
tinib 200 mg twice daily, or BAT; BAT included any physician-
selected treatment for myelofibrosis, symptom-directed treat-
ment, or watch-and-wait. Randomization was stratified by
geographic region, risk category, and rebound platelet count.
Note, “rebound” refers to recovery of platelet count between
informed consent and randomization, indicating likelihood of
drug-induced thrombocytopenia rather than thrombocyto-
penia associated with myelofibrosis (eMethods in Supplement
1). Permuted blocks within strata were used to restrict treat-
ment allocation. A patient’
s treatment assignment was known
to the investigator, site personnel, the patient, clinical moni-
tors, and pharmacovigilance personnel. The sponsor re-
mained blinded until database lock for the primary analysis
and independent radiographic assessors remained blinded
throughout the study. Patients in all arms were to be treated
until progressive disease, unacceptable toxic effects, or the pa-
tient no longer derived benefit from treatment (eMethods in
Supplement 1). Patients randomized to BAT could cross over
to pacritinib for progression of splenomegaly or after 24 weeks
of treatment with or without progression.
Key Points
Question Is pacritinib (400 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily)
superior to best available therapy for patients with myelofibrosis
and thrombocytopenia?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 311 patients, pacritinib
200 mg twice daily was significantly more effective than best
available therapy, including ruxolitinib, for reducing splenomegaly
and symptoms in patients with myelofibrosis and
thrombocytopenia, including those with prior ruxolitinib.
Meaning Pacritinib can provide a treatment option for patients
with myelofibrosis and baseline thrombocytopenia, for whom
current treatment options are limited.

 End Points
Theprimaryobjectivewastocomparetheefficacyofthepooled
pacritinib arms with BAT. The efficacy coprimary end points
were the proportions of patients achieving 35% or more SVR
(computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging [CT/
MRI]) and 50% or more reduction in TSS (MPN-SAF TSS 2.0)
from baseline to week 24. A secondary objective was to sepa-
rately compare efficacy of pacritinib once daily or twice daily
vs BAT. Exploratory end points included overall survival,
changes in hematologic parameters, and additional patient-
reported outcomes. Safety and tolerability were assessed from
time of informed consent through last day of study participa-
tion. Pharmacokinetics of pacritinib were characterized to as-
sessexposureandexposure-responserelationships(safetyand

Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 300 patients was planned to provide greater
than 99% power in detecting treatment differences (pacri-
tinib vs BAT) in SVR and TSS reduction at α level (2-sided) of
.05. This sample size also provided 96% and greater than 99%
power to detect treatment differences (pacritinib once daily
or pacritinib twice daily vs BAT) in SVR and TSS reduction, re-
spectively, at α level (2-sided) of .025. A 20% and 45% differ-
ence in the proportion of pacritinib vs BAT patients with 35%
or more SVR and 50% ore more reduction in TSS at week 24,
respectively, was assumed for power calculation. Efficacy
analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat efficacy
population, comprising all patients with a randomization date
allowing for week 24 data (≥22 weeks prior to clinical hold).
Treatment differences in proportion of patients achieving SVR
or TSS reduction were tested using the Fisher exact test, and
confidence intervals were based on the Agresti-Caffo method.
Time-to-event analyses were censored on the date of clinical
hold. The safety population included all patients who re-
ceived 1 or more dose of study treatment. Final end-of-
treatment data were used.
Results
Patients and Study Treatment
From July 2014 to February 2016, 311 patients were random-
ized to pacritinib once daily (n = 104), pacritinib twice daily
(n = 107), or BAT (n = 100; Figure 1). The most commonly used
active single agents in the BAT arm were ruxolitinib (n = 44
[45%]), hydroxyurea (n = 19 [19%]), and prednisone and/or
prednisolone (n = 13 [13%]); 19 patients (19%) received watch-
ful-waiting only (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). One patient ran-
domized to pacritinib twice daily and 2 patients randomized
to BAT withdrew before receiving treatment and were ex-
cluded from the safety population. The intention-to-treat
efficacy population included 75, 74, and 72 patients random-
ized to pacritinib once daily, twice daily, and BAT, respec-
tively. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were
balanced across arms (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). One-
hundred fifteen patients (52%) had an intermediate-2 DIPSS
score, and 66 (30%) had high-risk DIPSS scores. In the pacri-
tinib once daily, twice daily, and BAT arms, 38 patients (51%),
31 patients (42%), and 32 patients (44%) had baseline platelet
count less than 50 × 109/L, respectively.
After 23, 25, and 21 median weeks on pacritinib once daily,
twice daily, and BAT, respectively, all 308 treated patients had
discontinued therapy (eTable 3 in Supplement 1); of the pa-
tients that had discontinued therapy 62 of 104 patients treated
with pacritinib once daily, 75 of 106 patients treated with pac-
ritinib twice daily, and 27 of 98 patients treated with BAT were
discontinued due to institution of the clinical hold. The ma-
jority of BAT discontinuations were owing to crossover to pac-
ritinib; 50 of 98 patients (51%) treated with BAT crossed over
primarily (n = 43 [86%]) at or after week 24. Of these pa-
tients, 39 (78%) continued on pacritinib until the clinical hold.
Prior to the hold, discontinuations owing to adverse events
trended higher with pacritinib once daily (15 patients [14%])
vs other arms (10 patients [9%] with pacritinib twice daily, 4
patients [4%] with BAT), and discontinuation due to progres-
sivediseasetrendedhigherwithBAT(10patients[10%])vspac-
ritinib (once daily, 5 patients [5%]; twice daily, 7 patients [7%]).
At the time of the clinical hold, 76 patients (71%) randomized
to pacritinib twice daily vs 61 patients (59%) randomized to
pacritinib once daily were on study treatment. Dose interrup-
tions due to adverse events were higher with pacritinib (once
daily, 39 patients [38%]; twice daily, 29 patients [27%]) vs BAT
(10 patients [10%]) and dose reductions due to adverse events
were higher with pacritinib once daily (21 patients [20%]) vs
other arms (13 patients [12%] with pacritinib twice daily; 7 pa-
tients [7%] with BAT) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1).
Spleen Volume Reduction
At week 24, 27 patients (18%) on pacritinib arms (11 [15%], pac-
ritiniboncedaily;16[22%],pacritinibtwicedaily)achievedSVR
35% or more compared with 2 patients (3%) on BAT (P = .001,
P = .02, P = .001, respectively (Table) (Figure 2). Only 1 of 32
patients(3%)ontheBATarmwhoreceivedruxolitinibachieved
SVR 35% or more. Of note, the majority of ruxolitinib-treated
patients began with 5 mg twice daily dosing (at discretion of
treating physician). With pacritinib once daily and twice daily,
SVR 35% or more was achieved in 2 patients (6%) and 4 pa-
tients (13%) with prior ruxolitinib (Table). Additional sub-
group analyses demonstrated pacritinib patients achieved SVR
35% or more regardless of subgroup, including as defined by
sex, age, JAK2 V617F mutation status, prior treatment with
JAK2 inhibitors, and baseline cytopenias (eFigure 1 in
Supplement 1).

 Symptom Reduction
Atweek24,37patients(25%)onpacritinibarms(13[17%],once
daily; 24 [32%], twice daily) achieved reduction in TSS 50%
or more, compared with 10 patients (14%) on BAT (P = .08,
P = .65, and P = .01, respectively) (Table) (Figure 2). Six of 32
patients (19%) on BAT who received ruxolitinib achieved re-
duction in TSS 50% or more. With pacritinib once daily and
twice daily, TSS reduction greater than or equal to 50% was
achieved in 3 patients (10%) and 10 patients (32%) with prior
ruxolitinib (Table). Median percent change in TSS at week 24
was −27%, −41%, and −15% with pacritinib once daily, twice
daily, and BAT, respectively. Median percent change in indi-
vidual MPN-SAF TSS 2.0 symptom scores also showed greater
improvements with pacritinib once daily and twice daily in 7
of 8 and 8 of 8 symptoms, respectively, vs BAT (eFigure 2 in
Supplement1).Additionally,thenumberofpatientswithmuch-
improved or very much–improved Patient Global Impression
Assessment scores were 16 of 45 (36%) and 26 of 46 (57%) with

(eFigure 3 in Supplement 1).
Overall Survival

pacritinib (4 patients [8%]) vs those who did not (10 patients
[20%]). Subgroup analyses for survival by risk factors showed

 RBC transfusion-independent at baseline (Gale criteria14), the
proportion of patients with reduced RBC transfusion burden
at week 24 was higher with pacritinib once daily (7 of 37 pa-
tients [19%]) and pacritinib twice daily (8 of 36 patients [22%])
vs BAT (3 of 35 patients [9%]). Transfusion independence (Gale
criteria14)wasachievedin2patients,1eachwithpacritinibonce
daily and twice daily. For patients with hemoglobin less than
10 g/dL at baseline, the proportion of patients with clinical im-
provement in hemoglobin at week 24 (International Working
Group response criteria, increase of ≥2.0 g/dL or RBC transfu-
sion independence for ≥8 weeks prior) was greatest with pac-
ritinib twice daily (11 of 44 patients [25%]) vs pacritinib once
daily (6 of 45 patients [13%]) or BAT (5 of 41 patients [12%]).
For patients with baseline platelet count less than 50 × 109/L,
median percent changes in platelets through week 24 are
shown in eFigure 7 in Supplement 1. No evidence for increas-
ing thrombocytopenia or neutropenia with pacritinib or BAT
was noted.
Pharmacokinetics
As predicted by pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation
data,in144pacritinib-treatedpatientswithupto24-weekpost-
dosesamples,pacritinibtwicedailywasassociatedwithhigher
systemic exposure (ie, steady state minimum serum concen-
tration [Cmin]) relative to pacritinib once daily (eTable 4 in
Supplement 1). In an exposure-response analysis, no trends
weredetectedforarelationshipbetweenobservedsteadystate
Cminanddeath,cardiovasculardeath,hemorrhagicdeath,car-
diac events (grade ≥2 or ≥3), hemorrhagic events, thrombocy-
topenia (grade ≥2 or ≥3), anemia (grade ≥2 or ≥3), gastrointes-
tinal events (any grade, grade ≥2, or ≥3), or maximum QTcF
greater than 450 ms. Treatment with pacritinib twice daily but
not once daily was associated with a trend for increased SVR
and TSS reduction with increased Cmin.
Safety
The most commonly reported (≥15%) nonhematologic ad-
verse events with pacritinib were gastrointestinal adverse
events, fatigue, peripheral edema, and dizziness; with BAT (in-
cluding 19 patients with watchful-waiting only) were abdomi-
nal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and peripheral edema (eTable 3 in
Supplement 1); the majority of common nonhematologic ad-
verseeventsweregrade1or2inseverity.Diarrheawasthemost

[48%] vs 70 instances [67%]) (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). Di-
arrhea was manageable with standard antidiarrheal agents (eg,
loperamide) and generally resolved within 1 to 2 weeks (eTable
5 in Supplement 1). The most common adverse event leading
todiscontinuationwasthrombocytopeniawithpacritinibonce
daily (4 instances [4%]) and BAT (2 instances [2%]) and ane-
mia with pacritinib twice daily (3 instances [3%] (eTable 6 in
Supplement 1). Rate of on-study death was lowest with pac-
ritinib twice daily (6 instances [6%]) vs BAT (9 instances [9%])
or pacritinib once daily (14 instances [14%] (eTable 7 in
Supplement 1).

tients with a baseline platelet count less than 50 × 109/L vs
50 × 109/L or more with BAT (22 patients [52%] vs 21 patients

eMethods in Supplement 1) were reported at similar rates in
all arms (67 patients [32%], pacritinib once daily or twice daily;
27 patients [28%], BAT) and were most commonly peripheral
edema in all arms (13%-20%). Grade 3 or 4 cardiac events were

 reported in 13 patients (13%) treated with pacritinib once daily,
7 patients (7%) treated with pacritinib twice daily, and 9 pa-
tients (9%) treated with BAT (eTable 8 in Supplement 1). No
cardiac event led to discontinuation of therapy in 2 or more
patients (eTable 6 in Supplement 1). Bleeding events (per stan-
dardized MedDRA query, see eMethods in Supplement 1) were
reported at similar rates in all arms (37 patients [36%], 45 pa-
tients[42%],and40patients[41%]treatedwithpacritinibonce
daily, twice daily, and BAT, respectively) and were most com-
monly epistaxis in all arms (11%-13%). Grade 3 or 4 bleeding
events were reported in 7 patients (7%), 15 patients (14%), and
7 patients (7%) treated with pacritinib once daily, twice daily,
andBAT,respectively(eTable8inSupplement1).Epistaxiswas
the only bleeding event that led to discontinuation in 2 or more
patients(1pacritinibtwicedaily,1BAT)(eTable6inSupplement
1). Rates of grade 3 or 4 bleeding events were similar for pa-
tients with baseline platelet count less than 50 × 109/L vs
50 × 109/L or more with pacritinib twice daily (7 patients [15%]
vs 8 patients [14%]) and higher for those with less than
50 × 109/L with pacritinib once daily (6 patients [12%] vs 1 pa-
tient [2%]) and BAT (5 patients [12%] vs 2 patients [4%]).
When the clinical hold was put in place and patients
abruptly discontinued pacritinib, spleen size increased, and
symptoms recurred rapidly and were difficult to control. While
withdrawal syndrome is a potential safety concern, the lon-
ger elimination half-life of pacritinib (approximately 40 hours)
may reduce exposure more gradually.
Discussion
Myelofibrosis is a chronic progressive myeloproliferative neo-
plasm with no proven therapeutic options for patients with
thrombocytopenia,2 which increases in prevalence and sever-
ity with disease progression.6 Patients ineligible for, or who fail
therapy with JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, lack therapeutic
options and have extremely poor prognosis.15 In the primary
analysis of the PERSIST-2 study at week 24, the combined pac-
ritinib arms were significantly more effective than BAT for SVR
andtrendedtowardimprovedTSSreductioninpatientswithmy-
elofibrosis and thrombocytopenia. The benefit of pacritinib in
terms of SVR and TSS reduction was observed in patients with
baselineplateletcountlessthan50 × 109/Landthosewithprior
ruxolitinib treatment (comprising >40% of patients). The pac-
ritinib twice daily arm met both coprimary SVR and TSS reduc-
tionendpoints.Thepharmacokineticprofileofpacritinibtwice
daily also supports the use of this dose schedule.
Pacritinib was well tolerated and gastrointestinal toxic ef-
fects were generally low grade, less frequent with twice daily
dosing,andrarelyledtotreatmentdiscontinuation.Clinicalim-
provementinhemoglobinandreductionintransfusionrequire-
ments were also more frequent in patients who received pac-
ritinib, particularly with twice-daily dosing. A potential
increased risk of grade 3 or 4 bleeding was noted with pacri-
tinib twice daily but appeared to be independent of platelet
count. Rate of grade 3 or 4 cardiac events was lowest with pac-
ritinibtwicedailyvsotherarmsandnocardiacfailureordeaths
due to cardiac events occurred with pacritinib twice daily.
Limitations
Studytruncationduetotheclinicalholdcompromisedtheabil-
ity to evaluate the effect of treatment on week 24 end points
(including coprimary end points) by reducing the effective
sample size, and also compromised time-to-event end points
(including overall survival) by reducing follow-up time for as-
sessment that would enable analyses that follow the intention-
to-treat principle.16 Time-to-event analyses were also con-
founded by patient crossover. Truncation of the study also
limited the follow-up of patients for additional safety data. De-
spite these limitations, pacritinib 200 mg twice daily was more
effective than BAT with a benefit-risk profile that compared
favorably with pacritinib once daily and BAT.
Conclusions
The results of PERSIST-2 demonstrate the clinical benefit of
pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis and thrombocytope-
nia (platelet count ≤100 × 109/L), including those with prior
JAK2 inhibitor therapy.

Improved JAK Inhibition in Myelofibrosis—
The Long Road Ahead

Whoever strives with all his might, that man we can redeem.

Myelofibrosis (MF) is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis,
extramedullary hematopoiesis and abnormal cytokine expres-
sion, which often manifest with severe splenomegaly, crip-
pling constitutional symptoms and cytopenias.2 The identifi-
cation of the Janus kinase 2
(JAK2) V617F mutation and
the subsequent approval of
ruxolitinib for the treatment
of intermediate-risk and high-risk MF by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 2011 changed the therapeutic land-
scapeinMF.2Ruxolitinibeffectivelyreducedsplenomegalyand
improved constitutional symptoms and quality of life in pa-
tients with intermediate-2 or high International Prognostic
Scoring System risk compared with placebo or best available
therapy (BAT) in the randomized phase 3 COMFORT I and
COMFORT II trials, respectively.2
Use of ruxolitinib is, however, not without significant
limitations.2 Ruxolitinib is not a curative therapy and has a lim-
iteddisease-modifyingeffectatbest.IntheCOMFORTtrials,the
JAK2V617Fallelefrequencywasreducedonlyby7%to21%and
improvement in marrow fibrosis was minimal.2 This is not sur-
