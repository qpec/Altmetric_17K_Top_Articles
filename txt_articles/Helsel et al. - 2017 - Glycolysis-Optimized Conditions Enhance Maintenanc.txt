SUMMARY
The application of spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation for regenerating male fertility requires amplification of SSC number
in vitro during which the integrity to re-establish spermatogenesis must be preserved. Conventional conditions supporting proliferation
of SSCs from mouse pups have been the basis for developing methodology with adult human cells but are unrefined. We found that the
integrity to regenerate spermatogenesis after transplantation declines with advancing time in primary cultures of pup SSCs and that
the efficacy of deriving cultures from adult SSCs is limited with conventional conditions. To address these deficiencies, we optimized
the culture environment to favor glycolysis as the primary bioenergetics process. In these conditions, regenerative integrity of pup
and adult SSCs was significantly improved and the efficiency of establishing primary cultures was 100%. Collectively, these findings sug-
gest that SSCs are primed for conditions favoring glycolytic activity, and matching culture environments to their bioenergetics is critical
for maintaining functional integrity.
INTRODUCTION
In mammalian testes, spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are
a rare subset of the undifferentiated spermatogonial popu-
lation that is tasked with providing continuity to the sper-
matogenic lineage (Oatley and Brinster, 2008, 2012). In
addition, SSCs possess regenerative capacity, and following
isolation from a donor testis can be transplanted into germ
cell-depleted recipient testes to re-establish spermatogen-
esis. The transplantation paradigm has been demonstrated
in rodent and non-human primate models (Brinster and
Avarbock, 1994; Brinster and Zimmermann, 1994; Her-
mann et al., 2012). Although the methodology has not
yet been translated to humans, autologous transplantation
of SSCs isolated from a testicular biopsy prior to chemo-
therapy is a potential treatment for re-establishing fertility
in both adult and adolescent cancer patients (Kubota and
Brinster, 2006). However, due to their rarity, achieving
fertility restoration by transplanting the few SSCs collected
from a biopsy is unlikely. Therefore, in vitro expansion
of SSC numbers is critical for clinical application of
transplantation.
Devising culture conditions for human SSCs is limited by
lack of an assay to directly assess survival and growth of the
cells. Indeed, previous studies have relied on the use of mo-
lecular markers and xenotransplantation of cultured hu-
man testis cells into the seminiferous tubules of immune
deficient mice to assess whether SSCs were present (Nagano
et al., 2002; Ramathal et al., 2014, 2015; Sadri-Ardekani
et al., 2009, 2011). These approaches do not provide
definitive measures of SSCs because molecular markers spe-
cific for regenerative spermatogonia in humans are unde-
fined and even though presumptive germ cell colonies
composed of short chains of cells form in xenotransplanta-
tions, the spermatogenic lineage is not fully regenerated,
thereby limiting utility of the assay for assessing SSC integ-
rity directly.
In contrast to human germ cell cultures, primary cultures
of mouse undifferentiated spermatogonia can be estab-
lished and maintained for extended periods of time in
relatively minimal conditions. All culture methodology re-
ported to date is based on standard conditions that include:
(1) chemically defined or complex StemPro-based serum-
free medium; (2) supplementation of base medium with a
growth factor cocktail of glial cell line-derived neurotro-
phic factor (GDNF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2),
and a lipid or free fatty acid mixture; (3) co-culture with
mitotically inactivated somatic feeder cells (MEF [mouse
embryonic fibroblast], STO [SIM mouse embryo-derived
thioguanine and ouabain resistant], or testicular stromal
cells); and (4) maintenance in an atmosphere of 5% CO2
and 21% O2 tension. A multitude of studies have demon-
strated maintenance of heterogeneous undifferentiated
spermatogonial populations in these conditions that are
composed of a small number of SSCs and abundant non-
stem cell progenitor spermatogonia (Kanatsu-Shinohara
et al., 2003, 2011; Kubota et al., 2004b; Oatley et al.,
2009; Schmidt et al., 2011; Seandel et al., 2007; Takashima
et al., 2015). Importantly, a robust transplantation assay is
in place to directly assess the maintenance of SSC regener-
ative integrity in the primary cultures (Helsel and Oatley,
2017). For these reasons, cultures of mouse cells are an
attractive platform for optimizing conditions that may be
applicable to a wide range of other mammalian species
including humans. Although in place for over a decade, un-
derstanding of the impacts of conventional conditions on

 regenerative integrity during long-term culture is still
limited.
While previous studies have assessed the ramifications
of long-term culture on maintenance of genetic and epige-
netic parameters, the outcomes are difficult to interpret,
especially in the context of regenerative medicine. Studies
by Kanatsu-Shinohara et al. (2005) explored expansion of
SSC numbers and epigenetic imprinting in primary mouse
cultures over a period of 2 years. Outcomes revealed no
alterations in the imprinting patterns of three paternally
methylated regions and two maternally methylated re-
gions (Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2005). However, consid-
ering that the cultures examined are a heterogeneous mix
of rare SSCs and much more abundant progenitors, inter-
preting these findings in regard to SSCs specifically is chal-
lenging. In addition, a nuance of those studies is that cul-
tures were established from postnatal day 0 (P0) pups, an
age point in development where the germ cell population
comprises prospermatogonial precursors that have yet to
transition to SSCs. Considering that the prospermatogo-
nia-to-SSC transition happens prior to birth in humans
(Ginsberg et al., 2010), the relevance of these findings to
culture of SSCs isolated from prepubertal boys or men is
not clear. Indeed, studies by Schmidt et al. (2011) reported
a significant decline in the number of SSCs in primary cul-
tures that were established from P6–P8 pups over a period
of 18 months without a concomitant alteration in DNA
methylation at imprinted genes. Thus, although previous
studies have provided some insight into the persistence
of SSCs in long-term cultures, the question of whether
SSC regenerative integrity is preserved has not been fully
addressed.
A limited number of studies have evaluated primary cul-
tures of undifferentiated spermatogonia established from
adult mice (Schmidt et al., 2011; Seandel et al., 2007), but
the relative SSC content and regenerative integrity over
an extended period of in vitro proliferation have not
been reported. Indeed, a majority of studies regarding cul-
ture of rodent SSCs utilized testis cells isolated from prepu-
bertal or neonatal donors. However, studies of Seandel et al.
(2007) reported persistence of SSCs over a 2-year period in
cultures established from adult testis cells, although quan-
tification of SSC content at various points throughout the
culture period were not provided. Moreover, maintenance
of regenerative integrity to re-establish the entire sper-
matogenic lineage was not assessed. Because parameters
associated with cultures from adult mice are reflective of
establishing cultures from men, assessing the efficiency
by which they can be established and maintenance of
SSC regenerative integrity is imperative.
In the present study, we found a negative association
between time of maintenance and regenerative integrity
of SSCs in primary cultures of undifferentiated spermato-
gonia established from cells isolated from testes of pup
and adult mice that were maintained in conventional
conditions. To address the deficiency, we sought to refine
culture conditions based on our understanding of the
biochemistry of SSCs. Our previous studies revealed that
expression of key enzymes that regulate glycolysis are
elevated in SSCs of primary undifferentiated spermatogo-
nial cultures (Chan et al., 2014). Thus, we examined the
impacts of modifying culture conditions to favor utiliza-
tion of glycolysis as the primary bioenergetics process.
When maintained in glycolysis-optimized (GO) condi-
tions, the capacity of SSCs to regenerate complete colonies
of spermatogenesis was significantly improved compared
with conventional conditions for both pup and adult pri-
mary cultures. These findings suggest that a distinguishing
characteristic of SSCs is priming to thrive in conditions
favoring glycolytic activity, and matching culture condi-
tions to the bioenergetics of the cells is important for main-
taining functional integrity.
RESULTS
Changes in the SSC Content of Primary Cultures of
Undifferentiated Spermatogonia during Long-Term
Maintenance in Conventional Conditions
To determine the impact of long-term in vitro maintenance
on the integrity of SSCs, we first utilized primary cultures of
undifferentiated spermatogonia established from P6–P8
Rosa26-Lacz transgenic pups. The cells were maintained
in conventional conditions that included a chemically
defined serum-free medium supplemented with a free fatty
acid cocktail, GDNF, and FGF2, and co-culture with STO
feeder cells in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 21% O2 (Ku-
bota et al., 2004b). For each culture analyzed, the spermato-
gonial population was collected at 2-month intervals and a
portion (�1 3 105 cells) was transplanted as a single-cell
suspension into the testes of germ cell-depleted recipient
mice (1 3 104 cells transplanted per testis) to assess SSC
content, while the remaining cells were replated for
continued culture (Figure 1A). Based on colonies of LacZ-
stained donor cells in recipient seminiferous tubules, the
mean (±SEM) relative SSC content of cultures at 2, 4, and
6 months (n = 4 or 5 cultures analyzed at each time point)
was calculated to be 202.0 ± 72.6, 192.6 ± 51.0, and 15.4 ±
8.9, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C), demonstrating a
decrease of �13-fold over the culture period. However,
the total number of spermatogonia increased exponen-
tially throughout the 6-month period (Figure 1D). Thus,
a decrease in overall growth of the culture was not
the reason for the declining SSC content. Importantly,
these findings corroborate those of Schmidt et al. (2011),

 content during long-term culture of >5 months in conven-
tional conditions.
Assessment of SSC Regenerative Integrity in Primary
Cultures of Undifferentiated Spermatogonia during
Long-Term In Vitro Maintenance
The regenerative integrity of cultured SSCs can be defined
as a capacity to produce robust colonies of continual sper-
matogenesis in recipient seminiferous tubules following
transplantation. From a human clinical standpoint, sus-
taining this capacity following culture is critical if restora-
tion of fertility is the desired outcome of transplantation.
From the transplantation analyses for assessing changes
in SSC content of long-term cultures presented above, we
observed donor-derived colonies with variable morphol-
ogies at all time points. Some colonies appeared to contain
the entire spermatogenic lineage, as indicated by dense
blue staining, while others were sparsely populated with
germ cells, as indicated by patchy staining in which indi-
vidual cells were distinguishable (Figure 2A). To explore
these observations further, we transplanted cells from
2-month cultures into testes of W/Wv recipients that lack
an endogenous germline, thereby allowing us to unequiv-
ocally assess the degree of regenerated spermatogenesis
arising from cultured and transplanted donor SSCs specif-
ically. Approximately 12 weeks after transplant, which
constitutes greater than two rounds of spermatogenesis,
recipient testes were recovered and processed for histolog-
ical analysis of serial cross-sections through the entire
tissue to define complete and incomplete colonies. As ex-
pected, colonies of complete spermatogenesis were evident
in some seminiferous tubule cross-sections; however, we
also observed many tubules with incomplete spermatogen-
esis (Figure 2B). Further assessment of the incomplete col-
onies revealed that 44.6% ± 3.1% (mean ± SEM) contained
spermatogonia only and 55.4% ± 3.1% contained at least
some meiotic spermatocytes (Figure 2C). Seminiferous tu-
bules containing round spermatids or spermatozoa were
not evident in any of the incomplete colonies examined
(n = 21 cross-sections). Immunofluorescent staining for
the marker TRA98 confirmed that all incomplete colonies
contained germ cells, and staining for the marker LIN28
demonstrated that all contained undifferentiated sper-
matogonia (Figure 2D). Because each colony from trans-
plantation is clonally derived from an individual SSC
(Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2006; Nagano et al., 1999), these
findings demonstrated that all SSCs in primary cultures of
undifferentiated spermatogonia do not possess equivalent
capacity to regenerate the entire spermatogenic lineage.
Also, these findings suggest a multifaceted deficiency
in long-term cultured SSCs that manifests as an arrest at
various steps in the spermatogenic continuum, including
spermatogonial differentiation and meiotic progression.
Next, we sought to determine whether the regenerative
integrity of the SSC population changes during long-
term maintenance in conventional culture conditions. To
address this, we examined the intact LacZ-stained recipient
testes that had been transplanted with cultured cells at 2, 4,
and 6 months and scored the colonies within whole semi-
niferous tubules as complete or incomplete based on dense
blue staining or being sparsely populated with blue-stained

 cells, respectively. The mean percentage of complete col-
onies was �79%, 26%, and 5% at 2, 4, and 6 months
of culture, respectively (Figure 2E). Thus, between 2 and
6 months in culture a loss of �16-fold in the number of
SSCs with the capacity to regenerate the entire spermato-
genic lineage occurred. These findings demonstrate a major
decline in regenerative integrity of the SSC population
during long-term maintenance in conventional culture
conditions, which imposes a major limitation on trans-
lating the current methodologies devised for mice to cul-
ture of human SSCs.
Impact of Culture Conditions Optimized for
Utilization of Glycolysis as the Primary Bioenergetics
Process on SSC Regenerative Integrity during
Long-Term In Vitro Maintenance
To begin addressing the deficiency of conventional condi-
tions for maintaining the regenerative integrity of long-
term cultured SSCs, we mined the transcriptome profile
of the ID4-EGFP+/SSC pool from primary mouse cultures
that was generated in our previous studies (Chan et al.,
2014). This assessment uncovered upregulated expression
of genes coding for the enzymes enolase 1 and 2 (Eno1/2)
in the ID4-EGFP+/SSC population compared with the
ID4-EGFP�/progenitor population. We confirmed upregu-
lated expression of ENO2 in the ID4-EGFP+/SSC pool iso-
lated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from primary
cultures using immunoblot analysis (Figure S1). Because
ENO1/2 play key roles in the penultimate step of glycolysis,
we postulated that the SSC pool in primary cultures is
primed to thrive in conditions that favor glycolysis as
the primary bioenergetics process. To assess this possibility,
we modified culture conditions to provide a GO environ-
ment by removing all sources of lipids and free fatty acids
from culture medium and lowering the O2 tension of the
atmosphere from the standard atmospheric 21% to 10%.
Based on lactate levels, we found that cells maintained
for as little as one week in GO conditions had elevation
of �32% (n = 3 different cultures) in glycolytic activity
compared with cells maintained in conventional condi-
tions (Figure S2). Next, cultures were established in
GO conditions from P6–P8 Rosa26-LacZ transgenic pups
(n = 4) and maintained for a 6-month period. At 2-month
intervals, a portion of the cell population was collected
for transplantation into germ cell-depleted recipients to
measure SSC content and regenerative integrity, and the
remaining cells were replated for continued culture. Out-
comes revealed the mean (±SEM) relative SSC content
of the cultures to be 150.0 ± 47.7, 170.5 ± 47.3, and
29.5 ± 11.2 per 105 cells, respectively (Figures 3A and
3B). Although the SSC content was numerically lower
compared with conventional conditions, the difference
was not statistically significant (p = 0.7). Also, even though

 a decrease in overall SSC content still occurred in GO con-
ditions over the 6-month period (�5-fold), it was appre-
ciably less compared with the major decline (�13-fold) in
conventional conditions (Figure 1C).
Next, we aimed to determine whether GO conditions
affect the regenerative integrity of SSCs during long-term
culture. To address this, we scored spermatogenic colonies
that formed in recipient testes 2 months after transplan-
tation with cells cultured in GO conditions for 2, 4, or
6 months as being complete or incomplete using the
criteria defined above. For 2-month cultured cells (n = 4),
we found that the mean percentage of regenerated colonies
that could be scored as complete was �76%, which was
similar to that for cells cultured in conventional conditions
for 2 months (Figures 3C and 2E). However, in contrast to
the major decline of cells cultured in conventional condi-
tions for 4 months (�26% complete colonies) or 6 months
(�5% complete colonies), the percentage of complete col-
onies produced from cells cultured in GO conditions for
4 or 6 months was 44% and 40%, respectively (Figures 3C
and 2E). Although a decline of �2-fold occurred from 2 to
6 months of maintenance, the number of SSCs in primary
cultures with the capacity to fully regenerate the spermato-
genic lineage in GO conditions was improved by �70%
and �800% at 4 and 6 months of culture, respectively,
compared with conventional conditions. Taken together,
these findings suggest that matching the culture environ-
ment to the primary bioenergetics of SSCs is critical for
preserving regenerative integrity.
Glycolysis-Optimized Conditions Enhance Long-Term
Culture of SSCs from Adult Mice
Although a few previous studies have reported long-term
maintenance of primary cultures of undifferentiated sper-
matogonia from adult mice (Ogawa et al., 2004; Schmidt
et al., 2011; Seandel et al., 2007), the efficiency of establish-
ing them and preservation of SSC regenerative integrity has
not been evaluated. Here, we compared the efficiency of
establishing long-term primary cultures of undifferentiated
spermatogonia from adult mice in conventional or GO
conditions. For these experiments, adult Rosa26-LacZ
donor mice at 3–4 months of age were utilized as donors.
For each, the isolated spermatogonial population was
divided equally in number for maintenance in conven-
tional or GO conditions. A culture was considered success-
fully established when the overall cell number expanded
to the point where it could be split 1:2 with continued
growth. Overall we were able to establish two cultures
out of ten attempts for conventional conditions, but six
out of six attempts were successful with the GO conditions.
In addition, the average time to achieve exponential
expansion for the two successful conventional cultures
was �6 months, whereas GO cultures achieved this
by �2 months of maintenance. Similarly to the pup cul-
tures, lactate levels were measured to be increased (�56%)
in adult cells maintained in GO compared with conven-
tional conditions indicating enhanced glycolytic activity
(Figure S2).
Next, we aimed to assess the maintenance of SSC content
and regenerative integrity in long-term adult cultures.
For GO conditions, the cell populations were collected at
2-month intervals throughout a 12-month period and a
portion (�1 3 105 cells) was transplanted into the testes
of recipient mice to assess SSC content while the remaining
cells were replated for continued culture. Because the time
to reach exponential expansion was delayed for cultures in
conventional conditions, transplantation analyses were
conducted at 6, 8, 10, and 12 months of culture. Outcomes
for the conventional cultures revealed the relative SSC

 content to be 203 (n = 1), 183.2 ± 104.8 (mean ± SEM,
n = 2), 187.5 ± 107.5 (mean ± SEM, n = 2), and 6 (n = 1)
per 105 cells transplanted at 6, 8, 10, and 12 months,
respectively (Figures 4A and 4B). For GO cultures (n = 4),
the mean (±SEM) relative SSC content was 286.0 ± 60.8,
278.2 ± 87.1, 163.8 ± 63.7, 136.6 ± 27.9, 130.0 ± 49.9,
and 108.5 ± 26.5 SSCs per 105 cells transplanted at 2, 4,
6, 8, 10, and 12 months of culture, respectively (Figures
4A and 4B). Although the relative SSC content of the adult
cultures was greater than that in pup cultures for both GO
and conventional conditions, a decline of �2-fold between
2 and 6 months and �3-fold over the full 12-month period
occurred for GO conditions, similarly to pup cultures.
Lastly, we assessed the regenerative integrity of SSCs in
the adult cultures during long-term maintenance by
scoring donor-derived colonies generated in recipient
testes as either complete or incomplete. For conventional
cultures �50% of the colonies were complete at 6 months
(n = 1), dropping to �11% (n = 2) at 8 months, reducing
even further to 2% (n = 2) at 10 months, and by 12 months
0% of colonies contained complete spermatogenesis (Fig-
ure 4C). In contrast, �89%, 69%, 50%, 40%, 8%, and 2%
(n = 4) of colonies were complete at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and
12 months of culture, respectively (Figure 4C). Thus, GO
conditions support an SSC pool in primary cultures of un-
differentiated spermatogonia derived from adult testes for
at least 6 months in which regenerative integrity is pre-
served in �50% of the population.
DISCUSSION
Expansion of SSC numbers in vitro while maintaining the
integrity to regenerate complete colonies of spermatogen-
esis is paramount for application of transplantation meth-
odology as a means to preserve and re-establish the fertility
of male cancer patients. Because the proliferation rate of
SSCs is relatively slow, �6 days (Kubota et al., 2004b), a
period of long-term maintenance in culture is needed to
provide a sufficient number of cells for transplantation if
the intent is to yield enough sperm for a pregnancy to be
achieved. In addition, long-term culture of SSCs provides
a valuable platform to study the mechanisms controlling
their fate decisions. Several studies have reported long-
term maintenance of putative human SSCs (Sadri-Ardekani
et al., 2009, 2011). Although the outcomes were promising,

 unequivocal determination of SSC presence in human
testicular cell cultures is challenging because assessment
is restricted to expression of molecular markers whose
SSC specificity is undefined and the appearance of human
cells in testes of immunodeficient recipient mice after xen-
otransplantation. Although some of the markers used are
expressed by somatic cells, others are expressed by sper-
matogonia but are not SSC specific. Also, xenotransplanta-
tion does not result in regeneration of the spermatogenic
lineage; thus, whether bona fide SSCs were present in the
human cultures has not been truly demonstrated.
In previous attempts to culture human SSCs, conditions
were based on methodology described previously for long-
term culture of primary mouse undifferentiated spermato-
gonial populations in which the presence of stem cells was
demonstrated by transplantation analyses that yielded
complete regeneration of spermatogenesis. In all mouse
conditions described to date, the primary population of
spermatogonia consists of an SSC pool that is small in
number and a more abundant non-SSC population that
is equivalent to transit amplifying progenitors in vivo.
However, conditions for maintenance of the SSC pool
have not been optimized. Importantly, availability of the
robust transplantation assay to assess maintenance of SSC
numbers and their regenerative integrity is a major benefit
for refining conditions, which can yield invaluable infor-
mation for developing human SSC culture methodology.
Two major conventional methodologies for long-term
culture of mouse undifferentiated spermatogonial popula-
tions that contain bona fide SSCs were described over
10 years ago. Studies of Kanatsu-Shinohara et al. (2003)
developed methodology that includes a complex medium
formulation based on the commercial supplement StemPro
and co-culture with MEF feeder cells, which supports long-
term maintenance and growth of a primary undifferenti-
ated germ cell population derived from testes of neonatal
(P0) mice. Although an exciting breakthrough, these cul-
tures were derived from prospermatogonia that are present
at P0, which are precursors to undifferentiated spermato-
gonia. Also, the conditions were developed for mice with
a DBA/2 genetic background in which adult stem cells are
known to possess enhanced capacity for proliferation and
survival compared with other strains of mice (Muller-Sie-
burg and Riblet, 1996). The relevance of these conditions
to actual undifferentiated spermatogonia including SSCs
in either prepubertal pups or adults and other strains of
mice has remained relatively undefined. Subsequently,
Kubota et al. (2004b) developed a method that includes a
defined medium formulation and co-culture with STO
feeder cells that supports long-term maintenance and
growth of a primary undifferentiated spermatogonial pop-
ulation derived from P6–P8 mice of several genetic back-
grounds including DBA/2 and C57BL/6. In contrast to
claims by Kanatsu-Shinohara et al. (2016) that derivation
of cultures is notoriously difficult with mice of a C57BL/6
background, a multitude of studies have utilized the
method of Kubota et al. (2004b) to derive long-term cul-
tures of cells from P6–P8 mice with this genetic background
and utilize them successfully for experimentation of the
SSC pool (Chan et al., 2014; Kaucher et al., 2012; Lovelace
et al., 2016; Oatley et al., 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011; Wu
et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2013c). It is impor-
tant to note that for both of the conventional methods,
only a minor portion of the germ cell population possesses
the capacity to regenerate spermatogenesis following trans-
plantation into recipient testes. Hence, the cultures cannot
be considered pure SSCs or germline stem (GS) cells. In ac-
tuality, the cultures are a primary population of undifferen-
tiated spermatogonia if derived from prepubertal pups and
prospermatogonia if derived from P0 neonates.
A nuance of the conventional conditions has been that
while overall amplification of cell number occurs in the cul-
tures, the percentage of the population possessing regener-
ative capacity (i.e., SSCs) declines over a several-month
period (Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2003, 2005, 2011; Kubota
et al., 2004b; Schmidt et al., 2011), a deficiency that is
amplified when the germ cells are maintained in a feeder-
free format (Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2011). There are
several possible causes of the declining SSC content,
including dilution of the pool by greater proliferation of
the non-stem cell progenitor spermatogonia or impaired
integrity of SSCs to self-renew. At present, experimental
evidence supporting a singular or multifactor deficiency
has not been generated, and further experimentation will
be required to clarify the cause of reduced maintenance
of the SSC pool. Also, the integrity of the colony-producing
population for regenerating complete spermatogenesis at
various points during the culture period has not been
defined. In an effort to enhance growth of the cultures
overall and improve maintenance of the SSC pool, Ka-
natsu-Shinohara et al. (2011) refined the StemPro-based
culture medium to be serum free and lipid enriched. In
those conditions, the growth of cultures overall was
improved and a pool of cells with regenerative capacity per-
sisted for an extended period of time. In follow-up studies,
the same group aimed to improve the serum-free and lipid-
rich condition by changing the commercially available
base medium (Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2014). Outcomes
yielded a condition whereby the percentage of the culture
population that is capable of regenerating spermatogenesis
was maintained at a relatively steady level over a 5-month
period. However, for both of these refined conditions,
assessment of the percentage of the population with prime
stem cell capacity to produce colonies of complete sper-
matogenesis after transplant at various points during the
culture period was not conducted. Also, similar to the
1436
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 8 j 1430–1441 j May 9, 2017
 unrefined conditions, the cultures were derived from
prospermatogonia of P0 neonates with a DBA/2 genetic
background; thus, relevance to the true undifferentiated
spermatogonial population and other strains of mice has
remained undefined.
For many somatic cell lineages, the bioenergetics of stem
cells is unique compared with progenitors and differenti-
ated cells, with most relying on glycolysis (Hsu et al.,
2013; Ito and Suda, 2014; Simsek et al., 2010). If this is
the case for SSCs, modifying conditions to favor glycolysis
could be of benefit for maintaining regenerative integrity
of the pool during long-term culture. Indeed, our previous
studies that examined the transcriptome of the SSC pool in
primary
cultures
of
undifferentiated
spermatogonia
derived from P6–P8 mice with a C57BL/6 genetic back-
ground revealed differential expression of key enzymes
(Eno1/2) that are involved in glycolysis (Chan et al.,
2014). Expanding on this observation, a recent study found
that inhibition of glycolysis in prospermatogonia-derived
cultures derived from DBA/2 mice reduced the number of
cells with regenerative capacity, whereas chemical activa-
tion of glycolysis enhanced stem cell maintenance (Ka-
natsu-Shinohara et al., 2016). Paradoxically, because an
abundance of free fatty acids will promote utilization of
b-oxidation, the findings that modulating glycolytic activ-
ity improves SSC self-renewal contradicts the previous
studies suggesting that a lipid-rich medium enhances SSC
maintenance during long-term culture (Kanatsu-Shino-
hara et al., 2011, 2014). Unfortunately, the SSC content
was not reported at various points during an extended cul-
ture period in the study by Kanatsu-Shinohara et al. (2016),
so the impact of modulating glycolytic activity on long-
term maintenance of the SSC pool is not clear. Interest-
ingly, by adding a chemical activator of glycolysis to culture
medium, Kanatsu-Shinohara et al. (2016) were able to
derive primary cultures from mice with a C57BL/6 genetic
background, a feat they had not been able to achieve using
the StemPro and lipid-rich condition that works efficiently
for cells from DBA/2 mice. Although the percentage of the
cultured populations that possessed regenerative capacity
was reported to be similar between C57BL/6 and DBA/2
cultures when maintained with supplementation of the
glycolysis activator, the length of time that the cells had
been maintained in vitro prior to transplant was not re-
ported. In addition, the percentage of colonies that formed
in recipient testes after transplantation that were complete
spermatogenesis was not assessed. Thus, the effects of
modulating the bioenergetics in primary cultures of undif-
ferentiated spermatogonia on long-term maintenance of
SSC regenerative integrity have remained undefined.
While all of the original and refined conventional con-
ditions appear to support primary germ cell populations
derived from testes of neonatal or prepubertal pups in
which at least some SSCs persist for various periods of
time, the impacts of the conditions on derivation and
long-term maintenance of SSC containing cultures from
adults have not been thoroughly explored. For the method-
ology reported by Kubota et al. (2004b), a single study suc-
ceeded in culturing adult SSCs (Schmidt et al., 2011), but
the efficiency by which the cultures could be established
was not assessed and the relative SSC content was exam-
ined at only a single time point. To our knowledge, only
two other groups have demonstrated success with culture
of adult mouse SSCs. Previous studies by Ogawa et al.
(2004) reported a success rate of 50% for adult DBA/2
mice in deriving cultures of cells with the morphological
appearance of spermatogonia when utilizing the complex
StemPro-based medium reported by Kanatsu-Shinohara
et al. (2003). Unfortunately, as transplantation analyses
were not conducted with the cultures, the actual stem
cell content of the cultures was undefined. Similarly,
studies by Seandel et al. (2007) reported a culture method
using testicular stromal cells as feeders and a variation of
the complex StemPro-based medium originally reported
by Kanatsu-Shinohara et al. (2003) that supports long-
term expansion of a primary population of spermatogonia
isolated from adult testes. Although data were not pro-
vided, the efficiency of establishing cultures from adult
mice with various genetic backgrounds was reported to be
high. Importantly, colonies of spermatogenesis were gener-
ated in recipient testes following transplantation of the
cells, thus demonstrating that a portion of the population
possessed SSC capacity. However, the number of colonies
generated from the adult cultures was not reported, nor
were transplantation analyses conducted at multiple
points throughout the culture period. Therefore, assessing
effectiveness of the culture method for long-term main-
tenance of the SSC pool is not possible at this time.
Consequently, a void exists for robust and reproducible
methodology to establish and maintain long-term primary
cultures of adult SSCs.
For all of the culture conditions that support long-term
maintenance of a primary germ cell population reported
to date, the regenerative integrity of SSCs to re-establish
complete colonies of spermatogenesis has not been thor-
oughly evaluated. It is essential to address this gap in
knowledge if the intent of cultures is to re-establish fertility
following transplantation. In the current study, we discov-
ered that the percentage of SSCs that could regenerate
complete colonies of spermatogenesis declines rapidly in
cultures established from prepubertal pup spermatogonia
and maintained in conventional conditions (Figure 1).
A potential major problem is the accumulation of DNA
damage in cultured SSCs, which could lead to induction
of apoptosis or maturation arrest in descendant germ cells
that arise in colonies following transplantation, thereby
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 8 j 1430–1441 j May 9, 2017
1437
 eliminating the development of complete spermatogen-
esis. In this regard, generation of low levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) during long-term culture would be
critical. Indeed, outcomes of previous studies suggest that
SSC maintenance in vitro is influenced by ROS (Morimoto
et al., 2013, 2015). Although those studies were conducted
with primary cultures derived from prospermatogonia, re-
sults of manipulating ROS levels revealed that a moderate
concentration promotes self-renewal. Thus, modulating
ROS levels in cultures of primary spermatogonia is likely
important for maintenance of SSC regenerative integrity,
and a possible means of achieving this is to maintain cells
in conditions that reduce the utilization of b-oxidation as
the primary bioenergetics process. Our previous finding
that expression of Eno1/2 is upregulated in cells that
make up the SSC pool in primary cultures of pup undiffer-
entiated spermatogonia indicated a priming to thrive in
conditions that favor glycolysis as the primary bioener-
getics process. All of the culture conditions reported in
previous studies have maintained cells in lipid-rich or free
fatty acid-supplemented media and an atmospheric O2
tension of 21%, which likely promotes the utilization of
b-oxidation.
In the current study, we devised simple refinements to the
conventional culture condition of Kubota et al. (2004b)
that promotes utilization of glycolysis, which we have
termed GO (glycolysis-optimized) conditions. To achieve
this, weremoved all supplementation of lipids and free fatty
acids from the medium and reduced the O2 tension to 10%.
In these conditions, we found that the integrity of long-
term cultured SSCs from both pup and adult mice to regen-
erate complete colonies of spermatogenesis was signifi-
cantly improved. Considering that reduced O2 tension is
known to enhance the maintenance of somatic stem cell
populations in vitro (Csete, 2005; Ishikawa and Ito, 1988;
Maeda et al., 1986), it is possible that the reduced O2 level
of the GO condition alone was the major influential factor
in improving SSC regenerative capacity. However, omission
of lipids in addition to the reduced O2 tension did not nega-
tively affect maintenance of the SSC pool during long-term
culture for either pup or adult cells. Thus, we recommend
that both these modifications be employed in future studies
utilizing primary cultures of mouse SSCs and anticipate that
they will serve as the basis for developing culture conditions
for SSCs from higher-order mammals. Indeed, we discov-
ered in a previous study that long-term culture of cattle
undifferentiated spermatogonia is enhanced in an atmo-
sphere of reduced O2 tension (Oatley et al., 2016). In addi-
tion, the findings of the current study highlight the impor-
tance of matching culture conditions to the bioenergetics
of SSCs during long-term in vitro maintenance and provide
the impetus for future studies to further refine the condi-
tions to promote utilization of glycolysis.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All animal procedures were approved by the Washington State
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accor-
dance with Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,
eighth edition. Donor mice for primary cultures of undifferenti-
ated spermatogonia were male Rosa26-LacZ (Jax Mice, strain
002073) hybrids at P6–P8 or adult (3–4 months) ages. Recipients
for transplantation analyses were either adult male W/Wv mu-
tants (Jax Mice, strain 000049) or F1 hybrids of a C57BL/6J (Jax
Mice, strain 000664) 3 129S1/svlmJ (Jax Mice, strain 002448) cross
that were treated with busulfan to eliminate the endogenous
germline, as described previously (Helsel and Oatley, 2017; Oatley
and Brinster, 2006).
Cell Culture
Primary cultures of undifferentiated spermatogonia were estab-
lished from THY1+ cell populations isolated by magnetic activated
cell sorting from testes of pup (P6–P8) or adult (3–4 months)
Rosa26-LacZ hybrid mice as described previously (Kubota et al.,
2004a; Oatley and Brinster, 2006). Cultures were maintained in
either conventional or GO conditions and mitotically inactivated
STO feeders. The conventional condition included chemically
defined serum-free medium (mSFM) supplemented with a growth
factor cocktail of GDNF and FGF2, a mixture of free fatty acids, and
an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 21% O2 as described by Kubota et al.
(2004b). The GO condition was identical except for elimination
of the free fatty acid supplement and reduction of O2 tension to
10%. For all cultures, medium was replaced every 2 days and cells
were subcultured onto fresh feeders every 6–7 days.
Transplantation Analyses
Evaluation of SSC content and their regenerative integrity in
primary undifferentiated spermatogonial cultures at various time
points was conducted using transplantation analysis. In brief,
cultured cell populations were disassociated into single-cell sus-
pensions by digestion with trypsin/EDTA solution, a portion
(1 3 105 cells) was removed and suspended in mSFM at a concen-
tration of 1 3 106 cells/mL, and the remaining cells were replated
for continued culture. For transplantation into busulfan-treated
recipients, �10 mL of cell suspension (�1 3 104 cells) was microin-
jected into the seminiferous tubules of each testis as described
previously (Helsel and Oatley, 2017; Oatley and Brinster, 2006).
For evaluation of incomplete colonies, W/Wv recipients were
transplanted with cells from 2-month cultures suspended at a
concentration of 1 3 107 cells/mL and �5 mL (�1 3 105 cells)
was microinjected per testis. Recipient testes were evaluated
for donor-derived colonies either 2 months (busulfan-treated) or
3 months (W/Wv) after transplantation by staining with b-galacto-
sidase as described previously (Helsel and Oatley, 2017; Oatley and
Brinster, 2006).
Testis Histology and Immunostaining
Testes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in
paraffin, and serial cross-sections of 5–7 mm thickness were made
through the entire tissue and mounted on glass slides. Histological
1438
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 8 j 1430–1441 j May 9, 2017
 analysis was performed by H&E staining after deparaffinization.
For immunostaining analyses, deparaffinized cross-sections were
incubated overnight at 4�C with primary antibodies against
TRA98 (rat monoclonal, Abcam, cat. #ab82527) and LIN28 (goat
polyclonal, R&D Systems, cat. #AF3757), diluted 1:200. After
extensive washing in PBS, sections were incubated with secondary
antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000 for 4 hr at room temperature. All
cross-sections were visualized with an inverted fluorescent micro-
scope and images were captured with a DP72 digital camera using
CellSense software (Olympus).
Lactate Assay
To determine whether different culture conditions altered glyco-
lytic activity in the spermatogonia, we measured lactate concentra-
tion of culture medium. In brief, a standard number of cells was
seeded per culture well and maintained in conventional or GO
conditions for 1 week during which time the culture medium
was replaced at 48-hr intervals. After the last interval, lactate
concentration of the medium was measured using a commercial
ELISA (EnzyChrom Glycolysis Assay, BioAssay Systems, product
#ECGL-100). Because the spermatogonia were co-cultured with
STO feeders, we first assessed whether the different culture condi-
tions affected their glycolytic activity. Outcomes revealed no dif-
ference between conventional and GO conditions (Figure S2),
thus eliminating effects on the feeder as a confounding factor of
the measurements made for the cultured spermatogonia.
Quantification and Statistical Analysis
All quantitative data are presented as the mean ± SEM, and n values
are described in the text of the Results section as well as the figure
legends. Significant differences between means were determined
statistically using the one-way ANOVA function of GraphPad
Prism 6 software.
