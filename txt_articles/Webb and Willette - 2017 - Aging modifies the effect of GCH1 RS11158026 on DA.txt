Abstract
Novel single nucleotide polymorphisms within Parkinson's disease (PD) can predict disease risk, 
but their influence on clinical, cognitive and neurobiological indices remain unexplored. We 
investigated differences between functional polymorphisms at RS11158026 coding for guanosine 
triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 (GCH1), an essential enzyme for dopamine production in 
nigrostriatal cells. Among newly diagnosed, untreated PD subjects and age-matched controls from 
the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, T allele carriers showed higher PD risk (Odds 
Ratio=1.23, P=0.048), earlier age of onset by 5 years (P=0.003), and lower striatal DAT uptake 
(P=0.003). Carriers also had increased CSF α-synuclein (P=0.016), worse motor function 
(P=0.041), anxiety (P=0.038), and executive function (P<0.001). Strikingly, these effects were 
only in younger T carriers (<50 years), where aging quells the effects of these genetic factors. This 
suggests GCH1 variants affect early PD risk through altered dopamine uptake, and aging alters 
how genetic factors contribute to disease development. Future studies should investigate how 
aging modifies genotypes contributions on PD risk and sequelae.

Introduction
Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related disorder resulting from degeneration of 
nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. PD is believed to be due to α-synuclein aggregation 
(Allen Reish and Standaert, 2015), decreasing dopamine production whereby many genetic

 risk factors act individually or in concert to impact disease pathogenesis (Lesage and Brice, 
2009). Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 (GCH1; OMIM 600225), located on 
chromosome 14q22.1-q22.2, encodes the rate-limiting enzyme catalyzing the first step in 
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis. BH4 is a required cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, 
ultimately leading downstream to production of dopamine (Kurian, et al., 2011).
Recently, a large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data 
identified new risk loci for the development of PD(Nalls, et al., 2014), including a novel 
variant at RS11158026, hereafter RS026, for GCH1. No studies have investigated how 
RS026 variants affect clinical characteristics in PD in populations of European descent. 
Furthermore, it is unknown how the RS026 T or C alleles may impact neural, cognitive, or 
biomarker sequelae relevant to PD or dopamine transport uptake, such as α-
synuclein(Goedert, 2001), tau species(Kang, et al., 2016), as well as metabolic factors like 
cholesterol that may affect dopamine uptake(Jones, et al., 2012).
This study explored relationships between markers of PD with a GCH1 mutation, to 
determine if mutation carriers of European origin are at increased risk of developing PD. We 
describe the clinical, neuropsychological, volumetric imaging and dopaminergic imaging 
findings of GCH1 variants in a cross-sectional cohort of newly diagnosed, untreated 
individuals with PD and healthy, age-matched controls. We also wished to explore how 
RS026 impacted processes among young and older subjects, as aging is the greatest PD risk 
factor (Rodriguez, et al., 2015) and may impact the effect of RS026.
Methods
Setting
The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is described at www.ppmi-info.org. 
PPMI is a public–private partnership funded by the Michael J Fox Foundation for 
Parkinson's Research and funding partners listed at www.ppmi-info.org/fundingpartners. 
PPMI is an observational, multicenter longitudinal case-control study designed to identify 
PD biomarkers (The Lancet, 2010).
Participants
PPMI data was obtained from 289 de novo PD and 233 aged healthy controls, including: 1) 
demographic data 2) genetic data; 3) serum and CSF biomarkers; 4) structural Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans; 5) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 
scores and neuropsychological performance; and 6) Single Photo Emission Computed 
Tomography (SPECT) dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT) scans. Participants were 
clinically diagnosed at every visit based on standardized criteria (Emre, et al., 2007). All 
subjects enrolled in the PPMI study diagnosed with PD had received a diagnosis of PD for 
two years or less and were not taking PD medication while enrolled in the study. Data were 
downloaded on May 15th, 2016. Participants with genotype data available at baseline were 
categorized as carriers of only the major allele (C/C; n=237) versus participants who had at 
least one minor T allele (C/T or T/T; n=185), based on previous reports showing evidence 
for autosomal dominance inheritance (Hwu, et al., 2000).

 Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consent
The PPMI study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01141023). All PPMI sites 
received approval from an ethics committee on human experimentation before study 
initiation. Written informed consent for research was obtained from all individuals 
participating in the study.
Genotyping and SNP Selection
All PPMI samples were genotyped using the Illumina Immunochip and NeuroX. Before 
association analyses. All samples and genotypes underwent stringent quality controls (QC). 
The NeuroX array underwent the same QC steps as the Immunochip but removed variants 
based on the Minor Allele Frequency (MAF)11. For SNP selection, we extracted GCH1 
RS026 genotype data (C/C, C/T, T/T).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Acquisition and Pre-Processing
T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired from September 2013 to January 2014. Acquisition 
parameters are detailed in the data set (http://www.ppmi-info.org/wpcontent/uploads/
2015/03/PPMI-MRI-Operations-Manual-V7-0-20JAN2015-FINAL.pdf). As described 
(Willette, et al., 2013), baseline T1-weighted images were preprocessed using the SPM12 
“New Segmentation” tool to extract modulated gray matter (GM) volume maps, followed by 
smoothing maps with a 8mm Gaussian kernel. GM images were subsequently used in voxel-
wise analyses.
CSF collection and biomarker measurement
CSF and serum sample collection and processing are described in the PPMI protocol manual 
(http://www.ppmi-info.org/). Baseline CSF samples were obtained after an overnight fast.
DAT Scan
123I-ioflupane SPECT DAT scans were acquired from September 2013 to January 2014. 
The regional 123I-Ioflupane binding values for bilateral putamen and bilateral caudate 
regions were derived for PD patients and controls.
Clinical, Cognitive and Neuropsychological Assessments
All clinical assessments were conducted at the PPMI screening visit. As described(The 
Lancet, 2011), various motor, neuropsychological, and cognitive tests were performed, 
including the: Movement Disorders Society-UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS) to measure both non-
motor and motor activities of daily living (Goetz, et al., 2007); the Symbol Digit Modalities 
Test (SDMT)(Sheridan, et al., 2006) to gauge attention, visual scanning, and motor speed; 
and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)(CD, 1983) to measure emotional state anxiety, 
which is a common PD phenotype (Richard, et al., 1996).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using SPSS 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) or SPM12 (http://
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/). We assessed the frequencies of the alleles 
among individuals with PD compared to controls using χ2 and calculated odds ratios with

 logistic regression models. For all other non-voxelwise analyses, linear mixed effects models 
tested the association between RS026 genotype, baseline diagnosis, and their interaction on 
outcomes of interest. In separate exploratory analyses, we also examined how age modified 
these associations using genotype x age interactions. To restrict type 1 error, the main effect 
and interaction were tested in a single model. Covariates included age at baseline, sex, body 
mass index (BMI), and education. Outcomes included PD risk and age of diagnosis; bilateral 
DAT uptake in caudate and putamen; MDS-UPDRS scores; neuropsychological 
performance; CSF biomarkers including α-synuclein, Aβ1-42, t-tau and p-tau181; and 
metabolic factors including LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol, which exert roles in DAT 
uptake (Jones, et al., 2012). All indices included in these analyses were tested for the 
statistical differences between genotypes. A two-tailed t-test was performed between the 
data from the groups. Alpha was set at .05 for all tests.
To correct for type 1 error in non-voxelwise analyses, as described previously (Willette, et 
al., 2015b), Holm-Bonferroni correction (Holland and Copenhaver, 1987) was used for each 
set of analyses. This closed test procedure maintains a family-wise Alpha = 0.05 by 
requiring unadjusted P values of 0.05 divided by x, x being the number of null hypotheses 
tested. For 4 cognitive tests, for example, P values of .0125, .025, .0375, and .050 are 
successively needed among any test to proceed with testing in the closed set. For sets that 
were in part or completely not robust to Holm-Bonferroni correction, a less strict form of 
correction was used. Specifically, omnibus testing using MANCOVA (Wilkinson, 1975) 
incorporating all dependent variables of the set was conducted, where genotype main effect 
or Genotype by diagnosis interaction significance allowed further testing of all outcomes as 
follow-up tests. Follow up included Age, Sex, Education and BMI as covariates. Follow up 
analyses included a covariate to capture the time of disease progression for each subjects 
before they were examined at the baseline/screening visit which are presented in 
Supplemental Table 2. A Family-wise Alpha of .05 is maintained using such an approach 
(Wilkinson, 1975).
For voxel-wise analysis, 2nd-level mixed models tested main effects and the interaction of 
RS026 genotype and PD diagnosis on regional GM volume, controlling for age, sex, BMI, 
and education. The voxel and cluster thresholds were set at P < .005 (uncorrected) and P < .
05 (corrected). Results were considered significant at the cluster level. We minimized type 1 
error by first using a GM threshold of 0.2 to ensure that voxels with <20% likelihood of 
being GM were not analyzed. Next, Monte Carlo simulations in AlphaSim (http://
afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/doc/manual/alphasim) were used to estimate that 352 contiguous 
voxels were needed for such a cluster to occur at P < 0.05. Previous reports have similarly 
examined voxel-wise associations with metabolic factors and regional GM atrophy (Willette, 
et al., 2015a).
Results
Data Summary
Clinical, demographic, and CSF data are presented in Table 1. There were no differences 
between genotypes in BMI, years of education, age at baseline or the percentage of 
individuals diagnosed with PD. The two subjects with the youngest age of PD diagnosis (16

 & 24) both were carriers for a T allele. We did not observe any significant difference in 
genotype distribution between PD patients and controls even after stratifying by early PD 
onset (<50 years) versus late PD (>50) (Schrag and Schott, 2006). As expected, there were 
significant differences between genotypes in baseline MDS-UPDRS scores. Genotype 
distributions are in Figure 1C.
Age of Onset and Risk for PD
Having at least one risk T allele was associated with earlier age of PD diagnosis (P=0.003). 
Specifically, the mean age at PD onset of individuals with 1 or more T alleles was 47.2 ± 3.4 
years, while C allele homozygotes had a mean age of onset at 52.1 ± 1.7 years (Figure 1 A). 
Allelic frequencies did not differ among PD patients and controls. However, regression 
models showed that individuals with a T allele were at a 23% increased risk of developing 
PD (Wald=4.224, P=0.048).
Dopamine imaging
In the 325 subjects with DAT imaging, those with at least 1 T allele showed significantly 
lower (F=11.27, P < 0.001) dopamine uptake in both bilateral caudate and putamen 
compared to the CC genotype. Figure 2 illustrates a gene-dose association (CC, CT, TT) 
corresponding to less striatal dopamine uptake in bilateral putamen (F=9.325, P=0.002) and 
caudate (F=13.239, P<0.001). Correlation analyses revealed significant correlations between 
dopamine uptake and UPDRS I (R= -0.38, P<0.001) and UPDRS II (R= -0.63 P<0.001) 
scores (Supplementary Figure 1).
CSF Biomarkers
We next examined the effect of GCH1 genotype in 334 subjects with CSF data on α-
synuclein and tau species. For α-synuclein, patients with the T/C or T/T genotype had 
significantly higher CSF concentrations (P=0.016) than patients homozygous for the 
common C genotype. Median CSF α-synuclein levels in CC genotypes were 80% compared 
with patients having two T risk alleles. Furthermore, there was a striking gene-dose (CC, 
CT, TT) increase in CSF α-synuclein in controls (Figure 3A –1898 ± 520) and PD (Figure 
3B - 2016 ± 791). This result was unexpected, given the gene-dose effect on lower striatal 
DAT uptake and that α-synuclein degrades nigrostriatal cells (Goedert, 2001).
We likewise assessed the relationship between RS026 genotype with tau protein 
concentrations. While genotype main effects were non-significant, a genotype by PD 
diagnosis interaction (F=5.312, P=0.029) showed that controls carrying T alleles had higher 
total tau (P=0.034) and phosphorylated tau (P=0.019), whereas individuals with PD did not 
demonstrate any difference between risk allele status and tau species (Figure 3 C & D).
Neuropsychological and UPDRS scores
Among neuropsychological indices (Figure 5), a main effect for the multivariate omnibus 
[F=8.697, P=0.001] with follow-up tests showed that T carriers performed significantly 
worse on: the SDM (P<0.001), LNS (P=0.003), and both STAI (P=0.038) and the MDS-
UPDRS I anxiety sub-score (P=0.042), which assess processing speed, verbal and visuo-
spatial working memory, and anxiety. A similar omnibus main effect [F=5.25, P= 0.002] was

 found for UPDRS I and II. For motor (P=0.046) and non-motor (P=0.04) activities of daily 
living, as assessed by the MDS-UPDRS II, RS026 T allele genotype was related to worse 
motor function (P=0.046, Supplemental Figure 1). Supplemental analyses including disease 
duration as a covariate strengthen these results, revealing that carries perform worse on 
UPDRS III when accounting for this difference in time with disease which is presented in 
Supplemental Figure 2.
Metabolic Biomarkers
In 278 subjects, based on a main effect for the multivariate omnibus test [F=4.43, P=0.005], 
minor allele carriers had higher total serum cholesterol (P=0.042) and LDL cholesterol 
(P=0.029) (Supplementary Figure 2). Total cholesterol levels correlated with striatal 
dopamine uptake (p=0.022) but mediation analyses revealed that total cholesterol only 
mediated the genotype effects on DAT in PD subjects but not controls.
Regional grey matter volume
Finally, voxel-based morphometry was used to regress RS026 genotype against regional GM 
at baseline in all subjects. There was no significant RS026 genotype main effect or 
interaction with diagnosis on regional GM volume. Restriction to striatum with a very liberal 
voxel threshold (p < .05) also yielded no significant clusters.
Aging Interactions with RS026 Genotype
Across all subjects, models testing Age by GCH1 genotype interaction effects on each of the 
main outcomes demonstrated differences among risk allele carriers according to their age. A 
genotype by age interaction (P=0.041, F= 2.783) indicated differences among Age of Onset 
based on age. Splitting the cohort to compare subjects under 50 (N=156) to subjects above 
age 50 (n=266) indicated that individuals younger than 50 drove effects on PD risk and Age 
of Onset. Specifically, regression models showed that T allele carries under 50 were at a 
46% increased risk of developing PD (Wald=5.134, P=0.002) but those over the age of 50 
were not at an increased risk (P=0.83). Carriers of a T allele under 50 showed a mean age of 
onset at 33.8 ± 5.97 years, and non-carriers had a mean age of onset at 45.78 ± 4.37 years 
(Figure 1 B).
An exploratory analysis to view gene-dose effects, showed carriers of two risk alleles (N=6) 
were compared to those with 1 risk allele (n=56) and non-carriers (n=54). Carriers of two 
risk alleles showed marked decreases in age of onset compared to the other two groups at 
28.9 ± 6.38 years. We warrant caution regarding the allele-dose effect, due to sample size. 
An age by GCH1 interaction (P=0.004, F =7.83) indicated differences among T allele 
carriers according to their age on DAT scans. Figure 4 A indicates across all subjects that 
carriers of a risk allele initially have lower dopamine uptake than non-carriers, and Figure 4 
B indicates difference became more significant for subjects under 50 years old. Another age 
by GCH1 interaction (F=5.332, P=0. 0.011) indicated differences among T allele carriers 
according to their age on UPDRS I scores. The same effects were noted for UPDRS II 
(F=2.973, P=0. 0.047) and UPDRS Total scores (F=3.111, P=0. 0.0.43).

 Splitting the cohort to compare subjects under 50 (N=116) to subjects above age 50 (n=306) 
again indicated the interaction effects were driven by individuals younger than 50. Carriers 
under 50 showed increased UPDRS I scores (P=0.002, F = 13.68), UPDRS II (P<0.001, 
F=15.43) & UPDRS Total scores, (P<0.001, F= 14.98). In those above 50 years of age, no 
significant associations were found for UPDRS total score, while UPDRS I and II were still 
significant (p=0.049, F=1.167).
Age by GCH1 genotype interaction effects on regional grey matter volume showed 
decreases in grey matter in three small clusters in the left and right postcentral sulcus and 
right temporal middle (Supplemental Table 1). Cholesterol showed a significant age by 
GCH1 genotype interaction (P=0.035, F=3.075), whereby splitting the cohort showed again 
younger carriers had higher total cholesterol (P=0.024, F= 3.678) compared to non-carriers. 
Carriers above 50 also had significantly higher cholesterol than non-carriers (F=2.173, 
P=0.046). Neuropsychological factors and CSF Biomarkers were similarly tested and did not 
show any significant interaction effects. Follow up analyses including an additional covariate 
to take into account the time subjects were diagnosed with PD before enrolling are presented 
in Supplemental table 2.
Discussion
Several studies examining dopamine dysregulation in PD and DRD (Lewthwaite, et al., 
2015, Mencacci, et al., 2014) suggest GCH1 deficiency may contribute to the pathologic 
features of PD through dopamine deficiency. This is the first study to assess whether GCH1 
variants explained PD age of onset, striatal DAT uptake, and both clinical and cognitive 
markers of PD. Our main findings include a gene-dose response of the minor allele 
contributing to an earlier age of onset, markedly lower DAT uptake, and worse motor 
performance and increased α-synuclein. This is also the first study examining the effects of 
RS026 in subjects of European descent, which comprise the majority of Americans who 
develop PD.
RS026 T allele carriers developed PD 5 years earlier, in concert with the T allele predicting 
a 23% increased risk of developing PD where these results were stronger in younger 
subjects.
Here, the minor allele carriers had robustly lower DAT uptake in both caudate and putamen, 
similar to other studies comparing dopaminergic findings at other SNPs in GCH1 variants 
(Furukawa, et al., 1998, Takahashi, et al., 1994). While the exact mechanism is still 
unknown, our data show that GCH1 variants alter several biological indices which may 
increase the vulnerability of the neurons to ageing, resulting in lower striatal dopamine 
levels in GCH1 mutation carriers and establishing a lower threshold of nigral cell loss to 
induce clinical symptoms. Recent evidence with in vitro studies show α-synuclein regulates 
DAT function, specifically controlling the rapid shuttling of the transporter to and from the 
cell membrane and its availability to take up dopamine (Fountaine and Wade-Martins, 2007). 
This SNP appears to exert a functional influence on dopamine uptake in striatum, which 
may be explained by the striatum's dense population of dopamine receptors (Gerfen, et al., 
1995). In concert with cognitive deficits seen in minor allele carriers, changes in dopamine

 signaling may affect cognitive function in PD due to dopamine regulating cognitive 
functions in prefrontal cortex (PFC)(Alexander, et al., 1986),(Nieoullon, 2002). Similar 
signaling dysfunction of dopamine may also explain greater anxiousness and mood 
perturbations (Hosenbocus and Chahal, 2012).
Unexpectedly, subjects with one or more copies of the T risk allele showed higher CSF α-
synuclein concentrations, which could point to increased α-synuclein in the CSF of patients 
with PD (Hansson, et al. 2014). Since α-synuclein plays a role in the regulation of dopamine 
biosynthesis (Perez, et al., 2002), it may also induce selective damage in dopamine neurons 
of PD patients (Lee, et al., 2011). The lack of differences in regional gray matter between 
GCH1 genotypes, even after very liberal thresholding, points to a possible alternative 
mechanism whereby reactive oxygen species (ROS) potentiate dopaminergic neuronal loss 
in the PD brain, which results from disrupted oxidation homeostasis impacting dopamine 
metabolism (Jenner and Olanow, 2006).
C/T and T/T carriers had worse motor speed and output, as well as well worse performance 
on tests of visuo-spatial working memory, set-shifting, attention and tracking, and cognitive 
flexibility. Other studies administering BH4 showed subjects had improved working 
memory in individuals with PKU (Christ, et al., 2013), where our study provides evidence 
that a decrease in metabolic BH4 through less GCH1 activity could also lead to a decrease in 
working memory. Tanaka et al. noted that individuals who received BH4 supplementation 
earlier in life performed better on executive function tasks than individuals who received 
treatment later in life, pointing to BH4's role in executive function (Tanaka, et al., 2007). As 
minor allele carriers also have lower dopamine uptake, these results are in line with other 
studies showing how dopamine impacts cognition and executive function (Zhang, et al., 
2015).
GCH1 variants in PD patients showed increased cholesterol in a striking allele-dependent 
manner from CC, CT and TT genotypes, pointing to possible vascular differences between 
genotypes. Antoniades et al. examined how low levels of circulating plasma BH4 disrupted 
systemic oxidative homeostasis through increased oxidation of LDL particles (Antoniades, 
et al., 2008) and higher concentrations of superoxide in the vasculature. These values were 
still well within the normal ranges but could affect the maintenance of redox potential in the 
neurochemical environment. The interrelationship between these various mechanisms and 
neurodegeneration in PD could be interpreted as a feed-forward scenario where primary 
insults lead to increased oxidative stress, which damages key cellular pathogenic proteins 
and disrupts lipid membranes that in turn cause more ROS production.
The noteworthy interaction of these effects with age provides evidence supporting the role 
for GCH1 as a risk factor for PD, specifically early onset PD. Importantly, that these 
decreases in the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme system in patients with PD could be due to 
GCH1 deficiency, predisposing people to degeneration and cell death in the substantia nigra 
(Parker Jr, et al., 2008). While the mechanism is uncertain, biochemical evidence of GCH1 
deficiency and reduced dopamine production has been reported in asymptomatic carriers of 
GCH1 mutations (Furukawa, et al., 1998, Takahashi, et al., 1994). We speculate that GCH1 
deficiency and the consequent dopamine deficiency could directly facilitate nigral cell death,

 whereby normal levels of BH4 and dopamine may exert a protective role on the survival of 
nigral neurons. It is also possible that the reduced striatal basal dopamine levels found in 
GCH1 mutation carriers may lower the threshold of nigral cell loss before parkinsonian 
symptoms are exhibited or even increase nigral cell vulnerability to environmental and other 
genetic factors, favoring degeneration over time.
Limitations of our study should be noted. The study sample size was modest, and the 
research was designed to evaluate differences among genotypes which would benefit from a 
larger sample. Since this is a cross-sectional study using baseline data from the initial 342 
subjects from the PPMI study cohort, this limited our ability to determine the relationships 
between these genotypes on longitudinal CSF biomarkers and disease progression. One 
limitation of this dataset is the variation in time subjects have been diagnosed with PD 
before enrolling in the study, which was accounted for in supplemental analyses. 
Additionally, another limitation is our study did not evaluate other genetic factors which 
have yet to be identified, or histological samples from these patients. However, these 
limitations will be resolved in future PPMI analyses These results provide evidence for 
GCH1's role in early onset PD development, especially when considering the clinical 
applicability of determining who may be at risk for developing PD, but may have limited 
applicability to older Caucasian PD cases. Lastly, we cannot exclude that other yet 
unrecognized cellular pathways, not related to dopamine synthesis, may be disrupted by 
GCH1 and BH4 deficiency influencing PD progression.
Conclusion
This is the first study to demonstrate a significant association of GCH1 RS026 with factors 
of PD in a European population, whose results would contribute significantly to the future 
meta-analyses evaluating PD development utilizing genetic loci. Overall, this PPMI data 
suggests that GHC1 functional variants represent rare variant risk factors for clinical PD that 
whose effects are significantly affected by aging. Given GCH1's reported function in BH4 
and dopamine synthesis, it is likely for GCH1 variants to play a role in dopamine uptake and 
motor output while also affecting cognitive function and affect like anxiousness. These 
genetic variants could lead to changes in systemic oxidation, potentially harming 
downstream regulators of PD development. This article suggests that RS11158026 affects 
early PD risk through altered dopamine uptake but aging abates these effects. Future studies 
should screen for GCH1 variants in subjects with familial PD, and in younger subjects with 
parkinsonism features. Future post-mortem histological data on affected individuals, 
particularly those with the PD phenotype, may shed more light on the mechanisms by which 
GCH1 carriers develop PD.

 Highlights
•
Age alters the impact of GCH1 mutation carriers on clinical 
Parkinsonian features.
•
Carriers show increased risk, earlier age of onset and lower striatal 
DAT uptake.
•
Carriers showed worse anxiety, executive function and motor function.
•
Carriers <50 years old had increased risk where those >50 had no 
increased risk.
•
Mutations in GCH1 may contribute to multiple pathologic features of 
PD
