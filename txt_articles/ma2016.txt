Gradual reduction of sugar in soft drinks without 
substitution as a strategy to reduce overweight, obesity, and 
type 2 diabetes: a modelling study
Yuan Ma, Feng J He, Yunjian Yin, Kawther M Hashem, Graham A MacGregor
Summary
Background Sugar-sweetened beverages are a major source of free sugar intake in both children and adults, and are 
an important contributor to obesity and obesity-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes. We proposed an 
incremental and stepwise reduction in free sugars added to sugar-sweetened beverages by 40% over 5 years without 
the use of artifi
 cial sweeteners and assessed the eff
 ect of the proposed strategy on energy intake and weight status.
Methods In this modelling study, we used nationally representative data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey 
rolling programme (NDNS RP) from 2008–12 and British Soft Drinks Association annual reports to calculate sugar-
sweetened beverage consumption (both with and without fruit juices) and its contribution to free sugar and energy 
intake in the UK population. We then estimated the predicted reduction in energy intake resulting from the proposed 
strategy at an individual level. We further predicted the reduction in steady-state bodyweight for each adult using a 
weight loss model. By scaling up the distribution of the predicted bodyweight in the NDNS RP to the UK adult 
population, we estimated reductions in the number of overweight and obese adults, and the number of adults with 
type 2 diabetes.
Findings A 40% reduction in free sugars added to sugar-sweetened beverages over 5 years would lead to an average 
reduction in energy intake of 38·4 kcal per day (95% CI 36·3–40·7) by the end of the fi
 fth year. This would lead to an 
average reduction in steady-state bodyweight of 1·20 kg (1·12–1·28) in adults, resulting in a reduction in the 
prevalence in adults of overweight by 1·0 percentage point (from 35·5% to 34·5%) and obesity by 2·1 percentage 
points (from 27·8% to 25·7%). This reduction would lead to a reduction of roughly 0·5 million adults from being 
overweight and 1 million adults from being obese, which in turn would prevent about 274 000–309 000 incident cases 
of obesity-related type 2 diabetes over the two decades after the predicted reduction in bodyweight is achieved. If fruit 
juices were excluded from the category of sugar-sweetened beverages (because of potential challenges for 
reformulation), the corresponding reductions in energy intake and steady-state bodyweight would be 31·0 kcal per 
day (95% CI 28·6–33·7) and 0·96 kg (0·88–1·04), respectively. These reductions would result in a 0·7 percentage 
point (0·3 million) reduction in overweight and a 1·7 percentage point (0·8 million) reduction in obesity, which 
would in turn prevent about 221 000–250 000 cases of type 2 diabetes over two decades after the predicted reduction in 
bodyweight is achieved. The predicted eff
 ect was greater in adolescents, young adults, and individuals from low-
income families (who consume more sugar-sweetened beverages).
Interpretation An incremental reduction in free sugars added to sugar-sweetened beverages without the use of 
artifi
 cial sweeteners is predicted to reduce the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The proposed 
strategy should be implemented immediately, and could be used in combination with other approaches, such as 
taxation policies, to produce a more powerful eff
 ect.

Introduction
Over the past two decades, obesity has increased 
substantially worldwide1 and is estimated to be associated 
with more than 3 million deaths per year.1 In the UK, 
roughly two in three adults and more than one in 
four children were overweight or obese in 2013.2 
Meanwhile, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages 
has also risen worldwide,3,4 and it is the largest source of 
added sugar (roughly 30% of all added sugar) for children 
and the second largest in adults in the UK.5 Sugar-sweetened 
beverages provide so-called empty calories, with less 
feeling of fullness or satiety compared with solid food.6 
Clear evidence now exists that consumption of 
sugar-sweetened beverages is an important contributor to 
obesity in both children and adults7,8 and is also linked to 
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.9 Roughly 184 000 deaths 
a year worldwide are estimated to be attributable to the 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages.10
The UK developed and implemented a successful 
national salt reduction programme by getting the food 
industry to gradually reduce the amount of salt added to 
processed food over the past decade. The programme was 
pioneered by the Food Standards Agency, with input from 
Consensus Action on Salt and Health, and is now being

implemented by many other countries.11 The key to the 
success of the programme was setting incremental salt 
reduction targets for more than 80 food categories with a 
clear timeframe for the food industry to achieve this. 
Average and maximum targets to be achieved in 4 years 
were set, and the targets were reset 2 years after the 
setting of the initial targets; the intention was to continue 
to reset these targets until maximum adult salt intake met 
the target of 6 g per day. As a result of this programme, 
salt intake fell from 9·5 g per day to 8·1 g per day between 
2003 and 2011, accompanied by a substantial fall in 
population blood pressure and a substantial reduction in 
mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease.12
The UK Scientifi
 c Advisory Committee on Nutrition 
(SACN) has recently recommended reducing free sugar 
intake to no more than 5% of daily energy intake.13 
Meanwhile, Action on Sugar, a non-governmental 
organisation similar to Consensus Action on Salt and 
Health, has produced an action plan to reduce free 
sugars added to food by 40% by 2020.14 Sugar-sweetened 
beverages are a major source of free sugars and should 
be targeted immediately. The removal of free sugars 
from sugar-sweetened beverages does not aff
 ect the 
volume and should be easier to achieve than the removal 
of free sugars from solid foods. Application of this 
approach to solid food would aff
 ect its mass and 
therefore mass substitutes such as insoluble fi
 bre would 
be needed to maintain the same weight. In this study, we 
propose a strategy in which free sugars added to 
sugar-sweetened beverages are reduced gradually by 
40% over 5 years without the use of artifi
 cial sweeteners, 
and assess the eff
 ect of this strategy on population 
energy intake and overweight and obesity.
Methods
Strategy overview and defi
 nitions
In this modelling study, we proposed a gradual reduction 
of 9·7% per year in the amount of free sugars added to 
sugar-sweetened beverages, aiming for a 40% reduction 
over 5 years (fi
 gure 1). To ensure that the strategy works 
eff
 ectively, several key components are emphasised, 
including setting targets to provide a level playing fi
 eld 
for industry and an independent agency with strong 
leadership to take action and monitor the process. Our 
strategy also includes a recommendation for a parallel 
reduction in artifi
 cial sweeteners added to soft drinks, 
and our proposal specifi
 es not using artifi
 cial sweeteners 
to replace the free sugars removed.
We used the term “free sugars” proposed by WHO15 and 
SACN16 in 2015, which includes all monosaccharides and 
disaccharides added to soft drinks, plus sugars naturally 
present in honey, syrups, and unsweetened fruit juices. 
The value of free sugars is very similar to the value of 
“non-milk extrinsic sugars”, a term commonly used in 
the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (our data 
source). Sugar-sweetened beverages were defi
 ned as 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar for scientifi
 c 
literature published up to Oct 1, 2015, with no language 
restrictions, using the following terms: (“ 
carbonated beverages” 
OR “SSB” OR “sugar sweetened beverages” OR “soft drinks” OR 
“sweet drinks” OR “soda” OR “sugary drinks” OR “fruit drinks” OR 
“sport drinks” OR “cold drinks” OR “non-alcoholic drinks”) AND 
(reduc* OR limit* OR decrea*) AND (“energy” OR “weight” OR 
“calorie” OR obes*) AND (“strategy” OR “intervention” OR “policy” 
OR “way” OR “approach”). Among these terms, “carbonated 
beverages” was used as a MeSH term in PubMed. We screened the 
retrieved results for research articles, reviews, commentaries, and 
reports of public health strategies related to sugar-sweetened 
beverages. Based on existing evidence, several countries have 
worked to develop and implement strategies that focus on 
reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages 
through increasing marketing price, limiting its availability, and 
raising public awareness. These strategies included tax policies, 
public education through media and school, restricting the 
portion size and availability of sugar-sweetened beverages, and 
clear labelling. A meta-analysis of all quantitative studies showed 
that a 10% increase in the price of sugar-sweetened beverages 
would lead to reduction of about 13% in sugar-sweetened 
beverage demand, based on the experience of several countries 
including France, several US states, and Mexico. Other studies 
have modelled the risks and benefi
 ts of substituting sugars added 
to sugar-sweetened beverages with non-caloric sweeteners. 
However, we did not identify any studies in which a strategy to 
gradually reduce sugars added to sugar-sweetened beverages was 
proposed and systematically assessed with respect to its eff
 ect on 
weight status.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, our study is the fi
 rst to propose and assess an 
innovative strategy for the gradual and stepwise reduction of free 
sugars added to sugar-sweetened beverages. Our fi
 ndings suggest 
that this approach could potentially lead to an eff
 ective and 
sustainable reduction in population energy intake and 
bodyweight, which would in turn reduce the prevalence of obesity 
and obesity-related diseases nationwide and lead to cost savings. 
The previous success of a similar strategy to reduce salt intake 
suggests that this approach should be both feasible and eff
 ective.
Implications of all the available evidence
A systematic and gradual reduction in free sugars added to 
sugar-sweetened beverages by 40% over 5 years is a feasible 
and potentially important public health strategy, which could 
be implemented immediately. The proposed strategy could be 
used in combination with other approaches for the reduction of 
sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, such as tax policies, to 
produce a more powerful eff
 ect.

sugar-sweetened carbonated drinks, still and juice drinks, 
dilutable drinks, and fruit juices; sugar-sweetened energy 
drinks were categorised as carbonates or still drinks. 
Overweight was defi
 ned as a BMI of 25 or greater and 
obesity was defi
 ned as a BMI of 30 or greater in adults.17
Our proposed strategy included a reduction of free 
sugars in 100% fruit juices because they are important 
contributors to free sugar intake and should be targeted to 
meet the SACN’s target of reducing free sugar to no more 
than 5% of daily energy intake.13 However, we acknowledge 
the potentially limited scope for the reformulation of fruit 
juices because of technical diffi
  culties. We therefore did a 
separate analysis in which we excluded fruit juices from 
the category of sugar-sweetened beverages.
Data sources and modelling
To assess the proposed strategy, we analysed the historical 
trend and current status of sugar-sweetened beverage 
consumption and weight status in the UK population. 
We then calculated the predicted reduction in energy 
intake if the proposed strategy is implemented, modelled 
its eff
 ect on bodyweight, and thereby estimated the 
reduction in the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and 
diabetes.
To study the historical trend in the consumption of 
sugar-sweetened beverages in the UK, we used the UK 
soft drink sales data from 2005 to 2013 from the British 
Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) annual reports,18 which 
were obtained by Zenith International, a food and drink 
consultancy, from more than 100 soft drink producers. 
We assumed that the proportion of soft drinks that were 
sugar-sweetened beverages remained stable between 
2005 and 2010 and was the same for 2011–13 (39%). We 
estimated the trend in consumption of sugar-sweetened 
beverages both with and without 100% fruit juices. Data 
for the historical trend in bodyweight status for adults 
were obtained from the Health Survey for England, 
which are survey series done annually in a random 
sample of the English population to monitor trends in 
population health status, and we assumed that this was a 
representative sample of the UK general population.2
To estimate current sugar-sweetened beverage con-
sumption, we also used data for annual soft drink sales 
between 2008 and 2012 reported in the UK Soft Drinks 
Annual Report18 in combination with the data from 
National Diet and Nutrition Survey rolling programme 
(NDNS RP) from 2008 to 2012. We obtained the NDNS 
data from the UK Data Service.5 The NDNS RP was 
originally designed to quantitatively assess the dietary 
and nutritional status of the general population aged 
1·5 years or older living in private households in the UK. 
Additionally, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages 
was assessed by a 4 day diary; participants were asked to 
keep a record of everything they ate and drank during 
these 4 days. Individuals were also asked to provide 
demographic and health-related information and have 
height and weight measured by nurses. In total, 
4156 individuals (48% children, 47% men) participated in 
the survey. The methods of the survey are detailed 
elsewhere.19
The average daily sugar-sweetened beverage con-
sumption in the UK was estimated from sales data 
using the following formula:
In this formula, sugar-sweetened beverage waste 
(roughly 7% for general soft drink waste and 11% for fruit 
juices waste) was taken from the survey of Household 
Food and Drink Waste in the UK 2012,20 wherein data for 
total soft drink waste was obtained from nationally 
representative UK households, including waste collected 
by local authorities, sewer waste, and home waste 
composted or fed to animals. Soft drink waste was 
quantifi
 ed through waste compositional analysis, a 7 day 
diary of sewer-related waste, and a 7 day waste diary of 
multiple 
disposal 
routes. 
The 
average 
mid-year 
population size in the UK during the same period (ie, 
between 2008 and 2012) was 62·8 million.21
To study the population distribution of sugar-sweetened 
beverage consumption, we calculated sugar-sweetened 
beverage consumption for each individual participating in 
NDNS, taking into account dietary under-reporting. This 
calculation was based on two observations. First, there was 
a 30% discrepancy between the average sugar-sweetened 
beverage consumption estimated from BSDA sales data 
(272 mL per person per day) and that estimated from

NDNS diary data (191 mL per person per day) after sugar-
sweetened beverage waste was subtracted from sales data. 
This discrepancy increased to 41% when fruit juices were 
excluded from sugar-sweetened beverages in both data 
sources (227 mL per day from BSDA sales data and 133 mL 
per day from NDNS diary data). Second, the average self-
reported total energy intake was 27% lower than total 
energy expenditure19 derived from the gold standard 
method—ie, the double labelled water method22—in the 
NDNS RP, suggesting substantial under-reporting in 
dietary surveys.23 A selectively higher under-reporting for 
sugar intake and unhealthy food intake was also reported.24,25 
We therefore assumed the discrepancy between the two 
fi
 gures was attributable to under-reporting—ie, 30% under-
reporting in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption 
including fruit juices and 41% under-reporting when fruit 
juices were excluded. We addressed this issue by 
proportionally increasing self-reported sugar-sweetened 
beverage consumption (ie, divided by 70% when fruit juices 
were included and 59% when fruit juices were excluded), 
assuming that under-reporting occurred proportionally for 
all individuals. Equally, free sugars and energy intake from 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages were also 
proportionally multiplied. We described overall and 
subgroup sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by age 
and household income. The descriptive statistics were 
weighted for the population structure and non-response in 
NDNS where appropriate.
We calculated the predicted reduction in energy intake 
for each individual participating in the NDNS RP between 
2008 and 2012, assuming that sugar-sweetened beverage 
consumption will remain stable in the period in which the 
proposed strategy is being implemented. To better 
understand the eff
 ect of the proposed strategy, we 
attempted to relate predicted energy reduction to change 
in steady-state bodyweight. However, this analysis was 
diffi
  cult because of the variation in resting metabolic rate 
and energy cost of physical activity in individuals, and 
their change with bodyweight. To overcome these 
complexities, we calculated the expected change in steady-
state bodyweight for each adult at an individual level using 
the mathematical model proposed by Kevin Hall and 
colleagues,26 which took into account the dynamic 
physiological adaptation to changes in bodyweight. The 
predicted change in bodyweight from this model closely 
matches the observed change (r=0·983) in their study.26 
We applied the model to each adult in NDNS RP between 
2008 and 2012, on the basis of his or her predicted 
reduction in energy intake, age, sex, height, weight, and 
physical activity. A detailed description of the modelling 
procedure is provided in the appendix. On the basis of the 
predicted steady-state bodyweight and BMI of each adult 
in the NDNS RP, each adult was classifi
 ed into the relevant 
weight status group (ie, obese, overweight, or normal and 
underweight), from which the predicted reduction in the 
number of overweight and obese adults was obtained and 
thereby the reduction in the prevalence of overweight and 
obesity was derived. These values were then scaled up to 
the whole UK adult population to obtain the number of 
overweight and obese cases that would be prevented 
nationwide.
To predict the number of obesity-related type 2 diabetes 
cases that would be prevented, we used the calculation 
from Wang and colleagues,27 whereby a 1% reduction in 
BMI of the entire UK population would prevent 
179 000–202 000 incident diabetes cases in two decades. 
This estimation was simulated by creating virtual UK 
individuals based on the projected BMI distribution, and 
the risk of developing type 2 diabetes was simulated as a 
function of age, sex, and, BMI.27
Statistical analysis
Means and 95% CI were reported where appropriate. We 
calculated 95% CIs using the bootstrapping method 
(resampling 1000 times) because it provides robust 
estimates even when data are skewed.28 All the analyses, 
including the consumption level of sugar-sweetened 
beverages, the predicted reduction in energy intake, and 
the predicted reduction in bodyweight were done for the 
general population as a whole rather than for consumers 
of sugar-sweetened beverages only. For individuals 
who didn’t consume sugar-sweetened beverages, the 
consumption level was zero, and the predicted reductions 
in energy intake and bodyweight were also zero. Data 
analyses were done with SAS version 9.4 and models for 
change in bodyweight were built with R version 3.2.2.
Sensitivity analysis
To test the robustness of the results with respect to 
the assumption that under-reporting occurred pro-
portionally for all individuals, we simulated several

scenarios wherein the under-reporting of sugar-
sweetened beverage consumption was higher in 
overweight or obese individuals and lower in normal 
weight or underweight individuals (with the total 
sugar-sweetened beverage consumption unchanged), 
which has been the case in most dietary surveys. We 
calculated the predicted reductions in bodyweight in 
these scenarios and compared them with the results of 
our main analysis.
Additionally, to test the robustness of the Kevin Hall 
model used in the main analysis, we calculated the 
predicted change in bodyweight arising from reduction in 
energy intake using two alternative methods. First, we 
used the commonplace, although widely disregarded, 
“3500 kcal=1 lb” rule—ie, a cumulative defi
 cit of 3500 kcal 
would result in a reduction in bodyweight of 1 lb 
(ie, 0·45 kg), irrespective of the variation between 
individuals.29 Second, we used the model proposed by

Results
The estimated annual consumption of sugar-sweetened 
beverages in the UK has increased by at least 400 million 
litres during the past decade and has remained steadily 
high during 2010–13 (fi
 gure 2). In parallel with the 
increase in consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, 
there has been a gradual rise in the average BMI of adults 
from 26·9 kg/m² in 2005 to 27·2 kg/m² in 2013, and an 
increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity 
from 60·5% to 62·1% in adults.
The average consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages 
in the UK in 2008–12 was 272 g per person per day. 
1654 (83·5%) of 1982 children and 1416 (65·1%) of 
2174 adults consumed sugar-sweetened beverages on a 
daily basis. The proportions of sugar-sweetened beverage 
consumers were particularly high in 576 (87%) of 
664 children aged 6–11 years, 681 (88%) of 775 adolescents 
aged 12–18 years, and 153 (84%) of 183 young adults 
aged 19–25 years. Daily sugar-sweetened beverage 
consumption contributed to 47 g (43·9%) and 49 g 
(44·5%) of total free sugar intake, and 182 kcal (7·1%) of 
the daily energy intake in adolescents and 185 kcal 
(6·6%) of the daily intake in young adults, both exceeding 
the UK SACN’s recommendation of a daily free sugar 
intake of no more than 5% of daily energy intake. 
Moreover, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was 
highest in low-income households (<£5000 per year), 
with an average of 344 g per person per day, contributing 
to 32 g (33·3%) of daily free sugar intake and 122 kcal 
(4·9%) of daily energy intake. Average consumption of 
sugar-sweetened beverages excluding fruit juices was 
227 g per person per day in the overall population, with 
about 70% of young people aged 6–25 years being 
consumers. The distribution of the consumption level in 
diff
 erent age groups and household income groups was 
similar to the distribution when fruit juices were 
included (table 1).
The proposed strategy is predicted to reduce the 
average energy intake by 38·4 kcal per day (95% CI 
36·3–40·7) by the end of the fi
 fth year since the start of 
the sugar reduction programme. For adolescents aged 
12–18 years and young adults aged 19–25 years, energy 
intake would be reduced by 72·7 kcal and 74·0 kcal per 
day in the fi
 fth year, respectively. There would also be a 
greater reduction of 48·8 kcal per day by the end of the 
fi
 fth year in individuals from low-income households 
(table 2).
The predicted reduction in energy intake would lead to a 
gradual reduction in bodyweight in the long term. The 
average reduction in steady-state bodyweight is predicted 
to be 1·20 kg (95% CI 1·12–1·28; fi
 gure 3), resulting in a 
reduction in the prevalence in adults of overweight by 
1·0 percentage point (from 35·5 % to 34·5%) and obese by 
2·1 percentage points (from 27·8% to 25·7%). This 
reduction would amount to roughly 0·5 million cases of 
overweight and 1·0 million cases of obesity being reduced 
in the UK (fi
 gures 3, 4).
The BMI of UK adults is predicted to be reduced from 
27·48 kg/m² in 2010 to 27·06 kg/m² when the predicted 
reduction in bodyweight is achieved, representing a 1·5% 
reduction. This reduction would in turn prevent about 
274 000–309 000 incident cases of type 2 diabetes over the 
subsequent two decades (ie, roughly 15 000 per year).
In the separate analysis in which we excluded fruit 
juices, the average predicted reduction in energy intake 
would be 31·0 kcal per day (95% CI 28·6–33·7; table 3), 
which would lead to a 0·96 kg (0·88–1·04) reduction in 
steady-state bodyweight (fi
 gure 3). This reduction would 
result in a 0·7 percentage point (0·3 million) reduction 
in overweight and a 1·7 percentage point (0·8 million) 
reduction in obesity in the UK adult population (fi
 gure 4).

The predicted reduction in average BMI (from 27·48 to 
27·14 kg/m²) in the analysis excluding fruit juices is 
estimated to prevent around 221 000–250 000 diabetes 
cases over two decades after the predicted reduction in 
bodyweight is achieved. In our sensitivity analyses, with 
the increase in the proportion of under-reporting of 
sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by overweight 
and obese individuals and the decrease in the proportion 
of under-reporting by normal weight and underweight 
individuals, the reduction in the average bodyweight of 
all adults was larger than in the main analysis (appendix).
If the “3500 kcal=1 lb” is used, the average cumulative 
reduction in energy intake would be around 14 016 kcal 
(95% CI 13 250–14 856) over 5 years since the start of the 
sugar reduction programme, considering that the 
average reduction in energy intake was 38·4 kcal per day 
(95% CI 36·3–40·7) at the end of the fi
 fth year. This 
energy reduction would lead to an average reduction in 
bodyweight of about 1·80 kg (95% CI 1·70–1·91). 
Alternatively, if the model proposed by Christiansen and 
Garby30 was used to predict the change in steady-state 
bodyweight, the average reduction would be 1·55 kg 
(1·44–1·65) if the proposed strategy was implemented for 
5 years since the start of the sugar reduction programme, 
representing a 1·3 percentage point reduction in the 
prevalence of overweight and 2·4 percentage point 
reduction in the prevalence of obesity. The predicted 
reduction in bodyweight from both models was greater 
than that from our main analysis, suggesting that our 
main results might be conservative estimates of the 
eff
 ect of the proposed strategy.
Discussion
Although tackling obesity has been listed as a priority by 
WHO,32 very few public health strategies that reduce 
obesity at a national or worldwide level exist. Several 
factors are implicated in obesity. However, increased 
energy intake from energy-dense foods and drinks, 
largely because of changes in food environment, is the 
key contributor to the worldwide rise in obesity.33 Without 
changing the food environment, eff
 ective behavioural 
interventions targeted at individuals have been shown 
not to be sustainable in the long term.33
The proposed strategy in our study is an important and 
practical approach to lead the way in changing the food 
environment to curb or reverse the obesity epidemic. 
Our fi
 ndings show that a stepwise, gradual, unobtrusive 
reduction in free sugars added to sugar-sweetened 
beverages would potentially lead to an eff
 ective and 
sustainable reduction in energy intake, resulting in a 
substantial reduction in bodyweight and obesity in the 
long term. This reduction will in turn reduce the 
obesity-related disease burden, including diabetes, and 
also lead to cost savings for health-care systems.
On the basis of the UK’s salt reduction programme, 
which led to a reduction in the salt content of many food 
products by 40% over 5 years,11 we proposed a similar 
gradual and stepwise reduction in sugar contents in 
sugar-sweetened beverages. The proposed strategy has 
several advantages, as shown by the success of the UK 
national salt reduction programme.11 First, human sugar 
taste preference adapts to a small and gradual reduction 
in sugar and it is unlikely that the proposed strategy will 
aff
 ect consumers’ choices provided that the reduction is 
done gradually over 5 years. Sugar taste preference has 
been shown to be adjustable in a couple of weeks by 
cutting out all added sugars and artifi
 cial sweeteners.34 
Second, a reduction in energy intake from sugar-
sweetened beverages is unlikely to increase energy intake 
from other pathways;35 this is also supported by the fact 
that reducing salt in processed food did not increase the 
use of table salt.36 Third, a reduction of sugar added to 
sugar-sweetened beverages will have little eff
 ect on the 
cost and price of the product and therefore is unlikely to

aff
 ect sales and profi
 ts for the soft drink industry, 
meaning it could be seen as an attractive prospect 
politically. However, some industry players, such as the 
sugar industry itself, might be resistant.37 Most major UK 
supermarkets have already agreed to gradually reduce 
the amount of sugar in their own brands added to soft 
drinks. British Retail Consortium, which represents the 
British supermarkets, has called for mandatory targets to 
be set.38–40 This would ensure—as happened with salt 
reduction—that branded companies are forced to follow 
their example. Finally, compared with behaviour change 
at an individual level, the proposed strategy would 
change the environmental determinants of obesity and 
will benefi
 t all consumers of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, 
particularly those who consume more—ie, children, 
adolescents, young adults, and individuals from 
low-income households (who are more likely to become 
obese and develop type 2 diabetes).
To ensure that the proposed strategy works in a 
sustainable and practical way, several key components 
are necessary. First and most importantly, clear targets, 
both average and maximum targets for each category of 
soft drinks, should be set to provide a level playing fi
 eld 
for soft drink manufacturers. A survey done by Action on 
Sugar shows that the amount of free sugars added to 
carbonated sugar-sweetened beverages varies hugely, 
from 3 g to 53 g per 330 mL (regular serving size).41 For 
example, free sugar contents in sugar-sweetened cola 
drinks, the most popular fl
 avour soft drink in the UK, 
ranged from 19 g to 37 g per 330 mL, suggesting that the 
scope for reduction of the free sugar content is 
substantial. Second, an independent agency with strong 
leadership should be set up to ensure that manufacturers 
comply with the targets, with punitive measures for 
companies that do not take action. Third, the successful 
implementation of the proposed strategy will depend on 
close collaboration and active engagement between the 
soft drink industry, government, non-governmental 
organisations, and health professionals.
With the lower free sugar targets set by WHO15 and 
SACN13 in 2015, the role of sugar-sweetened beverage 
consumption in contributing to obesity has received 
much attention. Heated debates have occurred about 
possible strategies to reduce free sugar intake from 
sugar-sweetened beverages, with the substitution of 
sugar with non-caloric sweeteners and the levying of a 
tax on sugar-sweetened beverages among the most 
practical suggestions discussed.
 
Substitution of sugary sweeteners with non-caloric 
sweeteners might be perceived as more practical than 
our proposed strategy. However, the existing evidence 
for the eff
 ectiveness of such substitution to tackle 
obesity is insuffi
  cient. First, the eff
 ect on bodyweight of 
replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with drinks 
containing artifi
 cial sweeteners is controversial.42 
Second, although several artifi
 cial sweeteners have been 
assessed as safe if consumed below the acceptable daily 
intake,43 evidence from some experimental studies44 and 
epidemiological studies45,46 suggests the opposite. More 
problematically, non-caloric sweeteners might change 
the reward processing of sweet taste47 and might cause a 
taste preference for very sweet foods, which is usually 
high in calories and would therefore lead to a poor 
quality, energy-dense diet.46 Our proposed strategy will 
lead to a gradual reduction in the density of sweetness 
of soft drinks through reduction of free sugar content 
and non-caloric sweeteners, which is important for 
creating a supportive environment to help people to 
become less habituated to sweet tastes and choose foods 
with less sugar.
Another promising public health strategy is levying tax 
or introducing sugar duty on sugar-sweetened beverages, 
which has been implemented in several countries 
including Finland, France, Hungary, several states of the 
USA, and Mexico.48 An increase in sugar-sweetened 
beverage price by 10% has been estimated to lead to a 
reduction of about 13% in demand for sugar-sweetened 
beverages.49 For this reason, soft drink manufacturers 
might be more resistant to the tax policy compared with 
our proposed strategy. However, our proposed strategy is 
compatible with the tax strategy and the eff
 ect on calorie 
intake could be even greater if both policies are 
implemented together.
Our study has several strengths. First, it is the fi
 rst study 
to have proposed and assessed a stepwise and sustainable 
reduction in free sugars added to sugar-sweetened 
beverages, which could potentially lead to a substantial 
reduction in the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and 
type 2 diabetes. The approach has a great chance of 
success, since a similar strategy has been proven eff
 ective 
with salt. Second, we used representative national survey 
data at population and individual levels, enabling us to 
produce nationally representative results that can inform 
national public health policies. Third, to estimate sugar-
sweetened beverage consumption more accurately, sales 
data and diary data were combined to address the highly 
prevalent issue of diet misreporting, which has rarely 
been considered in similar studies.31,50 Finally, we did 
several separate analyses to test the robustness of our 
assumptions and modelling, the results of which 
suggested that our main fi
 ndings are conservative.
Our study also has several potential limitations. First, 
our main analysis was based on the assumption that 
under-reporting occurs proportionally in all individuals, 
whereas under-reporting is higher in adults and in 
overweight and obese individuals, and under-reporting 
tends to be selectively higher for intake of sugars and 
other unhealthy foods.23–25 Although we have tried to 
correct for the issue of under-reporting, our results are 
still likely to have underestimated the potential eff
 ect of 
the proposed policy. Second, we used data from several 
sources and built models based on previous studies, 
making the quality of our study dependent on the quality 
of the data and model used. However, the data we used

9
were from nationally representative samples of the UK 
population and the models were also validated26 and used 
in other similar studies.50 Finally, we only predicted weight 
change for adults because the model for bodyweight is for 
energy-balanced individuals and is not suitable for 
children, who usually have a positive energy intake.
In conclusion, the results of our study show that the 
proposed strategy could lead to a profound reduction in 
energy intake from sugar-sweetened beverages and could 
therefore lower the prevalence of overweight, obesity, 
and type 2 diabetes in the long term. These fi
 ndings 
provide strong support for the implementation of the 
proposed strategy. Individuals should also reduce their 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages in the long 
term, but this can be diffi
  cult because of the advertising 
power of industry. Our proposed strategy provides an 
innovative and practical way to gradually reduce energy 
intake 
from 
sugar-sweetened 
beverages 
and 
its 
combination with other strategies, including a tax on 
sugar-sweetened beverages, would produce a more 
powerful eff
 ect.
