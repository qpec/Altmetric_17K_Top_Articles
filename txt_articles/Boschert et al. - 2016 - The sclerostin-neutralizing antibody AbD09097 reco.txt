The glycoprotein sclerostin has been identified as a negative regulator of bone
growth. It exerts its function by interacting with the Wnt co-receptor LRP5/6,
blocks the binding of Wnt factors and thereby inhibits Wnt signalling.
Neutralizing anti-sclerostin antibodies are able to restore Wnt activity and
enhance bone growth thereby presenting a new osteoanabolic therapy
approach for diseases such as osteoporosis. We have generated various Fab
antibodies against human and murine sclerostin using a phage display set-
up. Biochemical analyses have identified one Fab developed against murine
sclerostin, AbD09097 that efficiently neutralizes sclerostin’s Wnt inhibitory
activity. In vitro interaction analysis using sclerostin variants revealed that
this neutralizing Fab binds to sclerostin’s flexible second loop, which has
been shown to harbour the LRP5/6 binding motif. Affinity maturation was
then applied to AbD09097, providing a set of improved neutralizing Fab anti-
bodies which particularly bind human sclerostin with enhanced affinity.
Determining the crystal structure of AbD09097 provides first insights into
how this antibody might recognize and neutralize sclerostin. Together with
the structure–function relationship derived from affinity maturation these
new data will foster the rational design of new and highly efficient anti-scler-
ostin antibodies for the therapy of bone loss diseases such as osteoporosis.
1. Introduction
Bone is not a dead tissue, but undergoes a permanent adaptation throughout
life. In fact, bone modelling occurs continuously to react to differences in mech-
anical load as well as physiological changes and is not just limited to
remodelling after fracture repair. In adulthood, bone formation and bone degra-
dation are usually balanced. At the cellular level this is achieved by fine-tuning
the activity of two ‘opposing’ cell types, the bone-forming osteoblasts and the
bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Osteocytes, a third class of cells, act as master reg-
ulators controlling the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts through different
hormones and signalling cascades. Disturbing this equilibrium will inevitably
lead to pathological conditions. One such example is osteoporosis, which mani-
fests itself by a low bone mineral density leading to a high fracture probability.
The disease particularly affects ageing women past menopause probably due to
the change in estrogen levels, but also men can suffer from idiopathic
osteoporosis. Until recently, the majority of therapeutic approaches against
osteoporosis acted to prevent further bone loss usually by targeting the

 bone-resorbing osteoclasts [1]. Therefore, new treatments
that stimulate bone formation and restore initial bone
strength are actively pursued in pharmaceutical research
and development.
Osteocytes express a protein called sclerostin [2,3], whose
name derives from the disease sclerosteosis [4], a rare severe
and progressive craniotubular hyperostosis with an autoso-
mal
recessive
inheritance.
Sclerosteosis

encoding gene SOST [2,5], but heterozygous carriers have

dosage effect for sclerostin [6]. In the related van Buchem dis-
ease, an enhancer element for SOST expression is silenced
[7,8]. The most prominent phenotype of both diseases is a
progressive bone overgrowth leading to high bone mass, frac-
ture resistance, gigantism and distortion of the facial features
(for reviews, see [9,10]), indicating that sclerostin is a negative
regulator of bone formation. It was shown that sclerostin inhi-
bits Wnt signalling [11,12], an important pathway for bone
formation and bone remodelling (for reviews, see [13,14]).
Mutations in the genes of Wnt proteins like Wnt1, Wnt3a,
Wnt5a, Wnt10b and Wnt16 in humans or mice either result
in low bone mass or affect bone mineral density denoting
that these Wnt factors are required for proper bone formation
[15–20]. In canonical Wnt signalling, Wnt proteins bind to a
receptor of the Frizzled family and to the coreceptor LRP5/6
leading to stabilization of the intracellular protein b-catenin.
The latter then translocates to the nucleus where it acts as
transcriptional co-activator for Wnt-responsive genes (for
reviews, see [21,22]). Sclerostin abrogates this signalling by
its ability to bind to and block the Wnt coreceptor LRP5/6
[11,12]. A similar mechanism was shown for the four mem-
bers (Dkk1–4) of the Wnt modulator family dickkopf,
which share no sequence similarity with sclerostin and also
block Wnt receptor activation by binding to LRP5/6 [23].
Sclerostin’s negative impact on bone formation is also seen
from targeted deletion of SOST in mice [24]. Sclerostin knock-
out mice display a strongly increased bone formation in the
limb and massively enhanced bone strength [24]. Interest-
ingly, the increase of bone formation was limited to the
skeleton and no ectopic bone formation was observed.
These properties make sclerostin a highly interesting drug
target for a new osteoanabolic treatment of osteoporosis, as
can be seen from current attempts to bring an anti-sclerostin
drug to the market ([25,26], for review, see [9]).
Sclerostin shares limited sequence similarities with the bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) modulator proteins of the DAN
family [27]. DAN members as well as sclerostin contain a
cystine-knot motif, which comprises six cysteine residues form-
ing a knot from three disulfide bonds; however, sclerostin and
the related WISE (SOSTDC1) were shown to be monomeric pro-
teins [28–30] and the classical DAN members such as gremlin,
PRDC (gremlin2) and NBL1 seem to function as homodimers
([31,32], for review, see [33]). Furthermore, whereas classical
DAN members indeed impede BMP signalling by binding
BMPs with high affinity [34], sclerostin was shown to act on
the Wnt pathway and not by blocking BMP receptor activation
[35]. The different architecture is also reflected in structural
differences. The DAN members NBL1 and PRDC exhibit an
arc-like dimer structure, in which all three loops emanating
from the cystine-knot core are highly structured. In sclerostin,
only the first and the third loops, which are running in parallel
from the central cystine-knot, are structured forming two 2-
stranded b-sheets, termed fingers 1 and 2 [29,30]. The second
loop, which runs in the opposite direction, is highly flexible
due to lack of structure-forming van der Waals contacts, as
are present in the dimer interface of the DAN members
PRDC and NBL1. Interestingly, several studies indicate that
this flexible loop is important for sclerostin’s ability to neutral-
ize Wnt signalling. First, Veverka et al. [29] showed that an
antibody neutralizing sclerostin’s inhibitory activity on Wnt/
b-catenin signalling binds to the flexible second loop. Second,
structure–function studies showed that mutations in the tip
of that loop impair binding of sclerostin to LRP6 as well as its
Wnt inhibitory capacity [36,37].
The Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 are modular pro-
teins comprising four propeller domains in the extracellular
part. Li et al. [11] were able to show that binding of sclerostin
to LRP5 only requires the first two propeller domains, whereas
the Wnt modulator Dkk1 interacts with all four propeller
domains of LRP5 indicating that the inhibitory mechanism
of sclerostin and dickkopf proteins possibly differs. Struc-
ture–function studies then confirmed that the C-terminal
domain of Dkk1 binds to propeller 3 and 4 of LRP6 [38–40],
whereas a short tri-peptide segment (NXI) present in the N-
terminal segment of Dkk1 as well as in the above-mentioned
second loop of sclerostin and WISE (SOSTDC1) binds to the
first propeller domain of LRP6 [41]. Thus, Wnt inhibition by
Dkk1 and sclerostin seems to follow a competition mechanism
by which binding of the modulator proteins blocks the inter-
action of Wnt factors with LRP5/6.
For further studies on how sclerostin antagonizes Wnt
signalling and which determinants are involved in Wnt
inhibition, we have developed antibodies against sclerostin
employing a phage-selection procedure. Using recombinant
human and murine sclerostin proteins as well as loop-
mimicking peptides as antigens, we obtained various Fab
antibody fragments showing high binding specificity for scler-
ostin. Functional analyses such as surface plasmon resonance
(SPR), peptide mapping and cellular assays were used to
characterize in vitro properties, providing a ‘tool set’ compris-
ing species-specific Fabs as well as different antibodies that
bind virtually to any region of sclerostin. Furthermore, an anti-
body AbD09097 was obtained that neutralizes sclerostin’s
ability to inhibit Wnt signalling. To further improve its effi-
ciency, we applied affinity maturation to this Fab fragment.
A crystal structure analysis of AbD09097 provides the first
high-resolution structural insights into a neutralizing anti-
sclerostin
antibody,
which
will

facilitate
new
approaches for therapies targeting osteoporosis.

anti-sclerostin
antibodies
via
a
phage-
panning selection, recombinant human and murine sclerostin
were expressed in Sf9 insect cells as full-length proteins con-
taining
an

lated
employing

chromatography
using Ni2þ-NTA as resin (Qiagen) and a subsequent cation-
exchange chromatography using CM Sepharose (GE Health-
care) and a linear gradient of 0–1 M sodium chloride in
10 mM HEPES pH 7.5.

 Human and murine sclerostin proteins and variants thereof
used for in vitro interaction analysis and cellular assays such as
reporter gene studies were expressed, refolded and purified
from Escherichia coli as published previously [30,42].
15N-labelled murine sclerostin used for nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) chemical shift titration mapping to deter-
mine the binding sites of Fab antibodies was produced in
E. coli Rosetta (DE3) using M9 minimal medium supplemented
with 0.5 g l21 15NH4Cl as described [30]. After refolding of the
protein the N-terminal hexahistidine-tag was removed using
biotinylated thrombin (Novagen). The endopeptidase was
removed by streptavidin agarose (Novagen). Highly pure
15N-labelled murine sclerostin protein was then obtained by
applying
RP-HPLC
using
a
preparative
C8
column
and employing a water–acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% (v/v)
trifluoroacetic acid.
2.2. Peptide production
Peptides were synthesized by automated Fmoc-based solid-
phase peptide synthesis using a Rink-amide resin (Bachem)
on a Symphony peptide-synthesizer (Protein Technologies).
Crude peptides were purified by C18 RP-HPLC. The correct
molecular masses of the peptides were confirmed by electro-
spray ionization mass spectrometry on an AquityTM SQD
mass spectrometer (Waters).
The cysteine residues on peptide PFD038, comprising resi-
dues 86–111 of human sclerostin, were either cross-linked with
1,3-bis(bromomethyl)benzene (mT2 CLIPSTM) (PFD038_mT2),
disulfide-bridged by oxidation (PFD038_ox), or reacted with
iodoacetamide
(PFD038_IAM)
to
enforce
linear
peptide
structure [42,43].
2.3. Phage display library panning and Fab generation
For generation of antibodies against murine and human scleros-
tin the HuCAL GOLD library [44] was used. Sclerostin proteins
were biotinylated using EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), coupled to streptavidin-coated magnetic
beads (Dynal, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and antigen-binding
antibodies were selected with these sclerostin-coated beads by
three rounds of solution panning. In each panning round,
the antibody phage library was incubated with biotinylated
sclerostin protein, binding Fabs were captured via streptavidin-
coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen) and phages were eluted
with 25 mM DTT. To obtain antibodies specific for the target
protein, the beads were washed at room temperature on a
Kingfisher instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The first
round of washing was performed six times for 1 min, in the
second round a more stringent washing was done eight times
for 1 min 30 s, and in the third round the beads were washed
eight times for 3 min with PBS buffer containing 0.05% (v/v)
Tween 20 (PBST), followed in each round by one wash cycle in
PBS for 2 min. To obtain species-specific antibodies against
murine and human sclerostin, separate rounds of panning
were performed on both recombinant proteins.
For screening of the antibodies, E. coli of the strain TG1F2
(TG1
without
the
F-plasmid)
were
transformed
and
individual colonies were randomly picked and grown in
micro-titre plates. After expression overnight at 228C upon
induction with 1 mM IPTG, the cultures were chemically
lysed (0.4 M boric acid buffer, pH 8.0 containing 320 mM
NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) lysozyme and 12.5 U ml21
Benzonasew (Merck Millipore)) and the crude extracts were
tested via ELISA for the presence of specifically binding
antibody fragments. For all clones exhibiting a strong binding
signal for the antigens (greater than or equal to fivefold
over
background)
the
DNA
sequence
encoding
the
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the anti-
body
variable
heavy
chain
was
determined.
Colonies
containing antibodies with unique CDR3 sequence were
chosen for subsequent purification.
After three rounds of panning, the pool of Fab genes was
isolated and inserted into E. coli expression vectors. These
vectors allow for functional periplasmic expression of mono-
valent Fab equipped with two peptide sequences at the
C-terminus of the antibody heavy chain, a myc-tag (EQKLI-
SEEDL) and a hexahistidine-tag, the latter of which was
used for purification. This format (called Fab-Thr-MH) also
contains a cleavage site between the CH1 domain and the
tag region for the endopeptidase thrombin allowing for pro-
teolytic removal of both sequences. Preparative production of
recombinant Fabs was performed as described [45].
2.4. Affinity maturation by targeted diversification of
the CDR3 of the variable light chain
The DNA fragment encoding the Fab AbD09097 was subcloned
into a phagemid vector based on pMORPH23 [24,44]. For affi-
nity maturation, a phage library was generated in which the
DNA region encoding the variable light chain CDR3 was
replaced with a repertoire of variable light chain CDR3
sequences. Escherichia coli TOP10F’ cells (Invitrogen) were trans-
formed with the ligated vectors generating a libraryof about 3 �
106 different clones. This phage library was subjected to a sol-
ution panning approach as described above but using
decreasing amounts of biotinylated recombinant human scler-
ostin (produced from Sf9 insect cells) in the two selection
rounds (230 nM biotinylated recombinant human sclerostin in
the first and 23 nM in the second round of panning). Compared
with the panning procedure for generation of the Fab antibodies
above a more stringent washing was used. In the first round of
maturation washing was eight times for 3 min with PBST and in
the second round 24 times for 3 min with PBST, followed in each
round by one wash cycle in PBS for 2 min. Selection and pro-
duction
of
the
affinity-maturated
Fab
antibodies
was
performed as described above.
2.5. ELISA for selection of specific anti-sclerostin
antibodies
Black Nunc MaxiSorp 384 well plates (Thermo Fisher Scienti-
fic) were coated overnight at 48C with a 5 mg ml21 solution
of protein in PBS. For immobilization of the biotinylated
peptides and proteins, neutravidin (Pierce) was first coated in
the wells. After blocking non-specific binding sites with 5%
(w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBST, the biotinylated anti-
gens were added to the wells at a concentration of 2 mg ml21
and the plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
Then the microtitre plates were washed and an aliquot of the
Fab protein at a concentration of 2 mg ml21 was added to
each well. For binding of the Fab to the presented antigens
the plates were incubated for one hour at room temperature.
Detection was performed using an anti-human Fab–alkaline
phosphatase conjugate (AbD Serotec) using AttoPhos (Roche)

 as a substrate. Signals from this Fab–secondary detection anti-
body pair interacting with immobilized control proteins BSA,
N1-CD33-His6 (the ectodomain of human CD33 fused to the
N1 domain of the g3p filamentous phage M13 as described
in [46]) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were used for
calculation of the background.
2.6. Interaction analysis using surface plasmon
resonance
The SPR analyses for the measurement of in vitro interactions
were performed using a ProteOnTM system (Bio-Rad) at a
temperature of 258C as described [42]. HBS150T (10 mM
HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) was
used as running buffer. Murine or human sclerostin proteins
or variants thereof were used as ligands. They were immobi-
lized to a surface density of about 600 resonance units (RU)
on an activated ProteOnTM GLC sensor chip (Bio-Rad) in verti-
cal direction using amine coupling. The antibodies were used
as analytes and were injected simultaneously in six different
concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 nM in HBS150T
unless indicated otherwise) in horizontal direction (single-
shot kinetic set-up). The association was monitored for 200 s
at a flow rate of 100 ml min21. Data for dissociation were
acquired for 200 s by perfusing HBS150T buffer at a flow rate
of 100 ml min21. Unspecific binding and bulk face effects
were removed by subtracting the interaction of the analyte
with a non-modified surface of a control flow channel. The
chip surface was regenerated by a 60 s pulse of 10 mM glycine
pH 2.0. Binding affinities were determined from the rate con-
stants for association and dissociation using the PROTEONTM
MANAGER 3.1 software (Bio-Rad) and applying a simple 1 : 1
Langmuir type interaction model. The binding response was
normalized by determining the maximal binding response
(Rmax) using the interaction data of all antibody proteins
measured and then applying this maximal value in the fitting
of the data to obtain the association rate constant.
2.7. Wnt reporter gene assay
Cells were cultivated at 378C and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Invitro-
gen) containing 10% (v/v) FCS, 100 U ml21 penicillin G,
100 mg ml21 streptomycin (Invitrogen). A stable reporter cell
line (cell pool) termed HEK293TSA M50 for quantitative
measurement of Wnt activity was obtained by transfection
with the reporter construct M50 Super 8� TopFlash (provided
by Randall Moon) and a linearized hygromycin marker DNA
(Clontech) as described previously [36]. This cell pool shows
a dose-dependent luciferase expression in response to exogen-
ously applied recombinant Wnt3a or transfection of the cells
with a Wnt3a or Wnt1 expression plasmid.
Wnt reporter gene assays were performed as described [36].
Briefly, cells were seeded in 10 cm cell culture dishes (1.5 �
105 cells ml21), transfected the next day with 12 mg mWnt1
expression vector (mouse cDNA clone MC205633, Origene) or
the same amount of empty vector DNA (pEF6B, Invitrogen)
and transferred to 96-well plates the following day; 48 h post-
transfection cells were incubated with different concentrations
(0–100 nM) of wild-type murine or human sclerostin alone or
in the presence of indicated Fab fragments (500 nM). In a differ-
ent set-up, cells were incubated using a constant sclerostin
concentration (20 nM) and varying concentrations of Fab
fragments. In each case, stimulated cells were lysed after 24 h
using 50 ml reporter lysis buffer (Promega) per well and one
freeze and thaw cycle at 2808C. Twenty microlitres of the
obtained cell lysate were mixed with 20 ml of luciferase assay
substrate (Promega) and luciferase activities were measured
(Luminoscan Ascent, Labsystems). GRAPHPAD PRISM was used
for analysing the data by nonlinear regression (dose response
inhibition or dose response stimulation function).
2.8. Nuclear magnetic resonance mapping of the Fab-
binding epitope on sclerostin
About 25 nmol of freeze-dried 15N-labelled sclerostin variant
SOSTDNC (truncated murine sclerostin comprising residue
N36–R144) was dissolved in NMR buffer (20 mM potassium
phosphate pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) D2O, 0.2% (w/v)
NaN3). A second NMR sample contained 25 nmol 15N-labelled
SOSTDNC and additionally 25 nmol of the Fab AbD09097
(unlabelled).To ensureidentical bufferconditions, bothsamples
were dialysed against the same NMR buffer, subsequently con-
centrated to 250 ml (Centricon, Millipore) and transferred into
Shigemi tubes (Shigemi Corp.). NMR spectra were measured
at 278C using a 600 MHz Bruker Advance spectrometer
equipped with a triple-resonance, triple axis cryoprobe. Data
processing and analysis was performed using the software
TOPSPIN 2.0 and AURELIA (Bruker, Rheinstetten).
2.9. Epitope mapping of the Fab antibodies by peptide
arrays
To map the sclerostin epitopes recognized by the Fab antibodies
obtained from panning, peptide libraries were synthesized
on solid support [47]. Libraries consisted of all overlapping
linear and CLIPS constrained cyclic 15mer peptides derived
from murine and human sclerostin. In addition, libraries of all
overlapping linear 4, 5, 6, through to the 24mer peptides mimick-
ing the flexible loop 2 of human sclerostin were prepared. For the
peptide replacement array a series of substitution mutants of the
best binding 14mer (PARLLPNAIGRGKW) were prepared, in
which each residue was exchanged for all other proteinogenic
amino acids except Ile. Similarly two peptide libraries for a trun-
cation array analysis were synthesized on the basis of two 14mer
peptides (PARLLPNAIGRGKW and NAIGRGKWWRPSGP)
consisting of all truncated peptide variants from 3 to
14mer length. After titration with the antibodies, a modified
ELISA using a goat anti-human peroxidase coupled secondary
antibody was carried out as described [48].
2.10. Crystallization and structure determination of the
sclerostin-neutralizing Fab AbD09097
For crystallization, the Fab AbD09097 was further purified by
cation-exchange chromatography employing SP-Sepharose
(GE Healthcare) and a linear gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl
in 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0. Fractions containing pure
Fab protein were pooled, dialysed against 10 mM Tris–HCl
pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl and concentrated to about 10 mg ml21
using ultrafiltration.
Initial crystallization trials were performed using commer-
cially available screens (Qiagen/Nextal PACT, PEGs I and II
suites) using a sitting drop vapour-diffusion set-up. One

 microlitre protein solution (7.5–10 mg ml21) was mixed with
1 ml reservoir solution and placed above 100 ml reservoir sol-
ution. Optimization and production of crystals for data
acquisition were performed using a hanging drop vapour-
diffusion set-up. Crystals of AbD09097 suitable for diffraction
data acquisition were grown from 20% (w/v) PEG3350,
100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM ZnCl2. Rod-shaped crystals
with dimensions of 200 � 50 � 50 mm3 grew within three
weeks. Diffraction data from a single crystal at 100 K were
measured using an X-ray home source, a Rigaku MicroMax-
007 HF X-ray generator equipped with VariMax HF mirror
optics and a Rigaku R-AXIS HTC image plate detector
system. Data were processed and analysed using the software
iMOSFLM and CCP4i. Structure analysis and model building
was performed using the software QUANTA2008 (MSI Accelrys,
San Diego). For details of crystallization, data acquisition
and processing, see Boschert et al. [49] (for data statistics, see
electronic supplementary material, table S1).
3. Results
3.1. Generation of anti-sclerostin antibody fragments
(Fabs) using recombinant sclerostin as antigen
The Fab phage display library HuCAL GOLD was used for
generation of anti-sclerostin antibodies, employing recombi-
nant murine or human full-length sclerostin as antigen. For
each selection, 368 clones were tested for binding to the anti-
gen. From the panning employing murine sclerostin four
unique Fabs (designated AbD09094, 09095, 09096 and 09097)
could be obtained, whereas panning using human sclerostin
yielded seven unique Fabs (designated AbD09098, 09099,
09100, 09101, 09172, 09173 and 09174). These 11 Fab fragments
were expressed on a larger scale, purified and their binding
properties were tested in an ELISA using murine and human
sclerostin as well as unrelated control proteins to reveal their
specificity (figure 1). Specific binding could be confirmed for
all 11 antibodies. One Fab from the panning on murine scleros-
tin (AbD09094) showed preferential binding to the murine
antigen and three Fabs from the panning on human sclerostin
(AbD09172, 09173 and 09174), a better binding on the human
antigen. For more detailed information on the binding proper-
ties of the various sclerostin-targeting Fabs, we determined the
binding kinetics using SPR. Owing to the sticky nature as
apparent from unspecific interaction with the sensor matrix,
human and murine sclerostin were used as ligands immobi-
lized on the chip surface. The (monovalent) Fab antibodies
were used as analytes and the binding kinetics were deter-
mined employing the so-called one-shot kinetics set-up, i.e.
the analyte was perfused over the biosensor simultaneously
in six different concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 100 nM
(figure 2a,b; table 1). From the antibodies against murine scler-
ostin, Fabs AbD09094, 09095 and 09097 exhibited a high
affinity (between 50 and 60 nM) specifically for murine scleros-
tin, but either did not bind human sclerostin at all or did so
with at least fivefold lower affinity (table 1). Similarly, from
the antibodies derived from panning using human sclerostin,
the Fabs AbD09101 and AbD09172 bound the human antigen
with high affinity (AbD09101, KD ¼ 42 nM and AbD09172,
KD ¼ 12 nM) and did not interact with the murine homologue
at all. The Fab AbD09096 bound both isoforms similarly with a
KD of 199 nM for human and a KD of 157 nM for murine scler-
ostin, although the antibody was obtained from a panning
employing murine sclerostin. The five remaining antibodies,
which originate from the selection on human sclerostin, bind
only to the human protein, however, their binding affinities
are rather low with KD values between 200 and 960 nM
(table 1). In summary, we successfully obtained 11 different
Fab antibodies from phage display employing full-length
murine and human sclerostin, of which five recognize native
sclerostin with affinities in the nanomolar range in a species-
specific manner and thus represent valuable tools for detection
of sclerostin by various methods.
3.2. The Fab AbD09097 neutralizes sclerostin’s ability to
inhibit Wnt activity
The antibodies were then tested for their effect on sclerostin
bioactivity employing a reporter gene assay and using a
HEK293 cell line stably expressing a Wnt-responsible lucifer-
ase reporter construct. For stimulation of the Wnt/b-catenin
pathway the cells were first transfected with a plasmid
encoding for Wnt1. Two days after transfection recombinant
sclerostin was added to the cells resulting in a dose-depen-
dent inhibition of the Wnt1-mediated signal. The rescue
from sclerostin-mediated Wnt1 inhibition was then measured
by adding the Fab antibodies in a concentration of 500 nM to
different sclerostin concentrations (0–100 nM) and is shown
as fold change of sclerostin’s IC50 for the inhibition of Wnt1
activity (figure 2c,d). As shown in table 1, most Fabs

Figure 2. SPR analysis for the interaction of the Fab proteins with murine (a) and human (b) sclerostin. Sclerostin proteins were immobilized as ligands on the biosensor at
a density of about 600 RU using amino coupling chemistry. At time point zero Fab proteins were injected using six different analyte concentrations and the association was
measured for 200 s. Thereafter, buffer was perfused over the biosensor for 200 s to acquire the data for dissociation. For a direct comparison of the rate constants an overlay
of the sensograms of selected Fab proteins at a single analyte concentration of 25 nM is shown. Fitted data are shown as black dashed lines. To determine the effect of
antibody binding on sclerostin, HEK293TSA M50 cells were transfected with an expression vector for mWnt1 and incubated with serial dilutions of murine (c) or human (d)
recombinant sclerostin with or without the indicated Fab fragment (500 nM). The Wnt1-mediated luciferase expression was analysed and the concentration of sclerostin is
plotted against relative luciferase units (RLU) in percentage of RLU obtained with Wnt1-transfected but untreated cells (first data point). In a similar experimental set-up,
the transfected cells were incubated with serial dilutions of the indicated antibody fragment in the presence of a constant concentration (20 nM) of murine (e) or human
( f ) sclerostin. The signal obtained with sclerostin alone (first data point) was set to 0% and the signal of Wnt1-transfected but untreated cells was set to 100%. Data
points represent means of two values, error bars indicate s.d. Shown are typical experiments out of three.

 Fabs would interfere with sclerostin’s ability to compete
with Wnt1 for binding to the Wnt co-receptor LRP5/6.
This effect was, however, quite small for AbD09100 and
AbD09101 (two- to fourfold change in the IC50 values). Fur-
thermore, the changes in the IC50 values were similar for
human and murine sclerostin, even though both antibodies
in SPR specifically bound only human sclerostin, which
seriously questions the specificity of the neutralizing effect
of these two Fab antibodies. By contrast, Fab AbD09097
neutralized sclerostin-mediated inhibition of Wnt1 activity
with high efficiency. The concentration for half-maximal
inhibition of Wnt1 by murine sclerostin was on average
shifted almost 13-fold in the presence of AbD09097 and six-
fold when human sclerostin was used to inhibit Wnt1
activity (table 1 and figure 2c,d). Performing a Wnt1 reporter
gene assay with a constant concentration for both sclerostin
proteins of 20 nM and different concentrations of AbD09097
(0–670 nM)
confirmed
the
better efficacy
in
inhibiting
murine sclerostin (figure 2e,f). The Fab showed an effective
concentration (EC50) of 46+ 27 nM (n ¼ 4) for murine scler-
ostin and a fourfold lower activity (EC50 of 197 +123 nM (n
¼ 3)) for human sclerostin. This difference in efficacy might
be
explained
by
the
binding
properties
of
AbD09097
towards both sclerostin proteins (table 1).
3.3. Sclerostin-neutralizing antibodies bind to
sclerostin’s flexible loop
As the strong neutralizing capability of AbD09097 is a
unique property not seen for the other antibodies, we
tried to determine the binding epitope of this Fab. There
are
reports
of
other
sclerostin-neutralizing
antibodies,
which have already been tested in clinical trials [25,26].
Only for one has the binding epitope on sclerostin been
investigated. Using NMR it was shown that the antibody
Scl-AbI binds in the flexible second loop of human scleros-
tin [29]. This finding seems consistent with the notion that
the second loop, namely the loop tip containing the NXI-
motif, is the main binding determinant for binding of scler-
ostin to the first propeller of LRP6 [36,37,41]. In order to
determine the part of sclerostin recognized by AbD09097,
we initially performed a competitive ELISA (figure 3a,b)
using structured peptides corresponding to defined regions
of sclerostin as competitors. The ELISA plate was coated with
recombinant sclerostin and then probed with the different
Fabs. Two different peptides, PFD038-IAM and tSOST-
Db2ox, mimicking different sclerostin regions were used to
compete for the antibody binding. tSOST-Db2ox is a native
cysteine-bridged construct of the loops 1 and 3, but lacks
loop 2 [42]. PFD038-IAM comprises loop 2 and the cysteines
at the termini are carboxyamidomethylated to enforce a
linear peptide form. The non-neutralizing Fabs AbD09096,
09099, 09100, 09101, 09172 and 09173 could be displaced
with the peptide tSOST-Db2ox suggesting that their binding
site is outside loop 2 (EC50 from 68 to 242 nM) (figure 3a). How-
ever, AbD09097 was the only antibody that could be displaced
with the loop 2-mimicking peptide PFD038-IAM (EC50 ¼
6.4 nM),
indicating
that
the
neutralizing
property
of
AbD09097 is possibly linked to its binding epitope located in
the flexible loop 2 of sclerostin (figure 3b). To confirm this find-
ing, we performed an SPR analysis using murine and human
Table 1. Fab antibodies against murine and human sclerostin. Analysis of Fab antibodies derived from phage display using murine and human sclerostin as
antigens. The binding affinities of these Fabs were determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), KD values and kinetic parameters were obtained using a
set-up with the Fab antibody proteins as analytes (six different concentrations) and human and murine sclerostin as immobilized ligand. N.B. indicates no binding
in the SPR experiment, which under the measurement conditions corresponds to a lower binding affinity boundary of less than 5 mM; n.d., not determined.
Changes in bioactivity were measured by a Wnt-responsive reporter gene assay using HEK293TSA cells transfected with Wnt1. Indicated are the changes in IC50
value upon addition of Fab antibody compared with cells treated with recombinant sclerostin proteins alone (means of at least two experiments).

 sclerostin and two variants thereof (figure 3c–f), Scl Dloop and
Scl Alaloop, in which loop 2 is either truncated (in the variant
Scl Dloop Leu90 to Asn103 are replaced by a short glycine–
serine linker) or replaced by a scrambled amino acid sequence
(Scl Alaloop) and which were shown to be strongly impaired in
blocking Wnt1 activity [36]. No binding of AbD09097 could be
observed to both sclerostin variants (figure 3e,f; electronic sup-
plementary material, table S2). To further corroborate this
hypothesis we performed SPR competition analyses. Here
the neutralizing AbD09097 or exemplarily the non-neutraliz-
ing AbD09096 were perfused over a biosensor coated with
sclerostin either alone or in the presence of a twofold excess
of murine sclerostin or the variant Scl Dloop. For the Fab
AbD09096, wild-type sclerostin as well as the variant lacking
loop 2 (Scl Dloop) could abrogate the binding of AbD09096
to the sclerostin immobilized on the sensor chip surface
(figure 3g). This clearly shows that the non-neutralizing
AbD09096 recognizes and binds an epitope outside loop
2. By contrast, binding of the Fab AbD09097 to the sclerostin
biosensor was only impeded when wild-type full-length scler-
ostin was co-injected. In the presence of the variant Scl Dloop,
the neutralizing Fab AbD09097 could still bind to the sclerostin

 SPR sensor indicating that the sclerostin variant lacking loop 2
was incapable of blocking this interaction (figure 3h). Together
ELISA and SPR results imply that the binding epitope of
AbD09097 is restricted to the flexible loop 2 of sclerostin and
that the location of the epitope is linked to its neutralizing
activity against sclerostin-mediated Wnt inhibition.
3.4. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based epitope
mapping of the sclerostin-neutralizing Fab
AbD09097
To precisely identify the residues of sclerostin contributing to
the binding of the neutralizing Fab, we performed NMR
chemical shift mapping analysis by measuring 1H15N 2D-
HSQC spectra of uniformly labelled
15N-labelled murine
sclerostin lacking the flexible N- and C-terminus (SclDNC
[30]) in the presence and absence of AbD09097 (figure 4).
Both proteins were present at the same concentration and
as the binding of AbD09097 to sclerostin is strong (table 1)
and dissociation of the complex is very slow (see also
figures 2a and 3c), a correlation signal distinct from that of
free
sclerostin
is
to
be
expected
for each
residue
of
bound sclerostin which is in close proximity to the antibody
binding site.
Of note, the 1H15N 2D HSQC experiment of the sclerostin–
antibody complex yielded a spectrum with most signals
exhibiting a line width comparable with that in the spectrum
of free sclerostin. That was unexpected as usually NMR signals
get somewhat broadened due to the slow overall tumbling rate
and the subsequent fast relaxation of the magnetization for
proteins/protein complexes of this size, which can be over-
come by applying special techniques such as TROSY or
deuteration [50,51]. This, however, is mainly true for proteins
not exhibiting strong internal dynamics, which is not the
case for sclerostin. There it has been shown that loop 2 is
rather flexible as indicated by hetero-nuclear NOEs [30]. Con-
sequently, the lines of those residues are broadened by
exchange in the free form of sclerostin. Binding to AbD09097
would then reduce the dynamics and sharpen the lines
which counteracts the effect of line broadening due to the
overall size of the complex. The finger regions are not in con-
tact with the antibody and due to the internal flexibility retain
their original correlation time and line width.
When compared with the spectrum of free sclerostin,
chemical shift differences for a defined subset of amino acid
residues were observed indicating specific binding of the Fab
to sclerostin. A more detailed analysis indicated that the chemi-
cal shifts of several NMR signals were altered or broadened in
the spectrum of sclerostin bound to AbD09097 (figure 4a,b).
A graphical representation suggests that the binding epitope
of AbD09097 is located at the tip of loop 2 of sclerostin compris-
ing residues Leu90 to Gly104, but that the binding site of the
Fab also either includes residues close to the cystine-knot
(e.g. residues Glu52 to Tyr60, Leu78 to Gln83 and Val137 to
Arg144) or affects their conformation otherwise (figure 4b,c).
Thus, the neutralizing Fab AbD09097 has a very similar bind-
ing epitope to that observed for the neutralizing anti-
sclerostin antibody studied by Veverka et al. [29]. In the latter
antibody, the chemical shift values of residues Ala89 to
Asp108 of human sclerostin (equivalent to Ala87 to Asp106
in murine sclerostin) located in the flexible loop 2 showed the
highest difference between free and bound sclerostin. Similar
to our findings also some residues in or close to the cystine-
knot (e.g. Ala140 to Cys144) seemed to be affected or part of
the antibody binding site, which might be explained by the
fact that the size of an antibody epitope may consist of up to
20 amino acid residues and thus the tip of loop 2 may be too
small to cover all of the antibody binding site.
3.5. Determining the main binding determinant for the
sclerostin–Fab interactions
The epitope of AbD09097 was also analysed using peptide
arrays. An array consisting of all overlapping 15mers of
human and murine sclerostin readily identified the sequence
GRVKWW (residues 95–100) to contribute most to binding.
A slight preference for the murine sequence that contains
valine at position 95 where the human form contains glycine
was noted, but seems to be of minor importance. A first trunca-
tion analysis on all overlapping 4–24mer peptides of loop 2
derived from the human sequence corroborated the core
Figure 3. (Opposite.) AbD09097 binds to sclerostin’s flexible loop. (a) Competition ELISA measuring the binding of selected Fab antibodies to immobilized sclerostin
(human form, for AbD09096 and AbD09099 murine sclerostin) in the presence of the peptide tSOST-Db2ox (marked with A), which resembles a truncated sclerostin
protein only comprising finger 1 and 2, and PFD-038IAM (marked with B and displayed in red), which mimics the linear form of sclerostin loop 2. The data are
derived from a single experiment. (b) Competition ELISA measuring the binding of the Fab antibody AbD09097 to immobilized murine sclerostin in the presence of
an increasing concentration of the peptides PFD-038IAM and tSOST-Db2ox. The binding of the Fab was determined by a secondary anti-Fab alkaline-phosphatase
conjugate. The red and black data points indicate two separate experiments combined in one graph. (c–f) SPR sensograms are shown for the interaction of
AbD09097 and AbD09096 with murine (mScl, c), human (hScl, d) and the murine sclerostin variants Dloop (e) and AlaLoop (f). The sclerostin proteins were
immobilized on the chip surface. At time point zero AbD09097 was injected as analyte using six different concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 nM),
curves for 75 nM are shown. At time point 200 s injection of the Fab protein was stopped and the chip surface was perfused with buffer. Fitted curves are
shown as dashed lines. (g–h) SPR competition experiment for the Fabs AbD09096 (g) and AbD09097 (h). The left bars (marked with w/o) show the signal
(in resonance unit, RU) measured at 200 s perfusion of 300 nM Fab fragment over a biosensor coated with 600 RU wild-type murine sclerostin. The middle
bars (marked with mScl) show the signal obtained when 300 nM of the respective Fab antibody was perfused in the presence of 600 nM wild-type murine scler-
ostin. As sclerostin shows unspecific binding to the chip surface, the signal from perfusing 600 nM sclerostin without any Fab protein was subtracted from the raw
signal obtained for co-injection of Fab and sclerostin. The right bars (marked with mScl Dloop) show the signal after co-injecting 300 nM Fab in the presence of
600 nM of the variant Scl Dloop, which lacks loop 2. Data processing included subtraction of an injection with 600 nM Scl Dloop to remove the effect of unspecific
binding of sclerostin to the chip surface as stated above. Shown are mean RU values with s.d. from at least eight experiments. Means of the binding signal for
AbD09096 alone and co-injected with sclerostin or the variant mScl Dloop differ significantly ( p , 0.0001), just as do the means of the binding signal for
AbD09097 alone and co-injected with murine sclerostin ( p , 0.0001). Means of AbD09097 alone and co-injected with the variant mScl Dloop do not differ
significantly ( p ¼ 0.1166). Statistical results were obtained with an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.

 epitope and revealed that optimal binding to peptides was
achieved for constructs that terminated at Trp99. Peptides
that included Trp100 or residues even more C-terminal
were bound less avidly. In a third round we then refined the
analysis to determine the optimal motif recognized by
AbD09097. Hereby all residues in the two 14mer peptides
PARLLPNAIGRGKW
and
NAIGRGKWWRPSGP
were
systematically and individually exchanged for all other prot-
einogenic amino acids except Ile. In addition a truncation
series of these peptides was made to analyse the required
length of the recognition motif (electronic supplementary
material, figure S1). As can be seen from figure 5a, changes in
Gly95, Arg96 and Lys98 are not tolerated at all and abrogate
binding of AbD09097 (for an alternative representation of the
data, see electronic supplementary material, figure S2). Trp99
can only be replaced by the aromatic amino acids Phe or Tyr.
Exchanges of Ile94 and Gly97 affect binding to a lesser
degree, but peptides containing Val at position 97 (as occurs
in the murine sequence) are fully bound by AbD09097. These
results are fully consistent with the NMR analysis of
AbD09097. A large set of murine sclerostin variants was then
used in an SPR analysis to study binding and recognition of
the various Fabs in more detail (electronic supplementary
material,
table
S2).
From
16
available
single
mutants,
mutations in three positions decreased binding affinity
(Arg96, Trp99 and Arg101) to AbD09097. All three residues
are also part of the region which has been exchanged in the var-
iants Scl Dloop and Scl Alaloop, which both did not bind
AbD09097 (see above). Furthermore, an intact finger 1 region
seems also important, as binding of the AbD09097 to the var-
iant Scl F1mut, which carries the mutations R56N, E57A,
H59R, T61K, R62K, T65N, R70T and K73Q, was significantly
lower, too. The five other antibodies selected against sclerostin
were similarly tested by SPR. Consistent with our finding that
not one of these variants is neutralizing sclerostin, none was
affected by mutations in loop 2 (electronic supplementary
material, table S2). Additional epitope mapping for some
non-neutralizing Fabs using a similar peptide array as
described above suggested that their epitope is either located
in the N-terminal region (AbD09094, His42–Ala46) or in
the finger 2-region (AbD09096: Gly126–Lys133, AbD09100:
Gly125–Lys141,
AbD09101:
Gly125–Ala138,
AbD09173:
Gln117–Ala128). The fact that the only Fab recognizing an epi-
tope in loop 2 of sclerostin shows good neutralization of Wnt
signalling inhibition underlines the importance of the flexible
loop of sclerostin for its bioactivity.

 3.6. Crystal structure analysis of the neutralizing anti-
sclerostin Fab AbD09097
To get insights into the paratope of a sclerostin-neutralizing
antibody on a molecular level, we determined the structure
of AbD09097 by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of
1.85 A
˚ . The final model consists of residues Asp1 to Ala215
of the light chain and Gln1 to Gly224 of the heavy chain. In
addition, 288 water molecules could be modelled and for five
residues, i.e. Val37 and Glu150 of the heavy chain and Ser22,
Lys104 and Arg143 of the light chain, alternative side chain
conformations could be identified in the electron density
map (figure 6a; for sequence see electronic supplementary
material, figure S3). AbD09097 exhibits a classical Fab architec-
ture with an elbow angle of 1448, the latter of which describes
the orientation between the variable and constant domains by
building pseudo-dyads between VL/VH and CL/CH. For
comparison, the BMPR1a-neutralizing Fab AbD1556 (PDB
entry 3NH7 [52]), which also derives from phage display
screening of the HuCAL GOLD library, has an elbow angle
of 2318. Thus both Fabs can be superimposed only either on
the variable region (RMSD for Ca positions: 1.25 A
˚ ) or the con-
stant region (RMSD for Ca positions: 1.73 A
˚ ; electronic
supplementary material, figure S4). This difference is probably
due to the fact that the light chains of AbD09097 and AbD1556
only share 45% amino acid sequence identity as the AbD09097
light chain belongs to the kappaclass, whereasthat of AbD1556
is a member of the lambda subfamily (electronic supplemen-
tary material, figure S4). Conformingly, another Fab (e.g. a
Fab directed against a K63-linked di-ubiquitin, PDB entry
3DVG [53]), which—like AbD09097—has a kappa light
chain, resembles the same overall architecture as AbD09097
with a similar elbow angle of 1658 (electronic supplementary
material, figure S4).

Figure 5. Peptide replacement array analysis for sclerostin-neutralizing Fabs on all single mutant variants of peptide PARLLPNAIGRGKW representing residues Pro86
to Trp99 of loop 2 of murine sclerostin. The red line represents the mean signal height that is recorded for the base peptide. At each position along the sequence, a
letter representing the substitution is drawn at the height of the signal intensity recorded for that particular substitution. One letter amino acid code was used for all
amino acids except Cys, for which the number 2 was used representing a cysteine protected with acetamidomethyl (ACM) to prevent formation of disulfide bonds.
For all three Fabs, AbD09097 (a), AbD12682 (b) and AbD12683 (c), the first eight residues can be replaced by any other tested amino acid without altering binding
of the peptide. Exchange of the succeeding six amino acids, representing residues Ile94 to Trp99 of sclerostin, similarly but not identically affect binding of the
peptide by the different Fab proteins.

 The high resolution and the unambiguous electron den-
sity enabled a detailed analysis of the CDR loops forming
the sclerostin-binding site. The six CDR loops (figure 6; elec-
tronic supplementary material, figure S3) harbour eight
tyrosines and nine serines (among a total of 60 residues form-
ing the antigen interaction site); two more tyrosine residues
are located within the antigen-binding groove but are not
part of the CDRs. The heaped occurrence of Ser and Tyr in
the antigen-binding groove of AbD09097 is also found with
other antibodies and might be explained with the involve-
ment and importance of both amino acid types in hydrogen
bond and/or hydrophobic interactions through either their
p-electron system and/or hydroxyl group [54,55]. When
using the Chothia nomenclature for CDR classification
[56,57], the light chain CDR2 (length 7aa, Asp50 to Thr56,
Kabat numbering is used throughout [58]) and CDR3 (9aa,
Gln89 to Thr97) both belong to the class 1 (representative
structures are PDBs 1LMK and 1TET, respectively) and the
heavy chain CDR1 (10aa, Gly26 to His35) and CDR2 (17aa,
Thr50 to Gly65) represent class 1 (similar to in PDB entry
2FBJ) and class 3-like (similar to in PDB 1IGC) canonical
CDR loop, respectively (electronic supplementary material,
figure S5). These classifications were confirmed by structural
comparisons using reference Fabs (electronic supplementary
material, figure S5). No grouping could be obtained for
CDR1 of the light chain (length 12aa, Arg24 to Ala34) and
CDR3 of the heavy chain (6aa, Trp95 to Ile102) if the classical
rules of Chothia and co-workers were applied [56,57,59].
Newer antibody analysis tools like the AHo numbering
scheme [60] and the North clustering [61] classify CDR1,
2 and 3 of the AbD09097 light chain to adopt loop architectures
belonging to the L1-12-1, L2-8-1 and the L3-9-cis7-1 clusters,
respectively. According to this analysis tool the three CDRs
of the AbD09097 heavy chain resemble structures found in
the H1-13-1 (CDR1), the H2-10-2 (CDR2) and the H3-8-1
(CDR3) clusters (electronic supplementary material, figure S5).
3.7. Crystal-lattice contacts provide hints for the
sclerostin–Fab AbD09097 interaction
The most prominent feature of the AbD09097 structure is
seen when looking top down onto the CDR loops. The anti-
gen-binding site is built by CDR2 and 3 of the light chain
forming one side and the heavy chain CDRs 1 and 2 sculpting
the other side, thereby creating a deep crevice or pocket
(figure 6b). Two aromatic residues, Tyr94 of CDR3L and
Phe96 in the CDR3H, border the crevice. Tryptophan 95 of
CDR3H and Phe98 at the end of CDR3L form the bottom of
this pocket, which has a length of 12 A
˚ , is about 7 A
˚ wide
and has a depth of 5 A
˚ (figure 6b). Shape and size of this anti-
gen-binding site of AbD09097 shares some similarities with
that of other antibodies recognizing linear peptide motifs,
e.g. Fab 8F5 that binds the rhinovirus capsid protein VP2

 (PDB entry 1A3R, [62]), or Fab fragment 59.1, which interacts
with the third variable loop (V3) of the HIV-1 protein GP120
(PDB entry 1ACY [63]). Our mapping studies indeed indicated
that AbD09097 recognizes a linear peptide, which comprises
residues Leu90 to Asp106 according to NMR chemical shift
mapping (figure 4) and with the peptide array replacement
analysis suggesting Ile94 to Trp99 as the main binding determi-
nants of this peptide motif (figure 5). To our surprise a detailed
analysis of the crystal symmetry then revealed that the crevice-
like antigen-binding site of AbD09097 is already filled with two
peptides originating from a symmetry-related AbD09097 mol-
ecule in the crystal lattice (figure 7; electronic supplementary
material, figure S3c,d).
Most importantly, these two peptides lining the pocket
potentially mimic some of the sclerostin loop 2–Fab inter-
actions. One peptide originates from the C-terminus of the
light chain and consists of residues Asn211 to Ala215
(figure 7b; electronic supplementary material, figure S3). It
shares various van der Waals contacts with CDR3L and
CDR2H and has a buried surface area of about 140 A
˚ 2. It, fur-
thermore, forms two hydrogen bonds, one between the
carboxylate group of Glu214 and the amide of Tyr94 (CDR3L)
and one between the C-terminal carboxylate group of Ala215
and the hydroxyl group of Tyr94 (CDR3L) (figure 7b). The inter-
action of this peptide segment with the antigen-binding site is
complemented by Lys191 from the light chain of the same sym-
metry-related Fab, which engages in a further hydrogen bond
between its side chain amine group and the N-terminal Asp1
of the light chain (figure 7b).
The second peptide occupying the antigen-binding site is
part of the C-terminus of the AbD09097 heavy chain. It car-
ries a 29aa extension harbouring a thrombin cleavage motif,
a myc- and a hexahistidine-tag for detection and purification
purposes (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). It is
important to note that this peptide tag could not be cleaved
off without destroying the high-resolution diffraction proper-
ties of the Fab crystals, highlighting the importance of these
interactions for proper crystal-lattice formation (see also
[49]). On the other hand, gel-filtration of AbD09097 did not
provide hints for oligomer formation in solution suggesting
that the homomeric interactions of AbD09097 with C-term-
inal peptide sequences are weak. The low affinity of this
interaction is probably due to the limited similarity of the
C-terminal tag-derived peptide sequence compared with
the ‘natural’ target sequence in the sclerostin loop 2. Of this
crevice-occupying peptide, residues Ser217 to Phe219 orig-
inate from the Fab heavy chain, and residues Leu220 to
Gly224 are already part of the recognition sequence for
thrombin. This peptide snugly fits into the deep pocket in
the Fab antigen-binding site burying about 470 A

Figure 7. The C-termini of the Fab light and heavy chain potentially mimic the interaction of sclerostin with the Fab AbD09097. (a) Crystal-lattice contacts (the second
Fab molecule is indicated in light grey, being stacked on top of the other Fab molecule) between symmetry-related Fab molecules result in the interaction of the C-
terminus of the light chain (aa N211–A215 and K191) with the CDRs L1, L3, H2 and H3 of the antibody. Similarly, the C-terminus of the heavy chain comprising
mainly the residues of the thrombin cleavage site for the removal of the Myc and hexahistidine-tag (aa S217–G224) interacts with the deep pocket formed by the
CDRs L1, L2, L3, H1 and H3. (b) Magnification (stereo view) of the interaction of the C-terminus of the light chain (carbon atoms coloured in magenta) with the
binding site of the Fab. Selected hydrogen bonds are marked as magenta stippled lines. Residues of the light chain are coloured in dark green and labels contain a
subscript L. Residues of the heavy chain are coloured in green and labels contain a subscript H. Numbering of the residues located in the CDRs follows the rules of
Kabat. (c) As in (b) but rotated around the y-axis by 1808 to show the interaction of the C-terminus of the heavy chain (carbon atoms coloured in cyan) with the

hydrogen bonds emanating from its main and side chain atoms to residues Y36 and D50 of the light chain and F96 and D101 of the heavy chain.

 area (figure 7c). Whereas Ser217 and Glu218 make few van
der Waals contacts with CDR1H, Phe219 deeply penetrates
into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Tyr33 and His35
(CDR1H), Tyr91, Tyr94, and Ile96 (CDR3L) and Trp95
(CDR3H). Leu220, the first residue of the thrombin cleavage
motif, also engages in hydrophobic interactions with Tyr94
and Ile96 of CDR3L. The succeeding Val221 and Pro222
bulge out of the crevice and thus share only little contact
with the CDR1L of AbD09097. By contrast, the side chain of
Arg223 deeply immerses into the pocket with its guanidi-
nium group forming a tri-dentate hydrogen bond with the
carbonyl of Phe96, the carboxylate group of Asp101 of
CDR3H and the hydroxyl group of Tyr36 C-terminal of
CDR1L. In addition, the backbone amide of the arginine resi-
due is fixed to Asp50 of CDR2L by two hydrogen bonds. The
multiple hydrogen bonds and the large surface area buried
upon complex formation suggest that the arginine and the
preceding
phenylalanine are
key
binding
elements
for
motifs recognized by AbD09097 and they might be also pre-
sent in a similar arrangement in loop 2 of sclerostin
recognized by the neutralizing Fab. Our peptide array repla-
cement study indeed indicated that a rather short peptide
comprising residues Ile94 to Trp99 of sclerostin harbours
the key motif for binding to AbD09097 (figure 5). Together
with the notion that AbD09097 binds murine sclerostin
with higher affinity than the human protein and the fact
that the only difference within the motif IGRVKW is a Gly-
to-Val exchange, this suggests that a potential minimal
sequence motif for binding of sclerostin to AbD09097 is
(hydrophobic-G)-R-hydrophobic-K-aromatic. This also prob-
ably explains how AbD09097 neutralizes sclerostin activity,
as sclerostin’s key determinant for binding to the Wnt co-recep-
tor LRP5/6 is the NXI-motif, which just precedes the antibody
recognition motif. Thus binding of sclerostin to the antibody
competes with its capability to bind to LRP5/6 and, therefore,
the neutralizing antibody releases LRP5/6 from a complex
with sclerostin thereby rescuing Wnt signalling.
3.8. Affinity maturation of the sclerostin-neutralizing
antibody AbD09097
AbD09097 efficiently neutralized sclerostin activity in differ-
ent cellular assays [36,64], but was more effective on
murine than on human sclerostin. This correlates with the
more than fivefold higher binding affinity of AbD09097 for
the murine isoform. Fusing two AbD09097 Fabs into the
bivalent Fab AbD12533 (dimerized using a helix-turn-helix
motif, [65]) strongly increased the binding affinity also for
the human isoform in our in vitro SPR analyses (table 2).
However, this increase is likely to be biased by artificial avid-
ity effects, which are due to the specific SPR set-up using
sclerostin as immobilized ligand and perfusing the antibody
proteins as analytes.
Therefore, to obtain a neutralizing antibody with improved
affinity for human sclerostin we applied affinity maturation to
AbD09097 employing an alternative panning strategy. As the
heavy and the light chain CDR3 loops form the most inner
part of the antigen-binding groove (figure 6b), they are most
important for binding affinity and are thus the prime target
for affinity maturation approaches. The HuCAL GOLD
phage library was generated with all six CDRs being diversi-
fied to ensure a large antibody repertoire, but special
emphasis was directed on diversification of the heavy chain
CDR3. This suggests that HuCAL GOLD-derived antibodies
have rather ‘optimal’ CDR3H sequences. For affinity matu-
ration, we thus targeted CDR3L by replacing the original
CDR3L with a highly diverse cassette to select Fabs with
CDR3H of the ancestor AbD09097 but having newly selected
loops for CDR3L. This targeted library was then subjected to
a solution panning using decreasing amounts of biotinylated
human sclerostin and more stringent washing to ensure selec-
tion of high-affinity binders. From more than 100 hits obtained
in ELISA, the 20 clones with the highest signal were sequenced
and seven unique new antibodies (AbD12681–AbD12687)
were obtained. In ELISA, all seven Fabs bound both human
and murine sclerostin with a good signal (table 2). SPR analysis
showed that for five Fabs the affinity to human sclerostin was
improved fivefold or better (table 2). In contrast with the sig-
nificant affinity enhancement for human sclerostin, binding
to murine sclerostin either improved only marginally, with
three Fabs (e.g. AbD12681, 12682 and 12684) showing
an increase in affinity of threefold or less and two Fabs,
AbD12685 and 12687, even binding less tightly to murine scler-
ostin when compared with their ancestor AbD09097 (table 2).
Only two Fabs, AbD12683 and 12686, bound murine sclerostin
with strongly increased affinities (46- and 15-fold, table 2),
indicating that optimizing CDR3L sequences using human
sclerostin during selection can also benefit binding and recog-
nition of the murine isoform. Most importantly, of the seven
new Fabs, three antibodies (AbD12681, 12682, 12684) exhibit
not only improved affinities for human sclerostin (4- to
11-fold) but also have a strongly reduced preference (calculated
from KhScl:
D
=KmScl:
D
) for murine sclerostin, which decreased from
sixfold of the ancestor AbD09097 to twofold or less (table 2).
Thus, these three antibodies bind murine and human sclerostin
in a non-discriminatory manner and might, therefore, neutral-
ize both sclerostin isoforms with similar efficacy. With
AbD12685 a Fab was obtained that binds murine sclerostin
with lower affinity than its ancestor AbD09097 and at the
same time exhibits an increased affinity for human sclerostin.
Thus, this Fab binds preferentially the human isoform. From
this data, it seems that the set of affinity-maturated Fabs
AbD12681–AbD12687 can be grouped into two classes: one
group (group 1) consisting of AbD12681, 12682, 12684 and
12685, binds both isoforms, murine and human sclerostin, in a
non-discriminatory manner or even with preference for the
human
isoform;
the
second
class
(group
2)
comprises
AbD12683 and 12686 and still strongly favours murine over
human sclerostin like the ancestor Fab AbD09097.
To get insights into how the changes in CDR3L altered
recognition of the sclerostin epitope, we first performed
SPR analyses using our set of sclerostin variants (electronic

 Table 2. Affinity maturation of the Fab AbD09097. Analysis of Fab antibodies derived from affinity maturation of the ancestor Fab AbD09097. The Fab AbD12533 is a bivalent AbD09097, in which two AbD09097 were fused by a helix-
turn-helix motif [65]. Fab specificity was screened using an ELISA employing a panel of control proteins, and murine and human sclerostin. The numbers represent signal/noise ratios (fold background). The binding affinity of these Fabs
were determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), KD values and kinetic parameters were obtained using a set-up with the Fab antibody proteins as analytes (six different concentrations) and human and murine sclerostin as
immobilized ligand. Fold change represents the affinity enhancement compared with the binding affinity of the ancestor Fab AbD09097. Species-specificity was calculated from KhSclerostin

 sclerostin loop 2 epitope. Thus, we applied a peptide replace-
ment and truncation array analysis for the Fabs AbD12682,
representing the group 1 Fabs, and AbD12683, as a member
of group 2 Fabs (figure 5; electronic supplementary material,
figure S1). Here peptide variant mimicking residues Pro85 to
Trp99 of sclerostin were prepared with each residue of the
peptide replaced by all other proteinogenic amino acids
except Ile. The results suggest that the core epitope recog-
nized by affinity-maturated Fabs is possibly smaller as
mutation of Ile94 affects binding less than AbD09097. Similarly
Gly95, which was insignificant for high-affinity binding to
AbD09097, can be replaced by other amino acid types without
fully abrogating binding. Two positions, however, support the
above classification for the affinity-maturated Fabs into two
classes: with AbD09097 and AbD12683, replacement of the
Arg96-equivalent residue in the peptide is detrimental to bind-
ing, whereas AbD12682 seem to tolerate exchange to non-
acidic amino acids without completely losing binding affinity.
Lys98 was also essential for binding to AbD09097; with
AbD12683 exchange of this lysine for amino acids other than
alanine leads to a complete loss of binding. With AbD12682,
on the other hand, many amino acid types seem to decrease
binding
only
to
a
minor
degree.
The
hypothesis that
AbD12683/group 2 Fabs and AbD09097 share a similar recog-
nition mechanism while the binding of group 1 Fabs (as
represented by AbD12682) diverged further from the ancestor
AbD09097 is even more evident from the peptide truncation
array analysis (electronic supplementary material, figure S1).
Here, the binding of AbD09097 and AbD12683 to the loop 2
mimicking peptide is almost completely lost upon any C-term-
inal truncation of the 14mer peptide, indicating the importance
of Trp99 in the recognition motif. By contrast, both Fabs toler-
ate removal of the N-terminal residues up to Ala93. AbD12682
instead does still bind peptides in which Gly97 to Trp99 were
removed with moderate affinity, albeit high affinity binding
requires peptides with
similar sequence and length to
AbD09097 and AbD12683.
With the data of the mapping study of the affinity-matu-
rated Fabs and the crystal structure of AbD09097 with two
sclerostin-mimicking peptides in the antigen-binding site at
hand (figure 7b,c), we could build a molecular model showing
how sclerostin potentially binds to the neutralizing Fabs. Here
loop 2 binds along the crevice of Fab AbD09097 with Arg96
occupying the same deep cleft formed by CDR3H and
CDR2L and engaging in similar hydrogen bonds with
Asp101CDR3H and Tyr36CDR2L as the Arg223 residue in the
C-terminus of the symmetry-related Fab moiety (figure 8).
Trp99 is also buried inside the cleft forming hydrophobic inter-
actions with Tyr33 and His35 of CDR1H and Tyr91 of CDR3L
similar to the symmetry-related Phe219 as seen in the crystal
structure (figure 8). The main difference between the peptide
in the crystal structure and the peptide in the sclerostin–
AbD09097 complex model is that the direction of the peptide
backbone had to be reversed. In the current model, Lys98
and Trp100 of the loop 2 are both located outside the anti-
gen-binding crevice, with Lys98 potentially interacting with

 Glu32 of CDR1L via a saltbridge. The different impact of the
R101A mutation on binding seen for the ancestor AbD09097
and
the
affinity-maturated
Fabs
strongly
suggests
that
Arg101 is placed on top of CDR3L where it might interact
with Asp1 of the light chain. Owing to the different length
and amino acid composition of CDR3L this interaction might
be disrupted in the affinity-maturated Fabs thereby explaining
why Arg101 is not required for high-affinity binding to these
Fabs (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). However,
for a detailed structure–function analysis an experimental
structure of sclerostin or a sclerostin-derived peptide bound
to AbD09097 is needed in the future.
4. Discussion
New therapy concepts for bone-eroding diseases such as osteo-
porosis attempt to restore bone density rather than only
impeding further resorption, which is the mechanism of
action for classical osteoporosis drugs such as bisphosphonates
[66]. Two new key targets that may allow for a bone restoration
have been identified, the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ligand
RANKL and the Wnt antagonist sclerostin [67]. RANKL is
associated with osteoclastogenesis and its expression can lead
to bone loss (for review, see [68]). Conformingly, a neutralizing
anti-RANKL antibody (denosumab) showed bone-restoring
properties and was approved for treatment of osteoporosis in
mid-2010 [69]. Sclerostin was initially discovered from diseases
with a bone-overgrowth phenotype, sclerosteosis and the van
Buchem disease [8,70]. Here lack of sclerostin leads to osteope-
trosis indicating that it is a negative regulator of bone growth.
Various studies have shown that it inhibits the Wnt/b-catenin
signalling pathway [11,12,71,72]. By binding to the Wnt co-
receptor LRP5/6 ectodomain, it competes with Wnt ligands,
which signal via complex formation with LRP5/6 and recep-
tors
of
the
Frizzled
family.
Structure–function
studies
identified loop 2 of sclerostin as the key binding determinant
for LRP5/6 [36,37,41]. Therefore, antibodies targeting the
LRP5/6 binding motif in the second loop of sclerostin should
potentially be neutralizing with respect to sclerostin-mediated
Wnt inhibition.
For functional studies, we generated Fab antibodies against
sclerostin and investigated their properties using biochemical
and cell-based assays. From the 11 Fab antibodies initially
obtained, a reportergene-based cellular assay with Wnt1 as
stimulant identified one Fab (AbD09097) to effectively neutral-
ize sclerostin thereby rescuing sclerostin-attenuated Wnt1
activity [64]. Epitope mapping revealed that AbD09097 recog-
nizes loop 2 of sclerostin and blocks access to the NXI-motif, the
latter of which is required for binding to LRP6 [36,37,41]. Thus,
neutralization by AbD09097 seems simply due to competing
off an antagonist (sclerostin), which competes with Wnt factors
for binding to a receptor (LRP5/6). Consistent with the above
mechanism, Fabs that bound to either N- or C-terminus or
within finger 1 and/or 2 did not neutralize sclerostin-mediated
Wnt1 inhibition.
Analysis of crystal-lattice contacts in the crystal structure of
AbD09097 provided first hints into how this Fab recognizes
and binds loop 2 of sclerostin and how this interaction blocks
sclerostin from binding to the Wnt co-receptor LRP6. A short
segment at the C-terminus of the Fab heavy chain, which is
part of a thrombin protease recognition site (-FLVPR�GS-)
and which was required to obtain X-ray diffracting crystals
[49], filled the antigen-binding crevice of the Fab potentially
mimicking sclerostin-AbD09097 key interactions. Namely, the
phenylalanine and arginine residue of the above sequence
engage in intimate contacts with the antigen-binding cleft.
The phenylalanine shares hydrophobic and pp-stacking inter-
actions with aromatic residues in CDR1H and CDR3L, and the
arginine forms multiple hydrogen bonds with a buried Asp
and Tyr residue in CDR3H and CDR2L, respectively. Despite
the high resolution of 1.85 A
˚ , which allowed identification of
more than 280 water molecules around the protein, no water
was observed inside the peptide–Fab interface and this lack
of polar solvent molecules probably strengthens the inter-
molecular polar and hydrophobic interactions. The apparent
similarity of this peptide with the sclerostin epitope for
AbD09097 as derived from our various mapping studies
allowed building a model for the sclerostin–AbD09097 inter-
action. Data from affinity maturation of AbD09097 helped to
orient the loop 2 of sclerostin within the antigen crevice. As
only CDR3L changed during maturation and the contribution
of Arg101 to binding was markedly altered during this process,
Arg101 is very likely located at or close to CDR3L thus requir-
ing Arg96 and Trp99, the two other residues essential for
binding to AbD09097, to be located in the deep cleft formed
by CDR1 and 3 of the heavy chain and CDR2 of the light
chain (figure 8).
With this model and the sequences of CDR3L (electronic
supplementary material, figure S6a) of the newly selected
Fabs, we are able to propose molecular mechanisms explain-
ing affinity maturation of AbD09097. The CDR3L loop of the
ancestor AbD09097 has the sequence QQYYSYPI, of which
only the first Gln, the first Tyr and the sequence YPI face
the inside of the peptide-binding crevice, suggesting that
exchange of the other loop residues might not alter sclerostin
binding. However, while the second glutamine does not face
the peptide, it very likely is, nevertheless, essential for scler-
ostin binding, as it imprints and stabilizes the backbone
conformation of CDR3L via four hydrogen bonds. In a similar
manner the first tyrosine of this 8mer sequence also engages
in hydrogen bonds with residues of CDR2L thereby forming
a defined loop structure in CDR2L. The C-terminal sequence
YPI lines the ‘end’ of the peptide-binding crevice representing
a hydrophobic levee at the end of the deep cleft. To adopt the
required turn conformation the proline residue is configured
with a cis-peptide bond. When now comparing the alterna-
tive
CDR3L
sequences
of
the
seven
affinity-maturated
AbD09097
descendants,
all
seven
sequences,
therefore,
share the double glutamine sequence, six out of seven have
the proline–isoleucine motif and five also carry either a tyro-
sine or a phenylalanine residue ahead of the -PI- motif.
Modelling of AbD12681, 12682 and 12684 suggests that all
three Fabs have an identical peptide-binding crevice sharing
a consensus motif -QQDXXFPI- in which the residues X are
either a histidine, glutamate, valine or serine (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S6a,b). This similarity is reflected
in rather similar binding properties. All three Fabs do not dis-
criminate between the murine and human isoform (i.e. the
affinity difference is 2 or less) and bind murine and human
sclerostin with affinities of about 15–35 nM and 25–65 nM
(table 2). The commonalities of all three Fabs are the exchange
of the first tyrosine against an aspartate and the replacement of
the tyrosine of the YPI-motif with a phenylalanine. Whereas
the latter exchange slightly enlarges the hydrophobic pocket
to possibly better accommodate Trp99 (figure 8), exchange

 of tyrosine against aspartate firstly provides CDR2L with
increased flexibility due to a loss of the fixating hydrogen
bonds emanating from the tyrosine hydroxyl group and
secondly adds an additional negative charge at the bottom
of the deep cleft, which very likely houses Arg96 (figure 8; elec-
tronic supplementary material, figure S6b). In this context, it is
important to note that the affinity enhancement of these three
Fabs is rather due to an increased association rate (approx.
four- to fivefold), whereas the slowdown in dissociation,
usually the driver in affinity maturation, is only approximately
two- to threefold. The binding of sclerostin to the ancestor
Fab AbD09097 is characterized by a quite slow association
(kon 4 � 103 M21 s21) and a slow dissociation (koff 1 �
1024 s21) indicating that affinity is limited more by the rate of
complex formation rather than the complex stability. Thus,
widening of the binding cleft and placement of an additional
negative charge to foster the fixation of Arg96 in the deep
pocket might very well speed up the interaction thereby enhan-
cing affinity by facilitating complex formation instead of
contributing to complex stability. The non-discriminatory
binding to murine and human sclerostin found for these
three Fabs might also be associated with the Tyr-to-Asp
mutation in the CDR3L. The only difference in the Fab-binding
motif in loop 2 between murine and human sclerostin is the
exchange of Gly97 for valine. The removal of the conformation-
al fixation of CDR3L by the Tyr-to-Asp exchange (see above)
provides more flexibility to the binding pocket to better accom-
modate the human loop peptide segment (figure 8; electronic
supplementary material, figure S6). The latter is more rigid as
the valine residue cannot adopt backbone conformations
amenable to glycine. Consistent with this hypothesis, the two
affinity-maturated Fabs that exhibit an even higher preference
for murine sclerostin, AbD12683 and 12686, both carry a tyro-
sine at position 3 of CDR3L. The molecular reason why both
Fabs have, nevertheless, a 15- to 40-fold higher affinity than
the ancestor AbD09097 although the N-terminal loop sequence
is unaltered might be in the change of the YPI-motif at the
C-terminus end of CDR3L. But as both Fabs have rather
different amino acid sequences, experimental structures of
either one of both Fabs or AbD09097 in complex with a loop
2-derived peptide are necessary to understand the details of
sclerostin recognition by this set of neutralizing Fabs.
5. Conclusion
In summary, the Fab antibodies obtained and characterized
in this study provide a new and valuable tool set for studying
the molecular mechanism of sclerostin. Among those, the
sclerostin-neutralizing Fab AbD09097 (available as a full-
length IgG as HCA230Z from AbD Serotec) or its affinity-
maturated descendants might present the most interesting
antibodies. Their high efficiency to block sclerostin might
facilitate the development of new drugs targeting diseases
characterized by bone loss such as osteoporosis.
