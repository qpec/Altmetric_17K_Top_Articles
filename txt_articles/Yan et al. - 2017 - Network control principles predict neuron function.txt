Abstract
Recent studies on the controllability of complex systems offer a powerful mathematical framework 
to systematically explore the structure-function relationship in biological, social and technological 
networks1–3. Despite theoretical advances, we lack direct experimental proof of the validity of 
these widely used control principles. Here we fill this gap by applying a control framework to the 
connectome of the nematode C. elegans4–6, allowing us to predict the involvement of each C. 
elegans neuron in locomotor behaviours. We predict that control of the muscles or motor neurons 
requires twelve neuronal classes, which include neuronal groups previously implicated in 
locomotion by laser ablation7–13, as well as one previously uncharacterised neuron, PDB. We

 validate this prediction experimentally, finding that the ablation of PDB leads to a significant loss 
of dorsoventral polarity in large body bends. Importantly, control principles also allow us to 
investigate the involvement of individual neurons within each neuronal class. For example, we 
predict that, within the class of DD motor neurons, only three (DD04, DD05, or DD06) should 
affect locomotion when ablated individually. This prediction is also confirmed, with single-cell 
ablations of DD04 or DD05, but not DD02 or DD03, specifically affecting posterior body 
movements. Our predictions are robust to deletions of weak connections, missing connections, and 
rewired connections in the current connectome, indicating the potential applicability of this 
analytical framework to larger and less well-characterised connectomes.
Control theory probes a system’s ability to drive its output towards a desired outcome 
through the application of suitable input signals to selected driver nodes3. With a 
connectome featuring well-defined input nodes, and experimentally testable behavioural 
responses acting as outputs, the nematode worm C. elegans provides an ideal test-bed for 
network control principles. For example, C. elegans responds to anterior (posterior) gentle 
body touch with backward (forward) locomotion. It senses touch via the sensory neurons 
ALM, AVM and PLM, which serve as input nodes (Fig. 1a), processing this information 
through a network of 279 nonpharyngeal neurons connected by 2,194 directed synaptic 
connections and 1,028 reciprocal gap junctions. Of these, 124 motor neurons connect to 95 
muscles via 552 neuromuscular junctions, inducing the experimentally observable 
locomotive patterns. To date C. elegans is the only organism for which the wiring diagram of 
its complete nervous system has been mapped with reasonable accuracy at the cellular 
level4–6. Despite this structural information, available for decades, it has proven difficult to 
systematically predict the functional involvement of specific neurons in defined behavioural 
responses.
From a network perspective, if the removal of a neuron physically disconnects one or more 
muscles from the input, its effect on locomotion is self-evident. Yet, given the dense wiring 
of the C. elegans connectome (Fig. 1c, ED Fig. 1), no single neuron class ablation can 
disconnect the pathways between touch sensory receptors and muscles in the adult worm 
(see SI Sec. II B). Consequently, straightforward connectivity analyses cannot reveal the 
involvement of individual neurons in locomotion. Prompted by this failure, we hypothesised 
that neurons whose absence alters the controllability of specific groups of muscles would 
lead to changes in locomotion patterns when ablated in vivo. We then applied network 
control principles to this connectome, expecting to reveal both neurons with known 
importance to locomotion, as well as neurons whose involvement in locomotion was 
previously unknown, hence offering novel, experimentally testable predictions.
We model the nematode nervous system as a directed network whose nodes include neurons 
and muscles, and whose links represent the electrical and chemical synaptic connections 
between them, including neuromuscular junctions. Formally, the dynamics of the system 
composed of N neurons and M muscles is described by

 corresponds to the adjacency matrix of the connectome, with non-zero 
elements Aii that represent the nodal dynamics of node i; the input matrix 
represents the receptor neurons on which the external signals are imposed, e.g. ALML/R and 
AVM for anterior gentle touch; and the vector y(t), selected by the output matrix C, 
represents the states of the M muscle cells. In other words, the response of C. elegans to 
external stimuli can be formalised as a target control problem14, asking if the inputs 
received by receptors in B can control the state of the muscles listed in C. The muscles are 
controllable if, with a suitable choice of inputs u(t), they can move in any desired manner, 
i.e. y(t) can reach an arbitrary position of the M-dimensional state space15. The nonlinearity 
of system (1) must be considered if we want to find out how to control the muscles. Here, 
however, we ask which neurons are necessary for control, which is defined by the 
controllability of the linearised system (2). Indeed, if (2) is locally controllable along a 
specific trajectory in state space, then the original nonlinear system (1) is also controllable 
along the same trajectory15. Furthermore, linear controllability predictions are consistent 
with simulations of neuronal networks with nonlinear dynamics16,17.
To understand how control considerations differ from simple connectivity-based predictions, 
consider Fig. 2a, exploring whether nodes 2 and 3 can be controlled by a signal applied to 
node 1. Topologically the system appears controllable, as the signal can reach all nodes. Yet, 
the classic Kalman condition18 tells us that the responses of nodes 2 and 3 to this signal are 
always correlated, hence we cannot control them independently, making the system as a 
whole uncontrollable. To gain full control over all three nodes, we need to apply one 
additional control signal to node 2 or 3 (Fig. 2b). We encounter the same situation when m 
independent signals aim to control k nodes, a configuration that is controllable only if m ≤ k 
(Figs. 2c, d). In a similar spirit, we derive the criterion for muscle controllability and apply it 
to analyse the C. elegans nervous system (SI Sec. II B, ED Fig. 2).
Here, we applied this network control framework to predict which neurons are critical in the 
response to gentle touch, in the sense that their removal (ablation) would decrease the 
number of controllable muscles. We found that even in the intact worm, only 89 of the 95 
muscles are independently controllable. We then explored the impact of ablating each of the 
103 classes (see SI Sec. I B for neuron classification) individually. We found that the 
removal of the vast majority of neuron classes had no impact on muscle controllability. Our

 initial analysis did identify, however, nine classes predicted to affect muscle control: the 
seven major classes of motor neurons (DA, DB, DD, VA, VB, VD, and AS), and the 
premotor interneuron AVA (Table 1; see also ED Figs. 3-5). Each of these classes has been 
previously implicated, through genetic, neuroimaging, optogenetic, and cell ablation 
experiments, in the direct control of the body neuromusculature (see SI Sec. III A).
Interestingly, control analysis also predicted locomotor defects following the ablation of a 
ninth neuron, PDB, not previously implicated in locomotion. As shown in Fig. 2e, while 
PDB directly connects to muscles MVR21 and MVL22, it apparently plays no key 
topological role as in its absence the signal transmitted by the receptor neurons of anterior 
gentle touch, AVM and ALML/R, can still reach all muscles. However, from a control 
perspective, we expect that the ablation of PDB should affect worm locomotion (see Fig. 2e 
for a full explanation). Since ablation experiments for PDB have not previously been 
reported, this prediction offers the first direct, falsifiable experimental test of the network 
control framework.
Most existing results on neuron ablation remove all members of a neuron class 
simultaneously7,10–12, but control principles can go further, predicting which of the 
individual neurons are responsible for the loss of control. To show this we applied (2) to 
each individual neuron within the DD class. Intriguingly, we found that the individual 
ablation of DD01, DD02, or DD03 did not alter the controllability of the muscles, but DD04, 
DD05, and DD06 did (Fig. 3a). This result was unexpected, because the general pattern of 
connectivity is thought to be similar among the DD class. Nevertheless, we predict that the 
individual ablation of DD04, DD05, or DD06 should be sufficient to impair C. elegans 
locomotion, offering a second set of specific, unanticipated and falsifiable predictions, now 
regarding the functional differences between individual neurons within a class.
To test the validity of our two sets of predictions, we performed laser ablation of individual 
neurons9 and analysed the spontaneous locomotor behaviour of freely-moving worms on 
food (see https://figshare.com/s/72716a92be1ab0f1e1d4 for complete data19). We used an 
automated tracking system20 to compare the locomotion pattern of PDB- and DDs-ablated 
animals with mock-ablated worms, focusing on four fundamental components of worm body 
morphology known as eigenworms, which provide a low-dimensional but relatively 
complete description of C. elegans body postures21. Under our recording conditions, the 
first eigenprojection represents a large body bend, the second and third represent 
components of the sinusoidal traveling wave that drives crawling movement, and the fourth 
represents small movements at the head and tail22.
We first tested the effect of ablating the PDB neuron on locomotion. We observed that PDB-
ablated animals showed significant and reproducible abnormalities in parameters related to 
the first eigenprojection (EP1; Fig. 2f; SI Table II; ED Fig. 6a) compared to mock-ablated 
animals of the same genotype. Specifically, ablated animals showed a higher incidence of 
highly negative EP1 values, which correlate with deep bends on the dorsal side of the body. 
Since large bends, or omega turns, are strongly biased to the ventral side in normal 
worms23,24, this suggested a loss of ventral bias in PDB-ablated animals. Indeed, we 
observed that PDB-ablated animals showed a significantly lower frequency of ventral omega

 turns (63.8% vs 81.9% for control; n>125, p<.0005 by two-tailed z-test; see SI Table III) 
compared to mock-ablated animals. These results are consistent with our prediction that 
PDB is essential for the control of the body neuromusculature.
We next tested the effects of ablating individual DD neurons on locomotor control. As 
predicted, ablations of DD02 showed no significant abnormalities in locomotion compared 
to mock ablated animals. In contrast, we found that DD05-ablated worms showed 
significantly lower absolute values for the fourth eigenworm (EP4) during forward 
movement (Figs. 3b-c; SI Table I; ED Fig. 6b), correlating with a reduction in tail movement 
during forward locomotion. A similar effect on EP4 parameters was observed for DD04- but 
not DD03-ablated worms, consistent with DD04 and DD05 specifically affecting control of 
posterior body muscles. Taken together the results of the PDB and DD ablations support our 
starting hypothesis that control principles can accurately identify individual neurons with 
key roles in the coordination of locomotion.
Motor neurons, which directly connect to muscle cells, play a unique role in transmitting 
motor commands to muscles. Our previous analysis focused on muscle control, allowing the 
motor neurons to be in arbitrary dynamical states, some of which may not be biologically 
realistic. We therefore refined our analysis to identify neurons required to preserve the 
controllability of motor neurons. This control analysis predicts that AVB, AVD, and PVC are 
also crucial for locomotion (see SI Sec. II B); the ablation of these neurons has been shown 
previously to profoundly disrupt forward movement7,8,10 or the response to gentle touch7 
(Table 1). Thus, using motorneurons as targets for controllability led to a more complete set 
of predictions for the analysis of locomotor control.
The accuracy of the C. elegans connectome data is affected by a number of factors including 
human errors during mapping and synapse identification and the small number of animals 
reconstructed (only two), prompting us to explore the robustness of our predictions. ED 
Figure 7 shows the probability that a given neuron class, predicted to be essential for 
locomotion based on the current dataset, remains essential after randomly deleting weak 
links, adding links and rewiring the existing links between neurons (see SI Sec. IV A for 
details). We find that the predictions for PDB, DA, DB, DD, VA, VB, VD, and AS are 
robust, remaining significant as we progressively alter as many as 100 links between 
neurons. The least robust prediction is for AVA, whose probability of being involved in 
control decreases with link addition/rewiring.
In summary, our ability to predict the importance of individual neurons in C. elegans 
locomotion shows that control principles offer a novel way to unveil how the connectome 
structure affects its function (see Fig. 1b ED Figs. 8-10). In doing so, we provide the first 
experimental evidence for the relevance of control principles to the properties of real-world 
complex systems.
Our results raise several open questions and opportunities for future work. For example, the 
control principles of two distinct behaviours described by the same sets of input and output 
nodes cannot be distinguished based on the connectome alone. However, if accurate link 
weights or activity patterns can be experimentally determined, the control framework can

 predict control energy and control time25,26 and ultimately tease apart involvement of 
network components when the input and output nodes are indistinguishable. It is also 
theoretically possible to adapt our tools to temporally varying sensory inputs and 
behavioural responses invoking a framework to control temporal networks27–29. Finally, 
since meaningful predictions can be made despite some degree of uncertainty or 
incompleteness on the underlying connectome, we expect that the control framework 
introduced here is applicable to other neural wiring diagrams. Consequently, advances in 
mapping the Drosophila brain and other larger connectomes will yield unprecedented 
opportunities for deepening our understanding of both control principles and the 
mechanisms driving the function and activity of nervous systems.

 Figure 1. Controlling the C. elegans neural network.
(a) Schematic neural circuit for locomotor response to gentle touch in C. elegans (adapted 
after Ref. 30; see SI Sec. III A). (b) Graphical representation of the proposed control 
framework. According to the principles illustrated in Fig. 2(a-d), if removal of a neuron 
disrupts controllability of the muscles, we designate it “essential” for locomotion; if not, we 
call it “non-essential”. To make this assessment, we first mapped the C. elegans responsive 
locomotor behaviours into a target network control problem, asking to what degree the 
sensory neurons (blue) can control the muscles (pink). This allowed us to predict the 
previously-unknown involvement of PDB in C.elegans locomotion, and functional 
differences between individual neurons within the DD neuronal class. (c) The C. elegans 
connectome used in our study, consisting of 279 neurons (the 282 nonpharyngeal neurons, 
excluding CANL/R and VC06 which do not make connections with the rest of the network) 
and 95 muscles. Node size is proportional to the sum of its in- and out- degrees. Filled nodes 
represent the neurons traditionally assigned to the circuits responsible for gentle touch 
response, hinting at the complexity of predicting neuronal function from the wiring diagram 
alone.

 Figure 2. Novel prediction and experimental confirmation of PDB involvement in locomotion.
(a) According to control theory, nodes 2 and 3 (pink) cannot be controlled by a single signal 
u1(t). By Eq. (2), the time evolution of x2(t) of and x3(t) follows a31ẋ2(t) = a31ẋ3(t), hence 
no signal u1(t) is able to control x2(t) and x3(t) independently of each other. To 
independently control nodes 2 and 3, we need two input signals, as shown in (b). Similarly, 
when m independent signals aim to control k nodes connected to them, as shown in (c), the 
pink nodes are not controllable unless m ≥ k, which is the case shown in (d). (e) To explore 
the control role of PDB, we show the paths through which control signals can pass from

 receptor neurons (blue) to downstream muscles (pink). Control analysis finds that the five 
motor neurons, {VB11, VD13, PDB, VA12, VD12}, receive independent signals from 
{ALML, ALMR, AVM} (see SI Sec. II B). According to the principle illustrated in (c), in 
the intact worm, five of the seven muscles are independently controllable. When PDB is 
ablated, control signals can still reach all seven muscles, but the ablation of PDB forces the 
signal through only four neurons, reducing the number of independently controllable 
muscles from five to four. (f) Experimental validation of the involvement of PDB in 
locomotion. N = 43 PDB ablations were tested in the same experiment together with n = 35 
mock-ablated controls. Error bars indicate mean ± standard deviation. Ablation of PDB 
resulted in significant abnormalities in Eigen Projection 1 features and a loss of ventral bias 
to deep body bends (SI Table III). Statistical test: multiple t-tests, significance level = 0.05, 
n.s. = not significant. See SI Sec. III B for experimental details of laser ablations, subsequent 
data analysis and exact p-values.

 Figure 3. Novel prediction and experimental confirmation for the effect of individual DD neurons 
on locomotion.
(a) To explore the control role of the DD neuronal class, comprising six neurons (DD01-
DD06), we show the paths through which control signals can pass from the receptor neurons 
to the 31 muscles. Right bottom corner (yellow highlight): In the intact adult, the 13 motor 
neurons that directly connect to the 15 muscles receive independent signals from PLML/R 
(see SI Sec. II B). Hence, according to the control principle of Fig. 2c, 13 of the 15 muscles 
are independently controllable. When DD04, DD05, or DD06 is ablated, the number of

 controllable muscles decreases to 12, suggesting that DD04, DD05, and DD06 are 
individually indispensable for locomotion. Left bottom corner (blue highlight): Control 
signals to the 16 muscles go through 27 neurons. When DD01, DD02, or DD03 is ablated, 
according to the principle in Fig. 2d the 26 remaining neurons are still able to independently 
control all 16 muscles, predicting that DD01, DD02 and DD03 are individually inessential 
for locomotion. (b,c) Experimental validation. Individual ablation of DD04 or DD05, but not 
DD02 or DD03, affected the worm posture as indicated by statistically different Eigen 
Projection 4 features. DD02 (n=52) and DD05 (n=48) ablations were tested in the same 
experiment together with mock-ablated controls (n=58). DD03 (n=21) and DD04 (n=18) 
ablations were tested together in a separate experiment with new mock-ablated controls 
(n=23). Error bars indicate mean ± standard deviation. Statistical test: multiple t-tests, 
significance level = 0.05, n.s. = not significant.
