Abstract
Background: some centenarians are engaged in regular physical activity and sometimes in sporting events.
Objective: we aimed to identify world records of centenarian athletes in several sports and determine which represented
the best performance when compared to all-age world records, all disciplines taken together.
Methods: all of the best performances achieved by centenarians were identified and compared in three disciplines: athletics,
swimming and cycling. The performances were considered as an average of the respective speeds, except for jumping and
throwing events for which the maximum distances performed were considered. Within each discipline, the decline in per-
formance of centenarian athletes was expressed as a percentage of the world record for that discipline. In total, 60 perfor-
mances of centenarian athletes were found. These performances belong to 19 individuals: 10 in athletics, 8 in swimming
and 1 in cycling.
Results: the centenarian world record performed by Robert Marchand in one hour track cycling appears to be the best per-
formance (−50.6% compared with the all-age world record in this discipline) achieved by a centenarian.
Conclusions: although the physiological characteristics of Robert Marchand are certainly exceptional, his remarkable per-
formance could also be due to the lower age-related decline for cycling performances compared with running and swim-
ming. Our observations offer new perspectives on how the human body can resist the deleterious effects of ageing.

Introduction
Centenarians that were themselves Olympians will get to
see the 25th Olympics this year, some 80 years or so after
they competed. The continuous increase in life expectancy
over the last decades has contributed to the growth in the
number of centenarians in the world’s population [1, 2]. For
example, in 2015 the Queen of England sent some 9,736
wishes of congratulations to centenarians, compared to just
3,000 in 1952 when she came to the throne [3]. Even if the
total number of centenarians in the world remains uncer-
tain, in 2013 the United Nations’ World Population Ageing
2013 estimated that there were around 4,41,000 living cen-
tenarians worldwide (i.e. 6.2 centenarians per 1,00,000
people) [2]. In 2010, more than 80% of US centenarians
were female [4]. Centenarians are the fastest growing demo-
graphic in much of the developed world [5]. By 2050, it is
expected that there will be around 3.4 million centenarians
worldwide [2]. Centenarians are often considered as models
of successful healthy ageing [6]. Some of them reach this
age milestone while maintaining notable health indices.
They preserve a high level of physical activity and therefore
achieve remarkable sporting performances considering their
age.
In recent times centenarians have even begun to partici-
pate in sporting competitions worldwide, becoming icons of
healthy ageing and provide evidence that it is never too late to
start exercising and reap the benefits of regular exercise [7].

 Fauja Singh, one of the most famous centenarian athletes,
was a priori the first to finish a marathon despite his perform-
ance not having yet been approved by the World Master
Athletics Association (i.e. the association that validates master
athlete performances in athletics). In 2014, the French cyclist
Robert Marchand (102 years) set the hour record in track cyc-
ling in the 100–104-year age group. In the same year, the
Japanese swimmer Mieko Nagaoka set several swimming
world records (distances from 50 m to 1500 m) in the 100–
104-year age group.
Even though we may associate the above mentioned
(and other) performances of centenarian athletes with an
outstanding human capacity, the age-related decline in per-
formance of these centenarian athletes is not actually
known. Moreover, it would be interesting to know who, of
the centenarian athletes across different disciplines, attained
the best performance in comparison to the respective world
records of their disciplines.
Method
In order to investigate these two aspects of centenarian per-
formances, we identified and compared all of the best perfor-
mances
achieved
by
centenarians
in
three
disciplines:
athletics, swimming and cycling. Data were collected from
the following websites of the international association or fed-
erations: http://www.world-masters-athletics.org for athletics;
http://www.fina.org/content/masters-records for swimming
and http://www.uci.ch/track/about for cycling. Each record
performance (centenarians or non-centenarians) measured in
time was expressed as an average speed over each distance (i.
e. for 60 m running, 50 m swimming or 1 h track cycling,
etc.). For jumping and throwing events, the performance was
defined using the maximum distance obtained. In total, 60
performances of centenarian athletes were found (20 in ath-
letics, 39 in swimming and 1 in cycling). These performances
belong to 19 individuals: 10 athletes in athletics (9 males and
1 female), 8 athletes in swimming (5 males and 3 females)
and 1 male athlete in cycling.
Within each discipline, the decline in performance of
centenarian athletes was expressed as a percentage of the
world record for that discipline, as follows:

Results
The results are presented in Table 1. In athletics, the best
centenarian
performance
(i.e.
the
lowest
percentage
decrease between the world record and the centenarian
record) among men was found in the high jump (−63.3%)
and in the shotput (−81.9%) for women. For running, only
male performances were found and the lowest decrease for
a centenarian in comparison to the world record was
observed in the 100 m (−64.5%). In swimming, the lowest
decrease for a centenarian was observed in the 50 m back-
stroke for males (−73.0%) and females (−71.2%). The cen-
tenarian world record performed by Robert Marchand in
track cycling appears to be the best performance (−50.6%
compared with the hour world record) achieved by a cen-
tenarian, all disciplines taken together.
Discussion
Previous studies have shown that athletic performance is
maintained until 35 years of age, followed by linear decreases
to 70–80 years of age ranging from 7 to 14% per decade,
depending on the discipline. After this threshold of age, the
performances in running tend to plummet, whereas the per-
formances, for example, in throwing decline much more gently
[8]. We found that the average decline in performance of cen-
tenarian athletes was 78% in comparison with the initial world
record. Our methods of comparing records of each centenar-
ian with the corresponding world record of that discipline pro-
vide a powerful means of assessing their performance using
robust criteria. Ideally however, further information could be
gained by comparing their centenarian record with each ath-
letes’ own record. This, however, is impossible as we did not
have access to that information.
Several performances completed by Fauja Singh in ath-
letics were not considered in the present report because
they are unofficial. His best performance in comparison
with the respective world record was achieved in the 100 m
(−59.1%, 23.4s) while, for instance, the decrease in his
marathon performance was 75.7%.
The performance of the centenarian cyclist Robert
Marchand is outstanding and corresponds to an age-
related decline in performance of less than 8% per decade
for more than 6 decades. This lower age-related decline
for a cycling event is consistent with previous work show-
ing that the age-related decline in cycling performances
was less compared with running and swimming [9, 10].
Irrespective of the specificity of the locomotion type,
Robert Marchand has certainly shown exceptional physio-
logical characteristics (e.g. muscular and cardiorespiratory
functions) for his age [7]. This is in agreement with previ-
ous observations showing that centenarians have signifi-
cant limitations to gas exchange across the lungs during
exercise but this limited oxygen transport is tempered by
improved skeletal muscle cycling efficiency [6].
Given the increased number of centenarians world-
wide, the increased participation rate of master athletes in
competitions [10] and the development of specific com-
petitions for master athletes, it is very likely that the num-
ber of centenarian athletes will increase in the coming
years leading to progress in their performances. Only two
performances of centenarian athletes were found in the
105–109-year age group while a performance of a super-
centenarian (age > 110 years) athlete has never been
observed so far. We expect in the near future however, to
observe the first sporting performance for a supercente-
narian athlete.

 The centenarian athletes must be seen not only as excep-
tional biological examples but also as evidence that it is
never too late to be active [7]. We can only hypothesize
that, as the number of centenarians grows and attitudes
towards exercise changes in these older persons, the excep-
tional performances detailed here will become more com-
monplace, and may perhaps open new perspectives on how
the human body can resist the deleterious effects of physio-
logical ageing.
Key points
• Some centenarians preserve a high level of physical activ-
ity and achieve remarkable sporting performances consid-
ering their age.
• The average decline in performance of centenarian ath-
letes was ~78%.
• The world record performed by Robert Marchand in
track cycling appears to be the best performance achieved
by a centenarian.
• The number of centenarian athletes will increase in the
coming years leading to progress in their performances.
• The centenarian athletes must be seen as evidence that it
is never too late to be active.
