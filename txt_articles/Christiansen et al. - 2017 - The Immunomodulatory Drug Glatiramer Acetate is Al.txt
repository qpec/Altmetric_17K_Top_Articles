Classic drug development strategies have failed to meet the urgent clinical needs in treating infections 
with Gram-negative bacteria. Repurposing drugs can lead to timely availability of new antibiotics, 
accelerated by existing safety profiles. Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a widely used and safe formulation 
for treatment of multiple sclerosis. It contains a large diversity of essentially isomeric polypeptides 
with the cationic and amphiphilic character of many antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Here, we report 
that GA is antibacterial, targeting Gram-negative organisms with higher activity towards Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa than the naturally-occurring AMP LL-37 in human plasma. As judged from flow cytometric 
assays, bacterial killing by GA occurred within minutes. Laboratory strains of Escherichia coli and P. 
aeruginosa were killed by a process of condensing intracellular contents. Efficient killing by GA was 
also demonstrated in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates and approximately 50% of clinical 
isolates of P. aeruginosa from chronic airway infection in CF patients. By contrast, the Gram-positive 
Staphylococcus aureus cells appeared to be protected from GA by an increased formation of nm-scale 
particulates. Our data identify GA as an attractive drug repurposing candidate to treat infections with 
Gram-negative bacteria.
Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are among the most urgent obstacles in the treatment of infec-
tious diseases. Infections caused by extended-spectrum β
-lactamases-producing Enterobacteriaceae or 
multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with increased mortality and hospital length of stay1. 
Only a limited number of new suitable antibacterial agents are in development for targeting these infections2. 
Among these, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising3. However, the currently known AMPs are of limited 
therapeutic value due to systemic toxicity and poor stability4. Toxicity has been cited as one reason preventing 
the clinical use of otherwise promising candidates such as LL-37, a natural AMP generated by proteolysis of

human cathelicidin5,6, and it explains why the use of other similar compounds are largely restricted to topical 
applications4,7.
The activity of AMPs is often dramatically impeded following contact with the anionic lipopolysaccharides 
(LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria8,9. Intriguingly, several plants and animals overcome 
this antimicrobial resistance by deploying multiple peptide isoforms. In this way, temporins and dermaseptins, 
groups of AMPs isolated from amphibians, provide a specific and fast-acting defence system through synergy 
between these AMP isoforms10–14. Antimicrobial formulations based on such multimerics have previously been 
proposed12,14. However, technical challenges emerge in large-scale, reproducible manufacturing3 as well as in the 
design of safe formulations. One manufacturing option involves the preparation of antimicrobial polypeptides 
from random polymerization of N-carboxy-α
-amino anhydride monomers. As early as the late 1950s, it was 
observed that poly-lysine and random copolymers resembling the natural AMP gramicidin could disrupt bacte-
rial membranes15. More recent polymerization techniques enabled the synthesis of binary-block polymers with 
a well-defined chain composition and length, which adopt the cationic and amphiphilic nature of many AMPs16. 
These copolymers possess high antimicrobial activity17. To our knowledge, however, none of the more recently 
designed antimicrobial copolymers have been tested in humans. Consequently, their toxicity in humans remains 
unexplored.
The random copolymer glatiramer acetate (GA; also referred to as COP-1)18 was among the first effective 
medical treatments of multiple sclerosis (MS)19. From more than 20 years of use in the clinic, GA treatment is 
known to be safe and well tolerated, even when administered systemically20–23. GA copolymers are made from 
random copolymerization of the acetic anhydrides of l-glutamate, l-lysine, l-alanine, and l-tyrosine in molar 
ratios that produce polymers with an overall cationic and amphipathic character24. It was recently demonstrated 
that the chemical and biophysical properties of GA are similar to LL-3725, including the ability of GA to disrupt 
lipid bilayers. GA’s composition of random copolymers is reminiscent of temporins and dermaseptins. However, 
the antimicrobial properties of GA has not been previously addressed.
Here, we report that GA has substantial antibacterial effects. The activity is effective against Gram-negative 
organisms including P. aeruginosa, but less effective against the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical 
strains of P. aeruginosa from airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients displayed varying degrees of susceptibility to 
GA. Guided by recent progress in characterizing the nanostructure of microbial surfaces26 and their interaction 
with AMPs27, we investigated the microbial responses to AMPs in terms of formation of particulate material. 
Treatment with both LL-37 and GA enhanced formation of nanoparticulates by S. aureus, whereas Gram-negative 
species did not form nanoparticulates. Our results suggest that at least some of the challenges in designing safe 
AMPs using the principles of synergetic AMP isoforms could be overcome by repurposing GA for antimicrobial 
treatment, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria.
Results
The antimicrobial effect of GA on bacterial culture growth. 
The inhibitory of GA on bacterial growth 
was evaluated by an optical antimicrobial susceptibility testing system (OASTS), which enable real-time cell-by-
cell enumeration from time-lapse microscopy. With appropriate adjustments in the initial cell concentration and 
duration of the experiments to fit the data collection capacity of the instrument, the minimal inhibitory concen-
tration (MIC) of GA was determined for laboratory strains of S. aureus (Wood 46) and E. coli (NCTC 10418) 
with the OASTS (Fig. 1). Representative images are shown of the bacterial density immediately after application 
Figure 1. Bacterial growth of S. aureus and E. coli assessed by OASTS. Bacteria were incubated with GA 
to establish MIC from two-fold serial dilutions. (A) The oCelloScope™ instrument recorded pictures of 
the bacterial growth every 10–15 min during the experiment. Pictures from the cultures show the bacterial 
density at the start (0 h), in the middle (3 h) and at the end (5 h) of the experiments. (B) Bacterial growth was 
measured by the oCelloScope segmentation and extraction of surface area (SESA) algorithm. The applied 
GA concentrations are indicated in the legend. All data shown represent the mean value and SEM of three 
independent experiments, each in replicates of two.

of GA (0 h), in the middle of the time lapse (3 h) and at the end of the incubation (5 h) (Fig. 1A). Untreated E. 
coli and S. aureus showed exponential growth to high density within 2–3 h of incubation. With addition of GA 
to the E. coli culture, growth was retarded after ∼
15 min and with a MIC of 31 µg/ml. This was different from the 
lower antimicrobial efficacy against S. aureus with a MIC of 500 µg/ml (Fig. 1B). The OASTS failed analysis of P. 
aeruginosa (PAO1) cultures, because the formation of cell aggregates prevented reproducible enumeration by the 
software (data not shown).
Fast-acting bactericidal effects of GA and LL-37 on E. coli and P. aeruginosa. 
To further investi-
gate the type of growth retardation exhibited by GA, we used flow cytometry-based assays enabling the immediate 
assessment of bacterial viability. We investigated the antimicrobial properties of GA and LL-37 on the laboratory 
strains of S. aureus (Fig. 2A), E. coli (Fig. 2B) and P. aeruginosa (Fig. 2C). With the indications of a fast acting 
effect, we chose to stain the samples after 30 min of incubation. For comparison, S. aureus was exposed to vanco-
mycin, while E. coli and P. aeruginosa were exposed to piperacillin/tazobactam. Cell killing positive controls were 
made by isopropanol treatment, with the concentration (10%) adjusted to maintain a population of morphologi-
cally intact cells permitting flow cytometric analysis. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI), staining only 
cells with a permabilized, damaged membrane, and SYTO® 9 staining both damaged and undamaged cells. To 
aid precise counting of cells, a fixed number of microspheres were added to each experiment. By stopping sample 
inclusion after ∼
10,000 counts in the microspheres gate, high comparability was ensured between experiments.
For all bacterial species tested (Fig. 2), the PI/SYTO 9 staining identified major distinct populations of cells 
in addition to cells with intermediate staining patterns, consistent with other observations using this method-
ology28. Untreated bacteria presented a largely homogenous population of 80–95% of all cells in quadrangle 
(Q) 3, strongly stained for the green-fluorescent SYTO 9 and only weakly stained by the red-fluorescent PI. All 
cell-killing agents used in our study, including isopropanol, favoured in general the formation of cell populations 
highly stained with both PI and SYTO 9 (Q2) or SYTO 9-dim events with a high PI stain (Q1). However, as illus-
trated by data from a representative experiment (Fig. 2), interesting differences were noted between the treated 
bacteria and the types of treatment.
For S. aureus, the combined populations of PI-positive events (Q1 + Q2) reached ∼
11% following treatment 
with 50 µg/ml GA and ∼
28% for LL-37 treatment at the same concentration, compared with only 3% in the case 
of untreated S. aureus or 32% when treated with isopropanol. This process was driven by increased events in both 
Q1 and Q2. An increase in a subpopulation of PI-positive events in Q1 with decreased SYTO 9 intensity (<103) 
followed exposure to both LL-37 and GA (Fig. 2A).
In the case of the Gram-negative species, a 5–8-fold increase in the events in Q1 was observed, with narrowly 
confined borders in SYTO 9 staining. No change was observed in Q2 (Fig. 2B,C). Among the tested organisms 
and conditions, the high efficacy of GA against P. aeruginosa was striking, with the populations in Q1 after GA 
treatment comprising 80% of all events, exceeding LL-37 at 70%, and reaching levels comparable to isopropanol at 
92%. E. coli was also susceptible to GA treatment, although less so than P. aeruginosa, with the dead cells reaching 
a level of 16% following treatment versus 5% without treatment.
The relative dose-response levels in cell killing was investigated using the flow cytometry stains and absolute 
enumeration described above. The increase in PI-positive cells (Δ
PI in Q1 + Q2) was measured together with 
enumeration of the combined events in Q1, Q2, and Q4 versus the events in Q3 enumerating PI-negative/SYTO 
9 positive, live cells28. To simplify comparison between the independent experiments, results were reported rel-
ative to untreated bacteria (Fig. 3). Increasing concentrations of LL-37 and GA resulted in gradually higher PI 
positivity for all bacterial species, with a particularly noteworthy result for P. aeruginosa, reaching equivalent 
levels for LL-37 and GA at 50% using 50 µg/ml (Fig. 3A). The dose-dependency was tested in a Kruskal-Wallis 
analysis comparing the dosage groups. For P. aeruginosa groups differed significantly for LL-37 (p < 0.03), GA 
(p < 0.0001), but not for piperacillin/tazobactam (p < 0.97). The strong PI staining of P. aeruginosa treated with 
GA was associated with a three-fold increase in the events in Q1 + Q2 + Q4, differing significantly from the 
dose-dependent change in events in Q3 at 50 µg/ml GA as analysed by a Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.03). Treatment 
of E. coli produced a quantitatively weaker response. However, as for P. aeruginosa, dosage groups differed sig-
nificantly in PI staining for treatment with LL-37 (p < 0.0001), GA (p < 0.0005), but not for piperacillin/tazo-
bactam (p < 0.27). The increase in events in Q1 + Q2 + Q4 reached approximately two-fold for treatment with 
LL-37 (p < 0.03) and GA (p < 0.03), with approximately the same dose-dependency between PI staining and 
Q1 + Q2 + Q4 events. For S. aureus, groups differed significantly for treatment with LL-37 (p < 0.01), and van-
comycin (p < 0.02), but not for GA (p < 0.15). When using LL-37, S. aureus produced the weakest response in 
PI staining among the three bacterial stains, but the largest increase in the Q1 + Q2 + Q4 events at 5-fold using 
50 µg/ml LL-37 (p < 0.03). Similarly, for GA treatment, the PI staining of S. aureus was less than 10%, however, 
the number of events still increased approximately 3-fold at a concentration of 50 µg/ml (p < 0.03). Unlike the 
antibiotics treatment of the Gram-negative species, vancomycin treatment of S. aureus significantly enhanced the 
PI staining (p < 0.02) and the events in Q1 + Q2 + Q4 compared to Q1 (p < 0.03).
The time-dependent killing by GA were resolved in the flow cytometric assay and showed an almost imme-
diate antibacterial activity upon contact with P. aeruginosa (PAO1) (Fig. 3B). The increased number of events in 
Q1 + Q2 + Q4 and corresponding decrease in Q3 showed a statistically significant, linear dependency between 
time duration and killing, with the same-magnitude rate change (α
) also indicating that the assay captured all 
cells in the experiments.
As an extension on the test on the bactericidal activity of GA and LL-37, the relative number of colony-forming 
units (CFU) was compared following treatment according to the protocols for the experiments analysed by flow 
cytometry. To increase the number of Gram-negative species under consideration, Acinetobacter baumannii was 
also included in these analyses, with one multiresistant clinical isolate (AUH 149) and one antibiotic-susceptible 
isolate (AUH 351). Treatment with GA caused a reduction in as much as 75% of viable Gram-negative bacteria

of LL-37, 50 µg/ml of GA, antibiotics or 10% isopropanol. Experiments were carried out in PBS supplemented 
with 40 mg/ml human serum albumin. Bacteria were incubated with two nucleic acid stains; red-fluorescent 
PI and green-fluorescent SYTO 9. PI penetrates only bacteria with disrupted membranes. In contrary, SYTO 
9 stains all bacteria in a population. From these stains, flow cytometric plots were divided into four quadratic 
gates (Q1-Q4) as indicated with black lines. For each gate, the percentage of total events is stated. Gate Q3 
contained viable bacteria, with strong green fluorescence (SYTO 9) and weak red fluorescence intensity (PI). 
Q1, Q2, and Q4 contained dead bacteria and fragments of bacteria. For antibiotic comparisons, S. aureus was 
treated with vancomycin, whereas E. coli and P. aeruginosa were exposed to piperacillin/tazobactam. The results 
shown are representative of a total of four independent experiments.

Figure 3. Quantification of antimicrobial activity of GA compared with LL-37 and classic antibiotics using 
flow cytometry. (A) For each species of bacteria (S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa) and each type of treatment 
(LL-37, GA, or antibiotics), the plots show the change in events in Q1 + Q2 + Q4 or Q3 as a function of the 
applied concentration of antimicrobial relative to untreated bacteria (Q10 + Q20 + Q40 and Q30, respectively). 
The antimicrobial-induced change in percentage of PI-positive bacterial cells is shown as a function of the 
concentration applied antimicrobial. For each concentration, the change (Δ
PI) was calculated by subtracting 
the percentage of PI-positive cells in untreated cells (typically less than 5%) from the percentage in the treated 
cells. Hatched lines indicate the level of PI staining induced by treatment with 10% (v/v) isopropanol. (B) 
Kinetics of bacterial killing. P. aeruginosa (PAO1) was treated with 50 µg/ml GA in PBS. Bacteria were stained 
with a mixture of SYTO 9 and PI. Bacterial survival was monitored over 30 min and determined as described 
in Materials and Methods. Data points were fitted by linear regression. The black line depicts the decrease in 
viable (Q3) bacteria and the grey line represents the increase of dead bacteria and fragments of dead bacteria 
(Q1 + Q2 + Q4). All data shown represent the mean value and SEM of four independent experiments.

after only 30 min of treatment (Fig. 4A). Both E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii were affected. Among 
the two A. baumannii isolates, only the antibiotics susceptible isolate (AUH 351) produced statistical significant 
results (p < 0.03) with a strong trend for the multiresistant isolate as well (p < 0.06). In P. aeruginosa, treatment 
with 25 or 50 µg/ml of GA reduced the CFU almost to the detection limit. From a quantitative perspective, this 
striking reduction in CFU counts for P. aeruginosa (Fig. 4A) indicated a more pronounced killing than was found 
with the flow cytometric assays (Fig. 3A). In general treatment with LL-37 produced weaker responses, ranking 
the two reagents similarly to the findings with flow cytometry.
A more limited effect was recorded in treatments of S. aureus similar to the flow cytometry results. Neither 
LL-37 nor GA were able to strikingly reduce colony formation, and no dose-response was detectable for GA treat-
ment of S. aureus in concentrations ≥
10 µg/ml.

Different strains of P. aeruginosa vary in their susceptibility to AMPs29,30. Whether mucoid or not and sensi-
tivity to antibiotics of the isolates were characterized (Suppl. Table 1). We assessed the influence of GA in suspen-
sions of 44 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. Tested isolates had a range of resistance profiles from broad sensitivity to 
representatives from each of the major antibiotic classes, to a variety of multidrug resistance patterns (including 
one isolate that was colistin resistant). As before, the response to GA was monitored over a 30-min period in 
phosphate-buffered saline. Responses of the 44 isolates fell consistently into one of three patterns: i) fast suscep-
tibility responders, showing a reduction in OD600 at first measurement (i.e., ~5 mins after addition of GA), com-
prising 34% the isolates; ii) slower susceptibility responders, with initial OD600 similar to controls but exhibiting a 
decrease during the 30-min monitored period, comprising 16% of isolates, and iii) resistant isolates, a group with 
an apparent lack of response over the entire 30-min period, comprising 50% of the isolates (Fig. 4B). The suscep-
tibility of each individual isolate was consistent upon replicate and repeat testing. Susceptibility was not related 
to being mucoid or not or antibiotic resistance as probed with χ
2 tests (p = 0.485 and p = 0.896, respectively).
To confirm that the OD600 changes obtained reflected bacterial killing, representative isolates from apparently 
GA sensitive and resistant groups were treated as above and serial dilutions, plating and colony counting was per-
formed. Over all, the results confirmed the influence of GA largely as assessed by the OD measurements. For one 
resistant strain, viability assessed by CFU at 30 mins remained at 111% of the control (R21 in Fig. 4C). For those 
strains categorised as GA-sensitive, CFU counting revealed that OD may have been underestimating the killing 
effect. For the fast susceptible strains FS5 and FS13, the viability was 32% and 15% in CFU counting (Fig. 4C) 
while the OD measurements indicated only a viability loss of 76% and 82%, respectively. Similarly, for the slow 
susceptible strain SS6, the CFU counting found a viability of 39% (Fig. 4C), while OD measurement suggested 
a viability of 88%. A similar observation was made in parallel with P. aeruginosa (PAO1), where CFU counting 
found a viability of only 1.3%, similar to the data in Fig. 4A, while OD measurements suggested a viability of 72%. 
For another slow susceptible clinical strain SS5, estimates were similar with the two techniques at 90% for CFU 
counting (Fig. 4C) and 92% for OD measurement. Assessment at 30 mins, however, was unlikely to be optimal 
for such a strain.
GA antimicrobial activity persist in plasma and pre-formed biofilms. 
Many AMPs lack antimicro-
bial activity in blood or other biologically relevant liquids5,31–33. Moreover, many bacterial species, including P. 
aeruginosa, form biofilms as part of infection, which limits the action of AMPs.
We analysed the killing of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) by GA in human serum and plasma in side-by-side exper-
iments with LL-37, which is known to retain activity under these conditions34. Bacterial survival, enumeration 
and statistical analyses were evaluated by flow cytometry as described above with the incubation time of 30 min 
(Fig. 3). Unlike experiments in albumin-supplemented buffer (Fig. 3), the number of events in Q4 were relatively 
high, even without treatment (Fig. 5A), causing relatively moderate changes in Q1 + Q2 + Q4 as part of the treat-
ment with GA or LL-37 (Fig. 5B). Reduction of events in Q3 proved a more robust measure (Fig. 5B), but this 
came with the emergence of a PI negative/SYTO 9 dim population in Q4, which is difficult to rationalize in terms 
of viability (Fig. 5A). By contrast, although the PI stain was somewhat attenuated in both serum and plasma, 
the percentage-positive cells was nevertheless sufficient for concluding that bacterial killing occurred and that 
GA worked much better than LL-37 (Fig. 5B). To validate these findings further, we also tested the effects by the 
CFU counting assay used above under conditions with 50% (v/v) human plasma (Fig. 5C). This corroborated the 
impression from the flow cytometric PI stain, with GA working markedly better than LL-37. Indeed, as noted 
above, the effect of GA seemed even a stronger antimicrobial agent in this assay than in the flow cytometric 
analyses.
The formation of biofilms, such as those associated with chronic infections, may significantly limit the action 
by antimicrobial agents for example, by trapping cationic agents in neutralizing DNA complexes or maintaining 
a pH incompatible with antimicrobial function35. To test the effect of GA on preformed biofilms, biofilms of 
P. aeruginosa (PAO1) were cultivated in flow chambers. LL-37 was included in side-by-side experiments using 
640 µg/ml for both compounds, previously determined for LL-37 as the minimal concentration for biofilm erad-
ication in experiments lasting 24 h36. After 3 h of incubation, both compounds induced a strong PI staining 
(Fig. 6A). The average survival of P. aeruginosa in biofilm exposed to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), LL-37, or 
GA for 3 hours was 91%, 34% and 37%, respectively (Fig. 6B). This indicated that the activity of GA was similar to 
that of LL-37 on preformed P. aeruginosa biofilms.
LL-37 and GA induces an envelope stress response in S. aureus. 
The flow cytometric characteri-
zation of cellular responses to GA and LL-37 suggested that formation of smaller fragments played a part in the 
contact with the bacterial cells, especially in the case of S. aureus. To gain further insight into the nature of these 
processes through better size resolution than provided by flow cytometry, we quantified the responses by use of 
nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
We recently demonstrated that NTA measurement enables a high sensitivity in measuring damage to cell 
membranes25. Moreover, this technique also measures the size of particles into the nm-regimen, enabling ultra-
structural characterization of AMP-induced fragmentation of bacteria. To our knowledge, this approach has not 
previously been applied in analysis of bacterial fragment formation. NTA was conducted on supernatants from 
suspensions of the laboratory strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa following exposure to either LL-37 or 
GA and compared with that of untreated bacteria (Fig. 7). For all conditions and species, the particulate material 
varied in size between ∼
80–500 nm. Both in the untreated condition as well as following LL-37 and GA exposure, 
S. aureus-derived supernatants presented pronounced spikes in the particle distribution. By contrast, superna-
tants from the Gram-negative species had a smoother profile (Fig. 7A). In S. aureus, LL-37 or GA treatment 
provoked a higher abundance of particles with a size of ∼
90 nm. The change in size distribution towards a smaller 
size of the particles was clear from comparison in a cumulative plot (Fig. 7B). The cumulative distributions were

compared in a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, where the LL-37 and GA treated samples differed significantly from the 
untreated sample (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0006, respectively). A similar phenomenon was discernible in the analysis 
of E. coli (Fig. 7A,B) for GA treatment (p < 0.002), but not for LL-37 treatment (p < 0.30). The size distribution of 
particles produced by P. aeruginosa was essentially unaffected by LL-37 or GA treatment (Fig. 7A,B) although a 
small significant difference was found between GA treated and untreated samples was found (p < 0.01), but not 
for the LL-37 treatment (p < 0.08).
Closely adhering to the conditions used above, TEM imaging was made of S. aurueus following treatment 
with either LL-37 (Fig. 8A & S1A) or GA (Fig. 8B & S1B). These bacteria appeared largely undamaged from 
Figure 5. Flow cytometric analysis of antimicrobial activity for GA and LL-37 in human serum and plasma. 
(A) Bacterial isolates of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) were incubated with varying concentrations of LL-37 or GA 
or left untreated at 37 °C for 30 min either in plasma or serum. After exposure to GA or LL-37, bacterial cell 
samples were stained with a mixture of SYTO 9 and PI. (B) Plots of the change in events in Q1 + Q2 + Q4

The antimicrobial-induced change in percentage of PI-positive bacterial cells is shown as a function of the 
concentration GA or LL-37. For each concentration, the change (Δ
PI) was calculated by subtracting the 
percentage of PI-positive cells in untreated from treated cells. The results shown represent average values of 
four independently generated sets of data. SEM are shown as error bars on the curves. (C) Antimicrobial effects

the NanoSight™ instrument. To facilitate a direct comparison between the size distribution profiles, for each 
supernatant the concentration of each size of particle was normalized to the total concentration of particles.

comparison with untreated cells (Fig. 8C & S1C), consistent with the lack of killing of this bacterium observed 
above. Occasional burst of the cells was observed in treatment with GA (Fig. S1B), but too in frequent to assign 
this as an effect of GA (Fig. 8B). On the other hand, agreeing with the observations made with NTA, a large num-
ber of smaller particulates were also observable following LL-37 or GA treatment (Fig. 8A,B). These structures 
appeared after exposure to LL-37 and GA and had a size of 50–150 nm.
Untreated E. coli and P. aeruginosa demonstrated regularly shaped peripheries surrounding an 
electron-absorbing cytoplasma (Fig. 8F,I & S1F,I). In E. coli, LL-37 and GA the treatments produced emptied cel-
lular shapes with a well-defined circumference, more irregular waved than for untreated controls (Fig. 8F & S1F), 
but clearly coherent (Fig. 8D,E & S1D,E). One of the most distinctive observations was the generation of ghost-like 
E. coli cells, almost devoid of cytoplasmic content following LL-37 treatment, with small, electron-dense accu-
mulations (Fig. 8D &S1D). GA treatment produced a more crumbled cellular appearance: in approximately 30% 
of the cases, large, dense aggregates appeared inside cells without other cytoplasmic content (Fig. 8E & S1E). 
For treatment of P. aeruginosa, the total numbers of intact, damaged cells were reduced (Fig. 8G,H) compared 
with untreated P. aeruginosa controls (Fig. 8I). As in the case of E. coli, cytoplasmic aggregates were pronounced 
following GA treatment, although the size of the aggregates in P. aeruginosa appeared smaller than those seen

following treatment with either LL-37 or GA. In the image of P. aeruginosa after treatment with GA, the arrow

in E. coli cells (Fig. 8H & Fig. S1G–I). Although the influence of LL-37 and GA was pronounced on E. coli and 
 
P. aeruginosa, remarkably little formation of particulates were observed akin to those found with S. aureus.
Discussion
The current lengthy and costly process of de novo drug discovery is described as ill-equipped to combat the 
rapidly emerging drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens37. From this perspective, drug repurposing has been 
investigated through high-throughput screens as a potential source of antibacterial agents38 with notable suc-
cesses in creating drug leads for treatment of infections caused by amoeba39. Known safety characteristics of 
repurposed drugs often enables swifter testing in patients than in conventional drug development40. Typically, 
auxiliary safety testing in animals is required, while involvement of animal models of disease in appropriate cases 
can be omitted. This is a particular noteworthy aspect in the case of infectious diseases, where accurate preclinical 
models of human bacterial infection are notoriously difficult to establish and, by nature, embody significant lim-
itations in terms of gaining insights into drug action against human disease41.
In treatment of MS, GA is administered by subcutaneous injection at levels as much as 40 mg three times a 
week, or 20 mg once daily. The major side effect is erythema, reported in 80% of studied cases, and, in 15–20% of 
cases, patients experience effects such as chest tightness and shortness of breath. Also supporting the safety of GA, 
it is the preferred drug choice for pregnant MS patients20. Taken together, the use of GA as an antimicrobial to treat 
potentially lethal infections would not be compromised by its known safety profile. With the already high dosages 
of GA employed clinically, it seems likely that critical levels of compound to kill microbes can be reached without 
compromising safety. For example, this could be relevant in treatment by inhalation of lung infections with P. 
aeruginosa. The total dosage of 20 mg used routinely in MS therapy would replenish 400 ml of lung fluid to the 
maximum 50 µg/ml concentration used in our studies. The volume of the epithelial lining fluid in the lower respira-
tory tract, often a site of P. aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, has been estimated at 15–70 ml42; 
therefore, infection in this location would only require a dose of 3.5 mg GA, and hence permit a considerable 
overload of drug delivered to other sites of infection and compensate for losses to zones outside infection foci.
Among S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa (PAO1), and A. baumannii, especially the Gram-negative species were 
susceptible to GA, with P. aeruginosa the most susceptible in buffer emulating human plasma with regard to salt 
and HSA concentrations. GA also showed activity against P. aeruginosa in undiluted human serum and plasma. 
Here, further validation by use of CFU counting confirmed that human plasma does not interfere with this anti-
microbial activity of GA. A barrier commonly found to the effective antibiotics treatment is the embedding of the 
bacteria in biofilms. However, GA killed P. aeruginosa in preformed biofilms as efficiently as LL-37, adding yet 
another valuable property to the antimicrobial activity of GA.
Bacterial fragments, typically in the form of liposomal vesicles, are shed both as virulence factors and as a 
protective mechanism against various stress signals, including AMPs43–45. Using NTA technology, we found that 
S. aureus produces particulate material, with sizes around 100 nm, in response to LL-37 and GA treatment. These 
vesicles were not quantitatively generated by E. coli or P. aeruginosa. Formation of this material and greater sur-
vival of S. aureus compared with the Gram-negative organisms encourages the speculation that S. aureus actively 
uses the particulates as decoys to protect against otherwise toxic cationic polymers. It is already known that S. 
aureus produces cell wall material released to the ambience, likely to be involved in avoiding attack by other parts 
of the innate immune system46. Such nano-particulate material easily enhances the available contacts for AMP 
binding, consistent with a function as decoy target. From insights on the microbial cell wall structure at the nm 
scale47, notably its assembly in repeating structural units48, it is possible AMP-mediated aggregation of these units 
are part of making the distinct sizes of the released material observe in our study.
Regarding the actual mechanism of killing, inspection of TEM images of the Gram-negative species, par-
ticularly E. coli, revealed an abundance of cellular ghosts, apparently emptied of cytosolic content, or with 
electron-dense, intracellular condensates, in GA- and LL-37-treated cells to lesser extent. Other AMPs also create 
cellular ghosts when targeting Gram-negative bacteria49. With the established ability of LL-37 to induce nucleic 
acid complex formation50, it seems reasonable to suggest that GA and LL-37 at least partially exert their toxicity 
by such a process once inside their bacterial targets. This may explain one persistent observation made in our 
study, namely the apparent stronger antimicrobial effect of GA in the CFU counting assay compared to the meas-
ures generated in flow cytometry. GA toxicity through formation of intracellular condensates requires transport 
of the compound inside the bacteria, which, on the other hand, may not depend on an initial fragmentation or 
permeabilization of the cellular membranes. In this way, cell fragmentation or PI-staining of permeabilized cells 
may not fully capture the number of dead bacteria with these compounds.
In CF patients, P. aeruginosa infection occurs early in life, but can be eradicated in its early stages; how-
ever, registry data show that around 60% of adults with the disease are chronically infected51. These isolates exist 
in biofilms, often adopting a mucoid phenotype, adding to a heterogeneous outcome in antibiotics treatment, 
which was the reason for expanding our observations with the PAO1 strain. Indeed, GA killing was observed in 
50% of isolates. One explanation for this proportion seems that the OD-based methodology utilised, suitable for 
high-throughput testing unlike CFU counting, may have under-estimated the killing effect as also noted for the 
flow cytometric assays. As another explanation, CF isolates have significant, but broadly differing, sensitivity to 
AMPs such as cathelicidins29,30, which may relate to well-described changes in surface structures such as LPS or 
to possession of temporate phage; Pf1 was shown in isolates of Liverpool Epidemic Strain to protect against killing 
by LL-37 by forming inactivating aggregates30.
Given the observed fast killing of GA, further drug development work may prove that GA’s best use is as a 
synergistic treatment alongside conventional antibiotics. Treatment regiments including GA and conventional 
antibiotics could help ensure that the targeted killing effect occurs, and allow physicians to reduce antibiotic 
dose, whilst maintaining efficacy thereby reducing the debilitating side effects of some current treatments. 
Taken together, repurposing existing drugs greatly widens the possibilities of bringing fundamentally novel

antibiotics into clinical use within a time frame that can meet the rapidly growing need for treatments of other-
wise difficult-to-treat infections with Gram-negative organisms.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions. 
Laboratory strains of E. coli (strain NCTC 10418), P. aerugi-
nosa (PAO1, ATCC 15692), and S. aureus (Wood 46, NCTC 7121) were grown on 5% (v/v) blood agar (The State 
Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark) at 38.5 °C for 16 h in a CO2 incubator. Single colonies from the blood 
agar streaks were transferred to four test tubes containing approximately 10 ml of Todd Hewitt Broth (THB; 
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The cultures were incubated with agitation at 37 °C for 16 h and grown to late-log 
phase. THB is especially used for growth of streptococci; however, we find this rich medium useful for investiga-
tions of many other kinds of bacteria due to its low content of undigested proteins.
Clinical isolates of A. baumannii were obtained from Dept. of Clinical Microbiology, Aarhus University 
Hospital. One multi resistant isolate (AUH 149) produced the OXA-23 β
-lactamase and carried, in addition, the 
resistance genes blaADC-25-like, blaOXA-64, blaPER-1, blaTEM-1B, aac(3)-IIa, strA, strB. AUH 351 is a clinical 
isolate obtained from blood culture. The isolate is susceptible to meropenem, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, and 
has a low MIC to piperacillin/tazobactam.
Clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from airway secretions (cough swab, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage) of 
patients with CF at Royal Brompton Hospital CF Centre are routinely stored on beads (Microbank™, Pro-Lab 
Diagnostics, Bromborough, UK) at −
80 °C. We selected 44 isolates to represent a range of antibiotic-susceptible 
and -resistant isolates, defined according to standard clinical protocols (Suppl. Table 1). Beads were streaked 
onto cetrimide agar (Sigma-Aldrich) and grown overnight at 37 °C. Single colonies were inoculated into 10 ml 
Luria-Bertani broth (LB broth, Sigma-Aldrich) and grown for 14–16 h at 37 °C with agitation at 200 rpm.
Susceptibility to GA antimicrobial effects tested by OASTS. 
E. coli and S. aureus laboratory 
strains were grown overnight in Sensititre® cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth with N-tris(hydroxymethyl)
methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid buffer (CAMHBT, TREK Diagnostic System, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Oakwood village, OH) at 37 °C. Bacterial cell suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (∼
1.5 ×
 108 
cells/ml) using a nephelometer (Sensititre™, Thermo Fisher). Subsequently, bacteria were diluted in CAMHBT 
to a final inoculum of 5 ×
 105 cells/ml52. Growth was analysed in Nunc Edge™ 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher) 
by OASTS using the oCelloScope™ instrument (Philips BioCell A/S, Allerød, Denmark). OASTS is a digital 
time-lapse microscopy technology that scans through a fluid sample, generating time-resolved series of images53. 
Each well was scanned repeatedly every 15 min for the first 2 h and every 10 min for the following 5 h. The OASTS 
instrument was placed inside an Innova 44 incubator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) for precise temperature 
regulation. Digital analyses were made by a custom automation script in MATLAB (Version: 8.0.0.783 [R2012b], 
The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) and image processing was conducted with ImageJ 1.48 v (National Institutes of 
Health, Bethesda, MD). Growth kinetics was determined by image stack processing based on the contrast-based 
segmentation and extraction of surface area (SESA). Determination of MIC values for all experiments on quality 
control reference strains53 was carried out in triplicate experiments. Results were reported when at least two out 
of three MIC results were in agreement.
Flow cytometric analyses of bacterial viability following incubation with LL-37 and GA. 
For 
each bacterial species, 6 ml of late-log phase planktonic bacterial cultures of the S. aureus, E. coli, or P. aeruginosa 
laboratory strains were harvested by centrifugation at 3096 ×
 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were discarded 
and bacteria were resuspended to a final concentration of ~108 cells/ml. From the resuspensions, 1 ml was pelleted 
and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS (Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 40 mg/ml HSA (CSL Behring, Marburg, 
Germany). Volumes of 975–995 µl of resuspension were treated with 2–50 µg/ml of GA (Copaxone™, Teva 
Pharmaceuticals, Petah Tikva, Israel), LL-37 (Innovagen, Lund, Sweden), piperacillin/tazobactam (Laboratorio 
Reig Jofre, Barcelona, Spain), or vancomycin (Xellia Pharmaceuticals, Copenhagen, Denmark) to a final volume 
of 1 ml. The bacterial suspensions were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C with agitation every 15 min. As a control 
on the viability stains, bacteria were also treated with 10% (v/v) isopropanol (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) 
and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with agitation. Subsequently, bacteria were pelleted at 3096 ×
 g for 10 min 
at 4 °C and resuspended in PBS. Bacteria were fluorescently stained with LIVE/DEAD™ Baclight™ Bacterial 
Viability and Counting Kit (Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Microspheres, included for 
accurate counting, were vortexed, followed by sonication in a water bath for 5–10 min. A volume of 977 µl of PBS 
was aliquoted into flow cytometry analysis tubes, plus 1.5 µl of 3.34 mM SYTO 9 and 1.5 µl of 30 mM PI, 10 µl of 
bacterial suspension, and 10 µl microsphere suspension. Bacteria were analysed in an LSRFortessa™ Flow cytom-
etry instrument (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Each sample was evaluated through ∼
10,000 events for 
the gated microspheres.
For measuring the time rate of killing (kinetics), a late-log phase planktonic culture of the P. aeruginosa lab-
oratory strain was harvested as above. The supernatants were discarded and bacteria were resuspended in PBS. 
After resuspension, bacteria were adjusted to ~108 cells/ml. P. aeruginosa was mixed with SYTO 9, PI, and micro-
spheres and incubated for 15 min at RT. A volume of 237.5 µl of this suspension was aliquoted into wells of a 
96-well microtiter plate. To permit fast analysis of the samples, the flow cytometer was started and 12.5 µl GA 
was then added to the well, bringing the final volume to 250 µl and the GA concentration to 50 µg/ml. Data were 
collected as above corresponding to a microsphere uptake of 10,000 events accomplished within 1 min.
All flow cytometric analyses, compensation, and gating of flow cytometry data were performed using FlowJo 
software (Version 10.0.8, Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Single-color controls and an unstained sample were used 
to locate bacterial populations and to determine compensation settings. The initial gating strategy was based 
on a gate around the bacterial population on a forward scatter (FSC-A) versus side scatter (SSC-A) plot. The

photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage and the threshold level was adjusted until the entire bacterial population as 
well as microspheres were on scale on a FSC-A vs. SSC-A plot. Further gating was made by adjusting the green 
fluorescence channel to ensure that live bacteria stained with SYTO 9 was positioned in the top range of the signal 
axis. Similarly, PMT voltages of the red fluorescence channel were adjusted to ensure that dead bacteria stained 
with PI appeared in the top range of the histogram. An unstained sample was applied to confirm that PMT 
voltages were set appropriately. The viability was depicted by framing bacterial populations in four quadrants 
in a SYTO 9 versus PI plot as depicted by manufacturer’s instructions. Furthermore, sample matrix was diluted 
the same as a bacterial sample, confirming that assay background was low and that any background noise on the 
lower end of the histogram was clearly separated from unstained bacteria.
CFU counting following exposure to GA and LL-37. 
Laboratory strains of E. coli, P. aeruginosa and 
S. aureus as well as the clinical isolates AUH 149 and AUH 351 of A. baumannii were grown overnight at 37 °C 
in THB. Bacteria were adjusted to 0.1 McFarland standard (∼
3 ×
 107 cells/ml) in THB and incubated until the 
bacterial culture reached 0.5 McFarland standard (∼
1.5 ×
 108 cells/ml). Bacteria were pelleted and diluted to a 
final inoculum of 5 ×
 105 cells/ml in PBS. Subsequently, bacteria were treated with different concentrations of GA 
(Teva) or LL-37 and incubated on a shaker for 30 min at 37 °C as described for the flow cytometric experiments 
above. Two-fold serial dilutions of the incubations were made in 1.5-ml tubes and, for each dilution, a volume of 
100 µl was plated on 5% (v/v) horse blood agar plates (The State Serum Institute). The bacterial strains were grown 
overnight at 37 °C. The resulting CFUs on the blood agar plates were imaged with a digital camera and counted 
with the aid of the software ImageJ 1.48 v (National Institutes of Health).
Assessing susceptibility of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates to GA. 
Overnight broth cultures were pel-
leted at 3900 ×
 g for 15 min, supernatant removed, cells resuspended in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich), and the concentra-
tion adjusted by to an optical density at λ
 = 600 nm (OD600) of 0.25, which equated to approximately 5 ×
 107 CFU/
ml. To 1.5-ml aliquots of each bacterial suspension, 1.5 μ
l GA (Biocon, Ltd., Electronic City, Bangalore, India) was 
added (final GA concentration of 50 µg/mL), samples were vortexed (5 s), and 200 μ
l was aliquoted immediately 
into each of 6 wells of a 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher). Control wells contained bacterial suspension with no GA. 
OD600 was measured immediately and at 5 min intervals for 30 mins while plates were shaken at 200 rpm, 37 °C 
in a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). We obtained mean OD600 values from 
all 6 wells and normalized them against the strain-specific controls measured after 30 min of incubation. From 
inspection of developments in the OD600 readings, the isolates were grouped into the categories fast susceptible, 
slow susceptible, and resistant.
CFU counting experiments were done with selected isolates as described in the Results sections. Briefly, iso-
lates were cultivated as for the optical-density based experiments, followed by dilution, plating, and CFU count-
ing essentially as described above for the experiments with the laboratory strains.
Antimicrobial activity of GA and LL-37 in physiologically relevant environments. 
Human blood 
from anonymous healthy volunteers was collected in agreement with the Danish Act on Research Ethics Review 
of Health Research Projects. The blood was collected in either Vacutainer™ EDTA tubes or serum tubes (BD 
Biosciences). Plasma or serum was recovered by centrifugation. Late-log phase bacterial cultures were harvested, 
adjusted in either plasma or serum to a final concentration of ∼
108 cells/ml, and analyzed by flow cytometry as 
described above.
For testing of the antimicrobial influence of GA on P. aeruginosa (PAO1) in human plasma by CFU counting, 
the assay was conducted as described above. Bacterial turbidity was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard in PBS. 
Subsequently, bacteria were diluted to a final inoculum of 5 ×
 105 cells/ml in PBS, mixed 1:1 with plasma, and 
treated with GA (Teva) or LL-37 as already described.
For testing of the antimicrobial activity in biofilms, P. aeruginosa was grown on tryptic soy agar for 48 hours 
at 37 °C, and a single colony was used to inoculate LB broth (Sigma-Aldrich, Denmark) for overnight culture at 
37 °C and 180 rpm shaking in an Erlenmeyer flask. Two replicate cultures were prepared. Flow chambers (IBIDI 
µ-Slide VI 0.4, Munich, Germany) were connected to a 1-l media bottle with 37 °C pre-heated LB via a peristaltic 
pump (Watson-Marlow, Falmouth, UK) as described54. The overnight cultures were diluted in fresh LB broth 
to an OD600 of 0.5 (∼
 1.5 ×
 108 CFU/ml), 0.2 ml was injected into the flow channels for inoculation (3 channels 
for each biological replicate), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the investigated surface facing up. The flow 
was then turned on at a rate of 3.5 ml/(h ×
 channel) and the system was incubated 24 h at 37 °C with the surface 
placed vertically and with an upward flow. After biofilms had formed, the flow was stopped and 0.5 ml phosphate 
saline buffer (PBS) was gently injected to remove nutrient media from the flow channels. The preformed biofilms 
were then exposed to 200-µl injections of either 640 µg/ml GA or LL-37 dissolved in ultra-filtered H2O or PBS, 
and then flow cells were incubated under static conditions for 3 h at 37 °C. PBS solutions with SYTO 9 (Thermo 
Fisher) and PI (Thermo Fisher) were injected and images were captured by confocal microscopy (LSM700; Carl 
Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) using 488 nm and 555 nm lasers for excitation. At least 10 representative 2D 
images were captured along the centre of each channel with a 20 ×
 objective. Finally, ImageJ software (National 
Institutes of Health) was used for image analyses and quantification of live/dead ratio.
Nanoparticle tracking analyses and TEM imaging of bacteria. 
Late-log phase E. coli, P. aeruginosa, 
and S. aureus laboratory strains were resuspended in PBS and treated with 50 µg/ml of GA or LL-37 and incubated 
on a shaker for 30 min at 37 °C as described above for the flow cytometry experiments. Subsequently, bacteria 
were pelleted at 3096 ×
 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at 4 °C for later analysis. Supernatants were 
diluted in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) until the concentration of nanoparticles was acceptable for NTA measurements, 
approximately 108 particles/ml. NTA measurements were essentially performed as previously described25 in a

NanoSight™ LM10 system (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK). Camera sensitivity was adjusted to high 
(i.e., 14–16) and the detection threshold was set close to minimum (i.e., 2–5) to accommodate detection of small 
particles. The ambient temperature was recorded manually, ranging from 22 to 25 °C.
For TEM analysis, bacteria were cultivated and treated with 50 µg/ml GA or LL-37 as described under section 
for the flow cytometric analyses. After the treatment, the bacteria were washed three times in PBS. The pellet was 
submerged in liquefied agar, centrifuged at 3096 ×
 g, and allowed to solidify on ice. Fixation, embedding, cutting, 
and TEM was carried out as described46.
Statistical analyses. 
For the statistical analysis of the increased number of flow cytometric events in 
Q1 + Q2 + Q4 and the corresponding decrease in Q3, a Mann-Whitney test was used to test the difference at 
the maximum concentration applied of antimicrobial agent (50 µg/ml). Differences in PI-staining between 
groups with different dosage of antimicrobial agent were evaluated by a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post 
hoc to correct for multiple comparisons. The CFU counting results were statistically analyzed using the same 
procedure further enabling a pairwise comparison between untreated controls and each of the dosage groups. 
Comparisons between the cumulative particle size distributions were made using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) 
test. A two-tailed p-value below 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical calculations were made with the 
GraphPad Prism version 6.0 g for Mac OS X, (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
