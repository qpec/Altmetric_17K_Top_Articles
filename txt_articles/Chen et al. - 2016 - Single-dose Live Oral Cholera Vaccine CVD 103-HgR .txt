Background.
No licensed cholera vaccine is presently available in the United States. Cholera vaccines available in other countries
require 2 spaced doses. A single-dose cholera vaccine that can rapidly protect short-notice travelers to high-risk areas and help con-
trol explosive outbreaks where logistics render 2-dose immunization regimens impractical would be a major advance.
PXVX0200, based on live attenuated Vibrio cholerae O1 classical Inaba vaccine strain CVD 103-HgR, elicits seroconversion of
vibriocidal antibodies (a correlate of protection) within 10 days of a single oral dose. We investigated the protection conferred by
this vaccine in a human cholera challenge model.
Methods.
Consenting healthy adult volunteers, 18–45 years old, were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive 1 oral dose of vaccine
(approximately 5 × 108 colony-forming units [CFU]) or placebo in double-blind fashion. Volunteers ingested approximately 1 × 105
CFU of wild-type V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain N16961 10 days or 3 months after vaccination and were observed on an inpatient
research ward for stool output measurement and management of hydration.
Results.
The vaccine was well tolerated, with no difference in adverse event frequency among 95 vaccinees vs 102 placebo re-
cipients. The primary endpoint, moderate (≥3.0 L) to severe (≥5.0 L) diarrheal purge, occurred in 39 of 66 (59.1%) placebo controls
but only 2 of 35 (5.7%) vaccinees at 10 days (vaccine efficacy, 90.3%; P < .0001) and 4 of 33 (12.1%) vaccinees at 3 months (vaccine
efficacy, 79.5%; P < .0001).
Conclusions.
The significant vaccine efficacy documented 10 days and 3 months after 1 oral dose of PXVX0200 supports further
development as a single-dose cholera vaccine.

Cholera remains a public health problem among underprivileged
populations in many developing countries. Two oral cholera vac-
cines (OCVs) are licensed in some countries but not the United
States, where no cholera vaccine is currently available. Dukoral
(Crucell), containing inactivated Vibrio cholerae O1 with recom-
binant B subunit of cholera toxin (CT), is administered as 2 doses,
1–2 weeks apart; 3 doses are required for children 2–6 years of age.
Shanchol (Shantha), containing inactivated V. cholerae O1 and
O139, is administered as 2 doses, 2 weeks apart. Dukoral is mainly
used to immunize travelers from Europe, whereas Shanchol is in-
tended for control of cholera in developing-country populations.
For travelers on short notice to areas of intense cholera trans-
mission, an OCV that rapidly confers protection after a single
dose would be advantageous [1]. Such a vaccine would also be
useful for reactive mass vaccination to control cholera in explo-
sive unsettled “virgin soil” epidemics where administering >1
dose is logistically challenging [2].
CVD 103-HgR is a live attenuated V. cholerae serogroup O1,
serotype Inaba, classical biotype strain in which the toxigenic
A1 (ADP-ribosylating) subunit of CT was deleted and only
the nontoxic, immunogenic B (binding) subunit of CT is syn-
thesized [3–5].The original manufacturer of CVD 103-HgR, the
Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute (SSVI), commercialized the
vaccine as Orochol (Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, and
several other countries) and as Mutacol (Canada) to protect
travelers, and initiated the licensure process for the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA licensure was never

 completed, as SSVI became Berna Biotech in 2000 and manu-
facture ceased when Crucell acquired Berna Biotech in 2004. In
2009, PaxVax, Inc obtained rights to redevelop CVD 103-HgR.
PXVX0200, prepared from new CVD 103-HgR master and
working cell banks, demonstrated safety and immunogenicity
results similar to the former CVD 103-HgR formulations [6].
The present study, designed with guidance from the FDA,
represents the pivotal efficacy trial for FDA licensure of
PXVX0200. We used a closely monitored human infection
model involving the ingestion of virulent V. cholerae O1 El
Tor Inaba strain N16961, 10 days or 3 months after vaccination.
The primary endpoint for efficacy was the prevention of mod-
erate (≥3.0 L) to severe (≥5.0 L) cholera diarrhea. Without re-
hydration therapy, this endpoint would represent potentially
life-threatening fluid losses, as the total adult plasma volume
approximates 3 L. To identify a possible correlate of protection,
we explored the relationship between the vibriocidal antibody
responses following vaccination and the clinical outcome of di-
arrhea following challenge.
METHODS
Study Design
This study was approved by institutional review boards at the 3
centers (Baltimore, Maryland; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Burlington,
Vermont). Written informed consent was obtained from healthy
adults 18–45 years of age screened for eligibility (shown in http://
clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01895855). Because blood group O
individuals are at higher risk for severe cholera (cholera gravis)
[7–9], the study population was enriched for blood group O vol-
unteers to assess vaccine efficacy in these high-risk hosts.
Eligible volunteers randomized (1:1) to PXVX0200 vaccine
or placebo fasted 60 minutes before and after ingesting the
blinded product. Following vaccination, daily oral temperatures
and solicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded over 7 days,
including diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, anorexia,
headache, and tiredness. The occurrence of unsolicited AEs was
recorded through 28 days after vaccination or challenge, which-
ever was later, and serious AEs through day 180. Blood was col-
lected on days 0, 7, 10, 28, and 180 for participants who were
not challenged. Volunteers challenged at day 10 postvaccination
had blood collected on days 0, 7, 10 (before challenge), 38 (28
days after challenge), and 180, while volunteers challenged 3
months postvaccination had blood collected on days 0, 7, 10,
28, 90 (before challenge), 118 (28 days after challenge), and 180.
Vaccine
Single-dose PXVX0200 sachets with lyophilized powder con-
taining approximately 5 × 108 colony-forming units (CFU) of
CVD 103-HgR were produced according to current good man-
ufacturing practice (cGMP) by PaxVax, Inc. An accompanying
buffer powder sachet contained approximately 2.5 g sodium bi-
carbonate (NaHCO3), approximately 1.6 g ascorbic acid, and
approximately 0.2 g lactose. Powders from the vaccine/buffer
sachet were suspended in 100 mL of bottled water. Placebo con-
sisted of 100 mL of normal saline.
Challenge
A target of 60% of the total challenge population was to be per-
sons of blood group O. Participants were admitted to an inpa-
tient research ward 1–2 days prior to challenge to complete the
screening process. The challenge inoculum was prepared from a
frozen cGMP lot vial containing virulent V. cholerae O1 El Tor
Inaba strain N16961 [10]. A vial was thawed and appropriately
diluted, and the inoculum size was confirmed by quantitative
counts. Subjects fasted overnight prior to the ingestion of 120 mL
of NaHCO3 solution to neutralize gastric acid followed 1 minute
later by ingestion of approximately 1 × 105 CFU of the challenge
strain suspended in 30 mL of NaHCO3 solution.
Following challenge, volunteers were closely monitored for
illness and every stool was graded: grade 1, firm; grade 2, soft;
grade 3, thick liquid; grade 4, opaque watery; and grade 5, rice
water. All stools grade 3 or greater were weighed; a gram of loose
stool was assumed to be equal to 1 mL volume. Individuals who
developed diarrhea were given glucose/electrolytes oral rehydra-
tion solution (Jianas Brothers, Kansas City, Missouri) at a vol-
ume 1.5 times the diarrheal stool volume. Participants unable to
ingest sufficient oral rehydration solution to maintain hydration
were given intravenous Lactated Ringer’s solution. Ciprofloxa-
cin, 500 mg twice daily for 5 days, was administered when a
subject reached 5.0 L of cumulative diarrheal stool output or
on day 4 postchallenge, whichever occurred first.
Definition of Diarrhea
For evaluating reactogenicity following vaccination, diarrhea
was defined as ≥4 loose stools within a 24-hour period; follow-
ing challenge, diarrhea, as an efficacy endpoint, was defined as
the passage of ≥2 loose stools (grade 3–5) over a 48-hour period
≥200 mL or a single loose stool ≥300 mL. Moderate or severe
diarrhea was defined as the passage of at least 3.0 L or 5.0 L
of loose stool, respectively.
Bacteriology
Stool specimens were inoculated onto thiosulfate citrate bile
salts sucrose (TCBS) agar plates (Eiken, Tokyo, Japan) either di-
rectly or after overnight incubation enrichment in alkaline pep-
tone water before plating onto TCBS agar. Up to 2 stools daily
were cultured to determine the number of organisms per gram
of stool [11]. A rectal swab was obtained if no stool was passed.
Suspicious colonies were agglutinated with polyvalent anti-O1
antisera (Remel, Lenexa, Kansas).
Immunology
Serum specimens were tested for classical Inaba vibriocidal an-
tibody [12, 13], with seroconversion defined as ≥4-fold rise in
titer over baseline.

 Statistical Analysis
Demonstration of efficacy, and their confidence intervals (CIs)
[14], against moderate to severe cholera (MSC) at 10
and 90 days postvaccination were the prespecified co–primary
aims. Vibriocidal antibody results are summarized by the
number and percentage of seroconversions and the geometric
mean titer (GMT) with 95% CI at each timepoint. In summa-
rizing safety, categorical endpoints were compared using Fish-
er exact test, whereas continuous endpoints were compared
using Student t test if normally distributed and Wilcoxon
rank-sum test if not normally distributed. All P values were de-
rived from 2-sided tests and P ≤ .05 was considered significant.
Demographic and safety comparisons were not adjusted for
multiplicity.
RESULTS
Participants
In total, 197 enrolled volunteers were randomized, 95 to vaccine
and 102 to placebo; 63% were male and the mean age was 31 years
(range, 18–45 years) (Table 1). Subsequently, 68 subjects were
challenged 10 days after vaccination and 66 subjects 3 months
after vaccination (consort diagram, Supplementary Figure 1). Sub-
jects selected to be challenged were prioritized based on continued
eligibility, availability, and blood type. There was no knowledge of
vibriocidal antibody response at the time of challenge.
Vaccine Safety
The vaccine was well tolerated; the frequency of diarrhea dur-
ing the 7 days after vaccine or placebo was 1.1% and 3.0%,

 respectively. There were no significant differences in the reports
of asthenia, headache, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea/vomit-
ing, fever, or diarrhea (Supplementary Table 1).
There were 23 and 35 unsolicited AEs reported by 17 vacci-
nees and 17 placebo recipients, respectively. The single severe
AE, back pain, occurred 1 day after receipt of placebo. All seri-
ous AEs were self-limited and resolved within several days, and
none were deemed to be vaccine-related. Clinical laboratory re-
sults did not indicate any safety signals.
Vaccine Immunogenicity
The overall serum Inaba vibriocidal antibody seroconversion
rate following vaccination was 90.4% (85 of 94 vaccinees),
with 84 of 85 seroconversions evident by day 10 postvaccina-
tion, when GMT peaked at 4313 (95% CI, 2873–6476; Table 2).
There was no significant difference in vibriocidal antibody sero-
conversion or GMTs between blood group O or non-O vacci-
nees. Among placebo recipients, 2 of 102 exhibited vibriocidal
seroconversion (Table 2).
Clinical Response to Challenge at 10 Days and 3 Months
Postvaccination
Challenge with virulent V. cholerae O1 elicited MSC diarrhea in
39 of 66 (59.1%) placebo recipients but in only 2 of 35 (5.7%)
vaccinees challenged at 10 days (P < .0001; efficacy 90.3%) post-
vaccination and in only 4 of 33 (12.1%) vaccinees challenged 3
months postvaccination (P < .0001; efficacy 79.5%) (Table 3).
The efficacy against MSC among the high-risk blood group O
volunteers at 10 days and 3 months was 84.8% (95% CI, 50.4%–
100%) and 78.4% (95% CI, 44.2%–100%), respectively. Inde-
pendent analyses of the 10-day and 3-month data are shown
in Supplementary Table 2.
The median volume and number of diarrheal stools and medi-
an peak stool excretion of cholera vibrios were lower among vac-
cinees challenged at 10 days (P < .0001) and 3 months (P < .0001),
compared to controls (Table 3). The incidence of fever, nausea/
vomiting, abdominal cramping, and malaise was also lower
among vaccinees challenged at 10 days and 3 months (Table 3).
Correlation of Vibriocidal Antibody Response to Clinical Outcome
There was a strong correlation between serum vibriocidal anti-
body seroconversion and protection against MSC. Only 2 of the
62 (3.2%) vaccinees who manifested ≥4-fold titer rise had MSC
vs 4 of the 6 (75%) vaccinees who failed to seroconvert
(P = .00026; Figure 1). The 2 vaccinees who developed MSC de-
spite seroconversion exhibited only modest reciprocal titers (80
and 160) postvaccination. Indeed, no vaccinee who seroconvert-
ed and achieved a day 10 titer ≥320 experienced MSC (Supple-
mentary Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
Cholera causes fear for its ability to rapidly dehydrate (leading
to hypovolemic shock and death unless rehydration is promptly
instituted), propensity for explosive outbreaks, and pandemic

 behavior. With careful organization, 2-dose OCVs can be deliv-
ered to at-risk populations preemptively. By contrast, a single-
dose vaccine is more practical for travelers and for reactive
vaccination to control explosive epidemics, particularly in un-
settled situations [2].
This study documents protection of US adults against potent
experimental cholera challenge that caused MSC diarrhea (≥3.0
L) in 59% of control subjects overall and in 69% of high-risk
blood group O controls, reproducing results observed with
the previous commercial formulation of CVD 103-HgR in
North American adults [1, 3, 15, 16]. Because travelers to
high-risk cholera areas often must leave on short notice, some
subjects were challenged a mere 10 days after vaccination and a
high level of protection (90% vaccine efficacy) was shown. This
corroborates past studies that showed efficacy within 8–10
days postvaccination [15]. Collectively, results of these multi-
ple challenges with 2 distinct commercial formulations of
CVD 103-HgR (Orochol/Mutacol and PXVX0200) constitute
convincing evidence of the vaccine’s ability to elicit protection
rapidly.
The vibriocidal antibodies manifested by immunologically
naive hosts such as North Americans following vaccination or
cholera illness are mostly immunoglobulin M [17], and decline
rapidly to approach baseline within 1–6 months [13]. Because
initial experimental cholera illness protects for ≥3 years against
rechallenge [18], the persistence of high vibriocidal antibody ti-
ters per se is not a prerequisite for protection. This study pro-
vides evidence that in immunologically naive North Americans
serum vibriocidal antibody seroconversion is a reliable correlate
of protection and may constitute a surrogate for an as yet un-
characterized mechanistic intestinal protective response [19].
Enterotoxigenic V. cholerae O1 resides in brackish water
environmental reservoirs where horizontal gene transfer can
ensue. N16961, a V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain from
Bangladesh, has been the benchmark challenge strain since
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases pre-
pared a cGMP frozen lot to allow multisite challenges with a
standardized inoculum, thereby permitting insights to be
drawn on the relative efficacy of different vaccines and formu-
lations by either concurrent or historical comparisons [10].
N16961, which expresses El Tor CT and toxin coregulated pili
(TCP), differs from many currently circulating El Tor “hybrid
strains” that express classical biotype cholera enterotoxin B sub-
unit and sometimes classical TCP [20–24]. Some hybrid strains
are hypertoxigenic in vitro [24] and may be clinically more vir-
ulent [25], thereby resembling classical biotype strains [26]. A
hybrid El Tor strain cGMP inoculum is not available for chal-
lenge studies. However, the genetic changes in the hybrid strains
should not diminish the ability of CVD 103-HgR to protect, as
it is classical biotype and encodes both classical CT B subunit
and TCP. In past challenges, a single oral dose of either CVD
103-HgR or its progenitor CVD 103 (before a gene encoding
resistance to Hg++ was inserted into the hlyA locus) conferred
significant protection against challenge with classical biotype
strains that produce classical CT, including the highly toxigenic
Ogawa 395 and Inaba 569B strains [1, 3, 15].
PXVX0200 is well tolerated and highly immunogenic in stim-
ulating vibriocidal antibody, corroborating the previous safety

 and immunogenicity record of CVD 103-HgR. A phase 3 trial of
3 different production lots of PXVX0200 (NCT02094586) and a
phase 3 trial in elderly adults (NCT02100631) are being conduct-
ed that will provide additional data assessing the clinical tolera-
bility and immunogenicity of PXVX0200 as a cholera vaccine for
travelers from the United States. Importantly for future clinical
trials in other venues and populations, serum vibriocidal sero-
conversion, an immunologic correlate that significantly predicted
protection, has been accepted by the FDA as the regulatory cri-
terion for immunologic bridging. Only a volunteer challenge
study that measures baseline and postvaccination sera from all
challenged vaccinees and records all cases following a “point-
source exposure” has the unique ability to identify seroconversion
as a correlate of protection [27]. Because the low incidence of
cholera infection in travelers makes field efficacy trials in travelers
infeasible, a placebo-controlled cholera challenge study in healthy
volunteers was the only practical way of demonstrating clinical
efficacy of the vaccine in the relevant population. If PXVX0200
is approved by the FDA, this would be the first vaccine where
demonstration of clinical efficacy was based on a challenge
study in healthy volunteers, although other national regulatory
authorities (eg, of Canada, Switzerland, Australia) licensed the
previous commercial formulation of CVD 103-HgR on efficacy
data from challenge studies. This could be a model for other trav-
el vaccines where disease incidence precludes a field efficacy trial
and no relevant animal model exists.
Previously, a formulation (Orochol E) containing 1-log high-
er dosage (109 CFU) was needed to achieve adequate immuno-
genicity in persons living in underprivileged conditions in
developing countries [28–30]. We are undertaking clinical stud-
ies with a PXVX0200 formulation containing 1-log higher CFU
for developing-country populations to assess its future utility
for reactive vaccination campaigns, preemptive curtailment of
seasonal epidemics, and protecting populations in refugee
camps and similar high-risk venues.
Two previous studies addressed the ability of Orochol E (109
CFU) to prevent cholera in developing-country subjects. A
large-scale, double-blind randomized (at the level of the indi-
vidual), placebo-controlled field trial was conducted in a dense-
ly populated cholera-hyperendemic area in North Jakarta,
Indonesia, where 33 696 participants received vaccine and
33 812 received placebo [31]. Communities with the highest in-
cidence of cholera in the previous 4 years within the endemic
subdistricts were targeted for inclusion. The overall point esti-
mate of vaccine efficacy was only 14%, over 4 years of follow-up
(1993–1997). However, following the vaccination phase of this
field trial, there was a significant fall in the number of cholera
cases in the population compared to the 4 years before the field
trial. Whereas several hundred cholera cases were expected to
occur among placebo controls during the 4 years of follow-
up, only 50 cases were detected despite intensive surveillance.
This suggested that administration of OCV to a notable
proportion of the high-risk target population had diminished
the overall risk of cholera in these areas. At the time of that
trial there was no explanation for this, as the currently appreci-
ated powerful effect of indirect protection with OCV had not yet
been reported [32, 33]. A reanalysis of the mid-1980s field trial
of inactivated OCVs in Bangladesh first elucidated the potent
indirect protection that OCVs can achieve [32].
Thus, the striking reduction of cholera cases in the North Ja-
karta field trial may be explained by the expected powerful addi-
tional effect of indirect protection. This concept of indirect
protection is now so widely accepted that for more than a decade,
large-scale randomized controlled field trials of cholera [34] and
typhoid vaccines [35, 36] have used cluster randomized study de-
signs to preclude what transpired in the North Jakarta trial [31].
A second opportunity to evaluate the ability of CVD 103-
HgR to prevent cholera occurred during a cholera epidemic
on the island of Pohnpei in Micronesia [2]. Subsequent to a re-
active mass immunization campaign using a single oral dose of
Orochol E conducted by the World Health Organization
(WHO), the incidence of suspected cholera cases was 5 times
lower among vaccinated compared with unvaccinated persons.
WHO epidemiologists estimated that 45% of the island’s popu-
lation was vaccinated and calculated 79% vaccine effectiveness
(95% CI, 72%–85%) in preventing cholera under field condi-
tions. Based on these data, there is optimism that the higher-
dosage PXVX0200 formulation may be an effective, logistically
practical means for cholera control in developing-country
populations.
Our first priority for PXVX0200 is to achieve FDA licensure
so that travelers from the United States can have access to a
cholera vaccine. Although the incidence of cholera among US
travelers is not typically high, during certain periods, as when
cholera returned to South America in 1991 after a century of
absence [37] and during the postearthquake epidemic in Haiti
[38], travel-associated US cases markedly increased. Looking to
the future, if licensed, we would encourage that PXVX0200 be
particularly targeted for at-risk travelers to endemic or epidemic
regions (especially those far from healthcare or visiting friends
or relatives [39, 40]), hosts especially vulnerable to severe chol-
era such as individuals of blood group O or with hypochlorhy-
dria (eg, from medications that suppress or neutralize gastric
acid), and persons at risk for complications, such as individuals
with cardiac or renal impairment.
