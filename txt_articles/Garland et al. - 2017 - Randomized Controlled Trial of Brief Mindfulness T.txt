BACKGROUND: Medical management of acute pain
among hospital inpatients may be enhanced by mind-
body interventions.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a single, scripted ses-
sion of mindfulness training focused on acceptance of
pain or hypnotic suggestion focused on changing pain
sensations through imagery would significantly reduce
acute pain intensity and unpleasantness compared to a
psychoeducation pain coping control. We also hypothe-
sized that mindfulness and suggestion would produce
significant improvements in secondary outcomes includ-
ing relaxation, pleasant body sensations, anxiety, and
desire for opioids, compared to the control condition.
METHODS: This three-arm, parallel-group randomized
controlled trial conducted at a university-based hospital
examined the acute effects of 15-min psychosocial inter-
ventions (mindfulness, hypnotic suggestion,
psychoeducation) on adult inpatients reporting
Bintolerable pain^ or Binadequate pain control.^ Partici-
pants (N = 244) were assigned to one of three intervention
conditions: mindfulness (n = 86), suggestion (n = 73), or
psychoeducation (n = 85).
KEY RESULTS: Participants in the mind-body interven-
tions reported significantly lower baseline-adjusted pain
intensity post-intervention than those assigned to
psychoeducation (p < 0.001, percentage pain reduction:
mindfulness = 23%, suggestion = 29%, education = 9%),
and lower baseline-adjusted pain unpleasantness
(p < 0.001). Intervention conditions differed significantly
with regard to relaxation (p < 0.001), pleasurable body
sensations (p = 0.001), and desire for opioids (p = 0.015),
but all three interventions were associated with a signifi-
cant reduction in anxiety (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Brief, single-session mind-body inter-
ventions delivered by hospital social workers led to clini-
cally significant improvements in pain and related out-
comes, suggesting that such interventions may be useful
adjuncts to medical pain management.

INTRODUCTION
Half of all inpatients experience acute pain during hospitali-
zation.1, 2 Effective hospital-based pain management is com-
promised by a number of barriers, including patient perceived
helplessness, lack of education and non-pharmacological in-
terventions, and significant time delay in analgesic adminis-
tration.3 Poorly managed acute pain can lead to increased
hospitalization costs,3 reduced patient satisfaction,4 and risk
of persistent pain.5 For alleviation of pain, more than half of
patients in the U.S. are treated with opioids during hospitali-
zation,6 and 2–14% of these patients experience at least one
opioid-related adverse event.7 Further, opioid receipt in the
hospital is associated with a nearly fivefold increase in the
odds of chronic opioid use 12 months after discharge.8
As opioid-related deaths and opioid addiction continue to
climb, national efforts to stem the opioid epidemic underscore
the need for non-pharmacological interventions for pain man-
agement. Psychological factors including maladaptive cogni-
tions (e.g., catastrophizing, fear of pain) and negative emo-
tions can exacerbate pain perception via cortico-limbic brain
circuitry,9–11 providing a mechanistic basis for the potential
efficacy of psychosocial interventions for acute pain. Al-
though logistical constraints pose a challenge to the provision
of integrated inpatient medical and psychological services,
social workers may provide psychosocial support to allay pain
and distress among inpatients. As such, the present study
examined the acute impact of three brief psychosocial inter-
ventions provided by hospital social workers: mindfulness
training, hypnotic suggestion, and psychoeducation.
Mindfulness consists in cultivating metacognitive awareness
and acceptance of thoughts, feelings, and sensations.12 Ran-
domized trials indicate that mindfulness alleviates pain by fa-
cilitating a shift from affective to sensory processing of pain
sensations13 and reducing thalamic amplification of nociceptive

 signals via prefrontal cognitive control mechanisms.14 Brief
mindfulness interventions have been reported to reduce
experimentally-induced pain in the laboratory,15, 16 but have
not been studied for acute clinical pain in hospital settings. By
contrast, suggestive interventions have been shown to reduce
pain and distress in the hospital.17 These interventions consist in
providing suggestions to modify thoughts, emotions, and sen-
sations. Meta-analysis indicates that suggestive interventions,
including hypnosis and suggestion without hypnotic induction,
result in significant, small effect size reductions in postoperative
pain and anxiety.18 Psychoeducational interventions have also
been shown to improve coping in hospital settings.19 No study
to date has examined the efficacy of mindfulness and hypnotic
suggestion compared to psychoeducation for hospital inpatients
with intolerable pain. Moreover, it is not known whether a
single session of mindfulness or hypnosis is of sufficient dose
to outperform an active control in reducing acute clinical pain
and secondary outcomes such as desire for opioids and anxiety.
The present study addresses these knowledge gaps.
We hypothesized that a single session of mindfulness or
hypnotic suggestion would significantly reduce acute pain
intensity and unpleasantness compared to a psychoeducation
control condition. We also hypothesized that mindfulness and
suggestion would produce significant increases in relaxation
and pleasant body sensations, and reduce anxiety and desire
for opioids, compared to the control condition.
METHODS
Trial Design and Randomization
This was a single-site, three-arm, parallel-group randomized
controlled trial (RCT). The randomization sequence was gener-
ated by computer before the start of the trial via simple random
allocation to the study conditions. The principal investigator
(E.G.), who directed the randomization, was provided with
random numbers to assign to a condition, and he never
interacted with participants before or after assignment to a
condition. Individuals were the unit of randomization. The
University of Utah institutional review board approved all pro-
cedures. Participants provided informed consent after reviewing
an informed consent cover letter with study personnel.
Setting and Participants
The study was conducted in Salt Lake City from October 2015
through October 2016. The hospital where the study took
place had historically performed below the national average
in patient ratings of their acute pain management when com-
pared to other academic medical centers, prompting providers
at this institution to seek new non-opioid options for address-
ing acute pain. English-speaking adult inpatients (≥18 years)
at a public hospital reporting Bintolerable pain^ or Binadequate
pain control^ (on the Clinically Aligned Pain Assessment
tool,20 a clinical assessment of pain employed at this
hospital) were included in this trial. Patients with altered
mental status due to delirium, psychosis, or pharmacological
sedation as determined by nursing assessment were excluded.
Potential participants were screened for eligibility via medical
record review and asked by clinical social workers whether
they were interested in receiving psychosocial pain manage-
ment services as part of a research evaluation.
Procedures
Consenting participants (who were pre-randomized to inter-
vention condition via simple random allocation) then privately
completed a brief self-report assessment of patient-reported
outcomes (PROs), consisting of validated numeric rating
scales (0–10) of pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, relaxa-
tion, pleasurable body sensations, and desire for opioids.
Following this PRO assessment, participants received one of
three 15-min psychosocial interventions delivered by a clinical
social worker, after which they privately completed the same
self-report assessment to assess patient-reported outcomes
during the period immediately following the intervention.
Social workers and participants were not blinded. Participants
were not compensated for their participation.
Interventions
Mindfulness Training. The mindfulness intervention consisted
in a single, scripted 15-min training session in focused attention
on breathing and body sensations, with concomitant
metacognitive monitoring and acceptance of discursive
thoughts, negative emotions, and pain. This mindfulness script
(see supplementary materials) closely followed a mindfulness
induction script validated in prior mindfulness research.21
Hypnotic Suggestion. The suggestion intervention consisted
in a single, scripted 15-min self-hypnosis session which invit-
ed patients to roll their eyes upward, close their eyes, and
breathe deeply, focus on sensations of floating, and imagine
the visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile details of a pleasant
scene of their choosing. The script provided suggestions for
transforming pain into sensations of warmth, coolness, or
tingling. This script closely followed a standardized self-
hypnotic induction script (see supplementary materials) vali-
dated in prior research on self-hypnosis during acute medical
procedures.22 The mindfulness and hypnotic suggestion
scripts were exactly equal in number of words.
Psychoeducation. The psychoeducation condition consisted
in a single 15-min session in which a social worker provided
empathic responses to the patient and then attempted to in-
crease perception of pain control by reviewing common be-
havioral pain coping strategies (e.g., stretching, using hot and
cold compresses). The psychoeducation condition followed a
pain coping education brochure utilized throughout the uni-
versity hospital.

 Study interventions were implemented by clinical social
workers, each of whom was trained to deliver all three inter-
ventions throughout the study. Training comprised 3 h of
instruction in empathic responses, mindfulness, and hypnotic
suggestion under the supervision of the first author, a clinician
with more than 10 years of experience in providing mind-body
interventions for patients with pain in medical settings.
Outcome and Assessments
Self-assessments were administered immediately before and
after the intervention, which comprised a 15-min interval.
Primary outcomes of pain intensity and unpleasantness were
measured with two items rated on a numeric rating scale (0–
10)—a widely used and validated approach to measuring
clinical pain.23 Participants who reported ≥30% reduction in
pain intensity were identified as Bresponders^ based on a
validated threshold for Bmoderate clinical benefit^ identified
in best practice guidelines for pain research.24 Secondary
outcomes were measured via validated single items assessing
relaxation,25 anxiety,22 pleasant body sensations,26 and desire
for opioids,27 all rated on a numeric rating scale (0–10) to
minimize patient confusion. There was no follow-up measure
of potential impacts of the brief interventions, because we
reasoned that no residual benefit of a single intervention
session could be expected multiple hours, days, or weeks later.
Power Calculation
A priori power analysis was conducted in G*Power. An esti-
mated total sample size of 244 was needed to detect an overall
between-group effect on baseline-adjusted post-treatment pain
(f = 0.20, or of small size) with 80% power, two-sided
p < 0.05.28
Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis testing was conducted via SPSS version 23 soft-
ware (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) using an analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) strategy29 for primary (i.e., pain in-
tensity and pain unpleasantness) and secondary outcomes
(anxiety, relaxation, pleasant body sensations, desire for opi-
oids), adjusted for baseline differences. In accordance with a
classical ANCOVA approach for analyzing clinical trial out-
comes,29 co-varying of baseline values ensures that compari-
sons of post-intervention values by treatment group are inde-
pendent of baseline differences. In ANCOVA models, post-
intervention values of outcome variables were regressed on
intervention group (mindfulness or suggestion vs. education
control) after co-varying pre-intervention values. We used
linear mixed models with random intercepts under maximum
likelihood estimation for intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of
the entire randomized sample. Because opioids might influ-
ence pain outcomes, we also controlled for morphine equiva-
lent daily dose (calculated via the Washington State Agency
Medical Directors’ Group opioid dose calculator) in the 24-h
period prior to intervention as a covariate in a sensitivity
analysis. Because significant between-group differences in
gender were observed (see Table 1), we controlled for partic-
ipant gender as a covariate in a sensitivity analysis. Though
this study was not powered to be a comparative effectiveness
or non-inferiority trial with respect to the two mind-body
interventions (mindfulness vs. hypnotic suggestion), we con-
ducted exploratory post hoc contrasts to test for between-
group differences. Multiple comparisons were adjusted using
the Bonferroni-Holm method.
RESULTS
Participant Flow and Characteristics
Participant flow through enrollment, randomization, and anal-
ysis phases of the trial is shown in Figure 1. Of 784 potential
patients screened for eligibility, over the course of 1 year, 244
individuals were deemed eligible, agreed to participate, and
were assigned to one of the intervention conditions: mindful-
ness (n = 86), suggestion (n = 73), or psychoeducation
(n = 85). Differences in random allocation were purely due
to random chance. Among the most common reasons for
exclusion were patients who declined to participate (n = 117)
or were discharged (n = 161), those whose pain was relieved
(n = 108), or those who were unavailable due to medical
procedures (n = 80) at the time of study contact. No adverse
events related to participation in the study were reported.
Table 1 lists the summary descriptive statistics for the
groups at baseline. None of the baseline variables differed
across intervention conditions by chance (p > 0.05), ex-
cept for gender (p = 0.003). By chance, fewer female
participants were assigned to the suggestion condition
(41%) than the mindfulness (66%) or education (62%)
conditions. The mean (SD) age of participants was 51.1
(SD = 16.6 years, range 18–93 years), and 57% (140 of
244) were female. The mean pre-intervention (SD) pain
intensity rating of 5.5 (2.7) indicated a sample with mod-
erate or greater pain level. By chance, participants in the
psychoeducation condition had lower pre-intervention
pain scores than those randomized to the other conditions,
though this difference was not statistically significant,
F(2,237) = 1.98, p = 0.14. Examination of International
Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnostic category
indicated that at the time of enrollment, the majority of
study participants were receiving medical treatment for
injuries (18%), followed by diseases of the digestive sys-
tem (13%), musculoskeletal system (12%), and circulatory
system (8%), and infectious diseases (7%), among others.
Four participants did not complete the intervention
and were missing post-intervention data (see Fig. 1 for
CONSORT diagram). Those lost to post-intervention
assessment showed pain ratings statistically equivalent
1108

JGIM
 to those of the retained sample, indicating that the level
of pain was independent of dropout. Given the few
missing data points (< 2% missing for any outcome
variable), we conducted ANCOVA for analyses of the
treated sample (N = 240), and used linear mixed models
for intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses of the entire ran-
domized sample (N = 244). Within-group effects are
reported in Table 2.
Primary Outcome
The ANCOVA model for pain severity revealed a sta-
tistically significant effect of intervention condition
(p < 0.001, η2
partial = 0.07), with participants assigned
to mindfulness (B = −0.78, p = 0.001, 95% CI: −1.23,
−0.33) and suggestion (B = −0.91, p < 0.001, 95% CI:
−1.38, −0.45) reporting significantly lower baseline-
adjusted pain severity post-intervention than those
assigned to the education condition (see Fig. 2). We
observed significant mean reductions in pain intensity
ratings during mindfulness meditation (23%; p < 0.001,
d = 0.43), suggestion (29%; p < 0.001, d = 0.48), and
education conditions (9%; p = 0.009, d = 0.12). Inter-
vention conditions significantly differed in the propor-
tion of Bresponders^ who achieved at least a clinically
significant 30% reduction in pain intensity, χ2 = 11.56,
p = 0.003, with 27%, 39%, and 15% of responders in
the mindfulness, suggestion, and education conditions,
respectively. Though the mindfulness and suggestion
groups did not significantly differ in morphine equiva-
lent dose in the 24 h prior to intervention, the presence
of sizable mean differences in opioid dosing suggested
that pre-intervention differences in this variable should
be controlled in a sensitivity analysis along with partic-
ipant gender. In this sensitivity analysis, intervention
condition remained a significant predictor of baseline-
adjusted pain severity (p < 0.001, η2
partial = 0.11).
The ANCOVA model for pain unpleasantness revealed a
statistically significant effect of intervention condition
(p < 0.001, η2
partial = 0.10), with participants assigned to
mindfulness (B = −1.31, p < 0.001, 95% CI: −1.84, −0.78)
and suggestion (B = −1.03, p < 0.001, 95% CI: −1.59, −0.47)
reporting significantly lower baseline-adjusted pain un-
pleasantness post-intervention than those assigned to edu-
cation (see Fig. 3).
ITT analysis through linear mixed modeling including all
randomized participants identified significant effects of inter-
vention condition on pain intensity (p < 0.001) and pain
unpleasantness (p < 0.001).

 Secondary Outcomes
The ANCOV
A models for relaxation (p < 0.001, η2
partial = 0.08),
pleasant body sensations (p = 0.001, η2
partial = 0.06), and desire
for opioids (p = 0.015, η2
partial = 0.04) revealed statistically
significant effects of intervention condition. Post hoc contrasts
revealed that participants assigned to mindfulness and suggestion
reported significantly higher baseline-adjusted relaxation
(p < 0.001) and pleasurable body sensations (p < 0.001) than
those assigned to the education condition. In contrast, participants
in the suggestion condition reported significantly lower desire for
opioids than those in the education condition (p = 0.004), where-
as participants assigned to mindfulness did not (p = 0.19). There
was no significant between-group difference in anxiety, (p = 0.15,
η2
partial = 0.02), though participants across all three intervention
conditions reported a significant decrease in anxiety (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION
Findings indicate that a single, scripted 15-min session of
mindfulness training or hypnotic suggestion delivered in the
hospital setting can result in immediate reductions in acute
pain intensity. Though the mean pain reduction was modest in
size, approximately one-third of patients treated with mind-
body interventions achieved at least a 30% reduction in pain
intensity—a clinically significant level of pain relief compa-
rable to 5 mg oxycodone.30 Mind-body interventions pro-
duced ancillary benefits, including improvements in pain un-
pleasantness and relaxation. Though all three interventions
reduced anxiety, the palliative effects of mind-body therapies
exceeded those derived from psychoeducation.
Hypothetically, brief mindfulness training and hypnotic
suggestion produce therapeutic benefits via unique and

*Reasons for exclusion were as follows: patient had a cognitive impairment, was discharged before study assessment and intervention could be
initiated, was unavailable or uncooperative, was under age 18, had a language barrier, was a prisoner, denied experiencing pain at the time of
the intervention, was intubated, or had a hearing impairment.

 overlapping mechanisms of action. Whereas mindfulness is a
self-regulatory process that purportedly relieves pain by fos-
tering non-reactive acceptance of aversive somatovisceral sen-
sations and attendant negative emotions, hypnotic suggestion
is usually delivered by a facilitator and employs visual, kines-
thetic, and interoceptive imagery to alter the pain sensations
themselves. These differences in psychological mechanism
may parallel neuroimaging findings demonstrating that mind-
fulness alleviates acute pain intensity by increasing activation
in the cingulate and insular cortices, whereas both mindfulness
and hypnosis alleviate pain intensity by decreasing activation
of somatosensory cortical representations of pain.15,31 More
mechanistic research is needed to elucidate commonalities and
differences between these two types of mind-body therapy for
relief of acute clinical pain.
The study had some limitations. First, without follow-up
data, the duration of the observed therapeutic effects is un-
known, although it is unlikely that a brief single-session inter-
vention would result in long-lasting pain relief. Additional
research is needed to determine whether effects can be
prolonged or intensified with larger or repeated doses. Second,
the suggestion and mindfulness interventions contained some
overlapping instructions for focused attention and monitoring
of body sensations, including a similar introduction that
framed both interventions as a form of Bconcentration^; this
overlap was intended to engender similar levels of perceived
credibility between the two experimental conditions. Overlap
between these two mind-body interventions is practically in-
evitable, given that both techniques involve attention regula-
tion.32 The mind-body interventions in this study differed in

 their emphasis on acceptance of versus change in pain
sensations.
Third, the psychoeducation condition in the present study
controlled for non-specific therapeutic factors (e.g., attention
from a caring professional), but did not completely control for
the possibility that the observed effects of mind-body inter-
ventions might be due to placebo or suggestibility.
Psychoeducation was associated with significant reductions
in pain intensity that were comparable to those achieved by
placebo as reported in a systematic review of opioid analgesic
trials,30 suggesting that placebo effects may have played a role
in any of the three interventions. This study did not include a
sham, and we were unable to assess for suggestibility because
of the need to minimize subject burden. To reduce the influ-
ence of expectations with respect to mindfulness and hypnotic
suggestion, we informed participants only that the study was
designed to test the effects of psychosocial support on acute
pain. Not highlighting mindfulness and suggestion in the study
information and introducing the techniques with the same
language may have attenuated between-groups differences in
participant expectations, though we cannot know this is the
case in the absence of direct measurement of therapeutic
expectancy. It is possible that patients who expected the most
benefit self-selected into the study, whereas those with low
expectations declined to participate. Limited participation in
the present study might also reflect low acceptability of mind-
body therapies among certain religious and cultural groups.
Additional screening may be needed to select patients whose
beliefs do not conflict with such therapies.
Fourth, the study was limited in that the hypnotic sugges-
tion condition was not hypnosis per se—it was not delivered
by hypnotherapists, and was a scripted self-hypnosis protocol
that lacked patient-tailored, formal hypnotic induction. None-
theless, we opted for a highly reproducible, pragmatic ap-
proach that could be exported to a medical setting without
experts in hypnosis. That said, study interventionists were
trained by a mind-body therapy expert certified in clinical
hypnosis; such expertise may not be available in all medical
settings, thereby limiting study generalizability.
Lastly, the study was not powered to investigate the com-
parative efficacy of mindfulness vs. hypnotic suggestion. Af-
ter dose-response studies identify optimal dosing for larger
and longer-lasting effects, future adequately powered head-to-
head trials could reveal the differential outcomes of these two
mind-body therapies.
CONCLUSIONS
Delivery of a single, scripted, brief mind-body intervention
session by clinical social workers with minimal training pro-
duced immediate benefits for hospitalized patients reporting
unmanageable pain. As such, scripted mind-body interven-
tions may be a useful adjunct to inpatient pain management,
and might be cost-effectively integrated into standard medical
care. Our study strongly suggests that the role of clinical social
workers needs to be expanded to include provision of mind-
body therapies in healthcare settings.
