Mutational processes underlie cancer initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes
in cancer genomes may explain cancer etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic
value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of cancer-associated
mutational signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes
in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We
found that mutation accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene MLH1
is driven by replication errors and accurately models the mutation profiles observed in
mismatch repair–deficient colorectal cancers. Application of this strategy to the cancer
predisposition gene NTHL1, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a
mutational footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast cancer cohort. We
show that signature 30 can arise from germline NTHL1 mutations.
C
ancer arises through the sequential accu-
mulation of mutations in somatic cells. The
overall mutational burden of somatic cells
is determined by a balance between DNA
damage and repair activity. Mutational
processes leave specific signatures, as defined
by systematic analysis of mutation characteristics
across many independent cancer sequencing data
sets (1). A recent study showed that a set of mu-
tational signatures in genome-wide mutation col-
lections of breast cancers predicts deficiency of
BRCA1 and BRCA2, as well as sensitivity to PARP
[poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase]
inhibition (2). To date, the main approach to link
specificmutationalsignaturestounderlyingmolec-
ular mechanisms has involved associating cancer
mutations with defined exposures to carcinogens,
such as tobacco smoke (3) and ionizing radiation
(4), or with the absence of specific DNA repair
proteins, such as components of the DNA mis-
match repair (MMR) (1) and nucleotide excision
repair (NER) pathways (5). However, multiple
processes are simultaneously active in tumors
with highly unstable genomes, which makes it
difficult to causally link the presence of specific
mutational signatures to DNA repair deficiency.
Organoid technology allows for the long-term
in vitro expansion of epithelial tissues, starting
from a single adult stem cell. Such organoids re-
main genetically stable over long periods of time
(6). We have previously shown that clonal organ-
oid cultures can be used for in-depth pattern anal-
ysis of mutations that accumulate throughout
life in tissue-specific adult stem cells (7, 8). More-
over, organoids can be readily modified using
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (9). Mammalian
species differ greatly in their DNA repair capacity
and will thus respond differently to mutagenic
stress (10, 11), and mutation types and numbers
will vary over a lifetime (7). We used CRISPR-
Cas9 genome editing in human intestinal organoid
cultures to systematically decipher the mutational
consequences of DNA repair deficiency.
To establish a tool for dissecting mutational
signatures in human organoid cultures, we in-
troduced loss-of-function mutations in the MMR
gene MutL homolog 1 (MLH1). Inactivating mu-
tations in MMR genes, including MLH1, pre-
dispose people to colorectal cancer (12, 13). These
tumors are characterized by an immense muta-
tional load, such as base substitutions and small
insertions and deletions (INDELs) at short repeat
sequences in the genome, referred to as micro-
satellite instability (MSI) (13). We used organoids
derived from human normal colon epithelium,
because this allowed us to study the effect of dis-
ruptionof single DNA repairgenes in anotherwise
normal genetic background. Moreover, human
colonic organoids are as close as possible to the
cell-of-origin of colorectal cancer (14). To inactivate
MLH1 in normal human colonic organoids, we used
CRISPR-Cas9 technology to insert a puromycin-
resistance cassette into the second exon of the
MLH1 gene (Fig. 1A and fig. S1A). After puromycin
selection, we clonally expanded single organoids
and subsequently genotyped these to confirm cor-
rect biallelic targeting (figs. S1, A and B, and S2A).
Gene inactivation was verified by quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR), revealing a substantial reduction
in MLH1 mRNA expression in MLH1 knockout
(MLH1KO) organoids, most likely due to the deg-
radation (through nonsense-mediated decay) of
nonsense mRNAs transcribed from the mutant
alleles (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis confirmed
the loss of MLH1 protein expression in the MLH1KO
organoids (Fig. 1E).
Next, we passaged the MLH1KO and parental
normal human colon organoids for 2 months to
allow cells to accumulate sufficient mutations re-
quired for downstream analyses (fig. S1C). We
then used flow cytometry to establish subclonal
cultures of single cells (fig. S1C) and expanded
these until sufficient DNA could be obtained (7).
Both clonal and subclonal cultures were subjected
to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analyses to
identify the mutations that accumulated between
the two clonal expansion steps and to correlate
their appearance with time (Fig. 2A). As expected,
MLH1KO organoids showed an increased base
substitution load (27.7 ± 4.9 mutations per genome
per day) compared with normal organoids (3.8 ±
1.2 mutations per genome per day), as well as a
change in type of base substitutions (increase in
C>T transitions). Similarly, the MLH1KO organoids
displayed an increased number of INDELs (Fig.
2A), which were predominantly single–base-pair
deletions (Fig. 2B) at mononucleotide repeats
(Fig. 2C). This confirmed that deletion of MLH1
is sufficient to generate the mutator phenotype
observed in MMR-deficient tumors. As expected,
we did not observe an increase in structural
variations.
Somatic mutations are unevenly distributed
throughout the genomes of most cancers (15, 16)
and normal adult stem cells (7). In general, base
substitutions are more frequent in heterochro-
matic and late-replicating regions of the genome.
It has been reported that specific DNA repair ac-
tivity, including MMR (17) and NER (18), under-
lies this variation in regional mutation rates, as
tumors lacking essential components of either
of these DNA repair pathways show a less biased
genomic distribution. To directly test this, we per-
formed a genome-wide analysis of replication
timing (Repli-seq) (19) on human intestinal organ-
oids. We defined early, intermediate, and late
replicating genomic regions and determined the
relationship between somatic mutational load
and replication timing. As observed in most can-
cers (16), in vitro–accumulated mutations in
normal organoids were more frequent in late-
replicating DNA (Fig. 3A). This bias was no longer
present in MLH1KO cells, in line with the notion
that MMR might be more active in euchromatic
early-replicating regions of the genome, thereby
creating variation in regional mutation rates (17).

 However, when we compared the absolute mu-
tational loads in the genomic regions with dif-
ferent replication timing, we found that all regions
(not only euchromatic early-replicating regions)
showed increased mutation numbers (Fig. 3A).
Thus, additional mutagenic processes might be
active in the MLH1KO cells that increase mutation-
al load throughout the genome, thereby removing
the bias in genomic distribution.
By removing part of the newly synthesized
strand, MMR is able to repairs errors—such as
base-base mismatches and insertion and/or de-
letion loops at simple repeats—that are intro-
duced by DNA replication polymerases (20).
MLH1KO cells are characterized by increased
levels of both base substitutions and INDELs at
simple repeats (Fig. 2). An imbalance in muta-
tion incorporation can arise between the leading
and lagging strands during DNA replication, be-
cause different DNA polymerases are used with
distinct fidelities and proofreading capacities. Ad-
ditionally, the lagging strand is exposed longer
as single-stranded DNA, which is chemically less
stable than double-stranded DNA and may thus
be more vulnerable to accumulate damage (21).
To define leading and lagging strands to test for
replication strand asymmetry, we determined the
location of replication origins using the Repli-seq
data. We observed a significant replication strand
asymmetry in MLH1KO cells for C>A, C>G, C>T,
and T>C substitutions (P < 0.05, two-sided Poisson
test) that was not observed in normal cells (Fig.
3B). MSI colorectal tumors, typically resulting
from damage to the MMR system, show similar
replicative asymmetry (21). Without functional
MMR, the DNA polymerase errors cannot be re-
solved. Therefore, the additional mutagenic pro-
cess that is active throughout the entire genome
of MLH1KO cells may represent stochastic mis-
takes by DNA replication polymerases, which were
previously suggested to be important in muta-
tion accumulation in human cancers (22).
We next extracted mutational signatures (fig.
S3) and compared them to those described in
the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer
(COSMIC) database, using cosine similarity as
a measure of closeness (1, 23). As we previously
reported (7), normal organoids typically show a
contribution of a mutational signature that
resemblesCOSMICsignature18(cosinesimilarity=
0.870), which is characterized by C>A transver-
sions. Recently, a similar signature was described
to be associated with 8-oxoguanine mutagenesis
(24). In contrast, MLH1KO organoids were char-
acterized by the predominant occurrence of a
signature that resembles COSMIC signature 20
(cosine similarity = 0.792), suggesting that this
signature reflects mistakes made by polymerases
during normal DNA replication. As human intes-
tinal stem cells divide approximately once every
day (fig. S4), we estimate that ~25 replication er-
rors occur per cell division, which are largely re-
solved by MMR in normal cells (Fig. 4A). Next,
we determined the cosine similarity between
the mutational profile of each sample and each
COSMIC signature, which reflects how well the
mutational profile of a sample can be explained by
each signature individually. We included genome-
wide mutation data obtained by analysis of indi-
vidual cancer cells (expanded as clonal organoids
before sequencing) from colon cancers derived
from three different patients (materials and meth-
ods). One of these cancers is driven by MLH1 pro-
moter hypermethylation and therefore lacks MMR
activity, whereas the other two cancers are MMR

 proficient. Mutation accumulation in our MLH1KO
organoids closely resembled that of MMR-deficient
cancercellsandwasmarkedlydifferentfromMMR-
proficient cancer cells (Fig. 4B).
As our organoid-targeting strategy allowed us
to define a very clean mutational signature for
MMR deficiency, we next set out to determine
signatures caused by deficiency in base excision
repair (BER), the role of which in generating
cancer-causing mutations is less well established
than that of MMR deficiency. To this end, we
inactivated the BER gene NTHL1, which encodes
a DNA glycosylase that is involved in the removal
of oxidized pyrimidines through initiation of the
BER pathway (25, 26) (Fig. 1B and figs. S1A and
S2B). Germline homozygous mutations in NTHL1
were recently shown to cause adenomatous pol-
yposis and colorectal cancer (27). Upon gene tar-
geting, we confirmed the loss of NTHL1 expression
by qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1D)andWestern blotting
(Fig. 1F). Because we expected a lower mutation
frequency with BER deficiency as compared with
MMR deficiency (27), we cultured the NTHL1KO
clones for 3 months and subsequently generated
subclonal cultures and used WGS to analyze the
mutations that specifically accumulated between
the two clonal expansion steps (fig. S1C). As ex-
pected, the base substitution accumulation rate
in NTHL1KO cells was approximately one-fourth
of that in MLH1KO cells but approximately two
times higher than in normal cells (Fig. 2A). Loss
of NTHL1 did not result in increased numbers of
INDELs (Fig. 2A) or structural variation.
In contrast to MLH1KO cells, NTHL1KO cells
retained a nonrandom distribution of mutations
throughout the genome, as observed for normal
cells (Fig. 3A). Signature 30, characterized by
C>T transitions, was the main contributor to
the mutation spectrum observed in NTHL1KO
cells (Fig. 4A and fig. S3C). Of note, somatic mu-
tation analysis in the NTHL1KO clones did not
reveal any nonsynonymous or stop-gain muta-
tions in other DNA repair genes (table S1), sup-
porting the notion that the observed change in
mutation accumulation can be solely attributed
to NTHL1 deficiency. In agreement with the ob-
servations on the NTHL1KO clones (Fig. 2A), it
was reported previously that colorectal cancers
from individuals with biallelic NTHL1 germline
mutations predominantly show C>T transitions
in their exomes (27, 28). Signature 30 has pre-
viously been identified in one patient with breast
cancer (PD13297a) analyzed by WGS (29). We ex-
amined tumor and germline sequences of this
patient and identified a germline nonsense muta-
tion in NTHL1 (Fig. 4C), compounded by loss of
heterozygosity in the tumor. This observation
further corroborates the link between NTHL1
deficiency and signature 30. Mutation accumu-
lation in our NTHL1KO organoids closely resem-
bled that in PD13297a (Fig. 4B).
We have shown that mutational signatures can
be dissected by characterizing the genomic land-
scapes of genetically modified human organoid
subclones. Engineered MLH1KO organoids vali-
dated our approach, as they accurately model the

 deficient colorectal cancers. We subsequently
used our approach to demonstrate that a high
contribution of signature 30 mutations within
a tumor can be indicative of cancer-predisposing
germline mutations in the base excision repair
gene NTHL1. A similar strategy could be exploited
to investigate the consequences of other BER
gene deficiencies. Although signature 30 has been
previously identified in one patient of a large
breast cancer cohort, it may be indicative of pre-
disposition to a broader range of cancer types.
NTHL1 germline mutations appear to predispose
people to multiple cancer types, including colo-
rectal and breast cancer (27, 28). The strategy we
have described can be used to study the muta-
tional consequences of DNA repair knockouts or
mutagen exposure, to systematically dissect mu-
tational signatures and potentially unveil their
molecular origins.

for each genotype. Different mutation types and the direct sequence context
are indicated. (Right) Number of mutations per genome per day that can
be explained by the indicated mutational signatures for each genotype.
(B) Heat map showing the cosine similarity scores for each indicated sample
and COSMIC signature. The samples have been clustered according to the
similarity score with each signature. The signatures have been ordered
according to their similarity, such that very similar signatures cluster together.
Arrows indicate signatures that have been associated with deficiency in
DNA MMR in pan-cancer analyses (1). MSI, microsatellite instability.
(C) Mutations that have been introduced or identified in NTHL1. The blue
diamond indicates the site where the selection marker was introduced by
gene targeting in the organoids. The red diamond denotes the nonsense
germline mutation that was identified in a patient with breast cancer
(PD13297a). LOH, loss of heterozygosity.
