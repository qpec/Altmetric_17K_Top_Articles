Introduction
Xenoestrogens are a class of synthetic estro-
gens known as endocrine-disrupting chemi-
cals that bind to estrogen receptors in cells 
to mimic or antagonize the action of endog-
enous estrogens, such as 17β-estradiol (E2) 
(Zoeller et al. 2012). Numerous xenoes-
trogens are found in common household 
products, including plastics, food and soda 
cans, and personal-care products. One class 
of xenoestrogens that is of increasing public 
health concern is esters of para 
hydroxy-
benzoic acid, commonly known as parabens 
(Nohynek et al. 2013; Karpuzoglu et al. 
2013). These compounds are common ingre-
dients in cosmetics, shampoos, body lotions, 
and sunscreens, where they are used to 
prevent microbial growth and prolong shelf 
life (Dodson et al. 2012; Guo and Kannan 
2013). Detectable levels of multiple parabens 
are present in human urine (Calafat et al. 
2010; Den Hond et al. 2013; Mortensen 
et al. 2014) and breast tissue (Barr et al. 2012; 
Darbre et al. 2004; Darbre and Harvey 2014).
Endocrine-disrupting chemicals have 
been linked to a variety of medical conditions; 
one of the most troubling is their association 
with breast cancer (Darbre and Harvey 2008; 
Vandenberg et al. 2012; Zoeller et al. 2012). 
Endogenous estrogens promote breast cancer 
by binding to estrogen receptor α (ERα) 
(Burns and Korach 2012; Sommer and Fuqua 
2001), which causes the activation of onco-
genes, such as c-Myc and cyclin D1 (Leygue 
et al. 1995; Liao and Dickson 2000). Cyclin 
D1 and c-Myc cause cell proliferation by facili-
tating a G1 to S-phase transition (Foster et al. 
2001). Approximately two-thirds of breast 
tumors express ERα, and therapeutic strategies 
aimed at preventing and treating ER-positive 
breast tumors are directed at blocking the 
action of ERα. Parabens are known to bind 
to ERα (Routledge et al. 1998), promote a 
G1 to S-phase cell cycle progression, stimu-
late the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer 
cells (Darbre et al. 2003; Okubo et al. 2001; 
Wróbel and Gregoraszczuk 2013), and 
activate transcription of cell cycle (Wróbel 
and Gregoraszczuk 2014) and reporter genes 
(Darbre et al. 2003; Gomez et al. 2005). 
These findings indicate that paraben exposure 
might increase the risk of breast cancer by 
activating ERα to promote the activation of 
proliferative genes. However, parabens are 
considered to be safe because of their weak 
estrogenic binding affinity, transcriptional 
activation, and stimulation of cell prolifera-
tion. Furthermore, the dose required for ERα 
activation often exceeds the amount found in 
the body (Lemini et al. 2003; Pugazhendhi 
et al. 2005). The most estrogenic paraben, 
butylparaben, was found to be 10,000-fold 
less potent than E2 (Routledge et al. 1998). 
However, studies involving xenoestrogens 
have tested them in the absence of activators 
of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 
(HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases 
(Wróbel and Gregoraszczuk 2013, 2014), a 
second signaling pathway implicated in breast 
cancer (Liu et al. 2009).
The HER family comprises four recep-
tors: EGFR/HER1, ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3/
HER3, and ErbB4/HER4 (Davoli et al. 
2010). HER2 is a transmembrane protein 
that is overexpressed in ~25% of breast 
tumors (Davoli et al. 2010). Its presence 
in human tumors is a negative prognostic 
indicator because it is associated with 
malignant transformation, fast growth, and 
more aggressive tumors (Barros et al. 2010; 
Davoli et al. 2010). The association between 
HER2 expression and breast cancer led 
to the development of the drug Herceptin® 
(trastuzumab), a recombinant humanized 
monoclonal antibody against HER2, to 
treat HER2-positive tumors (Hudis 2007).

Background: Xenoestrogens are synthetic compounds that mimic endogenous estrogens by 
binding to and activating estrogen receptors. Exposure to estrogens and to some xenoestrogens has 
been associated with cell proliferation and an increased risk of breast cancer. Despite evidence of 
estrogenicity, parabens are among the most widely used xenoestrogens in cosmetics and personal-
care products and are generally considered safe. However, previous cell-based studies with parabens 
do not take into account the signaling cross-talk between estrogen receptor α (ERα) and the human 
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family.
oBjectives: We investigated the hypothesis that the potency of parabens can be increased with 
HER ligands, such as heregulin (HRG).
Methods: The effects of HER ligands on paraben activation of c-Myc expression and cell prolif-
eration were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blots, flow cytometry, 
and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in ERα- and HER2-positive human BT-474 breast 
cancer cells.
results: Butylparaben (BP) and HRG produced a synergistic increase in c-Myc mRNA and protein 
levels in BT-474 cells. Estrogen receptor antagonists blocked the synergistic increase in c-Myc 
protein levels. The combination of BP and HRG also stimulated proliferation of BT-474 cells 
compared with the effects of BP alone. HRG decreased the dose required for BP-mediated stimula-
tion of c-Myc mRNA expression and cell proliferation. HRG caused the phosphorylation of serine 
167 in ERα. BP and HRG produced a synergistic increase in ERα recruitment to the c-Myc gene.
conclusion: Our results show that HER ligands enhanced the potency of BP to stimulate 
oncogene expression and breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro via ERα, suggesting that parabens 
might be active at exposure levels not previously considered toxicologically relevant from studies 
testing their effects in isolation.

can bind to HER family members to cause 
dimerization, leading to the activation of the 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B 
(PI3K/AKT) pathway and other signal trans-
duction pathways (Mosesson and Yarden 
2004). Aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT 
signaling pathway may increase the risk of 
cancer by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating 
cell proliferation (Liu et al. 2009). HER and 
ERα signaling pathways can cross-talk, as 
indicated by the observation that HER ligands 
stimulate phosphorylation of the serine 167 
(Ser167) residue in ERα (Al-Dhaheri and 
Rowan 2006; Lannigan 2003; Murphy et al. 
2011). Eliminating the main source of endog-
enous estrogens by ovariectomy delays the 
formation of mammary tumors and increases 
the lifespan of transgenic mice that overex-
press HER2 in the mammary gland (Anisimov 
et al. 2003). Furthermore, when HER2 trans-
genic mice are mated to ERα knockout mice, 
tumor onset is delayed compared with control 
HER2 transgenic mice (Hewitt et al. 2002). 
Based on these findings, we hypothesized that 
activators of the HER2 pathway might cause 
parabens to stimulate ERα at lower doses 
than suspected given the results of studies 
that examined their effects in isolation. In the 
present study, we determined the potency of 
parabens in the presence of the HER ligand 
HRG in BT-474 breast cancer cells that 
express both ERα and HER2.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
Human BT-474, MCF-7, and SKBR3 breast 
cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC 
and were used in these studies because of 
differences in their expression of HER2 and 
ERα. BT-474 cells are HER2-negative and 
ERα-positive, MCF-7 cells are ERα-positive 
and HER2-negative, and SKBR3 cells are 
HER2-positive and ERα-negative (Neve et al. 
2006). Cells were grown in phenol red–free 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 
(DMEM/F12) supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 
100 U/mL penicillin, and 10 μg/mL strepto-
mycin (Life Technologies) under 5% CO2 at 
37°C. Three days before treatment, the cells 
were incubated with DMEM/F12 supple-
mented with 10% charcoal-dextran–stripped 
FBS (Gemini Bio-Products). Recombinant 
human heregulin-β1 (HRG) was purchased 
from Leinco Technologies, Inc. and used at 
a final concentration of 20 ng/mL to activate 
the HER2 signaling pathway. Estradiol, 
raloxifene, tamoxifen, methylparaben (MP), 
ethylparaben (EP), propylparaben (PP), 
and butylparaben (BP) were purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. The estrogen 
receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 was 
purchased from Tocris Bioscience. The 
compounds were dissolved in ethanol. The 
final concentration of ethanol was 0.1%, 
which had no effect on the cells. An ethanol 
vehicle was used for the control cells.
Real-Time RT-PCR
BT-474 cells (passage numbers 86–95) were 
grown in six-well tissue culture dishes to 
reach 80% confluence and then maintained 
in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% 
charcoal-dextran–stripped FBS for 3 days. The 
cells were treated with 0.01 μM E2 or 10 μM 
MP, EP, PP or BP in the absence or presence 
of 20 ng/mL HRG for 2 hr. The 10 μM 
concentration of parabens was selected by 
performing preliminary dose–response studies. 
Total RNA was isolated and purified using 
an Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories Inc.). RNA purity and concen-
tration were determined using a NanoDrop 
ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific Inc.). Reverse transcription of total 
RNA was carried out using iScript (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories Inc.) as previously described 
(Paruthiyil et al. 2009). SsoFast EvaGreen 
Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) was 
used for PCR and DNA amplification of the 
c-Myc and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase (GAPDH) genes with a Bio-Rad 
CFX96 Real-Time System. The following 
PCR primers were used:

Western Blot
Human BT-474, MCF-7, and SKBR3 cells 
were grown in six-well tissue culture dishes in 
phenol red–free DMEM/F12 supplemented 
with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL 
penicillin, and 10 μg/mL streptomycin under 
5% CO2 at 37°C. Three days before treatment 
(80% confluence), the medium was replaced 
with DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% 
charcoal-dextran–stripped FBS. The cells were 
then treated for 2 hr with increasing concen-
trations of BP in the absence and presence of 
20 ng/mL HRG. Cells were lysed in radio-
immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer 
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40; 0.5% sodium 
deoxycholate; 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate 
(SDS), and cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor 
Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). The total 
protein concentration was determined with 
the Coomassie Plus™ Protein Assay Reagent 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Fifteen 
micrograms of cell proteins from each sample 
were then separated by SDS–polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and trans-
ferred to a poly 
vinylidene difluoride (PVDF) 
membrane. The membrane was blocked with 
5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline 
with Tween 20 (TBST) [20 mM Tris-HCl 
(pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 
20] and probed overnight with rabbit anti-
c-Myc IgG (sc-764; Santa Cruz Biotechnology 
Inc.) at 0.5 μg/mL in 1% milk-TBST at 4°C. 
After washing with TBST for 5 min for three 
times at 22°C, the membrane was incubated 
with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 
horseradish peroxidase (sc-2054; Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:10,000 dilution in 
1% milk-TBST for 1 hr at room temperature. 
Proteins were visualized using the Amersham 
ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection 
Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The 
Western blot for ERα phosphorylation was 
performed as described for c-Myc except that 
the cell lysis buffer contained a phospha-
tase inhibitor cocktail (PhosSTOP; Roche 
Diagnostics) and the primary antibody was 
anti-phospho-ERα S167 (Bethyl Laboratories).
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation 
(ChIP)
Confluent BT-474 cells were treated with 
butylparaben in the absence and presence 
of HRG (20 ng/mL) for 1–3 hr. The cells 
were harvested for a ChIP assay as previ-
ously described (Cvoro et al. 2006) with 
some modifications. Briefly, to cross-link 
proteins to DNA, the cells were fixed by 
adding formaldehyde to the cell culture 
medium and were then incubated at 37°C 
for 10 min; then, the cross-linking reaction 
was quenched by the addition of glycine 
for 5 min at room temperature. The cell 
monolayer was then washed with phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) containing cOmplete™ 
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and collected 
by scraping. The cells were concentrated 
by centrifugation and lysed as previously 
described by Vivar et al. (2010) with buffer 
containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM 
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM 
EDTA, and cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor 
Cocktail Tablets. The cell lysate was centri-
fuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the pellets 
were resuspended in RIPA buffer containing 
cOmplete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail 
Tablets. Each sample was sonicated on ice to 
shear genomic DNA, and the samples were 
incubated with 4 μg/mL rabbit anti-ERα 
IgG (sc-544; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 
the same concentration of normal rabbit IgG 
(sc-2025; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C 
overnight with rotation. Immunoprecipitation 
was performed with Protein G Mag Sepharose 
(GE Healthcare) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. The protein-DNA 
complex was eluted in 1% SDS and 0.1 M

NaHCO3, and cross-linking of protein-bound 
DNA was reversed by incubating the samples 
at 65°C overnight. DNA was purified using a 
ChIP DNA Clean & Concentrator kit (Zymo 
Research). ERα antibody–precipitated DNA 
was amplified by real-time PCR with specific 
primers for the c-Myc enhancer region as 
 
previously described (Wang et al. 2011).
Cell Cycle Analysis using Flow 
Cytometry
The effects of different treatments on cell 
cycle phase were analyzed by flow cytom-
etry based on a previously described method 
(Wiepz et al. 2006). Briefly, BT-474 cells 
were plated at 500,000 cells per well in 
six-well tissue culture dishes with phenol red–
free DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% 
stripped FBS. Forty-eight hours later, the 
culture medium was switched to serum-free 
DMEM/F12. After 24 hr of synchronization 
with serum-free DMEM/F12, the cells were 
treated with the indicated concentrations of 
BP (see figure legends) in the presence and 
absence of HRG (20 ng/mL) for 24 hr. The 
cells were then trypsinized and collected by 
centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at room 
temperature. The cell pellets were washed 
once with ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 
1,700 rpm for 10 min at room temperature 
followed by resuspension in 500 μL of prop-
idium iodide solution (PBS containing 0.1% 
Triton 100, 0.1% sodium citrate, 10 μg/mL 
RNase, and 0.05 mg/mL propidium iodide) 
to stain the cells. The cell suspensions were 
assayed using a Cytomics FC-500 flow 
cytometer with CXP software (Beckman 
Coulter, Inc.) in the flow cytometry core 
facility at University of California, Berkeley, 
and the data were then analyzed using FlowJo 
7.6.5 (FlowJo, Inc.).
Cell Proliferation Assay
BT-474 cells were plated in six-well tissue 
culture dishes in phenol red–free DMEM/
F12 supplemented with 10% charcoal-
dextran–stripped FBS. The next day, the cells 
were treated with increasing concentrations 
(0.01–1 μM) of BP in the absence or presence 
of HRG (20 ng/mL) and incubated for 1 or 
5 days without changing the medium. After 
treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and 
detached from the plates with trypsin and then 
placed in ISOTON® diluent and counted with 
a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± SD or the 
mean ± SEM as indicated in the figure legends. 
The statistical significance of the differences 
was determined by one- or two-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) as specified in the figure 
legends. All ANOVA tests were followed by 
post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparison tests to 
analyze the differences between time periods 
or doses within groups treated with the same 
reagents (BP, HRG, or BP plus HRG). 
Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post hoc test 
was applied to analyze the differences between 
groups with and without HRG within the 
same paraben treatment group or within the 
same time period. Data analysis was performed 
using GraphPad Prism (v.6.01; GraphPad 
Software, Inc.).
Results
Combined Effects of Parabens and 
HRG on c-Myc Transcript Levels in 
BT-474 Breast Cancer Cells
Because BT-474 cells express both ERα 
and HER2 (Lazaro et al. 2013), they repre-
sent a suitable cell model to explore the 
interactions between ERα and HER2 
signaling pathways. BT-474 cells were treated 
with MP, EP, PP, and BP, all of which 
are commonly present in cosmetics and in 
personal-care products, in the absence and 
presence of HRG. Of the parabens listed 
above, PP and BP were the most effective at 
increasing c-Myc mRNA expression in the 
absence of HRG (Figure 1A). HRG alone 
produced an approximately 3-fold increase 
in c-Myc mRNA expression, but a synergistic 
increase that was greater than additive was 
observed with PP and BP (Figure 1A). BP 
was the most effective stimulator of c-Myc 
mRNA expression in the absence and presence 
of HRG and was selected for further studies. 
The maximal increase of c-Myc expression 
by BP was observed at a concentration of 
10 μM (Figure 1B). The synergistic effect of 
HRG was observed when BT-474 cells were 
treated with BP for 1 hr (Figure 1C). These 
results indicate that HRG decreased the dose 
required for the BP-mediated increase in 
c-Myc mRNA expression and enhanced the 
magnitude of the BP response.
Combined Effects of HRG and BP 
on c-Myc Protein Levels in ERα 
Positive Cell Lines
To determine the effects of HRG on BP 
stimulation of c-Myc protein production, 
BT-474 cells were treated with HRG in the 
absence or presence of increasing concentra-
tions of BP for 2 hr. No increase in c-Myc 
protein levels was observed with BP or HRG 
(Figure 2A) alone. In the presence of HRG 
with 1 μM and 10 μM BP, the increase 
in c-Myc protein levels was similar to that 
induced by 0.01 μM E2 plus HRG. Similarly 
to the BT-474 cells, in MCF-7 cells, which 
express ERα but not HER2, enhanced BP 
Figure 1. Effects of parabens and heregulin (HRG) on c-Myc transcript levels in BT-474 breast cancer cells. (A) Human BT-474 breast cancer cells were treated with 
10 μM methylparaben (MP), 10 μM ethylparaben (EP), 10 μM propylparaben (PP), or 10 μM butylparaben (BP) for 2 hr in the absence and presence of HRG (20 ng/mL). 
(B) BT-474 breast cancer cells were treated with 0.01 μM 17β-estradiol (E2) or increasing concentrations (0.1 μM to 100 μM) of BP in the absence and presence of 
HRG (20 ng/mL) for 2 hr. (C) BT-474 breast cancer cells were treated with 10 μM BP in the absence or presence of HRG (20 ng/mL) for the indicated time periods. 
Relative mRNA levels for c-Myc were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were normalized to GAPDH using the comparative CT method. 
The fold changes were obtained by comparing the treated values with the control values. Each data point is the average of triplicate samples ± SEM. The figures are 
representative of three experiments with similar results. The statistical significance of the means was analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed 
by a post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons test to analyze the significance of the differences between the control and various parabens (A), various doses of BP (B), 
and various time periods (C) in the presence of HRG. Differences in c-Myc expression comparing cells receiving the same paraben treatment (A), the same dose of 
BP (B), and the same time period (C), but with and without HRG, were tested using a post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparisons test.

induction of c-Myc protein levels was 
observed with HRG (Figure 2B). In contrast, 
in the SKBR3 cell line, which is HER2-
positive and ERα-negative, no synergistic 
increase in c-Myc protein levels was observed. 
The increase in c-Myc protein levels that 
occurred in BT-474 cells with BP and HRG 
was blocked by the estrogen receptor antago-
nists ICI 182,780, raloxifene, and tamoxifen 
(Figure 3). These results indicate that HRG 
potentiates BP stimulation of c-Myc only in 
ERα-positive breast cancer cells and that the 
potentiation requires ERα signaling.
Combined Effects of HRG and BP 
on BT-474 Cell Proliferation
The effects of HRG on BP stimulation of 
BT-474 cell proliferation were examined using 
flow cytometry. BT-474 cells were treated 
with BP alone or with HRG plus BP for 24 hr. 
DNA content in the cells was measured by 
flow cytometry. Treatment with BP alone at a 
concentration of 1 μM increased the number of 
cells entering S-phase (Figure 4A). The addition 
of HRG resulted in increased potency of BP. 
The EC50 for BP alone was 0.551 μM, whereas 
the EC50 for BP plus HRG was 0.024 μM 
(Figure 4A). To compare the results obtained 
from the flow cytometry study, we counted the 
cells with a Coulter counter after 24 hr treat-
ment with BP in the absence and presence of 
HRG. BP alone did not stimulate cell prolif-
eration after 24 hr (Figure 4B). A significant 
increase in cell number occurred with 0.1 and 
1 μM BP in the presence of HRG (Figure 4C). 
The shift in BP potency was more pronounced 
after treatment for 5 days. In the absence of 
HRG, 1 μM BP was required to produce a 
significant increase in cell number (Figure 4D), 
whereas in the presence of HRG, 0.01 μM BP 
significantly increased cell number (Figure 4E). 
These findings indicate that HRG lowered 
the dose of BP required to stimulate BT-474 
cell proliferation.
Effects of HRG on Serine 167 
Phosphorylation of ERα and the 
Recruitment of ERα to the c-Myc 
Enhancer by HRG plus BP
One potential mechanism whereby HRG and 
BP could cooperate to produce a synergistic 
activation of c-Myc expression is through 
phosphorylation of ERα and subsequent 
enhanced binding of ERα to the c-Myc gene. 
To explore this possibility, the phosphory-
lation of serine 167 (Ser167) in ERα was 
assessed by Western blotting of BT-474 cells 
treated with HRG for increasing lengths of 
time. HRG caused a detectable increase in the 
phosphorylation of Ser167 in ERα at 30 min, 
and a maximal response was obtained at 2 hr 
(Figure 5A). HRG did not change the level 
of the unphosphorylated form of ERα or the 
levels of β-actin. The recruitment of ERα to a 
known ER binding site in the c-Myc enhancer 
element was examined by ChIP in BT-474 
cells after treatment with HRG and BP. A 
maximal 8-fold enhancement of ERα binding 
to the c-Myc enhancer sequence was observed 
after 1 hr (Figure 5B). The increase in ERα 
binding was greater in cells treated with 
both HRG and BP than in cells treated with 
HRG or BP alone (Figure 5C). These results 
show that the combination of HRG and BP 
increased both ERα phosphorylation and the 
recruitment of ERα to the c-Myc enhancer.
Discussion
HER2 and ERα are components of two 
major signaling pathways that are often 
altered in breast cancers (Nair et al. 2012). 
Xenoestrogens can mimic endogenous estro-
gens to promote the proliferation of breast 
cancer cells (Jenkins et al. 2012). Most studies 
have investigated the effects of xenoestrogens 
alone on end points such as cell proliferation 
(Wróbel and Gregoraszczuk 2013, 2014). 
However, the biological effects of xeno-
estrogens, particularly at low doses, might be

and Methods.” Cells simultaneously treated with 17β-estradiol (E2) (0.01 μM) were also included for 
comparison. After exposure to an X-ray film, the membranes were washed and reprobed with an antibody

 HER ligands increase potency of parabens

altered in the presence of factors that activate 
other signaling pathways that can cross-talk 
with estrogen receptors (Schiff et al. 2004). 
For example, growth factors such as HRG 
and EGF activate downstream Akt signaling, 
which causes the phosphorylation of Ser167 
in ERα (Joel et al. 1998; Nagashima et al. 
2008). Phosphorylation of ERα plays a critical 
role in gene transcription by enhancing ligand 
binding to ER, nuclear localization, dimeriza-
tion, DNA binding, and coactivator recruit-
ment (Al-Dhaheri and Rowan 2006; Lannigan 
2003; Murphy et al. 2011). Based on these 
findings, we hypothesized that studies using 
parabens and other xenoestrogens alone could 
underestimate their proliferative effects in 
breast tissue cells and their potency to promote 
breast cancer, particularly at lower doses.
A major rationale promulgated in favor 
of the safety of xenoestrogens in consumer 
products is that at biologically relevant 
concentrations, they bind to estrogen recep-
tors with too low an affinity to produce 
signifi 
cant biological effects in humans 
(Golden et al. 2005). For example, BP was 
found to bind to ERα with ~10,000-fold 
lower affinity than E2 (Bolger et al. 1998). 
Similarly, functional assays of ERα such as 
Figure 4. Effects of heregulin (HRG) on the potency of butylparaben (BP) stimulation of BT-474 cell prolifera-
tion. (A) BT-474 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of BP alone or BP and HRG for 24 hr. 
Changes in cell cycle distribution were then analyzed by flow cytometry as described in “Materials and 
Methods.” The percentage of S-phase cells was plotted for different BP concentrations in the absence 
and presence of HRG. The plotted values are the means (± SD) of biological triplicates, which represent 
three independent experiments with similar results. (B,C) BT-474 cells were plated in 6-well dishes at 
250,000 cells/well. The culture medium was then switched to serum-free medium 24 hr later, and the cells 
were treated with the indicated concentrations of BP in the absence (B) or presence (C) of HRG (20 ng/mL). 
The cells were harvested after 24 hr of treatment and then counted with a Coulter counter. The figures 
are representative of three experiments with similar results. The data are expressed as the means (± SD) 
obtained from biological triplicates. Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance

reporter assay activation and MCF-7 cell 
proliferation found that physiologically 
implausible concentrations of parabens are 
needed for ERα activation (Golden et al. 
2005). However, this argument does not 
take into account the possibility that other 
signaling pathways in cells, particularly those 
that promote cell proliferation, might poten-
tiate paraben and other xenoestrogen effects 
by sensitizing ERα to activation at lower 
doses. In the present study, we investigated 
whether parabens are more potent in the 
presence of HER ligands. We demonstrated 
that HRG and BP could produce a synergistic 
increase in mRNA expression by the oncogene 
c-Myc. The increase in c-Myc mRNA expres-
sion was accompanied by a corresponding 
increase in c-Myc protein levels. The synergy 
required the presence of ERα because the 
synergy was blocked by estrogen receptor 
antagonists, and no synergy was observed in 
the ERα-negative, HER2-positive SKBR3 cell 
line. Unexpectedly, we observed that syner-
gistic activation occurred in HER2-negative 
MCF-7 cells; this finding suggests that other 
receptors from the HER family can mediate 
the effects of HRG on estrogenic sensitivity, 
as discussed below. An HRG-mediated 
increase in the potency of BP was observed in 
two different proliferative assays. Our results 
revealed that HRG lowered the dose of BP 
required to significantly affect proliferation of 
ER-positive breast cancer cells.
Although it is clear that endogenous 
estrogens increase the risk of breast cancer, 
the role of parabens in breast cancer is contro-
versial, in part because of uncertainty about 
whether the concentrations of parabens that 
are present in the body are sufficient to mimic 
the effects of endogenous estrogens on breast 
tissue cells (Harvey 2003; Karpuzoglu et al. 
2013; vom Saal et al. 2007). In this study, 
we demonstrated that even in the presence 
of HRG, higher concentrations of parabens 
than those of E2 were needed to stimulate 
c-Myc expression and to cause proliferation 
of BT-474 cells. However, the PP and BP 
concentrations at which we observed estro-
genic effects in the presence of HRG are 
within the range of concentrations previously 
reported in human breast tissue (Barr et al. 
2012). Large-scale biomonitoring studies 
have reported urinary paraben concentrations 
ranging from 0.001 to 1 μM (Calafat et al. 
2010; Frederiksen et al. 2011), although the 
relationship between urine and tissue levels 
remains uncertain. Furthermore, breast tissues 
may contain multiple parabens (Darbre et al. 
2004), and combinations of different parabens 
can produce additive effects on proliferation 
(Charles and Darbre 2013). We found that 
HRG acted synergistically with PP and BP 
to increase c-Myc gene expression. Further 
studies will be needed to determine the effects 
of HRG in the presence of  
combinations of 
parabens or other xenoestrogens.
The presence of multiple HER recep-
tors and ligands in breast tissues may affect 
the activity of parabens. The 11 known 
endogenous HER ligands can bind to one 
or more of the HER receptors (Mosesson 
and Yarden 2004) with the notable excep-
tion of HER2, for which there is no known 
ligand (Harari and Yarden 2000). However, 
the binding of ligands to HER1, HER3, or 
HER4 leads to a preferential dimerization 
and activation of HER2 (Rubin and Yarden 
2001). Further work will be needed to 
determine if other HER ligands potentiate 
the effects of parabens and to determine 
their relative potency compared with that of 
HRG. Interestingly, breast cancer cells are 
autocrine producers of HER ligands. In a 
study of 363 breast tumors, it was found that 
80%–96% of the tumors expressed at least 
one of ten tested HER ligands (Révillion et al. 
2008). Similarly, another study found that 
48% of breast tumors express HRG (Esteva 
et al. 2001). Breast tumors may therefore 
potentiate their own response to estrogenic 
compounds by producing HER ligands.
Conclusion
Our data showing that lower doses of BP 
were required to stimulate breast cancer cell 
proliferation in the presence of HRG together 
with the observations that breast tumors 
are exposed in vivo to both HER ligands 
(Révillion et al. 2008) and parabens (Darbre 
et al. 2004) indicate a potential synergy 
relevant to the proliferation of tumor cells 
in humans. Further work is needed to assess 
whether HER ligands indeed enhance the 
potency of parabens in normal human breast 
tissue cells and in breast tumors. In light of 
our findings, we suggest that reevaluation of 
the potency of other xenoestrogens in the 
presence of HER ligands is warranted.
