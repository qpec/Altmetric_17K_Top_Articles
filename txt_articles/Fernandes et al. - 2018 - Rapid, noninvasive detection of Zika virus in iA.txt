The accelerating global spread of arboviruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), highlights the need for more proactive
mosquito surveillance. However, a major challenge during arbovirus outbreaks has been the lack of rapid and afford-
able tests for pathogen detection in mosquitoes. We show for the first time that near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a
rapid, reagent-free, and cost-effective tool that can be used to noninvasively detect ZIKV in heads and thoraces of
intact Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with prediction accuracies of 94.2 to 99.3% relative to quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). NIRS involves simply shining a beam of light on a mosquito to
collect a diagnostic spectrum. We estimated in this study that NIRS is 18 times faster and 110 times cheaper than
RT-qPCR. We anticipate that NIRS will be expanded upon for identifying potential arbovirus hotspots to guide the
spatial prioritization of vector control.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae
transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes mosquitoes (1, 2). ZIKV has
been of international concern due to its rapid spread in the Americas in
2015–2016 (3) and its association with neurological disorders, such as
Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults (4) and microcephaly in infants (5).
Timely detection of ZIKV transmission in mosquito populations would
be critical for identifying potential hotspots and preventing outbreaks
(6). However, adequate mosquito surveillance is missing from most
Zika-endemic countries like Brazil, which reported over 1.6 million
ZIKV infections between January 2015 and November 2016 (7, 8).
Real-time or rapid mapping of arbovirus transmission at the neighbor-
hood or community level could guide the spatial prioritization of vector
control (9). To estimate transmission risk, the abundance of mosquito
vectors is often used as a proxy for entomological risk and can be deter-
mined by trapping adults or using larval measures, such as the Breteau
index (10). However, the relationship between vector densities and the
prevalence of arbovirus infections in humans is frequently inconsistent
across different communities, possibly because vector-human contact
also influences infection (11). Viral infection rates among mosquitoes
can provide more information about infection risk; however, many
arbovirus surveillance programs in low- and middle-income countries
do not have the resources to carry out pathogen screening with current-
ly available techniques.
Conventional pathogen screening in mosquito vectors involves
time-consuming analysis using molecular techniques, such as quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), which are
often too expensive for the analysis of the large numbers of mosquitoes
needed for mosquito surveillance programs (12). For example, when
ZIKV was first detected in A. aegypti mosquitoes in Brazil, 550 A. aegypti
were grouped into 198 pools, and only three of the pools were ZIKV pos-
itive, or a prevalence of ≤0.9% (13). Therefore, routine pathogen surveil-
lance in mosquitoes to identify transmission hotspots would involve
testing thousands of mosquitoes each month. The use of honey-baited
nucleic acid preservation cards to capture arboviruses from mosquito
saliva has been proposed to eliminate the problem of testing individual
mosquitoes, but the technique still requires RT-qPCR to test for viral
RNA (14). Most of the currently available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
for arbovirus detection in mosquitoes rely on the capture of viralanti-
gens through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A test targeting
the dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been developed for den-
gue virus detection in A. aegypti. The NS1 test is sensitive and more af-
fordable than RT-qPCR, and it can be coupled with electronic biosensors
for point-of-use diagnosis (15–17). However, the specificity of RDTs
using antigen detection is a major limitation, given that cross-reactivity
of antigen-based assays among flaviviruses has been reported (17). Sim-
ilarly,aplaquereductionneutralizationtestcanbeusedto measure virus-
specific neutralizing antibodies, but this test shows cross-reaction with
antibodies from other flaviviruses (17). Given that RT-qPCR is expensive
and time-consuming and there is still uncertainty about the specificity
of many antigen-based tests, arbovirus surveillance programs in endemic
countriesoften rely solelyon human case reports(7, 18),a strategy which
has been inadequate for containing arbovirus outbreaks.
We sought to understand whether near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
can be used as an alternative to molecular techniques to detect ZIKV in
A. aegypti mosquitoes. NIRS is a light-based method of chemical anal-
ysis that has been used for decades across fields such as agriculture (19),
pharmaceuticals (20), and medicine (21). It classifies biological samples
based on the type and the concentration of chemical compounds present
inthesamples. Thetechnique iseasytouse,rapid,andnoninvasive,andit
does not require reagents to operate (19). Previous applications of NIRS
to vector-borne diseases include the age determination of biting midges
(22) and house flies (23) and the sex separation of tsetse flies (24). More
recently, NIRS has been used on major malaria vectors in Africa to non-
invasively and rapidly determine their age and species (25, 26) and to pre-
dict the age (27, 28) and the presence of endosymbiont Wolbachia (29)
in A. aegypti. In addition to insect characterization, NIRS has also

 been tested in small pilot studies for detecting hepatitis C and human
immunodeficiency viruses in human serum and plasma (30, 31) and in-
fluenza virus in nasal fluids (32). This study represents the first investiga-
tion of the capability of NIRS to noninvasively detect arboviruses in
mosquito vectors.
RESULTS
To understand whether NIRS can distinguish ZIKV-infected from un-
infected A. aegypti mosquitoes, we reared adult females (cohort 1,
n = 275) to 5 to 6 days of age. We fed half with ZIKV-infected blood
and the other half with uninfected blood as a control group. Using a
near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer, we collected spectra from the head/
thorax region of mosquitoes at 4 and 7 days post infection (dpi) and then
confirmed the ZIKV loads by RT-qPCR. We found that analysis of NIR
spectra by cross-validation and partial least squares (PLS) regression dis-
tinguished ZIKV-infected from uninfected mosquitoes with 92.5% accura-
cy (n = 120). When we applied the ZIKV training model to a subset of
samples from cohort 1 that were excluded from the training model (n =
155), we found an overall predictive accuracy of 99.3% (Fig. 1). These
results suggest that a randomly selected mosquito from cohort 1 could
be predicted as infected with ZIKV or uninfected more than 9 out of 10
times based on the spectra of the other mosquitoes in this cohort. The sen-
sitivity appeared to improve with increasing incubation period (Table 1).
To determine whether the ZIKV training model developed from
mosquitoes in cohort 1 was robust enough to detect ZIKV infections
in a set of independent mosquitoes (that is, unknown to the model), we
reared a second cohort (cohort 2,n = 412) of female A. aegypti mosquitoes
and infected half with ZIKV. In addition to determining the overall pre-
dictive accuracy of the ZIKV training model, we determined the accuracy
ofthemodelonthespectracollectedfromboth heads/thoraces and abdo-
mens and at a longer incubation period. Accordingly, the spectra were
collected from the heads/thoraces and abdomens of ZIKV-infected
and control mosquitoes in cohorts 2 at 4, 7, and 10 dpi. Using the ZIKV
training model developed from cohort 1, we predicted the mosquitoes
in cohort 2 as ZIKV-infected or uninfected with an overall predictive
accuracy of 97.3% for heads/thoraces (n = 412) and 88.8% (n = 412)
for abdomens (Fig. 2). Table 1 shows the sensitivity and specificity at
various time points for cohort 1 and cohort 2 mosquito samples for
heads/thoraces and abdomens as predicted by NIRS.
The highest accuracy (227 of 228 mosquitoes correctly predicted)
was obtained when heads/thoraces were scanned at 7 dpi, suggesting
that this could be the time point when the effects of ZIKV infection
on the chemistry of the mosquito are most pronounced. Although pre-
diction accuracy was lower for 10 dpi than for the first two time points,
the sensitivity of this assay was still remarkably high considering that
this time point was not accounted for in the training model. The ob-
served higher prediction accuracies of spectra from heads/thoraces
compared to spectra from abdomens could be due to the fact that abdo-
mens were not included in the training model. Alternatively, the higher
accuracy of head/thorax spectra could suggest that ZIKA infection gen-
erates a more marked chemical change in the head/thorax than in the
abdomen. Given that the Brazilian strain of ZIKV is only detectable in
the heads/thoraces of A. aegypti beginning at 4 to 7 dpi (33), there may
be an enhanced mosquito immune response to the virus at this time
point. Nevertheless, accuracies of 84.8 to 92.6% in the abdomens indi-
cate that the model is still of value for Zika detection in these tissues,
particularly when the head/thorax is unavailable for analysis. Together,
these results support the external validity of the NIRS-based model for
the identification of ZIKV-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes.
To further understand the spectral changes influencing the differ-
entiation of ZIKV-infected and uninfected mosquitoes by NIRS, we
analyzed the raw spectra (Fig. 3) using PLS regression. There were
noticeable differences between the shapes of the average spectra of
ZIKV-infected (red) and uninfected mosquitoes (blue), indicating dif-
ferences in their absorbance characteristics. Important wavelengths
identified in the PLS regression coefficients plot (Fig. 4) were observed
at 1000, 1413, 1515, 1711, 1801, 1893, 2109, and 2246 nm. Peaks at 1000
and 1801 nm should be considered with caution, as they may be an
artifact of the spectrometer used. The spectrometer used in this study
contains three sensors: a silicon sensor (350 to 1000 nm) and two
InGaAs sensors (1001 to 1800 nm and 1801 to 2500 nm). The transition
points between these sensors are 1000 and 1801 nm. However, it is
also possible that the peaks at 1000 and 1801 nm truly correspond to
molecular components of ZIKV. Further studies using improvements
to this instrument or using different equipment are needed to eliminate
this source of error. A stronger light source, more efficient fibers, or
improved sensors in the current spectrometer could improve the signal-
to-noise ratio and minimize or eliminate this noise. The spectral region
encompassing peaks at 1413 and 1515 nm is associated with the O–H
and N–H overtones (19), which might correspond to glycoproteins in
the viral envelope (34) or to antimicrobial peptides produced by the
mosquito immune system as part of the Toll pathway (35). Given that
NIR spectroscopy has only recently been introduced to the fields of vi-
rology (36) and medical entomology (22, 24–27, 29), there is limited in-
formation on the NIR bands corresponding to specific physical and
chemical changes associated with viral infections in mosquitoes. Future
studies should use more informative mid-infrared sensors to elucidate
the chemical changes influencing the observed differences.
Here, we calculated that ZIKV detection by NIRS was 18 times
faster and 110 times cheaper than RT-qPCR. Given the technique’s rapid,
high-throughput, and reagent-free nature, hundreds of samples can be
processed in a day by unskilled technicians, enabling rapid predictions
of potential disease transmission, which in turn could facilitate a rapid
action plan to stop major disease outbreaks.

 DISCUSSION
The value of NIR spectroscopy as a research tool in vector-borne
diseases is only beginning to be realized. In this novel application of
NIR spectroscopy to detect ZIKV in mosquitoes, we found NIR pre-
diction accuracies of 94.2 to 99.3% in differentiating ZIKV-infected
and uninfected A. aegypti when heads/thoraces are analyzed. Because
our aim was to detect ZIKV in vivo, we were unable to distinguish the
contributions of the virus itself from those of the mosquito immune re-
sponse when analyzing the chemical and physical changes associated
with changes in the NIR spectra. Future studies of ZIKV in serum and
a variety of media using mid-infrared sensors can clarify which chem-
ical compounds are responsible for the differences that we observed
between infected and uninfected mosquitoes.
At present, NIR detection of ZIKV is not “field ready,” as the hetero-
geneity of field-collected mosquitoes must be incorporated into NIR
models to achieve robust validity for field applications. Field samples
are much more likely to be desiccated and damaged than laboratory
mosquitoes, and they represent a variety of ages and feeding statuses.
Therefore, the next steps in the development of the technique should
include testing it on field populations of A. aegypti to determine its sen-
sitivity and specificity for arbovirus detection relative to RT-qPCR. The
technique must also be evaluated against different arboviruses in a va-
riety of media to determine the effects of background and to test for any
cross-reactivity.
One major drawback of NIRS is the need to purchase a spectrometer
with high enough sensitivity to identify the virus. The estimated cost of

 commercially available benchtop spectrometers that are sensitive
enough (defined by a high signal-to-noise ratio) to collect spectra from
mosquitoes is $60,000. Because of the budget restrictions often faced by
the public health sector in many disease-endemic countries, it may be
necessary to establish NIRS processing centers to scan mosquito samples
sent in from entire regions or countries. Because there is no need for re-
agents, the cost of acquiring such a spectrometer would be recovered after
scanning approximately 10,000 mosquitoes. More affordable microspec-
trometers are commercially available for less than $500; however, the sen-
sitivity of these spectrometers needs to be tested because of their lower
resolution, inherent noise, and more limited range of wavelengths. As
the technology evolves and the market for spectrometers grows, the cost
and size of spectrometers are expected to decrease significantly. Another
major drawback of NIRS is the need to develop a separate data library for
each arbovirus or pathogen of interest. However, once a robust data
library for ZIKV detection in field mosquitoes is established for a given
country, the data library could then be packaged and used by mosquito
control programs throughout the country to screen for ZIKV infec-
tions in unknown field samples without the need for building new
models. If NIRS is as accurate in detecting ZIKV in field mosquitoes
as it is in the laboratory, then the speed, cost effectiveness, and non-
invasiveness of the technique would make it an attractive technology
for the surveillance of mosquito-borne viruses in the future.
Here, we calculated that ZIKV detection by NIRS was 18 times
faster and 110 times cheaper than RT-qPCR. However, the user often
becomes faster with repeated use of the spectrometer. If used as a pre-
screening tool for RT-qPCR or other molecular techniques, NIRS can
save time and money by quickly separating infected from uninfected
mosquitoes. Because there is no need to dissect or manipulate mosqui-
toes for NIRS, it is also a safer tool than those assays that require
handling potentially infected mosquito tissues. NIRS data can be ana-
lyzed by a number of commercially available software packages, as well
as free, open-source programs built in R. The data can also be saved in a
variety of formats that could be incorporated into decision support
systems based on multicriteria system analysis, similar to the system
proposed for Ebola control (37). Information on pathogen circulation
has been the key element missing from predictive models of arboviruses
thus far. Therefore, we believe that rapid arbovirus detection in mosqui-
toes by NIRS has the potential to improve the quality and timeliness of
surveillance data, thereby accelerating responses to arbovirus outbreaks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mosquito rearing
AllA. aegypti mosquitoes were reared in the insectary of the Laboratório
de Mosquitos Transmissores de Hematozoários, Pavilhão Carlos
Chagas, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under identical
conditions: 27°C, 70% humidity, and 12:12 hours light/dark. Larvae
were fed on TetraMin tropical flakes (Tetra Melle) until pupation.
Pupae were transferred into cages (40 cm × 40 cm × 30 cm) for emer-
gence. Adults were allowed to mate for 3 to 4 days and were given 10%
sugar solution ad libitum up until 36 hours before infection. Two
separate cohorts of mosquitoes reared at different time points were used
in this experiment: One was used to train the model (cohort 1), and the
second was used to test the accuracy of the model (cohort 2).
Experimental ZIKV infection
We used the currently circulating strain of Brazilian ZIKV [BRPE243/
2015 (BRPE)] (38), which was isolated from a Zika-infected patient in
late 2015 and maintained in cell culture. Viral titers were quantified via
plaque-forming assay before experimental infection. In two separate
experiments, 1 ml of ZIKV-infected supernatant was harvested from
culture, mixed with 2 ml of rabbit blood and 0.5 mM adenosine
5′-triphosphate (as a phagostimulant), and was used to orally infect
female A. aegypti mosquitoes at 5 to 6 days post-emergence. The viral
titer used for mosquitoes in both cohorts was 1.9 × 106 PFU (plaque-
forming units)/ml. For each cohort and at each time point, there was a
control group of mosquitoes fed with blood and virus-free culture
medium.
Scanning of mosquitoes
Mosquitoes from cohort 1 were collected for scanning at 4 and 7 dpi.
For cohort 2, mosquitoes were collected for scanning at 4, 7, and 10 dpi.
Mosquitoes were killed just before scanning by placing them in a closed
jarwithan acetate-soaked cottonballfor1 min. Whole mosquitoeswere
then arranged on their sides on a Spectralon diffuse reflectance stage for

 scanning, as previously described (26). The heads/thoraces of mosquitoes
in cohort 1 and the heads/thoraces and abdomens (collecting one
spectrum per body part) of mosquitoes in cohort 2 were positioned in
the center of the light from a fiber-optic probe. Spectra were collected
using a LabSpec 4 i NIR spectrometer (Malvern Panalytical) with an in-
ternal 18.6-W light source and a 3.2-mm-diameter fiber-optic probe
(Model 135325 Rev B, ASD Inc.), according to established protocols
(26). The average raw spectra collected from the heads/thoraces of
ZIKV-infected and uninfected mosquitoes are shown in Fig. 3.
Confirmation of ZIKV infection by RT-qPCR
Viral RNA was extracted from sampled mosquitoes with a QIAamp
Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Viral RNA detection and quantification in
each individual were performed through RT-qPCR with the SuperScript
III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen) in QuantStudio 6 Flex
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using previously published
primers and amplification conditions (13). Virus copy numbers were
calculated through absolute quantification in each run using a standard
curve of a seven-point dilution series (102 to 108 copies) of in vitro tran-
scribed ZIKV RNA (39). Virus titers for mosquitoes at each time point
are shown in Fig. 5.
Data analysis
We trained and tested the ZIKV detection model according to pre-
viously published methods (26). Spectra from 120 (n = 61 infected,
n = 59 uninfected) mosquitoes in cohort 1 were included in the analysis,
having excluded the spectra of those samples that failed to amplify
ZIKV RNA in RT-qPCR. To minimize noise, only the wavelengths
between 700 and 2350 nm were analyzed, and spectra were mean-
centered before applying the PLS regression method in GRAMS Plus/
IQ software (Thermo Galactic). The number of PLS factors was chosen
on the basis of the predicted residual error sum of squares and the
regression coefficients plot. In the PLS model, a value of “1” was as-
signed to the spectra of uninfected mosquitoes, and a value of “2” was
assigned to the spectra of ZIKV-infected mosquitoes. A model-
predicted value of 1.5 was considered the threshold for correct clas-
sification. The resulting eight-factor model was then applied to a pre-
validation set of mosquitoes from cohort 1 that were not included in
the model (n = 155 spectra from heads/thoraces) and independent
prediction sets (n = 412 spectra from heads/thoraces and n = 412
spectra from abdomens of mosquitoes in cohort 2, having excluded
the spectra of those samples that failed to amplify in RT-qPCR). The
accuracy of the model to detect the presence or absence of ZIKV was
tested on mosquitoes at 4, 7, and 10 dpi. The regression coefficient
plot used to differentiate ZIKV-infected from uninfected female
A. aegypti is shown in Fig. 4.
Cost and time effectiveness calculation
It took approximately 30 s to position one mosquito on its side on a
Spectralon diffuse reflectance stage and to collect a spectrum from its
head/thorax using NIRS. Of this time, collecting the spectrum took
approximately 15 s. Using NIRS, a total of 50 min was required to scan
100 mosquitoes. Comparatively, it took 2 full days (7.5 hours per day ×
2 days = 900 min) to prepare mosquitoes, extract DNA, and run RT-
qPCR to detect ZIKA infection in 100 mosquitoes. This makes NIRS
18 times faster than RT-qPCR (900 min/50 min = 18). We disregarded
the delivery time for PCR reagents, which in some countries can be in
the order of months.
For cost analysis, we excluded the cost of a NIR spectrometer
and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. After the initial purchase of a
NIR spectrometer, no reagents were required; therefore, operational
running costs for NIRS were only related to labor. For this study, we
used a researchassistant for $10 per hour to carry out NIRS experiments
for 50 min and scan 100 samples. Comparatively, RT-qPCR costs ~$10
per sample processed ($1000 for 100 samples). Labor costs for RT-
qPCR were estimated at $10 per person per hour working for 900 min
amounting to $160 for running RT-qPCR on 100 samples for 2 days. As
per our calculations, NIRS in this study was 116 times cheaper than
PCR ($1160/$10 = 116).

Fig. 5. ZIKV load in A. aegypti cohorts at 4, 7, and 10 dpi with a Brazilian
ZIKV isolate (BRPE243/2015) provided at a titer of 1.9 × 106 PFU/ml. Viral
copies were determined by RT-qPCR in individual mosquito homogenates with
a standard curve of a seven-point dilution series (102 to 108 copies/ml) of in vitro
transcribed ZIKV RNA. The number of infected mosquitoes followed by the infec-
tion rate (in parentheses) is shown for each condition.
