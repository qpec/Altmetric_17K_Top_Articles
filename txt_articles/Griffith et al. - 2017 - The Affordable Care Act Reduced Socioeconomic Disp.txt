The Affordable Care Act Reduced
Socioeconomic Disparities In
Health Care Access
ABSTRACT The United States has the largest socioeconomic disparities in
health care access of any wealthy country. We assessed changes in these
disparities in the United States under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). We
used survey data for the period 2011–15 from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System to assess trends in insurance coverage, having a
personal doctor, and avoiding medical care due to cost. All analyses were
stratified by household income, education level, employment status, and
home ownership status. Health care access for people in lower
socioeconomic strata improved in both states that did expand eligibility
for Medicaid under the ACA and states that did not. However, gains were
larger in expansion states. The absolute gap in insurance coverage
between people in households with annual incomes below $25,000 and
those in households with incomes above $75,000 fell from 31 percent to
17 percent (a relative reduction of 46 percent) in expansion states and
from 36 percent to 28 percent in nonexpansion states (a 23 percent
reduction). This serves as evidence that socioeconomic disparities in
health care access narrowed significantly under the ACA.
A
ccess to health care among non-
elderly
Americans
is
strongly
associated
with
socioeconomic
characteristics, including income,
education,
employment,
and
wealth.1–5 Compared to Americans who are better
off, those in lower socioeconomic strata are less
likely to be insured,6,7 are more likely to avoid
medical care due to cost8 and to enter hospitals
through emergency departments,9 and have
twice as many avoidable hospitalizations.10 The
poor use less health care in spite of having great-
er medical need.11 These health care access gaps
arecompounded by—and may contribute to—the
large and widening socioeconomic disparities in
health and longevity in the United States.6,12–14
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was designed to
improve access to health care by expanding
insurance coverage. Although some aspects of
the ACA applied to people of all socioeconomic
strata—such as eliminating exclusions due to
preexisting conditions—key features of the law
sought to increase coverage among lower-
income people specifically. These features in-
cluded federal subsidies to expand eligibility
for Medicaid to all Americans with incomes of
up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level15
and large premium subsidies for people with
incomes of 100–400 percent of poverty who pur-
chase insurance on the newly created exchanges.
In January 2014 twenty-four states and the
District of Columbia expanded Medicaid, and
residents of all states gained access to subsidized
premiums. Twenty-sixstateschose not toexpand
Medicaid at the time, though nonpoor residents
of these states gained access to subsidized
coverage on the exchanges. President Donald
Trump and the Republicans in Congress have
proposed repealing the ACA and eliminating
many of these subsidies to lower-income people.

 In this article we assess the extent to which
the
ACA—and
its
Medicaid
expansion,
in
particular—reduced socioeconomic gaps in ac-
cess to health care. Previous studies on the
effects of Medicaid expansion suggest that
health coverage increased, particularly for mem-
bers of racial and ethnic minority groups,16,17 the
poor,18–22 and younger adults,23 with gains con-
centrated in Medicaid expansion states.24 Fur-
thermore, there is some evidence of increased
use of preventive and primary care services in
expansion states23,25,26 and a higher proportion
of citizens reporting excellenthealth.21However,
manyexisting studieshave reliedon surveys with
very low (5–10 percent) response rates, used
data from just a few states, assessed just the first
year of full ACA implementation, or have not
accounted for preexisting trajectories in out-
comes. The effect of the ACA on socioeconomic
disparities in access has not previously been
reported.
Using nationally representative data for 2011–
15 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS), we assessed changes in health
insurance coverage and access associated with
the ACA for people in different socioeconomic
strata, comparing changes between Medicaid ex-
pansion and nonexpansion states.We quantified
changes in socioeconomic access gaps, defined
as differences in access between low and high
socioeconomic groups, in the two groups of
states.
Study Data And Methods
Data Data were extracted for all nonelderly
adults (people ages 18–64) who responded to
the 2011–15 BRFSS. For a description of the data,
see the online Appendix.27
Several states (Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii,
New York, and Vermont) and the District of
Columbia provided health coverage to house-
holds with incomes at or above 100 percent of
poverty before the ACA’s Medicaid expansion
and were excluded from this analysis.28 We also
excluded Massachusetts and Maryland because
they had statewide programs covering adults
who had no dependent children and whose
household incomes were up to 150 percent29
and 116 percent30,31 of poverty, respectively. We
did not exclude California because its pre-2014
Medicaid expansion was not statewide and did
not always cover people with household incomes
of at least 100 percent of poverty. Our final data
set contained a total of 1,089,940 respondents
from the remaining forty-three states. Summary
statistics are presented in Appendix Exhibit S1,
and a map of states by expansion status is pre-
sented in Appendix Exhibit S12.27
Measures We assessed changes in three mea-
sures of health care access. Insurance coverage
was measured by asking, “Do you have any kind
of health care coverage, including health insur-
ance, prepaid plans such as HMOs [health main-
tenance organizations], or government plans
such as Medicare, or Indian Health Service?”
Whether or not respondents had a primary care
provider was measured by asking, “Do you have
one person you think of as your personal doctor
or health care provider?” Lastly, whether or not
a respondent avoided care due to cost was mea-
sured by asking, “Was there a time in the past 12
months when you needed to see a doctor but
could not because of cost?” These three measures
have been found to have high levels of validity
and test-retest reliability.32
Analyses were stratified by respondents’ socio-
economic characteristics: self-reported house-
hold income, educational attainment, employ-
ment status, and home ownership status. The
BRFSS reports annual household income in
eight categories: less than $10,000, $10,000 to
less than $15,000, $15,000 to less than $20,000,
$20,000 to less than $25,000, $25,000 to less
than $35,000, $35,000 to less than $50,000,
$50,000 to less than $75,000, and more than
$75,000. Because of small sample sizes at lower
incomes, we also stratified using a binary indi-
cator for household poverty (household income
of less than $25,000 per year), which allowed us
to identify households most likely to have in-
comes below the federal poverty level (the pov-
erty level for a family of four in 2014 was
$23,850). In describing income-related access
gaps, we compared people in households with
higher incomes (more than $75,000) to those in
households with lower incomes (less than
$25,000). These categories each represented
about 30 percent of the respondents.
Education was treated as binary characteristic:
whether or not the respondent had graduated
from college. Employment status was defined
as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor
force. Home ownership was a binary character-
istic:
whether
the
respondent’s
household
owned or rented its home.
To be considered an expansion state in this
analysis, a state had to have implemented the
ACA Medicaid expansion by mid-2015 (Pennsyl-
vania and Indiana were considered expansion
states; Alaska was not). Of the forty-three states
included in the analysis, twenty-one were cate-
gorized as expansion states. In sensitivity anal-
yses, we excluded all states that had expanded
Medicaid after January 1, 2014: Michigan (which
expanded on April 1, 2014), New Hampshire
(August 15, 2014), Pennsylvania (January 1,
2015), Indiana (February 1, 2015), Alaska (Sep-

 tember 1, 2015), and Montana (January 1, 2016).
Analytic Approach Our analysis proceeded
in four steps. First, we assessed how each of our
outcomes (having insurance coverage, having a
primary care provider, and avoiding care due to
cost) varied with socioeconomic characteristics,
thus illuminating disparities in access. We as-
sessed these relationships in 2013 (before imple-
mentation of Medicaid expansion and the new
health insurance exchanges) and 2015 (up to
two years post-implementation), stratifying by
whether each state had expanded Medicaid.
Second, we estimated pre/post “first differenc-
es”
regression
models
to
assess
temporal
changes in health care access associated with
the ACA rollout. We estimated both crude
changes (from 2013 to 2015) and adjusted
changes (controlling for state-level time trends
for the period 2011–15 and the following respon-
dent characteristics: race/ethnicity, sex, age
category, pregnancy status, veteran status, edu-
cation level, home ownership status, household
size, household income, presence of children
in the household, and state). Models were strati-
fied by socioeconomic characteristics and by
residence in an expansion versus a nonexpan-
sion state.
Third, to identify changes in outcomes associ-
ated with Medicaid expansion, we estimated
difference-in-differences models, adjusting for
national time-varying factors—including the
rollout of other aspects of the ACA that were
implemented in all states. We estimated both
crude
and
adjusted
difference-in-differences
models, controlling for state-level trends for
the period 2011–15 and the covariates listed
above. Crude models included data just for
2013–15; adjusted models used data for 2011–
15 to better capture pre-reform trends. The dif-
ference-in-differences models were stratified by
socioeconomic characteristics. All regression
models were estimated as linear probability
models with BRFSS sampling weights33 and stan-
dard errors clustered at the state level to account
for intrastate correlation.34 Regression equa-
tions are presented in the Appendix.27
Fourth, we assessed changes in health care
access gaps between 2013 and 2015, defined as
absolute and relative changes over time in the
percentage-point difference in access between
people in high and low socioeconomic strata
for each socioeconomic characteristic. Our anal-
ysis of access gaps was stratified by whether the
state expanded Medicaid. Absolute changes in
access gaps were assessed in regression models,
interacting the socioeconomic strata with the
post-reform indicator. All analyses were con-
ducted using R, version 3.24.
Limitations Our study had several limita-
tions. First, as with all nonexperimental studies,
certain assumptions are required to interpret the
estimates as causal. Our adjusted first-differenc-
es models could be interpreted this way if all
secular changes between 2013 and 2015 were
attributable to the ACA, after adjustment for
linear time trends and changes in observed co-
variates. Our difference-in-differences models
relied on the assumption that expansion states
would have experienced changes similar to those
in nonexpansion states had they not expanded
Medicaid, after adjustment for state trends
and covariates. In interpreting our difference-
in-differences models, we note that if Medicaid
expansion
states
differentially
implemented
other aspects of the ACA—such as more or less
advertising and outreach35—then our effect esti-
mates could reflect these differences in addition
to the direct effect of Medicaid itself.
A second limitation is that survey nonresponse
could also be a source of bias. The BRFSS
response rates are about 40–50 percent, which
is high for telephone surveys but still indicates
substantial
nonparticipation.36
Although
re-
sponses were reweighted to reflect state demo-
graphics, the data may be nonrepresentative in
other ways. We adjusted for observed character-
istics in our models to reduce the influence of
variation in survey participation.
Third, the analysis included data from only the
first two years of the ACA Medicaid expansion
and exchanges. More distal outcomes, including
health outcomes, might need more time to re-
spond to this policy intervention.17,37–41
Finally,
the
persistence
of
the
observed
changes is uncertain, given the changing policy
environment.
Study Results
The study sample was weighted to reflect the
noninstitutionalized US resident population
ages 18–64 years. Compared to Medicaid non-
expansion states, expansion states had smaller
proportions of black residents and a somewhat
higher average household income, but similar
levels
of
employment
and
homeownership
(for sample characteristics, see Appendix Ex-
hibit S1).27
In 2013 there was a steep gradient in coverage
across income groups: Over 90 percent of Amer-
icans in households with annual incomes of
more than $75,000 were insured (Exhibit 1),
compared to only about 60 percent of Americans
in households with annual incomes of less than
$25,000 per year (63.2 percent in expansion
states and 55.0 percent in nonexpansion states)
(for more detailed results on insurance coverage
by income group, see Appendix Exhibits S2 and

 S3).27 Steep income gradients were also observed
in 2013 for access to a primary care doctor and
avoiding caredue to cost (for detailed results, see
Appendix Exhibits S4–S7).27 Large pre-reform
access gaps were also observed between educa-
tion, employment, and home ownership strata
(for results, see Appendix Exhibits S2–S7).27 By
2015 the income-access gradient had flattened
substantially in Medicaid expansion states, with
smaller changes observed in nonexpansion
states (Exhibit 1).
Changes in access from 2013 to 2015 differed
by household income category. In Medicaid
expansion states, there were large increases in
insurance coverage for the poor under the ACA,
but little change at higher incomes (Exhibit 2).
Gains in access to a primary care provider and
reductions in avoiding care due to cost were also
strongly concentrated among the poor and were
about half the size of the gains in insurance cov-
erage. (Changes for nonexpansion states are
shown in Appendix Exhibits S2–S7.)27
Similar estimates were obtained after we
adjusted for state trends and observed covari-
ates. In Medicaid expansion states, the poor
gained 15.0 percentage points in insurance cov-
erage and 7.7 percentage points in having a pri-
mary care provider. The percentage of poor
respondents avoiding care due to cost fell by
7.5 percentage points (Exhibit 3). Households
with annual incomes above $75,000 experienced
much smaller changes: a 1.9-percentage-point
increase in insurance coverage, a 1.9-percent-
age-point increase in having a primary care pro-
vider, and no change in avoiding care due to cost.
Gains in access were substantially larger among
people who were not college graduates, com-
pared to those who were; renters, compared to
homeowners; and the unemployed, compared to
the employed.
In general, residents of nonexpansion states
also had increased access. However, compared to
people in expansion states, residents of non-
expansion states had smaller gains, and the dis-
tribution of benefits was less concentrated in
lower socioeconomic groups. (For a comparison
of crude and adjusted estimates, see Appendix
Exhibits S2, S4, and S6.)27
To what extent were changes in access attrib-
utable to Medicaid expansion? In adjusted dif-
ference-in-differences models, Medicaid expan-
sion was associated with a 2.2-percentage-point
increase ininsurance coveragein the fullsample,
after adjustment for covariates (Exhibit 3) (95%
confidence interval: 0.8, 3.6). The benefits of
expansion
were
particularly
large
among
respondents in poor households (6.3 percentage
points; 95% CI: 3.2, 9.4) the unemployed (11.0
percentage points; 95% CI: 5.2, 16.8), those who

 were not college graduates (3.2 percentage
points; 95% CI: 1.4, 5.0), and renters (2.8 per-
centage points; 95% CI, 0.2, 5.4). By contrast,
Medicaid expansion was associated with near-
zero changes in coverage among nonpoor
respondents, college graduates, and the em-
ployed.
Changes in access to a primary care provider
and avoiding care due to cost followed patterns
similar to those for insurance coverage, al-
though the changes were smaller. Among poor
Americans, Medicaid expansion reduced the
percentage without a primary care provider by
3.6 percentage points (95% CI: 0.4, 6.8) and the
percentage who avoided medical care due to cost
by 3.5 percentage points (95% CI: 0.4, 6.6) (Ex-
hibit 3). (For a comparison of crude and adjusted
difference-in-differences estimates and coeffi-
cient standard errors, see Appendix Exhibits S2,
S4, and S6.)27 A sensitivity analysis excluding
states that expanded after January 1, 2014, had
similar results. (For results of the sensitivity an-
alyses, see Appendix Exhibits S8 and S9.)27
What was the impact of the ACA on socioeco-
nomic disparities in access? In expansion states,
the gap in insurance coverage between residents
of poor households (with incomes less than
$25,000) and higher-income households (in-
comes more than $75,000) fell by 46 percent
between 2013 and 2015, from 31 percentage
points to 17 percentage points, while in nonex-
pansion states the coverage gap fell by 23 per-
cent, from 36 percentage points to 28 percentage
points (Exhibit 4). Income-related gaps in access
to a primary care provider and avoiding care due
to cost also declined more in expansion states
than in nonexpansion states (Exhibit 4). There
werealso greater reductions in health care access
disparities based on education level and employ-
ment status in expansion versus nonexpansion
states. (For data on both relative and absolute
changes in access gaps based on different socio-
economic characteristics, as well as confidence
intervals, see Appendix Exhibits S10 and S11.)27
Not only did access disparities fall in greater
absolute terms in expansion states compared to

 nonexpansion states, but disparities were also
smaller in expansion states in the first place
(see Appendix Exhibits S2 and S11). States’ opt-
ing out of the ACA Medicaid expansion thus
compounded preexisting access barriers for
their poorer residents, leading to a geographic
divergence in access for poor Americans. In
2013, poor residents of nonexpansion states
were 22 percent (8.2 percentage points) more
likely to be uninsured than poor residents of
expansion states. After the ACA’s passage, this
geographic disparity increased: By 2015, poor
Americans were 66 percent (14.0 percentage
points) more likely to be uninsured if they lived
in a nonexpansion state than if they lived in an
expansion state (see Appendix Exhibit S2).27
Discussion
We examined the extent to which the ACA re-
duced disparities in health care access across
socioeconomic groups and assessed the contri-
bution of Medicaid expansion to these trends.
Americans in groups with lower socioeconomic
status made substantial gains in access during
the first two years of full implementation of the
ACA. Medicaid expansion was responsible for
about half of these gains, with the rest likely
attributable to other aspects of the ACA imple-
mented in all states in 2014, such as the insur-
ance exchanges, federal subsidies for the pur-
chase of insurance for people with incomes of
100–400 percent of poverty, and the individual
mandate. Disparities in access narrowed signifi-
cantly under the ACA, with the gap in coverage
between higher- and lower-income households
falling by 46 percent in Medicaid expansion
states and 23 percent in nonexpansion states.
In spite of the substantial reduction in access
gaps under the ACA, many Americans with
household incomes under $25,000 were still
without coverage in 2015: 35 percent in non-
expansion states and 21 percent in expansion
states. Additionally, in 2015, many low- and mid-
dle-income Americans still reported avoiding
care due to cost and said that they did not have
a primary care provider. Incomplete insurance
uptake might be due to factors such as unaware-
ness of coverage options,42 complicated enroll-
ment processes,43 political attitudes toward the
ACA,44 lack of Medicaid expansion, and the cost
and low perceived value of existing plans. Under-
standing people’s reasons for not taking up in-
surance under the ACA will be important in de-
signing policies to further reduce access gaps.
Health care access disparities in the United
States far exceed those observed in other wealthy
countries, which by and large guarantee some
basic level of health coverage45 (for cross-nation-
al comparisons, see Appendix Exhibit S13).27 Re-
ducing these disparities has been a subject of
national debate since President Harry Truman
proposed universal coverage in 1945. As we have
shown in this analysis, the ACA substantially
improved health insurance coverage and access
to care for the poor and significantly reduced
socioeconomic gaps in health care access in just
two years. The ACA was a highly redistributive
law, directing public resources, financed primar-
ily through taxes on high-income people, to im-
prove health care access among lower-income
Americans. Those who benefited most from
the ACA were those most likely to be excluded
by an employer-based insurance system: the un-
employed, those without a college degree, and
those earning a low income. With significant

Percent changes in health care access gaps between
low- and high-income US adults, 2013 to 2015
SOURCE Authors’ analysis of data for 2011–15 from the Behav-
ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. NOTES The exhibit displays
percent changes from 2013 to 2015 in health care access gaps
between low- and high-income noninstitutionalized US adults
ages 18–64. The data are stratified by whether the state expand-
ed Medicaid. Percent changes were calculated as the access gap
in 2015 divided by the access gap in 2013, minus one. All changes
in access gaps were statistically significant (p < 0:05). Low in-
come means household income of less than $25,000. High income
means household income of more than $75,000. As explained in
more detail in the text, to be considered an expansion state, a
state must have expanded eligibility for Medicaid through the Af-
fordable Care Act by mid-2015. Changes in access gaps by edu-
cational attainment, employment status, and homeownership are
shown in online Appendix Exhibit S8 (see Note 27 in text).

 creasing share of jobs not offering employer-
based health coverage, there is a growing need
for a robust, publicly funded insurance safe-
ty net.
President Trump and Republicans in Congress
have promised to repeal and replace the ACA,
with plans to reduce federal subsidies for Med-
icaid expansion and for low-income (but not
Medicaid-eligible) insurance plans purchased
on the exchanges. Such an approach is likely
to widen gaps in health care access between low-
er-income and better-off Americans, reversing
gains observed under the ACA.
Conclusion
In its first two years of full implementation, the
ACA improved health care access for Americans
in low-income households, people who were not
college graduates, and the unemployed. The
law’s Medicaid expansion was responsible for
about half of these gains. The ACAwas associated
with a substantial (but incomplete) narrowing of
socioeconomic disparities in access, particularly
in states that expanded Medicaid. More research
is needed to determine whether existing access
gains will translate into improved health out-
comes and reductions in health disparities more
broadly, and to monitor future trends in access
disparities in a changing policy environment. ▪
