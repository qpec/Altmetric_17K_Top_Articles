Summary
Each year, hundreds of articles in population health and nutrition, many in high-
profile journals, use standard cutoffs based on weight and height as assessments
of obesity and undernutrition. These global efforts to monitor overweight and
underweight often rest on the assumption that ethnic differences in underlying
body form are sufficiently small to permit universal anthropometric cutoffs for
comparing excess and insufficient body fat across populations. However, a
century of work in human biological variation suggests that human populations
can vary dramatically in underlying body form in a way that may require
population-sensitive cutoffs for monitoring. Here, we describe recently developed
methods that can provide population-sensitive assessments of both excess and
insufficient energy reserves in a wide range of countries. We use this approach
to illustrate how worldwide variation in human body form is far more widespread
than previously thought, and that it can occur at several geographic scales, includ-
ing the level of world regions, countries and populations within countries. The
findings also suggest that using standard cutoffs that ignore this variation can
underestimate current obesity levels in adults by more than 400–500 million while
also incorrectly prioritizing high-risk areas for undernutrition in children in key
regions around the world.

Background
One of the first line tools for the population monitoring of
both overweight and undernutrition is the simple ratio of
a person’s weight to height. For infants and children,
researchers use z-scores of weight divided by height against
a universal reference to assess moderate and severe wasting
(1). Among adults, body mass index (BMI), another weight-
for-height measure, is the most commonly used tool for
monitoring global prevalence and change in obesity (2–4).
In addition to monitoring overnutrition, researchers have
also used BMI to assess population undernutrition in adults
(5,6). Despite the recognition that weight-for-height is only
one of many ways to monitor population differences and
changes in obesity, undernutrition and risk for related
disease states (7–10), a balance between ease and informa-
tiveness contributes to its continued use in a wide range of
settings worldwide.

 Current standards for assessing both overnutrition and
undernutrition with such anthropometric measures have
generally relied on single, one-size-fits-all cutoffs. In 2006,
for example, the WHO published child growth standards
based on a systematic comparison of breastfed infants and
appropriately fed children in six cities around the world –
Davis, USA; Muscat, Oman; Oslo, Norway; Pelotas, Brazil;
Accra, Ghana; and South Delhi, India (1,11). The authors of
the report concluded from this study that the effect of ethnic
differences on the growth of infants and young children is
small compared with the effects of environment. Moreover,
it concluded that for practical purposes, these ethnic differ-
ences are too small to challenge the general use of WHO
growth standards for monitoring undernutrition globally.
Based on the WHO’s recommendation, these standards
have been endorsed by a number of international organiza-
tions, including the United Nations Standing Committee on
Nutrition, the International Union of Nutritional Sciences
and International Pediatric Association. As of 2011, these
standards had been adopted by 125 countries (12).
Among adults, guidelines for the individual identification
and population monitoring of obesity rely heavily on stan-
dard BMI cutoffs, with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg m�2 indicat-
ing overweight and BMI ≥30 kg m�2 indicating obesity
(2,3,13). However, compared with infant growth standards,
there has been more open debate about the appropriateness
of these specific cutoffs as well as the use of BMI more gen-
erally for identifying and monitoring excess body fat. Based
on these discussions, a joint enterprise by the Regional Of-
fice for the Western Pacific of the World Health Organiza-
tion, the International Association for the Study of Obesity
and the International Obesity Task Force published new
recommended criteria in 2000 for overweight and obesity
for populations from the Asia-Pacific region (14,15). The re-
port recommended different cutoffs according to three
broad
population
groupings
with
overweight
defined
among Asian populations at BMI ≥23 kg m�2, European
populations at BMI ≥ 25 kg m�2 and Pacific Island popula-
tions BMI ≥ 27 kg m�2. The cutoffs for obesity were, respec-
tively, 25, 30 and 32 kg m�2. Two years later, the WHO
expert consultation on BMI in Asian populations met to
weigh the evidence for Asia-specific cutoffs. It concluded
that although evidence suggested Asian populations have
substantial risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
ease at BMI <25 kg m�2, that available data suggested too
much variability within Asian populations to support a sin-
gle revised cutoff. It concluded that the standard WHO BMI
cutoffs should be retained, but also identified additional ac-
tion points (e.g. BMI ≥23, 27.5 kg m�2) that individual
countries could use for making decisions about increased
risk for their own populations. Independently, representa-
tives from at least three countries, Japan, India and China,
have crafted their own guidelines based on studies of body
composition and epidemiological studies showing that some
East and South Asian populations exhibit increased risk of
diabetes and cardiovascular disease at much lower levels
of BMI than the European ancestry populations on which
current WHO guidelines were based (16–19). Despite these
rare country-specific modifications, little attention is given
to potentially broader variation in body composition that
might systematically bias BMI as an indicator of excess ad-
iposity across populations (2), and even less attention is
given to variability within major world regions, such as
sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia.
The broadly used universal standards for monitoring un-
dernutrition and overnutrition rely on a basic assumption
that the effects of diet, physical activity and other environ-
mental inputs strongly outweigh any pre-existing ethnic dif-
ferences in body composition (1,20,21). In the case of child
growth, for example, the underlying assumption is that chil-
dren raised in suitable environments will all grow approxi-
mately the same. In contrast to this universal model of
human growth, an ecological model suggests that popula-
tions can vary substantially in underlying body form (22).
The key study underlying current universal WHO standards
for infant growth, the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference
Study, attempted to address this issue by focusing on six in-
ternational field sites (1,11). However, it is not clear how
well these six sites represent the global range of variation
in body form. In terms of adult body mass, direct measures
of lean and fat mass in a few select populations have shown
remarkable variation in body composition in adults (23–
25). However, the degree to which these differences general-
ize to adults and children in a wider range of global samples,
especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America,
North Africa and the Middle East, is currently unknown.
In this paper, we describe recently developed methods
that can estimate such population differences in body com-
position based on the concept of basal slenderness – the ex-
pected weight-for-height in a population living outside of
known obesogenic environments where regular depletion
of energy reserves is typical. Basal slenderness is operation-
alized as basal BMI in adults and basal weight-for-height z-
scores in children. The estimates from these new methods
suggests that a universal model underlying current stan-
dards introduces substantial bias in the identification and
monitoring of overweight and undernutrition in a wide
range of contexts. Moreover, the current set of comparisons
focused on East and South Asian populations are very likely
only the tip of the iceberg of human worldwide variation.
After reviewing key measures of slenderness, we map sub-
stantial variation in the estimated slenderness of popula-
tions that appears to be independent of recent nutrition
transitions. Indeed, the range of variation in body mass
due to variation in slenderness spans at least 1.5 standard
deviations in weight-for-height z-scores among children
and 6.4 kg m�2 in BMI among adults. Next, we show how
this
variation
can

 overnutrition in adults and undernutrition in children in
select populations, and (2) incorrectly inferring population
differences in undernutrition and overnutrition across
populations that are in fact due to variation in slenderness.
We finish by discussing key open questions about variation
in slenderness and its implications for monitoring individual
and population health.
What are key axes of variation in slenderness?
Human biologists have identified a number of dimensions
along which human slenderness varies (22,24–31). A key
axis of variation is the relative length of one’s legs to trunk,
often assessed as the ratio of sitting height to total height
(sitting height ratio). A higher sitting height ratio indicates
that the trunk comprises a larger portion of a person’s stat-
ure. A second axis of variation is the slenderness of limbs –
measured with wrist and knee width (26) – and slenderness
of the trunk – measured with pelvic breadth and shoulder
breadth (32). Variation along any of these axes can change
the relationship between height and fat-free mass. For
example, trunks can contribute more fat-free mass than legs
for the same increase in stature, and stockier trunks and
limbs can contribute more fat-free mass than thinner trunks
and limbs.
Population differences in underlying slenderness can
create very different relationships between body mass
indices and body fat across ethnic groups, with populations
having a more slender build holding much higher quantities
of body fat for the same BMI or WHZ (23–25,33–40).
In addition to proxies of slenderness based on the width
of wrists and knees, there are two methods for estimating
whole body slenderness at the population level. First,
variability in slenderness can be detected through direct
measures of fat mass and fat-free mass, such as dual X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA). It is important to point out here that
raw fat-free mass measured with these techniques is not a
straightforward proxy for slenderness since accruing fat
mass also leads to increasing fat-free mass in two ways –
as a component of adipose tissue and as a result of muscle
strengthening from an increased load. Based on modelling
approaches developed by Garrow, Webster and Burton, it
is possible to parse out this fat-dependent lean mass to esti-
mate one measure of whole body slenderness from direct
measures of fat and fat-free mass – BMI0. This measure
can be interpreted as the mean BMI in a population at the
hypothetical limit of zero body fat (23,41–43). A few obser-
vations illustrate why it is important to interpret BMI0 as a
hypothetical end point that permits us to compare popula-
tions, rather than as a statement about a realizable physio-
logical state. First, the human body requires some fat to
survive. Second, in situations of severe starvation and
anorexia, the relationship between body fat and fat-free
mass appears to diverge from linearity (44–46). While
potentially useful for comparing populations, direct mea-
sures of body composition and thus estimates of BMI0 have
been limited to a rarified set of human populations in
middle-income and high-income countries, such as the
USA, New Zealand and Malaysia (23,24,47).
To expand the existing set of samples beyond the
constraints imposed by direct measures, researchers have
recently developed an alternative estimate of slenderness –
basal body mass index in adults and basal weight-for-
height in children – using anthropometric measures from
populations living in extreme poverty and not yet experienc-
ing a substantial nutrition transitions (48,49). An advantage
of this construct over BMI0 is that it represents the BMI of
real populations, and thus also includes the component of
fat that would exist in these populations even though they
are experiencing substantial deprivation. Specifically, basal
BMI is always greater than BMI0, because basal BMI also
includes gender-specific basal levels of adipose tissue as well
as fat-free mass accumulated in part to support that adipose
tissue. Existing Demographic and Health Surveys in over 50
low-income and middle-income countries provide relevant
data for both adults and children living in extreme poverty
(see Table S5 for countries and current estimates). At the
level of both country and ethnolinguistic group, estimates
of basal BMI for adults and basal weight-for-height for chil-
dren are reliable across age and sex and are stable over
decades (49–51). The intra-class correlation across surveys
within a country is 0.92 for basal BMI and 0.87 for basal
WHZ, and GDP in a survey year cannot account for any
of the between-survey variation in slenderness within
countries (see supplemental materials). As we will describe
later, these indirect estimates of slenderness are also
unrelated to diseases associated with excess or deficient fat
mass (49–51).
What is the extent of population variation in
slenderness?
Estimates of slenderness from both direct and indirect mea-
sures of fat-free mass exhibit striking variation across popu-
lations. For example, DXA-based estimates of BMI0 from a
very limited set of populations residing in the USA and New
Zealand exhibited a range of more than 4 kg m�2 between
the least slender (New Zealand Pacific Islander) and most
slender populations (New Zealand South Asian) (23). That
is, if we compare two individuals from these populations
with the same quantity of fat, we would expect the BMI of
the Pacific Islander to be on average 4 kg m�2 greater than
the South Asian.
The fuller array of worldwide populations considered
with indirect measures of slenderness exhibit even greater
variation. For example, in the over 50 low-income and
middle-income countries covered by Demographic and
Health Surveys, adult female basal BMI shows a range of

 5.0 kg m�2
across
countries
and
6.4 kg m�2
across
ethnolinguistic groups (49,51). Similarly, basal weight-for-
height z-scores among children show a range of greater than
1 SD across countries and 1.5 SD across ethnolinguistic
groups (50,51). It is important to emphasize that these
differences in basal BMI and basal WHZ were estimated
among populations that all live in situations of extreme
poverty and have not yet experienced a substantial nutrition
transition. Thus, these differences cannot be attributed to
differences in wealth or nutrition. Indeed, there are only
low
correlations
between
slenderness
estimates
and
country-level estimates of GDP or ethnicity-level estimates
of household wealth (49–51).
Notably, these estimates of basal BMI and WHZ are also
consistent with classic population differences observed by
human biologists and anthropologists. For example, one
of the populations with the lowest estimates of basal BMI
and basal WHZ are the Nuer of East Africa, a group that
human biologists have traditionally used to represent the
extreme end of human variation in slenderness (51). There
are similarly low levels of basal BMI and WHZ among
South Asian populations, which are consistent with an
emerging body of literature on body composition in that
region (17).
The variation observed in slenderness is of comparable
magnitude to the increases in body mass observed with im-
proving economic conditions and nutrition. For example,
women in the wealthiest households in Demographic and
Health Survey datasets (>20,000 USD 2011 equivalent,
purchasing power parity) have approximately 5 kg m�2
greater raw BMI than women in the poorest households
(<200 USD 2011 equivalent, purchasing power parity) (49)
(Table 1). This spread is of comparable magnitude to the
maximally estimated differences across populations in
basal BMI (5.0 kg m�2 across countries and 6.4 kg m�2
across ethnolinguistic grouprs). As another point of com-
parison, the maximally estimated differences in basal BMI
are larger than the mean gain in age-adjusted BMI among
U.S. white, U.S. women (> 20 years) during the 40-year rise
of obesity in the USA (4.4 kg m�2, 1970–2010) (52,53)
(Table 1). Child populations show even greater variation
in basal weight-for-height relative to observed variation
because of economic resources. For example, children in
the wealthiest households in Demographic and Health
datasets have on average 0.5 SD greater raw weight-for-
height z-scores than children in the poorest households,
while the maximally estimated difference in basal WHZ is
1.0 SD across countries and 1.5 SD across ethnolinguistic
groups (54).
Although much of this variation in basal BMI arises at
the coarse-grained level of world regions, there is also
substantial variation within world regions. For example,
if we estimate basal slenderness at the level of adminis-
trative subdistricts within low-income and middle-income
countries, we can estimate how much of the variation in
slenderness occurs at different regional scales – between
major
World
Bank
regions,
between
countries
and
between
administrative
subdistricts
(see
supplemental
materials, SM). On average, most of the variations in
bBMI and bWHZ in these samples occur between coun-
tries (84% of bBMI and 85% of bWHZ), and there is
substantial variation both across World Bank regions
and between countries within World Bank regions (SM
Table S.3).
Substantial geographic variation also exists within a
number of countries, most notably countries bordering the
African Sahel (Cameroon, Chad, Mauritania and Nigeria)
and countries at the border of South Asia and Central Asia
(Nepal, Pakistan and India) (all with SD in bWHZ >0.20
SD and SD in bBMI >0.50 kg m�2) (SM Table S.4).
These population differences in basal slenderness account
for a non-trivial portion of the overall variance in age-
adjusted BMI and WHZ (Table 2, see SM for analyses).
Specifically, they account for over 50% of the variance in
age-adjusted BMI and WHZ between World Bank regions
and between countries. They also account for 25% of the
variance in BMI and 71% of the variance in WHZ observed
between subdistricts within countries. These results suggest
that basal slenderness in both adults and children accounts
for a substantial portion of the variance in observed BMI
and WHZ at several geographic scales.
Where do these differences come from?
As most research efforts have been devoted to the origins of
variation in fat mass and obesity, we know comparatively

 less about what gives rise to population variation in fat-free
mass. There are a number of possible reasons for these
differences.
Variation
in
nutritional
ecology
and
the
proportion of calories coming from protein and other
macronutritients
may
play
a
role
(51).
Additionally,
variation in activities that lead to muscle strengthening or
muscle loss, variation in exposure to infectious diseases,
underlying genetic variation, as well as effects of the
intrauterine environment are all possible explanations (51).
Recent evidence, however, puts relatively strong con-
straints on how and when such population differences
arise. First, population differences in slenderness are highly
conserved over the life course, with children’s weight-for-
height z-scores strongly correlated with adult’s basal BMI
(49,50,55). Moreover, most of the variation in bBMI and
bWHZ can be attributed to genetic affinity between popu-
lations, with very little additional association of environ-
mental variables (51). Future work should explore the
degree to which nutritional ecology (e.g. child feeding)
and mode of subsistence (e.g. pastoralists vs. agricultural-
ists) play a role in these differences, as well as potential ge-
netic mechanisms and interactions with environmental
inputs.
Are population differences big enough to matter
for public health monitoring?
Converging lines of evidence suggest that these substantial
population differences in slenderness can lead to underesti-
mation of disease risk in specific regions. For example, a
growing body of literature focusing on the ‘thin–fat’ pheno-
type in south Asian populations, and to a lesser extent East
Asian populations, suggests that risk for diabetes, metabolic
disorders, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality
begin at much lower BMIs than for European populations
(17–19,56–68).
These findings are consistent with a two-compartment
model of body mass. The first component comprises the un-
derlying or basal weight-for-height expected in a population
before accruing additional body fat through contemporary
nutrition transitions. This basal level of slenderness should
be uncorrelated with diseases associated with either excess
fat (e.g. diabetes) or deficient energy reserves (e.g. infectious
diseases). The second component – referred to here as resid-
ual body mass – is the additional mass accrued as fat is
deposited. This second component should be correlated
positively with diabetes and fat-linked metabolic disorders
and negatively associated with infectious diseases. Our
own research has demonstrated that indeed population
slenderness is largely uncorrelated with these disease states,
while residual body mass reflecting accumulated fat mass in
adults is positively associated with the prevalence of
diabetes (51) and residual WHZ reflecting energy reserves
in children is negatively associated with infectious disease
risk (Hadley and Hruschka, submitted). As expected from
a two-compartment model, bBMI and bWHZ are also
uncorrelated with the depth of calorie deficits estimated
from food balance sheets, while residual BMI and residual
WHZ show substantial negative correlations with such
calorie deficits (Table S1).
To illustrate how disregarding differences in basal BMI
can lead to misclassification, we can assign each country
an adjusted BMI cutoff for overweight and obesity as
follows. If the basal BMI of the original European ances-
try reference populations is bBMIref and the basal BMI
estimate for the country of interest is bBMIi, then the
adjusted cutoff for that country would be 25 – bBMIref
+ bBMIi for overweight and 30 – bBMIref + bBMIi for
obesity. Although no European countries satisfy the strict
conditions for estimating bBMI, the best estimate we have
for bBMIref from the original reference populations –
European ancestry populations – is Albania (bBMI = 22.4).
This leads to an adjusted overweight cutoffs varying from
less than 22 in India and Yemen to 22.7 in Ethiopia and
22.4 in Timor L’Este to over 25.5 in Bolivia and Lesotho.
Using these cutoffs, we find underestimation of overweight
in a number of countries by 40% or more in a wide range
of
countries in
sub-Saharan Africa,
South Asia and
Southeast Asia (Fig. 1). Importantly, there is also dramatic
variation within World Bank regions in the degree of
underestimation.
For
example,
Lesotho,
Egypt
and
Rwanda show almost no difference between prevalence
estimates from raw and adjusted cutoffs as their basal
BMI estimates are quite close to the European reference.
These adjusted cutoffs suggest that global estimates of
overweight based on a universal BMI standard currently
underestimate the number of overweight adults globally
by more than 300 million (3), with the excess concen-
trated in South Asia (254 million) and sub-Saharan Africa

versal and BMI-adjusted cutoffs in countries with >40% underestimation

 (45 million). Notably, this figure does not include many
countries with large populations from East and Southeast
Asia – China, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines, Vietnam,
Thailand, Myanmar and South Korea – where populations
likely also have much higher levels of overweight than
suggested
by
current
WHO
standards
(69).
Using
Asia-specific or China-specific cutoffs in China alone would
be estimated to add another 100-200 million cases of
overweight to current estimates based on universal cutoffs
(69). Thus, universal cutoffs conservatively underestimate
global overweight in adults by more than 400–500 million
cases.
Conversely, in those populations with greater average
stockiness, we find substantial underdetection of under-
weight in adults. Specifically, underweight among adult
women is underestimated by more than 30% in many coun-
tries in Latin American (Bolivia, Honduras, Nicaragua and
Peru) and southeastern Africa (Lesotho and Swaziland). A
similar problem arises with detection of moderate undernu-
trition in children. For example, the ranking of countries by
the prevalence of moderate wasting shifts dramatically in a
number of regions when adjusting for basal WHZ. When
adjusted for basal WHZ, we see an increasing priority of
countries in West Africa (Sao Tome and Principe 1st from
16th, Benin 2nd from 13th, Sierra Leone 5th from 25th,
Nigeria 4th from 9th), North Africa (Morocco 11th from
35th, Egypt 12th from 43rd), and southeastern Africa
(Malawi
13th
from
38th,
Zambia
21st
from
41st,
Mozambique 26th from 36th, Lesotho 37th from 44th,
Swaziland 39th from 48th, Zimbabwe 29th from 42nd).
Thus, relying on unadjusted weight-for-height z-scores for
population monitoring can potentially lead to skewed prior-
itization of high-risk areas. For example, if one simply maps
WHZ across Africa, it would appear that countries in West
Africa (Sierra Leone and Benin) and southeastern Africa
(Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique and Zimbabwe) have
much lower levels of undernutrition than Madagascar or
regions bordering the Sahel (70–72). Estimates of basal
WHZ, however, suggest that much of this variation reflects
differences in basal body form.
These differences in body form also raise important
challenges when interpreting population differences in
BMI and bWHZ as reflecting nutritional and health differ-
ences between these populations. This is most apparent for
comparisons between world regions, such as South Asia ver-
sus sub-Saharan Africa (73). For example, Dreze and
Deaton recently interpreted lower weight-for-height scores
in India relative to sub-Saharan Africa as an indicator of
worse nutritional status and health. It is equally possible
that these differences could result from underlying differ-
ences in body form. The possibility for substantial regional
and ethnic variability in slenderness within some countries
also highlights the importance of interpreting ethnic or re-
gional differences in BMI or WHZ with caution (74).
How do these differences affect the
interpretation of other anthropometric
standards?
Body mass index and weight-for-height z-scores are some
of the most commonly used first line indicators of excess
fat or undernutrition. However, they are only two of a
number of fast and practical measurements used by re-
searchers for these purposes. Other measures included
waist circumference (75–77), waist-to-hip ratio (7) and
waist-to-height ratio (78) as assessments of abdominal obe-
sity in adults and mid-upper arm circumference for
assessing undernutrition in children and adults (8,79). With
new advances in mobile data collection and integration,
one might also imagine novel techniques that can integrate
multiple photographs from a cell phone to identify new di-
mensions of body shape (80). Though diverse, these tech-
niques all rely on external assessments of body form and
the assumption that this can tell us something about inter-
nal body composition and disease risk. As such, standards
based on these techniques face the same potential chal-
lenges we have outlined for universal standards based on
weight-for-height. Specifically, universal standards applied
to any of these diverse measurements would require the as-
sumption that human bodies are built in sufficiently similar
ways that similar external measurements imply similar in-
ternal states. Given the very large variation in basal BMI
and basal WHZ estimated here, it is highly plausible that
these other measures of body form will also confound pop-
ulation variation in slenderness with variation in fat and
energy reserves. Indeed, as an empirical database begins
to emerge for these other measures of body shape, such as
waist circumference, public health researchers have begun
to make preliminary population-based recommendations
for such measures as well (15). An approach that acknowl-
edges the possibility for population variation at multiple
scales, from the world regional to the sub-national, will
likely be required to identify when and at what scales suffi-
ciently large bias is introduced by universal standards to
warrant context-sensitive standards.

population variation in slenderness that can strongly bias
weight-for-height as an indicator of fat-linked disease risk.
Our indirect measures of slenderness from demographic
and health surveys in a much wider global sample further
suggest that such biases are far more widespread. Moreover,
there is substantial between-country variation in slenderness
within world regions, such as South Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa, as well as remarkable variation in estimated slender-
ness within select countries. The existence of substantial

 variation at multiple geographic scales further suggests that
broad population groupings for population-specific cutoffs
(e.g. ‘Asian’, ‘East Asian’, ‘South Asian’ and ‘African’)
may still mask considerable variation in slenderness within
countries and world regions. These differences in slender-
ness have been most studied for adults, but they mirror dif-
ferences in infants that may also alter the meaning of WHZ
as an indicator of wasting and undernutrition. We have also
described how such biases can potentially lead to inappro-
priate comparisons of disease risk between world regions,
between countries and in some cases between populations
within countries.
These indirect measures give a glimpse of the potential
worldwide variation in slenderness and its impact on moni-
toring of excess and deficient energy reserves. However,
these current estimates are based on indirect methods, and
future studies are needed to assess how well these indirect
estimates
accurately
reflect
slenderness
variation
in
understudied populations from sub-Saharan Africa, North
Africa and the Middle East, Latin America various regions
across South Asia. This will become increasingly important
as populations in these understudied regions begin to bear
the burden of emerging nutrition transitions. Immigration
studies that examine how slenderness and body composi-
tion change (or do not change) as immigrants move to
new host populations will hopefully shed light on the degree
to which such differences in slenderness can arise from
changing nutrition and physical activity. If such differences
in slenderness are relatively stable within populations, as
recent studies suggest (24,51), then it should be possible to
validate these indirect measures of slenderness through
targeted sampling of immigrant populations where direct
measures of body composition – for example, dual X-ray
absorptiometry – are readily available. In addition to identi-
fying countries and regions as higher priority areas than
current assessments would indicate (e.g. Yemen and parts
of sub-Saharan Africa for obesity-linked diseases and parts
of West Africa, North Africa and southeastern Africa for
undernutrition), validated estimates could provide impor-
tant guidance for health practitioners in multicultural
settings, such as the U.S., when assessing risk and aiming
prevention at groups from diverse world regions (14).
Simple, common standards for assessing disease risk
provide a number of important benefits. They can increase
the efficiency of global health monitoring and clinical
assessment, can avoid confusion in health promotion and
can facilitate communication about risk across diverse
academic, clinical and public health fields (14). Common
standards can also play a role in ensuring a shared, equitable
benchmark for identifying those individuals and populations
most at risk (81). For these reasons, universality of standards
is an important goal in public health practice and communica-
tion. Another equally important goal is to ensure that these
standards have similar meanings in terms of physiology and
disease risk when applied across a diverse range of human
populations. Given well-established biological variation that
exists across human groups, these two aims must inevitably
be traded off in any decision about when and under what
conditions it is sufficient to have a single universal standard.
We review a range of emerging evidence that current
tandards of weight-for-height can introduce substantial bias
in assessment of body composition and related disease risk
at global, regional and national scales. A key challenge in fu-
ture work will be to determine at what scales context-specific
standards will provide the best balance between the two
important aims of simplicity of implementation and accuracy
in informing public health priorities and clinical decisions.
