This paper provides guidance on the conduct of new in vivo and in vitro studies on high molecular weight
food additives, with carrageenan, the widely used food additive, as a case study. It is important to un-
derstand the physical/chemical properties and to verify the identity/purity, molecular weight and ho-
mogeneity/stability of the additive in the vehicle for oral delivery. The strong binding of CGN to protein in
rodent chow or infant formula results in no gastrointestinal tract exposure to free CGN. It is recom-
mended that doses of high Mw non-caloric, non-nutritive additives not exceed 5% by weight of total solid
diet to avoid potential nutritional effects. Addition of some high Mw additives at high concentrations to
liquid nutritional supplements increases viscosity and may affect palatability, caloric intake and body
weight gain. In in vitro studies, the use of well-characterized, relevant cell types and the appropriate
composition of the culture media are necessary for proper conduct and interpretation. CGN is bound to
media protein and not freely accessible to cells in vitro. Interpretation of new studies on food additives
should consider the interaction of food additives with the vehicle components and the appropriateness
of the animal or cell model and doseeresponse.

1. Introduction
The study of food additives presents some unique challenges to
the researcher. Some basic parameters and pitfalls are discussed to
assist researchers in the design of improved in vivo and in vitro
studies with high weight-average molecular weight (Mw) food
additives, in general, and Carrageenan (CGN), in particular. Exam-
ples from the literature on CGN, a non-nutritive, non-caloric and
safe additive, are used to illustrate some of these parameters and
pitfalls. Thus, this paper is primarily about non-nutritive, non-
caloric, non-absorbable high Mw food additives, similar to CGN,
and CGN, in particular, though many principles may apply to food
additives in general.
The basic principles of good scientific conduct, as outlined by
IPCS (1987, 2009), OECD (2015) and the US FDA (2000, 2007) should
be used for guidance in the design of robust, scientifically sound
studies. This paper discusses the importance of test material
identity/purity and an understanding of its physical/chemical
properties; the appropriate choice of vehicles, dose selection and
the interpretation of data obtained from in vivo studies. Parameters
specific to diet, drinking water and infant formula as vehicles are
considered. Food additives should be tested in the vehicle most
appropriate to their use in humans. It is important to include a
negative vehicle control group. A positive control group may also be
needed, depending on the specific parameters under evaluation
in vivo.
With efforts to implement the 3Rs: Reduce, Refine and Replace
animals globally, the proper design and conduct of in vitro studies is
critically important for their interpretation and use for human risk
assessment

 Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing. Parameters important
to assess in in vitro studies include test material identity/purity;
choice and composition of culture medium; inclusion of adequate
negative and positive controls; choice of cell lines and interpreta-
tion and relevance of the in vitro data to hazard identification and
risk characterization in humans. For example, see Jia and Liu (2007)
for a summary of appropriate parameters for in vitro study conduct
as related to drug metabolism. Although immortalized cell lines
derived from tumor tissues can be a valuable tool for identifying
potential mechanisms of action that can then be tested in vivo, it is
important to understand how these lines may differ from their
in vivo counterparts. In some cases more relevant information may
be obtained by using primary cell cultures established from normal
tissues.
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate positive and negative
factors in study design strategies. This paper is not intended to be a
review of the results on specific food additives, rather it is intended
to discuss the pitfalls and the proper parameters for the design and
conduct of meaningful in vivo and in vitro studies.
It is hoped that this paper will provide the researcher with an
understanding of critical factors to consider in the design of new
research studies on food additives, with emphasis on the literature
on CGN, and will assist journal peer reviewers in evaluating
manuscripts.
1.1. Importance of sample identity and purity
The identity and purity of a food additive should be evaluated
prior to its use in a new study. The case of CGN is a good example to
illustrate the importance of test material identity. The literature
published on CGN spans more than half a century and includes a
wide variety of CGN test materials, scientific methods, and study
designs.
1.1.1. High molecular weight food additives in general
Full characterization of the test sample for purity, viscosity,
where applicable, and possible identification of contaminants,
including microbial contaminants, should be evaluated prior to its
use in a new toxicity study and is essential to the interpretation of
results and observations. Certificates of Analysis, including those
from commercial chemical supply houses, can vary in quality. It is
recommended that the composition, purity and Mw or viscosity of
the food additive sample, as well as, the presence of exogenous
contaminants and microbes, be independently confirmed by the
researcher. Contamination of a food additive sample with micro-
organisms can increase or add endotoxins which may influence the
biological effects and result in misinterpretation of some responses,
as due to the food additive, rather than the microbial contami-
nant(s). If the food additive is stated to meet a particular com-
pendial specification, the test sample must be produced, shipped,
handled and stored according to appropriate Good Manufacturing
Practices (GMPs) (IFAC, 2013) and meet the stated attributes/
specifications of the particular compendial monograph (e.g. Food
Chemical Codex).
For studies conducted under GLP, the food additive sample
should be stored in a GLP-approved cabinet under appropriate
storage conditions before, during and after a study. Determination
of test sample stability during the length of the study is required.
Purity and Mw/viscosity analyses should be conducted before
initiation of the study, at appropriate intervals during the study,
depending on the length of the study, and at or shortly after
termination of the in-life phase of the study. These principles apply
to all food additive samples. The case of CGN below illustrates
potential problems that can arise when test material identity is not
completely verified or disclosed.
1.1.2. Carrageenan as a case study
The case of CGN is a good example to illustrate the importance of
test material identity. CGN is a high weight-average molecular
weight (Mw) polysaccharide of ~200e800 kiloDaltons (kDa)
derived from seaweed, and consisting of repeating disaccharide
units of galactose and 3, 6-anhydrogalactose, both sulfated and
non-sulfated, joined by alternating a-(1,3) and b-(1,4) links
(Blakemore and Harpell, 2010). Regulatory specifications exist for
CGN approved for use in food (Commission Regulation, 2012; Food
Chemical
Codex,
2015;
FAO,
2014;
Japan
Food
Additives
Association, 2009 and US 21 CFR 172.620). To be designated as
meeting a particular compendia, the CGN test sample must comply
with the appropriate GMPs and meet the stated attributes/speci-
fications of the monograph (IFAC, 2013), as indicated above.
Carrageenan can exist in several different forms. Table 1 below
summarizes important identity characteristics to evaluate in CGN
samples used in research studies. Regulatory specifications must be
met for carrageenan labeled for use in food. Researchers are
responsible for verifying the purity and compliance with specifi-
cations prior to using the sample they have obtained.
The three main forms are kappa (k), lambda (l) and iota (i) CGN;
these forms differ in the content of 3, 6-anhydrogalactose and ester
sulfate and in their functional properties (see Table 2 for additional
information on functionality).
In contrast to CGN, poligeenan (PGN) is generated by acid hy-
drolysis (pH 0.9e1.3) of seaweed extract at high temperatures
(>80 �C) for several hours (Blakemore and Harpell, 2010; Weiner,
2014). PGN has a molecular weight of 10e20 kDa, an order of
magnitude or more lower than that of CGN used in food applica-
tions. PGN was formerly referred to as “degraded carrageenan”.
However, due to substantial confusion in the literature, and the
ensuing implications caused by the confusion, the name “poli-
geenan” was adopted by the United States (US) Adopted Names
Council (USAN) (USAN, 1988).
CGN and PGN are different substances with the same structural
backbone, but very different molecular weights, physical/chemical
properties, and toxicological properties. Thus, this misnomer has
led to errors in the interpretation of CGN effects in animals,
resulting in unwarranted concerns regarding the safety of the food
additive CGN. PGN is capable of causing gastrointestinal irritation
in experimental animals and is considered to cause gastrointestinal
cancer in animals (IARC, 1983). CGN does not cause these effects
and is safe at maximally administered oral doses (IARC,1983; JECFA,
2015; Michel and MacFarlane, 1996; Weiner, 2014). For example,
Weiner et al. (2007) calculated the amount of CGN consumed by
rats administered a maximal dose of 5% k-CGN in diet for 90 days to
be 3394 ± 706 mg/kg bw/day in males and 3867 ± 647 mg/kg bw/
day in females. Examples abound in the literature regarding the
injection of CGN into the rat or mouse footpad, resulting in
inflammation and edema, as a screen for anti-inflammatory drugs.
The injection (intraperitoneal, intramuscular or intravenous) routes
of exposure in the footpad inflammation model and other research
studies by non-oral routes are not relevant to dietary exposure to
food additive CGN, but have often led to confusion on the safety of
CGN (see Weiner, 2014).
CGN has been shown to be safe as a food additive (JECFA, 2008,
2015; SCF, 1978; European Commission, 2003; US Code 21 CFR
Section 172.620). To clarify the confusion between CGN and PGN,
Beattie et al. (2014) published a formal corrigendum to their earlier
publication (Beattie et al., 1970) in which the terms CGN and
“degraded carrageenan” (PGN) were used interchangeably. Unfor-
tunately, the term “poligeenan” for “degraded carrageenan” has not
been widely adopted. For example, Tobacman (2001) did not use
the term PGN in a review on the two materials. Tobacman (2001)
also used the term “undegraded CGN” for high Mw CGN test

32
 materials which may not have been analyzed, specified for Mw or
purity and generally were not food-grade CGN materials. Tobacman
(2001) also made statements regarding the uses and toxicological
properties of CGN which were both correct and incorrect, creating
additional confusion. Bixler (2013) highlighted some of the prob-
lems resulting from the review by Tobacman (2001), and Weiner
(2014) and McKim (2014) have clarified the inconsistencies.
The confusion between CGN and PGN makes selection, verifi-
cation and analyses of a test sample for research studies critically
important. See the reviews of Weiner (2014) and McKim (2014).
Blakemore et al. (2014c) and Beattie et al. (2014) discuss the
chemical and Mw differences between CGN and PGN and the
importance of correct sample identity and nomenclature in detail.
When choosing a CGN sample for use in an experiment, it is
critical to determine the sample's composition and purity. Some
commercial CGN samples have been standardized by the addition
of sugar diluents. For example, McKim (2014) reported that analysis
of a commercial sample labeled as l-CGN from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO) actually contained a significant amount of sugar (36%) as a
diluent and of k-CGN (38%), a different type of CGN than stated on
the label. Thus, according to McKim (2014), the sample labeled as
pure l-CGN contained only 26% l-CGN. Hypothetically, if one as-
sumes that this sample is 100% CGN, then the CGN dose adminis-
tered in a toxicity study will actually be a fraction of the nominal
dose: (0.64) x (100 mg/kg, target dose) ¼ 64 mg/kg as both l- and k-
CGN. Such inaccuracy can result in erroneous interpretations on the
potency and doseeresponse to CGN on experimental parameters in
a study and inconsistencies when comparing the results of this
sample to other studies with higher purity samples.
CGN achieves its functionality as a food and emulsion stabilizer
due to its high Mw and binding capacity to proteins in food through
charged sulfate and carboxyl groups (Blakemore and Harpell, 2010).
The Mw of CGN is critically important to its functionality in food.
Viscosity in centipoise (cps) is used as a readily measurable esti-
mation of Mw. Thus, a viscosity, measured in water, of “not less than
5 cps for a 1.5% solution at 75 �C” is used as a regulatory specifi-
cation for CGN permitted in food (Commission Regulation, 2012;
Food Chemical Codex, 2015; Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) of the United Nations, 2014; and Japan Food Additives
Association, 2009). This minimum viscosity corresponds to a Mw
of 100e150 kDa depending on the cations present (Blakemore and
Harpell, 2010, Blakemore, personal communication, 2015). In
contrast to CGN, PGN lacks functionality as a stabilizer in food due
to its much lower Mw (10e20 kDa) and lower viscosity, estimated
at 0.3e0.8 cps using the CGN specification method (Blakemore,
2015, personal communication). PGN is not approved for food ad-
ditive use.
Appendix 1 from Blakemore et al. (2014a) is a table titled,
“Analysis of Carrageenan Test Material e Lot 90303011.” The test
sample identified in Appendix 1 was used in a 28-day piglet infant
formula toxicity and toxicokinetic study (Weiner et al., 2015) and
serves to illustrate a thorough analysis of a CGN test sample used in
an animal study. The analyses of the test sample in Appendix 1
shows that the CGN purity and Mw did not change during the

 two years of monitoring, stored in a sealed container at room
temperature as per Good Laboratory Practice guidelines (GLP)
(Blakemore et al., 2014a).
It is important to evaluate the test sample for microbial
contamination. Appendix 1 shows the complete microbial analyses
of a CGN sample, including the following counts: aerobic total plate
count, aerobic mesophilic spores, anaerobic mesophilic spores,
Coliforms Escherichia coli, mold, yeast, Salmonella spp., thermo-
philic aerobic spores and thermophilic anaerobic spores. Standard
sample identity and purity evaluation have not been done in many
published studies, particularly studies prior to the advent of GLP.
See Weiner (2014) for a summary of CGN test samples referenced in
that literature review.
Appendix 1 shows purity and stability analyses of the same CGN
test sample at approximately six month intervals over a two-year
period, encompassing before study initiation until after study
completion for the test sample stored in a GLP storage closet in a
sealed container at room temperature.
1.1.3. Summary
It is critically important to evaluate the purity, composition, Mw
or viscosity, contaminants and microbial contaminants of a test
sample of a food additive prior to initiation of a study. The test
sample should have a unique lot number and identification of the
supplier of the sample, as required by GLP (FDA, 2014). Certificates
of analysis should be obtained, but additional verification of the test
sample should be made by researchers prior to use.
2. Considerations in the design of in vivo studies
2.1. The importance of vehicle
2.1.1. High molecular weight food additives in general
Selection of a vehicle for administration of a food additive
should be based on the use of the study to extrapolate to humans,
as indicated by the FDA (2007) for diet, drinking water, oral gavage
or capsules. Food additives should be tested in the vehicle most
appropriate to their use in humans. In the case of high Mw food
additives in general, diet, drinking water, infant formula, liquid
nutritional supplements and milk are possible vehicles for human
exposure evaluation. It is important to understand the physical/
chemical properties of the food additive and its interactions with
the specific vehicle used for a study.
2.1.2. Carrageenan as a case study
CGN has many charged sulfate groups which bind strongly to
charged groups of amino acids in food proteins or proteins present
in vehicles. Thus, CGN remains strongly bound to protein in diet,
milk,
infant
formula,
and
liquid
nutritional
supplements
(Blakemore and Harpell, 2010). Due to its high Mw and strong
binding to food proteins, CGN is not absorbed from or metabolized
in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (reviewed by Weiner, 2014). Thus,
when mixing CGN in a vehicle, it is important to understand the
interactions of the CGN molecule with the components of the
vehicle. When protein is present in a vehicle, CGN binds strongly to
the protein through divalent cations or directly to the proteins’
charged amino and carboxyl groups, as shown below in Fig. 1.
Above the isoelectric point of the protein, the negatively-
charged sulfate groups (SO4
-) of CGN bind through positively
charged divalent cations (Caþþ) to the protein's negatively-charged
carboxyl groups (CO2
-) as in Fig. 1A or directly to the protein's
positively-charged amino groups (NH3
þ) as in Fig. 1B. Below the
protein's isoelectric point, CGN's negatively-charged sulfate groups
bind directly with the protein's positively-charged amino groups as
in Fig. 1C. The strong binding interactions of CGN and protein in
food results in a stabilizing effect which provides functional prop-
erties to the mixture.
2.2. Diet as a vehicle
2.2.1. High molecular weight food additives in general
Rodent chow is a common vehicle used to administer food ad-
ditives in animal studies. Standard rodent or non-rodent diets are
available with ingredients that support the health, growth and
nutrition of the test animals. Typically, commercial rodent chow
contains about 25% protein (www.LabDiet.com). Food additives
may be added to commercial rodent diet using standard methods
to mix test sample to ensure homogeneity and stability in the diet.
Before starting a new dietary study, it is necessary to verify the
homogeneity and stability of the food additive-containing diet by
(1) taking test diet samples from the top, middle and bottom layers
of the diet mixed with test sample and (2) analyzing for the food
additive by appropriate analytical methods. Stability of food addi-
tive in the treated diet should be determined by measuring its
concentration at selected intervals after preparation of treated diet,
for example one, two, three and four weeks after mixing. GLP
require that treated diets or vehicles are analyzed for both homo-
geneity and stability of test sample (FDA, 2014).
Once stability data have been determined to support test ma-
terial stability over a given storage time, the test diets for the study
can be mixed and sampled at intervals that coincide with the sta-
bility data for preparation of new diets. For example, if eleven day
stability data show no change in stability, fresh diets can be pre-
pared after ten days. The concentration of test material in the fresh
diets should be measured prior to feeding the animals on study.
When the diets need to be prepared again during the study, the
initial stability data serves as a guide in the timing of new diet
Fig. 1. CGN binding to protein in food or vehicle (Weiner, 2014).

 preparation. Additional time should be included in the study
schedule to allow for re-formulation of diets, if necessary, due to
poor homogeneity.
Dose selection for dietary studies should consider the potential
effects of replacing a high percentage of the diet with a high Mw,
non-caloric, non-nutritive food additive. According to regulatory
guidance, subchronic and chronic dietary studies are generally
limited to a dose of food additive not to exceed 5% by weight of the
total dietary intake (FDA, 2007): “When the test substance has no
caloric value and constitutes a substantial amount of the diet (e.g.,
more than 5%), both caloric and nutrient densities of the high dose
diet would be diluted in comparison to the diets of the other
groups. As a consequence, some high dose animals may receive
higher test article doses than expected because animals fed such
diluted diets ad libitum may eat more than animals in other dosed
groups to compensate for the differences in energy and nutrient
content of the high dose diets. Such circumstances make it espe-
cially important that feed consumption of these animals be as
closely and accurately monitored as possible in order to determine
whether changes observed could be due to overt toxicity of the test
substance or to a dietary imbalance.”
It should be noted that the FDA (2007) statement above
generally refers to dry diets, such as rodent chow, and does not
address liquid dietary vehicles. Liquid dietary vehicles present
other challenges when the concentration of a high Mw food addi-
tive influences the viscosity and palatability of the formulation (see
Section 2.4.1 below).
If doses greater than 5% by weight of a high Mw, non-nutritive
food additive are added to a dry diet, such as rodent chow, the
treated diet may not be nutritionally adequate. At concentrations
greater than 5% food additive in diet, animals may eat more food to
compensate for the lower caloric and nutritional intake. The FDA
recommends that if doses in dietary studies exceed 5% in the diet,
additional controls may be needed to evaluate the effect on the
nutritional status (FDA, 2007). Interpretation of effects seen with a
particular food additive at concentrations >5% in dry diet should
consider the possible confounding effects of nutritional deficiency
resulting from the high level in diet.
FDA (2000) also indicates that when a food additive may have an
effect on feed consumption due to unpleasant taste or texture, a paired
feeding study design can be included in a study to eliminate differ-
ences in feed consumption between control and treated groups. An-
imals should be singly housed for accurate daily measurement of feed
consumption so that both treated and control animals receive the
same amount of feed (FDA, 2000). Mayhew et al. (2003) report that
neotame, a sweetener with intense taste, reduced feed consumption,
body weight and body weight gain due to poor palatability of treated
diets with maximum tolerated doses levels (35,000 ppm or 3.5% in
diet) in rats, dogs and mice. These effects were considered due to poor
palatability, not toxicity, and hence body weight parameters are not
appropriate endpoints for setting the no observed effect levels
(NOELs) for neotame (Mayhew et al., 2003). EFSA (2007) concluded
that the reduced feed consumption, body weight and body weight
gain of neotame-treated animals, compared to control animals, were
not adverse effects, indicative of toxicity, but were due to reduced
palatability of the neotame-treated diets. EFSA (2007) based a no
observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 200 mg/kg bw/day neotame
on increased hepatic alkaline phosphatase (AP) enzyme levels, not on
the body weight effects. EFSA (2007) considered the increase in AP to
be the critical endpoint for determination of an Acceptable Daily
Intake of 0e2 mg/kg/day, by application of a 100-fold safety factor to
the NOAEL of 200 mg/kg in the 52-week dietary study in dogs (EFSA,
2007). Thus, the effects of food additives on dietary palatability,
including taste, should be considered and understood in study design
and interpretation.
2.2.2. Carrageenan as a case study
Addition of CGN to diet provides a stable complex which re-
mains intact through much of the GIT. In addition to lowering
protein concentrations in the feed proportionally, high levels of
CGN (�5% in diet) will also “tie up” significant levels of feed protein
by binding and may prevent or slow protein utilization in the GIT of
the animal. In the stomach, the protein-CGN complexes precipitate
due to the acidic environment. These precipitated solids slow the
enzymatic digestion of the protein, which, in turn, slows the release
of CGN until further along the GIT. Although the protein is digested
in the GIT, the CGN molecule remains intact, as evidenced by animal
fecal excretion studies (Uno et al., 2001).
The ninety-day rat dietary study by Weiner et al. (2007) pro-
vides a good example of appropriate dietary homogeneity and
stability analyses. First, they prepared a concentrated premix of
CGN by combining the appropriately-weighed amount of CGN test
sample into a tared weighing vessel, and, then, transferring this
amount into a Hobart mixer containing 1 kg of rodent feed (weight/
weight) (Weiner et al., 2007). The formulation was blended for five
minutes. A pre-determined larger quantity of rodent chow was
weighed and placed in a large V-blender. Then, the premix was
added and the formulation was mixed for ten minutes to obtain a
homogeneous batch of treated diet. Control diet was prepared by
the same procedure with the omission of the CGN test sample.
Weiner et al. (2007) measured the stability of the test diets for
eleven days at room temperature. Duplicate diet samples were
collected for both stability and homogeneity for eleven days
following the initial diet preparation. Homogeneity was deter-
mined by withdrawing samples from the bottom, middle and top
layers of the diet batch. The treated diets were within 96.0%e97.9%
of the target concentration for CGN-treated diets (2.5% and 5.0%
CGN concentrations in diet) (Weiner et al., 2007).
Most CGN dietary studies do not administer more than 5% CGN
(Weiner et al., 2007; Weiner, 2014) in agreement with the FDA
guidance (FDA, 2007).
2.2.3. Summary
In summary, studiesinwhichfoodadditives, in general, andCGN, in
particular, are dosed in diet (rodent chow) should include the identity
and purity of the test sample, as well as, verification of the homoge-
neity, stability and concentration in diet in compliance with GLP. Dose
selection should be madewith an understandingof the replacementof
a high percentage of diet with a high Mw, non-nutritive, non-caloric
ingredient, as per regulatory guidance. An understanding of the effects
of food additives on the palatability of treated diet due to changes in
diet taste or texture is important for accurate interpretation of effects
on feed consumption, body weight and body weight gain.
2.3. Drinking water as a vehicle
2.3.1. High molecular weight food additives in general
If water is used as a vehicle for drinking water or oral gavage
studies, it is important to include a description of the water source,
water quality and any constituents, cations or contaminants pre-
sent. Water used as a vehicle in a drinking water study should be
sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination and changed daily.
The concentration, homogeneity and stability of test sample in the
drinking water should be determined prior to use in a study. It is
critically important to measure water consumption frequently, for
example daily or every few days. Some high Mw food additives are
not palatable to the test animals at the doses chosen; therefore, it
may take time for the animals to acclimate to the treated drinking
water. Range-finding studies provide valuable information to un-
derstand the effects of the additive doses on palatability. Food ad-
ditives may be included in water-based gel applications; thus, the

35
 conformation and physical/chemical properties of the food additive
in water, i.e. solubility, should be understood.
2.3.2. Carrageenan as a case study
Drinking water has been used as a vehicle for CGN animal
studies; however, it is the least relevant vehicle for human food
exposure because CGN is not consumed as a food additive in
drinking water. Rather CGN is consumed as a water-gel, for example
in food applications such as dessert gels and low calorie jellies
(Moirano, 1977; Blakemore and Harpell, 2010).
The structural conformation of CGN in water is important to its
effects on the GIT and to interpretation of animal drinking water
studies. Gelation of CGN, present at >0.1%, in water in the absence
of protein, can occur and depends on the type of CGN, cation
content, pH and temperature of the solution (Blakemore and
Harpell, 2010). For example, k-CGN in the presence of 0.5% potas-
sium ions begins gel formation at 0.1% concentration in water;
whereas l-CGN exists in a non-gelling conformation at all con-
centrations, regardless of the presence of all cations (Blakemore
and Harpell, 2010; Blakemore, personal communication, 2015).
The large number and locations of negatively charged sulfate
moieties in the structure of l-CGN does not allow it to form helices
in water. Thus, l-CGN does not gel in water.
CGN in the gel conformation is structurally more stable in water
and less reactive towards the GIT than in the random coil conforma-
tion, which has more charged sulfate groups exposed to the GIT. In the
gel conformation, the charged sulfate groups are an integral compo-
nent of the gel's stable helices and three dimensional gel network, and,
hence, not readily accessible to the GIT tissues, as in the random
conformation (Weiner, 2014; Blakemore and Harpell, 2010). Thus, the
hydrated molecular structure of CGN, whether in an organized helical
conformation or a random coil conformation, canpotentially influence
the toxicity of CGN in a drinking water study, and may change be-
tween these two conformations depending on the dose concentra-
tions used inwater. The same CGN test material, other than l-CGN, can
be in the random conformation at low concentration in water and in
the helical conformation at higher concentrations, which will influ-
ence availability of charged sulfate groups to the GIT. The negatively
charged sulfate groups, thus, can impact the dose response observa-
tions. Table 2 summarizes some of the differentiating features of
kappa (k), iota (i) and lambda (l) CGNs with respect to water solubility
and gelling properties. Note that protein reactivity applies only to
water solutions which contain protein.
Additionally, a good description of the CGN test sample (such as
l, k, i) is necessary to interpret results of studies using water as a
vehicle (Tables 1 and 2).
CGN has been tested in numerous drinking water studies.
However, because more than 99% of the CGN used in non-protein
water-based applications is present in the stable helical confor-
mation (Blakemore, personal communication, 2015), drinking wa-
ter is not considered to be a relevant vehicle to model human
exposure to CGN in non-protein water-based food applications. The
major CGN gel applications use either a CGN gel formed after a
heat/cool cycle (e.g. dessert gels) or hydrated swollen particles (e.g,
deli meat). Only one study (Poulson, 1973) has used CGN in a gel;
however they used CGN jelly mixed with diet and found no dif-
ferences between dry CGN and jellied CGN in diet.
Table 3 below summarizes drinking water studies on CGN,
including the types of CGN, CGN dose concentrations and types of
water. Both the source of the drinking water, as well as, the test sample
identity are critical parameters for proper interpretation of results.
For example, Donnelly et al. (2004) did not specify the source of
the drinking water and used non-food grade l-CGN from Sigma
(Poole, UK) without verification of Mw or purity. The l-CGN test
sample exists in a random conformation in water with many
charged sulfate groups exposed to the GIT and lacks the stability of
the helical conformation. Under these conditions, it is very difficult
to interpret the results of Donnelly et al. (2004), as noted by Weiner
(2014). Weiner (2014) indicates that the sample of l-CGN used in
this study would be expected to have an exceedingly high viscosity
at the high dose (4% in water), it would have likely been a paste-like
material in water, possibly resulting in dehydration in the treated
animals. The lack of purity and characterization of the test sample
lead to questions on the interpretation of this study.
Bhattacharyya et al. (2012) chose distilled deionized water which
provides for a high purity vehicle; however, the purity of the l-k-CGN
sample from Sigma, the ratio of l-CGN:k-CGN, and the Mw were not
characterized. This publication also includes only one, quite low,
concentration of CGN in water (0.001%) in comparison to the other
drinking water studies. Although effects are reported at this single
concentration, no doseeresponse data are provided. When toxic or
other effects are reported, it is important to establish whether the
reported effects show a doseeresponse to determine if they are
treatment-related. Without more information on the test sample and
data on a doseeresponse, it is difficult to interpret the results.
Bhattacharyya et al. (2012, 2015) administered l-k-CGN in water at
only one dose level (0.001%) without stating the type and composi-
tion of the water used as the vehicle and without analyzing the CGN
sample. See Section 1.1 describing a Sigma sample of l-CGN that
contained 36% sugar, a possible confounding factor when studying
glucose
metabolism
in
animals,
an
endpoint
included
in
Bhattacharyya et al. (2012, 2015). Thus, both studies raise questions
regarding interpretation of the results since the samples were not
analyzed; CGN is not absorbed orally, and the authors report systemic
effects on glucose metabolism (see discussion by McKim, 2014).
All of the early studies from the 1970s also employed only one
concentration of CGN in drinking water (Table 3); thus, no dos-
eeresponse data are available to indicate if effects would have been
noted at doses �0.5% to �1.0%. There were no effects noted at the
single dose of 1% CGN in drinking water, but some studies were
focused on possible absorption of CGN. Engster and Abraham
(1976) used food grade CGN administered in distilled water. In
this study, the identity of the sample and quality of the water are
specified, allowing accurate interpretation of this study. Benitz et al.
(1973) used a food grade k-CGN sample, but used tap water as the
vehicle. It would have been helpful if they had included an analysis
of the cation content of the tap water because cation type and
concentration can alter the viscosity and gelling properties of k-
CGN (Blakemore and Harpell, 2010).
2.3.3. Summary
In summary, specification of the identity, purity and form of the
test sample, the quality and content of the water (i.e. cations), and
the sterilization and water replacement procedures, are important
parameters to consider when using water as a vehicle for a high Mw
food additive for clear interpretation of results. Inclusion of several
doses to show effect and “no effect” levels provides more mean-
ingful information on the doseeresponse to a food additive that
may be used in water applications in humans. These parameters are
relevant and important to studies on all food additives. In the case
of CGN, the type of CGN (l, i, k) is important to understand the
hydrated molecular conformation, whether the stable ordered he-
lical conformation or the random coil conformation. Drinking water
is the least relevant vehicle for evaluating human exposure to CGN
because CGN is not consumed as a food additive in drinking water.
2.4. Infant formula as a vehicle
2.4.1. High molecular weight food additives in general
Food additives may be used in infant formula. When conducting
M.L. Weiner / Food and Chemical Toxicology 87 (2016) 31e44
36
 a study on a high Mw food additive in a liquid nutritional supple-
ment or infant formula, it is important to understand the effect of
the additive on viscosity. If the concentration of high Mw food
additive added is too high, the consistency or viscosity of the
treated formulation will be very thick, and, thus, could influence
the consumption and palatability in the study animals. Viscosity is
defined as the resistance of a substance to flow. Animals are sen-
sitive to changes in the viscosity and palatability of their food
(Davidson and Swithers, 2005). Viscosity alone has been shown to
have effects on food consumption in studies using an adult liquid
nutritional supplement fed to adult rats (Davidson and Swithers,
2005). The work of Davidson and Swithers (2005) indicates that
the viscosity of formulations can influence caloric intake and body
weight gain as possible confounding factors due to the effects of the
viscosity of formulations on palatability and growth.
Davidson and Swithers (2005) studied the effects of viscosity of
liquid dietary supplement on short-term caloric compensation and
longer term body weight gain. Groups of adult rats were fed fixed
amounts of liquid nutritional supplements that varied in viscosity
due to the addition of guar gum or methylcellulose, but were
equivalent with respect to nutritive and caloric content. The control
vehicle was 97% Chocolate Ensure Plus® (trademark of Abbott
Laboratories Corporation), an adult nutritional supplement and 3%
water without thickener added (control premeal), having a vis-
cosity of ~56 centipoises (cps) or similar to chocolate milk. A
mixture of 97% Ensure Plus® and 3% guar gum without water (high
viscosity premeal) had a viscosity of ~56,000 cps or similar to
chocolate pudding. An intermediate formulation contained 97%
Ensure Plus®, 0.5% water and 2.5% guar gum or 2.5% methylcellu-
lose (intermediate viscosity premeal) with a viscosity of about
16,700 cps or similar to a chocolate shake. A low viscosity formu-
lation, containing 97% Ensure Plus®, 1.5% water and 1.5% guar gum
(low viscosity premeal), had a viscosity of ~3600 cps. Three groups
of eight animals each received 10 g of the control (56 cps), low
(3600 cps) or intermediate (16,600 cps) viscosity fluids as pre-
meals for one hour, followed an hour later by a 50-g test meal of
rodent chow for two hours. Calories consumed were monitored
after the two-hour exposure to the test meal, shown in Fig. 2 below.
Animals given the lowest viscosity or control premeal, con-
taining 97% Ensure Plus and 3% water without thickening agent,
showed a statistically higher (p < 0.05) caloric intake during con-
sumption of the rodent chow test meal than animals given pre-
meals with higher viscosities: 97% Ensure Plus and 1.5% water and
1.5% thickener, guar gum (~3600 cps) and 97% Ensure Plus and 0.5%
water and 2.5% thickener, guar gum (~16,600 cps) (Fig. 2). These
results indicate that the viscosity of liquid dietary supplements may
influence subsequent caloric intake in rats. Thus, doses of high Mw
food additive of 1.5% or 2.5% in liquid dietary supplement as pre-
meals were sufficient to alter caloric intake subsequently from ro-
dent chow in this study.
In another experiment, rats were assigned to three groups: one
group received a low viscosity supplement of Ensure Plus with 3%
water (viscosity of ~56 cps) (n ¼ 8); a second group received the
same amount of Ensure Plus with 3% guar gum or methylcellulose
(viscosity of 55,600 cps) (n ¼ 7); both these groups received 15 g
supplement/day equivalent to 1.32 kcal/g. A third group (n ¼ 6) was
not given a dietary supplement (Davidson and Swithers, 2005),
and,
thus,
received
fewer
kcal/day:

cups inside the home cage of each rat. Rats not receiving the sup-
plement had an empty cup. All rats received food and water ad
libitum and were weighted daily for the ten weeks of the experi-
ment. Fig. 3 summarizes the body weight of each group. The rats in
the low viscosity group showed a statistically greater body weight
gain than those in the high-viscosity group from week 5 to the end
of the experiment (week 10) (p < 0.05, main effect) and also greater
to a lesser degree than the group that did not receive any

 supplement (significant supplement � weeks interaction, p < 0.05).
There were no statistically significant differences between the rats
given the high viscosity supplement and those given no added
supplement. The authors conclude that the viscosity of liquid diets
influences
the
caloric
intake
(caloric
compensation)
of
subsequently-ingested solid diet. Since the low and high viscosity
supplemented groups had greater starting calories each day, than
the no supplement group, they should have compensated for those
extra calories be consuming less food. However, the low viscosity
group did not compensate for the added calories, compared to
untreated control. Administration of a liquid dietary supplement
can influence an animal's caloric compensation and the liquid's
viscosity is important to the subsequent effects. It would have been
helpful if the authors had measured the food intake of the study
animals.
The authors consider the results to be consistent with the hy-
pothesis that the viscosity of supplements influences the ability to
compensate for the calories that the supplement adds (Davidson
and Swithers, 2005). For liquid calories, there are significant con-
sequences for giving thick versus thin fluid calories. If the additive
influences viscosity, the viscosity can have an impact over the short
term caloric intake, and hence, body weight gain. (Swithers, per-
sonal communication, 2015).
In addition, homogeneity and stability data on a food additive
administered in infant formula or nutritional supplement are
required when studies are conducted according to GLP in a manner
similar to rodent chow as the vehicle (see Section 2.2.1).
2.4.2. Carrageenan as a case study
CGN is approved for use as a stabilizer in human infant formula
(Canadian Gazette, 2004; JECFA, 2015). Studies with CGN have been
published in pre-weaning baboons (McGill et al., 1977) and piglets
(Weiner et al., 2015) using infant formula as the vehicle. Thus, in-
fant formula is a vehicle to consider for food additives to be studied
in neonates and young animals. Homogeneity and stability
methods for CGN in piglet-adapted infant formula have been
developed to analyze infant formula for the concentration of CGN
as per GLP (Blakemore et al., 2014a, b).
When dosing CGN in infant formula, it is important to understand
that CGN binds strongly to proteins, such as casein in milk-based
formulas and soy protein in soy-based formulas. CGN present in in-
fant formula exists in the stabilized gel formation due to its binding
to proteins (CGN-protein interactions) and additional 3-D helices
(CGNeCGN interactions) (Weiner, 2014; Blakemore et al., 2014a).
As mentioned above, viscosity can be a factor which influences
body weight gain when a food additive is dosed to neonates in
infant formula feeding studies. In a ten-day range-finding study in
neonatal G€
ottingen minipigs to select CGN doses for a 28-day study,
three concentrations were used: 0, 300 ppm (0.03%) and 3000 ppm
(0.3%) CGN in piglet-adapted formula (Beck, 2012). The concen-
tration of 3000 ppm CGN in formula was not well received by the
neonatal minipigs. There was a statistically significant reduction of
body weight gain in females at the 3000 ppm dose compared to
controls (0 ppm CGN) during the study. There were no statistically
significant differences in overall body weight gain in high dose
males, compared to control and the lower dose male group (Beck,
2012; summarized by JECFA, 2015). It was concluded that the pig-
lets gained less weight when provided formula with 3000 ppm
CGN, compared to formula with 0 (control) or 300 ppm CGN due to
the possible effect of 3000 ppm CGN on formula viscosity and
palatability. These effects were more apparent in the female piglets
than male piglets. Feed consumption was not measured due to
variable spillages.
It was noted above (Section 2.2.1) that non-nutritive, non-
caloric food additives may cause nutritional deficiencies when
administered at doses >5% in diet (rodent chow) due to replace-
ment of a high percentage of the diet by a non-nutritive, non-
caloric additive. In the case of liquid nutritional supplements, for
example infant formula, much lower concentrations of high Mw
food additives can influence the palatability of the treated liquid
supplement. In the ten-day range-finding study, a high dose of
3000 ppm CGN (0.3%) was sufficient to reduce body weight gain in
female piglets due to possible viscosity changes (Beck, 2012;
summarized by JECFA, 2015).
Determination of the viscosity of the piglet-adapted control and
treated formulas used in the ten day study (Beck, 2012) showed a
linear relationship to log centipoises (cps), as shown in Fig. 4 below.
Values of log cps are equivalent to 7.5 cps for control formula
(0 ppm CGN); 10.3 cps for 300 ppm CGN; 19.5 cps for 1000 ppm
CGN and 74.2 cps for 3000 ppm CGN (data by W.R. Blakemore,
Celtic Colloids, 2011, Personal Communication). Note that the vis-
cosity values in Fig. 4 were determined by a different method than
that used by Davidson and Swithers (2005); therefore, the two sets
of values in different vehicles (piglet-adapted formula and adult
nutritional supplement) are not directly comparable.
The work of Davidson and Swithers (2005) suggests that the use
of a lower rather than a higher viscosity formulation avoids
reduction of body weight gain as a possible confounding factor due
to the effects of high viscosity formulations on palatability and
growth. Therefore, selection of the highest feasible dose of CGN for
the definitive 28-day toxicity study in neonatal pigs (Weiner et al.,
2015) was based on a calculated intermediate viscosity of 38.7 cps
(Blakemore, unpublished data, 2011), found for a CGN concentra-
tion of 2250 ppm, between the 300 ppm and 3000 ppm concen-
trations used in the ten-day range-finding study. The high dose of
2250 ppm in the infant pig study (Weiner et al., 2015) was deter-
mined to be equivalent to the dose in the infant baboon feeding
study (McGill et al., 1977) on a mg/kg/day basis (~430 mg/kg/day)
confirming that both studies tested the highest feasible dose of
CGN, based on viscosity. There were no body weight reductions due
to CGN in neonatal pigs or baboons in either study (Weiner et al.,
2015; McGill et al., 1977).

 2.4.3. Summary
Studies involving the inclusion of a food additive in a liquid
vehicle with nutrients and protein, such as infant or adult nutri-
tional formulations, should carefully evaluate the effect of the ad-
ditive on the viscosity of the mixture. Appropriate vehicle negative
controls with known viscosity should be included. High viscosity
alone due to high concentrations of food additives may reduce
caloric intake and body weight gain in adult rats (methylcellulose
or guar gum) (Davidson and Swithers, 2005) and body weight gain
in neonatal piglets (CGN) (Beck, 2012).
In summary, important parameters to consider in the design of
in vivo studies include the following: sample characteristics (purity,
identity, composition, Mw, unique lot number); physical and
chemical properties and the interaction of the food additive with
the vehicle; homogeneity and stability of the sample in the vehicle;
storage
conditions,
dose
concentrations
and
doseeresponse,
appropriate controls and effects of the sample on diet viscosity and
feed intake.
3. Considerations in the design of in vitro studies
The use of in vitro models is important to international efforts to
Reduce, Refine and Replace animals in research (SOT website,
http://www.toxicology.org/about/history/docs/poster_press/
91x42_AIR_poster_press.pdf#search¼%22replacing
animals
in
studies%22 and https://eurl-ecvam.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). Cell-based
models have been used to minimize use of animals and to help
understand subcellular targets and mechanisms of agents and their
possible adverse effects (McKim, 2014). However, when tumor-
derived cell lines are used to investigate a potential interaction of
a food additive with a receptor or signaling pathway, it is important
to understand how the cell line may differ from normal tissues. In
some instances, it may be better to select an in vitro model that uses
cells isolated from normal tissue in primary culture. For example,
Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) is located on the cell membrane of
several tissues, including liver and intestinal epithelial cells, and is
activated by endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of the
TLR4 signaling pathway induces pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Several different tumor-derived cell lines of intestinal origin (Caco-
2, HT-29, HCT-8) have been used to determine whether CGN can
bind to TLR4 and induce an inflammatory response (Bhattacharyya
et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2005; Borthakur et al., 2012).
However, the expression of TLR4, and, hence the density, of this
receptor on the membrane of these cell lines, is quite different.
Caco-2 cells, for example, have very low TLR4 and, hence, LPS
produces only a small response (Simiantonaki et al., 2007). In
comparison, HT-29 cells, when maintained in the undifferentiated
state, have high expression of TLR4 and response to LPS (Lee et al.,
2005). If the HT-29 cells are cultured 7 days past confluency, they
differentiate and TLR4 expression is reduced (Lee et al., 2005).
Therefore, it is critically important to understand the specific
properties of the cell models used for food additives, their rele-
vance to the whole animal and their potential to predict toxicity in
humans. Use of such models for food additives presents some
important challenges, as described by McKim (2014). Some pa-
rameters to evaluate when conducting new in vitro studies on food
additives include test material identity and purity, constituents of
culture media, doseeresponse data, inclusion of valid negative and
positive control groups, use of cell types with proven integrity and
relevance to human exposure and/or toxicity mechanisms. The
discussion of high Mw food additives, in general, and CGN, in
particular, are included together in the sections below.
3.1. Test material identity and culture medium constituents
As with animal studies, in vitro studies require complete eval-
uation of the identity and purity of the food additive sample (see
Section 1.1). In addition, in vitro research using a food additive re-
quires an understanding of the specific physical and chemical
characteristics of the test material in the cell culture environment
and the selection of control compounds with similar properties (see
McKim et al., 2015; as an example).
Water is the vehicle for in vitro studies; therefore, it is important
to understand the behavior of the food additive in water. For
example, CGN can exist in either the random conformation or a
more stable helical conformation in water, depending on the type
of CGN (i, l, k), ion content, pH and temperature (Blakemore and
Harpell, 2010), as discussed in Section 2.3.2. If no protein is pre-
sent in the cell culture medium, then CGN is likely to exist in the
random
conformation,
rather
than
the
stable
coiled
helical
conformation, depending on the concentration and type of CGN
(Table 2). If protein is present, CGN is strongly bound to the protein,
depending on the concentrations of CGN and protein. Most cell
culture media contain protein in the form of 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS) as a standard practice at a significantly greater con-
centration than the concentration of the CGN test material.
McKim et al. (2015) analyzed the free CGN concentrations in cell
culture medium containing 10% FBS, using a range of added CGN
from 0.1 to 1000 mg/mL CGN. These experiments were done with
the HEK293 culture medium and the culture medium, M3:DC™
(INCELL), required for NCM460 cells, but without cells. Fig. 5B
below from McKim et al. (2015) demonstrates the stoichiometry of
CGN binding to protein in culture medium. Free CGN was not
detected in the culture medium until the added CGN concentration
exceeded 500 mg/mL in the presence of 10% FBS with maximum
amounts of free CGN detected at 1000 mg/mL. In the absence of
protein, free CGN binds toluidine blue and causes a reduction in
absorbance (A).
The concentrations of CGN to which cells in vivo are exposed
would be expected to be extremely low due to its strong binding to
food proteins in the GIT contents. Thus, the interpretation and
extrapolation of in vitro results to the whole animal should consider
the form of the food additive in the experiment, as well as the
constituents of the culture medium, i.e. protein. All constituents of
culture medium should be appropriate to support cell viability,
including antibiotics to minimize bacterial contamination, with
special consideration of the strong binding of CGN with protein in

 3.2. Types of cells used in culture
Exposure to food additives in the human diet occurs by the oral
route. In the case of CGN, there is no significant absorption from the
GIT or systemic exposure following ingestion (Weiner, 2014; Uno
et al., 2001). Thus, design of in vitro experiments using food addi-
tives should consider the cell type, its location in the body and its
relevance to human in vivo exposure. The number of studies on
CGN in vitro are limited and the majority of them come from a
single laboratory at the University of Illinois under Dr. Joann
Tobacman.
For example, Tobacman (1997) and Tobacman and Walters
(2001) evaluated the effects of l-CGN in vitro on breast myoepi-
thelial cells, a cell type which is not exposed to dietary CGN and is,
therefore, not relevant to human dietary exposures. Bhattacharyya
et al. (2012) used HepG2 cells. a human hepatic adenocarcinoma
cell line, which is also not relevant to CGN dietary exposure. McKim
(2014) has thoroughly reviewed many in vitro studies on CGN in
both relevant and non-relevant cell types and discussed concerns
and issues regarding interpretation of the results from these
studies.
The cells of the GIT are appropriate cells for use in in vitro studies
because food additives may be absorbed through the GIT where the
mucosal cells are exposed to the constituents of the diet. Many
in vitro studies on CGN have used the NCM460 cell line, in particular
studies from Tobacman's laboratory. The NCM460 cell line was
derived from normal human colon mucosal epithelium from a 68-
year old Hispanic male and selected for in vitro growth (Moyer et al.,
1996). Initial characterization of the NCM460 cell line indicated
that it had normal growth features and was not tumorigenic
(Moyer et al., 1996; INCELL, 2007). However, as early as 2007,
INCELL, the provider of NCM460 cells, reported that the cell line
displayed an abnormal karyotype and might be tumorigenic
(INCELL, 2007). INCELL (2007) cautioned: “Individual researchers
should assess this information and experimental data for suitability
of use in their individual studies or applications.” INCELL (INCELL,
April, 2015; May 2015) recently sent letters to their customers
providing a cytogenetic analysis of the current NCM460 and
NCM356 cell lines, which show numerous abnormalities. INCELL
indicates that the cytogenetic changes are not due to cross-
contamination with other cells, rather, that the abnormalities
have been selected after culture of the cell lines for over twenty
years. Therefore, INCELL has re-named the cell lines as NCM460D
and NCM356D to distinguish the cytogenetic changes in these two
cell lines from the original cell lines, NCM460 and NCM356. Un-
fortunately, INCELL is not able to define the cell lot that changed the
cytogenetics from normal to altered forms (INCELL Letters to
Customers, April 21, 2015 and May 1, 2015, see Supplemental
Information).
The
information
regarding
the
abnormalities
in
the
NCM460 cells raises a red flag to researchers to understand the cell
types used in their experiments. In the case of CGN research, there
are at least twelve in vitro studies which employed the NCM460 cell
line between 2007 and 2015, as summarized in Table 4 above. All
studies in Table 4 used culture media containing 10% FBS which
binds all of the free CGN at the concentrations used in these studies
(1e10 mg/mL), as shown by the data by McKim et al. (2015) in Fig. 5B
above. In addition, some studies failed to include antibiotics, which
help to avoid bacterial contamination. The presence or absence of
antibiotics should be clearly indicated in the methods for in vitro
publications. Jia and Liu (2007) consider the importance of all
media constituents, controls and test material concentrations in the
design of in vitro studies on drug metabolism. These considerations
also apply to other types of in vitro studies.
Since the NCM460 cells have changed to karyotypes similar to
those observed with tumor-derived cells (INCELL, May, 2015), the
authors’ original interpretation of the studies exposing these cells
to CGN now requires re-evaluation. The importance of this cell
transformation for risk assessment cannot be over-emphasized. In
the future, it is cautioned that scientific peer reviewers scrutinize
submitted manuscripts for clear explanations of the study methods
involved in food additive research in order to avoid repetition of
some of the pitfalls discussed here and in Table 4.
In summary, the design of in vitro studies with food additives
should carefully consider the test sample identification, culture
media, and cell type, so that the results can accurately be used in
human health risk assessment or to elucidate in vivo cellular
mechanisms. Studies conducted on NCM460 cells since 2007
should be re-evaluated to determine if the results are still relevant,
given the
mutations in this
cell line (INCELL, 2007, 2015)
(Supplemental Information).
Table 5 summarizes key parameters to consider in the design of
robust, scientifically sound in vitro studies on food additives, in
general, and CGN, in particular.
4. Conclusions
When designing new in vivo experiments with non-caloric, non-
nutritive food additives, it is critical to consider their physical/
chemical interactions with the dosing vehicle, such as binding to
protein, conformation in drinking water or infant formula. The
general lack of toxicity of such food additives means that the highest
dose should consider the vehicle, liquid or solid, and be limited to
5% in total diet in the case of solid vehicles in order to avoid

Study design parameters to consider in the design of in vitro Studies.a
Parameter
Important considerations
Test Sample
� Characterize sample identity/purity for all studies.
� Analyze the test material concentration in culture medium.
Physical and Chemical
Properties
� Understand the test material properties and account for them in the experimental design for better data analysis and interpretation.
Culture Medium
� Understand the conformation and interaction of the test material with water and media constituents.
� For CGN, conformation depends on the type of CGN, cation content, pH and protein content.
� If protein is present in the media, the CGN will be significantly bound to protein in the test system and will not be available to interact with
the cell membranes of cultured cells.
� In the absence of protein, the CGN concentration will greatly exceed in vivo human exposures and the relevance to humans should be
discussed.
Cell Type
� The cell type chosen should be relevant to the endpoints evaluated in the whole animal in vivo.
� A clear understanding of the objective of the study and the possible relevance and extrapolation to humans are necessary.
� The in vitro system should be a good model for the in vivo effect of interest and should represent the correct target species.
� The known or suspected pathway in vitro should be biologically linked to the in vivo event.
� Selection of cell lines should be made with verification of their derivation and sustainability in research.

 potential confounding effects on animal nutritional status. In
drinking water and infant formula, the form of the food additive in
the vehicle and its possible effects on the viscosity of the vehicle
should be understood before starting a new study, for example, in
piglets 0.3% CGN was sufficient to reduce body weight gain probably
due to the viscosity of the treated formula. Failure to understand
these basic principles has led to much confusion, and sometimes
poor data, including misinterpretation of results in the literature.
The literature on CGN is vast; however, some publications do not
consider the physical and chemical properties of the test sample in
the vehicle or culture medium, the analytical identification of the
test sample and the form(s) of CGN present. These deficiencies have
led to confusion and publication of in vitro and in vivo studies that
may be unreliable and/or misinterpreted, leading to erroneous
conclusions on safety of food additives, such as CGN. Design of new
studies would benefit from consideration of the properties of CGN
and its behavior in various vehicles for the best use of resources and
greatest value for food additive risk assessment.
