BACKGROUND: In COPD, functional status is improved by pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) but
requires specific facilities. Tai Chi, which combines psychological treatment and physical
exercise and requires no special equipment, is widely practiced in China and is becoming
increasingly popular in the rest of the world. We hypothesized that Tai Chi is equivalent (ie,
difference less than �4 St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ] points) to PR.
METHODS: A total of 120 patients (mean FEV1, 1.11 � 0.42 L; 43.6% predicted) bronchodilator-
naive patients were studied. Two weeks after starting indacaterol 150 mg once daily, they
randomly received either standard PR thrice weekly or group Tai Chi five times weekly, for
12 weeks. The primary end point was change in SGRQ prior to and following the exercise
intervention; measurements were also made 12 weeks after the end of the intervention.
RESULTS: The between-group difference for SGRQ at the end of the exercise interventions
was –0.48 (95% CI PR vs Tai Chi, –3.6 to 2.6; P ¼ .76), excluding a difference exceeding the
minimal clinically important difference. Twelve weeks later, the between-group difference for
SGRQ was 4.5 (95% CI, 1.9 to 7.0; P < .001), favoring Tai Chi. Similar trends were observed
for 6-min walk distance; no change in FEV1 was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Tai Chi is equivalent to PR for improving SGRQ in COPD. Twelve weeks after
exercise cessation, a clinically significant difference in SGRQ emerged favoring Tai Chi. Tai
Chi is an appropriate substitute for PR.

 COPD is a progressive lung condition and a common
cause of adult mortality globally.1 In the absence of a
therapy that can reverse parenchymal lung damage,
the most effective treatment for improving quality of
life and exercise performance is pulmonary
rehabilitation (PR).2-5 Although PR is highly effective
in completers, a center/gymnasium-based approach
limits provision, and the benefits wane after course
completion.2
Tai Chi is a Chinese recreational exercise that is
gradually becoming more popular worldwide.6-8 Tai
Chi improves symptoms in several chronic diseases,
including fibromyalgia8 and Parkinson’s disease.7 Pilot
studies have shown that Tai Chi represents a
significant exercise load compared with standard
exercise modalities, suggesting that Tai Chi could, as
with PR, improve physical function and quality of life
in patients with COPD.9,10 However, there has been no
large-scale comparison of Tai Chi with conventional
PR, which precludes an unqualified rollout of Tai Chi
to replace PR. We therefore undertook a comparison of
Tai Chi and PR against a background of standardized
bronchodilator use to test the hypothesis that Tai Chi
and PR were of equivalent benefit in COPD, judged by
using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire
(SGRQ).
Patients and Methods
Overview
The study was undertaken at Xing-Ning People’s Hospital and was
approved by the ethics committee of First Affiliated Hospital of
Guangzhou
Medical
University;
participants
provided
written
informed consent. Patients were recruited from the community
(using advertisements) based on their age, smoking history, and
symptoms
(cough/breathlessness);
patients
were
bronchodilator
naive. Eligible patients were aged between 40 and 80 years with
postbronchodilator FEV1 $ 25% and < 80% of predicted and FEV1/
vital capacity < 0.7.
Measurements were made prior to and following a 2-week run-in period
when indacaterol 150 mg once daily was started (visits 2 and 3).
Patients were randomized at visit 2 to receive 12 weeks of either Tai
Chi or center-based rehabilitation, after which further measurements
(visit 6) were made. Indacaterol was continued for an additional
12 weeks, after which final measurements were made (visit 9).
Intermediate visits were also conducted (e-Fig 1) but are not reported
for clarity.
Intervention
Tai Chi was taught as a 24 form Yang style; instruction was given
5 days per week for 1 h for 12 weeks. Initially, patients were
taught two to three movements each day and typically took
2 weeks to master them; at this point, each instructor supervised
two to three participants. Thereafter, the participants were able to
join larger group training in which a single instructor provided
instructions that were relayed to all group members in the hall by
real-time video streaming. At the end of the 12-week period,
participants were encouraged to continue Tai Chi, either alone or
via a community group; however, no assistance was provided by
the investigators during this period. Inherent to the group nature
of Tai Chi practice, the exercise did not become more strenuous
over
the
training
period
although
participants
became
more
accomplished at performing it. A video of the larger Tai Chi group
undertaking Tai Chi may be viewed online (Videos). This group
also received educational input.
The PR program was based on standard UK practice; at study
initiation, the training used was supervised and checked by an
experienced British physiotherapist (B. M.). Briefly, a 12-week
program with 1-h training session (with warm-up and cool-down
phases as well) thrice weekly was used. Participants undertook a
mixture of approximately 50% resistance exercises (arm and leg
weights
aiming
for
a
target
70%-80%
of
their
one-repetition
maximum), hybrid (rowing machine), and 50% progressive aerobic
whole
body
exercise
(eg,
cycle
or
treadmill)
in
addition
to
educational sessions. For the aerobic exercise, the patient’s level of
dyspnea was recorded after each exercise session and was titrated to
achieve a BORG rating of perceived dyspnea level of 4 to 6. At the
end of the program, participants received verbal encouragement to
remain as physically active as possible. Further details may be found
in e-Appendix 1.
Measurements
The SGRQ, the primary end point, was measured at visits 2, 3, 6, and
9; secondary measures made at the same time points were FEV1
(as % predicted) and 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and the
primary comparison was made between the start and finish of
exercise training (visit 3 to visit 6). SGRQ was administered by
using a Mandarin version of the questionnaire,11 and spirometry
was performed by using a hand-held spirometer (microQuark,
COSMED) in line with American Thoracic Society guidelines. We
also measured the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea
score (mMRC), short physical performance battery score,12 height,
mass (allowing calculation of BMI), fat-free mass by bioimpedance
(BCA-1A,
Member
Enterprise
of
Tongfang
Co,
Ltd),13
and
quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction force in the dominant
leg,14 as well as data concerning hospital admission/ED attendance.
Physical
activity
over
7
days
(ActiGraph)
was
measured
at
screening (visit 1) and, not to overburden patients to finish, at
visit
6
(ie,
starting
11
weeks
after
starting
the
training
intervention) and visit 9 (ie, starting 11 weeks after finishing the
training intervention).
In the absence of pilot data, a formal power calculation was not
possible; however, based on the earlier research of Casaburi et al,15
in which a statistically significant improvement in SGRQ following
tiotropium and PR had been observed, we aimed to recruit sufficient
participants to have 50 “completers” in each group. Projecting an
approximate 20% dropout, 60 patients were specified a priori in each
group.

 Statistical Analysis
All subjects who were randomized to study and received $ 1 dose of
indacaterol were retained in the full analysis set, which was analyzed
by the intention-to-treat method. The number of missing visits (or
incomplete data collection at a visit) was small (e-Table 1). No
attempt was made to impute missing data but rather the last
observation was carried forward. Pre-post comparisons were made
by using Student t tests, having ascertained that the data were
normally distributed, and changes between groups were assessed by
ANOVA (SPSS version 13).
Results
Recruitment and retention data are shown in Figure 1;
demographic data at baseline are presented in Table 1.
Through a protocol violation, one patient (of 120) used
a bronchodilator between consent and visit 1. There
were no statistically significant differences between
groups at baseline. Both groups had high compliance in
terms of attendance rate (present days/total expected
days): 91 � 1% for the Tai Chi group and 87 � 2% for
the PR group.
Comparison of Tai Chi vs PR (Visit 3 vs Visit 6)
Principal outcomes are shown in Table 2 as a function of
treatment allocation; significant improvements were
seen in both groups, with the exception of FEV1.
However, when between-group changes were
considered, we observed no difference in total SGRQ,
spirometry, 6MWD, or mMRC score. The between-
group difference for PR and Tai Chi for SGRQ was –0.48
(95% CI, –3.6 to 2.6; P ¼ .76); for 6MWD, it was 0.78 m
(95% CI, –10.8 to 12.8; P ¼ .89). No differences were
observed for FEV1.
Preservation of Benefit: PR Compared With Tai Chi
(Performance at Visit 9)
At visit 9, compared with visit 6, the Tai Chi group
demonstrated further improvement in SGRQ, mMRC,
and 6MWD; in contrast, the PR group showed no
further improvement in SGRQ or mMRC and exhibited
a small but statistically significant fall in 6MWD
(e-Table 2). The between-group difference between PR

(95% CI, 0.15 to 0.49; P < .001). All favored Tai Chi.
Because mMRC is a categorical variable, we calculated
the proportion in each group; a one-point decrease was
observed between visits 6 and 9 in 20 (33.3%) patients in
the Tai Chi group and in five (8.3%) patients in the PR

 group (c2 test, P ¼ .001). No differences were observed
for FEV1. The overall progression of the main
parameters is shown in Figure 2, and the subanalysis of
different SGRQ domains is shown in e-Table 3. The
overall message conveyed by analysis of visit 9 data was
also confirmed if the point of comparison was the
start of exercise (visit 3) as opposed to the end (visit 6)
(e-Table 4).
Quadriceps Strength
Data regarding quadriceps strength are shown in
Figure 2. No differences were noted between PR and Tai
Chi at the end of the exercise intervention (visit 6).
However, between visits 6 and 9, quadriceps strength
differed between groups, and by visit 9, the group
difference between PR and Tai Chi for quadriceps
maximum voluntary contraction force was –3.3 kg
(95% CI, –5.2 to –1.4; P < .001). Physical activity
showed a slight benefit in favor of Tai Chi, and thus this
group had a significantly higher step count at visit 9
(e-Table 5): 7,907 � 3,568 steps/d for Tai Chi and 6,558
� 3,137 steps/d for PR (P ¼ .03).
Effect of Indacaterol and Adverse Events
The effect of indacaterol is shown in e-Table 6. No
difference in adverse events was observed between the
groups (e-Table 7).
Discussion
With concurrent long-acting inhaled b-agonist use, both
PR and Tai Chi conferred substantial benefits as judged
by using a treatment-specific quality of life measure and
performance on a 6MWD test. Although neither
training approach differed from the other by more than
the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4
SGRQ points, 12 weeks after discontinuation of formal
training, improvements emerged in favor of Tai Chi in
SGRQ score, 6MWD, mMRC dyspnea score, and
quadriceps strength. We concluded that Tai Chi is
equivalent to PR and may confer more sustained
benefit.
Critique of the Method
The choice of SGRQ as the primary outcome measure
requires justification. The efficacy of COPD treatments is
often judged by change in FEV1; however, based on earlier
findings,4 we did not expect either PR or Tai Chi to affect
FEV1. We could have used an exercise outcome measure,
but there would have been a danger that the exercise
modality chosen for evaluation might have favored one or
other intervention through a learning effect. For this

 reason, we did not undertake specific cardiopulmonary
exercise testing because this testing is closer in concept to
formal PR than Tai Chi. Conversely, SGRQ is widely used
as an end point in COPD clinical trials and has recently
been recognized as a valid co-primary end point in
trials of new medicines by the US Food and Drug
Administration (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/
guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/
ucm071575.pdf). The choice of an MCID of 4 represents
an agreed consensus in the COPD field.16 One criticism of
using the SGRQ is that it is susceptible to influence by
other nonexercise-related features such as interaction
with study staff, as well as social and educational
interventions. This concern is further sharpened by the
observation that gains in 6MWD did not reach the MCID
for either intervention. Thus, it is possible that
(considered as a group) these study participants were
not sufficiently disabled to maximally profit from either
PR or TC.
Ideally, the assessment team would have been blinded to
treatment allocation as was done by Holland et al.17
However, in a rural Chinese environment in which, by
definition it was impossible to blind patients and their
caregivers to treatment allocation, we felt that this
approach was not practical. In addition, particularly had
the study been assessor blinded, the visit 3 measures
might have been better made before randomization.
Medicine costs may represent an significant burden for
patients in China, particularly in remote countryside
areas (eg, Xing-Ning), where the monthly family income
is typically 2000 RMB (approximately $250)18; thus,
many patients are bronchodilator naive. Therefore,
given the impressive (at least judged according to
SGRQ) results conferred by both PR and Tai Chi, we
speculate that it would useful to conduct a four-way
study comparing the effects of bronchodilators and Tai
Chi both separately and together; nevertheless, we

 predict that by permitting more intense exercise,
bronchodilators and exercise would be complementary
rather than alternative therapies.
We lacked data to power the study for superiority of Tai
Chi over PR. However, the intention in any case was to
seek evidence of equivalence because a preference for Tai
Chi would then be justified on the grounds of
convenience and probably cost, although we did not
undertake a health economic analysis. We submit that
equivalence was demonstrated by 95% CI showing the
difference in SGRQ between groups lay between 4 and
–4. Furthermore, beyond the cost of initially educating
participants, Tai Chi requires nothing except a small flat
space that may, depending on the weather, be either
indoor or outdoor.
Compared with European patients, the participants were
relatively well functioning (Table 1). Specifically, despite
being, on average, in grade III COPD according to the
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
scoring, their 6MWD exceeded 500 m; in the
multicenter study reported by Waschki et al,19 however,
participants achieved a mean 6MWD of 364 m and an
SGRQ of 54 with a daily step count of 4,725 compared
with an SGRQ of 46 and a step count > 7,000 in this
cohort despite having a similar FEV1. Two possibilities
may explain this discrepancy. First, the patients studied
by Waschki et al19 were mainly those referred for
hospital care (rather than being mainly recruited from
community, as was the case in the present study), and
they therefore may have been self-selected to be more
symptomatic. Second, most patients in the present study
were farmers who have to work to create income because
they generally do not have a pension or other
government benefits. Similar observations were made by
Pitta et al20 comparing Brazilian and Austrian patients
with COPD.
It may be argued that 12 weeks of PR is longer than
usual, at least for the United Kingdom,21,22 although
longer training periods are used in some European
centers.4 We choose to use 12 weeks for two reasons:
first, to ensure that patients would have sufficient time to
learn Tai Chi and second, to guarantee that we had given
an adequate exposure to PR to ensure a fair comparison.
We acknowledge that our protocol required patients to
attend five times weekly for Tai Chi as opposed to thrice
weekly for PR; thus, Tai Chi could be viewed as more
burdensome for the patients in the sense that greater
exposure is required to achieve an equivalent change in
the SGRQ.
Lastly, we acknowledge that Tai Chi can be taught in
different forms and even in the 24 form Yang style it is
possible to have individualized instruction with, for
example, greater focus on lower limb weight-bearing,
either by single-leg maneuvers or by moving one’s
center of gravity lower. In the present trial, after small-
group learning of the maneuvers, patients joined a
larger Tai Chi class; thus, this form of individualized
instruction was not possible (although training
intensity may nevertheless have increased as
participants became more proficient). Conversely,
with PR, the tasks are programmed to become more
demanding as the program proceeds. It is therefore
possible that a personalized Tai Chi program may
have resulted in greater benefits, but the present study
lacks data that could support that speculation.
Nevertheless, this possibility does not detract from our
conclusion that a group Tai Chi program can provide
equivalent benefit to a conventional Western PR
program.
Significance of the Findings
The significance of our findings depends on the MCID
of the parameters measured. The primary end point was
SGRQ, and MCID for this measure is conventionally
considered to be 4 points.16 For 6MWD, a range of
MCID have been reported between 25 and 54 m,23,24
with recent larger data sets favoring the smaller
number.25 We are not aware of published MCIDs for
mMRC dyspnea score or quadriceps strength.
Previous studies of Tai Chi in COPD, and other chronic
conditions prevalent in the elderly, when considered
together6 reportedly show improvements both in
walking distance and, again consistent with our data,
knee extensor strength. Because we did not seek to tailor
our Tai Chi program specifically for patients with
respiratory disability, it is conceptually possible that
classes as described here could simultaneously treat both
patients with COPD and those with other conditions.
Our aim was to show equivalence of PR and Tai Chi at
the end of the exercise intervention, and we achieved
this goal because the mean difference in change in total
SGRQ between treatment allocation was 0.48 point
(P ¼ NS) and, importantly, the 95% CI was within the
MCID of �4 points. Reassuringly, because PR is known
to increase 6MWD, the difference in change in 6MWD
conferred by the two exercise interventions was also
both statistically nonsignificant and, in addition, had CIs
that also excluded a clinically important difference. This
1122

 finding should encourage the use of Tai Chi as a
substitute for PR because it suggests the effect of Tai Chi
may confer, through mechanisms currently unknown,
benefits that are not exclusively physical. We note that
Tai Chi is not the only low-cost intervention that could
substitute for PR, although it is one that is familiar to the
Chinese population. In a meta-analysis, Alison and
McKeough26 highlighted other potentially beneficial
approaches (walking, stepping, and the sit-to-stand
maneuver).
The period after the exercise intervention proved
illuminating, as a statistically significant between-group
difference emerged for SGRQ with a magnitude (4.5
points) that exceeded the MCID; the 95% CI
encompassed magnitudes of difference that, although
remaining statistically significant, did not exceed the
MCID, however. Consistent with this finding,
statistically but not clinically significant differences in
favor of the Tai Chi group were observed for exercise
performance (6MWD), dyspnea, and quadriceps
strength. We speculate that improved quadriceps
function is the reason for improvement in the other
parameters for the following reasons. First, it is entirely
plausible that Tai Chi, which involves periods
supporting oneself with one leg, acts as an (anabolic)
training stimulus; consistent with this theory, we
previously showed that Tai Chi, but not treadmill
exercise, induces quadriceps fatigue,9 and quadriceps
fatigue is known to predict a positive response to
strength training.27,28 Second, we have previously shown
that classic PR produces an increase in quadriceps
strength that is related to the magnitude of improvement
in exercise performance.29 Third, quadriceps weakness is
associated with dyspnea in a general adult population30
and specifically with impaired physical function in
COPD.12 The improvement in quadriceps function may
have occurred during the formal training period.
However, it is also likely that the Tai Chi group
continued to some extent to practice after the end of the
training period, which would have been more difficult
for the PR group who lacked access to gymnasium
equipment. It is conceded, however, that we could have
offered the PR group more vigorous and practical advice
as to how they could retain the benefits conferred by PR
without having to use specialist exercise equipment.
The study population was unusual in that they were
bronchodilator naive. In some cases, this situation
occurred because they had not yet received a diagnosis
of COPD; it is also possible that access to
bronchodilators was limited in some cases by finance.
This problem is also recognized globally,31 and we
speculate that Tai Chi may have potential as a low-cost
initial therapy in COPD.
Conclusions
Judged by using the primary end point of SGRQ, these
data exclude a clinically meaningful difference at
12 weeks between classic PR and Tai Chi. Twelve weeks
after the end of the intervention, a significant difference
in SGRQ was observed favoring the Tai Chi group; this
observation, supported also by improvements in
dyspnea and exercise performance, suggests that Tai Chi
could be substituted for PR in the treatment of COPD
with greater convenience for patients.
