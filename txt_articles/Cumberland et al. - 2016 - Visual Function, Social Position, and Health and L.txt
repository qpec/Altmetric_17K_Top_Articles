Visual Function, Social Position, and Health and Life Chances
The UK Biobank Study
Phillippa M. Cumberland, MSc; Jugnoo S. Rahi, PhD, FRCOphth; for the UK Biobank Eye and Vision Consortium
IMPORTANCE The adverse impact of visual impairment and blindness and correlations with
socioeconomic position are known. Understanding of the effect of the substantially more
common near-normal vision (mild impairment) and associations with social position as well as
health and life chances is limited.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of visual health (across the full acuity spectrum)
with social determinants of general health and the association between visual health and
health and social outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional epidemiologic study was conducted
using UK Biobank data from 6 regional centers in England and Wales. A total of 112 314
volunteers (aged 40-73 years) were assessed in June 2009 and July 2010. Data analysis was
performed from May 20, 2013, to November 19, 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Habitual (correction if prescribed) distance visual acuity
was used to assign participants to 1 of 8 categories from bilateral normal visual acuity
(logMAR, 0.2 or better; Snellen equivalent, 6/9.5 or better) to visual impairment or blindness
(logMAR, 0.5 or worse; Snellen equivalent, 6/19 or worse) using World Health Organization
and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth
Revision taxonomy. Relationships between vision, key social determinants and health and
social outcomes (including the main factors that define an individual’
s life—the social,
economic, educational, and employment opportunities and outcomes experienced by
individuals during their life course) were examined using multivariable regression.
RESULTS Of the of 112 314 participants, 61 169 were female (54.5%); mean (SD) age was
56.8 (8.1) years. A total of 759 (0.7%) of the participants had visual impairment or blindness,
and an additional 25 678 (22.9%) had reduced vision in 1 or both eyes. Key markers of social
position were independently associated with vision in a gradient across acuity categories; in
a gradient of increasing severity, all-cause impaired visual function was associated with
adverse social outcomes and impaired general and mental health. These factors, including
having no educational qualifications (risk ratio [RR], 1.86 [95% CI, 1.69-2.04]), having a
higher deprivation score (RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.07-1.09]), and being in a minority ethnic group
(eg, Asian) (RR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.83-2.30]), were independently associated with being in the
midrange vision category (at legal threshold for driving). This level of vision was associated
with an increased risk of being unemployed (RR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.31-1.84]), having a
lower-status job (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.09-1.41]), living alone (RR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.10-1.39]),
and having mental health problems (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04-1.20]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Impaired vision in adults is common, and even near-normal
vision, potentially unrecognized without assessment, has a tangible influence on quality of
life. Because inequalities in visual health by social position mirror other health domains,
inclusion of vision in generic initiatives addressing health inequalities could address the
existing significant burden of underrecognized and/or latent visual disability. Longitudinal
investigations are needed to elucidate pathophysiologic pathways and target modifiable
mechanisms.

Hence,evidencenecessaryforpolicyandserviceplanningabout

One obstacle to such research has been the unavailability
of population samples of sufficient size and detail to enable ro-
bust interrogation of the full spectrum of visual function. We

the largest prospective investigation of lifestyle and environ-
mental determinants of health and disease. We hypothesized
that key social determinants of health are associated with vi-
sual health and that visual health is associated with key gen-
eral health and social outcomes. We further hypothesized that
meaningful gradients of inequality exist in these associations.
Methods
Between February 2006 and July 2010, UK Biobank assessed
502 682 persons aged 40 to 73 years (identified from the elec-
toral register) following individual written informed consent
for participation; there was no financial compensation.14 Di-
verse detailed data were collected through physical assess-
ments, biological samples, and self-report on health and dis-
ease, including eyes and vision, using validated instruments.
In2009,anophthalmicassessmentwasaddedtothemainpro-
tocol and undertaken by 117 907 participants (23.5%) at 5 re-
cruitment centers in England and 1 in Wales. This assessment
comprised habitual distance visual acuity, refraction without
cycloplegia (Tomey RC-5000 auto refkeratometer; Tomey
Corporation), intraocular pressure measurement, fundus pho-
tography, and optical coherence tomography. The present
study was conducted from June 2009 to July 2010.
UK Biobank has received approval from the North West
Multi-Centre Research Ethics committee, which covers the
United Kingdom. UK Biobank also obtained approval in
England and Wales from the Patient Information Advisory
Group for gaining access to information that would allow it to
invite people to participate. The Patient Information Advi-
sory Group has since been replaced by the National Informa-
tion Governance Board for Health & Social Care. In Scotland,
UK Biobank has received approval from the Community
Health Index Advisory Group. The present study was ap-
proved by the National Information Governance Board for
Health & Social Care, which allows access to information for
inviting individuals to participate.

Key Points
Question How is visual function across the full acuity spectrum
ranging from near-normal vision to blindness associated with
social position and health and social outcomes?
Findings In this study of a large national sample of UK adults with
abnormal vision in 1 or both eyes, key indicators of social position
were independently associated with abnormal vision across the
full acuity spectrum, and impaired visual health was independently
associated with adverse health and social outcomes in a gradient
starting from near-normal vision.
Meaning The findings of this study indicate a significant burden of
underrecognized and/or latent visual disability that might be
addressed by including visual health within initiatives addressing
general health inequalities.

(SEQ) quantifies the refractive status of an eye in a single scale
(algebraic sum in diopters [D], sphere +0.5 cylinder, and re-
fraction measures). Using the mean SEQ of the 2 eyes, we cat-
egorized individuals as having emmetropia (SEQ, −0.99 to
+0.99 D), myopia (SEQ, −1.0 D or less), or hypermetropia (SEQ,
+1.0 D or more). The available demographic, socioeconomic,
and health data and derived variables are reported in Table 2.
Eligibility and exclusion criteria applied to achieve the
sample for analysis (eFigure 1 in the Supplement) included cat-
egorization or exclusion of individuals unable or unwilling to
undergo acuity assessment, those ineligible for clinical rea-
sons as prespecified in the UK Biobank protocol (https:
//biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=100250),andthose
lacking sufficient data on acuity for both eyes to allow
categorization of visual status (eg, did not complete the test
or tested in only 1 eye).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analysis of the distribution of visual function was
based on all participants. Associations between visual func-
tion and sociodemographic factors were analyzed using the
data set complete for visual function, demographic, socioeco-
nomic, and health variables. Because of the small numbers
within the groups (Table 1), the World Health Organization
categories of VI (n = 727), SVI (n = 26), and blind (n = 6) (ie,
logMAR 0.5 or worse; Snellen equivalent 6/19 or worse in the
better-seeing eye) were combined.
Toinvestigatetheassociationofsocialdeterminantsofgen-
eral health with vision health (across the full acuity spec-
trum), multinomial analyses were undertaken with adjust-
ment for confounders and comparison of each visual function
category with the results of persons with bilateral normal vi-
sion. Robust SEs were used to account for clustering of indi-
viduals within test center.
Multivariable logistic and ordinal regression were used, as
appropriate, to investigate associations between visual func-
tion and health and life chances (the social, economic, edu-
cational, and employment opportunities and outcomes expe-
rienced by individuals during their life course). Because the
temporal relationship between impaired visual function, edu-
cation, and social position is difficult to disentangle using the
cross-sectional data available in UK Biobank, we undertook an
additional subgroup analysis restricted to participants with
higher educational attainment to investigate associations be-
tween visual function and social outcomes. Analyses were car-
ried out using Stata, version 13 (StataCorp LP). Data analysis
was performed from May 20, 2013, to November 19, 2014.
Results
Participation and Final Analysis Sample
A total of 112 314 individuals (95.3% of 117 907 with acuity mea-
surement) could be reliably assigned to a visual function cat-
egory (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Of these, 61 169 partici-
pants (54.5%) were female, mean (SD) age was 56.8 (8.1) years,

for visual acuity categorization for 3523 participants who had
1 eye tested. A total of 759 participants (0.7%) had visual im-
pairment or blindness, and an additional 25 678 individuals
(22.9%) had reduced vision in 1 or both eyes. Of 248 partici-
pants who self-reported VI in the untested eye, 195 people

6/12). These individuals were more likely to be male and
of poorer social position than were those included in the
analysis sample. Based on UK Census 2011 data (https://www
.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011), although the ethnic
composition of UK Biobank is comparable to that of the general
UK population, the analysis sample was older (participation
increased with age), had fewer men, was more affluent, and
had higher levels of education. Thus, the distribution of visual
function (Table 1) cannot be extrapolated as precise population
prevalence estimates. The distribution of all demographic,
socioeconomic, and health variables by visual function
category is presented in eTable 2 in the Supplement.
Sociodemographic Factors Associated With Visual Function
As reported in Table 3, VI across the acuity spectrum was con-
sistently and independently associated with increasing age, fe-
malesex,andaworsedeprivationscore.TheriskofVIrosewith
decreasing levels of educational qualification. Individuals in
any black or minority ethnic group were more likely to have
impaired visual function compared with white persons. Gra-
dients were observed in these associations with social deter-
minants of health within each visual function category. Com-
parison of these associations across visual function categories
showed some gradient effects. For example, the increased risk
of VI for persons without educational qualifications ranged
from 1.29 (95% CI, 1.25-1.33) for unilateral near-normal vi-
sion to 1.99 (95% CI, 1.33-2.96) for bilateral SVI or blindness.
Refractive Error, Optical Correction, and Visual Function
Overall, 99 070 of 111 863 participants (88.6%) reported wear-
ing eyeglasses or contact lenses for correction of distance, near
vision, or both forms of VI. Of participants with no optical cor-
rection, 12 570 of 12 793 individuals (98.3%) had autorefrac-
tion, which suggested that fewer than 11% of the sample had
anuncorrectedrefractiveerror(ie,1.2%ofallparticipants).Spe-
cifically, 749 people (6.0%) had myopia (mean SEQ, lower than
−1 D) and 595 individuals (4.7%) had hypermetropia (mean
SEQ, higher than +1 D). Having a refractive error but no opti-
cal correction was associated independently with younger age,
male sex, increasing deprivation, and nonwhite ethnicity.

Impaired Visual Function, Education, and Social Position
In the subgroup analysis restricted to individuals with higher
educational qualifications, impaired visual function was as-
sociated independently with an increased risk of being un-
able to work, unemployed, and in a lower occupational cat-
egory as well as having a lower household income (eTable 3
in the Supplement). Gradients in effect sizes across the acu-
ity spectrum were observed but less consistently than in the
full group analyses reported above.
Visual Function and Health Outcomes
IntheadjustedmodelpresentedinTable5,impairedvisualfunc-
tion was associated with poorer self-reported general health.
Those in the VI/SVI/blind category were 44% more likely than
were those with normal vision to self-report poorer health and
were also more likely to have ever visited a general practitioner
orpsychiatristforcommonmentalhealthconditions;individu-
alswithsociallysignificantVIweremorelikelytohavevisiteda
psychiatrist.
Of 109 172 participants with information on governmental
financial assistance, 4537 persons (4.2%) were receiving assis-
tanceasadisabilityorattendanceallowance.ThoseintheVI/SVI/
blind category were more than 4 times more likely to be receiv-
ingthisassistancethanwerethosewithnormalvision,withagra-
dient of association with all levels of impaired function. These
associations are likely to reflect impaired visual function in as-
sociation with other disabling disorders since they remained
statistically significant after adjusting for income.
Discussion
We report a novel, large-scale investigation of the relationship
between social position and visual health (ie, full continuum of
visual function) as well as the association between visual func-
tion and key general health and socioeconomic outcomes in a
contemporary adult population in the United Kingdom. Of the
population analyzed, 23.0% had real-life impaired visual func-
tion.Wedemonstratethatvisualhealthisassociatedwithknown
keysocialdeterminantsofhealth10,11actingindependentlyinthe
axesofsocialdifferentiationcapturedbyage,sex,ethnicity,area
or community-based deprivation, and educational experience
and with a trend across the full spectrum of visual acuity. All-
causeimpairedvisualfunction,afunctionaloutcomeofdiverse
processes analogous to all-cause mortality, was independently
associated with adverse outcomes relating to employment,
occupation, economic status, and self-reported general and
mental health, with a gradient of increasing severity from the
mildest impairment affecting only 1 eye to bilateral blindness.
Althoughitisauniquebioresource,14UKBiobankstudyhas
limitations. Because it is not a random subsample of the UK
population, frequency and distribution cannot be interpreted
asprevalence.ThefrequencyofVIandblindnesswaslowerthan
what might have been anticipated,9,17,21-24 reflecting nonran-
dom recruitment, exclusion by protocol of some participants,
and exclusion of other individuals without visual acuity data
for both eyes that are necessary for categorization of visual sta-
tus. Thus, we report indicative minimum estimates of fre-
quency. The limited number of participants in the worst cat-
egories of VI/SVI/ blindness precluded conclusive analysis of
differences between these groups. Nevertheless, the very large
size as well as diversity and number of details of the study
sample, combined with the low levels of missing data, allowed
robust investigation. Although the cross-sectional design pre-
cludes elucidation of temporal relationships (eg, between vi-
sualfunctionandeducation,employment,andoccupationalcat-
egories), which is necessary to confirm causality, the findings
nevertheless serve to identify the existence of patterns of in-
equality and delineate new hypotheses for testing in longitu-
dinal research to identify pathways of action.25
The epidemiologic literature22,26-28 on visual function in
adultshasunderstandablyprincipallyaddressedtheworstend
of the spectrum (ie, low vision and blindness), which is known
to be associated with belonging to an ethnic minority and hav-
ing lower socioeconomic status. Longitudinal research on the
1958 British birth cohort by our group17,24 provided the con-
ceptualbasisforthepresentstudythathasexploitedthegreater
scale and diversity of UK Biobank, albeit using cross-
sectional data, to identify and understand current patterns of
social inequalities in visual health across the spectrum from

In addition, we have demonstrated dose-response–type gradi-
entsstartingwithmildlyreducedvisualfunction,withanylevel

advantage than any level of unilateral impairment. Although
there appear to be no studies directly comparable to ours, the
broader literature10,11,13 on social determinants and health in-
equalities supports our hypothesis that such associations are
likely to exist worldwide, although the scale will vary.

There is increasing worldwide attention to refractive
error as a readily remediable cause of impaired vision when
undetected or uncorrected due to limited access to or use of
services or affordability of eyeglasses.36,37 Because uncor-
rected refractive error was present in only 1.2% of the par-
ticipants in our study, it is not a major contributor to the
findings but illustrates the complexities and challenges of
condition-specific approaches. There is limited and incon-
sistent literature38 indicating that differential uptake of free
sight tests or free eyeglasses can paradoxically widen rather
than eliminate inequality gradients.39 In developing new
strategies, it will be important to remember that the deter-
minants of visual health may differ from the determinants
of inequalities in visual health and that these factors may
work in opposing directions.
Conclusions
We propose that the conceptual framework for thinking about
vision that focuses on impairment rather than health, together
with extant gaps in knowledge, are hindering the develop-
ment and application of proportionate universalism11 (ie, evi-
dence-based policies and interventions) to achieve higher lev-
els of visual health and improve life chances of the whole
population while simultaneously reducing the magnitude and
gradient of inequalities. Evidence from other clinical disci-
plines supports the potential gain, with relatively little addi-
tional effort, that may be achieved with routine inclusion of vi-
sualfunctioninindividualhealthassessmentsofpatientsatrisk
for visual impairment and from routine inclusion of vision and
eye health in its broadest sense in existing national and inter-
nationalinitiativesaddressingsocialdeterminantsofdiseaseand
tacklinghealthinequalities.11,13Longitudinalresearchdelineat-
ingmechanismsandpathways,includingconsiderationofboth
specific eye diseases and visual neurodevelopment and cogni-
tion, is needed to develop new targeted strategies.
