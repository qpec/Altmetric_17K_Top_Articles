Suicide in prisons: an international study of prevalence and 
contributory factors
Seena Fazel, Taanvi Ramesh, Keith Hawton
Summary
Background Prison suicide rates, rate ratios, and associations with prison-related factors need clarification and 
updating. We examined prison suicide rates in countries where reliable information was available, associations with 
a range of prison-service and health-service related factors, how these rates compared with the general population, 
and changes over the past decade. 
Methods We collected data for prison suicides in 24 high-income countries in Europe, Australasia, and North America 
from their prison administrations for 2011–14 to calculate suicide rates and rate ratios compared with the general 
population. We used meta-regression to test associations with general population suicide rates, incarceration rates, 
and prison-related factors (overcrowding, ratio of prisoners to prison officers or health-care staff or education staff, 
daily spend, turnover, and imprisonment duration). We also examined temporal trends.
Findings 3906 prison suicides occurred during 2011–14 in the 24 high-income countries we studied. Where there 
was breakdown by sex (n=2810), 2607 (93%) were in men and 203 (7%) were in women. Nordic countries had the 
highest prison suicide rates of more than 100 suicides per 100 000 prisoners apart from Denmark (where it was 91 
per 100 000), followed by western Europe where prison suicide rates in France and Belgium were more than 100 per 
100 000 prisoners. Australasian and North American countries had rates ranging from 23 to 67 suicides per 
100 000 prisoners. Rate ratios, or rates compared with those in the general population of the same sex and similar 
age, were typically higher than 3 in men and 9 in women. Higher incarceration rates were associated with lower 
prison suicide rates (b = –0·504, p = 0·014), which was attenuated when adjusting for prison-level variables. There 
were no associations between rates of prison suicide and general population suicide, any other tested prison-related 
factors, or differing criteria for defining suicide deaths. Changes in prison suicide rates over the past decade vary 
widely between countries.
Interpretation Many countries in northern and western Europe have prison suicide rates of more than 100 per 
100 000 prisoners per year. Individual-level information about prisoner health is required to understand the substantial 
variations reported and changes over time.

Introduction
Prison suicide is an international problem, and rates of 
suicide in prisoners are higher than in general 
populations.1–3 In England and Wales, a five to six times 
excess of suicides in male prisoners compared with the 
general population has been reported;1,4 whereas, in female 
prisoners, rate ratios are 20 times higher than in the general 
population.1,5 In some countries, these rates have been 
increasing. For example, in 2016, the rate of prison suicides 
in England and Wales reached its highest level since 1999. 
Research on rates and rate ratios of suicide in prisons 
needs updating, as it is not known whether rate ratios are 
also rising and whether any changes are associated with 
prison-related factors. A clearer understanding of factors 
explaining the elevated risks can assist in suicide prevention 
initiatives; many countries already include specific prisoner 
suicide prevention in national strategies.
Individual-level characteristics associated with prison 
suicide suggest that psychiatric illness, substance 
misuse, and repetitive self-harm are known important 
risk factors for suicide.6,7 However, less is known about 
prison and health service-level factors, which might be 
subject to public health and policy change. A recent 
concern has been the problem of prison overcrowding, 
with 119 of 205 countries currently reported to be 
exceeding their official prison capacity,8 but findings of 
an association with prison suicide are inconsistent. A 
number of studies have found a positive correlation 
between overcrowding and prison suicide,9–12 but others 
have found the opposite,13 14 possibly due to a protective 
effect of the double occupation of cells designed for 
single use. Low staff engagement, negative staff–
prisoner relationships, and high prison population 
turnover rates are also potential explanations, but 
evidence is limited.15–17
In this study, we have investigated prison suicide 
between 2011 and 2014 in 24 high-income countries 
across three continents, and examined suicide rates, rate

ratios compared with the general population, and 
associations with a range of prison-level and ecological 
factors. Additionally, we have examined trends in prison 
suicide rates over the period of 2003–14.
Methods
Study design and data sources
24 countries (table 1) were chosen based on the availability 
of data from reliable recording methods. Information 
about all self-inflicted deaths during 2011–14 inclusive 
was collected from the 24 countries from publicly 
available statistics on government or prison service 
websites (using a Google search, including the name of 
the country and a combination of terms including 
“prison”, “justice”, “custody”, “suicide”, “self-inflicted”, 
“death”, and “mortality”). We also contacted prison 
service research departments and collected information 
from the Council of Europe Annual Penal Statistics 
SPACE I publication,18 which collects statistics from 
governmental bodies regarding imprisonment and penal 
institutions in Council of Europe member states. Details 
of data sources for each country are reported in the 
appendix (pp 6–8).
Countries varied in their definitions of deaths classified 
as suicide in custody; some classified suicides as any 
death resulting from self-inflicted injury, regardless of 
intention (which resulted in fewer deaths being classified 
as “undetermined”), while other countries based their 
decision on proving intent. 18 countries included deaths 
that occurred in the prison hospital or in community 
hospitals (where a prisoner was moved), and nine 
countries included suicides that occurred during 
permitted leave (table 1). However, when rates were 
pooled for countries with particular defining criteria 
for prison suicide, there was no difference in rates 
(appendix p 11).
Information about age-adjusted rates of suicides 
(ICD-10 codes X60–X64) per 100 000 in the general adult 
population aged 30–49 years for the year 2012 was 
obtained for the majority of countries from the WHO 
Preventing Suicide: A Global Imperative report.19 For 
England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, this 
information was collected from government websites.
Prison and health-service related factors
Based on previous research, we tested a number of 
ecological prison variables that have been proposed as 
suicide risk factors,9–12,15–17,20,21 for associations with prison 
suicide rates. These variables were incarceration rates, 
which were calculated per 100 000 people in the general 
adult population; rates of overcrowding, which were 
calculated using prison population figures and prison 
capacity figures for each of the four years; ratios of 
prisoners to prison staff (which were separated into 
officers, health-care staff, and education staff); prison 
population turnover ratios, which were calculated as: 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed from Jan 1, 2007, to June 31, 2017, using 
the search terms (prison* OR jail* OR incarcerat*) AND 
(suicid* OR self harm* OR self-harm*) AND (prevalen* OR 
inciden* OR rate* OR frequen*), with no language 
restrictions. We found one international study and four 
national studies (France, Germany, UK, and USA) that 
reported rates of prison suicides, as well as two investigations 
of the association between ecological factors and prison 
suicide rates. The international study provided information 
about prison suicide rates in 12 countries from 2003–07 and 
showed an elevated risk of suicide for prisoners compared 
with the general population, with a higher proportionate 
excess in women. No associations were found between rates 
of prison suicide and general population suicide rates or 
incarceration rates. The four national studies confirmed 
elevated rate ratios. The two reports examining ecological 
prison factors presented contrasting findings on the prison 
environment. We identified no international studies of prison 
suicide rates that also investigated associations with 
environmental prison factors.
Added value of this study
In this study, using data for 3906 prison suicides from 
24 high-income countries, we found an elevated risk of 
suicide among prisoners compared with the general 
population in all countries with more than five suicide events 
in prisons; in men, this risk was at least two-fold and in 
women it was at least four-fold. We found a significant 
association between rate of prison suicide and rate of 
incarceration (b=–0.504, p=0·014); however, this effect was 
attenuated when other ecological factors (general population 
suicide rates, overcrowding, and average daily spend per 
prisoner) were adjusted for. Additionally, rates of prison 
suicides have changed over the past decade in countries for 
which data were available, with a decrease in Scotland.
Implications of all the available evidence
The lack of any strong associations between prison-level factors 
and prison suicide rates suggest that individual-level factors or 
interactions between them and the prison environment might 
provide more explanation than solely focusing on prison-level 
factors for the large variations in prison suicide rates in different 
countries. Reporting standards for prison suicide need 
improvement so that more granular data for possible risk 
factors can be examined.

mean cost per prisoner per day (converted into Euros); 
rates of forensic psychiatric inpatient beds per 100 000 
general population22 (available for five countries for 
2011–12); the management of prison health care (public 
health-care system vs national justice system);23 and 
mean length of imprisonment (in months). Information 
about these prison variables was not available for all 
4 years for all countries, so means were taken for available 
years.
We also collected data for prison suicides from 2003 to 
2010, using the same methods as this study, to examine 
whether there had been changes in rates of suicide over 
time for the 12 countries where data were available.
Statistical analysis
We used the number of suicide deaths and annual prison 
populations to calculate annual rates of suicide per 
100 000 prisoners for each year from 2011–14, typically 
based on a mid-year census date. We only included 
countries with five or more suicide events in prisons 
because a smaller number of suicide events would not 
have allowed us to calculate rate ratios accurately. 
Australia, Canada, Northern Ireland, and Poland did not 
have data for prison suicides available for 2014, so 
averages were taken for 2011–13. The sex breakdown of 
deaths was not available in four countries: Australia, 
Canada, Poland, and Switzerland. To account for the size 
of each country’s population, we conducted meta-
regression analyses comparing rates of prison suicide in 
men, women, and both sexes combined, with each of the 
factors described above. We then did a multivariable 
meta-regression 
analysis 
to 
investigate 
whether 
correlations retained statistical significance when 
adjusting for other factors. These factors were those that 
had been found to be associated with prison suicide rates 
in previous research and those that we found to correlate 
most highly with prison suicide rate. We also calculated 
Pearson’s correlations between prison suicide rates and 
all other variables to support findings from the meta-
regression analyses. We did not do analyses for countries 
with fewer than five suicides over the 4 year period, 
because statistical power was too low. We excluded the 
USA in one analysis (for incarceration rates) because it 
was an outlier, with an incarceration rate of more than 
eight times higher than the majority of other countries.
We also completed a number of sub-analyses. First, we 
did linear regression analyses to investigate temporal 
trends of prison suicide rates for the years 2003–14. 
Second, we compared mean prison suicide rates for 
2003–07 and 2011–14 for men and women separately. 
Third, we calculated rates of prison suicides using an 
alternative denominator that accounted for throughput. 
This approach assumed the number of receptions of pre-
sentenced or remand prisoners was a more appropriate 
denominator to determine rates7 rather than a mid-year 
census. It was calculated as follows: 
Fourth, we investigated whether varying definitions of 
prison suicide influenced rates of prison suicide by 
calculating pooled estimates of prison suicide rates 
stratified by categories of definitions. Fifth, we calculated 
pooled estimates of prison suicide rates and rate ratios 
on the basis of length of imprisonment. Finally, we 
compared prison suicide rates between the three primary 
types of correctional institution in the USA: local jails, 
state prisons, and federal prisons.

Results
3906 prison suicides occurred between 2011 and 2014 in 
24 countries (table 2). Information about sex was 
available for 2810 (72%) prison suicides, with 2607 (93%) 
suicides in men and 203 (7%) suicides in women.
Rates of prison suicide varied considerably (table 2), 
ranging from 23 per 100 000 prisoners in the USA, to 
180 per 100 000 prisoners in Norway. Six countries with 
more than five suicide events had rates greater than 100 
per 100 000 prisoners: Norway, France, Belgium, 
Portugal, Sweden, and Finland. In men, suicide rates 
ranged from 43 per 100 000 prisoners in local US jails to 
183 per 100 000 prisoners in Norway (appendix p 3). In 
women, rates varied from 30 per 100 000 prisoners in 
local US jails to 363 per 100 000 prisoners in France 
(appendix p 4). Suicide rates were not typically higher in 
female prisoners than in male prisoners.
Comparing rates of prison suicide with general 
population rates, rate ratios for both sexes combined 
ranged from 1 in Poland to 14 in Norway (table 2). Rate 
ratios for men ranged from 2 in local US jails, to 10 in 
Norway (figure 1), excluding the USA, which is an 
outlier. Rate ratios for women were generally higher, 
ranging between 4 in local US jails and 41 in France 
(figure 1). French prison suicide figures include prisoners 
who have died in community settings, including hospital 
and permitted leave. However, when these numbers are 
excluded, the French rate remains the second highest 
(at 156 per 100 000 prisoners). 
Meta-regression indicated a significant association 
between rates of incarceration and prison suicide rates 
when both sexes were combined (b=–0·504, p=0·014, 
n=20; figure 2). When the USA was included in the 
analysis, the effect was attenuated (b=–0·103, p=0·056, 
n=21; appendix p 5). When prison suicide rates were 
meta-regressed on incarceration rates and other factors 
were adjusted for (general population suicide rate, rate of 
overcrowding, and mean daily spend per prisoner), 
incarceration rates were not significantly associated with 
prison suicide rates (b=–0·343, p=0·20, n=19).
There were no significant associations between any 
other prison-related variable and rates of prison suicide 
when both sexes were combined (table 3), nor when men 
and women were analysed separately. Further correlation 
analyses supported the findings from the meta-
regression analyses (appendix p 5).
Between the years 2003 and 2014, prison suicide rates 
significantly decreased in Scotland (b=–0·777, p=0·0050; 
appendix p 14). Other included countries showed no 
significant changes over time (appendix p 9), including 
when we extended data to include 2015 and 2016 for 
England and Wales.
Prison suicide rates changed more than 40% in one-
third of countries (4 of 12) for men and more than half 
(4 of 7) for women when we compared rates of the period 
2011–2014 with 2003–07 (appendix pp 15,16). Using an

more in prison suicide rates and rate ratios for seven 
countries: Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, 
Sweden, Switzerland, and the USA (appendix p 10). 
There was no significant effect of prison suicide 
definition on rates when different definitions of suicide 
were used (appendix p 11) or by three categories of length 
of imprisonment (appendix p 12).
In the USA, local jails had the highest prison suicide rate 
(45 per 100 000 prisoners) compared with state prisons 
(16 per 100 000 prisoners) and federal prisons (11 per 
100 000 prisoners; appendix p 13), with no clear associations 
between US prison suicide rates and incarceration rates 
(r=0·10, p=0·94, n=3) or rates of overcrowding (r=–0·85, 
p=0·36, n=3).
Discussion
We report on 3906 prison suicides in 24 countries 
between 2011 and 2014, and tested associations between 
suicide rates and 11 prison and health-service related 
factors. Compared with a previous ecological study of 
prison suicides in 2003–07,1 the current investigation has 
doubled the number of countries investigated, added 
new ecological factors, and investigated temporal trends 
in prison suicide rates.
Nordic countries had the highest prison suicide rates of 
more than 100 suicides per 100 000 prisoners in all but 
Denmark (where it was 91 per 100 000), followed by 
western Europe where prison suicide rates in France and 
Belgium were more than 100 per 100 000 prisoners. 
Australasian and North American countries had 
lower rates, ranging from 23 to 67 suicides per 
100 000 prisoners. The high rates of prison suicide in 
Norway and France compared with other countries are

notable. A possible explanation for these higher suicide 
rates could be a broader definition of suicide in custody 
for the country in question. In Norway, for example, 
deaths by suicide of prisoners outside prison are included 
as prison suicides (eg, if the individual dies in hospital or 
during community leave while still a prisoner). However, 
Norway has been assessed as having good validity and 
reliability for suicide classification,24 so the high rates are 
unlikely to be inflated. Similarly, French prison suicide 
figures include prisoners who have died in community 
settings including hospital and permitted leave; however, 
even when these numbers are excluded, the French rate 
remains the second highest. Furthermore, differences in 
definitions of prison suicide do not appear to affect 
pooled estimates of prison suicide rates (appendix p 11).
Rate ratios, or rates compared with those in the general 
population of the same sex and similar age, were typically 
higher than 3 in men and 9 in women, and provide an 
updated picture of the high relative risks of prison 
suicide, and that the relative excess is higher in female 
prisoners than in male prisoners. However, the higher 
rate ratios in women than men were not clearly associated 
with higher rates of prison suicide in women (appendix 
pp 3,4). Rate ratios were higher in Nordic and other 
northern European countries compared with northern 
America and Australasia. Central and southern Europe 
had wide variations.
We observed a number of findings with relation to 
temporal trends. The first was a reduction from 
2003 to 2014 in prison suicide rates in Scotland. One of 
the explanations for this change was changes in drug 
treatment within custody.25 A second finding was the lack 
of any clear temporal trends for England and Wales, 
Belgium, Netherlands, and Sweden. Further research 
should examine trends in other countries.
One explanation for the negative association between 
prison suicide rates and incarceration rates is that 
prisoners in countries with lower incarceration rates are 
more likely to have committed more serious and violent 
crimes or have higher rates of mental illness, both of 
which are associated with increased suicide risk.20 In 
countries with high incarceration rates, the prison 
population is likely to be more heterogeneous leading to 
a dilution of high-risk groups. Based on this finding, 
future research should investigate associations between 
offence categories and prison suicide rates.
Most of the examined prison-level factors were not 
associated with prison suicide rates, suggesting that 
prison suicides are likely to be the result of a complex 
interaction of different factors, and not merely due to the 
prison environment.21 Studying these factors within 
countries could be informative, and their interaction 
might also provide some explanation. Nevertheless, this 
study underscores the importance of individual factors 
for current suicide prevention efforts, which have shown 
that there are replicable associations with ethnicity, 
sentence length, self-harm, and a number of clinical 
factors.20 To supplement these, more sensitive markers of 
health care need to be routinely recorded, which most 
data sources are lacking. These markers would include 
details of how many people are engaged in active 
treatment (pharmacological or psychological), and the 
extent and quality of prison health care, including 
pathways from screening to treatment. Other prison 
ecological factors that might have been informative 
include assault rates within prison, rates of self-harm, 
amount of daily meaningful activity,9 prisoner numbers 
involved in employment, education, or vocational 
training, and access to ligature points. These factors were 
reported for very few of the included countries. In 
addition, many important risk factors are present in 
prisoners before incarceration, including mental health, 
substance misuse, and personality problems, together 
with childhood and more recent traumatic and other 
adverse experiences.26–28
We have collected data from 24 countries over a 
4-year period, which have allowed for an investigation of 
ecological factors. Our data were collected from high-
quality data sources, with much coming directly from 
each country’s prison service research administration. 
However, an important limitation is differences in the 
definition of suicide in custody, which might contribute 
to variability in suicide rates. We have documented 
definitions of suicide, so that rates can be interpreted 
accordingly and have shown that the effect of prison 
suicide definition may be minimal (appendix p 11).
The data used in this study included prisoners in 
pretrial detention. Because disaggregated suicide data 
were not available, it was not possible to examine whether 
reported associations with prison factors are relevant to 
solely pretrial detainees. Additionally, we were limited by 
the range of ecological factors available and the

availability of disaggregated data regarding the type of 
prison facility within each country.
Overall, our findings suggest that there are no simple 
ecological explanations for prison suicide. Rather, it is 
likely to be due to complex interactions between 
individual-level and ecological factors. Thus, suicide 
prevention initiatives need to draw on multidisciplinary 
approaches that address all parts of the criminal justice 
system and address individual and system-level risk 
factors.21 Future work should focus on within-country 
investigation of psychiatric health-care provision and 
other potentially more relevant ecological factors, in 
combination with established individual suicide risk 
factors, to help gain a more comprehensive understanding 
of the factors contributing to suicide in prison. Finally, 
this study underscores the need for national strategies to 
address the problem of prison suicide.
