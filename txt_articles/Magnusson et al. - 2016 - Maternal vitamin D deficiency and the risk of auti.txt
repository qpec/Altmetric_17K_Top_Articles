Background
Maternal vitamin D deficiency may increase risk of
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but direct evidence is
lacking.
Aims
To clarify the relationship between maternal vitamin D
deficiency and offspring risk of ASD with and without
intellectual disability.
Method
Using a register-based total population study (N=509 639), we
calculated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) of ASD with and without intellectual disability in
relation to lifetime diagnoses of maternal vitamin D deficiency.
Although rare, such deficiency was associated with offspring
risk of ASD with, but not without, intellectual disability (aORs
2.51, 95% CI 1.22–5.16 and 1.28, 0.68–2.42). Relationships were
stronger in non-immigrant children.
Conclusions
If reflecting associations for prenatal hypovitaminosis, these
findings imply gestational vitamin D substitution as a means of
ASD prevention.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are developmental disorders
associated with a high individual and societal burden, but their
aetiology is poorly understood. Environmental and genetic factors
appear equally important,1 although ASD with and without
intellectual disability may in part have different origins.2,3
In high-latitude countries such as Sweden, children of mothers
with dark complexion are at particularly elevated risk of ASD with
intellectual disability.3 Because such women often have very low
vitamin D levels due to melanin absorption of UVB radiation,
maternal vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to contribute to
ASD risk in offspring.4,5 Indeed, experimentally induced vitamin D
deficiency in pregnant dams is reported to affect foetal neurodeve-
lopment and behaviour in adult offspring in rats,4 and a recent
study demonstrated lower neonatal vitamin D levels in children
with ASD compared with their siblings.6
Early life vitamin D deficiency is thus a possible risk factor for
ASD, but direct support of an association is lacking.4 Maternal
hypovitaminosis D is treatable, thus investigation of the matter is
warranted. We report here on the relationship between secondary
care diagnosis of lifetime maternal vitamin D deficiency and offspring
risk of ASD with and without intellectual disability, while addressing
the influence of ethnicity. We use data from the Stockholm Youth
Cohort (SYC), which allow for detailed case ascertainment in the total
population of young people in Stockholm, Sweden.
Method
We conducted a cohort study using the SYC, comprising all
Swedish-born individuals aged 4–17 years who were resident for
at least 4 years in Stockholm County between 2001 and 2011 and
had complete covariate data (N=509 639).7 Prospectively recorded
data on probands and their relatives were retrieved from registers
as previously described.7
We identified cases from several national and regional registers,
using a validated approach covering all known pathways of ASD
diagnosis and care in Stockholm County.7 The National Patient
Register contains the dates and discharge diagnoses of all in-patient
(since 1973) and specialist out-patient care (since 2001) in Sweden.7
Using this source, we defined exposure as a lifetime-recorded
diagnosis of unspecified vitamin D deficiency (ICD-10 E55.9 or
ICD-9 268.9), corresponding to a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level
of less than 25 nmol/L (with clinical manifestations such as
osteomalacia, muscle aches and weakness), in the biological mother.
We considered other parental characteristics described below
(also see Table 1) as potential confounders or mediators based on
their associations with ASD and vitamin D deficiency.5,8,9
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4. We first calculated
frequencies and means of case status and other characteristics
according to lifetime maternal vitamin D deficiency, with Pearson’s
chi-square tests to compute the difference between proportions and t-
tests to test the difference between means. Using logistic regression
models, we then derived odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for all ASDs, and dichotomised into ASD with or
without intellectual disability, in relation to the exposure. Cluster
robust standard errors accounted for non-independence within
family clusters. We first estimated associations adjusting only for
gender and year of birth, and then after additional adjustment for
parental ages, income, education, and lifetime histories of diagnosed
affective disorders, non-affective psychosis, ASD, attention deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability, epilepsy and prescrip-
tions for anticonvulsants. We then included maternal country of birth
in a third model. Lastly, we evaluated whether lifetime maternal
vitamin D deficiency was differently associated with ASD among
children with and without maternal histories of migration. We
calculated chi-square tests as a test for homogeneity of associations

 with ASD, respectively, with and without intellectual disability, and
between Swedish-born children versus children of migrant mothers.
Results
By the end of follow-up in 31 December 2011, 9882 ASD cases
were identified including 2476 with intellectual disability and 7406
without intellectual disability. Lifetime maternal vitamin D
deficiency was rare according to secondary care diagnoses and
recorded in only 547 individuals (0.1%). It was strongly associated
with socioeconomic and medical parental characteristics (Table 1)
including maternal psychiatric disorders, but not with preterm or
small for gestational age births.
Diagnosed lifetime maternal vitamin D deficiency was asso-
ciated with risk of ASD and, in particular, of ASD with intellectual
disability (P for homogeneity 0.17) (Table 2), although there was
some attenuation upon adjustment for parental characteristics.
Associations varied with maternal migration status (P for homo-
geneity 0.05) as risks were more pronounced in native-born
children (ORs being 7.08, 95% CI 2.96–16.94 and 2.15, 0.85–5.45
for ASD with and without intellectual disability, respectively).
Discussion
This study is, to our knowledge, the first population-based study
to estimate the relationship between maternal vitamin D defi-
ciency and the risk of ASD in a child. We found a positive
association which was especially noticeable for ASD with intellec-
tual disability, and for children of non-immigrant mothers.
Our findings should, however, be interpreted with caution.
Although we had access to a large sample size, estimates of
associations were based on low numbers. Second, maternal vitamin
D status was identified from secondary care records, and therefore
under-ascertained and perhaps differentially so with regard to ASD
risk factors. Indeed, diagnosed maternal vitamin D deficiency co-
occurred with such factors including parental psychiatric histories10
(including depression, a proxy also for in utero exposure to anti‐
depressants, shown to, rather than the underlying disorder, increase
the risk of ASD),11 immigration status3 and disadvantageous social
position.8 Hence, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. Lastly,
we used vitamin D deficiency recorded at any time as the exposure –
and not timed to pregnancy, as no cases diagnosed before the birth
of a child were identified. Therefore, reverse causality may be a

Maternal vitamin D deficiency and risk of autism spectrum disorders
 concern. No cases of vitamin D deficiency were recorded before the
birth of a child. However, given that vitamin D deficiency among
pregnant women in Sweden is detected only when outright screened
for,12 many cases of deficiency are likely to manifest well before any
official diagnosis is recorded.
Our finding of a stronger association between maternal hypo‐
vitaminosis D and ASD with intellectual disability than without
intellectual disability is in line with migrant studies, demonstrating
that offspring risk of severe forms of ASD – but not Asperger’s
syndrome or ASD without intellectual disability – is increased
in migrant populations where vitamin D deficiency is highly
prevalent.3–6,8 There is also mounting evidence that environmental
factors are more relevant (than genetic factors) for the development
of lower-functioning ASD.2 We, as well as others,6 further observed
heterogeneity in the associations between vitamin D deficiency and
ASD between children with and without maternal migrant history.
This discrepancy might be due to a limited range of exposure in
children of immigrant mothers, as the majority of children and preg‐
nant mothers with migrant background have neonatal/gestational
vitamin D deficiency, according to recent Swedish reports.6,11
Causality cannot be inferred from our study. There are,
however, biological underpinnings of a true association as experi-
mental studies indicate critical roles of vitamin D in the develop-
ment and functioning of the brain.4
In summary, our results support, but do not prove, the
hypothesis that maternal vitamin D status is implicated in the
aetiology of ASD with comorbid intellectual disability. As vitamin D
deficiency in pregnancy is both prevalent and treatable, further
investigation of this association is needed.
