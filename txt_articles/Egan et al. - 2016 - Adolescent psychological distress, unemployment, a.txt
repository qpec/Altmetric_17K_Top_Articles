Rationale: Several studies have shown a link between psychological distress in early life and subsequent
higher unemployment, but none have used sibling models to account for the unobserved family back-
ground characteristics which may explain the relationship.
Objective: This paper uses the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 data to examine whether
adolescent psychological distress in 2000 predicts higher unemployment over 2000e11, whether this
relationship changed in the period following the Great Recession, and whether it is robust to adjustment
for family effects.
Methods: 7125 cohort members (2986 siblings) self-reported their mental health in 2000 and employ-
ment activities over 2000e11. This association was examined using Probit and ordinary least squares
regressions controlling for intelligence, physical health, other sociodemographic characteristics and
family background.
Results: After adjustment for covariates and compared to those with low distress, highly distressed
adolescents were 2.7 percentage points (32%) more likely to be unemployed, 5.1 points (26%) more likely
to be unemployed or out of the labor force and experienced 11 weeks (28%) more unemployment. The
impact of high distress was similar to a one standard deviation decrease in intelligence, and double the
magnitude of having a serious physical health problem, and these estimates were robust to adjustment
for family fixed-effects. The highly distressed were also disproportionately more likely to become un-
employed or exit the labor force in the years following the Great Recession.
Conclusion: These findings provide strong evidence of the unemployment penalty of early-life psycho-
logical distress and suggest that this relationship may be intensified during economic recessions.
Investing in mental health in early life may be an effective way to reduce unemployment.

1. Introduction
The unemployed consistently report worse mental health than
the employed (Paul and Moser, 2009). Unemployment has adverse
mental health consequences. However, it remains unclear whether
pre-adulthood mental health leads to success in avoiding unem-
ployment. Psychological distress, as indexed by low mood, anxiety,
neuroticism, depression and psychiatric conditions, has been
shown to predict worse employment prospects in longitudinal
studies following both adults (Chatterji et al., 2007; Ettner et al.,
1997; Layard, 2013; Uysal and Pohlmeier, 2011) and children and
adolescents for several years and even decades (Egan et al., 2015;
Fergusson et al., 2007; Goodman et al., 2011). While these studies
typically adjust for important potential confounding variables such
as parental socioeconomic status and intelligence, they have not
been able to rule out the possibility that unobserved family back-
ground characteristics explain the relationship between mental
health and subsequent unemployment.
A smaller set of studies have attempted to isolate the link be-
tween early life mental health and labor market outcomes by
comparing the outcomes of siblings and twins, an analytic strategy
which accounts for a large portion of unobserved heterogeneity by
capturing
unmeasured
factors

 neighborhood environment. Smith and Smith (2010) showed that
siblings who recalled having had childhood psychological problems
went on to work seven fewer weeks on average in adulthood than
their siblings who did not recall such problems. Currie et al. (2010)
found that children diagnosed as having attention deficit hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD) or conduct disorders before the age of 18
were 10 percentage points more likely to receive social assistance
as adults. Fletcher (2013) found that differences in depression
levels in grades 7e12 predicted 7e8 percentage points lower
employment when participants were aged 30 on average, reducing
to a non-significant 5 points when controlling for family fixed-
effects. Finally, Lundborg et al. (2014) used data on Swedish
males born between 1950 and 1970 to show that mental health
conditions at 18e19 years of age strongly predicted within family
variation in employment in 2003.
Whilst this literature has examined broad outcomes such as
social assistance (Currie et al., 2010) and employment (Fletcher,
2013; Lundborg et al., 2014; Smith and Smith, 2010), no studies
have utilized sibling models to examine unemployment specifically
as an outcome. Those studies which have examined employment
have derived their outcome measures as a function of earnings (e.g.,
creating a binary employment variable where 1 ¼ positive earn-
ings) or examined the total number of weeks worked in a year. This
approach does not uniquely categorize the unemployed, nor
adequately distinguish between those who are unemployed versus
out of the labor force, making precise comparisons between the
employed and unemployed difficult. Additionally, all four of these
studies examined the labor market outcome only at a single point
in time and before unemployment rates increased dramatically
around the world as the Great Recession began to affect global labor
markets in 2008e09.
This paper adds to this literature by using the National Longi-
tudinal Study of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) data from the United States to
examine whether adolescent psychological distress in 2000 pre-
dicts greater unemployment over 2000e2011 while using sibling
fixed-effects analysis to isolate the link between mental health and
unemployment. It makes three main contributions. First, it exam-
ines unemployment specifically as an outcome. Second, it uses the
extremely rich weekly employment history data in the NLSY97 to
examine unemployment trends continuously over a 12-year period.
Our analytic strategy therefore allows for a precise delineation of
the effect of psychological distress during the important transition
from education into the labor force. Third, the time period observed
(2000e2011) allows for an examination of whether the employ-
ment penalty of psychological distress intensified following the
Great Recession.
2. Data and method
2.1. Participants and procedure
Participants were from the NLSY97, a nationally-representative
cohort from the United States of 8984 individuals (including 3855
siblings) born in 1980e1984 and interviewed in person or via
telephone on an annual basis since 1997. During these interviews
the cohort members were asked to describe their recent employ-
ment history in detail. These variables were used to examine the
relationship between the cohort members' mental health in 2000
and their self-reported weekly employment histories from January
2000 to December 2011. Sibling fixed-effects analysis was used to
examine this relationship while accounting for unobserved family
background characteristics. Difference-in-difference analyses were
used to test whether those with poor mental health were more
likely to become unemployed or exit the labor force (UOLF) after
the onset of the Great Recession. The main analysis used a
maximum sample of 4,002,558 observations for 7125 cohort
members and the sibling analysis used a maximum sample of
1,684,984 observations for 2986 cohort members.
2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Mental health
Table S1 and Figure S1 describe the mental health variable used
in our analysis (see Supplementary Materials, Section 1). The
NLSY97 evaluates the cohort members' mental health using the 5-
item version of the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5; Berwick et al.,
1991), an established predictor of depression and anxiety disorders
(Rumpf et al., 2001), which has been validated for use with ado-
lescents (Ostroff et al., 1996). When the cohort members were aged
16e20 in 2000, they were asked to rate on a four-point scale from
‘none of the time’ to ‘all of the time’ how often they felt “nervous/
calm and peaceful/down or blue/happy/depressed” over the pre-
vious month. In order to create the main independent variable,
these answers were coded so that a higher score indicated worse
mental health, and were then summed (Cronbach's a ¼ 0.77) to
create a composite mental health variable with a score range of
0e15 (Mean [M] ¼ 4.7, standard deviation [SD] ¼ 2.5). Because
there is not a single validated cut-off score for the MHI-5 (Kelly
et al., 2008), our analysis followed the approach of Evans-Lacko
et al. (2013) and classified those individuals scoring at least 1 SD
above the mean MHI-5 score as experiencing high levels of distress
(corresponding to 942 cohort members out of 7125). Henceforth
those scoring below this cut-off point are referred to as having ‘low
distress’ and those above as having ‘high distress’. The proportion of
cohort members defined as having high distress using this cut-off
(13%) is similar to recent estimates of the 12-month prevalence of
a major depressive episode among American 16e17 year olds
(11.4%) and the proportion of 18e25 year olds having any diag-
nosable mental illness in the past year (19.6%) (National Institute of
Mental Health, 2015).
Although the MHI-5 has been administered to the cohort
members every two years since 2000, our analysis used only the
initial measure as our main independent variable. Our aim is to
evaluate the cohort members' mental health before they have
accumulated significant experience in the labor market. Using a
measure of mental health elicited in adolescence should mean that
labor market experiences (such as prolonged unemployment) have
not yet substantially affected the mental health of the cohort
members. This assumption was tested in sensitivity analyses,
described in Section 4 of the Supplementary Materials, which
found that our results were not substantially affected by excluding
cohort members who had experienced unemployment before the
mental health measure was elicited in 2000.
2.2.2. Employment outcomes
There were three outcome variables. The first was a binary
variable tracking employment status over 626 weeks (January
2000eDecember 2011), coded as 0 if the cohort member was in
full- or part-time employment, and coded as 1 if they were un-
employed. This variable was used to estimate the average proba-
bility of unemployment over the 12 years surveyed. Second, a
variable
measuring
disengagement
from
employment
more
broadly was coded as 0 for the employed and coded as 1 if the
cohort member was unemployed or out of the labor force (i.e.,
UOLF), the latter category including those in education, home-
makers, the disabled or any other non-employment status. Finally,
a continuous variable measuring total weeks of unemployment
over 2000e2011, was created by summing the weekly unemploy-
ment variables (M ¼ 40.6, SD ¼ 52.6, range ¼ 0e449). For this
measure, 54% of cohort members reported 6 months or less of
M. Egan et al. / Social Science & Medicine 156 (2016) 98e105
99
 unemployment, 19% reported 6e12 months, 16% reported 12e24
months and 11% reported 24 or more months.
2.2.3. Covariates
The main covariates were gender, age, socioeconomic status,
intelligence, physical health, race, and a time variable. The sample
was 49% female and around 1400 cohort members were born in
each year of 1980e1984. Age was measured by month of birth
(ranging from January 1980 to December 1984). As a proxy for the
cohort members' initial socioeconomic status (SES), the resident
mother's completed years of education was used. This ranged from
first grade to eight or more years of college. If cohort members were
missing data for this variable, the resident father's years of edu-
cation was used in order to maximize sample size. The correlation
between the resident mothers' and resident fathers' years of edu-
cation was 0.66 (p < 0.001; N ¼ 5704), indicating a reasonable
degree of substitutability. Intelligence was measured in 1997 using
the computer adaptive Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery
(ASVAB) which combines math and verbal scores from four key
subtests (Mathematical Knowledge, Arithmetic Reasoning, Word
Knowledge, and Paragraph Comprehension); this measure was
standardized. Poor physical health in early life is a particularly
important control variable since this could plausibly lead to both
poor mental health and unemployment. Including this measure
also allows for a comparison of the relative employment penalties
of poor mental health vs. physical health. This binary measure was
coded as 1 if a parent stated in 1997 that the cohort member had
any one of 10 serious physical conditions: asthma, a heart condi-
tion, anemia, diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, infectious disease, kidney
problems, allergies or a category for other conditions (10.9% of the
sample had at least one condition). A categorical variable was
created for the four racial groups (the sample was 53% White, 26%
Black, 20% Hispanic, and 1% Mixed Race). Finally, a yearly time
variable was included to take into account changing macro-
economic conditions over the 12 years surveyed.
After dropping 1865 cohort members who were missing data on
either the mental or physical health variables, the remaining 7125
cohort members had modest amounts of missing data for the SES
and intelligence variables (6% and 17%, respectively). Values for
these two variables were imputed using a predictive mean
matching approach, described in Section 2 of the Supplementary
Materials.
2.2.4. Education as a pathway between distress and unemployment
Given that prior research has demonstrated that poor mental
health predicts worse academic performance (Currie and Stabile,
2009; Fletcher, 2010), our analysis tested whether different levels
of educational attainment could explain the relationship between
mental health and unemployment in the NLSY97 sample. A mea-
sure of the cohort members' educational attainment, elicited as of
the latest wave, was coded as 0 ¼ No degree (10% of a sample of
7108 reporting education data), 1 ¼ General Educational Develop-
ment qualification (GED) (12%), 2 ¼ High school (45%), 3 ¼ Junior/
Associate College (7%) and 4 ¼ Undergraduate degree or higher
(26%). If the inclusion of the education variable in our regressions
markedly diminished the distress coefficients, this would suggest
that different levels of educational attainment operated as a
pathway between mental health and unemployment.
2.2.5. Recession
The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the Great
Recession in the United States as beginning in December 2007 and
ending in June 2009 (NBER, 2010). However, this window does not
fully capture the lagged post-recession increase in unemployment
rates and the persistently high subsequent unemployment rates
experienced by young people. In the NLSY97 sample, the unem-
ployment rate only rose significantly at the start of 2009 and
remained high until the end of the data-range in December 2011. In
order to examine whether the post-recession increase in unem-
ployment disproportionately affected those with poor mental
health, difference-in-difference analysis was used to examine
average unemployment rates by levels of mental health before and
after the sharp increase in unemployment in 2009. Difference-in-
difference analyses rely on the assumption of parallel trends be-
tween different groups prior to some external shock. In the context
of the current study, this methodology is suitable given that there is
a relatively consistent difference in unemployment levels of around
3 percentage points between those with low and high distress
during 2006e2008, a period when much of the sample was tran-
sitioning from education into the labor force or had already
completed the transition. Comparing average unemployment rates
for these two groups in 2006e08 versus 2009e2011 will show
whether the post-recession unemployment increase was dispro-
portionately larger for those with high distress. Our analysis tested
this by interacting a binary recession variable (0 ¼ January 2006 e
December 2008, 1 ¼ January 2009 e December 2011) with the
mental health measure.
2.2.6. Siblings
Despite the presence of the control variables described above, it
is possible, even likely, that our models omit important “third”
variables which may influence both mental health and unem-
ployment. To address the possibility that unmeasured family
background factors may explain the link between adolescent
distress and unemployment, our main analyses was complemented
with sibling fixed-effects models. The sibling analyses omitted half-
siblings since they were more likely to have different family back-
grounds for at least part of their childhood, which sibling fixed-
effects analysis would not adequately adjust for. The sibling anal-
ysis therefore contains only full brothers and sisters. Across sibling
models are statistically identical to including a dummy variable for
each family. By comparing the outcomes of siblings, these models
control for stable, unobserved family-specific characteristics that
differ between but not within families. In addition, the portion of
genetic variation that is shared between siblings is adjusted for (i.e.
50% common variation shared by full siblings), providing a partial
control for genetic endowment. This analysis can clarify whether
factors common to the siblings, such as growing up in a high-crime
neighborhood, having parents with mental health or substance
abuse problems, having negligent parents or a disruptive childhood
environment, may have been the ultimate cause of both distress
and unemployment, rather than distress leading to unemployment
per se. If the inclusion of family fixed-effects markedly reduced the
distress coefficients in our regressions, this would indicate that the
relationship between distress and unemployment was confounded
by common unobserved family effects which correlate with both
distress and unemployment. The limitations of the sibling fixed-
effects approach are described in Section 3 of the Supplementary
Materials.
2.2.7. Statistical methods
Probit models were specified to estimate the association be-
tween high distress in 2000 and the week-by-week probability of
unemployment/UOLF over 2000e11 (Model 1). Marginal effects
were calculated for these models in order to present the results
more intuitively (Long and Freese, 2014). Ordinary least squares
(OLS) regressions were specified to estimate the total number of
weeks unemployed from 2000 to 11 (Model 2) and a difference-in-
difference Probit model was specified to examine whether highly
distressed cohort members were disproportionately more likely to
M. Egan et al. / Social Science & Medicine 156 (2016) 98e105
100
 become unemployed/UOLF in the years following the recession
(Model 3). This latter model used the margins command in Stata
(Long and Freese, 2014) to estimate the average predicted proba-
bility of the outcome by levels of distress in 2006e2008 (pre-
recession) and 2009e11 (post-recession). Standard errors were
clustered by individual in Models 1 and 3 to account for repeated
observations of the same individual. All models controlled for
gender, intelligence, parental education, physical health problems,
race and age. For sibling fixed-effects analysis, Models 1 and 2 were
re-run with a set of (n-1) family-specific dummy variables included
in the regressions, where n was the total number of families with
complete data on the outcome variable and all covariates. The

3. Results
3.1. Descriptive statistics
Table 1 and Fig. 1 show descriptive statistics. Females had worse
mental health than males (Females ¼ 5.15, Males ¼ 4.20; t ¼ �16.0,
p < 0.0001), in line with much of the literature. Compared to the
low distress group, the highly distressed were more likely to be
female (61.7% vs. 47.0%), supporting the rationale for gender con-
trols in our model. The highly distressed also had lower intelligence
scores (39.7 vs. 47.3), were more likely to report their parent having
fewer than 12 years of education (28.9% vs. 20.5%) and were more
likely to report having no high school degree or a GED qualification
(30.6% vs. 20.2%). These patterns of lower parental education and
intelligence scores among young people with high distress corre-
spond to prior research using American data (Fletcher, 2010, 2013)
and underscore the importance of including both variables as
covariates when examining the link between psychological prob-
lems and later economic outcomes (Daly, 2011).
Employment statistics also varied considerably as a function of
psychological distress. Over 2000e2011 the highly distressed had a
higher average unemployment rate than the low distress group
(16.0% vs. 10.9%), a higher out-of-labor-force (OLF) rate (30.6% vs.
24.7%), and spent more weeks unemployed (52.8 vs 38.7 weeks).
Fig. 1 shows graphically that the highly distressed experienced
consistently higher rates of unemployment/OLF over 2000e2011
and that these differences were exacerbated in 2009 when the
Great Recession began to affect the labor market. From 2008 to
2009, the highly distressed experienced almost twice as large a
drop in employment rate as the low distress group (5.8 vs 3.0
percentage points). Finally, the sibling sample did not substantially
differ
from
the
general
sample
on
the
basis
of
observed
characteristics.
3.2. Regressions
Fig. 2 summarizes our main results, which are further detailed in
Table S2 (main regressions) and Table S3 (sibling fixed-effects re-
gressions) (see Supplementary Materials, Section 5). After adjust-
ment for covariates and compared to those with low distress, high
distress in 2000 was associated with a 2.7 percentage point (95%
confidence interval [CI] ¼ 2.0 to 3.5 points) higher probability of
unemployment over 2000e11, a 5.1 point (95% CI ¼ 3.5 to 6.8)
higher probability of UOLF and 11 weeks (95% CI ¼ 9.4 to 12.8) more
unemployment. In percentage terms, high distress predicted a 32%
higher probability of unemployment, a 28% higher probability of
UOLF, and 28% more weeks of unemployment. The effect of high
distress on all three outcomes was similar in magnitude to a one SD
decrease in intelligence and around double the magnitude of hav-
ing a physical health condition. High distress remained an impor-
tant predictor of unemployment even after adjusting for family
fixed-effects, indicating that the association between distress and
unemployment was not confounded by unobserved shared family
characteristics (see Fig. 2). In other words, when comparing only
the outcomes of siblings, a sibling with high distress was predicted
to experience substantially more unemployment on average than a
sibling with low distress.
Across the three outcomes, adjusting for educational attainment
reduced the distress coefficient by 20% without altering signifi-
cance levels, indicating that different levels of education only partly
explained why the highly distressed experienced more unem-
ployment (see Table S2). Regressions stratified by gender (Table S5)
and educational attainment (Tables S6a-c) found that high distress
predicted higher unemployment for both men and women, and for
both university graduates and those with no educational attain-
ment (Supplementary Materials, Section 6).
Fig. 3 and Table S4 show our difference-in-difference results.
Comparing 2006e08 to 2009e11, the average probability of un-
employment for the group with low distress (high distress) rose
from 6.4% to 10.2% (8.4%e13.6%). The difference in average unem-
ployment level between these groups therefore increased by 1.5
percentage points (a 79% increase from a 1.9 to 3.5 point gap)
(p ¼ 0.07). Over the same periods, the average predicted probability
of UOLF for the group with low distress (high distress) rose from
21.7% to 24.8% (26.0%e31.5%). The difference in average UOLF rate
between these groups therefore increased by 2.5 percentage points
(a 60% increase from a 4.2 to 6.7 point gap) (p ¼ 0.02). These effects
were partly driven by the least educated cohort members, who had
disproportionately high rates of distress, being more likely to exit
employment after 2009 (see Table S4).
4. Discussion
This study found that NLSY97 cohort members classified as
having high distress in 2000 were significantly more likely to
experience unemployment over the subsequent decade; these ef-
fects were similar to a one SD decrease in intelligence and double
the magnitude of having a serious physical health condition.
Notably, the unemployment effects were robust to adjustment for
M. Egan et al. / Social Science & Medicine 156 (2016) 98e105
101
 family fixed-effects. This ability to exploit sibling clusters to control
for family background represents a major strength of this study
given that there are many plausible unobserved background char-
acteristics (such as an adverse childhood environment or parental
mental health problems) which could be the “true cause” of the
association between distress and unemployment. The fact that
distress remains an important predictor of unemployment even
when comparing the outcomes of siblings, while not conclusively
demonstrating causality, does show that the relationship is robust
to controlling for a substantial portion of potential omitted-variable
bias.
There are several reasons why early psychological distress may
lead to lower employment later in life. Persistent distress may lead
to less effective engagement during a person's school years,
culminating in reduced educational attainment limiting future
employment opportunities (Currie and Stabile, 2009; Fletcher,
2010). However, our supplementary analyses showed that con-
trols for educational attainment could only explain a relatively
small portion (approximately 20%) of the link between distress and
variation in unemployment outcomes. Whilst work performance
was not observed in the current study, it remains possible that
anxiety and depression could have directly impaired job perfor-
mance (Lerner and Henke, 2008) and work attendance (Lagerveld
et al., 2010; St€
ormer and Fahr, 2013), leading to less positive eval-
uations by employers and adversely affecting job retention.
Furthermore, entry into employment may also be impaired given
that job search, a psychologically demanding process requiring
reserves of perseverance, motivation and self-esteem, may be
particularly challenging for highly distressed individuals. Finally,
employers may be biased against hiring or accommodating em-
ployees with mental health issues (Scheid,1999). These factors may
be intensified by the existence of stigma related to mental health
issues, low awareness of available treatments and relatively limited
treatment facilities compared to those available for physical health
(Layard, 2013).
A test of unemployment trends after the onset of the Great
Recession found that the highly distressed were 60% more likely
than those with low distress to become unemployed or exit the
labor force (i.e., UOLF) in 2009e11 compared to 2006e08. This ef-
fect was partly driven by sharply increasing unemployment rates
among the least educated cohort members, who also reported the
highest rate of distress. This finding expands upon previous work
which found that highly distressed children were later dispropor-
tionately more likely to become unemployed after the 1980 UK
recession (Egan et al., 2015) and suggests that distress may be a risk
factor for unemployment during recessions more generally. The
rise in the reported frequency of mental health disorders among
the unemployed in Europe after the Great Recession (e.g., Evans-
Lacko et al., 2013) may therefore be partly due to more distressed
individuals having been more likely to become unemployed, rather
than unemployment worsening the mental health of previously
healthy individuals.
These findings contribute to three literatures. First, while there
is abundant evidence that unemployment can worsen mental
health (Paul and Moser, 2009), this study provides evidence in the
other direction, by using a mental health measure elicited before
the cohort members had been exposed to prolonged unemploy-
ment. Second, economic downturns are typically accompanied by

 worsening population-level mental health (Cooper, 2011) such as
increases in suicide rates (Chang et al., 2013) and internet searches
concerning mental illness (Ayers et al., 2012). Our results suggest
that an increased risk of unemployment among the distressed in
the aftermath of the Great Recession could have led to further rises
in distress in this group potentially contributing to population-level
increases in mental health problems. Finally, there is a literature,
reviewed by Suhrcke and Stuckler (2012), which finds that re-
cessions are on aggregate good for health in so far as they promote
positive lifestyle habits (e.g., less alcohol consumption, greater
leisure time) and reduce a diverse range of cause-specific mortality
rates (e.g., alcohol-related deaths and road accidents, although
suicide rates are an important exception to this trend). Suhrcke and
Stuckler suggest that this population-level improvement likely
masks deteriorations in health among those who become unem-
ployed; one question raised by our findings is the extent to which
this deterioration is present among the unemployed with a history
of distress.
The sizeable effect of distress on unemployment identified here
is in keeping with a broader literature showing that poor mental
health in early life predicts worse socioeconomic outcomes in areas
such as employment, education and earnings, with greater relative
penalties than the cost of early physical health problems (Delaney
and Smith, 2012). Given that the total lifetime economic costs
resulting from childhood psychological problems have been esti-
mated to be over $2 trillion in the United States (Smith and Smith,
2010), the question naturally arises as to what extent poor mental
health can be ameliorated. Interventions which reduce anxiety and
depression, particularly if targeted early in life, might have a large
economic return if they shift people into a trajectory of more active
employment and increased lifetime earnings. Given that the MHI-5
and other short self-report mental health measures have proven to
be reliable measures of mental health and robust predictors of
future economic outcomes, they could plausibly be embedded in
school, work and job search environments in order to identify at
risk individuals and direct resources towards improving their
mental health. Public awareness campaigns designed to reduce the
stigma around mental health and promote the availability of
treatments might also be an effective way to reduce the economic
penalty of distress. Finally, in line with recent work emphasizing
prevention rather than remediation when addressing human cap-
ital deficits (Heckman and Kautz, 2013), interventions which target
determinants of child mental health (such as maternal depression;
Goodman, Rouse, et al., 2011) and prevent psychological distress
from developing could promote later socioeconomic success while
maximizing the return on the cost of the intervention.
4.1. Limitations
This study has two main limitations. First, although the data
contained a mental health measure which is a validated predictor of
depression and anxiety in adolescents (the MHI-5), it is more likely
to be prone to measurement error than, for example, a clinical
assessment of mental health. Second, while our analyses control for
cognitive ability, the data do not contain a strong measure of
noncognitive skills. Noncognitive skills are increasingly recognised
as important predictors of labor market outcomes (Egan et al., in
press; Heckman et al., 2006) and are likely to be correlated with
psychological distress. Whilst adjusting
for such traits may
diminish the contribution of adolescent distress to later unem-
ployment, prior work suggests that this attenuation is unlikely to
be substantial: Lundborg et al. (2014) found sizeable effects of
distress on labor market outcomes even after controlling for
noncognitive skills. Furthermore, re-analysis of the sample in Egan

(High ¼ �1 standard deviation above the mean score on the mental health measure, 13% of sample vs. Low ¼ remainder of the sample). Employed is coded as 0 ¼ Unemployed/Out
of the labor force (OLF), 1 ¼ Employed. Unemployed is coded as 0 ¼ Employed, 1 ¼ Unemployed. OLF is coded as 0 ¼ Employed, 1 ¼ OLF.

 et al. (2015) found that adjusting for the important noncognitive
trait of self-control (Daly et al., 2015) led to just a 22% reduction in
the distress-unemployment link.
5. Conclusions
In a national sample, highly distressed adolescents went on to
be at higher risk of unemployment as adults, and this elevated risk
was accentuated during the Great Recession. Our results lend
credence to the potential economic benefits of investment in
adolescent mental health services. They also point to the potential
value of job activation programs which aim to promote resilience
by supporting the unemployed (Caplan et al., 1989) and which offer
fully voluntary access to appropriate mental health services where
needed. By reducing the negative impact of job loss and improving
mental health, such programs could have the additional benefit of
fostering reemployment (Caplan et al., 1989). Further research is
needed to understand how psychological distress may hamper the
transition from education to work and day-to-day job search be-
haviours (Wanberg, 2012), and to estimate the economic cost of
mental health stigma and low awareness of available treatments.
Furthermore, in ongoing research, we are examining the extent to
which specific mental health conditions such as depression and
schizophrenia condition life-long employment trajectories.
