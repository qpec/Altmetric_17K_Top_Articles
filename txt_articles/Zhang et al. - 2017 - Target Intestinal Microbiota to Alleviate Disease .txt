Abstract
Purpose—Emerging evidence has demonstrated that gut microbiome plays essential roles in the 
pathogenesis of human diseases in distant organs. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal 
neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons. Treatment with the 
only FDA approved drug, Riluzole, extends patient life span only for a few months. Thus, there is 
an urgent need to develop novel interventions for alleviating the disease progression and 
improving the quality of life for ALS patients. Here we present evidence that intestinal 
dysfunction and dysbiosis may actively contribute to ALS pathophysiology.
Methods—We used G93A transgenic mice as a model of human ALS. The G93A mice show 
abnormal intestinal microbiome and damaged tight junctions, which occur before ALS disease 
onset. Feeding of the G93A mice with butyrate, a natural bacterial product.
Results—Feeding of the G93A mice with butyrate, restores the intestinal microbial homeostasis, 
improves the gut integrity, and prolongs the life span of the ALS mice. Paneth cells are specialized 
intestinal epithelial cells that regulate the host-bacterial interactions. At the cellular level, we show 
that abnormal Paneth cells were significantly decreased in the ALS mice treated by butyrate. 
Butyrate treatment decreases aggregation of the G93A-SOD1 mutated protein in both ALS mice 
and cultured human intestinal epithelial cells.

Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. Most ALS patients 
die within three to five years due to respiratory paralysis.1 The lifetime risk of ALS is about 
1 in 472 in women and 1 in 350 in men. Since ALS is an age-dependent disease, as the U.S. 
population increases and ages, an increase in the prevalence of ALS can be anticipated. 
Currently there is no intervention that can significantly change the course of the disease.2 
Treatment with the only FDA approved drug, Riluzole, extends patient life span only for a 
few months. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel interventions for alleviating the 
disease progression and improving the quality of life for ALS patients.
Many cases of familial ALS (20–25%) are associated with mutations in the Cu/Zn 
superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1). An ALS mouse model G93A mice harbor human ALS-
causing SOD1 mutations that recapitulate the neuronal and muscle impairment of human 
ALS patients. These mice are extensively used to investigate the pathomechanisms of ALS 
and trial new therapeutics.3–5 Our recent study revealed an exciting phenotype that linked 
aberrant microbial and intestinal homeostasis to disease progression in ALS mice.6 G93A 
mice have dysbiosis (imbalanced gut bacterial profile), disrupted tight junction structure, and 
increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut). These changes occur in young G93A mice 
before ALS symptom onset, suggesting that impaired gut-neuromuscular crosstalk may 
actively contribute to ALS progression and pathogenesis.
Intestinal microbiome community modulates numerous aspects of human physiology and is 
a critical factor in the development of chronic diseases.6 Intestinal epithelial cells are 
consistently exposed to bacteria, a process which plays a key role in development, renewal, 
and immunity.7–9 Frequent microbial challenges to epithelial cells trigger discrete signaling 
pathways, promoting molecular changes, such as the secretion of cytokines and chemokines, 
and alterations to molecules displayed at the epithelial cell surface. Intestinal homeostasis 
and microbiome play essential roles in neurological diseases, such as autism and Parkinson’s 
disease.3, 4 However, restoring intestinal homeostasis and gut microbiome in ALS is 
unexplored.
In the current study, we hypothesize that restoring microbiome and intestinal homeostasis 
delays disease onset and progression of ALS. A leaky gut can contribute to the altered 
microbiome environment that leads to reduced production of beneficial bacterial products. 
Indeed, our study has demonstrated that G93A mice show abnormal microbiome profile with 
reduced population of butyrate-producing bacteria. Remarkably, after being fed with the 
natural bacteria product, butyrate, the G93A mice exhibited a delay in onset of ALS 
symptoms, and a prolonged life span. Our current study has discovered butyrate for restoring

 intestinal homeostasis and microbiome, thus opening a new avenue in targeting the gut 
microbiota-butyrate-axis for ALS treatment.
Materials and Methods
Animals
G93A5 and age matched wild type mice were used in this study. All experiments were 
carried out in strict accordance with the recommendation in the Guide for the Care and Use 
of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by 
the IACUC of Rush University and University of Illinois at Chicago Committee on Animal 
Resources.
Butyrate treatment in G93A mice
G93A 8–9 weeks old mice were divided into two groups randomly. The butyrate-treated 
group receives sodium butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 303410) at a 2% concentration in filtered 
drinking water. Control group receives filtered drinking water without sodium butyrate. All 
mice are provided with water ad libitum, and maintained in a 12 h dark/light cycle. All 
animals are weighted and received detailed clinical examination, which included 
appearance, movement and behavior patterns, skin and hair conditions, eyes and mucous 
membranes, respiration and excreta. If restricted outstretching of the hind legs is observed 
when the tail is hold, it means the symptom of ALS is obvious. Lie the mouse on the back, if 
it can’t turn over in 30 seconds, the mouse is humanely sacrificed.
Western blot analysis and antibodies
Mouse intestinal mucosal cells were collected by scraping from mouse colon, including 
proximal and distal colon, as previously described. 10 Briefly, mouse mucosal cells were 
lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, X100), 150 mM NaCl (J.T. Baker 
3624-19), 10 mM Tris (Fisher Scientific, BP152-5) pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA (Fisher Scientific, 
BP120-1), 1 mM EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich, E3889) pH 8.0, 0.2 mM sodium ortho-vanadate 
(Sigma-Aldrich, S6508) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, 118367001). 
Cultured cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 
H1387), lysed in protein loading buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol 
(Amresco, 0281), 2% SDS (Sigma-Aldrich, L3771), 0.1% bromophenol blue (IBI Scientific, 
IB74040) and 10% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, G5516)) and sonicated (Branson Sonifier, 250). 
Equal amount of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 
transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-rad, 162-0112) and immunoblotted with primary 
antibodies: Villin (Santa Cruz, sc7672), ZO-1 (Invitrogen, 33–9100) or β-actin (Sigma-
Aldrich, A1978) antibodies and visualized by ECL chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, 
32106). Membranes probed with more than one antibody were stripped before re-probing. 
Western blot bands were quantified using Image Lab 4.01 (Bio-Rad).
Immunofluorescence
Intestinal tissues were freshly isolated and paraffin-embedded after fixation with 10% 
neutral buffered formalin. Immunofluorescence was performed on paraffin-embedded 
sections (5 µm). After preparation of the slides as described previously10, tissue samples

 were incubated with anti-lysozyme (Santa Cruz, sc27958), ZO-1, or human SOD-17 at 4°C 
overnight. Samples were then incubated with sheep anti-goat Alexa Fluor 594 (Life 
Technologies, A11058), or goat anti-mouse Alexa Flour 488 (Life Technologies, A-11001) 
and DAPI (Life Technologies, D1306) for 1 h at room temperature. Tissues were mounted 
with SlowFade (Life Technologies, s2828), followed by a coverslip, and the edges were 
sealed to prevent drying. Specimens were examined with Zeiss laser scanning microscope 
(LSM) 710.
Fluorescence Permeability in vivo
Fluorescein Dextran (Molecular weight 3000 Da, diluted in Hanks) was gavaged (50 mg/g 
mouse). Four hours later, mouse blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture. 
Fluorescence intensity of the plasma was measured on a fluorescent plate reader, as 
previously described. 11, 12
Paneth cells counting
Paneth cells in mouse ileal cells were counted after anti-lysozyme immunofluorescence 
staining. The patterns of lysozyme expression in Paneth cells were classified into two 
categories: normal and abnormal which included disordered, depleted and diffuse according 
to published methods. 10, 13
HCT116 cell transfection and live cell imaging
The HCT116 cells were first transfected with the plasmids for fluorescent protein tagged 
human wild type SOD1-GFP or human ALS-causing mutation SOD1G93A-GFP. The 
HCT116 cells with SOD1G93A-GFP transfection were cultured with or without 2 mM 
Butyrate. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the live HCT116 cells were used for 
evaluating the protein aggregate formation under a confocal microscope (Leica SP8). Three 
independent sets of experiments were conducted. With GFP expression, the intracellular 
protein aggregates can be easily distinguished from the homogenous cytosolic expression. 
The percentage of cells with protein aggregates was counted in each experimental group.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from mouse ileal epithelial cells or cultured cells using TRIzol 
reagent (Life Technologies, 15596-02). RNA was first reverse-transcribed into cDNA with 
the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, 170–8891) according to the manufacturer’s 
manual. The RT-cDNA reaction products were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR using 
CTFX 96 Real-time system (Bio-Rad, C1000) and SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad, 172–
5124) according to the manufacturer’s directions. All expression levels were normalized to 
β-actin levels of the same sample. Percent expression was calculated as the ratio of the 
normalized value of each sample to that of the corresponding untreated control cells. All 
real-time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate. Primers were designed as described.10
Real-time PCR measurement of bacterial DNA
DNA was extracted as previously described10. 16S rDNA PCR reactions were performed 
with the following primers: Universal bacteria (forward: 5’-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA

transferase (forward: 5’-GCIGAICATTTCACITGGAAYWSITGGCAYATG-3’; reverse 5’-
CCTGCCTTTGCAATRTCIACRAANGC-3’) 14. The relative amount of 16S rDNA in each 
sample was estimated using the ΔΔCT.
Microbial sampling and sequencing
The tubes for microbial sampling were autoclaved and then irradiated with ultraviolet light 
to destroy the contaminating environmental bacterial DNA. The mice were then anesthetized 
and dissected. Fresh fecal and cecal stools were isolated from the gut and placed into the 
specially prepared tubes. The samples were kept at low temperature with dry ice and mailed 
to the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, Texas) for 454 pyrosequencing. The 
sequences were denoised and subjected to quality checks.
The V4-V6 region of the samples was amplified for pyrosequencing in the Research and 
Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX) using forward and reverse fusion primers. The forward 
primer was constructed (5’-3’) with the Roche A linker 
(CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG), an 8–10 bp barcode, and the 530F–
GTGCCAGCMGCNGCGG primer. The reverse fusion primer was constructed (5’-3’) with 
a biotin molecule, the Roche B linker (CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAG), 
and the 1100R-GGGTTNCGNTCGTTR primer. Amplifications were performed in 25 µl 
reaction volumes with Qiagen HotStar Taq master mix (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, California), 1 
µl of each primer (5 µM), and 1 µl of template. Reactions were performed on ABI Veriti 
thermocyclers (Applied Biosytems, Carlsbad, California) under the following thermal 
profile: 95 °C for 5 min, then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 sec, 54 °C for 40 sec, 72 °C for 1 
min, followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min and a 4 °C hold. The amplicons were 570 bp 
in length.
Amplification products were visualized with eGels (Life Technologies, Grand Island, New 
York). Products were then pooled to equimolar levels, and each pool was cleaned with 
Diffinity RapidTip (Diffinity Genomics, West Henrietta, New York) and size-selected using 
Agencourt AMPure XP (BeckmanCoulter, Indianapolis, Indiana) following the Roche 454 
protocols (454 Life Sciences, Branford, Connecticut). Size-selected pools were then 
quantified, and 150 ng of DNA was hybridized to Dynabeads M-270 (Life Technologies) to 
create single-stranded DNA following Roche 454 protocols (454 Life Sciences). Single-
stranded DNA was diluted and used in emPCR reactions, which were performed and 
subsequently enriched. Sequencing followed established manufacturer protocols (454 Life 
Sciences).
Bioinformatic analysis
16S rRNA detection, clustering and identification—Clustering of the reads with 4% 
divergence on the seed sequences was performed using USEARCH to identify similar 
clusters.15 Chimera checking was detected using the de novo method of UCHIIME.16 The

 sequences were then denoised according to a size criterion. For taxonomic identification, the 
sequences were clustered into OTUs with 0% divergence with USEARCH.15 The seed 
sequence was then queried against NCBI using a distributed .NET algorithm, which makes 
use of BLASTN+ (KrakenBLAST, www.krakenblast.com).
Taxonomic classification—Taxonomic identifications were assigned by queries against 
NCBI. Imputation of bacterial genomes was performed according to the similarity of 
sequenced genomes to reference GreenGenes sequences.17 Principal coordinates analysis 
(PCoA) of unweighted UniFrac distances plots were plotted using Quantitative Insights Into 
Microbial Ecology (QIIME)(http://qiime.sourceforge.net/).18
Statistical analysis
The data were expressed as the mean±SD. Differences between two samples were analyzed 
by Student’s t-test. Differences among three or more groups were analysed using ANOVA 
with GraphPad Prism 5. p Values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant.
Results
Feeding the ALS mice with butyrate delayed the ALS progression
There are early changes of intestinal microbiome before onset of ALS.6 In the current study, 
we developed a strategy to feed the ALS mice (starting at the age of 1 month old) with a 
natural bacterial product butyrate (2% butyrate in drinking water). As shown in Fig. 1A, 
control G93A mice showed weight loss (indication of the disease onset) at the age of 110 
days, while the butyrate treated G93A mice did not show weight loss until 150 days. 
Remarkably, feeding the ALS model mice with butyrate significantly prolonged the life span 
by 38 days on average (Fig. 1B). These data show that butyrate treatment can slow down 
ALS disease progression and prolong the life span of G93A mice.
Reduced population of butyrate-production bacteria and less butyryl-coenzyme A in ALS 
mice before the onset of diseases
We found that ALS G93A mice showed abnormal intestinal microbiome, in which butyrate-
producing bacteria (Butyrivibrio Fibrisolvens)19 were reduced (Fig. 2A). This change occurs 
in young ALS mice before disease onset. Butyrate synthesis by anaerobic bacteria can occur 
via butyryl-coenzyme A (CoA):acetate CoA-transferase.20 We also found that the level of 
CoA enzyme was significantly lower in the G93A mice without disease symptom, compared 
to those in the wild-type (WT) and transgenic G93A mice (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, oral 2% 
sodium butyrate treatment for 2.5 months significantly enhanced the abundance of butyrate-
producing bacteria Butyrivibrio Fibrisolvens (Fig. 2C). Firmicutes make up the largest 
portion of the mouse and human gut microbiome. 21 The division Firmicutes as part of the 
gut flora has been shown to be involved in energy resorption and obesity. 22–24 Fimicutes 
Peptostreptococus, which was low in ALS mice,6 was also enhanced after butyrate treatment 
(Fig. 2C). We found that butyrate treatment significantly restored the expression of the level 
of CoA enzyme (Fig. 2D).

 Butyrate treatment corrected dysbiosis in ALS mice
We then collected the fecal samples of ALS mice with or without butyrate for the 16S rDNA 
sequencing. We identified changes of gut microbial profile in ALS mice with butyrate 
treatment (Fig. 3A). The microbiome of ALS mice and butyrate treated ALS mice fell into 
different clusters on a PCoA scale (Fig. 3B). Specifically, we analyzed the OTU table 
generated by sequencing to identify the bacterial changes in taxonomic assignment. Genus 
level changes were analyzed to evaluate the effects of butyrate treatment on the taxonomic 
assignment of intestinal microbiota (Fig. 3C). We checked butyrate-producing bacteria 
(Butyrivibrio) and then found butyrate treatment significantly increased Butyrivibrio at 
genus level. This results further confirmed our previous data derived from RT-PCR. Butyrate 
treatment was able to significantly increase the abundance of other butyrate-producing 
bacteria including Bacteroide25, Odoribacter25 and Eubacterium19, 26. Interesting, Butyrate 
treatment also significantly depleted Tannerella27, which induced foam cell formation in 
THP-1 cells and accelerated the progression of atherosclerotic lesions.
At the species level, at the age of 3.5 months (1 month old G93A mice after butyrate 
treatment for 2.5 months), the ALS mice with butyrate treatment, significantly enriched 
Clostridium sp. and Ruminococcus sp (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data indicate that 
Butyrate treatment corrected dysbiosis and enhanced diversity of microbiome in ALS mice.
Correct abnormal intestinal tight junction structure in ALS mice with butyrate treatment
The intestinal barrier is maintained by tight junctions (TJ) formed between adjacent 
intestinal epithelial cells. We have discovered early changes of intestinal TJs in the G93A 
mice before onset of ALS.6 We further hypothesize that restoring intestinal homeostasis 
delays ALS disease onset and progression. We found that butyrate treatment for 2.5 months 
(started at the age of 1 month) significantly restored the expression of ZO-1 (a TJ-protein) in 
the G93A gut (Fig. 4A). We performed immunostaining of ZO-1 and observed the zipper-
like tight junction structure in the intestine of WT mice (yellow arrows), whereas TJ 
structure was damaged in the G93A intestinal epithelial cells (red arrows) (Fig. 4B). 
Butyrate treatment improved the TJ structure in the G93A gut (yellow arrows) (Fig. 4B-right 
panel). These data indicate butyrate treatment was able to correct abnormal intestinal tight 
junction structure in ALS mice.
Correct leaky gut in ALS mice with butyrate treatment
The intestinal permeability was assayed by gavaging mice with Fluorescein Dextran (50 
mg/g mouse). Four hours later, mouse blood samples were collected for fluorescence 
intensity of the plasma. The serum level of fluorescein is about 3-fold higher in G93A mice 
(Fig. 4C), indicating that G93A mice have gut leakage. The butyrate treatment significantly 
decreased intestinal permeability in the ALS mice (Fig. 4C). To examine the role of butyrate 
in altering intestinal permeability, we used a polarized human intestinal epithelial cell model 
in vitro. Our data further showed human HT29C19A cells had significantly higher trans-
epithelial resistant (TER) after butyrate treatment, indicating the role of butyrate in 
correcting leaky gut through enhancing intestinal epithelial function (Fig. 4D).

 Abnormal Paneth cells were decreased in the ALS mice treated by butyrate
Paneth cells are specialized intestinal epithelial cells associated with autophagy activity and 
regulate the host-bacterial interactions in gut.10, 13 We specifically notice the decreased 
normal Paneth cells (Fig. 5A), shown as number of Paneth cell per crypt (Fig. 5B). The 
percentage of abnormal Paneth cells was also significantly decreased in intestinal of ALS 
mice treated with butyrate, compared with the non-treated mice (Fig. 5C). The lysozyme 1 
and anti-microbial peptide defensin 5 alpha was also restored in the ALS intestine after 
butyrate treatment (Fig. 5D). These data indicate the restoration of Paneth cells in intestine 
of ALS mice with butyrate treatment.
Butyrate treatment decreased aggregation of SOD1 mutant protein in human intestinal 
epithelial cells
Aggregation of SOD1 mutant protein in motor neurons and skeletal muscle is a hallmark of 
ALS pathology.7–9 We first tested whether SOD1G93A also forms aggregates in the intestinal 
epithelial cells. The human intestinal epithelial cells (HCT116) were transfected with 
fluorescent protein tagged human wild type SOD1-GFP or human ALS mutation 
SOD1G93A-GFP. Remarkably, only SOD1G93A forms protein aggregates inside the intestine 
epithelial cells, while not a single cell transfected expressing wild type SOD1-GFP shows 
protein aggregates. The representative images are shown in Fig. 6A. We further examined 
whether butyrate treatment could reduce the protein aggregation of SOD1G93A in the 
HCT116 cells. Two groups of HCT116 cells were transfected with SOD1G93A-GFP, twenty-
four hours later, the group with 2 mM butyrate in the culture medium showed significant 
reduction in protein aggregate formation (Fig. 6B).
In vivo, we found enhanced protein aggregation of SOD1G93A in colon of the G93A mice, 
compared to that of WT mice (Fig. 6C and D). Butyrate treatment could significantly reduce 
the SOD1G93A aggregation in the intestine of ALS mice (Fig. 6E and F).
Discussion
In the current study, we reported that aberrant microbiome and lost intestinal homeostasis is 
associated with ALS pathophysiology in the mouse model. Restoring microbiome and 
intestinal homeostasis using bacterial product butyrate preserves neuromuscular function, 
thus delaying disease onset and progression. Our study provides the first evidence of gut 
dysfunction and microbiome as an important component in ALS disease progression. Most 
importantly, our study opens a new door to develop novel strategies to attenuate the 
phenotype of ALS and delay the disease.
Butyrate is produced by microbes through fermentation in the colon. It is considered a major 
source of energy for colonocytes through assimilation in TCA cycle, and as an HDAC 
(histone deacetylase) inhibitor28. Donohoe et al. 29 showed that the function of butyrate goes 
beyond simple metabolism. Butyrate could rescue deficit in mitochondrial respiration and 
diminished oxidative metabolism in germ-free colonocytes. The mechanism is due to 
butyrate acting as an energy source rather than as an HDAC inhibitor. In fact, butyrate 
enema therapy has been shown to restore intestinal homeostasis and ameliorate the

 inflammation associated with colitis in mouse models and in human clinical trials.30, 31 
Butyrate belongs to short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which modulates the physiology of the 
host through binding G protein-coupled receptors.32 In addition to its local beneficial 
functions in intestine, butyrate enters the bloodstream via colonic absorption.33–35 
Adiposity,32 T cell differentiation,36 and inflammatory responses37 are modulated by 
SCFAs. It is possible that increasing butyrate or other SCFA levels help reverse 
pathophysiological changes in various human diseases, including ALS.
Our study with oral administration of butyrate as a natural bacterial product to effectively 
restore microbial and intestinal homeostasis presents a different and better therapeutic 
strategy, as evidenced by the prolonged life span by 38 days on average in the butyrate 
treated ALS mice. As a pharmacological reagent and a butyrate derivative, phenylbutyrate 
(400mg/kg), extends the survival of G93A mice for 29 days.38 Phenylbutyrate has been in 
Phase 2 clinical trial for ALS.39 Phenylbutyrate was safe and tolerable when it was used for 
20 weeks under the dosage of 9–21g/day in ALS patients. However, the original study in 
G93A mice showed that 400 mg/kg/day was the optimal dosage to obtain the maximum 29 
days extension of survival, while a little higher dosage is toxic to the mice. G93A mice 
treated with 600–800mg/kg/day of phenylbutyrate became ill and died earlier than untreated 
G93A mice.38 Phenylbutyrate has been tested in ALS mice through intraperitoneal injection 
in previous reports under the mechanism of inhibition of histone deacetylase activity 
(HDAC).38 It is likely that the primary effect of oral butyrate application is to improve the 
gut defects in ALS mice rather than via HDAC inhibition.
The exact role of butyrate on intestinal and microbial function in ALS has not been 
examined previously. It is very well known that the ALS-causing SOD1 mutation leads to 
protein aggregate formation in neuron and skeletal muscle cells.40 However, it has never 
been tested whether the ALS-causing SOD1 mutation causes similar pathological phenotype 
in the intestine. We, for the first time, demonstrated that SOD1G93A mutant protein indeed 
forms aggregates in the intestine of ALS mice and human intestinal epithelial cells, 
suggesting that SOD1G93A plays an essential role in pathophysiological alterations in the 
intestine. Moreover, the percentage of abnormal Paneth cells was significantly decreased in 
the intestine of ALS mice treated with butyrate. The lysozyme 1 and anti-microbial peptide 
defensin 5 alpha was also restored in the ALS intestine after butyrate treatment. The 
pathological changes likely mirrors population shifts in the microbiome in G93A mice. 
Remarkably, the dysfunction of microbiome and intestinal homeostasis in the G93A mice 
were restored by oral application of butyrate.
We recognize that butyrate treatment is not a cure of the genetic defect in ALS G93A mice, 
rather to improve and slow down the pathological progression in the intestine that plays an 
important role in maintaining physiological integrity of the whole body. In addition, current 
literature supports the role of butyrate in regulating metabolic function of mitochondria. It is 
possible that butyrate improves the mitochondrial function in general in ALS mice.29, 41–44 
Thus, the treatment delays the degeneration of neuromuscular system until the genetic defect 
overrides the beneficial role of butyrate. Butyrate is a hydrophobic molecule and may be 
orally absorbed and distributed systemically. It is an energy substrate within various cells48. 
Thus, butyrate may have a direct effect on neuron functions. Our current study highlights the

 complex role of gut microbiome and intestinal epithelium in the progression of ALS and 
presents butyrate as a potential therapeutic reagent to restore ALS dysbiosis. Understanding 
the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the direct beneficial effects of butyrate and gut 
microbiome on the neuromuscular system is beyond the scope of the current study, which is 
an undergoing study in our research team.
The early GI problems in ALS patients before they show neurodegenerative symptoms have 
been largely ignored. It is reported that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was increased in the 
serum of ALS patients.45 In ALS patients, constipation is common and presumed 
multifactorial - related to dehydration, lack of dietary fiber intake, and decreased physical 
activity.46 However, we lack research on the early GI issue from ALS patients. ALS is a 
systemic disorder that involves dysfunction of multiple organs.47 We believe that ALS-
associated mutations not only cause defects in neuron, muscle and skeletal systems, but also 
in intestine and microbiome. A key question is whether and how the intestinal integrity and 
microbiome is altered in ALS patients before the onset of symptoms. ALS patients do not go 
to the clinic until the symptoms occur. It is hard to collect intestinal biopsies from ALS 
patients. Thus, further mechanistic studies need to be conducted using ALS animal models.
Our observations allow us to propose a working model of microbial and intestinal 
homeostasis that may contribute to the neuromuscular dysfunction in ALS (Fig. 7). ALS-
linked SOD1G93A mutation causes intestinal dysfunction and aberrant microbiome as part of 
the ALS pathology. Targeting the crosstalk between gut and neuromuscular systems corrects 
the dysbiosis and restores the intestinal tight junctions, Paneth cells, and beneficial bacteria, 
thus prolonging the life span of ALS mice. It represents a novel means for preserving the 
integrative physiology in ALS. Our findings demonstrated that gut microbiome may play 
essential roles in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of diseases in distant organs. It 
brings novel concepts to the ALS research field and has significant translational implications 
for identifying new biomarkers for ALS diagnosis and developing new therapeutic strategies 
to combat this devastating disease.
