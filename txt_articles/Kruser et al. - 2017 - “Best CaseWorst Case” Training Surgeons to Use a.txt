Abstract
Context. Older adults often have surgery in the months preceding death, which can initiate postoperative treatments
inconsistent with end-of-life values. ‘‘Best Case/Worst Case’’ (BC/WC) is a communication tool designed to promote goal-
concordant care during discussions about high-risk surgery.
Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate a structured training program designed to teach surgeons how to use
BC/WC.
Methods. Twenty-five surgeons from one tertiary care hospital completed a two-hour training session followed by individual
coaching. We audio-recorded surgeons using BC/WC with standardized patients and 20 hospitalized patients. Hospitalized
patients and their families participated in an open-ended interview 30 to 120 days after enrollment. We used a checklist of 11
BC/WC elements to measure tool fidelity and surgeons completed the Practitioner Opinion Survey to measure acceptability
of the tool. We used qualitative analysis to evaluate variability in tool content and to characterize patient and family
perceptions of the tool.
Results. Surgeons completed a median of 10 of 11 BC/WC elements with both standardized and hospitalized patients
(range 5e11). We found moderate variability in presentation of treatment options and description of outcomes. Three
months after training, 79% of surgeons reported BC/WC is better than their usual approach and 71% endorsed active use of
BC/WC in clinical practice. Patients and families found that BC/WC established expectations, provided clarity, and facilitated
deliberation.
Conclusions. Surgeons can learn to use BC/WC with older patients considering acute high-risk surgical interventions.
Surgeons, patients, and family members endorse BC/WC as a strategy to support complex decision making.

Background
Older adults often undergo surgery in the months
preceding death, which can lead to postoperative
intensive care unit (ICU) admission and prolonged
periods of recovery with progressive decline in func-
tional status.1e6 Yet, most older people prefer care
focused on the relief of symptoms rather than aggres-
sive treatments including ICU care and hospitalization

 near the end of life.7e9 Despite widespread preference
for symptom-focused care, the use of ICU services
before death has increased over time.1,2 Preoperative
communication between surgeons and frail older pa-
tients who face a decision about high-risk surgery is
a modifiable contributor to the use of treatments
that are discordant with patient preferences.10e14
Efforts
to
improve
communication
during
the
decision-making process could decrease unwanted
burdensome treatments near the end of life.
For patients who develop life-threatening surgical
conditions, preoperative decision making is complex.
Given the life-altering consequences and substantial
prognostic uncertainty, the ‘‘right’’ decision can only
be reached by exploring each individual patient’s
goals and values. Efforts to improve preference-
sensitive medical decisions have focused on the
concept of shared decision making and the develop-
ment of disease-specific decision aids.15 Although de-
cision aids can improve decision making for many
medical choices,16 they are not applicable or available
for in-the-moment treatment decisions for patients
who face acute life-threatening illness.
To improve complex surgical decision making for
older adults, we developed a novel communication
tool called ‘‘Best Case/Worst Case’’ (BC/WC).13 Build-
ing on an established conceptual model of shared de-
cision making17 and feedback from seniors and
surgeons,18 we designed the BC/WC tool for in-the-
moment, acute surgical decisions. Essential tool ele-
ments include depiction of two or more treatment
choices, creation of a pen-and-paper graphic aid, use
of narrative to tell a story about how the patient might
experience the outcomes in the best and worst case
scenarios, estimation about the most likely outcome,
description of how the treatment option affects the
larger context of the patient’s overall health, and
providing a treatment recommendation at the conclu-
sion of the discussion. During the conversation, the
surgeon uses narrative to describe the best and worst
possible outcomes of each treatment option and cre-
ates a graphic aid to illustrate the range and estimated
probability of each outcome to leave with the patient
and family for future deliberation (Fig. 1).13 In focus
groups, seniors and surgeons praised the tool for de-
picting
‘‘both

of
the
story’’

 establishing that the patient has a choice between two
treatment
options.18
Seniors
endorsed
BC/WC
because it provides an opportunity for patients to
consider and incorporate personal values and goals
when making a complex medical decision.18
Whether surgeons can learn to use this tool for
routine clinical practice is unknown. We designed a
single-center
pilot
study
to
evaluate
a
two-hour
training program designed to teach surgeons to use
BC/WC in a clinical setting. The aims of this study
were to demonstrate feasibility of surgeon training,
evaluate fidelity and variability in the use of BC/WC
by surgeons, and assess the acceptability and percep-
tions of the BC/WC communication tool among sur-
geons, patients, and families.
Methods
Training Program Design
To accommodate the needs of adult learners, we
modeled our training session on Kolb’s cycle of experi-
ential learning,19 which requires learning new skills
through practice. After an educational experience,
learners benefit from time for reflection to formulate a
conceptual understanding about what occurred. The
learner can use this information to plan for the next
experience, modifying behavior to move toward a speci-
fied goal. We also adapted Ericsson’s work in deliberate
practice and individual coaching framework,20 to pro-
vide ongoing challenge through an expert coach to
ensure steady progression to expertise. We developed a
two-hour training session to provide experience, fol-
lowed by explicit time for reflection with a coach, and a
repeat experience to apply newly learned skills. Our
coaches were experts in the fields of palliative care,
patient-physician communication, and adult education.
Study Design and Participants
We invited all attending surgeons who practice
acute care general, cardiothoracic, or vascular surgery
at the University of Wisconsin to participate. Each
enrolled surgeon completed a two-hour training ses-
sion scheduled at his/her convenience. Training
included a 15-minute lecture highlighting the essen-
tial tool elements followed by demonstration with a
standardized patient. After the didactic component,
each surgeon practiced using the BC/WC tool with
two standardized patients in two different specialty-
specific simulated cases (Supplementary Materials 1).
A coach observed each case and provided real-time,
one-on-one feedback to the surgeon throughout and
on completion of the first conversation. The surgeon
then used BC/WC in a second case without interrup-
tion; we audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim
this conversation and collected all graphic aids.
Within two months of the training session, coaches
met with surgeons individually to address questions
and encourage utilization.
To measure surgeon’s ability to use the tool in a clin-
ical setting, we screened hospitalized patients cared
for by trained surgeons. We contacted the patient’s
surgeon before enrollment to ensure the surgeon
was offering a choice between at least two treatment
options. We included patients 65 years of age and old-
er facing a decision between an operation and a less
invasive alternative (e.g., minor surgery, medical man-
agement or supportive/palliative care) who were at
high risk for surgical complications. To determine
high risk, we screened patients for multimorbidity
and confirmed with the treating team that the patient
was frail, based on a composite clinical assessment
including reduced functional status, recent falls, and
weight loss. We included patients without decision-
making capacity if a surrogate was present to partici-
pate. We excluded patients and surrogates who did
not speak English or had severe hearing impairment.
We audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim the
decision-making conversation between the surgeon
and the patient and retained a copy of the graphic
aid. The University of Wisconsin Health Sciences Insti-
tutional Review Board approved this protocol.
Measurement of BC/WC Fidelity
To evaluate surgeons’ use and fidelity to the BC/WC
tool, we scored transcripts of the final standardized pa-
tient conversations and each inpatient conversation
based on 11 tool elements (Supplementary Materials
2). Two reviewers (J. K., L. T.) used an 11-point check-
list to independently score each transcript and the
associated
graphic
aid,
assigning
one
point
per
element performed by the surgeon. Cohen’s kappa co-
efficient was 0.74, demonstrating substantial inter-
rater agreement.21 To equally weigh each reviewer’s
assessment, we averaged the two total scores and pre-
sent this as final score for each conversation.
Analysis of Content Variability
BC/WC is a framework that structures the conversa-
tion between surgeon and patient and requires the use
of narrative to describe outcomes. As such, the con-
tent of the decision-making conversation is dependent
on the surgeon’s interpretation of the relevant evi-
dence within the context of the patients’ overall
health. We sought to measure the variability of clinical
information presented to standardized patients when
different surgeons were faced with the same hypothet-
ical scenario. To evaluate variability between surgeons,
four investigators (J. K., L.T., J.T., M.S.) independently
reviewed the transcripts and graphic aids for 13 BC/
WC standardized patient conversations (nine general
surgeons describing treatment of an anastomotic
leak and four vascular surgeons discussing treatment

 of limb ischemia with gangrene). We used inductive
qualitative analysis22 to identify key domains of vari-
ability within the clinical content presented by the sur-
geons. We then used comparative qualitative analysis22
to evaluate and describe variability between surgeons
facing identical, simulated clinical scenarios.
Surgeon Evaluation of BC/WC
We administered a measure of decision aid accept-
ability to each surgeon participant at three and
six months after the training session. We used a modi-
fied version of the Practitioner Opinion Survey23 to
determine if surgeons were actively using BC/WC in
clinical practice and to measure surgeons’ perceptions
of time required for BC/WC use, ease of use, and
benefit of BC/WC compared with usual care. We
used descriptive statistics to summarize survey results
and the Student t-test to compare responses between
three and six months, and we defined a two-tailed P-
value <0.05 as statistically significant.
Patient and Family Evaluation of BC/WC
We contacted all enrolled, hospitalized patients or
family members between 30 and 120 days after the
BC/WC decision-making conversation to participate
in an open-ended face-to-face interview. We scheduled
interviews at least 30 days after the BC/WC decision-
making conversation to account for the prolonged hos-
pitalization and recovery that older, frail patients with
serious illness typically face and to respect the families
of patients who died. To limit problems with recall, we
conducted all interviews no more than 120 days after
the BC/WC conversation. The interview guide was
developed and iteratively revised by the multidisci-
plinary team of study investigators. The open-ended
questions were designed to elicit patient or surrogate
perspectives
about
the
decision-making
process,
whether the treatment decision was concordant with
the patient’s values, the impact of best- and worst-case
language and the graphic aid, and the acceptability of
study participation. We audio-recorded and transcribed
these conversations verbatim and used inductive quali-
tative analysis to characterize patients’ and families’
perceptions of BC/WC.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Twenty-five surgeons attended a training session.
Twenty-nine of 30 eligible surgeons enrolled in the
study, but four (14%) were unable to attend a training
session due to schedule conflicts (Fig. 2). One sur-
geon left the training session early due to a clinical
conflict and did not complete the final evaluation
simulated case. Seven surgeons (28%) rescheduled
the training session at least once (one to four
rescheduled sessions). Surgeon and patient character-
istics are described in Table 1. Surgeons were predom-
inantly men (84%) and had been in practice for a
median of nine years. After completing training, 19
surgeons (76%) participated in one individualized
follow-up meeting with a coach. We were able to enroll
at least one patient for 12 of the trained surgeons. The
range of hospitalized patients enrolled per trained sur-
geon was 0e3. Sixty-five percent of patients were
women. Patients had a range of acute surgical prob-
lems; bowel obstruction was the most common condi-
tion (35%). Follow-up interviews with patients or
family members took place a median of 90 days after
the BC/WC decision-making conversation.
BC/WC Tool Fidelity
During training, surgeons completed a median 10 of
11 tool elements (range 5e11) in the second simulated
case. All surgeons presented two distinct treatment op-
tions and successfully described the best and worst cases
for each treatment. The BC/WC element surgeons most
commonly omitted in simulation was ‘‘make a recom-
mendation’’ fora specific treatment optionafterlearning
the patient’s preferences, which surgeons performed in
only 55% of training conversations. When using BC/
WC in clinical practice with hospitalized older adults,
trained surgeons continued to achieve a median of 10
of 11 tool elements (range 7e11). Surgeons presented
both a best and worst case for two distinct treatment op-
tions in 92% of conversations with hospitalized patients
yet failed to make a clear treatment recommendation
in 61% of conversations (Supplementary Table 1).
When presented with the same simulated clinical case,
surgeons used similar narratives to describe the best- and
worst-case outcomes for each treatment option. For the
‘‘worst-case’’ scenario of operative intervention during
simulated cases, almost every surgeon discussed the
risk of ICU admission and use of life support preceding
death. When explaining the ‘‘best case’’ and ‘‘worst case’’
of nonsurgical supportive care, one surgeon said:
The best case is he would die but he’d live a few weeks
at home. We wouldn’t do any of those procedures on
him. There would be no risk of that. I think we’d be
able to keep him comfortable [.]. And the worst
case is that this infection, this, we can’t suppress it,
and he dies more quickly. He dies in a matter of days.
We certainly can keep him comfortable, but if he never
recovers enough to be conscious to speak to, I think
that might be the worst case that you would see.
Another surgeon discussing nonsurgical supportive
care with the same simulated patient described very
similar best and worst cases:
[.] we can make him pain free, and he may come
home, and he may at least have, you know a lot
714
Vol. 53 No. 4 April 2017
Kruser et al.
 more days where he can spend with his family, and
have his good byes [.]. the worst case scenario [is]
that things may progress quickly, and he may die
from this, you know, within a few days.
However, many surgeons struggled to provide an
explicit
treatment
recommendation,
an
essential
element of BC/WC. These surgeons resisted coaching
during this component of the simulated cases, stating:
But I usually don’t like to make my recommendation
because [.] I think if a physician makes a recom-
mendation [.] I feel it’s kind of manipulating
because so I feel my job is to provide all the accurate
information, [.] then I think the decision, yes or no,
needs to be made by the patient and family.
Another surgeon expressed a similar concern, ‘‘I
never like to tell anyone what they should do. I can
tell them what I can do, and what the outcomes
from that can be, but I never want to, I want them
to make this, [.] it’s their choice.’’ This was not a
stumbling point for all surgeons. Here a different sur-
geon spontaneously provided a preference-sensitive
recommendation in simulation:
So while I can’t ultimately make the decision for
you, I can certainly try to help you through it, and
perhaps give you my thoughts on this [. . . .] I think
the problem here, as I see it, is if her ultimate goal
would be to live independent, and we really can’t
achieve that, then perhaps the kindest thing to do
might be just to help her onto the next stage of
life comfortably. And just sort of keep her comfort-
able, and let her die with her dignity.
Content Variability
We identified two major domains of variability be-
tween surgeons using BC/WC for the same hypothet-
ical patient: the technical strategy for treatment and
the style of narrative detail. Surgeons offered a range
of treatment options when faced with an identical, hy-
pothetical case. For the same 75-year-old patient with
new-onset limb ischemia and gangrene with a history
of stroke who was dependent on his daughter for all
activities of daily living, we identified three distinct sur-
gical options and two distinct nonsurgical options
offered by four vascular surgeons. Surgeons offered
below-knee amputation, above-knee amputation, or
vascular bypass with toe amputation. Surgeons offered
two different nonsurgical options: either supportive
medical care with antibiotics and pain medication or
supportive medical care focusing on comfort alone.
We observed more consistency among general sur-
geons caring for a hypothetical, frail 82-year-old
woman with heart failure who developed a small intes-
tine anastomotic leak. Nine general surgeons offered
one of two distinct surgical options (abdominal
drainage or fistula repair). All but one surgeon
offered the same nonsurgical option: ICU admission,
Fig. 2. Enrollment and study completion of surgeons and hospitalized patients.

715
Training Surgeons to Use BC/WC
 wound care, and parenteral nutrition. One outlier
offered comfort-focused care without ICU admission.
We also identified variability in the details surgeons
chose to describe clinical outcomes. Some surgeons
focused on specific medical and technical elements
for each possible scenario; they described ICU admis-
sion, mechanical ventilation, wound care, nutrition,
and antibiotics. For example, one surgeon described
a best case scenario with technical details by saying,
‘‘we would control the output of her intestines to
that fistula with wound care, which would require a
plastic bag and pieces, and it would have to be
changed.’’ In contrast, other surgeons emphasized
patient-focused outcomes including the ability to eat
or drink, return home, interact with family, or control
pain. One surgeon described the best case by saying,
‘‘she still probably wouldn’t be able to eat or drink.
She would still probably be in a long-term care facility
[ . . . .] and still, probably because of all of her other
medical problems and issues, probably dying from
this within a couple of months.’’
Surgeon Evaluation of BC/WC
Twenty-four (96%) of the trained surgeons completed
the Practitioner Opinion Survey at three and six months.
Three months after training, 96% of surgeons respon-
dents reported that BC/WC is easy to use, 79% felt that
the BC/WC tool is better than their usual approach for
helping patients make decisions, and 71% reported
actively using BC/WC in clinical practice outside the
scope of the research study. However, only 38% of sur-
geons believed BC/WC saved time (Fig. 3). Surgeon re-
sponses were sustained at six months.
Patient and Family Evaluation of BC/WC
We identified three important functions of the BC/
WC framework during patient and family follow-up in-
terviews (Table 2). First, patients and families reported
that surgeons who used BC/WC clearly defined treat-
ment choices and encouraged comparison between
the two treatments. Second, by showing the range of
possible outcomes, surgeons established expectations
and helped patients and families prepare for possible
adverse events. Finally, patients and families valued
the graphic aid as a tangible reference to facilitate
future deliberation and inform family members who
were not present for the discussion. Several patients
and family members had saved the graphic aid months
after hospitalization and reproduced the diagram at
the follow-up interview without prompting.
Discussion
Surgeons can learn to use BC/WC with high fidelity
in clinical practice after completing a two-hour struc-
tured training and individualized coaching program.
In addition, surgeons found that BC/WC is easy to
use and is an improvement on usual care; most trained
surgeons reported adopting BC/WC into their clinical
practice. After a decision-making conversation with
trained surgeons, patients and their family members
praised their surgeon for providing clarity about treat-
ment options and establishing expectations. Although
surgeons can readily learn and adopt the framework
of BC/WC to present similar outcome narratives to pa-
tients and families, we identified modest variability in
treatment choices and narrative details between indi-
vidual surgeons. It is notable that surgeons reported
discomfort providing a specific treatment recommen-
dation as it conflicted with their understanding about
how to support patient autonomy. This was reflected
in their clinical use of the tool as less than half provided
a treatment recommendation for hospitalized patients.
We have previously shown that seniors and surgeons
approve of BC/WC in a hypothetical setting,18 and
this study demonstrates the feasibility and accept-
ability of implementing BC/WC into clinical practice
with a structured training program for academic sur-
geons. Furthermore, BC/WC is valued and embraced
by surgeons, a crucial component of sustainable adop-
tion.

 reproducible elements based on seminal theories of
adult education,19,20 we posit these methods can be
applied on a larger scale to facilitate widespread,
high-fidelity implementation of BC/WC.
We did observe variability between surgeons in our
study as several surgeons offered different treatment
options for the same simulated clinical case. Despite
the variability in treatment approach, the narratives
surgeons used to describe outcomes remained similar,
suggesting a general consensus from surgeons about
treatment outcomes even with different surgical inter-
ventions. This variation is similar to variation currently
observed in clinical practice. Surgeons often vary
widely in their quantitative risk assessment24 or judg-
ment about surgical indications,25 yet striving to pro-
vide
precise,
numerical
risk
estimation
may
be
unnecessary or even misleading to patients.26 Further-
more, in high-risk clinical scenarios, precise risk pre-
dictions and high-quality evidence are often lacking
or difficult to extrapolate.26 Instead of reliance on
risk prediction, BC/WC uses an alternate strategy,
providing a framework for patients and families that
describes composite estimates about what is likely to
happen and creating boundaries around what is
possible. Patients and families in our study used BC/
WC to visualize and prepare for treatment outcomes,
suggesting their communication needs were met by
the BC/WC strategy.
The BC/WC element most frequently omitted by
surgeons was ‘‘provide a treatment recommendation.’’
During standardized patient sessions, several surgeons
explained
their
rationale;
they
believed
their
recommendation would violate patient autonomy.
The misperception that physician recommendations
compromise patient autonomy is not novel and is
well described.27,28 Yet, consistent with the goals of
shared decision making, the BC/WC tool includes a
physician recommendation that integrates patient
preferences with the relevant therapeutic possibilities.
This strategy is designed to respect and enhance, not
violate, patient autonomy.27 Although some surgeons
easily incorporated patient preferences into treatment
recommendations, our two-hour training session was
not able to overcome deep-rooted cultural notions
that many attending surgeons have about autonomy
and surgical decision making. We have targeted this
issue as we make improvements to our training pro-
gram, but we suspect this will be a difficult challenge
to overcome given current practice patterns and wide-
spread physician beliefs.29
Our findings are important for physicians and re-
searchers who aim to improve shared decision mak-
ing
for
other
high-stakes,
complex
medical
decisions beyond surgery. BC/WC is distinct from
typical decision aids that provide standardized con-
tent and numeric representation of risks16,30 because
it allows physicians to personalize the tool to accom-
modate the relevant clinical features of each pa-
tient’s decision. In addition, BC/WC requires only
pen and paper, so it is readily available for acute clin-
ical scenarios and face-to-face conversations between
patients, families and physicians. The surgeons in
this study found BC/WC easy to use, and the flexi-
bility and accessibility of BC/WC may overcome

Training Surgeons to Use BC/WC
 barriers to routine decision aid use for other physi-
cians from different specialties such as critical care
medicine, palliative care, and oncology who often
treat patients with similar levels of complexity and
acuity.
This study has several important limitations. We
relied on local experts to conduct the didactic sessions
and one-on-one coaching, which is resource intensive.
In addition, surgeons canceled and rescheduled mul-
tiple training and coaching sessions due to patient
care and operating room conflicts, highlighting the
burdens of a structured training curriculum for busy
clinicians. To address these barriers, we have devel-
oped an instructional video (https://www.youtube.
com/watch?v¼FnS3K44sbu0) linked to a training pro-
gram to improve the scalability of this intervention.
Future evaluation of a revised, lower-resource imple-
mentation package is required to determine its effect.
Given the challenges of conducting clinical research
with frail, hospitalized older patients were only able
to enroll hospitalized patients for 12 of the 25 trained
surgeons, and so our findings may not reflect the
range of surgeon practice after BC/WC training.
Lastly, patient and family interviews were held between
30 and 120 days after the BC/WC intervention to facil-
itate collection of perspectives that incorporated
longer term patient outcomes and to respect the fam-
ilies of patients who died. However, the delay between
the use of the BC/WC tool during a decision-making
conversation and the interview may have affected the
accuracy or completeness of the patients’ and families’
recall of events.
Conclusions
Academic surgeons can use the BC/WC communi-
cation tool in clinical practice with high fidelity after
completing a structured training program. Surgeons,
patients, and family members endorse the BC/WC
tool as a method to support complex decision making,
but further investigation is required to determine the
effect of BC/WC on clinical outcomes.

‘‘I could ask specific questions if I did not understand, there was not any vocabulary on
here that was unknown to me . It just, it focused my attention on what the clear
choices were.’’
‘‘I just thought it was a great diagram and a great way to show people [.] some things
you’re faced with. And this is the best case, and this is the worst case .’’
� Establishes expectations
B Demonstrates a range of outcomes
B Allows preparation for adverse events
‘‘Allowing anyone to see a big picture of something, best case, worst case, um, no
guarantees in the middle, um, helps people make important decisions. Also prepare
them in case the worst case happens.’’
‘‘I was not surprised. I knew what the choices were, I knew why they would do this [.].
I think it even says something about, you know, death. I mean that’s there. I knew
that. So that was not a surprise to me.’’
� Graphic aid facilitates deliberation
B Provides reference for future questions
B Can be used to facilitate deliberation or
explanation with family and loved ones
‘‘I think it greatly affected the way we discussed it, because, you know, it’s just spelled
out. I do not think there’s any other information [.] that would have helped [.].
And I looked at it again. I still have it.’’
‘‘It helped to have it on paper in front of you. It helped a lot. [.] This is the first time
I’ve ever seen it on paper. And you forget a lot what they say, you do not remember
everything, but with this on paper, you can go back and look at it.’’
‘‘I just found that to be a tremendous help. And then I could share with my siblings too
so that we would get together, over at my dad’s and showed this to him, he would
kinda remember, but then he would not remember, but then when he saw the
diagram, and he would look at it again, it helped him.’’

onset of severe, abdominal pain radiating into her back this morning (about six hours before evaluation). She is
independent in her daily activities.
Medical history: Hypertension, chronic kidney disease Stage 3, peptic ulcer disease, abdominal aortic aneu-
rysm, no previous surgeries.
Physical exam: Blood pressure 115/86, pulse 73, respiratory rate: 18.
Alert, awake, conversant.
Abdomendsoft, mildly tender.
Sodiumd126, potassiumd3.2, blood urea nitrogend27, creatinined2.7, hematocritd31.
CT scan: 7.9 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm with aneurysmal dilatation involving the visceral segment which is
dilated to 4 cm confluent through to the infrarenal neck, no evidence for rupture; comparison CT: 18 months
before AAA was w4.8 cm.
Physician instructions: You are about to meet with Mrs. Rodgers to discuss treatment options. You have met her
in clinic previously. Your fellow has already given her the news about her CT scan results and the fact that you
were going to speak with her regarding treatment options soon. The focus of this conversation should be on dis-
cussing treatment options and the decision-making process.
Vascular Case # 2: Limb Ischemia and Gangrene
Mr. Starr is a 75-year-old man with critical limb ischemia and wet gangrene on left D1-5. Previous below knee
amputation on right leg, left-sided hemiparesis from cerebrovascular accident, current smoker, lives at home with
his daughter, but is fully dependent on her for all activities of daily living currently. Developed waxing and waning
delirium in hospital.
Physical exam: Elderly man, frail appearing, alert but not oriented.
Large, tender left D1 ulceration with smaller ulcerations between each toe, malodorous, has only palpable
femoral pulse.
CT scan: Long-segment occlusion from distal superficial femoral artery to peroneal artery as the only runoff.
Previous hospital course: Revascularization attempted percutaneously, unsuccessful, no other endovascular op-
tions, vein mapping shows adequate vein for bypass.
Physician instructions: You are about to meet with Mr. Starr’s daughter to discuss treatment options, given she
is his designated health care power of attorney and he has altered mental status. You have met with her daily since
her father’s admission. Your team has already given her the news about her father’s CT scan results and told her
that you were going to speak with her regarding possible treatments. The focus of this conversation should be on
discussing treatment options and the decision-making process.
General Surgery Case #1: Small Bowel Obstruction
Mrs. Rodgers is an 83-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities including previous stroke, pulmonary em-
bolism six months ago on warfarin, and S/P coronary artery bypass grafting five years ago. Lives at retirement
home and somewhat dependent on family and visiting nurses because of weakness related to stroke.
She underwent left hemicolectomy for ischemic colitis eight years ago and then developed a large midline inci-
sional hernia, which was repaired with mesh two years ago. Two days ago, she presented with nausea and abdom-
inal pain at a recurrent ventral hernia site and was found to have partial small bowel obstruction with a transition
point at the hernia on CT scan.
She has had conservative management of small bowel obstruction for three to four days without return of
bowel function.
Examination: Distended, hernia larger than usual per patient, not reducible, tender around hernia site. Heart
rate: 80, blood pressure: 145/60.
White blood cell count: 11.5.

Kruser et al.
 Physician instructions: You are about to meet with Mrs. Rodgers to discuss treatment options. You have met
with her daily since her admission. Your team has already given her the news that her bowel function is not
improving and that you were going to speak with her regarding possible treatments. The focus of this conversa-
tion should be on the treatment options and the decision-making process.
General Surgery Case #2: Gastro-ileal Fistula Repair
Mrs. Starr is an 82-year-old woman who is postoperative Day #3 after ex lap reduction of midgut volvulus and
primary repair of gastro-ileal fistula who developed bilious output from her wound early this morning.
MedHx: New York Heart Association Class III heart failure with ejection fraction of 30%, osteoporosis, recently
discharged from a skilled nursing facility where she recovered from a recent laparoscopic graham patch, uses a
walker, and wheelchair to get around but has lost a lot of her functional ability over the past three months.
PSurgHx: Open right hemicolectomy (eight years before) for cecal volvulus and laparoscopic graham patch for
prepyloric peptic ulcer disease (four months before) complicated by wound infection and severe esophagitis/
gastrointestinal bleed requiring blood transfusion.
Physical exam: Intubated/sedated, minimal abdominal tenderness, frank bile from wound, normotensive,
heart rate 86.
Physician instructions: You are about to meet with Mrs. Starr’s daughter to discuss treatment options, given she
is her designated health care power of attorney, and she has altered mental status. You have met with her daily
since her mother’s admission. Your team has already given her the news about this complication and told her that
you were going to speak with her regarding possible treatments. The focus of this conversation should be on dis-
cussing treatment options and the decision-making process.
Thoracic Case #1: Hiatal Hernia
Mrs. Starr is an 83-year-old woman with moderate-severe dementia who presented to the hospital today with
about one month of intermittent vomiting and now with incomplete food intolerance over the last 24 hours ac-
cording to her sister. No known medical history aside from moderate-severe dementia, her sister reports that she
‘‘does not see doctors.’’
Patient is awake and states she has no pain, her abdomen is soft, and nontender.
CT scan shows massive Type IV hiatal hernia with entire stomach and transverse colon hernia into mediastinum
and right chest.
An NG tube was placed under fluoroscopy with adequate reduction of stomach, you are consulted for laparo-
scopic reduction of hernia.
Physician instructions: You are about to meet with Mrs. Starr’s husband, Mr. Starr, to discuss treatment options
(he is her designated health care power of attorney and the patient cannot make decisions on her own). You have
met with her husband this morning briefly, but he asked to delay the conversation until this afternoon. Your team
has already given him the news about the hiatal hernia and the role in his wife’s inability to eat. They told him
that you were going to speak with him regarding possible treatments. The focus of this conversation should be on
discussing treatment options and the decision-making process.
Thoracic Case #2: Esophageal Perforation
Mrs. White is a 79-year-old woman with severe vomiting and retching and now several hours of severe chest
pain. Esophageal perforation seen on esophagram. She lives in a skilled nursing facility, she is cognitively intact,
but needs help with nearly all activities of daily living.
PMedHx: HTN, gastroparesis from diabetes mellitus Type II, morbid obesity, previous pulmonary embolism,
on warfarin.
Physical exam: Intubated/sedated, blood pressure 82/48 on norepinephrine and vasopressin, pulse 122,
SpO2d92%.
Chest x-ray: Large right hydropneumothorax.
The patient was intubated in the ER for severe sepsis and admitted to the ICU and is currently sedated.
Physician instructions: You are about to meet with Mrs. White’s daughter, Ms. White, to discuss treatment op-
tions, she is the designated health care power of attorney. You have met with the daughter briefly when her
mother was in the ER. Your team has already given her the news about her mother’s esophageal perforation
and current clinical situation. They told her that you were going to speak with her regarding possible treatments
for the esophageal perforation. The focus of this conversation should be on discussing treatment options and the
decision-making process.

Training Surgeons to Use BC/WC
 Cardiac Case #1: Severe Aortic Stenosis
Mr. Rodgers is an 83-year-old man with severe aortic stenosis with New York Heart Association Class III heart
failure with ejection fraction 35%, moderate COPD (not on home O2) without previous chest surgery, and
recently admitted to the hospital for dyspnea on exertion and presyncopal symptoms. He has undergone full pre-
operative evaluation for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and does not have appropriate vascular access for
a transfemoral approach, his CT chest shows favorable aortic annulus, and coronary angiography shows mild CAD
disease. His calculated Society of Thoracic Surgery mortality score is 5.6%. You are asked by the medical team for
consultation about aortic value replacement.
Physician instructions: You are about to meet with Mr. Rodgers to discuss options for his aortic stenosis. You did
meet him briefly this morning, but he asked to delay the conversation until this afternoon. The medical team has
already given him the news about his severe aortic stenosis causing his current symptoms. The focus of this con-
versation should be on discussing treatment options and the decision-making process.
Cardiac Case #2: Native Valve Endocarditis
Mrs. Starr is a 79-year-old woman a history of mitral regurgitation is hospitalized for fevers. She has end-stage
renal disease and receives hemodialysis, had a stroke six months before, and is confined to a wheelchair. She un-
derwent dental scaling one month earlier. She notes recent intermittent fevers and weight loss. On cardiac ex-
amination, her regurgitation murmur appears to be unchanged. A transthoracic echocardiogram shows a
mobile, 10 mm mitral-valve vegetation and severe mitral regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiogram con-
firms a paravalvular abscess. Blood cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus and the cardiology team just emergently
placed a temporary transvenous pacemaker for new-onset complete heart block. You are consulted for urgent
mitral valve replacement.
Physician instructions: You are about to meet with Mrs. Starr’s daughter to discuss treatment options, given she
is her designated health care power of attorney and the patient cannot make decisions on her own due to altered
mental status. You did meet the patient and her daughter earlier today. The cardiology team has already told the
daughter about her endocarditis, abscess, valve dysfunction, and heart block needing the pacemaker. They also
told her that you were going to speak with her regarding possible heart valve surgery. The focus of this conver-
sation should be on discussing treatment options and the decision-making process.
Cardiac Case #3: Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease
Mr. Rodgers is an 82-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, 150-pack-year smoking history with
moderate COPD who presented to the ED with chest pain, relieved with medication, and no significant electro-
cardiographic changes. Cardiac catheterization reveals three-vessel disease with good targets. Lives at home but
has seemed increasingly frail with weight loss. Had transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed no valve abnor-
malities, ejection fraction 40%.
Physician instructions: You are about to meet with Mr. Rodgers’ daughter to discuss treatment options, given
she is his designated health care power of attorney and the patient cannot make decisions on his own. You met
him and his daughter before his transthoracic echocardiogram results. The cardiology team has already given her
the news about the catheterization and echocardiogram results. They told her that you were going to speak with
her regarding possible treatments for her father. The focus of this conversation should be on discussing treat-
ment options and the decision-making process.
