Background: The objective of this HERO study was to assess the number of new cancer patients that will
30
require at least one course of radiotherapy by 2025.
31
Methods: European cancer incidence data by tumor site and country for 2012 and 2025 was extracted
32
from the GLOBOCAN database. The projection of the number of new cases took into account demographic
33
factors (age and size of the population). Population based stages at diagnosis were taken from four
34
European countries. Incidence and stage data were introduced in the Australian Collaboration for
35
Cancer Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CCORE) model.
36
Results: Among the different tumor sites, the highest expected relative increase by 2025 in treatment
37
courses was prostate cancer (24%) while lymphoma (13%), head and neck (12%) and breast cancer
38
(10%) were below the average. Based on the projected cancer distributions in 2025, a 16% expected
39
increase in the number of radiotherapy treatment courses was estimated. This increase varied across
40
European countries from less than 5% to more than 30%.
41
Conclusion: With the already existing disparity in radiotherapy resources in mind, the data provided here
42
should act as a leverage point to raise awareness among European health policy makers of the need for
43
investment in radiotherapy.

The number of newly-diagnosed cancer patients that would
49
require radiotherapy treatment using an evidence-based approach
50
was estimated for all European countries for the year 2012 within
51
the framework of the ESTRO-HERO (Health Economics in Radiation
52
Oncology) project [1]. The estimate was based on optimal utiliza-
53
tion of radiation oncology according to the CCORE methodological
54
approach [2], using incidence data for European countries as esti-
55
mated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
56
[3,4], and combined with data on stage at diagnosis from four
57
population-based cancer registries (The Netherlands, Slovenia,
58
Grater Poland region of Poland, and Belgium) available in the cat-
59
egories required [5].
60
This estimation provides a useful tool for planning the required
61
equipment and staff needs. One of the critical results was the
62
observed gap between the optimal utilization and the actual use
63
of radiotherapy, with most countries covering less than 80% of
64
the evidence-based demand for treatment compared with actual
65
use [1]. This evidence could be immediately applied to improve
66
cancer control planning with respect to placing the necessary
67
investments required to cope with the demand of cancer patients.
68
Long-term planning is required for radiotherapy facilities as
69
well as for the staff needed, due to the significant interval between
70
the time of making decisions for facility investments and training
71
of personnel and the time when they become a clinical reality. A
72
forecast of the anticipated changes in terms of new cancer patients
73
that would need radiotherapy in the short- to medium-term time
74
horizon seems rational, and fits within the objectives of the
75
ESTRO-HERO project.
76
The aim of this paper is then to assess the number of new can-
77
cer patients by tumor site that will require radiotherapy in 2025 as
78
compared to the 2012 data, using the national cancer incidence
79
estimates based on data from the population-based cancer reg-
80
istries available in each European country together with projec-
81
tions carried out by IARC in GLOBOCAN [6].

Materials and methods
83
European country-specific cancer incidence by tumor type was
84
extracted from the GLOBOCAN database [4] for the year 2012. The
85
detailed description of the data and the methods used to compute
86
these estimates is given elsewhere [3]. To summarize, statistical
87
models were developed to predict incidence rates for the year
88
2012 from recent trends, wherever possible. The country, sex,
89
and site estimated incidence rates in 2012 were then applied to
90
the corresponding population estimates to obtain the estimated
91
numbers of new cancers in each European country in 2012. Projec-
92
tions for the year 2025 were computed using the facility available
93
at the GLOBOCAN website [4]. The projected numbers of new can-
94
cer cases have been derived by applying the age-specific incidence
95
rates estimated for 2012 to the corresponding forecast population
96
in 2025. Therefore, the projected incident cases for 2025 took into
97
account the demographic changes (age structure and size), but not
98
the potential impact of the changes in risk factors.
99
Tumor sites included in the analysis were as follows: bladder,
100
brain, breast, cervix, colon, gallbladder, head and neck (lip, oral
101
cavity, larynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and nasopharynx), kid-
102
ney, leukemia, lung, lymphoma (including Hodgkin and non-
103
Hodgkin lymphoma), melanoma, multiple myeloma, esophagus,
104
ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, stomach, testis and corpus
105
uteri). It has been necessary to adapt the categories provided by
106
GLOBOCAN
to
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
radiotherapy
107
evidence-based Optimal Utilization Proportion (OUP) [2]. ‘‘Colon
108
and rectum” cancer was partitioned into colon and rectal cancers,
109
‘‘lip and oral cavity” into lip and oral cavity and the category ‘‘other
110
pharynx” into oropharynx and hypopharynx. In order to do this, we
111
extracted data from population-based cancer registries available in
112
the last volume of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents [7] for as
113
many European countries as possible and computed proportions
114
of each individual category. When no data were available in a par-
115
ticular country (such as Albania, Macedonia or Luxembourg), the
116
data from a neighboring country was used. The same proportions
117
were used in the 2012 and 2025 estimates.
118
OUP of radiotherapy by tumor site was obtained from the
119
Australian Collaboration for Cancer Outcomes Research and Evalua-
120
tion (CCORE) review [2], which provided radiotherapy indications
121
for all tumor sites according to the relevant evidence-based clinical
122
guidelines by tumor site and stage at diagnosis, updated to 2012. The
123
stage at diagnosis originally used in the CCORE was from the Aus-
124
tralian cancer registry. Four different European cancer registries
125
provided data fitted to the CCORE decision trees structure (Slovenia,
126
Grater Poland region of Poland, Belgium and The Netherlands) in
127
order to estimate the OUP using a range of stage at diagnosis from
128
distinct European countries. The methodological details of this anal-
129
ysis have been provided elsewhere [5]. The same OUPs were used in
130
the 2012 and 2025 estimates. For the correct interpretation of the
131
OUPs it is necessary to know that each patient is counted only once,
132
even if he or she subsequently required further treatment for the
133
particular cancer. Brachytherapy treatments were not considered.
134
Results
135
About 4 million new cancer patients are predicted in 2025 in Eur-
136
ope based on demographic changes. This represents a 15.9% increase
137
in the absolute number of cases compared to the 3.4 million diag-
138
nosed in 2012, assuming overall cancer rates remain unchanged
139
(Table 1). Using the lowest OUP estimated for each country, the
140
absolute number of patients that would have an indication for radio-
141
therapy at least once during the course of the disease would increase
142
from 1,700,000 patients approximately in 2012 to 2,000,000 in 2025.
143
This represents a 16.1% increase over the entire period.
144
This increase in the number of expected cases is not distributed
145
evenly across European countries (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Eastern
146
European countries exhibited, broadly speaking, the lowest per-
147
centile increases, with Bulgaria, Ukraine, Latvia and Lithuania
148
expecting decreases in the number of new cancer cases, while
149
the incidence burden in many of the rest of Eastern countries is
150
predicted to increase by less than 10%. The exceptions were Poland,
151
the Czech Republic and Slovakia with increases of around 20% or
152
above. However, when the focus is on the absolute in numbers,
153
as shown in Fig. 2, it is clear that the greater increases are esti-
154
mated in the most densely populated countries.
155
South-Eastern European countries showed a diversity of esti-
156
mated changes in the number of patients, from a relative decrease
157
in Bulgaria (�0.8%) to an increase of 33.4% in Albania. The highest
158
relative increases were observed among small countries with no
159
clear geographic pattern (Iceland, Ireland and Cyprus) with
160
increases above 35%, while the incidence rises in more populated
161
countries such as The Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway were
162
between 25% and 31%. The countries of Western Europe, including
163
France, Germany, Italy, Spain or the UK, with the highest volume of
164
population, exhibited increases in the number of new cases from
165
2012 to 2025 by between 15% and 25%.
166
Relative changes by tumor site and for all countries combined
167
are presented in Table 2. It is worth noting that prostate cancer
168
produced the highest increase over the period considered with a
169
24.4% rise followed by bladder cancer and multiple myeloma,
170
while female breast cancer, lymphomas and head and neck cancer
171
were below average. Importantly, cervical cancer only increased by
172
1.1% while the numbers of patients with a radiotherapy indication
173
for cancer of the testis declined.
174
The tumors that make up the highest percentage of patients in a
175
radiotherapy department, namely breast, rectum, head and neck,
176
lung and prostate cancers are shown in Table 3 for each European
177
country with their absolute and relative increase. Some relative
178
increases are noteworthy and deserve close analysis at national
179
level. For instance, countries such as Spain, The Netherlands or
180
the Czech Republic show an increase higher than 25% for rectal
181
cancer patients with a radiotherapy indication, while Belgium,
182
UK or Denmark have an estimated increase above 20%. Also, the
183
estimated increase for prostate or lung cancer is very important
184
in many western European countries, higher than 20%; while the
185
observed increases for breast cancer patients are moderate in
186
comparison.
187
Fig. 3 provides a visual representation of the cancer types with
188
the highest absolute number of radiotherapy indications, projected
189
for the 2025. Interestingly, in several countries bladder cancer
190
ranks among the most frequent cases according to the evidence-
191
based indications, due to its high incidence in these countries. A
192
similar observation can be made for lymphoma (estimates by
193
country for all tumor types can be consulted in the web-based
194
Supplementary material).
195
Discussion
196
Projections of the incidence of cancer are helpful in assessing
197
the future burden of cancer and in order to establish appropriate
198
cancer control plans to cope with the challenge posed by a growing
199
number of cancer patients. The projections carried out in GLOBO-
200
CAN by IARC, combined with the evidence-based data on radio-
201
therapy indications offer a unique opportunity to undertake
202
long-term radiotherapy resource planning. The obtained data, by
203
tumor site and by country within Europe, give guidance for making
204
the necessary investments in services and equipment and for
205
setting-up training of dedicated personnel, necessary actions to
206
adequately manage the increased radiotherapy demands expected
207
in the near future.

 208
Other groups have performed similar exercises. Datta and col-
209
leagues made estimates of the additional number of treatment
210
units and personnel – radiation oncologists, medical physicists
211
and radiation technologists – required in 39 European countries
212
by 2020 [8]. Actual radiotherapy resources were obtained from
213
the DIRAC (Directory of Radiotherapy Centres) database; whereas
214
actual and future needs were computed using actual and projected
215
cancer incidence data from GLOBOCAN, combined with the
216
assumption that 62.5% of all cancer patients would require RT
217
(50% of new cancer patients plus 25% of these for re-irradiation)
218
and with required machine and staffing levels based on ESTRO-
219
QUARTS [9] and IAEA recommendations [10]. In contrast to their
220
approach, our projections are restricted to the number of cancer
221
patients that can be expected to benefit from radiotherapy by
222
2025, hence courses that should be delivered, without making
223
assumptions – as yet – about the resources that would be required
224
to make this possible. Our previously published HERO-analysis has
225
indeed demonstrated that the available European radiotherapy
226
guidelines do not sufficiently take into account the rapid technol-
227
ogy evolution in radiotherapy, hence in our view do not provide
228
sufficiently robust estimates to correctly predict the real resource
229
needs for each individual country [11]. With their activity-based
230
approach using time-based estimates for diverse activities within
231
the radiotherapy treatment process (instead of using average
232
throughput estimates), the Global Task Force on Radiotherapy for
233
Cancer Control has taken an important step in forecasting radio-
234
therapy resource needs for a given patient population, requiring
235
a certain number of radiotherapy courses [12]. The HERO-project
236
is now adopting a similar activity-based approach to develop a pro-
237
ductivity and costing model that can be tailored to the specific
238
needs of each European jurisdiction, based on the actual radiother-
239
apy needs down to the level of each cancer type, and accounting for
240
the evolving radiotherapy practice in terms of complexity and frac-
241
tionation schedules.
242
The effects taken into account by the methodology used in the
243
projections of cancer incidence are demographic (age structure
244
changes and population size), the major contributor to future
245
increasing number of new cancer cases in Europe [13]. Risk factor
246
changes and their potential consequences on incidence or, more
247
simply, trends-based approaches have however not been consid-
248
ered. All factors taken into account, the projection methodology
249
applied here could be considered conservative, assuming that
250
changes in age-specific rates beyond 2012 were assumed to remain
251
constant through 2025. The uncertainties associated with possible

253
– may be considered sufficiently high as to make reliable predic-
254
tions of their impact on future trends a difficult and potentially
255
misleading exercise [14].
256
The second source of data used in this study has been the OUP.
257
Any possible change in the evidence-base of the radiotherapy indi-
258
cations in the coming future, and consequently in the OUP for any
259
particular tumor site, will have implications for the expected num-
260
ber of cases for radiotherapy treatment. However, the OUP has
261
been quite robust when considered for all cancers together when
262
the update of 2012 was compared to the evaluation of the clinical
263
guidelines up to the year 2003 [2,15]. In fact, the expansion of con-
264
servative approaches to organ preservation, and the increased
265
combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in tumor sites
266
such as cervical, rectal or lung cancer [16], related to an earlier
267
stage at diagnosis, will most probably expand the number of
268
candidates for radiotherapy. Moreover, new radiotherapy tech-
269

270
and less toxic effects on the surrounding tissue jointly with new

The need of radiotherapy in Europe in 2025
RADION 6768

Please cite this article in press as: Borras JM et al. How many new cancer patients in Europe will require radiotherapy by 2025? An ESTRO-HERO analysis.

 271
combinations with chemotherapy could also influence the number
272
of candidates for radiotherapy treatments [17]. In summary, a
273
decrease in the number of patients due to a reduction in indica-
274
tions is highly improbable.
275
The main result of this study is that the absolute number of new
276
cancer patients with a radiotherapy indication will increase in the
277
immediate future in almost all European countries, although there
278
are variations in their relative magnitude between the countries
279
and regions of Europe. As mentioned, the driver of the predictions
280
utilized here are the projected population aging and population
281
growth. Classical drivers of such demographical changes are fertil-
282
ity, mortality and migration. The latter is the least predictable and
283
is more prone to short-term changes. However the impact of
284
migration is usually mainly seen in younger age groups, who have
285
a relatively low cancer risk. From a global viewpoint, EU countries
286
exhibit a very moderate short-term increase in the size of the pop-
287
ulation (0.8% between 2015 and 2020 and 1.2% between 2020 and
288
2030). The Nordic and some western countries (e.g. France, the
289
UK), are the only countries to clearly indicate an increase in the
290
size of the population in the mid- and longer-term projections
291
[18] until 2050 or later. Eastern European countries show a
292
decrease in population size in the mid- and longer-term, however
293
the main decrease is predicted beyond 2025 for all these countries,
294
including the Russian Federation and Ukraine [19].
295
Aging of the European population, due to the increases in long-
296
evity and low fertility levels, is a parallel process that explains the
297
increase in number of cases. One consequence of this process is
298
that the very old (80 years or older) are the fastest growing popu-
299
lation age group in Europe. Age and cancer incidence are strongly
300
associated, hence the aging process has a strong impact on the can-
301
cer incidence in countries with the highest percentage of older age
302
groups, such as Germany, Italy or Spain. The main consequence for
303
radiotherapy as well as for the multidisciplinary management of
304
this aged patient group is the growing prevalence of patients with
305
multi-morbidities
including
cancer,
which
influences
clinical
306
decision-making. Indeed, one of the most relevant factors that
307
explains lower than expected indications for radiotherapy is the
308
presence of comorbidity and old age [20–22]. These clinically-
309
related factors – coupled with patient preferences – could in part
310
explain the gap between the optimal and actual use of radiother-
311
apy observed in different analyses [1,23]. Other factors are more
312
policy-related and include accessibility problems due to the dis-
313
tance to radiotherapy departments, lengthy waiting lists, a lack
314
of resources and/or old therapeutic technologies [1], which are

all more amenable to health policy efforts. Indeed, differences
316
between evidence-based indications and clinical practice could
317
be observed in the relative importance of bladder cancer or lym-
318
phoma as indication, which is not in line with the actual demand
319
for radiotherapy in our clinical departments. These discrepancies
320
may reflect shortcomings of the model or an indication that some
321
patients with indications for radiotherapy are not being treated
322
appropriately [24]. These observations should be the target for
323
health services research in this field in the coming future in order
324
to refine the projections.
325
The projections of the new cancer patients are useful to assess
326
the expected increase in cancer burden and the related impact
327
for radiotherapy services by country and type of tumor. This anal-
328
ysis has been done under reasonable and conservative assump-
329
tions regarding the projections of cancer incidence. Considered
330

by these projections are important, especially as important differ-
332
ences in the capital resources and staff among European countries
333
have been documented [25,26], as well as the gap between optimal
334
and actual use [1]. The fact that such a gulf has been identified in
335
the majority of European countries and that the need for radiother-
336
apy has been estimated for optimal utilization, could suggest that a
337
more conservative target for planning radiotherapy equipment and
338
staff should be proposed. In this respect, 80% of the optimal
339
demand may be a reasonable first policy target [27]. Additionally,
340
the resources required should be invested within the framework
341
of a national cancer control plan [27,28].
342
In conclusion, the study has shown that the need for radiother-
343
apy in Europe on average is expected to increase with 16% from
344
2012 to 2025. The expected changes in demand varied consider-
345
ably between countries (range 0–35%). With the already existing
346
disparity in radiotherapy resources in mind, the data provided here
347
should act as a leverage point to raise awareness among European
348
health policy makers of the need for investment in radiotherapy.
