Purpose
Collaborative care between cancer specialists and primary care providers (PCPs) may improve the
delivery of high-quality cancer care. Yet, patient perspectives about how involved the PCPs were in
their breast cancer care and treatment decisions remain unknown.
Patients and Methods
A weighted random sample of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 to 2014, as
reported to the SEER registries in Los Angeles, California, and Georgia, were sent a survey ap-
proximately 6 months after diagnosis (N = 2,279, 71% response rate). The distributions of patient-
perceived PCP quality (six questions about PCP access and awareness of values) and the following
three measures of patient-reported PCP involvement were assessed: how informed the respondent
felt her PCP was about her breast cancer (engagement); how often the respondent talked with her
PCP (communication); and how often the respondent felt the PCP participated in treatment de-
cisions (participation). Adjusted mean scores of patient-reported satisfaction with and deliberation
about the surgical treatment decision were then compared across levels of PCP engagement,
communication, and participation using multivariable linear regression.
Results
The majority of women in this sample perceived high PCP quality (63.6%), high PCP breast cancer
engagement (66.2%), and high PCP communication (69.1%). More than a third of women (35.4%)
reported that their PCP participated in their treatment decisions. Higher PCP engagement was
associated with higher decision satisfaction when compared with low PCP engagement (adjusted
P = .003).
Conclusion
Patient perceptions of PCP quality and PCP involvement in breast cancer care during treatment are
high for most women, and PCPs often participate in breast cancer treatment decisions. However, PCP
involvement did not lead to meaningful improvements in patients’ appraisals of their decision making.

INTRODUCTION
Primary care physicians (PCPs) play a diverse role
in caring for patients with cancer across the
continuum from prevention, early detection,
diagnosis, and treatment to survivorship.1 Often,
PCPs have a longer relationship with patients with
cancer than cancer doctors do, making them po-
tentially more attuned to a patient’s values, pref-
erences, and needs.2 Survivors of cancer are more
likely to receive appropriate preventive care when
both an oncologist and PCP are involved in their
care, suggesting that increasing PCP involvement
in cancer care may also improve quality of care.3
The increasing size and age of the population
of patients with cancer and the growing com-
plexity of their ongoing care motivate the need for
collaborative cancer care management.1,4 Many
patients need to address both the newly diagnosed
cancer and chronic comorbid health conditions
with different specialists.5,6 Coordination and
communication between their providers are more
challenging for these patients but also more im-
portant. As a result of these changes in the landscape
of cancer survivorship, the Institute of Medicine
explicitly recommends comprehensive, patient-
centered, collaborative care models that promote
cross-specialty clinician collaboration, particularly
between primary care and cancer care teams.1

 However, despite the calls for more PCP involvement in cancer care,
no studies have quantitatively examined the degree to which this
actually occurs or how patients perceive their PCPs’ participation
in their cancer care. Prior qualitative studies suggest that patients
are open to having PCPs manage aspects of their care but report
hesitation and uncertainty about the PCP’s role in delivering this
care.7,8 A better understanding of primary care involvement in
cancer care and patients’ perspectives about the value of PCP in-
volvement will inform strategies to build stronger collaborative
team models.
Therefore, the aims of this study were to describe patient
perceptions of the overall quality of their primary care; describe
patient perceptions of the degree of involvement of their PCP
(patient-reported PCP engagement, communication, and parti-
cipation) in their breast cancer–related care; and assess whether
these measures were associated with patient appraisal of their cancer
treatment decision making in a diverse population of women with
breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Population
The Individualized Cancer Care (iCanCare) Study is a large,
population-based survey study of women with early-stage breast cancer
and their providers. We identified and accrued 3,880 women, ages 20 to
79 years, with newly diagnosed, early-stage breast cancer (stages I and II)
as reported to the SEER registries of Georgia and Los Angeles County,
California, in 2013 to 2014. Patients were ineligible if they had stage III or
IV disease, had tumors larger than 5 cm, or could not complete a ques-
tionnaire in English or Spanish (n = 249). Of the remaining 3,631 eligible
women who were mailed surveys, 2,578 completed the survey, resulting in
a 71% response rate. The details of the analytic sample of 2,279 women are
displayed in Figure 1.
Patients were identified via rapid case ascertainment of their initial
surgical pathology reports, derived from a list of definitive surgical pro-
cedures (performed with the intent of removing the entire tumor and
obtaining clear margins). Surveys were mailed approximately 2 months
after surgery (median time from diagnosis to survey completion was
6 months; range, 1 to 10 months). Women were asked about their treatment
experiences, knowledge and attitudes, appraisal of communication and de-
cision making, and quality of life. To encourage response, we provided a $20
cash incentive and used a modified Dillman approach to patient recruitment,9
including reminders to nonrespondents. All materials were sent in English
and Spanish to those with Spanish surnames.10,11 Responses to the survey
were then merged with clinical data by the SEER registries, and a deidentified
analytic data set was created. The study was approved by the University of
Michigan Institutional Review Board and the state and institution in-
stitutional review boards of the SEER registries.
Measures
Questionnaire content was developed based on a conceptual frame-
work that hypothesized that PCP involvement leads to improved primary
care quality, prior literature, and our prior work. We used standard tech-
niques to assess content validity, including systematic review by design
experts, cognitive pretesting with patients, and pilot studies in selected
clinic populations.
Patient-Perceived PCP Quality
Patient-perceived PCP quality was measured using an adapted Pri-
mary Care Assessment Tool–Adult scale.12 This measure is designed to
assess overall perceived quality, rather than an objective measure of quality.
Patient responses to six questions, including four questions ascertaining
ease of primary care access and two questions about the PCP’s awareness of
the patient’s values, were averaged (questions are included in the Data
Supplement). The response categories for each question reflected a 5-point
Likert-type item, ranging from never to always. The average PCP quality
summary scores were then categorized as high (average score $ 4),
moderate (score of 3), and low (score , 3).
Patient-Reported PCP Involvement in Breast Cancer Care
To measure patient-reported PCP involvement in breast cancer care,
we used the following three measures, which were all 5-point Likert scale
items: how informed the respondent felt her PCP was about her breast
cancer (PCP engagement); how often the respondent talked with her PCP
(PCP communication); and how often the respondent felt the PCP par-
ticipated in treatment decisions (PCP participation). Patient-reported PCP
engagement was measured using an adapted item from the Consumer
Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Patient-Centered Medical
Home Item Set.13 Women were asked the following question: “In the past
6 months, how often did your PCP seem informed and up-to-date about
the care you got from your breast cancer doctors?” Responses were cat-
egorized as high (score $ 3) versus low PCP engagement. Patient-reported
PCP communication was defined by asking women, “After going to the
specialist or special service for breast cancer, did your primary care
provider talk with you about what happened at the visit?” This question
was an adapted item from the Primary Care Assessment Tool–Adult
scale,12 and the item was categorized as high (score $ 3) versus low

 communication. We also assessed a combined measure of PCP in-
volvement by averaging the responses to the engagement and commu-
nication items and found similar results (data not shown). Patient-
reported PCP participation was defined using a novel measure de-
veloped by our research group that asked women, “How much did your
primary care provider participate in your breast cancer treatment de-
cisions?” This item was categorized as high (score $ 3) versus low
participation.
Patient-Reported Appraisal of Decision Making
We used the following two measures to evaluate how patients ap-
praised their decision-making process: surgical treatment decision satis-
faction, and degree of deliberation for overall treatment decisions. Patient
satisfaction with the surgical treatment decision was measured using
a validated five-item scale11,14 (each with response options of “not at all” to
“very much”). An overall decision satisfaction score was created using the
mean of the responses to the five items, with higher scores representing
higher decision satisfaction. As done in prior studies,11 a score of $ 4
indicated high decision satisfaction.
Decision deliberation was measured using a four-item scale derived
from measures of public deliberation adapted to apply to cancer
treatment–related decisions.15 Items assessed the extent to which a patient
weighed the pros and cons of a decision, how much they talked to others
while they were making the decision, and how much they thought through
and spent time thinking about the decision. All items had 5-point Likert-
type response options (from “not at all” [1 point] to “very much”
[5 points]). An overall deliberation score was created using the mean of the
responses to the four items (range, 1 to 5), with higher scores representing
more deliberation. A score of $ 4 to indicated a more deliberative decision
process.
Covariates
The covariates in this analysis included patient demographics, clinical
factors, and length of time the patient reported seeing her PCP. De-
mographic characteristics collected via survey included age at diagnosis;
race (white, black, Hispanic, Asian, or other/unknown); educational at-
tainment (less than high school, high school graduate, or some college or
more); insurance status; and patient report of her number of comorbid
health conditions (including heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, diabetes, blood clots, connective tissue disease, stroke, and de-
pression). Also collected via survey were breast cancer treatment char-
acteristics, including primary surgical treatment modality (lumpectomy,
unilateral mastectomy, or bilateral mastectomy); receipt of chemotherapy
(yes or no); and receipt of endocrine therapy (yes or no). Length of time
seeing the PCP was also asked, with response categories of less than 1 year,
1 to 2 years, and more than 2 years.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses incorporated weights to account for differential
probabilities of sample selection and nonresponse and to assure that the
distributions of our sample resemble those of the target population.16
Although item nonresponse was low (, 5%), to correct for potential
nonresponse bias as a result of missing data, values for missing items were
imputed using sequential multiple imputation.17,18 We generated five
independently imputed completed data sets, which were analyzed sepa-
rately, and then inferential statistics were combined across completed data
to construct sequential multiple imputation inference.19 Imputed data
were used for the multivariable analyses only.
The bivariable associations of primary care quality with PCP en-
gagement, communication, and participation in the treatment decision
were evaluated using Rao-Scott x2 tests. Multivariable, weighted logistic
regression was then used to characterize patient demographic and clinical
factors associated with higher PCP engagement, communication, and
participation in the treatment decision using three separate models, which
included age, race, insurance, comorbidities, PCP quality and continuity,
and chemotherapy use. Adjusted mean decision satisfaction and de-
liberation scores were then compared across levels of PCP communication,
engagement, and participation in the treatment decision using multi-
variable linear regression, adjusting for age, race, insurance, education,
comorbidities, chemotherapy, PCP quality, PCP continuity, and surgical
treatment. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) and STATA 13.1 (STATA, College Station, TX) and two-sided tests,
and P , .05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Overall, the majority of women in this sample were $ 55 years of
age (71.6%), were white (56.7%; followed by black [17.6%] and
Hispanic [14.5%]), had private insurance (54.5%), and completed
at least some college (71.3%). The majority of patients (68.2%)
reported seeing their current PCP for more than 2 years. Overall,
63.6% of women perceived their primary care as high quality,
66.2% perceived high PCP engagement in their care, 69.1%
perceived high communication about their cancer care, and
35.4% perceived high PCP participation in treatment decisions
(Table 1).
Perceptions of high PCP quality were associated with patient
reports of higher PCP communication and engagement in their
cancer care and higher participation in the treatment decision (all
P , .001; Figs 2A to 2C). Among women who perceived high PCP
quality, 21.7% reported low PCP engagement and 18.7% reported
low PCP communication about the cancer care. By contrast,
among women who perceived low PCP quality, 81.7% also re-
ported low PCP engagement and 77.9% reported low PCP
communication about their cancer care (all P , .001). Overall,
43.9% of women who perceived high PCP quality also reported
that their PCP more often participated in their decision versus
12.3% of women who reported low quality (P , .001; Fig 2C).
Table 2 lists the multivariable-adjusted associations between
perceived PCP quality and high PCP engagement, communication,
and participation in the treatment decision. Patient-perceived PCP
quality was strongly associated with all three measures of PCP
involvement, because women who reported high PCP quality were
much more likely to report high PCP engagement, more frequent
PCP communication about their cancer care, and had 6.5-fold
greater odds of reporting high PCP participation in their treatment
decision (engagement: odds ratio [OR], 13.65; 95% CI, 8.70 to
21.40; communication: OR, 14.28; 95% CI, 9.43 to 21.63; par-
ticipation: OR, 6.46; 95% CI, 3.99 to 10.47).
Black, Hispanic, and Asian women more often reported high
PCP participation in their treatment decision compared with white
women (black: OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.21; Hispanic: OR, 2.14;
95% CI, 1.61 to 2.85; Asian: OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.04 to 3.99).
Women with more education (high school, some college or more)
reported low PCP participation in the treatment decision when
compared with women with less than a high school education
(Table 2 and Appendix Table A1, online only) Women with two or
more comorbidities reported higher PCP engagement and com-
munication compared with women with no comorbidities (en-
gagement: OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.54 to 2.93; communication: OR,
2.25; 95% CI, 1.59 to 3.19). Women who received chemotherapy
perceived low PCP engagement and low PCP communication

 about their cancer care compared with women who did not receive
chemotherapy (engagement: OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.97;
communication: OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; Table 2 and
Appendix Table A1).
Table 3 lists the adjusted mean decision satisfaction and
deliberation scores across levels of PCP engagement, commu-
nication, and participation. Women who reported high PCP
engagement reported higher decision satisfaction scores (4.47)
compared with women who reported low PCP engagement (4.36;
P = .003). Women who reported high PCP communication also
reported higher mean deliberation scores than women who reported
low PCP communication (3.80 v 3.70, respectively; P = .07), albeit
this difference was not statistically significant. Greater PCP partici-
pation in the treatment decision was not associated with higher
decision satisfaction or more deliberation (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Findings from this large population-based study of women with
newly diagnosed breast cancer showed that a large majority of
women perceived a high level of primary care quality in general.
Most women also reported a high level of PCP involvement in their
cancer care (PCPs were engaged in their cancer care, communi-
cated with them about it, and participated in treatment decisions).
However, when their PCP was more involved, patients did not
meaningfully appraise their treatment decisions more favorably. To
our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to assess the
degree to which patients feel that their PCP is involved in their
initial cancer treatment decision making and care.
Prior literature suggests PCPs have long-term relationships
with their patients, and patients report PCPs are generally attuned
to their preferences for care and that their PCP is accessible during
and right after cancer treatment.1,2,8 Our findings expand this work
and suggest that PCPs may be more involved in the breast cancer
treatment decision-making process than previously understood.
More than a third of women reported that their PCP was frequently
involved in their decision, and this perception of participation was
greatest among minority women, those with less education, and
those with more comorbidities. This finding suggests that PCPs are
more likely to be involved in discussing treatment decisions with
patients who are most vulnerable to poor outcomes. As such,
efforts need to be made to address the lack of knowledge among
PCPs20 about the specifics of cancer treatment so that they can
appropriately counsel all patients faced with these decisions.
Outreach that targets improving PCP confidence about more fully
participating in cancer-related care is warranted.20 However, PCP
participation in the breast cancer treatment decision was not as-
sociated with higher decision satisfaction in this sample, and we do
not know to what extent PCPs were involved.
Our findings highlight important opportunities to further
improve communication between PCPs and patients about their
breast cancer care. In particular, approximately 20% of women
reported low PCP engagement and communication about their
cancer care, despite perceiving high PCP quality. Efforts to improve
primary care engagement after diagnosis of breast cancer may be
particularly effective in this substantial minority of patients. Pro-
visions to address these issues are currently being implemented,
including the use of care plans that are intended to close the
communication loop between PCPs, cancer specialists, and the
patient.21,22 However, survivorship care plans have not been found
to improve quality to date, and uptake has been limited.23-25 The
increasing use of electronic medical records may also help facilitate
electronic communication between PCPs and cancer providers and
between these providers and patients via patient portals, but may
also hinder more active discussions between providers and patients.
These clinician-directed provisions do not address the issue of
improving the communication and exchange of information about
the cancer care between the PCP and the patient. Incorporating

 patients into future collaborative cancer care interventions is war-
ranted if the ultimate goal is to deliver patient-centered care.
Although women who reported high PCP involvement in
their cancer care also reported marginally greater decision satis-
faction and deliberation about their decision, it is important to
note these absolute differences were negligible. The limited in-
fluence of PCP involvement on patient appraisals of their treat-
ment decision making in this study may in part be a result of the
more limited role of PCPs during the cancer treatment process.
Our findings that women who were on chemotherapy (or com-
pleted it) reported lower PCP involvement and women with more
comorbidities reported more PCP involvement in their cancer care
reflect that women on active chemotherapy are more likely to be
regularly seeing an oncologist and women with comorbidities are
more likely to be regularly seeing their PCP. It is plausible, however,
that PCPs play a more influential role in care and treatment de-
cisions further in the survivorship period when they are more
actively involved. Therefore, additional research focused on un-
derstanding PCPs’ roles and involvement in delivering care in the
survivorship period is needed.
The current study provides important data on patients’
perspectives about their PCPs’ involvement in cancer care in a large
and diverse population-based sample. However, there are potential
limitations to consider. First, this study was cross-sectional, and
our ability to make inferences about the temporality of these
associations is limited. Therefore, additional studies that assess the
temporality of these associations are needed to better understand
whether patient-perceived quality influences PCP involvement or
PCP involvement influences patient-perceived quality in the
context of cancer treatment. Second, we did not collect in-
formation on the frequency of PCP visits during the time the other
patient-reported PCP measures were assessed. It is possible that the
level of PCP quality, engagement, and communication about the
cancer care and participation in the treatment decision is related to
how often the patient saw the PCP during this time. Finally, our
population includes patients with breast cancer in Los Angeles
County, California, and Georgia; thus, generalizability to other
populations may be limited.
In conclusion, patient perceptions of primary care quality and
PCP engagement in and communication about breast cancer care

Primary Care Physician Involvement in Breast Cancer Care
 during treatment are high for most women, and PCPs are often
participating in breast cancer treatment decisions. However, the
involvement of PCPs in breast cancer care and treatment de-
cisions did not lead to meaningful improvements in patients’
appraisals of their decision making. Efforts to better incorporate
and communicate with PCPs and educate them about the spe-
cifics of cancer treatments are warranted to promote collaborative
cancer care.
