Abstract
BACKGROUND—Salvage radiation therapy is often necessary in men who have undergone 
radical pros-tatectomy and have evidence of prostate-cancer recurrence signaled by a persistently 
or recurrently elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. Whether antiandrogen therapy with 
radiation therapy will further improve cancer control and prolong overall survival is unknown.
METHODS—In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1998 through 2003, we 
assigned 760 eligible patients who had undergone prostatectomy with a lymphadenectomy and had 
disease, as assessed on pathological testing, with a tumor stage of T2 (confined to the prostate but 
with a positive surgical margin) or T3 (with histologic extension beyond the prostatic capsule), no 
nodal involvement, and a detectable PSA level of 0.2 to 4.0 ng per milliliter to undergo radiation 
therapy and receive either antiandrogen therapy (24 months of bicalutamide at a dose of 150 mg 
daily) or daily placebo tablets during and after radiation therapy. The primary end point was the 
rate of overall survival.
RESULTS—The median follow-up among the surviving patients was 13 years. The actuarial rate 
of overall survival at 12 years was 76.3% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 71.3% in 
the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.99; P=0.04). 
The 12-year incidence of death from prostate cancer, as assessed by means of central review, was 
5.8% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 13.4% in the placebo group (P<0.001). The 
cumulative incidence of metastatic prostate cancer at 12 years was 14.5% in the bicalutamide 
group, as compared with 23.0% in the placebo group (P=0.005). The incidence of late adverse 
events associated with radiation therapy was similar in the two groups. Gynecomastia was 
recorded in 69.7% of the patients in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 10.9% of those in 
the placebo group (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS—The addition of 24 months of antiandrogen therapy with daily bicalutamide to 
salvage radiation therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of long-term overall survival and 
lower incidences of metastatic prostate cancer and death from prostate cancer than radiation

ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00002874.)
Patients with localized prostatic cancer are often treated with radical pros-tatectomy. More 
than 30% of such patients will subsequently have recurrence. This recurrence manifests first 
as a rising serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA),1–3 termed biochemical recurrence. 
Large, retrospective studies suggest that salvage radiation therapy after biochemical 
recurrence may be associated with long-term freedom from cancer recurrence.4,5 However, 
50% of the patients who are treated with salvage radiation therapy will have further disease 
progression, particularly when there are aggressive disease features.4–7
The combination of radiation therapy and either androgen-deprivation therapy or 
antiandrogen therapy prolongs survival among some men with an intact prostate.8–11 Thus, 
this combination treatment represents a rational approach to prolong metastasis-free survival 
and overall survival among men with a postoperative recurrence. In randomized trials, the 
oral agent bicalutamide, an androgen-receptor blocker, at a dose of 150 mg daily has been 
shown to be effective against prostate cancer.11,12 Accordingly, the NRG Oncology 
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (formed by merging the National Surgical Adjuvant 
Breast and Bowel Cancer Project, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG], and the 
Gynecologic Oncology Group) designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial (RTOG 9601) to evaluate whether the addition of antiandrogen therapy for 24 months 
during and after salvage radiation therapy could prolong overall survival, as compared with 
radiation therapy plus placebo. Since the initiation of the trial, high-dose bicalutamide has 
been superseded by injectable gonad-otropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists in therapy, 
but the hypothesis tested in this trial remains very relevant. A planned interim analysis of the 
trial in 2010 showed that bicalutamide was associated with significantly lower rates of 
biochemical recurrence and distant metastases than placebo.13 The primary end point of the 
protocol of this trial, the overall survival rate, can now be reported.
METHODS
PATIENTS
Eligible patients had all undergone radical pros-tatectomy with lymphadenectomy and had 
disease that was originally assessed, on the basis of pathological testing, as tumor stage T2 
(confined to the prostate but also with a positive surgical margin) or T3 (with histologic 
extension of tumor beyond the prostatic capsule) without nodal involvement.14 Patients were 
also required to have a detectable PSA level at least 8 weeks after surgery that was 0.2 to 4.0 
ng per milliliter. Eligibility criteria also included a Karnofsky performance-status score of 80 
or more (on a 100-point scale, with lower numbers indicating greater disability), no previous 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy for prostate cancer, and no previous hormone therapy 
other than preoperative short-term hormonal therapy for 2 to 6 months in some patients 
(6.4% of those enrolled). In all the patients, abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic 
(CT) and bone scans showed no metastatic disease. At entry, patients had no evidence of 
hepatic disease, which was defined as a serum alanine or aspartate aminotransferase level 
that was at least 2.5 times the normal value and a serum bilirubin level that was more than

 the institutional upper limit of the normal range. All the patients had a life expectancy of 
more than 10 years.
TRIAL DESIGN
The trial, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), was developed by the first 
author in collaboration with the RTOG NRG Oncology Genitourinary Committee, RTOG 
NRG Oncology, and the sponsor. Both the drug and the placebo were provided by 
AstraZeneca, which had no role in the collection of data, analysis of findings, or preparation 
of this report. All the data were collected by RTOG NRG Oncology, and analyses were 
performed by NRG Oncology statisticians. The manuscript was written by the first author 
with input from all the coauthors, who also reviewed and approved the final version. The 
first author made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All the authors 
vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and analyses and for the adherence of 
the trial to the protocol and the statistical analysis plan (available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org).
After the protocol was approved by an institutional review board at each center, participants 
were recruited and treated at NRG Oncology member sites, including community-based 
sites. All the participants provided written informed consent. Because the trial was placebo-
controlled, there were no prophylactic measures to minimize the development of 
gynecomastia.
Participants were stratified according to the PSA level at trial entry (0.2 to 1.5 ng per 
milliliter vs. 1.6 to 4.0 ng per milliliter), receipt of short-term androgen-deprivation therapy 
before surgery (yes vs. no), positive surgical margin (yes vs. no), and the PSA nadir after 
surgery (<0.5 ng per milliliter vs. =0.5 ng per milliliter). Stratification according to Gleason 
score was not performed because there was no central review of tumor specimens. Patients 
underwent randomization to the two groups according to the permuted-block randomization 
scheme of Zelen.15
TREATMENT
Salvage radiation therapy was initiated within 12 weeks after randomization with the use of 
photon energies of 6 to 10 MV to the original prostatic site, the tumor resection bed, and the 
membranous urethra. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional planning systems were used 
according to institutional choice. A total dose of 64.8 Gy was given in 36 daily fractions of 
1.8 Gy at five sessions per week. Regional pelvic lymph-node treatment was omitted 
because all the patients had negative lymph-node dissections. The trial co-chairs reviewed 
the simulation and portal treatment films for each treatment field.
Tablets were administered in a double-blind, randomized fashion, with either one 150-mg 
tablet of bicalutamide or one placebo tablet administered daily, beginning at the initiation of 
radiation therapy and continuing for 24 months. The medical oncology cochair reviewed all 
the records of the patients in the two trial groups for treatment completion and assessed the 
reasons for early terminations and possible adverse events.

 ASSESSMENTS
At the beginning and end of radiation therapy, patients were assessed by means of clinical 
history and physical examination, Karnofsky performance-status score, complete blood 
count, PSA level, serum alanine aminotransferase level, bilirubin level, and reports of any 
treatment-related adverse effects. Subsequent follow-up evaluation occurred every 3 months 
for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly. Bone and CT scans were 
performed at subsequent biochemical recurrence. If metastatic disease was present or if the 
serum PSA level rose to more than 4.0 ng per milliliter, maximum androgen blockade was 
recommended. Early and late effects of radiation therapy were assessed with the use of the 
RTOG Acute and Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring system.16
END POINTS
The primary end point was the rate of overall survival. Prespecified secondary end points 
included disease-specific death, distant metastases (meta-static prostate cancer), local 
disease progression, non–disease-specific death, any prostate-cancer progression including a 
second biochemical recurrence, and adverse events. Disease-specific death included all 
deaths from prostate cancer or treatment complications as well as death from an unknown 
process in patients with active prostate cancer, on the basis of centrally reviewed cause of 
death. Non–disease-specific death was defined as death from any other cause. Scoring of 
metastatic disease required radiographic confirmation. Local disease progression was 
defined as the development of a palpable mass in the prostatic fossa, as determined by 
means of clinical examination.
The definition of biochemical recurrence was complex, because the lowest level of 
detectable PSA decreased from 0.5 ng per milliliter to 0.2 ng per milliliter during the years 
of enrollment. Generally, the second biochemical recurrence was defined as an increase of at 
least 0.3 ng per milliliter above the lowest detectable PSA level after protocol treatment or as 
the initiation of any subsequent hormone therapy (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org). The third PSA biochemical recurrence occurred when the PSA level 
reached 0.5 ng per milliliter or higher or when there was any disease progression after the 
start of salvage hormone therapy.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We assumed that the annual death rate among patients who underwent radiation therapy and 
received placebo would be 0.063 (median overall survival, 11 years). The addition of 
bicalutamide was hypothesized to result in a death rate that was at least 28.5% lower than 
the rate with placebo (annual death rate in the bicalutamide group, 0.045; hazard ratio for 
death, 0.71). We calculated that 230 events would need to be observed in order for the trial 
to detect this effect with 80% power and at a one-sided significance level of 0.046 (to 
preserve an overall 0.05 level with three interim analyses) with the use of the log-rank test. 
Significance levels for the interim and final analyses were determined by means of an alpha-
spending function defining the O’Brien–Fleming boundaries.17 The enrollment goal was 725 
eligible patients, to be enrolled at a rate of 160 patients per year. After the incorporation of a 
10% inflation rate for ineligibility and loss to follow-up, we calculated that the target 
enrollment was 810 patients.

 Outcome times were calculated from the date of randomization to the date of treatment 
failure or the date of last follow-up. Overall survival was estimated by the Kaplan–Meier 
method, with treatment groups compared with the use of the log-rank test and the Cox 
proportional-hazards model used to compute hazard ratios.18–20 The rates of disease-specific 
death, distant metastasis, non–disease-specific death, disease progression, and second and 
third biochemical recurrence were estimated by means of cumulative incidence functions.21 
We used Gray’s test to compare treatments and the Fine–Gray model to calculate hazard 
ratios.22,23 Adverse events were graded according to the Cooperative Group Common 
Toxicity Criteria and the RTOG Acute and Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring system.16 
Between-group differences in the frequencies of adverse events were evaluated with the use 
of the chi-square test.
Subgroup analyses were performed within well-known prognostic classes to better 
understand treatment effects on overall survival and distant metastases. These post hoc 
analyses were performed within the following categories: PSA level at trial entry (<0.7 ng 
per milliliter vs. 0.7 to 1.5 ng per milliliter vs. >1.5 ng per milliliter), Gleason score (2 to 6 
vs. 7 vs. 8 to 10, on a scale from 2 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis), 
and the presence of positive surgical margins (yes vs. no). Treatment groups were compared 
with the use of log-rank tests for overall survival and Gray’s test for distant metastases.19,22 
In addition, interaction effects between each factor and treatment were formally tested. To 
further investigate treatment and other characteristics jointly in relation to outcomes, we 
conducted stepwise multivariate modeling using the Cox model for overall survival and the 
Fine–Gray model for end points with competing risks.19,22
RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS
From March 1998 through March 2003, a total of 840 patients underwent randomization 
(Fig. 1). A total of 79 patients were ineligible (1 did not sign the consent form) and 1 
withdrew consent, leaving 760 eligible patients for evaluation (384 patients in the 
bicalutamide group and 376 in the placebo group). The two groups were well balanced with 
respect to demographic and tumor-related characteristics (Table 1). The median age of the 
patients was 65 years, and the median PSA level at trial entry was 0.6 ng per milliliter. The 
median follow-up among the surviving patients was 13 years. The median interval between 
surgery and the first detectable PSA level was 1.4 years, and the median interval between 
surgery and trial entry was 2.1 years.
ADHERENCE
Radiation-therapy review was used to evaluate the total radiation dose, field borders, 
fractionation, and field administration in a randomly selected subgroup of patients, given 
that standard techniques were being used. Adherence to the protocol was well balanced 
between the two trial groups, with 64.8% of the patients treated per protocol, 30.8% treated 
with an acceptable variation, and 4.4% treated with an unacceptable variation. The 
percentage of patients who adhered to the assigned regimen, which was defined as 
continuing to take the tablets for at least 18 months, was 69.8% in the bicalutamide group

 and 74.7% in the placebo group. At 24 months (the treatment duration designated by the 
protocol), the adherence rates were 67.2% and 68.6%, respectively.
END POINTS
The end-point results at 12 years are shown in Figures 2 and 3 and in Table 2. A total of 21 
patients in the bicalutamide group died from prostate cancer, as compared with 46 in the 
placebo group (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The actuarial rate of overall 
survival at 12 years was 76.3% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 71.3% in the 
placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.99; two-
sided P = 0.04) (Fig. 2A). The 12-year incidence of death from prostate cancer was 5.8% in 
the bicalutamide group, as compared with 13.4% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.49; 
95% CI, 0.32 to 0.74; P<0.001) (Fig. 2C).
The cumulative incidence of distant metastases at 12 years was 14.5% in the bicalutamide 
group, as compared with 23.0% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46 to 
0.87; P = 0.005) (Fig. 2D). The cumulative incidence of a second biochemical recurrence at 
12 years was 44.0% in the bicalutamide group, as compared with 67.9% in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.58; P<0.001) (Fig. S1B in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Multivariate analyses of overall survival showed that the significant negative prognostic 
factors were assignment to the placebo group, a PSA level of more than 1.5 ng per milliliter 
at trial entry, a Gleason score for prostate cancer of 8 to 10 on the basis of pathological 
testing, a Karnof-sky performance-status score of 80 or 90, and an age of 65 years or more 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Other stratification variables (the PSA nadir 
after surgery, positive surgical margin, and whether short-term androgen-deprivation therapy 
had been given before surgery) did not meet prespecified significance levels and were not 
part of the final model. The rates of local disease progression and any form of disease 
progression including a second biochemical recurrence were all lower in the bicalutamide 
group than in the placebo group (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
ADVERSE EVENTS
There was no significant between-group difference in the risk of non–disease-specific death 
(Table 2). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of early urinary, 
bowel, or hematologic reactions. Late genitourinary adverse events of grade 3 occurred in 
7.0% of the patients in the bicalutamide group and in 6.0% of those in the placebo group; 
grade 4 events occurred in 0.3% and 0.8%, respectively. Late grade 2 hepatic toxic effects 
occurred in 1.6% of the patients in the bicalutamide group and in 0.8% of those in the 
placebo group; grade 3 effects occurred in 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively. The rate of 
cardiovascular deaths that were reported as adverse events was not significantly higher in the 
bicalutamide group than in the placebo group. Details are provided in Tables S5, S6, and S7 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
The rates of hot flashes of grade 1, 2, and 3 were similar in the two groups: grade 1 hot 
flashes were reported in 16.6% of the patients in the bicalutamide group, grade 2 in 4.5%, 
and grade 3 in 0.8%; the corresponding values in the placebo group were 14.1%, 2.9%, and

 0%. In contrast, gynecomastia of grade 1 was reported in 42.4% of the patients in the 
bicalutamide group, grade 2 in 23.6%, and grade 3 in 3.7% (resulting in 69.7% of the 
patients in the bicalutamide group having gynecomastia); the corresponding values in the 
placebo group were 8.8%, 2.1%, and 0% (resulting in 10.9% of the patients in the placebo 
group having gynecomastia) (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Although the rate of 
gynecomastia was significantly higher in the bicalutamide group than in the placebo group, 
this finding was not significantly linked as an explanation in patients taking less than the full 
course of oral tablets.
SUBGROUP ANALYSES
Post hoc subgroup analyses were performed according to well-known prognostic factors. 
These factors included the PSA level at trial entry, the Gleason score for prostate cancer, and 
whether the tumor margins were positive (Table 1). The greatest overall survival benefit was 
seen in subgroups of patients with more aggressive prostate cancer, such as those with a high 
PSA level at trial entry (1.5 to 4.0 ng per milliliter) or a Gleason score of 7. Few patients in 
the trial had a Gleason score of 8, 9, or 10; the difference in overall survival within this 
subgroup did not reach statistical significance (Figs. 2B and 3). Patients with positive 
surgical margins also appeared to have a larger benefit than those with negative surgical 
margins (Fig. S1A in the Supplementary Appendix). With the exception of PSA level, 
interaction tests did not indicate a significant differential benefit in subgroups that were 
defined according to these factors. A similar lower rate of distant metastases in the 
bicalutamide group was also seen among patients with a Gleason score of 8 to 10, those with 
a PSA level of 1.5 to 4.0 ng per milliliter at trial entry, and those with positive surgical 
margins (Table 2, and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). A significant variation in the 
extent of benefit across subgroups was not found.
DISCUSSION
This randomized trial showed that the addition of 24 months of bicalutamide to salvage 
radiation therapy resulted in higher rates of overall survival and other important end points 
among surgery-treated patients with persistent or recurrent disease that was detected only 
because of an abnormal PSA level. Because of the relatively slow nature of prostate-cancer 
progression, a median follow-up of more than a decade was necessary to observe this 
benefit. The 12-year overall survival benefit with antiandrogen therapy was accompanied by 
significantly lower rates of disease-specific death, distant metastases, and second 
biochemical recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed that the factors predicting higher rates 
of overall survival included assignment to the bicalutamide group, a lower PSA level at trial 
entry (1.6 to 4.0 ng per milliliter), and younger patient age (<65 years). The between-group 
differences in other stratification variables (PSA nadir after surgery, positive surgical margin, 
and whether short-term androgen-deprivation therapy had been given before surgery) were 
not significant for differences in overall survival. Given the lower rate of death (absolute 
difference, 5.0 percentage points) and the lack of evidence of higher other-cause mortality in 
the bicalutamide group than in the placebo group, we calculated that 20 patients would need 
to be treated with bicalutamide to avoid one death over a 12-year period.24

 These gains were achieved without the exacerbation of early or late bladder, bowel, 
hematologic, or hepatic effects, for which the rates were low in the two groups. 
Bicalutamide was not associated with a significantly higher risk of cardiac death or serious 
hepatotoxic effects. Cardiovascular mortality was similar in the two groups, as was seen in 
three previous RTOG phase 3 trials assessing the use or nonuse of androgen-deprivation 
therapy.25–27 However, only data on cardiac events that were reported as adverse events were 
collected, which may have introduced an ascertainment bias.
Wirth and colleagues reported the results of the Early Prostate Cancer Program, a series of 
randomized, double-blind trials comparing 150 mg of bicalutamide with placebo.28 They 
found that the rates of cardiovascular death were low and similar in the bicalutamide group 
and the placebo group (3.5% and 3.1%, respectively). In contrast, they found significant 
differences between the bicalutamide group and the placebo group in the rates of 
gynecomastia (68% vs. 8%) and patients’ withdrawal from the trial or stopping of the tablets 
because of gynecomastia (17% vs. 1%). The double-blind design of the Early Prostate 
Cancer Program trials, like ours, did not allow for preemptive measures to minimize 
gynecomastia.
The gains in overall and metastasis-free survival in this trial may be greater among patients 
whose disease had particular prognostic features — namely, patients with higher Gleason 
scores (8 to 10), a higher PSA level at trial entry (0.7 to 4.0 ng per milliliter), or positive 
surgical margins. Although this post hoc risk analysis is hypothesis-generating, it also 
suggests that patients with a lower Gleason score (=7), a PSA level of less than 0.7 ng per 
milliliter, or negative surgical margins may have less benefit from the addition of 
antiandrogen therapy to salvage radiation therapy.
Now, 20 years after this trial was designed, GnRH agonists have superseded bicalutamide as 
the first-choice hormonal therapy with radiation therapy, and bicalutamide at the 150-mg 
dose level is not approved for this purpose. Randomized trials involving patients with 
nonmetastatic disease have shown that high-dose bicalutamide and GnRH agonists have 
similar systemic anti-cancer efficacy.11,12,28 As such, our trial presents proof of principle 
that the addition of hormone-based therapy to salvage radiation therapy is associated with 
significant and clinically important lower rates of prostate-cancer metastases and death. The 
fully enrolled RADICALS-HD (Radiotherapy and Androgen Deprivation in Combination 
after Local Surgery) trial in the United Kingdom and the GETUG-16 (Group d’Étude des 
Tumeurs Urogénitales 16) trial in France are examining the role of contemporary androgen-
deprivation therapy in the context of salvage radiation therapy, and these two trials may 
provide additional insights as these data mature.29,30
In conclusion, the addition of an antiandrogen agent to salvage radiation therapy resulted in 
higher rates of overall, disease-specific, and metastasis-free survival than radiation therapy 
plus placebo among patients who were treated for biochemical (PSA) recurrence of prostate 
cancer after radical prostatectomy. The higher rate of overall survival with antiandrogen 
therapy than with placebo became evident in the second decade after therapy.

 Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Estimates of Overall Survival and Cumulative Incidence Estimates of 
Rates of Death from Prostate Cancer and of Metastatic Prostate Cancer
All patients underwent radiation therapy in addition to receiving either antiandrogen therapy 
with bicalutamide or placebo. The overall survival analysis among patients with a PSA level 
of more than 1.5 ng per milliliter at trial entry was a post hoc analysis. Death from prostate 
cancer included all deaths from prostate cancer or treatment complications as well as death 
from an unknown process in patients with active prostate cancer on the basis of central 
review.

 Figure 3. Effect of Antiandrogen Therapy with Bicalutamide on 12-Year Overall Survival
All patients underwent radiation therapy in addition to receiving either antiandrogen therapy 
with bicalutamide or placebo. The scale for the Gleason score ranges from 2 to 10, with 
higher scores indicating a worse prognosis. Data on the Gleason score were missing for one 
patient in each group. P values were calculated with the use of the log-rank test.

*All the patients underwent radiation therapy in addition to receiving either antiandrogen therapy with bicalutamide or placebo. There were no 
significant between-group differences in the characteristics listed here. PSA denotes prostate-specific antigen.
†Race and ethnic group were self-reported, unless the data were missing, in which case race and ethnic group were determined by the investigator.
‡The Karnofsky performance-status score is assessed on a 100-point scale, with lower numbers indicating greater disability. 
§The scale for the Gleason score ranges from 2 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis.
¶A T stage of T2 indicates that the tumor is palpable and confined to the prostate, and a stage of T3 that the tumor is palpable with extension 
beyond the prostatic capsule.
