Background-—Novel interventions are needed to improve lifestyle and prevent noncommunicable diseases, the leading cause of
death and disability globally. This study aimed to systematically review, synthesize, and grade scientific evidence on effectiveness
of novel information and communication technology to reduce noncommunicable disease risk.
Methods and Results-—We systematically searched PubMed for studies evaluating the effect of Internet, mobile phone, personal
sensors, or stand-alone computer software on diet, physical activity, adiposity, tobacco, or alcohol use. We included all
interventional and prospective observational studies conducted among generally healthy adults published between January 1990
and November 2013. American Heart Association criteria were used to evaluate and grade the strength of evidence. From 8654
abstracts, 224 relevant reports were identified. Internet and mobile interventions were most common. Internet interventions
improved diet (N=20 studies) (Class IIa A), physical activity (N=33), adiposity (N=35), tobacco (N=22), and excess alcohol (N=47)
(Class I A each). Mobile interventions improved physical activity (N=6) and adiposity (N=3) (Class I A each). Evidence limitations
included relatively brief durations (generally <6 months, nearly always <1 year), heterogeneity in intervention content and
intensity, and limited representation from middle/low-income countries.
Conclusions-—Internet and mobile interventions improve important lifestyle behaviors up to 1 year. This systematic review
supports the need for long-term interventions to evaluate sustainability. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003058 doi: 10.1161/

oncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading
cause of mortality and morbidity globally, accounting
for 65% of deaths and 54% of disability-adjusted life-years in
2010.1,2 Suboptimal lifestyle is the major cause of NCDs,
including poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco, adiposity, and
excess alcohol.2 Clearly, novel interventions to improve
lifestyle and prevent NCDs are urgently required. In recent
years, the evidence for effectiveness of conventional clinic-
based education3 and policy4 approaches to improve lifestyle
has been systematically evaluated. In comparison, the
effectiveness of more novel information and communication
technologies, such as Internet and mobile applications, to
improve lifestyle is not well established. Such technologies
are particularly promising because of potential for scalability,
low cost, use in multiple settings including middle- and low-
income nations, and opportunities for real-time modifications
and improvements. Numerous small trials have been reported,
but their findings have not been systematically reviewed.

graded the evidence for effectiveness of such interventions to
improve diet, adiposity, tobacco, physical inactivity, and
excess alcohol.
Methods
Search Strategy and Study Selection
Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically
searched PubMed for all interventional trials (randomized,
quasi-experimental) and prospective observational cohorts
evaluating the effect of novel information and communication
technologies on diet habits, adiposity, physical inactivity,
tobacco (ie, smoking cessation), and excess alcohol among
adults. Eligible technologies included those based on Internet,
mobile (text messages, cellphone calls, smartphone apps),
personal digital assistant, and social media applications, as
well personal sensors (eg, pedometers, accelerometers). The
full search strategy including search terms is provided in
Datas S1 through S4.
Studies were excluded if cross-sectional, ecological, or lab
experiments
(hypothetical
situations);
conducted
among
people with underlying prevalent disease related to the study
outcome (eg, cardiovascular disease, except diabetes); only
evaluating intervention feasibility or acceptability; or only
evaluating changes in knowledge, awareness, or attitude. We
also excluded studies with fewer than 50 subjects, or duration
<1 week. Additionally, we excluded studies published prior to
1990 (because of our focus on novel technologies) or
conducted only among children (because of our focus on
NCDs). For diet and adiposity, our searches identified several
prior systematic reviews on information and communication
technologies; for these targets, we included prior identified
investigations and searched for additional original articles
published after the time period of search of these reports
(after January 2011). Titles and abstracts of all identified
articles were screened by 1 investigator; and full texts were
reviewed by 1 investigator after 10% of the articles were
reviewed independently and in duplicate by 2 investigators
until 100% concordance was achieved.
Data Extraction
Using a standardized electronic format, data were extracted
by 1 investigator on first author name, publication year,
study location, design, population characteristics (sample
size, age, race, sex, education), intervention characteristics
(description, components, duration), study outcomes (de-
scription, assessment method), and intervention effective-
ness (effect measure, uncertainty estimates). To ensure
accuracy and quality of data extraction, data from 10% of
studies were extracted by 2 investigators in independently
and in duplicate.
Assessment of Effectiveness
In some studies, the technology intervention was compared to
usual care or minimal intervention (eg, printed leaflets); and in
other studies, to intensive, non-technology-based, behavioral
interventions (eg, standard-of care clinical counseling). Thus,
the various “control groups” received mixed interventions with
varying degrees of intensity. For studies including a usual care
or minimal intervention control group, intervention effective-
ness was evaluated by comparing the change in lifestyle
target between the 2 groups. These studies provide direct
evidence for effectiveness of the intervention, compared to
usual care.
For studies having a control group receiving more intensive
behavioral interventions (and for quasi-experimental studies
with no control), we evaluated intervention effectiveness
based on change in the target lifestyle from pre- to
postintervention within the intervention group. This provides
better comparability of findings to studies with minimal
intervention controls. However, because such results could be

 confounded by participation (Hawthorne effect), we also
reviewed and summarized the findings from the comparison
groups whenever relevant.
We generally separately evaluated each lifestyle target.
Because many studies jointly evaluated diet and adiposity,
these 2 lifestyle targets were considered and reviewed
together.
Evidence Grading
Two investigators reviewed and graded the evidence inde-
pendently and in duplicate, based on the American Heart
Association criteria for evidence grading (Table 1).5 Briefly,
Class of recommendation (I, IIa, IIb, III) was determined based
on the consistency of evidence for benefits and effectiveness
of the intervention; and Level of evidence (A, B, C) was
determined based on the number and types of studies (eg,
clinical trials, nonrandomized studies) used to assess the
intervention.
This study did not meet the definition of human subjects
research because no identifiable private information was
obtained for this research.
Results
Diet and Adiposity
Of 3602 abstracts screened, 65 original articles met inclusion
criteria (Figure 1). These included 47 randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) and 18 quasi-experimental studies. Thirty-seven
studies were conducted in the United States; 26 in other high-
income countries (Australia, United Kingdom, New Zealand,
Belgium, The Netherlands, Austria, Korea, Japan, Germany);
and 2 in middle-income countries (Iran, Brazil).6 Settings
included community, worksite, university/college, hospital/
clinic, church, health club, and online populations. Study
durations ranged from 1 week (examining effects of an
Internet
intervention
on
fruit
intake7)
to
37 months

*Studies published after 2011.
†Most studies included both men and women, with greater numbers of women than men in the majority (80%) of studies.
‡Mean age of participants was between 30 and 60 years in more than 75% of the studies.
§Numbers of participants ranged from 50 to 9600, with 19 studies having 50 to 99, 30 having 100 to 499, 8 having 500 to 999, and 8 having 1000+ participants.
||Internet interventions mostly used a website to provide general information on healthy eating and weight management; individually tailored messages on healthy eating and weight
management; individually tailored dietary and exercising plans; goal-setting and self-monitoring; and social support from professionals or other group members. Email reminders were used
in some studies to reinforce the intervention.
¶Mobile interventions included text messages, cellphone calls, or smartphone apps.
#Interventions using Internet and mobile phones.
**Dietary outcomes included change in intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, dietary fiber, total fat, saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and total energy.
††The Class and Grade was determined using the American Heart Association criteria for evidence grading5 and after assessment of the findings of all identified studies (published before
and after 2011).
‡‡Adiposity outcomes included change in body mass index, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist–hip ratio, skinfold thickness, and body fat.

 (examining effects of an Internet intervention on weight
loss).8 Most studies had durations between 6 weeks and
6 months; only 10 studies had durations >1 year. Details on
the intervention strategies and dietary and adiposity out-
comes are provided in Table 2.
We also identified 5 prior systematic reviews evaluating
relevant studies published prior to January 2011, each
including from 7 to 36 studies.9–13 Table 3 summarizes the
characteristics and findings of these reviews.
Of 35 studies (22 RCTs, 13 quasi-experimental) assessing
Internet interventions and adiposity, 24 (69%) reported
significant improvements following the intervention (Table 2).
Findings were similar, limited only to RCTs, with reduced
adiposity in 13 of 22 (59%) trials. In studies reporting
significant weight reduction, the magnitude of weight change
ranged from 1 to 6 kg after 6 months of follow-up. Of 9
studies comparing Internet interventions with higher intensity
conventional interventions (rather than usual care/minimal
intervention), 4 reported significantly higher weight reduction
in the Internet intervention group, 4 showed both interven-
tions were equally effective in reducing adiposity, and 1
showed no significant effect in either of the intervention
groups. In a meta-analysis of 23 RCTs evaluating the effect of
the Internet component of weight loss programs, using the
Internet resulted in 0.68 kg (95% CI: 0.08, 1.29 kg) additional
weight reduction over a period of 3 to 30 months.9 However,
stratified analysis suggested that such interventions were
effective when used in combination with in-person counseling
(�1.93 kg; 95% CI: �2.71, �1.15 kg), rather than as a
substitute for that (�0.19 kg, 95% CI: �0.87, 0.49 kg).
Twenty studies (15 RCTs, 5 quasi-experimental studies)
evaluated Internet interventions and diet. Fourteen (10 RCTs
and 4 quasi-experimental; 70%) found significant dietary
improvements following the intervention. Effect sizes varied
due to heterogeneity in dietary targets. As an example, the
intake of fruit, the most common dietary target across
studies, increased by �1 serving/day. Five of these 20
studies compared Internet intervention with higher-intensity
conventional interventions: 2 showed significantly greater
dietary effects in the Internet group, 2 showed both
interventions were equally effective, and 1 showed no
significant effect in either intervention arm.
Of 3 studies (2 RCTs, 1 quasi-experimental) evaluating
mobile interventions and adiposity, 2 found significant
reductions in adiposity.14,15 Two RCTs assessed mobile-based
interventions and fruit/vegetable intake; each found signifi-
cant improvement (by 2 and 4 servings/day)14,16 One of
these compared a mobile intervention to an established
conventional intervention, finding a greater effect in the
mobile intervention group.14 In a prior systematic review of 14
mobile trials (2007–2010) focused on text messages and
lasting from 2 weeks to 12 months (Table 3), 11 studies

Fourteen RCTs and 2 quasi-experimental studies evaluated
combined Internet/mobile interventions and adiposity. Most
(13 of 16, 81%) reported significant reduction in adiposity. Of
6 studies that compared combined interventions with con-
ventional interventions, 4 reported significantly higher effect
on adiposity in the combined intervention group. Of 5 RCTs
evaluating combined interventions and diet, 3 found signifi-
cant improvement in dietary intake.17–20 Of 2 studies
assessing combined interventions and conventional interven-
tions, 1 reported significantly higher effect on diet in the
combined intervention group and 1 reported no effect in
either intervention group.
Physical Activity
Of 2855 abstracts screened, 55 RCTs and 16 quasi-
experimental studies were identified (Figure 2). Thirty-three
studies were from the United States, 35 from other high-
income countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Den-
mark, Finland, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland,
Switzerland, The Netherlands, United Kingdom), and 3 from
middle-income countries (Brazil, Taiwan). Studies were con-
ducted in different settings including worksites, colleges,
hospitals,
churches, and
in
online
communities.

 durations ranged from 1 week to 5 years, with most lasting
between 6 weeks and 6 months (Table 4).
Of the 33 Internet interventions (29 RCTs and 4 quasi-
experimental), 29 (88%) reported significant improvement in
physical activity (Table 4). Among RCTs, 25 of 29 (86%) found
improved physical activity after the intervention. Of 2 RCTs
comparing Internet interventions with conventional interven-
tions, 1 reported significantly higher physical activity among
participants receiving the Internet intervention, and 1 reported
no significant improvement in either of the intervention groups.
The measure and magnitude of effect sizes varied across
the studies reporting statistically significant effects. For
example, in studies evaluating total duration of physical
activity, the effect size ranged from 1.5 to 153 minutes/
week. The difference of 153 minutes was reported in a 6-
month study in which participants received immediate
individually tailored computer-generated motivational mes-
sages after completing a monthly online questionnaire.21 In
studies evaluating frequency of physical activity, the effect
sizes ranged from 1 to 1.2 days per week. In studies that
used the odds ratio (OR) of meeting a physical activity
recommendation as the effect measure, the effect sizes were
between 1.3 and 1.5.
Nineteen studies (13 RCTs and 6 quasi-experimental
studies) evaluated personal sensor (pedometer) interventions
alone or along with educational materials, classes, or
behavioral change techniques including goal setting. Of these,
15 (79%) reported significant positive effects. In these studies,
the increase in step count from baseline was between 900
and 4500 steps/day. Examples of other types of effect sizes
reported include the following: 97 minutes/week increase in
leisure-time physical activity22; 32% reduction in percentage
of sedentary participants23; 95 minutes/day reduction in
sitting time24; and 2-day per week increase in walking days.24
In general, studies that included behavioral change techniques
were more effective. Of 5 RCTs that compared sensor
interventions with conventional interventions, 2 reported
significantly higher step counts and leisure walking with
sensor interventions, 2 only found significant within-group
improvements (from baseline) in physical activity, and 1
reported no significant within- or between-group difference in
step count.

*Studies were mostly conducted in predominantly female populations, constituting more than 60% of participants in 48 studies.
†In 49 studies, the mean age of participants was between 30 and 60 years while 10 studies had younger adults (<30 years) and 9 had older participants (>60 years).
‡Population sizes ranged from 54 to 4714. Eighteen studies had 50 to 99, 41 had 100 to 499, 4 had 500 to 999, and 8 had more than 1000 participants.
§Outcomes included different forms of physical activity (PA) such as leisure-time PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, or walking; step count; and physical fitness.
||Common features of Internet interventions included individually tailored messages, goal-setting, self-monitoring, individualized exercise plans, and an online forum where participants
could interact. The interventions were mostly delivered as either an interactive Internet program or an Internet course providing structured information on improving physical activity.
¶Sensor-based interventions utilized only pedometers or accelerometers to promote physical activity. These interventions often included other features such as goal-setting, self-
monitoring, individualized walking plans, supporting educational materials/courses, and group sessions.
#Mobile interventions utilized text messages and other features such as automated voice response system and smartphone applications.

Sweden (n=2), Germany (n=2), Australia, Switzerland, Finland,
and Denmark. More than half (n=27) were carried out in
universities, colleges, or schools; and the remaining in primary
care, workplace, or other community settings. The study
population mostly included adults with unhealthy patterns of
drinking. Most studies evaluated the effect of a single session
intervention consisting of assessment and personalized
feedback over a follow-up period of 1 week to 2 years
(Table 6).
Of 47 studies (41 RCTs, 6 quasi-experimental) evaluating
Internet interventions, 39 (34%) reported significant decrease
in alcohol use (Table 6). Of 41 RCTs, 34 (83%) reported
statistically significant benefits. The only trial that compared
Internet versus conventional intervention reported significant
within-group improvement in heavy drinking days at 3 and
6 months, but no significant between-group differences.

 6-month follow-up among veterans screening positive for
alcohol misuse28; 7 drinks in mean weekly drinking at 3-
month follow-up among risky drinkers29; 16% in heavy
episodic drinking at 1-month follow-up relative to controls30;
and 10 units (100 mL ethanol) in weekly alcohol use at 7-
week follow-up.31 In studies finding benefits and reporting
compliance with drinking recommendation as an outcome,
the OR for drinking within the recommended limit ranged from
1.7 to 3.7.
Discussion
We systematically investigated, synthesized, and graded
scientific evidence for effectiveness of information and
communication technology to improve lifestyle. Our results
support the effectiveness of Internet interventions to improve
diet, physical activity, adiposity, tobacco, and excess alcohol.
Mobile interventions were also found to be effective for
improving physical activity and adiposity. Our comprehensive
review also identified several important research gaps and
potential directions for future research.
We found that evidence on effectiveness of information
and communication technologies mainly came from short-
term (<6 months) experimental studies, with far less data on
long-term effectiveness or sustainability. Additionally, most
studies were in high-income countries and largely included
volunteers who were generally more motivated and more
educated than the general public. This could limit generaliz-
ability of findings, highlighting the need for more evidence
from studies with longer duration of follow-up (>1 year), from
population subgroups (eg, less educated, elderly) and from
developing countries.
Our review also highlights operational challenges in
evaluating the effectiveness of Internet and mobile interven-
tions. Low adherence rate was a major challenge in most of
the studies, in particular in studies with longer durations of
follow-up (>3 months). While, due to heterogeneity in defini-
tion of adherence, the direct comparison of adherence rates

 across studies was not possible, the majority of studies
consistently showed a significant decline in adherence over
time. Similarly, heterogeneity in the content, intensity,
behavioral targets, and duration of interventions made it
difficult to directly compare results across studies, perform
quantitative meta-analysis, or identify specific promising
features of individual interventions. Additionally, few studies
assessed their intervention’s outreach or coverage.
We found that using evidence-based behavioral change
strategies could increase the effectiveness of Internet and
mobile interventions. For example, in studies of the diet and
adiposity, interventions were more effective if adopting
multiple modes of communication, using tailored messages,
and integrating goal-setting and self-monitoring. Similarly, in
studies of physical activity, developing the content of Internet
interventions based on psychological theories of behavioral
change increased the effect of the intervention and retention
of participants. We also found that interaction with providers
could increase the success rate of the intervention. For
example, in studies of smoking cessation, the interventions
tended to be more effective if they included a direct
interaction between smoker and healthcare provider. These
findings could inform development of novel Internet and
mobile interventions that are more effective and have a
greater adherence rate. Many existing policies aiming to
improve population lifestyle behaviors have focused on
conventional strategies such as mass media campaigns,
environment changes, and school-based programs.4 In com-
parison, use of novel information and communication tech-
nologies that provide individually tailored data has grown
more organically (for example, from private industry and
consumer demand, with little systematic use or evaluation).
There is growing recognition of the potentials of such
interventions. For example, the US National Physical Activity
Plan includes media strategies that encourage stakeholders to
incorporate such emerging technologies into programs.32 The
US Community Preventive Services Task Force recently
recommended use of a computer-based Electronic Screening
and Brief Intervention (e-SBI) for addressing excess alcohol.33
Yet, considering the strength of the evidence, our findings
suggest that the application and testing of novel information
and communication technologies should be greatly expanded.
Potential limitations should be considered. Application of
Internet and mobile for health promotion and NCD prevention
is rapidly growing, and this review might not have captured all
the studies that have been published in this field. Although
our findings suggest that Internet and mobile interventions
are promising for lifestyle modification, the effect sizes of
these interventions depend on multiple factors (eg, the
content and components of the intervention) and could be
widely varied across studies and over time. The present study
only evaluated the efficacy of Internet and mobile interven-
tions for primary prevention of NCDs and did not assess their
effect in patients with chronic disease, highlighting the need
for similar evaluation of evidence in this population.
In conclusion, our systematic review supports the effec-
tiveness of Internet and mobile interventions to improve
lifestyle and reduce NCD risk factors. Our findings also
highlight the need for greater evaluation of long-term
effectiveness, sustainability, and assessment of utility in
more diverse population subgroups.
