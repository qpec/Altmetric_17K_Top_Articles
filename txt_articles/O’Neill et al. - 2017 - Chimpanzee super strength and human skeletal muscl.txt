Since at least the 1920s, it has been reported that common chim-
panzees (Pan troglodytes) differ from humans in being capable of
exceptional feats of “super strength,” both in the wild and in cap-
tive environments. A mix of anecdotal and more controlled studies
provides some support for this view; however, a critical review of
available data suggests that chimpanzee mass-specific muscular
performance is a more modest 1.5 times greater than humans on
average. Hypotheses for the muscular basis of this performance
differential have included greater isometric force-generating capa-
bilities, faster maximum shortening velocities, and/or a difference in
myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform content in chimpanzee relative
to human skeletal muscle. Here, we show that chimpanzee muscle
is similar to human muscle in its single-fiber contractile properties,
but exhibits a much higher fraction of MHC II isoforms. Unlike
humans, chimpanzee muscle is composed of ∼67% fast-twitch
fibers (MHC IIa+IId). Computer simulations of species-specific
whole-muscle models indicate that maximum dynamic force and
power output is 1.35 times higher in a chimpanzee muscle than a
human muscle of similar size. Thus, the superior mass-specific mus-
cular performance of chimpanzees does not stem from differences in
isometric force-generating capabilities or maximum shortening ve-
locities—as has long been suggested—but rather is due in part to
differences in MHC isoform content and fiber length. We propose
that the hominin lineage experienced a decline in maximum dy-
namic force and power output during the past 7–8 million years in
response to selection for repetitive, low-cost contractile behavior.

M
odern humans—with some exceptions—are often charac-
terized as a weak and unathletic species compared with
our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees. Whereas chimpanzees
are proficient tree climbers and arborealists (1), our hominin an-
cestors gave up a reliance on the forest canopy after the emergence
of the genus Homo (2). Subsequent evolution in brain size (3) and
cognition as well as advancements in tools and other material
culture (4, 5) have reduced our strict dependence on muscular
strength for survival and fitness.
Since at least the 1920s, both anecdotal reports and more con-
trolled experiments have indicated that the strength of a chim-
panzee can exceed that of a human (6–12). This has led to the now
long-standing proposal that chimpanzees are “super strong” com-
pared with humans. A critical review of experiments (i.e., pulling
and jumping tasks) carried out between 1923 and 2014 suggests
that chimpanzee mass-specific muscular performance consistently
exceeds that of humans, with a differential of about 1.5 times, on
average (SI Appendix, SI Discussion). Hypotheses for the muscular
basis of the chimpanzee–human performance differential have
included higher isometric force-producing capabilities (6–8, 11),
faster maximum shortening velocities (7, 11), and/or a different
distribution of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms than human
skeletal muscle (10, 11). However, to date there have been no
direct measurements of these parameters in the skeletal muscle of
chimpanzees. Yet, if one or more of these hypotheses are correct,
it would indicate a significant (and previously unappreciated)
evolutionary shift in the force and/or power-producing capabilities
of skeletal muscle in either Pan or Homo since these two lineages
diverged about 7–8 million years ago (Mya) (13).
In this study, we present direct measurements of single-fiber
contractile properties and MHC isoform distributions of chim-
panzee skeletal muscle to test these hypotheses. We compare our
chimpanzee data to similar data from humans and a wide range of
other terrestrial mammals. The single-fiber and MHC datasets are
then used to parameterize chimpanzee and human muscle mod-
els. Computer simulation of these models under matched con-
tractile conditions permit a controlled comparison of chimpanzee
and human muscular performance capabilities. Based on our re-
sults, we suggest that the maximum dynamic force and power-
producing capabilities of skeletal muscle has declined during the
past 7–8 million years of hominin evolution, likely due to selection
for repetitive, low-cost contractile behavior.
Results
Using an isolated muscle fiber preparation, we directly measured
the maximum isometric force and maximum shortening veloc-
ity of the skeletal muscle of the common chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes). Data were collected at 15 °C from fibers containing
pure MHC I, IIa, and IId isoforms. The maximum isometric
force (Po) of chimpanzee skeletal muscle ranged from 96 kN·m−2
to 150 kN·m−2, and the maximum shortening velocity (Vo)
ranged from 0.64 to 4.96 L·s−1, depending on MHC type (Fig. 1
Significance
Chimpanzee “super strength” has been widely reported since the
1920s although a critical review of the available data suggests
that the chimpanzee–human muscular performance differen-
tial is only ∼1.5 times. Some hypothesize that this differential
reflects underlying differences in muscle mechanics. Here, we
present direct measurements of chimpanzee skeletal muscle
properties in comparison with those of humans and other ter-
restrial mammals. Our results show that chimpanzee muscle
exceeds human muscle in maximum dynamic force and power
output by ∼1.35 times. This is primarily due to the chimpanzee’s
higher fast-twitch fiber content, rather than exceptional maxi-
mum isometric force or maximum shortening velocities. We sug-
gest that muscular performance capabilities declined during
hominin evolution in response to selection for repetitive, low-
cost contractile behavior.

 and SI Appendix, SI Methods and Tables S1 and S2). These results,
which are taken to be representative of limb and trunk skeletal
muscle in general, indicate that chimpanzee muscle is similar to
humans and other terrestrial mammals in its single-fiber con-
tractile properties (Fig. 1 D and E). Indeed, the Po and Vo of
chimpanzee muscle are not significantly different from humans
(P > 0.05, one sample t test) and are generally consistent with
expectations based on body size scaling (Fig. 1 F and G). Given
these cellular-level results, humans and chimpanzees can be
expected to exhibit commonalities in the molecular properties that
affect single-fiber performance, such as actin–myosin kinetics.
We measured the distribution of MHC isoforms within 35 pelvis
and hind-limb muscles of chimpanzees and found a balanced dis-
tribution of MHC I, IIa, and IId on average (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix,
Table S3). This is in marked contrast to humans, who exhibit a
significant bias toward MHC I fibers in these same muscles and
throughout the limbs and trunk overall (14, 15). Although the ge-
netic basis of skeletal muscle MHC isoform specification is an active
area of research (e.g., ref. 16), the magnitude of the chimpanzee–
human contrast in MHC I fibers appears to exceed the more modest
shifts that may be induced through intense athletic training (∼10–
15%) (17, 18). Furthermore, characterization of fiber-type distribu-
tions in the muscles of lemurs, galagos, and macaques suggests that a
predominance of MHC II (IIa + IId) isoforms (i.e., fast fibers) is
common among primates, as well as other terrestrial mammals
(SI Appendix, SI Methods and Table S5). Indeed, the slow loris
(Nycticebus coucang) is the only other mammal measured to date with
a predominance of slow fibers across its skeletal muscles. Thus, we
suggest that the high percentage of MHC I fibers in human skeletal
muscle is a derived trait within the hominin lineage, rather than a
characteristic of African apes or other nonhuman primates in general.
A salient architectural difference between chimpanzee and
human skeletal muscle is that chimpanzees have longer muscle
fibers (both in absolute and relative length) (19). Longer muscle
fibers have a broader force–length relation that may enhance the
dynamic force, work, and power capabilities of a muscle–tendon
unit (20). Therefore, to estimate the net interacting effects of Po,
Vo, MHC distribution, and muscle fiber length on maximum dy-
namic muscle force and power output in vivo, we designed Hill-
type “chimpanzee muscle” and “human muscle” models that
reflected the parameter differences measured herein and else-
where (14, 15, 19). Using computer simulations, we determined
the maximum dynamic force and power-producing capabilities of
these models at the whole-muscle level.

 a 1.35 times higher maximum dynamic force [chimpanzee (C):
125.6 kN·m−2; human (H): 93.0 kN·m−2] and power (C: 220.7
W·kg−1; H: 163.8 W·kg−1) output than human muscle (Fig. 3).
Similarly, simulation of a series of cyclical contractions pre-
dicted a 1.34 times higher maximum power output from
chimpanzee muscle when the control variables governing
muscle excitation and contractile frequency were optimized
(C: 172.9 W·kg−1; H: 129.2 W·kg−1). These results suggest that
the larger fraction of MHC II fibers and the longer muscle
fiber lengths characteristic of chimpanzee skeletal muscle will
increase their dynamic force and power-producing capabilities
overall. If a chimpanzee-like or macaque-like phenotype charac-
terized the skeletal muscles of the last common ancestor of chim-
panzees and humans, then the maximum dynamic force and power-
producing capabilities of hominin skeletal muscles have declined
over the past 7–8 million years (13).
Discussion
The 1.35 times differential predicted here seems modest com-
pared with popular accounts of “super strength” in chimpanzees.
However, a critical review of the controlled dynamic force- and
power-limiting experiments (6–11) that have attempted to
quantify this performance differential indicates that, on a mass-
specific basis, chimpanzees outperform humans in pulling and
jumping tasks by about 1.5 times on average (SI Appendix, SI
Discussion). Although our simulations do not reproduce the
earlier experimental designs in detail, the close approximation of
our results to the 1.5 times average suggests that muscle me-
chanics—MHC isoform content, in particular—accounts for
much, but not necessarily all, of the measured chimpanzee–
human performance differential. Muscle “static strength,” de-
fined as maximum isometric force-producing capabilities (Po),
is not significantly different between these two species and
therefore does not contribute to their performance differential
(6–8, 10). Of course, linking muscle mechanics to whole-body
performance tasks is difficult due to the complexities that arise
from the many muscle–tendon units with differing excitations act-
ing across joints with variable leverages. For example, in maximal
pulling, chimpanzee performance may benefit from the larger
moment arms of some of their fore (upper) limb musculature (19).
More detailed musculoskeletal modeling and integrated
experimental-simulation work would be required to determine
the contributions of these and other possible factors to the re-
maining 1.15 differential on average. This would also permit a
more precise assessment of the contribution of muscle mechanics
to the task-specific details that underlie the full range of measured
chimpanzee–human performance differentials (i.e., 1.20–2.05 times
across studies, SI Appendix, SI Discussion).
It has also been hypothesized that humans have greater cortical
and/or spinal inhibition of maximal muscle recruitment than
chimpanzees, thereby limiting their muscular performance capa-
bilities in comparison (12). If true, this would further increase the
chimpanzee–human differential; however, we are unaware of any
data that directly support this “inhibition hypothesis.” Instead,
experimental studies indicate that humans are capable of com-
plete (or near complete) voluntary activation of their musculature
when assigned a maximal performance task (e.g., ref. 21). Thus,
the expectation that both species are capable of optimizing their
neuromuscular control strategies in response to the mechanical
demands of a given task appears to be more consistent with
available data.
Our integrated experiment-simulation results indicate that
the skeletal muscle of chimpanzees is better suited for maxi-
mum dynamic force and power output than that of humans,
perhaps reflecting the chimpanzee’s greater reliance on tree
climbing and suspension for survival and fitness. Furthermore,
we propose that the higher fraction of MHC I fibers and shorter
muscle fiber lengths in human skeletal muscle are adaptive for
repetitive, low-cost contractile behavior. MHC I fibers have
high mitochondrial volume densities and capillary-fiber contact
length (17), which facilitate O2 diffusion; short fibers can re-
duce the cost of isometric force output due to a reduction in the
muscle volume to cross-sectional area ratio (22). A high frac-
tion of MHC I fibers can also reduce fatigue by limiting the
muscle’s reliance on glycogen and other intracellular substrates
during contractions (17), which permits more frequent muscle
activations per day in the aerobic range. Indeed, the large
muscle masses (both in absolute and relative terms) in human
hind (lower) limbs (19, 23, 24) further enhance our aerobic range
during bipedalism (25). Taken together, our results provide an
explanation of how chimpanzees can outperform humans in some
muscle-driven tasks (e.g., maximal pulling and jumping) (6–11),
but not in others (e.g., metabolic cost of walking) (22). Our results
may also account for the exceptionally high metabolite concen-
trations found in human muscle compared with chimpanzee
muscle (11).
These data suggest that, although intrinsic muscle contractile
properties appear to be conserved, the hominin lineage was
characterized by an increase in MHC I isoform content and a
decrease in muscle fiber length (19), both of which can impact a
range of muscle-driven tasks. The timing of shifts in MHC content
and fiber length within the hominin lineage is difficult to establish;
however, we anticipate these shifts to have been concurrent with
major transitions in locomotor behavior, increases in daily travel
distances, increases in home range size, or some combination
thereof. The early hominin Ardipithecus ramidus is likely similar to
chimpanzees and other African apes in its body mass to hind-limb
length (26), suggesting that this species still allocated a smaller
fraction of its total muscle mass to its hind limbs than humans. The

ANTHROPOLOGY
 Australopithecus afarensis) exhibit changes in the pelvis and hind-
limb skeleton from Ar. ramidus (27, 28), suggesting an adaptive
shift toward greater overground locomotion about 4 Mya. How-
ever, the proximate ecological trigger for this transition remains
elusive (29). By about 1.8 Mya, Homo erectus had likely reduced
tree climbing to contemporary hunter-gatherer levels while increasing
daily travel distances and home range size, perhaps aimed at en-
hancing diet quality through the inclusion of meat or other low-
abundance foods (26, 30, 31).
Contrary to some long-standing hypotheses (6–11), evolution
has not altered the basic force, velocity, or power-producing ca-
pabilities of skeletal muscle cells to induce the marked differences
between chimpanzees and humans in walking, running, climbing,
and throwing capabilities (22, 30, 31). This is a significant, but
previously untested assumption. Instead, natural selection appears
to have altered more global characteristics of muscle tissue, such
as MHC distributions and muscle fiber lengths. Our integrated
experiment-simulation results indicate that these changes have led
to a general reduction in maximum dynamic force and power-
producing capabilities; however, they have enhanced metabolic
characteristics and endurance capacities of human muscle. Today,
intensive athletic training can mitigate some of our inherent lim-
itations in maximal muscle performance, but primarily through
force enhancement via skeletal muscle hypertrophy (e.g., ref. 32).
More generally, although higher levels of anatomical organization,
such as the size and shape of muscle, tendon, and bone have been
the main targets of evolutionary processes, hominin muscle dy-
namic force and power-producing capabilities have also been al-
tered since the Pan and Homo lineages diverged 7–8 million
years ago.

 Materials and Methods
Animals. Muscle fibers were sampled from three young male common
(P. troglodytes) chimpanzees (age: 5.5 ± 0.2 y; mass: 26.5 ± 6.7 kg). All ani-
mals were housed in an American Association of Animal Laboratory Care
International accredited space with facilities that allowed them to engage in
normal social and locomotor behaviors. They had a dedicated animal han-
dler and a staff of technicians who played and interacted with them daily.
All of our procedures followed the guidelines of the Stony Brook University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Muscle Fiber Preparation. Small samples of skeletal muscle (about 1 cm ×
0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) were removed from the musculus (m.) vastus lateralis and
m. gastrocnemius lateralis of the right hind limb of each animal while under
general anesthesia. The samples were immediately immersed in cold relaxing
solution with 50% (vol/vol) glycerol for overnight transport to The Ohio State
University. All of the solutions used for the storage of bundles and measure-
ments of single-fiber contractile properties followed previous experiments
(33). Upon arrival, muscle bundles were dissected in a dish containing cold
relaxing solution and were stored in fresh relaxing solution with 50% glycerol
at −20 °C. Single fibers were subsequently isolated by dissection from the
bundles for force and velocity measurements. Single, isolated fibers were
mounted in a temperature-controlled experimental chamber, maintained at
15 °C. The fiber was connected at one end to a servo-controlled torque motor
(model 322C, Aurora Scientific) and, at the other end, to an isometric force
transducer (model 403, Aurora Scientific). The motor and transducer were
attached to three-way positioners. The length of the mounted fiber was ad-
justed by moving the motor or transducer to set the resting striation spacing
(i.e., sarcomere length). Striation spacing was determined using a microscope
digital camera and image analysis software. Fiber width and depth were
measured and fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated, assuming an
ellipsoidal cross-section.
Recording Force and Velocity. The fiber was activated by transferring it to a well
in the experimental chamber containing a calcium ion (Ca)-activating solution.
The force/pCa (−log[Ca]) relationship was determined in an initial set of fibers
to determine the maximally activating solution for subsequent force and ve-
locity measurements. The sarcomere length for these measurements was set to
2.40–2.50 μm. The force/pCa relationship indicated that pCa 4.0 was maximally
activating. The active force generated in pCa 4.0 solution was normalized by
fiber CSA to calculate the Po. The Vo was measured using the “slack test” (34).
Each fiber was activated during a series of exposures to a pCa 4.0 solution. A
known amount of slack was rapidly (within ∼2 ms) introduced into the fiber
during each exposure by movement of the motor arm after steady isometric
force was attained and the time required to take up the slack was measured
from the force record (35). Each fiber was immediately stored at −40 °C until
analysis of MHC isoform composition to determine the fiber type.
MHC Isoforms. The MHC isoform(s) expressed in each fiber was identified
using SDS/PAGE. The composition, preparation, staining, and densitometric
scanning of the gels were identical to those described previously (36). The
amount of each MHC isoform in fibers that expressed more than one iso-
form was calculated as a percentage of the total amount of MHC. The three
MHC isoforms that were detected on protein gels were identified by mass
spectrometry. MHC gel bands were excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained
gel and submitted to the Campus Chemical Instrument Center at The Ohio
State University to obtain identification by liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry. The slowest migrating band was identified as fast-type
MHC-IId, with a MOWSE score of 27,153, based on 741 peptide matches. The
band with intermediate electrophoretic mobility was identified as fast-type
MHC-IIa, with a MOWSE score of 23,010, based on 732 peptide matches. The
fastest migrating band was identified as slow-type MHC-I, with a MOWSE
score of 23,070, based on 694 peptide matches.
The MHC distribution was further determined in samples (10–20 mg) of
35 pelvis and hind-limb muscles from three common chimpanzee specimens
not involved in the muscle contractile property measurements. Before each
chimpanzee’s death (of natural causes), it had been living at a zoo or research
institution. The cadaveric remains of each chimpanzee were kept fresh frozen
at −20 °C after death until dissection. For each chimpanzee pelvis and/or hind
limb, the skin and fascia were removed; individual muscles were identified and
dissected free from their attachments. Following the work of others (14), a
2-cm × 0.5-cm × 0.5-cm sample was then taken from each muscle and used to
determine MHC isoform composition in the same manner as for the single
fibers (SI Appendix, Table S3).
Muscle Modeling. Hill-type muscle models were used to investigate the com-
bined effects of Po, Vo, MHC isoform distributions, and fiber length on maxi-
mum dynamic force and power output at the whole-muscle level. The
chimpanzee and human models each included species-specific force–velocity,
force–length, and activation–deactivation relations, scaled from the generic
Thelen2003Muscle (37) model implemented in the OpenSim musculoskeletal
modeling environment (38). Po and Vmax parameters were assigned the mea-
sured Po and Vo values scaled to normal operating temperature (∼35 °C) (SI
Appendix, SI Methods and Table S4). The curvature of the force–velocity re-
lationship (Arel) and activation–deactivation time constants (τact, τdeact) were
calculated based on the average fraction of MHC II (fast-twitch) fibers de-
termined for each species (C: 67%, H: 40%) (39). The distribution of fast-twitch
fibers in humans represents an average of recent MHC measurements (i.e.,
MHC IIa+IIx) (14) and older immunohistochemistry measurements [i.e., fast
oxidative glycolytic (FOG) + fast glycolytic (FG)] (15). To isolate the effects of
muscle on performance, the simulations were conducted using rigid tendons
with fiber pennation angles set to 0°. This ensured that the fiber strain
matched the muscle–tendon unit strain in the simulations.
A salient architectural difference between chimpanzee and human skeletal
muscle is that chimpanzees possess longer muscle fibers on average (19).
Chimpanzee (23) and human (24) musculoskeletal models were used to cal-
culate the average relative fiber length [i.e., Lo/(Lo + Ls)] for each species and
determine the magnitude of the interspecific difference. The two musculo-
skeletal models include all of the same muscles, except that the human model
lacks an m. obturator externus and an m. gluteus maximus superficialis, which
is distinct from the m. gluteus maximus in all humans (23). Based on the pelvis
and hind-limb muscle–tendon units in the two musculoskeletal models, rela-
tive muscle fiber length was 0.59 ± 0.21 in chimpanzees and 0.44 ± 0.25 in
humans. This indicates that chimpanzee muscle fibers constitute an ∼15%
longer fraction of muscle–tendon unit length on average. We incorporated
this difference into our chimpanzee model by increasing relative fiber length
from an initial value of 0.43 to a value of 0.58 (SI Appendix, Table S4).
Muscle Model Simulations. The performance of each muscle model was simu-
lated under two conditions. For the first condition, the muscle was mounted
between a fixed clamp and a mobile, 500-kg inertial load on a frictionless
surface (Fig. 3). The inertial load had one degree of freedom, which allowed
the muscle to shorten from its optimal length (Lo) thereby accelerating the
mass from rest. This simple design approximates the dynamics of a single-burst
muscle-powered acceleration, as in a maximal pulling or jumping task. For
each muscle model and simulation, the muscle was maximally excited and the
dynamic simulation was run for 0.4 ms. The duration of the simulation was
sufficient to elicit the maximum dynamic force and power output of each
muscle model.
For the second condition, an experimental ergometer was modeled as a
muscle mounted between a fixed clamp and mobile clamp on a frictionless
surface (Fig. 3). The mobile clamp had one degree of freedom that could be
slid to shorten or lengthen the muscle from its Lo. This design was intended
to mimic the in vitro preparation used for determining the maximum power-
producing capabilities of muscle in cyclical contractions (40). For each muscle
model, the mobile clamp was prescribed a sinusoidal motion that shortened
and lengthened the muscle by 0.2 Lo, centered on Lo, over three full cycles.
This strain amplitude is similar to direct in vivo measurements of muscle fiber
strain during a range of high-power output activities (e.g., refs. 41–43). We
used a simulated annealing algorithm (44) to optimize a set of control
variables that maximized the average net power of the last full strain cycle.
Specifically, the control variables included the muscle excitation on (ton) and
off (toff) times, as well as the muscle strain cycle frequency (f).
For each muscle model, the optimization problem was configured and
solved using the OpenSim-MATLAB application programming interface (38).
Maximum force and power outputs were expressed in kN·m−2 and W·kg−1,
respectively. The muscle area (m2) and mass (kg) divisors were computed
using the new chimpanzee Po values scaled to normal operating tempera-
ture and then weighted by MHC isoform distribution for each species
(C: 262 kN·m−2; H: 248 kN·m−2) (SI Appendix, SI Methods and Table S4). In all
simulations, maximum muscle force was fixed at 2255.4 N, which approxi-
mates a human m. vastus lateralis (24).
Statistics. Measurements of the single-muscle-fiber contractile properties (i.e.,
Po, Vo) of chimpanzees were evaluated for the effect of MHC isoform com-
position using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with pairwise comparisons
between MHC isoforms. The chimpanzee single-muscle-fiber properties were
then compared with similar data for humans and other mammals culled from
published studies of single muscle fibers at 15 °C. The human dataset includes
a range of populations and ages (SI Appendix, Table S1), with human subject

 data from our laboratory falling well within this range (SI Appendix, SI Methods
and Fig. S2); the mammalian dataset ranges in size from mice (0.025 kg) to
rhinos (2,500 kg) (SI Appendix, Table S2). One-sample t tests were used to
compare the chimpanzee Po and Vo means to the human mean values from the
literature. The scaling relationships of log10 Po and Vo with log10 body mass were
evaluated using phylogenetic generalized least squares (pGLS). The phylogenetic
structure of the analyzed species was taken from published mammalian trees
(45–47). The pGLS parameters were estimated using the Comparative Analyses
of Phylogenetics and Evolution in R package (48) with the parameter lambda (λ)
fixed at 0 (star phylogeny) and 1 (Brownian motion) and empirically estimated
using a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach. The three different model fits (i.e.,
λ = 0, 1, ML) were compared using a likelihood-ratio test. In all cases, the log-
likelihood ratio test indicated that λ = 0 (star phylogeny) provided a statistically
equivalent fit to the other two models and therefore was our preferred model
for size scaling of all mammalian single-muscle-fiber contractile properties.
The distribution of MHC isoforms within 35 pelvis and hind-limb muscles
of chimpanzees (SI Appendix, Table S3) was compared using an ANOVA.
Independent sample t tests were used to conduct pairwise comparisons be-
tween the average fraction of MHC I or slow-twitch fibers in chimpanzees and
humans, as well as between the relative muscle fiber length in chimpanzees
and humans. For the MHC I content and relative fiber-length comparisons, the
same 35 muscles were compiled for the chimpanzee and human samples, with
the exceptions that m. gluteus minimus MHC content was not reported in
Tirrell et al. (14) and m. obturator externus fiber length was not included in
Arnold et al. (24). Exclusion of these muscles from the chimpanzee samples did
not alter the statistical significance of the t-test results.
