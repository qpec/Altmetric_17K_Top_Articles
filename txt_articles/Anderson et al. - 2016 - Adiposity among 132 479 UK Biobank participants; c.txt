Abstract
Background: Policy makers are being encouraged to specifically target sugar intake in
order to combat obesity. We examined the extent to which sugar, relative to other
macronutrients, was associated with adiposity.
Methods: We used baseline data from UK Biobank to examine the associations between
energy intake (total and individual macronutrients) and adiposity [body mass index
(BMI), percentage body fat and waist circumference]. Linear regression models were
conducted univariately and adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity and physical activity.
Results: Among 132 479 participants, 66.3% of men and 51.8% of women were over-
weight/obese. There was a weak correlation (r ¼ 0.24) between energy from sugar and
fat; 13% of those in the highest quintile for sugar were in the lowest for fat, and vice
versa. Compared with normal BMI, obese participants had 11.5% higher total energy in-
take and 14.6%, 13.8%, 9.5% and 4.7% higher intake from fat, protein, starch and sugar,
respectively. Hence, the proportion of energy derived from fat was higher (34.3% vs
33.4%, P < 0.001) but from sugar was lower (22.0% vs 23.4%, P < 0.001). BMI was more
strongly associated with total energy [coefficient 2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36-
2.55] and energy from fat (coefficient 1.96, 95% CI 1.91-2.06) than sugar (coefficient 0.48,
95% CI 0.41-0.55). The latter became negative after adjustment for total energy.
Conclusions: Fat is the largest contributor to overall energy. The proportion of energy
from fat in the diet, but not sugar, is higher among overweight/obese individuals.
Focusing public health messages on sugar may mislead on the need to reduce fat and
overall energy consumption.
Key words: adiposity, obesity, diet, sugar

 Introduction
The global prevalence of overweight and obesity has nearly
doubled over three decades,1 with recent health surveys re-
porting that more than half the adult population in Europe,2
and two-thirds in the USA,3 are now overweight or obese.
Sugar consumption has been implicated as a major contribu-
tor to obesity. There is a correlation between the sugar con-
sumption in a country and its prevalence of obesity.4 The
past three decades of the 20th century saw rapid increases in
both sugar consumption and obesity; however, obesity con-
tinued to increase beyond 2000 in spite of reported falls in
sugar consumption.5 Sugar has little nutritional value be-
yond energy provision and is often referred to as ‘empty cal-
ories’. Furthermore, sugar-sweetened beverages provide
energy but contribute little to satiety.6 Therefore, there has
been increasing pressure on policy makers to adopt interven-
tions targeted specifically at sugar intake,7 such as impos-
ition of a ‘sugar-tax’.8,9
However, the association between sugar intake and
obesity is due to the contribution of sugar to overall energy
consumption, rather than a specific effect of sugar. All
macronutrients, other than fibre, contribute to overall en-
ergy intake and researchers have suggested there may be a
‘sugar-fat seesaw’ whereby individuals who are free to
choose their diets compensate for a change in the consump-
tion of one by a reciprocal change in the other. Therefore,
focusing on sugar in isolation may not be the best ap-
proach to reducing overall energy intake.5,10 The aim of
this study was to explore the relationships between macro-
nutrients, including sugar, and several adiposity measures
in the general population.
Methods
UK Biobank is a very large, general population cohort
study. Between 2007 and 2010, 502 682 participants, aged
40–69 years, were recruited and underwent baseline assess-
ments at 22 centres across England, Scotland and Wales.
Detailed information was obtained via a self-completed,
touch-screen questionnaire and a face-to-face interview,
and trained staff undertook a series of measurements using
standard operating procedures. Following completion of
the baseline assessment, participants were invited to com-
plete an online dietary questionnaire on four occasions:
February, June and October 2011 and April 2012. The
duration of light, moderate and vigorous physical activity
undertaken over the previous 24 h was self-reported using
the Oxford WebQ.11 These were converted into metabolic
equivalents (MET-h/week) by applying weights of 2.5, 4
and 8, respectively, and then summed to derive overall
daily energy expenditure from physical activity. Ethnicity
was self-reported and categorized into: White, South
Asian, Black, Chinese, other and mixed. Smoking status
was self-reported and classified as: never, former and cur-
rent. Participants reported physician’s –diagnoses of previ-
ous and current medical conditions. Height was measured
to the nearest centimetre (cm) using a Seca 202 height
measure, and a Tanita BC-418 body composition analyser
was used to measure weight to the nearest 0.1 kg and body
fat to the nearest 1 g, by bio-impedance. The measurements
were used to derive three measures of adiposity: body mass
index (BMI), percentage body fat and waist circumference.
BMI was derived from weight [kg) / (height (m) x height
(m)] and categorized according to the World Health
Organization definitions into: underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2),
normal
weight
(18.5–24.9 kg/m2),
overweight
(25.0–
29.9 kg/m2) and obese (� 30.0 kg/m2). Obese was further
categorized into: obese 1 (30.0–34.9 kg/m2), obese 2
(35.0–39.9 kg/m2) and obese 3 (� 40.0 kg/m2).
Dietary information was collected via the Oxford
WebQ; a web-based 24-h recall questionnaire which was
developed specifically for use in large population studies
and has been validated against an interviewer-administered
24-h recall questionnaire.11 The Oxford WebQ derives en-
ergy intake (total and from specific macronutrients) from
the information recorded in McCance and Widdowson’s
The Composition of Food, 5th edition.11 The macronutri-
ents studied were: fat, sugar, starch, protein and fibre. For
participants who completed more than one online dietary
Key Messages
• Adiposity is associated with higher intake of sugar; but the association is stronger for fat intake and strongest for total
energy intake.
• Fat is the largest contributor to overall energy intake.
• There is only a weak correlation between absolute energy derived from sugar and from fat. Therefore, targeting high-
sugar consumers will not necessarily target high consumers of fat and overall energy.
• Focusing public health messages on sugar consumption may mislead the public on the need to reduce fat intake and
overall energy intake.

 questionnaire, mean values were calculated from all of the
information provided.
We defined as ineligible for inclusion those individuals:
who might have unintentional weight loss (current smokers
and history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, cancer,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, pul-
monary fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis); whose energy
intake was suggestive of current dieting or under-reporting
(overall energy intake < 1.1 x basal metabolic rate
(BMR),12 with BMR calculated using the Oxford equa-
tions13); or those with implausible outlier values (BMI <
14.9 kg/m2 or > 60 kg/m2, waist circumference or percent-
age body fat more than four standard deviations from the
mean values or overall energy intake > 18 828 KJ14).
We compared men and women in terms of anthropomet-
ric measurements, level of physical activity, total energy in-
take, absolute energy derived from each macronutrient, and
percentage of total energy derived from each macronutrient.
The same comparisons of energy intake were then applied to
the BMI groups. The latter analyses were undertaken for men
and women separately and combined. P-values were obtained
using v2 tests, and v2 tests for trend, for categorical and or-
dinal data, respectively, and Kruskal–Wallis tests and t tests
for non-parametric and parametric continuous data, respect-
ively. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine
the extent to which higher intake of one macronutrient was
associated with higher intake of another. These were calcu-
lated for both absolute energy derived for each macronutrient
and percentage contribution to total energy intake.
The adiposity measures (BMI, percentage body fat and
waist circumference) were treated as continuous, dependent
variables in a series of multivariable, linear regression models
undertaken for men and women separately and then com-
bined. Overall and sex-specific quintiles were derived for
overall energy intake, and absolute energy was derived for
each macronutrient and for the percentage of total energy
derived from each macronutrient. The quintile representing
the lowest level of consumption was treated as the referent
category. The models were adjusted for age and ethnic group,
as well as sex in the analyses of men and women combined,
with subsequent additional adjustment for level of physical
activity. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
version 13 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
This study was performed under generic ethical ap-
proval obtained by UK Biobank from the NHS National
Research Ethics Service (approval letter ref 11/NW/0382,
dated 17 June 2011).
Results
Of the 502 682 UK Biobank participants, 211 066 (42.0%)
had completed at least one of the online 24-h dietary recall
questionnaires. Of these, 78 587 were excluded: 37 514
were current smokers or had comorbid conditions com-
monly associated with unintentional weight loss; 39 673
had energy intake values < 1.1 x BMR, suggestive of
weight reduction diets or under-reporting; 1007 reported
implausibly high values for energy intake; and 393 had
missing data that was required for the calculation of BMR.
The remaining 132 479 participants comprised the study
population
(Supplementary

as
Supplementary data at IJE online). They had a mean age of
56.1 years, 53 720 (40.5%) were male and 127 228 (96.
0%) were White (Table 1). Men had a higher overall en-
ergy intake than women (mean 10 556 kJ/day vs 8793 kJ/
day). Compared with men, women derived a lower per-
centage of their energy intake from starch (23.0% vs 23.
9%, P < 0.001), and a higher percentage from all other
macronutrients including sugar (23.7% vs 22.0%, P < 0.
001). Fat provided the largest contribution to total energy
intake in both men and women. The minimum and max-
imum values for quintiles of absolute energy intake, and
percentage of total energy intake by macronutrient, are

Due to missing or extreme values, we excluded 1594
(1.2%), 1676 (1.3%) and 114 (0.1%) participants from the
analyses of BMI, percentage body fat and waist circumfer-
ence, respectively. Based on BMI, 35222 (66.3%) men
and 40273 (51.8%) women were either overweight or obese
(P < 0.001) (Table 2). Fat was the largest contributor to total
energy intake in all BMI categories (Table 2). Compared with
participants with a normal BMI, those who were obese had
11.5% higher energy intake overall (Table 2). Their absolute
energy intake was higher for every macronutrient. Their abso-
lute energy intakes from fat, protein and starch were 14.6%,
13.8% and 9.5% higher, respectively; but their sugar intake
was only 4.7% higher. Therefore, compared with partici-
pants with a normal BMI, the proportion of energy they ob-
tained from fat was higher (34.3% vs 33.4%, P < 0.001) but
from sugar was lower (22.0% vs 23.4%, P < 0.001). There
were weak correlations between the absolute energy derived
from sugar and the energy derived from starch (r¼ 0.16), fat
(r¼ 0.24) and protein (0.28) (Supplementary Table 2, avail-
able as Supplementary data at IJE online); 13.2% of partici-
pants in the highest quintile for absolute energy intake from
sugar were in the lowest quintile for absolute energy intake
from fat, and 13.3% of those in the lowest quintile for abso-
lute energy intake from sugar were in the highest quintile for
absolute energy intake from fat (Supplementary Table 3,
available as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Figures 1–3 show the results of the multivariable linear
regression models for BMI, percentage body fat and waist
circumference, respectively. When adjusted for age, sex

 and ethnicity, there were clear dose relationships, across
all quintiles, whereby BMI, percentage body fat and waist
circumference where all higher in those with the highest
consumption of starch, fat and protein. The patterns per-
sisted after including physical activity in the models. In
contrast, BMI and waist circumference were only higher in
those participants whose sugar intake was in the highest
two quintiles.
For fat and protein consumption, there was a positive
association between the percentage of energy intake
derived from these macronutrients and all three measures
of adiposity (Figures 1–3). In contrast, there was a negative
association with both sugar and starch. Higher adiposity
was associated with lower percentage contributions from
these macronutrients after taking account of potential
demographic confounders and level of physical activity.
There was no clear relationship between intake of fibre
and BMI, and a negative association with percentage body
fat.
Total energy intake was strongly associated with BMI
(highest quintile adjusted coefficient 2.47, 95% CI 2.39-
2.55,P < 0.001). The magnitude of the association was
greater
than
for
any
individual
macronutrient
(Supplementary Table 4, available as Supplementary
data at IJE online). Of the macronutrients, the associ-
ation was strongest for fat (highest quintile adjusted co-
efficient

1.91-2.06,

and
weakest for sugar (highest quintile adjusted coefficient
0.48, 95% CI 0.41-0.55, P < 0.001). After adjusting for
total energy intake, the association remained positive
for fat (highest quintile adjusted coefficient 0.70, 95%
CI 0.63-0.77, P < 0.001) but became negative for sugar

Discussion
Obesity was more strongly associated with total energy in-
take than the amount of energy derived from any individ-
ual macronutrients. The association between obesity and
absolute energy derived from sugar was less strong than
from all other macronutrients. The strongest association
was with energy derived from fat. There was a positive,
but weak, correlation between absolute energy derived
from sugar and from other macronutrients, including fat.
Fat made a greater contribution to overall energy intake
than sugar in all BMI groups, but especially in the obese
group. Finally, on adjusting for total energy intake, fat re-
mained positively associated with obesity, whereas sugar
was negatively associated. This implies that although obese
participants had a higher absolute intake of sugar; obesity
was actually associated with a lower percentage of energy
intake derived from sugar.
The association between sugar intake and obesity is due
to the contribution of sugar to overall energy consumption,
rather than a specific effect of sugar. A meta-analysis of co-
hort studies showed an overall association between higher
sugar consumption and higher weight, but not in the sub-
group
of
studies
that
adjusted
for
overall
energy
consumption.15 Similarly, two recent systematic reviews of
trials in which sugar intake was increased within the con-
text of isocalorific diets, showed no effect on body
weight.16,17 Therefore, reduction of sugar intake will be ef-
fective at reducing obesity only if associated with a reduc-
tion in overall energy intake. However, researchers have
suggested there may be a ‘sugar-fat seesaw’ whereby indi-
viduals free to choose their diets compensate for a change
in the consumption of one by a reciprocal change in the
other.
Sadler et al.’s recent systematic review of observational
studies demonstrated a strong, consistent inverse associ-
ation between the percentage of total energy derived from
sugar and the percentage derived from fat, corroborating
the ‘sugar-fat seesaw’ hypothesis in terms of percentage
contribution to energy intake.18 However, only two of the
studies examined the relationship in terms of the absolute
energy intake derived from sugar and from fat, and both
studies showed a positive association.19,20 The correlation
demonstrated (r ¼ 0.37) was relatively weak;20 consistent
with our findings.
Intervention studies have examined either weight loss
interventions or dietary supplements. Of three meta-
analyses published in 2013 on trials of reduced sugar in-
take in children, two concluded there was no impact on
weight,16,21 and one reported a reduction in the fixed ef-
fects model22 but not the random effects model. A meta-

 energy consumed,24 whereas advising them only to reduce
fat resulted in a compensatory increase in sugar consump-
tion without a net change in overall energy intake.
Most intervention studies of dietary supplements sug-
gested that increased consumption of one macronutrient
led to a compensatory reduction in the absolute amount of
other macronutrients consumed, but this was usually insuf-
ficient to obviate a net increase in overall energy intake.
Reid
et
al.
demonstrated
that
women
given
sugar-
sweetened drinks compensated by a reduction in the abso-
lute intake of both fat and protein, but nonetheless
increased their overall energy intake.25 The effects were ap-
parent irrespective of whether the drinks were labelled cor-
rectly or mislabelled as diet drinks. Conversely, women
who consumed diet drinks did not modify their consump-
tion of proteins, fats or starch, and had reduced overall en-
ergy consumption, irrespective of labelling. Raben et al.
reported similar results from a study of overweight men
and women.26
UK Biobank is representative of the general population
in terms of age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status
but is unrepresentative in terms of lifestyle. Therefore, cau-
tion should be heeded in generalizing summary statistics,
such as the prevalence of obesity, to the general popula-
tion. This does not detract from the ability to generalize es-
timates of the magnitude of associations. Our study
benefited from a very large number of participants, re-
cruited from the general population across the whole of
the UK. We had sufficient power to undertake subgroup
analyses by sex. We conducted a cross-sectional study and,
therefore, cannot demonstrate a temporal relationship be-
tween diet and adiposity. Thus our results may underesti-
mate the association between sugar/fat and obesity, since
obese people are more likely to be on weight-reduction
diets. However, the proportion of people on diets at any
given time is likely to be modest and most are likely to
have been excluded by removing from the analyses partici-
pants with energy intake less than 1.1 x BMR. Energy ex-
penditure is typically > 1.35 x BMR for all activities other
than bed rest.
Dietary intake was self-reported outside the clinic,
which may encourage more truthful reporting, and was
collected using a 24 h recall questionnaire which produces
more accurate results than a food frequency questionnaire
(the usual approach adopted in large-scale studies).14
Accuracy was further improved by administering the ques-
tionnaire on four occasions and deriving mean values.33 In
addition, online administration of the questionnaires is ex-
pected to minimize any reporting bias due to social desir-
ability. Since social desirability tends to result in under-
reporting of energy intake, we excluded from the analyses
extreme outliers. We excluded 37% of participants; this is
consistent with similar studies which have excluded 21–
67%.27,28
Reports
of
energy
intake
10–40%
below
physiologically plausible values are common.29,30 Since
under-reporting increases with body mass index,31,32 their
exclusion is essential to avoid systematic errors. For ex-
ample, among the 54 578 participants we excluded due to
under-/over-reporting of dietary intake or smoking, obese
people reported having slightly lower energy intake than
people with a normal BMI (7307 vs 7315 kJ/day); this is
likely to be due to either systematic errors in self-reporting
or obese individuals being systematically more likely to
consume atypical diets at the time of assessment, due to en-
ergy restriction diets. A third of our participants completed
only one questionnaire, but sensitivity analysis demon-
strated no change in the findings when these participants
were excluded. Most studies of diet and adiposity are
based on only BMI which does not differentiate between
lean and fat body mass, whereas we could demonstrate
consistent findings across several measures of adiposity, all
obtained objectively via standardized techniques. We re-
peated all the analyses excluding the 4153 eligible partici-
pants who had prevalent diabetes, and the findings were
not substantially altered.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that obesity is asso-
ciated with higher sugar intake, but the association is less
strong than with other macronutrients especially fat.
Focusing public health interventions and messages on
sugar may detract from the need to reduce overall energy
consumption
and
could,
paradoxically,
increase
fat
consumption.
