Abstract
Study Objectives: This study tested the hypothesis that sleep fragmentation (SF) delays wound healing in obese B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J 
(db/db) mice with impaired leptin signaling and type 2 diabetes compared with wild-type C57BL/6J (B6) mice.
Methods: Adult male mice (n = 34) were anesthetized and bilateral full-thickness excisional wounds were created on the back of 
each mouse. Half of the db/db and B6 mice were housed in SF cages equipped with a bar that moved across the cage floor every 
2 min, 12 hr/day for 23 days. The other half of each group of mice was housed in the same room and did not experience SF. The 
dependent measures were number of days required to achieve wound closure, mRNA expression of four inflammatory mediators, 
blood glucose, insulin, and corticosterone.
Results: SF in the db/db mice caused a significant delay in wound healing relative to db/db mice with no SF. Days to achieve 50 per 
cent wound healing were 13.3 ± 0.4 with SF compared with 10.3 ± 0.7 without SF. All B6 mice achieved 50 per cent wound healing 
within 6 days and complete healing after 16 days. SF caused a significant increase in wound levels of TNF-α mRNA only in the db/db 
mice and an increase in corticosterone only in the B6 mice.
Conclusions: The delayed wound healing in obese, diabetic mice caused by SF is homologous to delayed wound healing in some 
patients with type 2 diabetes. The results support the interpretation that altered leptinergic signaling and inflammatory proteins 
contribute to delayed wound healing.
Key Words:  sleep fragmentation; wound healing; obesity; diabetes
Statement of Significance
Sleep disruption impairs glucose metabolism. Patients with type 2 diabetes have disrupted glucose metabolism and commonly con-
front the comorbidity of impaired wound healing. Human skin wounds that do not heal are a significant public health burden. The pre-
sent data show for the first time that sleep fragmentation significantly delays wound healing in obese, db/db mice with type 2 diabetes, 
but not in normal weight B6 mice. The results support the interpretation that studies of db/db mice, an animal model of obesity and 
hyperglycemia, can provide novel insights into the complex relationships among sleep disruption, type 2 diabetes, and wound healing.

 Introduction
The goal of this study was to determine whether sleep fragmen-
tation (SF) impairs wound healing in diabetic mice. This goal is 
framed by evidence outlined below that sleep contributes to the 
interaction among obesity, type 2 diabetes, and wound healing. 
Obesity statistics indicate that more than one in three adults in 
the United States are hyperglycemic and meet diagnostic cri-
teria for prediabetes [1]. World Health Organization data show 
that worldwide, 39 per cent of adults age 18 years and older are 
overweight and 13 per cent are obese [2].
T
ype 2 diabetes, a metabolic disorder estimated to affect more 
than 370 million people [3], is associated with obesity. Patients 
with type 2 diabetes also have an increased prevalence of sleep 
disorders including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [4], impaired 
sleep duration [5], restless leg syndrome [6], and insomnia [7]. 
The discovery that sleep debt causes metabolic changes similar 
to those seen in type 2 diabetes [8] has been supported by many 
studies [9]. T
ype 2 diabetes in adolescents also is a significant 
public health burden [10].
Impaired wound healing is a clinically relevant problem 
[11] and obese, diabetic patients are at increased risk of surgi-
cal site infection [12]. SF impairs immune function [13]. Wounds 
in diabetics are difficult to treat [14] and prolonged inability to 
promote wound healing is a major cause of amputation [15]. 
Medical care for nonhealing wounds is estimated to cost more 
than US$50 billion dollars per year in the United States [11, 16].
The foregoing relationships suggest an association among 
obesity, SF, and wound healing. The present study used a specific 
mouse model of obesity, known to exhibit features of human type 
2 diabetes, to determine whether SF could causally be associated 
with impaired wound healing. The control group was comprised 
of wild type C57BL/6J (B6) mice. B6 mice provide the genetic back-
ground for congenic B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J (db/db) mice, an accepted 
model of obesity and type 2 diabetes [17–19]. The obese, diabetic 
mice are not transgenic animals and arose as a spontaneous muta-
tion in the C57BL/6J strain [20]. These db/db mice synthesize leptin 
and their obesity arises from the fact that they do not express the 
long form of the leptin receptor [21, 22]. We are aware of no previ-
ous studies determining whether SF differentially alters wound 
healing in B6 and db/db mice. The foregoing rationale enabled a 
test of the hypothesis that SF delays wound healing in obese, db/
db mice when compared with normal weight B6 mice.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Adult male db/db (Stock# 000697; n = 22) and wild-type B6 
(Stock# 000664; n = 12) mice were purchased from The Jackson 
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). To consider the potential effects of 
age on wound healing, separate experiments were performed 
using mature adult mice (25 to 27 weeks of age) and young adult 
mice (10 weeks of age). Mice were housed in a temperature and 
humidity-controlled environment with free access to food and 
water. The light:dark cycle was 12 hr light:12 hr dark. All mice 
were fed normal Teklad 8640 rodent chow (Envigo, Madison, WI). 
These studies were reviewed and approved by the University of 
Tennessee  IACUC and adhered to the Guide for the Care and 
Use of Laboratory Animals (The National Academies Press, 8th 
ed., Washington, DC, 2011).
Sleep fragmentation
The two treatment conditions included SF and no SF (Figure 1). 
Mice in each of the two strains were exposed to both treatment 
conditions, and all mice were housed in SF chambers (model 
80391; Lafayette Instruments; Lafayette, IN). During SF, a bar 
moved across the cage floor every 2 min during the subjective 
night (0800 to 2000 hr). When the bar reached the mice, they 
were awakened and ambulated over the bar. Between the inter-
vals of bar movement, the mice remained undisturbed. In the SF 
condition, the sweeper bar was activated 12 hr/day for 23 days. 
The control mice were housed in the same room and did not 
undergo SF. The chambers and the protocol used to cause SF 
were introduced in 2009 [23]. Subsequent studies show that the 
SF protocol alters sleep/wake states in mice by increasing wake-
fulness during the fragmentation period, decreasing latency 
to sleep onset, and increasing EEG-δ power during slow-wave 
sleep [23, 24]. Additionally, this SF protocol induces obesity [25], 
inflammation [26], insulin resistance [27], and cognitive deficits 
[28]. Thus, the SF protocol satisfies many formal constructs of 
validity [29], including internal and external validity.
Wound healing
After 4 days in either SF or control conditions, mice were anes-
thetized with isoflurane in 100 per cent oxygen, and the dorsal 
surface of the mouse was depilated using Nair (Church & Dwight 
Co., Inc., Ewing, NJ). Three days after depilation, mice were 
removed from their cages, anesthetized with isoflurane, and 
a sterile 6-mm biopsy punch was used to create bilateral full-
thickness excisional wounds on the dorsal surface area between 
the shoulders and the pelvis. The foregoing procedures produce 
a skin wound healing model that has been well-validated and 
described in detail [30]. Biopsies extended through the superficial 
musculature (panniculus carnosus). In an effort to limit wound 
contraction [31], the wounds were protected and kept moist 
with a transparent semiocclusive dressing (Tegaderm) that was 
fixed in place with Mastisol (Ferndale Laboratories, Ferndale, MI). 
Following recovery from anesthesia, the mice were returned to 
their respective cages until the end of the experiment.

enced either SF or no SF. Prior to day zero (abscissa), all mice were acclimated 
for 7 days to each treatment condition. On day zero, mice were anesthetized 
and bilateral, dorsal skin biopsy (wounding) was made through the subcutane-
ous muscle (panniculus carnosus). On alternate days after the skin biopsy, the 
mice were weighed, blood glucose was measured, and the wounds were pho-
tographed (Figure 2). On day 16, mice were euthanized and wound tissue was 
collected.

 Analysis of wound closure
Quantitative assessment of wound healing was achieved via 
wound morphometric analyses. Digital images of the bilat-
eral biopsies were obtained immediately after the skin biopsy 
(Figure 1, day 0) and on days 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 16 after the 
biopsy. On days in which the wounds were photographed, body 
weights were recorded, and blood glucose levels were meas-
ured using a Contour Next EA system (Bayer HealthCare LLC, 
Mishawaka, IN). Digital images of the biopsy were analyzed 
using ImageJ [32] to calculate the wound surface area compris-
ing each circular excision. Experimenters performing analyses 
worked in teams to ensure appropriate blinding to the experi-
mental conditions of the mice. The two bilateral, dorsal wound 
areas were averaged, and wound closure was expressed as a per-
cent of the original wound area over time.
Serum, gene expression, and wound assays
Sixteen days after creating the bilateral surgical wounds, mice were 
euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation. A cardiac 
blood sample was obtained for measuring serum corticosterone 
and insulin. Serum insulin (via Mercodia; Cat No: 10-1247-10) and 
corticosterone (via Enzo Cat No: ADI-900-097) were measured as 
described previously [18]. Skin samples (8 mm) from the site of the 
original wound were obtained from all mice by sharp dissection. 
Biopsy samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C 
for gene expression analyses of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
interleukin 1α (IL-1α), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), 
and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2). RNA was isolated from frozen tis-
sues using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and quantified by Nano-Drop 
analysis. cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng of total RNA using 
iScript (Bio-Rad) and gene expression was measured by real-time 
PCR using previously published protocols [33].
Statistical analyses
Wound size as a function of SF and time after wounding was ana-
lyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) evaluating 
statistical main effects due to mouse strain (B6 [n = 12] vs db/db 
[n = 10] in mature adult mice 25 to 27 weeks of age). Post hoc com-
parisons were made with Bonferroni and T
ukey’s multiple compari-
sons tests. The same analyses were used to evaluate data obtained 
from the 10-week-old mice. Data are expressed as mean ± standard 
error of the mean (SEM), and for all comparisons, a probability (p) 
value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. In a second 
series of experiments, wound size as a function of SF and time after 
wounding was evaluated in young adult (10 weeks of age) db/db 
mice exposed to SF (n = 6) vs no SF (n = 6). The results were evalu-
ated using area under the curve for time to reach 50 per cent wound 
closure. Relative mRNA abundance of four inflammatory media-
tors was evaluated with nonparametric Mann–Whitney tests. Body 
weights were compared using student’s two-tailed, unpaired t-test. 
All analyses were performed using Prism 7.0a software.
Results
SF delayed wound healing in obese, db/db mice
Figure 2 shows representative digital images used to analyze 
wound closure in B6 mice and in obese, db/db mice. Figure 3A 
illustrates the effect of SF on the rate of wound closure in B6 
(n = 12) and db/db (n = 10) mice. Half of B6 mice and half of the 
db/db mice experienced SF, in contrast to the other half of the 
mice that had no SF. For all mice, the percent wound closure was

wo-way ANOVA revealed that wound closure was signifi-
cantly slowed as a function of SF (p < 0.0001) and mouse strain 
(p < 0.0001) with a statistically significant interaction between SF 
and mouse strain (p < 0.0001). In the B6 mice with and without 
SF, wound closure occurred by day 16 (Figure 3A). On day 16 after 
the skin biopsy, wound closure was significantly less (p < 0.05) 
in db/db mice with SF (23.2 ± 6.5%) when compared with db/db 
mice with no SF (8.8 ± 2.3%), indicating a delay in wound clo-
sure. Figure 3B shows that in the wild-type B6 mice, the time 
to 50 per cent closure was not delayed by SF. By contrast, SF of 
the obese, diabetic db/db mice significantly delayed the time 
required to achieve 50 per cent wound closure. T
wo-way ANOVA 
revealed that wound closure was significantly slowed as a func-
tion of SF (p = 0.03) and mouse line (p < 0.0001). The interac-
tion between SF and mouse line was also statistically significant 
(p < 0.01). Multiple comparisons test reveal statistically signifi-
cant (p < 0.05) differences in all pair-wise group comparisons, 
except between B6 mice with and without SF.
SF: gene expression
Wound healing occurred more slowly in the db/db mice exposed 
to SF than in db/db mice with no SF
. This result, and the finding 
that SF did not delay wound healing in wild-type mice, encouraged 
measurement of inflammatory mediators (e.g., chemokines and 
cytokines as well as COX2). The chemokines and cytokines chosen 
for measurement are representative of those elevated in the obese 
state. In addition, COX2 has previously been shown to be associ-
ated with wound healing [34]. Figure 4 compares gene expression 
obtained from wounds of wild-type B6 mice (left column) with 
similar measures from obese db/db mice (right column). In B6 mice, 
TNF-α mRNA level was not altered by SF (Figure 4A, red bar) com-
pared with no SF (blue bar). In contrast, TNF-α expression (Figure 4B) 
was significantly (p = 0.03) increased during SF in db/db mice rela-
tive to db/db mice with no SF
. Expression of IL-1α was not detected 
in B6 mice with or without SF (Figure 4C). In db/db mice, SF caused 
a nonsignificant (p = 0.06) increase in IL-1α compared with db/db 
mice with no SF (Figure 4D). There were no significant effects of SF 
on the inflammatory mediators CXCL10 or COX2 (Figure 4, E–H).
SF: body weight, blood glucose, insulin, and 
corticosterone
Figure 5A shows that throughout the study, body weight of the db/
db mice (mean = 64.40 ± 1.32 g) was significantly greater than body 
weight of B6 mice (mean = 29.09 ± 0.48 g). The body weight of all 
mice did not change significantly across the course of the experi-
ments. SF did not significantly alter blood glucose (Figure 5B) 
or serum insulin levels in either obese or lean mice (Figure 5C). 
Serum corticosterone levels were measured as an index of poten-
tial stress associated with SF. These measures revealed no signifi-
cant difference in serum corticosterone levels in B6 or db/db mice 
in the no SF conditions. However, lean mice displayed increases 
in serum corticosterone in response to SF (Figure 5D).

 Mice are sexually mature by about 35 days [35] and rapid matu-
ration is one of the advantages of using mice with known genetic 
backgrounds. Over time, and homologous to humans with type 
2 diabetes, db/db mice can develop significant deficits [19]. We 
conducted a final set of experiments using db/db mice to deter-
mine whether the delay in wound healing caused by SF in mature 
adult mice (25 to 27 weeks of age) would be observed in young adult 
mice (10 weeks of age). The results of those experiments show that

 in the SF condition, the 10-week-old db/db mice (n = 6) reached 50 
per cent wound healing after 14.9 days (Figure 6). This is in contrast 
to the no-SF condition in which 10-week-old db/db mice (n = 6) 
achieved 50 per cent wound healing in 12.4 days. Thus, SF in the 
10-week-old obese mice also caused delayed wound healing.
Discussion
The results show that SF significantly delayed wound healing 
in obese, db/db mice with type 2 diabetes, but not in wild-type 
B6 mice. SF caused delayed wound healing in mature adult and 
young adult db/db mice. The process of wound healing is ini-
tiated by tissue injury and then progresses through stages of 
inflammation, proliferation of epithelial cells, revasculariza-
tion, and scar formation. The forgoing processes are triggered 
by diverse injuries in a variety of tissue types, indicating that 
wound healing is an innate cellular process. The present result 
show that SF disrupts inherent processes involved in wound 
healing. This is consistent with the discovery that SF signifi-
cantly alters fundamental cell biology [25, 27, 28, 36]. The pre-
sent finding that SF delays wound healing in diabetic mice with 
leptin receptor dysfunction is consistent with evidence that lep-
tin promotes skin wound healing [37].
Models of diabetes, SF, and wound healing
A wide range of occupational, situational, or disease states cause 
sleep to be fragmented into short episodes that are disrupted by 
arousals. The heterogeneous causes of SF are a potential con-
found for efforts to understand the health impact of fragmented

(A) Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean and show per-
cent of the original wound area as a function of time after the skin biopsy (days 
postwounding). The number of days required to achieve 50 per cent wound clo-
sure was greatest for B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J (db/db) mice with SF (filled red circles 
and dashed red line) and db/db mice with no SF (filled blue squares and solid 
blue line). The most rapid wound healing occurred in normal weight C57BL/6J 
(B6) mice without SF (filled blue diamond and solid blue line) and with SF (filled 
red triangles and red dashed line). The two left-most vertical dotted lines illus-
trate that the B6 mice achieved wound closure between 5 and 6 days after biopsy, 
and that there was no significant effect of SF. The two right-most vertical, dotted 
lines help visualize the differences in number of days (abscissa) to achieve 50 
per cent wound closure in the db/db mice with and without SF. The results of 
Tukey’s multiple comparisons test are summarized by the asterisks. Post hoc 
comparisons indicated that the db/db mice in the SF condition had significantly 
larger wounds compared with all of the other three groups, except on days 2 and 
4 when the wound size of the two groups of db/db mice did not differ between 
sleep conditions. (B) Group data summarizing the effect of SF on days required

ferences with and without SF. Within mouse strains, SF caused a significant 
increase in the number of days to reach 50 per cent wound closure only in the 
diabetic, B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J (db/db) mice. C57BL/6J (B6) mice without (blue bar) 
and with (red bar) SF healed significantly faster than the db/db mice.

 sleep. This confound has been diminished by development 
of devices and procedures that standardize experimentally 
imposed SF [23, 38–40]. Sleep varies significantly among mouse 
strains and sleep is a heritable phenotype in mice and humans. 
The B6 mouse strain provides the genomic background for many 
genetically altered mice. B6 mice and obese db/db mice produce 
the cytokine leptin but, as noted earlier, due to a spontaneous 
mutation [20], db/db mice do not express the long form of the lep-
tin receptor. This allelic mutation causes db/db mice to develop 
excessive adipose tissue, peripheral nerve damage with sensory 
loss, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia homologous to human 
type 2 diabetes. These phenotypes have encouraged four decades 
of research using db/db mice as a model of type 2 diabetes [19, 41].
The present results are consistent with evidence that human 
wound healing is impaired by obesity [42]. Diabetic, obese mice 
were shown many years ago to be of translational relevance 
for studies of impaired wound healing [43]. The present results 
demonstrate for the first time in db/db mice that SF further 
delays wound healing. The finding of normal wound healing in 
the B6 mice compared with the db/db mice is consistent with 
the earlier finding of no difference in wound healing between 
homozygous db/db mice and heterozygous db/+ control mice 
(Table 1 of [43]).
Pioneering experiments using rats reported that 72 hr of 
total sleep deprivation caused no alterations in wound healing 
[44]. There are three significant differences between the present 
study and the study of sleep deprived rats [44].

Figure 6. Time course of wound area to reach 50 per cent closure with and 
without SF in young, adult B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J (db/db) mice (10 weeks of age). 
Results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean and show per cent 
of the original wound area as a function of time after the skin biopsy (days 
postwounding). The number of days required to achieve 50 per cent wound 
closure was greater for db/db mice with SF (filled red symbols and dashed 
red line) when compared with db/db mice with no SF (filled blue symbols and 
solid blue line). The two vertical, dotted lines help visualize the differences 
in number of days (abscissa) to achieve 50 per cent wound closure in the db/
db mice with and without SF. The two vertical dotted lines illustrate that the 
young, adult db/db mice achieved 50 per cent wound closure between 12 and 
13 days (12.4 days) without SF (n = 6), and that wound closure was delayed 
with SF, occurring between 14 and 15 days (14.9 days) (n = 6). The results of a 
Bonferroni multiple comparisons test are summarized by the asterisks that 
indicate significant differences with and without SF between the groups on 
days 11 (p < 0.0369) and 13 (p < 0.0001).

 First, sleep deprivation and SF are different yet can share 
similar traits. Sleep deprivation is a physiological stress [45] 
as evidenced by decreases in the stress hormone cortisol dur-
ing sleep and increase in cortisol during sleep deprivation [46]. 
Human SF also has been associated with increases in cortisol 
[47]. There are differing results from SF studies in mice that used 
corticosterone as a measure of stress. SF produced by the same 
type of instrumentation as used in the present study has been 
reported to cause both no increase in corticosterone [23] and a 
significant increase in corticosterone [48]. The present measures 
of corticosterone do not resolve these previous equivocal find-
ings and indicate further that the effects of SF on corticosterone 
levels can vary between mouse strains. SF increased corticoster-
one in B6 mice but not in db/db mice (Figure 5).
A second major difference between the sleep deprivation 
study in rat and the present study concerns the nature of the 
skin wound. The present study used a standard protocol to cre-
ate an excisional wound [30, 43, 49, 50]. The skin wound in the 
rat study was created via bilateral, subcutaneous implant of 
5 cm by 1 mm polytetrafluoroethylene tubing.
Third, in the present study, the conclusion that SF delayed 
wound healing was based on direct measures of wound size. In 
the rat study, the conclusion that 72 hr of sleep deprivation did 
not alter wound healing was inferred from biochemical measures 
of DNA, protein, and hydroxyproline derived from postmortem 
tissue. Additionally, the present results obtained from mature db/
db mice (25 to 27 weeks of age) were replicated by a second study 
of young adult db/db mice (10 weeks of age), with and without SF.
Complex comorbidities: SF, diabetes, and impaired 
healing
In patients with type 2 diabetes, a meta-analysis of nearly 4000 
studies indicated that disruption of sleep duration and quality 
alters glycemic control [9]. T
ype 2 diabetes is associated with a 
wide range of sleep disorders including restless leg syndrome [6], 
OSA [51], and insomnia [7]. OSA severity is associated with poor 
glucose control and evidence suggests a causal link between 
OSA and development of diabetes [52].
T
ype 2 diabetes is characterized by a state of chronic, low 
grade inflammation, hyperglycemia, and elevated proinflamma-
tory mediators [53]. Cytokines have multiple functions including 
modulation of immunity, inflammation, and sleep [13, 54]. The 
proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α is increased in type 2 diabe-
tes and obesity [55]. TNF-α has been studied extensively in rela-
tion to wound healing [56] and sleep [13]. There is also evidence 
that increases in TNF-α can contribute to cognitive and behav-
ioral deficits [25, 28, 57]. The inflammatory process is crucial 
for wound healing. Systemic inflammation has been hypoth-
esized to disrupt the normal apoptotic machinery in activated 
immunocytes [56, 58]. This disruption potentially perpetuates 
the inflammatory response to injury and infection. The data 
in Figure 4 show that SF significantly increased wound levels 
of TNF-α mRNA expression only in the db/db mice that experi-
enced SF. This result is consistent with previous studies showing 
that SF increases TNF-α [24]. The present result in Figure 4 may 
reflect the fact that wound cytokines samples were obtained 
on day 16 when all mice, except for the sleep fragmented db/db 
mice, had healed. The data in Figure 3 are the first to document 
the time course to achieve 50 per cent wound healing in B6 and 
db/db mice, with and without SF. Thus, in the absence of prior 
data to guide this study, cytokine samples were taken on day 
16. Chemokines and cytokines are elevated in obesity and, as 
shown here, appear to be further altered by SF. Levels of COX2 
are known to vary with wound healing [34].
Previous reviews have described the impact of sleep, hormonal 
status, and body weight on type 2 diabetes [59]. Figure 7 summarizes 
the complex interactions between inflammation, SF
, glucose intol-
erance/insulin resistance, and obesity, all of which affect wound 
healing. This schematic, however, should not obscure the fact that 
wound healing in diabetes is humbling in complexity and associ-
ated with more than 100 physiological factors [60]. The present 
results encourage application of multivariate analyses to quantify 
the direct and indirect impact of SF on delayed wound healing.
Limitations and future directions
There are many reasons to be cautious about the extent to 
which data from mice faithfully emulate human disease [61]. 
This potential limitation makes it even more remarkable that 
disrupting sleep promotes obesity in humans [5] and in mice 
[25]. Evidence confirming a relationship between SF and energy 
metabolism also emphasizes the good agreement between stud-
ies of mice [62] and humans [63].
The present results are limited to male mice. Human studies 
document sex differences in wound healing [64] and in secre-
tion of inflammatory cytokines caused by sleep restriction [65]. 
It follows that there are male and female differences in the 
prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes [66]. Sex differences 
in leptin levels also vary by mouse strain. For example, in an 
outbred mouse strain (Swiss CD-1 mice), plasma leptin levels are 
significantly greater in males than in females [67]. The forego-
ing relationships, recent discoveries of sex differences between 
B6 and db/db strains [68], and the present results all encourage 
future studies to determine whether delays in wound healing 
vary by sex for db/db and B6 mice.
The present study was designed to determine whether the well-
validated SF protocol causes delayed wound healing in mice with 
type 2 diabetes, not to quantify the role of obesity versus diabetes

Figure 7. Schematic summarizing interacting factors currently known to affect 
wound healing. (A) SF promotes inflammation, in part, by increasing proinflam-
matory cytokines [48, 57, 71, 72]. (B) SF increases glucose intolerance/insulin 
resistance, obesity, and leptin resistance [25, 36, 55]. (C) Inflammation delays 
wound healing via macrophage dysfunction which in turn leads to impaired 
angiogenesis, disorganized apoptosis, and impaired cell migration [73, 74]. (D) 
Impaired glucose metabolism delays wound healing through the sequela caused 
by diabetes such as neuropathy, vasculopathy, and immunodeficiency [75, 76].

 as a potential causal contributor to delayed wound healing. The 
results justify future studies specifically aiming to quantify the 
extent to which SF alters wound healing in obese mice compared 
with obese mice with type 2 diabetes. As demonstrated elsewhere 
[68, 69], such adequately powered studies will require the use of 
male and female B6 mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO), normal 
weight B6 mice, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, and obese, diabetic db/
db mice. Statistical evaluations of such studies require a three-way 
ANOVA model to evaluate potential main effects and interactions 
attributed to mouse line (four levels), with and without SF (two lev-
els), and as a function of sex (two levels). Complex experimental 
designs of the type outlined above must also contend with the fact 
that DIO mice are prediabetic (https://www.jax.org/strain/380050) 
and may develop type 2 diabetes as they age.
In summary, the results support the interpretation that 
experimentally induced SF delays wound healing in male db/
db mice that are obese and diabetic but not in wild-type B6 
mice. These findings, and the biological parallels between sleep 
and metabolism in mice and humans, suggest an association 
between sleep and the clinically significant problem of impaired 
wound healing [11, 16].
