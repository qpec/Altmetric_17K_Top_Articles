Abstract
Episodic memories initially require rapid synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus for their 
formation and are gradually consolidated in neocortical networks for permanent storage. However, 
the engrams and circuits that support neocortical memory consolidation remain unknown. We 
found that neocortical prefrontal memory engram cells, critical for remote contextual fear memory, 
were rapidly generated during initial learning via inputs from both hippocampal-entorhinal cortex 
and basolateral amygdala. After their generation, the prefrontal engram cells, with support from 
hippocampal memory engram cells, became functionally mature with time. Whereas hippocampal 
engram cells gradually became silent with time, engram cells in the basolateral amygdala, which 
were necessary for fear memory, are maintained. Our data provide new insights into the functional 
reorganization of engrams and circuits underlying systems consolidation of memory.
Memories are thought to be initially stored within the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (HPC-
EC) (recent memory) and over-time are slowly consolidated within the neocortex for 
permanent storage (remote memory) (1–7). Systems memory consolidation models suggest 
that the interaction between the HPC-EC and the neocortex during and after an experience is 
crucial (8–12). Experimentally, prolonged inhibition of hippocampal or neocortical networks 
during the consolidation period produces deficits in remote memory formation (13–15). 
However, little is known regarding specific neural circuit mechanisms underlying the 
formation and maturation of neocortical memories through interactions with the HPC-EC 
network. By employing activity-dependent cell labeling technology (16–18) combined with 
viral vector–based transgenic, anatomical (19, 20), and optogenetic strategies (19, 21) for

 circuit-specific manipulations and in vivo calcium imaging (22), we investigated the nature 
and dynamics of neocortical and subcortical memory engram cells (a population of neurons 
that are activated by learning, have enduring cellular changes, and are reactivated by a part 
of the original stimuli for recall (18)) and their circuits for systems consolidation of memory.
We first traced entorhinal projections to frontal cortical structures (the medial prefrontal 
cortex (PFC), caudal anterior cingulate cortex (cACC), retrosplenial cortex (RSC)) involved 
in contextual fear memory, and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), with injections of the 
retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)–Alexa555 into these regions (fig. S1). CTB 
injections resulted in labeling in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) specifically in cells in 
layer Va (Fig. 1A–D, H and fig. S1A–D), indicating that MEC-Va cells have extensive 
projections to the neocortex and BLA (23). We then sought to inhibit these specific 
projections by bilaterally injecting adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8)–calcium/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII):eArchT–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) 
in the deep layers of the MEC in wild-type (WT) mice with bilaterally implanted optic fibers 
above the PFC, cACC, or RSC (Fig. 1E, J, and fig. S2G). Expression of eArchT-eYFP was 
abundant in MEC-Va terminals located in the PFC, cACC and RSC (Fig. 1B, I, and fig. 
S2D). These mice were then subjected to contextual fear conditioning (CFC) while we 
delivered green light bilaterally to the different cortical areas receiving MEC-Va projections 
during either the conditioning period (Day-1) (fig. S2E) or recall test period (Day-2, Day-8, 
Day-15 and Day-22) (fig. S2F). Axon terminal inhibition with optogenetics of MEC-Va cells 
within the PFC during Day-1 of CFC disrupted memory at Day-15 and Day-22, but not at 
Day-2 or Day-8 (Fig. 1F). Terminal inhibition during memory recall tests did not affect 
memory retrieval (Fig. 1G). Finally, terminal inhibition in the cACC or RSC during CFC or 
recall had no effect on memory throughout these periods (Fig. 1J–L and fig. S2G–I).
The above results suggest that MEC-Va input into the PFC during CFC is crucial for the 
eventual formation of remote memory. This hypothesis was supported by several findings. 
First, CFC increased the number of c-Fos+ cells in the PFC compared to that of homecage 
mice (Fig. 1M–O), whereas context only exposure did not increase c-Fos activity in the PFC 
(Fig. 1O). Second, optogenetic terminal inhibition of MEC-Va projections within the PFC 
during CFC inhibited the observed increase of c-Fos+ cells in the PFC (Fig. 1O). Finally, we 
identified CFC engram cells in the PFC. We targeted injections of AAV9-c-fos:tTA and 
AAV9-TRE:channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mCherry (Fig. 1P, Q) and optic fibres to the PFC of 
WT mice and labeled the PFC cells activated by CFC with ChR2 while the mouse was off 
doxycycline (OFF-Dox) (Fig. 1R). Blue light stimulation at 4 Hz, but not the conventional 
20 Hz, of ChR2-mCherry-expressing cells in the PFC induced freezing behavior on Day-2 
and Day-12 in an unconditioned context (Fig. 1S, fig. S3) compared with freezing under the 
blue light-off condition. This blue light-induced freezing was prevented when MEC-Va 
fibers in the PFC were inhibited during CFC on Day-1 (Fig. 1T, U, fig. S4). Using trans-
synaptic retrograde tracing combined with the activity-dependent cell labelling, we 
confirmed that the PFC engram cells generated by CFC receive monosynaptic input from 
MEC-Va cells (Fig. 1V–X, fig. S5).
To examine whether PFC engram cells are also reactivated by the conditioned context (rather 
than by blue light) at a recent and remote time point, we targeted injections of AAV9-TRE:

 human histone H2B-green fluorescent protein (H2B-GFP) to the PFC of c-fos:tTA 
transgenic mice (Fig. 2A). The mice underwent CFC on Day-1 and then re-exposed to the 
conditioned (Context-A) or an unconditioned (Context-B) context on Day-2 or Day-13 (Fig. 
2B). Cells activated by CFC were labeled with H2B-GFP and the cells activated by the 
context test with a c-Fos antibody, and we calculated the proportion of double labeled cells 
(Fig. 2A–B, fig. S6B). H2B-GFP+ cells (PFC engram cells) were preferentially reactivated 
in Context-A on Day-13 but not Day-2, compared to the H2B-GFP negative cells (Fig. 2C). 
There was no difference in c-Fos expression between H2B-GFP positive and negative cells 
when mice were tested in Context-B (Fig. 2C). We also found that the spine density of the 
PFC engram cells on Day-12 was significantly higher than on Day-2 (Fig. 2D, E, fig. S7), in 
line with previous findings of a positive correlation between dendritic spine density on 
memory engram cells and memory expression triggered by natural recall cues (24–26).
To test whether PFC engram cells are necessary for memory recall by natural cues, we 
bilaterally targeted injections of AAV9-c-fos:tTA and AAV9-TRE:ArchT-eGFP (Fig. 2D, F) 
and optic fibres to the PFC of WT mice and labeled the PFC engram cells that were 
activated by CFC with ArchT while the mice were OFF-Dox (Fig. 2F). Cell body inhibition 
of the PFC engram cells by green light during retrieval did not affect recent memory 
(Day-2), however at the remote time-point (Day-12) memory retrieval was disrupted 
compared to the green light-off condition (Fig. 2F).
To further investigate the characteristics of PFC engram cells we monitored transient 
calcium (Ca2+) events in PFC cells in vivo. WT mice were injected with AAV5-
Syn:GCaMP6f into the PFC and implanted with a micro GRIN lens targeting the PFC (Fig. 
2G–I, fig. S8) (22, 27). On Day-1 mice were first exposed to Context-B followed by CFC in 
Context-A. Mice were then re-exposed to both contexts in the same order on Day-2 and 
Day-15 (Fig. 2J). The averaged frequency of Ca2+ events in PFC cells did not significantly 
change in either a time- or context-dependent manner (fig. S9B). However a small but 
significant difference was revealed in the cumulative distribution curves of a rate difference 
index (assessing context selectivity; see Methods) between Day-1 conditioning and Day-15 
recall, and between Day-2 recall and Day-15 recall (fig. S9C). PFC cells did not appear to 
discriminate between the two contexts on Day-1 prior to footshock presentation (Fig. 2K, L). 
However, after footshock presentation, about 11% of cells showed a significant increase in 
Ca2+ transients (shock responding cells; SR cells) (Fig. 2K, L). The remaining ~89% of PFC 
cells did not respond to the shocks (shock non-responding cells; SNR cells). The SR cells 
were less active than SNR cells during exposure to Context-B and Context-A on Day-1 prior 
to footshock presentation (Fig. 2L–N, fig. S9D). During recall, the transient Ca2+ activity of 
SR cells in Context-A (conditioned context) was significantly higher compared to that in 
Context-B on Day-15 but not on Day-1 or Day-2, whereas the frequency of Ca2+ transient 
events in SNR cells remained constant, irrespective of context (Fig. 2M, N). This produced a 
significant rate difference index of Ca2+ activity for the conditioned context between the SR 
and SNR cells on Day-15 but not on Day-1 (excluding the shock delivery period) or Day-2 
(Fig. 2O). These results combined with c-Fos activation data (Fig. 1M–O) suggest that the 
SR cells may be the PFC memory engram cells, given that the generation of the PFC engram 
cells requires both context exposure and footshocks.

 Our calcium imaging data suggest that footshock stimulus input into the PFC is crucial for 
the generation of PFC engram cells. Because the BLA integrates footshock information 
arriving from the thalamus (28) and projects to the PFC (fig. S5I, S10), we optogenetically 
inhibited the pathway from BLA to PFC during CFC (Fig. 2P). Optogenetic inhibition of 
BLA terminals in the PFC during CFC disrupted the generation of PFC engram cells (Fig. 
2Q). The terminal inhibition during CFC also inhibited remote memory formation (Fig. 2R).
To test whether the HPC engram cells play a crucial role in the functional maturation of PFC 
engram cells during the system consolidation process, we bilaterally targeted injection of 
AAV9-TRE:tetanus toxin light chain (TeTX) or AAV9-TRE:eYFP (as a control) to the 
hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of c-fos:tTA transgenic mice (Fig. 3A). When the mice 
were subjected to CFC, DG engram cells were labeled with TeTX. DG engram cell labeling 
with TeTX caused a robust inhibition of DG engram cell output, as revealed by greatly 
reduced immunoreactivity of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2), which is 
essential for activity-dependent neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals (13), 
within the stratum lucidum (s.l.) in hippocampal CA3 in OFF-Dox mice compared to ON-
Dox mice (Fig. 3B, C). Optogenetic activation of DG engram cells with ChR2 failed to 
produce the increase in c-Fos+ cells in CA3 of TeTX-expressing mice that was observed in 
control mice compared to home cage controls (Fig. 3D). TeTX expression in HPC engram 
cells inhibited the reactivation of PFC engram cells during exposure to the conditioned 
context 12 days after CFC compared to the eYFP control group (Fig. 3E, F). TeTX 
expression also blocked the increase of dendritic spine density of PFC engram cells 
compared to the eYFP group (Fig. 3G). In vivo calcium imaging revealed that TeTX 
expression in HPC engram cells after CFC blocked the increase of the context 
discrimination index in SR cells in the PFC (Fig. 3H, fig. S11).
To investigate the post-consolidation fate of HPC engram cells we crossed c-fos:tTA TG 
mice with TRE:H2B-GFP TG mice (29), subjected them to CFC, and then re-exposed them 
to the conditioned (Context-A) or an unconditioned (Context-B) context on Day-2 or Day-13 
(Fig. 3I–K). DG engram cells were preferentially reactivated in Context-A on Day-2 but not 
Day-13, compared to the non-engram cells (Fig. 3L). No difference was observed in the 
activation of DG engram and non-engram cells by Context-B (Fig. 3L). We were unable to 
maintain labeled DG engram cells with ChR2 beyond 12 days with injection of AAV9-
TRE:ChR2-mCherry. To extend this technical limit we targeted injections of AAV1,5,8,9-
TRE:CCre, AAV1,5,8,9-TRE:NCre and AAV5-EF1a:ChR2-mCherry to the DG of c-fos:tTA 
transgenic mice (Fig. 3M). We could thus extend viable labelling by a few days (Fig. 3N). 
The spine density of DG engram cells on Day-15 was significantly reduced compared to 
Day-5 (Fig. 3O, fig. S12). On both Day-5 and Day-15, optogenetic activation of DG engram 
cells induced freezing behaviour (Fig. 3P, Q).
We finally investigated the role of MEC-Va projections to the BLA in recent and remote 
memory (Fig. 4A, fig. S2A). Inhibition of MEC-Va terminals in the BLA during CFC 
disrupted contextual fear memory formation. Retrieval was impaired at all time-points tested 
(Fig. 4B). When terminal inhibition was restricted to retrieval, recent memory tested on 
Day-2 and Day-8 was impaired, but remote memory retrieval on Day-15 and Day-22 was 
unaffected (Fig. 3C). In contrast, inhibition of PFC engram cell terminals in the BLA did not

 impair memory retrieval on Day-2 but did impair memory retrieval on Day-12 (Fig. 4D, E). 
To investigate whether the BLA fear memory engram cells formed on Day-1 are maintained 
and used for PFC engram-dependent remote memory recall, we subjected the double 
transgenic mice (Fig. 4F, I) to CFC and re-exposed them to the conditioned context at recent 
or remote time-points (Fig. 4G). BLA engram cells were reactivated equally well by the 
conditioned context at both recent and remote time-points (Fig. 4H). Similarly, BLA cells 
activated by recent recall were reactivated again equally well by re-exposure to the 
conditioned context at recent and remote time-points (Fig. 4J, K).
Here, we found that PFC memory engram cells for CFC were rapidly formed during Day-1 
training by virtue of inputs from both MEC-Va and BLA, but they were not retrievable with 
natural recall cues. The immature PFC engram cells functionally, structurally, and 
physiologically matured during the subsequent few weeks and this process required inputs 
from HPC engram cells presumably through MEC-Va. In contrast to their formation on 
Day-1, retrieval of the PFC engram at a remote time did not require MEC-Va input. HPC 
engram cells formed during training became silent with time; they are not retrieved on 
Day-14 by natural recall cues but are still re-activatable optogenetically for recall. However, 
fear memory BLA engrams formed during training are functionally maintained even after 
the consolidation-mediated switch in recall circuits (Fig. 4L).
Our model (Fig. 4L) introduces the concept that the prefrontal memory engram is already 
generated, albeit in an immature form, on Day-1 of training via inputs from both HPC-EC 
and BLA (Fig. 1). The standard model (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 11) hypothesized that remote memory is 
formed in the cortex by a slow transfer of hippocampal memory. In contrast, in our study the 
role of the hippocampus in cortical memory is for the rapid generation of immature engram 
cells in the PFC during training and for the subsequent functional maturation of these 
preexisting engram cells (Fig. 3). The immature PFC engram may correspond to the cortical 
“tagging” speculated in an earlier study (14). Whereas in a previous study the BLA is crucial 
for both recent and remote fear memory expression (30), our results demonstrated an 
overlapping set of BLA engram cells for both recent and remote fear memory retrieval 
which were quickly formed during training (Fig. 4). However, the source of input into the 
BLA engrams for retrieval shifts from MEC-Va at recent time-points to the PFC engram at 
remote time-points (Fig. 4L). The route through which contextual stimuli activate the mature 
PFC engram is unknown. Most likely the information processed in a variety of sensory 
cortices reaches the PFC via the thalamus (31). Supporting this idea, PFC engram cells 
receive monosynaptic input from both the medial-dorsal and anteromedial thalamus (fig. 
S5).
Our finding of the lasting hippocampal engrams (Fig. 3Q) is consistent with multiple trace 
theory (5, 11). However, at the post-consolidation stage, the hippocampal engrams were not 
activatable by natural recall cues, but with optogenetic stimulation. A similar state of 
hippocampal engrams has previously been observed in anisomycin-induced amnesia (24) 
and in mouse models of early Alzheimer’s disease (26), and the early (Day-2) PFC engram 
cells showed a similar property (Fig. 1S, 2C). Although we did not determine how long after 
encoding this “silent state” of the hippocampal engram lasts, we speculate that the 
hippocampal engram will eventually lose the original memory information (29, 32, 33).

 Alternatively, the silent engram cells may still participate in the successful remote recall of 
discrete episodic details (5, 11).
As in previous studies (18, 20, 29), we observed that training resulted in wide-spread 
neuronal activation in the neocortex, including the ACC and RSC. However, whereas the 
activation of PFC neurons is crucial for formation of remote memory, MEC-Va input into the 
cACC or RSC is dispensable for this process. For remote memory, the PFC may thus have a 
distinctive role compared to other neocortical areas in integrating multiple sensory 
information stored in various cortical areas (11). Finally, our data show that the remote 
memory expressed by the PFC engram is conditioned-context specific, suggesting that it is 
episodic-like.
