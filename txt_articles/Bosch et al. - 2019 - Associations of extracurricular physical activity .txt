Abstract
Background: Body Mass Index (BMI) is a common outcome when assessing associations between childhood
overweight and obesity and physical activity patterns. However, the fat and fat-free components of BMI, measured
by the Fat Mass Index (FMI) and Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI), may show contrasting associations with physical
activity, while ethnic groups may vary in both physical activity patterns and body composition. Body composition
must therefore be evaluated when assessing the associations between childhood overweight and obesity and
physical activity in multi-ethnic populations.
Methods: This cross-sectional study investigated associations of BMI, FMI and FFMI z-scores with extracurricular
physical activity for 2171 London primary schoolchildren (aged 5–11 years) of black, South Asian and white/other
ethnicity. Multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic modelling was used, adjusting for age, sex and family and
neighbourhood socioeconomic status as potential confounders.
Results: Controlling for ethnicity and individual, family and neighbourhood socioeconomic confounders, actively
commuting children had significantly lower Odds Ratios for being in high BMI (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.678; 95 % Confidence
Interval (CI) = 0.531 − 0.865; p − value = 0.002) and FMI z-score groups (OR = 0.679; 95 % CI = 0.499 − 0.922; p = 0.013), but
not FFMI z-score groups, than passive commuters. Children doing sports less than once a week had lower Odds Ratios for
being in high BMI (OR = 0.435; 95 % CI = 0.236 − 0.802; p = 0.008) and FFMI (OR = 0.455; 95 % CI = 0.214 − 0.969; p = .041)
z-score categories compared to daily active children. Differences in FMI between groups did not reach the significance
threshold. A trend towards statistical significance was obtained whereby children’s complete inactivity was associated with
higher odds for being in higher BMI (OR = 2.222 : 95 % CI = 0.977 − 5.052; p = .057) and FMI z-score groups (OR = 2.485 :
95 % CI = 0.961 − 6.429; p = .060). FFMI z-scores did not show a similar trend with complete inactivity.
Conclusions: Active commuting was objectively associated with lower adiposity, while more frequent extracurricular sports
participation was correlated with greater fat-free mass accretion. These relationships were independent of ethnicity and
individual, family or neighbourhood socioeconomic confounding factors.

 Background
Excessive fat accumulation in children is a major risk factor
for a plethora of short-term physical and socio-psychological
health conditions, as well as for early-onset morbidity and
mortality in adulthood [1, 2]. Body Mass Index (BMI) is still
the most widely adopted index of children’s fatness, as its
simplicity and the low cost of data collection and interpret-
ation are useful when measuring large samples. However,
the limitations of using BMI in the study of childhood over-
weight and obesity are well-established [3], as it does not dif-
ferentiate fat and fat-free body mass components [4, 5].
Moreover, both BMI itself and the thresholds at which high
BMI is associated with ill-health vary with age, sex and eth-
nicity [6].
The
development
of
age-
and
sex-adjusted
BMI
z-scores for children aged 5 to 19 years old resolves the
issue of age and sex variability [7]. Conventionally, the
cut-off points for overweight and obesity are set at the
85th and 95th percentile boundaries, respectively [8].
However, BMI z-scores systematically underestimate
body fatness in South Asian children, while overestimat-
ing adiposity in black African children [9, 10]. One way
to remedy this is to apply adjustment factors, recently
published
for
these
ethnicities
in
British
4-
to
12-year-olds [11]. However, the lack of direct data on
body composition hinders elucidation of the underlying,
multifactorial drivers of ethnic differences in obesity risk,
such as genetic, socioeconomic, cultural and family rou-
tine variables [12]. Similarly, the different health implica-
tions of fat and fat-free mass make the distinction
between them vital in the determination of the risks
posed by adiposity, as obesity-related health risks are
primarily the consequence of excessive fat accumulation
rather than total weight [4, 5].
These differential health implications are particularly
relevant when studying the associations of physical activ-
ity (PA) with childhood overweight and obesity. PA not
only contributes to fat oxidation, but may also stimulate
muscle development [13]. Increased PA, and conse-
quently fat-free mass, could therefore entail a higher
overall BMI. However, the impact of PA on body com-
position and BMI and its potential health benefits means
that high BMI due to high PA has very different implica-
tions compared to high BMI deriving from high fatness.
BMI thus needs to be divided into fat and fat-free body
mass indices, abbreviated as FMI and FFMI respectively
[14, 15].
Study aim
We aimed to study the association of PA with body
composition in a multi-ethnic sample of UK primary
schoolchildren. Ethnicity was taken into account with
the objective of demonstrating more reliably the associ-
ation of both components of body composition with the
two prime contributors to children’s daily extracurricular
PA [16]: competitive or leisurely sports participation
outside of school hours, and active commuting to and
from school.
Methods
Participants
This cross-sectional analysis used data from a sample of
London primary schoolchildren who participated in the
Size and Lung Function in Children (SLIC) study carried
out at the Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health,
University College London, UK [17]. Between December
2010 and June 2013, data on body composition, PA and
socioeconomic status were collected for 2171 children
aged 5 to 11 years, attending thirteen schools in London.
These schools were purposefully sampled based on their
diverse geographical location and education performance.
Moreover, schools were selected to have strongly diverging
ethnic compositions. Together, this ensured the collection
of a SLIC sample with a broad spectrum of ethnic and so-
cioeconomic backgrounds [17, 18]. Further detailed infor-
mation on the recruitment of schools and participants,
their representativeness and data collection methods of
the SLIC Study can be found elsewhere [17, 18].
Measures
Anthropometric and body composition data were col-
lected by the SLIC team during school visits. These in-
cluded the child’s height in centimetres, total body mass
in kilograms, and fat-free body mass (FFM) in kilograms
estimated from bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA)
using standard instrumentation (Tanita BC418, Tanita
Corporation, UK). FFM was calculated from raw BIA
data using the multi-ethnic calibration equation of Lee
et al. [19], generated from the same population using
deuterium dilution as the reference method. Fat mass
(FM) in kilograms was calculated by subtracting the
FFM from total body mass.
BMI for SLIC children was calculated by dividing total
body mass in kilograms by the square of their height in
metres. These were converted to age- and sex-specific
percentiles using the 2007 World Health Organization
BMI reference charts [20]. Analogous to the calculation of
BMI, FFM and FM were then divided by the square of
height in metres to give fat-free mass index (FFMI) and fat
mass index (FMI). The need for age- and sex-adjusted
FMI and FFMI reference charts, similar to those for BMI,
has been highlighted in prior research, and these have
been developed for specific groups of children [21–24].
However, no adequate reference charts currently exist for
the age group and ethnic mix of our sample of UK partici-
pants. Hence, the raw FMI and FFMI scores were further
converted to within-study age- and sex-specific z-scores
using multiple regression analysis. Age- and sex-adjusted

 z-scores and percentiles of FMI and FFMI are thus
sample-specific, though they can be considered to be rep-
resentative for the London-wide population of primary
schoolchildren aged 5–11, given the large diversity in
terms of age, sex and ethnicity of included participants
[17,
18].
To
address
skew,
FM
was
first
natural
log-transformed.
Following the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention [8], the 5th, 85th and 95th percentiles
were used as class boundaries to assign each individual
child in the SLIC database to one of four categories of
age- and sex-adjusted BMI (underweight, normal weight,
overweight or obese). In analogy, age- and sex-adjusted
FMI and FFMI of SLIC children were also subdivided into
four categories, which were designed to be equivalent to
the categories for BMI (low, normal, moderate or elevated
FM and FFM for height, respectively). Hence, for both
FMI and FFMI measures, the 5th, 85th and 95th percen-
tiles were selected as class boundaries.
Data on SLIC children’s extracurricular PA were also
directly collected via a questionnaire during the school
visits for two key components of their extracurricular ac-
tivity [16]. Firstly, the frequency of participation in a
series of twelve sports was gauged. These included the
potentially low-cost activities of running/jogging and
cycling, regular outdoor activities (football, cricket, skat-
ing/rollerblading), regular indoor activities (gymnastics,
swimming, badminton/tennis, basketball, dancing, judo/
boxing, weightlifting) and an ‘other’ category where less
common sports could be indicated. Possible frequencies
ranged from ‘never’ through ‘less than weekly’
, ‘weekly’
and ‘most days’ to ‘daily’. A composite measure was con-
structed, providing an overview of the overall sports par-
ticipation of each child. Second, children were asked for
the dominant mode of transport when commuting from
home to school. Afterwards, parents and guardians were
asked the same question through a parental question-
naire. Responses were classified as ‘active commuting’ if
the child predominantly walked or cycled, or ‘passive
commuting’ where car, bus or metropolitan railway/
underground were the dominant modes of transport. If
both active and passive transport constituted significant
parts of the commute, this was labelled ‘mixed commut-
ing’. Where parent and child responses differed, this was
retained by their inclusion in a ‘disagreement’ category.
Data on sex, age and attended school of participating chil-
dren were directly collected during the school visits. Par-
ents/guardians were asked to provide detailed information
on their child’s ethnicity via a questionnaire [17, 18]. Based
on this information, children were categorized into three
main ethnic groups: black (African or Caribbean ancestry),
South Asian (ancestry from the Indian subcontinent) and
white/other (European/other/mixed ancestry). The ‘other’
category is added to the ‘white’ category as over 70% of the
364 children belonging to this group of whom the ethnicity
is known are half white, by far the largest proportion of any
ethnicity. Socioeconomic data were also gathered via the
questionnaire [17]. Family socioeconomic status was derived
from an inventory of material possessions, summarized in
the Family Affluence Scale [25]. Car ownership (zero to two
cars) was accounted for separately, given its decisive role in
commuting choices [26–28]. Whether or not the child re-
ceived free school lunches, a reliable indicator of socioeco-
nomic disadvantage in the UK [29], was included as a final
indicator of family socioeconomic status. Using the child’s
postcode of residence, neighbourhood socioeconomic status
was
categorized
using
the
2010
Index
of
Multiple
Deprivation, combining 38 weighted variables across seven
domains of deprivation for small-area units [30]. These
contextual data for the SLIC sample are summarized in
Additional file 1: Table S1.
Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed in Stata 14.2 (Stata-
Corp 2015, College Station, Texas, USA). χ2-tests were
performed to analyse binary relationships between ethni-
city and body composition measures, PA and potential
confounders. When analysing the associations of PA and
body composition, the nested data structure, whereby
pupils are grouped by school, needed to be accounted
for. Individuals attending the same school are likely to
be more similar to each other compared to those attend-
ing a different school [31, 32]. As non-white children in
England are unequally confronted with socioeconomic
and obesity risk factors [33], the distribution of and ex-
posure to these risk factors differed by school, according
to their ethnic composition. This clustering of more
similar subjects in groups by school violates the assump-
tion of independence of observations and generates a
need for school-specific information [34]. Compositional
effects must be distinguished from contextual ones. This
can be done through a multilevel analysis on two levels
[35]. The first level includes the PA of the child, as well
as her or his individual characteristics (ethnicity, age and
sex), and family and neighbourhood socioeconomic sta-
tus. This captures the specific individual, socioeconomic
environment she or he is exposed to. The second level
then groups the children by the school they attend. This
corrects for their higher likelihood of similarity due to
the exposure to more similar environments based on
their place of residence and school location. Simultan-
eously, the mixed-effects regression models designed for
the analysis of clustered data must be adapted to fit the
ordered categorical nature of the response variables for
body composition. Hence, multilevel mixed-effect or-
dered logistic modelling was performed for BMI, FMI
and FFMI on the level of the individual child and the
attended school [36]. Results are shown as Odds Ratios

 (OR) for being in higher BMI, FMI or FFMI categories,
with 95% Confidence Intervals. The critical significance
level for all models was set at p < 0.05. Participants for
whom anthropometric, body composition, PA or Index
of Multiple Deprivation data were lacking, or who were
considered to be unhealthy at the time of data collection,
were excluded from analysis.
Results
Descriptive statistics
For 1889 SLIC children who were healthy at the time of
data collection, data were available for each of the an-
thropometric, body composition, PA and Index of Mul-
tiple Deprivation measures (87.0% of the total sample).
Table 1 shows that for 18.7% of children, their age- and
sex-adjusted BMI z-score percentile placed them in the
obese category, with another 12.4% falling in the over-
weight category. For FMI, 9.1% had a score between the
85th and 95th percentiles, and another 6.1% scored
above the 95th percentile. For FFMI, similar percentages
were obtained. Results for self-reported extracurricular
PA suggest that 44.1% of children engaged in sports
every day, with only 1.4% being completely inactive.
Nearly half of the children commuted actively to school.
One-third predominantly used passive means of transport.
In one out of five cases, however, parent and child com-
muting reports were inconsistent (21.1% of responses).
Due to its size, this disagreement group has been retained
as a separate category in the statistical models.
Further characteristics are summarized in Additional file 1:
Table S1. 53.7% of the sample were female. All age groups
between 5 and 11 years were well-represented, while black
and South Asian children accounted for over half of the
total sample. The majority of children lived in families with
intermediate Family Affluence Scale scores, with a slight
tendency towards higher affluence. Nearly a quarter re-
ceived free school lunches. About a quarter of families did
not own a car, while a similar proportion owned two. Most
children lived in relatively deprived neighbourhoods, with
32.2% residing in an area in the most deprived quintile for
the Index of Multiple Deprivation.
Binary statistics relating to ethnicity
Table 2 demonstrates that, using BMI, the proportion of
black children with overweight or obesity (42.1%) was
significantly higher than that for children of white/other
ethnicities (29.9%) and South Asian children (22.5%).
This contrast was reduced when FMI was analysed, al-
though inter-ethnic differences remained significant. The
proportion of South Asian children with FMI percentile
over 95 was higher than in the white/other ethnic group
(6.8% versus 4.0%). The largest differences were ob-
served for FFMI percentile scores. 24.1% of children of
black ethnicity had an FFMI percentile score above the
85th percentile. For the white/other group, this was
14.2%, for South Asians only 4.1%.
Ethnic groups differed significantly in their overall fre-
quency of sports participation. 71.8% of black children
and 72.2% of South Asian children in the SLIC sample
participated in sports more than once a week. For those
of white/other ethnicities, this was 66.7%. We found no
significant inter-ethnic differences in commuting modes.
Additional file 2: Table S2 and Additional file 3: Table
S3 illustrate further significant differences between eth-
nicities. Families of black children scored lower on the
Family Affluence Scale compared to white/other fam-
ilies, with South Asians having intermediate scores. Car
ownership was lower for black families than for white/
other and South Asian families. The findings for free
school lunches showed the opposite pattern. Families of

 black children tended to live in more deprived neigh-
bourhoods than the other groups. The ethnic compos-
ition of the schools also differed significantly.
Multilevel mixed-effect ordered logistic models linking
body mass and composition to PA
The results of the multilevel mixed-effect ordered lo-
gistic models linking body composition to sports par-
ticipation are shown in Table 3. Children of black
ethnicity
had
significantly
higher
childhood
over-
weight and obesity odds for BMI compared to the
white/other group, and similar results were obtained
for FMI and FFMI. For South Asians, the opposite
findings were obtained for BMI and FFMI. Being
younger was associated with lower weight status in
terms of BMI. Socioeconomic differences were also
evident. If the child received free school lunches, she
or he had significantly higher odds for elevated BMI,
FMI and FFMI, while a positive relationship between
high Family Affluence Score and FFMI was found.
If only conventional BMI percentiles are taken into
account, children who were active less than once a
week had significantly lower odds of being overweight
or obese compared to children who were active daily.
The higher Odds Ratios for completely inactive chil-
dren to be overweight or obese did not reach the sig-
nificance threshold for BMI. This picture changes,
however, as soon as FMI and FFMI are studied. Using
these indexes of fat and fat-free mass, children who
were active less than weekly were significantly less
likely to belong to high FFMI categories compared to
daily active children, whereas the results for FMI did
not reach the significance threshold. A trend towards
statistical
significance
was
also
obtained

 completely inactive children had significantly higher
odds of belonging to the highest FMI categories com-
pared to children who engaged in sports every day.
FMI and FFMI trends for other sports frequencies
were similar to those for BMI.
Table 4 shows the link between BMI or body compos-
ition, and commuting to school. BMI data indicate that
active school commuting is associated with lower odds
of childhood overweight and obesity compared to pas-
sive commuting. A similar finding was also obtained for
FMI, but not for FFMI. Observations for mixed com-
muting and the disagreement category did not reach
statistical significance.
Ethnicity and confounders showed the same pattern of as-
sociation with BMI, FMI and FFMI in the commuting
models as in the sports participation models, with the ex-
ception that high neighbourhood deprivation was now
linked to significantly elevated childhood overweight and
obesity measured by BMI.
Discussion
This study examined the associations of specific physical
activity patterns with individual body composition com-
ponents, accounting for ethnicity and individual an-
thropometric, family and neighbourhood socioeconomic
variables in a multi-ethnic sample of UK children, drawn
from the SLIC study.
To our knowledge, it is the first to assess the impact
of PA on childhood overweight and obesity for primary
schoolchildren by simultaneously relating two potential
prime contributors to extracurricular physical activity,
mode of commuting to school and frequency of sports
participation, to children’s body composition. PA has
rarely been disaggregated in the study of its relationship
to body composition, and no other study has specifically
focused on the relationship between PA patterns and
various measures of body composition for a large cohort
of primary schoolchildren. Our findings show that active
commuting to school is inversely associated with BMI,

 whereas earlier research has provided inconclusive evi-
dence on its adiposity-countering effects [37, 38]. Inter-
estingly,
only
when
BMI
is
disentangled
into
its
underlying fat and fat-free components, measured by
FMI and FFMI, does it become apparent that the inverse
relationship obtained is principally due to lower FMI
and not FFMI for active commuters. This is in line with
other studies looking specifically at adiposity [39, 40].
These findings are independent of children’s ethnicity,
age, gender or socioeconomic status.
Studying body composition also sheds light on the im-
pact of sports participation. Frequent sports participa-
tion does not consistently lower a child’s likelihood of
being overweight or obese as defined by BMI. A large
body of studies prior to ours has generated inconsistent
findings on this relationship [41]. Whereas some studies
found a BMI-lowering effect of sports throughout child-
hood and adolescence [42–44], others found no relation-
ship [45, 46]. Again, only when considering FMI and
FFMI separately, it is shown that that less-than-weekly
sports participation is associated with lower FFMI, whilst
there is a trend for completely inactive children to have
higher fat masses. The lower FFMI percentile scores for
children who are active less than once a week are likely
due to reduced muscle development [3, 13]. Despite the
more complex data collection process, it is thus indis-
pensable to separately collect information on fat and
fat-free mass.
Besides demonstrating the influence of PA compo-
nents on BMI, FMI and FFMI, this study expands our
knowledge of confounding factors that affect body com-
position. In addition to the standard anthropometric var-
iables age and sex, which were accounted for through
the use of z-scores and included as individual con-
founders, the mediating role played by ethnicity and so-
cioeconomic status is underlined [47, 48]. Our analyses
were able to address remaining uncertainties related to
these confounders [47] by looking at the effect of ethni-
city and socioeconomic status on the same individuals
for whom BMI, FMI and FFMI data were available. Con-
sidering BMI, overall childhood overweight and obesity
levels for the selected SLIC sample were comparable to

 those for primary schoolchildren at the national level,
and slightly below the average for London [49]. How-
ever, first, strong inter-ethnic differences were evident.
Higher childhood overweight and obesity rates were ob-
served for black children, and lower rates for South
Asians, in comparison to the white/other group. Using
FMI, levels for children of black ethnicity were still con-
sistently higher than those for any other ethnic group.
Whilst not significant, the multilevel models showed
that South Asians appeared more likely to be in the
highest adiposity category than whites/others. Their
lower BMI is hence related to their significantly lower
fat-free mass development.
A broad range of family and neighbourhood socioeco-
nomic confounders were then accounted for to further
elucidate the ethnicity-body composition relationship, as
children of different ethnicities were previously found to
be unequally exposed to socioeconomic and environ-
mental obesity risk factors [50–53]. In England, black
and South Asian primary schoolchildren are more likely
to have obesogenic lifestyles than whites [33]. The binary
associations in our research indicate strong socioeco-
nomic disparities between ethnicities. Families of black
ethnicity scored significantly lower on the Family Afflu-
ence Scale and lived in more deprived neighbourhoods
compared to the children in the white/other group, with
South Asians having intermediate socioeconomic status.
Yet, using multivariate models to correct for the associ-
ation of ethnicity and family and neighbourhood socio-
economic
variables,
the
significant
association
of
ethnicity with body composition was found to be inde-
pendent of socioeconomic conditions. Black ethnicity
was associated with higher total, fat and fat-free body
mass indices, and being of South Asian ethnicity with
lower total and fat-free body mass compared to white/
other children. This independent association of ethnicity
with childhood overweight and obesity is in line with
other research in the UK and elsewhere that finds ethnic
differences to be only partially explained by socioeco-
nomic characteristics [12, 54].
Our results have several broader implications. First,
the finding that different modes of PA are associated
with different body composition characteristics has to be
considered in future research on the PA-childhood over-
weight and obesity relationship. The observation that ac-
tive commuting is linked to lower FMI is especially
relevant, given that adiposity has been shown to directly
impact the short- and long-term morbidity and mortality
of children with overweight and obesity [1, 2]. Interven-
tions should therefore target factors that reduce FMI, as
they are more likely to reduce the burden of the child-
hood overweight and obesity epidemic. Second, we
would not have observed all the associations if we had
looked only at BMI. Even stronger, healthy muscle mass,
rather than excess body fat, might make frequently ac-
tive children appear as overweight or obese when BMI is
used as has been previously suggested [3, 13]. Addition-
ally, BMI is influenced by ethnicity, making the use of
accurate anthropometric data and a wide range of socio-
economic characteristics indispensable in the study of
childhood overweight and obesity.
Our study also has limitations that need to be ac-
knowledged. Being a cross-sectional study, a causal link
between childhood overweight and obesity and PA could
not be established. Next, although thoroughly selected
and tested, it cannot be guaranteed that all relevant con-
founders have been included. Moreover, the use of three
broad ethnic groups does not allow us to take other eth-
nicities and their differences at finer scales into account.
In addition, both measures of PA rely on subjective
self-report, and could not be objectively verified. Whilst
no data were collected during the UK school summer
holiday period during peak summer months (second half
of July to October), seasonality potentially affecting out-
door, non-essential PA could not be corrected for. They
also do not capture scheduled or free in-school activity,
which may vary between pupils of different schools.
Lastly, despite the specific ethnic, socioeconomic and
geographically diverse sampling, findings for the SLIC
dataset only apply to these primary schoolchildren in
London. Caution needs to be exerted when expanding
hypotheses beyond the scope of this sample.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates how various extracurricular PA
components predict body composition in a multi-ethnic
population from varying socioeconomic backgrounds
and, in so doing, contributes to the development of
tailor-made interventions to counter childhood over-
weight and obesity. Moreover, it does so for children
predominantly living in deprived conditions, where over-
weight and obesity tend to cluster. The findings suggest
that future interventions could be particularly promising
if they consist of a combination of the promotion of ac-
tive commuting, lowering FMI, and sports participation,
raising FFMI. Disentangling the core variables of the
childhood overweight and obesity-PA relationship is in-
dispensable for the development of informed policy
measures that could contribute to the reversal of the
childhood overweight and obesity epidemic. Notwith-
standing their more complex data collection process, fat
and fat-free body mass data need to be separately col-
lected, to fully understand observed weight status trends,
and anthropometric characteristics and socioeconomic
status need to be corrected for. The same applies to PA:
it needs to be disaggregated into its different compo-
nents when its relationship with body composition is

 studied. The continuous omission of this disentangle-
ment is likely to contribute to the substantial and grow-
ing body of literature describing counterintuitive and
null-findings.
