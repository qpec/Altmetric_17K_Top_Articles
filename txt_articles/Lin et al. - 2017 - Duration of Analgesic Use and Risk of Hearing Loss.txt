Aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), and acetaminophen are commonly used. Frequent
use of analgesics has been associated with a higher risk of hearing loss. However, the association between
duration of analgesic use and the risk of hearing loss is unclear. We investigated the relationship between
duration of analgesic use and self-reported hearing loss among 55,850 women in the Nurses’ Health Study.
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. During 873,376 person-
years of follow-up (1990–2012), longer durations of NSAID use (for >6 years of use compared with <1 year,
multivariable-adjusted relative risk = 1.10, 95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.15; P for trend < 0.001) and acet-
aminophen use (for >6 years of use compared with <1 year, multivariable-adjusted relative risk = 1.09, 95%
confidence interval: 1.04, 1.14; P for trend < 0.001) were associated with higher risks of hearing loss. Duration
of aspirin use was not associated with hearing loss (for >6 years of use compared with <1 year, multivariable-
adjusted relative risk = 1.01, 95% confidence interval: 0.97, 1.05; P for trend = 0.35). In this cohort of women,
longer durations of NSAID and acetaminophen use were associated with slightly higher risks of hearing loss,
but duration of aspirin use was not. Considering the high prevalence of analgesic use, this may be an important
modifiable contributor to hearing loss.

Hearing loss is common among adults in the United
States. According to the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), two-thirds of women in
their sixties have hearing loss (1). Hearing loss can have
a significant impact on quality of life; thus, identifying
potential modifiable risk factors may help reduce the bur-
den of this condition (2, 3).
Aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
and acetaminophen are the most commonly used medications
in the United States (4). Previous studies have suggested that
use of high-dose NSAIDs or salicylates (aspirin) may be
ototoxic. Ototoxicity may be mediated by several different
mechanisms, including impariment of outer hair cell func-
tion, reduced vascular supply to the cochlea, and inhibition
of cyclooxygenase (5–9). It is hypothesized that depletion
of cochlear glutathione by acetaminophen (10) may result in
greater susceptibility of the cochlea to noise-induced dam-
age (11, 12). Furthermore, in rodent models, it has been
demonstrated that acetaminophen and a metabolite of acet-
aminophen may cause ototoxicity through oxidative stress
mechanisms (13).
In a cohort of younger women, we found that regular use
(≥2 days/week) of ibuprofen and acetaminophen was associ-
ated with a higher risk of hearing loss (14). We therefore
decided to examine this question in a cohort of older women
and determine whether a longer duration of regular analgesic
use was associated with the risk of hearing loss. Given the
mechanisms by which analgesics are theorized to cause
hearing loss, we hypothesized that longer duration of expo-
sure to analgesics would be more likely to result in hearing

 loss. We investigated the relationship between duration of
analgesic use and risk of hearing loss among participants in
the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) I.
METHODS
Study participants
NHS I is an ongoing cohort study of female nurses. In
1976, a total of 121,700 participants who were 30–55 years
of age enrolled. Participants were 44–69 years of age in
1990, the baseline year of our study. In the NHS I, question-
naires are administered to the participants every 2 years, with
an average follow-up rate of more than 90% of the eligible
person-time. The NHS questionnaires are available online (15).
In the Conservation of Hearing Study (CHEARS), an NHS
substudy, researchers investigate factors associated with hear-
ing loss in the NHS. On the 2012 long-form questionnaire,
the women were asked whether they had a hearing problem,
and if so, the age at which they first noticed a change in
their hearing. In 2012, a total of 63,966 women answered
the long-form questionnaire. Of these women, 47% reported
having a hearing problem. Women who reported a hearing
problem that began before 1990 (baseline year of the study)
and those who reported a history of cancer other than non-
melanoma skin cancer were excluded from our study
because of the potential exposure to ototoxic chemothera-
peutic drugs. After applying these exclusion criteria, our
study population comprised 55,850 women.
Ascertainment of medication use
In 1990 and every 2 years thereafter, women were asked
about their average use of aspirin (e.g., Anacin (Insight
Pharmaceuticals, Langhoren, Pennsylvania), Bufferin (Dr.
Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd., Hyderabad, India), Midol (Bayer
AG, Leverkusen, Germany), and Alka-Seltzer (Bayer AG,
Leverkusen, Germany)), acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol (McNeil
Consumer Healthcare, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania)), and
other antiinflammatory medications (e.g., ibuprofen, Naprosyn
(Atnahs Pharma, London, United Kingdom), and Advil (Pfizer,
Groton, Connecticut)). Specifically, participants were asked,
“On average, how many days each month do you take any of
the following medications: acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol); aspi-
rin (e.g., Anacin, Bufferin, Midol, Alka-Seltzer, etc.); other anti-
inflammatory (e.g., ibuprofen, Naprosyn, Advil)?” Starting in
2000, participants were asked about their average use of ibupro-
fen (e.g., Advil, Motrin (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick,
New Jersey), and Nuprin (Shasun Pharmaceuticals, Chennai,
India)). We considered participants who reported using other
antiinflammatory analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen, Naprosyn, Advil)
between 1990–1999 and ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin,
Nuprin) between 2000–2012 to be NSAID users. Partici-
pants with missing information on analgesic intake over any
2-year questionnaire period were excluded from that time
period. Analgesic use assessed in this manner has been asso-
ciated with colon cancer (16), renal cell carcinoma (17), Par-
kinson disease (18), hypertension (19, 20), and breast cancer
survival (21).
Duration of medication use was derived by assigning
2 years of use to women who reported using the medication 2
or more days/week on average, starting at baseline (1990),
and then adding 2 additional years of use for answers in the
affirmative on subsequent questionnaires. Women who re-
ported using analgesics less than 2 days/week on average
were categorized as participants with “no regular use” for that
questionnaire cycle. Duration of medication use was catego-
rized as less than 1 year, 1–2 years, 3–4 years, 5–6 years, and
more than 6 years. Women who reported “no regular use” of
analgesics were categorized as having less than 1 year of use.
We were unable to ascertain information on duration of use
of aspirin, NSAIDs, or acetaminophen before 1990.
Ascertainment of hearing loss
The outcome in the present study was self-reported hear-
ing loss. In 2012, participants were asked, “Do you have a
hearing problem?” If they answered in the affirmative, they
were asked, “At what age did you first notice a change in
your hearing?” We defined cases of hearing loss as women
who reported a hearing problem after 1990. The gold stan-
dard for evaluating hearing loss is pure-tone audiometry.
From a logistical and financial standpoint, it is challenging
to obtain audiograms in such a large cohort. It has been
shown in previous studies that compared with hearing loss
diagnosed by audiogram, self-reported hearing loss is a rel-
atively reliable indicator of hearing loss (22–25). In addi-
tion, significant associations between other factors and risk
of self-reported hearing loss have been observed using this
method of assessment in NHS I and NHS II (14, 26–29).
Ascertainment of covariates
Covariates were selected based on previously reported risk
factors for hearing loss. These factors included age (1); race
(1); body mass index (27, 30); waist circumference (27); alco-
hol consumption (28, 31); intakes of folate (32), β-carotene
(29), trans fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids (33), β-cryptoxanthin
(29), vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin C (29), vitamin E, potas-
sium (34), and magnesium (35); physical activity level (27, 36);
smoking (31); diabetes (37); hypertension (26); and tinnitus
(38, 39).
Updated covariate data were obtained from the biennial
questionnaires. Dietary intakes (alcohol, folate, vitamin B12,
vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, vitamin E, trans fatty
acids, omega-3 fatty acids, β-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin)
were derived from semiquantitative food frequency question-
naires, which are mailed to study participants every 4 years.
The validity and reproducibility of the food frequency ques-
tionnaires have previously been reported (40, 41). Many of
the other covariates used in our models have been shown to
be valid measures in this and other similar cohorts (42–44).
Calculation of the population attributable fraction
In the event that duration of analgesic use was found to
be associated with risk of hearing loss, we calculated the
population attributable fraction (PAF) of hearing loss among
women in our study using the method of Bruzzi et al. (45).

 This method has been shown to provide valid estimates of
the population attributable fraction with multicategory expo-
sures (46). This calculation is based on the assumption that
there is a causal relation.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed in a prospective manner.
Person-time for each participant was assigned based on their
responses to questions about aspirin, NSAID, and acetam-
inophen use on the 1990 questionnaire and was updated
every 2 years subsequently. Participants were censored at
the reported onset of hearing loss or cancer diagnosis.
Multivariable-adjusted relative risks were calculated using
Cox proportional hazards regression models. The Anderson-
Gill data structure was used to deal with left truncation and
time-varying covariates in an efficient manner (47). To con-
trol for confounding by age as finely as possible, we strati-
fied our analysis jointly by age at start of follow-up and
calendar year of a given questionnaire cycle. We also tested
for possible effect modification of the relationships of use of
aspirin, NSAID, and acetaminophen with age (categorized
as <60 years and ≥60 years). Age 60 years was chosen
based on the distribution of participant ages and previous
studies in which effect modification by age was investigated.
Given that analgesic use may be associated with tinnitus, we
performed a secondary analysis in which we excluded
women who reported onset of tinnitus before onset of he-
aring loss. P values are all 2-sided, with 95% confidence
intervals for all relative risks. SAS software, version 9.4
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) was used for
all statistical analyses. This study was approved by the
Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board.
RESULTS
At study baseline (1990), the mean participant age was
53.9 (standard deviation, 6.5) years, and the mean partici-
pant body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared, was 25.5 (standard
deviation, 4.7). At baseline, 16.2% of participants reported
regular (≥2 days/week) aspirin use, 11.1% of participants
reported regular NSAID use, and 7.9% of participants re-
ported regular acetaminophen use; 8.8% of participants re-
ported regular use of multiple analgesics.
Characteristics of participants by duration of aspirin,
NSAID, and acetaminophen use in 2002 (the approximate
midpoint of the study period) are shown in Tables 1–3.
Women with longer durations of aspirin use tended to be old-
er, were more physically active, were more likely to be current
smokers, and were more likely to have a history of hyperten-
sion or diabetes. Women with longer durations of NSAID use
tended to have higher body mass indices and waist circumfer-
ences, were less physically active, consumed less alcohol, and
were more likely to have a history of hypertension or diabetes.
Women with longer durations of acetaminophen use tended to
have higher body mass indices and waist circumferences,

 were less physically active, consumed less alcohol, and were
more likely to have a history of hypertension and diabetes.
During 873,376 person-years of follow-up, 18,663 inci-
dent cases of hearing loss were reported. Increasing duration
of regular NSAID use (for >6 years of use compared with
<1 year use, multivariable-adjusted relative risk (RR) = 1.10,
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.15; P for trend < 0.001)
and regular acetaminophen use (for >6 years of use com-
pared with <1 year use, multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.09,
95% CI: 1.04, 1.14; P for trend < 0.001) were independently
associated with higher risks of hearing loss, but increasing
duration of aspirin use was not (for >6 years of use compared
with <1 year use, multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.01, 95% CI:
0.97, 1.05; P for trend = 0.35) (Table 4). Adjusting for body
mass index and waist circumference as continuous variables
and excluding participants with a history of tinnitus did not
significantly change the results. There was no significant
effect modification of duration by age (data not shown).
Longer durations of aspirin, NSAID, and acetaminophen
use were significantly correlated with increasing frequency of
aspirin, NSAID, and acetaminophen use (Spearman correla-
tion coefficients = 0.61, 0.48, and 0.59, respectively). There
was a higher risk of hearing loss among women who reported
regular (≥2 days/week) NSAID use (multivariable-adjusted
RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.13) and regular acetaminophen
use (multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.13)
compared with women who reported average use of less than
2 days/week. Regular aspirin use was not associated with risk
of hearing loss (multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.01, 95%
CI: 0.98, 1.05). Regular use of multiple analgesics was also
associated with higher risk of hearing loss (for regular use of
aspirin, NSAIDs, and acetaminophen compared with no reg-
ular use, multivariable-adjusted RR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08,
1.32) (Appendix Table 1).
Assuming a causal relation between analgesic use and
hearing loss among women in our study, the population
attributable fraction for regular NSAID use was 4.0%, and
that for acetaminophen use was 1.6%. The total population
attributable fraction for NSAID use and acetaminophen use
among women in our study was 5.5%.
DISCUSSION
In our large prospective study, longer durations of regu-
lar (≥2 days/week) NSAID use and acetaminophen use
were associated with higher risks of hearing loss. If this is
a causal relation, it suggests that a substantial proportion of
hearing loss attributable to use of analgesics is potentially
preventable.
Ototoxicity is a well-known potential side effect of very
high-dose salicylates (5). Salicylates have been associated
with decreased blood flow to the cochlea, impaired outer
hair cell motility, and inhibition of the endocochlear

 potential via alteration of membrane permeability, conduc-
tance, and afferent cochlear nerve function (7, 9, 48–50).
However, use of high-dose aspirin has been uncommon for
more than 2 decades. We found no association between
duration of regular (≥2 days/week) aspirin use and risk of
hearing loss. Data from a previous study in which investi-
gators examined cumulative use of aspirin in our cohort
suggested that participants tended to use aspirin at doses
within the recommended daily range (51), which is much
lower than the high doses previously described to be asso-
ciated with hearing loss. To our knowledge, this represents
the first published study in which the relationship between
duration of aspirin use and risk of hearing loss in women
has been prospectively examined.
High-dose NSAIDs have been associated with ototoxicity
in rodent models and small human case reports (52). In NHS
II, we found that regular use of NSAIDs was associated with
a higher risk of hearing loss, and more frequent use tended
to be associated with a higher risk (14). In a prospective
study in men, Curhan et al. (53) found a higher risk of hear-
ing loss associated with a longer duration of NSAID use.
Previous data have shown that the average use of NSAIDs
within the NHS I cohort is, on average, much less than 3.2
g/day, the recommended maximum daily dose (51). Our
data are consistent with these findings and represent the first
published study in which the association between duration
of NSAID use and the risk of hearing loss in women has
been described.
Acetaminophen has been hypothesized to decrease levels
of cochlear glutathione, which may reduce protection of
the cochlea from noise-induced hearing loss (11, 12). In a
previous study in men, researchers demonstrated that a lon-
ger duration of acetaminophen use was associated with a
higher risk of hearing loss (53). Our data in women are
consistent with these findings. Previous data have shown
that use of acetaminophen within this cohort is, on average,
far less than 4 g/day, the recommended maximum daily
dose (51). To our knowledge, this represents the first pro-
spective study in women to describe the relation between
duration of acetaminophen use and the risk of hearing loss.
Although the magnitude of the higher risk of hearing
loss with analgesic use in our cohort was modest, given the
high prevalence of analgesic use, a small increase in risk
could have important public health implications. We calcu-
lated the population attributable fraction of hearing loss for
NSAID and acetaminophen use and, assuming causality,
5.5% of the cases of hearing loss in our cohort could be
attributable to NSAID and acetaminophen use. Although
limited by the assumption of causality, our estimates serve
as an important reminder that small increases in risk associ-
ated with common exposures could have potentially impor-
tant implications on a population level.

 Our study has limitations. Our cohort comprised mostly
older white women. Further investigation is required to
examine the associations in other populations. Although we
were able to assess duration of analgesic use, our study
lacked information on the cumulative amounts of analgesic
intake in participants. Analgesic use was self-reported, and
we lacked information on duration of use prior to baseline.
Given that analgesic use data were based on self-reports, the
possibility of misclassification of analgesic use cannot be
excluded. However, data in the present study were prospec-
tively collected over 22 years, and information from this and
other similar cohorts has been shown to be highly reliable in
previous studies (40, 41, 44, 54). The outcome of our study
was self-reported hearing loss. Although pure-tone audiome-
try is considered the gold standard for diagnosing hearing
loss, self-reported hearing loss has been shown to be a reli-
able indicator of hearing loss (22–25). Furthermore, in a
recent literature review, Chou et al. (55) showed that a single
question on perceived hearing loss was almost as accurate as
a more detailed questionnaire or portable audiometric device
for detecting hearing loss. Misclassification of the age at
which participants reported they first noticed a change in
their hearing cannot be excluded.
In conclusion, longer duration of regular (≥2 days/week)
NSAID use and longer duration of regular acetaminophen
use were associated with higher risks of hearing loss, but
longer duration of aspirin use was not. Considering the
high prevalence of analgesic use and the high probability
of frequent and/or prolonged exposure in women of more
advanced age, our findings suggest that NSAID use and
acetaminophen use may be modifiable risk factors for hear-
ing loss.
