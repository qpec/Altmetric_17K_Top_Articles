background Given low survival rates in cases of 
traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), there 
is a need to identify factors associated with outcomes. 
We aimed to investigate Utstein factors associated with 
achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 
survival to hospital in traumatic OHCA.
Methods The Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest 
Registry (VACAR) was used to identify cases of 
traumatic OHCA that received attempted resuscitation 
and occurred between July 2008 and June 2014. We 
excluded cases aged <16 years or with a mechanism 
of hanging or drowning.
results Of the 660 traumatic OHCA patients who 
received attempted resuscitation, ROSC was achieved 
in 159 patients (24%) and 95 patients (14%) survived 
to hospital (ROSC on hospital handover). Factors 
that were positively associated with achieving ROSC 
in multivariable logistic regression models were age 
≥65 years (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.56, 95% CI: 1.01 
to 2.43) and arresting rhythm (shockable (AOR=3.65, 
95% CI: 1.64 to 8.11) and pulseless electrical activity 
(AOR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.36 to 3.39) relative to asystole). 
Similarly, factors positively associated with survival to 
hospital were arresting rhythm (shockable (AOR=3.92, 
95% CI: 1.64 to 9.41) relative to asystole), and the 
mechanism of injury (falls (AOR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.03 
to 4.54) relative to motor vehicle collisions), while 
trauma type (penetrating (AOR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.08 to 
0.91) relative to blunt trauma) and event region (rural 
(AOR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.80) relative to urban) 
were negatively associated with survival to hospital.
conclusions Few patient and arrest characteristics 
were associated with outcomes in traumatic OHCA. 
These findings suggest there is a need to incorporate 
additional information into cardiac arrest registries to 
assist prognostication and the development of novel 
interventions in these trauma patients.
IntroductIon
Survival from cases of traumatic out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest (OHCA) is generally reported to be 
low, with a recent systematic review reporting an 
overall survival of 3.3%.1 Despite this, there has 
been an emerging interest in traumatic OHCA. 
However, there remains little known about the 
characteristics that are associated with patient 
outcomes. This is in contrast to cases of medical 
OHCA in which prognostic factors are well estab-
lished; these include response time, the arrest being 
witnessed, the presence of bystander cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation (CPR) and an initial rhythm that 
is shockable.2
Prior studies in traumatic OHCA have reported 
descriptive statistics of those who achieved return 
of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or those who 
survived to hospital discharge.3–7 In the absence 
of multivariable models, it is difficult to deter-
mine which factors are associated with patient 
survival and which may be confounded by other 
factors. Only two prior studies have used multi-
variable models in traumatic OHCA3 6; however, 
these studies focused on the impact of advanced 
interventions, such as airway device type and chest 
tube insertion, or physiological measures. As a 
result, there is limited evidence available to ascer-
tain whether known prognostic factors in medical 
aetiology, including key Utstein variables,8 are also 
predictive in traumatic aetiology.
In this study, we aim to investigate factors that are 
associated with outcomes from traumatic OHCA 
using multivariable logistic regression models. 
Specifically, we aim to focus on Utstein factors asso-
ciated with achieving prehospital ROSC and having 
ROSC on arrival at hospital.

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Cardiac arrest variables are reported using the 
Utstein style, a set of variables that have been 
used to determine prognostic factors in cardiac 
arrest. However, whether those variables are 
predictive of outcome in traumatic out of 
hospital arrest is not known. 
What this study adds?
 
► Using data extracted from the Victorian Cardiac 
Arrest Registry, we found Utsein characteristics 
predictive of achieving ROSC and survival to 
hospital. Arresting rhythm was the only variable 
associated with positive associations for both 
of these outcomes in multivariate models. 
Specifically, response time, witnessed arrest, 
and bystander CPR were not associated with 
outcomes. There is a need to include additional 
information in cardiac arrest registries, 
particularly detailed injury data.

experienced an OHCA of traumatic aetiology (excluding those 
with a mechanism of hanging or drowning) and suffered an 
arrest between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2014.
setting
The study was conducted in the state of Victoria, Australia, which 
has a population of approximately 5.6 
million people,9 75% of 
whom reside in the metropolitan region of Melbourne. Ambu-
lance Victoria (AV) is the sole provider of emergency medical 
services (EMS) in the state. AV delivers a two-tiered EMS system, 
with Advanced Life Support Paramedics (ALS) and Intensive 
Care Ambulance Paramedics (ICP). While physicians are used 
for secondary response (retrieval), they do not attend as part of 
the primary response. ALS paramedics are capable of laryngeal 
mask airway insertion, manual defibrillation, decompression 
of suspected tension pneumothorax in rural areas and intrave-
nous fluid and epinephrine administration. ICP paramedics, in 
addition to ALS skills, are authorised to perform endotracheal 
intubation, rapid sequence induction, Pneumocath insertion 
and administer a wider range of drugs. The administration of 
prehospital blood products was introduced in April 2011 for the 
ICP paramedic-staffed helicopter emergency medical service. 
Prehospital thoracotomies are not performed. Fire fighters and 
volunteer Community Emergency Response Teams provide a 
first response in select areas of Victoria. Paramedic treatment 
guidelines follow the recommendations of the Australian Resus-
citation Council (www. 
resus. 
org. 
au). During the study period, 
the treatment of traumatic OHCA followed ALS guidelines for 
presumed cardiac OHCA, with the addition of standard trauma 
management. Criteria for withholding or ceasing resuscitation 
attempts have previously been described.10 In short, paramedics 
can withhold resuscitation when there is clear evidence of 
prolonged cardiac arrest or when injuries are incompatible with 
life.
Victorian Ambulance cardiac Arrest registry
The VACAR is a population-based registry of all OHCA events 
attended by EMS in the state of Victoria, Australia. The registry 
captures in-field treatment data electronically and a highly 
sensitive search filter is used to identify potential cardiac arrest 
cases before manual review by registry personnel. The registry 
methodology, including data capture and completeness, and 
quality assurance processes have been described previously.11 
The Victorian Department of Health Human Research Ethics 
Committee (HREC) has approved VACAR data collection (No. 
08/02). Ethics approval for the current study was received from 
the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee 
(CF15/3030–2015001273).
definitions
ROSC was defined as any palpable pulse detected for >20 s 
during treatment by paramedics in the prehospital setting. 
Survival to hospital was defined as the patient having ROSC 
on handover from paramedics at hospital. VACAR defines 
‘prolonged downtime’ as cases where the duration between 
collapse and arrival of EMS is presumed to be >15 min. The 
Australian Bureau of Statistics’ Section of State (SOS) classifi-
cation12 was used to define whether the arrest occurred in an 
urban or rural location. As per the SOS classification, urban 
centre and locality (UCL) regions with a population of <1000 
persons were classified as rural. Age was dichotomised into 
those <65 years and ≥65 years. Trauma type was classified 
as blunt or penetrating. For the multivariable models, injury 
mechanism was collapsed into seven categories: motor vehicle 
collision, motorcycle collision, pedestrian, fall, shooting/stab-
bing, other or unknown. Due to low numbers in the subcate-
gories of falls (low falls: n=48, high falls: n=24, stairs: n=5, 
other: n=6), these were included as one group. The other 
category in the multivariable models included assaults (20%), 
crush events (20%), bicycle collisions (15%), train collision 
(pedestrian) (11%), fire exposure (9%) and industrial events 
(7%).
statistical analysis
Comparisons between cases that achieved ROSC and those that 
did not achieve ROSC were made using the χ2 test and the Mann-
Whitney U test, as appropriate. Univariate and multivariable 
logistic regression models were used to investigate patient and 
arrest factors associated with two outcomes: achieving ROSC 
and survival to hospital (ROSC on hospital handover). The 
Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 test was used to assess goodness of fit of 
the model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for both models 
to determine whether the exclusion of non-standard Utstein 
variables8 (region, prolonged downtime, trauma type and mech-
anism of injury) impacted on the significance of core Utstein 
variables. Data analysis was performed using Stata (V
.13.1, 
StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). A P value <0.05 
was 
considered to be statistically significant.
results
baseline characteristics
From July 2008 to June 2014, paramedics attended 2334 cases 
of traumatic OHCA, of which 660 (28%) received attempted 
resuscitation. ICP paramedics were present in 584 (88%) of 
those cases that received attempted resuscitation. Patients who 
received attempted resuscitation had a median age of 42.5 
years 
(IQR: 28–61), were predominantly male (72%), with their 
arrests most commonly occurring in a public place (71%) and 
resulting from blunt trauma (81%). Motor vehicle collisions 
(28%), motorcycle collisions (18%), pedestrian collisions (14%) 
and falls (13%) were the most common mechanism of injury that 
resulted in traumatic OHCA (table 1).
ROSC was achieved in 159 patients, representing 24% of the 
EMS-treated population. Comparisons between those achieving 
and not achieving ROSC (table 1) revealed that ROSC was 
achieved more commonly among arrests witnessed by EMS, and 
less commonly among cases of asystolic arrest.
Factors associated with achieving rosc
Events with age ≥65 years, witnessed status (an arrest 
witnessed by EMS relative to unwitnessed arrests), the arrest 
rhythm (shockable rhythms or pulseless electrical activity 
(PEA) relative to asystole), and the mechanism of injury (falls 
relative to motor vehicle collisions) were associated with an 
increased likelihood of achieving ROSC in univariate models 
(table 2). Events occurring in rural locations, the presence of 
bystander CPR and prolonged downtime were negatively asso-
ciated with achieving ROSC in univariate models. When cases 
were limited to only those that were bystander-witnessed, the 
presence of bystander CPR was not associated with achieving 
ROSC in a univariate model (OR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.40 to 
1.19, p=0.19). Multivariable models revealed that older age 
and arresting rhythm (shockable rhythms and PEA relative 
to asystole) were positively associated with achieving ROSC 
(table 2).

Factors associated with survival to hospital
Of those that received an attempted resuscitation, 95 patients 
(14.4%) survived to hospital (ROSC on hospital handover). 
Older age, arrest rhythm (shockable rhythms or PEA relative to 
asystole) and the mechanism of injury (falls relative to motor 
vehicle collisions) were associated with an increased likelihood 
of the patient surviving to hospital in univariate models (table 3). 
Events occurring in rural locations, increased response time and 
prolonged downtime were negatively associated with survival to 
hospital in univariate models. Results of the multivariable model 
demonstrated arrests occurring in urban locations, the arresting 
rhythm (shockable rhythms compared with asystole), and the 
mechanism of injury (falls relative to motor vehicle collisions) 
were associated with an increased odds of survival to hospital

(table 3). Trauma type (penetrating trauma compared with 
blunt trauma) was associated with a decreased odds of survival 
to hospital. Goodness-of-fit tests were not statistically signif-
icant for the models of achieving ROSC (Hosmer-Lemeshow 
χ2=9.26, P=0.32) or survival to hospital (Hosmer-Lemeshow 
χ2=9.57, P=0.30) indicating adequate model fit across deciles 
of risk.
sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis revealed that, for most variables, there 
was no change in the significance or direction of association 
between outcomes and the Utstein variables (witnessed status, 
the presence of bystander CPR, the arresting rhythm and 
response time) when excluding non-standard Utstein variables 
(region, prolonged downtime, trauma type and mechanism of 
injury) (see online supplementary appendix 1). The exception 
was age, which was non-significant in the multivariable model 
for survival to hospital when non-standard Utstein variables 
were included, however, became significant when the multivari-
able model was limited to the Utstein variables.
survival to hospital discharge
Of those patients who achieved prehospital ROSC, 15.1% 
(n=24) survived to hospital discharge. A single patient who did 
not achieve prehospital ROSC survived to hospital discharge. 
The 25 patients who survived to hospital discharge represented 
3.8% of those who received attempted resuscitation and 1.1% of 
the total traumatic OHCA population.
dIscussIon
The purpose of this study was to investigate factors associated 
with achieving ROSC and survival to hospital in a cohort of 
traumatic OHCA patients. Our results demonstrated limited 
predictors of these outcomes; arresting rhythm was the only 
variable that demonstrated positive associations with outcomes 
across both multivariable models. These results suggest that 
known prognostic factors in medical aetiology may not apply 
in traumatic aetiology. In order to inform prognostication, there 
is a need to identify other factors that may be associated with 
outcomes in traumatic OHCA.
This is the first study to use multivariable models to iden-
tify patient and arrest characteristics that are associated with 
outcomes from traumatic OHCA. Previous studies have used 
descriptive statistics to characterise a cohort of traumatic OHCA 
patients that survived to hospital4 or hospital discharge,13 or 
compared survivors and non-survivors.3 Pickens et al5 noted 
no differences in demographics and the mechanism of injury 
between survivors and non-survivors. This was supported by

Evans et al3 who demonstrated few differences between survivors 
and non-survivors using data from the Resuscitation Outcomes 
Consortium Epistry-Trauma and PROPHET registries; only the 
mechanism of injury and injury type differed between groups. 
Our findings that there were few predictors of outcomes in trau-
matic OHCA are consistent with these prior studies.
The major strength of our study is the use of multivari-
able models that enabled us to control for potential sources 
of confounding. These models demonstrated that older age 
was positively associated with achieving ROSC; a finding that 
has not previously been reported and is in contrast to cases of 
medical OHCA.11 T
wo prior studies in traumatic OHCA demon-
strated no difference in age between survivors and non-survi-
vors,3 5 while another demonstrated greater mortality in older 
patients.6 When controlling for injury severity, mortality is 
known to increase with increasing age in trauma patients14 and 
this has been suggested to result from pre-existing conditions or 
complications.15 In our study, we focused on early outcomes, 
rather than long-term outcomes such as survival to hospital 
discharge. Our finding that older patients were more likely to 
achieve ROSC may suggest that these patients have a lower 
threshold for cardiac arrest. Furthermore, a proportion of these 
patients may have been in a low-flow state in which a pulse 
was not palpable, but mechanical and electrical cardiac activity 
were still present. Further research is required to understand the 
age-related response and whether it relates to the mechanism, a 
concomitant medical event or the severity of injuries sustained. 
Consistent with the age-related association with achieving ROSC 
was our finding that patients with an OHCA following a fall 
had an increased odds of surviving to hospital when compared 
with those following a motor vehicle collision. It is known that 
patients with fall-related trauma are typically older, have a lower 
injury severity score (ISS) when compared with motor vehicle 
collisions,16 and are the most likely traumatic OHCA patients to 
survive to hospital discharge.3 This supports our hypothesis that 
specific patient subgroups may have a lower threshold for trau-
matic cardiac arrests. It is possible that a proportion of these falls 
may have been induced by a cardiovascular event and are not 
primary traumatic arrests. This may also be true for a proportion 
of motor vehicle collisions, particularly the cases with a shock-
able rhythm. However, in the absence of detailed injury infor-
mation, we could not determine the pathophysiological cause 
of their arrest or whether the older trauma patients had a lower 
injury severity score.
Conjecture currently exists as to whether blunt or penetrating 
trauma results in poorer outcomes. While some studies have 
showed no differences in outcomes between trauma types,5 17

an increased odds of survival to hospital relative to penetrating 
trauma. This finding is consistent with recent North American 
data.3 However, the reasons for this are not clear. Understanding 
the specific injuries in the blunt and penetrating trauma groups 
may facilitate greater understanding of this finding; however, 
this was not possible in the current study.
In contrast to our results that demonstrated limited factors 
associated with outcomes in traumatic OHCA, the predictors 
of outcome in medical OHCA are well established2 and have 
informed the development of the ‘chain of survival’.18 These 
predictors include the presence of bystander CPR and the arrest 
being witnessed by a bystander or EMS, both of which we 
showed to have no association with outcomes from traumatic 
OHCA. While bystander CPR rates in our region were higher 
than have been previously reported for traumatic OHCA,4 the 
utility of bystander CPR in traumatic cardiac arrest has been 
questioned7 19 and our results demonstrated that the presence 
of bystander CPR was not associated with achieving ROSC or 
survival to hospital in multivariable models. The presence of 
bystander CPR may also increase the likelihood of a paramedic 
attempting resuscitation in cases that are potentially futile. 
However, it was not possible to quantify this in our study.
In order to capture key patient and arrest elements in 
medical OHCA, the Utstein template was developed.8 This 
was originally developed in 1990 with a focus on non-EMS 
witnessed cardiac arrests of a presumed cardiac cause with a 
rhythm of ventricular fibrillation. This was expanded in 2004 
to include all EMS-treated cardiac arrests. While these factors 
facilitate a clear understanding of the impact of patient and 
arrest characteristics on outcomes in medical OHCA, our 
results suggest that the Utstein template may not provide suffi-
cient information to predict outcomes in traumatic OHCA. 
While our models also included variables outside of the current 
Ustein template, such as urban/rural location, injury type 
and injury mechanism, our sensitivity analyses that excluded 
these non-standard Utstein variables revealed that, with the 
exception of age in our model of survival to hospital, there 
was no change in the significance or direction of association 
between standard Utstein variables and outcomes from trau-
matic OHCA. Given the results of our study, there is a need to 
incorporate other variables that may facilitate a greater under-
standing of outcomes and assist in prognosticating in traumatic 
OHCA. The most obvious addition is that of detailed injury 
information. This is possible in regions where established 
trauma registries exist, such as in Germany6 and the UK,20 and 
is also possible in our region through linkage with the Victorian 
State Trauma Registry. However, this trauma registry is limited 
to those patients who are transported to hospital. Obtaining 
detailed injury information for those who are pronounced dead 
at the scene is challenging due to an inability to appropriately 
quantify and classify injuries. In these cases, obtaining detailed 
injury data is only possible through coronial data. This has 
previously been conducted in reviewing potentially preventable 
prehospital deaths.21 However, to our knowledge, combining 
coronial data for prehospital deaths with in-hospital injury 
information for those transported to hospital has not been 
conducted in traumatic OHCA. Regardless, there is a need to 
identify other data that may facilitate a greater understanding 
of factors associated with outcomes from traumatic OHCA and 
subsequently inform the development of novel interventions. 
Other Ustein-like consensus guidelines have been developed in 
patient subgroups, such as drowning,22 and major trauma23; a 
similar consensus document may be valuable for the subgroup 
of cardiac arrests resulting from trauma.
limitations
There are a number of limitations to consider when reviewing 
the results of this study. First, we had originally aimed to inves-
tigate factors associated with survival from traumatic OHCA. 
However, with only 25 survivors to hospital discharge, we were 
underpowered for any multivariable analyses. Low numbers of 
survivors is a problem that persists throughout the literature on 
traumatic OHCA,3 4 7 13 and subsequently, we focused on known 
predictors of survival; namely achieving ROSC and survival to 
hospital. Second, there was limited prehospital injury informa-
tion, such as an injury severity score. As this is also a common 
limitation across the traumatic OHCA literature, it potentially 
limits our ability to more accurately prognosticate in these 
patients. It is an area of research that we hope to address in 
the future through linkage to detailed coronial data. Addition-
ally, specific guidelines for the management of traumatic OHCA 
have recently been provided by both the Australian Resuscitation 
Council24 and the International Liaison Committee on Resusci-
tation.25 However, these guidelines were released after the end 
of the study period and as such, were not implemented in clinical 
practice during our study.
conclusIon
This study of traumatic OHCA patients who received attempted 
resuscitation demonstrated that there were limited patient and 
arrest characteristics that were associated with achieving ROSC 
or survival to hospital. Given that predictors of outcomes in 
medical OHCA may not apply in traumatic OHCA, there is a 
need to further develop cardiac arrest registries to incorporate 
additional information, particularly detailed injury information, 
which may help guide prognostication and the development of 
novel interventions in these trauma patients.
