Organophosphorus nerve agents interfere with cholinergic signaling
by covalently binding to the active site of the enzyme acetylcholin-
esterase (AChE). This inhibition causes an accumulation of the neuro-
transmitter acetylcholine, potentially leading to overstimulation of
the nervous system and death. Current treatments include the use
of antidotes that promote the release of functional AChE by an un-
known reactivation mechanism. We have used diffusion trap cryocrys-
tallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
determine and analyze prereaction conformers of the nerve agent
antidote HI-6 in complex with Mus musculus AChE covalently in-
hibited by the nerve agent sarin. These analyses reveal previously
unknown conformations of the system and suggest that the cleavage
of the covalent enzyme–sarin bond is preceded by a conformational
change in the sarin adduct itself. Together with data from the reac-
tivation kinetics, this alternate conformation suggests a key inter-
action between Glu202 and the O-isopropyl moiety of sarin.
Moreover, solvent kinetic isotope effect experiments using deu-
terium oxide reveal that the reactivation mechanism features
an isotope-sensitive step. These findings provide insights into the reac-
tivation mechanism and provide a starting point for the develop-
ment of improved antidotes. The work also illustrates how DFT
calculations can guide the interpretation, analysis, and validation
of crystallographic data for challenging reactive systems with
complex conformational dynamics.

A
protein’s structure can be described in terms of a multidi-
mensional energy landscape where different conformational
states are separated by energy barriers (1, 2). The protein moves
constantly across this landscape because of thermally driven fluctu-
ations and interactions with ligands and substrates. The motions and
dynamics of proteins are typically studied using techniques, such as
NMR and/or molecular dynamics simulations. However, conforma-
tional ensembles are also often encountered in X-ray crystallography,
enabling structural analysis of the spatial component of dynamics (3).
Although such ensembles of conformers can be critical for un-
derstanding a protein’s function, they can also generate electron
density maps that are difficult to interpret because of spatial aver-
aging. This problem has been encountered in crystallographic studies
on enzyme reactivation mediated by nerve agent antidotes (i.e.,
nucleophilic compounds that are used to treat intoxication by
chemical warfare agents, such as sarin, VX, or tabun). Nerve agents
potently inhibit the essential cholinergic enzyme acetylcholinesterase
(AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) by phosphonylating its catalytic serine residue
(Ser203) and therefore, rendering it incapable of hydrolyzing the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine (4). This inhibition causes acetylcho-
line to accumulate, leading to overstimulation of the nervous system
and eventually, death. Treatment of nerve agent-inactivated AChE
with an antidote causes the release of the functional enzyme and the
formation of a phosphonyl oxime (Fig. 1A) (4, 5). Although the
process has been studied for decades, detailed mechanistic in-
formation is still lacking.
We have previously used X-ray crystallography to study the
complex between the nerve agent antidote HI-6 and Mus musculus
acetylcholinesterase (mAChE) phosphonylated by the nerve agent
sarin (sarin–mAChE) (Fig. 1 B–D) (6). The binary sarin–mAChE
complex and the ternary complex HI-6•sarin–mAChE can undergo
(multiple) chemical reactions in solution (Fig. 1A) (7, 8) as well as
in the crystal phase (9, 10). The addition of HI-6 to the sarin–AChE
complex leads to a reaction that cleaves the bond between the
oxygen of Ser203 and the phosphorus atom of sarin (Fig. 1A) (4, 5,
11). Furthermore, the sarin adduct can undergo a dealkylation
reaction, termed “aging,” that renders the enzyme resistant to
reactivation by HI-6 (7). Because of the system’s reactivity, the
composition of crystals obtained by trapping the productive com-
plex of sarin–mAChE and HI-6 is highly time-dependent, and the
crystals inevitably contain several conformers and chemical species.
These features make the system particularly challenging to study.
Significance
Enzymatic reactions can be difficult to study using X-ray crystal-
lography, because conformations and reacting species are tem-
porally and spatially averaged, and many reactions proceed to
completion before intermediates can be trapped. Here, we de-
scribe the combined use of diffusion trap cryocrystallography,
density functional theory calculations, and kinetic measurements
to investigate the reactivation of the essential cholinergic enzyme
acetylcholinesterase by the nerve agent antidote HI-6 after co-
valent inhibition by the nerve agent sarin. We have determined
prereaction conformations of HI-6 and propose that the reac-
tivating cleavage of the enzyme–sarin bond is preceded by a
change in the sarin adduct’s binding pose. The structures pre-
sented in this work will facilitate additional mechanistic analysis
and the development of novel antidotes.

 Analyses of the previously reported ternary complex [Protein Data
Bank (PDB) ID code 2WHP] revealed that HI-6 interacted with
the arenes of Tyr124 and Trp286 to form a well-defined sandwich
structure and that the sarin O-isopropyl moiety adopted a “closed”
conformation that sterically shields the phosphorus atom against
nucleophilic attack (Fig. 1C) (6). However, the electron density
maps did not define the conformation or position of the reactive
oxime moiety of HI-6, presumably because of spatial averaging
(Fig. 1D) (6). These findings were supported by molecular dy-
namics simulations of the system, which revealed significant con-
formational dynamics of the nucleophilic pyridinium-oxime ring of
HI-6 (6). Thus, in addition to the difficulties in defining the oxime
moiety, the structure did not reveal how the nucleophile ap-
proaches the phosphorus atom of the sarin adduct and could not be
used to support a detailed analysis of the reactivation mechanism.
Ligands that are challenging to model in the electron density map
are not unique to the system described above (12). For example, a
computational method for redefining noise and interpreting weak
electron density features revealed a previously hidden conformation
of the HIV capsid protein (13). We recently presented a study in
which we integrated conventional crystallographic refinement with
a quantum chemical cluster approach using implicit dispersion-
corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations to refine and
analyze the structure of a complex between mAChE and a pair of
enantiomeric ligands (14, 15). In conventional crystallographic re-
finement, the experimental data are supported by molecular me-
chanics force fields that ensure that the bond lengths and angles of
the protein and ligands are realistic (16). However, in the enan-
tiomeric study, the experimental data did not unambiguously define
the conformations and intermolecular contacts of the studied com-
plexes. Combining crystallographic data with DFT calculations
made it possible to identify low-energy conformations that are
chemically plausible and consistent with experimentally derived
electron density maps. Here, we describe the use of a similar re-
finement strategy that combines diffusion trap cryocrystallography
and DFT calculations to identify low-energy conformations of the
complex between HI-6 and mAChE phosphonylated by sarin
(sarin–mAChE). The structure reveals previously unknown confor-
mations of the system and a plausible preattack coordination of the
nucleophile. The mechanistic implications of the structural analysis
were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis, studies on the
enzyme’s reactivation kinetics, and measurements of solvent isotope
effects using deuterium oxide.
Results and Discussion
Capturing Low-Energy Intermediates Using a Diffusion Trap Strategy.
Reactivation in the crystalline state was investigated in multiple time-
dependent soaking experiments. The HI-6 antidote was allowed to
diffuse into mAChE crystals pretreated with sarin during an in-
cubation period of 1, 2, 3, or 4 min, which was followed by rapid
vitrification to trap the conformational states of the crystal. The
progress of the reactivation reaction was visualized using electron
density maps (specifically, simulated annealing Fo − Fc omit maps),
which showed a time-dependent decrease in the intensity around the
sarin adduct (Fig. 2A). These results show that HI-6–assisted reac-
tivation occurs in the crystalline state at a timescale that can be
captured by the diffusion trap experiments.
To improve the sampling of the system and capture prereaction
conformational states, we performed over 80 soaking experiments
using an HI-6 incubation time of 3 min. The subsequent diffraction
experiments yielded nine refined crystal structures with resolutions
ranging from 2.2 to 2.7 Å. The system’s chemical and structural
complexity was clearly shown by the feature-rich electron density
maps of nine datasets, which show a common principal density
representing the scaffold of HI-6 (Fig. 2B). In addition, each of the
nine electron density maps had unique features. Of particular in-
terest were two datasets showing interconnected electron density
maps corresponding to HI-6 and the sarin adduct—we postulated
that the interconnection might make it possible to model the
previously missing HI-6 oxime moiety in the 2WHP structure.
One dataset was selected for additional refinement (resolution of
2.4 Å) (Fig. 2C and Table S1). The data were amenable to con-
ventional crystallographic refinement, generating an initial model

 (3minHI-6•sarin–mAChE) with a superficially acceptable fit to the
electron density map. However, the electron density corresponding
to the sarin adduct was weak and partly absent. The weak electron
density is likely a consequence of a reduced occupancy because
of partial reactivation (Fig. 2A), partial aging with loss of the
O-isopropyl chain (Fig. 1A), and/or spatial averaging because of
conformational dynamics. Although the data suggest that sarin is
bound to Ser203, the electron density maps were considered too
weak to allow reliable crystallographic refinement of the adduct.
In contrast, the entire HI-6 molecule was defined by electron
density, with the E and Z isomers of the oxime having similar fits.
During the initial refinement of 3minHI-6•sarin–mAChE, the occu-
pancy was set to 0.3 and 1.0 for sarin and HI-6, respectively. In
addition to the density defining HI-6 and the sarin adduct, there
were unaccounted positive difference peaks, especially close to the
indole ring of Trp86. Despite efforts to model all of the features
observed in the active site, the identities of several positive difference
peaks remain unclear. This ambiguity is probably because of the
temporal and spatial averaging of the system, some of which is at-
tributable to the reactivation reaction (Fig. 1A). In addition, the
features observed in the vicinity of the indole ring of Trp86 indicate
the presence of a ligand, possibly combined with conformational
mobility of one or several side chains. These features were more
pronounced in the B monomer, revealing an unproductive con-
former of the system in which HI-6 is nearly parallel to the indole
ring of Trp86 (Fig. S1). Attempts to model the reactivation product,
the phosphonylated HI-6, yielded inconclusive results. As a refer-
ence, the half-life of phosphonylated HI-6 is short, probably less than
1 s (5). Thus, the timescale of this experiment is not suitable for
trapping the phosphonylated HI-6. Other previously reported con-
formations and/or conjugation states that were considered during
the refinement are shown in Fig. S1.
Refinement of Low-Occupancy Conformers. To address the limita-
tions of conventional crystallographic refinement of low-occupancy
conformers, we used a quantum chemical cluster approach (14, 15,
17, 18) using DFT to optimize the positions of heavy atoms
(with hydrogens added where necessary) in key fragments of
the 3minHI-6•sarin–mAChE complex. To preserve the milieu of the
protein interior, while reducing the number of atoms to a level
compatible with quantum mechanical calculations, all atoms beyond
the
3minHI-6•sarin–mAChE interface were disregarded or pre-
vented from moving during optimization by fixing their coordinates.
Selected atoms in the vicinity of the sarin adduct (58–59 atoms)
were allowed to move during these optimizations. 3minHI-6•sarin–
mAChE systems comprising 280–281 atoms in total were optimized
using DFT (Table S2 and S3). The resulting atomic coordinates
were visually compared with the experimentally determined elec-
tron densities.
To obtain a final structure of the complex, the DFT optimiza-
tions were integrated with the crystallographic refinements. Several
alternative systems with different coordinates and protonation
states for atoms with positions that could not be unambiguously
determined from the electron densities of the initial crystallo-
graphic model were subjected to DFT geometry optimization. The
conformations obtained by DFT were then used as input coordi-
nates in a second round of crystallographic refinement processes.
By iteratively performing DFT optimizations and crystallographic
refinements in this way, a model was obtained that both converged
in the DFT optimizations and was consistent with the experimental
electron density maps. The deposited crystal structure (PDB ID
code 5FPP) was generated in the final set of crystallographic re-
finements and includes both the E and Z isomers of the oxime.
Plausible Near-Attack Conformation of HI-6 and a Previously Undescribed
Conformation of Sarin. The final structure generated by DFT
calculations and crystallographic refinements includes a pre-
viously undescribed conformation of the sarin adduct featuring
an interaction between the isopropyl moiety of sarin and the ox-
ygens of Glu202 (Fig. 3 A–C). The sarin conformation provides
space around the phosphorus atom, which is thus exposed to both
isomers of the HI-6 oxime (Fig. 3 A and B). The oxygen of the E
isomer is within van der Waals contact distance (3.3 Å) of the sarin
phosphorus atom. The carboxy amino-substituted pyridinium ring
of HI-6 forms a sandwich with the arenes of Tyr124 and Trp286
similar to that described previously (6).
Key interactions involving HI-6 and/or the sarin adduct in the
active site were investigated by computing the gas-phase interaction
energies (ΔEgas) of suitable fragment systems using dispersion-
corrected DFT (Fig. 3D and Fig. S2). The interactions between
the sarin adduct and the E- and Z-oxime isomers were attractive;
both isomers yielded similar interaction energies, regardless of
their protonation state. The calculations also indicated that, for
the studied fragments, the protonated forms of the oxime were
energetically more favorable than the deprotonated forms. The
interactions formed by the Ser203–sarin conjugate to Glu202
were also attractive, with interaction energies between −16.0 and
−14.2 kcal/mol. The conformation of the sarin adduct seems to
be stabilized by a nonclassical CH···O hydrogen bond formed
between the isopropyl of sarin and the carboxylic acid of Glu202,
with an interaction energy of ∼7 kcal/mol (Fig. S3 and S4 and
Table S4). The interaction strength of the CH···O hydrogen bond
is in accordance with the energy of previous identified non-
classical hydrogen bonds in AChE–ligand complexes (14).
In previously determined binary and ternary structures of mAChE
phosphonylated by sarin, the O-isopropyl moiety of the sarin ad-
duct was aligned along the axis of the active site gorge in a con-
formation that sterically shielded the sarin phosphorus against
nucleophilic attack by the antidote. In contrast to the structure
presented here, the side chain of Glu202 did not interact directly
with the sarin moiety; instead, it was coordinated to a water mol-
ecule that acted as a bridge between Glu202 and the sarin O2 atom
(6, 10, 19, 20). To further investigate the sarin adduct’s conformation,

complexes. In the figure, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus are shown in

 we determined the structure of the binary complex formed by sarin
and Homo sapiens acetylcholinesterase (hAChE; sarin–hAChE),
which has a different space group than mAChE (Table S1). A
superposition of sarin–hAChE and sarin–mAChE showed that
the O-isopropyl group is positioned in a way that shields the
phosphorus atom in both crystal forms, suggesting that the
shielding conformation is a preferred conformer rather than
merely being induced by crystal packing effects (Fig. S5).
Reactivation Kinetics Measurements Show the Importance of Glu202
and Reveal a Hydrogen Transfer Step. To clarify the role of Glu202 in
the context of reactivation, the structure and interaction energy
calculations were complemented with kinetic studies on HI-6’s
ability to reactivate AChE phosphonylated by sarin. Measurements
of the reactivation kinetics of WT- and Glu202Asn-substituted
mouse and human AChE showed that the mutation caused a 39- to
77-fold reduction of the reactivation rate in both the human and
mouse enzymes (Fig. 4A and Table 1). However, the binding affinity
of HI-6 to the phosphonylated enzyme was only marginally reduced
by the mutation (1.1- to 2.6-fold). The large reduction in the reac-
tivation rate and the negligible effect on the binding affinity support
our finding that Glu202 has a key role in the reactivation process but
little effect on the binding of HI-6. Thus, these results are consistent
with the structure and interaction energy calculations, which sug-
gested that Glu202 stabilizes the O-isopropyl moiety of the sarin
adduct in a conformation that enables nucleophilic attack on the
phosphorus atom by HI-6. Glu202 has previously been reported as a
key residue of AChE with an important role in catalysis (21),
phosphylation (22), and aging (23). Here, we also observed, in ad-
dition to the interaction with the O-isopropyl moiety, an interaction
between Glu202 and the methylene of Ser203 with an interaction
energy of ∼7 kcal/mol (Table S4).
To further investigate the reaction, its solvent kinetic isotope effect
was measured in H2O and D2O using WT human AChE. If a transfer
of one or more protons occurs in the rate-limiting step, the reaction
rate in D2O will be lower than in H2O. However, both solvents will
yield similar rates if the reaction only requires the complex to be in a
particular protonation state (24). As shown in Fig. 4B, the rate in
D2O was lower than in H2O. Furthermore, the reaction’s pH opti-
mum is 7.0, but its pD optimum is 8.0 (Fig. S6). Shifts in this direction
are commonly observed for enzymatic reactions and reflect the dif-
ference between deuterium and protium ionization (24).
Multiple Binding Poses During HI-6–Assisted Reactivation. The
structural and kinetic data for the 3minHI-6•sarin–mAChE complex
presented herein suggest a prereaction complex that agree with
previously reported reactivation kinetics of site-directed mutants
(ref. 25 and references therein) (Movie S1). Furthermore, in con-
junction with the previously reported structures, the prereaction
complex makes it possible to identify many of the chemical species
and conformational changes that are involved in the reactivation
cycle (Fig. 5).
The substrate of HI-6 is represented by the binary crystal
structure of AChE inhibited by sarin (sarin–mAChE and sarin–
hAChE). In these structures, the O-isopropyl moiety of sarin is
directed toward the indole ring of Trp86 and interacts with
Glu202 through a bridging interaction with a conserved water
molecule (19). This pose is the preferred conformation of the
sarin adduct in the crystal structures of both the human and
mouse enzymes (Fig. S5).
The complex formed by the initial binding of HI-6 to the binary
complex is assumed to correspond to the structure determined after
1 min of incubation in HI-6 (1minHI-6•sarin–mAChE; PDB ID code
2WHP). The binding pose of the sarin adduct in this ternary complex
is very similar to that of the binary complex: it retains the bridging
water molecule between Glu202 and the sarin moiety, and the sys-
tem’s coordination is largely unaffected by the binding of HI-6 (6).
However, there is a significant change in the conformation and
position of Trp286 that allows the nonreactive carboxyamino-
substituted pyridinium ring of HI-6 to form a sandwich with the
arenes of Tyr124 and Trp286. This conformation of Trp286 is
equivalent to the pose observed in the binary HI-6•mAChE (PDB
ID code 2GYU). Another striking feature of the structure col-
lected after a 1-min soak is its partially disordered electron density
map, which suggests that the oxime-pyridinium of HI-6 is highly
mobile, a conclusion also supported by molecular dynamics sim-
ulations (6).
The structure determined from data collected after a 3-min in-
cubation (3minHI-6•sarin–mAChE; PDB ID code 5FPP) and DFT
calculations suggests that the O-isopropyl moiety of sarin undergoes
a conformational change and forms a direct stabilizing interaction

 with Glu202, displacing the bridging water molecule. In addition,
the oxime moiety is positioned apically within contact distance of
the sarin phosphorus atom, oriented in a way that is consistent with
a nucleophilic inline attack, although other mechanisms may be
possible (26, 27).
The structure of the asymmetric unit’s B monomer reveals a
potential additional binding site for HI-6 close to Trp86 (Fig. S1).
However, arene stacking interactions with Trp86 in this structure
would place the nucleophile in an unfavorable position for re-
action, and therefore, it probably represents an unproductive HI-6
binding pose.
The proposed scheme implies that the carboxylic acid of Glu202
acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor that stabilizes the sarin O-isopropyl
moiety through a CH···O hydrogen bond. The kinetics measure-
ments indicate that the Glu202Asn substitution reduces the rate
constant of the reactivation reaction by a factor of 30–80 but has only
a marginal effect on the dissociation constant (Fig. 4A and Table 1).
The significant reduction of the rate constant supports the hypoth-
esis that Glu202 stabilizes the adduct in an oxime-accessible con-
formation, whereas the small effect on the dissociation constant
indicates that Glu202 does not directly influence the binding of HI-6.
These findings are consistent with the
3minHI-6•sarin–mAChE
structure and earlier studies of Glu202 substitutions (25, 28).
We have previously suggested that His447 and a water molecule
activate the oxime by a hydrogen transfer mechanism to generate a
deprotonated species that is presumed to attack the phosphorus atom
(6, 29). This proposal has been challenged by kinetics data, which
suggested that the oxime binds in its deprotonated form (30). The
potential transfer of a hydrogen was investigated by measuring the
solvent kinetic isotope effect during HI-6–assisted reactivation of
AChE inhibited by sarin (Fig. 4B and Table 1). The ratio of the rate
constants in H2O and D2O (Hkr/Dkr) was 3.1, indicating that a hydrogen
transfer occurs close to the rate-limiting step. The most likely acceptor
is His447, possibly assisted by a water molecule.
The presented reactivation cycle (Fig. 5) shows multiple struc-
turally distinct conformations that call for a review and maybe an
expansion of the currently used kinetic models. In addition, it opens
up for new approaches in computational design of new antidotes,
including attempts to shift the equilibrium to favor productive
prereactive conformations.
Conclusions
Recent advances in methods for preserving and analyzing con-
formational ensembles together with computational approaches
for extracting alternative protein and ligand conformations have
made it possible to use X-ray crystallography to investigate rare
conformations and molecular motions (12, 13, 31, 32). Here, we
have combined diffusion trap cryocrystallography and DFT cal-
culations to generate and analyze crystallographic data for a sys-
tem comprising the nerve agent sarin, its biological target AChE,
and the therapeutic antidote HI-6. This system is inherently com-
plex and challenging to study using conventional crystallographic
approaches. We present a structure that is consistent with our
DFT calculations and the reactivation kinetics. The structure
shows a previously unknown conformation of the sarin adduct that
allows the nucleophilic oxime moiety of HI-6 to approach and
bind close to the sarin adduct’s phosphorus atom, with the car-
boxylic group of Glu202 stabilizing the adduct in the oxime-accessible
conformation. The importance of this interaction is supported by
a Glu202Asn substitution that reduces the rate of reactivation by
factors of 39 and 77 in mAChE and hAChE, respectively. Solvent
isotope effect measurements show a decreased reaction rate and
an increase in pL optimum (L = D or H) when H2O is exchanged
for D2O, suggesting that a hydrogen transfer occurs close to the
rate-limiting step.
As illustrated herein, the integration of DFT calculations with
X-ray crystallography is a powerful combination that provides
unexplored possibilities for computational chemistry and struc-
tural biology. The combination of techniques allowed us to de-
termine a structure that may provide a starting point for analysis
of reaction pathways and structure-based design of improved
nerve agent antidotes.

Allgardsson et al.
 Protein Expression and X-Ray Crystallography. mAChE and hAChE were expressed
in HEK293F cells and purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatography.
Protein crystallization was done by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method.
HI-6•sarin–mAChE complexes were generated using a diffusion trap approach,
and data were collected at beamlines I911-3 and I911-2 at Max Laboratory.
Initial crystallographic refinement was performed using conventional meth-
ods, whereas the late-stage refinement included DFT geometry optimizations,
focusing on areas within the active site that showed ambiguous electron
density maps.
Computational Methods. All-atom protein models were prepared from the
X-ray coordinates of 3minHI-6•sarin–mAChE. The systems were thereafter re-
duced, and a chemical cluster approach (14, 15, 17, 18) was adopted, where
subsets of the atoms were fully flexible during geometry optimization using
implicitly dispersion-corrected DFT [M06-2X (33) /6–31G**]. After additional
reduction of the systems, interaction energies (ΔEgas) were calculated around
selected fragments (molecule pairs) using BLYP-D3/aug-cc-pVTZ (14). The cal-
culations were run at the High Performance Computing Center North (www.
hpc2n.umu.se).
Reactivation Kinetics and Data Analysis. The enzymatic activity of hAChE and
mAChE was inhibited by a molar excess of sarin. After verification of enzyme
inhibition and lack of residual inhibitor activity, different concentrations of HI-6
were added, and the percentage of reactivation as a function of time and HI-6
concentration was determined. Measurements were done in both H2O and D2O,
and the enzyme activity was determined by a modified Ellman assay (34).
