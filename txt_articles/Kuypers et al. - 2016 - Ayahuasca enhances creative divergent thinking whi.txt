Abstract
Introduction Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic
plant tea traditionally used in Amazonian shamanism. The tea
contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyl-
tryptamine (DMT), plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine
oxidase-inhibiting properties. Increasing evidence from anecdot-
al reports and open-label studies indicates that ayahuasca may
have therapeutic effects in treatment of substance use disorders
and depression. A recent study on the psychological effects of
ayahuasca found that the tea reduces judgmental processing and
inner reactivity, classic goals of mindfulness psychotherapy.
Another psychological facet that could potentially be targeted
by ayahuasca is creative divergent thinking. This mode of think-
ing can enhance and strengthen psychological flexibility by
allowing individuals to generate new and effective cognitive,
emotional, and behavioral strategies. The present study aimed
to assess the potential effects of ayahuasca on creative thinking.
Methods We visited two spiritual ayahuasca workshops and
invited participants to conduct creativity tests before and dur-
ing the acute effects of ayahuasca. In total, 26 participants
consented. Creativity tests included the Bpattern/line mean-
ings test^ (PLMT) and the Bpicture concept test^ (PCT), both
assessing divergent thinking and the latter also assessing con-
vergent thinking.
Results While no significant effects were found for the
PLMT, ayahuasca intake significantly modified divergent
and convergent thinking as measured by the PCT. While con-
vergent thinking decreased after intake, divergent thinking
increased.
Conclusions The present data indicate that ayahuasca en-
hances creative divergent thinking. They suggest that ayahua-
sca increases psychological flexibility, which may facilitate
psychotherapeutic interventions and support clinical trial
initiatives.

Introduction
Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic plant tea used
around the world for curing, divination, and to get in contact
with another supernatural dimension. It contains the seroto-
nergic 2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)
and monoamine oxidase inhibitors that render DMT orally
active (McKenna 2004; Riba et al. 2006; Schenberg et al.
2015). Acute subjective effects usually start between 45 and
60 min post-administration and include visionary experiences
with more intense emotions and increased rates of thinking
when the eyes are closed (Riba et al. 2001, 2003). Working
memory impairment after ayahuasca intake was shown to be
limited to less experienced users while absent in more expe-
rienced users (Bouso et al. 2013). It was suggested that the
latter group has developed mechanisms to compensate for the
acute impairing effects of ayahuasca (Bouso et al. 2013). A
study into the long-term effects found no evidence for

 detrimental effects on psychological or mental health, or cog-
nitive abilities, in a 1-year follow-up study, compared to con-
trols (Bouso et al. 2015).
Psychedelic drugs have gained a renewed interest as poten-
tial tools in therapy (Domínguez-Clavé et al. 2016). Double-
blind studies on the acute and long-term effects of psilocybin
on psychological function suggest that a psychedelic session
can produce life-altering experiences and long-term improve-
ments in personal well-being and induce a positive behavior
change (e.g., Gouzoulis-Mayfrank et al. 1999a, b; Griffiths
et al. 2006; Hasler et al. 2004). A majority of participants in
a study of Griffiths and coworkers (2006) reported that the
session was one of the most spiritually significant experiences
of their lives (Griffiths et al. 2006). More recently, the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health in the USA revealed
that lifetime classic psychedelic use was associated with a
significant reduction in psychological distress and suicidal
thinking (Hendricks et al. 2015). It has been suggested that
psychedelics such as ayahuasca might be, within an appropri-
ate psychotherapeutic setting, useful in the treatment of sub-
stance use disorders because it can result in positive and last-
ing lifestyle changes (dos Santos et al. 2016). A recent study
showed that ayahuasca enhances mindfulness-related capaci-
ties, a classic goal of certain psychotherapeutic interventions
(Soler et al. 2015). Changes in behavior and lifestyle may also
result from a psychedelic’s capacity to stimulate creative, di-
vergent thinking, which has also been shown to be an impor-
tant aspect in cognitive therapy (Forgeard and Elstein 2014).
Divergent thinking is taken to represent a style of thinking that
allows many new ideas being generated, in a context where
more than one solution is correct. The best example is proba-
bly a brainstorming session, which has the aim of generating
as many ideas on a particular issue as possible. In contrast,
convergent thinking is considered a process of generating a
single optimal solution to a particular problem. The latter em-
phasizes speed and relies on high accuracy and logic. Both
divergent and convergent thinking are seen as two main in-
gredients of most creative activities even though other pro-
cesses may also contribute (Guilford 1967; Wallas 1926).
Creative divergent thinking can enhance and strengthen
psychological flexibility by allowing individuals to generate
new and effective cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strat-
egies on their own which helps them to adopt adaptive inter-
pretations and coping styles (Forgeard and Elstein 2014).
Interestingly, it was shown that acute administration of aya-
huasca causes a decrement in the functional connectivity in
parts of the default mode network (Palhano-Fontes et al.
2015). It was suggested that as a result, there is more cognitive
flexibility and consequently potential enhanced creative think-
ing (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014). Interestingly, the acute effects
of ayahuasca on creativity may also outlast the acute intoxi-
cation phase. Frecska et al. (2012) showed that creative think-
ing, especially originality, was increased 2 days after the end
of a 2-week ayahuasca ceremony, when the acute intoxication
subsided (Frecska et al. 2012).
The present study aimed to assess creative thinking in par-
ticipants of ayahuasca sessions in a quasi-experimental study.
Assessments of creative divergent thinking, as well as conven-
tional convergent thinking, were scheduled prior to and during
the acute effects of ayahuasca in two separate groups involv-
ing two different settings.
Methods
Participants
The investigators visited two spiritual ayahuasca-using groups
and invited participants to enter the current study. Two differ-
ent groups were approached to test whether potential effects of
ayahuasca on creativity occur independently of setting or par-
ticipant characteristics. A total of 26 participants consented
after the goals and methods of the study were explained.
Exclusion criteria included current psychiatric disorder and
alcohol or other substance use disorders and evidence of cur-
rent significant medical illness. All participants were
Caucasian individuals of European and American (North
and South American) and middle-Eastern descent. They all
had an interest in psychoactive drugs for personal experimen-
tation, and their reported motivation for ayahuasca use was to
enhance introspection, self-knowledge, and personal growth.
Group 1 included 15 participants (10 women) with a mean
± SD age of 37.4 ± 5.8 and 15.5 ± 3.2 years of education. They
all had prior experience with ayahuasca, having taken it on an
average of 27.5 ± 33.4 occasions. Group 2 included 11 partic-
ipants (7 women) with a mean ± SD age of 52.0 ± 13.0 and
18.4 ± 1.5 years of education. All had also prior experience
with ayahuasca, having taken it on an average of 103.6
± 152.9 occasions.
The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent amendments
concerning research in humans and was approved by the
Sant Pau Hospital Ethics Committee. All volunteers gave their
written informed consent to participate. All participants had
abstained from ayahuasca, other psychotropic substances,
alcohol, and medications for at least 2 days before the assess-
ment session.
Study procedure
The assessment of each participant group was conducted sep-
arately. The setting in which ayahuasca was taken was quite
similar in both ayahuasca groups. Ayahuasca was taken in a
non-religious setting, and participants were not affiliated to
any ayahuasca religion. The main motivation of the partici-
pants was to use ayahuasca as a tool for self-knowledge and
3396

 introspection. Participants remained in dimly lit rooms, and
recorded music was played throughout the sessions. Sessions
were held in the evening, and in both groups, an initial aya-
huasca dose was served and approximately 1 h after this initial
dose, a second one was offered that the participants could take
or not.
Creativity tests were administered twice: the pre-ayahuasca
assessment was conducted in the afternoon around 3 h before
the start of the session. The post-ayahuasca assessment was
conducted during the acute inebriation around 1.5–2 h after
the initial dose, after which the second dose was offered. The
total ayahuasca volume taken by each participant was record-
ed, and samples (10 ml) of the ayahuasca teas were taken in
both groups to determine the concentrations of DMT,
harmine, tetrahydroharmine, and harmaline afterward.
Alkaloid concentrations were determined using a previously
described method and conducted by one of the researchers
(SB) using a previously described method implementing liq-
uid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass
spectrometry (McIlhenny et al. 2009).
Ayahuasca
The ayahuasca tea used by group 1 contained the following
alkaloid concentrations: 0.65 mg/ml DMT, 0.84 mg/ml
harmine, 0.76 mg/ml tetrahydroharmine, and 0.10 mg/ml
harmaline. Participants ingested an average ± SD total volume
of ayahuasca of 116.7 ± 17.1 ml, which contained the follow-
ing amounts of alkaloids: 75.5 ± 11.1 mg DMT, 98.4
± 14.4 mg harmine, 88.6 ± 13.0 mg tetrahydroharmine, and
11.3 ± 1.7 mg harmaline.
The ayahuasca tea used by group 2 contained the following
alkaloid concentrations: 0.96 mg/ml DMT, 0.48 mg/ml
harmine, 0.69 mg/ml tetrahydroharmine, and 0.10 mg/ml
harmaline. Participants ingested an average ± SD total volume
of ayahuasca of 44.5 ± 15.6 ml, which contained the following
amounts of alkaloids: 42.8 ± 14.9 mg DMT, 21.4 ± 7.5 mg
harmine, 30.8 ± 10.8 mg tetrahydroharmine, and 4.6
± 1.6 mg harmaline.
Two parallel versions of the creativity tests were adminis-
tered before and after ayahuasca intake. The order of admin-
istration was counterbalanced between participants, and the
total time to complete the battery was around 35 min.
Creativity tasks
Two verbal creativity tasks with non-verbal stimuli were used,
i.e., the Pattern/Line Meanings task (PLMT) and the Picture
Concept Task (PCT).
The PCT was composed of stimuli from the Wechsler
Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Each stimulus con-
tains between 4 and 12 color pictures shown in two or three
rows. Participants have to find an association between one of
the pictures in each row. They are instructed to provide the
correct solution as there is only one correct answer. Correct
answers are taken as the dependent measure of convergent
thinking. In order to be also able to assess divergent thinking,
we additionally asked participants to provide as many alterna-
tive answers as possible. This is the regular instruction includ-
ed in measures of divergent thinking, and it is used to calculate
several parameters, i.e., fluency, originality, and the ratio of
both, which reflect quantity and quality of divergent thinking.
Fluency is defined as the number of alternative associations.
The second parameter, i.e., originality, is calculated by evalu-
ating the originality of the alternative association relative to
those provided by all other participants in a session.
Alternative answers that were uniquely reported by a single
participant received an originality score of 2. Answers that
were shared with a single participant were valued as 1, and
answers that were shared by 3 or more participants were rated
zero. Mean originality (creativity) scores and ratio originality
scores weighed for fluency (originality/fluency) were used as
measures of divergent thinking. In total, 28 stimuli were
shown and participants had 1 min per stimulus.
In the PLMT, the participant had to give meaning to a
configuration of patterns or lines and generate as many expla-
nations for it as possible, trying to be as creative as possible. In
total, eight items were shown and participants were allowed
2 min for each pattern (Claridge and McDonald 2009). The
total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas
generated in response to the stimulus (i.e., fluency) and the
originality of these ideas were taken as dependent measures of
divergent thinking. Originality and the ratio between original-
ity and fluency were calculated as described in the description
of the PCT.
Subjective effects—visual analog scales
Once the acute effects had subsided, participants were asked
to rate the intensity of various aspects of the acute ayahuasca
experience using visual analog scales (VAS). These VAS were
horizontal lines ranging from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maxi-
mum). VAS items included the following: Bvisual effects with
eyes closed Bvisual effects with eyes open,^ Bbodily sensa-
tions,^ Bauditory phenomena,^ Bmodifications of affect,^ Bau-
tobiographic memories,^ Bemotional memories,^ Bdetachment
from own thoughts,^ Bconfronted with past events,^
Bconfronted with personal issues,^ Boverwhelmed by the ex-
perience,^ Bfear,^ Bincreased closeness to others,^ Bincreased
detachment from others,^ Bexperience of unity with universe,^
Bphysical comfort,^ Bphysical discomfort,^ Bself-acceptance,^
Bforgiving oneself,^ Bforgiving others,^ Bwellbeing,^ Beupho-
ria,^ Bsense of contact with god or a supernatural force,^ Bhap-
piness,^ Bsadness,^ Bsense of rebirth,^ Bnew intuitive revela-
tions,^ and Boverall intensity of the experience.^ Participants

 had to make a vertical mark on each line according to the
intensity with which they had felt a given effect during the
acute inebriation.
Statistics
Data was analyzed by means of the statistical package IBM
SPSS version 21. Independent sample t tests were conducted
on sociodemographic measures to check for potential differ-
ences between groups. A mixed factorial general linear repeat-
ed measures model with Bgroup^ (1, 2) as between subject
factor and BAyahuasca^ (before (baseline), after (ayahuasca
ingestion)) as within subject factor was conducted.
Subjective effects induced by ayahuasca were analyzed
separately for each group using one-sample t tests comparing
the scores on each VAS after ayahuasca versus a zero distri-
bution since previous studies have shown that placebo scores
are typically very low, not rising above 0 in a scale from 0 to
100 (e.g., Valle et al. 2016). Additionally, potential differences
in VAS scores between groups were analyzed using indepen-
dent samples t tests.
The significance level for all analyses was set at p = .05.
Results
Sociodemographic variables
Independent sample t tests showed significant differences be-
tween groups on age (t12.90 = −3.47; p = .004) and years of
education (t21.43 = −3.04; p = .006). With a mean difference
of 14.6 years, participants in group 2 were older than those
in group 1. Participants in group 2 had on average 2.9 years
more education compared to group 2. The two groups did not
differ in the number of times participants had used ayahuasca
(t10.70 = −1.62; p = ns).
Subjective effects—visual analog scales
Mean ± SD ratings on the different VAS items after ayahuasca
are shown in Fig. 1 separately for each group. The one-sample
t tests showed ayahuasca-induced significant increases in all
VAS items in the two groups relative to 0, i.e., group 1
(t14 = 2.56–11.79; p ≤ .001–.023) and group 2 (t10 = 2.86–
7.57; p ≤ .001–.017). Comparisons between groups did not
find differences in mean scores for any of the VAS items
(F24 = .003–1.77; p > .05).
Divergent thinking
Analyses of PCT measures showed a significant main effect of
group on fluency, originality, and ratio (originality/fluency).
Fluency and originality scores were higher in group 1
compared to group 2 while ratio was higher in group 2 com-
pared to group 1. PCT analyses also revealed an interaction
effect of ayahuasca by group on fluency. The latter indicating
that while fluency decreased in group 1 after ayahuasca inges-
tion compared to baseline performance, the opposite effect
was seen in group 2, i.e., they improved under influence of
ayahuasca. A main effect of ayahuasca on ratio was shown in
the PCT demonstrating that when corrected for fluency, orig-
inality scores improved under influence of ayahuasca com-
pared to baseline (see Table 1).
There were no statistical significant effects of ayahuasca,
group, or their interaction on the dependent measures of the
PLMT.
Convergent thinking
Statistical analysis showed a main effect of ayahuasca on the
number of correct responses in the PCT indicating that con-
vergent thinking decreased after ingestion of ayahuasca com-
pared to baseline performance (see Table 1). There was no
significant effect of group on the number of correct responses
in the PCT (Fig 2).
Discussion
The aim of the present study was to further investigate the
psychological mechanisms underlying the ayahuasca experi-
ence, and specifically whether ayahuasca acutely affects cre-
ative thinking. It was shown that during the acute inebriation,
ayahuasca caused a decrease in conventional convergent
thinking and enhanced creative divergent thinking, as mea-
sured by the PCT. All dependent variables associated with
the PLMT remained unaffected.
The ayahuasca-induced enhancement of divergent
thinking could potentially be linked to the effects aya-
huasca exerts on brain regions involved in creativity.
Three core networks, i.e., the default mode network
(DMN), including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
and posterior cingulate cortices, the central executive
network (CEN), including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
and posterior parietal cortices, and the salience network
(SN), including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and an-
terior insula, interact during divergent thinking via
corticostriatal-thalamocortical loops (Chávez-Eakle
et al. 2007; de Manzano et al. 2010; Fink et al. 2009;
Geyer and Vollenweider 2008; Jung et al. 2013; Pinho
et al. 2015). The thalamus feeds information into the
SN which in turn coordinates the other mentioned net-
works (Beaty et al. 2016; Uddin 2015). The SN
monitors events occurring outside of the body as
well as internal consciousness and is able to direct
attention to whatever is more important at a certain
3398
Psychopharmacology (2016) 233:3395–3403
 moment in time. It is suggested that especially
these shifts between these externally (CEN) and inter-
nally (DMN) oriented cognitive networks are very im-
portant in creative divergent thinking (Jung et al. 2013;
Perlovsky and Levine 2012). Interestingly, previous re-
search has shown that ayahuasca reduced thalamic gat-
ing of sensory and cognitive information (Riba et al.
2002). Taking into account the neuronal pathways pre-
viously described, this could lead to an increase in in-
formation fed into the salience network. Consistent with
this line of thinking is the fact that Riba and colleagues
(2006) showed an increase in blood perfusion in the SN
after ayahuasca ingestion. Previously, other imaging
studies with psychedelics also showed increased blood
perfusion or a higher metabolic rate of glucose in the
frontal and paralimbic areas during (e.g., anterior insula,
anterior cingulate) psilocybin and mescaline (Gouzoulis-
Mayfrank et al. 1999a, b; Hermle et al. 1992; Riba
et al. 2006; Vollenweider et al. 1997). In addition,
Alonso et al. (2015) found broad-band power decre-
ments in the EEG signal after ayahuasca compared to
placebo. Based on the knowledge about negative corre-
lations between EEG and BOLD (Moosmann et al.
2003), this was interpreted as reflecting increased
activation of areas involved in visual processing and
in the cognitive-emotional processing anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC), an area that is central to the SN.
Alonso et al. (2015) also showed a temporary in-
duced disruption of neural hierarchies by ayahuasca,
i.e., by reducing top-down control and increasing
bottom-up information transfer in the human brain
(Alonso et al. 2015). It was suggested that the higher
excitability of posterior regions in combination with the
loosening of the cognitive grip exerted by frontal re-
gions responsible for executive control may underlie
the associations and insights that emerge during the ex-
perience (Alonso et al. 2015). Palhano-Fontes and col-
leagues (2015) also found other parts of these networks
to be influenced by ayahuasca, i.e., they showed a dec-
rement in the functional connectivity in parts of the
DMN after ayahuasca ingestion (Palhano-Fontes et al.
2015). It was suggested that this could result in more
cognitive flexibility and consequently potentially en-
hanced divergent thinking (Carhart-Harris et al. 2014).
However, Petri et al. (2014) suggest that the picture is
more complex as they showed that the brain does not
become a random system after psilocybin administration
but still has stable connections which are different from
Fig. 1 Mean (±SE) of visual analog scale scores on 28 items during the ayahuasca experience

3399
 the placebo state and only present in the psychedelic
state (Petri et al. 2014). Likewise, Roseman et al.
(2014) showed an increase in between-network resting
state functional connectivity under psilocybin across
normally distinct brain networks (Roseman et al.
2014). This increased integration between cortical areas
could give rise to more associations (Petri et al. 2014)
and an increased influence of imagination on visual per-
ception (Roseman et al. 2014). Still, the precise neuro-
biological underpinning of how psychedelics may en-
hance divergent creative thinking remains largely un-
known, and further research is warranted.
Convergent thinking can be seen as the second phase in the
creative thinking process, i.e., focused on narrowing possibil-
ities to a workable solution after the ideas have been generated
through divergent thinking (Hennessey and Amabile 2009).
Studies have shown this phase to be associated with an in-
crease in CEN activity (Sowden et al. 2015). In the present
study, ayahuasca caused deterioration in convergent thinking.
Palhano-Fontes and colleagues (2015) found that ayahuasca
only influenced activity in the DMN without changing the
connection between DMN and CEN (Palhano-Fontes et al.
2015). The absence of ayahuasca enhancing effects on the
CEN, together with the decrease in thalamic gating and loos-
ened cognitive control described by Alonso and colleagues
(2015), could explain the negative effect of ayahuasca on con-
vergent thinking (Alonso et al. 2015). However, research with
other psychedelics, e.g., psilocybin, showed an increase in
functional connectivity between the DMN and the task-
positive network or CEN (Carhart-Harris et al. 2013;
Roseman et al. 2014).
Ayahuasca selectively affected performance in the
PCT and not in the PLMT. Anecdotal reports from par-
ticipants suggest that the stimuli of the PCT elicited more
novel thoughts due to their more complex and colorful
nature. In contrast, the stimuli in the PLMT contrast were
very simple black-and-white line drawings. The latter
probably gave less input into the system involved in
the generation of new ideas. Another point to be men-
tioned is the quasi-experimental design of this study
which potentially limits the conclusions that can be
drawn from it. It could be argued that because ayahuasca
sessions always followed the baseline session, and as it
is known that ideas can get more creative over time
(Beaty and Silvia 2012), a potential order effect could
have influenced the results. However, besides the fact
that parallel versions of tasks were used in a randomized
order to counter potential order effects, the double disso-
ciation, i.e., improvement of divergent thinking and im-
pairment of convergent thinking, suggests that results
were not subjected to the serial order effect.
Previously, it has been shown that the connection between
divergent thinking and mood is particularly strong and

 positive (Baas et al. 2008; Davis 2009), i.e., more positive
mood improves divergent thinking. In contrast, convergent
thinking and mood are related in a negative way: more posi-
tive mood lowers convergent thinking. Mood of participants
in the present study was generally very positive, which may
have contributed to their openness to creative ideas. Mood
ratings were only taken after drinking ayahuasca and could
not be compared to mood states before drinking; nonetheless,
they differed statistically from 0. In the future, placebo-
controlled studies including measures of mood could test
whether mood changes are a moderator in the effects of aya-
huasca. Another point which could be addressed in future
research is the usefulness of ideas generated in the divergent
thinking task as this is part of the definition of divergent cre-
ative thinking. By including for example a task in which this
quality can be assessed, e.g., the Balternate uses task,^ it can be
tested whether ayahuasca also improves this aspect of diver-
gent thinking.
It would be interesting and important in the light of poten-
tial clinical applications of ayahuasca to investigate whether
the effects are stable or also vary in time. It is known that
ayahuasca induces an intense modified state of consciousness,
starting between 35 and 40 min after administration and last-
ing approximately 4 h (Frecska et al. 2016). We showed that
during this period, divergent thinking was enhanced and
convergent thinking distorted. Soler et al. (2015) demonstrat-
ed that 24 h after ayahuasca intake, mindfulness-related ca-
pacities were enhanced (Soler et al. 2015). Mindfulness, a
state of nonjudgmental, sustained, and alert awareness which
improves people’s cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal
functioning, has been shown to be linked with convergent
thinking and less with divergent thinking (Lebuda et al.
2016). Based on these findings, it could be interesting to see
whether convergent thinking is recovered 24 h after ayahuasca
administration. It is suggested, based on a study of Bouso et al.
(2008) on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in post-traumatic
stress disorder, that the potential effect pattern of ayahuasca
would make it suited for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
The increase in divergent thinking during the acute phase
could help patients relive events, recalling various associa-
tions without feeling inhibited (Bouso et al. 2008; Frecska
et al. 2012, 2016). The sub-acute effects could then be suited
in a second, Bintegration^ session in which patients discuss the
experiences they had on ayahuasca and find strategies that
help them cope with intensive emotions. Future studies should
therefore not only focus on either the acute or sub-acute phase
but also take both stages into account.
In the past decade, a renewed interest in the thera-
peutic potential of psychedelics has emerged (Anderson
2012; McKenna 2004; Sessa and Johnson 2015). The
present study has shown that ayahuasca promotes diver-
gent thinking, an ability which has been shown to be an
important aspect in cognitive therapy (Forgeard and
Elstein 2014). It can therefore be suggested that ayahua-
sca possesses qualities that can promote a therapeutic
process. However, since convergent thinking is also a
critical aspect in therapy, and the current findings show
that ayahuasca impairs this facet during the acute phase,
future studies have to investigate whether this effect
profile changes over time. Additional research utilizing
a placebo-controlled experimental design, including ad-
ditional creativity measures, is warranted, before results
can be generalized.
