SUMMARY
Circulating levels of undercarboxylated and bioac-
tive osteocalcin double during aerobic exercise at
the time levels of insulin decrease. In contrast, circu-
lating levels of osteocalcin plummet early during
adulthood in mice, monkeys, and humans of both
genders. Exploring these observations revealed
that osteocalcin signaling in myofibers is necessary
for adaptation to exercise by favoring uptake and
catabolism of glucose and fatty acids, the main nutri-
ents of myofibers. Osteocalcin signaling in myofibers
also accounts for most of the exercise-induced
release of interleukin-6, a myokine that promotes
adaptation to exercise in part by driving the genera-
tion of bioactive osteocalcin. We further show
that exogenous osteocalcin is sufficient to enhance
the exercise capacity of young mice and to restore
to 15-month-old mice the exercise capacity of
3-month-old mice. This study uncovers a bone-to-
muscle feedforward endocrine axis that favors adap-
tation to exercise and can reverse the age-induced
decline in exercise capacity.
INTRODUCTION
The ability to perform exercise is an evolutionary conserved
function that has been essential for the survival of most verte-
brates and nowadays has significant health benefits (Neufer
et al., 2015; Zierath and Wallberg-Henriksson, 2015). During
exercise, muscle function needs to significantly increase; this re-
quires that the uptake and catabolism of the two main nutrients
of myofibers, glucose and fatty acids (FAs), markedly rise (Haw-
ley et al., 2014). As an anabolic hormone, insulin promotes
glucose uptake in myofibers and stores it in the form of glycogen
post-prandially (Saltiel and Pessin, 2002). However, insulin does
not promote glucose catabolism, and its circulating levels
decline during exercise (Coderre et al., 1995; Lund et al.,
1995). This suggests that the rise in nutrient uptake and in their
catabolism in muscle that occurs during exercise may be favored
by other secreted molecules, myokines (Catoire and Kersten,
2015) or hormones, the circulating levels of which would in-
crease during exercise. Conceivably, myokines and hormones
may cooperate to favor adaptation to exercise.
The ability of bone to sense mechanical forces, the physical
proximity of the two tissues, and the fact that exercise capacity
and bone mass decline at the same time have long suggested
that a crosstalk between bone and muscle may exist (Novotny
et al., 2015). The recent identification of bone-derived hormones
and of their receptors allows us to test if bone regulates muscle
function at rest or during exercise and to elucidate the molecular
bases of this function. Another reason to ask this question arises
from a feature of the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin: this
hormone favors physiological functions that, like memory and
male fertility, greatly decline with age (Oury et al., 2011, 2013).
This observation raises the possibility that osteocalcin may regu-
late other physiological processes severely affected by aging,
such as muscle function during exercise (Partridge and Gems,
2002).
In testing this hypothesis, we observed that the circulating
levels of osteocalcin double during endurance exercise in young
adult wild-type (WT) mice, decrease sharply before or around
mid-life in all species tested, and do not increase during exercise
in older mice to the same extent as in young mice. Exploring
these observations revealed that osteocalcin signaling in

 myofibers favors adaptation to exercise in part because it pro-
motes the uptake and catabolism of glucose and FAs. These
observations explain why exogenous osteocalcin restores the
exercise capacity of 15-month-old mice to that of 3-month-old
mice. In addition to its regulation of nutrient uptake and catabo-
lism, osteocalcin signaling in myofibers is also responsible for
most of the exercise-induced increase in the circulating levels
of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a myokine that promotes adaptation to
exercise in part by increasing the production of bioactive osteo-
calcin. Hence, a feedforward regulation linking together the
endocrine functions of bone and muscle appears to be neces-
sary and sufficient to favor adaptation to exercise.
RESULTS
Regulation of Osteocalcin by Exercise and Age
The growing number of functions ascribed to osteocalcin (Kar-
senty and Olson, 2016) raises the question of whether the circu-
lating levels of this hormone change in various physiological
situations. This analysis revealed that a single bout of endurance
aerobic-based exercise (40 min run on a treadmill at 30 cm/s,
80% VO2 max, thereafter referred to as exercise) increased
circulating osteocalcin levels of total, undercarboxylated, and
bioactive 2-fold in 3-month-old WT mice, while at same time
the circulating levels of insulin decreased. This increase in the
circulating levels of bioactive osteocalcin was due in part to an
increase in bone resorption, the arm of bone remodeling that is
responsible for osteocalcin decarboxylation and activation (Fer-
ron et al., 2010) (Figures 1A–1C). Circulating osteocalcin levels
also significantly increased in young women after a 45 min-
long exercise (Figure 1D).
In contrast, circulating osteocalcin levels greatly decreased in
all species tested in another physiological situation, aging.
Indeed, whether we measure total or undercarboxylated circu-
lating osteocalcin, these levels decreased by 70% in male and
female mice between 2 and 9 months of age. This was due to
a decline in Osteocalcin expression and in bone formation as
measured by serum PINP levels (Figures 1E–1H). This decrease
in circulating osteocalcin levels occurs at the time the ability of
mice to perform exercise declines, and circulating osteocalcin
levels do not increase to the same extent in 6- or 12-month-old
mice as in 3-month-old mice during exercise (Figures 1I and
1J). The same decrease in circulating osteocalcin levels was
seen in male and female rhesus monkeys between young (2–3
years) and middle age (13–15 years) (Figure 1K). In humans,
circulating osteocalcin levels reach their lowest point before 30
years old in women and 50 years old in men (Figure 1L).
The increase of circulating osteocalcin levels during exercise,
and their decrease with age when exercise capacity declines, led
us to test whether exogenous osteocalcin could increase the
exercise capacity of older WT mice. In a proof-of-principle
experiment, we first asked whether one intraperitoneal (i.p.) in-
jection of uncarboxylated mouse osteocalcin (osteocalcin)
(100 ng/g of body weight) immediately before exercise would
improve the exercise capacity of 3-month-old WT mice. This in-
jection raised circulating osteocalcin levels without affecting
those of insulin (Figures S1A and S1B, available online) and
increased the time and distance these mice run on the treadmill
at a constant speed (30 cm/s) before exhaustion by over 20%
(Figure 1M). In view of these results, 12- and 15-month-old WT
mice that have low circulating osteocalcin levels were injected
with osteocalcin (500 ng/g of body weight) prior to exercise.
This injection increased circulating osteocalcin levels more
than 4-fold and conferred to these older mice the ability to run
the same time and distance as 3-month-old untreated WT
mice (Figures S1C and 1N). Chronic delivery of osteocalcin
through mini-pumps (90 ng/hour) for 28 days also increased
circulating osteocalcin levels without affecting those of insulin
(Figures S1D and S1E), as well as the time and distance
10-month-old WT mice run on a treadmill before exhaustion (Fig-
ure 1O). Thus, exogenous osteocalcin is sufficient to reverse the
age-induced decrease in exercise capacity in mice.
Osteocalcin Signaling in Myofibers Is Necessary for
Adaptation to Exercise
The observations presented above raised the question of
whether osteocalcin is necessary for adaptation to exercise.
Given the influence of testosterone on physical activity and the
low circulating testosterone levels in male Osteocalcin (Ocn)�/�
mice, this question was addressed in female mice.
When forced to run on a treadmill at a constant speed until
exhaustion, 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old Ocn�/� mice run 20% to
30% less time and distance than WT littermates (Figures 2A
and S2A). Since exercise capacity may vary even in genetically
identical animals, experiments testing exercise capacity were
conducted in several cohorts of control and mutant mice (n =
8–13 per group). This reflected the absence of a signaling event
from bone to muscle since the same decline in exercise capacity

 was observed in mice lacking Osteocalcin only in osteoblasts
and post-natally (Figure 2B). Accordingly, this decline in exercise
capacity was not observed in 2-month-old Ocn�/� mice, indi-
cating that the osteocalcin regulation of exercise capacity is
not of developmental origin (Figure S2B). The same decrease
in exercise capacity was observed in several cohorts of
3-month-old mice lacking Gprc6a, the osteocalcin receptor
(Oury et al., 2011) (Figure 2C).
Ocn�/� and Gprc6a�/� mice display metabolic and/or behav-
ioral abnormalities that make the interpretation of any phenotype
linked to exercise difficult. To exclude these confounding factors
and determine if osteocalcin promotes adaptation to exercise by
signaling in skeletal muscle, we studied Gprc6a expression in
this tissue. A qPCR survey showed that Gprc6a was more highly
expressed in skeletal muscles than in most tissues, and more so
in oxidative muscles (soleus) that are needed for a prolonged
effort than in glycolytic muscles (EDL), and an in situ hybridiza-
tion analysis demonstrated that Gprc6a is expressed in myofib-
ers (Figures 2D–2F). Moreover, Gprc6a expression was 3-fold
higher in Ocn�/� than in WT muscle, and osteocalcin did not in-
crease cAMP production in Gprc6a�/� myotubes as it did in WT
ones (Figures 2G and 2H). In view of these data suggesting that
Gprc6a mediates osteocalcin signal in myofibers, we deleted
Gprc6a from myofibers by crossing mice harboring a floxed
allele of Grpc6a with Mck-Cre deleter mice (Bru
¨ ning et al.,
1998). Gprc6a expression was decreased over 50% in skeletal
muscles in Gprc6aMck
�/� mice (Figure S2C). Body composition,
glucose
tolerance,
and insulin sensitivity
were similar
in
Gprc6aMck
�/� and control mice (Figures S2D–S2F).
Starting at 3 months of age, all cohorts of Gprc6aMck
�/� mice
experienced a decrease in exercise capacity that was of equal
severity as the one noted in Ocn�/� mice (Figure 2I). This could
not be explained by a disruption of the intrinsic properties of
muscle since excitation-contraction coupling and resistance to
fatigue were not lower in Gprc6aMck
�/� than in control muscles.
Fiber type composition and size were also the same in muscles
of Gprc6aMck
�/� and control mice (Figures S2G–S2I). That a
similar decrease in exercise capacity was seen in compound
mutant mice lacking one allele of Osteocalcin and one allele of
Gprc6a in myofibers (Ocn+/�;Gprc6aMck
+/�) provides a genetic
support to the notion that osteocalcin is the ligand of Gprc6a in
myofibers that is responsible for Gprc6a regulation of adaptation
to exercise (Figure 2J). Moreover, a single injection of osteocal-
cin increased the exercise capacity of Ocn�/� mice, but did not
do so in Gprc6aMck
�/� mice (Figures 2K and 2L). At the same
time, multiple evidences suggest that the ability of osteocalcin
to favor adaptation to exercise is not secondary to its signaling
in the heart: Gprc6a expression is 20-fold lower in the heart
than in skeletal muscle (Figure 2D), heart function is normal in
Ocn�/� and Gprc6aMck
�/� mice, and deleting Gprc6a only in
cardiomyocytes does not affect exercise capacity in mice (Fig-
ures S2J–S2L).
Osteocalcin Signaling in Myofibers Promotes Uptake
and Catabolism of Glucose during Exercise
To determine how osteocalcin signaling in myofibers favors
adaptation to exercise, we used indirect calorimetry to measure
nutrient utilization and aerobic capacity in Gprc6aMck
�/� and
control mice running on a treadmill at an increasing speed (initial
speed 5 cm/s and increasing by 3 cm/s every minute until
exhaustion). In the conditions of this assay, the maximal oxygen
consumption was significantly decreased in Gprc6aMck
�/� mice,
whereas their respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was not affected
(Figures 3A–3C). These results suggesting that osteocalcin
signaling in myofibers promotes aerobic capacity during exer-
cise prompted us to test if osteocalcin signaling in myofibers
affects mitochondrial number/respiration and/or uptake and uti-
lization of nutrients.
The number of mitochondria in muscles was the same in
3-month-old Ocn�/� mice that already have a poor exercise
capacity, and WT littermates. Expression of a transcriptional
determinant of mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle adapta-
tion to exercise, Pgc1a (Da Cruz et al., 2012; Handschin and
Spiegelman, 2008), and of its target genes was similar in mus-
cles of Ocn�/�, Gprc6aMck
�/�, and control mice after exercise.
The activities of the mitochondrial proteins COX and SDH
were the same in Gprc6aMck
�/� and control muscles after ex-
ercise, and there was no detectable difference in mitochon-
drial respiration between WT and Gprc6a�/� myofibers that
were cultured in the presence of glucose, pyruvate, and amino
acids (Figures S3A–S3G). Given their negative nature, these
results need to be interpreted cautiously, yet they indicate
that the ability of osteocalcin signaling in myofibers to favor
adaptation to exercise is not secondary to a measurable
effect on mitochondrial number or function. Hence, we
turned our attention to nutrient uptake and catabolism during
exercise.
The main nutrient used by muscle to generate energy at the
onset of exercise is glucose that is stored in myofibers in the
form of glycogen (Lehninger et al., 2000). Glycogen breakdown
measured by the difference between glycogen content at rest
and after exercise was lower in Gprc6aMck
�/� and Ocn�/� mus-
cle than in control ones (Figures 3D and S3H). In contrast, liver
glycogen breakdown was the same in Gprc6aMck
�/� and con-
trol mice (Figure S3I). Furthermore, osteocalcin enhanced
glucose uptake, as determined by the uptake of 3H-2-deoxy-
glucose (3H-2DG), in WT, but not in Gprc6a�/�, myotubes.
The same was true in WT isolated soleus treated with osteocal-
cin (Figures 3E, 3F, and S3J). In vivo, the uptake of 3H-2DG was
significantly
increased
in
oxidative
muscles
in
WT
mice
receiving osteocalcin prior to exercise but was decreased in
those of Gprc6aMck
�/� mice after exercise (Figures 3G and
3H). Lastly, osteocalcin favored glycolysis, defined by the
extracellular acidification of the media (ECAR), in WT, but not
in Gprc6a�/�, myofibers (Figure 3I). Importantly, none of the
(H) cAMP accumulation in WT and Gprc6a�/� myotubes treated with vehicle or osteocalcin (Ocn).

 other proposed ligands of Gprc6a favored glucose uptake or

and

(Figures
S3K
and S3L).
To promote glucose uptake in muscle osteocalcin does not
affect the expression of Glut1 and Glut4 (Figure S3M), but rather
favors the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of
C2C12 myoblasts that express Gprc6a-myc and HA-Glut4-Gfp
(Figure 3J). Signaling through GPCRs can promote Akt phos-
phorylation, an event that is observed in muscles after exercise
and that allows the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma mem-
brane (Deshmukh et al., 2006; Lopez-Ilasaca et al., 1997). We
found that Akt phosphorylation was decreased in muscles of
Gprc6Mck
�/� and Ocn�/� compared to those of control mice
after exercise; conversely, acute or chronic administration of
osteocalcin induced Akt phosphorylation in WT myotubes and
muscle (Figures 3K and S3N–S3P).

 To assess the influence of osteocalcin signaling in myofibers
on the activity of the TCA cycle, we performed a metabolomics
study. This analysis showed that the accumulation of aspartate,
a reliable indicator of the cellular levels of the TCA cycle interme-
diate oxaloacetate, and of fumarate and malate, the two TCA
cycle intermediates that increase the most during exercise
(Gibala et al., 1998; Sahlin et al., 1990), did not rise to the
same extent in muscles of Gprc6aMck
�/� as in those of control
mice after exercise (Figures 3L–3N). Moreover, the contribution
of 13C-glucose to the labeling of each TCA cycle intermediate
measured
and
of
lactate
was
decreased
in
muscle
of
Gprc6Mck
�/� mice injected with 13C-glucose prior to exercise
(Figure 3O). This latter result suggests that the lower content of
TCA cycle intermediates in Gprc6aMck
�/� muscles after exercise
reflects in part a decrease in the entry of carbon originating from
glucose into the TCA cycle. This decreased uptake and catabo-
lism of glucose in muscle of Gprc6Mck
�/� mice explains why the
oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was 2-fold lower in Gprc6a�/�
than in WT myofibers when the only nutrient of these myofibers
was glucose (Figure 3P). The ability of osteocalcin signaling in
myofibers to favor glucose uptake also provides an explanation
for
the
increase
in
blood
glucose
levels
observed
in
Gprc6aMck
�/� mice running until exhaustion (Figure 3Q).
Osteocalcin Signaling in Myofibers Favors FA Utilization
during Exercise
Since FA uptake and oxidation in muscle progressively increase
during exercise (Hawley et al., 2014; Koves et al., 2005), we
tested if osteocalcin signaling in myofibers also affects these
processes during exercise.
We first measured muscle and plasma levels of acylcarnitines,
a reliable indicator of FA utilization in cells (Overmyer et al.,
2015). We found that the accumulation of long- and medium-
chain acylcarnitines seen in muscles of control mice after exer-
cise did not occur nearly to the same extent in muscles of
Gprc6aMck
�/� mice (Figure 4A). There was instead a significant
rise in acylcarnitine accumulation in the plasma of Gprc6aMck
�/�
mice (Figure 4B). Moreover, the levels of free L-carnitine that
significantly declined in muscles of control mice after exercise
did not do so to the same extent in those of Gprc6aMck
�/�
mice (Figure S4A). These results, which suggest that osteocalcin
signaling in myofibers is needed for efficient FA catabolism dur-
ing exercise, explain in part why osteocalcin did not increase
14C-oleate oxidation in Gprc6a�/� myotubes as it did in WT
ones, and why the OCR of Gprc6a�/� myofibers was significantly
lower than that of WT ones when oleate was the only substrate of
these myofibers (Figures 4C, 4D, and S4B). Plasma non-esteri-
fied fatty acid (NEFA) levels were significantly higher in
Gprc6aMck
�/� than in control mice after exercise, while glycerol
levels were unchanged. These results are consistent with the
notion that FA uptake and catabolism in muscle are decreased
in mice lacking osteocalcin signaling in myofibers (Figures 4E
and S4C).
How does osteocalcin favor FA catabolism in myofibers?
Once phosphorylated at Thr172, the cellular energy sensor
AMPK promotes FA utilization in muscle by increasing the activ-
ity of CPT1B, a transporter of long-chain FAs into the mitochon-
dria (O’Neill et al., 2014). AMPK phosphorylation at Thr172 was
reduced in muscles of Gprc6aMck
�/� compared to those of con-
trol mice after exercise, and conversely, exogenous osteocalcin
increased AMPK phosphorylation in muscles of WT mice during
exercise (Figures 4F and 4G). Likewise, phosphorylation of ACC
(Ser79) was decreased and the accumulation of malonyl-CoA
was increased in Gprc6aMck
�/� muscles after exercise (Figures
S4D and S4E). Osteocalcin promotes FA oxidation in muscle in
an AMPK-dependent manner, since it induces FA oxidation in
WT, but not Ampka2�/�, myotubes (Figure 4H). In contrast,
osteocalcin favored glucose uptake in an AMPK-independent
manner (Figure 4I). Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) favors hydro-
lysis of intracellular triglycerides into free FAs in muscle when
phosphorylated at Ser563 (Watt and Spriet, 2010). HSL phos-
phorylation was reduced in muscles of Gprc6aMck
�/� and
Ocn�/� compared to those of control mice, whereas Hsl expres-
sion was unchanged. Conversely, HSL phosphorylation was
increased in muscles of WT mice receiving osteocalcin prior to
exercise (Figures 4J, 4K, and S4F).
Furthermore, the expression of Cd36 and Fatp1, which facili-
tate the uptake of long-chain FAs into cells, and of Cpt1b, which
promotes their transport across the mitochondrial membrane
(Stahl et al., 2001), was decreased in Gprc6a�/� myotubes, while
osteocalcin increased the expression of Fatp1, Cpt1b, and, to a
lesser extent, Cd36 in WT myotubes (Figures S5A and S5B). This
explains why the expression of Fatp1, Cpt1b, and Cd36 did not
increase in muscles of Ocn�/�, Gprc6aMck
�/�, and Ocn+/�;
Gprc6aMck
+/� as they did in those of control mice after exercise
and why Fatp1 expression increased in muscles of WT mice
receiving osteocalcin prior to exercise (Figures 5A–5C).
Two observations identify CREB as one mediator of osteocal-
cin signaling in myofibers. First, CREB phosphorylation was
weaker in muscles of Gprc6aMck
�/� than in those of control
mice after exercise, and stronger in myotubes of WT mice
treated with osteocalcin. Second, the exercise capacity of
Gprc6aMck
+/�;CrebMck
+/� mice is as decreased as that of
Gprc6aMck
�/� mice (Figures 5D–5F). Accordingly, CREB medi-
ates osteocalcin regulation of glucose uptake in myotubes and
glycolysis in myofibers (Figures 5G and 5H). However, the fact
that osteocalcin induces FA oxidation equally well in control
and Creb�/� myotubes indicates that osteocalcin uses other
transcriptional mediators to favor FA oxidation (Figure 5I).
Taken together, these results indicate that osteocalcin
signaling in myofibers favors uptake and catabolism of both
glucose and FAs in a balanced manner during exercise. These
findings imply that osteocalcin signaling should be necessary
to generate the ATP required for optimum muscle performance
during exercise. In agreement with this hypothesis, ATP levels
were significantly lower in muscles of Gprc6aMck
�/� mice than
in those of control ones after exercise (Figure 5J). This low ATP
content, along with the decreased phosphorylation of AMPK,
suggests that osteocalcin signaling in myofibers regulates
AMPK phosphorylation in part in an AMP-independent manner
(Jensen et al., 2007).
Osteocalcin Is Necessary for the Increase in Interleukin-6
Expression in Muscle Occurring during Exercise
To determine if osteocalcin signaling in myofibers favors adapta-
tion to exercise through additional mechanisms, we performed a
transcriptomic analysis in muscles of control and Gprc6aMck
�/�
mice after exercise.

 The gene whose expression was the most decreased (80%)
in Gprc6aMck
�/� muscle after exercise was the one encoding
IL-6, a myokine whose circulating levels markedly rise during
exercise through previously unknown mechanisms (Whitham
et al., 2012) (Figure 6A). A more modest decrease of the
expression of the soluble IL-6 receptor was also observed,
whereas no other myokines known to influence exercise (Bos-
tro

in circulating IL-6 levels induced by exercise in control mice
was blunted in Gprc6aMck
�/� and Ocn�/� mice. Of note, IL-6
circulating levels also rise in young woman during exercise
(Figures 6D–6F). Moreover, the decrease in circulating osteo-
calcin levels observed in 15-month-old WT mice provides an
explanation
for
the
modest
increase
in
circulating
IL-6
levels observed during exercise; indeed, exogenous osteocal-

during exercise (Figure 6G). These observations identify

muscle and suggest that the majority of the increase in IL-6
circulating levels observed during exercise originates from
muscle.
The results presented above raise the important question
of whether or not osteocalcin signaling in myofibers during
exercise requires the presence of IL-6 in muscle or blood.
In vivo, injection of a neutralizing antibody against IL-6
prior to exercise did not prevent the increase in exercise ca-
pacity induced by exogenous osteocalcin in WT mice, and

circulation
or
in
myofibers.
However, IL-6 favors adaptation to ex-
ercise through previously described mechanisms and a novel
one presented below.
IL-6 Favors the Production of Bioactive Osteocalcin
during Exercise
Indeed, since IL-6 has been shown to signal in bone cells
(Tamura et al., 1993), we asked whether one mechanism
whereby IL-6 favors adaptation to exercise may be by favoring
the production of osteocalcin by osteoblasts and/or its activation
by bone resorption (Ferron et al., 2010). In cell culture, IL-6
decreased the expression of Osteocalcin (Ocn) in osteoblasts
but, more importantly, increased the expression of Rankl, a cyto-
kine that favors osteoclast differentiation, and decreased that of
Osteoprotegerin (Opg), a decoy receptor for Rankl and an inhib-
itor of bone resorption (Teitelbaum and Ross, 2003) (Figure 7A).
These results provide one explanation for why bone resorption
and circulating levels of bioactive osteocalcin significantly in-
crease during exercise in WT mice that have high circulating
levels of IL-6 at that time, but do not do so in Il6�/� mice (Figures
1A–1C, 7B, and 7C). This set of experiments reveals the exis-
tence of a feedforward regulatory loop linking the production of
1088
Cell Metabolism 23, 1078–1092, June 14, 2016
 osteocalcin in bone and the synthesis of IL-6 in muscle that ap-
pears to be necessary for the increase in muscle function during
exercise.
DISCUSSION
This study reveals that osteocalcin signaling in myofibers is
necessary to increase adaptation to exercise in part because it
promotes the uptake and catabolism of glucose and FAs in my-
ofibers, and in part because it increases the secretion by muscle
during exercise of IL-6, a myokine that favors the production of
bioactive osteocalcin (Figure 7D). This study also shows that os-
teocalcin is sufficient to reverse the decline in muscle function
occurring during aging.
Osteocalcin Signaling in Myofibers Is Necessary for
Adaptation to Exercise
During exercise, the uptake and catabolism of glucose and FAs
in myofibers increase. The fact that insulin exerts mostly
anabolic functions in muscle and that its circulating levels
decrease during exercise (Saltiel and Kahn, 2001) implies that
muscle function and thereby adaptation to exercise are regu-
lated by other secreted factors that would stimulate glucose up-
take into muscle, glycogen breakdown, and/or FA uptake and
catabolism. Conceivably, the circulating levels of these factors
would rise during exercise. It is precisely because its circulating
levels double during exercise that we tested if osteocalcin is
implicated in the regulation of adaptation to exercise. Analyzing
mutant mouse strains lacking Osteocalcin and/or its receptor
Gprc6a in a cell-specific manner showed that osteocalcin
signaling in myofibers through Gprc6a is needed for muscle
function during exercise. The fact that exogenous osteocalcin
could not correct the poor exercise capacity of Gprc6aMck
�/�
mice and that Ocn+/�;Gprc6aMck
+/� mice display the same
decrease in exercise capacity as Ocn�/� or Gprc6aMck
�/� mice
identifies osteocalcin as the main ligand of Gprc6a responsible
for its regulation of muscle function and adaptation to exercise.
Cell-specific and inducible deletion of Ocn established that this
function of osteocalcin reflects an influence of bone on muscle
that is not of developmental origin. This function of osteocalcin
is also not secondary to its signaling in the heart. Hence, by
signaling through Gprc6a in myofibers, osteocalcin is a systemic
regulator of the adaptation to exercise in adult mice.
Osteocalcin Favors Uptake and Catabolism of Nutrients
in Muscle during Exercise
While osteocalcin does not affect in any appreciable manner
muscle contractility or mitochondrial biogenesis, it favors the up-
take and utilization of nutrients in myofibers during exercise in
several ways. First, osteocalcin signaling in myofibers favors
the breakdown of glycogen, a major source of glucose for
contracting muscles during exercise. Second, it promotes the
translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma
membrane and thereby enhances glucose uptake and glycol-
ysis. None of the other proposed ligands of Gprc6a increased
glucose uptake and glycolysis in myofibers. Third, osteocalcin
signaling in myofibers increases FA uptake and catabolism.
Through these combined functions, osteocalcin signaling in my-
ofibers provides the carbon atoms necessary to promote the
activity of the TCA cycle and thereby produce the ATP that is
needed to increase muscle function. That osteocalcin signaling
in myofibers is important mainly during exercise is consistent
with the notion that the endocrine regulation of nutrient uptake
and utilization in muscle differs at rest and during exercise
(Egan and Zierath, 2013). These findings do not exclude in any
way the likely possibility that other molecules may contribute
to the regulation of adaptation to exercise. The fact that osteo-
calcin signaling in myofibers increases uptake and catabolism
of both glucose and FAs provides an explanation for why RER,
which reflects the respective utilization of both nutrients, is not
affected in Gprc6Mck
�/� mice during exercise.
A Crosstalk between Bone and Muscle Determines
Adaptation to Exercise
Our study also identified IL-6, a myokine whose circulating levels
rise during exercise and that enhances exercise capacity (Peder-
sen and Febbraio, 2012), as an osteocalcin target gene in mus-
cle. In turn, IL-6 favors adaptation to exercise in part by signaling
in bone to increase osteoclast differentiation and the generation
of bioactive osteocalcin. Thus, a feedforward loop between bone
and muscle promotes adaptation to exercise through at least
three synergistic mechanisms: first, osteocalcin enhances
the uptake and catabolism of glucose and FAs in myofibers.
Second, the rise in IL-6 secretion from muscle during exercise,
triggered by osteocalcin, allows for the generation of glucose
and FAs (Febbraio et al., 2004; van Hall et al., 2003). Third,
IL-6, through its regulation of bone resorption, increases the pro-
duction of bioactive osteocalcin (Figure 7D). This model does not
exclude the likely possibility that osteocalcin and IL-6 favor
adaptation to exercise through additional mechanisms.
Osteocalcin Signaling in Muscle Can Reverse the
Age-Related Decline in Muscle Function
The fact that osteocalcin is necessary for adaptation to exercise,
together with the precipitous decline of its circulating levels
before midlife in all species tested, raised the question of
whether osteocalcin could also be sufficient to reverse the
decline in muscle function that is caused by aging. Whether
administered acutely or chronically, exogenous osteocalcin
increased the exercise capacity of 3-month-old WT mice and
restored the exercise capacity of 9-, 12-, and even 15-month-
old mice to that of 3-month-old ones. This ability of osteocalcin
to reverse the age-related decline in exercise capacity in mice re-
quires that this hormone signal in myofibers. These results iden-
tify osteocalcin signaling in myofibers as a novel and powerful
means to fight the age-related decline in muscle function. Given
the growing number of molecules proposed to affect muscle
functions (Baskin et al., 2015), it will be important to determine
if osteocalcin synergizes with some of them to favor adaptation
to exercise.

 mice on a C57/BL6 genetic background. Littermates were used as controls
in all experiments. Mice genotypes were determined by PCR. Generations of
Ocn and Gprc6a conditional alleles have been described (Oury et al., 2011,
2013). For exercise studies, all mice were trained to run on a treadmill for
3 days (10 min/day, increasing speed from 10 to 17 cm/s, and an electric shock
at 1 mA to trigger running). Exercise tests were performed on mice fed ad
libitum at 2–6 p.m. The day of the test, mice were acclimated to the treadmill
for 5 min, followed by 10 min running at a constant speed (17 cm/s), followed
by a gradual speed increase up to 30 cm/s. Then mice run either until exhaus-
tion to determine endurance capacity, or for 40 min. A gradual speed increase
test was performed to determine the maximal VO2 during exercise: mice were
acclimated to the treadmill for 5 min, followed by 1 min running at 5 cm/s, fol-
lowed by a gradual speed increase (3 cm/s every minute) until exhaustion,
defined as the number of times a mouse fell off onto the electric grid during
1 min out of 15. For all biochemical and metabolic analyses, blood/tissues
were collected and processed either at rest or at the end of a 40 min run
(30 cm/s). i.p. injections of exogenous osteocalcin or IL-6 (Sigma) were per-
formed immediately before exercise. To neutralize IL-6, 500 mg of a neutralizing
antibody (R&D, #MAB206) (Pedersen et al., 2016) was administered i.p. 1 hr
before exercise. Osteocalcin was synthetized as previously described (Oury
et al., 2013).
Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were housed as described in Supple-
mental Information at the NIH Animal Center. All procedures and animal care
were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. Human healthy volunteers were used to assay osteocal-
cin (Elecsys, Roche Diagnosis) across lifespan (see Supplemental Informa-
tion). Human studies were approved by local ethic comittee of Lyon University,
France.
Energy Metabolism Studies
Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed as described (Lee et al.,
2007). Ex vivo glucose uptake in EDL and soleus muscles was measured as
described (Bru
¨ ning et al., 1998) with minor modifications (see Supplemental
Information). For in vivo glucose uptake, a bolus of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose
(3H-2-DG) (10 mCi) was administered before running (40 min at 30 cm/s).
3H-2-DG and 3H-2-DG-6-P content in muscle was determined by liquid scin-
tillation counter and normalized to muscle weight (see Supplemental Informa-
tion). Glucose uptake and FA oxidation in myotubes were assayed as
described (Sebastia
´ n et al., 2007). GLUT4 translocation was determined by
optic microscopy as described (Zeigerer et al., 2002) (see Supplemental Infor-
mation). OCR and extracellular acidification of the media (ECAR) in myofibers
were measured using an XF24 Seahorse analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences) (see
Supplemental Information). To analyze mitochondrial function, myofibers were
treated sequentially with oligomycin (10 mg/mL), FCCP (200 mM), and rotenone
(0.2 mM). OCR was recorded following administration of each of them.
Metabolite profiling was done at the Einstein Stable Isotope and Metabolo-
mics Core Facility. Metabolites from freeze-clamped skeletal muscles were
extracted, derivatized, and run for GC-TOFMS analysis (Qiu et al., 2014).
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis
was used to quantify glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites (Serasinghe
et al., 2015). The Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit (Wang-Sattler et al., 2012)
was used to quantify acylcarnitines by LC-MS/MS in plasma and muscle
(see Supplemental Information). 13C-glucose tracer analyses were done at
CASE Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (see Supplemental Information).
ATP was measured using commercial kit (Abcam). Ex vivo analyses of muscle
contractility and resistance to fatigue were performed as detailed in Supple-
mental Information.
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Serum osteocalcin, PINP, CTX, IL-6, and insulin levels were measured using
ELISA assays. Blood glucose level was measured using an Accu-Check gluc-
ometer. Cyclic AMP accumulation was measured using a commercial kit
(R&D). For gene expression, 1 mg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into
cDNA. qPCR analyses were performed using a SYBER green master mix
(Applied Biosciences) and a CFX-Connect real-time PCR (Bio-Rad). Relative
expression levels of each gene were normalized to the one of Hprt or Gapdh.
The genome-wide differential expression of Gprc6aMck
�/� versus Gprc6af/f in
muscle was measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (see Supplemental
Information). For western blot analyses, protein extracts were separated in
8% acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide (Bio-Rad) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes that were blotted using specific antibodies. For in situ hybridiza-
tion, muscles were frozen in liquid N2-cooled methylbutane. Samples were
sectioned at 10 mm using a cryostat. In situ hybridization was performed
with a DIG-labeled riboprobe. Mitochondria histomorphometry and enzyme
histochemistry were performed following standard protocols (see Supple-
mental Information).
Cell Culture
Culture of skeletal muscle myoblasts was performed as described (Gharaibeh
et al., 2008), using 15- to 20-day-old mice. Myoblasts were differentiated into
myotubes for 3–4 days in a medium containing 5% horse serum. For in vitro
gene inactivation of Gprc6a and Il6, myoblasts from either WT or mutant litter-
mate mice were isolated and differentiated into myotubes. For in vitro gene
inactivation of Creb and Ampka2, floxed myoblasts were isolated from mice,
then divided into two groups and infected with either empty or Cre-expressing
adenovirus for 2 days (University of Iowa). Muscle fibers from flexor digitorum
brevis muscle were isolated from 2- to 3-month-old WT or mutant mice.
Muscles were dissociated with DMEM 2% collagenase for 2 hr at 37�C in
5% CO2 incubator. Muscle fibers were disaggregated from the tissue using
a wide bore pipet and plated on matrigel-coated plates at approximately
50% confluence (see Supplemental Information). Myofibers were used after
overnight incubation. Osteoblast culture was performed as described (Ducy
and Karsenty, 1995).
Statistics
All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed
using unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test for comparison between two groups
and ANOVA test for experiments involving more than two groups. For all exper-
iments, *p % 0.05, **p % 0.005.
