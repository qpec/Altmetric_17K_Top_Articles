A
bdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an important mani-
festation of vascular disease in older adults,1–3 and rup-
ture of an AAA is a life-threatening condition.4 Traditional 
atherosclerotic disease risk factors, particularly age, male 
sex, smoking, and high total cholesterol, are known to con-
tribute to the cause of AAA.5–8 Although risk factors for AAA 
incidence have been reported in several prospective, epide-
miological studies,5–15 data are scarce on the lifetime risk of 
AAA, which is defined as the cumulative incidence of AAA 
between an index age and death, because lifetime risk esti-
mation requires substantial follow-up duration.14 In addition, 
information on AAA risk factors is constrained by sparse data 
for asymptomatic AAA,5,10 because most prospective stud-
ies focus on clinical cases.6–9,11–15 Although smoking is the 
most important risk factor for AAA, there are limited data on 
how smoking cessation contributes to the reduction of AAA 
risk in smokers.5,8,14 The objectives of this study were 3-fold: 
first, to examine the overall lifetime risk of AAA in the ARIC 
study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities), a large com-
munity-based cohort, as well as in subgroups defined by age, 
race, sex, and smoking; second, to prospectively assess the 
association between midlife atherosclerotic disease risk fac-
tors and clinical and asymptomatic AAAs; and third, to lon-
gitudinally investigate the harms and benefits for AAA risk 
associated with continuous smoking versus smoking cessa-
tion, respectively.

Objective—Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an important vascular disease in older adults, but data on lifetime risk 
of AAA are sparse. We examined lifetime risk of AAA in a community-based cohort and prospectively assessed the 
association between midlife cardiovascular risk factors and AAAs.
Approach and Results—In ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities), 15 792 participants were recruited at visit 
1 in 1987 to 1989 and followed up through 2013. Longitudinal smoking status was defined using smoking behavior 
ascertained from visit 1 (1987–1989) to visit 4 (1996–1998). We followed up participants for incident, clinical AAAs 
using hospital discharge diagnoses, Medicare outpatient diagnoses, or death certificates through 2011 and identified 
590 incident AAAs. An abdominal ultrasound was conducted in 2011 to 2013 in 5911 surviving participants, and 75 
asymptomatic AAAs were identified. We estimated the lifetime risk of AAA from the index age 45 years through 85 
years of age. At age 45, the lifetime risk for AAA was 5.6% (95% confidence interval, 4.8–6.1) and was higher in men 
(8.2%) and current smokers (10.5%). Smokers who quit smoking between visit 1 and visit 4 had a 29% lower AAA 
lifetime risk compared with continuous smokers but had a higher risk than pre-visit 1 quitters. The lifetime risk of 
rupture or medical intervention was 1.6% (95% confidence interval, 1.2–1.8). Smoking, white race, male sex, greater 
height, and greater low-density lipoprotein or total cholesterol were associated with an increased risk of clinical AAA 
and asymptomatic AAA.
Conclusions—At least 1 in 9 middle-aged current smokers developed AAA in their lifetime. Smoking cessation reduced the 
lifetime risk of AAA.

Results
At visit 1 in 1987 to 1989, there were 15 703 ARIC participants 
at risk of developing AAA, and 5778 of them attended the 
visit 5 ultrasound examination in 2011 to 2013. Demographic 
characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors at baseline are 
shown in Table 1. Compared with those who did not attend the 
ultrasound screening, the ultrasound subsample had a health-
ier cardiovascular risk factor profile at baseline (Table 1), as 
expected for a survival cohort after long follow-up.
From visit 1 through 2011, during a median of 22.5 years 
of follow-up, we identified 590 clinical AAA events during 
310 448 person-years of follow-up, yielding a crude incidence 
rate of 1.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75–2.06) per 
1000 person-years. In the ultrasound subsample, we identified 
75 additional asymptomatic AAAs based on the visit 5 ultra-
sound examination. Of the 75 asymptomatic AAAs, 60 had a 
maximal diameter of 30 to 39 mm, 11 had a maximal diameter 
of 40 to 49 mm, and 4 had a maximal diameter of ≥50 mm.
Lifetime Risk of Clinical AAA
Conditional on survival to 45 years of age, the lifetime risk of 
clinical AAA in the whole ARIC cohort was 5.6% (95% CI, 
4.8–6.1; Table 2), with a higher risk in men (lifetime risk of 
8.2%), whites (6.5%), current smokers (10.5%), and those in the 
top 2 tertiles of smoking pack-years (9.0% and 11.1%). The life-
time risk and incidence rate of AAA stratified by race, sex, visit 
1 age, smoking status, and pack-years are shown in Tables 2 and 
3, respectively. There was a dose–response or gradient relation-
ship of AAA lifetime risk with smoking status and smoking 
pack-years in the entire cohort and in men, women, and whites. 
In blacks, current smokers only had a slightly greater risk than 
former smokers, and participants in pooled pack-year tertiles 2 
and 3 had a similar risk to those in tertile 1. However, the life-
time risk in blacks stratified by sex and smoking status is less

interpretable because of the limited number of AAAs in these 
subgroups. Conditional on survival to 55 years of age, the life-
time risk (95% CI) of AAA by longitudinal smoking status from 
visit 1 through visit 4/3 was as follows: never smokers (1.4% 
[0.9–1.8]), quitters before visit 1 (4.1% [3.2–4.9]), recent quit-
ters (6.6% [2.3–9.7%]), and continuous smokers (9.4% [7.1–
10.9]). Those who had quit smoking after visit 1 for at least 3 to 
8 years (ie, recent quitters) had a 29% lower AAA lifetime risk 
compared with continuous smokers but still had a higher risk 
than participants who quit smoking before visit 1.
The clinical AAAs in the primary analysis included AAAs 
with rupture or corrective procedures and medically docu-
mented, asymptomatic AAAs. Because estimates of the inci-
dence rate and lifetime risk for more severe clinical cases are also 
potentially useful, we conducted a secondary analysis focusing 
on the symptomatic subgroup. After exclusion of asymptom-
atic hospital or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
outpatient AAAs, 181 clinical AAAs with a rupture or medi-
cal intervention remained, yielding an incidence rate of 0.58 
(95% CI, 0.50–0.67) per 1000 person-years and a lifetime risk 
of 1.6% (95% CI, 1.2–1.8). Among the 181 cases, 27 had rup-
tures and 175 had medical intervention, with 21 of them hav-
ing both. The incidence rates (95% CI)/lifetime risks (95% 
CI) by major risk factor categories were as follows: women 
−0.19 (0.14–0.27)/0.6 (0.3–0.9), men −1.11 (0.94–1.30)/2.7 
(2.0–3.2), blacks −0.28 (0.19–0.43)/0.8 (0.1–1.2), whites −0.69 
(0.59–0.80)/1.9 (1.5–2.2), never smokers −0.15 (0.09–0.23)/0.6 
(0.2–0.9), former smokers −0.77 (0.61–0.96)/2.0 (1.4–2.5), and 
current smokers −1.13 (0.91–1.41)/2.7 (1.3–3.3).
Associations Between Visit 1 Risk 
Factors and Risk of Clinical AAA
Table 3 and Table I in the online-only Data Supplement show 
the associations between visit 1 risk factors and incident clini-
cal AAA. For age and smoking pack-years, we performed 
separate analyses for the first 10 years of follow-up and for 
>10 years of follow-up, as the proportional hazard assumption 
was violated when using the entire follow-up time but held for 
each period separately. In the basic adjustment model (Table 
I in the online-only Data Supplement), age, male sex, white 
race, current and former smoking, pack-years of smoking, 
hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, height, triglycerides, 
and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or total cholesterol were 
positively associated with incident clinical AAA, whereas dia-
betes mellitus and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 
negatively associated with AAA. BMI and alcohol consump-
tion were not associated with AAA (data not shown). With 
simultaneous adjustment (Table 3), the associations remained 
significant for most risk factors except triglycerides. The haz-
ard ratios for age and smoking pack-years were stronger for 
earlier follow-up (when the cohort was younger) than later 
follow-up. Among the risk factors identified, age, smoking 
status, and pack-years showed the strongest associations with 
AAA, with hazard ratios ≈3- to 9-fold higher in the highest

higher in the highest smoking pack-year group, compared 
with the lowest ranked group for each of the risk factors.
Associations Between Visit 1 Risk Factors and Risk 
of Asymptomatic AAA Detected by Ultrasound
Similar to the clinical AAA data, white race, male sex, smok-
ing status and pack-years, greater height, and elevated LDL 
or total cholesterol at baseline were significantly and inde-
pendently associated with the risk of asymptomatic AAA 
(Table 4). Baseline age, hypertension, peripheral arterial

lesterol were not significantly associated with the risk of 
asymptomatic AAA (Table 4 and Table II in the online-only

ratios were >5-fold for current smokers and those in the top 
tertile groups for height or smoking pack-years at baseline.

status that was defined prospectively based on information 
obtained from visit 1 through visit 4, with the highest risk 
being for continuous smokers, followed by recent quitters and 
then quitters before visit 1 (P for trend <0.01; Table 5). The 
associations were independent of the other AAA risk factors 
and visit 1 smoking pack-years, which was associated with 
longitudinal smoking status and thus could confound the asso-
ciations. Compared with never smokers, those who had quit 
smoking after visit 1 for at least 3 to 8 years (ie, recent quit-
ters) still had ≈2.6- to 3.5-fold greater risk for both clinical 
AAA and asymptomatic AAA in the next 15 years of follow-
up, consistent with the lifetime risk data.
Discussion
In this population-based, longitudinal study for a median of 
22.5 years, we reported AAA incidence; AAA lifetime risk; 
and quantified AAA lifetime risk by race, sex, smoking status/
pack-years, and longitudinal smoking status. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first study to report the AAA lifetime 
risk in a community-based cohort with long follow-up. We also 
identified independent associations of clinical AAA incidence 
and asymptomatic AAA prevalence with traditional cardiovas-
cular risk factors, including longitudinal smoking status.
Lifetime risk estimates are useful indicators of the pub-
lic health burden of diseases in a population and various sub-
groups and thus are informative in guiding preventive and 
screening strategies.16 Lifetime risk estimates are also helpful 
in patient consultation and in improving public awareness of 
disease conditions because they are more readily understood 
by the general public than standard epidemiological risk infor-
mation (eg, incidence rate).16,17 The lifetime risk of AAA in 
our study was 1 in 17 and was higher in men (1 in 12), whites 
(1 in 15), current smokers (1 in 9), and those in the highest 
tertile of smoking pack-years (1 in 9). Although the lifetime 
risk of AAA is lower than that of the major cardiovascular dis-
eases such as coronary heart disease (1 in 2–3)18 and stroke (1 
in 5–6),19 the lifetime risk of AAA in high-risk subgroups for 
AAA is similar to the lifetime risk of other chronic diseases 
such as breast cancer (1 in 8 females)20 and venous thrombo-
embolism (1 in 12).21 There has been only one previous report 
of AAA lifetime risk that was based on electronic health 
records in England, with a median of 5.5 years of follow-up. 
That study reported a lifetime risk of AAA at 3.3%, 1.3%, 
and 0.9% for current smokers, ex-smokers, and never smok-
ers by age 90 years.14 In that study, 1 937 360 patients were 
recruited from 225 family practices, and their records were

linked across various data sources to capture AAA diagno-
ses, including cases with or without leak, rupture, or repair.14 
Information on smoking was self-reported by patients at base-
line. Detailed information on duration and amount of cigarette 
smoked was not available.
Smoking is the most important risk factor for AAA, as 
confirmed by prospective studies of clinical AAA6–9,11,14,15 and 
asymptomatic AAA.5 Compared with never smokers, current 
smokers in our study had a 6- to 7-fold greater risk of clini-
cal AAA and ultrasound-detected asymptomatic AAA, and 
those in the highest tertile of smoking pack-years had >5-fold 
greater risk of ultrasound-detected asymptomatic AAA and 6- 
to 25-fold greater risk of clinical AAA. The US Preventive 
Services Task Force recommends 1-time ultrasound screen-
ing for AAA in male ever smokers aged 65 to 75 years and 
selective screening in male never smokers aged 65 to 75 years. 
The US Preventive Services Task Force made no recommen-
dation for screening in female ever smokers of this age group 
because of insufficient evidence on the benefits and harms of 
screening. Our study, based on a long follow-up, showed that 
the lifetime risk of clinical AAA in women who were current 
smokers (8.2%) was similar to men who were former smok-
ers (8.1%) and higher than in men who were never smokers 
(3.9%). Our unique data on lifetime risk of AAA expands 
the previous report of an increased risk of AAA for women 
smokers during a median follow-up of 4.9 years15 and another 
report of a higher incidence of AAA in women smokers than 
in men who never smoked during a mean of 12.7 years of 
follow-up.22 These data may be useful to policy makers in con-
sidering preventive strategies for female smokers in the future. 
Our data also indicate that physicians may need to pay similar 
attention in monitoring female current smokers for the occur-
rence of AAA as to male ever smokers after they pass middle 
age. By all means, the best preventive strategy to reduce AAA 
risk in smokers is to stop smoking.
In addition, our longitudinal smoking data indicate that 
those who had quit smoking for at least 3 to 8 years (ie, recent 
quitters) still had an ≈2.6- to 3.5-fold increased risk for both 
clinical AAA and asymptomatic AAA in the next 15 years 
compared with never smokers, and their lifetime risk of AAA 
(6.6%) was higher than longer term quitters (ie, quitters before 
visit 1) and never smokers (4.1% and 1.4%, respectively). The 
findings from our study add to the 3 previous studies that 
obtained smoking history at baseline and followed up par-
ticipants for 5.5 years,14 7 years,5 and 16 years,8 respectively. 
These studies reported a 2.6- to 6.5-fold increased risk for 
clinical or asymptomatic AAA for people who had quit smok-
ing for <10 years.5,8,14 To the best of our knowledge, there is 
no other study of AAA that quantified AAA risk, including 
lifetime risk, according to longitudinal smoking status.
Several prospective studies have assessed the associa-
tions between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the 
risk of AAA.5–15 However, most of these studies focused on 
clinical cases without inclusion of asymptomatic AAA.6–9,11–15 
Although the overall risk factor profile for asymptomatic and 
clinical cases might be similar, the magnitude of associations

could be different. Only 2 prospective studies specifically 
investigated asymptomatic AAA detected by ultrasound.5,10 
The first identified 119 AAA cases from 4345 participants 
during 7 years of follow-up.5 The second, including 35 cases 
and 140 controls, retrospectively investigated the relationship 
between asymptomatic AAA and lipids, which had been mea-
sured 12 years earlier.10 Our study replicated the previously 
published positive associations of clinical AAA with age, male 
sex, white race, smoking status and pack-years, hypertension, 
peripheral arterial disease, height, and total or LDL cholesterol 
and negative associations with diabetes mellitus and high-den-
sity lipoprotein cholesterol.6–9,11,13–15 Our study also replicated 
associations of asymptomatic AAA with male sex, smoking 
status and pack-years, LDL and total cholesterol.5,10 Among 
these, the identification of white versus black race and height 
as risk factors for ultrasound-detected, asymptomatic AAA 
is the first report for asymptomatic AAA from a prospective 
study. It is interesting to note that height showed a stronger 
association with asymptomatic AAA than clinical AAA in 
our study (risk ratio 6.37 versus 1.64 for tallest versus short-
est tertiles), even though the distribution of baseline height in 
the ultrasound subset was similar to that of the whole ARIC 
cohort (Table 1). The biological mechanism linking height to 
increased risk of AAA is unknown. In a meta-analysis of adult 
height with vascular morbidity and death, height was associ-
ated with increased risk of death from ruptured aortic aneu-
rysm.23 The authors postulated that the higher risk of rupturing 
associated with longer arteries might explain the association.23 
Nevertheless, future studies are needed to evaluate whether 
height predicts the risk of AAA using other AAA definitions 
based on an expected section of a patient’s aorta according to 
height. We did not identify a significant association of alco-
hol consumption with either clinical or asymptomatic AAA, 
which agrees with some other studies.5,6,9,11 A study by Wong 
et al8 reported a positive association between AAA and total 
alcohol consumption, but the association was attenuated after 
adjustment for hypertension. Another study by Stackelberg et 
al12 found an inverse association between AAA and moderate 
consumption of alcohol, especially for consumption of beer in 
men and wine in women. Differences in sample size and bever-
age type might explain the discrepant findings across studies.
Some limitations of this study warrant consideration. 
There might have been proportionately more undiagnosed 
AAAs in individuals who were lost to follow-up, resulting in 
an underestimated incidence, and thus lifetime risk, of AAA. 
In addition, the lifetime risk of AAA was approximated as the 
cumulative incidence of clinical AAA through 85 years of age. 
This approach might lead to an underestimation of lifetime 
risk of AAA because (1) AAA may present beyond 85 years 
of age and (2) asymptomatic AAAs detected by our one-time 
ultrasound screening were not included in the calculation of 
lifetime risk because of a lack of information about the time 
of onset. The issue of a lack of information about the time of 
onset also applies to clinical AAAs for which we used the time 
of clinical presentation or the time of diagnosis to calculate 
the incidence rate and lifetime risk. This constraint could only 
be addressed in a longitudinal study with multiple ultrasound 
screenings. The missingness of undiagnosed AAAs would 
likely have been nondifferential with regard to exposure level 
and thus likely diluted estimates of association between AAA 
and exposures. In the 2011 to 2013 ultrasound screening, the 
people who were evaluated had a healthier risk factor profile, 
which might have impacted the number of AAAs identified. 
In the analysis of asymptomatic AAAs with risk factors, we 
adjusted for the potential selection bias caused by differen-
tial participation in the ultrasound screening. Moreover, we 
defined hypertension and diabetes mellitus based on measure-
ments of blood pressure and glucose or the use of correspond-
ing medications. The risk of AAA might be different across 
treatment status and the extent of blood pressure or glucose 
normalization. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether 
treatment for hypertension and diabetes mellitus influences the 
risk of AAA. Finally, although we excluded participants with 
AAA repair before the baseline evaluation, we might have 
still included some prevalent AAAs in the cohort at baseline 
because of lack of a baseline ultrasound screening. However, 
the prevalence of AAA in the ARIC cohort at the baseline age 
of 45 to 64 years should have been low.
In conclusion, in this community-based prospective study 
with a long follow-up period, at least 1 in 17 middle-aged 
adults and 1 in 9 current smokers developed AAA in their life-
time, although the lifetime risk of rupture or medical interven-
tion was lower. Those who had quit smoking for at least 3 to 
8 years before follow-up started showed a 29% lower AAA 
lifetime risk compared with continuous smokers. In addition 
to smoking status and pack-years, several other cardiovascular 
risk variables measured in middle age, including white race, 
male sex, height, and LDL or total cholesterol, were associ-
ated with future risk for both clinical AAA and ultrasound-
detected, asymptomatic AAA.

Highlights
• At 45 years of age, lifetime risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in women, men, blacks, and whites was 3.2%, 8.2%, 3.2%, and 6.5%, 
respectively.
• Lifetime risk for AAA was highest in current smokers (10.5%) and those in the top 2 tertiles of smoking pack-years (9.0% and 11.1%).
• Smokers who quit smoking between visit 1 and visit 4 had a 29% lower AAA lifetime risk compared with continuous smokers but still had 
higher risk than pre-visit 1 quitters.
• Female current smokers had similar lifetime risk of AAA (8.2%) to male former smokers (8.1%).
• Both baseline and longitudinal smoking status, white race, male sex, greater height, and elevated LDL or total cholesterol were associated with 
increased risk of clinical AAA and asymptomatic AAA.
