IMPORTANCE Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent among patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with morbidity and mortality. The efficacy and adverse
events of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in these patients are unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether treatment with sertraline improves depressive symptoms
in patients with CKD and MDD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Chronic Kidney Disease Antidepressant Sertraline
Trial (CAST) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 201 patients
with stage 3, 4, or 5 non–dialysis-dependent CKD, who were enrolled at 3 US medical centers.
The Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview was used to establish MDD. The first participant was
randomized in March 2010 and the last clinic visit occurred in November 2016.
INTERVENTIONS After a 1-week placebo run-in, participants were randomized to sertraline
(n = 102) for 12 weeks at an initial dose of 50 mg/d (escalated to a maximum dose of 200
mg/d based on tolerability and response) or matching placebo (n = 99).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was improvement in depressive
symptom severity from baseline to 12 weeks determined by the 16-item Quick Inventory of
Depression Symptomatology–Clinician Rated (QIDS-C16) (score range, 0-27; minimal clinically
important difference, 2 points). Secondary outcomes included improvement in quality of life
(Kidney Disease Quality of Life Survey–Short Form; score range, 0-100; higher scores indicate
more favorable quality of life) and adverse events.
RESULTS There were 201 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.2 [13.2] years; 27% female) randomized.
The primary analysis included 193 patients who had at least 1 outcome assessment after
randomization. The mean (SD) baseline QIDS-C16 score was 14.0 (2.4) in the sertraline group
(n = 97) and 14.1 (2.4) in the placebo group (n = 96). The median participation time was 12.0
weeks and the median achieved dose was 150 mg/d, which was not significantly different
between the groups. The QIDS-C16 score changed by −4.1 in the sertraline group and by −4.2 in
the placebo group (between-group difference, 0.1 [95% CI, −1.1 to 1.3]; P = .82). There was no
significant between-group difference in change in patient-reported overall health on the Kidney
Disease Quality of Life Survey (median score, 0 in the sertraline group vs 0 in the placebo group;
between-group difference, 0 [95% CI, −10.0 to 0]; P = .61). Nausea or vomiting occurred more
frequently in the sertraline vs placebo group (22.7% vs 10.4%, respectively; between-group
difference, 12.3% [95% CI, 1.9% to 22.6%], P = .03), as well as diarrhea (13.4% vs 3.1%;
between-group difference, 10.3% [95% CI, 2.7% to 17.9%], P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD and MDD,
treatment with sertraline compared with placebo for 12 weeks did not significantly improve
depressive symptoms. These findings do not support the use of sertraline to treat MDD
in patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD.

 C
hronic kidney disease (CKD) affected 15% of the US
population in 2016,1 and in 2013, depression was re-
ported to be present in up to 25% of patients with CKD,
which is 4 times higher than the prevalence in the general
population.2,3 Comorbid depression was independently asso-
ciated with hospitalization, cardiovascular events, and death
among patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD and among
those dependent on dialysis.4-9 Depression also significantly
worsened patient-centered outcomes and was associated with
dialysis initiation, lower quality of life, greater symptom bur-
den,sexualdysfunction,andnonadherencetomedicationsand
dietary restrictions.10,11
Evidence for placebo-controlled efficacy of commonly
used antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), is limited among patients with CKD,
who generally have been excluded from large randomized
trials of antidepressant medication treatment due to safety
concerns.12-14 There is a need to establish whether antide-
pressant medications are safe and efficacious in patients with
CKD who are at a disproportionately higher risk for both
depression and its complications.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether treat-
ment with sertraline would improve depressive symptoms in
patients with non–dialysis-dependent stage 3, 4, or 5 CKD and
major depressive disorder (MDD).
Methods
Study Design
The Chronic Kidney Disease Antidepressant Sertraline Trial
(CAST) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
design, 12-week flexible-dose randomized clinical trial con-
ducted at 3 large medical centers in Dallas, Texas (University of
TexasSouthwesternMedicalCenter,ParklandHospital,andthe
Veterans Affairs North Texas Health Care System). Detailed
methods were published.15 The trial protocol appears in
Supplement 1. The data analysis plan appears in Supplement 2.
The study was approved by the institutional review boards
at each site and conducted per good clinical practice guide-
lines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Writ-
teninformedconsentwasobtainedfromeveryparticipantprior
to enrollment. The study was monitored by an independent
data and safety monitoring board.
Participants and Eligibility
Individuals with stage 3, 4, or 5 non–dialysis-dependent CKD
presenting to primary care or CKD clinics were screened with
the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–
Self-Reported (QIDS-SR16) and deemed eligible if they had a
score of 11 or greater (score range, 0-27). This instrument was
previously validated for depression screening and shown to
be independently associated with outcomes among individu-
als with CKD.16,17
Individuals who provided consent completed the Mini
International Neuropsychiatric Interview,18 which is based on
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV), to confirm current unipolar MDD
and exclude other psychiatric conditions (ie, bipolar dis-
order or psychosis). Participants then completed a 1-week
single-blind placebo run-in to exclude those who were non-
adherent and ensure each individual still met the eligibility
criterion of having a 16-item Quick Inventory of Depression
Symptomatology–Clinician Rated (QIDS-C16) score of 11 or
greater. Those who successfully completed the run-in (score
of ≥11 on the QIDS-C16 and took ≥65% of study drug by pill
count) were randomized by concealed allocation to 50 mg/d
of either sertraline or matching placebo.
After randomization, participants attended clinic visits ev-
ery 2 weeks for 6 weeks, then every 3 weeks for the remain-
ing 6 weeks during the double-blind phase of the study (eFig-
ure in Supplement 3). Dose was escalated by 50 mg/d at each
successive visit to a potential maximum dose of 200 mg/d
based on tolerability and response using a previously de-
scribed measurement-based care protocol.12,13,15,19 The dose
was kept constant for the last 6 weeks of the study. Adher-
ence was ascertained by using pill counts at each visit, with
nonadherence defined as having taken less than 80% of the
drug.After12weeks,thedrugwastaperedatarateof50mg/wk
until completely discontinued. Participants were reassessed
for depression 2 weeks after discontinuation and offered open-
label sertraline or other therapy, which was managed by pri-
mary care or mental health physicians.
Adults with non–dialysis-dependent CKD stage 3, 4,
or 5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2)
were invited to participate. The inclusion criteria were
changed to an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than
45 mL/min/1.73 m2 early during the study in response to the
National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Dis-
eases recommendation to reduce sample heterogeneity. There
was no lower eligibility threshold for estimated glomerular fil-
tration rate. Patients were excluded for the following rea-
sons: inability to provide consent; having a functioning kid-
ney transplant or requiring maintenance dialysis; having a
transaminase elevation 3 or greater times the upper limit of
normal; receiving current treatment with an antidepressant or
other serotonergic drugs, or previous sertraline treatment fail-
ure; receiving psychotherapy for depression within 3 months;
Key Points
Question Does treatment with sertraline improve depressive
symptoms in patients with stage 3, 4, or 5 non–dialysis-dependent
chronic kidney disease and major depressive disorder?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 201
patients with non–dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease and
at least moderate depressive symptoms, the use of sertraline vs
placebo did not result in a statistically significant difference in
symptom improvement over 12 weeks (−4.1 points vs −4.2 points,
respectively, of 27 possible points on the 16-item Quick Inventory
of Depression Symptomatology–Clinician Rated).
Meaning Sertraline may not be an effective treatment for major
depressive disorder in patients with non–dialysis-dependent
chronic kidney disease.

 having psychosis or bipolar disorder, dementia, or suicidal in-
tent; or being pregnant. Race and ethnicity were recorded by
self-report based on fixed categories to describe the diversity
of participants.
Randomization and Blinding
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using block random-
ization (block size range, 4-8) based on a computerized ran-
dom-number generator, stratified by hospital site ([1] the Uni-
versity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland
Hospital or [2] the Veterans Affairs North Texas Health Care
System)andCKDstage(3,4,or5).Treatmentassignmentswere
conducted by research pharmacists at each site using the pre-
specified random allocation sequence. Participants, research-
ers, and clinicians were blind to treatment assignment. The
QIDS-C16 outcome measure was administered by trained per-
sonnel who were blind to treatment assignments and mea-
surement-based care algorithms.
Study End Points
The prespecified primary outcome was improvement in de-
pressive symptom severity from baseline to 12 weeks deter-
mined by the QIDS-C16 at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12.
The QIDS-C16 assesses the 9 DSM-IV criterion symptoms of
MDD, with higher scores (range, 0-27) indicating more severe
depression.20
Prespecified secondary outcomes included (1) response
(≥50% decrease in baseline QIDS-C16 score) and remission
(score decrease to ≤5); (2) quality-of-life end points and over-
all functioning assessed by the 5-item Work and Social
Adjustment Scale (WSAS; in which each item is rated on a 0-8
Likert scale with 0 indicating no impairment; 8, severe
impairment; score range, 0-40)21 and the Kidney Disease
Quality of Life Survey–Short Form (KDQOL-SF version 1.3;
score range, 0-100; higher scores signify more favorable
quality of life),22 which were administered at baseline and at
6 and 12 weeks; (3) adverse events and tolerability assessed
by the occurrence of serious adverse events (ie, death, dialy-
sis initiation, hospitalizations, or bleeding requiring transfu-
sion), maximal global adverse effects reported on the 56-item
Systemic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects
(SAFTEE; rated on a 0-4 ordinal scale with 0 indicating none;
4, marked adverse effects),23 and maximal frequency, inten-
sity, and burden of adverse effects assessed with the Fre-
quency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating scale
(each item rated on a Likert scale as present 0%, 10%, 25%,
50%, 75%, 90%, or all the time).24 Adverse events and toler-
ability were assessed at every visit.15
Sample Size
Data collected during the pilot phase showed that individu-
als with CKD and MDD had a mean (SD) decrease in QIDS-SR16
score of 5.6 (4.1) points after treatment with an SSRI.15 A mean
antidepressant drug-placebo difference of 3 points or greater
on the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression is recommended
as a criterion for clinical significance when establishing guide-
lines for the treatment of depression.25 This is equivalent to
a difference of 2 points on the QIDS-C16, which was regarded
as the smallest clinically meaningful difference between the
sertraline and placebo groups.20 Assuming a similar SD of 4
points yielded an effect size of 0.5, a t test comparison using
a 2-sided α of .05 was estimated to be able to detect an effect
size of 0.5 with 80% power in a sample of 128 participants
(64 per group). A sample size of 200 (100 per group) was pro-
posed so that if the SD was unexpectedly larger at 5 points, re-
sulting in an effect size of 0.4, there would still be 80% power
to detect a between-group difference.
Statistical Analysis
Using the modified intention-to-treat principle, participants
were analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized
if at least 1 QIDS-C16 assessment after randomization was avail-
able. The QIDS-C16 score was compared between groups using
a repeated-measures mixed-effects model, with treatment
group as the between-participants factor and random inter-
cept and slopes as within-participant factors. Baseline QIDS-
C16 was included as a covariate. The interactions between hos-
pital site and CKD stage (3 vs 4 or 5) by treatment group and
time were tested but not retained unless significant.
Response and remission were tested using the same pro-
cedure for a mixed-effects model, which is appropriate for a
repeated binary outcome. A mixed-effects model for continu-
ous outcomes as described for the primary analysis was used
tocomparechangesintheWSASandtheKDQOL-SF,withbase-
line scores included as covariates. Given that (1) the amount
of missing primary outcome data was small, (2) mixed-
effects models allow inclusion of participants with missing
data, and (3) these models are unbiased when data are miss-
ing at random, imputation of missing data was not done.26
The proportion experiencing an adverse event; the maxi-
mum SAFTEE global assessment of adverse effects; and the
maximal frequency, intensity, and burden of adverse effects
at any visit were compared between groups using χ2 tests. A
binary outcome (any adverse effect at any visit vs none) was
created for each participant and compared between groups
using the χ2 test. The mean number of worsening SAFTEE
symptoms was compared between groups using a t test. Sta-
tistical tests were 2-sided and P < .05 was considered signifi-
cant. The statistical analyses were performed using SAS ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
There were 201 patients (mean [SD] age, 58.2 [13.2] years; 27%
female) randomized. The first participant was randomized in
March2010andthelastclinicvisitoccurredinNovember2016.

meaningful between-group differences in the proportion with
comorbid psychiatric illnesses, in the Mini-Mental State Ex-

participants in the sertraline group had a history of substance
dependence compared with 1 participant in the placebo group.

 intheplacebogroup(between-groupdifference,−1.6%[95%CI,
−4.7% to 1.4%], P = .29). Three participants in the sertraline
group and 2 in the placebo group were nonadherent (P = .66).
Efficacy Outcomes
The mixed-effects model showed no significant treatment
group main effect (P = .82) or interaction with time (P = .71) in
the QIDS-C16 scores (Figure 2). The mean change from base-
line to study exit in the QIDS-C16 score was −4.1 in the sertra-
line group and −4.2 in the placebo group (between-group dif-
ference, 0.1 [95% CI, −1.1 to 1.3], P = .82; Table 3). Figure 3
illustrates changes in the QIDS-C16 score from baseline to study
exit for individual participants.
The binary mixed-effects model for remission showed no
treatment group main effect (P = .57) or interaction with time
(P = .58). The proportion with remission was 15.5% in the ser-
traline group and 14.6% in the placebo group (between-
group difference, 0.9% [95% CI, −9.2% to 11.0%], P = .86;
Table 3). The mixed-effects model for response showed no
treatment group main effect (P = .54) or interaction with time

 (P = .97). The proportion of participants with a treatment re-
sponse was 32.0% in the sertraline group and 25.0% in the pla-
cebo group (between-group difference, 7.0% [95% CI, −5.7%
to 19.6%], P = .28; Table 3).
Functioning and Quality-of-Life Outcomes
The mixed-effects model for the WSAS showed no significant
treatment group main effect (P = .64) or interaction with time
(P = .33). The mean change from baseline to study exit in over-
all functioning by WSAS score was not significantly different
(between-group mean difference, −1.8 [95% CI, −5.4 to 1.8],
P = .32; Table 3).
There was no significant difference in change in patient-
reported overall health on the KDQOL-SF (median, 0 vs 0; be-
tween-groupmediandifference,0[95%CI,−10.0to0];P = .61).
The mixed-effects model for the physical component of the
KDQOL-SF also found no significant treatment group main ef-
fect (P = .55) or interaction with time (P = .98). No differ-
ences were observed in quality-of-life components from base-
line to study exit, except for improvement in sleep, which was

calculated separately for each time
point. Each of the 16 QIDS-C16 items
can yield a score of 0 to 3 on a Likert
scale. The score range is 0 to 27;
higher scores indicate more severe
depression; a score of 0 to 5

 participant receiving 200 mg/d of sertraline was hospitalized
with elevated liver enzyme levels. Liver biopsy indicated drug-
inducedacuteliverinjury,andsertralinewasdiscontinued.Be-
tween randomization and the first assessment of outcomes,
2 participants assigned to sertraline withdrew due to adverse
effects (Figure 1).
Of the 193 participants included in the modified intention-
to-treat analysis, 3 (3.1%) assigned to sertraline and 3 (3.1%) to
placebo discontinued treatment due to drug intolerance
(between-group difference, 0% [95% CI, −4.9% to 4.9%],
P > .99) (Table 4). Although there were no statistically signifi-
cant differences for worsening maximal adverse effect fre-
quency, intensity, or burden, the proportion with any vs no ad-
verse effects was higher in the sertraline group (76.1%)
compared with the placebo group (60.0%; between-group dif-
ference, 16.1% [95% CI, 2.9% to 29.2%], P = .02). Nausea or
vomiting was reported by 22.7% of the sertraline group com-
pared with 10.4% of the placebo group (between-group dif-
ference, 12.3% [95% CI, 1.9% to 22.6%], P = .03) and diarrhea
by 13.4% vs 3.1%, respectively (between-group difference,
10.3% [95% CI, 2.7% to 17.9%], P = .02; Table 4).

or quality of life in patients with stage 3, 4, or 5 non–dialysis-
dependent CKD and resulted in increased adverse effects com-
paredwithplacebo.Toourknowledge,thisisthelargestrandom-
ized,double-blind,placebo-controlledtrialtoprovideevidence
about MDD treatment with a commonly used SSRI in patients
with non–dialysis-dependent CKD, a chronically ill population
that is not only at significantly increased risk for developing
depression,2,3 but also its serious complications.4-9
Although the risk of serious adverse events was not
higher in patients receiving sertraline vs placebo, those
treated with sertraline did experience a significantly higher
incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects. These results
provide evidence regarding the lack of efficacy of sertraline
among patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD that
would change clinical practice.
Previous studies investigating the efficacy of antidepres-
sant medications among patients with CKD were performed
in dialysis-dependent samples and were limited by lack of ran-
domization and control, small sample sizes, short treatment
durations, low adherence, high dropout rates, and nonstan-
dard criteria for MDD diagnosis.27-34 Only 2 trials appropri-
ately diagnosed MDD by using a psychiatric interview, one of
which included only 14 patients treated over 8 weeks32 and the
other, 30 patients over 6 months.27 Neither showed an anti-
depressant treatment effect. In one of these trials,27 there was
a higher withdrawal rate in the sertraline group due to ad-
verseevents.However,allparticipantsinthepresentstudyun-

 received an adequate dose and duration of treatment to elicit
a clinically meaningful effect.
The retention rate in the current study was much higher
than in other antidepressant trials involving patients with
CKD,27-34comparablewithlargetrialsamongparticipantswith-
outCKD.12-14Therewasahighpercentage(92%)ofpatientswho
completed 6 weeks and 84% who completed 12 weeks (the en-
tire trial duration). In addition, the run-in period successfully
minimized nonadherence.
A high placebo response has been postulated to be asso-
ciated with negative trials of antidepressant medications.35
However, the 4-point decrease in the QIDS-C16 score in the pla-
cebo group is lower than what is considered a “high” placebo
response rate observed in depression treatment trials. A meta-
analysis of 169 randomized placebo-controlled trials of anti-
depressant monotherapy concluded that a placebo response
rate of less than 30% provided the best chance of finding ef-
ficacy in drug-placebo comparisons.36 Thus, a “high” pla-
cebo response rate is an unlikely explanation for a lack of ser-
traline efficacy in this study. If sertraline did have any effect,
it was significantly smaller than postulated in the sample size
calculations and clinically irrelevant. In addition, use of a mea-
surement-based care design to bring each participant to the
highest individually tolerable dose resulted in adequate dos-
ing (median, 150 mg/d) compared with lower achieved SSRI
doses in other large trials among patients with chronic dis-
easesthatdidnotshowSSRItreatmentefficacycomparedwith
placebo. The mean (SD) sertraline doses were 65 (29) mg/d and
68.8 (40.1) mg/d in trials of patients with congestive heart
failure36 and ischemic heart disease,12 respectively, and the
mean (SD) escitalopram dose was 15.8 (6.4) mg/d in a more re-
cent large congestive heart failure trial.14 Therefore, inad-
equate dosing would not explain the lack of effect, and it is un-
likelythatsertralineiseffectivefordepressiontreatmentinthis
patient population.
Another reason for lack of efficacy could be that depres-
sion comorbid with chronic disease is a different clinical en-
tity than psychiatric MDD among those without comorbidity
and depression that is not responsive to SSRI medications.
The current study included participants with medical multi-
morbidity in addition to non–dialysis-dependent CKD (58%
with diabetes, 27% with metabolic syndrome, and 32% with
congestive heart failure), which makes it challenging to dif-
ferentiate whether lack of response to sertraline was due to the
presence of CKD or other chronic illnesses. These findings are
in line with increasing evidence from well-powered trials
among patients with other chronic medical conditions, such
as asthma, ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart fail-
ure, that found SSRIs were no more efficacious than placebo
for treating depression.12,14,36,37 Another potential reason for
lack of efficacy is that 84% of participants were unemployed,
and socioeconomic factors such as unemployment were
shown to be associated with a low likelihood of antidepres-
sant treatment response.38
Inadditiontoinvestigatingtheefficacyofacommonlypre-
scribed SSRI among patients with CKD, this study assessed ad-
verse events and tolerability. Few data exist regarding SSRI
safety among patients with CKD because such patients have
been excluded from large antidepressant medication
trials.12,13,39 Patients with advanced CKD are at a higher risk
for antidepressant adverse events due to the potential accu-
mulation of toxic metabolite effects in the setting of reduced
glomerular filtration rate; increased risk of drug-drug inter-
actions;cardiacsequelae(ie,QTc-intervalprolongationandor-
thostatic hypotension); and increased bleeding from SSRI-
induced decreased platelet aggregability, which is particularly
problematic among patients with advanced CKD.
Sertraline was chosen because it is primarily metabolized
bytheliver.Itsactivemetabolite,N-desmethylsertraline,isfur-
ther metabolized to an inactive form before renal excretion.15
In addition, the Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Ran-
domized Trial found sertraline to be safe among patients with
cardiovascular disease.12 Although sertraline did not result in
increased serious adverse events or bleeding, it did increase
the rate of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. These types of
adverse events are particularly undesirable among patients
with advanced CKD because they are already prone to uremic
symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. Although the duration was
longer than previous studies, it did not assess the long-term ef-
fects of antidepressant treatment in CKD. The duration was de-
signedtominimizepotentialadverseeventswhileallowingad-
equatedrugexposureforameaningfulresponse.Thelargesttrial
of MDD treatment in the general population also assessed effi-
cacy over 12 weeks and showed that a substantial portion of pa-
tients who achieved response or remission did so after 8 weeks
of treatment with an SSRI.13 In addition, trials with longer du-
rations(6and18months)amongpatientswithotherchronicdis-
eases did not reveal efficacy of SSRI vs placebo.14,36 The poten-
tialbenefitofSSRIsforthetreatmentofmoreseveredepression
may also deserve exploration. Although patients with dialysis-
dependentCKDwerenotincluded,thereisasubstantiallylarger
population of patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD, and
the majority of patients with CKD die of cardiovascular disease
beforereachingend-stagekidneydisease.Identifyinginterven-
tions that could affect outcomes earlier during the disease du-
ration is imperative.
The efficacy and safety of interventions for the treatment
of depression among dialysis-dependent patients, a pop-
ulation in which the burden of symptoms, demands of
treatment, and propensity for adverse drug reactions are sub-
stantially higher than among patients with non–dialysis-
dependent CKD, deserve further investigation. Although the
current study involved a single geographic area, the demo-
graphic breakdown was racially and ethnically diverse, region-
ally representative, and consistent with published data from
other large nationally representative CKD cohorts.40 The cur-
rent study did include a larger proportion of black partici-
pants than previously reported in some CKD cohorts. How-
ever, given that the ratio of adjusted incidence rates for CKD
in 2014 for blacks vs whites was 3.1, inclusion of a large pro-
portion of blacks is clinically relevant.1 Twenty-two percent of
study participants had a history of drug abuse; however, it is
uncertain whether this factor is generalizable. The inclusion

 of non-Veteran patients from the University of Texas South-
western Medical Center and Parkland Hospital increases the
generalizability to females with CKD.1 Future studies need to
explore whether non-SSRI medications or nonpharmacologi-
cal therapies can result in improvement in depressive symp-
toms among patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD, who
are at a disproportionately higher risk for depression and its
complications than the general population.
Conclusions
Among patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD and MDD,
treatment with sertraline compared with placebo for 12 weeks
didnotsignificantlyimprovedepressivesymptoms.Thesefind-
ings do not support the use of sertraline to treat MDD in pa-
tients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD.
