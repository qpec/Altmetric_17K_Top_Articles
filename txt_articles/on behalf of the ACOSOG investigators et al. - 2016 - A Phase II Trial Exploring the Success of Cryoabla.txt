Abstract
Background—Cryoablation is a well-established technique to treat fibroadenomas. Pilot studies 
suggest this could be an effective non-surgical treatment for breast cancer. American College of 
Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1072 is a phase II trial exploring the effectiveness of 
cryoablation in the treatment of breast cancers.

 Methods—The primary endpoint of Z1072 was the rate of complete tumor ablation, defined as 
no remaining invasive breast cancer (IBC) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on pathologic 
examination of the targeted lesion. A secondary objective was to evaluate the negative predictive 
value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine residual IBC or DCIS. Eligible patients 
included those with unifocal invasive ductal breast cancer ≤2 cm, with <25 % intraductal 
component and tumor enhancement on MRI. A total of 19 centers contributed 99 patients, of 
which 86 patients (87 breast cancers) were evaluable for data analysis.
Results—Final pathology results, regardless of whether residual IBC/DCIS was in the targeted 
ablation zone or elsewhere in the breast, showed successful ablation in 66/87 (75.9 %) cancers. 
The 90 % confidence interval for the estimate of successful cryoablation was 67.1–83.2, with the 
one-sided lower-sided 90 % CI of 69.0. The negative predictive value of MRI was 81.2 % (90 % 
CI 71.4–88.8). When multifocal disease outside of the targeted cryoablation zone was not defined 
as an ablation failure, 80/87 (92 %) of the treated cancers had a successful cryoablation.
Conclusion—Further studies with modifications on the Z1072 protocol could be considered to 
evaluate the role for cryoablation as a non-surgical treatment of early-stage breast cancer.
INTRODUCTION
The trend in breast cancer treatment over the last several decades has been toward less 
invasive techniques. Breast-conserving surgery with radiation has been established as an 
oncologically sound alternative to mastectomy for the treatment of patients with unifocal, 
early-stage breast cancer. As systemic therapies have improved, the concept of decreasing 
the extent of local-regional therapies has been increasingly explored.
Building on significant experience in the treatment of benign breast tumors and metastatic 
hepatic tumors, the prospect of applying cryoablation therapy as a non-operative approach to 
breast cancer treatment has been considered worthy of investigation. Several investigators 
have shown the feasibility of cryoablation in the treatment of patients with small invasive 
breast cancers (IBCs), however most of these studies have been limited to single institutions 
enrolling small numbers of patients. As a result, many have questioned the applicability of 
cryoablation to the management of patients with breast cancer beyond the single institution 
setting where highly specialized centers have been established.
American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1072 was a phase II study 
evaluating the feasibility of cryoablation to treat early-stage breast cancer in a multicenter 
setting. The primary endpoint of Z1072 was the rate of complete tumor ablation, defined as 
no remaining IBC or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on pathological examination of the 
targeted lesion. A secondary objective was to evaluate the negative predictive value of 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine residual IBC or DCIS. The long-term goal 
would be to use cryoablation as an alternative to surgical resection in highly selected 
patients with early-stage breast cancers.

 METHODS
Study Design
ACOSOG Z1072 was a phase II, non-randomized study evaluating the success of 
cryoablation in the treatment of breast cancer. The primary objective was to determine the 
rate of complete tumor ablation, with complete ablation defined as no remaining IBC or 
DCIS on pathologic examination of the targeted lesion. A secondary objective was to 
evaluate the negative predictive value of MRI in the post-ablation setting to determine 
residual DCIS or IBC. All eligible and registered patients underwent mammography, 
ultrasound, and breast MRI. Patients were treated with cryoablation followed by repeat 
breast MRI. A 1.5- or 3-Tesla magnet was used for all MRI images. MRI was evaluated by 
the institutional radiologist and by central radiology review.
Patients underwent surgical resection of the primary tumor within 28 days of the 
cryoablation. All patients had sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection and adjuvant 
therapy as clinically indicated.
Patient Eligibility
Eligibility included unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma ≤2 cm, with <25 % intraductal 
component and tumor enhancement on MRI. Ninety-nine patients from 19 institutions were 
registered, and each signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent. 
Of the 99 patients, 86 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. One patient had bilateral 
disease and therefore outcomes are reported for 87 cancers. Thirteen patients were excluded 
for the following reasons: two had lobular histology, one had >25 % intraductal component, 
one had no tumor enhancement on MRI, and one had 1.0-Tesla MRI. Two patients did not 
have cryoablation, one did not undergo surgery, one was treated by a non-credentialed 
surgeon, one was treated prior to registration, one had a benign lesion, one withdrew consent 
prior to the start of the study, and one patient was not treated due to a probe failure.
Cryoablation Procedure
All cryoablations were performed using the commercially available Visica 2™ Treatment 
System. In accordance with US FDA market clearance, the Visica 2™ Treatment System was 
indicated for use in ablation of benign and malignant breast tumors. All patients were treated 
by a specific cryoablation algorithm, as outlined in the Z1072 protocol. MRI was performed 
14–28 days after the cryoablation, and surgery was performed within 28 days after 
cryoablation.
Investigator Eligibility
Investigators were required to verify experience in cryoablation prior to enrolling patients, 
including documentation of a minimum of 20 interventional sonographically-guided 
procedures and a minimum of five sonographically-guided breast cryoablations.
Statistical Analysis
The primary objective of this study was to determine whether there was evidence that the 
complete ablation rate was above 90 % (indicating cryoablation is a potentially efficacious

 treatment) or if there was evidence that it was <70 % (indicating current technology yields 
unsatisfactory results). The complete ablation rate was computed as the number of breasts 
with no residual disease after ablation divided by the number of eligible breasts. A one-sided 
90 % binomial confidence interval (CI) was used to determine if there is evidence that the 
rate is ≥90 % or ≤70 %. A sample size of 90 breasts would have probability of 0.94 to yield 
evidence that the complete ablation rate is ≥70 % when the true rate is 90 %. In addition, a 
sample size of 90 breasts has 0.83 probability of yielding evidence that the complete 
ablation rate is <70 % when the true rate is 60 %. In addition to using the one-sided CI to 
determine the degree of evidence, the estimate of the complete ablation rate was provided by 
a binomial estimator and 90 % (two-sided) CI. The negative predictive value of MRI was 
estimated as the number of breasts with no residual disease after cryoablation and an MRI 
that indicated no residual disease, divided by the number of breasts with an MRI that 
indicated no residual disease. This was estimated with a binomial point estimate and 
corresponding 90 % binomial CI.
Categorical data are summarized as counts and relative frequencies, and comparisons among 
groups of interest were performed using the Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were 
summarized as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and median (minimum value, maximum 
value). Comparisons between groups were made using a two-sample t-test. Analyses were 
carried out using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Data collection and 
statistical analyses were conducted by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center. Data quality 
was ensured through review by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center and the study 
chairperson following Alliance policies. Database lock date was 18 February 2014.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
Eighty-six patients were included in the primary analysis dataset (Table 1). The first and last 
patients were registered on 16 March 2009 and 6 June 2013, respectively. Median age at 
registration was 62 years of age (range 42–81; mean ± SD 61.1 ± 9.3). One patient (1.2 %) 
had bilateral breast cancer. For all tumor measurements and outcomes, the patient with 
bilateral breast cancer was included; thus N = 87 breasts.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Results
All tumors showed pre-ablation enhancement on MRI, with enhancement characterized as a 
mass in 84 (96.6 %) breasts and non-mass-like enhancement in 3 (3.4 %) breasts. The mean 
± SD tumor size on MRI was 1.2 ± 0.3 cm, and the median size was 1.2 cm (range 0.5–1.9 
cm). Post-ablation residual enhancement was found in 23 (26.4 %) breasts (Fig. 1).
Surgical Procedures
All patients underwent surgical resection following cryoablation. Surgery was partial 
mastectomy in 85 (97.7 %) tumors, and mastectomy in 2 (2.3 %) tumors. Sentinel node 
biopsy was performed for 84 (96.6 %) tumors, and axillary dissection was performed for 10 
(11.5 %) tumors (two at initial surgery and eight following positive sentinel node biopsy). 
One patient (1.1 %) did not have axillary assessment at the clinical discretion of the treating

 surgeon. All patients received adjuvant therapy as clinically indicated by the treating 
clinicians.
Pathology Results
At surgical resection, all tissue was evaluated by the institutional pathologist and by central 
pathology review. On central pathology review, six patients were found to have benign 
disease that was originally interpreted as residual post-ablation IBC or DCIS by the 
institutional pathologist. The central review data were used in the final data analysis.
Primary Endpoint Analysis
Overall pathology results were analyzed without consideration of the location of the residual 
IBC or DCIS. Of the 87 cancers treated with cryoablation and eligible for evaluation, central 
pathologic review revealed successful cryoablation in 66 (75.9 %) cancers and residual IBC 
and/or DCIS in 21 (24.1 %) cancers. The 90 % CI for the estimate of successful cryoablation 
was 67.1–83.2 %, with the one-sided lower-sided 90 % CI of 69.0. Residual IBC (with or 
without residual DCIS) was found in 14 of 87 (16.1 %) breasts with a mean size (±SD) of 
0.6 ± 0.6 cm and median size of 0.4 cm (range 0.05–1.9 cm). Residual DCIS alone was 
found in 15 of 87 (17.2 %) breasts with a mean size (±SD) of 0.6 ± 0.7 cm and median size 
of 0.3 cm (range 0.1–2.8 cm). Successful cryoablation, as determined by the institution 
pathology review, was observed in 60 breasts, corresponding to a success rate of 69.0 % 
(90 % CI 59.8–77.1)
Concordance of Post-Ablation MRI and Pathology
The negative predictive value of MRI was 81.2 % (90 % CI 71.4–88.8). A trend between 
MRI enhancement of residual tumor and the successful ablation was observed. There was 
100 % ablation success in tumors that were radiographically <1.0 cm before cryotherapy 
without residual enhancement after cryotherapy, compared with 77.4 % success in those 
patients with tumors ≥1.0 cm and no residual enhancement (Table 2).
Pathology Results Relative to Cryoablation Zone
On central pathology review, the residual IBC and DCIS were categorized into four 
categories depending on the location of residual disease. Four categories were defined as 
ineffective (viable cancer in the cryoablation zone), incomplete (viable cancer at the edge of 
the cryoablation zone), misplaced (viable cancer away from the cryoablation zone and no 
evidence of necrotic cancer in the cryoablation zone), and multifocal (viable cancer in one or 
more foci >2.0 cm from the index tumor with necrotic cancer within the cryoablation zone). 
Four tumors were categorized as incomplete, two were categorized as misplaced, and 15 
were categorized as multifocal (Fig. 2). Multifocal disease away from the targeted lesion 
was considered similar to residual disease surrounding the surgical site following breast-
conservation therapy for the primary endpoint analysis. If this multifocal category is not 
defined as ablation failure, then 80 (92.0 %) of 87 cancers were successfully ablated, and 
100 % of tumors <1 cm were successfully ablated (Table 3).

 DISCUSSION
ACOSOG Z1072 was designed to evaluate the feasibility of cryoablation in the treatment of 
early-stage breast cancer in a multicenter setting. The primary endpoint was complete tumor 
ablation defined as no remaining cancer on pathologic examination of the targeted lesion. 
An overall successful ablation was observed in 66 of 87 (75.9 %; 90 % CI 67.1–83.2) 
cancers. When evaluating the targeted lesion, ablation was successful in 80 (92 %) of 87 
cancers (multifocal disease outside of the targeted cryoablation zone was not defined as an 
ablation failure). The negative predictive value of MRI to determine residual IBC or DCIS 
was 81.2 % (90 % CI 71.4–88.8). These data suggest that modifications on the Z1072 
protocol could be considered to evaluate the role for cryoablation as a non-surgical treatment 
of early-stage breast cancer, and that improved imaging is needed to detect multifocal 
disease outside of the targeted lesion. The clinical model for ablative therapy in breast 
diseases exists in the office-based practice of cryoablation for fibroadenomas. Cryoablation 
of fibroadenomas produces less pain and requires less anesthesia than surgical excision, and 
does not require removal of normal surrounding breast tissue. There is restoration of normal 
or near-normal breast architecture on examination and imaging. Some studies have shown 
complete clinical disappearance (physical examination, ultrasound and mammogram) of 
fibroadenomas within 1 year in 95 % of patients. 1,2
The use of ablation technologies, including radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, interstitial 
laser therapy, microwave thermotherapy, and focused ultrasound (FUS) ablation, are 
presently being explored to treat breast cancers as an alternative to surgical resection.3–18 To 
replace surgical resection of breast tumors with cryoablation, complete tumor ablation must 
be performed with a high rate of success. To date, results of cryoablation for breast cancer 
have been highly successful, with complete cell death seen within the targeted ablation zone 
in the majority of cases. A pilot study of cryoablation in 27 patients with primary breast 
cancer documented complete ablation in those with infiltrating ductal carcinoma measuring 
<1 cm and in those with infiltrating ductal carcinoma ≤1.5 cm without an extensive 
intraductal component.19 In one study, MRI has been shown to predict residual disease in a 
pilot study of radiofrequency ablation for breast cancer followed by surgical resection.20 
Previous studies have shown that residual foci of tumor commonly exist outside of the 
primary tumor site in patients treated with breast conservation. Some of these studies 
specifically looked at the incidence of foci of residual cancer on re-excision after initial 
pathology of IBC with negative margins and found the incidence of residual foci to be as 
high as 33 %.21–22 Thus, it is not surprising we found foci of tumor in other areas of the 
breast outside of the targeted ablation zone in the Z1072 study. This was designated as a 
pathologic category of multifocal disease (viable cancer in one focus or multiple foci beyond 
the cryoablated zone with necrotic cancer in the cryoablation zone). These cases in Z1072 
were re-evaluated and considered successful ablations for subsequent analysis. The success 
of cryoablation using this definition was 92 % in 80 of 87 cases. As with standard breast-
conserving therapy, it is likely that radiation therapy would treat the subclinical foci outside 
of the targeted ablation zone without the need for additional surgical resection.
No cases were categorized as ineffective ablation (viable cancer within the cryoablation 
zone), which supports the effectiveness of the cryoablation technique. Any cases in this

 category would imply a technical failure of the cryoablation process in forming a killing 
zone. There were four cases in the pathologic category of incomplete ablation (viable cancer 
at the edge of the cryoablation zone with necrotic cancer in the cryoablation zone), implying 
that the probe placement was effective to destroy some, but not all, of the targeted tumor. 
This may be an underestimate of tumor size by imaging or could imply an aberrant 
placement of the probe by the investigator. There were two cases in the pathologic category 
of misplaced ablation (viable cancer away from the cryoablation zone with no evidence of 
necrotic cancer in the cryoablation zone), implying aberrant placement of the probe by the 
investigator. The cases in the incomplete and misplaced categories are under further 
investigation to identify factors that could be improved in future trials.
CONCLUSIONS
In Z1072, cryoablation was effective in 92 % of targeted lesions and there was 100 % 
ablation in all tumors <1.0 cm. This supports the potential use of office-based, ultrasound-
guided cryoablation in highly selected patients with IBC. The presence of multifocal disease 
may limit the efficacy of cryoablation as a stand-alone procedure and therefore it should be 
combined with adjuvant radiation. Further studies with modifications in technique and 
patient selection should be conducted to improve cryoablation success as a non-surgical 
alternative for breast cancer treatment.
