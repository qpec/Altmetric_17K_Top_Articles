Falls Prevention Awareness Day — 
September 22, 2016
September 22, 2016, marks the 9th annual observation 
of Falls Prevention Awareness Day in the United States. 
Falls are the leading cause of injury, death, and disability for 
older persons in the United States.* This issue of MMWR 
includes a report describing the epidemiology of falls among 
older adults, and how health care providers can use CDC’s 
STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries) 
initiative† to reduce preventable falls. STEADI provides 
tools for health care providers to screen older adult patients, 
assess fall risk, and provide effective interventions. 
In 2011, health department and health system partner-
ships in Oregon and New York used CDC funding to 
implement STEADI into their primary care practices (1). 
Before implementing STEADI, health care providers in 
these sites rarely talked to their older adult patients about 
falls (1,2). After implementation, participating health care 
providers in New York screened and assessed 65% of older 
adult patients for fall risk (2), and participating health care 
providers in Oregon screened and assessed approximately 
half of all older adult patients (1).
T
o help prevent older adult falls, health care providers are 
encouraged to take three steps: 1) screen patients for fall risk, 
2) review and manage patients’ medications that might increase 
fall risk, and 3) recommend daily vitamin D supplements for 
improved bone, muscle, and nerve health. Additional informa-
tion is available at http://www.cdc.gov/steadi.

Falls and Fall Injuries Among Adults 
Aged ≥65 Years — United States, 2014
Gwen Bergen, PhD1; Mark R. Stevens, MA, MSPH2; 
Elizabeth R. Burns, MPH1
Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries 
among adults aged ≥65 years (older adults). During 2014, 
approximately 27,000 older adults died because of falls; 
2.8 million were treated in emergency departments for fall-
related injuries, and approximately 800,000 of these patients 
were subsequently hospitalized.* To estimate the numbers, 
percentages, and rates of falls and fall injuries among older 
adults by selected characteristics and state, CDC analyzed data 
from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 
(BRFSS) survey. In 2014, 28.7% of older adults reported 
falling; the estimated 29.0 million falls resulted in 7.0 million 
injuries. Known effective strategies for reducing the number

of older adult falls include a multifactorial clinical approach 
(e.g., gait and balance assessment, strength and balance exer-
cises, and medication review). Health care providers can play 
an important role in fall prevention by screening older adults 
for fall risk, reviewing and managing medications linked to 
falls, and recommending vitamin D supplements to improve 
bone, muscle, and nerve health and reduce the risk for falls.
BRFSS is an annual, random-digit–dialed telephone sur-
vey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population aged 
≥18 years conducted annually in all 50 states, the District of 
Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Detailed information regarding the survey is available online.† 
The median response rate for 2014 was 47.0%.
In 2014, survey respondents were asked, “In the past 
12 months, how many times have you fallen?” If the response 
was one or more times, they were asked, “How many of these 
falls caused an injury? By an injury, we mean the fall caused 
you to limit your regular activities for at least a day or to go see 
a doctor.” This analysis was limited to adults aged ≥65 years 
in all 50 states and the District of Columbia who were asked 
the questions about falls.
The first question was used to estimate the percentage of 
older adults who reported one or more falls and the total 
number of falls; the second question was used to estimate the 
number of fall injuries. Response options ranged from zero 
to 76 or more with reported means of 0.67 falls and 0.16 fall 
injuries. The percentages and numbers of falls and fall injuries 
included all adults aged ≥65 years in the denominator. Adults 
with responses of “Don’t know/Not sure,” “Refused,” or “Not 
asked or missing” for questions about falls, fall injuries, or 
demographic characteristics were excluded, reducing the 
sample to 147,319 adults.§
The percentages and numbers were compared across the fol-
lowing subgroups: sex, age group, race/ethnicity, marital status, 
education, annual household income, health status, and state 
of residence. Orthogonal polynomial contrasts and pairwise 
t-tests were used to identify significant increases or decreases 
where appropriate. The 2014 BRFSS data were weighted by 
iterative proportional fitting (raking) to represent state-level 
population estimates and aggregated to represent a nationwide 
estimate.¶ All results presented are weighted. Analyses were 
conducted using statistical software to account for the complex 
sampling design.
In 2014, 28.7% of older adults reported falling at least 
once in the preceding 12 months, resulting in an estimated 
29.0 million falls (Table 1). Of those who fell, 37.5% reported 
at least one fall that required medical treatment or restricted 
activity for at least 1 day, resulting in 7.0 million fall injuries. 
Women (30.3%) were more likely to report falling than men 
(26.5%) (p<0.01) and were more likely to report a fall injury 
(12.6% compared with 8.3%; p<0.01). The percentage of

were more likely to report a fall-related injury (16.8%) than 
were whites (10.9%), Hispanics (10.7%), and blacks (7.8%). 
The rate of fall-related injuries was significantly higher in the 
population reporting poor health (480 per 1,000) than the 
population reporting excellent health (69 per 1,000).
Among states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of 
older adults who reported a fall ranged from 20.8% in Hawaii 
to 34.3% in Arkansas. Several states had either significantly 
higher or lower percentages of reported falls among older adults 
compared with the national average (Figure) (Table 2). The 
percentage of older adults experiencing fall injuries ranged 
from 7.0% in Hawaii to 12.9% in Missouri.
Discussion
In 2014, 28.7% of older adults in the United States reported 
an estimated 29.0 million falls in the preceding 12 months. 
Older adult falls can result in death, serious injury, and loss 
of independence (1,2). This analysis found that an estimated 
7 million falls required medical treatment or caused restricted 
activity for at least 1 day. Women and those in older age groups 
were at higher risk for falling and being injured in a fall. Reduced 
muscle strength is a risk factor for falls, and aging and female 
sex are associated with reduced muscle mass (1,2). Women have 
been found to be more likely to report falls than men (3). Aging 
also is associated with changes in gait and balance, increased 
inactivity, more severe chronic conditions, and more prescrip-
tion medication use, all of which are risk factors for falls (1). 
Limited research exists on the causes for racial/ethnic differences, 
but these differences might be related to differences in health 
and behavior (4,5). Reasons for state differences are unknown; 
however, even in Hawaii, the state with the lowest incidence, 
20.8% of older adults reported a fall.
Annual Medicare costs for older adult falls have been estimated 
at $31.3 billion (6), and the older adult population is expected 
to increase 55% by 2030.** Applying the number of falls from 
this analysis to the projected 2030 population would result in an 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among 
persons aged ≥65 years (older adults).
What is added by this report?
In 2014, 28.7% of older adults reported falling at least once in 
the preceding 12 months, resulting in an estimated 29.0 million 
falls. Of those who fell, 37.5% reported at least one fall that 
required medical treatment or restricted their activity for at 
least 1 day, resulting in an estimated 7.0 million fall injuries.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Although falls are common, approximately half of older 
adults who fall do not discuss it with their health care 
provider. However, older adult falls are largely preventable. 
Health care providers can play an important role in fall 
prevention by 1) screening older adults for fall risk, 
2) reviewing and managing medications linked to falls, and 
3) recommending vitamin D where appropriate for improved 
bone, muscle, and nerve health.

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
estimated 48.8 million falls and 11.9 million fall injuries, unless 
effective interventions are implemented nationwide.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, BRFSS data are self-reported and subject to recall 
bias. Second, BRFSS does not include persons in long-term 
care facilities who are at higher risk for falls (7). Third, the 
broad definition of fall injury for this analysis might have 
resulted in a higher estimate of injurious falls compared with 
other reports. Finally, the response rate (median = 47%) could 
have resulted in nonresponse bias; however, weighting and 
survey methodology are used to adjust the estimates and reduce 
the effect of nonresponse bias.
Older adult falls are largely preventable, and health care pro-
viders (e.g., physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician 
assistants, pharmacists, physical therapists, and occupational 
therapists) can play an important part by discussing falls with 
older adult patients and providing appropriate interventions 
(8). The American and British Geriatrics Societies (AGS/
BGS) Clinical Practice Guideline recommends that health 
care providers use a multifactorial approach to prevent falls 
that includes activities such as asking about falls, assessing 
gait and balance, reviewing medications, and prescribing 
interventions such as strength and balance exercises, or tak-
ing vitamin D.†† This type of approach has been estimated to 
be capable of reducing falls by 24% (8). Based on the AGS/
BGS guidelines, CDC has developed the STEADI (Stopping 
Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries) initiative§§ to provide 
resources to help health care providers incorporate fall preven-
tion into primary care (3). STEADI stresses three initial steps 
that can be completed in one patient visit: 1) ask patients if 
they have fallen in the past year, feel unsteady, or worry about 
falling; 2) review medications and stop, switch, or reduce the 
dosage of drugs that increase fall risk; and 3) recommend 
daily vitamin D supplementation for improved bone, muscle, 
and nerve health (with dosage of vitamin D and decision on 
whether to co-supplement with calcium to be determined 
based on the patient’s history).
Health care providers should discuss fall prevention with 
their patients because approximately half of older adults who 
fall do not discuss it with their health care provider, often 
because they fear this will lead to a loss of independence (9). 
Health care providers cite limited time and cost as barriers to 
incorporating preventive services, such as those proposed by 
STEADI, into their clinical practice (10). However, the Centers 
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) now provides 
incentives for health care providers to conduct fall prevention 
activities through payment and delivery reforms (e.g., Welcome 
to Medicare Visit, Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, and the 
Medicare Shared Savings Accountable Care Organization 
Program).¶¶ CMS also links health care provider incentives to 
fall prevention quality measures through the Physician Quality 
Reporting System (PQRS) in the Merit-Based Incentive 
Program. PQRS includes two quality measures for falls: Falls 
Risk Assessment and Falls Plan of Care.*** Mechanisms such as 
payment and delivery reforms and quality reporting measures 
are opportunities to make fall prevention a routine part of 
clinical practice and reduce the barriers to providing services 
that can prevent falls among older adults.
