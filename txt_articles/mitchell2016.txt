linical practice guidelines (CPGs) are highly influen-
tial within medicine, defining the standard of care for
many ailments. Ideally, they should be based on a com-
prehensive evaluation of available data and unbiased expert
opinion.1 However, financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs) be-
tween guideline authors and industry create the potential for
undue influence of for-profit companies in medical practice.2
Published evidence on the effects of FCOIs on guideline
recommendations is limited,3 but suggests that authors with
industry FCOIs are more likely to recommend specific drugs4
and assess clinical trial results more favorably.5 In addition,
FCOIs influence physician prescribing practices, as physi-
cians with FCOIs are more likely to prescribe brand-name
drugs.6 The Open Payments Provision (“Sunshine Act”) of the
Affordable Care Act recently made public all FCOIs between
industry and US physicians, facilitating systematic study of
FCOIs and ending reliance on self-reporting.
Withinoncology,theNationalComprehensiveCancerCen-
ter (NCCN) guidelines influence clinician practice and define
which drugs are reimbursable through Medicare.7 The goal of
this study is to quantify the presence and extent of FCOIs
among authors of recent NCCN guidelines for the treatment
of breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancer.
Methods
Since August, 2013 the Sunshine Act has required that all US
drug and device manufacturers disclose transfers of financial
value greater than $10 to physicians and teaching hospitals.
IMPORTANCE Financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs) among authors of clinical practice
guidelines have the potential to influence treatment recommendations.
OBJECTIVE To quantify FCOIs with industry among authors of the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We assessed FCOIs occurring during 2014 among NCCN
guideline authors in the United States. All were physician members of the NCCN guideline
committees for lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer as of the end of 2014. The data
source for FCOIs was Open Payments, which is publically reported by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services. This study was cross-sectional.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The proportion of NCCN authors having FCOIs with
industry; the average amount received from industry sources per author.
RESULTS Of 125 guideline authors, 108 (86%) had at least 1 reported FCOI. Authors received
an average of $10 011 (range, $0-$106 859) in general payments (GPs), which include
consulting, meals, lodging, and similar transfers of value, and $236 066 (range
$0-$2 756 713) in industry research payments (RPs), including funding associated with clinical
trials. Approximately 84% of authors received GPs, while 47% received RPs. Eight (6%) had
FCOIs in excess of the $50 000 net and/or $20 000 single-company maximums stipulated
by NCCN.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among NCCN guideline authors, FCOIs involving RPs were of
greater value, while those involving GPs were more prevalent. Although FCOIs may result
from engaging in important scholarship, FCOIs may still influence guideline authors in
counterproductive ways. Research is needed to understand how best to manage author
FCOIs during guideline creation.

Payments are reported either as “general payments,
” includ-
ing gifts, consultancy and/or speaker fees, meals, and invest-
ment interests,8 or as “research payments,” including “any
direct compensation, funding for coordination or implemen-
tation, or study participant expense”9 related to preclinical
research, US Food and Drug Administration phase 1 to 4 trials,
and investigator-initiated studies.10
We identified the authors who were active on the NCCN
guideline panels for lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancer
as of the end of 2014. These were selected as the malignant
neoplasms with the highest incidence in the United States.
Using the public Open Payments database (https://www.cms
.gov/openpayments/), FCOIs for each author were manually
abstracted. We included all payments occurring in 2014,
excludeddisputedpayments,andcalculatedpaymentaverages
and ranges for general payments and research payments both
together and separately. Authors active on multiple guidelines
were counted only once. In sensitivity analysis we excluded
FCOIs that fell below different dollar value thresholds (eg,
<$100),asphysiciansreceivingsuchpaymentsmaybeunaware
of and/or less influenced by such payments. The study was
reviewed by the University of North Carolina Office of Human
Research Ethics and was found not to constitute human
subjects research.
Results
We identified 125 authors across the 4 guidelines, of whom 108
(86%) had at least 1 reported FCOI, with no significant differ-
ences in frequency or monetary value of FCOIs among the 4
cancer types (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The total value of
FCOIs reported in 2014 among these authors was $30 287 549,
representing $29 036 127 in RPs and $1 251 422 in general pay-
ments (Table).
Authors received a mean of $10 011 in general payments
(range, $0-$106 859) (Table). Most authors (70 [56%]) re-
ceived $1000 or more in general payments (Figure 1). These
results were not sensitive to the inclusion of low-value FCOIs
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Research payments were of much higher monetary value
than general payments, but were less common among NCCN
guideline authors. Authors received a mean of $236 066 in re-
search payments (range, $0-$2 756 713) (Table). Of the 125 au-
thors, 84% received 1 or more general payments from indus-
try while only 47% received any research payments. While a
substantialportionofauthorsreceivedgeneralpaymentsalone
without also receiving research payments, the reverse was not
true; only 3 authors (2%) received research payments with-
out also receiving at least some general payments (Figure 2).
There were 8 authors (6%) whose FCOIs exceeded the
$50 000 net and/or $20 000 single-company maximum stipu-
lated by the NCCN guideline policy.
Discussion
Through recent federal initiatives to increase transparency of
FCOIs between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry,
there has been growing awareness of and debate over the role
and influence of FCOIs in medicine. Some have resisted blan-
ket condemnation of all apparent conflicts, many of which rep-
resent important scholarly activity.11Others remain con-
cerned, given prior work suggesting that industry FCOIs can
influencephysicianprescribingbehavior,6recommendations,4
and interpretation of clinical data.5
Our study demonstrates the high prevalence and signifi-
cant monetary value of FCOIs among oncology guideline
authors. Several findings are noteworthy. First, most of the
dollar value of industry FCOIs was contained in research pay-
ments. While these payments support research and are often
paid to the physician’
s institution, physicians accrue other, in-
direct benefits by procuring outside research funding. There-
fore, research payments as well as general payments have the
potential to create conflicts of interest. More investigation is
needed on the relative influence of general payments and re-
search funding on physician practice and guideline recom-
mendations.
Second, we must consider the reasons that FCOIs emerge
and their potential benefits. With the bulk of research fund-
ing coming from industry, accepting research funding is all but
Key Points
Question What is the prevalence of financial conflicts of interest
with industry among National Comprehensive Cancer Network
guideline authors?
Findings In this cross-sectional analysis of Open Payments data,
86% had financial conflicts of interest, including 84% who
accepted general payments and 47% who accepted research
payments.
Meaning The potential for undue influence of industry in
oncology clinical practice guidelines should be addressed.

mandatory for an academic clinical trialist. In addition, there
maybesocietalvalueinhavingphysicianswhobridgethespace
between academia and industry, advising on areas of medi-
cal need, and then furthering such ideas into clinical research
through involvement in research studies.
However, our data suggest that not all academic oncolo-
gists accrue FCOIs with industry as a result of research en-
deavors. A significant portion (39% of authors studied) ac-
cepted general payments in the absence of any research
payments to indicate active research participation.
Guideline-writing bodies are aware of FCOIs, and some
have taken action to moderate the influence of potentially con-
flicted authors. For example, the American Society of Clini-
cal Oncology restricts authors with FCOIs to less than 50% of
each guideline committee.12 Indeed, the NCCN guidelines
panels recuse members with “meaningful conflicts of inter-
est” from discussion on specific topics and require members
not to exceed annually $20 000 in FCOIs with an individual
corporation or $50 000 in total FCOIs. Our findings suggest
that most, but not all, NCCN authors comply with these
requirements.
Our study was limited in that Open Payments collects data
onlyonphysicians,andsoFCOIsofnonphysicianNCCNguide-
line authors were not available; having such data would in-
crease the average and total payments to authors we re-
ported. While Open Payments data undergo a thorough
validation process, including an opportunity for physicians to
dispute reported payments before public release,13 there re-
main ways in which they may be imprecise or inaccurate. The
dispute process is difficult to navigate, potentially prevent-
ingphysiciansfromcorrectingreportingerrors.14BecauseOpen
Payments is limited to US physicians, these findings would not
be generalizable outside of the United States. In addition, phy-
sicians may have payments reported for participating in the
National Institutes of Health or cooperative group trials using
donated drugs,8 receiving grants from charitable organiza-
tions such as the Conquer Cancer Foundation, or coauthoring
manuscripts,15 without having had direct interaction with any
corporation.
Conclusions
How best to manage the FCOIs in oncology practice and clini-
cal practice guidelines remains an area of open discussion and
research. Practically, the high prevalence of FCOIs among phy-
sician field experts makes identifying individuals without
FCOIs difficult, with the potential unwanted outcome of ex-
cluding valuable expertise. More research is needed to deter-
mine which kinds of relationships are more likely to produce
the unwanted consequence of physician bias to create ratio-
nal, evidence-based policies that allow for the participation of
key clinical experts while managing real or perceived con-
flicts. Given the prevalence of FCOIs reported here, finding the
answer to this question is critical.
