Abstract
Regularly performed endurance training has many beneficial effects on health and skeletal
muscle function, and can be used to prevent and treat common diseases e.g. cardiovascu-
lar disease, type II diabetes and obesity. The molecular adaptation mechanisms regulating
these effects are incompletely understood. To date, global transcriptome changes in skele-
tal muscles have been studied at the gene level only. Therefore, global isoform expression
changes following exercise training in humans are unknown. Also, the effects of repeated
interventions on transcriptional memory or training response have not been studied before.
In this study, 23 individuals trained one leg for three months. Nine months later, 12 of the
same subjects trained both legs in a second training period. Skeletal muscle biopsies were
obtained from both legs before and after both training periods. RNA sequencing analysis of
all 119 skeletal muscle biopsies showed that training altered the expression of 3,404 gene
isoforms, mainly associated with oxidative ATP production. Fifty-four genes had isoforms
that changed in opposite directions. Training altered expression of 34 novel transcripts,
all with protein-coding potential. After nine months of detraining, no training-induced tran-
scriptome differences were detected between the previously trained and untrained legs.
Although there were several differences in the physiological and transcriptional responses
to repeated training, no coherent evidence of an endurance training induced transcriptional
skeletal muscle memory was found. This human lifestyle intervention induced differential
expression of thousands of isoforms and several transcripts from unannotated regions of
the genome. It is likely that the observed isoform expression changes reflect adaptational
mechanisms and processes that provide the functional and health benefits of regular physi-
cal activity.

 Author Summary
Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue of the healthy human body. It is also highly
adaptable to different environmental stimuli, e.g. regular exercise. Exercise training
improves overall health and muscle function, and can be used to prevent and treat several
common diseases e.g. cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes. Therefore, it is of great
importance to understand the molecular mechanisms behind adaptation processes in
human skeletal muscle. In this study, we show that different expression variants from the
same gene can be regulated in different directions with training, implicating alternative
protein functions from one single gene. Such findings are emblematic of the complex
mechanisms regulating the effects of training. We also find that training changes the activ-
ity of functionally unknown parts of the genome, with the potential for new proteins
involved in the health-enhancing effects of exercise. Additionally, our results challenge the
belief of a skeletal muscle memory, where previous training can affect the response to a
subsequent training period. Overall, we provide understanding of the skeletal muscle biol-
ogy and novel insights into the mechanisms behind the massive benefits of regular exercise
on the human skeletal muscle transcriptome, inspiring further studies for deeper
investigation.
Introduction
Long-term endurance training improves health and muscle function, as well as reduces mortal-
ity and risk for many diseases e.g. type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease [1]. How
training induces these beneficialeffects is not fully understood, but gene expression changes in
skeletal muscle induced by training [2–4] are important aspects of the adaptation process and
the ensuing health benefits. In addition to quantifying gene expression levels, RNA sequencing
can determine global isoform expression levels and identify novel transcripts. These aspects
have, to our knowledge, not been investigated in relation to human exercise training.
Alternative splicing greatly extends the complexity of the human transcriptome and, as a
consequence, the proteome [5]. Almost 95% of all human genes have been shown to express
different isoforms, and specific alternative splicing events are likely involved in for example
determination of tissue specificity [6]. Specific splice variant expression has also been shown to
be involved in adaptation to exercise training. For example, several isoforms of the transcrip-
tional regulator PGC1α (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α),
involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, are induced by exercise [7, 8]. Additionally, different
splice variants of VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), important for increased vas-
cularization, have been shown to increase to variable degrees in skeletal muscle in response to
both resistance [9] and endurance exercise [10]. Furthermore, IGF1 (Insulin Growth Factor 1)
isoforms are differentially regulated by resistance exercise [11]. Although there is evidence for
splicing event changes with exercise, there is no data available on the global isoform expression
response to training.
Human skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue that readily adapts to different environmen-
tal stimuli. Regular resistance and endurance exercise training induces many physiological,
structural, biochemical and transcriptional changes [12, 13]. If a standardized exercise training
program is repeated, the changes are expected to be consistent within an individual, and
largely, if not completely, lost upon training cessation [14]. Currently, there are no studies that
have determined the consistency of global transcriptomic changes following repeated periods
of training [15]. Previously, a study in mice has shown that resistance training could increase

 the number of myonuclei in skeletal muscle, an effect that was maintained after detraining
[16]. In humans, use of androgenic anabolic steroids increases the number of myonuclei per
myofiber that may persist long after periods of administration [17]. Such studies indicate that
possible intrinsic ‘muscle memory’ mechanisms may be present after adaptations to physiolog-
ical or pharmacological interventions. However, whether there is any skeletal muscle memory
at the level of gene expression after endurance training has not been studied in humans. Addi-
tionally, there is a lack of studies investigating effects of repeated training in the same
individual.
Accordingly, we aimed to study the impact of endurance training on the transcriptome, the
consistency of the transcriptional response to repeated exercise training and the potential pres-
ence of skeletal muscle memory from previous endurance training. For this purpose, we
adopted a one-legged training regime, where human volunteers trained only one leg during a
first training period, with the other leg serving as an intraindividual control. One year after the
start of the first period, a subset of the subjects started a second training period, this time train-
ing both legs. Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected before and after each training period to
study the impact of repeated training, detraining and potential memory effects in the transcrip-
tome, specificallyregarding differential isoform expression and novel transcripts.
Results
Physiological, biochemical and transcriptionaldynamics following
repeated periods of endurance training
The influence of endurance training on physiological, biochemical and transcriptional proper-
ties of human skeletal muscle was studied in 23 volunteers [18]. All individuals underwent a
3-month endurance training period in which they exercised only one leg, with the other leg
servingas an untrained control (Period 1) (Fig 1A). After a 9-month training break, twelve of
the subjects underwent a second 3-month training period in which they exercised both legs,
one at a time (Period 2). Before and after each training period, one-legged performance was
evaluated and skeletal muscle biopsies were collected from both legs (Fig 1A, S1 Table). The
samples were analyzed for enzyme activity of citrate synthase (CS) (a quantitative enzyme
marker for the presence of intact mitochondria) and of β-HAD (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydro-
genase, involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids), both known to be consistently
induced by endurance (aerobic) training [12]. From Period 1, we have previously published
physiological and biochemical results, as well as transcriptome data at the gene level in the
trained leg [18, 19]. Thus, transcriptome data for global splicing events, longitudinal data from
the untrained leg in Period 1 and all data from Period 2 have not been published previously.
The one-legged knee extension endurance training resulted in marked physiological
improvements (Fig 1B (mean±SD), S1 Fig (individual data)). These results were corroborated
by the two biochemical parameters CS and β-HAD (Figs 1C and 1D, S2 and S3). To study tran-
scriptome changes in response to training, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on all
skeletal muscle biopsies (S1 Table). Paired-end sequencing reads were aligned to the human
genome and normalized gene expression levels were calculated as batch corrected FPKM (Frag-
ments Per Kilobase of Exon per Million mapped fragments). Multivariate statistics, i.e. Princi-
pal Component Analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures by means of
partial least squares (OPLS), were applied with a stringent significance level of 0.01 to analyze
the global changes induced by the intervention. In Period 1, a clear response of the transcrip-
tome was observedboth at the gene (Fig 2A) and splicing event (S4 Fig, S2 and S3 Tables) levels
for the trained leg. In PCA, the before-training (T1) and after-training (T2) samples formed
two distinctive clusters in a PC score plot, and the OPLS model had high values for both the

 predictive and orthogonal components (Fig 2A, Tables 1 and 2). Moreover, to investigate if the
training effect was specific only for the trained leg, we compared the before-training (T1) sam-
ples to the untrained leg after the first training period (U2). At the gene level, PCA was not
able to distinguish two separate clusters and the predictive power of the OPLS model was small
(Q2 = 0.20) (Fig 2B, Tables 1 and 2). Since these analyses, which were confirmed at the splice
variant level as well (S4 Fig, S2 and S3 Tables), showed little differences, we concluded that the
training effect was specific for the trained leg, as expected.
Fig 1. Experimental design and training response.a) The study was divided into two training periods (1 and 2) with a 9-month break in between. In
Period 1, 23 individuals trained one randomized leg 45 min 4 times/week for 12 weeks, while the other leg remained untrained. In Period 2, 12 of the 23
individuals trained both legs with the same protocol as for the trained leg in Period 1, thus 2x45 min each session for 45 sessions in total. Both Periods
included a 4-week “pre-test”phase in which individuals underwent a VO2-peak test, a one-legged performance test and biopsies were taken from both
legs. After both training periods, skeletal muscle biopsies and performance tests were repeated for both legs; b) Performance results from the

 During the nine months following the end of Period 1, the subjects were instructed to con-
tinue to live as they did before the study. Twelve of the subjects then started a second 3-month
training period (Period 2). During Period 2, each leg was trained separately (i.e. one-legged

 training) and consecutively (with shifting order at each session) with the exact same workload
protocol applied to the leg trained during Period 1 (Fig 1A). Period 2 induced similar physio-
logical and biochemical changes to Period 1, but in both legs (Figs 1B–1D and S1–S3). At the
gene level, PCA could partially distinguish two clusters for the biopsies collected before (T3)
and after (T4) Period 2 in the previously trained leg. The predictive power (Q2) of the OPLS
model was lower compared to Period 1, indicating the global transcriptome changes were not
as evident (Fig 2C, Tables 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained for splicing events (S4 Fig, S2
and S3 Tables). A very similar OPLS model was also obtained for the previously untrained leg
during Period 2 (U3 vs U4, Fig 2D).
We have previously shown that there are large sex differences in the human skeletal muscle
transcriptome at baseline [19]. However, neither multivariate, nor univariate analyses were
able to identify significant sex-specifictranscriptional responses to training, although the base-
line sex differences were similar in this study as well.
Endurance training regulates multiple isoforms from the same gene in
opposite directions
From the loading values of the OPLS models, we identified significant differentially expressed
isoforms and genes. Over the first training period, 3,404 putative isoforms (S4 Table), belong-
ing to 2,624 different genes, were differentially expressed (Fig 3A). Over 80% of these genes dif-
ferentially expressed a single splice variant, while 13% and 4% expressed two and three splice
variants, respectively. The remaining 2% of the genes differentially expressed between 4–8 dif-
ferent splice variants, the exception being NDRG2, where 17 variants decreased and one variant

 increased significantly with training. In total, 53% of the isoforms were downregulated with
training, whereas 47% were upregulated.
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the differentially expressed isoforms were highly
associated with cellular respiration (fold enrichment (FE) 5.1, false discovery rate (FDR)
<10−10) and ATP synthesis coupled electron transport (FE 5.7, FDR < 10−10). Also at pathway
level (using KEGG) oxidative phosphorylation (FE 3.8, FDR < 10−10) and the TCA cycle (FE
4.1, FDR < 0.001) were highly enriched. This is very similar to what has been observedfor
training-induced changes of gene expression at gene level [18].
Fifty-four genes had multiple differentially expressed isoforms that were also regulated in
different directions with training. The mitochondrial ATP synthase ATP5G1, for example, had
three protein-coding isoforms increasing in expression and one decreasing. Other interesting
examples are also shown in Fig 3B. To identify the most training-responsive putative isoforms
and validate the findings from Period 1, we compared those results with both legs trained in
Period 2. Despite having a lower statistical power due to a smaller sample size in Period 2, 153
isoforms (belonging to 142 different genes) were differentially expressed in all trained legs (Fig
3A, S5 Table). GO analysis of these 153 isoforms resulted in a similar profile to the full isoform
analysis, but with stronger enrichment. Specific genes of interest among the 153 included genes
that also changed at gene level, e.g. the collagens (COL4A1 and COL4A2), HADHB for lipid
metabolism, three different isoforms of PDHA1 for glucose metabolism and many genes
involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (e.g. COX4I1, COX5A, NDUFA3,
NDUFB5, SDHB and UQCRC2).
All analyses conducted at isoform level were also performed at the gene level. For Period 1,
we found 2,394 differentially expressed genes with similar enriched molecular functions and
pathways to the isoform analysis. S5 Fig shows a Venn diagram comparing gene changes in the
two periods. Differential gene expression at gene level from Period 1 has been reported previ-
ously [18].
34 novel transcripts regulated by exercise training
RNA-seq analysis allows for discovery of novel transcripts and splicing events, and evidence
from previous RNA-seq studies has demonstrated that the human genome is widely tran-
scribed from both coding and non-coding regions [20]. To investigate whether exercise-
induced expression changes occur also in unannotated parts of the genome, we used our
recently published list of 2,430 novel transcripts expressed at baseline in human skeletal muscle
[19]. Analysis of the trained leg from Period 1 using Limma [21] identified 35 novel transcripts
(i.e. not included in Ensembl annotation v. 71) that were differentially expressed (Table 3, Fig
4). The novel transcripts were distributed across most chromosomes, and varied in size and
expression level (Table 3). Two novel transcripts, NOVEL1037 and NOVEL1303, were identi-
fied as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) based on comparison to a recent paper [22]. Further compari-
son to the RIKEN enhancer and TSS databases [22] confirmed that NOVEL1037 was
enhancer-like, while NOVEL1303 had an H3K4me1 signal. Eight other novel transcripts were
also defined as enhancer-like (S6 Table). We also investigated all transcripts using the Integra-
tive Genomics Viewer (IGV) [23] and the UCSC Genome Browser [24]. One of the putative
novel transcripts overlapped with a known gene, PECAM1, not present in the ENSEMBL anno-
tation file but defined by RefSeq [25]. This gene is known to be induced by endurance training
[26], which was hence confirmed by our results. Consequently, exercise altered the expression
of 34 novel transcripts in total, nine were upregulated and 25 were downregulated. Two-thirds
overlapped (partly or fully) with BodyMap skeletal muscle assembled transcripts and over 75%
overlapped with conservedregions in chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, mouse, rat or dog

 according to UCSC Genome Browser. All 34 transcripts contained predicted open reading
frames (ORFs) based on the ORF Finder Sequence Manipulation Suits (SMS) and between two
and eleven protein-coding motifs (identified using Motif Search). The most common motif
was the EGF-like domain signature 1 found in 30 out of 34 transcripts. This motif has an
unclear functional significance,but is present in most animal proteins. Another common motif
was 2Fe-2S ferrodoxin-type iron-sulfur binding region signature, found in 25 out of 34 tran-
scripts. Ferrodoxins are small electron transfer proteins that are ubiquitous in biological redox
systems, and the conservedregion of the 2Fe-2S ferrodoxin family is found in various organ-
isms including humans [27]. Additional information on the 34 novel transcripts is provided in
Tables 3 and S6.
Five novel transcripts were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. The mean expres-
sion changes agreed with the RNA-seq results in all cases, with two transcripts showing

 statistical significance, while there was a trend for the remaining three (p�0.1) (S6 Fig). S6 Fig
also shows qPCR validation of the expression of two genes at gene level (IGF2 and FABP4) and
two specific isoforms (of MUSTN1 and SPARC), that all significantly changed in the same
direction with training in Period 1 as measured by RNA-seq.
In Period 1, 61 previously unannotated putative splice variants of known genes were also
found to change with training (S7 Table). Examples included A2M, FABP3, KRT222, NOS2
and TACO1.
Lack of evidence for an endurance training-induced skeletal muscle
global transcriptomememory
One purpose of repeated training of a previously trained leg compared to a previously
untrained leg was to investigate the possible presence of skeletal muscle memory represented at
the transcriptome level. To investigate if any transcriptional effects remained from the first
training period,we conducted two different analyses. First, we compared samples before Period
1 (T1) with the previously trained leg before Period 2 (T3). PCA could not separate the samples
clearly, but the OPLS model showed a small difference between these two time points (predic-
tive power Q2 of 0.15) (Fig 5A, Tables 1 and 2) indicating small transcriptome differences. To
investigate if the differences were an effect of previous training of the trained leg (i.e. muscle
memory) or simply the time between sample collections (one year between samples preceding
Periods 1 and 2), we compared biopsies from the trained leg before Period 2 (T3) with the
untrained leg at the same time point (U3). We assumed any effect of time to be the same on
both legs. PCA could not separate the sample groups, and the OPLS model clearly showed no
significant difference between the biopsies (the predictive power of the model was negative)
(Fig 5B, Tables 1 and 2). Moreover, there were no specific genes that differed significantly
between the two legs before Period 2. Therefore, these results show that the first training period
did not lead to any detectable remaining effects at the overall transcriptome level after a
9-month break. However, the rate of perceived exertion (Borg-scale) in the exercising leg from
the end of the first training session in Period 2 was lower (perceived as easier) in the previously
trained leg (mean±SD T-leg: 13.3±2.6, U-leg 14.0±2.9, p = 0.05).
Additionally, we examined whether transcription could be affected to a different degree fol-
lowing repeated training in the “primed” trained leg in comparison to the previously untrained
leg. For this purpose we compared the effect of training on differential gene expression in the
different legs following period 2 (T3 vs T4 and U3 vs U4). As expected,training induced signifi-
cant gene expression changes in both legs. In the previously trained leg, 852 genes significantly
changed (T3 vs T4), while in the previously untrained leg, 928 genes changed (U3 vs U4). Inter-
estingly, only 180 of those genes were common between the two legs. However, when compar-
ing the two legs after Period 2 (T4 vs U4), the biopsies could not be separated in the PCA and
the OPLS showed no statistical difference between the two groups (Tables 1 and 2, S2 and S3).
Physiological, biochemical and transcriptionalalterations in response to
repeated endurance training
There is a lack of knowledge of how the same individual responds to repeated biological inter-
ventions, including training. Given this, we sought to determine if an individual responds the
same when exposed to the same environmental stimulus a second time. To investigate this we
performed a specific analysis comparing the response to Period 1 and 2 only for the 12 individ-
uals that took part in both training periods. Physiological performance, β-HAD and CS activity
unexpectedlycorrelated rather poorly between Period 1 and Period 2 (Fig 6A). OPLS analysis
of the gene changes in the 12 individuals showed that Period 1 induced greater and more

 robust transcriptome changes compared to Period 2 (S8 Table). A Venn diagram of the gene
changes in all three comparisons is shown in Fig 6B. Gene ontology analysis of the genes that
changed significantly in at least two comparisons showed a clear enrichment of functional cate-
gories highly relevant for training adaptation, including cellular respiration (FE 10,
FDR<2�10−26) and the Kegg pathway oxidative phosphorylation (FE 8.4, FDR<7�10−37), cate-
gories that did not appear as significant when analyzing genes changing uniquely in one com-
parison. To further investigate the repeated training response, we compared the fold changes
of the 2,227 differentially expressed genes in Period 1 with the fold changes in Period 2 (T3 vs
T4) (Fig 6C and 6D). Over 90% of the 2,227 significant genes in Period 1 had an absolute fold

 change in the same direction in T3 vs T4, i.e. repeated training in the same leg one year later.
When including the same genes for the previously untrained leg as well (U3 vs U4), almost
80% changed in the same direction in all three comparisons. Consequently, the correlation for
gene changes in response to repeated training was high (Fig 6C). Despite this, there were also
specific and highly interesting differences in the responses. Based on Ingenuity pathway analy-
sis (IPA), Periods 1 and 2 showed similar changes for oxidative phosphorylation but different
for ECM (extracellular matrix) reorganization and angiogenesis (Fig 6E and 6F). All signifi-
cantly enriched canonical pathways are listed in S9 Table (T1 vs T2) and S10 Table (T3 vs T4).
IPA also identifies upstream regulatory factors that could be driving the observedalterations in
gene expression. As expected,Period 1 and 2 had several transcriptional regulators in common,
e.g. ATF6, TP53 and the cytokine SPP1. Uniquely represented in Period 1 were, for example,
ERG and SPDEF, members of the ETS family of transcription factors, which have been shown
to be enriched in regions with a decrease in DNA methylation with endurance training in
Period 1 [18]. AMPK and the estrogen receptor are two additional examples that appeared
uniquely in Period 1 (see S11 Table for significant upstream regulators). Unique to Period 2
were for example PPARGC1B, known to be involved in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis in
response to training [28], and ESRRA (see S12 Table for significant upstream regulators for
Period 2, T3 vs T4).
Discussion
We applied RNA sequencing to a total of 119 human skeletal muscle biopsies, to thoroughly
investigate the repeated training-induced transcriptome at both the gene and isoform levels.
The RNA-seq technology is becoming a standard method to quantify RNA expression [29]. To
our knowledge, this dataset represents one of the very few large human skeletal muscle RNA-
seq data collections currently available and the only one with repeated sampling following an
environmental lifestyle intervention. Multivariate statistics were used to analyze this large data-
set to account for interdependences among genes [30]. Also, multivariate data analysis tech-
niques have already been successfully applied to gene/isoform expression analyses [19, 31, 32].
The one-legged training regime in this study has the advantage of including an intraindivi-
dual control leg (the untrained leg). The only difference between the two legs was the training
stimulus, since both legs had the same genome and were exposed to identical environmental
factors (e.g. diet, stress and sleep) and the same systemic arterial blood composition. This
unique control allowed us to isolate training-specificeffects on the transcriptome. The control
leg was, however, not completely unaffected by training since exercise-related changes in blood
flow and an increased concentration of hormones and growth factors are able to induce effects
outside the exercising leg [33]. The exercising muscle itself secretes myokines into the circula-
tion [34], with potential endocrine effects.

 More than 3,000 isoforms were significantly changed with training in Period 1. Many of the
specific genes and their splicing events are highly biologically interesting. The SPARC gene had
five different isoforms that significantly increased between 1.5- and 3-fold. Suppression of
SPARC (or osteonectin) in skeletal muscle of mice causes myofiber atrophy [35] and it is also
expressed at lower levels in beta cells of type II diabetic patients [36]. An isoform of TGFB1I1
(or HIC-5) was induced >3-fold with training. It is a coactivator of the androgen receptor and
its multiple splice variants have been shown to be involved in myogenesis [37]. Three isoforms
of the MUSTN1 gene were downregulated by 1.1–1.7 times. MUSTN1 (Musculoskeletal,
Embryonic Nuclear Protein) has been shown to be markedly upregulated following one bout of
resistance exercise [38]. Of interest among the 153 isoforms that changed in both periods was a
decrease in one splice variant of the HIPK3 protein kinase. This gene has not been reported in
association with exercise training before. Its protein phosphorylates the transcriptional regula-
tors c-Jun and RUNX2 [39]. JUN is activated by skeletal muscle contraction in rats [40] and
the RUNX2 related family member RUNX1 has been predicted as an important transcriptional
regulator of the training-induced transcriptome in humans [2].
In this study, 54 genes had isoforms that changed in different directions, which indicates
potential alternative functions in training adaptation and highlights a problem with measuring
gene expression only at gene level. It could also be due to a change in the cellular composition
of the muscle with training, as different splicing events are commonly associated to specific cell
types and tissues [6]. The most broadly regulated isoform set was NDRG2, a member of the N-
myc downregulated gene family, which belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. In
C2C12 myotubes it has been identified as a PGC1α/ERRα transcriptional target, which influ-
ences protein turnover and the regulation of genes involved in muscle contraction and function
[41]. NDRG2 is phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation and has been identified as a
mediator of the cardioprotective effects of insulin on ischemia-reperfusioninjuries following
myocardial infarctions [42]. Seventeen of the 18 differentially regulated isoforms of NDRG2
(NDRG Family Member 2) were downregulated between 1.3 and 2.9 times. ENST00000397855
was the only NDRG2 splice variant that was upregulated (FC 2.2). A human resistance training
study showed that NDRG2 gene expression was downregulated during hypertrophic conditions
[43]. The FUS (Fused in Sarcoma) gene encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in pre-
mRNA processing, including splicing [44]. Three FUS isoforms were downregulated with
training, all retained introns according to Ensembl, while one protein-coding isoform was
upregulated (FC 1.8). Overexpression of FUS leads to motor neuron loss and muscle atrophy
associated to development of ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) [44, 45], while physiological
upregulation of FUS could have implications for alternative splicing regulation. PKM (Pyruvate
kinase, Muscle) encodes an ATP-producing glycolytic enzyme and had three protein-coding
isoforms differentially expressed with training, two decreased and one increased significantly.
In relation to exercise training, alternative isoforms of PGC1α (PPARGC1A) have been pro-
posed to have different functions based on the observations that they are induced to a different
degree following different forms of exercise training [7, 8]. No splice variants of PGC1α were
significantly induced by training in the present study. However, this was not unexpectedas
most splice variants have been shown to go back to baseline levels 24h after an acute bout of
exercise [46], and the biopsies in the present studies were obtained at that time point.
A total of 34 novel transcripts changed in response to three months of endurance training.
All contained open reading frames and predicted protein-coding motifs, indicating protein-
coding potential. Two transcripts were identified as enhancer transcripts (eRNAs) when com-
pared to a recent study by Arner et al. 2015 [22]. eRNAs have been suggested to support inter-
action between the enhancer and the genes it regulates [47]. eRNA transcription is typically
very low, in accordance with our novel eRNA transcripts. Also, a change in enhancer

 transcription has been linked to changes in gene activity of nearby genes [48]. Although func-
tional analyses are required to fully confirm that the novel transcripts are relevant to exercise
training responses, these results are interesting as a first indication of how transcription from
unannotated regions may be important for exercise training adaptation.
There is a notion in the popular science literature that once a person has been fit it is easier
to become fit again. This belief is commonly attributed to a skeletal muscle memory, despite a
lack of scientific evidence. After nine months of detraining there were no significant remaining
effects in one-legged performance with regard to skeletal muscle enzymatic markers or the
global transcriptome. However, there might be limitations to this analysis, i.e. batch effects
(despite applying batch correction) and lack of power in Period 2, which could have blunted
possible effects. Furthermore, there could be other remaining effects, e.g. differences in fiber
type distribution, vascularization or epigenetic patterns. Strength training in mice and anabolic
steroid use in humans have been shown to increase the number of nuclei in skeletal muscle
cells, which persists after cessation of training and drug intake, respectively [16, 17]. In relation
to endurance training, one study has shown that a 20% increase in CS activity with training
was maintained after eight weeks of detraining [49], however the majority of the changes are
presumed to be gradually lost upon training cessation [14].
Despite not finding any significant evidence of an endurance-induced skeletal muscle tran-
scriptome-level memory after detraining with this experimental set-up, a molecular memory
mechanism could exist at e.g the epigenetic level and potentially induce a different response in
the previously trained leg compared to the previously untrained leg. Apart from a significant
increase of β-HAD activity in the previously untrained leg only, there were no significant phys-
iological differences in response between the two legs. At the transcriptome level, the second
training period induced significant changes in both legs. Although there were differences in the
specific gene changes between the two legs, there was a clear fold change correlation between
the genes that changed in Period 1 and those that changed in both legs trained in Period 2. The
overall ontology was also similar between the two training periods. This shows that the tran-
scriptome response to training was rather consistent, although differences in the specific genes
affected and the degree of physiological and biochemical change exist. Interestingly, the small-
est correlation was observedbetween the gene changes of the two legs trained in Period 2. The
rate of perceived exertion during the first session in Period 2 was significantly lower in the pre-
viously trained leg, and although this measurement is inherently impossible to blind, both
observations could implicate some remaining effects from previous training. Furthermore, the
reduction in the number of gene changes in Period 2 compared to Period 1 could be attributed
to some unknown, possibly systemic, memory effect invoked by training of the previously
trained leg at the start of Period 2. Because the reduction was observedin both legs, the effect
would have to be systemic, affecting both legs, rather than local to the previously trained leg.
Comparing the trained leg in Period 1 to the same leg retrained in Period 2, over 90% of genes
numerically changed in the same direction, while 168 genes did not. Even though none of these
168 significantly changed in Period 2, this could reflect a possible memory mechanism associ-
ated to these genes. The data is therefore not convincing enough to conclude the presence of a
training-induced skeletal muscle memory, but not exclude it either.
Whether individuals, physiologically or transcriptionally, respond consistently to repeated
exercise regimens is very poorly addressed [15]. Any such within-subject variability in training
response can only be evaluated with experiments that repeatedly expose an individual to a stan-
dardized exercise regimen. The design of the present study allowed us to address this. It was
clear that repeated exercise periods led to quite consistent changes of a sub-set of genes, but
also that a large fraction of individual genes changed significantly only in one training period.
Such inconsistency may be due to true but random within-subject variability or differences in

 diet or other lifestyle domains. It may also be due to methodologicaland power issues with
some genes reaching significance in one training period but fail to do so in the other. One cate-
gory that appeared significant only in Period 1 was hepatic stellate cell activation. The included
genes, as illustrated in Fig 6F, were related to extracellular matrix remodeling (e.g. the colla-
gens) and angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF, PDGF and TGF-beta1), both functionally important also in
skeletal muscle adaptation to training [50, 51].
In conclusion, endurance training altered over three thousand human skeletal muscle iso-
forms, highly associated to oxidative ATP production. Interestingly, several isoforms expressed
from the same gene were regulated in opposite directions, which may indicate different func-
tions. That 34 novel transcripts, all with protein-coding potential, were regulated provides a
first indication that transcriptional regulation of hitherto unannotated regions might have rele-
vance for exercise training adaptation. We found no coherent evidence of a skeletal muscle
transcriptome memory, even though there were some data indicating a training-induced mem-
ory mechanism. These findings show the great need for highly controlled studies of repeated
exercise training to provide further insights into intra-individual biological response variability
and the potential presence of skeletal muscle memory.
Materials and Methods
Study participants
Before the study, named EpiTrain, the experimental protocol was explained to all subjects,
and written informed consent was obtained. The study was approved by the Ethics Commit-
tee of Karolinska Institutet (approval number: 2008/1747-31/2) and conformed to the Decla-
ration of Helsinki. Twenty-three young, healthy, non-smoking, volunteers (eleven females
and twelve males), participated in the study. Baseline characteristics, including fitness level
based on a VO2 peak test (mean ± SD 39.0 ± 3.8 ml�kg-1�min-1), have been published previ-
ously [18].
Experimentaldesign
Before training, one-legged performance was assessed through a 15-minute optimal perfor-
mance test, as previously reported [18]. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained under local
anesthesia by the percutaneous needle technique [52] from the vastus lateralis muscle of both
legs and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. All subjects subsequently started the first train-
ing period, training one randomized leg four times per week for 12 weeks. All participants
completed a total of 45 training sessions. For more details on the training protocol, see Lind-
holm et al. [18]. Twenty-four hours after the last training session of the first training period,
skeletal muscle biopsies were collected again from both legs and the performance test was
repeated within one week after the last session (Period 1).
Nine months later, twelve of the subjects (six males and six females, mean ± SD age
28.5 ± 3.8 years, height 173.8 ± 8.6 cm, BMI 25.9 ± 4.0 kg�m-2 and VO2 peak 40.3 ± 4.3
ml�kg-1�min-1) continued to perform a second training period (Period 2). The same one-leg-
ged performance test was conducted and biopsies were obtained from both legs before and
after the training. Period 2 consisted of exactly the same training as the first period (same
workload protocol and number of sessions), but now for both legs, one at a time with shifting
order at each session. The workload exerted on each leg was thus the same as for the one leg
trained in Period 1, but the whole-body energy expenditure was double in Period 2. This
repeated training period has not been reported previously. The full experimental design is
illustrated in Fig 1A.

 Enzyme activity assays
Enzyme activity was measured in the skeletal muscle biopsies from all time points and legs.
The procedure has been previously described[18]. In brief, freeze-driedbiopsies were homoge-
nized in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.7) with 0.5% BSA. For citrate synthase (CS), the tissue
lysates were mixed with a reagent solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM L-malate,
512.5 nM NAD+, 399μg MDH). Acetyl-CoA started the reaction and the velocity was registered
with a fluorometer. β-HAD activity was measured in a reagent solution (0,5M Imidazol (pH 7),
0.1M EDTA, 5mM NADH diluted in carbonate buffer, 2mM AcAcetyl-CoA) where addition
of the tissue lysate started the reaction. Fluorecence of β-HAD oxidation of NADH to NAD+
was recorded and related to a standard curve.
RNA extraction, quality control and sequencing
Total RNA was extracted by the Trizol method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to
the specifications from the manufacturer. The concentration and quality of the total RNA was
determined using the RNA 6000 Nano chip on the 2100 Bioanalyzer automated electrophoresis
system (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Two μg of total RNA was used for
poly-A-selection followed by library preparation of each sample, which was subsequently bar-
coded and prepared (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The libraries were clustered on a cBot
cluster-generation system using an Illumina HiSeq paired-end cluster-generation kit and
sequenced as paired-end, 2x100 bp on the Illumina HiSeq 2000. All lanes were spiked with 1%
phiX control library. All 119 samples underwent sequencing.
Sequence read alignment and analysis
2.43 billion paired-end reads underwent quality and adapter trimming using Trim Galore v.
0.2.7 (www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/).Subsequently, the pro-
cessed reads were aligned to the human genome reference hg19 with TopHat version 2.0.4 [53]
using standard parameters except for:—solexa1.3-quals-p 8 –no-discordant as well as–tran-
scriptome-index used on an index built from ENSEMBL v71 transcript annotation. Transcript
assembly of the aligned reads was performed by using Cufflinks version 2.1.1 [54] with the
max-bundle-frags option set to 1e9 and Fragments Per Kilobase of Exon per Million mapped
fragments (FPKM) values were calculated using the same software. The aligned reads and the
software HTSeq version 0.5.1 [55] were used to count the number of reads per gene. The gene
counts generated by HTSeq were used for differentially expressed analysis using Limma [21].
Cufflinks gene and isoform FPKM values, which were first corrected for batch effect using
ComBat [56], were used for differential expression analysis in Simca p+13.0.3x64 (Umetrics).
Differential expression of previously unannotated splicing events was performed using Ball-
gown [57].
Multivariate data analysis
The identification of differentially expressed genes and isoforms, using the software Simca p+-
13.0.3x64 (Umetrics), was conducted applying the multivariate statistical tools Principal Com-
ponent Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures by means of partial
least squares (OPLS). The software was run with default parameters except for “Confidence
level on parameters” that was set to 99% and “Significance level” that was set to 0.01. The appli-
cation of multivariate data analysis techniques to gene/isoform expression analyses has already
been described[31, 32]. Briefly, OPLS calculates the systematic variation in X matrix and
divides it into two parts: one that is linearly related to Y (and therefore predictive) and one that

 is unrelated (orthogonal) to Y [56, 58]. Data pre-processing for PCA and OPLS analysis, both
for gene and isoform expression data (mean FPKM >1), was based on mean-centering and
unit variance scaling. Cross-validation was applied to estimate the model complexity [59]. The
analyses were performed comparing leg biopsies collected before and after the first training
period. Model parameters for PCA are shown in Tables 1 and S2, whereas for OPLS in Tables 2
and S3. 12,848 genes and 23,418 isoforms were included in the different time point
comparisons.
OPLS model loading values, together with their jack knife confidence levels, were used to
calculate the significance of differentially expressed isoforms/gene [58, 59]. More precisely, the
significance was calculated as absolute value, ABS (loading)–ABS (jack knife confidence inter-
val). Genes and isoforms with a positive value of significance indicated that a gene/isoform was
significant.
Gene ontology and network analysis
For functional and pathway annotation of all differentially expressed isoforms and genes as
well as a subset of the differentially expressed isoforms, the DAVID functional annotation tool
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov)was used. Differential expression was also analyzed with the
Ingenuity pathway analysis software (Ingenuity Systems, Inc., Redwood,CA, USA; www.
ingenuity.com) with standard parameters and including the “Causal network” option. In the
Ingenuity software the isoform IDs were automatically converted to the corresponding gene
IDs by the software itself.
Novel transcript discovery and analysis
The 2,430 novel human skeletal muscle transcripts published by Lindholm et al. [19] were sub-
ject to a differential expression analysis using the Bioconductor package Limma [21]. By com-
paring the biopsies for the trained leg taken before and after the first training period we
identified in total 34 differentially expressed novel transcripts not included in Ensembl annota-
tion v. 71 and not defined by RefSeq [25]. The transcripts were compared with BodyMap skele-
tal muscle assembly (GEO accession GSE30611). Conservedregions overlapping with chimp,
rhesus, mouse, rat and dog were analyzed using UCSC Genome Browser [24]. Open reading
frames were defined using ORF Finder Sequence Manipulation Suits (SMS) and a subset of the
genes were analyzed using Motif Search (www.genome.jp/tools/motif).
qPCR validation
Two known genes, two isoforms and five novel transcripts were validated using quantitative
real-time PCR. cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of total RNA and the High Capacity cDNA
reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a total volume of 20 μl
(in 23 individuals before and after training for the trained leg). Taqman reagents were used for
known genes and RPS18 was used as an endogenous control (FABP4 Hs 00609791-m1, IGF2
Hs 00171254.m1, RPS18 Hs01375212-m1, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For iso-
forms and novel transcripts, primers were designed to identify MUSTN1 ENST00000513520
(forward: GCACCTTGGAAGCACCAATA, reverse: AGCAGTGAAAGCAGGACGAG), and
SPARC ENST00000521569 (forward: CCTGTCTCTAAACCCCTCCA, reverse: TCCTCTG

CAGGAGGCCTACAC, reverse: CCATCGATGTTGGTGTTGAG) as an endogenous control.
The reaction volume was 10 or 15 μL, including 1–4 μL of sample cDNA diluted 1:25, primers
and Taqman Fast Universal PCR Master Mix or SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Bio-
systems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All SYBR Green quantification reactions were verified with a
melting curve and size of transcript was verified on an agarose gel.
