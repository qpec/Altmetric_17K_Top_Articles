Abstract
Importance—A 2009 randomized clinical trial (RCT) demonstrated that using CA-125 tests for 
routine surveillance in ovarian cancer increases chemotherapy use and decreases patients’ quality 
of life without improving survival, compared with clinical observation. The Society of 
Gynecologic Oncology guidelines categorize CA-125 testing as “optional” and discourage the use

 of radiographic imaging for routine surveillance. To date, few studies have examined their use in 
clinical practice.
Objective—To examine the use of CA-125 tests and CT scans in clinical practice before and 
after the 2009 RCT and estimate the economic impact of surveillance testing.
Design—Prospective cohort of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2004-2011 and 
followed through 2012.
Setting—Six National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers.
Participants—1,241 women with ovarian cancer in clinical remission after completion of 
primary cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy.
Main Outcome Measures—Use of CA-125 tests and CT scans before and after 2009 
(n=1,241). Secondary outcomes included: the time from CA-125 doubling to retreatment among 
women who experienced a rise in CA-125 (n=511) before and after 2009, and the costs associated 
with surveillance testing using 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates.
Results—Use of CA-125 testing and CT scans was very similar over the study period. During 12 
months of surveillance, the cumulative incidence of 3 or more CA-125 tests was 86% in 
2004-2009 versus 91% in 2010-2012 (P=.95), and the cumulative incidence of more than 1 CT 
scan was 81% (2004-2009) versus 78% (2010-2012) (P=.50). Among women who experienced a 
CA-125 doubling (n=511), there was no significant difference in the time to retreatment with 
chemotherapy before and after 2009 (median: 2.8 months vs. 3.5 months, P=.40). Over a 12-month 
period, there were a mean of 4.6 CA-125 tests and 1.7 CT scans per patient, resulting in a United 
States population surveillance cost estimate of $1,999,029/year for CA-125 tests alone and 
$16,194,647/year with CT scans added.
Conclusion—CA-125 tests and CT scans are routinely employed for surveillance testing in 
patients with ovarian cancer, although their benefit has not been proven and their use may have 
significant quality of life and cost implications.

Introduction
The cost of cancer care is rising rapidly,1 prompting physicians and payors to identify “low-
value” practices that increase costs without improving outcomes.2 In 2012 the American 
Board of Internal Medicine’s “Choosing Wisely” campaign challenged specialists to identify 
tests and treatments that are overused without providing meaningful clinical benefit. In 
response, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Society for Gynecologic 
Oncology (SGO) recommended stopping surveillance testing in some asymptomatic 
patients.3
In the 2009 ASCO Annual meeting plenary session, Rustin et al, presented results from a 
clinical trial that randomized ovarian cancer patients in clinical remission to active

 surveillance with CA-125 testing or monitoring for symptoms of recurrent disease.4,5 There 
was no difference in survival between the groups, but women followed with CA-125 tests 
received more chemotherapy and had worse quality of life. The authors concluded that early 
detection and treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer did not improve clinical outcomes and 
recommended stopping surveillance testing.
Despite this, the 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Center Network’s (NCCN) clinical 
guidelines recommend routine CA-125 testing for patients whose CA-125 levels were 
elevated at diagnosis and CT scans “if clinically indicated.”6 SGO guidelines categorize 
CA-125 testing as “optional,” and advise against routine radiographic surveillance.7 More 
recently, as part of the “Choosing Wisely” campaign, SGO explicitly recommended 
avoidance of routine imaging for ovarian cancer surveillance.3 To date, surveillance testing 
remains controversial and it is unclear how frequently is performed in patients with ovarian 
cancer.
The aim of this study was to examine the use of CA-125 surveillance testing at six National 
Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers over time, and to determine whether the rates 
decreased after the Rustin data were presented in 2009. We hypothesized that CA-125 
testing rates would not drop, but that the time to retreatment would increase, as providers 
delayed treatment to minimize reductions in patients’ quality of life while monitoring them 
closely for disease complications. We also examined the utilization of CT scans as few 
multi-institutional studies have described this previously. Finally, we sought to explore the 
economic impact of current ovarian cancer surveillance practices.
Materials and Methods
Data source
The NCCN Ovarian Cancer Outcomes Database contains data collected prospectively on all 
patients diagnosed with ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal cancers, and treated at six 
institutions between January 2004 and December 2011, including: City of Hope 
Comprehensive Cancer Center, Dana-Farber/Brigham & Women’s Cancer Center, Fox 
Chase Cancer Center, the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, the 
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the University of Michigan 
Comprehensive Cancer Center. Patients who received all or part of their treatment at these 
centers were included; those seen for a single consultation were excluded. Medical record 
abstraction was performed to obtain patient characteristics (e.g. demographics, 
comorbidities, performance status), tumor characteristics (histology, grade, stage), 
treatments (e.g., surgical procedures, chemotherapy), surveillance studies (CA-125 and CT 
scans), and vital status. Data on race/ethnicity were collected at initial presentation to the 
NCCN institution and analyzed because of documented disparities in the quality of ovarian 
cancer care by race.8 Additional audits were undertaken at all six institutions prior to 
analysis for any patients with missing data on key variables (CA-125 values, CT scans) to 
further verify the accuracy of the database. The Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at each 
center approved the overall project, or deemed it exempt from review.

 Study Cohorts
We identified two cohorts of patients. In Cohort 1, we examined the cumulative incidence of 
CA-125 testing and CT scans for all patients (n=1,241) who presented with newly diagnosed 
epithelial ovarian cancer to an NCCN center between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 
2011, underwent cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy, and met the Rustin study criteria 
for remission defined as: (1) normal CA-125 concentration, and (2) no additional 
chemotherapy or hormonal treatments within 4 months after completion of chemotherapy. 
We excluded patients enrolled in clinical trials (n=272) because their surveillance testing 
would be dictated by the trial protocol. In Cohort 2, which included a subset of patients from 
Cohort 1, we examined the time to retreatment with chemotherapy among 511 patients 
whose CA-125 doubled relative to the post-treatment nadir during the surveillance period. 
Patients were excluded from Cohort 2 if they initiated secondary therapy prior to a doubling 
of the CA-125 (suggesting clinical signs of recurrence; n=60) or had radiographic evidence 
of recurrence prior to the doubling of the CA-125 (n=31). All patients were divided into two 
groups: (1) “pre-Rustin” diagnosed between 2004-2009, and (2) “post-Rustin” diagnosed 
between 2010-2011. Data were collected on all patients through December 31, 2012.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the use of CA-125 testing and CT scans in the first year after 
remission (Cohort 1). We also examined patient factors associated with testing. Secondary 
outcomes included: (1) time to retreatment with chemotherapy or radiation after a 
documented CA-125 doubling (Cohort 2), and (2) the costs associated with surveillance 
testing using 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates.
Independent variables
The primary independent variable of interest was era of diagnosis (pre-Rustin: 2004-2009 
vs. post-Rustin: 2010-2011). Additional covariates included: age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, 
GOG performance status, Charlson comorbidity score,9 stage, grade, histology, CA-125 at 
diagnosis, and institution.
Statistical Analyses
Post-treatment CA-125 tests and CT scans were quantified using the cumulative incidence of 
patients with 1, 2, and 3+ surveillance tests plotted over time for patients diagnosed in the 
pre- and post-Rustin periods (Cohort 1). Patients were categorized as “in remission” after 
documentation of the first normal CA-125 value within 4 months of completion of primary 
chemotherapy. Patients were censored at the earlier of: 1) initiation of second-line therapy, 
2) CA-125 doubling, 3) recurrence, or 4) death or loss to follow-up. The time to retreatment 
after a CA-125 doubling was also quantified using the cumulative incidence of retreatment 
plotted over time (Cohort 2).
Unadjusted associations between patient and disease characteristics and the time to post-
treatment surveillance and retreatment were assessed using the log rank test. Multivariable 
associations were assessed with a Cox proportional hazards model including all covariates, 
except for GOG performance status and ethnicity due to collinearity with the institution 
variable. Due to limited variability in post-treatment surveillance testing with CA-125 tests

 (95% of patients were tested within 6 months), multivariable associations were not assessed 
for that outcome.
We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we examined the cumulative incidence of 
CA-125 testing, use of CT scans, and time to re-treatment before and after the publication of 
the Rustin et al. study in The Lancet (October 2, 2010), instead of upon presentation of the 
data (June 1, 2009). Second, we examined whether individual institutions responded 
differently to the Rustin trial by plotting the cumulative incidence curves within institutions 
by era of diagnosis. While no substantive difference by era of diagnosis were observed 
within institutions for surveillance (data not shown), we observed two general practice 
patterns for time to retreatment. Specifically, there was no evidence of a practice change 
after 2009 for four institutions, but there was evidence of a practice change after 2009 for 
two institutions. We then combined institutions with similar empirical practice patterns and 
performed an interaction analysis to test formally for a change in time to retreatment in one 
group but not the other.
Costs of routine surveillance tests were estimated from 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates 
using CPT codes: CA-125 test (86304)=$28.35, CT chest with contrast (71260) and CT 
abdomen and pelvis with contrast (74177)=$544.75.10 To calculate the cost of surveillance 
testing over a 12-month period, the mean and median number of tests conducted were 
calculated and 2016 Medicare reimbursement rates applied. A population estimate of women 
entering surveillance testing annually was calculated: 21,290 women were diagnosed with 
ovarian cancer in 2015 of which approximately 90% were epithelial ovarian cancers and 
80% of whom should achieve a clinical remission, resulting in approximately 15,329 women 
entering surveillance.11
A two-sided p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. 
Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Use of CA-125 and CT scans
There were 2,861 patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer at NCCN institutions between 
2004-2011. Among these, 2,082 women underwent cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy, 
excluding clinical trial participants, and 1,241 (pre-Rustin n=905, post-Rustin n=336) 
women met criteria for clinical remission (Figure 1).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative incidence curves of CA-125 testing and CT scans before and 
after the Rustin study presentation. There was no significant difference in surveillance 
testing in the pre- vs. post-Rustin periods; 95% vs. 96% of patients received ≥1 CA-125 test 
within 6 months of remission, and 86% vs. 91% received ≥3 within 12 months. Similarly, 
68% vs. 64% of patients received ≥1 CT scan within 6 months, while 30% vs. 29% received 
≥3 CT scans within 12 months.

 Factors Associated with Testing
Patient characteristics associated with CA-125 testing are shown in Supplemental eTable 1. 
There was no difference in testing rates among patients who had a CA-125 of <35 at 
diagnosis, compared with those who had a CA-125 ≥35 (cumulative incidence: 94% vs. 
95%, P=.86). Institutions differed in their rates of testing at 6 months, although the absolute 
differences were small (range: 93% to 98%, P<.001). CA-125 testing did not vary 
significantly by diagnosis year (range 2004-2011: 94% to 96%, P=.95).
Patient characteristics associated with CT scans after completion of treatment are shown in 
Supplemental eTable 2. Patients diagnosed with advanced stage disease were more likely to 
have CT scans, compared with patients diagnosed with early stage disease. There were also 
significant differences in CT scan utilization among institutions (range at 6 months: 49% to 
81%, P<.001). However, use of CT scans did not differ significantly by year (P=.29). We 
found no evidence of change in CT scan use pre- vs. post-Rustin within institutions (data not 
shown).
Time to retreatment
Figure 2 shows the cumulative incidence of the time to retreatment after a CA-125 doubling 
before and after 2009. The median time to retreatment was 2.8 months before 2009 and 3.5 
months after (P=.40); 71% of patients re-initiated treatment within 6 months during both 
periods. In adjusted analyses, patients diagnosed with advanced stage disease had shorter 
times to retreatment compared with stage I disease (AOR=6.54, 95% CI=3.31-12.95), 
although there was no significant difference in the time to retreatment by era overall.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to compare the use of CA-125, CT scans and the time 
to retreatment before and after the date of study publication (October 2010) instead of the 
ASCO plenary presentation (June 2009), and there were no significant differences in our 
findings. In a second sensitivity analysis, we examined whether individual institutions 
responded differently to the Rustin study results, and found substantive differences in the 
time to retreatment by institution (Figure 5). Specifically, while there was no change in the 
time to retreatment within 4 institutions (Institution Group 1: median time to treatment 
before and after 2009: 3.9 months, log rank p=.70), there was evidence of a delayed time to 
retreatment within two institutions (Institution Group 2: median time to retreatment before 
and after 2009: 1.4 months vs. 3.2 months, log rank p=.01). As shown Supplemental eTable 
3 (see model 2), an interaction analysis confirmed that patients treated at Institutions in 
Group 2 were more likely to be re-treated earlier than patients treated within Institution 
Group 1 before 2009 (HR 1.69, p<.001), but not after (HR=1.06, p=.69).
Economic Impact
The mean and median number of CA-125 tests during 12-month surveillance period was 4.6 
and 4.0, while the mean and median number of CT scans was 1.7 and 1.0. The mean cost of 
testing using 2016 Medicare national reimbursement rates over a 1-year period was 
$1,056.49 per patient (CA-125 tests: $130.41 + CT Scans: $926.08). Assuming that 15,329 
women achieve a clinical remission annually, the total cost of annual surveillance testing for 
this group is approximately $16,194,647/year ($1,999,029/year for CA-125 tests and

 $14,195,618 for CT scans). If the number of surveillance CT scans is increased to 3 (i.e. for 
one-third of patients in this study) the total cost of annual surveillance testing increases to 
$1,747.65 per patient with estimated population cost of $26,789,377.
Discussion
In this study, we found similar rates of surveillance testing at six academic centers before 
and after the presentation of an RCT which demonstrated that the use of surveillance 
CA-125 testing for early detection of recurrent disease decreased patients’ quality of life 
without improving their overall survival.5 After 2009, >90% of patients had ≥3 CA-125 tests 
over a 12-month period, suggesting that the Rustin study did not change practice at six 
NCCN academic centers in spite of widespread discussion.12-15 These results extend those 
from a prior study which employed hypothetical scenarios to survey United States (US) 
gynecologic oncologists about their surveillance practice patterns,16 and several single-
institution retrospective studies.17-19
There are several reasons why the Rustin trial results may not have been widely embraced. 
National guidelines did not consistently advise against surveillance testing.6,7 Many patients 
received single-agent platinum for treatment of recurrent disease, instead of doublet therapy; 
thus survival outcomes may not reflect the US standard of care.14 CA-125 testing may also 
offer other benefits not examined in the Rustin study. Specifically patients and clinicians 
may be reluctant to stop CA-125 testing because it may offer a relatively inexpensive, 
patient-centered approach to maximize treatment options by identifying recurrent disease 
before irreversible disease complications ensue which might limit opportunities for clinical 
trials eligibility or secondary cytoreductive surgery.20-23 To that end, continued testing may 
be a rational, values-based decision to “do everything possible” to guard against the worst-
case scenario. Alternatively, patients and physicians may share a bias towards therapeutic 
action. Earlier studies have documented that data from RCT supporting the adoption of new 
treatments and/or technologies change practice more rapidly than those supporting the de-
adoption of existing practices.24,25
We hypothesized that physicians might delay the time to retreatment with chemotherapy as a 
strategy to minimize harm while continuing to monitor patients closely for disease 
complications. Although our overall results demonstrated no differences in the time to 
retreatment in the pre- and post-Rustin periods, we did observe differences by institution. 
Specifically, while four institutions had similar—and somewhat delayed--times to re-
treatment throughout, two institutions demonstrated an increase in time to retreatment in the 
post-Rustin era. This was the only evidence of a change in practice patterns we observed. 
Notably, this delay post-Rustin brought these two institutions in line with the other four.
To date, few studies have examined the use of CT scans for surveillance testing in ovarian 
cancer. Although one small study found that patients who underwent routine CT scans had 
improved overall survival,26 another documented no difference.19 Although NCCN and 
SGO guidelines state CT scans should be used only when clinically indicated,6,7 and the 
Choosing Wisely® campaign explicitly states that providers should avoid routine 
radiographic surveillance,3 we found that two-thirds of patients had at least one CT scan

 within 6 months, while one-third of patients had ≥3 CT scans within 12 months of stopping 
treatment. Of note, there was significant variation in use of CT scans between institutions, 
suggesting that this may be a reasonable target for improving value. Future studies should 
prospectively examine whether CT scans improve survival, given the significant variation 
and costs associated with this practice.
There is a growing focus on the costs of cancer care as physicians and payors try to 
maximize value in cancer care.1-3,27 Others have estimated the cost of ovarian cancer 
surveillance by modeling the NCCN guidelines, including costs of CA-125 tests, associated 
labs, physician visits and CT scans.17 Our findings extend these studies by quantifying the 
costs of actual surveillance testing at six cancer centers. Our data demonstrate that women 
undergo CA-125 tests approximately every three months and have ≥1 CT scan within the 
first year after entering remission. This results in an estimated mean population cost for 1 
year of ovarian cancer surveillance testing of $16,194,647 per year, predominantly due to 
radiographic imaging. If the number of CT scans is increased to three (1/3 of patients 
received ≥3 CT scans), this calculation increases by $10 million dollars per year. Of note, 
these are conservative estimates, including only the costs of the tests, without consideration 
of expenditures on laboratory tests, physician visits, diagnostic evaluations, or societal costs.
There are several limitations to our analysis. We were not able to definitively distinguish 
between CA-125 tests and imaging ordered in response to patients’ symptoms versus 
surveillance testing in asymptomatic patients, despite careful audits of medical records. We 
expect that our estimates are conservative, however, because some patients received care at 
outside facilities which we could not capture. We also restricted the surveillance window to 
include the time between the first normal CA-125 and a CA-125 doubling, excluding 
“baseline” CT scans obtained after chemotherapy and CT scans performed after a doubling 
of the CA-125. Therefore, our results may underestimate actual surveillance testing. The 
analysis is also limited to six comprehensive cancer centers through 2012 and may not be 
representative of practices outside of academic institutions or in later time periods. Finally, 
the cost calculations are rough population estimates, reliant upon assumptions of the number 
of women entering surveillance annually.
In closing, we found that CA-125 tests and CT scans are routinely employed in ovarian 
cancer patients who are in clinical remission. Although a RCT demonstrated that 
surveillance testing results in worse quality of life without improvements in survival, our 
results demonstrate that the recommendation to avoid routine surveillance testing has not 
been adopted into clinical practice in the US. Similarly, although the routine use of CT scans 
has been strongly discouraged by guideline committees, CT scans appear to be routinely 
utilized at significant cost. These practices have significant, but poorly understood 
psychosocial and cost implications, and no benefit on survival to date. Future studies should 
examine which patient populations benefit most from surveillance testing to improve the 
value of cancer care in this patient population.

 Figure 5. 
Cumulative incidence of time to retreatment after doubling of CA-125 by era of diagnosis, 
separately for institutions grouped according to empirical practice patterns. Patients were 
censored at last follow-up and death. Two practice patterns were observed: in group 1 (N=4 
institutions), the time to retreatment was similar both pre- and post-Rustin (log rank P=.70); 
in group 2 (N=2 institutions), the time to retreatment was longer post-Rustin (log rank P=.
01).
