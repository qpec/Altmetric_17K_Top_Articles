Beverage Health Warning 
Labels on Parents’
 Choices

abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: US states have introduced bills requiring sugar-sweetened 
beverages (SSBs) to display health warning labels. This study examined how such labels 
may influence parents and which labels are most impactful.
METHODS: In this study, 2381 demographically and educationally diverse parents participated 
in an online survey. Parents were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 conditions: (1) no warning 
label (control); (2) calorie label; or (3–6) 1 of 4 text versions of a warning label (eg, Safety 
Warning: Drinking beverages with added sugar[s] contributes to obesity, diabetes, and 
tooth decay). Parents chose a beverage for their child in a vending machine choice task, 
rated perceptions of different beverages, and indicated interest in receiving beverage 
coupons.
RESULTS: Regression analyses controlling for frequency of beverage purchases were used 
to compare the no warning label group, calorie label group, and all warning label groups 
combined. Significantly fewer parents chose an SSB for their child in the warning label 
condition (40%) versus the no label (60%) and calorie label conditions (53%). Parents in 
the warning label condition also chose significantly fewer SSB coupons, believed that SSBs 
were less healthy for their child, and were less likely to intend to purchase SSBs. All P values 
<.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons. There were no consistent differences among 
different versions of the warning labels.
CONCLUSIONS: Health warning labels on SSBs improved parents’
 understanding of health 
harms associated with overconsumption of such beverages and may reduce parents’
 
purchase of SSBs for their children.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Research fi
 nds 
that large tobacco text warnings are associated 
with increased risk perceptions of the health harms 
of using tobacco products. Although this suggests 
sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) warning labels 
will help educate consumers, few studies have 
investigated SSB warning labels.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In an online study of 2381 
demographically and educationally diverse parents, 
SSB health warning labels improved parents 
understanding of health harms associated with 
overconsumption of SSBs. The warning labels also 
lowered parents’ intentions to purchase SSBs for 
their children.

ROBERTO et al 
National US surveys have revealed 
that 66% of children 2 to 11 years 
old drink sugar-sweetened beverages 
(SSBs) daily.1 One study estimated 
that these beverages contribute 
69 kcal (calories) and 118 calories 
daily to the diets of children 2 to 5 
and 6 to 11 years old, respectively.2 
Relative to white children ages 2 to 5, 
African American children consume 
almost twice as many calories from 
SSBs.2 Research has linked children’
s 
consumption of SSBs with weight 
gain and risk of obesity in adulthood, 
as well as dental caries.3–5 Further, 
60% of sodas are estimated to 
contain caffeine, a known addictive 
substance.6
Growing concern about the 
health harms associated with SSB 
intake has prompted policies and 
interventions to try to reduce their 
consumption. Most recently, San 
Francisco passed a law (although 
due to an ongoing lawsuit it has not 
yet been implemented) requiring 
SSB advertisements to include a 
conspicuous and legible warning 
label.7 The health warnings would be 
required to take up at least 20% of 
print advertisements on billboards, 
walls, taxis, and buses within city 
limits, but would not apply to 
advertisements in newspapers, on 
broadcast outlets, or on the Internet. 
Legislative bills have also been 
introduced in California and New 
York State, which would require 
SSBs to display health warning labels 
on product containers, much like 
tobacco warning labels.8,9
From a public health perspective, 
the first goal of a warning label is 
to educate consumers about the 
potential health harms of a product. 
In the case of SSBs, such education 
may be particularly needed for 
certain beverages. For example, 
1 study of 982 parents revealed 
that many believed some SSBs, 
including flavored waters and fruit 
and sports drinks, were healthy 
options for children.10 The second 
goal of a warning is to reduce 
consumption by making salient the 
long-term consequences of drinking 
SSBs at moments of purchase and 
consumption.
Research has revealed that 
large tobacco text warnings are 
associated with greater knowledge 
and increased risk perceptions of 
the health harms of using tobacco 
products.11 Although this evidence 
suggests SSB warning labels will help 
educate consumers, there is a lack of 
data on the influence of SSB warning 
labels. Therefore, the current study 
addressed the following research 
questions:
1. Do warning labels educate 
parents’
 about the health harms 
associated with SSB intake above 
and beyond current beverage 
industry standards of placing 
calorie information on beverages?
2. Do warning labels influence 
parents’
 intentions to buy SSBs 
for their children and is this effect 
moderated by education level?
3. Do warning labels influence 
parents’
 perceptions and 
intentions toward nonlabeled 
beverages?
4. Do the effects of warning labels 
differ across different label 
phrasings?
5. What are parents’
 beliefs about 
proposals to put warning labels on 
SSBs?
Overall, we hypothesized that a 
warning label would be more likely 
to increase perceptions of the health 
harms of SSBs and reduce purchase 
intentions for SSBs relative to calorie 
labels or no labels. This research has 
the potential to inform regulatory 
efforts in states and municipalities 
considering SSB warning label 
policies.
METHODS
Participants
We recruited 3136 primary 
caregivers of a child aged 6 to 11 
years old through Survey Sampling 
International (SSI), a firm that 
recruits research participants 
through their online panels and 
other online communities, social 
networks, and Web sites by using 
banner advertisements, SMS and text 
messaging, and telephone alerts. SSI 
uses a 3-stage randomization process 
in matching participants with surveys 
they are likely to be eligible for and 
complete. First, randomly selected 
participants from SSI’
s panels are 
combined with people entering the 
sample who have responded to other 
SSI recruitment advertisements. 
An invitation is sent asking them to 
“take a survey.” To reduce selection 
bias, no specific details of the survey 
are included in the invitation. After 
recruitment, potential participants 
complete proprietary quality control 
questions before inclusion in a 
study sample. Participants are then 
randomly assigned to surveys they 
are likely to be able to take. There 
are also quality controls to ensure 
participants do not take the same 
survey twice. Based on the target 
population being recruited, SSI offers 
a diversity of incentives, including 
cash, points, prizes, sweepstakes, or 
being able to donate to charity. For 
the current study, SSI determined 
whether a 6- to 11-year-old resided 
in the household and then randomly 
selected caregivers in those 
households to participate. The survey 
had to be completed on a computer 
size screen; smart phones or tablets 
were not permitted. Recruitment 
efforts were targeted so that the 
sample reflected the educational 
make-up of the United States on 
the basis of 2010 census data. We 
also oversampled Hispanics and 
African Americans because they 
have the highest obesity prevalence 
in the United States (Table 1).12 Of 
the 3136 participants who started 
the survey, 2492 completed it, and 
2381 accurately answered the data 
integrity check question described 
below; these participants composed 
the final sample.

Label Development and 
Randomization
After agreeing to participate, child 
caregivers were randomly assigned 
to 1 of 6 label conditions. The 
conditions did not significantly differ 
on sociodemographic variables. The 
first condition (No Label Control) 
was a no health warning label control 
group in which participants viewed 
beverages without any label. The 
second condition (Calorie Label) 
displayed a “Calories per Bottle” label 
that appeared on all beverages, not 
just SSBs, which were identical to 
the American Beverage Association’
s 
“Clear on Calories” labels.13 
Conditions 3 to 6 displayed warning 
labels. The first warning label 
condition (California Label) included 
the text proposed in the California 
bill (Safety Warning: Drinking 
beverages with added sugar[s] 
contributes to obesity, diabetes, 
and tooth decay). We then tested 3 
modifications of that text designed 
to make aspects of the warning more 
salient. A scientific advisory board 
and legal team reviewed all labels 
to ensure they accurately reflected 
current scientific evidence and would 
be legally viable.
The second warning label condition 
(Weight Gain Label) modified 
the California label by changing 
“obesity” to “weight gain.” The 
rationale was that obesity might 
seem like a distant problem 
affecting older adults and may 
therefore be less salient to parents 
making decisions for children. 
Because people tend to focus on 
the present rather than the future, 
we hypothesized that the phrase 
“weight gain” would be more 
influential than “obesity.” For the 
third warning label condition 
(Preventable Label), the words 
“preventable diseases like” were 
inserted before “obesity.” We 
hypothesized this would be more 
effective than the California label 
because it makes salient that these 
diseases could be prevented. Finally, 
to respond to concerns that the 
labels are misleading because the 
messaging does not apply to type 
1 diabetes, we tested a fourth label 
condition (Type 2 Diabetes Label) 
that includes the words “type 2” 
before diabetes. See Fig 1 for label 
images. We hypothesized that the 
Type 2 Diabetes Label would not 
differ from the California Label.
Warning Label Criteria
We used the criteria in the proposed 
California legislation to determine 
which beverages qualified for a

warning label. These criteria were as 
follows: any sweetened nonalcoholic 
beverages with added sweeteners 
that contain 75 or more calories per 
12 fluid ounces qualified for a label.8 
Beverages containing 100% natural 
fruit juice or natural vegetable juice 
with no added caloric sweeteners, 
liquid products used as “dietary aid,” 
products used for oral nutritional 
therapy and/or a source of necessary 
nutrition as a result of a medical 
condition, oral electrolyte solutions, 
infant formula, and milk were excluded.
Survey Procedures
This study was approved by the 
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public 
Health Institutional Review Board. 
After providing informed consent, 
caregivers took a 20-minute survey 
(median completion time was 23 
minutes). At the beginning of the 
survey, they were asked if they had 
more than 1 child between the ages 
of 6 and 11 years old, and if so, to 
answer the questions on the basis of 
their youngest child within that age 
range.
Outcomes
Vending Machine Choice
The first task required parents to 
imagine they were looking at a 
vending machine while shopping 
because they wanted to purchase a 
beverage for their child. They were 
asked to scroll down on 1 screen to 
view 20 popular, 20-ounce beverages 
(12 of which were SSBs) presented 
in 2 columns and then select 1. 
Beverages were presented in random 
order. Participants had to view all the 
beverages before they could advance 
to the next question. We included 
beverages with a wide range of added 
sugar content. Participants were told 
to select the beverage brand they 
wanted even if they typically buy a 
different flavor. Those in a warning 
label condition were also told that, 
“drinks with a lot of added sugar have 
a safety warning label on them.” When 
a calorie or warning label appeared 
on a product, it was enlarged and 
displayed above the beverage image 
(Fig 2). Because this is among the first 
studies on SSB warning labels, we 
tested labels under conditions when 
they were highly visible and salient. If 
no effects are detected, there is little 
reason to think warning labels would 
work better in the real world.
Beverage Perceptions and Intentions
After completing the vending 
machine task, participants answered 
questions about 14 of the twenty, 
20-ounce beverages used in the 
vending machine task (9 of which 
were SSBs). After pilot testing the 
survey, we only included a subset 
of beverages from the vending 
machine task so the survey did not 
take too long. Beverages were shown 
in random order displaying labels 
on the basis of study condition (see 
Table 2 for survey questions).

screen to view the same 20 beverages 
in random order that were presented 
in the vending machine task. They 
were asked to indicate all beverages 
they would buy for their child for 
which they would like to receive a 
coupon.
Health and Sociodemographic 
Information
After the coupon task, we asked 
several health-related questions, 
including a question asking 
participants to indicate their 
relationship with their weight. 
Participants also provided 
information about health conditions 
and whether their doctor ever told 
them their child is overweight or 
obese or has type 2 diabetes. Finally, 
participants indicated their age, 
gender, height, weight, number of 
children, ethnicity, race, educational 
level, marital status, household 
income, political party affiliation, and 
the US state or territory they reside in.
Label Recall
As a manipulation check, participants 
were asked whether they saw a 
warning label on any of the beverages 
(choosing among: yes, no, and I don’
t 
know).
Support for Warning Label Policy
At the end of the survey, participants 
were presented with either the 
California warning label if they 
were in the control, calorie label, or 
California condition or a picture of 
the warning label they were assigned 
to for the other conditions (see Table 
2 for survey questions).
Data Integrity Check

week (options ranged from 1–7). 
Those answering incorrectly were 
excluded from the analyses (N = 111).
Statistical Analyses
First, we assessed differences across 
the 4 warning label conditions 
by using logistic regression for 
categorical outcomes and ordinary 
least squares regression for 
continuous outcomes. We regressed 
each dependent variable on label 
condition, controlling for self-
reported frequency of purchasing 
SSBs and beverages that would not 
qualify for a warning label over 
the past month. Controlling for 
past behavior is important because 
people’
s perceptions, beliefs, 
intentions, and behavior are partially 
a product of people’
s past behavior. 
We ran all pairwise comparisons 
by varying which condition was the 
reference group.
We then collapsed across all 
warning label conditions and 
repeated these analyses, running 
all pairwise comparisons to assess 
differences among the No Label 
Control condition, The Calorie 
Label condition and the Warning 
Label condition. For this analysis, 
we examined label effects on both 
SSBs and beverages that would not 
qualify for a warning label to see 
if the labels had spillover effects 
on beverages that did not have a 
warning label.
To determine whether the effects 
of warning labels were similar 
across the education spectrum, 
we regressed each of the outcome 
variables on (1) a dummy variable 
for Warning Label condition, (2) a 
dummy variable for Calorie Label 
condition, (3) mean-centered level 
of education, (4) the interaction 
between the Warning Label 
condition and level of education, 
(5) the interaction between the 
Calorie Label condition and level of 
education, and (6) the self-reported 
average frequency of purchasing 
SSBs and beverages that did not 
qualify for a warning label. For 
each of these 3 sets of analyses, 
we used a P < .05 significance 
threshold and the Bonferroni-Holm 
procedure to correct for multiple 
comparisons.15
RESULTS
Do Different Warning Labels Exert 
Different Effects?
Our first set of analyses explored 
whether the 4 warning label 
conditions exerted different effects 
on the outcome measures. As shown 
in Table 3, the differences were 
minimal. Among the 16 measures 
analyzed, only estimated calories 
differed, whereby those who saw 
the California Label estimated that 
the SSBs contained fewer calories 
than those who saw the Preventable 
Label. However, the California Label 
group performed better, although 
not significantly so, on most other 
measures. These results suggest 
that the label modifications did 
not detectably affect our primary 
outcome measures, and thus are 
unlikely to be consequential. As a 
result, the warning label conditions 
were collapsed for the main analyses, 
described below.
Do Warning Labels Affect Choices, 
Perceptions, and Intentions?
As shown in Table 4, putting warning 
labels on the 9 qualifying SSBs 
exerted powerful effects relative to 
both the No Label and Calorie Label 
conditions. In the vending machine 
choice task, those in the Warning 
Label group were significantly less 
likely than The Calorie Label or No 
Label groups to choose an SSB for 
their child. Calorie labels did not have 
a significant effect compared with the 
control condition.
Second, warning labels led parents to 
believe that SSBs were significantly 
less healthy, less likely to make their 
child feel energized, less likely to 
help their child to focus, and more 
likely to increase their child’
s risk 
of weight gain, heart disease, and 
diabetes relative to both the Calorie 
Label and control groups. Although 
calorie labels significantly increased 
parents’
 estimates of the calorie 
content of SSBs, warning labels did 
so as well, but to a lesser extent. 
Participants in the warning label 
condition judged SSBs to have more 
added sugar, and they indicated they 
were less likely to purchase them for 
their child. Willingness to pay did 
not significantly differ across groups. 
Finally, participants in The Warning 
Label condition chose significantly 
fewer SSB coupons than did those 
in The Calorie Label and No Label 
conditions.
Analyses of beverages that did 
not qualify for a warning label 
(averaged across the 5 beverages 
without warning labels) revealed 
only a few significant effects of 
warning label on disease risk and 
calorie estimation, all of which 
were very small, and possibly 
caused by anchoring on the values 
participants had given for SSBs (see 
Supplemental Table 5). Judgments 
of healthfulness and purchase 
intentions were unaffected.
Do the Effects Vary Across Levels of 
Education?
The Education × Warning Label 
interaction was barely significant 
for only 2 of the 16 outcomes, 
indicating that the warning label 
increased calorie estimates for 
SSBs (P = .02) and perceived 
diabetes risk (P = .05) more for 
those who were less educated. 
Education level did not moderate 
the effect of warning labels on 
other outcomes, including vending 
machine beverage choice (P = .93), 
number of SSB coupons chosen 
(P = .34), SSB purchase intentions 
(P = .32), and perceptions of 
SSB healthfulness (P = .950).

interaction was nonsignificant for 
all outcomes.
Do People Support Warning Label 
Policies?
Most participants reported that a 
warning label would change their 
beliefs about a beverage’
s healthfulness 
(mean = 3.8 ± 1.2 on 5-point scale) and 
that a label would encourage them to 
purchase fewer of the beverages for 
their child (mean = 4.1 ± 1.1 on 5-point 
scale). Second, 73.3% of participants 
were in favor of an SSB warning label 
policy, with only 5.7% opposed (the 
average support was +1.1 ± 1.0 on 
a scale from −2 to +2). This did not 
differ across experimental conditions. 
Although Republicans (72.9%) and 
Independents (66.0%) favored the 
policy less than Democrats (79.2%), 
the policy had strong majority support 
among all 3 parties.
DISCUSSION
The first aim of this study was to 
test whether warning labels can 
effectively educate consumers about 
the health harms associated with SSB 
intake more so than current industry 
practices of printing calorie labels 
on beverages. The study also aimed 
to evaluate how warning labels 
influence parents’
 intentions to buy 
SSBs, as well as beverages that would 
not qualify for a label, whether these 
effects were moderated by education 
level, and whether the different 
label phrasings would be more or 
less effective. Finally, we assessed 
support for SSB warning labels.
We found that SSB warning labels 
may be an important way to educate 
parents about the health harms 
of SSBs and encourage them to 
purchase fewer of these beverages. 
Warning labels reduced parents’
 
perceptions that SSBs are healthy 
beverages and that SSBs can increase 
their child’
s energy or ability to 
focus. We also found that the labels 
increased parents’
 perceptions 
of the child’
s risk of weight gain, 
heart disease, and diabetes from 
consuming SSBs. As predicted, calorie 
labels increased parents’
 ability to 
estimate the calories in SSBs as did 
warning labels, but to a lesser extent. 
However, warning labels led parents 
to judge SSBs to have more added 
sugar. Analyses of beverages that 
did not quality for a warning label 
suggested that SSB warning labels 
are unlikely to have spillover effects, 
either positively or negatively, on 
judgments of nonlabeled drinks.
Three outcomes measured in this 
study indicated that warning labels 
may influence behavior. When

Within each row, percentages or means with different subscripts differ at P < .05 (after correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni-Holm procedure; Holm15). After applying 
this correction, the only statistically signifi
 cant P value in this table is the comparison between the California and preventable labels for estimated calories (P = .001). Statistical tests were 
regressions controlling for the self-reported frequency of purchasing SSB and non-labeled beverages. Analyses of “estimated calories” were conducted on log-transformed estimates (ie, 
log10[Calories+1]); the table converts the log means and SEs into calories (ie, using 10log to calculate the mean).

hypothetical purchasing decision 
for their child, caregivers who saw 
SSBs with warning labels were 
significantly less likely to choose 
an SSB relative to those who saw 
calorie or no labels on beverages. 
When parents’
 were asked to select 
beverages for which they would 
want to receive coupons, those 
who saw warning labels chose 
significantly fewer coupons for 
SSBs than the control and calorie 
label conditions. Finally, warning 
labels led parents to report being 
less likely to purchase SSBs for their 
child in the future. These results 
suggest that when noticed, warning 
labels may encourage parents’
 
to purchase healthier beverages 
for their children, while current 
efforts to place calories per bottle 
information may have little influence. 
However, research examining SSB 
purchases among low-income 
adolescents revealed that brightly 
colored signs displaying calorie-
related information was associated 
with a decrease in purchases of these 
beverages over 6 months,16 but we 
do not know whether such decreases 
would be more dramatic if the signs 
had included warning labels.
The influence of warning labels on 
the vast majority of outcomes did 
not vary based on education level, 
suggesting they may be helpful 
for people across the education 
spectrum. However, the impact 
of more traditional nutrition 
labeling strategies tends to vary 
based on demographic subgroups. 
For example, research on posting 
calorie information on restaurant 
menus finds that those who are 
more educated or have higher 
incomes are more likely to use the 
information when make purchasing 
decisions.17,18 Although we are not 
seeing meaningful differences in this 
study on the basis of education level, 
our results might be unique to lower 
education populations in online 
samples.
Contrary to our hypotheses, we did 
not find that modified label phrasings 
differentially impacted the outcomes 
of interest. This provides support for 
keeping the proposed California text 
in future bills, but future research 
should continue to explore whether 
other types of label phrasings 
can increase the influence of text 
warnings and whether different 
phrasings resonate with different 
populations (eg, parents versus 
teenagers).
Finally, participants strongly 
believed labels would help change 
their beliefs about a beverages’

healthfulness and would encourage 
them to purchase fewer SSBs for 
their children. The majority of 
respondents favored a policy to 
place warning labels on SSBs and 
although there were differences 
across political parties, the policy had 
strong majority support among all 3 
parties, suggesting that SSB warning 
label proposals are unlikely to be met 
with strong constituent opposition. 
Labeling strategies typically garner 
more public support than more 
controversial food policies such as 
taxing SSBs or limiting their portion 
size.19
This study has several limitations. 
First, we studied the influence of 
warning labels via an online survey, 
not in the real world. However, given 
that such SSB labels do not exist in 
the real world, this is 1 of the first 
studies to look at the potential effect 
of such a policy. In addition, tobacco 
research suggests that labels are 
most likely to influence consumers if 
they are visible and salient, whereas 
more obscure text warning are less 
likely to have an impact.11 Therefore, 
we wanted to study warning labels 
under conditions where they 
are highly visible and salient to 
understand how they may impact 
consumers who see them. This means 
the study may have overestimated 
the effect of the warning label, but 
if we had found no effect, it would 
suggest that such labels would not 
be influential in real-world settings. 
The survey is also limited because of 
potential desirability bias. Consumers 
may be inclined to indicate they 
would not want to purchase an 
SSB because it is the desirable 
answer. However, consumers were 
completing the survey online and 
anonymously, likely reducing the 
desire to please the researcher. In 
addition, if there was a strong social 
desirability bias, we would expect to 
also see strong effects from exposure 
to salient calorie labels, but this did 
not happen. Although we have a large 
racially and ethnically diverse sample 
and we recruited so that our sample 
reflects the educational make-up of 
the United States, this does not mean 
we have a nationally representative 
sample. Therefore, these results may 
not generalize to other populations. 
In addition, we do not know how 
our study sample differs from those 
who opted not to take the survey. 
This study is also limited to parents 
making purchasing decisions for their 
children. Future research should 
assess the influence of warning labels 
on adults and adolescents. Finally, we 
tested the warning label guidelines 
on the basis of the California law so 
that the study could inform current 
policy debates. However, other laws 
might seek to include 100% fruit 
juices in labeling requirements, 
making it important to understand 
how warning labels would affect 
perceptions of those beverages.
This study has a number of 
strengths, including a large sample 
size, a randomized-controlled 
design with both a no label control 
group and a calorie label group, and 
a sample that included a range of 
education levels, as well as a large 
proportion of racial and ethnic 
minority participants. This study 
is among the first to examine the 
potential influence of SSB warning 
labels and provides timely data 
on the potential for such labels to 
educate consumers and reduce SSB 
intake. Although this study provides 
preliminary support for placing 
warning labels on SSBs, more 
research is needed to understand 
how they would influence a range of 
consumers and whether they would 
impact overall dietary choices. For 
example, 1 concern is that warning 
labels on SSBs would be ineffective 
at reducing overconsumption of 
calories and sugar because people 
would simply compensate by buying 
other high sugar foods that are 
unlabeled.
CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that SSB 
warning labels are likely to reduce 
parents’
 perceptions of SSBs’
 
healthfulness, increase perceptions 
of the health risks posed by SSBs, 
and decrease parents’
 likelihood of 
buying SSBs for their children.
