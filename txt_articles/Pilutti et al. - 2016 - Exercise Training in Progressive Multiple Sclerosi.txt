Background: There is evidence of the benefits of exercise training in multiple sclerosis (MS); however, few 
studies have been conducted in individuals with progressive MS and severe mobility impairment. A poten-
tial exercise rehabilitation approach is total-body recumbent stepper training (TBRST). We evaluated the 
safety and participant-reported experience of TBRST in people with progressive MS and compared the effi-
cacy of TBRST with that of body weight–supported treadmill training (BWSTT) on outcomes of function, 
fatigue, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
Methods: Twelve participants with progressive MS (Expanded Disability Status Scale scores, 6.0–8.0) were 
randomized to receive TBRST or BWSTT. Participants completed three weekly sessions (30 minutes) of 
exercise training for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes included safety assessed as adverse events and patient-
reported exercise experience assessed as postexercise response and evaluation of exercise equipment. Second-
ary outcomes included the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, 
and the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life–54 questionnaire scores. Assessments were conducted at baseline 
and after 12 weeks.
Results: Safety was confirmed in both exercise groups. Participants reported enjoying both exercise modali-
ties; however, TBRST was reviewed more favorably. Both interventions reduced fatigue and improved 
HRQOL (P ≤ .05); there were no changes in function.
Conclusions: Both TBRST and BWSTT seem to be safe, well tolerated, and enjoyable for participants 
with progressive MS with severe disability. Both interventions may also be efficacious for reducing fatigue 
and improving HRQOL. TBRST should be further explored as an exercise rehabilitation tool for patients 
with progressive MS. Int J MS Care. 2016;18:221–229.
T
here is evidence of the benefits of exercise train-
ing for people with multiple sclerosis (MS).1-3 
These benefits, however, have primarily been 
established in populations with mild-to-moderate dis-
ease severity and a relapsing-remitting disease course.1-3 
People with progressive MS with severe mobility impair-
ment have limited opportunities to engage in exercise 
training because most traditional modalities are physi-
cally inaccessible. An alternative exercise modality that 
has been used for participants with mobility impairment 
is body weight–supported treadmill training (BWSTT),4 
which allows an individual with reduced mobility to 
walk on a treadmill while being partially supported by 
an overhead pulley system. Supported treadmill walk-
ing has been examined in people with advanced MS and 
has been found to be safe and well tolerated, with pre-
liminary results suggesting improvements in mobility, 
fatigue, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).5-10 
Although BWSTT may have benefits for participants 
with limited mobility, this type of intervention is rarely 
available in community settings, requires highly trained 
personnel to operate, and is costly to initiate and main-
tain.4 Furthermore, improvements gained from BWSTT

disability that could interfere with the evaluation of dis-
ability due to MS; 4) other serious medical conditions 
that might impair the ability to walk on a treadmill or 
participate in exercise training; and 5) previous experi-
ence with BWSTT or TBRST.
Outcome Measures
Disability
Neurologic status was assessed through a clinically 
administered EDSS14 performed by a neurologist (CD). 
Scores on the EDSS were used to characterize the dis-
ability level of the sample and to monitor stability of 
neurologic function over the 12-week period.
Safety
Participants were asked to report on any adverse 
events (eg, muscle and joint pain, physical discomfort, 
and excessive fatigue) experienced during or after each 
training session.
Participant Experience of Exercise Training
Participants completed a questionnaire evaluating the 
physical and psychological postexercise response, enjoy-
ment of equipment, equipment accessibility and safety, 
perceived benefit to daily functioning, and recom-
mendation and use of the exercise equipment. Affective 
response to exercise was assessed using the single-item 
Feeling Scale,15 whereby participants indicated how they 
felt immediately after exercise on an 11-point scale rang-
ing from −5 (very bad) to 5 (very good). Feeling states 
after exercise were evaluated using the 12-item Exercise-
Induced Feeling Inventory,16 which is composed of four 
subscales (revitalization, tranquility, positive engage-
ment, and physical exhaustion), each assessed by three 
items. Participants specified the extent to which each 
item described how they felt after exercise on a scale 
from 0 (do not feel) to 4 (feel very strongly). A mean 
score was generated for each subscale. Pain was evaluated 
using a three-item scale developed from the Brief Pain 
Inventory.17 Participants responded to, “When using the 
exercise equipment, how much ______ did you experi-
ence,” inserting each of the following three items: shoul-
der pain, bodily pain, and physical discomfort. Items 
were scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (not at 
all) to 7 (a lot), and a mean score for the three items was 
generated. The Feeling Scale, Exercise-Induced Feeling 
Inventory, and Brief Pain Inventory have demonstrated 
good sensitivity and sound psychometric properties.18,19
Participant enjoyment of the training modality was 
assessed using a single item rating how much partici-
pants liked using the equipment on a scale from 1 (not 
might deteriorate once training is discontinued; there-
fore, developing long-term, feasible, and accessible exer-
cise for people with advanced MS is critical.
An alternative adapted exercise modality to BWSTT 
is total-body recumbent stepper training (TBRST), a 
recumbent cross-trainer that provides participants with 
mobility impairment the opportunity to participate 
in full-body exercise in a safe and physically accessible 
manner.4 Using TBRST, participants can exercise with 
both the upper and lower extremities through the use of 
coupled arm levers and foot pedals. Despite the potential 
of TBRST as an exercise rehabilitation tool, few studies 
have evaluated TBRST. Compared with nonexercis-
ing controls, 12 weeks of TBRST improved aerobic 
capacity, upper- and lower-body muscular strength and 
endurance, and body composition in sedentary healthy 
adults.11 Walking speed, muscular strength, and blood 
pressure improved after 13 weeks of TBRST (>9 min/
wk) in a group of elderly individuals in an assisted-living 
community.12 An improvement in balance and impair-
ment was observed after 8 weeks of TBRST in a study of 
participants more than 1 year post-stroke.13 To date, no 
studies have examined TBRST in people with MS.
In an attempt to address the limitations of previous 
research, the primary goal of this trial was to deter-
mine the safety and participant-reported experience 
of TBRST in people with progressive MS with severe 
mobility impairment (Expanded Disability Status Scale 
[EDSS] scores, 6.0–8.0). The secondary aim was to 
determine the efficacy of TBRST compared with that 
of BWSTT on outcomes of functional ability, fatigue, 
and HRQOL. If TBRST is safe, well tolerated, and 
beneficial for people with advanced MS, this represents a 
potential long-term rehabilitation solution.

Exercise Training in Progressive MS
Physical subscale scores range from 0 to 36, cognitive 
subscale scores range from 0 to 40, and psychosocial 
subscale scores range from 0 to 8. Higher total and sub-
scale scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue. The reli-
ability and validity of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale 
have been established.22
Health-Related Quality of Life
HRQOL was assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis 
Quality of Life–54 questionnaire, which consists of 12 
multi-item scales, 2 single-item scales, and 2 composite 
scores (physical and mental health).24 The individual 
scales and composite scores range from 0 to 100, where 
higher scores indicate better quality of life. This ques-
tionnaire has shown good reliability and validity.25
Interventions
TBRST
Participants completed the TBRST protocol using 
the NuStep T4/TRS 4000 (NuStep Inc, Ann Arbor, 
MI), which is a recumbent cross-trainer that allows for 
upper- and lower-body exercise in a seated position. A 
photograph and detailed description of the recumbent 
stepper setup is published elsewhere.4 The recumbent 
stepper allows participants to achieve a natural step-
ping motion against graded loads created by a magnetic 
resistance system. Arm levers and foot pedals are coupled 
and move in a bilateral reciprocal manner. Foot straps 
and leg stabilizers were used for added control and prop-
er leg alignment when necessary. One trainer assisted 
participants with transferring and equipment setup as 
required.
BWSTT
Participants underwent BWSTT using the Woodway 
Loko system (Woodway USA Inc, Wakesha, WI), which 
consists of a treadmill with an overhead pulley system 
connected to a supportive harness. A photograph and 
description of BWSTT has previously been published.4 
The BWSTT allows participants with limited mobility 
to walk upright on a treadmill with a portion of their 
body weight counterbalanced. The BWSTT protocol 
was based on previous trials conducted by our research 
group in people with spinal cord injury and is appropri-
ate for use in advanced MS.26,27 Following these param-
eters, the percentage of body weight supported was 
prescribed on an individual basis. Treadmill training was 
therapist assisted, with one trainer positioned at either 
lower limb to promote proper gait mechanics. When 
necessary, an additional trainer stood behind the partici-
pant to assist with weight shifting and trunk stability.
at all) to 7 (a lot). The accessibility and safety of the 
equipment were each evaluated by single items assess-
ing how confident the participant was in using the 
exercise equipment without assistance (accessibility) and 
without causing injury (safety). Both items were rated 
on a 7-point scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 7 
(completely confident). Perceived benefit of the equip-
ment to improve daily functioning was assessed using 
a single item rating how useful participants believed 
the equipment was in improving fitness to help per-
form activities of daily living. Perceived benefit to daily 
functioning was rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 
(very much). Recommendation and use of equipment 
was assessed with three single-item scales. Participants 
indicated whether they would recommend that fitness 
facilities purchase the exercise equipment on a scale from 
1 (definitely not) to 7 (definitely yes). Participants indi-
cated their anticipated use of the equipment if it were 
made available at an exercise facility they attended on a 
scale from 1 (never) to 7 (always). Finally, participants 
specified the amount of time (<5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 
30 minutes or other) they imagined themselves using 
the exercise equipment (TBRST or BWSTT), assuming 
high motivation and fitness, in one exercise session with-
out stopping.
Functional Ability
Functional ability was assessed using the Multiple 
Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC).20 The MSFC 
assesses lower-extremity, upper-extremity, and cogni-
tive functioning using three scales: the Timed 25-Foot 
Walk test, the Nine-Hole Peg Test, and the Paced 
Auditory Serial Addition Test, respectively. Pre-baseline 
administration of the MSFC was conducted to minimize 
practice effects.21 The MSFC was scored according to 
standardized instruction.20 Z scores were calculated for 
each MSFC item by standardizing or comparing the test 
values with a reference population using mean baseline 
values from the overall study sample as the reference 
population. A composite Z score was then calculated as a 
mean Z score for the three individual scales. Z scores are 
expressed in units of standard deviation.
Fatigue
Fatigue was assessed using the 21-item Modified 
Fatigue Impact Scale,22,23 which assesses overall fatigue 
as well as physical, cognitive, and psychosocial fatigue. 
Each item assesses the impact of fatigue on daily activi-
ties and functioning and is scored from 0 (never) to 
4 (always). The total score is computed by summing 
the responses on all 21 items and ranges from 0 to 84.

vs. BWSTT) as the between-subjects factor. Data that 
were not normally distributed were square root trans-
formed. The ESs were used to evaluate the magnitude 
of change in outcome measures in each exercise inter-
vention. The ESs have been used in previous physical 
activity and exercise training interventions in people 
with MS to express the magnitude of differences within 
and between groups after the interventions.5,29-32 The 
ESs were interpreted as small, moderate, and large based 
on criteria of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively.33 Statistical 
significance was set at P ≤ .05.
Results
Participants
Twelve participants were enrolled in this study: six 
in the TBRST group (median [interquartile range] 
EDSS score, 7.0 [1.625]) and six in the BWSTT group 
(median [interquartile range] EDSS score, 6.75 [1.625]). 
Each group included three men and three women, two 
with primary progressive MS and four with secondary 
progressive MS. One participant dropped out of the 
BWSTT group after 17 training sessions. One partici-
pant in the TBRST group acquired an injury unrelated 
to exercise training after 34 sessions. Five participants in 
each group completed the intervention and follow-up 
(ie, 12-week) testing. Characteristics of the participants 
who completed the intervention are presented in Table 
1. There were no differences between groups in baseline 
characteristics (all P > .05) except for age. Participants 
in the TBRST group were significantly older than those 
in the BWSTT group (P = .002); accordingly, age was 
used as a covariate in comparisons of intervention effects 
between groups. Overall, EDSS scores remained stable 
in both groups throughout the intervention (P < .05); 
Procedures
All the procedures were approved by a research ethics 
board, and participants provided written informed con-
sent. After enrollment, participants underwent a neu-
rologic examination and completed functional, fatigue, 
and HRQOL measures. Due to the heterogeneity of 
the population and small sample, we did not attempt a 
matched design but rather randomized participants who 
met the inclusion criteria to receive one of two exercise 
interventions: TBRST or BWSTT. Randomization was 
conducted after baseline assessment and was determined 
by a computer-generated randomization program. After 
group assignment, participants completed three weekly 
sessions of BWSTT or TBRST for 12 weeks. Partici-
pants completed a pre-training familiarization session. 
The duration of each session was gradually increased 
according to participant ability and comfort up to a 
maximum of 30 minutes. To ensure that the intensity of 
exercise was similar between groups, rating of perceived 
exertion (RPE) was used as an indicator of effort using 
the Borg CR10 scale.28 Throughout the training pro-
gram, participants were instructed to exercise at a per-
ceived exertion of 3 to 5, which corresponded to a rating 
of moderate to strong on the 10-point scale. Exercise 
training heart rate was recorded (Polar Electro Oy, Kem-
pele, Finland) at each training session. Safety (ie, adverse 
events) was evaluated at each training session. Exercise 
progression in both groups was based on perceived exer-
tion, comfort, and participant progress. After comple-
tion of the training program, participants completed all 
of the same measures as at baseline and the experience of 
exercise training questionnaire.
Data Analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics of par-
ticipants were summarized using descriptive statistics. 
Values are presented in the text as mean (SD), unless 
otherwise noted. Baseline characteristics were compared 
between groups using independent-samples t tests and 
χ2 tests. Differences between groups in exercise adher-
ence were determined using independent-samples t tests 
and Mann-Whitney tests. Adverse events were sum-
marized for each training group. Participant evaluations 
of exercise training data were compared between groups 
using independent-samples t tests and Mann-Whitney 
tests. Effect sizes (ESs), expressed as Cohen’s d, were 
used to compare differences in the evaluation of exercise 
training between groups. Between-group comparisons of 
exercise training parameters, functional ability, fatigue, 
and HRQOL were analyzed using a series of mixed-
model analyses of variance, with time (baseline vs. 12

and ranged from 62.8 (4.8) to 68.2 (9.8) steps/min (P 
= .20). Participants in the BWSTT group significantly 
reduced the amount of body weight support required to 
walk on the treadmill from 72.2% (19.6%) at baseline 
to 43.1% (18.1%) at 12 weeks (P < .001) (Figure 1B). 
Treadmill walking distance increased significantly from 
0.4 (0.2) km at baseline to 0.8 (0.3) km at 12 weeks 
(P < .001). Treadmill walking speed also increased sig-
nificantly over the 12 weeks, from 0.9 (0.3) to 1.6 (0.6) 
km/hour (P = .001).
Exercise Intensity
Overall, mean weekly RPE ranged from 3.8 to 4.6 in 
the TBRST group and from 2.8 to 4.5 in the BWSTT 
group across the 12-week intervention. There was no 
significant difference in perceived exertion between 
groups (P = .63), and RPE did not change during the 12 
weeks (P = .12) (Figure 2A). The difference in average 
only one individual in the TBRST group had a change 
in EDSS score, which increased by 0.5 at 12 weeks.
Exercise Training
Training Adherence
Participants in the TBRST group completed 33.2 
(3.8) of a possible 36 training sessions with adherence 
of 89.1% (6.6%). Participants in the BWSTT group 
completed 35.6 (0.9) training sessions with adherence of 
89.2% (10.4%). Adherence was defined as the percent-
age of available sessions attended. There was no signifi-
cant difference between groups in program adherence.
Training Parameters
Participants in the TBRST group significantly 
increased mean training workload over the duration of 
the intervention from level 2.4 (1.2) to 4.9 (1.4) (P < 
.001) (Figure 1A). There was a nonsignificant increase 
in total steps per training session from 1753.1 (121.6) at 
baseline to 2043.4 (268.5) at 12 weeks (P = .13). Step-
ping cadence was consistent across the training program

the Feeling Scale; the TBRST group reported feeling 
better after exercise training than the BWSTT group. 
Moderate-to-large ESs were observed for equipment 
enjoyment, accessibility, safety, recommendation of 
equipment purchase by fitness facilities, and anticipated 
use of the equipment by participants in a fitness facility, 
all in favor of TBRST over BWSTT.
Functional Ability
There were no significant effects on functional ability 
measures (all P > .05), and ESs further reflect a lack of 
change in MSFC scores (Table 3).
Fatigue
There was a significant effect of time on physical 
(P = .04) and psychosocial (P = .01) fatigue subscales; 
overall, participants perceived less fatigue after exercise 
training (Table 3). There were no significant effects of 
the intervention on the total or cognitive fatigue scores 
(all P > .05). There was a large effect of TBRST on total 
and physical fatigue, and a moderate effect on cognitive 
fatigue. With respect to BWSTT, there was a large effect 
for training on total and all fatigue subscales. This find-
ing suggests that TBRST and BWSTT are efficacious for 
reducing fatigue in people with advanced MS.
Health-Related Quality of Life
There were no significant intervention effects on 
HRQOL outcomes (all P > .05) (Table 3). There 
was a moderate positive effect for TBRST on mental 
HRQOL, and a small positive effect of TBRST on 
physical HRQOL. There was a large positive effect of 
BWSTT on mental HRQOL and a moderate-to-large 
positive effect of BWSTT on physical HRQOL. Over-
all, both TBRST and BWSTT might be efficacious 
for improving physical and, to a greater extent, mental 
HRQOL in people with advanced MS. Considering 
the potentially positive impact of the interventions on 
HRQOL, we collapsed the effect of exercise training 
(ie, the TBRST and BWSTT groups combined) on 
HRQOL and calculated an overall effect for the physical 
(d = .56) and mental (d = .66) health composite scores. 
Using these values, we determined that a minimum 
overall sample of 22 (mental) to 28 (physical) partici-
pants would be necessary to detect a condition × time 
interaction (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.50, α 
= .05, β = .20, ε = 1.0) of adapted exercise training on 
HRQOL in patients with severe progressive MS.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first trial to evaluate the 
efficacy of recumbent stepper training in participants 
training heart rate (HR) between the exercise modalities 
was compared relatively as a percentage of age-predicted 
maximum HR (ie, 220 – age). Average training HR 
expressed as a percentage of age-predicted maximum was 
stable across the interventions over time (P = .31); how-
ever, significantly higher training HRs were recorded in 
the TBRST group compared with the BWSTT group (P 
= .01) (Figure 2B).
Outcomes
Safety
Adverse events in either group occurred rarely and 
were mild in severity. Adverse events (physical discom-
fort, muscle pain, and excessive fatigue) were reported by 
one of the five participants (on two separate occasions) 
in the TBRST group. Adverse events (physical discom-
fort, minor bruising, joint pain, and excessive fatigue) 
were reported by four of the five participants (on five 
separate occasions) in the BWSTT group.
Participant Experience of Exercise Training
There were no significant differences between groups 
in participant experience of exercise training (all P > 
.05) (Table 2). Based on ESs, TBRST was more favor-
ably rated by participants than was BWSTT. A large ES 
was determined for the difference between groups on

Exercise Training in Progressive MS
of the recumbent stepper, compared with the supported 
treadmill, made it more safe, easy, and enjoyable to 
use. This suggests that TBRST is a safe, well-tolerated, 
and enjoyable form of exercise training for people with 
advanced MS and represents an important first step in 
evaluating the potential of TBRST as an adapted reha-
bilitation tool in this population.
Interestingly, participants with progressive MS were 
able to achieve higher training HRs while engaging in 
recumbent stepping compared with BWSTT despite a 
similar perception of effort (ie, RPE). Other research-
ers have compared the cardiorespiratory responses of six 
women with MS with gait impairment (mean EDSS 
score, 4.6) using multiple exercise modalities (ie, tread-
mill walking, leg cycling, combined arm and leg cycling, 
and TBRST).35 Similar to the present findings, peak 
HR and peak oxygen consumption were higher with 
recumbent stepping compared with treadmill exercise. 
In the present study, recumbent stepping likely provided 
a greater cardiovascular challenge by engaging a larger 
muscle mass through the combined use of upper- and 
lower-body exercise. Furthermore, a 12-week TBRST 
intervention was found to significantly improve maximal 
oxygen consumption assessed by recumbent stepping 
and treadmill testing protocols in healthy sedentary 
adults compared with nonexercising controls.11 Future 
trials should examine the effect of TBRST and BWSTT 
on cardiorespiratory fitness to determine whether 
TBRST is superior to BWSTT in people with MS. This 
would have important implications for improving physi-
with MS and to compare recumbent stepper training 
with supported treadmill walking. Overall, we deter-
mined that TBRST is a safe and well-tolerated exercise 
training modality for people with progressive MS with 
severe mobility impairment. Second, TBRST and 
BWSTT are both beneficial for improving fatigue and 
HRQOL in this population. The results of this pre-
liminary study suggest that TBRST is a feasible exercise 
training modality for people with MS with severe mobil-
ity impairment.
Importantly, TBRST was well tolerated, with few 
adverse events reported by participants. In both groups, 
most adverse events occurred early in the training pro-
gram, when participants were likely adjusting to the 
increase in activity and the specialized exercise equip-
ment. When adverse events were reported, participants 
were often unsure whether the symptoms were directly 
related to exercise participation or were due to other 
health issues. Adverse events were reported by more 
participants in the BWSTT group, likely due to the 
specialized equipment, particularly the supportive har-
ness, causing minor discomfort and pain. With respect 
to participant experience of exercise training, there was 
no difference in participants’ evaluation of the two train-
ing modalities. The ESs of the difference between groups 
reflected a more favorable experience of recumbent step-
per training. A preference for recumbent stepper training 
over traditional aerobic exercise modalities was similarly 
reported by a group of elderly individuals.34 It is likely 
that participants felt that the accessibility and simplicity

and promising.
Conclusion
This is the first trial to examine the effects of TBRST 
in participants with advanced MS. Findings from this 
preliminary investigation suggest that TBRST is safe 
and well tolerated by people with progressive MS with 
severe disability. The experience of TBRST was reviewed 
more favorably by participants than the experience of 
BWSTT. TBRST is similarly efficacious as BWSTT for 
improving the outcomes of fatigue and HRQOL. Inter-
estingly, TBRST was a more challenging cardiovascular 
training modality than BWSTT. Overall, TBRST rep-
resents a viable, cost-effective alternative to BWSTT and 
should be considered as an exercise rehabilitation modal-
ity for participants with advanced MS. o

Regarding secondary outcomes, both TBRST and 
BWSTT improved fatigue and HRQOL. These results 
are consistent with previous studies that have reported 
improvements in fatigue and HRQOL in MS after par-
ticipation in exercise training in general and BWSTT 
specifically.8,9,36 We further extend previous results by 
demonstrating improvements in these outcomes in 
response to TBRST. These initial findings are promis-
ing and should be replicated in a large-scale randomized 
controlled trial design. We did not observe an improve-
ment in functional outcomes in this study. Similarly, 
previous work by our research group did not determine 
significant changes in functional outcomes after 12 
weeks of BWSTT in participants with progressive MS 
with severe disability; however, there was a small positive 
effect on MSFC scores.9 Previous research also supports 
the beneficial effects of BWSTT for improving mobil-
ity in participants with MS.5-7 A factor that may have 
contributed to inconsistency in results is the high level 
of neurologic impairment of participants in the present 
study compared with previous trials. Of note, we did not 
observe a decline in function over 12 weeks in this study. 
We did not include a nonexercise condition and, there-
fore, cannot assume that a group receiving no treatment 
would not have deteriorated in function over the same 
period.
Limitations
The results of this study are primarily limited by the 
small sample of participants, the heterogeneity of the 
sample, and the short duration of the training interven-
tion. The use of RPE is limited as an indirect measure 
of exercise intensity, although this method has been 
validated in previous studies in patients with spinal cord 
injury.37 Given that there are so few studies of exercise 
interventions in people with MS with such high disabil-
PracticePoints
• Little is known about the benefits of exercise 
training in patients with progressive MS.
• We examined 12 weeks of recumbent stepper 
training in patients with progressive MS with 
severe disability.
• In patients with progressive MS, recumbent step-
per training was safe and enjoyable, reduced 
fatigue, and improved quality of life.
