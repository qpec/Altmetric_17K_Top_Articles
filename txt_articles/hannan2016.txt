Abstract
Background: We report the outcome of a phase I/II clinical trial of stereotactic
body radiation therapy (SBRT) for low (LR) and select intermediate risk (IR) prostate cancer
(PCa) patients.
Patients and methods: Eligible patients included men with prostate adenocarcinoma with
Gleason score 6 with PSA � 20 or Gleason 7 with PSA � 15 and clinical stage � T2b. For
the phase I portion of the study patients in cohorts of 15 received 45, 47.5, or 50 Gray
(Gy) in five fractions. Since the maximally tolerated dose was not met in the phase I study,
an additional 47 patients received 50 Gy in five fractions in the phase II study. Toxicity using
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v. 3.0, quality of life, and outcome data was
collected.
Results: A total of 91 patients are included for analysis; 63.7% had NCCN IR and 36.3% had

 LR PCa. At a median follow up of 54 months the actuarial freedom from biochemical failure
was 100% at 3 years and 98.6% at 5 years. Actuarial distant metastasis free survival was 100%
at 3 and 5 years. Overall survival was 94% at 3 years and 89.7% at 5 years with no deaths
attributed to PCa. Acute and late urinary grade � III toxicity occurred in 0% and 5.5% of pa-
tients, respectively. Gastrointestinal (GI) acute and late toxicity of grade � III occurred in 2%
and 7% of patients, respectively. A total of four men experienced grade IV toxicity (three GI,
one genitourinary).
Conclusion: SBRT treatment results in excellent biochemical control rates at 5 years for LR
and IR PCa patients although doses greater than 47.5 Gy in five fractions led to increased se-
vere late toxicity.

1. Introduction
Radiation therapy for organ-confined prostate cancer
(PCa) involves protracted courses of external beam ra-
diation delivered over multiple weeks daily. Several
groups have attempted to reduce the course of treatment
through
hypofractionation.
Lloyd-Davies
and
col-
leagues reported 22-year results with acceptable toxicity
[1], although the study was performed in the pre-pros-
tate specific antigen (PSA) and pre-computed tomogra-
phy (CT) scan era, and many patients had high-risk
features. Recent hypofractionation studies have used
stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) treatments ranging
from 33.5 Gy to 36.25 Gy in five fractions [2,3]. These
studies reported acceptable toxicity with limited follow
up. Dose selection for these studies was based on a
mathematical model, the linear-quadratic equation,
which correlates in vitro cellular events to biologic out-
comes using two major parameters, ‘alpha’ and ‘beta.’
More recently, however, it has been shown the true
alpha and beta of PCa is lower than previously thought
[4e6]. Several studies have suggested a benefit of
hypofractionation in the treatment of PCa [4]. More-
over, the linear-quadratic equation may overestimate
the biological effects of highly hypofractionated regi-
mens, and doses of 33.5e36.25 maybe inadequate for
PCa [7,8]. Therefore, a traditional dose escalation trial
was designed to determine the maximally tolerated dose
(MTD) of SBRT in this setting.
Our group initially explored the rationale for SBRT
in animal models, showing dose responses in clinically
relevant ranges [9]. Considering previous brachytherapy
trials indicating acceptable toxicity with doses as high as
9.5 Gy per fraction in four fractions [10,11], we initiated
a multi-centre prospective phase I/II clinical trial of dose
escalated SBRT for National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) low (LR) and intermediate risk (IR)
PCa using 45 Gy in five fractions. We determined and
evaluated the MTD of SBRT for PCa treatment. We
have previously reported a phase I dose escalation
toxicity study [12] and, more recently discussed rectal
SBRT dose constraints [13]. The current article reports
our 5-year PCa control study and an update on toxicity
outcomes.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Patients and eligibility
Patients were enrolled on a multi-institutional institu-
tional review board approved phase I/II dose escalation
trial between 2006 and 2011. The phase I study was open
to three sites, while two additional sites were later added
to phase II. Inclusion criteria were previously reported,
although immunosuppressed patients were excluded
from the phase II study [12]. Hormonal therapy
(androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]) was allowed for
up to 9 months prior to SBRT to downsize the prostate
gland, concurrent ADT was not allowed. CT or mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to ensure
absence of regional metastases.
2.2. Treatment planning and delivery
Treatment planning, dose constraints, simulation, setup,
and treatment delivery parameters were previously re-
ported [12,13]. Briefly, the prostate was expanded uni-
formly by 3 mm to create the planning target volume
(PTV). The dose was prescribed to cover � 95% of the
PTV. Tissue heterogeneity correction was used in all cases.
The anterior wall was allowed to receive no more
than 105% of the prescription dose. No more than 3 cm3
of the lateral walls were allowed to receive 90% of the
prescription dose. The posterior rectal wall maximum
dose was limited to � 45% of the prescription dose. The
bladder wall (outer 5 mm of the entire bladder contour)
was limited to 105% of the prescription dose with no
more than 10 cm3 receiving 18.3 Gy or greater. The
maximum prostatic urethra dose was limited to � 105%
of the prescription dose. Patients were instructed take
4 mg of dexamethasone prior to each treatment and a-

 blocker (i.e. tamsulosin) was given for 6 weeks at the
start of treatment.
2.3. Toxicity assessments
Toxicity was defined using the National Cancer Insti-
tute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v.
3.0. Acute and delayed toxicities were defined before
trial activation as follows: 1) toxicity occurring less
than 270 d from treatment and 2) persistent or new
toxicities greater than or equal to 270 d after treatment,
respectively. American Urological Association Symp-
tom Score (AUASS) and Expanded Prostate Cancer
Index Composite (EPIC) bowel, urinary, hormonal,
and sexual scores were measured at each follow up and
documented for a total of 18 months after treatment,
through quality of life (QOL) questionnaires. After
18 months, urinary function, rectal function, and sex-
ual
function
data
were
documented
without
questionnaires.
2.4. Study end-points
The design and end-points of the phase I study were
previously reported [12]. The primary end-point of the
phase II study was to determine late gastrointestinal
(GI)/genitourinary (GU) treatment side-effects, while
secondary end-points included biochemical control,
disease specific survival, and overall survival (OS). Since
the MTD was not reached in phase I, the phase II
portion was started at 50 Gy in five fractions and
designed to enrol 45 patients.
The phase II component was designed to test whether
late GU/GI toxicity at 270e540 d from the start of
treatment following the protocol treatment is above
10%. The sample size was determined such that the
probability of rejecting the treatment because of exces-
sive late toxicity is 90% if the true late toxicity rate is
23% or higher. Assuming an exponential distribution for
time from the end of the acute period to the occurrence
of late toxicity, the hazard rate for the expected 10%
toxicity rate and the unacceptable 23% toxicity rate is
0.006/month and 0.015/month, respectively. Following
the asymptotic property of the observed hazard and
using Z-test for the logarithm of the hazard ratio, we
require 12 cases with severe late GU/GI toxicity. Thus,
47 patients were required to have a statistical power of
90% with a one-sided significance level of 0.05.
PSA measurement, history, and physical examination
were conducted in patients every 3 months for year 1,
every 6 months for years 2 and 3, and yearly starting at 4
years after treatment. The ASTRO-Phoenix failure
definition was used for biochemical control [14]. The
KaplaneMeier method was used to estimate freedom
from biochemical failure (FFBF), distant metastasis free
survival, and OS. Intergroup comparisons for QOL data
were performed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Tukey’s correction or mixed-model
ANOVAs.
3. Results
A total of 47 patients were recruited to the phase I
study, although two withdrew consent before treatment.
An additional patient had Gleason 9 disease upon pa-
thology review and was excluded from the analysis. The
phase II portion included 47 additional patients for a
total of 91 analysable patients. Demographic informa-
tion is summarised in Table 1.
3.1. Biochemical outcomes
For the phase I study, the median follow up was 74
months, 72 months, and 66 months for the 45 Gy, 47.5
Gy, and 50 Gy arms, respectively. For the phase II study
the median follow up was 47.5 months with a pooled
total of 54 months (range 1e90 months). Of note, a total
of 15 patients (16.5%) received ADT for downsizing the
prostate (Table 1). The median pre-treatment PSA for
the entire cohort was 5.4 (range 0.73e16.2). Following
SBRT, PSA gradually decreased with a median nadir of
0.125 at 42 months, as showed by normalised PSA ki-
netics (Fig. 1). Six weeks after treatment, the median
PSA value for all patients was 2.19 (2.19 without ADT,
2.09 with ADT), indicating a 60% reduction. There was
no difference in PSA kinetics noted between treatment
cohorts. PSA bounce was noted in 19 (18.4%) patients
[15]; PSA bounce was detected in 17 patients after 12
months from treatment, while the remainder exhibited it
at 18 months. Four bounces occurred in the 45 Gy
group, two in the 47.5 Gy group, and the remainder in
the 50 Gy group.
FFBF was 100% for all patients at 3 years (Fig. 2).
Actuarial FFBF was 98.6% for the entire cohort, 90.9%
for the 45 Gy group with one failure, and 100% for the
47.5 Gy and 50 Gy cohorts at 5 years (Fig. 2). When
parsed by the NCCN risk group, FFBF rates were 100%
for LR patients (n Z 33) and 98% for IR patients
(n Z 58) at 5 years. Using the older three-successive-
rises
method
of
biochemical
failure,
the
FFBF
remained unchanged [16].
3.2. Survival
The actuarial OS rates for the 45 Gy, 47.5 Gy, and 50
Gy arms of the phase I study were 79%, 85%, and 92%,
respectively, at 3 years. The 3-year OS for the phase II
study was 100% and for the entire cohort was 94%.
Actuarial OS rates for the 45 Gy, 47.5 Gy, and 50 Gy
arms of the phase I study were 71.5%, 85%, and 92%,
respectively, at 5 years. The OS for phase II patients was
98% at 5 years, and the 5-year OS for all patients was
89.7%. PCa-specific survival was 100% for all cohorts as
none of the deaths were attributed to PCa-related

Fig. 1. Mean normalised PSA. PSA values were normalised
against respective pre-treatment levels; the mean of the normalised
PSA value is presented for each time point. PSA measurements
were taken at initial treatment, 6 weeks after treatment, then every
3 months for the first year, every 6 months for years 2 through 4,
and yearly thereafter. Median time to nadir was 42 months, with a
nadir value of 0.125.

 illness. The actuarial metastases-free survival rate for all
patients was also 100% at 3 and 5 years.
3.3. Toxicity
Acute and late toxicities are reported in Table 2. No
acute grade III or higher GU toxicities were noted. Late
grade III GU toxicity consisting of grade III cystitis was
noted in 4.4% of patients. A single late grade IV urinary
toxicity consisting
of cystitis
requiring
ureteroileal
diversion was observed. Actuarial toxicity for late grade
� III GU toxicity at 5 years for all patients is 6%
(Fig. 3). Grade III or higher acute GI toxicity was
detected in 2% of patients. One patient experienced
rectal
pain
requiring
diverting
colostomy;
toxicity
occurred 212 d after treatment and continued into the
late period counting as both acute and late toxicity.
Another patient was admitted for rectal bleeding and
diagnosed with Dieulafoy’s lesion on the posterior wall
of the rectum. It was unclear whether this was related to
radiation treatment or a solitary ulcer from rectal pro-
lapse. Collectively, grade III or greater late GI toxicity
was observed in 6.8% of patients (Fig. 3). Only one
grade IV GI toxicity, requiring intensive care unit
admission for rectal bleeding, was observed out of the 15
patients treated in the phase I 50 Gy arm. Actuarial late
grade � III toxicity at 5 years is estimated at 8% (Fig. 3).
Grade II or higher erectile dysfunction (ED) was re-
ported in 25.6% of men with potency before treatment at
55 months follow up; median time to onset was 296 d.
Grade III ED was only detected in two men.
3.4. Quality of life
QOL data were assessed using the AUASS and EPIC
bowel, urinary, hormonal, and sexual function scoring
systems. Patient compliance with EPIC and AUASS
questionnaires was initially greater than 90%, but
decreased significantly by 18 months after treatment.
Repeated measures mixed-model ANOVAs were per-
formed to account for data loss, revealing a significant
decrease in all four EPIC domains and AUASS over
time. Intergroup comparisons were also performed at
each time point; no differences were noted among dose
levels for the EPIC domain or AUASS (Fig. 4AeD).
4. Discussion
SBRT has become increasingly common to treat men
with PCa despite the lack of long-term follow up pro-
spective trials demonstrating its efficacy. We report 5-
year results of a phase I/II prospective study of SBRT in
men with LR and IR PCa.
We found a 3-year actuarial FFBF of 100% with a
median follow up of 54 months for the entire cohort
(Fig. 2) by either using the ASTRO-Phoenix definition
or the older three-successive-rises method [16]. We

 acknowledge that 5 year efficacy outcomes may be
overestimated by our short follow up, but report a
98.6% FFBF. OS was lower than anticipated in the 45
Gy cohort but none of the deaths were attributable to
treatment or PCa. Likely the low OS is related to chance
and the older age of the treatment cohorts. The majority
(64%) of the patients enrolled in this study were found to
have IR PCa with 100% and 98% at 3 and 5 year FFBF
rates. It is important to note that percent core positivity
was not recorded and not all IR patients were enrolled
in this trial; many of these patients may have been
considered favourable IR, but 16% of patients were
Gleason 4 þ 3. Only 14 (24%) of IR patients received a
short course of ADT prior for prostate volume reduc-
tion. This outcome was favourable even in convention-
ally fractionated radiation therapy treated-patients who
received a short course of ADT [17,18]. Prospective
randomised trials are needed to assess if single modality
SBRT treatment provides sufficient control for IR
patients.
The patient who experienced biochemical recurrence
had Gleason 4 þ 3, an initial PSA of 7.4, was staged
clinically as T2b, and treated in the lowest dose arm. He
presented a biopsy-confirmed internal iliac node with
prostate adenocarcinoma. A prostate biopsy revealed
two microscopic foci of a questionably viable tumour
3.4 years after treatment. Several studies have reported
no improvement in outcomes with longer follow up in
IR PCa patients previously treated with SBRT doses
lower than 40 Gy [2,3,19,20]. Higher doses (as those
reported in this study) may be needed for increased
biochemical control of biologically aggressive disease.
Conventionally fractionated and intensity modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) dose escalation studies re-
ported 5-year FFBF rates between 69 and 76% [21,22].
Radical prostatectomy (RP) series indicated 5-year
recurrence-free survival rates between 65 and 84% [23]
for
IR
PCa.
Modestly
hypofractionated
regimens
report FFBF rates of 82 and 90% in LR and IR
respectively [18,24]. The current study demonstrates
improved results compared to previously published
data, regardless of modality.
One prospective study in 40 patients reported a me-
dian follow up of 41 months and a FFBF rate of 90%
after SBRT with 33.5 Gy in five fractions using the
ASTRO-Phoenix definition, but only 70% using the
three-consecutive-rises method [3]. A second prospective
series conducted in 67 patients indicated a median
follow up of 2.7 years and a 4-year FFBF rate of 94%
after a five-fraction treatment dose of 36.25 Gy in LR
patients
[2].
Prospective
registry
and
retrospective
studies have shed light on the efficacy of SBRT for PCa.
In a series of SBRT for LR and IR PCa treated with
36.25 Gy in five fractions, Katz et al [20] reported a 7-
year FFBF of 93.7% with a median follow up of 72
months. Failure rates stratified by NCCN risk groups
revealed 95.9% and 89.3% FFBF rates for LR and IR,
respectively. Further sub-group analysis revealed Glea-
son 4 þ 3 patients had the lowest FFBF with a 7-year
outcome of 84.3%. In a large multi-centre registry trial,
Freeman et al. reported a 92% 2-year FFBF rate in a
mixed population of 2000 PCa patients of mixed risk-

to be 6% at 5 years whereas the crude rate of toxicity was found to be 5.5%. Actuarial grade III or greater late GI toxicity was found to be
8% whereas the crude rate was 6.6%. GU Z genitourinary; GI Z gastrointestinal.

 groups mostly treated with SBRT monotherapy [25]. A
2-year FFBF rate of 85% was found in the IR group.
Lastly, Chen et al [19] reported a 99% FFBF with a
median follow up of 2.4 years in a mixed population of
100 PCa patients treated with and without androgen
suppression and SBRT of 35e36.25 Gy in five fractions.
Reported rates of acute grade II urinary toxicity were
19e35%, acute grade III toxicities were 0e6%, late
grade II GU toxicities were 17e31%, and late grade III
toxicities were 2e5% when doses of 35e40Gy in five
fractions were used [3,15,19,26e28]. The cumulative
acute grade II GU toxicity rate in this study was 22%
with no reported acute grade III toxicity. Fourteen out
of 20 of these toxicities were observed in the 50 Gy arm.
We also report crude and actuarial late grade III GU
toxicity rate of 4.4% and 6% respectively with one
(1.1%) reported grade IV toxicity, all in the 50 Gy arm
(Fig. 3). While our study is comparable with previously
reported SBRT series, 50 Gy induced a small increase in
acute GU toxicity. The GU toxicity profile in this study
is modestly higher than conventionally fractionated dose
escalated radiation treatments [29].
Previous SBRT studies reported acute grade II GI
toxicity rates of 0e14%, grade III of 0e5%, late grade II
of 0e15%, and late grade III of 0e5% using doses of
35e40 Gy [3,15,19,26e28]. Doses of 45 and 47.5 Gy are
comparable to the reported toxicities but 50 Gy resulted
in one (1.6%) acute and two (3.3%) late grade IV

 toxicities. In all cases but one, patients developed ul-
ceration of the rectum requiring diverting colostomy.
We have extensively analysed the rectal dosimetry of all
patients and demonstrated that grade III or higher rectal
toxicity occurred when >3 cm3 of the rectal wall
received 50 Gy, >35% of the rectal wall circumference
received 39 Gy and > 50% circumference of the rectal
wall received 24 Gy [13]. When compared to dose
escalation and image-guided IMRT, late GI toxicities of
45 and 47.5 Gy dose levels were modestly higher
[29e32]. While the toxicity in the lower dose arms is
comparable to those reported elsewhere it is important
to note that the small numbers from the phase I portion
may underestimate the overall toxicity rates.
Our centre has recently initiated a PCa SBRT study
at 45 Gy in five fractions (NCT02353832) using a
biodegradable spacer injected between the prostate and
the rectum to eliminate all rectal toxicity [33]. Other
approaches have been taken to avoid toxicity such as
simultaneous lesion directed boosts. Initial pilot studies
report acute grade III GI and GU toxicity rates of 2 and
8% respectively which are similar to whole gland tech-
niques. It is important to note that this method is highly
dependent on MRI with reported success rates between
28 and 90% in identifying lesions [34,35]. The FLAME
and SPARC (NCT02145494) trials will further deter-
mine the safety and efficacy of this treatment method
[36].
Reported ED rates were as high as 40% with
conventionally fractionated radiation treatments [37,38].
A systematic review of RP techniques reported potency
rates of 11e40% for open, 13e56% for unilateral and
31e84% for bilateral nerve sparing RP [39]. The 25.6%
ED rate in this study is encouraging even when
compared to other SBRT studies [17,40]. The QOL
analysis of this study was limited by low questionnaire
compliance. Recent studies reported that QOL can be
affected up to 3 years from SBRT treatment, whereas
our study was limited to 18 months [41].
In the phase I study only one patient had grade III
rectal toxicity at 50 Gy for a crude rate of 6.7%. The
patient was on immunosuppression and toxicity devel-
oped 9 months after treatment. The 50 Gy cohort had a
similar crude rate of late GI toxicity which suggests the
number of patients with toxicity is a result of the
increased number of patients. The phase II was designed
such that if ten or more patients had severe toxicity the
trial would be stopped. Though the current analysis still
did not meet the stoppage rules, we recommend using
doses less than 50 Gy. The patients with toxicity
required significant surgical intervention as a result of
treatment and the probability of toxicity is not war-
ranted given the safety of modest hypofractionation
with ADT or lower doses of SBRT [18]. The phase I
study was designed to assess late toxicity at 9 months
after radiation therapy however four of six late GI
toxicities
occurred
greater
than
9
months
after
treatment. Radiation trials in PCa present an interesting
design challenge since the time to toxicity can be long.
This study underscores the inherent flaws with tradi-
tional dose escalation studies and underscores the need
for rigorous multi-phase studies in evaluation of new
therapies regardless of modality.
We report the results of a prospective study of SBRT
in men with LR and IR PCa. This study shows SBRT
with doses of 45 and 47.5 Gy in five fractions results in
high control rates and acceptable toxicity, however
doses of 50 Gy results in high rates of late toxicity.
Future studies will clarify the dose necessary to achieve
appropriate
balance
between
control
and
toxicity.
Longer follow up and additional trials are necessary
before SBRT can be accepted as a standard of care but
are warranted given the promising results.
