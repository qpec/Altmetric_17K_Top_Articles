IMPORTANCE Medical students are at high risk for depression and suicidal ideation. However,
the prevalence estimates of these disorders vary between studies.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of depression, depressive symptoms, and suicidal
ideation in medical students.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION Systematic search of EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE,
psycARTICLES, and psycINFO without language restriction for studies on the prevalence of
depression, depressive symptoms, or suicidal ideation in medical students published before
September 17, 2016. Studies that were published in the peer-reviewed literature and used
validated assessment methods were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Information on study characteristics; prevalence of
depression or depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation; and whether students who screened
positive for depression sought treatment was extracted independently by 3 investigators.
Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Differences by study-level
characteristics were estimated using stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Point or period prevalence of depression, depressive
symptoms, or suicidal ideation as assessed by validated questionnaire or structured interview.
RESULTS Depression or depressive symptom prevalence data were extracted from 167
cross-sectional studies (n = 116 628) and 16 longitudinal studies (n = 5728) from 43 countries.
All but 1 study used self-report instruments. The overall pooled crude prevalence of
depression or depressive symptoms was 27.2% (37 933/122 356 individuals; 95% CI, 24.7% to
29.9%, I2 = 98.9%). Summary prevalence estimates ranged across assessment modalities
from 9.3% to 55.9%. Depressive symptom prevalence remained relatively constant over the
period studied (baseline survey year range of 1982-2015; slope, 0.2% increase per year [95%
CI, −0.2% to 0.7%]). In the 9 longitudinal studies that assessed depressive symptoms before
and during medical school (n = 2432), the median absolute increase in symptoms was 13.5%
(range, 0.6% to 35.3%). Prevalence estimates did not significantly differ between studies of
only preclinical students and studies of only clinical students (23.7% [95% CI, 19.5% to
28.5%] vs 22.4% [95% CI, 17.6% to 28.2%]; P = .72). The percentage of medical students
screening positive for depression who sought psychiatric treatment was 15.7% (110/954
individuals; 95% CI, 10.2% to 23.4%, I2 = 70.1%). Suicidal ideation prevalence data were
extracted from 24 cross-sectional studies (n = 21 002) from 15 countries. All but 1 study used
self-report instruments. The overall pooled crude prevalence of suicidal ideation was 11.1%
(2043/21 002 individuals; 95% CI, 9.0% to 13.7%, I2 = 95.8%). Summary prevalence
estimates ranged across assessment modalities from 7.4% to 24.2%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review, the summary estimate of the
prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms among medical students was 27.2% and
that of suicidal ideation was 11.1%. Further research is needed to identify strategies for
preventing and treating these disorders in this population.

S
tudies have suggested that medical students experi-
ence high rates of depression and suicidal ideation.1
However, estimates of the prevalence of depression or
depressivesymptomsamongstudentsvaryacrossstudiesfrom
1.4% to 73.5%,2,3 and those of suicidal ideation vary from 4.9%
to 35.6%.4,5 Studies also report conflicting findings about
whether student depression and suicidality vary by under-
graduate year, sex, or other characteristics.6-11
Reliable estimates of depression and suicidal ideation
prevalence during medical training are important for inform-
ing efforts to prevent, treat, and identify causes of emotional
distress among medical students,12 especially in light of recent
work revealing a high prevalence of depression in resident
physicians.13 We conducted a systematic review and meta-
analysis of published studies of depression, depressive symp-
toms,andsuicidalideationinundergraduatemedicaltrainees.
Methods
Search Strategy and Study Eligibility
Two authors (M.A.R. and D.A.M.) independently identified
cross-sectionalandlongitudinalstudiespublishedpriortoSep-
tember 17, 2016, that reported on the prevalence of depres-
sion,depressivesymptoms,orsuicidalideationinmedicalstu-
dents by systematically searching EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE,
psycARTICLES, and psycINFO. In addition, the authors
screened the reference lists of identified articles and corre-
sponded with study investigators using the approaches im-
plied by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-
views and Meta-analyses and Meta-analysis of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines.14,15
For the database searches, terms related to medical stu-
dents and study design were combined with those related to
depression and suicide without language restriction (com-
plete details of the search strategy appear in eMethods 1 in the
Supplement).Includedstudies(1)reporteddataonmedicalstu-
dents, (2) were published in peer-reviewed journals, and
(3) used a validated method to assess for depression, depres-
sive symptoms, or suicidal ideation.16 A third author (L.S.R.)
resolved discrepancies by discussion and adjudication.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Three authors (L.S.R., M.T., and J.B.S.) independently ex-
tracted the following data from each article using a standard-
ized form: study design; geographic location; years of sur-
vey; year in school; sample size; average age of participants;
number and percentage of male participants; diagnostic or
screening method used; outcome definition (ie, specific diag-
nostic criteria or screening instrument cutoff); and reported
prevalence estimates of depression, depressive symptoms, or
suicidal ideation. Whether students who screened positive for
depression sought psychiatric or other mental health treat-
ment also was extracted. When there were studies involving
the same population of students, only the most comprehen-
sive or recent publication was included.
The same 3 authors independently assessed the risk of
bias of these nonrandomized studies using a modified ver-
sion of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, which assesses sample
representativeness and size, comparability between respon-
dents and nonrespondents, ascertainment of depressive or
suicidal symptoms, and thoroughness of descriptive statis-
tics reporting (complete details regarding scoring appear in
eMethods 2 in the Supplement).17 Studies were judged to be
at low risk of bias (≥3 points) or high risk of bias (<3 points).
A fourth author (D.A.M.) resolved discrepancies through
discussion and adjudication.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Prevalence estimates of depression or depressive symptoms
and suicidal ideation were calculated by pooling the study-
specific estimates using random-effects meta-analyses that
accounted for between-study heterogeneity.18 The same
approach was used to estimate the summary percentage of
students screening positive for depression who sought treat-
ment. When studies reported point prevalence estimates
made at different periods within the year, the overall period
prevalence was used. Standard χ2 tests and the I2 statistic
(ie, the percentage of variability in prevalence estimates due
to heterogeneity rather than sampling error, or chance, with
values ≥75% indicating considerable heterogeneity) were
used to assess between-study heterogeneity.19,20
Sensitivity analyses were performed by serially ex-
cluding each study to determine the influence of individual
studies on the overall prevalence estimates. Results from
studies grouped according to prespecified study-level charac-
teristics were compared using stratified meta-analysis (for
diagnostic criteria or screening instrument cutoff, study
design, undergraduate level, continent or region, country,
and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale components) or random-effects
meta-regression (for year of baseline survey, age, and
sex).21,22 To isolate associations within the medical school
experience from associations with assessment tools, an
analysis restricted to longitudinal studies reporting both pre-
and intramedical school depressive symptom prevalence
estimates was performed.
Bias secondary to small study effects was investigated
usingfunnelplotsandtheEggertest.23,24Allanalyseswereper-
formed using R version 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical
Computing).25 Statistical tests were 2-sided and used a sig-
nificance threshold of P < .05.
Key Points
Question Are medical students at high risk for depression and
suicidal ideation?
Findings In this meta-analysis, the overall prevalence of
depression or depressive symptoms among medical students was
27.2%, and the overall prevalence of suicidal ideation was 11.1%.
Among medical students who screened positive for depression,
15.7% sought psychiatric treatment.
Meaning The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms among
medical students in this study was higher than that reported in the
general population, which underscores the need for effective
preventive efforts and increased access to care for medical students.

Study Characteristics
One hundred ninety-five studies2-11,26-210 involving a total of
129 123 individuals in 47 countries were included in the
analysis (Figure 1). The median number of participants per
study was 336 (range, 44-10 140). One hundred sixty-seven
cross-sectional studies2-4,6-9,11,26-184 (n = 116 628) and 16
longitudinal studies10,196-210 (n = 5728) in 43 countries
reported on depression or depressive symptom prevalence
(Table 1). Twenty-four cross-sectional studies (n = 21 002) in
15 countries reported on the prevalence of suicidal ideation
(Table 2).4,5,34,62,65,73,74,79,112,160,165,167,174,185-195

Prevalence of Depression or Depressive Symptoms
Among Medical Students
Meta-analytic pooling of the prevalence estimates of
depression or depressive symptoms reported by 183 studies
yielded a crude summary prevalence of 27.2% (37 933/
122 356 individuals; 95% CI, 24.7%-29.9%), with significant
evidence of between-study heterogeneity (Q = 16721.1,
τ2 = 0.78, I2 = 98.9%, P < .001) (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).
The prevalence estimates reported by the individual studies
ranged from 1.4% to 73.5%. Sensitivity analysis, in which
the meta-analysis was serially repeated after exclusion of
each study, demonstrated that no individual study affected
the overall prevalence estimate by more than 0.3% (eTable 3
in the Supplement).
To further characterize the range of depression or depres-
sive symptom prevalence estimates identified by these meth-
odologicallydiversestudies,meta-analysesstratifiedbyscreen-
ing instrument and cutoff score were conducted (Figure 7).

Study-Level Characteristics
No statistically significant differences in prevalence esti-
mates were noted between cross-sectional studies (36 632/
116 628 [27.3%; 95% CI, 24.7%-30.1%]) and longitudinal stud-
ies (1301/5728 [26.7%; 95% CI, 19.1%-36.1%]) (test for subgroup
differences, Q = 0.02, P = .90) or studies performed in the
United States (14 356/36 249 [26.7%; 95% CI, 22.5%-31.3%])
compared with those performed outside the United States
(23 577/86 107 [27.4%; 95% CI, 24.5%-30.6%]) (Q = 0.08,
P = .78). Studies were further stratified by continent or re-
gion in Figure 8. Prevalence estimates from studies limited to
preclinical students (4866/25 462 [23.7%; 95% CI, 19.5%-
28.5%]) did not significantly differ from estimates from stud-
ies limited to clinical students (2917/13 172 [22.4%; 95% CI,
17.6%-28.2%]) (Q = 0.13, P = .72).
Prevalence estimates did not significantly vary with base-
line survey year (survey year range, 1982-2015; slope = 0.2%
1-yearincrease[95%CI,−0.2%to0.7%];Q = 1.17,P = .28).There

age increase in male study participants [95% CI, −15.9% to
13.7%]; Q = 0.02, P = .88).
When evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa criteria, higher
prevalence estimates were found among studies with more
representative participant populations (24 366/68 693; 36.3%
[95% CI, 29.9%-43.3%]) compared with those with less repre-
sentative participant populations (13 567/53 663; 25.4% [95%
CI, 22.8%-28.2%]) (Q = 9.6, P = .002; Figure 9). There were

Heterogeneity Within Depression Screening Instruments
Toidentifypotentialsourcesofheterogeneityindependentofas-
sessment modality, heterogeneity was examined within sub-
groups of studies using common instruments when at least 6
studieswereavailable(completeresultsappearineTable4inthe
Supplement).Nosignificantdifferencesbetweencross-sectional
andlongitudinalstudieswereobservedwithinanyinstruments
when at least 3 studies were in each comparator subgroup.
Heterogeneity was partially accounted for by country with
US studies yielding lower depression or depressive symptom
prevalence estimates than non-US studies among the 24 stud-
ies using the BDI and a cutoff score of 10 or greater (13.0% vs
37.5%, respectively; Q = 12.7, P < .001) and the 13 studies using
the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) and a cutoff score of 16 or greater (34.4% vs 50.3%;
Q = 3.8, P = .05). However, this difference was not seen among
other instruments.
Leveloftrainingdidnotsignificantlycontributetobetween-
study heterogeneity among any of the examined instru-
ments. Year of baseline survey significantly contributed to
observed statistical heterogeneity among 3 instruments,

The vertical dashed lines indicate the pooled summary estimate (95% CI) for all
studies in Figures 2-6: 27.2% (37 933/122 356 individuals); 95% CI,
24.7%-29.9%; I2 = 98.9%, τ2 = 0.78, P < .001. The area of each square is
proportional to the inverse variance of the estimate. Horizontal lines indicate
95% confidence intervals of the estimate. The studies in Figures 2-6 are

although the results were inconsistent (ie, 2 analyses sug-
gested that depression was increasing with time, whereas a
third suggested it was decreasing). Age and sex were not sig-
nificantly associated with depression prevalence among any
instruments.
Analysis of Longitudinal Studies
The temporal relationship between exposure to medical
school and depressive symptoms was assessed in an analysis
of 9 longitudinal studies that measured depressive symp-
toms before and during medical school (Table 3). Because
studies used different assessment instruments, the relative
change in depressive symptoms was calculated for each
study individually (ie, follow-up prevalence divided by base-
line prevalence) and then the relative changes derived from
the individual studies were examined. Overall, the median
absolute increase in depressive symptoms was 13.5% (range,
0.6%-35.3%) following the onset of medical training.
Prevalence of Suicidal Ideation Among Medical Students
In an analysis of 24 studies, the crude summary prevalence
of suicidal ideation, variably reported as having occurred over
the past 2 weeks to the past 12 months, was 11.1% (2043/
21 002 individuals; 95% CI, 9.0%-13.7%), with significant evi-
dence of between-study heterogeneity (Q = 547.1, τ2 = 0.32,
I2 = 95.8%, P < .001) (Figure 10). The prevalence estimates re-
ported by the individual studies ranged from 4.9% to 35.6%.
Sensitivity analysis showed that no individual study affected
the overall pooled estimate by more than 1.9% (eTable 5 in the
Supplement).
To further characterize the range of the suicidal ideation
prevalence estimates identified, stratified meta-analyses
were performed by screening instrument and cutoff score.
Summary prevalence estimates ranged from 7.4% (69/938
individuals [95% CI, 5.9%-9.2%]; Q = 0.01, τ2 = 0, I2 = 0%)
over the past 2 weeks for studies using the 9-item Patient
Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to 24.2% (208/754 individuals

nent or region, level of training, baseline survey year, aver-
age age, proportion of male study participants, or total
Newcastle-Ottawa score (P > .05 for all comparisons). Within-
instrument heterogeneity was not examined because there
were not enough studies using identical screening instru-
ments (≤4 for each assessment modality), precluding mean-
ingful analysis.
Assessment of Publication Bias
Visual inspection of the funnel plot of studies reporting on
depression or depressive symptoms revealed significant
asymmetry (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). There was evi-
dence of publication bias, with smaller studies yielding more
extreme prevalence estimates (P = .001 using the Egger test).
The funnel plot of studies reporting on suicidal ideation
revealed minimal asymmetry (eFigure 3 in the Supplement),
suggesting the absence of significant publication bias (P = .49
using the Egger test).
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis of 195 studies
involving 129 123 medical students in 47 countries demon-
strated that 27.2% (range, 9.3%-55.9%) of students screened
positive for depression and that 11.1% (range, 7.4%-24.2%)
reported suicidal ideation during medical school. Only
15.7% of students who screened positive for depression
reportedly sought treatment. These findings are concerning
given that the development of depression and suicidality
has been linked to an increased short-term risk of suicide as
well as a higher long-term risk of future depressive episodes
and morbidity.211,212
The present analysis builds on recent work demonstrat-
ing a high prevalence of depression among resident physi-
cians, and the concordance between the summary preva-
lence estimates (27.2% in students vs 28.8% in residents)
suggests that depression is a problem affecting all levels of
medical training.13,213 Taken together, these data suggest
that depressive and suicidal symptoms in medical trainees
may adversely affect the long-term health of physicians as
well as the quality of care delivered in academic medical
centers.214-216
When interpreting these findings, it is important to
recognize that the data synthesized in this study were
almost exclusively derived from self-report inventories of
depressive symptoms that varied substantially in their
sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing major depressive
disorder (eTable 6 in the Supplement).217 Instruments such
as the PHQ-9 have high sensitivity and specificity for diag-
nosing major depression, whereas others such as the Pri-
mary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) have
low specificity and should be viewed as screening tools.
Although these self-report measures of depressive symp-
toms have limitations, they are essential tools for accurately
measuring depression in medical trainees because they

protect anonymity in a manner that is not possible through
formal diagnostic interviews.218 To control for the differ-
ences in these inventories, we stratified our analyses by sur-
vey instrument and cutoff score, identifying a range of esti-
mates not captured in another evidence synthesis.219
The prevalence of depressive symptoms among medical
students in this study was higher than that reported in the
general population.220-222 For example, the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health study of behavioral health trends in
the United States, including 67 500 nationally representa-
tive participants, found that the 12-month prevalence of a
major depressive episode was 9.3% among 18- to 25-year-
olds and 7.2% among 26- to 49-year-olds.220 In contrast, the
BDI, CES-D, and PHQ-9 summary estimates obtained in the
present study were between 2.2 and 5.2 times higher than
these estimates. These findings suggest that depressive
symptom prevalence is substantially higher among medical
students than among individuals of similar age in the gen-
eral population.
How depression levels in medical students compare
with those in nonmedical undergraduate students and pro-
fessional students is unclear. One review concluded that
depressive symptom prevalence did not statistically differ
between medical students and nonmedical undergraduate
students.223 However, this conclusion may be confounded
because the analysis did not control for assessment modal-
ity and did not include a comprehensive or representative
set of studies (only 12 studies and 4 studies exclusively com-
posed of medical students and nonmedical students,
respectively). Two large, representative epidemiological
studies have estimated that depressive symptom prevalence
in nonmedical students ranges from 13.8% to 21.0%, lower
than the estimates reported by many studies of medical stu-
dents in the present meta-analysis.224,225
Some professional students, such as law students, may
not markedly differ from medical students in their suscepti-
bility to depression, although firm conclusions cannot be
drawn from the currently available data.226,227 Together,
these findings suggest that factors responsible for depres-
sion in medical students may also be operative in other
undergraduate and professional schools. The finding in the
longitudinal analysis of an increase in depressive symptom
prevalence with the onset of medical school suggests that it
is not just that medical students (and other students) are
prone to depression, but that the school experience may be
a causal factor.
Thisanalysisidentifiedapooledprevalenceofsuicidalide-
ation of 11.1%. Endorsement of suicidal ideation as assessed
by the PHQ-9 or other similar instruments increases the cu-
mulative risk of a suicide attempt or completion over the next
year by 10- and 100-fold, respectively.228 Combined with the
findingthatonly15.7%ofmedicalstudentswhoscreenedposi-
tive for depression sought treatment, the high prevalence of
suicidal ideation underscores the need for effective preven-

tive efforts and increased access to care that accommodate the
needs of medical students and the demands of their training.
Limitations
This study has important limitations. First, the data were de-
rived from studies that had different designs, screening in-
struments, and trainee demographics. The substantial hetero-
geneity among the studies remained largely unexplained by
the variables inspected. Second, many subgroup analyses re-
lied on unpaired cross-sectional data collected at different
medical schools, which may cause confounding. Third, be-
cause the studies were heterogeneous with respect to screen-
ing inventories and student populations, the prevalence of ma-
jor depression could not be determined. Fourth, the analysis
relied on aggregated published data. A multicenter, prospec-
tive study using a single validated measure of depression and
suicidalideationwithstructureddiagnosticinterviewsinaran-
dom subset of participants would provide a more accurate es-
timate of the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation
among medical students.
Future Directions
Becauseofthehighprevalenceofdepressiveandsuicidalsymp-
tomatology in medical students, there is a need for additional
studies to identify the root causes of emotional distress in this
population. To provide more relevant information, future epi-
demiological studies should consider adopting prospective
studydesignssothatthesameindividualscanbeassessedover
time,usecommonlyusedscreeninginstrumentswithvalidcut-
offs for assessing depression in the community (eg, the BDI,
CES-D, or PHQ-9), screen for comorbid anxiety disorders, and
completely and accurately report their data, for example, by
closely following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observa-
tional Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.229
Possible causes of depressive and suicidal symptomatol-
ogy in medical students likely include stress and anxiety sec-
ondary to the competitiveness of medical school.62 Restruc-
turing medical school curricula and student evaluations
(such as using a pass-fail grading schema rather than a tiered
grading schema and fostering collaborative group learning
through a “flipped-classroom” education model) might ame-
liorate these stresses.230,231 Future research should also
determine how strongly depression in medical school pre-
dicts depression during residency and whether interventions
that reduce depression in medical students carry over in their
effectiveness when those students transition to residency.232
Furthermore, efforts are continually needed to reduce barri-
ers to mental health services, including addressing the
stigma of depression.146,233

lence of depression or depressive symptoms among medical
