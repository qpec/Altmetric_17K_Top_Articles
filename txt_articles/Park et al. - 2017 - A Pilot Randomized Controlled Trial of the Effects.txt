Abstract
Objectives—To determine effects of Sit ‘N’ Fit Chair Yoga, compared to a Health Education 
program (HEP), on pain and physical function in older adults with lower extremity osteoarthritis 
(OA) who could not participate in standing exercise
Design—Two-arm randomized controlled trial
Setting—One HUD senior housing facility and one day senior center in south Florida
Participants—Community-dwelling older adults (N = 131) were randomly assigned to chair 
yoga (n = 66) or HEP (n = 65). Thirteen dropped after assignment but prior to the intervention; 6 
dropped during the intervention; 106 of 112 completed at least 12 of 16 sessions (95% retention 
rate).
Interventions—Participants attended either chair yoga or HEP. Both interventions consisted of 
twice-weekly 45-minute sessions for 8 weeks.

 Measurements—Primary: pain, pain interference; secondary: balance, gait speed, fatigue, 
functional ability measured at baseline, after 4 weeks of intervention, at the end of the 8-week 
intervention, and post-intervention (1 and 3 months).
Results—The chair yoga group showed greater reduction in pain interference during the 
intervention (p = .01), sustained through 3 months (p = .022). WOMAC pain (p = .048), gait speed 
(p = .024), and fatigue (p = .037) were improved in the yoga group during the intervention (p = .
048) but improvements were not sustained post intervention. Chair yoga had no effect on balance.
Conclusion—An 8-week chair yoga program was associated with reduction in pain, pain 
interference, and fatigue, and improvement in gait speed, but only the effects on pain interference 
were sustained 3 months post intervention. Chair yoga should be further explored as a 
nonpharmacologic intervention for older people with OA in the lower extremities.

INTRODUCTION
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in older adults. Consequences 
associated with OA include pain, joint stiffness, and functional limitation of activities of 
daily living.1 OA is the leading cause of long-term disability among older adults,2 affecting 
33.6% of those over age 65 (12.4 million persons) in the United States.3 OA annually 
accounts for more than 11 million physician and outpatient visits, 662,000 hospitalizations, 
and an estimated $81 billion in costs for medical and surgical treatments.4
To manage pain and OA symptoms, older adults commonly use pharmacological treatments 
(prescription and over-the-counter) that predispose them to adverse events5 and increase 
health care costs for outpatient and emergency room visits and hospitalization.6 Safe and 
effective nonpharmacological treatments to reduce pain and improve physical function in 
older adults with OA are needed.
Consistent exercise has demonstrated effectiveness in relieving OA pain and stiffness and 
improving physical function.7 However, the ability to participate in exercise declines with 
age; more than 50% of community-dwelling older adults who begin an exercise program 
drop out before receiving benefits.8
Yoga is a promising mind-body practice with four standard components: physical postures, 
breathing practices, relaxation, and meditative mental focus.9 Yoga is recommended by the 
Arthritis Foundation10 to reduce joint pain, improve flexibility and balance, and decrease 
stress and tension. It has demonstrated positive effects on OA pain, stiffness, swelling,11 and 
mobility.12 However, many persons with OA cannot participate in standing exercise due to 
problems with pain and balance, lack of muscle strength, or fear of falling due to impaired 
balance.13

 Chair yoga (CY) is practiced sitting in a chair or standing while holding the chair for 
support14; it is well suited to older adults who cannot participate in standing yoga or 
exercise.15,16 However, very few studies11,15,16 have examined its effectiveness for older 
adults with OA. The objective of this pilot study was to determine immediate and sustained 
effects of Sit ‘N’ Fit Chair Yoga on pain and physical function in older adults with OA.
METHODS
Study Design and Randomization
A two-arm randomized controlled trial was used to examine the effects of an 8-week CY 
intervention. One week prior to the initiation of the intervention, participants were randomly 
assigned to either the CY program (treatment group) or the health education program (HEP; 
attentional control group) by an independent statistician who was not involved in the study, 
using a random computer-generated program at each of two community sites over the three 
different time periods.
Participants
Participants were recruited from two settings—a U.S. Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) senior housing facility and a senior day center—through an information session 
conducted at each site by the principal investigators. Participants were not limited to those 
who registered at the sites; community people were welcomed via a local newspaper article. 
Inclusion criteria were age 65 years or older, living in the community, self-reported joint 
pain caused by OA verified by a geriatric nurse practitioner and present in one or more lower 
extremity joints (e.g., knee, hip, foot, or ankle), moderate chronic pain (at least 4 on a pain 
bother scale [0 = no pain to 10 = excruciating pain]) at least 15 days per month for 3 months 
or longer, ability to ambulate independently with or without assistive devices, and inability 
to participate in standing exercise. Exclusion criteria were knee surgery (or knee 
arthroscopy) or hip surgery within 12 weeks prior to enrollment, systemic or intra-articular 
corticosteroid in the past 60 days, and serious comorbidity that could interfere with the 
participant’s ability to complete the CY program (e.g., heart failure [level IV] causing 
shortness of breath on exertion, Meniere’s disease causing nausea with twisting and bending 
forward while seated).
Interventions
The Sit ‘N’ Fit Chair Yoga intervention was developed by a master yoga instructor with 
more than 20 years of experience with older adults. It was built on the Iyengar Hatha Yoga 
technique, recommended by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health 
(NCCIH) as safe for older adults because of its emphasis on proper body alignment.17 The 
yoga intervention consisted of twice-weekly 45-minute sessions incorporating four 
components—physical postures, breathing, deep relaxation, and meditation—while using 
the support of a chair. The yoga instructor at each site was certified by the Yoga Alliance and 
spent two 8-hour days being trained on the Sit “N” Fit Chair Yoga program by the program 
developer. The instructors also received a 4-hour safety class taught by one of the 
investigators. Post intervention (after 8 weeks), CY participants were given a manual with 
instructions and pictures for yoga practice at home. To monitor continuing practice at home,

 CY participants were asked to report frequency, duration, and components of yoga home 
practice at the 3-month data collection point.
To control for attention and time, HEP participants attended twice-weekly 45-minute 
sessions for 8 weeks led by health care providers trained by the principal investigators. The 
instructors received two 4-hour days being trained on HEP teaching instructions and serving 
as an arbitrator of any disagreements between participants on a certain topic. HEP 
participants discussed general health education information and specific facts regarding OA; 
they did not participate in any form of yoga.
Fidelity of CY was ensured by the program developer and fidelity of HEP was ensured by 
the site coordinators; 20% of the sessions were assessed through observation using a 
standardized checklist.
Measures
Demographic information and physical measures were collected by blinded data collectors 
at five time points: baseline, 4 weeks into the intervention, 8 weeks at completion of the 
intervention, and 1 and 3 months post intervention. All measures were completed on paper 
by participants using Likert-type response choices, which were summed to obtain an overall 
score for each measure at each data point. Pain and fatigue measurement tools were from the 
Patient Reported Outcome Measurement System (PROMIS), a collection of highly reliable, 
precise measures of patient-reported physical status. PROMIS is part of a National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) Roadmap project.18 All PROMIS measures were scored using standardized 
scoring manuals.
The PROMIS Pain Interference-Short Form (PI-SF) V. 1.0–8a18 measures interference due 
to pain on a 5-point scale. Alpha reliability ranges from .96 to .99 and construct validity is 
adequate.19
The PROMIS Fatigue-V 1.0 SF-8a18 measure uses a 5-point scale to measure level of 
fatigue.18 Higher scores indicate higher levels of fatigue.18 Pearson’s correlation was .94 
when the fatigue scale was evaluated against the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy-Fatigue20
The Berg Balance Scale (BBS)21 is an observational 14-item measure with a 5-point scale. 
Intrarater reliability (ICC = .68–.99), interrater reliability (ICC = .88–.98), and internal 
validity22 are acceptable.
The Gait Speed Test23 was used to measure physical function. Intrarater reliability and test-
retest reliability are high (ICC = .90–.96, r = 89–100; r = .93, ICC = .78) in older adults.23
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)24 
measures pain and functional ability using 24 items. Cronbach’s alpha is .95 for the pain 
scale and .91 for the functional ability scale in tests with persons with OA.25

 Data Analysis
Analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 23.0 (IBM) and HLM 7.01 (SSI 
International). The Missing Value Analysis26 function in SPSS was employed to ascertain 
the extent, randomness, and pattern of missing data. Hierarchical linear models (HLM)27 
were used to analyze change over time for each participant. Depending on the nature of the 
change function, parameter estimates were calculated for intercept, slope and, if necessary, 
curvature to create the best predictive model fit. Because HLM shows longitudinal changes 
as a function of time, the time variable was centered at the baseline. The results for the 
fixed-effects model were used to report the treatment effects for both 8-week intention-to-
treat (ITT) assessment and 3-month post-intervention. The random effects model assessed 
overall changes on all outcomes over the same time periods in the study.
RESULTS
Study Sample
A total of 137 were screened for eligibility; 6 failed eligibility. Of the 131 participants 
assigned to CY (n = 66) or HEP (n = 65), 13 dropped after randomization but prior to 
intervention due to unwillingness to be in the control group or for personal reasons and 6 
dropped during the intervention, resulting in a sample of 112 (Cohort 1 [n = 36], cohort 2 [n 
= 40], cohort 3 [n = 36]); 106 completed at least 12 of the 16 sessions (see CONSORT flow 
diagram, Supplemental Appendix S1), for an overall retention rate of 95%. Group 
differences in attendance were not significantly different, t(106) = .823, p = .823. There were 
no adverse events for participants.
Demographic characteristics and health-related descriptive information are presented in 
Table 1. Figure 1 is a line graph of outcomes comparing CY and HEP over ITT and 
sustainability periods.
Intervention Phase: Linear Growth Trend
For each of the outcome measures, no significant group differences existed prior to 
intervention (Supplemental Appendix S2). There were significant decreases for CY and HEP 
combined (Supplemental Appendix S2) for pain interference (p = .009), WOMAC pain (p <.
001), WOMAC physical function (p < .001); and fatigue (p = .043). The following findings 
are indicative of analyses indicating significance using a fixed effects model.
Pain interference—There was a significantly greater decrease in pain interference for the 
CY group over 8 weeks (CY β = −1.9, HEP β = −0.2, p = .010) and 3 months (yoga β = 
−1.1, HEP β = −0.2, p = .012) compared to the HEP group. As in the 8-week period, there 
was statistically significant sustained effect of CY on pain interference at the 3 months (p = .
022; Supplemental Appendix S3).
WOMAC pain—There was a significantly greater decrease for the yoga group over 8 weeks 
(CY β = −1.0, HEP β = −0.4, p = .048).

 Gait Speed—There was a significantly greater improvement in gait speed for the yoga 
group over 8 weeks (CY β = −0.2, HEP β = 0.4, p = .024).
Fatigue—There was a significantly greater decrease in fatigue for the yoga group over 8 
weeks (CY β = −1.1, HEP β = 0.0, p = .037).
There was no other statistically significant sustained effect of CY at the 3 months post 
intervention for any other variables except pain interference. However, balance approached 
statistical significance (p = .082; Supplemental Appendix S3).
Regarding home practice after the intervention, anonymous data were available for 37 of the 
63 yoga participants; of those 37 participants, 31 reported regular practice at home. 
Participants practiced for 10 to 20 minutes a couple of times a week (n = 14) or daily (n = 
12); 15 completed all four yoga components (physical pose, breathing, deep relaxation, and 
meditation), 9 completed two components (usually physical pose and breathing), and 2 
completed three components (usually physical, breathing, and relaxation).
DISCUSSION
Results of this pilot study suggest that Sit ‘N’ Fit Chair Yoga is a safe and effective 
treatment for older adults with OA who are unable to participate in standing yoga or 
exercise. Although there is evidence11 that standing yoga provides reduction in OA-related 
stiffness and balance, this is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of CY 
on pain and physical function in older adults with OA.
The study results support use of an 8-week CY program to reduce pain and pain 
interference, improve gait speed, and reduce fatigue. With OA-associated pain, there is 
interference in everyday living, limiting functional and social activities and diminishing life 
enjoyment.2 The effect of pain on everyday living is most directly captured by pain 
interference. Findings from this study demonstrate that CY reduced pain interference in 
everyday activities. Although this pilot study was not designed to assess mechanisms of 
action, the documented effects of CY in this population may be related to the mind-body-
spirit nature of yoga. Future study focusing on the mechanisms of action that distinguish the 
effects of each of the four components (physical postures, breathing, deep relaxation, and 
meditation) is warranted.
The yoga group showed greater improvement in gait speed and fatigue during the 
intervention, although this improvement was not sustained 3 months post intervention. It is 
plausible that the participants in the CY group may not have followed the yoga program 
correctly or completed all four yoga components (physical postures, breathing, deep 
relaxation, and meditation) during home practice. Given the home practice survey data, it is 
evident that the intensity of yoga practice diminished over 3 months. Future research could 
incorporate an interview component to understand challenges of home practice.
Balance was not significantly different between groups during the intervention but it nearly 
reached significance at 3 months. This finding is inconsistent with previous findings on 
improvement in balance after 8-week standing yoga practice28 in older adults. Because CY

 does not have a balance demand comparable to standing yoga, it may take longer to 
demonstrate the effect.
This study has notable strengths: rigorous randomization process, use of blind-to-group 
assessment, and development of CY and HEP manuals. In addition, the study was rigorously 
monitored by external reviewers to ensure compliance with NIH clinical trial guidelines.29
Limitations and Implications
The major limitations were a short post-intervention period (3 months), differential attrition 
rates among CY and HEP groups, and failure to document home practice with daily logs 
completed by participants. An attempt was made to collect daily logs; however, participants 
failed to keep logs. As an alternative strategy, surveys were used to document home practice; 
however, survey data relied on participants’ memory about practice over the past 3 month, 
seriously limiting the integrity of the data.
It is reasonable to provide more exercise-based activities for older adults to reduce pain 
interference and enhance physical function associated with OA. Although the Sit ‘N’ Fit 
Chair Yoga program requires further testing, the effects on pain interference over the 3-
month pilot study time period are promising. Public health concerns about OA may be 
managed through an evidence-based CY program in community settings.
Research should determine effective treatment intensity (i.e., dose effect) with attention to 
sustaining effects over long terms. Also, research may provide booster sessions post 
intervention to remind participants of correct poses, correct body alignment, and breathing 
and relaxation techniques and examine sustained effect on pain and physical function.
With the increasing popularity of CY and a growing number of older adults adopting 
alternative modes of pain management, these findings have significant clinical implications. 
CY could be considered as an alternate therapy to decrease pain, improve physical function, 
and increase community participation by older adults. CY offers another option for non-
invasive treatment of OA in older adults. Based on the observed high adherence rate of yoga 
home practice, this CY program offers promise for OA self-management.
CONCLUSION
The long-term goal of this research is to address the non-pharmacologic management of 
lower extremity OA pain and physical function in community-dwelling older adults. This 
study provides evidence that CY may be an effective approach for achieving this goal.
