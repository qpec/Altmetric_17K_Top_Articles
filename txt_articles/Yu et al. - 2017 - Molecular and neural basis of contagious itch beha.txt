Socially contagious itch is ubiquitous in human society, but whether it exists in
rodents is unclear. Using a behavioral paradigm that does not entail prior training or
reward, we found that mice scratched after observing a conspecific scratching.
Molecular mapping showed increased neuronal activity in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus of mice that displayed contagious scratching.
Ablation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) or GRPR neurons in the
SCN abolished contagious scratching behavior, which was recapitulated by
chemogenetic inhibition of SCN GRP neurons. Activation of SCN GRP/GRPR
neurons evoked scratching behavior. These data demonstrate that GRP-GRPR
signaling is necessary and sufficient for transmitting contagious itch information
in the SCN. The findings may have implications for our understanding of neural
circuits that control socially contagious behaviors.
S
ocially contagious behaviors such as conta-
gious itching/scratching and yawning are
prevalent in humans (1, 2) and in highly
social animals (3, 4). However, such be-
haviors have only been sporadically men-
tioned in the context of imitation and/or social
learning (2, 5–7). The lack of experimental para-
digms that permit recreation of socially conta-
gious behaviors in a naturalistic environment
without prior training or reward has hindered
studies of such behaviors at the molecular and
circuit levels (3, 5, 8). To test whether scratching
is contagious in mice, we used mice with ex-
cessive spontaneous scratching because of chronic
itch as the demonstrators (9) and naïve mice
with no prior contact to mice with chronic itch
in an adjacent home cage as the observers (Fig.
1A). Mice that did not scratch excessively were
used as control demonstrators. Both observer
groups showed similar numbers of looks, defined
as a pause and look toward the demonstrator
(18.3 ± 2 versus 23.1 ± 2.6 looks, P = 0.17) (Fig. 1B).
Control observers displayed almost no coinci-
dental look-and-scratch behavior (Fig. 1C). In
contrast, mice displayed significantly increased
scratching within 5 s after look behavior (movie S1),
defined as imitative scratching, upon observation

 of demonstrators scratching (4.5 ± 0.8 versus
0.2 ± 0.2 look-and-scratches, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1, C
and D, and fig. S1A).
Next, we tested whether nonvisual cues such
as auditory and olfactory cues are dispensable for
imitative scratching by placing a mouse in a clear
cylinder in front of a computer screen that dis-
played a conspecific with scratching behavior
(Fig. 1E). As a control, a video of a mouse that
ambulated without scratching was displayed.
Comparable look behaviors between the con-
trol and scratching groups were detected (28.1 ±
3.5 versus 29.6 ± 4 looks, P = 0.78) (Fig. 1F and
fig. S1B). The video screen paradigm recapitu-
lated home-cage results, as mice observing the
scratching demonstrator displayed characteristic
imitative scratching behavior (movie S2), where-
as the controls showed almost no coincidental
look-and-scratch behavior (7.4 ± 1.3 versus 0.5 ±
0.3 look-and-scratches, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1, G and
H, and fig. S1, C to G).
To evaluate the brain regions that are ac-
tivated in the contagious itch test, we per-
formed immunohistochemistry with antibody
to c-Fos in the brains of mice that watched the
scratching demonstrator video or watched
the control ambulating mouse video. One hour
after the contagious itch test, animals were
perfused and processed. Mice that observed
scratching were recorded and counted for
imitative scratches to confirm contagious itch
behaviors. Relative to the controls, mice that
displayed contagious scratching exhibited sig-
nificant increases in c-Fos expression in several
brain regions (Fig. 2A). These regions include
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), nucleus
accumbens, caudate putamen, and amygdala.
The majority of brain areas showed either
comparable c-Fos expression between the two
groups or low c-Fos signal (table S1). Located
in the hypothalamus, the SCN is a master cir-
cadian pacemaker; it can be divided into core
and shell regions (10, 11) (Fig. 2B). Relative
to control mice, an approximate doubling of
the number of c-Fos+ neurons was detected in
the core and shell of mice with contagious
itch behavior (59 ± 5 versus 120 ± 11, P <
0.001), with more c-Fos+ neurons in the shell
area (Fig. 2, C to E). Because the SCN re-
ceives visual input directly or indirectly (11),
we hypothesized that it could be one of the
first relay circuits for mediating contagious
itch behavior. This prompted us to examine
the expression of GRP, a well-established neuro-
peptide marker in the SCN that has been im-
plicated in photic modulation of circadian
phase (10, 12, 13), as well as in dorsal root
ganglion neurons that are required for trans-
mission of itch information to GRPR in the
spinal cord (14). Consistent with our recent
study (15), we confirmed the specificity of the
GRP antibody using Grp knockout (KO) mice
(fig. S2). We found a notably reduced staining
intensity of GRP in SCNs of mice with con-
tagious itch behavior relative to controls (1 ±
0.1 versus 0.25 ± 0.04 normalized intensity, P <
0.001) (Fig. 2, F to H). Because immunohis-
tochemistry largely revealed GRP-expressing
fibers that arborize densely in the core and
shell of the SCN where Grpr expression is de-
tected (16), we used in situ hybridization to in-
vestigate whether Grp+ cells are located in the
core area (15). Consistent with previous studies
(10), Grp+ cell bodies were detected in the core,
but not the shell, of the SCN (Fig. 2, I and J). In
contrast, expression of arginine vasopressin
(AVP) was not affected after the contagious
itch test (P = 0.78) (Fig. 2, K to M).
The apparent depletion of GRP in the SCN
prompted us to ask whether GRP has a role in
contagious itch transmission. We first evaluated
contagious itch behavior in mice lacking Grp
(Grp KO) or Grpr (Grpr KO) (9). Grp or Grpr KO
mice showed almost no contagious scratching
behavior relative to their respective wild-type
littermates (7 ± 1 versus 1 ± 0.4 look-and-
scratches for Grp wild-type versus KO, 7 ± 1 ver-
sus 1 ± 0.3 look-and-scratches for Grpr wild-type
versus KO, P < 0.001), despite normal look
numbers (Fig. 3, A and B). The lack of imitative
scratching behavior was not due to the failure
of Grp or Grpr KO mice to scratch, because they
still retained the ability to scratch in response
to intradermal injection of histamine (Fig. 3C),
consistent with previous reports that the role
of GRP-GRPR signaling is largely restricted to
nonhistaminergic itch (14, 17).
To determine whether SCN GRPR is required
for contagious itch, we generated mice harboring
floxed Grpr (GrprF/y) (Fig. 3, D and E). To condi-
tionally delete Grpr in the SCN, we stereotactically
injected a viral vector encoding Cre recombinase
and enhanced green fluorescent protein (AAV2-
Syn-Cre-IRES-eGFP) bilaterally into the SCN of
GrprF/y mice or control Grprwt/y mice (Fig. 3F).

 To verify the site of the injection and expression
of Cre recombinase, we performed double immu-
nohistochemistry. Many neurons coexpressed
eGFP and GRPR in the SCN of Grprwt/y mice
(Fig. 3G). In contrast, almost no GRPR expres-
sion was detected in neurons expressing Cre-
eGFP (Fig. 3G). Relative to Grprwt/y mice, the
number of SCN GRPR+ neurons was signifi-
cantly reduced in GrprF/y mice (126 ± 7 versus
69 ± 3, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3H). Consistently, in situ
hybridization also showed decreased Grpr
expression in the SCN of GrprF/y mice relative
to Grprwt/y mice (fig. S3, A and B). Whereas
Grprwt/y mice showed normal contagious itch,
GrprF/y mice showed almost no imitative scratch-
ing behaviors (9.9 ± 1.5 versus 1.9 ± 0.8 look-and-
scratches, P < 0.001), despite normal look behavior
(P = 0.34) (Fig. 3I).
We selectively ablated SCN GRPR neurons
using bombesin-sap (BB-sap), a peptide conjugated
toxin that kills GRPR neurons in the spinal cord
(17, 18). After bilateral injection of BB-sap into the
SCN (fig. S4A), immunohistochemicstry showed
that BB-sap injection resulted in ablation of most
SCN GRPR+ neurons (145 ± 5 versus 37 ± 4, P <
0.001) (fig. S4, B and C). The effects of BB-sap–
induced Grpr neuronal ablation were also con-
firmed by in situ hybridization (fig. S5, A and B).
Although control mice exhibited normal imitative
scratching behavior as expected, mice treated with
BB-sap in the SCN barely showed imitative scratch-
ing behavior (7.7 ± 1.8 versus 1.3 ± 0.6 look-and-
scratches, P < 0.01) (fig. S4D). BB-sap treatment
did not affect the number of look behaviors rel-
ative to controls (P = 0.32) (fig. S4E). There was
no difference in acute itch behavior after hista-
mineinjection(P=0.43)orspontaneous scratches
(P = 0.86) in BB-sap SCN-treated mice relative to
controls (fig. S4, F and G).
We asked whether chemogenetic silencing
of Grp neuron activity could inhibit contagious
itch. A viral vector expressing Cre-dependent
Gi-coupled designer receptors exclusively ac-
tivated by designer drugs (DREADDs), hM4Di
(AAV5-EF1a-DIO-h4MDi-mCherry), or express-
ing AAV5-eGFP as a control was injected bilat-
erally into the SCN of Grp-Cre mice (fig. S4, H
and I). After clozapine N-oxide injection, mice
with h4MDi expression in Grp-Cre SCN neu-
rons displayed almost no imitative scratching
behavior, whereas eGFP control mice showed
normal imitative behaviors (7.7 ± 1.4 versus 1.6 ±
0.6 look-and-scratches, P < 0.01) (fig. S4J). Look
behavior was not significantly affected in the
h4MDi-expressing Grp-Cre mice relative to con-
trols (P = 0.16) (fig. S4K). Acute itch behavior
after histamine injection was also not affected
in h4MDi-expressing Grp-Cre mice relative to
controls (P = 0.83) (fig. S4L).
Next, we asked whether GRP transmits visual
input–encoded itch information. If so, artificial
activation of SCN GRPR neurons by GRP should
evoke mice to scratch without visual stimuli. We
unilaterally microinjected GRP (0.04 nmol per
200 nl) or saline into the SCN of mice through an
internal cannula. Exogenous GRP elicited vigorous
scratching that lasted ~1 hour, whereas mice in-
jected with saline showed little scratching (294 ±
73 versus 44 ± 9 scratches, P < 0.01) (Fig. 4, A and
B, and movie S3). The number of c-Fos+ neurons
in the SCN was significantly increased in mice
injected with GRP relative to controls (62 ± 7
versus 139 ± 10, P < 0.001) (Fig. 4, C and D). To
further test whether robust scratching behaviors
evoked by exogenous GRP could be attributed
exclusively to GRPR devoid of other nonspecific
effects, we microinjected GRP into the SCN of
Grpr KO mice and found that Grpr KO mice
showed little scratching behavior (fig. S6A). We
also microinjected GRP into BB-sap SCN-treated
mice that showed significantly fewer scratches
relative to control mice (fig. S6B).
Next, we activated SCN Grp neurons opto-
genetically (19). The SCN of Grp-Cre mice
was unilaterally injected with a viral vector
encoding
Cre-dependent
channelrhodopsin
(AAV2-Syn-DIO-ChR2-eYFP) or enhanced yel-
low fluorescent protein (eYFP) virus as a con-
trol, followed by fiber-optic implantation for
light stimulation (Fig. 4E). Immunohistochem-
istry confirmed that ChR2-eYFP virus in the
SCN was expressed in GRP+ neurons (Fig. 4F)
but not in VIP+ neurons (fig. S6C). Upon photo-
stimulation with blue light (wavelength 473 nm)
for 2 min at 30 Hz (power 10 mW), ChR2 mice

 exhibited scratching responses (movie S4),
whereas eYFP-control mice showed almost no
evoked scratching (17.2 ± 3.9 versus 0.6 ± 0.4
scratches, P < 0.001) (Fig. 4G). We observed a
frequency-dependent scratching response when
Grp-ChR2 neurons were photostimulated with
increasing frequencies of 10, 20, or 30 Hz (Fig.
4H). After 10 min of recovery, repeated stimu-
lations in ChR2 mice still evoked scratching
bouts, with ~75% of 10-, 20-, and 30-Hz stim-
ulations showing responses, yet eYFP control
mice displayed almost no scratching with re-
peated stimulation (fig. S5D). The mean onset
of scratching occurred within 30 s to 1 min of
stimulation for all frequencies, and all ChR2
mice tested showed evoked scratching behav-
iors (fig. S5E). The number of c-Fos neurons
in the SCN increased after stimulation of Grp-
ChR2–expressing neurons relative to eYFP
controls (66 ± 6 versus 126 ± 5, P < 0.001)
(Fig. 4, I and J).
We found that itch is contagious in mice. Our
results identify a previously unknown function
of SCN by revealing its critical role in contagious
itch transmission. Using cell type–specific inhi-
bition and activation, we discovered that SCN
GRP/GRPR neurons are key conduits for re-
ceiving, integrating, and transmitting visually
induced itch information. GRP depletion after
the contagious itch test supported the idea that
GRP is released from GRPergic fibers to activate
GRPR neurons. Exogenous GRP-induced scratch-
ing behavior is completely abolished in Grpr
KO mice. This underscores the specificity and
sufficiency of GRP-GRPR signaling in mediat-
ing contagious itch behavior within intra-SCN
circuits. SCN GRPR neurons may functionally be
heterogeneous. Alternatively, SCN GRPR neu-
rons could possess a dual function: one for photic
modulation and another for itch. Spinal and SCN
GRPR neural circuits represent the two parallel
pathways for transmission of itch (14, 18), in-
duced by cutaneous and visual stimuli, respec-
tively. Whether they may converge on the same
sensorimotor system to compute stereotyped
scratching is not yet known.
Scratching behavior in mice was induced by
mere observation of a conspecific scratching in a

 video; this finding provides evidence that conta-
gious itch is not a form of empathy, which in mice
appears to be restricted to familiars (20). Visual
cue–induced scratching action could be mimicked
by artificially stimulating SCN GRPR neurons,
which suggests that an automatic activation of
a cascade of neural circuits for itch, rather than
a manifestation in a higher cognitive/affective
capacity required for empathy, gives rise to con-
tagious itch (21). The discovery of SCN GRPR
circuits for itch permits in-depth dissection of
the input and output circuitry for itch transmis-
sion; previous studies have suggested that GRP
neurons receive non–image-forming photic in-
formation (10, 22). It will be important to probe
how visual input that encodes scratching action
activates SCN GRP neurons and how GRPR
neurons compute the output information (Fig.
4K). Given that myriad neural circuits are likely
modulated upon viewing the scratching mo-
tion, further research is necessary to elucidate
the discrete neural circuits subserving visual trans-
mission of scratching motion and/or motor
control. It will also be of interest to determine
whether SCN subcircuits may mediate other
types of socially contagious behaviors, such as
yawning or empathy for pain.
