Summary
Genome packaging into a protein capsid and its subsequent delivery into a host cell are two 
fundamental processes in the life cycle of a virus. Unlike dsDNA viruses which pump their 
genome into a preformed capsid1-3, ssRNA viruses, such as bacteriophage MS2, co-assemble their 
capsid with genome4-7; however, the structural basis of this co-assembly is poorly understood. 
MS2 infects Escherichia coli via host “sex” pilus (F-pilus)8 and is the first fully-sequenced 
organism9 and a model system for studies of gene translational regulations10,11, RNA-protein 
interactions12-14, and RNA virus assembly15-17. Its positive-sense ssRNA genome of 3569 bases is 
enclosed in a capsid with one maturation protein (MP) monomer and 89 coat protein (CP) dimers 
arranged in a T=3 icosahedral lattice18,19. MP is responsible for attaching the virus to an F-pilus 
and delivering the viral genome into the host during infection8, but how the genome is organized 
and delivered are not known. Here we show the MS2 structure at 3.6Å resolution determined by 
electron-counting cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) and asymmetric reconstruction. We traced 
~80% backbone of the viral genome, built atomic models for 16 RNA stem-loops, and identified 
three conserved motifs of RNA-CP interactions among 15 of these stem-loops with diverse 
sequences. The stem-loop at 3’ end of the genome interacts extensively with the MP, which, with 
just a six-helix bundle and a six-stranded β-sheet, forms a genome-delivery apparatus, and joins 89

 CP-dimers to form a capsid. This first atomic description of genome-capsid interactions in a 
spherical ssRNA virus provides insights into genome delivery via host “sex” pilus and 
mechanisms underlying ssRNA-capsid co-assembly, and inspires imaginations about links 
between nucleoprotein complexes and the origin of viruses.
We imaged MS2 particles embedded in vitreous ice with a K2 direct electron detector 
attached to the end of an energy filter in a Titan Krios electron microscope and averaged 
more than 330,000 particles to calculate a 3.6Å-resolution reconstruction without imposing 
any symmetry (Extended Data Fig. 1). The external structure of the asymmetric 
reconstruction (Fig. 1a) appears similar to the icosahedrally-averaged crystallographic 
structure of MS2, which contains 90 CP-dimers18,20. However, a small density bulge 
emerges at one of the 2-fold axes and its structure differs from all of the other 89 CP-dimers 
(Fig. 1b, Supplementary Video 1). Initial analysis of secondary structures of this asymmetric 
feature and more detailed amino-acid tracing indicated it to be an MP monomer. High-
resolution structural features in MP, such as side chains, are consistent with the estimated 
3.6Å resolution of the map (Fig. 1d).
The reconstruction also reveals the ssRNA genome density inside the capsid. This density is 
a bit noisy and somewhat broken in the 3.6Å resolution map but structural features typical of 
RNA are apparent when the map is low-pass filtered to 6Å resolution (Fig. 1c, 
Supplementary Video 1), indicating some flexibility of the RNA chain relative to the capsid 
shell. To sort out possible structural heterogeneity due to the flexible RNA, we carried out 
further three-dimensional (3D) classification of the dataset and obtained ten structures. 
These structures are almost identical to each other except for several short, possibly flexible, 
segments (Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Video 2). The RNA density is not 
uniformly distributed within the capsid, with the MP-proximal side of the space more 
densely packed than the distal side (Fig. 1c). The majority of the density shows prominent 
major and minor grooves (Fig. 1c), hallmarks of double helices, indicating that most of the 
ssRNA has folded into stem-loops. We identified over 50 stem-loops, most of which contact 
the capsid at the tip (i.e., the loop region) (Fig. 1c).
Among the stem-loops identified, 16 show clearly resolved individual nucleotides and even 
features that distinguish purines from pyrimidines (Fig. 1d). Such features enabled us to 
derive possible sequences for each stem-loop, which were used to search against the viral 
genome to identify its genuine sequence. Using the identified sequences of these 16 stem-
loops as landmarks across the genome, we were able to trace the backbone for more than 
80% of the genome, build atomic models for the 16 stem-loops, and identify long-range 
base-pairing and kissing-loop interactions (Fig. 2, Extended Data Figures 3-9, and 
Supplementary Data 1-3).
Among the 16 stem-loops, the one at 3’ end of the genome interacts with the MP and each of 
the remaining 15 binds to a CP-dimer (Extended Data Fig. 9). The 15 stem-loops vary 
greatly in their lengths and sequences (Fig. 3a). Comparison of the 15 stem-loop/CP-dimer 
structures reveals how these different stem-loops can be specifically recognized by the same 
CP during genome packaging. The non-sequence-specific, negatively-charged phosphates of 
the stem-loop RNA backbone interact with the CP-dimer through a patch of positively-

 charged/polar residues on the two CP monomers (Lys43, Arg49, Ser51, Lys57 and Lys61 of 
one CP, and Arg49, Ser51, Ser52, Asn55, Lys57 and Lys61 of the other) (Fig. 3b, c). At 
individual base level, three conserved motifs of RNA-CP interactions can be identified (Fig. 
3d, e, Supplementary Video 3). First, Thr45 and Ser47 of a CP hydrogen-bond with the base 
of a partially conserved nucleotide (red in Fig. 3a) in the RNA loop (Fig. 3e), preferably an 
A with two hydrogen bonds (e.g., A1757, Fig. 3e), and alternatively a C as in 3 of the 15 
cases with only one hydrogen bond (e.g., C109, Fig. 3h). Second, in 4 of the 15 cases 
(magenta in Fig. 3a), the Thr45 and Ser47 of the second CP also form two hydrogen bonds 
with an unpaired and sticking-out base (a purine in all these 4 cases) in the stem region (Fig. 
3d, f). But this purine has a flipped conformation as compared to that in the loop region (cf. 
A1751 in Fig. 3d or G2784 in Fig. 3f vs A1757 in Fig. 3e). Third, Tyr85 of one CP 
establishes an aromatic-ring stacking interaction with another base in the loop region (e.g., 
U1756, Fig. 3e). This base (green in Fig. 3a) is preferentially a pyrimidine, but is a purine in 
4 of the 15 cases. It can be either next to the Thr45/Ser47-interacting base (Fig. 3e), or 
separated by a spacer (Fig. 3g). The aromatic-ring stacking is usually extended to include 
another unpaired base (e.g., A1754, Fig. 3e) also in the loop region, before merging with the 
base-stacking in the stem region (Fig. 3e). In addition to accommodation of diversities in 
sequence, these stem-loops also utilize the above described non-sequence-specific 
interactions and conserved motifs to accommodate difference in local environments (Fig. 3i, 
j).
Although each of the over 50 stem-loops in the MS2 genome might act as a “packaging 
signal” for capsid assembly as previously proposed15-17,21, the higher resolution of the 
above 16 stem-loops indicates stronger interactions with capsid proteins, and thus perhaps a 
more important role in the capsid assembly. Three of these 16 stem-loops are consecutive in 
sequence (stem-loops 1714-1737, 1746-1764, and 1766-1806, Extended Data Fig. 8), cluster 
together (stem loops 1-3 in Extended Data Fig. 5) and bind three neighboring CP-dimers – a 
configuration desirable for nucleating capsid assembly. Indeed, the one in the middle of the 
three, which encompasses the start codon of the replicase gene, was proposed to nucleate 
capsid assembly12,22. Interestingly, the 16 stem-loops are non-uniformly distributed, with 
most of them clustered around the putative nucleation site (Fig. 2a). Because CP-dimers 
alone can assemble into both octahedral and wild-type-like icosahedral particles23, guidance 
by the RNA stem-loops in the early stage of capsid assembly might be the size-determining 
factor leading to the assembly of wild-type, icosahedral capsid.
One MP monomer replaces a CP-dimer at one of the icosahedral 2-fold axes, imparting 
structural changes to the neighboring CPs (Fig. 4a). The MP structure consists of an α-helix 
domain (aa. 140-225, 269-313, and 375-393) with a bundle of six α-helices, and a β-sheet 
domain (aa. 1-139, 226-268, and 314-374) with six anti-parallel β-strands sandwiched 
between an N-terminal loop and a helix-loop-helix motif (Fig. 4b). The MP is slightly tilted 
off the capsid surface with its α-helix domain inserting into the capsid lumen and its β-sheet 
domain projecting out (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Video 1).
MP has extensive (>20) interactions with one of the 16 high-resolution stem-loops of the 
genome structure, i.e., stem-loop 3540-3563 at the 3’ end of the genome (Fig. 4c, d). These 
interactions can be categorized into four types (Fig. 4e-h). First, phosphates in the RNA

 backbone can form charge-charge interactions with basic residues in MP (Lys50, Arg43, 62, 
358, and 229, Fig. 4e, f), or form hydrogen bonds with polar residues (Tyr60, Trp264, and 
Gln152, Fig. 4e, f, h) or even with amide of the protein backbone (Val141, Fig. 4f). Second, 
there are two cases of RNA base stacking with aromatic ring of the protein side chain: 
U3553 with Phe4, and U3557 with Trp54 (Fig. 4f, g). Third, there are multiple hydrogen 
bonds between RNA bases and protein side chains, primarily serines and threonines. These 
include interactions between U3549 and Thr47, U3552 and Asn45 (Fig. 4e), G3554 and 
Ser258/Thr324, G3555 and Ser58 (Fig. 4f). Lastly, seven hydrogen bonds are formed 
between RNA bases and carboxyl or amide groups of the protein backbone in the long loop 
connecting the first two β-strands of the MP (Fig. 4e, g). In this regard, Pro57 and Pro59 
(Fig. 4g) might be important in maintaining the twisted conformation of the protein 
backbone, preventing the formation of β-strand interactions in this segment, and freeing 
those carboxyl and amide groups for hydrogen-bonding with the RNA bases. It is also 
noteworthy that the base-pairing in the MP-bound state of this stem-loop is not optimal. If 
the MP binds to the RNA after the stem-loop has been folded, four base-pairs have to be 
melted and two new ones formed (Fig. 4d) to accommodate the RNA-MP interactions 
described above. How this dynamic process is achieved awaits further exploration.
This MP-interacting stem-loop also interacts with CP, albeit much less extensively and in a 
manner that bears no similarity to that of the other 15 stem-loop/CP-dimer structures. Two 
phosphates in the stem region of this stem-loop interact with the same CP (yellow in Fig. 
4h), one through a hydrogen bond with Asn27 and the other through charge-charge 
interaction with Arg49. Base C3548, which is sticking out from the loop region, forms a 
hydrogen bond with the terminal carboxylic acid group of Tyr129 of a second CP (beige in 
Fig. 4h). It may also stack with the Tyr129 aromatic ring in a third CP (purple in Fig. 4h).
Besides the extensive interactions with the 3’ end stem-loop, MP also binds the backbone of 
three other stem-loops with positively charged Arg and Lys residues (Fig. 5a, b). Three 
arginines in the β-sheet domain bind a very short stem-loop 3524-3532 in the 3’ untranslated 
region (3’-UTR) of the RNA. The other six arginines and two lysines are clustered at the tip 
of the α-helix bundle, binding stem-loops 1766-1806 and 1960-1995, with Arg188 inserted 
into the minor groove of stem-loop 1960-1995 (Fig. 5a).
During infection, MP is responsible for attaching the MS2 virion to the bacterial F-pilus and 
delivering the genome into the host8. Fitting our MS2 model into the structure of MS2/F-
pilus complex19 reveals interactions between F-pilus and the helix-loop-helix motif on one 
side of the β-sheet domain of MP with all β-strands nearly parallel to the pilus axis (Fig. 5c), 
resulting in slight tilting of the virion as observed previously19,24 (Fig. 5d). Our results shed 
light on why genome release occurs only when MS2 binds to F-pilus on a living 
bacterium25, but not when it binds to detached F-pilus8. Considering that F-pili in living 
bacteria are highly dynamic, with extension and retraction accompanied by rotation26, the 
driving force for MS2 genome delivery might come from the dynamics of, rather than the 
binding to, the F-pili. As the pilus retracts, the virion gets stuck outside the cell due to its 
relatively large size, but MP and its tightly-bound ssRNA genome are pulled together out of 
the capsid shell, leading to the delivery of this ribonucleoprotein complex into the host. 
Indeed, MP is delivered into host cell with the genome during infection27,28 while empty

 MS2 capsid is left outside29, and infectious ribonucleoprotein complexes can be 
reconstituted by mixing MP and ssRNA genome of MS230. One might even imagine that 
after the primitive “RNA world”, such a minimalist ribonucleoprotein complex could 
constitute a simple replicator to set the stage of evolution towards more sophisticated 
complexes. Selective pressure towards better fitness of the replicator naturally could have led 
to the acquisition of a protein coat to protect the RNA from a hostile environment.
Methods
Sample preparation
Coliphage MS2 (ATCC 15597-B1) and its host Escherichia coli strain C-3000 (ATCC 
15597) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Bacteria were 
cultured in ATCC-recommended broth media at 37°C, and infected with MS2 phage at 
middle log-phase. After complete lysis of the bacteria in a few hours, the lysate was 
centrifuged at 10,000g for 15min to remove cell debris, and then centrifuged again at 
100,000g for 4hr to pellet the phage particles. The pellet was resuspended in buffer 
containing 50mM Tris (pH7.5), 150mM NaCl, 5mM CaCl2 and 5mM MgCl2. The 
suspension was applied to an OptiPrep (Sigma-Aldrich) density gradient (10-50% w/v with 
10% steps) and centrifuged at 100,000g overnight. The phage band was clearly visible and 
was collected, diluted with buffer, and centrifuged at 100,000g for 4 hr. The purified phage 
particles were resuspended in 100μl buffer. To prepare cryoEM sample, an aliquot of 2.5 μl 
phage sample was applied to a Quantifoil grid, blotted with filter paper and plunge-frozen in 
liquid ethane with an FEI Vitrobot.
Cryo electron microscopy and movie preprocessing
CryoEM images were collected with Leginon31 on an FEI Titan Krios electron microscope 
equipped with Gatan imaging filter (GIF) and K2 Summit direct detection camera. A 
nominal magnification of 130,000x was used, giving a pixel size of 1.06Å/pixel at the 
sample level. A slit width of 20eV was set for the energy filter. Movies were recorded with 
the K2 camera operated in counting mode with an electron dose rate below 8e−/pixel/s. An 
accumulated dose of 50e−/Å2 on the sample was fractionated into a movie stack of 29 image 
frames.
For each of the total 6,080 movies recorded, the frames were aligned for drift correction 
with the method described previously32. The images averaged from all 29 frames were used 
for initial model searching and structure refinement, while images averaged from the first 14 
frames were used for calculation of the final density map. Defocus value was set to -2 μm 
during imaging session, and was determined with CTFFIND333 to be in the range of -0.5 to 
-3 μm in the images. Particles were picked with Ethan34 and preprocessed with EMAN35.
Asymmetric model generation
2D classification of particle images was performed with refine2d of EMAN. The resulted 2D 
class averages were used to calculate an initial model with the starticos command of 
EMAN35. The resulting reconstruction consists of two layers of smooth, featureless 
spherical shells, with the outer and inner layers corresponding to the averaged densities of

 the viral capsid and packaged RNA, respectively. This initial reconstruction was used to run 
3D classification of the images using Relion36, with C1 symmetry applied. Within less than 
10 iterations, one of the emerged 3D classes showed densities of separated RNA chains 
inside the capsid. 3D classification was then started over again with the converged RNA-
containing structure as initial model. All of the resulting 10 classes showed similar structures 
with prominent RNA densities, suggesting that the RNA genome was indeed well organized 
inside the capsid of MS2 phage and the initial model was solid.
It is noteworthy that two recent efforts in cryoEM reconstruction of a segmented dsRNA 
virus relied on subtraction of the icosahedrally symmetric capsid contribution from the raw 
cryoEM images to minimize interference of the symmetric capsid in the orientation search 
for the asymmetric components37,38. Our success in generating the asymmetric model of 
MS2 without applying such computation-demanding subtraction methods suggests that the 
asymmetric RNA genome has sufficient power to drive asymmetric orientation search even 
in the presence of icosahedral capsid signal. This simpler computational strategy opens the 
door to modeling viral genomes and genome-capsid interactions in spherical viruses.
Structure refinement
The dataset was divided into two random halves, and refined separately against the Relion-
generated model using Frealign39, considering that the latter software demands much less 
computational resources in processing such a large dataset. The refinement procedure 
included five rounds of grid search (mode 3) with data points lower than 20Å resolution, 
followed by several iterations of local refinement (mode 1) with gradually increased 
resolution range. Particle images binned for 4x or 2x were used throughout the refinement 
procedure to speed up calculations. The un-binned particle images from averaging 14 of the 
29 frames in the drift-corrected image stacks were used in the last few iterations of the 
refinement. A final density map was calculated by merging the two half datasets, containing 
a total number of 339,718 particles. The average resolution was determined based on the 
“gold-standard” FSC (Fourier shell correlation)=0.143 criterion40. Local resolutions were 
assessed with ResMap41 (Extended Data Fig. 1b).
Atomic model building for proteins
Atomic model of the maturation protein was built ab initio with Coot42. To model the coat 
proteins, the crystallographic structure with PDB ID 2MS220 was fitted into the density map 
with Chimera43, and then manually adjusted with Coot. Only 6 of the 178 copies of the coat 
protein needed partial modification. All the models were refined with Phenix real space 
refinement program44.
Backbone tracing and atomic model building for RNA
In modeling the 16 high-resolution RNA stem-loops, we took advantage of the available 
RNA moiety model in the crystallographic structure 2B2G45. This model was first fitted into 
our cryoEM densities, mutated into the genuine sequence, and then manually adjusted in 
Coot. For tracing the backbone of the genome, we low-pass filtered the density map to 6Å 
resolution so that the RNA backbone became visible and was manually traced with the baton 
mode in Coot. For some RNA densities that are weak in the final density map (i.e., flexible)

 but show better quality in some of the 10 classes from 3D classification, the density map of 
the best class was used to guide the backbone tracing.
Three constraints were used in conjunction to determine sequences of high-resolution stem-
loops and to trace the genome backbone simultaneously. First of all, at 3.6Å resolution, 
purines and pyrimidines are readily distinguishable based on the fact that densities of 
purines are relatively fattier than those of pyrimidines as exemplified in Fig. 1d. Therefore, a 
degenerate sequence can be derived for each stem-loop: R=A/G or Y=C/U was assigned to 
each nucleotide (nt) in high quality regions, while N=A/G/C/U was assigned to nt that has 
poor density. This degenerate sequence was then searched against the MS2 genome with the 
JDSA program46. With a typical length of 9-12nt for a high quality stem-loop, and 
considering that bases in the stem region should be paired (G-U was counted as paired in 
addition to the Watson-Crick pairs), the degenerate search usually produced fewer than 3 
candidates, and a single hit was not uncommon. Constraint from the backbone tracing was 
then used to further narrow down the candidate sequence and/or to confirm the assignment. 
For two tandem stem-loops in the path of the tracing, if their assigned sequences are also in 
tandem and have a distance in the genome agreeing with that in the tracing, then both 
assignments are likely correct. A third constraint we used to validate the sequence 
assignments and backbone tracing was the secondary structure prediction of the RNA 
sequence. Although the full-length MS2 genome of 3569 bases was too long for most RNA 
secondary structure prediction algorithms, we found that prediction results for sequences in 
the length of a few hundred bases are consistent among different prediction software and 
thus more reliable. Therefore, we divided the entire genome into several segments, predicted 
the secondary structure of each segment with the RNAfold webserver47, and compared it 
with the corresponding backbone as identified by the assigned sequences of the high-
resolution stem-loops contained in that segment. Matching of the predicted secondary 
structure and the traced backbone is evident for majority of the genome (Fig. 2c, d, Extended 
Data Fig. 3-7), thus confirming the validity of the backbone tracing and sequence 
assignments of the high-resolution stem-loops. From the correspondence between the traced 
backbone and the predicted secondary structure, we can also roughly assign sequences for 
most of the low-resolution stem-loops.
Modeling the high-resolution stem-loops individually was challenging due to the relatively 
low resolution of the genome structure. Ambiguity may arise from multiple results of the 
degenerate sequence search in some cases and also from generation of the degenerate 
sequence itself (i.e., ambiguity in assigning purine or pyrimidine to some of the nucleotides 
based on feature of the density at current resolution). Tracing backbone of the genome solely 
based on the 6Å resolution map is impractical because of numerous junctions and crossovers 
in the genome (see Fig. 2b for example). Our strategy combines the two levels of structural 
information with secondary structure prediction of the genome sequence to eliminate 
ambiguities by trial and error, dramatically improving reliability of the model. Such strategy 
is generally applicable for modeling genome organization in many other viruses.

Together with Fig. 2c, d, these figures show the backbone model of MS2 genome segment 
by segment from 5’ to 3’. The backbone of each segment is rainbow-coloured (blue to red) 
from 5’ to 3’. Atomic models of high-resolution stem-loops (ribbons) contained in the 
segment are also shown. Some of the base-pairings in the predicted secondary structure are 
modified to make it more consistent with the observed structure. Matching stem-loops in the 
backbone and in the predicted secondary structure are marked with the same number. 
Dashed boxes in some of the predicted secondary structure panels denote flexible stem-loops 
that are not well resolved in the cryoEM density map and thus not traceable for backbone.

 Figure 1. CryoEM asymmetric reconstruction of MS2 at 3.6Å resolution
a, b, Front (a) and back (b) views of the cryoEM density map along an icosahedral 2-fold 
symmetry axis with some 2-, 3- and 5-fold axes indicated. The capsid shell is radially 
coloured with MP highlighted in magenta, and ssRNA genome inside the capsid in blue. c, 
Cut-open view with half of the capsid shell removed to expose the genome. d, Segmented 
cryoEM densities (mesh) superimposed with their corresponding atomic models (sticks). 
Top and bottom-left panels are typical β-strand and α-helix densities from MP, respectively. 
The bottom-right panel is part of an MP-bound RNA stem-loop. Purines and pyrimidines are 
readily distinguishable.

 Figure 2. Modeling the ssRNA genome
a, Backbone structure of the genome (wire) and non-uniform distribution of the high-
resolution stem-loops (ribbons). Backbone of the genome is rainbow-coloured (blue to red) 
from 5’ to 3’. b-d, An example of tracing RNA backbone. Part of the genome density (grey 
in b) is segmented out and superimposed with its backbone model (rainbow-coloured wire, 
blue to red from 5’ to 3’) (b and c). For each of the two high-resolution stem-loops (ribbons 
in c) contained in this segment, a degenerate sequence was derived based on the resolved 
bases and used to search against the genome to identify sequence candidates. Each of these 
short sequence candidates was expanded in both directions to include ~500 bases for 
secondary structure prediction. The predicted secondary structure was then correlated with 
the backbone obtained in b and only one of these sequence candidates yielded correct 
sequence registration of individual stem-loops (indicated by numbers 1-7 in c and d). The 
backbone model reveals kissing-loop and long-range base-pairing interactions as indicated.

 Figure 3. Conserved interaction motifs between RNA stem-loops and CP-dimers
a, Secondary structures of the RNA stem-loops with nucleotides involved in the three types 
of conserved interaction motifs coloured. Letters beneath some of the stem-loops identify 
panels in which the atomic model for that stem-loop is shown. b-e, Atomic model of stem-
loop 1747-1763 and its interactions with a CP-dimer (pink and sky blue ribbons). In c, 
positively-charged or polar residues of the CP-dimer interacting with phosphates of the RNA 
backbone (sticks) are indicated. Zoom-in views of the stem (d) and loop (e) regions show 
the interaction motifs conserved among the 15 stem-loops. f-j, Accommodation of 
diversities in sequence or local environment. Stem-loop 2781-2796 (f), viewed in the same 
orientation as in d, shows that a G forms the same kind of hydrogen bonds with Thr45 and 
Ser47 as an A in d. Stem-loops 977-990 (g) and 102-114 (h), viewed in the same orientation 
as in e, show that a purine (G983 in g) instead of a pyrimidine (U1756 in e) stacks with 
Tyr85 and that a pyrimidine (C109 in h) forms only one hydrogen bond instead of a purine 
(A1757 in e) forming two hydrogen bonds with Thr45 and Ser47. Stem-loop 179-200 (i, j) 
binds to a CP-dimer from a very different angle due to steric hindrance of a neighboring 
stem-loop (not shown). Nonetheless, the RNA fold and one of the three interaction motifs 
are conserved, although hydrogen bonding with Thr59 instead of Ser47 is formed.

 Figure 4. MP and its interactions with the 3’-end stem-loop
a, Incorporation of MP in the capsid shell. MP (magenta) replaces a CP-dimer at a 2-fold 
symmetry axis and induces structural changes of neighboring CPs. Atomic models of the 
changed CPs (coloured ribbons) are superimposed with that of CPs at other 2-fold symmetry 
axes (beige ribbons) which are unaffected by the MP. b, MP model rainbow-coloured (blue 
to red from N- to C-terminus). c, Binding of the 3’-end stem-loop to MP and neighboring 
CPs as viewed inside the capsid. d, Base-pairing in the 3’-end stem-loop as observed in our 
structure interacting with MP (right), or theoretically as free stem-loop (left). e-h, Details of

 Figure 5. Binding of MP to the genome and to bacterial F-pilus
a, Overview of MP (magenta) with surrounding RNA stem-loops (wires coloured as in Fig. 
2a) shown in the same orientation as in Fig. 3c. b, Same as a but without the RNA backbone 
model, showing the distribution of positively-charged arginine and lysine residues in MP 
that bind RNA stem-loops. c, d, Fitting our atomic models (ribbons) of the MS2 virion into a 
tomographic reconstruction (EMD-2365, semitransparent surface) of MS2 attached to 
bacterial F-pilus19. MP obliquely projects out from the capsid surface, resulting in a slight 
tilt (~9°) of the MS2 virion when attached to the F-pilus (d).
