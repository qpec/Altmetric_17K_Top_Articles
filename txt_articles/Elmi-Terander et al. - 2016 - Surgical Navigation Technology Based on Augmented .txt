Study Design. A cadaveric laboratory study.
Objective. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility
and accuracy of thoracic pedicle screw placement using
augmented reality surgical navigation (ARSN).
Summary of Background Data. Recent advances in spinal
navigation have shown improved accuracy in lumbosacral
pedicle screw placement but limited benefits in the thoracic
spine. 3D intraoperative imaging and instrument navigation may
allow improved accuracy in pedicle screw placement, without
the use of x-ray fluoroscopy, and thus opens the route to image-
guided minimally invasive therapy in the thoracic spine.
Methods. ARSN encompasses a surgical table, a motorized flat
detector C-arm with intraoperative 2D/3D capabilities, integrated
optical cameras for augmented reality navigation, and noninvasive
patient motion tracking. Two neurosurgeons placed 94 pedicle
screws in the thoracic spine of four cadavers using ARSN on one
side of the spine (47 screws) and free-hand technique on the
contralateral side. X-ray fluoroscopy was not used for either
technique. Four independent reviewers assessed the postoperative
scans, using the Gertzbein grading. Morphometric measurements of
the pedicles axial and sagittal widths and angles, as well as the
vertebrae axial and sagittal rotations were performed to identify risk
factors for breaches.
Results. ARSN was feasible and superior to free-hand technique
with respect to overall accuracy (85% vs. 64%, P < 0.05),
specifically significant increases of perfectly placed screws (51% vs.
30%, P< 0.05) and reductions in breaches beyond 4mm (2% vs.
25%, P< 0.05). All morphometric dimensions, except for vertebral
body axial rotation, were risk factors for larger breaches when
performed with the free-hand method.
Conclusion. ARSN without fluoroscopy was feasible and demon-
strated higher accuracy than free-hand technique for thoracic
pedicle screw placement.

P
lacement of pedicle screws is challenging and poses
risks, as vital portions of the spinal anatomy and
neurovascular structures are not visible to the sur-
geon. Traditionally, pedicle screw placement with free-hand
technique relies on anatomical landmarks and preoperative
imaging. X-ray fluoroscopy is frequently used to provide
guidance and confirm adequate screw placement, despite
radiation exposure to the medical staff and patients. Surgi-
cal navigation systems coupled with intraoperative volu-
metric imaging are used for various clinical applications in
spine surgery, requiring pedicle screw placement.1 Current
systems typically consist of an infrared-camera tracking unit
linked to an intraoperative computed tomography (CT) and
a reference frame attached to the spinous vertebral process
for registration and tracking purposes.2

 Commercially available surgical navigation systems have
shown superiority in pedicle screw placement when com-
pared with free-hand technique in the lumbosacral region.2
In the thoracic spine, pedicle screw placement accuracy
remains a challenge because of the morphology (e.g., smaller
pedicle size).3–8 Lateral or medial cortical breaches in
thoracic pedicles can potentially yield severe clinical com-
plications due to the proximity of critical structures.9
Recently, cardiothoracic, cerebrovascular, and abdomi-
nal vascular surgeries have pioneered device navigation in
hybrid operating rooms (H-OR). In an H-OR, an operating
table is interconnected to a motorized flat panel detector C-
arm with 2D/3D imaging, along with x-ray based image
guidance tools.10,11 In this study, we introduce an H-OR
surgical navigation platform with optical cameras for aug-
mented reality in intraoperative imaging and tracking. The
optical platform was integrated with the standard flat
detector frame of a motorized C-arm. We assessed the
feasibility and accuracy of pedicle screw placement in the
thoracic spine comparing ARSN with free-hand technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The study was conducted in compliance with the ethical
guidelines for human cadaver studies. Body donors allowed
their bodies or body parts to be used for research and
educational purposes. Two senior consultant neurosurgeons
with expertise in cervical and upper thoracic spinal fixation
performed all surgical procedures.
Four human cadavers with no history of spine surgery
were used. The cadavers were placed prone on the surgical
table. Radiological examinations of the spine revealed that
two of the cadavers had a rotatory deformity of the upper
thorax (up to 158 axial rotation). The other two cadavers
had normal spinal anatomy. The whole dorsal thoracic
region was exposed after performing a midline incision
followed by complete bilateral dissection and retraction
of the paraspinal musculature down to the spinous processes
and tips of the transverse processes.
Pedicle screws of 3.5 or 4.5 mm in diameter (Medtronic,
Minneapolis, MN) were introduced in the thoracic spines
with the ARSN technology unilaterally (left or right) and
with free-hand technique on the contralateral side. The
screws were placed in the cranio-caudal direction three
spinal levels at a time, always beginning with free-hand
technique by one surgeon and subsequently switching to the
contralateral side, where another surgeon used ARSN to
position the screws. Each surgeon operated on either side
and with either technique.
Augmented Reality Surgical Navigation Technique
The study was conducted in a hybrid room equipped with a
Maquet surgical table (Alphamaquet 1150, Maquet AG,
Switzerland) connected to a motorized ceiling-mounted C-
arm flat detector system, enabling high-resolution cone-beam
CT acquisition (AlluraClarity FD20; Philips Healthcare, Best,
the Netherlands). The navigation system, developed by Philips
Healthcare, consisted of four high resolution (5 megapixels)
opticalvideocamerasmounted in the frameof the flatdetector
and directed toward the isocenter of the C-arm (Figure 1).
Before starting the procedure, 8 to 10 sterile, flat,
adhesive circular markers were randomly placed on the skin
around the surgical site after skin incision and surgical
exposure of the whole thoracic spine. The markers were
specifically designed to be tracked by the system. A

 minimum of five markers had to be in the field of view of the
cameras for patient tracking. In order to compensate for any
motion, a mesh model generated by interconnecting the
markers was used throughout the procedure as a patient
tracking model (Figure 2).
The flat detector could cover multiple vertebrae in one
single rotational scan.12 Three spinal levels were imaged by
a 3D cone beam CT (CBCT) acquisition. The C-arm rotated
1808 in 20 seconds, and within 15 seconds, a 3D recon-
structed volume with 0.5 mm voxel size was displayed as

 1 mm thickness axial and sagittal slice views with a contrast
resolution of 3 to 5 HU. The spine was automatically seg-
mented (i.e., the spine bony contour delineated) and dis-
played as a 3D volume in addition to two orthogonal
projections, in order to enable planning of pedicle screw
insertion path. Virtual screw size and placement could be
modified on the 3D workstation (Figure 3). All images were
displayed on a 58-inch high definition medical monitor.
The C-arm automatically rotated into one of the four
possible positions where an optical camera was aligned
along the planned axis of insertion. The other three optical
cameras provided angulated views for the alignment of the
devices. The screw path was overlaid on the optical camera
views depicting the intended device alignment as well as 2D
slices or 3D volume rendering from the acquired CBCT
(Figure 4). The optical and intraoperative images were
automatically registered and therefore the operator did
not interact with the system for registration. During screw
insertion, the optical overlay provided real-time feedback to
the operator. X-ray fluoroscopy was not used.

 CBCT was performed to evaluate the position of the
inserted screws. Angulated scans were used in order to
minimize metal artifacts (Figure 5).
Free-Hand Surgical Technique
The entry point was identified using posterior anatomical
landmarks. An awl was used to perforate the cortical bone.
A gearshift probe was subsequently advanced in the can-
cellous
bone
to
create
a
path
in
which
the
screw
was inserted.
Pedicle Screw Accuracy Evaluation
Postoperative CBCT images were transferred to a PACS
system without any annotation or indication of screw place-
ment technique (Figure 6). Two independent neurosurgeons
and two radiologists assessed screw positions using the
Gertzbein grading: grade 0 (screw within the pedicle with-
out cortical breach), grade 1 (0–2 mm breach, minor per-
foration including cortical encroachment), grade 2 (2–4 mm
breach, moderate breach), and grade 3 (more than 4 mm
breach, severe displacement).13 The raters could modify the
window width and level as well as the 3D volume display
and multi-planar reconstruction.
Morphological Assessment
In order to evaluate potential factors that induced breach-
ing, we measured the axial and sagittal widths and angles of
each pedicle, as well as the axial and sagittal rotations of
each vertebral body on the planning CBCT (Figure 3).14
Statistical Analysis
Two-way intraclass correlation coefficient for absolute
interrater agreement (IA) was calculated with 95% confi-
dence interval (95% CI) to assess the absolute agreement
among the four raters in grading the screw position
accuracy. An IA below 0.40, between 0.40 and 0.59,
between 0.60 and 0.74, and above 0.75 corresponded to
poor, fair, good, and excellent agreement, respectively.15
Continuous variables were expressed as means and standard
deviations, whereas ordinal and categorical variables as
frequencies, ratios, or percentages.
The median value of the grades for each pedicle was
considered as the consensus grade for further data analysis.
One-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare
accuracy for both groups, and Fisher’s exact test was used
for nominal variables comparison. Relative risks (RRs)
along with 95% CI were calculated. We used one-tailed
ordinal Spearman’s correlation (r) to identify which of the
morphological factors correlated with breaching. Statistical
analysis was performed using Matlab R2015a (Mathworks,
Natick, MA). A P value (P) less than 0.05 was considered
as significant.
RESULTS
The IA was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70–0.84) indicating excellent
IA. Grades 0 screw placement was roughly 71% more
frequent with ARSN (P < 0.05), grade 1 and 2 were stat-
istically similar for both methods, and a significantly
(P < 0.05) lower amount of grade 3 was achieved with
Figure 6. Example of anonymized oblique axial, sagittal, and coronal slices along pedicle screw axis for grading. Note that the type of surgical
technique was blinded to the rater. The ability of visualizing three different slices simultaneously helped to appreciate cortical encroachment.

 ARSN (Table 1). Accuracy was significantly higher in the
ARSN group (85%, 40/47) than the free-hand group (64%,
30/47) yielding an RR ¼ 1.33 (95% CI: 1.04–1.71). ARSN
demonstrated higher accuracy than free-hand technique
analyzed pairwise for each level (P ¼ 0.0008). Twenty-three
vertebral bodies showed larger breaches with free-hand
technique than ARSN (Table 2). For both techniques,
two screws were displaced medially; at T5 and T12 with
ARSN, T4 and T11 with free-hand. Table 3 summarizes the
spinal levels were cortical encroachment (grade 1) and
displaced screws (grades 2 and 3) were observed along with
direction of displacement.
The correlation factors between the morphological
dimensions of each pedicle and the grade of screw placement
are summarized in Table 4. The accuracy of screw place-
ment with ARSN did not show statistical correlation with
any of the morphometrical factors except for the pedicle
axial width suggesting higher breaching for smaller pedicle
axial width. Screws placed with the free-hand technique
negatively correlated with smaller pedicle widths (i.e.,
decreasing grade values with increasing width) and posi-
tively correlated with larger pedicle angles. Vertebral body
sagittal rotation demonstrated the highest correlation
(r ¼ 0.51).
DISCUSSION
This study proved that accurate spinal pedicle screw place-
ment was feasible using augmented reality surgical naviga-
tion technology. In the thoracic spine, the achieved accuracy
(85%) with ARSN was significantly (P < 0.05) better than
screw placement with free-hand technique.
The ARSN system comprises navigation technology inte-
grated in the flat detector frame, eliminating the need for
stand-alone imaging and navigation equipment.2 Several
levels can be planned with the same degree of accuracy,
without the need for invasive dynamic reference frame
positioning and recalibrations. Several other studies have
highlighted technical reasons for inaccurate screw place-
ment. For example, screw misplacement correlated with the
increased distance from the treated vertebral body to the
reference frame, infrared cameras obstructed the line of
sight, calibration errors occurred, and inadvertently touch-
ing the reference frame caused registration error.6,7,16
Besides the advantage of being noninvasive, the ARSN
technology utilizes a patient tracking algorithm that ident-
ifies the location of flat adhesive markers placed on the skin.
The markers are tracked, as long as at least five markers are
still visible from any of the four cameras, thus minimizing
the risk for obstruction of the line of sight between the
markers and the cameras.
The accuracy between navigation systems and free-hand
technique for thoracic screw placement has been compared

 in other studies.5,6,17–21 In this context, it should be noted
that in our study, the screw placement grading was more
rigorous than in comparable studies. We used three different
views (axial, coronal, and sagittal) to identify any potential
breach in any direction and were thus more likely to identify
a subtle breach not visible on axial views only (cf. Figure 6).
Despite this, our results with both techniques were compar-
able to published data (cf. Table 5). In one case, we observed
a grade 3 breach when using ARSN, whereas the contrala-
teral screw was grade 0. In this case, it was impossible to
properly access the entry point due to the local anatomy (a
cortical ridge displaced the screw).
Few studies have evaluated IA with values ranging from
0.45 to 0.85, with a single study showing excellent agree-
ment (i.e., above 0.75).22 Our study demonstrated an IA of
0.78 (excellent agreement), which is paramount for the
reliability of the grading.
The accuracy values in literature summarized in Table 5
correspond to large cohorts and consequently yield more
experience with the used technology, whereas the surgeons
in this study did not have prior training in ARSN. The
learning process of current navigation systems can be slow
when transitioning from conventional surgical methods.23,24
Rivkin and Yocom23 evaluated the accuracy after every 15
consecutive patients undergoing spinal surgeries in the thor-
acolumbar region and showed a linear increase in accuracy
from 82.9% after 15 cases to 98.9% after 270 cases, using a
Stealth Station navigation system with O-arm CT imaging
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Ryang et al.24 concluded the
same by looking at each quarter (average of 40 screws per
quarter) for a year time span and found an increase in
accuracy in thoracic spine starting from 55% after 40 screws
up to 87.5% after a total of 192 screws placed, using the
Vector
Vision
navigation
system
(Brainlab,
Munich,
Germany) with Siemens Orcadis C-arm with CBCT intra-
operative imaging. In our study, we found an 85% accuracy
after only 47 screws insertion (22 and 25 per surgeon). The
Gertzbein grading is a tool for accuracy and not a surrogate

 for clinical outcome. In fact, Gautshi et al.9 showed in a
literature review that no complications (dural lesions, nerve
root injuries, etc.) were observed in studies where accuracy
was as low as 78%. Therefore, care should be taken not to
correlate clinical impact and accuracy grading.
Several
studies
have
highlighted
the
anatomical
challenges for the upper thoracic (i.e., Th1–6) parts
where pedicles can be in average as small as 4 mm in
width, and there is a wide variety of interpatient pedicle
angle/axis.14
Most
studies
evaluated
the
correlation
between accuracy and the spinal level; however, we
decided to assess the correlation between accuracy and
each anatomical dimension, as it seems to give a better
understanding of the risk factors for breaching; each
spinal level can have a wide interpatient variability.5,8,14
In the free-hand group, morphometrics of the pedicles and
the spinal curvatures were risk factors (cf. Table 4),
whereas in the ARSN group, the pedicle axial width
was the only risk factor. The 3D cone beam CT provides
spatial information that allows to cope with the various
angulations of the pedicles and spine allowing a more
accurate surgical tool placement during the procedural
phase of screw insertion. The pedicle axial width is the
only risk factor for breaching that is explained by the fact
that the smaller the pedicle width, the higher the odd to
breach, especially when using a screw size (e.g., 3.5 mm in
diameter) that barely fits in the pedicle (e.g., 3 mm in
diameter) causing cortical encroachment.
ARSN does not rely on perioperative x-ray fluoroscopy
but on optical tracking. As there is no radiation during the
screw placement, there is no need for protective lead aprons
during surgery. Only one single cone beam CT is needed to
perform the planning of the screw placement using ARSN
that would be the only source of patient dose. However, one
can take the advantage of being able to perform a post-
operative cone beam CT in an H-OR before closing the
wounds to revise potential malpositioned screws in order to
avoid reoperations.
Limitations of our study include the small sample size and
procedural time. Further investigation is required to
quantify the learning curve effect. Another limitation is that
the study was performed on cadavers and not patients with
present spinal pathologies. The effect of patient ventilation
on patient tracking accuracy has to be assessed. Other
studies showed reduction of screw placement accuracy from
respiratory movement.16 Radiation dose to cadavers from
the 3D cone beam CT acquisition was not evaluated, which
is another limitation that needs to be addressed in
future studies.
CONCLUSION
H-OR with integrated optical-based augmented reality
navigation on a C-arm imaging system allowed thoracic
screw placement with an accuracy of 85% for thoracic
pedicle screw placement without prior training of the
operating surgeons. Matched for complexity level, the
accuracy was 33% higher than free-hand technique
(85% vs. 64%, P < 0.05). There was no periprocedural
fluoroscopy.
Key Points
Thoracic pedicle screw placement using an
optical-based navigation technology with
augmented reality and integrated intraoperative
imaging is feasible.
Patient tracking for spinal navigation with
noninvasive, flat adhesive markers placed on the
skin is feasible.
The overall accuracy of pedicle screw placement
with the ARSN system was significantly better
than with the free-hand surgical technique (85%
vs. 64%, P < 0.05).
The ARSN system eliminates the need for
periprocedural x-ray fluoroscopy.
