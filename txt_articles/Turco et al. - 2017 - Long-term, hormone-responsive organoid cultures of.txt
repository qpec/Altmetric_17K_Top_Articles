Abstract
In humans, the endometrium, the uterine mucosal lining, undergoes dynamic changes throughout 
the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Despite the importance of the endometrium as the site of 
implantation and nutritional support for the conceptus, there are no long-term culture systems that 
recapitulate endometrial function in vitro. We adapted conditions used to establish human adult

 stem cell-derived organoid cultures to generate 3D cultures of normal and decidualised human 
endometrium. These organoids expand long-term, are genetically stable and differentiate following 
treatment with reproductive hormones. Single cells from both endometrium and decidua can 
generate a fully functional organoid. Transcript analysis confirmed great similarity between 
organoids and the primary tissue of origin. On exposure to pregnancy signals, endometrial 
organoids develop characteristics of early pregnancy. We also derived organoids from malignant 
endometrium, and so provide a foundation to study common diseases, such as endometriosis and 
endometrial cancer, as well as the physiology of early gestation.
Throughout adult reproductive life, the functional layer of the human endometrium 
undergoes a monthly cycle of regeneration, differentiation and shedding under the control of 
the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. The mucosa contains simple glands lined by 
secretory columnar epithelium, separated by intervening stroma. During the estrogen-
dominated proliferative phase that follows menstruation, the mucosa regrows and then 
differentiates during the progesterone-dominated secretory phase. Implantation occurs ~7 
days post-ovulation onto the ciliated luminal epithelium and stimulates transformation into 
the gestational endometrium, the true decidua of pregnancy, that provides a 
microenvironment essential for placentation. Up to ~10 weeks gestation, uterine glands 
provide histotrophic nutrition for the conceptus before the definitive hemochorial placenta is 
established1, 2. Animal models in mice and ruminants where glandular function is 
suppressed are unable to support implantation and pregnancy3, 4. Such models have 
revealed the molecular interactions involved between the trophectoderm and the uterine 
surface and the key cytokines secreted by the glands, such as leukemia inhibitory factor5. 
However, the composition of the secretions, and the gland/conceptus signalling dialogue 
during human placentation are unknown due to their inaccessibility in vivo and the absence 
of in vitro models. Suboptimal glandular development and/or functions may result in human 
pregnancy failure or predispose to complications of later pregnancy, such as growth 
restriction6. Thus, model systems to study these essential processes of human early 
pregnancy would have many biological and clinical applications.
Although stem/progenitor cells within the stromal compartment of the endometrium have 
been identified, suitable markers for glandular progenitors are unknown7. In mice, stem cells 
are probably present at the base of the glands8; similarly in primates, cells in the basal layer, 
that is not shed during menstruation, can generate both glandular and luminal epithelia9, 10. 
In humans, putative endometrial stem cells are the rare SSEA-1+, SOX9+ population with 
clonogenic ability11, 12 but these are not fully characterised and it is unknown how they 
maintain uterine glands. Previous culture systems of human endometrial glandular cells, 
including 3D cultures, do not fully recapitulate glandular features in vivo, and are not long-
term or chemically defined13, 14. Establishing defined endometrial organoid cultures will 
offer possibilities for studying events during implantation and early pregnancy in vitro as 
human blastocysts can be cultured past the implantation phase of development15, 16.
Organoids are self-organising, genetically stable, 3D culture systems containing both 
progenitor/stem and differentiated cells that resemble the tissue of origin. Human organoids 
have been derived from tissue-resident adult epithelial stem cells from gut, liver, pancreas,

 prostate and fallopian tube17–21. We have now generated long-term, chemically-defined 3D 
glandular organoid cultures from non-pregnant endometrium and decidua. The organoids 
recapitulate features of uterine glands in vivo; the ability to respond to hormonal signals, 
secrete components of uterine ‘milk’ and differentiate into ciliated luminal epithelial cells. 
Human endometrial organoids can be used to answer questions about uterine/placental 
cross-talk during placentation, and will provide a system for studying the pathogenesis and 
treatment of common conditions affecting women, such as endometriosis and endometrial 
cancer.
Results
Long-term genetically-stable 3D organoid cultures can be established from human non-
pregnant endometrium and decidua
To generate endometrial organoids, we used tissue isolates enriched for epithelial cells, and 
allowed these to self-organise within Matrigel droplets with the basal medium that supports 
development of other human tissue organoids, containing EGF, Noggin and R-spondin-1 
(ENR) (Fig. 1a). Because the signalling pathways maintaining endometrial gland stem/
progenitor cells are unknown, we tested factors secreted by surrounding stromal cells, 
FGF10 and HGF22–25. Nicotinamide and the Alk3/4/5 inhibitor, A83-01, that blocks the 
TGFβ pathway were added as they are crucial in the establishment and/or long-term culture 
of other human organoid systems18, 20, 26. Decidual samples were initially used to 
optimise the culture conditions as they yield high cell numbers. Glandular cells were 
cultured for 7 days and passaged at 1:3. Organoid numbers were counted after another 7 
days (Fig. 1b,c). A83-01, FGF10 and HGF with EGF, Noggin, R-spondin-1 and 
nicotinamide, expansion medium (ExM), gave the highest yield of cells (Fig. 1c, C8).
Organoid cultures were established in ExM within 1-2 passages (Fig. 1d). To assess the 
requirement for each culture component, 5000 cells were plated from established cultures 
(grown for >4 passages) in the absence of each factor, and the number of spheroids present 
after one week counted. Withdrawal of nicotinamide had the strongest effect, whilst the lack 
of Noggin, Rspondin-1, A83-01, EGF and HGF resulted in reduced numbers and/or smaller 
organoids (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 1a). FGF10 was maintained in the medium even 
though it had no effect on size or numbers of organoids (Fig. 1e), because it was important 
initially in establishing cultures and provides a physiological environment (Fig. 1b). ENR, 
A83-01 and nicotinamide will maintain established cultures, but were not tested in 
differentiation experiments and long-term culture (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Organoid 
cultures were robustly established from decidual samples in ExM from 25/26 donors 
(derivation efficiency of 96%). Organoids were then successfully generated from non-
pregnant secretory endometrium with 100% derivation efficiency (11/11) (Fig. 1f). 
Proliferative phase endometrium is infrequently sampled, but we did generate organoids 
from this phase (n=3) and from atrophic endometrium (n=1), demonstrating that our culture 
conditions can be used for tissue throughout the menstrual cycle, as well as pregnant and 
post-menopausal endometrium (Fig. 1f). The origin and characterization of established 
organoid cultures used for this study are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

 The established organoids can be expanded at passage ratios of 1:2 or 1:3 every 7-10 days 
for >6 months (reaching more than a 106-fold increase in the number of organoids). Markers 
of glandular epithelium (MUC1, E-CADHERIN, CK7 and EPCAM) are strongly expressed 
by the organoids (Fig. 1g,h,i). EPCAM and LAMININ are present at the baso-lateral 
membrane, showing epithelial polarity is intact (Fig. 1i). EdU pulse-labelling shows ~30% 
of cells are actively replicating (Fig. 1i). The organoids form cystic structures lined by 
columnar epithelium with secretions visible in the lumen. Electron microscopy reveals a 
microvillous, pseudostratified columnar epithelium supported by amorphous basement 
membrane material with basally-located nuclei (Fig. 1j). The cytoplasm contains plentiful 
rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies, numerous secretory vesicles, with evidence 
of secretory activity from the apical surface (Fig. 1k, arrowheads). A major component of 
endometrial glandular secretions, glycogen, was visualized by vivid PAS staining (Fig. 1l). 
Thus, the appearances are highly similar to endometrial glands in vivo27.
Next, the chromosomal stability of our endometrial organoids was checked by Comparative 
Genomic Hybridization (CGH) array. Genomic DNAs were compared between the patient 
and established organoid cultures at early passage (p) (2-4p) and between early and late 
cultures (8-15p) (Supplementary Fig. 1d-f). No significant DNA copy number abnormalities 
were identified during derivation or after continuous passaging for up to 5 months. These 
organoids can be frozen, thawed and regrown, allowing bio-banking of human endometrial 
cultures.
Established human endometrial gland organoids recapitulate molecular signature of 
glands in vivo
To assess the similarity between organoids and the tissue of origin, we analysed the global 
gene expression profiles from established organoid lines (n=7), initial glandular digests, and 
cultured stromal cells from the same biopsy. Staining for MUC1 (glands) and VIMENTIN 
(stroma) confirmed enrichment of glands in our isolates and the purity of stromal cultures 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a-d). Hierarchical clustering analysis based on 15,475 probes (sd/
mean >0.1) shows that the organoid cultures cluster more closely to glands than to stroma, 
confirming their glandular epithelial nature (Fig. 2a).
To define an endometrial glandular genetic signature, we compared glands and organoids to 
stroma. 287 genes were commonly upregulated in organoids and glands compared to stroma 
with a fold change of ≥1.5 (p≤0.01) (Fig. 2b). Gene ontology (GO) analysis shows 
enrichment for ‘epithelial identity’ and ‘glandular function’ (Fig. 2c,d). Markers of epithelial 
cells (CDH1, CLDN10 and EPCAM), mucosal secretory cells (PAX8 and MUC1) and of 
uterine glandular products were all present (PAEP, KLK11 and MUC20) (Fig. 2e). Murine 
genes involved in endometrial glandular development and function (FoxA2, Sox17 and Klf5) 
also emerged4, 28–31. Using immunohistochemistry, we verified nuclear presence of 
FOXA2, SOX17 and PAX8 in all organoids and endometrial glandular cells throughout the 
cycle (Fig. 2f). Markers (PROM1, AXIN2 and LRIG1) common to other epithelial 
progenitor cells32, 33 were found (Fig. 2e), but in endometrium LRIG1 transcripts are 
present in glands and luminal epithelium throughout the cycle and so their significance is 
uncertain (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 3a). Analysis of expression of other putative

 endometrial stem cell markers, AXIN2 and SSEA1 was inconclusive11. Although AXIN2 
transcripts were found in glands in vivo, lack of a reliable antibody prevented further 
analysis (Supplementary Fig.3b). Only a few cells were SSEA-1+ in organoids, analysed by 
immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry (2-3%) and, after sorting SSEA-1+/- cells, 
organoids emerged from the SSEA-1-negative fraction (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Overall 
the gene signature of decidual organoids (n=6) is also very similar to non-pregnant 
endometrium (Supplementary Fig. 4a), with immunostaining of FOXA2, SOX17 and PAX8 
and expression of LRIG1 uniformly similar to ex vivo decidual glands (Supplementary Fig. 
4b,c).
Apart from shared gene sets between glands and organoids, there are also genes only 
expressed in glands (421/652) or organoids (286/484) (Supplementary Fig. 5). GO terms for 
glands describe stromal interactions (integrin binding and extracellular matrix structural 
constituents), all absent in vitro. For organoids, in vitro proliferation, (cell division and 
mitotic nuclear division) dominated. Thus, differential gene expression between gland 
samples and organoids reflects their contrasting microenvironments.
A converse analysis to define a stromal cell signature (Supplementary Fig. 2e) revealed 
minimal contamination from endothelial cells (CD31 or CD34) or leukocytes (CD45). GO 
analysis showed ‘biological processes’ typical of fibroblasts and ‘molecular functions’ 
(Supplementary Fig. 2f, g). Gene sets were enriched for stromal cell markers (THY1, NT5E 
and IFITM1)34, 35, extracellular matrix proteins (COL8A1, COL12A1, COL13A1 and 
LAMA1), and metalloproteinases (MMP11, MMP2, MMP12, MMP27, MMP3, TIMP2 and 
CTGF) (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Genes encoding for components of WNT (WNT2, 
WNT5A, RSPO3), BMP (BMP2, GREM1) and MAPK (FGF2) signalling pathways also 
emerged, pathways already identified from our culture conditions.
Human endometrial gland organoids respond to sex hormones
Unlike other mucosal epithelia, the endometrium responds dramatically to ovarian 
hormones, estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4), which regulate cyclical proliferation and 
differentiation of endometrial glands with concomitant dynamic temporal and spatial 
expression of their receptors, ERα and PR (Fig. 3a)36–38. Following menstruation, glands 
increase expression of ERα in response to rising E2 levels (proliferative phase). After 
ovulation, ERα expression declines in the early secretory phase whereas PR is maintained 
until mid-secretory (LH+7), after which both ERα and PR expression disappears37.
To mimic the response of the organoid cultures to hormones, we exposed organoids to E2 
followed by P4 (Fig. 3b). Under ExM conditions most cells show weak expression of ERα 
(ERαlow) with some ERαhigh (Fig. 3c, arrowheads) and ERαnegative cells (Fig. 3c, arrows) 
present. Although most organoids are PRnegative, a few cells are PRhigh; on serial sections 
these are also ERαhigh. After exposure to E2 and P4, high expression of both ERα and PR is 
seen in most organoids similar to the situation in vivo (Fig. 3c). Organoid cultures derived 
from decidua showed similar responses (Supplementary Figure 6a).
We performed a microarray analysis of organoids in ExM, E2 alone or E2 and P4. Known 
genes upregulated by E2 and P4 in the mid-secretory phase 17βHSD2, PAEP, SPP1, LIF, 
Turco et al.

 IGFBP4, IGFBP5 and CYCLIN A1 were all upregulated in hormonally-treated organoids 
(Fig. 3d)39–42. This was confirmed for several genes using qRT-PCR (Fig. 3e) and at the 
protein level for PAEP and SPP1 (Fig. 3 f,g). We also confirmed that the addition of cyclic 
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to the differentiation medium, a component used 
typically in decidualization protocols, enhances the expression of differentiation markers 
shown by increased expression of PAEP and SPP1 (Supplementary Fig. 6b)43.
Other hormonally-regulated endometrial genes emerged, including OLFM4, an intestinal 
stem cell marker44. In ExM, organoid cells were OLFM4-negative but a subset became 
OLFM4-positive after E2 treatment, similar to the proliferative phase in vivo (Fig. 3h, 
arrows). Collagen 1A2 (COL1A2), chromogranin A (CHGA) and OVOL2 were also 
upregulated, whilst HES1 and SOX9 were downregulated. In summary, the phenotypic 
response of glandular endometrial organoids to ovarian sex hormones is characteristic of the 
early-mid secretory phase.
Signals from decidualised stroma and the placenta can further stimulate differentiation of 
human endometrial gland organoids
If implantation occurs, the endometrium forms the true decidua of pregnancy in response to 
P4; decidualized stromal cells characteristically secrete Prolactin (PRL) 45 (Fig. 4a). Both 
PRL and signals from the conceptus are likely to stimulate uterine gland activity in early 
pregnancy (Fig. 4a)46, 47. To mimic pregnancy, we added placental hormones (Chorionic 
Gonadotropin, hCG and human Placental Lactogen, hPL) in combinations with PRL to ExM 
containing E2+P4+cAMP, referred to as Differentiation Medium (DM) (Fig. 4b).
The three hormones together stimulate maximal production of PAEP and a hypersecretory 
morphology characteristic of decidual glands in vivo (Fig. 4c). PRL has an additional effect 
by stimulating the formation of ciliated cells (identified by acetylated α-tubulin) (Fig. 4d). 
Similar findings were obtained using conditioned media from stromal cells decidualized in 
vitro for 10 days (Supplementary Figure 6c). As ciliated cells are only present in vivo in the 
uterine luminal epithelium and in superficial glands, the organoids are undergoing both 
glandular and luminal differentiation.
SOX9, a marker of progenitor cells, is expressed in the base of endometrial glands in vivo 
and at high levels in the organoids11, 48, 49 but is absent from decidual glands in vivo. 
Organoids cultured with both ovarian and pregnancy hormones undergo differentiation as 
SOX9 was downregulated (Fig. 4e). Thus, appropriate hormonal stimulation induces 
organoids to acquire a decidual-like phenotype characteristic of early pregnancy.
Human endometrial organoids have clonogenic ability and are bipotent
To assess for stem cell activity, we measured clonogenic ability by plating single cells from 
established organoid cultures by limiting dilution; drops containing single cells were marked 
and followed by time-lapse photography. Some cells formed an entire organoid over 7-14 
days; the rest either did not divide or formed small dying spheroids (Fig. 5a). The organoid-
forming efficiency of these cells, was 2-4% with 100 cells/drop and ~10-fold lower with 10 
cells/drop (Supplementary Table 2). Single organoids can be expanded into clonal cultures 
and we now have grown 12 clonal lines from 5 independently-derived organoids (Fig. 5b). A

 single cell has bi-potent ability as it could generate the two main endometrial cell types: 
secretory (PAEP+) and ciliated (acetylated-α-tubulin+) cells (Fig. 5c). Formation of cilia 
was confirmed by EM (Fig. 5d).
Organoid cultures can be derived from endometrial cancer
Endometrial cancer is the commonest gynecological tumour. Organoids were derived from 
samples of tumours and the normal adjacent endometrium from post-menopausal women 
(Fig. 6). The morphology of the organoids resembles the primary tumour (FIGO Grade I 
Endometrioid Carcinoma) showing pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and 
disorganised epithelium. In places breaching of the basement membrane is obvious, and 
isolated cells are seen in the surrounding Matrigel. The organoids are positive for glandular 
markers such as MUC1 and SOX17, confirming their glandular origin.
Discussion
Here, we describe a robust chemically-defined method for establishing genetically stable 
endometrial organoids from human non-pregnant endometrium and decidua that can be 
cultured long-term and recapitulate the molecular signature of endometrial glands in vivo. 
Several murine genes important for glandular development and function (Foxa2, Klf5 and 
Sox17) are also expressed. The organoids functionally respond to sex hormones, E2 and P4, 
and when further stimulated with pregnancy (hCG, hPL) and stromal cell (PRL) signals, 
acquire characteristics of gestational endometrium, synthesising abundant PAEP 
(glycodelin) and SPP1 (osteopontin). PAEP and SPP1, components of glandular secretions, 
‘uterine milk’, provide histotrophic nutrition to trophoblast before the hemochorial placenta 
is established.
Clonal organoid cultures generated from a single cell contain cells with extensive 
proliferative capacity, and both ciliated and secretory cells. Their gene signature includes 
markers of epithelial stem cells, LRIG1, PROM1, AXIN2 and SOX9. Because we could 
generate SOX9-expressing organoids from non-proliferative, SOX9-, differentiated secretory 
phase endometrium and decidua, the few SOX9+ cells present mainly in the basal layer 
might expand11. Alternatively, plasticity of endometrial cells allows SOX9-negative 
differentiated cells to self-renew and reacquire SOX9 expression in our cultures. A similar 
reversion occurs in the liver, where non-Lgr5+ cells reacquire Lgr5 stem cell marker 
expression upon tissue injury50.
Although organoids have been established from human fallopian tube with differentiation 
into both ciliated and secretory cells, neither the dramatic cyclical changes in response to E2 
and P4, nor the process of decidualization induced by pregnancy occurs in the fallopian tube, 
a mucosal surface contiguous to endometrium21. Furthermore, the crucial site of embryo 
attachment is the luminal surface of the endometrium.
Endometrial organoids can be maintained and expanded in ExM, recapitulating pathways 
essential for culturing organoids from other organs - the FGF-MAPK, WNT-Rspondin, 
BMP-Noggin and TGFβ signalling pathways51. The contribution of endometrial stromal 
cells to these signalling pathways is revealed from our microarray analysis showing stromal

 transcripts encoding Rspondin-1 and FGF2. Further refinement of the method to replace 
Matrigel with a chemically-defined extracellular matrix would enhance the model in 
future52. The identity of the endometrial epithelial stem cells remains unknown although 
their presence is revealed by the long-term expansion and clonogenic activity of organoids, 
and we have defined the essential niche components for their maintenance.
We also recapitulate the glandular cyclical changes during the menstrual cycle triggered by 
sequential secretion of ovarian hormones, E2 and P4. Endometrial organoids acquire a 
differentiated phenotype characteristic of the mid-secretory phase, with upregulation of 
several genes (17βHSD2, SPP1, LIF) expressed at this time. Other genes, such as OLFM4, 
that may play key roles in regulating gland cell proliferation and function during the cycle 
were also identified.
Besides the direct effect E2 and P4 have on the glands, they also exert a paracrine effect via 
the stromal cells. Decidualized stroma secretes a wide range of proteins, including PRL 
whose function is unknown. Unlike the pituitary, decidual PRL is driven from an alternative 
promoter, derived from transposable elements (MER20)53. Our finding that addition of PRL 
induces ciliated cells suggests it may influence differentiation and function of the glands 
during early pregnancy.
The glands of gestational endometrium continue to differentiate and display a 
hypersecretory appearance with abundant PAEP production54, 55. In our organoid system, 
addition of trophoblast hormones (hCG and hPL) resulted in a similar appearance. This 
culture system will therefore allow further investigation of the essential (but understudied) 
period of histotrophic nutrition in the first trimester of pregnancy before the hemochorial 
placenta is established. Additionally, we were able to derive organoids from endometrial 
adenocarcinomas. These common tumours in post-menopausal women are associated with 
increased exposure to estrogen that is a feature of obesity, nulliparity, treatment with 
tamoxifen and late menopause56. These can be used in the future to build a biobank to 
screen drugs and investigate the mutational changes, as has been done for colon cancers57.
In summary, we describe a method for reliable chemically-defined, long-term culture of 
endometrial glands from non-pregnant endometrium and decidua that closely recapitulates 
the molecular and functional characteristics of their cells of origin. The organoid cultures 
can be frozen down without loss of their proliferative ability upon thawing, allowing the 
possibility to build up patient-specific bio-banks. This method will be an invaluable research 
tool to study new therapies for common pathologies of the endometrium, such as 
endometriosis and endometrial cancer, as well as investigating problems of implantation and 
the secretion of uterine histotroph during early pregnancy.

Isolation of glands, derivation and culture of organoids from human uterine tissue 
samples
Endometrial/decidual/carcinoma tissues were chopped using scalpels into approximately 0.5 
mm3 cubes and enzymatically digested in 20-30 mL 1.25U/mL Dispase II (Sigma, D4693)/ 
0.4mg/mL collagenase V (Sigma, C-9263) solution in RPMI 1640 medium (ThermoFisher 
Scientific, 21875-034)/10% FCS (Biosera, FB-1001) with gentle shaking at 37°C for 30-60 
min. The supernatant was passed through one or more 100 μm cell sieves (Corning, 431752) 
and the sieve washed several times with medium. The flow-through was collected for 
stromal cell culture in Advanced DMEM/F12 (ThermoFisher Scientific, 12634010) 
+10%FBS+pen/strep (Sigma, P0781) +L-glutamine (Sigma, 25030-024) for several days 
and subsequent analysis. The sieves were inverted over a petri dish and retained glandular 
elements were backwashed from the sieve membranes, pelleted by centrifugation and 
resuspended in ice cold Matrigel (Corning, 536231) at a ratio of 1:20 (vol:vol). 20 μL drops 
of Matrigel-cell suspension were plated into 48-well plate (Costar, 3548), allowed to set at 
37°C and overlaid with 250 μL organoid Expansion Medium (ExM). See Supplementary 
Table 3 for ExM composition. The medium was changed every 2-3 d. Cultures were 
passaged by manual pipetting every 7-10 d. For freezing organoids, Matrigel was removed 
using Cell Recovery Solution (Corning, 354253) and organoids were resuspended in

 Recovery cell culture freezing medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, 12648-010). A step-by-
step protocol of the derivation and maintenance of human endometrial organoid cultures can 
be found at Nature Protocol Exchange59.
Organoid formation efficiency assays
Organoids were removed of Matrigel using Cell Recovery Solution and pipetted several 
hundred times before trypsinizing with TrypLE Express (Invitrogen, 12604-013). Cells were 
washed in medium and passed through a 40 μm cell strainer (Corning, 352340) to ensure 
single cell suspension. Cells were diluted in trypan blue to exclude dead cells and counted 
using haematocytometer. For the growth factor requirement experiment (Fig.1e), 5000 cells 
were plated per 20 μL Matrigel drop into 48 well plate, per culture condition in triplicate. 
The number of organoids formed after 7 d were scored. For organoid formation efficiency 
assay (Supplementary Table 2), 100 cells were plated into 5 μL Matrigel drops into 96-well 
plate (ThermoFisher Scientific, 167008) and overlayed with 100 μL medium. The number of 
organoids were scored after 10 d.
Single cell organoid formation timecourse
Organoids were processed in the same way as for organoid formation efficiency assay. Cells 
were then plated using limiting dilution assay technique to have approximately 1 cell per 2.5 
μL Matrigel drop. The drops were plated onto gridded 35 mm ibidi glass bottom dishes 
(Thermo Scientific, 81148) and overlayed with 1.2 mL of ExM. ExM was supplemented 
with 10 μM Y-27632 (Merck, 688000) for first 3 d of culture. Drops were screened and the 
relative positions of the drops containing one cell were stored using the Axiovision image 
software V4.8 and cells were imaged in phase contrast every 2 d using the Zeiss Axiovert Z1 
microscope and Axio Observer software.
Differentiation of endometrial organoids
For hormonal stimulation of organoids with β-estradiol (E2, Sigma E4389), Progesterone 
(P4, Sigma P7556) and 8-Bromoadenosine 3’, 5’-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP, Sigma 
B7880), organoids were passaged routinely and after 4 d of growth in ExM, they were 
primed with 10 nM E2. After 48 h, medium was replaced with the following conditions: i) 
untreated (ExM), ii) 10 nM E2, or iii) 10 nM E2 + 1 μM P4 + 1 μM cAMP. After 96 h, the 
organoids were collected for downstream applications.
For differentiation of organoids using human pregnancy hormones, 20 ng/mL Prolactin 
(PRL, Peprotech 100-07), 1 μg/ml human Chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Source Bioscience 
ABC403) and 20 ng/mL human placental lactogen (hPL, R&D 5757-PL) were used. 
Organoids were passaged routinely and after 4 d in ExM, the medium was switched to 
Differentiation medium (DM) which is ExM containing 10 nM E2 + 1 μM P4 + 10-6 M 
cAMP. DM was added with a combination of HCG, hPL and/or PRL for another 8 d. See 
Supplementary Table 3 for further information.
ELISA
Organoids from nine wells of a 48-well plate were pooled and transferred onto three 35mm 
ibidi μ-dishes (Thermo Scientific, 81156) thinly-coated with Matrigel diluted 1:2 in DMEM/

 F12. Matrigel was removed with Matrigel cell recovery solution on ice for 1 h. Organoids 
were washed in DMEM/F12 and resuspended in 1.2 mL ExM. 400 μL organoid suspension 
was plated into each dish and incubated at 37°C for 2 h to allow organoids to attach. Dishes 
were flooded with ExM and cultured for 2-4 d until complete monolayers of cells had grown 
out. Cells were then treated as described above for E2 and P4 stimulation. Supernates were 
harvested after a further 96 h and centrifuged to remove any cellular material prior to 
concentrating to 250 μL with Vivaspin 2 concentrators (Generon, VS0291). Concentrated 
supernates were stored at -80°C until use. Human Osteopontin (SPP1) Platinum ELISA 
(eBioscience, BMS2066) was performed using 50 μL concentrated supernate with 50 μL 
sample buffer in duplicate alongside double diluted human SPP1 standard as per the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Concentration of SPP1 in the supernates was calculated from 
the line formula of the standard plots using Microsoft Office Excel.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Tissue sections of 4 μm were cut from formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded human 
endometrial and decidual tissues and organoids. Prior to paraffin embedding, organoids were 
removed from Matrigel using Cell Recovery Solution, fixed in formalin (Sigma, F5554) and 
embedded into 1% agarose (Melford, MB1200). Sections were dewaxed with Histoclear 
(National Diagnostics, HS-200), cleared in 100% ethanol and rehydrated through gradients 
of ethanol to PBS. Heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed in Access 
Revelation (AR) pH 6.4 buffer (A.Menarini, MP-607-PG1) or Access Super (AS) 
(A.Menarini, MP-606-PG1), at 125°C in an Antigen Access pressure cooker unit 
(A.Menarini, MP-2008-CE). Sections were blocked with 2% serum (of species in which the 
secondary antibody was made) in PBS, primary antibody incubation was 30 min RT°C or 
overnight at 4°C and slides washed in PBS. Biotinylated horse anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit 
secondary antibody was used, followed by Vectastain ABC-HRP reagent (Vector, PK-6100) 
and developed with di-aminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (Sigma, D4168). Sections were 
counterstained with Carazzi’s haematoxylin and mounted in glycerol/gelatin mounting 
medium (Sigma, GG1-10). Primary antibody was replaced with equivalent concentration of 
mouse or rabbit IgG for negative controls. See Supplementary Table 4 for antibody 
information. Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining was performed on paraffin sections 
following standard protocols provided by Surgipath. Tissue sections were imaged using 
Zeiss Axiovert Z1 microscope and Axiovision imaging software SE64 V4.8.
Immunofluorescence (IF) and confocal microscopy
Endometrial organoids were grown in 35mm ibidi μ-dishes (Thermo Scientific, 81156). 
Organoids were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 10 μM EdU in ExM. Organoids were fixed in 
4% PFA for 30 min at RT°C and washed several times in PBS. Cells were permeabilized for 
30 min in 0.5% Triton/PBS. EdU staining was done using Click-iT® EdU Alexa Fluor® 594 
Imaging Kit (Thermo Scientific, C10339) following manufacturer’s instructions. Organoids 
were washed in PBS and blocked in 5% GS/1%BSA in PBS for 40 min at RT°C. Primary 
antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer with 0.05% Triton at 4°C overnight. For 
antibodies used, see Supplementary Table 4. Negative controls were prepared by omitting 
primary antibody and/or omitting EdU incubation. Organoids were washed 3 times for 15 
min in PBS. Organoids were incubated for 3 h RT°C in PBS with secondary antibodies (all

 from ThermoFisher Scientific): AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1 (A21121), 
AlexaFluor goat-anti-rabbit 568 (A11011) or Alexa Fluor 647 (A21244) at 1:400 and Dapi 
(Sigma, D9542). Organoids were washed in PBS for 30 min 3 times, mounted in ibidi 
mounting medium (ThermoFisher Scientific, 400241) and imaged using the ZEISS 700 
Confocal microscope and ZEN Microscope Software.
Flow cytometry
Organoids were processed as described above in Organoid formation efficiency assays to 
obtain single cell suspension. Cells were blocked in 1% FBS in DPBS without Calcium and 
Magnesium (ThermoFisher Scientific, 14190136) with human IgG (Sigma, I4506) and then 
incubated at 4°C with SSEA-1-PE at 1:10 (Miltenyi, 130-104-936). 7-AAD was used for 
live/dead discrimination. Cells were sorted using a DakoCytomation MoFlo cytometer and 
Summit software.
In Situ Hybridization (ISH) Assays
ISH for LRIG1 and AXIN2 were performed on 4 μm thick paraffin sections using 
RNAscope 2.0 High definition assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the tissue sections were baked at 60 °C for 1 h and 
dewaxed with xylene, cleared in 100% ethanol and airdried. For tissue sections, the slides 
were treated according to the standard protocol: 10 min in Pretreat buffer 1, 15 min in 
Pretreat buffer 2 and 30 min at 37°C in Pretreat buffer 3. For organoid sections, milder 
treatments were necessary to avoid non-specific signal: Pretreat 2 for 5 min and Pretreat 3 
for 15 min. Sections were then incubated with LRIG1 probe (Cat. no. 407421) or AXIN2 
(Cat. no. 400241), positive control probe PPIB (Cat. no. 313901), negative control probe 
dapB (Cat no. 310043) for 2 h at 40°C. Positive and negative controls were performed for 
each sample. For the visualization of signal, the samples were incubated using the 
amplification kit and then treated with DAB for 10 min. Sections were then dehydrated, 
mounted in DPX (Sigma, 44581) and imaged using Zeiss Axiovert Z1 microscope and 
Axiovision imaging software SE64 V4.8.
Election microscopy (EM)
For Figure 1 j, k organoids were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 
7.4) for 12 h at 4°C, rinsed in 0.1 M HEPES buffer X5, treated with 1% osmium ferricyanide 
at RT°C for 12 h, followed by 5 washes in DIW. They were then treated with 2% uranyl 
acetate in 0.05 M maleate buffer (pH 5.5) for 12 h at RT°C, rinsed in DIW and dehydrated in 
an ascending series of ethanol solutions from 70% to 100% treated twice with dry 
acetonitrile and infiltrated with Quetol epoxy resin. Images were taken in an FEI Tecnai G2 
operated at 120Kv using an AMT XR60B digital camera running Deben software. For 
Figure 5d, organoids were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer 
(pH 7.2) for 30 min, washed in sodium cacodylate buffer, treatment with reduced osmium 
tetroxide 1% OsO4, 1.5% potassium ferricynide at RT°C for 60 min, washed in water, 
treated with 0.5% magnesium uranyl acetate at 4°C for 16 h, dehydrated with ethanol rinsed 
in propylene oxide and embedded in Epon resin. Ultrathin sections were examined in an FEI 
Tecnai G2 TEM at 80Kv. Images were acquired with MegaView III CCD and Soft Imaging 
Systems program.

 Western blotting analysis
Organoids were incubated in Matrigel cell recovery solution on ice for 1 h to remove 
Matrigel, washed in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in ice cold buffer containing 20 mM Tris 
(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium 
pyrophosphate, 1 mM glycerolphosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4 and complete mini proteases 
inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 04693159001). Western blots were performed as previously 
described58. Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto 
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at RT°C 
and then incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-PAEP antibody (Abcam, ab53289) diluted in 
5% milk/TBST at 1:1000. The membranes were analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence 
(GE Healthcare, RPN2106) using Kodak X-OMAT film (Sigma, F1274).
DNA extraction and quantification
DNA was extracted from donor patients’ blood, endometrial biopsies and organoids using 
QIAamp DNA blood Mini kit (Qiagen). DNA was extracted from endometrial biopsies and 
decidual tissue by digestion with ATL buffer (Qiagen, 19076) and Proteinase K (Sigma, 
P4850), followed by purification steps with RNase A (Sigma, R6513) and Protein 
Precipitation Solution (Qiagen, 158910), precipitation with isopropanol and washing with 
70% ethanol. DNA quality and concentration were determined using the Nanodrop ND-1000 
Spectrophotometer.
Genetic analysis
The DNA was analysed using Agilent Sureprint G3 unrestricted CGH ISCA 8x60K array 
(Agilent, G4450A) by the Medical Genetics Laboratory at Cambridge University Hospital. 5 
independent organoid samples were analysed and DNA from patient’s blood, biopsied tissue 
or early passage organoids were used as hybridization controls. DNA was diluted to 50 
ng/uL and labelled using the Agilent kit following manufacturer’s instructions. Data analysis 
for segmentation and copy number calls was performed at a genome-wide resolution of 
500kb using the default analysis method – CGH v2 from the Agilent CytoGenomics 
software Edition 2.5.8.11 (Build 37).
RNA extraction, quantification and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit with on column DNAse treatment 
(Qiagen, 79254), following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality and concentration 
were determined using the Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. 500 ng-1 μg of total 
RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript VILO Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, 11754050) with random hexamers and RNAse inhibitor according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. An RNA sample without Reverse transcriptase was used as 
control for genomic DNA contamination. All qRT-PCR experiments were performed with 
non-template control.
Real-Time PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR 
system (Applied Biosystems) using Fast Taqman Mix and Taqman gene expression assays 
Turco et al.

 and following manufacturer’s protocol. The cycling conditions are: 95°C 20 s and 40 cycles 
of 95°C 3 s followed by 60°C 30 s. TaqMan Gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) 
used: LIF (Hs01055668_m1), PAEP (Hs01046125_m1), SPP1 (Hs00959010_m1) and 
HSD17B2 (Hs00157993_m1). Expression levels were calculated applying the comparative 
Cycle threshold (Ct) method. Relative expression levels were normalised to the geometric 
mean of three housekeeping genes HPRT1 (Hs02800695_m1), TOP1 (Hs002432257_m1) 
and TBP (Hs00427620_m1) using Microsoft Office Excel.
Microarray expression profiling and data analysis
Microarray experiments were performed using the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip 
(Illumina, BD-103-0204) according to manufacturer’s instructions by the Cambridge 
Genomic Services at University of Cambridge. A total of 7 endometrial samples were 
analysed and for each, the starting glandular digest, stromal cells and established organoids 
were used for analysis. 6 organoid cultures derived from decidua were also analysed. RNA 
samples for microarray analysis were assessed for concentration and quality using a 
SpectroStar and a Bioanalyser. Briefly, 200 ng of Total RNA underwent linear amplification 
using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, AMIL1791) 
following manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration, purity and integrity of cRNA were 
measured by SpectroStar and Bioanalyser. cRNA was hybridised to the HumanHT-12 v4 
BeadChip overnight followed by washing, staining and scanning using the Illumina Bead 
Array Reader. After scanning, the data was loaded into GenomeStudio software. No 
background correction or normalisation is applied at this stage. The data is processed in R 
using the lumi package and the limma package. Across all samples probes for which the 
intensity values were not significantly different (p>0.01) from the negative controls were 
removed from the analysis. Following filtering the data was transformed using the Variance 
Stabilization Transformation (VST) from lumi and then normalised to remove technical 
variation between arrays using quantile normalisation. Comparisons were performed using 
the limma package with results corrected for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate 
(FDR) testing. Finally the quality of the data was assessed and the correlation of the samples 
in the groups compared. Heatmaps were generated using the heatmap.2 function of the R 
package 'gplots', which uses euclidean method to obtain the distance matrix and complete 
agglomeration method for clustering. For the sample heatmaps, the input is a correlation 
matrix based on samples’ expression profile. For the gene heatmaps, the input is the vst 
transformed and normalized intensity matrix. The cluster analysis for the hormone 
stimulation microarray was done using the R sva package, expression values from all genes 
were transformed by removing the baseline differences between samples due to patient 
origin. Then, cluster analysis was done on a selected group of genes (those differentially 
expressed between control groups (ExM) and stimulated with Estrogen (ExM+E2) with 
adjusted P values ≤0.05) using the R stats package. The distance matrix was computed using 
1-correlation as the distance measure, and hierarchical clustering was performed using the 
complete linkage method.
