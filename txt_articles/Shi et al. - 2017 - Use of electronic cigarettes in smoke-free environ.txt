Abstract
Background—Although most U.S. states prohibit cigarette smoking in public places and 
worksites, fewer jurisdictions regulate indoor use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). Given the 
dramatic increase in e-cigarette use and concern about its impact on non-users, there is a need to 
examine the use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free environments and related attitudes and perceptions.
Methods—Recruited from a nationally representative adult panel (GfK’s KnowledgePanel), 952 
current users of e-cigarettes completed a cross-sectional online survey in 2014. Multivariate 
logistic regressions were conducted to examine the factors associated with ever using e-cigarettes 
in smoke-free environments.
Results—Overall, 59.5% of e-cigarette users had vaped where cigarette smoking was not 
allowed. Young adults (18–29 years) were most likely to do so, 74.2%. The places of first-time use 
most often mentioned were service venues (bar, restaurant, lounge, and club), 30.7%, followed by 
worksites, 23.5%. Daily e-cigarette users were more likely to have vaped in smoke-free 
environments than non-daily users (OR=2.08, p=.012). Only 2.5% of those who used e-cigarettes 
in smoke-free environments reported negative reactions from other people. Most e-cigarette users 
did not think e-cigarettes are harmful to themselves or to by-standers, and thus should not be 
banned where smoking is; those who had used e-cigarettes where smoking is banned were even 
more likely to hold these views.
Conclusions—E-cigarette use in smoke-free environments was common, suggesting that most 
e-cigarette users do not consider smoke-free laws to apply to e-cigarettes. Explicit laws should be 
considered if jurisdictions want to prohibit e-cigarette use in public places.

 INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of current e-cigarette use among adults has increased significantly in recent 
years.[1–4] Although smoke-free laws have been widely adopted in the U.S.,[5] fewer 
jurisdictions have regulated indoor e-cigarette use. As of April 2016, only 8 states had 
explicit statewide laws banning e-cigarette use in places where cigarette smoking is 
prohibited, and many of those had only been passed recently.[6] Support for bans on e-
cigarette use in public places is substantially lower than for cigarette bans. Studies estimated 
that the proportion of adults supporting such bans for e-cigarettes were 30%–45% during 
2012–2014, [7–9] much lower than the 70–80% who supported smoke-free laws.[10]
Regulating indoor e-cigarette use remains controversial. Those opposing e-cigarette bans 
argue that e-cigarette use is a harm reduction strategy and little scientific evidence has been 
presented about long-term health consequences for users or non-users.[11] On the other 
hand, pollutants from secondhand e-cigarette exposure may still carry risk for non-users, 
albeit at rates lower than from cigarettes.[12–17] Use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free places 
might also make enforcement of smoke-free policies more difficult and adversely affect the 
social norms against smoking.[7–9,11,18]
Despite ongoing debate and monitoring of public attitudes,[7–9] there is little empirical data 
about how many e-cigarette users have actually vaped in smoke-free environments and who 
they are. It is not clear if e-cigarette users think existing smoke-free policies apply to e-
cigarettes, thus self-regulating their use in public spaces. The heart of the issue is, to what 
extent do e-cigarette users view e-cigarettes as similar to cigarettes? This study recruited 
participants from a nationally representative panel and assessed current e-cigarette users’ 
perceptions and patterns of use to determine correlates of using e-cigarettes in smoke-free 
environments.
METHODS
Sample
This study was based on a cross-sectional survey commissioned by the University of 
California, San Diego and administered by GfK.[19] Participants were recruited from GfK’s 
KnowledgePanel, a probability-based web panel that represents 97% of the U.S. adult 
population. Data were collected between February and March, 2014. A total of 8,607 adults 
completed the survey; 957 (4.96% after weighted adjustment) reported currently using e-
cigarettes every day or some days. The study sample was comprised of current e-cigarettes 
users with complete information on sociodemographic characteristics and tobacco use status 
(N=952).
Measures
Respondents who had ever smoked 100 cigarettes and currently smoked every day or some 
days were defined as current smokers. E-cigarette users were those who were currently using 
e-cigarettes “everyday” or “some days.” E-cigarette users were asked “have you ever used an 
e-cigarette in places where cigarette smoking is not allowed?”. Those who responded 
affirmatively were asked the specific smoke-free place where they first used an e-cigarette

 and “how did people react to you?” with possible responses of mostly positive, mostly 
negative, and neutral.
Respondents were presented with several statements regarding e-cigarettes: 1) “E-cigarettes 
are less harmful to health than regular cigarettes,” 2) “Using e-cigarettes is harmful to one’s 
health,” 3) “Exposure to secondhand e-cigarette vapor is harmful,” and 4) “Using e-
cigarettes should be illegal in places where cigarette smoking is illegal.” Responses of 
strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, and strongly disagree were 
dichotomized into agree or disagree.
A series of individual variables were created to represent sociodemographic status, including 
gender, age (18–29, 30–44, 45–59, and 60+ years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, 
Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and other), and education (no college degree and college or 
above).
Statistical Analyses
Prevalence of ever using e-cigarettes in smoke-free environments was summarized by 
sociodemographic characteristics and e-cigarette and cigarette use status. Group differences 
in proportion were determined by Pearson chi-squared tests. A multivariate logistic 
regression was conducted to assess associations between ever using e-cigarettes in smoke-
free environments and individual sociodemographic characteristics and e-cigarette and 
cigarette use status. Sampling weights were computed using the 2010 U.S. Current 
Population Survey to account for non-response, non-coverage, and oversampling in the 
survey sampling design. Stata 14 was used to perform all statistical analyses. The human 
subject protocol of this research was approved by the University of California, San Diego’s 
Institutional Review Board (IRB# 111664).
RESULTS
Overall, 59.5% of current e-cigarette users had vaped where smoking was not allowed. Table 
1 shows the rate of using e-cigarettes in smoke-free environments by demographics and 
tobacco use status. Young adults, 18–29, were most likely to use e-cigarettes where smoking 
was not allowed, 74.2%. The multivariate analysis confirmed that, relative to the 18–29 age 
group, older adults were significantly less likely to have used e-cigarettes in smoke-free 
environments (p<.01). In addition, daily users of e-cigarettes had higher odds of having 
vaped in smoke-free environments than non-daily users (OR=2.08, p=.012). Current 
smokers tended to be more likely to have used e-cigarettes in smoke-free environments, 
although the difference was not statistically significant.
Among respondents who had used e-cigarettes in smoke-free environments, the most 
common places of first use were service venues (bar, restaurant, lounge, or club), 30.7%, 
followed by worksites, 23.6%. Other public places frequently mentioned included shopping 
malls (9.1%), movie theaters (7.7%), hospitals (7.5%), and schools (7.2%). Only 2.1% 
mentioned using them in airplanes. The remaining 12.1% indicated other.

 Very few e-cigarette users reported receiving negative reactions from other people (2.5%) 
when they vaped in a smoke-free environment; 72.3% reported neutral reactions and 25.2% 
reported positive reactions to their use.
When asked to compare e-cigarettes to cigarettes, an overwhelming majority of e-cigarette 
users, 89%, believed the former are less harmful. Furthermore, Table 2 shows that 61.6% 
disagreed that e-cigarettes are harmful. Even a greater percentage, 82.9%, disagreed that 
secondhand vapor is harmful to bystanders and 73.6% disagreed that e-cigarettes should be 
banned where smoking is illegal. Table 2 also shows that, compared to those who had not 
used e-cigarettes in smoke-free areas, respondents who vaped in smoke-free environments 
were significantly more likely to disagree that e-cigarettes are harmful to themselves or to 
others or that e-cigarettes should be banned in public places (p<.05).
DISCUSSION
This study, to our knowledge, is the first report to provide a population estimate of e-
cigarette use in places where smoking is prohibited. The prevalence of such use was high: 
roughly 60% of all e-cigarette users and nearly 75% for young adults. Those who used e-
cigarettes in smoke-free environments were less likely to approve of banning e-cigarettes in 
smoke-free places or to consider e-cigarette use harmful. These findings indicate that the 
majority of e-cigarette users perceived their use as acceptable in smoke-free areas; they did 
not feel constrained in using e-cigarettes by the existing bans against smoking cigarettes in 
public places.
The reported reaction by others to their use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free environment seems 
to support their belief in the acceptability of the behavior; few reported negative reactions 
(2.5%). The majority reported that witnesses did not seem to care about their e-cigarette use 
and 25% reported positive affirmation of the behavior. It is not clear whether the witnesses 
were themselves e-cigarette users or smokers, but the survey respondents’ reports are 
consistent with reported low levels of support in the general population for banning the use 
of e-cigarettes in smoke-free places.[7–9]
Service venues and worksites were the most reported smoke-free places where e-cigarettes 
were used for the first time. Although this may reflect their greater likelihood of frequenting 
these places, it is notable that these are also the places where tobacco control advocates had 
to work hardest to pass laws prohibiting cigarette smoking.[20] Regulations to restrict 
smoking in places such as airplanes or hospitals tended to receive support from the public 
more easily. States and local jurisdictions should anticipate challenges to implementation 
and enforcement of policies when extending smoke-free regulations to include e-cigarettes, 
particularly in service venues and worksites.
There is concern that cigarette smokers may use e-cigarettes as a means to circumvent 
smoke-free laws.[8,21] A larger proportion of smokers had used e-cigarettes in smoke-free 
places than had non-smokers, although the results were not significant. E-cigarettes have 
been promoted as an alternative to smoking; one that can be used anywhere.[22] The

 “freedom” appeals and the absence of an explicit e-cigarette ban may have encouraged 
smokers to vape in places where smoking is banned.
A key issue is whether e-cigarette users consider e-cigarettes as a product similar to 
cigarettes. Data presented in Table 2 shows that most of them did not. An overwhelmingly 
majority of them considered e-cigarettes less harmful than cigarettes. Likewise, most of 
them did not think e-cigarettes are harmful to users or to by-standers, a trend that was 
especially true among those who had used e-cigarettes in smoke-free environments. These 
beliefs might represent a bit of post-decision justification.[23] It is interesting that, although 
most e-cigarette users thought e-cigarettes were not harmful to others, fewer were against 
banning e-cigarette use in smoke-free venues (83% vs 74%, respectively). This suggests that 
these e-cigarette users were cognizant of the fact that physical harm of second-hand vapor is 
not the only reason to ban vaping in places where smoking is currently not allowed.
This study has several limitations. First, as in any survey on behavior, self-report of e-
cigarette use and reactions from other people are subject to bias from recall and social 
desirability. Second, the post-hoc analysis is limited by the data available. For example, 
there was no data on whether there were local regulations on e-cigarette use in smoke-free 
environments or whether respondents were aware of such laws, both of which could affect 
their e-cigarette use behaviors. However, since almost no states had laws prohibiting e-
cigarette use at the time of the interview,[6] measuring awareness of such laws would likely 
not have significantly altered the study findings. Third, although the sample was nationally 
representative, it was small, limiting statistical power. Lastly, the report on where 
respondents first used e-cigarettes in public may be influenced by their likelihood of being in 
such places and may not represent the places of most frequent use.
Limitations notwithstanding, this study clearly showed that most e-cigarette users do not 
consider smoke-free laws to apply to e-cigarettes, and this was particularly true with young 
adults. A general ban on tobacco products may not be sufficient to restrict e-cigarette use in 
public places. Explicit laws and clear signage should be considered if jurisdictions want to 
prohibit e-cigarette use in public places.

 WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
As e-cigarette use increases, a question arises as to whether users consider smoke-free 
policies applicable to e-cigarettes and thus self-regulate their use in public spaces. This 
study examined the use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free spaces among a nationally 
representative sample of U.S. e-cigarette users.
This study adds the following:
•
Most e-cigarette users in the U.S. do not consider smoke-free laws applicable 
to e-cigarettes. This was particularly true of young adults.
•
In order to minimize nonuser secondhand exposure to e-cigarette aerosol, 
laws need to be explicit about restrictions on e-cigarette use.
