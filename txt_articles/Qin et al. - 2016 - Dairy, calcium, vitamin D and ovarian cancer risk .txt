Background: No previous study has evaluated the associations of dairy products, lactose, calcium and vitamin D with the risk of
ovarian cancer in African–American women, who are known to have high mortality from the disease, as well as to be at risk for
calcium and vitamin D deficiency.
Methods: We evaluated these associations among 490 ovarian cancer cases and 656 age- and site-matched controls of African–
American descent recruited into the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study, a population-based case-control study in
11 geographical areas in the US. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: An increased ovarian cancer risk was observed for whole milk consumption and lactose intake (highest quartile vs lowest:
OR ¼ 1.97, 95% CI: 1.25–3.10;P-trend: 0.008). Calcium intake was associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer (OR ¼ 0.51, 95
CI%: 0.30–0.86; P-trend: 0.009), but vitamin D intake was not. Longer sun exposure in summer months was found to predict a lower
risk (OR ¼ 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51–0.99; P-trend: 0.049).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a high-calcium, low-lactose diet, and sun exposure in summer months may reduce the risk
of ovarian cancer in African–American women.
Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among
women in the US, of which nearly 90% are epithelial ovarian
carcinomas (Berek et al, 2010). Because currently there is no
reliable screening available for ovarian cancer and early-stage
ovarian cancer often has no symptoms, most cases are diagnosed at
an advanced stage, with a poor prognosis (Goff et al, 2000).
Therefore, a better understanding of the aetiology and prevention
is especially important for ovarian cancer. Although 5-year survival
improved in Whites from 35% in 1975–1977 to 46% in 2005–2011,
survival actually worsened in African Americans (AAs) during

 this period (rates went from 42% to 38%; Howlader et al, 2015).
The widening gap suggests a critical need for identifying a
modifiable risk factors in AA women, an understudied population.
The positive correlation between per capita milk consumption,
lactase persistence (the ability to digest lactose), and ovarian cancer
incidence (Cramer, 1989a) has led to the hypothesis that the
lactose component of dairy – a disaccharide of galactose and
glucose, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer through galactose’s
direct toxicity on oocytes (Cramer et al, 1989b; Liu et al, 2000).
Although some studies found positive associations between dairy
foods or lactose intake with the risk of ovarian cancer (Kushi et al,
1999; Fairfield et al, 2004; Larsson et al, 2004), others found null
(Pan et al, 2004; Webb et al, 1998; Merritt et al, 2013) or inverse
association (Goodman et al, 2002; Salazar-Martinez et al, 2002).
These study populations were primarily of European ancestry,
although no study has published among AAs. The inconsistencies
might be attributed to other anti-tumorigenic nutrients in dairy
foods, especially calcium and vitamin D. There is enticing evidence
that vitamin D regulates multiple cancer risk and prognosis-
relevant pathways, including tumorigenic pathways in ovarian
carcinoma (Fleet et al, 2012). Co-administration of calcium was
found to enhance the benefits of vitamin D on multiple health
outcomes (Feldman et al, 2014). Calcium intake may also
independently predict the lower risk of ovarian cancer as suggested
by some observational studies (Bidoli et al, 2001; Goodman et al,
2002; Koralek et al, 2006; Merritt et al, 2013), albeit rather
inconsistently (Tzonou et al, 1993; Kushi et al, 1999; Genkinger
et al, 2006; Chang et al, 2007). It is possible that the opposing
associations of calcium or vitamin D and lactose may explain the
inconsistent findings between the dairy products and ovarian
cancer risk in the current literature.
In addition to food and supplemental intakes, vitamin D in
humans can also be produced through skin synthesis upon sun
exposure. However, darker colour of the skin reduces the
penetration of UVB, resulting in a subsequent less cutaneous
synthesis of vitamin D (Webb, 2006). This, together with the
tendency of AAs to consume less vitamin D and calcium from
dietary sources, due to a higher prevalence of lactose intolerance
(Suchy et al, 2010), and supplemental intake (Calvo et al, 2005;
Kant et al, 2007) place AA women at risk for vitamin
D deficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating
intakes of dairy foods, lactose, calcium, and vitamin D exposure
(diet and sunlight) and the risk of ovarian cancer among
AA women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design and participants. This study was conducted among
AA descent recruited into the African American Cancer Epide-
miology Study (AACES), an ongoing population-based case-
control study of ovarian cancer in AA women in 11 sites in the
US (South: Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia,
Alabama, Louisiana, Texas; North: Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, New
Jersey) (Schildkraut et al, 2014). Cases were identified by rapid case
ascertainment utilising state cancer registries, SEER registries or
hospitals’
gynaecologic
oncology
departments.
Eligible
cases
include all self-identified AA women aged between 20 and 79
years, with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed invasive
epithelial ovarian cancer. Controls who self-identified as AAs were
selected using random digit dialling and were frequency matched
to cases by 5-year-age groups and state of residence. Women who
had
a
previous
history
of
ovarian
cancer
or
a
bilateral
oophorectomy were ineligible controls. Among those who could
be contacted, 66.5% of potential cases and 72% of potential
controls agreed to participate in the main telephone interview
(Schildkraut et al, 2014). The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards at all study sites.
Data were collected by a computer-assisted telephone interview,
which included detailed questions on demographic information,
personal and family history of cancer, reproductive history,
medication use, lifestyle characteristics, and other factors of
particular
relevance
to
AA
women,
such
as
pigmentation,
perceived discrimination, and cultural beliefs. Daily hours spent
outdoors in daylight were asked separately on weekdays or
weekends, and in summer or the rest of the year.
The present study included 574 cases and 733 controls, who
completed the baseline questionnaire via telephone interview by
Jan 2016. Although a short version of the questionnaire was offered
for those who were not willing to complete the full version (5.3%),
they were not included in this study since sun exposure,
pigmentation and some important covariates for this analysis
(e.g., physical activity) were not asked. After excluding 78 cases and
68 controls who did not complete the food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) for dietary assessment, one case and three controls who
reported an extreme energy intake (greater than twice the
interquartile range of log energy intake), and five cases and six
controls with covariates missing, a total of 490 cases and
656 controls remained for the analysis.
Dietary assessment. Dietary information was assessed via a self-
administered Block 2005 FFQ, which included questions on
frequency and portion size for 110 food and beverages consumed
over the year preceding diagnosis for cases or the reference date for
controls (Qin et al, 2016). Dairy intakes were calculated based on
the MyPyramid Equivalents Database 2.0 (Bowman et al, 2008).
One cup of milk or yogurt (8 fluid oz. or 237 ml) was counted
as one milk cup equivalent, that is, one serving in our study.
One serving of cheese was between 1 and 2 ounces of natural
cheese or processed cheese depending on its calcium content. Milk-
based desserts such as ice cream were also considered as dairy
products with equivalent servings based on their milk ingredients.
Nutrient intakes were derived by Block Dietary Data Systems
based on the USDA Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary
Studies 1.0. Supplemental intake of calcium or vitamin D,
including multivitamin sources was also collected. Total intake of
calcium or vitamin D includes that from both dietary and
supplemental sources. Validation studies of the Block FFQ have
been described elsewhere (Mares-Perlman et al, 1993; Boucher
et al, 2006). The reliability of total calcium or vitamin D intake
between the first and second FFQs (2 month apart) were 0.80 and
0.76, respectively. The correlations between estimates from FFQ
and two 24-h recalls were 0.71 and 0.54 for calcium and vitamin D,
respectively.
Statistical analysis. We compared the distributions of character-
istics between cases and controls using w2-test or t-test as
appropriate. We also compared the correlations between intakes
of vitamin D, calcium, and lactose using Spearman’s rank
correlations.
We used unconditional logistic regression models adjusting for
the matching factors to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) of ovarian cancer by levels of dairy
foods, nutrients (calcium, vitamin D, and lactose), and sun
exposure. For total dairy, milk, cheese, total calcium or vitamin
D, dietary calcium or vitamin D, lactose, and daylight hours spent
outdoors in a year or in summer months, they were categorised
into quartiles based on the distributions of controls. For yogurt,
milk subtypes (whole milk, skim/low-fat milk), supplemental
calcium or vitamin D, which had 425% non-consumers, they were
categorised into three groups, that is, non-consumers, below
or
above
the
median
of
consumption
based
on
controls’
distributions. The median value of each category was treated as a
continuous variable to test for linear trends.

 The first model adjusted for age, geographic region, and
total energy intake. Geographic region was grouped by UV index
(45 and p5, i.e., South and North states) (NASA Earthdata,
2016). The second model further adjusted for a priori confounders
or risk factors for ovarian cancer, including education (high school
or less, some post-high school training, and college or graduate
degree), parity (0, 1–2, 42), oral contraceptive use (never, o60
mo, X60 mo), menopause status (pre- and post menopause), tubal
ligation (no and yes), first-degree family history of breast/ovarian
cancer (no and yes), body mass index (BMI, calculated from self-
reported weight and height 1 year before), recreational physical
activity (0, o150 min per week, X150 min per week 1 year before),
skin pigmentation (lighter, average, and darker), daylight hours
spent outdoors in summer months (h per week) in models for
dietary exposures, and additional covariates for corresponding
models: models with dairy were controlled for supplemental
calcium and were mutually adjusted for other types of dairy foods
when applicable; models with nutrient intakes were adjusted for
other sugar intakes (excluding lactose) and were mutually adjusted
for each other; models with sun exposure were adjusted for
total vitamin D intake from dietary and supplemental sources.
Other covariates as listed in Table 1 (e.g., alcohol consumption, talc
use, and occupational activity) were considered, but were not
adjusted since none changed the effect estimates by 410%.
We tested for statistical interaction of total dairy, calcium, vitamin
D, lactose, daylight hours spent outdoors (in a year or in summer
months) between each other (except for dairy), and with skin
pigmentation, BMI, menopausal status, and oral contraceptive use via
likelihood ratio test. We also conducted analyses by the two
histological subtypes contributing the largest number of cases (serous
and endometrioid) and tested for heterogeneity. As the stratum sizes
would be too small for interaction or histological subtype analyses,
we evaluated the dietary exposure as a continuous variable, where 1
unit equals to the interquartile difference of controls’ dietary intake.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata (version 14.1;
StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
RESULTS
Compared with controls, cases were older and less likely to reside
in North (Table 1). We found the distributions of ovarian cancer
risk factors were in the expected directions. Cases were less likely to
have children, to have used oral contraceptives or to have had a
tubal ligation, and were more likely to have a family history of
breast or ovarian cancer.
The mean (s.d.) intake of dairy products were 6.9 (6.7) and
6.4 (5.8) servings per week among cases and controls, respectively
(data not shown). As shown in Table 2, there was a suggestion of a
positive association between total dairy or milk intake with ovarian
cancer risk, though risk estimates were not statistically significant.
In the analyses of milk subtypes, whole milk was significantly
associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer (OR¼ 1.85 comparing
42.3 serving per week vs non-consumers, 95% CI: 1.05–3.27; P-trend:
0.02), whereas skim/low-fat milk was not. No association was found
for cheese or yogurt. Results remained essentially unchanged when
adjusting for saturated fat (data not shown).
In the multivariable- and mutually adjusted model, we found
calcium intake was consistently associated with a decreased risk
of ovarian cancer, with a similar OR for calcium from food,
supplement
or
total
(from
food
plus
supplement
sources)
comparing the highest to the lowest intake category (Table 3).
For example, the highest quartile (Q4) of total calcium intake
was associated with a 49% decreased OR (95% CI: 0.30–0.86,
P-trend ¼ 0.009). Although calcium intake was highly correlated
with vitamin D intake (r ¼ 0.64, Po0.001; Supplementary Table 1),
we found no association between total or dietary vitamin D with
ovarian cancer risk. For supplemental vitamin D intake, we only
observed a significant inverse association when comparing the
intermediate category (i.e., p371.4 IU per day) vs non-consumers.
Lactose intake was found to increase ovarian cancer risk, with an
OR of 1.97 comparing Q4 vs Q1 (95% CI: 1.25–3.10; P-trend:
0.008).
In Table 4, the ORs for daylight hours spent outdoors in a year
were in the inverse direction, but not statistically significant. The
inverse association between outdoor hours in summer months and
ovarian cancer risk comparing Q4 vs Q1 was statistical significant
(OR ¼ 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51–0.99; P-trend: 0.049).
We did not find significant interaction between any two
nutrients – total calcium, total vitamin D, and lactose; or between
these nutrients and total dairy with sun exposure hours (in a year
or in summer months), skin pigmentation, BMI, menopausal
status, and oral contraceptive use. In the analyses by serous and
endometrioid histologic subtypes (Supplementary Table 2), we
observed similar magnitude of associations with continuous scale
of total dairy, nutrients, or sun exposure across tumour subtypes.
No significant heterogeneity was found.
DISCUSSION
In this population-based ovarian cancer study of AA women, the
positive association between the total dairy intake and ovarian
cancer risk seemed to be attributable to the consumption of whole
milk. Calcium intake was significantly associated with a reduced
risk of ovarian cancer, whereas lactose intake was associated with
an increased risk. Sun exposure during the summer was found to
decrease the risk of ovarian cancer, but total or dietary vitamin D
intake was not.
Our finding of increased risk with whole milk consumption is
consistent with a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies,
analysed either combined or separately by study design (Larsson
et al, 2006). However, a pooled analysis of cohort studies found no
association with whole milk intake (Genkinger et al, 2006). Their
null findings for low-fat milk, cheese, and yogurt were similar to
our observations. The previous meta-analysis or pooled analysis
did not examine the stratified results among AA women, probably
due to a limited statistical power as most study populations were
primarily of European ancestry. Our results by milk type were not
altered after adjusting for saturated fat intake. Our exploratory
analysis showed that dairy fat tended to associate with an increased
ovarian cancer risk, but the association was attenuated and became
insignificant after adjusting for lactose intake (OR Q4 vs Q1 ¼ 1.48;
95% CI: 0.88–2.47), which is similar to a previous finding (Bertone
et al, 2002). Our results generally support the hypothesis that high-
lactose dairy foods may raise the risk of ovarian cancer. Both whole
milk and low-fat/skim milk, contain on average 12 g per serving of
lactose, much higher than cheese and yogurt (e.g., one serving
cheddar cheese contains 0.05 g lactose and 0.04 g galactose),
although
one
serving
of
these
dairy
products
all
contain
B300 mg of calcium (Bowman et al, 2008; US Department of
Agriculture ARS, Nutrient Data Laboratory, 2015). It is possible
that the influence of lactose and potentially fat content in whole
milk outweighs the benefits of rich calcium, leading to an increased
risk of ovarian cancer risk.
Lactose metabolite, galactose, was found to invariably induce
ovarian toxicity in rodent models (Liu et al, 2000). Excessive
galactose and galactose metabolites, Gal-1-P and galactitol, may
interfere with gonadotrophin signalling and ovarian apoptosis,
contributing
to
the
galactose-induced
ovarian
toxicity
(Holschneider and Berek, 2000). Meanwhile, a higher incidence
of ovarian failure was observed in patients with galactosemia, due

 to a deficient activity of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase
(GALT) (Kaufman et al, 1981), which, in turn, is caused by GALT
gene mutations. Among several polymorphisms, S135L is almost
exclusively found in AAs (Tyfield et al, 1999). It is possible that a
higher lactose consumption, which is beyond the GALT activity,
may introduce a greater risk of ovarian cancer.
Consistent with this hypothesis, and the findings from a pooling
study and a meta-analysis of prospective studies (Genkinger et al,
2006; Larsson et al, 2006), we found lactose intake increased ovarian
cancer risk in AAs. Two cohort studies found this association was
stronger for serous tumours (Fairfield et al, 2004; Larsson et al, 2004),
whereas most case-control studies did not observe this positive
relation among all cases or across tumour subtypes (Webb et al, 1998;
Pan et al, 2004; Merritt et al, 2013). Compared with the previous
studies that were mainly conducted in European or European–
American women, our study of AA women had, on average, lower
intakes of milk and lactose. AAs are more likely to have lactose
intolerance than European Americans (Suchy et al, 2010), which may,
in part, explain the reduced intake of milk and lactose in this
population. For example, in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey AA adults had much lower intake of total dairy
or milk (mean±s.d.: 0.48±0.06 serving per day) compared with
other races (0.93±0.07 serving per day; Fulgoni et al, 2007), which is
consistent with our findings. Because of the lower intakes in the
reference group, we may be more likely to detect the relation with
milk and lactose than other case-control studies.
The other two abundant nutrients from dairy foods are calcium
and vitamin D, which represent the largest contributor of total
calcium and vitamin D intake of the US population (37% and 49%,
respectively) regardless of supplemental intake (Barainca et al,
2014; Hoy and Goldman, 2014). We identified a consistent inverse
association with total, dietary and supplemental intakes of calcium,
independent of a wide array of non-dietary and dietary factors.
For vitamin D intake, we only observed a suggestive decreased risk
with that from supplemental sources. Although we have mutually
adjusted for each other, the high correlations between calcium and
vitamin D made it challenging to evaluate their independent
associations with ovarian cancer, particularly between supplemen-
tal calcium and vitamin D, which often go together in available
supplements. Our findings with calcium were supported by some

 cohort and case-control studies (Bidoli et al, 2001; Goodman et al,
2002; Koralek et al, 2006; Merritt et al, 2013), but not all (Tzonou
et al, 1993; Kushi et al, 1999; Genkinger et al, 2006; Chang et al,
2007). A recent case-control study suggested that the association
was stronger for mucinous ovarian cancer (Merritt et al, 2013).
Considering that mucinous tumours of the ovary usually originate
from the colorectum, and exhibit similar mutational patterns as
mucinous carcinomas of the colorectum (Kelemen and Kobel,
2011), the protective effect of calcium intake on colorectal
cancer may also apply to the mucinous type ovarian cancer
(Cho et al, 2004). Because of the small number of mucinous cases
(n ¼ 25), we were not able to restrict analyses to this subtype.
However, our findings were not altered when mucinous cases were
excluded.
Calcium may also protect against advanced ovarian cancer, as a
mediator of vitamin D-induced apoptosis (Sergeev, 2004). Data
from animal models of ovarian cancer showed consistent evidence
that calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, could suppress the
growth of ovarian cancer (Zhang et al, 2005). However, evidence
from epidemiological studies was rather inconsistent (Cook et al,
2010). Except a few (Salazar-Martinez et al, 2002; Merritt et al,
2013), most studies including ours did not observe a decreased risk
with vitamin D intake (Kushi et al, 1999; Genkinger et al, 2006;
Koralek et al, 2006; Chang et al, 2007). However, the ecological

 studies that evaluated UVB radiation and ovarian mortality rates
invariably found an inverse correlation (Grant, 2012), which
supported our finding that sun exposure in summer months
predicted a lower risk of ovarian cancer. Vitamin D synthesis was
thought to be the most important physiological effect of sun
exposure, despite other pathways such as circadian rhythm that
have been proposed as well (van der Rhee et al, 2013). Although we
were not able to collect serum samples before diagnosis, a meta-
analysis or a pooling study of circulating vitamin D concentration
found a tentative inverse association among all women (Yin et al,
2011), or an inverse association among women who were
overweight or obese (Zheng et al, 2010). Relatively similar findings
for vitamin D status and sun exposure in relation to ovarian cancer
may be explained by the observation that the circulating level of
vitamin D is determined primarily by exposure to sunlight (Adams
et al, 1982). It is suggested that sun exposure for 5–15 min between
1000 hours and 1500 hours during spring, summer, and fall can
help produce an adequate amount of vitamin D for Whites, AAs
need 5–10 times longer exposure to synthesise the same amount of
vitamin D, as their skin pigment reduce the penetration of UVB
(Holick, 2011). However, because the benefits of sun exposure may
be offset by increased risk of skin cancer, a combination of
moderate sun exposure and sufficient vitamin D intakes from diet and
supplements may be a safer solution for an adequate vitamin D status.
In our study, o20% of AA women achieved the recommended daily
vitamin D intake of at least 600 IU (or 800IU if beyond 70 years; Ross
et al, 2011), a threshold mainly based on the evidence in skeletal
health. It has been hypothesised, but remains to be explored whether
higher daily doses of vitamin D would be required for anticancer
actions than that for bone health (Feldman et al, 2014).
We recognised the limitations of dietary recall in case-control
studies. However, the largely unknown relation between intakes of
vitamin D, calcium or dairy foods, and ovarian cancer and, as a
result, lack of awareness of this link in this population should
minimise this problem. To reduce the potential that undetected
disease influenced dietary recall, cases were asked to report their
diet 1 year before diagnosis that is beyond the median pre-
diagnostic symptom duration (4 months) for invasive cases (Vine
et al, 2001). The potential for selection bias is another concern,
especially
when
the
participation
rates
in
population-based
epidemiologic studies have been declining. However, the distribu-
tion of risk factors among cases and controls in our study were in
the expected directions compared with other studies among
AA women
(Moorman
et
al, 2009),
which
increased
our
confidence in the validity of our findings. In addition, residual
confounding is possible despite the multivariable and mutually
adjusted models. We did not have information on sunscreen use or
clothing habits, which could attenuate the negative associations
between daylight outdoor hours in the summer and the risk of
ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, the prevalence of sun-protection
behaviours among AAs is low (e.g., 63% never used sunscreen; Hall
and Rogers, 1998).
A main strength of our study is that we were able to recruit a
large sample of AA ovarian cancer cases and controls from various
geographic regions, and with diverse socioeconomic and lifestyle
characteristics, which imparts our ability to generalise the results to
the AA population. Our study adds to the scarce literature on the
aetiology of ovarian cancer in AA women.
Considering that there is no effective screening tool for ovarian
cancer and the poorer survival of AA patients, prevention is
critical, particularly through lifestyle or dietary modifications,
which are less costly and risky than medical treatments. Our
findings suggest that sun exposure in summer months and a high-
calcium, low-lactose diet may benefit ovarian cancer prevention in
AA women.
