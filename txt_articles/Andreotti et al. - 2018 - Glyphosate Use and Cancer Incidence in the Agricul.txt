Abstract
Background: Glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide worldwide, with both residential and agricultural uses. In
2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans,” noting
strong mechanistic evidence and positive associations for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in some epidemiologic studies. A
previous evaluation in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) with follow-up through 2001 found no statistically significant
associations with glyphosate use and cancer at any site.
Methods: The AHS is a prospective cohort of licensed pesticide applicators from North Carolina and Iowa. Here, we updated
the previous evaluation of glyphosate with cancer incidence from registry linkages through 2012 (North Carolina)/2013 (Iowa).
Lifetime days and intensity-weighted lifetime days of glyphosate use were based on self-reported information from enroll-
ment (1993–1997) and follow-up questionnaires (1999–2005). We estimated incidence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) using Poisson regression, controlling for potential confounders, including use of other pesticides. All statistical
tests were two-sided.
Results: Among 54 251 applicators, 44 932 (82.8%) used glyphosate, including 5779 incident cancer cases (79.3% of all cases).
In unlagged analyses, glyphosate was not statistically significantly associated with cancer at any site. However, among
applicators in the highest exposure quartile, there was an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared with
never users (RR ¼ 2.44, 95% CI ¼ 0.94 to 6.32, Ptrend ¼ .11), though this association was not statistically significant. Results
for AML were similar with a five-year (RRQuartile 4 ¼ 2.32, 95% CI ¼ 0.98 to 5.51, Ptrend ¼ .07) and 20-year exposure lag
(RRTertile 3 ¼ 2.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.05 to 3.97, Ptrend ¼ .04).
Conclusions: In this large, prospective cohort study, no association was apparent between glyphosate and any solid tumors
or lymphoid malignancies overall, including NHL and its subtypes. There was some evidence of increased risk of AML among
the highest exposed group that requires confirmation.
Glyphosate was introduced as a broad-spectrum herbicide in
1974, and it quickly became one of the most heavily used herbi-
cides
worldwide.
With
the
introduction
of
genetically
engineered glyphosate-tolerant crops, glyphosate use increased
dramatically in the late-1990s and 2000s. In addition to agricul-
tural uses, glyphosate is one of the most common residential

 herbicides in the United States. As of 2010, more than 750 prod-
ucts containing glyphosate were on the US market, and it was
registered for use in more than 130 countries (2).
Glyphosate is an organophosphorus compound that interferes
with the synthesis of aromatic amino acids by inhibiting the en-
zyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, which is
responsible for biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenyl-
alanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan via the shikimate pathway, a
mechanism specific to plants. In its 1993 re-registration decision,
the US Environmental Protection Agency determined that there
were no “unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans or the
environment” and indicated that all uses were eligible for regis-
tration (3). However, concerns about glyphosate’s possible effects
on human health have persisted. In 2015, the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as
“probably carcinogenic to humans.” The IARC Working Group
cited sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate in
experimental animals, as well as strong evidence that exposure
to glyphosate is genotoxic and can induce oxidative stress in ex-
perimental animals and in humans in vitro. In addition, they
reported limited evidence in humans, noting increased risk of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in some epidemiologic studies (4).
In 2005, an evaluation of glyphosate and cancer risk was
conducted in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) (5). This evalu-
ation considered glyphosate use reported at enrollment (1993–
1997), and included 2088 cancers diagnosed between enrollment
and 2001. No statistically significant associations were found
for any cancer sites, including NHL, but there was an increased
risk, though not statistically significant, of multiple myeloma in
the highest exposure category based on a small number of
cases. Here we have updated this early report, extending cancer
incidence follow-up through 2012 (North Carolina)/2013 (Iowa)
with 7290 incident cancer cases, and included additional expo-
sure information from a follow-up questionnaire.
Methods
Study Design
The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is a prospective cohort of li-
censed pesticide applicators enrolled in Iowa or North Carolina,
which has been described elsewhere (6). Briefly, 57 310 individuals
seeking licenses to apply restricted-use pesticides were enrolled
between 1993 and 1997. Of the enrolled participants, 63% com-
pleted a follow-up phone interview approximately five years after
enrollment (1999–2005). The study questionnaires are available on
the AHS website (www.aghealth.nih.gov/collaboration/question
naires.html). Incident cancer diagnoses were ascertained via link-
age to cancer registries in Iowa (enrollment through 2013) and
North Carolina (enrollment through 2012). Cancer diagnoses were
classified according the International Classification of Disease–
Oncology, 3rd Revision (7). Subtypes of lymphoid malignancies
were defined according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results Program Lymphoma Subtype Recodes (http://seer.can
cer.gov/lymphomarecode/lymphoma-orig.html). Vital status was
ascertained via state mortality registries and the National Death
Index, and state of residence was regularly updated. The study
has been approved by the Special Studies Institutional Review
Board of the National Cancer Institute, and relevant contractors.
Exposure Assessment
Lifetime
use
of
glyphosate
and
49
other
pesticides
was
ascertained at enrollment and in the follow-up questionnaire.
At enrollment, applicators reported the number of years and
days per year each pesticide was used, while at follow-up appli-
cators reported the number of days each pesticide was used in
the most recent year farmed. Using this information, three met-
rics of cumulative lifetime exposure were created for each
pesticide: ever/never use, lifetime days of use (days per year �
number of years), and intensity-weighted lifetime days (lifetime
days � intensity score). The intensity score was derived from an
algorithm based on literature-based measurements and infor-
mation provided by the applicator, specifically whether the par-
ticipant mixed or applied pesticides, repaired pesticide-related
equipment, used personal protective equipment, and applica-
tion method used (8). For participants who did not complete the
follow-up questionnaire (37%), a data-driven multiple imputa-
tion procedure was used to impute pesticide use since enroll-
ment
(9).
Factors
used
to
impute
pesticide
use
included
demographic data and medical history, as well as factors related
to farm characteristics and reported pesticide use at enrollment.
Primary results presented here use both self-reported and im-
puted data to calculate glyphosate exposure metrics.
Statistical Analysis
For this analysis, we excluded individuals who had a history of
cancer at enrollment (n ¼ 1096), did not live in North Carolina or
Iowa (n ¼ 343), or did not report information regarding glypho-
sate use at enrollment (n ¼ 1620), resulting in an analytic sam-
ple of 54 251 applicators. Individuals accumulated person-time
from enrollment until the earliest of the following events:
movement out of state, diagnosis of cancer, death, or end of the
follow-up period (December 31, 2012 in NC, December 31, 2013
in IA). We used Poisson regression to calculate incidence rate ra-
tios
(RRs)
and
95%
confidence
intervals
(CIs),
and
PROC
MIANALYZE to obtain the appropriate variance for the imputed
data (SAS v.9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All tests were two-
sided and considered to be statistically significant at an a of .05.
Risks for total cancer and for cancer sites with at least 20 ex-
posed cases were evaluated. Based on the distribution among
all cancer cases, we categorized cumulative lifetime days and
intensity-weighted lifetime days of glyphosate exposure into
quartiles, tertiles, or the median, such that there were at least
five exposed cases in each category. The categories for lifetime
days of glyphosate use are as follows: quartiles: 1–13.74, 13.75–
38.74, 38.75–108.4, �108.5; tertiles: 1–19.9, 20.0–61.9, �62.0; me-
dian: 1–38.74, �38.75. Using the Wald test, linear trend was eval-
uated using the median of each exposure category as a
continuous variable. Risk estimates were adjusted for attained
age (continuous), cigarette smoking status (never, former, cur-
rent), alcohol drinks per month (none, <7 per month, �7 per
month), family history of any cancer (yes, no), state of recruit-
ment (North Carolina, Iowa), and the five pesticides most highly
correlated
with
glyphosate
based
on
lifetime
days
and
intensity-weighted lifetime days (r > 0.4: atrazine, alachlor,
metolachlor,
trifluralin,
2,4-D).
We
also
evaluated
lagged
exposure. We calculated cumulative exposure for each year of
follow-up until cancer diagnosis, death, movement out of state,
or end of cohort cancer incidence follow-up; we then subtracted
the lag interval of 5, 10, 15, or 20 years. We evaluated other po-
tential confounding factors, including body mass index (BMI;
<25, 25–<30, �30 kg/m2) and pack-years of cigarettes smoked
(tertiles of use among former and current smokers). The num-
ber of women and nonwhites was small, precluding adjustment
for sex and race for most cancer sites; in sensitivity analyses,

 we assessed the risks in men and whites alone. For lymphohe-
matopoietic cancers, we additionally adjusted for occupational
exposure to solvents, gasoline, x-ray radiation, and engine ex-
haust, and pesticides linked to lymphohematopoietic malignan-
cies in previous AHS analyses (lindane, DDT, diazinon, terbufos,
and permethrin) (10,11). We also calculated the risk of NHL ex-
cluding multiple myeloma for comparison with previously pub-
lished studies.
In addition, we conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate
the impact of including additional exposure information. First,
we calculated risk estimates including cancer incidence data for
the complete follow-up period with only exposure information
collected at enrollment. Second, we examined associations ex-
cluding imputed exposure data, thereby limiting analyses to
participants who completed both the enrollment and follow-up
questionnaires. Finally, because the last exposure information
was collected between 1999 and 2005, we truncated follow-up at
2005 to coincide with this exposure period.
Results
Among 54 251 participants, 44 932 (82.8%) reported ever using
glyphosate at enrollment or follow-up. Among the participants
who used glyphosate, the median lifetime days of use was 48
(interquartile range [IQR] ¼ 20–166 days), and the median life-
time years of use was 8.5 (IQR ¼ 5–14 years). A total of 7290 inci-
dent cancers were diagnosed during the follow-up period. Among
the participants who used glyphosate and were diagnosed with
cancer during follow-up (n ¼ 5779), the median lifetime days of
use was 38.75 (IQR ¼ 13.75–108.5 days), and the median lifetime
years of use was 8.0 (IQR ¼ 3.5–13.0). Selected characteristics of
the study participants by glyphosate use are presented in Table 1.
Those with the median or greater lifetime days of glyphosate use
were younger and more likely to be male and NC residents than
those with less than the median lifetime days of use and never
users of glyphosate. Also, those with higher use were more likely
to have a higher education level, drink alcohol more frequently,
and have a family history of cancer.
Risk ratios for unlagged intensity-weighted lifetime days of
glyphosate use and cancer risk are shown in Table 2. Glyphosate
use was not associated with total cancer (RRQuartile 4 ¼ 0.99, 95%
CI¼ 0.91 to 1.08, Ptrend ¼ .91) or with lymphohematopoietic malig-
nancies (n ¼ 543 exposed cases; RRQuartile 4 ¼ 1.00, 95% CI¼ 0.74 to
1.34, Ptrend ¼ .43). There also was no evidence for associations
with NHL or any NHL subtypes. The rate ratio in the top exposure
quartile was 0.87 for NHL (n ¼ 440 exposed cases; 95% CI¼ 0.64 to
1.20, Ptrend ¼ .95) and 0.87 for multiple myeloma (n ¼ 88 exposed
cases; 95% CI ¼ 0.45 to 1.69, Ptrend ¼ .84). The association for NHL
was not meaningfully changed when multiple myeloma was ex-
cluded (RR ¼ 0.85, 95% CI¼ 0.62 to 1.18, Ptrend ¼ .94; data not
shown). Although not statistically significant, we observed an in-
creased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n ¼ 57 exposed
cases) among applicators in the highest quartile of intensity-
weighted glyphosate use compared with never users (RR ¼ 2.44,
95% CI ¼ 0.94 to 6.32, Ptrend ¼ .11). These findings were unchanged
in sensitivity analyses, including further adjustment for addi-
tional potential confounders, or by exclusion of women and non-
whites. Results based on lifetime days of glyphosate use and
cancer risk were similar to the results for intensity-weighted life-
time days (Supplementary Table 1, available online).
We evaluated the impact of lagging exposure on risk esti-
mates for lymphohematopoietic cancers. Results for five- and
20-year lags are presented in Table 3. Overall, the patterns of
risk for lagged exposures were similar to those for unlagged
exposures. For all lymphohematopoietic cancers, the rate ratio
in the highest quartile of intensity-weighted lifetime days of

 glyphosate was 1.00 (95% CI ¼ 0.77 to 1.31, Ptrend ¼ .43) for the
five-year lagged exposure (n ¼ 524 exposed cases) and 1.14 (95%
CI ¼ 0.87 to 1.50, Ptrend ¼ .37) for the 20-year lagged exposure
(n ¼ 270 exposed cases). For total NHL, the rate ratio in the high-
est quartile was 0.87 for the five-year lagged exposure (95% CI ¼
0.64 to 1.17, Ptrend ¼ .76) with 425 exposed cases and 1.12 for the
20-year lagged exposure (95% CI ¼ 0.83 to 1.51, Ptrend ¼ .62) with
221 exposed cases. For AML, the rate ratio in the highest quartile
of exposure was 2.32 (95% CI ¼ 0.98 to 5.51, Ptrend ¼ .07) with a
five-year lag (n ¼ 56 exposed cases). The rate ratio was elevated
and the trend statistically significant with a 20-year lag and ter-
tiles of exposure (to satisfy our reporting criteria due to a
smaller number of exposed cases; n ¼ 32 exposed cases; RR ¼
2.04, 95% CI ¼ 1.05 to 3.97, Ptrend ¼ .04). The risk estimates for
lymphohematopoietic cancers and intensity-weighted lifetime
days of glyphosate lagged by 10 and 15 years were similar to the
other lagged results (Supplementary Table 2, available online).
Also, the risk estimates for lymphohematopoietic cancers with
lagged lifetime days of glyphosate use were similar to the
unlagged results (Supplementary Table 3, available online).
In
primary analyses, we included exposure information
reported at two time points, at enrollment and at a follow-up in-
terview five years later. Among the 54 251 applicators in this anal-
ysis, 44 932 (82.8%) reported ever using glyphosate, with 40 987
(75.6%) reporting use prior to enrollment. We conducted several
sensitivity analyses evaluating the impact of including exposure
data obtained at the two time points. When restricted to exposure
reported at enrollment, the patterns of risk were the same as
analyses that considered glyphosate use reported at enrollment
and follow-up. For example, when using only exposure informa-
tion reported at enrollment, the rate ratio in the highest exposure
quartile was 0.82 (95% CI¼ 0.62 to 1.80, Ptrend ¼ .82) for NHL
(n ¼ 428 exposed cases) and 2.62 (95% CI ¼ 1.14 to 6.07, Ptrend ¼ .03)
for AML (n ¼ 61 exposed cases; data not shown). To evaluate the
impact of using imputed exposure data for participants who did
not complete the follow-up questionnaire, we limited the analysis
to 34 698 participants who completed both questionnaires, reduc-
ing the total number of cancer cases to 4699. Glyphosate use was
not associated with NHL (n ¼ 306 total cases; RRQuartile 4 ¼ 0.90,
95% CI¼
0.63 to 1.27, Ptrend ¼ .54), and there was a non–
statistically significantly elevated risk for AML (n ¼ 35 exposed
cases; RRTertile3 ¼ 2.64, 95% CI ¼ 0.78 to 6.86, Ptrend ¼ .18; data not
shown). Finally, when we truncated the follow-up period to 2005
to be concurrent with the latest exposure information, we had
even fewer total cancer cases (n ¼ 2588 exposed cases). For NHL
(n ¼ 193 exposed cases), the RRQuartile4 was 1.04 (95% CI ¼ 0.70 to
1.57, Ptrend ¼ .83); for AML (n ¼ 26 exposed cases), the RRTertile3 was
1.56 (95% CI¼ 0.44 to 5.57, Ptrend ¼ .49; data not shown).

 Discussion
In this updated evaluation of glyphosate use and cancer risk in a
large prospective study of pesticide applicators, we observed no
associations between glyphosate use and overall cancer risk or
with total lymphohematopoietic cancers, including NHL and multi-
ple myeloma. However, there was some evidence of an increased
risk of AML for applicators, particularly in the highest category of
glyphosate exposure compared with never users of glyphosate.
Like other hematological malignancies, AML is thought to re-
sult from multiple genetic and environmental factors (12).
Occupational farming and general pesticide exposure have long
been linked to leukemia (13). In 2007, a meta-analysis of occupa-
tional pesticide exposure found a statistically significant risk of
AML when restricting to cohort studies (meta RR ¼ 1.55, 95% CI¼
1.02 to 2.34) (14), although specific chemicals were not evaluated.
One case–control study that evaluated glyphosate use found no
evidence of an association with leukemia overall based on 15 ex-
posed cases and did not report results for AML (15). Similarly, in
the previous AHS analysis, there was no association with leuke-
mia overall based on 32 exposed cases, and AML was not evalu-
ated (5). To our knowledge, our study is the first to report a
possible association between glyphosate use and AML.
Risk estimates were similar in magnitude between the
unlagged and lagged exposure analyses for all sites evaluated.
For AML, there were elevated risks in the highest exposure cate-
gories, and statistically significant or borderline significant tests
of trend for unlagged and lagged analyses. The latent period be-
tween relevant exposure and AML diagnosis is unknown, and it
may vary by type of exposure and population characteristics (12).
Most studies of established AML risk factors, such as benzene,
suggest a relatively short latency period (less than five years)
(16), as do studies of therapy-induced AML (five to seven years)
(17). Long-term studies of radiation-exposed populations have
reported elevated risks of AML up to 55 years after exposure (18).
The IARC Working Group noted strong evidence of genotox-
icity and oxidative stress effects from glyphosate exposure (4).
In particular, they highlighted two studies in communities ex-
posed to glyphosate through aerial spraying that showed

 evidence of DNA damage, including strand breaks (19) and
micronuclei (20). A third study, where blood was collected up to
two years after putative glyphosate exposure, showed no effects
(21). Several in vitro studies also reported genotoxic effects (4).
There were no human studies evaluating oxidative stress, but
multiple in vitro studies have reported an increase in these
markers in a number of different cell types (4).
In our study, we observed no associations between glyphosate
use and NHL overall or any of its subtypes. This lack of associa-
tion was consistent for both exposure metrics, unlagged and
lagged analyses, after further adjustment for pesticides linked to
NHL in previous AHS analyses, and when we excluded multiple
myeloma from the NHL grouping. The lack of association between
glyphosate and NHL is also consistent with the previous AHS
analysis (5). However, three case–control studies reported in-
creased risks of NHL with glyphosate exposure (22–24). Another
study reported a statistically significant association between
glyphosate and NHL, but the association was attenuated when
controlling for other pesticides (25). Two other case–control stud-
ies evaluated glyphosate and NHL risk, but had limited power
(n ¼ 12 and n ¼ 4 exposed cases) (26,27). All of these studies, in-
cluding the AHS, relied on self-reported pesticide use for exposure
assessment, and registry- or hospital-based cancer diagnoses.
However, some study design differences are important to note.
First, the AHS is a prospective cohort study, while the others are
case–control studies. While exposure misclassification is possible
in all studies, recall bias should not occur in the AHS because pes-
ticide use was ascertained prior to cancer diagnosis. Second, this
AHS analysis includes only licensed pesticide applicators who
have been shown to reliably report their pesticide use (28,29). In
this analysis, we controlled for the use of correlated pesticides,
which was not possible in all previous studies. At least one study
showed evidence of confounding by the use of other pesticides
(25). In our study, controlling for other pesticides did not change
the risk estimates. Finally, it is important to note that these stud-
ies have been conducted in different time periods; changing agri-
cultural practices, such as pesticide application methods and use
of personal protective equipment, may impact actual exposure
levels. In addition, if changing product formulations or amounts
used are associated with risk, this may also impact results.
The
non–statistically
significant
increase
in
multiple
myeloma noted in the previous AHS analysis (RR ¼ 2.1, 95%
CI ¼ 0.6 to 7.0 for the highest intensity-weighted exposure cate-
gory) was based on 19 exposed cases with a median follow-up
of 6.7 years (5). This association was not evident in this update,
with an extended follow-up of 17.5 years and 88 exposed cases.
Three case–control studies, one in Iowa, (30), one in France (26),
and one in Canada (31), also suggested possible positive
associations
between
glyphosate
and
multiple
myeloma.
Subsequently, a pooled analysis of the Iowa and Canadian stud-
ies reported a null association with multiple myeloma based on
32 exposed cases (odds ratio ¼ 0.94, 95% CI ¼ 0.44 to 1.99 for the
highest exposure) (32).
In this prospective cohort study, we expanded a previous analy-
sis of glyphosate use and cancer risk with more than 11 years of ad-
ditional follow-up and more than four times the number of
glyphosate-exposed
cancer
cases
(n¼ 5779
compared
with
n¼ 1324). We also included additional information on pesticide use
from a follow-up questionnaire that was administered five years
after enrollment and completed by 63% of the participants. We im-
puted glyphosate exposure information for participants who did
not complete the follow-up questionnaire to evaluate cancer risk in
the full cohort. Results for the full cohort (including imputed data)
were similar to those that did not include imputed data, but only
included people who completed the follow-up questionnaire.
Finally, we truncated cancer incidence follow-up in 2005 to be con-
current with the last exposure information. Based on 26 exposed
cases, the association with AML was attenuated, but still elevated.
This evaluation has some limitations that should be acknowl-
edged. First, despite the specific information provided by the
applicators about use of glyphosate, some misclassification of ex-
posure undoubtedly occurred. Given the prospective design, how-
ever, any misclassification should be nondifferential and lead to
attenuated risk estimates. Second, because we evaluated many
cancer sites for potential associations with glyphosate use, we
cannot dismiss the possibility that these results were observed by
chance, and thus should be interpreted with caution. The fact that
no other studies have reported an association between glyphosate
and AML risk also calls for cautious interpretation. However, the
observed consistent pattern of increasing risk with increasing
exposure and the statistically significant trend with lagged expo-
sure of 10 or more years is concerning.
In conclusion, we found no evidence of an association be-
tween glyphosate use and risk of any solid tumors or lymphoid
malignancies, including NHL and its subtypes. However, we
found some evidence of a possible association between glypho-
sate use and AML. This association was consistent across differ-
ent exposure metrics and for unlagged and lagged exposure.
Given the prevalence of use of this herbicide worldwide, expedi-
tious efforts to replicate these findings are warranted.
