Abstract: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism caused
by deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. If left
untreated, PKU results in increased phenylalanine concentrations in blood and brain, which cause severe
intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems. PKU management differs widely across Europe and
therefore these guidelines have been developed aiming to optimize and standardize PKU care. Professionals
from 10 different European countries developed the guidelines according to the AGREE (Appraisal of
Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) method. Literature search, critical appraisal and evidence grading
were conducted according to the SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) method. The Delphi-
method was used when there was no or little evidence available. External consultants reviewed the
guidelines. Using these methods 70 statements were formulated based on the highest quality evidence
available. The level of evidence of most recommendations is C or D. Although study designs and patient
numbers are sub-optimal, many statements are convincing, important and relevant. In addition, knowledge
gaps are identified which require further research in order to direct better care for the future.

Background
Phenylketonuria (PKU; McKusick #261600) is a rare
autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine
(Phe) metabolism caused by variants in the gene en-
coding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PAH nor-
mally converts Phe into tyrosine (Tyr) requiring the
cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), molecular oxygen
and iron (Fig. 1) [1]. PAH deficiency leads to accumu-
lation of Phe in the blood and brain. Untreated, PKU
is characterized by irreversible intellectual disability,
microcephaly, motor deficits, eczematous rash, autism,
seizures, developmental problems, aberrant behaviour
and psychiatric symptoms. The precise pathogenesis
of brain dysfunction is still unclear (Fig. 2) [2]. As
high blood Phe concentrations are strongly related to
neurocognitive outcome, existing treatments aim at
decreasing blood Phe concentrations. PKU was identi-
fied in 1934 by Følling when he detected phenylketone
bodies in the urine of affected individuals and in 1953,
Bickel first reported the effectiveness of a low-Phe diet
in a child with PKU. In the 1960’s, Guthrie developed
a simple test to detect hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA)
in large populations. This led to PKU becoming the
first disorder to benefit from newborn screening; its
early
detection
and
treatment
prevented
mental
retardation. However, the NBS screen is for HPA and
this
is
defined
as
any
blood
Phe
>120
μmol/L.
Therefore, in every positive NBS for Phe, primary
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
deficiency
should
be

 Due to NBS and treatment commencement shortly
after birth, patients fall within the broad normal range
of general ability, attain more or less expected educa-
tional standards and lead independent lives as adults.
As a consequence, PKU is considered a medical suc-
cess story but neuropsychological deficits, behavioural
and social issues occur in some patients, and (as a
group) their mean neurocognitive always level is
somewhat below their siblings or control groups from
the general population [1, 5].
The cornerstone of PKU treatment is a low Phe
diet
in
combination
with
Phe-free
L-amino
acid
supplements. Some PKU centres use casein glycoma-
cropeptide
(GMP)
or
large
neutral
amino
acids
(LNAA) as alternative dietary supplements. Certain
patients are responsive to and are treated with BH4,
acting as a pharmaceutical chaperone (prescribed as
sapropterin
dihydrochloride)
[1].
Possible
future
treatments
include
enzyme
substitution
and
gene
therapy.
PKU
management
differs
widely
across
Europe,
even though the evidence on which management is
based is the same [6–8]. Therefore, the development
of European PKU guidelines was considered neces-
sary [8–10] and initiated after the publication of the
consensus paper by the European Society of Phenyl-
ketonuria and Allied Disorders (ESPKU) [11]. Guide-
lines
can
result
in
measurable
improvements
in
patient care [12, 13], provision of consistent, high-
quality treatment without inequality, and rare disease
awareness [14]. The key statements from this guide-
line were published recently [15]. The difficulty in
rare disease guideline development is that high qual-
ity studies that include large patient numbers are
scarse. Evidence is lacking in several areas including
treatment initiation and adult management goals.
Therefore, guidelines may change when new data is
available. The goal of these European guidelines is to
offer a standard for diagnostics, treatment and care
in PKU that would lead to optimal clinical and
neuropsychological outcome without overtreatment
and unnecessary costs. These guidelines are intended
to be used by metabolic physicians, dieticians, obste-
tricians, midwives, psychologists, social workers, bio-
chemists
and other professionals
involved
in
the
treatment
of
patients
with
PKU
due
to
PAH
deficiency.
Methods
The scientific advisory committee of the ESPKU was
asked to invite a group of European PKU experts
based on their expertise and experience rather than
their nationality. Nineteen were invited; 1 declined
and
1
resigned
for
personal
reasons.
The
17
remaining professionals were divided into 5 working
groups and supported by a project lead (F.J. van
Spronsen) and project assistant (A.M.J. van Weg-
berg). Working group members included 8 paediatric
metabolic physicians, an adult metabolic physician, 2
paediatric neurologists, 1 biochemist, 3 metabolic di-
eticians and 2 (neuro) psychologists. Some assisted
more than 1 working group and an obstetrician was
consulted by the maternal PKU group. These guide-
lines were developed between October 2012 and
December 2015.
The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evalu-
ation (AGREE) method was used to formulate the
guidelines. The literature search, critical appraisal and
evidence grading were performed according to the
Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN)
method version 2011 (http://www.sign.ac.uk/) (Table 1).
There was one update (version 2014) as SIGN decided
not to continue with the ABCD grading. At the start of
these guidelines, development version 2011 was the ap-
propriate methodology. Forthcoming updates will use
the new GRADE process.
The 5 working groups defined key questions on
the following 6 subjects: 1) Nutritional treatment
and biochemical/nutritional follow up; 2) Neurocog-
nitive outcome including imaging, psychosocial out-
come and adherence; 3) Adult and maternal PKU; 4)
Late diagnosed and untreated PKU; 5) Diagnosis of
PKU including treatment initiation; and 6) Pharma-
cological treatment of PKU. They searched for rele-
vant literature in PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE,
NHS
Economic
Evaluations
Database
and
The
Cochrane Library being helped by the project assist-
ant. For some subjects, additional search systems
were used and reference lists were
checked. All
reviewed literature was published before Dec 31,
2015 and did not exclude any publications before a
specified year or type of study design. Papers were
excluded if they were not relevant to the key ques-
tion or not written in English language. A total of
975 publications was reviewed. The methodological
quality of the studies was assessed by 2 group mem-
bers
independently
and/or
by
group
discussion.
Recommendations were either based on evidence (if level
of evidence was A or B using the SIGN method) or by
consensus using the Delphi method (if the level of evi-
dence was C, D or the so-called good practice points that
are not based on any evidence). To reach such consensus,
those recommendations without high level of evidence
were discussed with all participants of all working groups
during 5 face-to-face plenary sessions using Delphi meth-
odology. All working groups and plenary sessions were fa-
cilitated
by
the
guidelines
lead
and/or
the
project
assistant.

 Because of the rarity of this disorder, there were
limited
high
quality
papers
available
for
most
subjects,
even
though
PKU is
one
of
the
most
researched
inherited
metabolic
disorders
(IMD).
Most papers described cohort/chart studies, cross-
sectional or descriptive studies, and therefore, most
subjects and evidence did not exceed level C. Al-
though the design of many studies was sub-optimal
or they lacked statistical power, the statements writ-
ten in this guideline are convincing, important and
relevant.
Consistency, applicability and volume of evidence
were considered with some evidence upgraded or
downgraded accordingly. There was no grading sys-
tem available for diagnostic accuracy evidence.
A concept of the guideline was sent to 16 external con-
sultants specialized in PKU management. Fifteen of them
responded, while 2 reviewers chose to remain anonymous;
S. Beblo (Germany), G. Berry (US), M. Bik-Multanowski
(Poland), M. Cleary (United Kingdom), T. Coşkun (Turkey),
H. Gökmen-Özel (Turkey), J. Häberle (Switzerland), R.
Lachmann (United Kingdom), H. Levy (United States), Y.
Okano (Japan), I. Schwartz (Brazil), J. Zeman (Czech Re-
public), and patient organization ESPKU.
For subjects where the evidence was unconvincing,
this may be translated into daily practice as either: 1)
no treatment/impact of guidelines until proven to be
effective, or 2) treatment/implementation until proven
otherwise.
A grant was received from the ESPKU to fund a pro-
ject assistant. The ESPKU or other people outside the
guideline team had no opportunity to influence the
development of the guideline statements or the full
guideline document (except the 14 professionals and
the ESPKU when invited to provide their external
review).
Key recommendations
The following recommendations were highlighted as the
key clinical recommendations that should be prioritized
for implementation [15]. The grade of recommendation
relates to the scientific evidence and does not reflect the
clinical importance.

 The marks range from V (no possibility to evaluate the
level of evidence due to lack of any paper on this issue)
to as high as B. aIn statement #2, a C level of evidence is
chosen because of the high number of data notwithstand-
ing that most included papers are of descriptive nature;
bPAH: phenylalanine hydroxylase; cBH4: tetrahydrobiop-
terin; dPhe: phenylalanine.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis
Published evidence confirms that universal NBS for PKU
meets all accepted screening criteria and justifies the cost
and infrastructure necessary for the collection and testing
of neonatal blood spots [16–18]. NBS is considered a na-
tional obligation even in countries when populations are
known not to have PKU. Due to high migration in coun-
tries, a diagnosis of PKU remains possible. NBS requires:
1) a robust infrastructure in which blood is taken from
all newborns (ideally between 24 and 72 h after birth
(Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports at http://
clir.mayo.edu), to ensure timely start of treatment; and
2) a well-equipped laboratory that can handle bloodspots
efficiently. Low-income countries may consider using the
NBS laboratory facilities of other countries.
There are numerous committees and working groups
that work on optimization of NBS procedures from the
time of blood sampling, the method chosen for diagnos-
ing high blood Phe levels and the referral procedure. At
least partly, these procedures depend on national health
care organizations. The most important issue is that
children with a positive NBS result should be referred to
a specialized metabolic centre with knowledge and experi-
ence in the diagnostic procedures and early treatment
strategies to ensure the best outcome of PKU patients.
Individuals who have not had NBS and present with
developmental delay or other PKU-related symptoms,
should have plasma amino acids analysed.
Differential diagnosis of BH4 deficiencies
The differential diagnosis of HPA includes high natural
protein intake, prematurity, defects in BH4 metabolism
and liver disease. Patients with disorders of BH4 me-
tabolism including GTP cyclohydrolyase I (GTPCH)
deficiency, 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS)
deficiency, dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) defi-
ciency and pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase (PCD)
deficiency can present with any degree of HPA [19, 20].
Some patients with GTPCH deficiency have normal
Phe concentrations during the neonatal period [20, 21].
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 5 of 56
 Dopa responsive dystonia caused by the dominant form
of GTPCH deficiency and sepiapterin reductase (SR)
deficiency [22] are not associated with HPA. With the
exception of DHPR deficiency, which can be detected
by determination of DHPR activity in dried blood spots
(DBS), all other forms of BH4 deficiency (GTPCH,
PTPS, and PCD deficiency) can be detected by specific
pterin patterns in urine or DBS [19, 23, 24].
In cases where there may be delayed results of pterin
and DPHR analysis, a 24-h BH4 loading test can be per-
formed, in addition to analysis of pterins and DHPR that
would allow earlier diagnosis of BH4-responsive PKU
patients and/or BH4 deficiencies. Samples of blood and
urine should be taken prior to starting treatment and be-
fore BH4 loading. Urine should be sampled and stored
in dark conditions (by wrapping in aluminium foil) and
stored immediately in a freezer. A useful alternative
could be the use of next-generation sequencing panels
[25, 26], but this methodology is only advisable when
costs are lower and results are available within 7 days.
Early diagnosis of GTPCH, PTPS and DHPR deficiencies
may prevent irreversible brain damage by pharmaco-
logical treatment [20]. Those with PCD deficiency may
be at risk of developing non-immune MODY-like diabetes
or hypomagnesaemia and renal magnesium wasting
[27, 28]. Evaluation for BH4 disorders for any neonate
or infant with neurological problems of unknown ori-
gin is suggested even without increased Phe or nega-
tive NBS for increased Phe.
1Although most included papers are of descriptive na-
ture the level of evidence is chosen to be C because of
the high number of data.
Genotyping
The gene encoding PAH is located on chromosome 12
(region q22–24.1) consisting of 13 exons and 12 introns,
covering a total of 100 kb of genetic data. Over 950 PAH
variants (PAHvdb database; http://www.biopku.org/home/
pah.asp; last accessed 07–12-2015) are known to be asso-
ciated with PAH deficiency. The majority of the variants
(60%) are missense, usually resulting in protein misfolding
and/or impairment of catalytic functions.
Patient genotyping is not essential for the diagnosis of
PKU but the genotype can determine the degree of pro-
tein dysfunction, residual PAH activity and consequently
the metabolic phenotype. The classification of PAH ge-
notypes may allow for prediction of the biochemical and
metabolic phenotypes in many genotypes and be useful
for the management of HPA in newborns [29–32]. Also,
at least to some degree, BH4-responsiveness may be pre-
dicted or excluded from the patient’s genotype [32–34].
Patients with gene variants that determine a high residual
enzyme activity (which are those with the milder meta-
bolic phenotypes) have a higher probability of responding
to BH4 [35, 36]. Alleles that are known to be responsive
to treatment with BH4 are listed in the BIOPKU database
http://www.biopku.org/home/biopku.asp. Patients with a
genotype known to be non-BH4-responsive should not
undergo BH4 testing, while patients with a genotype with
2 BH4-responsive variations may directly proceed to a
treatment trial rather than a BH4 loading test. In all other
patients, a BH4 loading should be considered.
Prenatal diagnosis for PKU is feasible and genetic
counselling depends on many issues including ethical,
religious and legal issues in each country.
PKU classification
There is no consensus regarding phenotype classification.
Blaskovics developed a Phe loading test to differentiate
subtypes based on the responses among 8 HPA disease
types of which 5 were related to PAH deficiency [37].
However, at present, this is not regarded as ethical as it in-
creases the Phe level. In 1980, untreated Phe levels, e.g.,
those measured at clinical diagnosis, were used by Güttler
for PKU phenotyping [38]. These criteria no longer aid in
diagnosing patients for various reasons, including the
large range of cut-off points [39] and even more import-
antly, the time of neonatal screening, as patients will
commonly start treatment before reaching their max-
imal Phe concentrations [40]. Additionally, Phe toler-
ance is used to differentiate among 3 or 4 phenotypes
[38, 41]. Exact Phe tolerance is difficult to determine
because of non standardized conditions and discrepan-
cies between prescribed and actual intake of Phe.There-
fore, the following simplified classification scheme is
suggested, derived from Blau [3].

 Initiation of treatment and treatment for life
Initiation of treatment
In 1990, Smith et al. showed that every 4 weeks’ delay in
starting treatment caused a decline of IQ score by ap-
proximately 4 points [42], underscoring the knowledge
that neurological damage starts early after birth. Although
there are no formal studies to indicate that treatment
commencement even earlier is necessary, data show that
treatment in the early years of life has more impact than
later years. As a consequence it is generally recommended
that treatment should start as early as possible to prevent
neurological damage [1]. We consider that treatment
should be initiated before the age of 10 days, which for
many countries will require change in timing of national
NBS, logistical and diagnostic procedures.
There is unanimity in the literature and among profes-
sionals that patients with untreated blood Phe concen-
trations >600 μmol/l should be treated.
Except for the publication by Gassio et al. [43], no
study has investigated if patients with untreated blood
Phe levels <360 μmol/l should be treated. There is consensus
that patients with untreated blood Phe levels <360 μmol/l
should remain untreated, as this is not considered to be
indicative of disease. Gassio et al. [43] found that indi-
viduals with HPA but with Phe levels <360 μmol/l with-
out
treatment,
had
scores
on
neuropsychological
testing similar to control individuals except for 1 out of
2 executive function (EF) tests. However, this could also
be explained by HPA patients having a lower average
age than the control patients.
Because of the possibility of blood Phe concentrations
increasing with age, patients with Phe levels <360 μmol/l
should be monitored (at a lower frequency) during the
first year of life as a minimum [44, 45].
The evidence regarding initiation of treatment with
blood Phe concentrations between 360 and 600 μmol/l
is inconsistent. Campistol et al. [39] and van Spronsen
[46] discussed this dilemma. Costello et al. [47] found a
trend towards lower intelligence quotient (IQ) in those
with higher Phe levels when comparing 3 groups (<400,
400–500 and >500 μmol/l) and recommended treatment
to maintain Phe <400 μmol/l throughout childhood in all
forms of PKU. It was predicted that for every 100 μmol/L
increase in mean Phe that IQ would decrease by approxi-
mately 6 IQ points. However, the groups were very small
(n = 6, n = 11, and n = 7 respectively) and the paper had
some methodological weakness as the study included pa-
tients with untreated Phe concentrations >600 μmol/l.
Diamond et al. [48] observed that 10 children with un-
treated Phe levels between 360 and 600 μmol/l did not
perform as well as healthy control children, although this
was not statistically significant. However, their mean Phe
during the first month of life was 900 μmol/l which is also
considered a methodological flaw. In 2001, Weglage et al.
studied 31 patients with untreated blood Phe levels be-
tween 360 and 600 μmol/l [49]. This data showed normal
neuropsychological outcome data, but only a small num-
ber of patients (n = 7) had untreated Phe levels in the
higher range (>500 μmol/l) [49]. Smith et al. [50] also re-
ported normal outcomes in 5 patients with untreated
blood Phe levels between 360 and 600 μmol/l compared
to matched controls. The number of patients having Phe
levels just above 360 or just below 600 μmol/l was not re-
ported. Because of limited data this publication was not
considered [50]. An analytical shortcoming of previous
studies is that patients were arbitrarily divided into sub-
groups. To examine the impact of Phe exposure in a vul-
nerable phase of brain development consider the use of
more informative models like Widaman [51] did in mater-
nal PKU. Therefore, we cannot give any definitive conclu-
sions and consequently have decided to adopt a cautious
approach. The evidence that supports treatment is of sub-
optimal quality. The evidence that supports no treat-
ment is of better quality. However, the number of
patients with blood Phe levels just below 600 μmol/l is
considered too low and a different statistical analysis
would be more informative. We recommend that pa-
tients with an untreated Phe concentration between
360 and 600 μmol/l should be treated during the first
12 years of age particularly as good metabolic control
during childhood appears essential to prevent cognitive
function impairment in PKU [52, 53].
For patients ≥12 years old with untreated Phe levels
<600 μmol/l follow-up at a lower frequency is recom-
mended, but remains particularly important in women
due to the risks associated with maternal PKU when
blood Phe levels are >360 μmol/l. Women need to be
advised at each clinic that dietary treatment or BH4
therapy (or both) is essential pre-conception and dur-
ing pregnancy. Some may consider that during child
bearing years, women should continue a small dose of
Phe-free L-amino acid supplements to help retain
acceptance of its taste, but this practice remains un-
proven.

 Treatment for life
Since the introduction of NBS and early treatment, pa-
tients with PKU no longer develop profound and irre-
versible intellectual disability. Over the last 40 years,
studies have demonstrated that it is unsafe to stop treat-
ment during childhood and pre-adolescence [54, 55]. The
foremost question now is if patients should be treated
thoughout adulthood. There are no studies distinguishing
the effect of Phe levels during different life phases (child-
hood, adolescence, adulthood). Also different terminology,
target Phe levels and treatment strategies are given in
published studies and consequently hamper a definitive
conclusion. Here we describe studies in PKU patients
who are continiously treated, on relaxed or discontin-
ued diets and returned to diet.
Bosch et al. [56] reported that most early and continu-
ously treated adults had a normal HRQoL even though
dietary treatment is burdensome. Recently, a PKU related
HRQoL questionnaire was developed, which assesses
PKU-specific issues [57]. Bosch et al. [58] reported good
HRQoL in 104 treated adult PKU patients with this
PKU-specific and general questionnaire. Concerning neuro-
logical functioning, Fonnesbeck et al. [52] demonstrated an
increased risk for low IQ with increasing Phe levels
throughout life with a stronger association between
blood Phe measured <6 years than later. In contrast,
the meta-analysis of Albrecht et al. [59] indicated stable
(but non-optimal) neurospychological speed test results
with blood Phe levels between 750 and 1500 μmol/l.
However there were too little data to exclude the possi-
bility that lower Phe levels could improve performance
[59]. Over a 5 year period in adulthood, Weglage et al.
[60] reported that the IQ, information processing and
attention of 57 early treated PKU (ETPKU) adult pa-
tients remained constant, despite elevated blood Phe
levels [60].
In patients on a relaxed diet, Bik et al. [61] reported
that HRQoL was good in some of the adults, whereas
others suffered from severe emotional stress. In a German
study, Simon et al. [62] described that a lower number of
patients with PKU had stable relationships and patients
reached independency at a later age compared with the
general population. It is unclear how these adults were
treated, but probably dietary treatment was relaxed as this
is the usual practice in Germany.
Adults with PKU who discontinued the low-Phe diet
during adolescence have been reported to show signifi-
cantly slower reaction times [63] and subtle differences
in inhibition, attention and working memory [64] com-
pared with adults on dietary restrictions and control
groups. The older group (>32 y) of Weglage et al. [60] per-
formed slower in terms of information processing, which
might be related to their early relaxation of diet. Dietary
discontinuation during adolescence was concluded by
Koch et al. [65] to be associated with poorer outcomes in
adulthood regarding intellectual ability, achievement test
scores and increased rates of medical and behavioural
problems.
Some patients who experience suboptimal outcomes
and return to diet improve. In adults, the reported
neurological complications (n = 4) [66] and vision loss
(n = 2) [67, 68] all improved or even reversed when Phe-
restricted diet with Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
was reinstituted [66–68]. In addition Schmidt et al. [69]
reported reversible effects on sustained attention and
calculation speed in a trial with 15 adults. Ten Hoedt et al.
[70] showed in a randomized double-blind cross-over de-
sign study that short-term high Phe levels had a significant
direct negative effect on mood and sustained attention in
9 adults. Returning to dietary restrictions has been shown
to improve HRQoL in many of the adults with PKU who
have been studied [61, 71]. However, it is possible that
adults who have no desire to return to diet may not par-
ticipate in studies.
Overall it is unclear how many adults experience sub-
optimal outcomes that have impact on daily function-
ing. It is also not fully understood which consequences
during adulthood are due to Phe levels before adult-
hood and/or during adulthood, and which of these con-
sequences is improved by decreasing blood Phe during
adulthood. Neither, it is clear if Phe levels during adult-
hood will impact outcome in elderly patients.
As there is currently no strong evidence that it is safe
to discontinue dietary treatment in adults, treatment for
life is recommended, even though it is acknowledged
that dietary management is associated with significant
patient burden. Returning to the diet is very challenging
if patients have eaten high protein foods and/or find the
Phe-free-L-amino acid supplements distasteful. Patient
motivation should be strong with a supportive family
network and metabolic team to overcome any barriers.
*Patients ≥12 years with untreated Phe levels <600
μmol/l do not require treatment (statement #7).
Life-long follow up
Evidence from a systematic review demonstrates that
significant sub-optimal outcomes exist in ETPKU adults.
Issues include EF deficits, attention problems, decreased
verbal memory, expressive naming and verbal fluency, as
well as social and emotional difficulties [5]. ETPKU adults
usually show a clear relationship between concurrent
blood Phe concentrations and certain aspects of brain
function, brain metabolism and differences in myelination

 as summarized by van Spronsen et al. [72]. Some adults
who have not been treated early and continuously have
been reported to develop neurological complications such
as leukoencephalopathy, spastic paraparesis, brisk reflexes,
tremor, Parkinsonism, psychiatric symptoms (n = 4) [66]
and vision loss (n = 2) [67, 68]. Tremors have also been
detected in ETPKU, although they are more frequent and
severe in late treated patients [73]. At present, it is not
known how many patients have neurological and psycho-
logical problems and which adult PKU patients have a
higher risk of these problems. Many adults with PKU have
a vegan-like diet but may not take Phe-free L-amino acid
supplements [74] and consequently may be at risk of
micronutrient deficiencies [75]. There is increasing re-
ports of females (and not males) with PKU being over-
weight and obese [76, 77]. The risk of comorbidities
makes dietary management more complex [78]. The risk
of low bone density has widely been acknowledged but
the risk of bone fractures is still unclear [79].
In PKU, life-long, systematic follow-up is recommended
independent of the degree of adherence and (non-) treat-
ment choice, to screen for long-term complications at any
life stage, and provide appropriate support to patients. In
addition, it is not known if there will be further complica-
tions when adult PKU patients advance in age, such as
neurodegeneration or movement problems. By collecting
data, we should be able to identify if patients are likely to
deteriorate and which patients are at special risk of deteri-
oration and why.
Treatment goals and follow-up
The primary goal of treatment is normal neurocognitive
and psychosocial functioning. Blood Phe concentrations
remain the best surrogate measure, and should be moni-
tored regularly, aiming for blood Phe levels that stay
within a given target treatment range, defined for a given
age. Discussions on target ranges have focused primarily
on the upper blood Phe level but there is little data to
support the lower target level. The widely used lower
target level of 120 μmol/l is derived from published cases
describing adverse consequences at very low Phe levels
[80, 81], and from past knowledge that the primary use of
the Guthrie test was not sensitive in detecting lower Phe
levels. It is now well established that blood Phe decreases
during the day with the highest blood Phe attained early
in the morning, following an overnight fast [82]. We
advise a lower target level at 120 μmol/l until more data
is available.
When trying to reach consensus about the upper tar-
get Phe concentration for treatment in PKU, comparison
of studies was hampered by various factors:
- Studies report blood Phe in different ways (e.g.
concurrent, lifetime as a mean, lifetime as median, or
lifetime means of medians). Studies use different methods
to measure blood Phe (past data were sometimes based
on the semi-quantitative Guthrie or more reliable
fluorometric enzyme analysis but more recently amino
acid concentrations were usually measured by high-
performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass
spectrometry that are more precise). Differences
between the methods (except for Guthrie method) are
relatively small [83–85].
- Studies use different Phe samples such as venous
serum, venous plasma and DBS. Past studies are largely
based on plasma Phe levels, where it is now routine
practice to perform DBS measurements. Differences
between venous serum and venous plasma are usually
regarded as minimal with a variation of 1% [86], but
differences between DBS and plasma may be greater
with DBS being reported to be 8–26% lower [84, 86, 87].
It should be considered that a higher plasma Phe is likely
to result in a higher variation between DBS and plasma.
- There can be variations in Phe results due to variety
in measurement in the DBS itself, haematocrit, the
volume taken from the DBS, and the punch location
[87–90]. At the same time, it is also reported that
reliable Phe levels can be estimated within a minimum
size of blood spot [91].
- Studies do not consistently include confounding
factors such as maternal education, socioeconomic
status and age at start of treatment.
The statements in this guideline recommend blood
Phe as upper target levels where reported studies used
means or mean of medians. Therefore, these upper target
levels are probably on the safe side (considering current
evidence), so even with differences in blood levels due to
sample type, we still consider we have a reasonable upper
target for Phe levels.
Target Phe levels for children and adolescents
Albrecht et al. [59] performed a meta-analysis including
20 studies focusing on neuropsychological speed tests of
7 different categories. In total, 509 patients (229 children,
106 adolescents and 174 adults) and 433 controls par-
ticipated in these studies. The meta-analysis predicted
no differences with controls when concurrent Phe con-
centrations reached 320 μmol/L for children between 7
and 13 years and up to 570 μmol/L for adolescents be-
tween 13 and 18 years of age [59]. Waisbren et al. [53]
performed a meta-analysis examining the correlation
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 9 of 56
 between IQ and Phe levels reported in 40 different pub-
lications. They concluded that a difference in Phe level
of 100 μmol/l between birth to 6–12 years predicted a
difference in IQ between 1.3 to 3.1 points in patients
whose Phe levels ranged from 423 to 750 μmol/l. With
lifetime Phe levels, an increase of 100 μmol/l predicted
an average 1.9 to 4.1 point reduction in IQ over a range
of Phe from 394 to 666 μmol/l [53]. For example, some-
one with a Phe level of 500 μmol/l, on average had a
1.9 to 4.1-point lower score on an IQ-test compared to
someone with a Phe-level of 400 μmol/l. Fonnesbeck et
al. [52] performed a meta-analysis of 17 studies (432 in-
dividuals with PKU, aged 2–32 years) and addressed the
relationship between the probability of an IQ less than
85 and Phe levels. Both life time Phe levels (more than
12 months before IQ measurement) and concurrent Phe
levels (within 6 weeks of IQ-measurement) were consid-
ered [52]. The healthy population probability of an IQ less
than 85 was approximately 15%. For PKU patients the
probability was 14% when the mean Phe level during the
time frame of ≥6 years of age was 400 μmol/l but in-
creased to 20% when the mean Phe level was 600 μmol/l.
Before <6 years of age the probability was already 19%
when the mean Phe level was 400 μmol/l and increased to
30% when the mean Phe level was 600 μmol/l. A stronger
association was observed between Phe levels during early
childhood and later IQ. There was no strong association
between concurrent Phe levels and IQ [52]. Taken
together, in childhood, the meta-analyses of Albrecht et
al. [59] and Waisbren et al. [53] suggests an upper tar-
get Phe concentration of 320 (age 7–13 years), and
423 μmol/L (birth to 6/12 years), while the meta-
analysis of Fonnesbeck et al. [52] suggested that a mean
of 400 μmol/L (<6 years) is already too high as it was
associated with an increased risk of an IQ <85. It
should be noted that the primary papers considered in
these meta-analyses are mostly non-experimental de-
signs such as (historical) cohorts, cross-sectional de-
signs and case series, which in turn decreased the
quality of these analyses.
Diamond et al. [48] showed in 37 PKU patients aged
6 months to 7 years that those with concurrent Phe
levels (mean Phe from a 6 week period preceding testing)
of 360–600 μmol/l performed less well in EF tasks requir-
ing working memory and inhibitory abilities than did chil-
dren with concurrent Phe levels <360 μmol and controls.
In addition, PKU children with concurrent Phe levels
360–600 μmol/l had significantly lower IQ scores than did
control subjects, although all participants scored within
the normal range [48]. In a study by Leuzzi et al. [92], 9
PKU patients with Phe levels >400 μmol/l performed
worse than 5 PKU patients with levels <400 μmol/l and
IQ- and age-matched controls (8–13 years) in all 7 tests,
although not all differences were significant. PKU patients
with Phe levels <400 μmol/l performed comparably with
controls in all tests but the Elithorn’s Perceptual Maze
Test [92]. In addition, Huijbregts et al. [93] found that 38
PKU patients with concurrent Phe >360 μmol/l performed
significantly worse in several tests targeting EF than
matched controls. Patients with concurrent Phe levels
<360 μmol/l (n = 29) did not differ from controls and per-
formed significantly better than patients with concurrent
Phe levels >360 μmol/l [93].
Schmidt et al. [69] (included in the meta-analysis of
Albrecht et al. [59]) reported 4 groups of PKU patients
(mean age 9 years). Group A had good metabolic control
(from birth to the age of 9 years) and had a concurrent
Phe level of 240 μmol/l (n = 31). Group B had good
metabolic control up to the age of 9 years, but had a
concurrent Phe level of 620 μmol/l (n = 30). Group C
and D were not in good metabolic control and had a
concurrent Phe level of 520 μmol/l and 970 μmol/l
(n = 32). Group A performed as well as the control
group and better than group B, C and D for sustained
attention and calculation speed tests. All the other
groups performed worse than the control group [69].
Jahja et al. [94] examined inhibitory control, cognitive
flexibility and motor control in 3 groups of PKU patients
(aged 6–15) with different lifetime Phe levels and healthy
controls (n = 73). The 3 groups had lifetime Phe levels
of ≤240 μmol/L (n = 10), between 240 and 360 μmol/L
(n = 33) and ≥360 μmol/l (n = 21). The patients with
Phe levels below ≤240 μmol/l performed better than the
other 2 PKU groups and equally well as the control group
[94]. However, despite statistical significant differences,
this was not considered clinically significant.
Moyle et al. [95] performed a meta-analysis of neuro-
psychological testing. PKU literature often combines data
from children, adolescents and adults but this compro-
mises the ability to interpret the results. Moyle included 11
papers focusing on adolescents (13–18 years) and adults
(>18 years). The level of dietary adherence was not uni-
form, although the majority of patients was following a re-
laxed diet at the time of testing. Additionally, the matching
criteria and type of control groups differed across studies.
The results from the study indicated that continuously
treated PKU patients (without correcting for treatment
adherence), while displaying no significant weakness in
working memory, are likely to show reduced levels of
functioning across a range of different cognitive func-
tions (IQ, attention, inhibition, processing speed, and
motor control) compared to controls [95].
Weglage et al. [60] examined adults with early-treated
classical PKU to assess neurological and neuropsycho-
logical performance. At baseline, 28 patients were aged
<32 years and 29 were >32 years. The older group relaxed
the diet at the age of 10 years, while the younger group re-
laxed the diet in early adulthood. Significant differences
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 10 of 56
 were observed in Phe levels between the ages of 11 and
16 years. When studied for a 5 year period in adulthood,
both groups remained constant in their performance. The
older group, however, performed more slowly in testing
for information processing, which might be related to
their early relaxation of diet. From the age of 11 until
16 years, in the younger age group the median annual Phe
varied between 496 and 707 μmol/l and for the older
group, between 750 and 1038 μmol/l [60]. In summary,
for adolescents the meta-analysis of Albrecht et al. [59]
recommended a target Phe level of 570 μmol/l (age 13–
18 years), whereas the findings of Weglage et al. [60] sug-
gest an upper target level between 496 and 707 μmol/l
(age 11–16 years). The meta-analysis of Fonnesbeck et al.
[52] and Waisbren et al. [53] are more difficult to interpret
as they refer to lifetime Phe levels.
The evidence for patients <12 years of age is strong indi-
cating that a Phe concentration of 360 μmol/l should be
considered as the upper target Phe concentration. It could
be argued that within this age group the upper target Phe
levels needs to be lower (Schmidt et al. [69], Jahja et al.
[94]), but at present time the evidence to lower the upper
target Phe is not robust enough. If possible, meta-analysis of
the data available studying the relationship between neuro-
cognitive and neuropsychological outcome and blood Phe
concentrations, examining if upper Phe levels other than
360 μmol/l give even better results are necessary, stressing
the need for collaboration on an international level [51].
The evidence for patients >12 years of age is mainly indir-
ect, as there are no studies investigating the effect of Phe
levels during adolescence in patients who were in good
metabolic control during childhood. Taking into acount the
lower grade of evidence, an upper target Phe level at
600 μmol/l between ages 12 and 18 years is recommended.
Target Phe levels during adulthood
In adulthood the goal of treatment is to achieve normal
neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning. As previ-
ously discussed, it is not fully understood which PKU
adult outcomes are associated with increased Phe levels
during adulthood and there are no large controlled longi-
tudinal studies to help determine the optimal upper target
blood Phe levels. Further data collection by long-term
international collaborative studies is required to help dir-
ect current recommendations.
In
the
double-blind
randomised
placebo-controlled
cross-over trial of Ten Hoedt et al. [70], 9 patients received
Phe-loading and placebo-Phe-loading. Mean plasma Phe
concentrations were 1259 μmol/L (±332 μmol/l) versus
709 μmol/l (±322 μmol/l), respectively. The higher Phe
levels significantly worsened mood and sustained attention
[70]. In Schmidt’s et al. (1996) controlled experimental
study, 15 early treated adults with normal IQ were tested 3
times; with their usual diet, a Phe-restricted diet and again
their usual diet. Mean Phe levels were 1320 μmol/l
(720–1800 μmol/l), 630 μmol/l (280–966 μmol/l) and
1410 μmol/l (1040–2200 μmol/l), respectively. Sus-
tained attention and calculation speed improved signifi-
cantly with the lower Phe levels [69].
Channon et al. [64] compared 25 treated adults on diet
with 25 adults who stopped treatment from 10 years of
age onwards. The treated adult patients had a better per-
formance for IQ, n-back accuracy and flanker speed, al-
though the Phe levels differed significantly from 5 years of
age onwards between the 2 groups. The range of mean 4-
yearly Phe levels was 460–870 μmol/l for the adults who
remained on treatment, and 560–1410 μmol/l for the off-
diet group. The on-diet adults performed worse compared
to controls regarding n-back speed [64]. With these stud-
ies, it is difficult to interpret if consequences are due to
Phe levels during childhood, adolescence or adulthood.
Adulthood enables more invasive techniques to be used to
determine safe Phe concentrations. Hoeksma et al. [96]
using positron emission tomography, showed that plasma
Phe concentrations >600–800 μmol/l decreased cerebral
protein synthesis rates in adults (n = 16) [96]. In several
studies in PKU, but mainly with adolescents and adults,
no white matter alteration (WMA) is observed when
blood Phe is <300 μmol/l or in some cases <600 μmol/l
[49, 97–100]. Blood Phe control and its impact on oxida-
tive stress has also been considered. Oxidative stress oc-
curs in neurodegenerative disease and the brain has
relatively low levels of antioxidant defences. Sanayama
et al. [101] reported oxidative stress changed greatly at a
blood Phe level of 700–800 μmol/l (n = 40) and thereby
recommended Phe levels <700–800 μmol/l [101].
The evidence, as strong or weak as it is, indicates
600 μmol/l as the upper target level, while no study could
be found to support an upper target blood Phe level of
360 μmol/ [102]. It is recognized that an upper target Phe
level of 600 μmol/L increases the dietary burden of care
and may provide more challenges for patients returning
to dietary treatment but this was not a determining fac-
tor in recommending this upper target Phe level.

tions regarding maternal PKU)
Biochemical marker used for assessment of metabolic control
Blood Phe levels (but not Phe fluctuations and Phe: Tyr
ratios) are the primary reported markers of metabolic
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 11 of 56
 control [52, 53, 59]. Treatment is adjusted according to
the blood Phe level. The effect of a single Phe levels out-
side the target range is not easily measured. Phe fluctua-
tions over 24 h appear to be more related to uneven
administration of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
[103], rather than the fasting/postprandial state or uneven
distribution of natural protein allowance [82, 104].
There are data indicating that fluctuations in Phe
(often measured as SD or SEE) can be a predictor of IQ
[105–107], EF [106] and motor control [94], although
the literature is inconsistent [108]. As Cleary et al. [109]
described, it is difficult to distinguish the effect of more
severe PKU and/or poor metabolic control from the ef-
fects of Phe fluctuations. Additionally, further research
is needed to examine the differences between the short-
term and long-term effect of Phe fluctuations [109].
Considering the Phe: Tyr ratio, it is hypothesed that an
increased Phe: Tyr ratio leads to dopamine deficiency as
Phe and Tyr compete to cross the blood–brain barrier
[48]. Jahja et al. [94] concluded, using multiple regression
analysis (n = 64), that increased Phe: Tyr ratios were asso-
ciated with poorer inhibition control [94]. Sharman et al.
associated Phe: Tyr ratios with EF (T-scores from Behav-
iour Rating Inventory of Executive Function) in 2 papers
partially using the same subject sample (n = 11 and
n = 12). They suggested that a lifetime Phe: Tyr ratio of <6
was associated with a normal EF outcome, but this requires
further evaluation by others [110, 111]. Furthermore, in
2012, Sharman et al. found significant correlations between
depressive symptoms and long-term exposure to either a
high Phe:Tyr ratio or low Tyr, although the 18 adolescents
with PKU scored within the normal range for depressive
symptoms [112]. Luciana et al. [113] reported an associ-
ation of the Phe: Tyr ratio with several aspects of cognitive
functioning in a group of 18 PKU patients. Again, it was
difficult to distinguish between the effect of Phe: Tyr ratio
and the elevated Phe levels. Probably, the Phe: Tyr ratio is
useful, but as the Tyr concentration depends on the timing
of blood sampling [82, 114], the marker is only of value if
measured after an overnight fast. Therefore, the exact value
of the Phe: Tyr ratio in addition to blood Phe measure-
ments remains to be determined.
Frequency of blood Phe measurements and outpatient
visits
Patients are monitored with home blood sampling and
outpatient visits. The effect of frequency of contact or re-
gularity of blood sampling on adherence has not been ad-
equately assessed in PKU. Frequent contact during the first
year of life is essential to instruct parents and help attain
good metabolic control. Regular follow-up during adoles-
cence is also crucial as it is well established that blood Phe
control deteriorates [115]. After the age of 12 years, pa-
tients with PKU should aim for blood Phe levels of 120–
600 μmol/L. It is essential that adolescents are supported
throughout the transition process until they are established
and confident in an adult care environment; they should
be encouraged to take responsibility for self care, taking
regular blood Phe samples, attending age appropriate out-
patient clinics with suitable education programmes.
We suggested the following minimum frequencies of
blood sampling and minimum outpatient visits for each
age group:
During the first year of life and throughout pre-
conception and pregnancy, weekly (telephone) contact
with health professionals is important to provide close
support to patients and their families. Various life
events, such as change of school, starting employment,
living independently, as well as adherence issues (e.g.
during adolescence) may necessitate a higher frequency
of blood Phe testing and/or visits.
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 12 of 56
 It is important that blood Phe samples should be ob-
tained at the same time of the day. To estimate the high-
est Phe value of the day and reliable Tyr levels, blood
samples should be collected in the morning after fasting
overnight. Blood Tyr levels taken at different times may
be increased by the tyrosine intake from Phe-free L-
amino acid supplements.
The time between bloods sampling and patients/parents
receiving the results should be minimized, aiming for less
than 5 days. In special situations such as infancy and ma-
ternal PKU, results should be available within 2–3 days of
blood sampling. This requires home monitoring systems
instead of home sampling.
At each outpatient visit, the following should be con-
ducted: a medical and dietary history, assessment of an-
thropometry including body mass index estimation, and
a physical and neurological examination, especially ob-
serving for clinical signs of Phe toxicity and nutrient
(including Phe) deficiency [80, 81]. Clinic reviews
should always include a discussion on treatment issues
and mental and physical health (e.g. neurological and
psychiatric issues, behaviour and mood). Any additional
investigations necessary are outlined in Table 2.
Metabolic team and transition
All patients should be treated in a specialized metabolic
centre with a specialized metabolic laboratory. The mini-
mum health professionals within a team for patients of all
ages should be a metabolic physician and a dietician with
experience in IMD. Access to a psychologist is requested
by the ESPKU patient organization [11] while we strongly
advise access to a (neuro)psychologist and social worker.
It is recognized that PKU is a IMD possibly necessitating
may necessitate the support of professionals outside the
core team. That support can be for financial issues and be-
yond. Although in many countries adult patients are
followed up by a paediatric team [116], it is important that
metabolic teams prioritise the establishment of an adult
metabolic service, lead by an adult metabolic physician,
specifically trained in the management of IMD.
The process of transferring children to adult care should
be conducted under a carefully structured ‘transitional’
process, beginning from around the age of 12 years.
During this time, management should change from be-
ing parent/caregiver directed to patient controlled. This
latter process must occur even if the patient is staying
under the same paediatric service. Patients and families
need an individualized care plan and timetable for
transition, together with detailed information about the
adult centre. This should be jointly written with teenagers,
caregivers, and health professionals. This plan should in-
clude treatment goals, a timetable for transfer, and ensure
there is a consistent approach between all health profes-
sionals. It should also provide a mutual understanding of
the transition process. It has been demonstrated in PKU,
with careful planning, close liaison between paediatric and
adult teams, and patient and caregiver involvement, that
most patients are able to make a successful transition to
adult care [117]. There is no right time or age for the sub-
sequent transfer of patient care to the adult treatment
centre to occur but is commonly between 16 to 18 years
of age, although some flexibility may be required depend-
ing on the maturity and circumstances of the patient.
Nutritional follow-up
The nutritional status of patients varies according to PKU
severity and type of treatment. Except for patients on a nor-
mal diet (MHP and fully BH4-responsive patients), the ma-
jority follow a low natural protein diet with limited or no
animal protein sources. The major source of micro-
nutrients is from supplemented Phe-free L-amino acids and
if the intake of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements is sub-
optimal, this will increase the risk of micronutrient defi-
ciency (e.g. iron, zinc, selenium and vitamin B12) [118–120].
Clinical symptoms of nutrient deficiency are rarely re-
ported, and are mainly described for vitamin B12 defi-
ciency in patients who have reduced or stopped their
micronutrient supplement or Phe-free L-amino acid sup-
plements while following a vegan-style diet [121, 122]. For
some nutrients, the bioavailability appears sub-optimal
(e.g. zinc [118, 123, 124] and iron [118, 125–127]).
Functional markers of micronutrient status (ferritin,
hemoglobin, MCV for iron; methylmalonic acid and total
homocysteine in serum for vitamin B12) are useful to de-
tect iron and vitamin B12 deficiency as their plasma con-
centrations are not fully related to their nutritional status
(e.g. functional vitamin B12 deficiency) [128, 129].
In addition, some studies have demonstrated high fol-
ate levels in patients associated with the high folate

particular risk of metabolic bone disease
The first measurement of BMD should
be undertaken during late adolescence
- When BMD is abnormal, DXA (with or
without change of treatment) should be
repeated after 1 year. If osteoporosis
(BMD < -2.5 SD) persists despite optimization
of diet and physical activity, other possible
causes of osteoporosis should be investigated.
Treatment (including consideration of
bisphosphonates) should be determined by
osteoporosis severity.
- If BMD results are still low but stable,
yearly measurement is unnecessary.
- When BMD is normal, no repeat
measurement is necessary. Further study
need only be considered when there are
clinical reasons to do so.

 content of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements with
added vitamins and minerals [118, 127, 130]. The long-
term consequences of folate overload in PKU have not
been assessed. Deficiencies of other micronutrients are
rarely reported.
The nutritional follow-up requires the monitoring of
anthropometry, body mass index (BMI), clinical signs of
nutrient deficiency, nutrient intake and biological bio-
markers to detect subclinical micronutrients excess or
deficiencies. Accessing information about frequency and
amount of L-amino acid supplements prescribed and de-
livered to a patient’s home will give some indication
about patient adherence, but still does not guarantee
that products are consumed.
Bone density
The main factors influencing bone density are calcium
and vitamin D status, the quality of bone proteins, phys-
ical activity, endocrine status, genetic and environmental
factors.
Osteopenia and PKU
Osteopenia and osteoporosis in PKU has been described
for many years. Definitions of osteopenia and osteoporosis
are highly heterogeneous between studies and do not align
with World Health Organization (WHO) standards and
the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD)
positions on bone mineral density (BMD) measurement
[79]. According to the ISCD, fracture history must be
assessed alongside BMD Z-score before diagnosis can be
made [131]. In adult patients, WHO guidelines require
T-scores to diagnose osteopenia (T-score between −1
and −2.5) or osteoporosis (T-score below −2.5) [132].
In all patients Z-scores can be used, except in males
older than 50 years and postmenopausal women in
which the use of T-scores is advised.
There have been 3 systematic reviews on bone density
in PKU: Enns et al. [5] (9 papers published after the year
2000), Hansen et al. [133] (16 papers) and Demirdas
et al. [79] (13 papers) [5, 79, 133]. Enns et al. [5] found a
sub-optimal outcome for bone health in PKU in all 9
studies. Hansen et al. [133], on a meta-analysis of 3 papers,
showed a significantly lower spine BMD (0.100 g/cm2 ) in
67 subjects with PKU compared to 161 controls. These pa-
pers included early and late treated PKU patients; only 1
corrected for reduced height. Demirdas et al. [79] per-
formed a meta-analysis with only ETPKU patients.
Mean total body (3 studies; n = 133), lumbar spine (7
studies; n = 247), and femoral hip (2 studies; n = 78)
BMD Z-scores in patients with PKU were lower than in
their healthy peers, but well within the normal reference
range, respectively −0.45 (95% CI −0.61, −0.28); −0.70
(95% CI −0.82, −0.57); −0.96 (95% CI −1.42, −0.49) [79].
Fracture risk in PKU
An increased fracture risk has been infrequently de-
scribed [134].
Pathophysiology of osteopenia in PKU
Nutritional factors and osteopenia in PKU Earlier
studies described calcium and vitamin D deficiencies
[135, 136], but the calcium and vitamin D content of
current Phe-free L-amino acid supplements exceed re-
quirements. Pérez-Dueñas et al. [73] showed a positive
correlation between BMD and mineral intake and con-
cluded that the correct intake of Phe-free L-amino acid
supplement was necessary for bone mineralization. They
found, however, that vitamin D supplements improved
BMD in a cohort of patients with inadequate intake
(n = 6/28) [135]. Despite adequate calcium and vitamin
D content of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements, osteo-
penia is still identified in patients on strict low Phe diet
and good metabolic control [137]. Patients with PKU
also have an increase of calciuria, demonstrating no cal-
cium deficiency [138]. Therefore, micronutrient intake is
not the only causative factor of bone disease in PKU.
Interestingly, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) deficiency
has also been associated with osteopenia in PKU [137].
The severity of PKU Osteopenia has not been observed
in untreated MHP [5, 131, 139, 140]. It has been described
in classical PKU with various calcium metabolism pro-
files. In patients with classical PKU and poor diet,
osteopenia was associated with an increase in parathy-
roid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase activity,
both of which are related to calcium or vitamin D defi-
ciency [141, 142]. However, even classical PKU pa-
tients on strict diet with normal alkaline phosphatase
and PTH activities may have osteopenia associated
with osteoporosis pathophysiology.
Alteration of bone metabolism The metabolic profile
of calcium metabolism in PKU patients is identical to
that observed in classical osteoporosis (normal blood
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 16 of 56
 calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and PTH as-
sociated with an increase of calciuria and C-terminal
telopeptide). Demirdas et al. [79] reported that bone
turnover results were ambiguous and that it is not clear
from studies whether bone formation is decreased or
bone resorption is increased. This may be partly due to
heterogeneity in both markers and populations with re-
gard to age [79].
Natural protein intake Bone health also depends on
the quality of its protein structure as evident by the
bone fragility observed in osteogenesis imperfecta. The
impact of overall protein status, including the biological
value of intact protein versus Phe-free L-amino acid
supplements and the percentage of protein derived
from natural protein, is often not considered in studies
[79]. Miras et al. [137] described 43 patients with clas-
sical PKU on a strict low-Phe diet, 14% of whom had
mineral bone disease (MBD). The main difference be-
tween the group with and without MBD was the natural
protein intake (14.33 +/− 8.95 g/day in the group with
MBD vs. 21.25 +/− 20.85 in the group without MBD)
[137]. Solverson et al. [143] showed an improvement of
bone density in a group of mice treated with a low-Phe
glycomacropeptide compared with Phe-free L-amino acid
supplement [143], and Miras et al. [137] identified an ab-
sence of bone disease in 12/12 PKU patients treated by
BH4, which allowed a higher natural protein intake [137].
Practically an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin
D, regular exercise and optimization of natural protein
intake must be ensured. We suggest follow-up of BMD
during late adolescence (statement #22), although there
is no sound research data suggesting follow-up by DXA
or other methods.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging
PKU is associated with the occurrence of white matter
(WM) abnormalities (WMA) on magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) in both early and late treated patients
[144–146]. The pattern of WM involvement in ETPKU
is characterized by patchy or diffuse symmetrical
lesions of deep and periventricular WM (occipito-par-
ietal, frontal, temporal) appearing as signal hyper in-
tensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences and, in a
minority of subjects, as signal hypo intensity in T1-
weighted sequences. Several controlled cross-sectional
studies (with 21 to 77 PKU patients per study) showed
that the extent and severity of WMA appear to be
moderated by patient age and/or dietary adherence (as
reflected by blood Phe levels), with older age and/or
higher Phe levels associated with increased white mat-
ter involvement [147–153].
Whether these lesions have any clinical impact is
unclear and the mechanisms involved in their patho-
genesis are not known. No WMA in subjects with
blood Phe levels <300–600 μmol/l have been re-
ported [49, 97–100]. Weglage et al. [49] found no
WMA in 31 PKU adolescent and adult patients with
untreated Phe levels <600 μmol/l [49]. Bick et al.
[97], Kono et al. [98], Lou et al. [99] and Manara
et al. [100] found no WMA in respectively 2 PKU
adults with (lifetime) Phe <360 μmol/l [97], 7 PKU
children and adolescents with (concurrent) Phe <68–
514 μmol/l [98], 2 PKU adolescents with Phe 200–
300 μmol/l during childhood [99], 8 PKU adolescents
with concurrent Phe <400 μmol/l or mean Phe-year
<460 μmol/l [100].
However, other factors are involved as suggested by
the occurrence of WM variation (improvement or
worsening) in patients who did not change their Phe
values, and the wide variability of WM involvement
under similar value of blood and brain Phe [149, 150].
WMA are reported to be reversible. Two controlled
studies [154, 155] showed an improvement of WMA
(3 to 6 months) after lowering of blood Phe levels.
Cleary et al. [154] reported improvement was primar-
ily in those with reduced Phe levels <900 μmol/l and
scans improved in all 5 patients with reduced Phe
levels <400 μmol/l. White et al. [155] also found im-
provements in 12 PKU patients lowering their Phe
levels from a mean of 653 (322) μmol/l to 409 (256)
μmol/l [155]. Similar results come from single cases
and small cohort studies [97, 156, 157].
Current neuroimaging techniques are not useful in
monitoring the clinical outcome for ETPKU patients.
Neuroimaging examinations should be reserved for
those patients presenting with an atypical clinical
course and/or unexpected neurological deficits or for
research purposes.

 Neurocognitive functioning
PKU patients have an increased risk of developing neu-
rocognitive problems [52, 53, 95]. Gassio et al. [158]
demonstrated more school problems in ETPKU than
control subjects, probably related to the disturbed cogni-
tive functions observed. Although the majority of ETPKU
individuals have educational and professional achieve-
ments similar to their non-PKU siblings, they have more
pronounced problems in social functioning and emotional
wellbeing [70, 159]. The clinical relevance and the rela-
tionship to metabolic control need to be established in fu-
ture research. Routine neurocognitive evaluations should
be performed at 12 and 18 years of age in all patients. This
corresponds with changes in treatment targets for blood
Phe or life changes (e.g. change of school, living situation,
job, transfer to adult clinic.). This recommendation will
provide baseline data about neurocognitive functioning
prior to any relaxation of blood Phe levels at the age of
12 years or at the time patients are starting their adult life.
Referral to a (neuro) psychologist is strongly recom-
mended if risk factors apply as stated in statement #24.
Supplying treating centers with the correct PKU pro-
file for testing neurocognitive capacities in PKU patients
for routine care at 12 and 18 years is still a challenge. In
short, there are no PKU specific tests available to meas-
ure neurocognitive functions. While which test to use is
largely a professional’s choice and/or centre dependent, the
target should be a comprehensive neuropsychological as-
sessment exploring cognitive performance across different
domains. Reminding this, literature shows many aspects of
neurocognitive functioning in PKU patients for which, at
some point, phenylalanine-related impairments have been
shown. These include perceptual skills, visuospatial abil-
ities, and fine motor control (for an overview, see Janzen
and Nguyen [160]). Whereas for these aspects of cognition,
impairments were shown relatively consistently, there are
other domains such as language, verbal fluency, and
long-term memory for which impairments were shown
incidentally. The most consistent phenylalanine-related
impairments have been observed in the domain of ex-
ecutive functioning (EF, e.g. inhibitory control, working
memory, cognitive flexibility) (for an overview, see
Christ et al. [161]). The level of complexity of the tasks
that were used in neuropsychological assessments (in
other words: the level of executive control that was re-
quired) seems to be a determining factor in whether or
not impairments will be observed. Therefore, it is im-
portant that any form of neuropsychological assessment
that will be chosen for the monitoring of PKU-patients
captures these different levels of complexity. In young
and young adult PKUs the assessment of some complex
cortical functions, such as EFs (reasoning, planning,
flexibility, and monitoring), visuo-motor coordination
and speed of processing may be a sensitive tool in de-
tecting possible neuropsychological impairment. How-
ever, there are some issues to be solved in research
setting before we can introduce EF in routine clinical
practice 1) the consistency of EF alterations in serial
evaluations across different ages; 2) the predictive value
of EF alterations with respect to later neurocognitive
functioning and real life adaptation. Knowing all these
issues and the time consuming aspects for staff members
of these test, it will be important to continue to study links
with instruments that have already shown to be more or
less sensitive in picking up phenylalanine-related impair-
ments in PKU [162].
Psychosocial functioning
Studies evaluating the HRQoL of patients with ETPKU
demonstrated a normal HRQoL compared to the general
population [56, 62, 163, 164], with the exception of 1
study reporting a lower score on the cognitive domain in
adults [165], and 1 study demonstrating a lower HRQoL
in a group of Italian children [166]. This contrasts with
the view of patients and professionals who experience or
observe stress associated with the burden of the diet.
Normal HRQoL results may be due to the use of generic
questionnaires or questionnaires aimed at the chronic-
ally ill but do not address the specific problems experi-
enced by patients with PKU. Recently, a PKU specific
HRQoL questionnaire has been developed and has been
demonstrated to reliably assess the multifaceted impact
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 18 of 56
 of PKU on patients of different age groups [57]. Bosch
et al. [58] showed good HRQoL in 306 PKU patients and
253 parents using this PKU specific questionnaire. Nega-
tive impacts of PKU on a patient’s life, in particular the
emotional impact of PKU and its management (anxiety
about blood Phe levels, guilt related to poor adherence to
dietary restrictions or Phe-free amino acid supplement in-
take) was found by the PKU specific HRQoL across all age
groups [58].
There are no clinical studies available about the utility
of measuring psychosocial functioning in PKU but its use-
fulness has been studied in other diseases. Measurement
(HRQoL instruments) and discussion of psychosocial
functioning during clinic visits significantly increased dia-
logue about psychosocial and emotional function in co-
horts of adults, and in children with cancer [167–169],
without increasing the duration of the consultation [167,
169]. In other conditions, such as adults with cancer and
children and adolescents with diabetes, improved psycho-
social outcomes were demonstrated [167, 169, 170], but
de Wit et al. showed in diabetes that improvements dissi-
pated after 1 year when measurement and discussion
about psychosocial function and wellbeing did not occur
[171]. One study evaluating the effect on metabolic con-
trol in children with diabetes could not demonstrate im-
provement
[170].
Considering
that
measurement
of
psychosocial functioning is usefull in other diseases, this
could also be applied to PKU.
In PKU, for evaluation of HRQoL we advise using the
PKU QoL questionnaires in addition to generic ques-
tionnaires.
Mental health problems in early treated PKU
Determining the impact of PKU on mental health is diffi-
cult. One of the reasons for this is that different termin-
ology is used e.g. behavioural difficulties, mental health,
adaptive issues, and psychiatric symptoms. Adaptive be-
haviour is more commonly used and this is defined as a
collection of conceptual, social and practical skills neces-
sary to function appropriately in daily life. In addition,
studies have used different questionnaires to assess mental
health. Studies using the Child Behaviour Checklist
(CBCL) in ETPKU patients of various ages, report dif-
ferences in mainly internalizing problems such as social
problems and withdrawal, anxiety/depression, poor at-
tention and low self-esteem compared to the normal
population [172–176]. However, when these PKU pa-
tients were compared to another chronic disorder of
childhood, Diabetes Mellitus, no significant differences
were found [173, 175]. While Weglage et al. [175] found
no correlation between Phe values and CBCL scores, re-
sults of Jahja et al. [177] demonstrated that concurrent
Phe was correlated to both internalizing and externalizing
behavioural problems in children [175, 177]. Jusiene et al.
[174] demonstrated that parental emotional coping ac-
counts for 38% of the variance of internalizing prob-
lems. The reported internalizing symptoms in ETPKU
are mainly attributed to having a chronic illness.
Smith et al. [178] demonstrated an increased prevalence
of deviant behaviour strongly related to Phe values in a co-
hort of 544 PKU patients aged 8 years and 1088 controls.
Burgard et al. [179] found more moderate psychiatric
disturbances in 60 PKU adolescents compared to 191
age matched controls, although these seemed to be
more associated with the chronic condition than with
the Phe level. Other studies using personality inventor-
ies and depression inventories found no significant dif-
ferences in mental health between PKU patients and
controls or norm scores [112, 180, 181].
Arnold et al. [182] reported a high incidence of atten-
tion problems from a chart study, with a strong relation-
ship to Phe levels in the previous year. Twenty-six per
cent of the PKU patients used attention deficit hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD) medication compared to 6.5%
of diabetes type 1 patients (and 5% of the normal popu-
lation), mostly without formal ADHD evaluation by a
psychologist [182]. Lowering Phe by starting BH4 treat-
ment (without dietary adjustments) seemed to decrease
ADHD symptoms in 38 patients aged >8 years [183].
Baieli et al. [184] found no patients with autism
spectrum disorder in 62 ETPKU patients compared with 2
patients with autism spectrum disorder in 35 late treated
PKU patients [184].
In adults with early and continuously treated PKU,
there is a lack of evidence about mental health issues.
Results from Jahja et al. [177] showed that adult PKU
patients presented with more internalizing behavioural
problems compared to controls. The Phe levels during
childhood were associated with the internalizing behav-
ioural problems [177].
To summarize, in ETPKU children there is an associ-
ation of internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and de-
pression with elevated concurrent and lifetime Phe levels.
The impact of early treated PKU on mental health is most
likely to be multifactorial, associated with chronic illness,
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 19 of 56
 persistently elevated Phe values, parental coping strategies
and executive function deficits. PKU does not seem to en-
hance the autistic vulnerability in early treated subjects.
Whilst studies have detected some increase in symptoms
(e.g. anxiety) there is no strong evidence of increased psy-
chiatric disease.
Because of the reported adaptive (behavioural and so-
cial) issues in ETPKU, it is important that behavioural
screening is incorporated into the follow up of PKU. This
enables patients to be referred to the appropriate services
should severe difficulties be observed. Although there are
many tests, the test choice is largely a professional prefer-
ence and/or centre dependent.
Oxidative stress
Oxidative stress is described in PKU patients and in PKU
animal models as in many (neurodegenerative) disorders.
In PKU it could be of importance in our understanding of
cerebral PKU pathophysiology. There is clear data sug-
gesting oxidative stress is related to poor metabolic con-
trol [101, 185] and micronutrient deficiencies (selenium,
zinc, co-enzyme Q10 and perhaps L-Carnitine) [186, 187].
Due to the lack of clinical data linked to anti-oxidant
status, no biochemical monitoring is proposed. Good
blood Phe control appears to be important in reducing
oxidative stress.
Dietary treatment
Dietary treatment is the basis of PKU management. It
consists of 3 parts: natural protein restriction, Phe-free-
L-amino acid supplements, and low protein food. Al-
though we have longstanding experience with dietary
treatment, it is only in recent years that there is more
scientific evidence to support practice, but there remain
gaps in several key areas.
Natural protein restriction
Phenylalanine is an indispensable, aromatic L-amino
acid. It is essential for protein synthesis [188] and so
must be provided in an amount that supports growth
and tissue repair during childhood, and tissue repair in
adulthood while keeping plasma Phe concentrations
within recommended ranges [189].
Requirements for Phe
In order to promote protein synthesis, it is important to
give the maximum amount of natural protein tolerated
[190]. In PKU, the individual dietary Phe tolerance is in-
fluenced by many factors: severity of PKU, net protein
catabolism-synthesis ratio, energy intake, dosage and
distribution of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements, and
target blood Phe concentrations. The individual Phe
tolerance should be pragmatically determined, as minor
increases of Phe intake may not necessarily affect blood
Phe concentrations [191]. The Phe tolerance is defined as
the amount of Phe per kg of body weight or mg/day that
maintains blood Phe concentrations within the target
range. This may also be described as natural protein toler-
ance expressed as g/day. In PKU, generally Phe tolerance/
requirements per kg of body weight are highest in early
infancy ranging from 55 mg/kg/day at 0–3 months of age
to 27 mg/kg/day at 12 months [192]. After the age of
1 year, there is a slow and steady decline in tolerance per
kg of body weight, and even from the early times of treat-
ing PKU with diet it has been recognized that children
with classic PKU usually only tolerate between 200 and
500 mg Phe/day. Patients with a milder form of PKU
(untreated blood Phe concentrations less than 1000–
1200 μmol/l), usually tolerate ≥500 mg/day of dietary
Phe. By comparison, in non-PKU, the third US National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III) demonstrated that mean daily dietary Phe intakes
for all life stages and gender groups was as high as
3400 mg/day (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). A
clear relationship between Phe tolerance at 2 years of
age and at 10 years of age was found [40], although it is
unknown how this tolerance relates to the tolerance in
older patients with PKU aiming to achieve a target
blood Phe of 120 to 600 μmol/L. There is clearly a need
to evaluate the Phe tolerance of all patients periodically,
but particularly at the times of rapid growth, changes in
body composition or use of different treatment modalities
(e.g. BH4). For patients responsive to BH4, it is likely that
natural protein tolerance may double [193] or quadruple
[193, 194]. However, there still may be over restriction of
dietary Phe intake with low Phe diets (with and without
BH4 treatment). Both MacLeod et al. and van Rijn et al.
demonstrated in 8 (not clearly well-controlled patients)
and 6 (well-controlled) patients that Phe intake could
increase substantially without changing the blood Phe
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 20 of 56
 concentrations significantly [190, 195]. It has also been
shown that Phe intake can be increased with a higher
dose of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements [196, 197].
Finally, regular assessement of actual Phe intake, com-
pared with the prescribed amount is important in helping
to define actual Phe tolerance as some patients eat more
Phe than their prescribed amount without affecting blood
Phe control [103, 198].
Phe deficiency
Reports of symptomatic Phe deficiency still appear in the
literature [80, 81]. Symptoms include: anorexia, listless-
ness, alopecia, perineal rash, poor and variable growth in
preschool children and even death, while biochemical ab-
normalities include generalized aminoaciduria. Unneces-
sary dietary restrictions should therefore be avoided.
Protein requirements
In most patients, it is likely that precursor free L-amino
acids will supply 52 to 80% of the total protein intake
[199–201]. However, the optimal amount of L-amino
acids has caused extensive debate and is undetermined.
The recent Cochrane review concludes there is insuffi-
cient data to reach any conclusions regarding the dosage
of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements in the treatment
of PKU [201]. Considerations for any recommendations
for the dosage of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
intake should include:
1) the protein recommendations for the healthy
individual;
2) studies on growth in PKU;
3) inefficiency associated with the utilization of L-amino
acids;
4) any functional effects of L-amino acids;
5) any side effects associated with dosage of L-amino
acids;
6) natural protein tolerance (i.e. natural protein +
Phe-free L-amino acid supplements = total protein
intake). The latter will vary according to the severity
of PKU, age, clinical condition (e.g. presence of
malnutrition/malabsorption), growth, and use of
additional treatment options such as BH4.
In addition, the current estimates of protein require-
ments are defined as the lowest level of dietary protein
intake that will balance the losses of nitrogen from the
body, and thus maintain the body protein mass in per-
sons at energy balance with modest levels of physical ac-
tivity [202]. Such a definition does not necessarily
identify the optimal intake for health, which is less quan-
tifiable [203], or any specific requirements in clinical sit-
uations. To make it even more complex, only the need
for L-amino acids as a whole is discussed, but in fact
each amino acid (especially indispensable) deserves indi-
vidual attention, as many of them are large neutral amino
acids (LNAA) that may play a specific role in PKU patho-
physiology [2, 204].
Protein requirements for growth/physiological needs
A number of observational studies (infants to adults) have
investigated the Phe-free L-amino acid supplements dos-
age necessary for optimal growth in PKU [192, 196, 197,
205–220]. They have demonstrated that growth in PKU is
mainly satisfactory if the total protein intake (largely given
as Phe-free L-amino acid supplements) meets or is above
the general population recommendations. In the pub-
lished studies, national recommendations were commonly
based on the FAO/WHO/UNU 1985 safe levels of protein
intake [221]. However, recently, the FAO/WHO/UNU
2007 has reduced the safe levels of protein intake (in in-
fants under 1 year by approximately 25 to 27%, children
1–5 years by 17 to 21% and children 6–10 years by 8 to
13%) (Table 3) [202]. No studies have examined growth in
PKU on this level of total protein intake so these require-
ments should not be used until there is published data to
support such a low protein intake in PKU. Many centres
in Europe and beyond prescribe L-amino acids/total pro-
tein between 2 and 3 g/kg/day in infants aged 0–1 y; chil-
dren aged 1–10 y; 1.5–2 g/kg/day and >10y: 1 g/kg/day
(Table 4) [6, 207]. This data was confirmed by a survey
of 63 PKU centres from 18 countries, demonstrating
that prescription patterns of total protein intake was in-
fluenced by country and location in Europe (e.g. South,
North, West, East Europe) [222]. In general no more
than 20% of energy should be supplied as protein [223].
Digestibility and bioavailability of L-amino acids
There is insufficient data about the digestibility and bio-
availability of L-amino acids [203]. L-amino acid require-
ments in PKU have not been determined under various
conditions such as inadequate energy intake (absorbed
L-amino acids may be utilized via catabolism to provide
adenosine triphosphate usually referred to as ATP, rather
than for body protein synthesis) or on a very low natural
protein intake. L-amino acids do not require digestion
and are directly available for absorption by the small in-
testine [224]. This leads to rapid absorption [225, 226].
Not only do plasma amino acids rise more quickly and
to higher concentrations but also fall more quickly than
whole protein sources like casein [226]. In addition
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 21 of 56
 nitrogen retention [227] following ingestion of L-amino
acids is less efficacious than with casein rich protein
suggesting a less efficient transfer of L-amino acids into
tissue and plasma proteins [225, 228]. There is also a
suggestion of increased oxidation when Phe-free L-
amino acid supplements are taken in large single doses
[229], but this may be reduced by small frequent doses
of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements, particularly if
given bound with intact protein [230].
Overall, it is well established that Phe-free L-amino
acids supplements are associated with a lower biological
efficiency compared with natural protein sources and
some compensatory factor should be considered for this
in the protein requirement recommendations. Some
have suggested an additional 20% of L-amino acids
should be provided to compensate for their inefficiency
(Dutch guidelines, unpublished). This was based on
several recommended safe levels of protein including
FAO/WHO/UNU [221] and [202]. USA recommended
dietary allowances (RDA) also proposes an adjustment
of approximately 20% to compensate for losses due to
digestibility and protein quality for mainly vegetarian di-
ets, but their baseline protein requirements are higher
than the 2007 safe levels of protein intake [202].We sug-
gest providing an additional 20% of L-amino acids to
compensate for the ‘digestible indispensable amino acid
score’ and also a further 20% of L-amino acids to
optimize their impact on blood Phe control. This leads
to a total of 40% additional L-amino acids, although the
optimal dose for this function is undetermined.
For example, if a man with PKU with a body weight of
100 kg (ideal body weight 70 kg) is allocated 6 g/day nat-
ural protein, the intake of L-amino acids is calculated as
follows: 70 (ideal body weight) × 0.8 (safe level of pro-
tein intake) = 56 g/day total protein requirements.
To calculate the L-amino acid requirement: total protein
intake (56 g/day) - natural protein intake (6 g/day) = 50 g/
day. This is corrected with an additional 40% of L- amino
acids from the protein substitute = 50 g/day × 1.4 = 70 g/
day.
Ideally, the protein requirements should be based on
ideal body weight for height and age. This is particularly
important for overweight and obese patients as their
total protein intake may be particularly high if based on
actual weight only [231].
Functional effect of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
Protein substitutes should supply an adequate source of
Phe-free indispensable L-amino acids. It is well estab-
lished that they decrease blood Phe concentrations [115,
232–234]. It is also noted that blood Phe concentrations
increase when patients do not take their Phe-free L-
amino acid supplements as prescribed [232, 235]. Higher
doses of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements are associ-
ated with improved Phe control [233] and a higher Phe
tolerance [196, 197]. Some of this has been attributed to
improved anabolism associated with a higher dose of
L-amino acids but it may also be related to the ability
of specific individual LNAA (histidine, isoleucine, me-
thionine, leucine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and
valine) within the supplements to alter Phe transport
at gut epithelial level [236]. Within regular Phe-free L-
amino supplements 35–50% of total L-amino acids are
supplied by LNAA’s. Two randomized controlled trials
on LNAA demonstrate that they significantly reduce
blood Phe concentrations [235, 237, 238]. Large neu-
tral and the cationic (lysine and arginine) L-amino
acids cross the intestinal mucosa by a carrier protein
similar to that of the blood brain barrier. In in vitro
studies investigating intestinal epithelial transport, lysine,
histidine, leucine and tyrosine significantly reduce Phe

 transport [236]. This suggests that the competition with
the transport of Phe can be achieved by high concen-
trations of cationic L-amino acids and LNAA in the gut
[236]. There is also evidence to demonstrate that
LNAA block the transport of Phe across the blood
brain barrier [239–242]. It is therefore established in
PKU that L-amino acids within Phe-free L-amino acid
supplements do more than provide replacement protein
for growth and to maintain body protein mass. They
have a role in blood Phe control, they inhibit the trans-
port of Phe into the brain, and possibly via the gut too,
and evidence suggests higher doses improve Phe toler-
ance. In athletes, although exercise is considered to
have a major impact on protein metabolism and add-
itional protein may be necessary to support global en-
ergy demands, we are unable to give a recommendation
on any additional protein requirement for high level
sports as this has not been studied in PKU.
Adverse effects of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
Any side effects of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
should be considered. Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
are hyperosmolar and so may cause gastrointestinal upset
[231]. The osmolality of protein substitutes designed for
children range from 600 to 2700 mosmol/kg H20 depend-
ing on their dilution with water compared to 300–
975 mosmol/kg H20 for paediatric enteral feeding prod-
ucts based on milk protein (data from manufacturers data
sheets). Abdominal pain, diarrhoea and constipation have
been reported in a small series of young children [243].
Also, life-long and higher intake of Phe-free L-amino acid
supplements is linked to proteinuria and decreased glom-
erular filtration rate in adults [199], although this has not
been studied in a controlled way. Future research is
needed to determine if this should be part of routine care.
Dental health may be affected by Phe-free L-amino
supplements but few studies have examined dental health
in PKU. One study reported no significant difference in
dental caries between a group of children with PKU and
controls with 75% of all children being caries free.
However, they did identify more signs of tooth wear in
PKU children, associated with the titratable acidity of
flavoured Phe-free L-amino acid supplements (92.86–
126.8 mEq/l), which is significantly higher than unfla-
voured supplements (4.18–14.0 mEq/l) and coca cola
(38.56 mEq/l) [244].
Supplementation of L-amino acids
In patients with PKU who requires severe restriction of
natural protein intake, the provision of a suitable Phe-
free protein replacement/substitute is essential to pre-
vent protein deficiency and optimize metabolic con-
trol. Protein substitutes are mainly sourced from Phe-
free L-amino acids and less commonly from low Phe
glycomacropeptide protein. The Phe-free L-amino acid
supplements should be evenly administered through-
out the day [103, 233] to minimize losses of L-amino
acids due to oxidation, and to help minimize fluctua-
tions in blood Phe concentrations over a 24-h period.
Therefore, we advise to divide the Phe-free L-amino
acids into at least 3 equal portions throughout the day.
The dosage and administration of Phe-free-L-amino
acid supplementation should be managed by the meta-
bolic dietitian and/or physician.
Supplementation of Phe-free L-amino acids with added
nutrients
Many Phe-free L-amino acid supplements contain the
addition of variable amounts of carbohydrate [245], vita-
mins, minerals, and long chain polyunsaturated fatty
acids (LC-PUFA), with the aim of meeting the nutritional
requirements for a product specific age targeted popula-
tion. The aim is to ensure that the dietary needs for all vi-
tamins, minerals and LC-PUFA are met when average
dosages are prescribed for a specific age targeted popula-
tion. However, higher or lower doses of Phe-free L-amino
acid supplements may affect vitamin and mineral intake
accordingly. Two longer term observational studies have
reported the impact on micronutrient status of Phe-free
L-amino acid supplements with added micronutrients
[118, 246]. The review by Robert et al. [120] on related
studies addressing micronutrient status in PKU suggested
that there have been fewer deficiencies since the mid-
1990s when the practice of adding vitamins, minerals and
trace minerals to Phe-free L-amino acid supplements was
increased.
Balance of L-amino acids in supplements
In the normal population, there are guidelines for L-
amino acid scoring pattern for infants, children and
adults [202, 203]. In infants it is considered that breast
milk amino acid content is the best estimate of amino
acid requirements, but data on requirements from
1 year to adults is unreliable [203] and therefore any
requirements for children are estimated using a factor-
ial approach based on L-amino acid requirements for
maintenance and growth. The ideal L-amino acid
profile of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements is not
determined.

 Presentation of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
For children over 12 months of age, Phe-free L-amino
acid supplements are mainly presented as flavored/
unflavored powders (cans/pre-measured sachets) and
ready to drink liquids (pouches, bottles and tetrapaks).
Powders are designed to be used either as a gel/paste,
drink or mixed with food. Additionally, low volume
semi-solid weaning products, capsules and tablets are
available. Adherence with Phe-free L-amino acid sup-
plements is reported as a major issue, mainly associated
with their bitter taste [189, 247, 248]. Failure to take
the prescribed amount is linked with poor metabolic
control [232, 235]. However, recent evidence suggests
that improved taste, volume, presentation and availabil-
ity (by home delivery) of existing preparations has
improved long-term adherence, particularly in teen-
agers taking liquid Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
[246, 249, 250]. Therefore, it is important that patients
have a choice of suitable age appropriate Phe-free
L-amino acid supplements.
Transitioning of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
Many of the Phe-free L-amino acid supplements are
designed for different age groups e.g. Phe-free L-amino
acid infant formula, weaning and toddler products, or
supplements aimed at school children, teenagers and
adults. There are no published studies indicating the
best way to support patients transitioning Phe-free L-
amino acid supplements from one age group to an-
other. It is established that neophobia is prevalent in
children with PKU and many find change particularly
difficult [251]. A staged, systematic approach carefully
transitioning over products from one to another may
be warranted but requires research.
Alternative sources of protein substitute
GMP is a low Phe protein source derived from whey
protein, used as an alternative to Phe-free L-amino acid
supplements in the treatment of PKU. Commercially
available GMP protein still requires supplementation
with a significant proportion of L-amino acids including
tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine and leucine [252] and does
contain some Phe. In PKU, human GMP research is lim-
ited. Short-term data from a small controlled study in
older patients suggest that fasting Phe concentrations
and blood urea nitrogen were significantly lower with
GMP compared with Phe-free L-amino acid supple-
ments [253]. There is also the suggestion that GMP
lowers post-prandial concentrations of the appetite
stimulating hormone ghrelin, and may help promote
satiety [254]. So far, no long-term outcome data has
been reported, and no information about nutritional
status or GMP’s safety in children less than 11 years of
age has been published. It should not be considered as
an alternative source of protein equivalent in children
or pregnancy until more data is available.
Nutritional requirements
Calorie requirement and energy expenditure
It is assumed that the energy requirement of patients
with PKU is similar to healthy individuals, although
there is very little supporting published data. Allen et al.
reported that resting energy expenditure in children with
PKU did not differ from that of normal children and
data describing the energy intakes of patients would sug-
gest that they are close to estimated average energy re-
quirements [255]. Rohde et al. [191] found that patients
consumed 95% of the RDA as agreed by the German
speaking counties (DACH-RDA). MacDonald et al. [256]
reported a mean energy intake of 105% of the estimated
average requirement, and Rocha et al. [257] reported
that patients with classical PKU consumed an add-
itional 100 kcal/daily than patients with mild PKU and
200 kcal/daily more than patients with HPA. There is a
growing number of reports of increased incidence of
overweight and obesity in PKU [258], but in Portugal
and the UK it has been shown to be similar to control
groups [257] or general populations [77]. Although there
is some association with poor adherence particularly
in females with higher blood Phe concentrations [77,
258, 259], currently there is no direct correlation with
the consumption of a high carbohydrate foods and
overweight and obesity in patients with PKU.
Notwithstanding the importance of avoiding excess
energy intake, it is equally important that age related
average energy requirements are met for optimal dietary
protein utilization, preventing catabolism (resulting in
increases of blood Phe) [260–262]. Catabolism is defined
as degradative metabolism that breaks down complex
molecules as protein or lipids, releasing energy. Protein
synthesis and catabolism are energy dependent and thus
are sensitive to dietary energy deprivation. Insulin is se-
creted in response to carbohydrate (and protein) intake,
promoting cellular uptake and use of L-amino acids. En-
ergy and/or glucose depletion will result in L-amino acid
(especially branched chain) breakdown (gluconeogenesis)
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 25 of 56
 to meet minimal glucose requirement, which can ultim-
ately lead to a loss of metabolic control. When energy in-
take is decreased, protein required to maintain the same
nitrogen retention is increased in proportion to the energy
decrement [263–265].
Although it is aimed to give a percentage distribution of
energy, carbohydrate, and fat similar to recommendations
for a healthy population, in a low Phe diet, only 20 to 25%
of energy is provided from fat [266, 267] (a typical omnivore
diet will provide at least 35% energy from fat). This is due to
a low intake of fat/protein containing foods, and increasing
carbohydrate to provide almost 60% of energy requirements
[256, 257], with 15% from protein equivalent sources.
Therefore, a strict low Phe diet is also low in α-linolenic
acid, arachidonic acid and without dietary sources of eicosa-
pentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA [268]. Evidence suggests
that children with PKU have reduced concentrations of
DHA in plasma and membrane phospholipids when com-
pared to controls [266, 269–271]. Controlled trials with
DHA ± arachidonic acid supplements [272, 273] have led to
improvement in LC-PUFA status. It is important that con-
sideration is given to supplementation with EPA and DHA
if these are not already added to the precursor-free L-amino
acid supplement. The optimal dosage of DHA/EPA in chil-
dren is not established but dosages between 180 and
500 mg daily are provided by Phe-free L-amino acid supple-
ments for children aged between 2 and 16 y.
Micronutrient requirement
Micronutrient intake should at least meet theoretical
age-related reference nutritional intakes for the normal
population. The main micronutrient sources are chemical
and usually added to Phe-free L-amino acid supplements.
The bioavailability of all micronutrients added to Phe-free
L-amino acid supplements is not well studied, and there is
little longitudinal data on micronutrient status in patients
with PKU following both strict and relaxed dietary regi-
mens.
Low protein foods, fruits and vegetables
A number of low protein foods have been developed for
PKU and are important for satisfying appetite and pro-
viding variety in a low Phe diet [274]. The availability of
low protein foods is a key element in the successful ap-
plication of a low Phe diet. Many regular basic foods
such as bread, flour, and pasta based on wheat flour are
not permitted in a low Phe diet because they contain too
much natural protein. Instead they are replaced by low
protein equivalent foods made from food starches (wheat,
potato and maize starch). These special low protein foods
should contain Phe ≤50 mg/100 g (equivalent to protein:
1 g/100 g) of dry product. They are an important source
of energy, increase dietary variety and aid dietary adher-
ence. However, they should contain no more energy, fat,
carbohydrate or sugar than their equivalent natural pro-
tein containing foods. Although the energy contribution
from these foods has not been formally reported, they
may provide 35 to almost 50% of energy intake in severe
PKU. All patients should have access to a choice of afford-
able basic low protein foods (e.g. bread, pasta, cereal, flour,
egg and milk-replacements).
In PKU, most fruit and vegetables only yield 30–40 mg
Phe per 1 g of protein [275] compared with foods such
as milk and cereals that contain 50 mg Phe per 1 g of
protein. There is evidence that fruits and vegetables (po-
tatoes not tested) with a Phe content <75 mg/100 g of
food do not elevate plasma Phe concentrations [276]. In
addition, vegetables containing Phe between 76 and
100 mg/100 g of food do not increase plasma Phe con-
centrations when eaten in small portions. Also use of
similar ‘free’ fruits and vegetables by other countries has
not been shown to adversely affect blood Phe control in
short-term and longer-term studies [191, 277, 278].
Table 5 provides an overview of these papers.
Permitting fruits and vegetables without limitations
with a Phe content <75 mg/100 g of food will allow
greater dietary variety and freedom and will aid dietary
adherence. One exception is potatoes. They contain a
variable Phe content and their effect on Phe control of
their
‘free’ inclusion in the diet requires further
testing.
Breast-feeding
Breast-feeding offers several nutritional, psychological
and practical advantages. Generally it is low in Phe
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 26 of 56
 (46 mg/100 mL), contains long chain polyunsaturated
fatty acids and many non-nutritional bioactive compounds,
is convenient, reduces the number of infant bottles, and
provides the mother some control over the feeding process
[279]. Many studies have reported satisfactory blood Phe
control and growth with its use [280–285] and it is advo-
cated by many PKU centres [6].
There have been different approaches to breast-feeding
technique. Many have reported demand breast-feeding on
the principle of giving a measured volume of a Phe-free
infant formula before breast feeds, so reducing stimulation
and production of breast milk, thus reducing breast milk
and Phe intake. Blood Phe concentrations are used to de-
termine the volume of Phe-free infant formula [279, 284].
Van Rijn et al. [285] alternated feeds between breast-
feeding and Phe-free L-amino acid infant formula bottle-
feeding and was able to achieve acceptable blood Phe
control.
Aspartame
Aspartame (E951) (1-aspartyl-1-Phe methylester) is an in-
tense sweetener derived from a dipeptide composed of
Phe (50%), aspartic acid (40%) and methanol (10%) [286,
287]. It is a source of Phe. It is added to soft drinks, chew-
ing gums, sweets, desserts, jelly and table top sweeteners.
The approximate amounts of aspartame in foods are: a
360 ml can of diet coke is 130 mg, 1 portion aspartame
flavoured jelly is 40 mg, 1 teaspoon of artificial sweetener
15–20 mg and 1 piece of sugar-free chewing gum 5 mg. In
the 1980’s/1990’s, many small intervention (controlled and
uncontrolled) studies examined the impact of aspartame
in patients with PKU, with most studies demonstrating a
small, but consistent, increase in blood Phe concentrations
with aspartame [287–295]. Fortunately, there are many
other artificial sweeteners available that do not contain
Phe. These artificial sweeteners include sucralose, sac-
charin, and acsesulfame potassium, so aspartame is easier
to avoid in a low Phe diet.
The sweetener, neotame, also contains Phe, but the
availability of Phe is largely reduced due to inability to
break down the peptide bond between aspartic acid and
Phe [296].
Tyrosine supplementation
In PKU, Tyr is an indispensable L-amino acid because it
is not supplied endogenously via Phe hydroxylation or
only to a limited degree. L-tyrosine is important for the
biosynthesis of the brain neurotransmitters (epinephrine,
norepinephrine and dopamine), thyroxin and melanin
skin pigments. Diurnal variations in blood Tyr concentra-
tions are wide with Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
that are supplemented with tyrosine. Fasting overnight
blood Tyr concentrations are commonly low but then
peak immediately following the intake of Phe-free L-
amino acid supplements [114], even when given in
equal frequent daytime doses. In >80% of 12 PKU sub-
jects, transiently higher than reference range Tyr concen-
trations occurred although they were not associated with
adverse consequences [114, 297]. Therefore, in PKU, Tyr
supplementation produces marked but unsustainable in-
creases in plasma Tyr concentrations.
Tyr is added to all Phe-free L-amino acid supplements
providing 9 to 11% of their L-amino acids. Therefore,
most Phe-free L-amino acid supplements provide ap-
proximately 100 mg/g protein equivalent of Tyr which is
almost double the concentration found in breast milk,
and far exceeds the amount in a normal diet (in natural
protein, in general 4% of L-amino acids is from Tyr). A

 patient consuming 30 g/day protein equivalent from
Phe-free L-amino acid supplements will take 3 g/day
Tyr, and thereby exceeds the usual recommendations for
the healthy population [202, 298]. The USA PKU guide-
lines suggest the following intake of Tyr: children under
1 y, 1100–3000 mg/day; 1- < 4 y, 2800–3500 mg/day;
and 4 y to adult 4000 to 6000 mg/day [102], but it is
unclear how this was calculated. The optimum amount
of Tyr provided in a low Phe diet is unknown, but add-
itional supplementation in excess of amounts added to
Phe-free L-amino acid supplements is not associated
with benefit.
To
improve
neuropsychological functioning,
some
clinics gave additional Tyr to the amounts added to Phe-
free L-amino acid supplements [299]. Meta-analysis of 3
randomized, cross-over, trials [300–302] studying 56 sub-
jects given 2500 mg/day [300] or 100 mg/kg/day [301, 302]
of Tyr found that although there was improvement in
blood Tyr concentrations, it was not associated with im-
provements in neurological outcome [303].
Finally, adding additional Tyr powder in a low Phe diet
is problematic. Although it has a bland taste, it has a poor
solubility leading to uncertainty about the actual amount
received when added to liquids; the additional dose re-
quired is usually small and so it is difficult to measure
with accuracy and administer evenly throughout the day.
Large neutral amino acids
Non Phe LNAA include tryptophan, Tyr, histidine, me-
thionine, threonine, leucine, isoleucine and valine. They
are considered to have several potential functions in
PKU: 1) lower blood Phe by competing with Phe uptake
at the blood gut barrier [236–238] although this is not
reported by all studies; 2) reducing brain Phe concentra-
tions by providing competition with Phe to cross the
blood-brain barrier [240, 242, 304, 305]; 3) increasing
cerebral neurotransmitter concentrations (serotonin, nor-
epinephrine, and epinephrine) [242]; and 4) increasing
some cerebral large neutral amino acid concentrations
such as Tyr, tryptophan, valine, leucine and isoleucine and
BCAA [242]. However, in a randomised controlled trial of
16 patients, Schindeler et al. [235] examined the effect of
LNAA in combination with diet and Phe-free L-amino
acid supplements. They concluded that additional sup-
plementation of LNAA was of limited value, but it may
be of benefit in those unable to adhere to their Phe-free
L-amino acid supplements [235].
Although some centres routinely administer Phe-free
LNAA supplements to older patients who are unable to
adhere to dietary treatment, these supplements remained
untested in children under the age of 11 years. Their use
is also not reported in pregnancy. Overall in PKU, there
has been little evidence to support their routine use and
further research is required to ascertain the ideal dos-
ages and amount of each specific L-amino acid within
the LNAA supplement.
Illness
It is well established that Phe levels increase during illness.
Although patients are not at acute risk, Phe concentra-
tions are likely to remain high until symptoms have
abated. In addition, as shown with other IMD, it is known
that children experience more illness episodes in the early
years when, in PKU, they are particularly vulnerable to the
effects of sustained high (and maybe also to fluctuating)
Phe concentrations. In general, medical management of
illness should be the same as for other children. However,
some precautions are of importance as discussed in the
next paragraph.
Infection, as occurs in all infants and children, affects
their need for and utilization of energy and protein. Ac-
cording to Gardiner and Barbul [306], the ability of the
small intestine to absorb L-amino acids is impaired dur-
ing sepsis. Metabolic changes during infection include
increased nitrogen loss, increased need for energy, catab-
olism of muscle protein leading to elevation of plasma Phe
concentrations, conversion of L-amino acids to glucose,
and decreased synthesis of acute phase proteins by the
liver. Mild to moderate infection increases energy require-
ments by 20 to 30% [307]. Severe infection increases en-
ergy needs by approximately 50% above basal level [308]
and it is estimated there is a 13% increase in energy ex-
penditure per degree Celsius of fever [309]. Carbohydrate
has been shown to improve nitrogen balance more than
the isocaloric amount of fat in catabolic patients on paren-
teral nutrition [310]. In addition, there is evidence that
Phe-free L-amino acid supplements suppress blood Phe
concentrations [234]. Therefore, we consider it important
that Phe-free L-amino acid supplements and high carbo-
hydrate drinks are administered during infection to help
decrease muscle protein loss and potentally lessen impact
on deteriorating blood Phe control, although this remains
unstudied. The importance of lowering natural protein
during each illness episode is also unclear, although lower-
ing natural protein during illness episodes may be
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162

 necessary in patients treated by diet and/or BH4 [311].
Antipyretics should be administered for high tempera-
tures. Treatment with antipyretics/analgesics like para-
cetamol
and
ibuprofen
should
be
considered
to
improve food, fluid and energy intake during illness.
Table 6 summarizes dietary advice for illness.
For any illness, if suitable aspartame-free medication
cannot be sourced, it is better to use aspartame-
containing medications (for example antibiotics) rather
than leave a child without treatment. Special attention
should be given to ensure routine vaccination according
to international/national standards. Gastroenteritis leads
to a catabolic status. In young infants, oral vaccination
against rotavirus is possible and recommended in most
countries.
Parenteral nutrition
There is very limited information about the management
and outcome of patients with PKU requiring treatment
with parenteral nutrition. Infants, particularly those who
are premature, and young children requiring long-term
parenteral nutrition, are likely to be at risk from per-
manent damage if blood Phe concentrations cannot be
controlled. Single case studies of premature infants with
PKU given standard preparations of amino acid intra-
venous solutions for limited periods have had very high
blood Phe levels although apparently without adverse ef-
fects on long-term neurological outcome [312–314]. A
specially
prepared
Phe-free
intravenous
amino
acid
solution has been used in a 6 year old with PKU with an
intra-abdominal malignancy, which effectively prevented
high Phe levels [315]. A commercially available prepar-
ation with a lower content of branched chain amino
acids designed for use in hepatic failure was used in a
premature infant with PKU as this preparation also con-
tained less than usual Phe [312] and in a child with a fa-
cial tumour [316]. However elevated Phe levels could
not be completly prevented in these cases.
Support
Living with a life-long severe dietary restriction may
adversely affect eating attitudes and behaviours and
increase susceptibility to the development of eating
disturbances [317]. Coping with and adhering to diet-
ary treatment has been described as a stressor to both
the patient and the family. Feeding behaviour prob-
lems are more common in young children with PKU
[115, 243] and appear associated with the management
of feeding behaviour rather than intrinsic to the condi-
tion. Food neophobia is also more prevalent in chil-
dren with PKU, with children being particular about
their food choices and untrusting of new foods when
compared with control children without PKU [251].
However, early intervention, working alongside psy-
chologists and play therapists, can play an important
role in improving feeding behaviors and family meal-
time interactions. Strategies that are used for general
feeding problems apply to children with PKU e.g. posi-
tive caregiver role modelling, gradually increasing fa-
miliarity with new foods, consistent mealtime routines
with adequate time allocation for eating.
It is commonly reported that children may need con-
stant coercion to take their Phe-free L-amino acid sup-
plements which is exhausting for caregivers and some
may resort to strategies such as yelling, grounding or
taking away privileges [247]. A study of feeding prob-
lems in young children indicated that almost 50% had
difficulty with its administration and all children had
been given Phe-free L-amino acid supplements since
early infancy [243]. Some of these problems may have
been related to the developmental age of children or
consistency of approach by caregivers. Overall, there is
lack of research on the best strategies to support care-
givers in the maintenance of administration of Phe-free
L-amino acid supplements.
In adolescents and adults with PKU the occurrence of
eating disorders has not been systematically explored
and rarely reported so may be undetected and un-
treated. This is an area that requires further study in
PKU. Regular health professional support, especially
from a psychologist, may provide some measure of pro-
tection.

 Treatment in specific patient groups
Maternal PKU
PKU treatment aims to prevent maternal PKU syndrome
[318]. High blood Phe levels during pregnancy have a
teratogenic effect on the developing foetus that can result
in growth retardation, microcephaly, intellectual disabil-
ities and birth defects, including congenital heart defects
(CHD) [318, 319]. When treatment recommendations are
adhered to, the chances of a good outcome are compar-
able to the normal population.
Risk of CHD
Lenke and Levy [318] reported CHD in 27 infants of
mothers with assigned blood Phe levels (APL) of
>1200 μmol/l and in 7 infants when blood Phe levels
were between 900 and 1200 μmol/l. These APL were
selected as the highest of 2 or 3 plasma Phe levels [318].
In the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS),
Levy et al. [320] described 34 offspring with CHD from
pregnancies in women with PKU and in 1 offspring
from a mother with MHP. All PKU mothers had APL
>900 μmol/l and did not achieve metabolic control be-
fore the 8th week of gestation [320]. In a further report
from the MPKUCS, Platt et al. [321] described 31 off-
spring with CHD. When maternal blood Phe levels were
120–360 μmol/l during the first 8 weeks of gestation, no
cases of CHD were described; when Phe levels were 360–
600 μmol/l, there was one case of CHD; when Phe levels
were 600–900 μmol/l, there were 5 cases of CHD; and
when Phe levels were >900 μmol/l, there were 26 cases of
CHD [321]. Table 7 provides the percentages of offspring
with CHD.
In untreated or non-optimally treated pregnancies, in-
creased frequencies of intrauterine growth retardation
(IUGR), intellectual disability, microcephaly [318, 319, 322]
and other congenital abnormalities have been described in
the MPKUCS [323] and case reports (Table 8).
No treatment
For PKU women of childbearing age, no treatment is ne-
cessary when untreated blood Phe levels are <360 μmol/l.
Levy et al. [324] showed that mean untreated blood Phe
levels <400 μmol/l had no effect on birth measurements
and no effect on offspring IQ. Platt et al. [321] confirmed
no increased rate of birth defects in (un)treated blood Phe
levels between 120 and 360 μmol/l. Levy et al. [325] even
demonstrated that there was no correlation between the
offspring’s IQ and mothers untreated APL <600 μmol/l.
Waisbren et al. [326] reported that the offspring of women
with untreated MHP had cognitive and behavioural devel-
opment similar to control subjects.
Treatment goals/target Phe levels
Woman with PKU should start a Phe-restricted diet be-
fore conception. Many features of the maternal PKU syn-
drome are preventable by starting a low Phe diet before
conception or early in pregnancy [319, 320, 327–329].
Children born to mothers with PKU who attain satisfac-
tory blood Phe control before or very early in pregnancy
appear to begin life with normal potential. Maternal delay
in attainment of acceptable blood Phe control is associ-
ated with decline in offspring developmental outcome/IQ
scores [326, 329, 330].
In prospective studies, there is no effect on infant birth
measurements and final IQ when mother’s mean blood
Phe levels are <360 μmol/l. The MPKUCS study indi-
cated that the major factors associated with good child
outcome was normal maternal intelligence and well-treated
pregnancies with blood Phe control between 120 and
360 μmol/l [319, 322, 326, 329]. Widaman [51] demon-
strated a threshold effect of a mother’s average blood Phe
value of 400 μmol/l in relationship to offspring’s IQ. With
every further increase of 60 μmol/l Phe, the IQ drops by 4.7
points [51]. In addition it seems to be important that blood
Phe concentrations are maintained consistently even within
target range [330]. The prevention of CHD requires initi-
ation of the low Phe diet before conception or early in preg-
nancy (<8th week) [320]. Dietary management that is too
strict may be associated with a risk of IUGR in the offspring
as described by Teissier et al. [331]. As IUGR is related
to an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease
and hypertension later in life, Phe levels below 120 μmol/l
should be avoided.

 As women with untreated Phe levels between 360 and
600 μmol/l need to return to dietary treatment prior to
conception, some may consider that during child bearing
years, women should continue a small dose of Phe-free
L-amino acid supplements to help retain acceptance of
its taste, but this practice remains unproven.
For optimal pre-conception treatment, stable blood
Phe control within target range should be maintained
before PKU women conceive. The time to reach stable
and acceptable blood Phe concentrations varies be-
tween women. It is influenced by personal conditions
(organizational skills, IQ, work conditions) and family
support, which will affect the ability to adhere to strict
long-term diet. In general women planning pregnancy
are well motivated. The timing of medical consent to
stop contraceptive strategies varies between centres and
countries. In some European centres, women with
blood Phe levels within target range for as little as
2 weeks may be advised to stop contraceptives, other
centres may advise several months. We recommend
contraceptive strategies should only be discontinued
after stable Phe levels within target range have been
achieved for a minimum of 2 weeks. There is no evidence
that maintaining blood Phe levels within target range for a
period of 2–3 months vs 2 weeks pre-conception is associ-
ated with better outcome. Shorter pre-conception periods
may help maintain patient motivation. However, achieving
‘blood Phe levels within target for at least 2 weeks’ may
take several weeks as some women with PKU need time
to adapt to the rigorous demands of a low Phe diet and
obtain regular and consistent access to special dietary
products.
Pregnancy planning and medical follow-up
Maternal PKU is considered a high risk pregnancy as it
is difficult to prevent high or low blood Phe concentra-
tions, necessitating follow-up by a obstetrician well in-
formed about PKU as well as a metabolic dietician and
metabolic physician. Minimal outpatient clinic visits of
once during each trimester is recommended, but many
health practitioners may advocate more frequent follow-
up and the intensity of monitoring will depend on indi-
vidual needs and metabolic control.
Metabolic control is based on weekly Phe blood spots
pre-conception and at least twice weekly during preg-
nancy, with speedy laboratory turnaround times.
PKU women should undertake the same pre-conception
screening as recommended for healthy women and should
receive education about healthy lifestyle and behaviour.
These recommendations are found in the (inter)national
maternity guidelines [332].
As maternal PKU treatment needs considerable effort
from the woman and her partner, failure to conceive re-
quires special attention. Therefore, it is reasonable to
refer well-controlled patients to a fertility specialist earl-
ier than after 1 year (the WHO criteria of sterility) and it
seems appropriate to recommend a time period of
6 months [333].
In maternal PKU there are 2 main risks for fetal devel-
opment: growth retardation and birth defects including
CHD.
Therefore,
detailed
follow-up
by
ultrasound
examination specific for high risk pregnancies (especially
for inadequate metabolic control) is highly recom-
mended from the very early beginning of pregnancy
with screening for organ development at 18–22 weeks
of pregnancy [320, 334].
Post delivery women with PKU should receive routine
obstetric care and should be encouraged to return to
standard dietary or pharmacological treatment [335].
There is a relationship between postnatal child stimula-
tion in the home environment and their developmental
outcomes [326]. There are no studies available about
Phe toxicity of the mother post-delivery and the risk of
postnatal depression.

 Offspring follow up after delivery Infants suffering
from a birth defect or severe health problems must be
treated after birth. An echocardiogram should be consid-
ered in all infants who are conceived by women with high
blood Phe levels and in those with poor maternal blood
Phe control during pregnancy [333]. After sub-optimal
pregnancy treatment, infants commonly have smaller
birth measurements and delayed cognitive development.
Children should be followed up, preferably in specialized
centres, similarly to other ‘at risk’ infants e.g. preterm in-
fants or small for gestational aged children.
Prevention of unplanned pregnancies
Unplanned pregnancies in woman with PKU are a sig-
nificant health problem [336]. In 2008 in Europe, in the
general population 44% of conceptions were unplanned
[337]. Prevention of the maternal PKU syndrome re-
quires ongoing education from childhood into adulthood
about foetal risks associated with high plasma Phe
concentrations and importance of pregnancy planning
[338, 339]. This information should be re-inforced by all
members of the core PKU team. Patients with PKU also
consider that counselling and education on the dangers
of unplanned pregnancy is required [11]. For women
with untreated Phe levels <600 μmol/l who may have
stopped diet in adolescence, a robust transition process
between paediatric and adult services is essential to ensure
they are not lost to follow-up. Clinic patient registries and
on-going contact with the PKU team are important.
PKU women at childbearing age, with all forms of HPA,
should receive detailed counselling regarding family plan-
ning and the risks of adverse foetal effects as a conse-
quence of elevated Phe levels. If teenage PKU girls and
women are suspected of sexual activity, the most effective
birth control methods should be advised. In 60 PKU
women, factors associated with contraception usage were
the extent to which women felt socially supported to use
contraception (r = 0.64) along with positive attitudes
about birth control (r = 0.66) and knowledge of family
planning (r = 0.43) [340].
From the age of 12 years (beginning of puberty), all
patients should receive systematic age-related sex edu-
cation, with professional counselling about the risk of
unprotected sexual contacts. They should be informed
that unplanned pregnancy can occur even during the
first menstrual cycle. At least one PKU team member
should be able to provide sex education information.
Pre-conception education initiatives that have been de-
veloped in for example diabetes could be adapted for
PKU care [341, 342].
It is important that all advice is individually tailored,
particularly for women with psychological and/or intellec-
tual impairment. Individual cultural and religious back-
ground should be considered in patient counselling.
Nutritional recommendation in maternal PKU
The nutritional status of women with PKU both during
pre-conception and pregnancy is likely to have signifi-
cant influence on foetal and infant outcomes. Attentive
and proactive management is essential. Maternal weight
loss, over restriction of Phe intake, lack of folic acid, and
vitamin B12 may all affect foetal outcome. Practical edu-
cation of women giving them the skills and knowledge
to manage their dietary treatment is a key component of
care.
Phe tolerance Maternal Phe tolerance is influenced by
the severity of PKU but will vary even between pregnan-
cies in the same patient according to adherence with
Phe-free L- amino acid supplements, adequacy of energy
intake and changes in weight, trimester of pregnancy,
and existence of foetal PKU. Reported Phe tolerance is
given in Table 9. If the foetus has PKU, it has been re-
ported that Phe tolerance barely increases in the second
and third trimester of pregnancy [343]; thereby a low
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 32 of 56
 Phe tolerance in the third trimester of pregnancy may
indicate foetal PKU [343].
From the second trimester onwards a period of rap-
idly increasing Phe requirement begins owing to foetal-
maternal anabolism. As Phe is an essential L-amino
acid, it is important that dietary Phe intake is increased
(by 50 to 100 mg/day) without delay if blood Phe con-
centrations are ≤120 μmol/L. Slow increases in natural
protein intake may prolong the length of time blood
Phe concentrations are <120 μmol/l. Teissier et al. re-
ported from 155 pregnancies in 86 PKU women that
Phe intakes were lower in a group with IUGR from the
fifth to the 8 month of pregnancy. The longer the dur-
ation of time blood Phe below 120 μmol/l, the higher
the risk of IUGR [331].
Weight gain and energy requirements Low energy in-
take, accompanied by weight loss is common, particu-
larly in the first trimester of pregnancy in PKU and this
is associated with higher blood Phe concentrations
[344]. Inadequate energy intake may be due to dislike
of low protein foods, poor adherence with lack of Phe-
free L-amino acid supplements, limited availability of
low protein foods, inability to prepare low protein
meals or poor appetite associated with nausea and
vomiting. Poor maternal weight gain (less than 70% of
recommended) and foetal microcephaly are correlated
[345]. Microcephaly significantly decreases when ma-
ternal weight gain is adequate [345]. There is also evi-
dence
that
inadequate
gestational
weight
gain
is
associated with decreased foetal growth and birth
weight both in the general population [346] and in PKU
[347, 348], although further study is required. Data
from a French survey reported in 135 pregnancies that
the BMI of mothers was lower than the general popula-
tion but there was no direct correlation with IUGR in
children [349]. In a single adult centre in London,
women with PKU lost weight in the first trimester and
had a weight gain below that recommended for preg-
nancy [330], probably reflecting a low energy intake.
In the MPKUCS, maternal energy intake was signifi-
cantly and negatively correlated with plasma Phe concen-
trations during the last 2 trimesters of pregnancy [350]. In
addition, case studies have described difficulty in main-
taining blood Phe control due to weight loss and low en-
ergy intake in the first trimester [347, 351].
Energy requirements vary considerably for individuals
but they should be tailored to pre-pregnancy BMI, rate
of weight gain, maternal age, gestational stage of preg-
nancy, physical activity levels and blood Phe control.
Any additional energy costs associated with the mainten-
ance of a normal pregnancy are due to greater maternal
and foetal-placental tissue mass, increased energy ex-
penditure attributable to increased basal metabolism and
changes in the energy cost of physical activity [352, 353].
Published guidelines for normal maternal energy require-
ments do vary between ‘expert’ groups and are given in
Table 10. Most dietary studies in well-nourished women
in non-PKU pregnancy have shown no or only minor
increases in energy intake that only partially cover the
estimated energy cost of pregnancy [353]. The best way
to determine if energy needs are being met is to care-
fully monitor maternal weight change in pregnancy.
Birth weights between 3.1 and 3.6 kg (mean, 3.3 kg) are
associated with the optimal ratio of maternal and foetal
health outcomes [354]. This is in turn associated with a
pregnancy weight gain of 10–14 kg (mean 12 kg) [354].
If there is maternal weight loss, additional energy from
low protein foods (e.g. pasta, bread) and energy supple-
ments (glucose polymer/fat emulsions) should be con-
sidered, and weight monitored weekly until weight gain
is satisfactory [355]. However, excess weight gain should
also be prevented as maternal obesity is associated with
additional complications throughout pregnancy and
increased health risks to the mother and her infant

 [356, 357]. Overall, in maternal PKU weight gain
should be similar to the healthy population (Table 11)
with emphasis on avoiding weight loss particularly in
the first trimester of pregnancy.
Protein requirement Additional protein requirement
during pregnancy is due to newly deposited protein and
the maintenance costs associated with increased body
weight [202]. The recommended additional protein in-
take recommended by FAO/WHO/UNU [202] in non-
PKU pregnancy is 1 g/day during the first trimester,
10 g/day during the second trimester and 31 g/day dur-
ing the third trimester, with an efficiency for protein
utilization estimated to be 42%. In maternal PKU, total
protein requirements are not accurately defined and can
only be extrapolated from non-PKU maternal require-
ments. Reports of protein prescription from Phe-free
L-amino acid supplements (with or without natural
protein) have varied widely: reference nutrient intake
(RNI) + 15% [355], ≥70 g/day total protein [102], and
100 g/day amino acids [358]. There are no reported
studies examining the utilisation of Phe-free L-amino
acid supplements in specifically maternal PKU.
However, it is established that the delivery of the pre-
scribed amount of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements is
important during pregnancy. In the MPKUCS study, lower
total protein intakes (<USA RNI) were associated with
worse blood Phe control [348]. In another report, mothers
who had an inadequate protein intake (less than 50% of
recommended amounts) in the first trimester mainly due
to nausea and vomiting, together with poor metabolic
control, had a higher risk of CHD compared to mothers
who had an adequate protein intake and similar blood Phe
concentrations [345, 359]. Lower maternal total protein
intakes were negatively associated with birth weight and
length of the newborns [348]. Lower concentrations of the
amino acids: proline, valine, methionine, isoleucine, lysine
and arginine in PKU mothers have also been linked with
low intake of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements and a
higher risk of CHD in their offspring [360]. Inadequate in-
take of micronutrient supplemented Phe-free L-amino
supplement has been associated with low intakes of vita-
min B12 and this is also associated with an increased risk
of CHD [359].
Duran et al. demonstrated the impact of good ad-
herence with Phe-free L-amino acid supplements on
lowering
blood
Phe
concentrations
in
pregnant
women [232].
We have adopted the recommendation that in mater-
nal PKU, a total protein intake of ≥70 g/day is required,
but it is also important to consider individual patient
weight and the additional protein requirements of each
pregnancy trimester. In maternal PKU, more data is re-
quired about prescribed and actual total protein intakes
compared with infant outcome measures. The protein
substitutes based on LNAA [361] and glycomacropep-
tide have not been reported during pregnancy and are
thereby not recommended for maternal PKU until their
safe use is established.

 Tyrosine supplementation Many PKU centres advocate
additional Tyr supplementation at some stage during
pregnancy [333, 347, 351, 362–371], although the specific
requirement in maternal PKU is unknown. The amount of
Tyr supplementation given is highly variable and usually
without justification for the dose chosen (Table 12). Nor-
mally, Tyr is a non-essential amino acid synthesized from
Phe. In PKU, Tyr cannot be synthesized from Phe, result-
ing in lower blood Tyr concentrations. It has been pro-
posed that some of the birth defects seen in maternal
PKU may be related to low Tyr concentrations [372], and
that Tyr supplementation during pregnancy may help im-
prove foetal outcome [370].
In non-maternal PKU, it has been established that Tyr
supplementation raises blood Tyr [303]. In maternal
PKU, Tyr supplementation raises maternal Tyr concen-
trations above the recommended minimum concentra-
tion (>45 μmol/l) for a period of ≥3 h and is associated
with a markedly increased ratio of Tyr to LNAA [370].
However, Tyr supplementation leads to variation in blood
Tyr between fasting and fed state, and Tyr concentrations
>200 μmol/L have been observed at some time points
within a 24-h period [297]. It is also suggested that foetal
Tyr concentrations in blood will be some 1.8 to 3.3 times
higher than in the maternal blood [297, 373]. A toxic ef-
fect of a combination of mildly increased Phe and Tyr was
demonstrated experimentally in rats [374].
The FAO/WHO/UNU 2007 suggests the aromatic amino
acids (Phe/Tyr combined) requirements for healthy adults
are only 30 mg/g protein [202]. Therefore, women taking
75 g/day total protein would require 2250 mg Tyr daily. All
Phe-free L-amino acid supplements contain Tyr. The
amounts of Tyr in 60 g/day protein equivalent from
Phe-free L-amino acid supplements varies between 5
and 7 g/daily and is well in excess of daily requirements.
Thereby, this would suggest that any additional Tyr to
what is already provided by the L-amino acid supplements
is unnecessary. However, in PKU due to aberrant Phe/Tyr
metabolism, it may be inappropriate to compare free Tyr
requirements to either the FAO/WHO/UNU 2007 aro-
matic amino acid or protein requirements.
Furthermore, the MPKUCS study found no relation-
ship between infant outcomes and maternal blood Tyr
concentrations before and during pregnancy [319]. An
optimal range for plasma Tyr concentration in maternal
PKU has not been established. It is important that exces-
sive Tyr supplementation should be avoided as the safety
of Tyr supplementation during pregnancy has not been
extensively studied.
Emergency diet during unplanned pregnancies Even
in women with an unplanned pregnancy and high blood
Phe concentrations it is essential to reduce Phe intake,
although this should not be accompanied with weight loss
so avoiding catabolism. Women who become pregnant
without appropriate blood Phe control will need signifi-
cant support to attain Phe levels within the recommended
target range in a timely fashion (Dietary education pro-
grammes for maternal PKU section). Women should be
given emergency supplies of Phe-free L-amino acid sup-
plements and low protein foods until their own supply
can be established through the health or insurance sys-
tems. Baseline blood Phe concentrations, anthropometry,
nutritional biochemistry should be established. The teach-
ing of home blood Phe sampling is necessary.
As a starting point, the initial Phe allocation should be
the same as the Phe tolerance when aged between 1 and
5 years of age and will depend on the severity of PKU.
In the absence of this information, a guideline for women’s
predicted Phe tolerance at the start of pregnancy is sug-
gested by Maillot et al., (Table 13) and Phe intake should
then be adjusted according to blood Phe levels [333].
Data show that uncontrolled maternal blood Phe levels
(over 600 μmol/l) over 10 weeks of pregnancy result in a
high risk of a child developing severe clinical disabilities

 (Tables 7, 8). Although the risks of CHD are within the
first 8 weeks of pregnancy, the risk of impaired foetal de-
velopment in general and especially to the brain is on-
going throughout pregnancy. Therefore, in such cases,
non-directive counselling should be given, with the clin-
ician informing about the high risk (15%) of birth defects
(minor or severe). A foetal heart ultrasound is recom-
mended at 18–22 weeks gestation.
Nausea and vomiting/hyperemesis Nausea and vomit-
ing affects up to 85% of all pregnancies [375]. This may
affect the dietary intake and weight gain so should be ag-
gressively treated. In PKU this can lead to elevated blood
Phe levels. Symptoms generally begin around week 5 of
gestation and typically stop by week 12. Up to 15% of
pregnant women experience persistent symptoms until
delivery. Hyperemesis gravidarum (affecting between
0.5–2% of women) represents the extreme end of the
spectrum associated with dehydration and weight loss
greater than 5% of pre-pregnancy weight. Besides naso-
gastric tubes, gastrostomy tubes have been used in
‘healthy’ pregnant women with hyperemesis gravidarum
but are associated with infections and surgical risks
[376]. Gastrostomy tube placement is also an option that
has been used to deliver Phe-free L-amino acid supple-
ments to women who are unable to restart diet due to
severe nausea or palatability issues [377].
The treatment should be tailored to the individual but
should include similar but adapted advice to non-PKU
pregnancy. Useful additional advice in maternal PKU
can be found in Table 14.
Folic acid supplementation Little attention has been
paid to folic acid intake in maternal PKU. Folic acid is of
critical importance both pre- and peri-conceptionally in
protecting against neural tube defects in the developing
foetus (first 28 days of pregnancy). There is now conclu-
sive evidence from a number of randomized controlled
trials that folic acid supplementation can prevent neural
tube defects [378–380]. Folic acid requirements increase
during pregnancy and many countries give an additional
400 μg/day pre-conceptually and during the first 12 weeks
of pregnancy (Table 15). The upper tolerable limit of folic
acid in the healthy women recommended in Europe [381]
and USA [382] is 1 mg per day. However ‘Diabetes UK’
(www.diabetes.org.uk) recommends 5 mg/day of folic acid
in diabetes to prevent neural tube defects due to higher
risk.
Whilst Phe-free L-amino acid supplements contain
folic acid, the amount is variable and adherence with

Table 14 Advice to help nausea and vomiting in maternal PKU
Dietary and lifestyle
approaches
Small frequent low protein meals and snacks that are high in carbohydrate (e.g. low protein toast, crackers) and low in fat to
avoid an empty stomach, feelings of hunger, and abdominal distension [375]. Cold meals may be better if nausea is associated
with food smells. For women who have difficulty in eating solid foods, additional drinks of cold water supplemented with
glucose polymer may be tolerated if sipped throughout the day. Women should avoid lying down immediately after meals.
Phe-free L-amino acid
supplements
Give Phe-free L-amino acid supplements chilled and encourage up to 5 or 6 times during the day in small doses. The high
osmolality of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements may aggravate nauseas [347] and so may be better tolerated if given with
extra fluid. If the smell of liquid or powdered Phe-free L-amino acid supplements is not tolerated, Phe-free
L-amino acid tablets are worth consideration.
Any doses of Phe-free L-amino acid supplements lost through vomiting should be re-given. In extreme cases of vomiting
and Phe-free L-amino acid supplements intolerance, hospital admission and administration of Phe-free L-amino acid
supplement via a nasogastric tube could be considered.
Medication
Safe antiemetic therapy and acid reducing medications should be considered with persistent vomiting and symptoms of
dyspepsia and indigestion.
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 36 of 56
 Phe-free L-amino acid supplements may be poor, result-
ing in sub-optimal intake. Giving an additional 400 μg/
day of folic acid in the early weeks of pregnancy should
apply in PKU as in healthy women. Vitamin B12 (includ-
ing functional marker plasma homocysteine and/or
methylmalonic acid) should be monitored to ensure that
high intake of folic acid does not mask vitamin B12 defi-
ciency [383].
EPA and DHA Sub-optimal concentrations of EPA and
DHA have been reported in maternal PKU [384] and
traditional dietary treatment is low in α-linolenic acid,
arachidonic acid and without sources of EPA and DHA
[268]. DHA (n-3) and arachidonic acid (n-6) are essen-
tial for foetal growth [385]. In healthy women, an in-
creased supply of n-3 LC-PUFA during pregnancy
reduces the risk of preterm birth before 34 weeks of ges-
tation. Pregnant women should achieve an additional
supply ≥200 mg DHA/day, over and above the intake
recommended for adult general health usually achieving
a total intake ≥300 mg DHA/day [386], and this should
be given to all women considering pregnancy and during
pregnancy in PKU. Many (but not all) Phe-free L-amino
acid supplements contain supplemented DHA, and usu-
ally would supply 120–150 mg of DHA for each 20 g
protein equivalent. Assessment of fatty acid status could
be considered pre-conceptionally or early in pregnancy
and supplementation can be given if biochemical defi-
ciency is demonstrated.
Nutrient monitoring It is essential that key nutrients are
monitored pre-conception and at the start of pregnancy,
with further monitoring recommended only if there are
concerns about dietary adherence or biochemical/clinical
deficiency has been noted earlier in the pregnancy. On a
non-supplemented low Phe diet, intake of vitamin B12
and a decreased intake of vitamin B12 may contribute to
an increased risk of congenital heart disease [359]. If
vitamin B12 status is low at the start of dietary treat-
ment it should be corrected with oral or intramuscular
vitamin B12. Low selenium concentrations throughout
pregnancy have also been noted in women with mater-
nal PKU [186], without selenium supplements added to
their Phe-free L-amino acid supplements. The MPKUCS
revisited 28 pregnancies born with CHD. They had signifi-
cantly higher blood Phe, lower proline, valine, methionine,
isoleucine, leucine, lysine, arginine and lower red blood
cell folate [360].
It is important to note that interpreting micronutrient
blood markers is challenging during pregnancy due to
the maternal, placental and fetal adaptations, which vary
between individuals and are dependent on gestational
age. These issues lead to reduced sensitivity and specifi-
city of biomarkers particularly during late pregnancy
and target blood ranges used for non-pregnancy may be
inappropriate during pregnancy [387].
Breast-feeding and lactation Unaffected infants of ma-
ternal PKU women are able to metabolize the Phe con-
tained in their mothers breast milk without difficulty
[102, 388] and women with PKU should be encouraged
to breast-feed their infants. The only contraindication is
if the mother is treated with BH4 [389] because the
product characteristics state that it is unknown if the
drug or its metabolites are excreted in human breast
milk. However, we encourage breastfeeding and do not
consider there are contraindications for breastfeeding in
(maternal) PKU, even with BH4.

 There is some suggestion that the Phe content of breast
milk is higher than milk from healthy mothers. The Phe
content of maternal breast milk is highest immediately
post birth (up to 238 mg/100 ml) but decreases to 90 to
130 mg/100 ml [390]. Bradburn et al. reported the Phe
content of breast milk was 86 mg/100 ml at day 6 post-
partum and 74 mg/100 ml at day 13 post-partum [388].
There is no published data about breast-feeding in-
fants with PKU if mothers also have PKU. However,
practical experience would suggest that breast-feeding is
possible providing the same management principles as
for all infants with PKU (i.e. a Phe-free formula is given
pre-breast feeds) [391] are adopted.
Lactation is an exceptionally demanding nutritional
state for the mother. Factors relating to sub-optimal ma-
ternal nutrition status during lactation include maternal
age, quality of dietary treatment, lifestyle factors, and
spacing of consecutive births [392]. Energy requirements
of milk production are high with energy requirements
considered to increase by 505 kcal/day to 675 kcal/day
in the first 6 months of breast-feeding [393]. It is as-
sumed that part of extra energy requirement will be met
by fat stores that are laid down during pregnancy. An
additional 15 g/day (approximate amount) protein to
pre- pregnancy requirements should be provided [394].
There are no reports detailing Phe intake during lacta-
tion, probably because many women discontinue strict
diet after pregnancy [395]. Blood Phe concentrations are
likely to rise significantly associated with post-partum
catabolism unless dietary energy intake and a low Phe
intake is maintained. Phe requirements are likely to re-
main similar to pre-pregnancy requirements. It is im-
portant women are encouraged to return to a healthy
weight post pregnancy. All women should receive regu-
lar nutritional support post pregnancy, and women who
have discontinued dietary treatment may be particularly
vulnerable to the effects of poor food choices.
Dietary education programmes for maternal PKU
The low Phe diet is challenging for women with PKU
during pregnancy and women need much support and
education about maternal PKU treatment. Many women
have followed a normal diet for years and may never
have managed their own dietary treatment. In PKU, poor
EF, e.g. sub-optimal planning and organizational skills,
poor attention [70], and short-term memory [93], may
affect the ability to self-manage a low Phe diet because
of the day to day organization, technical skills and plan-
ning required [396]. Obtaining Phe-free L-amino acid
supplements and low protein foods may be difficult.
Poor dietary adherence was associated with the following
maternal factors: younger women (25 and under), those
with less formal education, (high school or less), and
women using social assistance [397].
Women with a lower IQ require intensive practical help
with dietary application. A‘Resource Mother’ or diet support
worker, providing practical assistance to women with PKU,
has been proven to be very helpful by providing social sup-
port, enhancing positive attitudes toward the treatment and
ensuring that necessary resources were in place [335]. This
care is provided in patients own home. In a USA study, the
Maternal
PKU
Resource
Mothers
Program
matched
mothers of children with PKU (Resource Mother) to women
with PKU who were planning a pregnancy or who were
already pregnant, with the aim of providing social support,
enhancing positive attitudes toward the treatment and en-
suring that necessary resources were in place. Women who
received the services of a ‘Resource Mother’ attained meta-
bolic control on average, 2 weeks sooner than women who
did not participate [335]. Waisbren et al. [398] also found
that strong social practical and emotional support from fam-
ily and medical providers greatly increased the chance that a
woman would start treatment before pregnancy.
Alternatively, some patients are admitted to the hospital
for a 3–5 day intensive education. As well as receiving
dietary and cooking advice, they are taught how to do
their own blood Phe measurements [333].
Late diagnosed and untreated PKU
Several definitions are used to describe untreated, late
diagnosed or late treated children and adults with PKU.
In this section the terms late diagnosed and untreated
PKU are used. Late diagnosed refers to children diag-
nosed between the ages of 3 months to 7 years
(≥3 months - <7 years). Untreated PKU refers to pa-
tients untreated by 7 years of age and over. It is ac-
knowledged that these definitions are arbitrary but
improvement in IQ is rarely observed if treatment is
started after the age of 7 years [399, 400].
There are many late diagnosed and untreated patients
with PKU due to a lack of NBS, NBS failures and/or
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 38 of 56
 immigration of patients from countries without NBS or
treatment [74, 401–404]. Some cases may not be diag-
nosed until adulthood, presenting with neurological com-
plications (without severe neurocognitive impairment)
possibly related to PKU [405, 406].
Untreated patients with severe intellectual disability and
challenging behavioural problems have high support needs
[407], and some may live in social welfare homes [408,
409]. An increase in life expectancy suggests the import-
ance of their identification and the provision of long-term
care planning [410]. Intervention with a low Phe diet may
be beneficial [407]. Their overall rehabilitation program
should not be different from individuals with other causes
of intellectual disability.
Late diagnosed PKU
Late diagnosed PKU patients may significantly benefit
from the introduction of a low Phe diet, which may
improve intellectual performance [74, 411, 412]. Out-
come is mainly influenced by age and developmental
quotient/IQ at the start of treatment [399, 400]. Re-
versibility of IQ loss may occur especially in the first
4–6 years of life [74, 399, 400], although this has also
been reported in an 8 year old child [413].
Untreated PKU
Untreated PKU patients even with severe intellectual dis-
abilities may benefit from the introduction of a low Phe diet.
Several case reports and cohorts describe changes in symp-
toms in untreated adults after commencement of dietary
treatment [71, 399, 401, 413–426], although benefit is not
seen in all patients [71, 414, 415, 418, 422, 424, 426, 427].
Mainly improvement of motor function (tremors/spasticity)
and behaviour (less restless and irritable, more alert/respon-
sive and less aggressive with decreased numbers and sever-
ity of self-injury behaviours) are described (Table 16). Giffin
et al. [428] reported improvement in visual attention span
in 2 out of 3 patients. Schuett et al. [429] recounted positive
and negative results after diet commencement in 42 mildly
and severely intellectually impaired patients concerning
outcomes such as mood, hyperactivity, body weight and
nausea/vomiting.
Brown et al. [430] determined that a low Phe diet in
adults with previously untreated PKU resulted in economic
benefit to the health service and society in general. Reduc-
tion in nursing time, hospitalizations, outpatient clinic visits
and medications reduced mean annual costs [430].
Dietary treatment and monitoring
Before diet initiation, it is essential to consider the indi-
vidual patient and their quality of life especially if they
have severe intellectual disability and/or behavioural
problems [74]. A low-Phe diet for previously untreated
adults should be supervised by a team experienced in
the treatment of PKU. Care providers, family members
and/or residential house staff members require instruc-
tion about the practicalities of dietary treatment. Poten-
tial management barriers should be identified. Care
providers and families may consider that the diet is too
restricted and so inappropriate [417]. Clear information
should be given about the potential benefits of dietary
treatment. A practical plan for stepwise introduction of
a low Phe diet is published by Dolan et al. [417], and
Hoskin [431]. Dietary management needs careful nutri-
tional monitoring to optimize Phe, total protein energy
and micronutrient intakes. Adjustment of Phe-free L-
amino acid supplements may be necessary [127]. When
treatment does improve patient behaviour and social
interaction, adjustment of social and therapeutic pro-
grams is essential. Potential expected outcome changes
are identified in Table 16.
Although not fully understood, in some patients post
diet initiation, there may be deterioration of symptoms
with increased frequency of aggressive behaviour and re-
currence of seizures [426]. It may be necessary to con-
sider discontinuation of dietary management. It is not
possible to predict which patients will respond to a low
Phe diet and the first clinical or behaviour changes may
not occur for weeks or even months. However, diet dis-
continuation should be considered only if there is no
clinical or behavioural improvement after 6 months,
providing blood Phe levels have consistently been main-
tained within target range. Videotaping can help to rec-
ord changes in behaviour.
Phe monitoring is recommended weekly at treatment
commencement but should follow standard recommenda-
tions for monitoring once blood Phe levels have stabilised
within target range. Target Phe levels and nutritional

 follow-up recommendations are discussed in the chapter
treatment goals and follow up. Although it is not clear what
the optimal target blood level should be in untreated adult
patients, we recommend <600 μmol/l. Dolan et al. [417]
and Koch et al. [399] reported upper target Phe levels of
600 μmol/l [417] and 720 μmol/l [399] respectively.
Other therapies
There are limited reports on the use of additional ther-
apies in later or undiagnosed PKU. Kalkanoglu et al.
[432] demonstrated in a double-blind cross-over study
improved
concentration,
awareness
and
less
self-
injurious behaviour in 14 of 19 untreated adults by
LNAA supplementation. Vernon et al. [433] reported
one BH4-responsive untreated adult with PKU with a
baseline plasma Phe of 1255 μmol/l. On BH4 treatment
he showed significant behavioural improvements, result-
ing in fewer behavioural problems and increased social
interactions. Treatment with BH4 should be considered
for any responsive patient independent of their mental
capacity. BH4-treatment is discussed in the chapter
pharmacological treatment and emerging therapies.
Adherence
Poor treatment adherence is common in any chronic dis-
ease. Counselling and education is often recommended to
improve adherence. Research indicates that whilst know-
ledge is necessary for adherence, it is not a strong pre-
dictor of adherence [198, 434]. Short-term gain in
knowledge can be achieved by intervention programs such
as summer camp, but adherence and metabolic control do
not improve after interventions [435–437]. Changes in at-
titude and motivation may be more effective [438].
Whereas traditionally the metabolic team prescribed
and monitored treatment in PKU, this is now commonly
done in partnership with the caregivers and patients. It
is recognised that it is valuable to provide person-
centred care, providing advice and support that is fo-
cussed on the individual rather than being judgmental
about poor adherence [10]. This is particularly important
with adolescents and adult patients. Adult patients often
prefer management that interferes with normal life as lit-
tle as possible. They are expected to take responsibility
for their own health with the metabolic team providing
the right information, tools and motivational encourage-
ment [10]. Unfortunately, some adult patients no longer
attend hospital appointments for follow-up care, and
one of the most difficult challenges is re-engagement of
this patient group. They may have poor understanding
of their condition, its potential consequences and retain
unpleasant memories of dietary treatment. Reaching out
to this cohort necessitates collaborative efforts of PKU
clinics and national patient advocacy organizations, pos-
sibly using social media, to help nurture them to return
to clinical follow-up [439].
In children under 12 years of age, although uncom-
mon, there are cases in which parents or caregivers re-
fuse to engage with healthcare professionals. Common
signs of poor adherence in early childhood include:
persistently poor Phe control, failure to engage with
health professionals (e.g. non-attendance at clinic ap-

 Pharmacological treatment and emerging therapies
BH4 treatment
BH4, also known as sapropterin dihydrochloride (the ac-
tive compound in the commercial drug) is used to treat a
subset of PKU patients with PKU [193, 311, 433, 442–
453]. Patients with high residual activity of the PAH en-
zyme have a greater probability of BH4 response, but a
minority of patients with classical PKU also may benefit
from BH4 treatment [193, 194, 442, 443, 445, 449, 453].
Recently, efficacy and safety of BH4 has been demon-
strated in children <4 years of age which has led to Euro-
pean approval for BH4 in this age category [454–457].
BH4 is still unavailable in some European countries.
Two systematic reviews have summarised the efficacy
and safety of BH4. Somaraju et al. [458] reviewed 2 rando-
mised controlled trials that were led respectively by Levy
et al. [447] and Trefz et al. ([459], whereas Lindegren et al.
[448] included the following additional studies/reports:
one uncontrolled open-label study, one prospective cohort
study, and several case series. Both systematic reviews
concluded there is short-term evidence to demonstrate
that BH4 is effective in reducing blood Phe concentrations
and increasing Phe tolerance in BH4-responsive PKU pa-
tients. Also no serious adverse events were reported. Sev-
eral uncontrolled open-label studies and case series
support a significant reduction of blood Phe levels [193,
194, 311, 433, 442, 444–451, 453–455, 458–464] and in-
creased Phe tolerance [193, 194, 311, 433, 443–446, 448–
452, 454, 455, 458, 459, 463–465]. These benefits have
also been replicated in longer-term (investigated up to
5 years) studies [193, 194, 443, 445, 446, 451, 454, 455,
463, 465]. Furthermore, less variability in blood Phe con-
trol has been described in 3 descriptive papers [311, 454,
460]. Current data suggests that with BH4 treatment cog-
nition and behaviour issues may improve but, possibly,
more importantly they do not deteriorate [155, 183, 466].
The same applies for quality of life [58, 165]. At present,
studies have not reported long-term neurocognitive out-
come, behaviour and quality of life with BH4 treatment.
The cost-effectiveness of BH4 is not established, espe-
cially when dietary treatment and Phe-free L-amino acid
supplements are still required.
BH4-responsiveness should be determined on an indi-
vidual case basis. The degree of responsiveness will be
characterised by the extent of improvement in biochem-
ical control and increase in natural protein intake. We de-
fine BH4-responsiveness as ‘establishing an increase in
natural protein tolerance of ≥100% with blood Phe concen-
trations remaining consistently within the target range’.
BH4-responsiveness can also be defined by improved
metabolic control ‘>75% of blood Phe levels remaining
within target range without any decrease in natural pro-
tein intake associated with BH4 treatment’. BH4 should
only be prescribed in cases of proven BH4-responsiveness
which is established by a treatment trial (chapter 11.2).
BH4 should be withdrawn if blood Phe levels consistently
exceed the upper target range and there is no improve-
ment associated with any increase in BH4 dosage. If nutri-
tional status deteriorates e.g. obesity or development of
nutritional deficiencies, discontinuation of BH4 treatment
should be considered.
BH4 and pregnancy Since drug studies in pregnancy
are not feasible, experience is based on a small number
of case reports and 2 small cohort studies. Therefore, no
prospective data is available regarding the indication,
dose and management of BH4 during pregnancy. In a
European cohort study, 3 patients received BH4 pre-
conception, and 5 patients commenced treatment during
pregnancy [467]. In a USA cohort study, 15 patients
were administered BH4 prior to pregnancy, and only 1
patient received BH4 post-conception [468, 469]. Over-
all, the dosage varied between 4 and 20 mg per kg of
body weight. The Kuvan® Adult Maternal Paediatric
European Registry reported 4 pregnancies, with varying
BH4 doses between 3 and 17 mg per kg of body weight.
No foetal development problems or adverse events re-
lated to the pregnancies were observed [465].
Case descriptions show that BH4 assists in lowering
blood Phe levels to within target range. All the infants
exposed to BH4 during pregnancy had favourable out-
comes, except in 1 case when the mother had very high
Phe levels in early pregnancy and was given BH4 as a
rescue treatment. BH4 treatment can be given during
pregnancy, but only if women are known to be BH4-
responders and dietary treatment alone is unsuccessful
in achieving target blood Phe control. Potential respon-
siveness can be assessed by genotyping and/or a BH4
loading test [35].
BH4 and untreated adults This is discussed in the
chapter on untreated adults.

 BH4 loading test and treatment trial
Before treating patients with BH4, assessment of BH4-
responsiveness
is
essential.
Determination
of
BH4-
responsiveness can be done by genotype and/or BH4
loading tests. As already reported in chapter 4.3, the
genotype may predict or exclude to some degree BH4-
responsiveness [32–34]. Every patient except if there are
2 null-variants justifies a BH4 loading test. If 2 BH4-
responsive variants are identified, a treatment trial with-
out a BH4 loading test can be commenced.
The short-term loading test take up to 48 h in Europe
and 28 days in USA, whereas the treatment trial in po-
tential BH4-responders (after a positive short-term test
or genotype in line with known BH4-responsiveness)
may occur over a few weeks or even months [470].
Bernegger et al. [471] described a 24 h BH4 loading
testing using 20 mg/kg to differentiate between BH4-
responders and non-responders. Extension to 48 h
and repeated BH4 administration seems to be useful
to detect slow responders and responsiveness in more
severe phenotypes [472]. The utility of a 48 h test has
been confirmed in a study of 177 patients treated
with 20 mg BH4/kg/day [35].
At present, the exact procedure of the BH4 loading
test differs among countries, also depending on labora-
tory availability. Blau et al. [470] and Singh et al. [450]
published protocols for BH4 loading tests. The 24 h test
in newborns can detect BH4-deficiencies in addition to
BH4-responsiveness in PAH patients [473]. The arbitrary
responsiveness definition of a > 30% reduction in blood
Phe appears to be a good compromise between sensitiv-
ity and specificity for the initial screening test. Individual
patient characteristics should be considered when inter-
preting results, especially in patients with low baseline
Phe levels [474].
Every positive BH4 loading test and gene variants ana-
lysis refers to a potential BH4-responsiveness. Long-
term response should be proven in a treatment trial
adjusting the BH4 dosing, natural protein intake and
Phe-free L-amino acid supplements. The starting dose in
a treatment trial is 10–20 mg per kg of body weight and
can be adapted during the trial. This process may re-
quire several weeks to months. There is a lack of studies
that have addressed the long-term treatment BH4 dose,
the natural protein tolerance and supplementation with
Phe-free L-amino acids. When adapting diet with BH4,
Singh et al. [450] advised to increase the natural protein
first, followed by reduction in Phe-free L-amino acid
supplementation. An additional step should include a re-
duction in the BH4 dose. It is important to maintain
blood Phe concentrations in the target range with BH4
treatment and diet relaxation. It is also important to
anticipate that patients may not always make the
healthiest
food
choices
when
given
some
dietary
freedom. Increasing the natural protein (from non-animal
food sources) and decreasing the Phe-free L-amino acid
supplementation may even result in nutritional defi-
ciencies [75, 452].
Emerging therapies
Effectiveness of PKU treatment is demonstrated by any of
the following objective measures: reduction in Phe blood
concentrations, increase in natural protein tolerance, im-
provement in neuropsychological testing, improved nutri-
tional staus and better quality of life. Special considerations
should be made for patients at different ages and special sit-
uations such as pregnancy or breast-feeding.
A possible enzyme replacement therapy using PEG-
Phenylalanine-Ammonia Lyase (PAL) or Pegvaliase is
under investigation. PEG-PAL clinical phase II trials
have proven short-term reduction in the Phe blood con-
centrations in adult PKU patients, but further studies
are required to observe long-term effectiveness and
safety [475]. Results of a phase III extension study
(NCT01819727) are awaited. Gene therapy and thera-
peutic liver repopulation are being investigated in mur-
ine models only [476, 477], and larger animal PKU
models and human studies are being developed.
Patients’ view
There are several papers discussing patients’ and parents’
coping strategies and barriers to effective management.
Awizus et al. [478] interviewed 11 parents of children aged
8 years with PKU. Parents were shocked by the diagnosis,
had emotional and adjustment problems and were com-
monly in conflict between the task of attaining acceptable
blood Phe levels and the guilt they experienced when they
deviated from the dietary rules to meet their children’s de-
mands. In another study parents described their children
with PKU as feeling different from peers [479] whereas pa-
tients described themselves as ‘healthy’ or ‘normal’ [480,
481]. Di Commo et al. [480] concluded from 20 patients
van Wegberg et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases  (2017) 12:162 
Page 42 of 56
 with PKU, that they consider PKU more as a potential risk
rather than an actual disease and that adherence seems
connected with highly internalized behaviour rather than
with perception of adverse effects. Some PKU patients
avoid social occasions where food is shared because of fear
of stigmatization. Patients (n = 47) experience a paradox,
either they feel normal but isolated from the social context,
or are different while participating in the convivial aspects
of the social settings [481].
Primary obstacles to successful management of PKU
identified by parents of 32 PKU children were time con-
straints, stress associated with food preparation, record
keeping, and social life restrictions imposed by PKU. About
two-thirds agreed that a home-monitoring blood device
was desirable to ease the burden of management [482].
Bernstein et al. [483] studied the effectiveness of educa-
tional tools perceived by clinicians, parents and patients.
They found a discrepancy between patient and clinician
views regarding the effectiveness of nutrition education. Pa-
tients concluded that their families were the most effective
educators whilst parents responded they felt one-on-one
counselling was the most effective educational tool [483].
Hagedorn et al. [11] reported the minimum standard
of care requested by patients/caregivers and the chief re-
quirements were: uniform treatment/management goals;
care by a multidisciplinary team (physician, dietician/
nutritionist and psychologist); and access to care, BH4,
and special dietary products [11].
In order to represent the interest of patients, national
patient organizations are recommended.
Implementation/impact of guidelines
Distributing the European PKU guidelines may increase
awareness of their presence, but in itself will generally not
lead to behaviour change [484]. Interactive educational in-
terventions and reminders (when used sparingly) to health
care providers are considered to be effective [484]. Poten-
tial barriers to behaviour change are lack of motivation,
inadequate facilities and resources. The impact of these
guidelines on daily care will differ among countries.
Change of target blood Phe levels and the recommenda-
tion to follow up and treat patients for life may have im-
pact on the intensity of care. The same applies to other
recommendations such as the follow up of bone mineral
density, nutritional status, neurocognition and frequency
of Phe measurement and outpatient clinic visits.
Some recommendations can have impact on the health
care budget. For example, in some centres there may be
a need for additional staff in their paediatric healthcare
team and/or for transition to adulthood. Reimbursement
for BH4 treatment is not established in all countries.
The aim is to have the entire guideline updated in
5 years. The actual impact of the guidelines on change
in healthcare will be evaluated by questionnaires.
Future requirements and research
It is evident that many of these guideline statements have
not yet been introduced into clinical practice by several
European centres and it is also clear that various barriers,
including financial hurdles, may impede the speed of
change. Unmet needs include identification and training
of sufficient numbers of physicians with a broad interest
in co-ordinating care for adult patients with IMD includ-
ing PKU. We need to optimize PKU treatment both in
adult and elderly care. The development of a device able
to accurately measure and generate immediate blood Phe
results for home monitoring (instead of home sampling) is
likely to change management practices. It will decrease
metabolic laboratory time, and will dramatically reduce
the time between blood sampling and obtaining a blood
Phe result, and so assist and motivate patients to achieve
target blood Phe target ranges more easily. The establish-
ment of the expert reference network (ERN) may lead to
patient treatment being directed by European designated
expert centres with ‘local’ care provided by experienced
treatment teams and may facilitate the use of international
databases by which studies on larger populations can
be performed. There is an ongoing need for meta-
analysis relating outcome to metabolic control during
childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, while the need
for more sophisticated statistics in such studies is
underestimated.
Future research in PKU may target the pathophysi-
ology of brain dysfunction aiming to improve treatment
strategies. These strategies may not only target the blood
Phe concentrations, but also directly alter cerebral metab-
olism. They will aim to improve neuropsychological out-
come and functioning as well as provide a better quality of
life by decreasing the need for arduous dietary Phe re-
striction. Such treatments may include new drugs such
as enzyme replacement therapy using PEG-Phenylalanine-
Ammonia Lyase (PAL) but other non-nutritional treat-
ment options including gene therapy and therapeutic liver
repopulation have not progressed beyond animal models.
Future research is necessary to identify the number of
adults who experience clinical symptoms together with bet-
ter characterisation and impact of sign and symptoms. More
data is needed about the influence of metabolic control dur-
ing adolescence and adulthood, particularly when childhood
metabolic control is optimal. In addition, new strategies
should be actively sought to re-engage adult patients who
are no longer in active hospital follow up but who are at risk
of mental health and executive function deficits.
Other future research topics include strategies to
improve adherence particularly in adolescents and
adulthood, efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy, ef-
fectiveness of GMP and LNAA, usefulness of bio-
chemical markers such as Phe variability, the Phe: Tyr
ratio as well as the ratio of Phe to other LNAA, new

 (long-term) biomarkers, defining the optimal lower
target Phe levels, bioavailability of micronutrients in
Phe-free L-amino acid supplements and the function-
ality and long-term side effects of Phe-free L-amino
acid supplements in PKU.
Conclusion
These first European guidelines are the result of a 3 year
process based on the AGREE and SIGN methodology
as PKU management differs accros Europe. The level of
evidence of most recommendations is C or D. Although
study designs and patient numbers are sub-optimal,
many statements are convincing, important and rele-
vant, and may set the benchmark for improving out-
come in PKU patients. Key recommendations which
should be prioritised for implementations mainly relate
to treatment initiation, target Phe levels for treatment,
and follow-up. Minimum requirements regarding man-
agement and follow-up of PKU patients are formulated.
Knowledge gaps are identified that require further re-
search in order to direct better future care. Future re-
search should focus on the pathophysiology of brain
dysfunction aiming to improve treatment strategies and
the impact of metabolic control during adolescence and
adulthood. These guidelines are aimed to standardize
care and do determine a course of action, but are not
mandatory. The authors of these guidelines are willing
to update these guidelines based on the highest quality
evidence available.

Protein requirements
The lowest level of dietary protein
intake that will balance the losses
of nitrogen from the body, and

Protein substitutes (phenylalanine-
free L-amino acid supplements
and low phenylalanine glycoma-
cropeptide protein)
Protein replacement/substitutes are
essential to prevent protein
deficiency and optimize metabolic
control. Protein substitutes are
mainly sourced from phenylalanine-
free L-amino acids supplements
and less commonly from low
phenylalanine glycomacropeptide.
Potential tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH4) responsiveness
>30% reduction in blood
phenylalanine in a BH4 loading test
or 2 BH4 responsive variants. Long-
term BH4-responsiveness should be
proven in a treatment trial adjusting
the BH4 dosing, natural protein in-
take and phenylalanine-free L-
amino acid supplement.
Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)
Cofactor of the phenylalanine
hydroxylase. BH4 also acts as a
chaperone molecule in
phenylalanine hydroxylase-deficient
patients harbouring specific gene
variants. BH4 is also a cofactor of
tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxy-
lases and plays an important role in
the conversion of L-arginine to ni-
tric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide
synthases (NOS).
Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)
deficiencies
Defects in BH4 metabolism (either
synthesis or regeneration) result in
a deficiency of BH4. These include 3
known defects for synthesis and 2
for regeneration.
Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)
responsiveness
In this report it is defined as an
increase of ≥100% in natural
protein and/or improved
biochemical control (>75% of
phenylalanine levels in target
range) on a dose of BH4 that
ranges between 1 and 20 mg perkg
of body weight (with a maximum
dose of 1000 or 1400 mg/day in
some cntries).
