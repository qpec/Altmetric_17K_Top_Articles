Chordoma is a malignant, often incurable bone tumour showing notochordal differentiation.
Here, we defined the somatic driver landscape of 104 cases of sporadic chordoma. We reveal
somatic duplications of the notochordal transcription factor brachyury (T) in up to 27% of
cases. These variants recapitulate the rearrangement architecture of the pathogenic germline
duplications of T that underlie familial chordoma. In addition, we find potentially clinically
actionable PI3K signalling mutations in 16% of cases. Intriguingly, one of the most frequently
altered genes, mutated exclusively by inactivating mutation, was LYST (10%), which may
represent a novel cancer gene in chordoma.

hordoma is a rare, aggressive bone cancer showing noto-
chordal differentiation that mainly affects adults and
occasionally children, with a marked predilection for the
axial skeleton1. The principal treatment of chordoma is radical
surgical resection, augmented by adjuvant radiotherapy2. Chor-
doma does not respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy3. Most
patients cannot be cured3. They often suffer from the debilitating
consequences of tumour progression and its surgical treatment
before dying from their disease3.
The genetic basis of sporadic chordoma has been investigated
using copy-number arrays and targeted sequencing limited to
candidate genes4–6. Collectively, these studies have identified
recurrent loss of CDKN2A as a key driver in chordoma devel-
opment. In addition, occasional alterations of PI3K signalling
genes have been reported and evaluated in expression studies and
in vitro7–9.
Rare familial cases of chordoma are attributable to focal
germline tandem duplication of the T gene, which encodes the
transcription factor of notochordal development, brachyury10.
Brachyury expression is the diagnostic hallmark of chordoma1
and has been proposed to prevent the notochord from progres-
sing into senescence11. Utilising array CGH, quantitative PCR
and FISH, somatic amplification of T in sporadic chordoma has
been demonstrated, predominantly in the context of whole-
chromosome gains, rather than focal amplification11. However,
other studies have not identified recurrent somatic copy-number
gains of T in chordoma4. Furthermore, in sporadic tumours
certain
germline
SNPs
of
T
have
been
associated
with
chordoma7, 12, 13.
Here, we present DNA sequences of 104 cases of sporadic
chordoma, divided into a discovery (n = 37) and a validation
cohort (n = 67). The discovery cohort, comprising paired tumour
and
normal-tissue
DNA,
was
subjected
to
whole-genome
sequencing (n = 11) or whole-exome (n = 26) sequencing. The
validation cohort, 15 paired and 52 unpaired cases, was studied by
targeted sequencing of 360 cancer genes (Supplementary Data 1).
Transcriptome sequencing was performed in nine of the whole-
genome cases (Supplementary Data 2). Copy-number profiles
were generated from SNP6 arrays or directly from sequencing
reads. Somatic mutations were identified and annotated using the
analysis pipeline of the Cancer Genome Project14. In addition, we
also re-analysed whole-genome sequences of four chordoma cell
lines (UM-Chor1, U-CH2, JHC7 and Mug-Chor1) that are
publicly available (www.chordomafoundation.org).

 cohort of genomes and exomes (n = 37), we identified 5 to 76
coding substitutions (median 21) and 0 to 47 indels (median 4)
per case (Supplementary Data 2 and 3). The predominant sub-
stitution signature, as defined by the trinucleotide context of
27,612 substitutions found in 11 chordoma genomes, reflected
two mutational processes. These are universally present across
cancer types and show age-related accumulation15 (Supplemen-
tary Data 2 and 4). Occasional rearrangements and copy-number
changes, including chromothripsis, were observed (Supplemen-
tary Data 5). No recurrent gene fusions were found in whole-
genome or transcriptome sequences. Manual curation of driver
variants defined the landscape of cancer genes operative in
chordoma (Fig. 1a) and chordoma cell lines (Supplementary
Table 1).
Somatic duplications of T. In three of the eleven tumour gen-
omes (27%), we found focal, somatically acquired duplication of
the T gene, 70 to 136 kb in size, akin to those observed in familial
cases (Fig. 2). In each case, the rearrangement mechanism
underlying the gain of T was defined and resolved at base-pair
resolution (Supplementary Table 2). In two cases (PD1141a and
PD13479a), a simple tandem duplication covering at least one full
length T transcript was evident. In the third case (PD13483a), a
complex pattern of rearrangement was present resulting in the

 intact duplication of T. The remarkable focality and low-
amplitude signal of the observed T duplications rendered them
undetectable by copy-number arrays (SNP6). Consequently, we
searched for the presence of additional T duplications in an
extension cohort by designing a targeted sequencing assay, which
included the entire footprint of T and flanking regions. Although
this assay is less sensitive than whole-genome sequencing, we
found additional cases with gains of T in the extension cohort (8/
67, 12%; Supplementary Fig. 1). When confined to the most
informative samples with a high density of heterozygous SNPs, T
gains were seen in 6/28 chordomas of the extension series (21%;
see ‘Methods’). In two of the chordoma cell lines, gains of T were
found (Supplementary Table 3; Supplementary Fig. 2).
Recurrent mutation of PI3K signalling genes. An observation of
potential therapeutic relevance was the presence of driver events
in PI3K signalling genes in our cohort in 17/104 (16%) cases.
These included activating mutations in PIK3CA (n = 9) and
truncating variants in PIK3R1 (n = 1) and PTEN (n = 7). Given
the poor prognosis of chordoma, our findings provide a rationale
for exploring the utility of targeting PI3K signalling in the
treatment of chordoma. Of note in this context, inhibition of
mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a downstream node of
the PI3K signalling cascade, has shown promising activity in
animal models and in some patients16–18.
Driver events in chromatin modelling genes. We identified
driver events in further cancer genes not previously implicated in
chordoma including recurrent mutation of the SWI/SNF complex
sub-unit gene ARID1A (4/104 cases). Drivers in another SWI/
SNF gene, PBRM1 (10/104 cases) and the histone methyl-
transferase, SETD2 (5/104) implicate defective chromatin mod-
elling as a major driver of chordoma. In 18/104 (17%) tumours,
we found at least one driver variant in one of the three genes, with
PBRM1 being one of the most commonly mutated cancer genes
in chordoma. It is interesting to note that the contribution of
SETD2, ARID1A and PBRM1 to chordoma is reminiscent of the
role of these cancer genes in renal cell carcinoma19. Known
somatic changes of chordoma, such as homozygous deletion of
CDKN2A4, were recapitulated in our study.
Recurrent mutation of the LYST gene. We next searched for
novel genes operative in the pathogenesis of chordoma. We found
recurrent truncating mutations in the gene encoding the lysoso-
mal trafficking regulator protein, LYST20. In the discovery cohort,
five tumours (14%) harboured a single LYST mutation each.
These mutations comprised three frameshift indels, one nonsense
substitution and one disruptive intragenic rearrangement (Fig. 1b;
Supplementary Fig. 3).
The apparent enrichment of truncating LYST mutations may
represent a chance observation, or may be a consequence of
positive selection for driver variants. Enrichment by chance
would seem unlikely, as we were able to validate this observation.
In the extension cohort, we found LYST-truncating mutations in
5/67 cases (7%). Here, the frequency of tumours harbouring
truncating LYST mutations was significantly enriched compared
to 4947 non-chordoma tumours (p = 2.7 × 10−6; Fisher’s exact
test; see ‘Methods’). In addition, the pattern of indels observed in
LYST differed significantly from the expected pattern, including
the absence of in-frame indels (p = 0.014; permutation test,
Supplementary Fig. 4). We next considered that truncating LYST
mutations may have accumulated as a consequence of hypermu-
tation of the LYST locus in chordoma. However, comparing the
frequency of LYST substitutions and indels in chordoma with
breast cancers genomes, we found no evidence of increased
mutability of the LYST locus in chordoma (see ‘Methods’). Thus,
neither chance nor hypermutation would explain the enrichment
of truncating mutations in LYST. It would therefore seem likely
that LYST operates as a cancer gene through loss of function
mutations. We did not see evidence of biallelic inactivation via a
second point mutation or genomic deletion (LOH) in any of the
samples bearing a truncating LYST mutation. This would suggest
that LYST is not a classic two-hit tumour suppressor gene.
Clearly, additional genomic studies and functional investigations
are required to clarify the role of LYST in chordoma pathogenesis.
Given the apparent specificity of truncating LYST mutations to
chordoma, they may have utility as an adjunct diagnostic tool.
Discussion
Here, we presented a comprehensive exploration of the somatic
changes that underpin chordoma. Overall, it reveals a relatively
quiet cancer genome driven by a limited repertoire of cancer
genes.
A key finding of our study was a recurrent somatic duplication
of T, organised as highly focal single copy-number gains akin to
germline alterations of T underlying familial chordoma. Whole-
genome sequences, which inform on copy number, variant allele
frequencies of SNPs and breakpoints at base-pair resolution, now
provide clear evidence of focal somatic T gains in chordoma. It
seems possible that the frequency of T duplication has been
previously underestimated due to the limited sensitivity of assays
utilised, and subtle pattern of mutation. Interestingly, T dupli-
cations do not evolve into high-level amplifications. This may
indicate that an exact gene dosage is required for the development
of chordoma.
Our observation of non-random enrichment of truncating
mutations in the LYST gene indicates that it may operate as a
cancer gene in chordoma. Although this proposition requires
further validation, one may speculate on the biological role of
LYST in chordoma development. It may lie in the function of
LYST as a lysosomal regulator gene20. It has been shown that
lysosomes are required for notochordal development21. Interest-
ingly, lysosomes are the histological hallmark of the ‘physali-
phorous’, vacuole-packed cells that characterise chordoma22. The
functional link of LYST to chordoma development may thus lie in
aberrant function of notochordal lysosomes, potentially interfer-
ing with notochord cell differentiation.
In the context of a quiescent and monotonous driver landscape
of chordoma, we were unable to detect a single plausible driver
variant in 47/104 tumours, including four tumours interrogated
by whole-genome, transcriptome and re-sequencing of known
cancer genes at high depth. Genomic studies of larger cohorts
may be required, including a detailed exploration of the epigen-
ome, to complete the picture of the pathology of chordoma.
Methods
Patient samples. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and ethical
approval obtained from Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Service (reference 09/
H0308/165). Patient samples were also obtained from the Stanmore Musculoske-
letal Biobank, a satellite of the UCL/UCLH Biobank (HTA Licence Number
12055), which was approved by the National Research Ethics Committee (reference
15/YH/0311). This specific study was approved by the NREC-approved UCL/
UCLH Biobank Ethical Review Committee (reference EC17.14).
Sequencing. Whole-genome, RNA or exome sequencing was performed using the
Illumina HiSeq 2000 or 2500 platform. RNA libraries were prepared by enriching
for mRNA through poly(A) capture14. Exome sequences were selected for using by
bait capture (Agilent)23. Targeted sequencing was performed by enriching for
genomic areas of interest using a custom-made bait capture set (Agilent). Tumour
DNA and RNA were extracted from fresh-frozen tissue, which had been reviewed
by a pathologist, using standard methods. Normal-tissue DNA was derived from
adjacent normal tissue or blood samples.

 Variant calling. The variant calling pipeline of the Cancer Genome Project,
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, was used to call substitutions (CaVEMan algo-
rithm), indels (Pindel algorithm), structural rearrangements (BRASS algorithm)
and copy-number changes (ASCAT algorithm)14. The validity of variant calling
through this pipeline has previously been established14. Note that we included
rearrangement calls only if they were validated by definition at base-pair resolution.
RNA reads were searched for gene fusion using three different algorithms
(TopHat-Fusion24; STAR-Fusion (github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion/wiki);
deFuse25).
Driver analysis of mutations. We used previously described methods to call
driver events14. In brief, drivers in recessive cancer genes were called if mutations
truncated the gene footprint. In oncogenes, point mutations were considered to be
drivers if they mutated previously curated hotspots. Copy-number gains were
regarded oncogenic when the copy number of oncogenes was increased to 5 or 9
copies in diploid and tetraploid samples, respectively. Copy-number segments with
homozygous deletions or amplifications had to be focal, defined as < 1 Mb in size.
The requirement for focality was relaxed for bonafide recessive cancer genes that
presented with both focal and larger homozygous deletions.
Driver analysis of mutations in cell lines. Publicly available whole-genome
sequencing reads of five chordoma cell lines were downloaded from www.
chordomafoudation.org and processed through our pipeline, as described above. As
no matched normal-tissue sequences were available, calling driver events had to be
confined to canonical driver mutations. This included copy-number variants that
were called manually due to the lack of matched normal-tissue sequences, by
inspection of genes of interest.
Analysis of targeted sequencing data for T gains. We developed a method to
call copy-number changes from targeted sequencing data (github.com/con-
stantAmateur/TargetedCN/) combining sequence coverage data, allele frequencies
of heterozygous SNPs as well as statistically inferred haploblocks. Here, we applied
this method to call copy-number changes in T from targeted sequences of the
whole footprint of T plus adjacent intergenic regions. The performance of the
method was tested in data drawn from two separate experiments: the target
enrichment bait capture set used in this experiment and a second bait set enriching
for different genes in different tumour types (angiosarcoma; breast cancer; chon-
dromyxoid fibroma; osteosarcoma; see Supplementary Data 1). We assessed the
precision of our method, benchmarked against copy-number analyses from whole-
genome sequencing, in determining the copy number of genes interrogated by
targeted sequencing in their entirety. Looking at 76 copy-number calls collected
from 20 tumours and 8 genes, we found that our method precisely determined
copy number in 70/76 calls. Focusing on T copy-number calls in chordoma, our
method identified 2 of 3 duplications. Thus, our method, although specific, is less
sensitive compared with the whole-genome sequencing in calling copy-number
changes in genes, including T, interrogated in their entirety by targeted sequencing.
The sensitivity of our method depends on the presence of heterozygous SNPs.
Accordingly, tumours with no or few heterozygous SNPs in T are not informative.
Thus, depending on which SNP threshold is chosen, the prevalence of T
duplications in chordoma changes as follows: no threshold—8/67 cases harboured
T gains; >20 heterozygous SNPs—6/43 cases harboured T gains; > 40 SNPs 6/28
cases harboured T gains; > 60 SNPs 4/12 cases harboured T gains. On the basis of
these analyses, we chose a threshold of > 40 SNPs to define a tumour cohort of
informative cases.
Extraction of substitution signatures. Substitution signatures were extracted by
using non-negative matrix factorisation, as implemented in a published
algorithm15.
Statistical analyses. The frequency of chordomas harbouring truncating LYST
mutations was assessed as follows: Exome-sequencing reads of non-chordoma
tumours were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and processed by the same
analysis pipeline as used for our chordoma study. In this comparison, only coding
mutations were considered. Other than a SumMS score of 250 or greater for Pindel
calls, no additional post-processing was applied to mutation calls. Overall, 4947
non-chordoma tumours were included in the analysis. Cases that were excluded
had poor quality sequencing data or were hypermutators compared with chordoma
(defined as ≥100 coding substitutions per exome). The frequency of tumours
harbouring a truncating LYST mutation (nonsense, essential splice, start lost,
nonsense, out of frame indel) was significantly increased in chordoma (5/67
tumours) versus non-chordoma tumours (13/4947 tumours), as assessed by the
Fisher’s exact test. To assess the mutability of LYST, we compared the rate of LYST
subs and indels in our chordoma genomes to those from a large sample of primary
breast cancers (n = 229) from a published study14. We tested both subs and indels
independently for evidence of an increased mutation rate in chordoma using a one-
sided Fisher’s exact test followed by multiple hypothesis correction.
