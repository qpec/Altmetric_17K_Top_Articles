Purpose
Patients with cancer are more likely to file for bankruptcy than the general population, but the impact
of severe financial distress on health outcomes among patients with cancer is not known.
Methods
We linked Western Washington SEER Cancer Registry records with federal bankruptcy records for
the region. By using propensity score matching to account for differences in several demographic
and clinical factors between patients who did and did not file for bankruptcy, we then fit Cox
proportional hazards models to examine the relationship between bankruptcy filing and survival.
Results
Between 1995 and 2009, 231,596 persons were diagnosed with cancer. Patients who filed for
bankruptcy (n = 4,728) were more likely to be younger, female, and nonwhite, to have local- or
regional- (v distant-) stage disease at diagnosis, and have received treatment. After propensity score
matching, 3,841 patients remained in each group (bankruptcy v no bankruptcy). In the matched
sample, mean age was 53.0 years, 54% were men, mean income was $49,000, and majorities were
white (86%), married (60%), and urban (91%) and had local- or regional-stage disease at diagnosis
(84%). Both groups received similar initial treatments. The adjusted hazard ratio for mortality among
patients with cancer who filed for bankruptcy versus those who did not was 1.79 (95% CI, 1.64 to 1.96).
Hazard ratios varied by cancer type: colorectal, prostate, and thyroid cancers had the highest hazard
ratios. Excluding patients with distant-stage disease from the models did not have an effect on results.
Conclusion
Severe financial distress requiring bankruptcy protection after cancer diagnosis appears to be a risk
factor for mortality. Further research is needed to understand the process by which extreme financial
distress influences survival after cancer diagnosis and to find strategies that could mitigate this risk.

INTRODUCTION
For the 1.5 million persons diagnosed with cancer
each year, financial stress can be protracted and
severe. At the extreme end of financial stress are
those whose economic situation deteriorates to
the point where they must seek protection from
creditors. In a previous study, we found that
patients are 2.5 times more likely to file for
bankruptcy after a cancer diagnosis compared
with individuals who have not been diagnosed
with cancer.1
The term financial toxicity has been coined
in reference to the growing recognition that high
out-of-pocket expenditures during cancer treat-
ment are putting many families into severe
financial distress and, in some cases, leading to
refusal of treatment or nonadherence to recom-
mended treatments.2 Although some have called
for clinicians to be more aware of the problem
and to take proactive steps to reduce adverse
financial impacts,3 clinicians are ill prepared to
advise patients because they typically have little
knowledge of their patients’ health insurance or
general financial circumstances, and patients may
be reluctant to discuss their financial concerns
with providers. Altering the status quo would require
substantial changes in doctor-patient discussions and
may have broader implications for policies that affect
out-of-pocket liabilities for patients with cancer. It is
therefore reasonable to ask whether financial distress
can lead to poorer outcomes, particularly survival, for
patients with cancer.

 Although other studies have shown a relationship between
cancer diagnosis and financial distress, few have examined whether
economic hardship leads to poorer outcomes. Accordingly, in this
study, by using a population-based cancer registry linked with
federal bankruptcy records for the region, we examined the
mortality risk for patients with cancer who file for bankruptcy
compared with patients who have cancer but do not file for
bankruptcy.
METHODS
Study Population
Our study included individuals with cancers recorded in the Western
Washington Cancer Surveillance System (CSS). CSS is population-based
cancer registry that is part of the National Cancer Institute’s SEER pro-
gram. We included persons with all cancers except nonmelanoma skin
cancer diagnosed between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2009. We
excluded persons younger than age 21 years at the time of cancer diagnosis,
those with another malignancy diagnosed before the study period, those
with in situ cancers at diagnosis, or those whose cancers were diagnosed at
time of death. The remaining individuals were linked with records of the
US Bankruptcy Court, Western District of Washington (USBC-WDW).
The court serves the 13 counties in the CSS region and has complete
electronic case files dating from June 1991. The bankruptcy database
includes information about the filing such as bankruptcy chapter, number
of creditors, and assets and liabilities at the time of bankruptcy. We
included only persons filing for either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy
through December 31, 2009. Debtors filing under Chapter 7 typically
retain only exempt assets (nonexempt assets are liquidated for the benefit
of creditors) in exchange for the discharge of some of their debt, whereas
those filing under Chapter 13 retain ownership of most of their assets and
typically repay creditors over 3 to 5 years. The majority of personal
bankruptcies filed in the United States are under Chapter 7.
SEER-CSS records were linked to USBC-WDW bankruptcy records
by using a probabilistic algorithm that included name, sex, address of
residence, and the last four digits of the Social Security number. For
patients who filed for bankruptcy multiple times, we included only the first
filing after their cancer diagnosis. Deaths were determined from cancer
registry records.
The study design was approved by the Fred Hutchinson Institutional
Review Board. Judge Karen Overstreet (then Chief Judge of the USBC-
WDW, 2005) issued a letter of support on February 1, 2008, permitting
linkage of the CSS and USBC-WDW databases.
Analyses
For all cancers, we calculated the cumulative incidence of bankruptcy
conditional on survival until the time point of interest, treating death
before bankruptcy as a competing event. Only the first bankruptcy filing
after diagnosis was counted; subsequent filings were not included in the
analysis. Details of our approach to determining bankruptcy incidence
among patients with cancer are available in Ramsey et al.1
To assess the association between bankruptcy filing and mortality, we
used Cox regression models on a propensity score matched sample.
Propensity score matching was used to balance the distributions of
observed baseline characteristics between patients with cancer who filed
for bankruptcy and those who did not. This approach has been shown to
reduce the effect of selection bias in observational studies.4,5
We obtained propensity scores within each cancer type by using
baseline variables and logistic regression to model the odds of filing for
bankruptcy. The baseline variables included sex, race, marital status, urban
versus rural residence, income level on the basis of the individual’s home
ZIP code, year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, and initial
treatment modality (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone
therapy). By using the logistic regression model, we calculated the pre-
dicted probability of filing (the propensity score) for each patient. We then
matched pairs of patients from the group that filed for bankruptcy and the
group that did not file for bankruptcy by using their propensity scores and
a caliper equal to one-quarter of the standard deviation of the logit of the
propensity score. We examined the balance between baseline covariates
before and after propensity score matching by using standardized
differences.6
In the propensity score matched sample, we fit Cox models regressing
survival on bankruptcy filing status with a robust variance estimator to
account for clustering as a result of pair matching and adjusting for the
propensity score. The predictor of interest was a time-dependent covariate
indicating that the individual had filed for bankruptcy. We also included a
time-dependent covariate to reflect the time of enactment of the Bank-
ruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This act,
the largest revision of bankruptcy law since 1978, had a profound albeit
temporary increase in the number of bankruptcy filings. We fit one model
for all cancers and a separate model for each cancer type. In all models, we
used age as the time scale to account for left truncation using age at
diagnosis as the start time.7
To address the potential issue of reverse causality in which bankruptcy
may have followed major disease progression (ie, cases in which bank-
ruptcy was declared to protect an inheritance), and because the prognosis
of advanced cancers is poor regardless of patient financial circumstances
and unpredictably responsive to therapy, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis limited to patients diagnosed when the disease was in early stage
and who declared bankruptcy within 1 year of diagnosis so that they would
still likely have been in early stage at the time of filing. We fit the same
Cox models as mentioned before but limiting to patients diagnosed with
local- or regional-stage cancers and censoring patients who declared
for bankruptcy late (more than 1 year after diagnosis at the time of
bankruptcy).
In a separate sensitivity analysis, we implemented propensity score
matching that accounted for the time-dependent exposure. Instead of
simultaneously matching all patients who were ever observed to file for
bankruptcy to patients who were not, we used a sequential matching
algorithm in which each patient who filed for bankruptcy was matched to a
patient who was alive and still at risk for filing for bankruptcy at that time.8
Finally, we carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the sus-
ceptibility of our results to unmeasured confounding, that is, factors that
may influence both the risk for bankruptcy and the risk for death. To do so,
we assumed the existence of an unmeasured confounder that was mod-
erately associated with bankruptcy. We then investigated what level of
association with mortality would have rendered our results statistically
nonsignificant and reversed the estimated association between bankruptcy
and mortality in the model with all cancers had the confounder been
included in the analysis.9 All analyses were conducted by using R statistical
software, version 3.2.1.
RESULTS
Between 1995 and 2009, there were 231,596 persons recorded in
SEER who were diagnosed with cancer and who met study criteria
for inclusion. During that same time period, 4,728 of those
individuals filed for bankruptcy protection (3,909 under Chapter 7
and 819 under Chapter 13).
Baseline characteristics for the original study sample and the
propensity score matched sample are provided in Table 1. In the
original sample, there are systematic differences between patients
with cancer who filed for bankruptcy compared with those who did
not. Patients who filed were more likely to be younger, female,
nonwhite, have local- or regional- (v distant-) stage disease at
diagnosis (using SEER staging criteria), and have received

 treatment. After propensity score matching, 7,682 patients
remained in the analysis, with 3,841 patients in each group. In the
propensity score matched sample (Table 1), the two groups were
similar with respect to baseline measures. Both groups in the
propensity score matched sample consisted of patients who were
diagnosed at a mean age of 53 years (standard deviation, 14.7
years), with more men than women in the sample (54% v 46%). A
majority of the patients were white (86%), married (60%), and
lived in urban residences (91%). Most patients were diagnosed
with local-stage (59%) or regional-stage (25%) cancer with a
smaller proportion (14%) diagnosed with distant-stage cancer.
Both groups were balanced with respect to the first treatment
modality received. Mean income (by ZIP code) in both groups was
$49,000 (standard deviation, $12,000).

 Table 2 displays the cumulative probabilities of bankruptcy
conditional on survival and the survival probabilities of patients
with cancer in the first 5 years after diagnosis. Figure 1 displays the
cumulative incidence of bankruptcy and mortality for the four
major cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate) stratified by
stage at diagnosis. At 5 years from diagnosis, lung cancer had the
highest cumulative incidence of bankruptcy and the poorest overall
survival.
The association between bankruptcy filing and mortality
varied widely across individual cancers (Table 3; full regression
models available upon request). Mortality rates among patients
with breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer who filed for
bankruptcy were significantly higher than for patients with those
cancers who did not file for bankruptcy. The risk of mortality was
almost twice as high among patients with prostate cancer who filed
for bankruptcy compared with those who did not, and it was 2.5
times as high among patients with colorectal cancer who filed
compared with those who did not. Restricting the analysis to early-
stage cancers and bankruptcy filings to within 1 year of diagnosis
showed similar results (Table 4). Sequential matching on the
propensity score to account for the time-dependent exposure also
showed similar results (available upon request).

Financial Insolvency and Mortality in Cancer
 Finally, our results were found to not be very sensitive to
unmeasured confounding. Specifically, in a sensitivity analysis, we
assumed that an unmeasured confounder existed, and we esti-
mated the conditions under which adjustment for the unmeasured
confounder would have an impact on the results for the model with
all cancers. We found that under moderate association between the
unmeasured confounder and bankruptcy, the adjusted association
between bankruptcy and mortality would remain positive and
statistically significant as long as the association between the
unmeasured confounder and mortality was also moderate (hazard
ratio, # 1.6).
DISCUSSION
Financial distress and insolvency are now recognized as unfor-
tunate but common events that pose significant difficulties for
patients with cancer and their families.10 By linking the Western
Washington SEER Cancer Registry and federal bankruptcy records
over 15 years, we were able to explore the question of whether those
who filed for bankruptcy after a cancer diagnosis had a higher risk
for death from any cause. We found a consistent, positive asso-
ciation between filing for bankruptcy and earlier mortality,

 suggesting that those who reach the point of financial insolvency
after a cancer diagnosis have significantly poorer outcomes than
those who do not.
Other studies have shown that financial hardship is inde-
pendently associated with excess mortality risk. Evaluating data
from the 1996 Health and Retirement Study, Tucker-Seeley et al11
found that older persons reporting one or more financial hardships
had hazard ratios of 1.4 to 1.8 for mortality compared with those
who did not report any financial hardships. Earlier studies also
showed a general association between financial hardship and other
adverse health outcomes.12-16 Our study appears to be unique in
that we include verified information on a specific medical con-
dition (cancer), bankruptcy, and mortality.
Our methods address several issues that might bias retro-
spective database evaluations of the association between bank-
ruptcy and survival. First, patients who filed for bankruptcy have to
survive long enough to do so, whereas the group of patients who
did not file for bankruptcy perhaps includes sicker patients who
should have filed but died before they had the chance to go through
the complicated process of filing for bankruptcy. These issues may
be more prevalent in the distant-stage group, particularly over the
short term (ie, , 3 years from diagnosis). To address this issue, we
used propensity score matching to balance the proportion of
patients in the bankruptcy and no bankruptcy groups by stage of
cancer at diagnosis. Second, propensity score matching addresses
the possibility that patients who are treated may be more likely to
go bankrupt as a result of the associated expenses but are less likely
to die because of the benefits afforded by treatment. Third, pro-
pensity score matching addresses the fact that patients who are
diagnosed at younger ages are more likely to go bankrupt but less
likely to die as a result of all causes.
Even with these adjustments, our analysis has important
limitations.
First,
propensity
matching
cannot
correct
for
unmeasured factors that may differ between the bankrupt and
nonbankrupt groups that also influence survival. It is possible that
those who go bankrupt have higher rates of behaviors that are also
related to earlier mortality (eg, smoking). We considered this issue
with sensitivity analysis and found that such unmeasured con-
founding would need to be somewhat severe to render our results
statistically nonsignificant. Second, as noted earlier, we cannot
identify a causal pathway between bankruptcy and early mortality
given the limitations of our data set. Finally, although we did not
have specific information on previous financial status, other
variables such as age, sex, race, marital status, ZIP code–level
income, and treatment received served as appropriate proxies for
financial status.
Our results highlight the need for future studies that identify
causal factors linking bankruptcy and excess mortality for patients
with cancer. The following are possible explanations for this
association: patients with cancer who filed for bankruptcy were less
likely to complete or have access to follow-up treatment, patients
with advanced-stage diagnoses filed for bankruptcy to protect their
assets for heirs, and the primary motivator for bankruptcy was to
reduce or eliminate collection activity. Failure to complete
appropriate treatment could also be the result of refusal of pre-
bankruptcy health care providers to continue providing care after
the discharge of debts owed for prebankruptcy care. On the basis of
our analysis, it seems unlikely that patients with terminal disease
filed for bankruptcy to preserve their assets for their heirs or to
alleviate their heirs from collection activities they knew would be
forthcoming if they did not file for bankruptcy. When we excluded
patients with advanced-stage diagnoses, the bankruptcy rate for the
remaining patients was unchanged, suggesting that those with
advanced-stage diagnoses did not file for bankruptcy at a higher
rate than the remaining patients. Second, unless there is significant
equity in a home to protect through filing for bankruptcy (the
Washington State homestead exemption is $125,000), a debtor is
typically left with only minimal exempt assets after filing for
bankruptcy, leaving little for heirs. Thus, only the reduction in
collection activity would remain as a possible factor, and for some
patients, this could be a strong stress-relieving motivator.
Our results may have important policy implications. The
impacts of financial insolvency on mortality observed for this study
are similar to or exceed observed socioeconomic disparities in
survival outcomes.17-19 If the risk of such severe financial distress
after a cancer diagnosis can be reduced through intervention, it
may confer an important benefit for the individuals who would
otherwise face this problem. Bankruptcy has been shown to be
more than 2.5 times more common in patients with cancer
compared with those without cancer.1 In addition, because
bankruptcy represents the extreme end of a spectrum of financial
hardship, it is possible that levels of financial difficulty short of
bankruptcy could also influence survival. Previous studies have
shown an association between high out-of-pocket costs and

Financial Insolvency and Mortality in Cancer
 nonadherence to chemotherapy, which may represent an early
point on the trajectory toward bankruptcy and early mortality at
which intervention could take place.20-22 Future studies that
include information on the financial and insurance status of
patients at the time of diagnosis and throughout their treatment
will be needed to fully understand the relationship among cancer,
financial difficulties, and bankruptcy. Also important is the impact
of cancer on the patient’s ability to remain employed, because most
health insurance is obtained through the workplace. These factors
are particularly important in younger working-age populations in
which employment, income, insurance status, and personal assets
vary greatly. The new Affordable Care Act has given many more
persons access to health insurance and thus may moderate the
differences we observed in this study.
Because financial distress appears to have a significant negative
impact on health outcomes, we believe that cancer care facilities
and oncology practitioners may need to consider the financial
health of their patients as a matter of course simultaneously with
the initiation of therapy. Strategies that ensure access to and
completion of recommended therapies should be an integral part
of cancer care. Our results underscore the importance of con-
sidering the recommendation for and use of services that have
limited evidence of substantial benefit and potential high out-of-
pocket costs. Finally, the rapid rise in the cost of individual cancer
therapies is raising out-of-pocket costs for patients with cancer,
even in the face of expanding insurance coverage. Policies aimed at
reducing financial exposure of patients, such as caps on patient
out-of-pocket costs, expanding access to patient assistance pro-
grams, or limits on rate of rise in the price of treatments may be
necessary to mitigate the negative health consequences that stem
from the rapidly rising cost of cancer care.
