Purpose:
To determine the heritability of nuclear cataract progression and to explore prospectively the effect
of dietary micronutrients on the progression of nuclear cataract.
Design:
Prospective cohort study.
Participants:
Cross-sectional nuclear cataract and dietary measurements were available for 2054 white
female twins from the TwinsUK cohort. Follow-up cataract measurements were available for 324 of the twins (151
monozygotic and 173 dizygotic twins).
Methods:
Nuclear cataract was measured using a quantitative measure of nuclear density obtained from
digital Scheimpflug images. Dietary data were available from EPIC food frequency questionnaires. Heritability was
modeled using maximum likelihood structural equation twin modeling. Association between nuclear cataract
change and micronutrients was investigated using linear and multinomial regression analysis. The mean interval
between baseline and follow-up examination was 9.4 years.
Main Outcome Measures:
Nuclear cataract progression.
Results:
The best-fitting model estimated that the heritability of nuclear cataract progression was 35% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 13e54), and individual environmental factors explained the remaining 65% (95% CI,
46e87) of variance. Dietary vitamin C was protective against both nuclear cataract at baseline and nuclear
cataract progression (b ¼ �0.0002, P ¼ 0.01 and b ¼ �0.001, P ¼ 0.03, respectively), whereas manganese and
intake of micronutrient supplements were protective against nuclear cataract at baseline only (b ¼ �0.009, P ¼
0.03 and b ¼ �0.03, P ¼ 0.01, respectively).
Conclusions:
Genetic factors explained 35% of the variation in progression of nuclear cataract over a
10-year period. Environmental factors accounted for the remaining variance, and in particular, dietary vitamin C

Age-related cataract is the leading cause of blindness in the
world, affecting approximately 20 million people, particu-
larly in sub-Saharan Africa.1 Its prevalence increases from
2.9% in the 43- to 54-year age group to 40% in those
older than 75 years of age.2 As the world’s population ages,
cataract will remain a serious healthcare and socioeconomic
burden, in terms of both healthcare provision and blindness
in less-developed countries.
Nuclear cataract is the most common form of age-related
cataract.2 Apart from age, other factors associated with
nuclear cataract are smoking, oxidative stress, and dietary
antioxidant intake.3e5 However, studies of the effect of
dietary vitamin C intake,6e11 serum vitamin C concen-
trations,6,9,11e13 and vitamin C supplementation6,10,14 on
nuclear cataract formation often have given conflicting re-
sults.
Case-control
studies7,11,12,14
and
some
cohort
studies6,9,10 have found protective effects. Other prospective
cohort studies have found no effect overall8,13,15 or protective
effects only in subgroups.8,15 Similarly to vitamin C, di-
etary6,16 and supplemental14,17 vitamin E intake and vitamin
E blood concentrations6,13 have been shown to be related
inversely with nuclear cataract. Randomized clinical trials of
vitamins C and E supplementation alone or in combination
with other vitamins failed to find an effect.18,19 Vitamin A has
been associated with a reduced risk of nuclear cataract,9,20,21
as have lutein and zeaxanthin.22e24 The studies exploring
dietary nutrients and cataract progression have findings
similar to those looking at prevalent cataract, with cohort
studies finding a protective effect.16,25 However, supplement
trials largely have failed to find an effect.18,26,27
As opposed to vitamins and micronutrients,28 the role of
minerals in cataract formation in general and in nuclear
cataract in particular is poorly studied. Together with
epidemiologic factors, genetic factors also play a role in
cataract formation. We previously reported that genetic
factors explain 48% of cross-sectional variance in age-related
nuclear cataract.29 In a recent genome-wide meta-analysis,
variants in 2 genes, CRYAA and KCNAB1, were found to be
associated with nuclear cataract in Asian populations,30 but no
findings are available for populations of European origin. In
comparison with epidemiologic factors, little is known about
genetic susceptibility factors in age-related cataract.

 Factors that lead to the development of a phenotype may
be different from factors underlying change, such as pro-
gression of lens opacity. Therefore, we set out to establish
the relative importance of genes on progression of nuclear
cataract using a classic twin model with a highly quantita-
tive measure of nuclear cataract. We also examined how
intake of micronutrients and supplements associated with
nuclear cataract at baseline affects nuclear cataract pro-
gression over a decade.
Methods
Subjects
Nuclear cataract data at baseline were available for 2515 white female
twins (mean age, 62.3 years; range, 50.1e83.1 years) from the
TwinsUK cohort, 2054 of whom had also completed a food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) around the time of their eye examination. The
median time interval between an eye test taking place and a FFQ
completion was 2 years. The 461 twins with cataract data but without
FFQ data were 2.5 years younger on average and less affected by
cataract. Cataract progression data were collected from 324 twins (151
monozygotic [MZ] and 173 dizygotic [DZ]) with a mean age at
follow-up of 69.8�5.4 years (range, 58.3e83.6 years) as part of the
Healthy Ageing in Twins (HATS) study between 2006 and 2010.31
Individuals included in the follow-up were all part of our original
cataract heritability study of 1012 twin participants assessed in 1998
and1999.29The mean timebetweenbaseline and second visits was 9.4
years (range, 7e12 years). The smaller number of individuals with
follow-up data is mainly due to the fact that the HATS study (in
which the follow-up data werecollected)wasnot designedspecifically
as a cataract follow-up study and had different selection criteria:
Participants were aged more than 40 years and had to have previously
attended clinical phenotyping irrespective of whether they had an eye
examination or not (N ¼ 4610) (Fig 1). The TwinsUK study started in
1992, but eye measures were performed only on subjects more than 50
years of age in 1998e1999, and subsequently from 2006. That meant
that individuals (aged �50 years) who attended the HATS visit and
who did not have eye examinations in 1989e1999 had their
baseline
cataract
assessment
during
HATS
(2006e2011;
N ¼ 1523). Reasons for having only longitudinal data for 324 of
the original 1012 twins included death (N ¼ 52), withdrawal
of
participation
from
the
TwinsUK
registry
(N
¼
169),
noncontactable (N ¼ 30), refusal of further phenotyping (N ¼ 82),
cataract surgery (N ¼ 11), and refusal of dilating drops or
unavailability of ophthalmic testing at the HATS visit (N ¼ 344).
Both the baseline study and the HATS study received local
research ethics approval and were conducted according to the
tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All the participants gave
written informed consent.
Phenotyping
Nuclear Cataract Scores. Digital black and white lens photo-
graphs were taken using a Scheimpflug camera (Case 2000;
Marcher Enterprises Ltd., Worcester, UK), and the same camera
was used at both baseline and follow-up. Nuclear cataract was
measured quantitatively by calculating the pixel density in the
center of the lens nucleus, also known as the central nuclear dip
score (NDS).29 This score measures the amount of white scatter
(opalescence), and more opacification results in higher pixel
density. Because NDS uses black-and-white images, it does not
assess the brunescence of the lens. Nuclear cataract progression
was measured as the difference in measurements between the
visits: DNDS ¼ NDS at follow-up � NDS at baseline. Both NDS
and DNDS were not normally distributed and therefore were
transformed using natural logarithm before the analysis.
Nutrient Intake. Intake of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals)
and supplements was estimated using the EPIC FFQ, which was self-
administered at the baseline visit. This questionnaire explored the
average frequency of intake of 131 foods and supplements over a
1-year period.32,33 Nutrient intake was calculated using an established
nutrient database, and the dietary variables were adjusted for calorie
intake, yielding an energy-adjusted mg/mg of each nutrient per person
per day.32,34,35 We considered the following micronutrients in the
analysis: sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron,

 copper, zinc, chloride, manganese, iodine, retinol, carotene, vitamin
D, vitamin E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, tryptophan, vitamin B6,
vitamin B12, folate, pantothenate, biotin, and vitamin C.
Data on supplement intake were available for 33 different sup-
plements. However, the percentage of individuals taking any single
supplement was 10% or less. Supplements were grouped as follows:
any supplements; micronutrient supplements (vitamins and minerals
in any combination); micronutrient supplements excluding multivi-
tamins (e.g., vitamin C only, vitamin D only, iron only, ACD
complex); minerals only (e.g., iron only, calcium only); and other
supplements (e.g., aloe vera, Echinacea, Ginkgo, omega-3). Each
supplement group was coded as a binary variable, with “yes” indi-
cating that they took 1 or more of the supplements in a specific group.
Statistical Analysis
Modeling of Heritability. Heritability was analyzed in 310 twins
(155 pairs: 72 MZ and 83 DZ) because data were missing on 14 co-
twins. Zygosity was determined by a standardized questionnaire
and
confirmed
using
genome-wide
single
nucleotide
poly-
morphism
genotyping
data
or
DNA
short
tandem
repeat
fingerprinting.
Twin studies are able to estimate the heritability of a trait (the
amount of variance explained by genetic factors) using maximum
likelihood structural equation modeling. The variance of the trait and
the covariance within twin pairs are used to estimate additive genetic
effects (A), shared/family environmental effects (C), and individual
environmental effects (E). We implemented the modeling in the
OpenMx package (http://openmx.psyc.virginia.edu). The goodness of
fit of the full ACE model and submodels were compared with the
observed data and the best fitting model was selected.
Nutrient Factor Analysis. Comparisons of means and pro-
portions for all variables between individuals with or without
follow-up data, or between MZ and DZ twins per group in terms of
age, nuclear cataract scores, and nutrient and supplement intake
were performed using 2-sample, 2-tailed t tests or z tests, assuming
equal variance.
Association was assessed using linear regression analyses.
Univariable linear regression was first carried out where each factor
or supplement group was individually regressed against NDS at
baseline. All nutrients or supplement groups showing significant
univariable association (P < 0.05) were then included in a multi-
variable linear regression model; independent variables were iden-
tified using a stepwise backward procedure with threshold for
removal set at 0.05. Factors showing significant (P < 0.05) asso-
ciation in the multivariable model were tested for association with
progression. We used linear models to establish the relationship
between NDS (continuous variable) and nutrients, but because NDS
had to be normalized, giving a clinical interpretation of the betas
becomes more difficult. Therefore, in addition to the linear models,
we calculated risk reduction by calculating relative risk ratios
(RRRs) using multinomial regression. In this case, NDS, DNDS,
and the associated nutrients were divided into tertiles, and the first
tertile was set as reference while supplement intake per supplement
group was kept binary. In all cases, models were adjusted for family
structure and age at the first visit only (baseline analysis) or for both
age at baseline and Dage (age at follow-up � age at baseline). All
analyses were carried using the STATA10 statistical package (Sta-
taCorp LP, College Station, TX; www.stata.com).
Results
Cross-sectional data were available for 2054 white female twins
(827 MZ and 916 DZ), 324 (151 MZ and 173 DZ) of whom also
had nuclear cataract measured at follow-up. Baseline characteris-
tics and nutrient and supplement intake are shown in Table 1, and
an example of a lens image is available in Figure 2. The twins with
follow-up data were on average 1.1 years younger at baseline (60.4
vs. 61.5 years) and, given their younger age, had less cataract
(mean NDS scores of 55.3 and 60.4, respectively) compared with
those with only cross-sectional data. In both cases, these differ-
ences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The MZ and DZ
twins with follow-up data were similar in terms of age and NDS
scores (P > 0.05). The MZ and DZ twins with cross-sectional data
only were similar in terms of age, but the MZ twins had a slightly
higher NDS score (61.6 vs. 59.3; P ¼ 0.02).
There were also no statistically significant differences between
groups in terms of micronutrient intake except for iron (P ¼ 0.02),
thiamine (P ¼ 0.04), and biotin (P ¼ 0.01). The twins with follow-
up data had slightly lower iron and thiamine intake (mean of 12.6
and 1.7 mg, respectively) and slightly higher biotin intake (mean of
49.7 mg) compared with individuals without follow-up data. There
were also no significant differences in supplement intake between
the 2 groups (P > 0.05). There were no statistically significant
differences between MZ and DZ twins in terms of nutrient or
supplement intake (P > 0.05).
As expected, nuclear cataract scores progressed in all partici-
pants (Fig 3). The mean baseline central NDS was 55�11 (range,
32e99) with the score increasing by an average of 19.9�16.9
(range, 1e137) over the period of follow-up. The heritability
analysis, conducted on 155 twin pairs (72 MZ and 83 DZ pairs),
showed that the best-fitting model was one explained by additive
genetic factors and the unique (individual) environment, with no
significant effect of a common environment or nonadditive genetic
factors. Calculations estimated the heritability to be 0.35, meaning
that genetic factors explained 35% of variance (95% confidence
interval [CI], 13e54) in progression of nuclear cataract, with in-
dividual environmental factors accounting for the remaining 65%
(95% CI, 46e87).
To test associations between micronutrient intake and cataract
progression, we used univariable regression (Table 2) followed
by stepwise regression in 2054 female twins who had baseline
data
on
nutrient
intake.
Seven
micronutrients
showed
a
significant association (P < 0.05) with NDS and were used in
multivariable
analysis:
potassium,
magnesium,
manganese,
phosphorus, vitamins C and E, and folate. After stepwise
multivariable
regression,
2
factors
remained
significantly
associated with NDS at baseline: vitamin C (b ¼ �0.0002;
standard deviation [SD] ¼ 6.3E-05; P ¼ 0.01) and manganese
(b ¼ �0.009; SD ¼ 0.04; P ¼ 0.03). From these 2 nutrients,
only vitamin C showed association with cataract progression
(b ¼ �0.001; SD ¼ 0.001; P ¼ 0.03). A sensitivity analysis
excluding subjects with greatest progression (>100 units of
change) did not alter the result. Comparing people in the
highest and lowest tertiles of vitamin C intake was associated
with a 19% risk reduction at baseline (RRR, 0.81; 95% CI,
0.68e0.96) and a 33% risk reduction of cataract progression
(RRR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47e0.91) (Table 3). Manganese intake
was associated with 20% risk reduction (RRR, 0.80; 95% CI,
0.67e0.95) at baseline (Table 3).
Two supplement groups, micronutrient supplements and minerals
only, showed a significant association with NDS (P < 0.05) (Table 2),
but only micronutrient supplements stayed significant in the
multivariate model (b¼�0.03; SD ¼ 0.01; P ¼ 0.01), and their
intake led to an 18% risk reduction in people within the highest
compared with the lowest tertile of nutrient intake (RRR, 0.82;
95% CI, 0.57e1.20) (Table 3). We found no statistically significant
association between taking micronutrients in supplemental form and
progression of nuclear cataract.

 Discussion
This study found that progression of nuclear cataract over a
10-year period in a group of UK female twins is influenced
by genetic factors that explain 35% of variance. The herita-
bility estimate of cataract progression is lower than our
previous
cross-sectional
estimates
of
susceptibility
to
development of nuclear cataract in this cohort,29 and it is also
lower than the heritability estimated in the 324 individuals
estimated from the nuclear score measurement at follow-up
(61%; 95% CI, 45e72). This is consistent with previous
studies showing that heritability generally is lower when
examining change, compared with cross-sectional stud-
ies.36e38 In addition to early developmental differences and
the body’s response to environmental factors in adulthood,
environmentally driven processes or accumulated “errors”
(e.g., somatic gene mutation and epigenetic remodeling)
might play a greater role in determining change during aging
than genetic factors.38
This study also identified vitamin C as a micronutrient
affecting nuclear cataract progression. We also replicate the
previously found association between cross-sectional cata-
ract and vitamin C intake. Vitamin C intake has long been
studied in relation to age-related cataract because it is the
L-enantiomer of ascorbate. A significant concentration of
ascorbate is present in the aqueous humor that bathes the
lens and may reduce oxidation products in the lens, thus
reducing oxidative stress.39,40 However, the conclusions of
the many studies of the effects of ascorbate on cataract
development are inconsistent and often conflicting.6e15
Many of these have studied relatively well-nourished pop-
ulations and are cross-sectional, although cross-sectional
studies in India, where overall antioxidant levels may be
lower, have found an inverse relationship between vitamin

 C and cataract.9,20 Our results are similar to those of the
Carotenoids in Age-Related Eye Disease Study that showed
vitamin C intake, assessed with an FFQ 10 years before
cataract assessment, to be protective of nuclear cataract
prevalence.15 The Blue Mountains Eye Study also found
that vitamin C intake, through both diet and supplements
together, resulted in a lower nuclear cataract incidence
over 10 years.10 This study is the first, to our knowledge,
to show that dietary vitamin C intake protects against
progression of nuclear lens opacity.
We also found dietary manganese to be protective against
cross-sectional nuclear cataract independent of vitamin C.
We cannot exclude that this association was a type I error,
given we did not find an association between dietary
manganese and nuclear cataract progression and the lack
of a dose response (Table 3), although factors associated
with incidence and progression do not always overlap.
Manganese is an important antioxidant present in the
human lens,41e43 and its concentration has been reported
to be lower in cataractous lenses in comparison with normal
lenses.43,44 This study was not designed to elucidate the
causeeeffect relationship underlying the associations we
found; therefore, we cannot distinguish whether manganese
depletion is a cause or effect of cataractogenesis. Further
studies are needed to answer this question. We also detected
an association between supplemental intake of micro-
nutrients and cross-sectional nuclear cataract but not be-
tween supplemental nutrients and cataract progression.
These results are similar to those reported in the Blue
Mountains Eye Study.45 Because only 10% or less of the
participants in our study took any single supplement, we
had to group supplements together; therefore, we could not
draw conclusions on the effect of any single supplement
or of components of supplements (e.g., supplemental
vitamin C).
We used a highly quantitative measure of cataract from
digital images (NDS), which essentially measures the nuclear
opalescence (or “white scatter”) of the lens. The measure also
was highly reproducible: the intraclass correlation coefficient
for the worse eye in 30 subjects from our original study29 who
came for repeat measurements was 0.93. The fact that every
subject measured showed progression suggests that NDS is
sensitive to change. Many epidemiologic studies have used
the Lens Opacity Classification System (LOCS) grading
scale, comparing phenotype with standardized photographs of
6 stages of lens opacification, which includes both nuclear
opalescence and nuclear color or brunescence.4 The LOCS III

 was developed to increase steps between scores to allow greater

reproducibility.46 Longitudinal studies using the LOCS III
scale show relatively little change: In the Longitudinal Study
of Cataract, only 24% of participants had an increase in
nuclear opacities over an average of 4.6 years.25 Although
our central NDS is not the same measure, it is highly
correlated with average nuclear opalescence graded digitally
or using a slit lamp.29 Digital imageederived NDSs using
pixel density counts may be better suited for measuring pro-
gression and allowed our study the power to detect associations
with a relatively small sample size.
Study Limitations
A potential limitation is that our cohort is based on twin
volunteers rather than a population study, but they are unse-
lected and from across the United Kingdom and are unlikely to
significantly differ from the UK general population.47 Twin
studies use the “equal environment assumption” that the
degree of shared family environment is the same for both
MZ and DZ twin pairs. This is generally found to be true,
although there are few studies of elderly subjects that
explore this assumption. In addition, the TwinsUK cohort is
predominantly a female cohort, and we could not assess any
gender differences in risk factors. The findings of this study
can be generalizable only to Caucasian women of similar
age because they reflect cataract progression in a group of
white British women between, on average, the ages of 60
and 70 years, and so may not reflect other population groups
or age ranges. In this article, we explored the effect of all
micronutrients on nuclear cataract formation; however, we
had no data on carotenoid (lutein and zeaxanthin) intake.
We also lacked power to explore the effects of smoking on
cataract progression because 85% of participants have never
smoked.
Those participants with follow-up data collected were
seen as part of the HATS study, which was not designed as a
cataract follow-up study. This meant that the number of
subjects decreased to 324 individuals, thus reducing the
amount of data we could analyze and our power. The in-
dividuals who were lost to follow-up in HATS were in
general of lower socioeconomic status, had higher self-rated
health status, and were less health aware.31 Any introduced
bias probably would have resulted in loss of power because
this group of individuals are more likely to have less healthy
diets and more cataract. For this reason, we decided to test
the association with progression only for nutrients that
were associated with NDS at baseline. Those with follow-
up data were on average 1.8 years younger than the

 original cohort, but in general they were not significantly
different in other respects or in nutrient or supplement
intake, hopefully reducing potential selection bias in the
progression data. As in any observational study, ours is
potentially susceptible to residual confounding, missing
data, or misspecification of variables.
In summary, this study has shown that progression of nu-
clear cataract over a 10-year period is influenced by genetic
factors with a heritability of 35%. Dietary vitamin C and
manganese, both factors related to oxidative stress, seem to
influence cross-sectional nuclear cataract, and vitamin C intake
also significantly influences nuclear cataract progression.
