IMPORTANCE Administrative costs in the US health care system are an important component
of total health care spending, and a substantial proportion of these costs are attributable to
billing and insurance-related activities.
OBJECTIVE To examine and estimate the administrative costs associated with physician
billing activities in a large academic health care system with a certified electronic health
record system.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used time-driven activity-based costing.
Interviews were conducted with 27 health system administrators and 34 physicians in 2016
and 2017 to construct a process map charting the path of an insurance claim through the
revenue cycle management process. These data were used to calculate the cost for each
major billing and insurance-related activity and were aggregated to estimate the health
system’
s total cost of processing an insurance claim.
EXPOSURES Estimated time required to perform billing and insurance-related activities,
based on interviews with management personnel and physicians.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated billing and insurance-related costs for 5 types of
patient encounters: primary care visits, discharged emergency department visits, general
medicine inpatient stays, ambulatory surgical procedures, and inpatient surgical procedures.
RESULTS Estimated processing time and total costs for billing and insurance-related activities
were 13 minutes and $20.49 for a primary care visit, 32 minutes and $61.54 for a discharged
emergency department visit, 73 minutes and $124.26 for a general inpatient stay, 75 minutes
and $170.40 for an ambulatory surgical procedure, and 100 minutes and $215.10 for an
inpatient surgical procedure. Of these totals, time and costs for activities carried out by
physicians were estimated at a median of 3 minutes or $6.36 for a primary care visit, 3
minutes or $10.97 for an emergency department visit, 5 minutes or $13.29 for a general
inpatient stay, 15 minutes or $51.20 for an ambulatory surgical procedure, and 15 minutes or
$51.20 for an inpatient surgical procedure. Of professional revenue, professional billing costs
were estimated to represent 14.5% for primary care visits, 25.2% for emergency department
visits, 8.0% for general medicine inpatient stays, 13.4% for ambulatory surgical procedures,
and 3.1% for inpatient surgical procedures.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a time-driven activity-based costing study in a large
academic health care system with a certified electronic health record system, the estimated
costs of billing and insurance-related activities ranged from $20 for a primary care visit to
$215 for an inpatient surgical procedure. Knowledge of how specific billing and
insurance-related activities contribute to administrative costs may help inform policy
solutions to reduce these expenses.

dministrative costs have been estimated to represent
25% to 31% of total health care expenditures in the
United States,1-3 a proportion twice that found in
Canada and significantly greater than in all other Organiza-
tionforEconomicCo-operationandDevelopmentmemberna-
tions for which such costs have been studied.1,3,4 The rate of
growth in administrative costs in the United States has out-
paced that of overall health care expenditures1 and is pro-
jected to continue to increase without reforms to reduce ad-
ministrative complexity.5
Most of the administrative costs in the US health care sys-
tem (at least 62% based on prior studies) has been attributed
to billing and insurance-related activities (described as billing
hereafter).6 Billing costs are disproportionately high in the
United States: for instance, in primary care practice, perform-
ing these activities in the United States costs nearly 4 times
more than performing the corresponding activities in Canada.4
Knowledge of how specific billing activities contribute to
administrative costs may help inform policy solutions to re-
duce these expenses. However, most prior studies have ana-
lyzed billing costs in aggregate without attributing the costs
to specific component activities. Furthermore, most of these
studies were conducted over a decade ago and before wide-
spread adoption of certified electronic health record (EHR)
systems,1-4,6-9 which were in part intended to simplify the bill-
ing process. Specifically, proponents of the widespread move
to EHR systems have suggested that such systems would pro-
vide specific benefits to physicians, including, according to the
Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information
Technology, “accurate, streamlined coding and billing,”
“helping providers improve productivity,” “enabling provid-
ers to improve efficiency and meet their business goals,” and
“reducing costs through decreased paperwork.”10
Therefore, there is a need for high-quality, contemporary
data on billing costs. The aim of this study was to use a state-
of-the-artaccountingmethod,time-drivenactivity-basedcost-
ing,todevelopestimatesofbilling-relatedcostsinasingle,large
academic health care system and to determine whether such
costs vary across 5 key types of patient encounters: primary
care visits, discharged emergency department visits, general
medicine inpatient stays, ambulatory surgical procedures, and
inpatient surgical procedures.
Methods
This study reports on the development of a model to estimate
billing costs for physician services in an academic health sys-
tem with a certified EHR system. The model used time-driven
activity-based costing, a state-of-the-art accounting method.
The institutional review board of the Duke University Health
System determined that the study was exempt research.
Setting
This study was performed in an academic health care system
in North Carolina with 66 000 inpatient stays in 1500 inpa-
tient beds, more than 90 000 emergency department visits,
and more than 2 million outpatient visits in fiscal year 2016.
The system has more than 1600 physicians and 28 000 sup-
port staff; it adopted a certified EHR system in 2014.
More than 15 years ago, physician and hospital leaders con-
solidated all of the billing activities of the health system, ex-
cept payer contract negotiation, in a single billing organiza-
tion.Thebillingorganizationisawhollyownedlimitedliability

Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing
This study used time-driven activity-based costing to esti-
mate billing costs. This microanalytic technique combines
a process mapping approach from industrial engineering with
activity-based costing from accounting.11-13 The method has
been applied to several medical care pathways including an-
esthesia care,14 orthopedic surgery,15-18 radiology,19,20 gen-
eral surgery,21 neurosurgery,22 cancer care,23-25 emergency
care,26 cardiac surgery,27 and primary care.28-30 To our knowl-
edge, this analytic approach has not previously been applied
to billing functions in a health care setting. The first step in this

Process Mapping
Process maps were developed based on interviews with ad-
ministrators from business units throughout the billing orga-
nization. The interviews enabled the project team to describe
“the life of a bill,” from the time a patient is initially sched-
uled for an appointment through the time the health system
receives payment for the care provided. The tasks performed
during the life of a bill include preparing and submitting an
insurance claim, documenting services provided to an in-
sured health plan member, and obtaining payment from the
appropriate insurer.
Key Points
Question What are the administrative costs associated with
billing and insurance-related activities at an academic health care
system with a certified electronic health record system?
Findings In a time-driven activity-based costing study of
personnel and overhead costs in a large academic health care
system, the estimated costs of billing and insurance-related
activities ranged from $20 for a primary care visit to $215 for an
inpatient surgical procedure, representing 3% to 25% of
professional revenue.
Meaning In an academic health care system with a certified
electronic health record system, the estimated costs of billing and
insurance-related activities were substantial and varied depending
on the type of clinical encounter.

 Twenty-seven interviews were conducted systematically
based on the organizational chart of the billing organization
to ensure that the process map was complete and accurate;
eTable 3 in the Supplement lists the position classifications of
the interview participants. In each interview, respondents
were asked to describe the specific steps in the billing process
under their purview, the activities required to complete the
steps, the personnel assigned to each task, and the adminis-
trative and support personnel in each administrative unit.
Despite the complexity of the process maps, they were a
simplified depiction of the true billing process because the
model assumed (1) a sequential process that closely approxi-
mates the true billing process, although in reality some bills
occasionally cycle back to previous steps; (2) all payers re-
quire similar levels of documentation; and (3) management of
the automatic charges created by an EHR system poses only
minimal incremental costs.
Activity Costs
Each step in the process map identified a specific task to be
completed by administrative staff. For each step, the analysis
required an estimate of the time required to complete the task
and a personnel cost for the activity. The billing organization
did not have insight into the costs incurred by physicians en-
gaging in billing-related activities, so these costs were esti-
mated in a separate evaluation.
For most steps in the process map, management was able
toprovideindustrialengineeringproductivitystandardsonthe
mean number of expected transactions per individual per day.
For the few steps for which such standards did not exist, pro-
ductivity standards were developed using estimates derived
during manager interviews and validated through conversa-
tionswithsupervisorypersonnel.Respondentswerenotasked
to provide payer-specific data, so the results represent typi-
cal payer-agnostic costs for each billing activity.
For each person working directly on process map tasks
(treated as direct labor), there were supervisory and support
staff assigned to support these individuals (treated as indi-
rect labor). Indirect labor effort was assigned to direct labor
based on existing staffing relationships determined during the
manager interviews.
Administrativepersonnellaborcostsweredeterminedusing
the standard job classification level of the people assigned to
direct or indirect tasks and applying the “market target” salary
for people at that classification level as reported by the aca-
demic medical center. Labor costs for administrative person-
nel were calculated as the product of the activity time esti-
mates (in minutes) for each step in the process map by the cost
per minute of both direct and indirect personnel involved.
A separate survey was conducted to assess the compo-
nent of billing costs incurred by physicians participating in
billing-related activities. Examples of billing-related tasks,
which typically take place at the site of clinical care delivery
rather than within the billing organization, might include col-
lecting data and documents that are not otherwise clinically
necessary for patient care, completing billing-related data
elements in the electronic record, obtaining prior authoriza-
tion from insurance companies, responding to requests or
queries from the billing organization (including coding-
related questions), and participating in utilization manage-
ment telephone calls. To better estimate the time required
for these tasks, a convenience sample of physicians was sur-
veyed from primary care, emergency medicine, hospitalist
internal medicine, general surgery, and anesthesiology to
provide an estimate of how many minutes were required to
perform billing-related tasks for each patient encounter that
do not contribute directly to clinical care. The median
response within each specialty served as the time estimate
for the cost model.
These time estimates were translated into costs for physi-
cian time spent on billing activities for each physician spe-
cialty using mean academic physician salaries (with fringe
benefits applied at a rate of 27.5%),31 mean annual family
medicine physician work hours,32,33 and mean differences in
annual work hours across physician specialties34 (annual
work-hour estimates for anesthesiology were interpolated
from available data). Surgical and anesthesia costs were
added together in estimating physician costs for ambulatory
and inpatient surgical procedure costs.
Overhead Costs
In addition to labor costs, the billing organization incurs cor-
porate and divisional costs (eg, human resources, profes-
sional development, utility bills, information technology cost
allocations, and building depreciation) that cannot be
assigned directly to specific activities. These costs were
treated as overhead costs and allocated based on total pro-
cessing time within the organization (in other words, on a
per-direct-labor-minute basis, excluding physician billing
times because physicians are not supported by these admin-
istrative functions).
Analyses
Using the model described in the previous sections, physi-
cian billing costs were estimated for 5 types of patient encoun-
ters that were thought to be representative of common ser-
vices offered by the health system: primary care visits,
emergency department visits (discharged, not admitted), gen-
eral medicine inpatient stays, ambulatory surgical proce-
dures, and inpatient surgical procedures. For each of the 5 en-
counter types, the analysis “followed the bill” by documenting
all revenue cycle activities required to support billing for the
encounter. The personnel costs of all these activities (devel-
oped as described here), plus allocated divisional and corpo-
rate overhead, yielded the total revenue cycle billing cost for
each encounter. Total personnel costs were divided into di-
rect labor, support labor, and supervisory labor costs.
Some encounters, such as primary care visits, generate a
single global bill for professional and facility fees. Encounters
for other types of physician visits incur separate professional
and facility (hospital) bills for services in the health system.
In the latter cases, costs were developed for the entire epi-
sode of care, including billing costs from both professional and
hospital claims processing.
The cost-accounting model was developed in Microsoft
Excel and built from a variety of typical estimates of resource

 use at each step in the process map. The model did not incor-
porate variability because there is significant concern that
variation in this multistep process is likely correlated in some
unobservable fashion, leading to the potential for significant
multiplicative errors.
In the base-case analysis, only the annual cost alloca-
tions for the certified EHR system to the billing organization
were considered. A second analysis examined the influence
of including in overhead a 6-year amortization of the full pub-
lished costs of acquiring and implementing the health sys-
tem’
s certified EHR system.35,36 This analysis is based on the
assumptionthatreplacementofthepreviousnoncertifiedelec-
tronic record system was entirely to support billing activities.
In the base-case analysis, overhead costs were allocated
on the basis of direct labor costs. In a sensitivity analysis, an
alternative calculation was performed in which overhead was
allocated on a per-bill basis to examine the effect of this as-
sumption on the results.
To estimate the percentage of physician revenue devoted
to billing costs, billing costs were estimated for professional
services (or for global billing in primary care), and compared
with estimated physician revenue for each of the encounter
types. Annual billing costs for primary care physicians were
calculated using estimates of the standard clinical work sched-
ule at the academic medical center and the calculated billing
cost per visit.

 full process map. A more complete description of each
activity, as well as a full breakdown of cost contributions,
can be found in eMethods 1 and eTable 4 in the Supplement.
Data from interviews conducted with 27 health system ad-
ministrators and 34 physicians in 2016 and 2017 were used to
construct the process maps and estimate the cost for each ma-
jor activity (eTables 2 and 3 in the Supplement). Table 1 shows
the time-driven activity-based physician billing costs for the
5typesofencounters.Estimatedtotalprocessingtimeandtotal
costs for billing and insurance-related activities were 13 min-
utes and $20.49 for a primary care visit, 32 minutes and $61.54
for an emergency department visit, 73 minutes and $124.26
for a general inpatient stay, 75 minutes and $170.40 for an am-
bulatory surgery procedure, and 100 minutes and $215.10 for
an inpatient surgical procedure. All estimates include costs
for both professional billing and hospital billing.
Of these totals, the component of billing and insurance-
related activities carried out by physicians were estimated at
a median of 3 minutes or $6.36 for a primary care visit, 3 min-
utes or $10.97 for an emergency department visit, 5 minutes
or $13.29 for a general inpatient stay, 15 minutes or $51.20 for
an ambulatory surgery procedure, and 15 minutes or $51.20 for
an inpatient surgery.
Between 63% and 77% of the total costs were attributable
to administrative and physician labor, with the remainder rep-
resenting allocated overhead costs (Table 1; described in
eMethods 2 in the Supplement). The postencounter costs
for non–primary care encounters were mostly attributable to
medical coding.
When administrative costs were determined by labor type,
directlaborcostswerebetween72%and81%oftotallaborcosts
in all 5 encounter types (or 46%-57% of total overall costs)
(Table 2). Supervisory labor costs were between 7% and 9%
of total labor costs (or 4%-6% of total overall costs). Support
labor costs were 11% for primary care visits and 19% to 22% for
all other encounters (or 7%-16% of total overall costs).
In an analysis that amortized the full cost of the certified
EHR on each encounter, billing costs increased to $32.52 for a
primary care visit to $319.80 for an inpatient surgical encoun-
ter, which represented relative cost increases of 44% to 68%
over the base-case results (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
In a sensitivity analysis in which overhead costs were al-
located on a per-bill basis, the range of assigned overhead costs
narrowed. In this analysis, overhead charges of $15.70 were
applied to each encounter, with the exception of primary care
encounters, which were allocated half that amount, or $7.85,
given that these services generated only a single global bill.
This alternative allocation method increased the billing cost
for a primary care visit by 9% and reduced the billing cost of
an emergency department visit by 6%, a general medicine in-
patient stay by 24%, an ambulatory surgical visit by 14%, and
an inpatient surgical visit by 19% (eTable 6 in the Supple-
ment). Billing costs for professional services represented an
estimated 14.5% of primary care visit revenue, 25.3% of emer-
gency department visit revenue, 13.4% of ambulatory sur-
gery visit revenue, 3.1% of inpatient surgery visit revenue, and
8% of inpatient hospitalist visit revenue (Table 3).
In the academic medical center practice, primary care phy-
sicians have 45 weeks of clinical service during which she or
he has 36 hours per week of direct patient encounters. At a
meanof3patientsperhour,eachprimarycarephysicianwould
have an estimated total of 4860 visits annually. With billing

c For a general medicine inpatient stay, the billing and insurance-related cost of
physician time assumes that autopopulation of the electronic health record
after the first inpatient day occurs correctly without subsequent need for
physician time or alterations. The cost of professional billing assumes that the
incremental cost of additional inpatient days is minimal with respect to the
first inpatient day and that physicians are timely with their billing
responsibilities, such that all inpatient professional rounding charges are
processed and submitted to payers concurrently.

 costs of $20.49 per visit, this represents an estimated annual
billing cost of $99 581 per physician (Table 1).
Discussion
This study used a state-of-the-art cost accounting method to
derive the costs associated with billing for physician activi-
ties at an encounter level. Across the 5 services examined in
this study, billing costs for professional services ranged from
3.1% to 25.3% of professional revenue, which represented $20
to $215 in absolute costs per visit.
Previous studies of billing costs were developed before
adoption of certified EHR systems. These studies used a vari-
ety of methods to estimate costs, including existing aggre-
gate data,2,3,6 cost reports and departmental budgets,1,3,9
case studies,7 and interviews and surveys.3,4,6,8,9 They re-
ported that physician billing costs represented 10% to 14% of
revenue.6,7,9 This study, using a more accurate cost-tracing ap-
proach, estimated these costs to be 14.5% of primary care phy-
sician annual revenue, which is at the upper end reported in
previous studies.4,9
Billing activities were associated with these high costs
despite specific efforts to streamline billing operations.
Examination of the billing process did not reveal any signifi-
cantly wasteful or inefficient efforts, such as overt duplica-
tion of tasks or the performance of low-skill tasks by high-
wage personnel. One reason for this apparent efficiency may
be that collecting data on billing activities from a single uni-
fied billing organization likely eliminated duplication and
inefficiencies that could result from having the billing func-
tion performed in multiple locations.
Certified EHR systems were implemented, in part, to ad-
dress concerns about the significant administrative cost bur-
den in the US health care system. The Office of the National
Coordinator for Health Information Technology has sug-
gested that adoption of certified EHR systems could have eco-
nomic benefits for physicians and health systems by directly
addressing these costs.10 However, the results of the current
study suggest that administrative costs remain high even in
the setting of a certified EHR. Although the EHR system can
automatically generate bills for clinical visits, these systems
require the time of high-cost physicians to perform coding and
documentation activities that are unrelated to clinical ser-
vices. In addition, the process maps revealed that despite the
electronic system, the billing process still required multiple
steps by many types of personnel. Full allocation of certified
EHRs to billing activities significantly increased billing costs
from the base-case estimate.
These findings suggest that significant investments in cer-
tified health information technology have not reduced high
billing costs in the United States. To a large degree, the signifi-
cant administrative costs measured in this study are the con-
sequences of heterogeneous payment requirements across the
multiple payers and health plans contracting with the aca-
demic health center. The lack of standardized contracts and
price schedules within and across markets might explain why
administrativecostsintheUnitedStatesaresignificantlyhigher
than those in other nations that also make fee-for-service pay-
ments to private hospitals and physicians.37 Adoption of cer-
tified EHR systems by hospitals appears to have been unable
to cope with the complexity of multiple payer contracts or to
catalyze significant transformation of the administrative busi-
ness processes in US health care.

This study has several limitations. First, the costs repre-
sent conservative estimates of the costs of the billing process
based on a model of the process, not from actual examination
of patient bills. The billing cost estimates may represent a
lower bound on total billing costs because the study did not
include the cost of some other billing activities, such as charge
management and charge integrity, the costs of payer contract
negotiations,orbillingtrainingforphysicians.Whiletheanaly-
sis included cost allocations for the EHR system, billing-
related costs that are allocated to other units (such as clinical
departments) were not included.
Second, this study used market wage rates for labor costs,
andactualcostscanvarybyphysician,marketfactors,andstaff
tenure; in fact, actual labor costs at the health system are on
average 9% higher than wages used in the analysis due to staff
retention and wage increases.
Third,thefindingsmaybesensitivetopayermixanddocu-
mentation requirements, which may vary by state or region.
In addition, reimbursement rates negotiated with payers by
academic medical centers may differ from rates negotiated
by other health care centers and practices.
Fourth, the analysis was performed in an academic health
system that had a centralized, standalone organization to per-
formallbilling-relatedactivitiesforallunitsinthesystem.This
large shared-services organization likely benefits from some
economies of scale. It is probable that smaller organizations,
and those with more dispersed and fragmented billing func-
tions, would incur higher costs to perform billing processes.
Fifth, although estimates were provided for annual bill-
ing costs per primary care physicians, data were not available
to estimate per-physician annual billing costs for the other ser-
vice lines examined in this study.
Sixth,thestudydidnotconsidertheconsiderablecoststhat
payers incur to process claims and pay bills. Previous studies
have found commercial payer billing to be more costly than
hospital and professional billing,2,3,6 implying that a subse-
quent costing study that includes both payer and provider per-
spectivesmayproducetotalbillingcostsmorethantwicethose
found in the analysis.
Conclusions
In a time-driven activity-based costing study in a large
academic health care system with a certified EHR system, the
estimated costs of billing and insurance-related activities
ranged from $20 for a primary care visit to $215 for an inpa-
tientsurgicalprocedure.Knowledgeofhowspecificbillingand
insurance-related activities contribute to administrative costs
may help inform policy solutions to reduce these expenses.
