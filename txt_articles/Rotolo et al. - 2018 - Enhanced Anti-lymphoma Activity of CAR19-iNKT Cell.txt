SUMMARY
Chimeric antigen receptor anti-CD19 (CAR19)-T cell immunotherapy-induced clinical remissions in CD19+
B cell lymphomas are often short lived. We tested whether CAR19-engineering of the CD1d-restricted
invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells would result in enhanced anti-lymphoma activity. CAR19-iNKT cells
co-operatively activated by CD1d- and CAR19-CD19-dependent interactions are more effective than
CAR19-T cells against CD1d-expressing lymphomas in vitro and in vivo. The swifter in vivo anti-lymphoma
activity of CAR19-iNKT cells and their enhanced ability to eradicate brain lymphomas underpinned an
improved tumor-free and overall survival. CD1D transcriptional de-repression by all-trans retinoic acid re-
sults in further enhanced cytotoxicity of CAR19-iNKT cells against CD19+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.
Thus, iNKT cells are a highly efficient platform for CAR-based immunotherapy of lymphomas and possibly
other CD1d-expressing cancers.
INTRODUCTION
Despite impressive early clinical efficacy, application of chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell immunotherapy for B cell malig-
nancies is limited by disease relapse and tumor escape by
downregulation of the commonly targeted CD19 antigen (Nee-
lapu et al., 2017; Schuster et al., 2017). In addition, ability to
induce sustained complete remissions with a single infusion of
CAR-T cells and/or to exert a memory-like effect through long-
term persistence, which would induce second remission of re-
lapsing disease, are desirable but still not fully attained CAR-T
cell attributes (Brudno and Kochenderfer, 2018). Recent efforts
have focused on developing CAR targeting to tumor-associated
antigens (Ruella et al., 2016) and on editing the endogenous
T cell receptor (TCR) of the CAR-modified T cells (Eyquem
et al., 2017; Qasim et al., 2017) to mitigate induction of acute
graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), allowing the use of unre-
lated donor-derived, allogeneic CAR-T cells. However, this en-
tails additional genetic engineering that increases the complexity
of CAR-T cell manufacturing.
Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are rare but powerful immu-
noregulatory and effector T cells, playing a pivotal anti-tumor role
Significance
Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19)-T cell immunotherapy induces complete remissions in B cell lymphomas.
However, more than half of patients relapse, highlighting the need for improving the efficacy of CAR-based immunotherapy.
By exploiting the inherent biological properties of iNKT cells, we demonstrate that CAR19-iNKT cells exert a more powerful
anti-tumor effect against B cell malignancy compared with CAR19-T cells, underpinned by dual targeting of CD19 and CD1d
on target cells. This includes ability of CAR19-iNKT cells to eradicate brain tumors and to induce sustained second remis-
sions. Anti-tumor efficacy can be further enhanced by transcriptional modulation of CD1D. Thus, iNKT cells are a versatile
and effective platform for CAR immunotherapy of lymphoma and possibly of other cancers.

 (Bendelac et al., 2007; Exley et al., 2011; Salio et al., 2014). iNKT
cells are restricted by CD1d, a non-polymorphic, glycolipid-pre-
senting HLA I-like molecule expressed on B cells, antigen-pre-
senting cells (APCs), and some epithelial tissues (Exley et al.,
2000; Nickoloff et al., 1999). We and others have demonstrated
the ability of donor iNKT cells to protect from experimental and
clinical aGVHD in the context of allogeneic stem cell transplanta-
tion (Chaidos et al., 2012; Leveson-Gower et al., 2011; Rubio
et al., 2016; Schneidawind et al., 2014). We also previously found
co-expression of CD19 and CD1d in many subtypes of B cell lym-
phoma, including the incurable marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)
and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (Kotsianidis et al., 2011), while
in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the commonest he-
matologic malignancy, expression of CD1d is lower than in
normal B cells or absent (Gorini et al., 2017; Kotsianidis
et al., 2011).
We therefore hypothesized that equipping iNKT cells with
CAR19 would potentially achieve dual targeting of CD1d and
CD19, thus enhancing the overall anti-lymphoma effect. Given
the protective impact of allogeneic iNKT cells against human
aGVHD (Chaidos et al., 2012; Rubio et al., 2016), CAR-iNKT cells
could be developed from healthy donors for ‘‘off-the-shelf’’ use.
Previous work demonstrated the feasibility of CAR engineering
of iNKT cells and their pre-clinical activity against neuroblastoma
and CD1d�CD19+ B cell lymphoma lines but not patient-derived
lymphoma cells (Heczey et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2016). However,
in vivo anti-tumor response required repeated cell dosing and/or
adjuvant IL-2 administration (Heczey et al., 2014; Tian et al.,
2016). In addition, comparative analysis of CAR-T and -iNKT
cells and exploration of the relative contributions of CD1d-versus
CAR19-CD19-dependent interactions in CAR19-iNKT cell acti-
vation are lacking.
RESULTS
Optimized Protocol for Generation of Poly-functional
CAR-iNKT Cells
There is a dearth of information as to how best to CAR-engineer
iNKT cells. To determine optimal conditions for efficient lentiviral
CAR19 transduction and subsequent CAR19-iNKT cell expan-
sion, we tested four different protocols using second- (19-28-z)
or third-generation (19-28-OX40-z) CAR against CD19 (Fig-
ure S1A). In a stepwise approach (Figures S1B–S1E), conditions
tested include transduction of sorted iNKT cells upfront versus
post initial expansion in the presence of the iNKT cell agonist
alpha-galactosylceramide (aGalCer); activation and expansion
using
anti-CD3/CD28-mediated
stimulation
versus
CD1d-
expressing APC plus aGalCer. Through paired comparisons,
we first determined that upfront transduction of pre-selected
and not of pre-expanded iNKT cells results in the highest trans-
duction efficiency (protocol 3; Figures S1B–S1E) and next, use of
IL-15 but not of IL-2 during the CD3/CD28-based activation
phase and the first week post CAR19 transduction preserved
viability of iNKT cells (Figures S1B–S1E).
Overall, we found that the optimal approach (protocol 4),
comprising upfront selection and lentiviral CAR19 transduction
of CD3/CD28-activated iNKT cells in the presence of autologous
APC and IL-15, consistently generates highly transduced
and viable CAR-iNKT (and CAR-T) cells (Figures 1A and S1B–
S1E) and, over a period of 3 weeks, it results in significantly
higher expansion and absolute numbers of CAR19-iNKT than
CAR19-T cells (Figure 1B). This protocol is efficient irrespective
of the source of iNKT cells; i.e., fresh or frozen, normal donor,
or patient-derived lymphocytes (Figure S1F). Importantly, it
also ensures the preservation of the CD4– fraction of iNKT cells
(Figure S1G), which, compared with their CD4+ counterparts,
have a more polarized Th1 cytokine profile and express higher
levels of cytotoxic granules (Gumperz et al., 2002). Indeed, we
found that resting CD4– CAR19-iNKT cells express significantly
higher levels of perforin and granzyme B and, upon activation,
more granzyme B and interferon-g (IFNg) but less IL-4 than the
CD4+ subset (Figures 1C and S1H). Compared with their
CAR19-T counterparts, a higher proportion of CAR19-iNKT cells
express IFNg, perforin, and granzymes (Figure 1D) and a signif-
icantly higher proportion (40% versus <5%, p < 0.01) are tri-func-
tional; i.e., co-express these three molecules (Figures 1D–1F). Of
note also, while >20% of CAR19-T cells secreted none of the
above three molecules, the corresponding proportion for
CAR19-iNKT cells was <3%. Further, CAR19-iNKT cells secrete
higher levels of Th1/2 cytokines than CAR19-T cells over an 8 hr
period of activation (Figure 1G).
Co-operative Activation of CAR19-iNKT Cells
Next, we tested whether equipping iNKT cells with a CAR19 that
powerfully activates T cells when it engages CD19 would affect
the ability of iNKT cells to functionally interact with CD1d, the
sole restricting element of the iTCR (Brossay et al., 1998; Exley
et al., 1997; Nieda et al., 1999; Takahashi et al., 2000). For this

 purpose, we engineered the CD1d�CD19� K562 cells to express
CD1d and CD19 singly or in combination (Figure 2A). We found
that killing by CAR19-iNKT cells of CD1d+CD19�, CD1d�CD19+,
and CD1d+CD19+ targets proceeded incrementally (Figure 2B).
In the presence of aGalCer, a CD1d-presented glycolipid that
selectively activates iNKT cells, we observed further enhance-
ment of CAR19-iNKT cell cytotoxicity against CD1d+-only and
CD1d+CD19+
targets
but
not
against
CD1d�CD19�
and
CD1d�CD19+ targets (Figure 2C). We conclude that the expres-
sion and engagement of CAR19 does not affect the ability of
iNKT cells to be activated in the presence of CD1d, suggesting
preservation of the ability of CAR19-iNKT cells to be activated
through CD1d interaction. These findings also support the hy-
pothesis that dual targeting of CD1d and CD19 results in co-
operative killing of target cells and can be further enhanced by
the use of aGalCer, thus further underscoring the importance
of functional interaction of CAR19-iNKT cells with CD1d on
target cells.
Enhanced Short- and Long-Term Reactivity of CAR19-
iNKT Cells against B Lineage Malignancies
We next examined the short- and long-term in vitro reactivity of
CAR19-iNKT cells in a B lineage cell context. First, we confirmed
that CAR19-engineered iNKT cells are reactive against mature B
lineage cell lines in a manner proportional to the expression
levels of CD19 and CD1d (Figures S2A and S2B). We started dis-
secting the functional profile of CAR19-iNKT cells by comparing
the proliferative potential of second- and third-generation
CAR19-iNKT cells with their same-donor CAR19-T cell counter-
parts. Over a period of 3 weeks, we found a significantly higher
expansion and higher absolute numbers of CAR19-iNKT cells,
which were more striking for third-generation CAR (Figure 3A).
This was corroborated in real-time imaging of second- and
third-generation CAR19-iNKT versus CAR19-T cell proliferation

over a period of 7 days (Figure 3B).
In cytotoxicity assays, we found higher
reactivity
of
CAR19-iNKT
cells
than
CAR19-T effectors against the CD19+
CD1d+ double-positive C1R-CD1d cells and Farage lymphoma
cells, an effect that was further enhanced by aGalCer (Figure 3C).
These findings were extended in an assay in which proliferation
of effector cells (i.e., CAR19-T or CAR19-iNKT cells) and survival
of CD19+CD1d+ target cells were concomitantly imaged in real
time over a period of 7 days (Figures 3D and 3E). Indeed, the
cytotoxic and proliferative activity of CAR19-iNKT cells at an
effector-to-target (E/T) ratio of 1:1 was similar to those of
CAR19-T cells at an E/T ratio of 10:1, suggesting a functional
equivalence of CAR19-iNKT:CAR19-T of 10:1.
To better reflect the clinical context, we set up cytotoxicity as-
says using as targets primary CD19+CD1d+ lymphoma cells from
one patient with blastic variant of MCL and two patients with
MZL, which co-express CD1d and CD19 as we previously re-
ported (Kotsianidis et al., 2011) (Figure S3A). In six out of seven
assays involving three healthy donors, CAR19-iNKT cells were
more cytotoxic than CAR19-T cells (Figure 3F). Further charac-
terization of lymphoma cell killing by assessment of cell size
and 7-AAD retention (Figure S3B) confirmed superior killing by
CAR19-iNKT cells of all patient lymphoma cells (Figures S3C
and S3D). In these ‘‘same-tube’’ assays we also observed low
to no killing of monocytes (Figure S3E), which express higher
levels of CD1d than malignant B cells (Figure S3F) (Exley et al.,
2000) but not CD19, suggesting a low ‘‘on-target, off-tumor’’
reactivity of CAR19-iNKT cells.
Transcriptional and Epigenetic Basis for Enhancing
CAR-iNKT Cell Reactivity
As previously reported, we found that CLL cells express low or
no CD1d in comparison with normal B cells (Gorini et al., 2017;
Kotsianidis et al., 2011) (Figure S4A). We found that CAR19-
iNKT cells effectively killed CLL cells and their cytotoxicity
was further enhanced in the presence of aGalCer, suggesting
that dual targeting of CLL cells can be further enhanced by

 CD1d presentation of aGalCer despite the very low level of CD1d
expression (Figure S4B). Previous work reported transcriptional
regulation of CD1D expression in human B cells by the RARa
ligand all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (Allan et al., 2011). Accord-
ingly, we observed that CD1D mRNA and cell surface protein
expression increased in a time-dependent manner after treat-
ment with clinically relevant concentrations of ATRA (Figures
4A–4C and S4C–S4E) without affecting cell viability (Figure S4F).
Moreover, aGalCer-pre-loaded CLL cells were more effectively
killed by CAR19-iNKT cells than by CAR19-T cells (Figure 4D)
and, upon ATRA pre-treatment of CLL cells (Figure S4G), the
cytotoxic activity of CAR19-iNKT but not of CAR19-T cells
increased further (Figure 4D).
We dissected the epigenetic and transcriptional basis of CD1d
regulation in the U266 cell line as a paradigm of a B lineage ma-
lignant cell with transcriptional repression of CD1D expression
(Figure S4H). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and
re-ChIP assays we found enrichment of both H3K4me3-acti-
vating and H3K27me3-repressive histone marks at the CD1D
promoter (Figures 4E and 4F). Notably, a similar bivalent histone
state was observed in primary CLL cells (Figure S4I). In U266
cells we also demonstrated enrichment of the Ser5- but not
Ser2-phosphorylated form of RNA PolII (Figure 4G), consistent
with a bivalent, poised transcriptional state of CD1D. Impor-
tantly, histone bivalency at the CD1D promoter was associated
with high levels of RARa binding as well as of EZH2, the Poly-
comb complex methyl-transferase responsible for H3K27me3
marks (Simon and Kingston, 2009) (Figure 4H), with direct inter-
action of EZH2 and RARa (Figure 4I), suggesting a co-operative
transcriptional repressive function upon CD1D. In a pharmaco-
logical approach, although an EZH2 inhibitor had no discernible
effect on transcription and surface expression of CD1d, it co-
operatively enhanced the effect of ATRA on CD1d expression
(Figures 4J–4L). These findings provide the mechanistic basis
for developing CAR-iNKT cell immunotherapy in conjunction
with transcriptional and epigenetic manipulation of CD1D.
Enhanced In Vivo Anti-tumor Activity of CAR19-
iNKT Cells
We compared second-generation CAR19-iNKT versus CAR19-T
cells in a systemic in vivo model of CD1d+CD19+ B cell malig-
nancy (C1R-CD1d cells; Figure 5A) based on a single infusion
of immunotherapy in tumor-engrafted NSG mice and monitoring
with serial bioluminescence imaging of the tumor burden. Ani-
mals treated with unmodified T or iNKT cells had poorer survival
compared with mice receiving CAR-based immunotherapy (Fig-
ure 5B). However, compared with the CAR19-T cell-treated
group, the CAR19-iNKT cell-treated group displayed a signifi-
cantly improved overall (Figure 5B) and tumor-free survival (Fig-
ure 5C). This could be at least in part explained by a significantly
swifter decline of tumor burden observed within 3 days following
transfer of CAR19-iNKT cells (Figures 5D and 5E).
Since human T cells may induce aGVHD in xenograft models
(Alcantar-Orozco et al., 2013), we monitored body weight and
clinical aGVHD score (Cooke et al., 1996). We found that body
weight increased comparably in all experimental groups (Fig-
ure S5A), thus excluding the occurrence of clinically significant
aGVHD, which is associated with >10% loss of weight (Cooke
et al., 1996); in line with this, the aGVHD score, on a scale of
0–10, was 0 in all groups (Figure S5B).
CAR19-iNKT Cells Eradicate Intracranial and Relapsed
Disease
In the tumor model described herein, we observed enhanced
bioluminescence over the head even at the time of engraftment,
before commencement of immunotherapy. Correlation of biolu-
minescence with MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
and histologic analysis, suggested the presence of intracranial
meningeal, brain, and pituitary disease in most animals (Figures
S5C–S5E and Table S1). While brain lymphoma persisted
above the threshold of detection in all but one animal receiving
CAR19-T cells as well as in all untreated animals, they were elim-
inated in 13/18 CAR19-iNKT cell-treated animals (Figure 6A).
This would be consistent with CAR19-iNKT cells gaining entry
into the brain and effectively controlling brain disease. In all
tumor-only, T-, iNKT-, and CAR19-T cell-treated animals
(n = 32; i.e., 11/11, 7/7, 7/7, and 7/19 animals respectively), sys-
temic and brain lymphoma progressed without evidence of first
or, in the case of one CAR19-T cell-treated animal, second
remission. By contrast, in four CAR19-iNKT cell-treated mice, af-
ter initial clearance of systemic and brain lymphoma, relapse
developed primarily in the brain at a later stage (Figures 6B
and 6C) and in all four mice this relapsed disease eventually re-
gressed, leading to long-term survival (Figures 6B and 6C), a
finding consistent with persistence and ability for secondary
anti-tumor responses by CAR19-iNKT cells. Importantly, in
CAR19-T cell-treated animals with progressive brain disease
that died during the course of the experiment, histological

 analysis revealed both CD3+ and CD19+ cell infiltration (Fig-
ure S5F), suggesting failure of CAR19-T cells to control brain
lymphoma. The same analysis was performed in CAR19-iNKT
cell-treated animals at the time of primary endpoint; i.e., at termi-
nation of the experiment on day 90. At that time, neither CD3+ or
CD19+ cells were detected in the brains of the CAR19-iNKT cell-
treated animals, including those four achieving second remission
(Figure S5G), suggesting that they receded following eradication
of relapsed disease.
Closer analysis of the four CAR19-iNKT cell-treated relapsed
animals showed that both their total body and brain tumor
burden 3 days following immunotherapy were significantly
higher, by 2.8-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, than in the non-
relapsed CAR19-iNKT cell-treated animals, suggesting that fail-
ure to induce deep remission early post immunotherapy would
result in overt relapse (Figure 6D).
As well as through dual CD19 and CD1d targeting, achieve-
ment of remission of primary and relapsed brain disease in
CAR19-iNKT cell-treated animals might be related to enhanced
potential for chemotaxis toward the tumor cells and to enter
the brain. Previous work demonstrated that a much higher
expression of the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR4,
CCR5, CCR6, and CXCR3 by human iNKT cells than conven-
tional effector or memory T cells underpins the ability of iNKT
cells to migrate more effectively to peripheral, extra-lymphoid
tissues (Kim et al., 2002). Further, human iNKT cells can infiltrate
subcutaneous lymphoid tumors in NOD/SCID mice (Bagnara
et al., 2009). Consistent with the chemokine receptor repertoire
of human iNKT cells, transcriptome analysis of the CAR19-
iNKT and CAR19-T cells generated from the healthy donor
used in three out of the four animals with second brain lymphoma
remission showed that CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, CXCR3, and
CCR3 are also expressed at higher levels in CAR19-iNKT than
CAR19-T cells and only expression of CCR4 is modestly higher
in CAR19-T cells (Figures S6A–S6C). Further, analysis and com-
parison of the mRNA chemokine receptor pattern of murine iNKT
versus conventional T cells revealed a very similar pattern as in
their human counterparts (Figures S6D and S6E), highlighting
an evolutionary conserved potential of iNKT cells to migrate to
peripheral tissues.
To gain some insight into the potential of the lymphoma cells
used in our model to incite chemotaxis, we assessed chemokine
expression by transcriptome analysis of the parental C1R-CD1d
cells. We found that, with the exception of CCL2 (the CCR2
ligand), thelymphoma cells express thechemokinesCLL3 (ligand
for CCR1, CCR4, and CCR5), CCL5 (ligand for CCR1, CCR3, and
CCR5), CCL20 (ligand for CCR6), CCL22 (ligand for CCR4), and
CCL10 (ligand for CXCR3; Figures S6A and S6F). Of note, the
CCR6-CCL20 axis is a critical determinant for T cell migration
to the brain through the choroidal plexus (Sallusto et al., 2012).
Finally, entry of T cells into the brain through the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) requires that they express integrin a4b1 (VLA-4).
We found higher expression of the corresponding ITGA4 and
ITGB1 genes by CAR19-iNKT than by CAR19-T cells (Fig-
ure S6G) (Sallusto et al., 2012).
Based on the above and published data, we postulate that the
inherent chemotactic and migratory properties of CAR19-iNKT
cells contribute to their enhanced in vivo anti-lymphoma activity
and their potential to gain access to and eradicate primary or
relapsed brain disease.
DISCUSSION
Here, we exploit biological properties of iNKT cells to overcome
shortcomings of conventional CAR-T cells and enhance the po-
tential of CAR-based immunotherapy.
Our optimized protocol for CAR-iNKT cell production is unlike
other CAR-T or CAR-iNKT cell generation protocols in that a
‘‘scale-down’’ approach, entailing CAR modification of a rela-
tively small number of pre-selected iNKT cells (104–106 cells),
precedes the scaling-up phase. The described approach is
robust enough to deliver high-purity, clinical-scale cell product
within 3 weeks from a variety of iNKT cell sources, and it requires
a fraction of lentiviral supernatant used in conventional CAR
transduction protocols; as such, it would be expected to signif-
icantly curtail cost of CAR-iNKT cell production. With an average
expansion of >3,000-fold, starting with 2 3 105 purified iNKT
cells will generate in excess of 5 3 108 CAR19-iNKT cells, thus
covering cell doses of 1 3 106 to 5 3 106 cells/kg used in conven-
tional CAR19-T cell immunotherapy protocols (Brudno and Ko-
chenderfer, 2018). Whether a similar or even lower cell dosing
range will be required for optimal CAR19-iNKT cell clinical immu-
notherapy will be determined in future clinical trials.
Upfront transduction of selected iNKT cells and the subsequent
expansionofCAR19-iNKTcellsareanothertwo importantfeatures
that distinguish our approach from other protocols of CAR-iNKT

 generation that entail CAR transduction of pre-expanded iNKT
cells and use of IL-2 (Heczey et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2016). The
use of IL-15 is likely to have significantly contributed to the survival
and the robust, and sustained expansion of CAR19-iNKT cells. We
found that, compared with IL-2, IL-15 maintains higher levels of
iNKT cell viability during lentiviral transduction and during the first
week post transduction, a critical requirement for the subsequent
phase of expansion. Indeed, IL-15 has been shown to inhibit acti-
vation-induced cell death of T cells (Marks-Konczalik et al., 2000)
and to drive iNKT cell terminal effector-like differentiation as well
as expression of effector molecules such as granzymes and
IFNg by iNKT cells, while promoting cell survival through induction
of BCL2 family proteins (Gordy et al., 2011).
We provide direct evidence that iNKT cells retain functionality
of their endogenous iTCR-dependent activation in the presence
of CAR19-mediated activation, in a glycolipid- as well as CD1d-
dependent manner. The weaker iNKT cell-CD1d axis acts in a
co-operative manner with the stronger CAR19-CD19 axis for
iNKT
cell
activation.
Downstream
of
these
interactions,
CAR19-iNKT cells with a more robust proliferative, cytokine
secretion profile and enhanced cytotoxic activity outperform
same-donor CAR19-T cells.
Despite promising pre-clinical activity, the expectation that
third-generation CAR-T cells would lead to enhanced anti-tumor
effect has not materialized in pre-clinical or clinical studies so far
(Till et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2015). Our data shows that the pro-
liferative potential of third-generation CAR19-iNKT cells is
considerably better than that of CAR19-T cells, suggesting that
iNKT cells might provide an optimal platform for clinical develop-
ment of third-generation CARs. In particular, given the previously
reported requirement for the co-stimulatory OX40L-OX40 axis
for optimal iNKT cell-mediated anti-tumor responses (Zaini
et al., 2007; Zhou, 2007), the inclusion of OX40 in a third-gener-
ation CAR configuration might be advantageous.
In line with the dual targeting hypothesis, enhanced cytotoxic
effect of CAR-iNKT cells against B cell lines extends to include
primary CD1d+CD19+ MZL and MCL cells. Therefore, enhanced
anti-tumor reactivity of CAR-iNKT cells requires interaction of
CAR19-iNKT cells with CD1d on target cells. While it is possible
that this interaction also involves the iTCR, definitive delineation
of its direct role in the activation of CAR19-iNKT cells via interac-
tion with CD1d would require deletion of the iTCR.
In previous work involving NSG mice with humanized he-
matopoiesis, including myelopoiesis, anti-GD2 CAR-T but not
CAR-iNKT cells incited aGVHD (Heczey et al., 2014). Since xeno-
geneic aGVHD requires presence of human myeloid as well as of
T cells (Schroeder and DiPersio, 2011), it is likely that lack of clin-
ical aGVHD in our model was due to transfer to NSG mice solely
of highly purified CAR19-modified or unmodified T or iNKT cells.
Nevertheless, given the protective effect of allogeneic iNKT cells,
and in particular of the CD4� fraction, against aGVHD (Chaidos
et al., 2012; Rubio et al., 2016), effective CAR19-iNKT cell immu-
notherapy can in principle be delivered using iNKT cells sourced
from healthy donors. In this context, the consistent preservation
of the CD4– fraction of iNKT cells in our manufacturing protocol,
but not in others (Heczey et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2016), is another
important salient feature. Further, in contrast to current efforts to
delete the TCR of conventional CAR-T cells to abrogate TCR-
major histocompatibility complex interactions and thus reduce
the risk of aGVHD imparted by allogeneic CAR-T cells (Eyquem
et al., 2017; Qasim et al., 2017), CAR19-iNKT cells impart protec-
tion from aGVHD with their iTCR intact.
CAR19-T cell immunotherapy has been considerably less suc-
cessful in CLL (Mato et al., 2017) as compared with other B line-
age malignancies. Our work provides the cellular and molecular
rationale to employ CAR19-iNKT cells as a potentially more
effective immunotherapeutic approach for CLL. By dissecting
the epigenetic landscape that restricts transcription of CD1D in
CLL cells, namely transcriptional repression via a co-operative
effect of RARa and Polycomb complex, we define a clinically
applicable
pharmacological
approach
that
enhances
the
in vitro effect of CAR19-based immunotherapy against CLL cells.
Further enhancement of the anti-lymphoma effect could be im-
parted by the use of aGalCer, to which CAR19-iNKT cells remain
selectively
responsive,
resulting
in increased
cytolysis
of
CLL cells.
The potential toxicity of CAR-iNKT cell immunotherapy,
especially the ‘‘off-tumor, on-target’’ targeting of CD1d-ex-
pressing cells, will eventually be determined in clinical trials.
However, we found that CAR19-iNKT cell cytotoxicity against
monocytes, the highest CD1d-expressing blood cells, is very
low and comparable with that of CAR-T cells. Although the
mechanism
of
differential
CD1d-dependent
reactivity
of
CAR19-iNKT cells against monocytes and lymphoma B cells re-
mains to be determined, it may reflect the differential endoge-
nous glycolipid repertoire presented by CD1d in each cell
type (Metelitsa et al., 2001). Previous work showed that normal
CD14+ monocytes within peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) do not activate autologous iNKT cells (Bosma et al.,
2012), and human primary B cells incite considerably lower
iNKT cell reactivity than autologous lymphoma B cells (Webb
et al., 2016), suggesting that CD1d+ primary non-malignant

 cells are less sensitive than malignant cells to iNKT cell
reactivity.
Since normal B cells express both CD1d and CD19, B cell
aplasia, as is the case with CAR19-T cells, will also be expected
to develop with CAR19-iNKT cell immunotherapy. Of note,
adoptive transfer to patients with cancer of in vitro expanded,
autologous iNKT cells resulted in no more than grade 2 toxicity
(Exley et al., 2017).
In concordance with the in vitro findings, our in vivo model of
CD1d+CD19+ B lineage malignancy clearly demonstrated the
enhanced anti-tumor effect of CAR19-iNKT over CAR-T cells in
terms of both tumor-free and overall survival. This effect is asso-
ciated with a significantly more robust anti-tumor effect in the
first few days post immunotherapy, perhaps a reflection of the
physiological role of iNKT cells as the immune cells that modu-
late an emerging immune response well before conventional
T cells (Brigl et al., 2003). It is likely that the combination of swift
responses against two tumor-associated targets (i.e., CD19 and
CD1d) will induce deeper responses, will limit immune escape
associated with loss of the CAR target, and will eventually curtail
disease relapse. Highlighting further the importance of early
deep remissions, CAR19-iNKT cell-treated animals with the
highest tumor burden early following immunotherapy subse-
quently relapsed, although eventually a second remission was
seen in all four animals. This is consistent with the observation
that sustained long-term remissions in patients with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with CAR19-T cell immu-
notherapy are primarily achieved in those with early complete re-
missions (Brudno and Kochenderfer, 2018; Park et al., 2018).
In previous work (Heczey et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2016), anti-
tumor activity of CAR-iNKT cells required either repeated cell
dosing (neuroblastoma) or adjuvant administration of IL-2
(CD19+CD1d– lymphoma), implying a reduced in vivo fitness of
CAR-iNKT cells. This contrasts with our findings that a single
dose of CAR19-iNKT is sufficient for a drastic anti-lymphoma ef-
fect. While the reasons for these differences are not clear, they
might be related to differences in the manufacturing process dis-
cussed above.
While CAR19-T cells failed to control brain disease, which in
most cases was the cause of death, CAR19-iNKT cells almost
uniformly eradicated established tumors, implying ability to
access the brain. Based on the analysis of the expressed che-
mokine and corresponding chemokine receptor repertoire in tu-
mor and effectors cells and on published observations (Kim
et al., 2002), we postulate that CAR19-iNKT cells gain access
to the brain through the BBB and the choroidal plexus and
migrate toward the tumor cells. Consistent with this, previous
work demonstrated the ability of human iNKT cells to infiltrate
subcutaneous lymphoid tumors in NOD/SCID mice (Bagnara
et al., 2009).
While a significantly higher disease burden, including in the
brain, 3 days after immunotherapy might have underpinned
disease relapse in 4 CAR19-iNKT cell-treated animals, the
mechanism of subsequent complete regression of relapsed
brain disease remains to be defined and it will be an important
focus for further investigation. Previous work demonstrated
that, determined by the CDR3b region of the Vb11 chain of the
iTCR, human iNKT cells differ widely in terms of iTCR binding af-
finity to CD1d and its ability to incite proliferation, IFNg secretion,
and cytotoxic activity against CD1d+ targets (Matulis et al.,
2010). We speculate that such highly active and fitter CAR19-
iNKT cells were at low frequency at the beginning of the experi-
ment and, by selectively surviving, were more effective against
the relapsing primary tumor. In contrast to CAR19-T cells, which
surrounded and failed to control progressing brain lymphoma,
we did not observe CAR19-iNKT cell infiltration of the brain tis-
sue; it is possible that such infiltration receded by the time histo-
logical analysis was performed several weeks after clearance of
relapsed disease.
Overall, these findings provide the impetus for further develop-
ment of iNKT cell-based immunotherapy for other types of brain
cancers as well as brain lymphoma.
Our in vitro work using CD19+CD1d� targets suggests that
CAR19-iNKT would also be effective against CD19+CD1d�
B cell malignancies, thus extending the application of CAR-
iNKT cell technology to the entire spectrum of B lineage tumors.
At the progenitor end of the spectrum, this, as well as common
ALL, could also include the adverse prognosis MLL-rearranged
CD19+CD1d+ ALL (Fais et al., 2005), while, at the mature end of
the spectrum, multiple myeloma (MM), a cancer of plasma cells
that we previously showed to express CD1d (Spanoudakis
et al., 2009), could be targeted by CAR-iNKT cells. In the case
of MM, anti-BCMA CAR immunotherapy has shown promising
early clinical efficacy (Rotolo et al., 2016) and thus we envisage
that CAR-BCMA-iNKT cells would further improve the prospects
of effective immunotherapy against this incurable blood cancer.
In summary, we provide the mechanistic cellular and molecu-
lar rationale for developing iNKT cells as a more effective and
versatile platform than conventional T cells for CAR-based
immunotherapy against CD1d+ B lineage malignancies. Since

immunotherapy. In three mice, a second complete remission was documented by BLI. In the fourth mouse, a partial remission could be documented, due to
restricted access to the IVIS instrument from day 70 (+59 post immunotherapy [itx]) (x). However, all mice survived until the end of the experiment with no clinical
signs of tumor progression as assessed postmortem by fluorescence imaging, flow cytometry, or immunohistochemistry (not shown).
xIn four and seven CAR19-T and CAR19-iNKT-treated animals, respectively, tumor burden could not be monitored by BLI from day 70 (+59 post itx) due to
restricted access to the IVIS instrument. However, all mice were maintained in the study until achievement of survival endpoint or the end of the experiment.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Primary Cells
Healthy volunteer peripheral blood (PB) and lymphapheresis samples as well as PB samples from mantle cell lymphoma (MCL),
marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients were obtained after written informed consent
and research ethics committee approval (Research Ethics Committee reference: 11/H0308/9). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and were used as a source of either CD3+ lymphoid cells for CAR engineer-
ing or CD19+ tumor cell targets for functional assays. In order to generate CAR iNKT cells, TCRVa24Ja18+ lymphocytes were immu-
nomagnetically purified from PBMC and apheresis mononuclear cells using anti-human iNKT cell microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Primary cells were maintained in RPMI1640, 10% FBS, 2% glutamine, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate; 1% essen-
tial and non-essential aminoacids, 10 mM Hepes buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5.5x10-5 M beta-mercaptoethanol (Gibco�, Life Tech-
nologies). For CD3+ cells, human IL2 and/or IL-15 (premium grade, Miltenyi Biotec) were added at 100-200 IU/ml unless otherwise
stated.
Systemic Xenograft Tumor Model
Six-week old NOD/SCID/IL-2Rg-null (NSG) sex-matched mice were handled in accordance with the 1986 Animal Scientific
Procedures Act and under a United Kingdom Government Home Office–approved project licence 70/8586. The animals were housed
at the Hammersmith Central Biomedical Services (CBS) facility, Imperial College London. On day 0 all animals received 5 3 106 lucif-
erase-expressing C1R-CD1d cells by tail vein (iv) injection, followed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) monitoring twice a week.
Upon confirmation of engraftment, defined on the basis of increased photon signal in two consecutive scans performed 72 hr apart,
on day 11 the mice were randomized to no treatment or immunotherapy with either T, iNKT, 2nd generation CAR19-T or 2nd generation
CAR19-iNKT cells generated from the same donor. Thereafter, BLI was performed twice a week until day 21 and weekly until the end
of experiment on day 90. Primary endpoints were overall survival and tumor-free survival. Secondary endpoint was brain tumor-free
survival. All mice were sacrificed according to protocol when either experimental or humane endpoints were reached.
Cell Lines
The adherent Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (Lenti-X-293T) cells were purchased from Clontech and used for lentivirus production.
Lenti-X-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 10% Fetal
Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-Glutamine and 10 ml/L Penicillin-Streptomycin (Stem Cell Technologies). The K562
cells were obtained from ATCC, while the ARH-77, KMS-12-BM, NCI-H929 and U266 cell lines were purchased from DSMZ. C1R
and C1R-CD1d cell lines were provided by Prof Cerundolo (Medical Research Council (MRC) Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall
Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford). The Farage cell line was kindly donated by Prof Ronald Gartenhaus
(University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD USA). All suspension cell lines were grown in RPMI-1640 medium
(Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10-20% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-Glutamine and 10 ml/L Penicillin-
Streptomycin (Stem Cell Technologies).
All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). The K562, C1R
and ARH-77 cell lines were transduced to express the human CD19 and/or CD1d. For the purposes of in vitro functional assays,
ARH-77 cells were also modified with the pHR-SIN plasmid described above to co-express the mCherry red fluorescent protein
together with CD1d+. The C1R-CD1d cell line was modified with the luciferase-tdRFP plasmid for in vitro and in vivo monitoring
by fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging (BLI) respectively.
METHOD DETAILS
Vectors and Constructs
To generate CD19-specific CAR iNKT and T cells, a 2nd generation 19-IgGFc-CD28z and 3rd generation 19-IgGFc-CD28OX40z
CAR constructs with FMC63-derived scFv (Almasbak et al., 2015) were kindly donated by Dr Martin Pule, University College
London. To protect CAR-expressing cells from in vivo opsonisation (Almasbak et al., 2015), the original IgGFc-derived spacers
were modified by removing the CH2 and CH3 extracellular domains and the resulting new constructs were re-cloned into pSew len-
tiviral vector via overlapping PCR using Gibson assay (New England Biolabs). The primer pairs used were: 2nd generation CAR

 AGGAGGC. The modular structure is provided in Figure S1A. The RQR8 marker/suicide (Philip et al., 2014) gene was maintained
upstream of the CARs with an intervening FMD-2A peptide to allow early detection of CAR-transduced cells as previously described
(Philip et al., 2014). To generate CD19 and CD1d single- or double-expressing -cells, two sequences encoding for the human CD19
and CD1d, obtained from Dr Martin Pule and Prof Vincenzo Cerundolo, University of Oxford, respectively, were cloned singly or
together with an interposed FMD2A fragment into a retroviral SFG vector. For the purposes of real-time in vitro monitoring of CAR
cell cytotoxic activity, mCherry-labeled CD1d+ B cell targets were generated by using a lentiviral pHR-SIN plasmid encoding for a
hCD1d-mCherry fusion protein (Prof Vincenzo Cerundolo). To detect tumor cells and monitor tumor growth in vivo, firefly luciferase
was co-expressed with tandem dimer Tomato red fluorescent protein (tdRFP) in a single SFG vector as previously described (Whild-
ing et al., 2017).
Pharmacologic Agents
a-galactosylceramide (KRN7000, Cambridge Bioscience), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, Sigma-Aldrich) and the EZH2 inhibitor
GSK343 (Sigma-Aldrich) were purchased in lyophilized form. Stock solutions were prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
at 1 mg/ml (0.001 M), 3 mg/ml (0.01 M), 15 mg/ml (0.03 M) respectively. The DMSO solution of a-galactosylceramide (aGalCer)
was completely dissolved by heating at 80� for 1 hr, aliquoted and stored at -20�C until use. Prior to use, a working solution was pre-
pared by heating for another 60 seconds at 80�C, followed by dilution in PBS at 100 mg/ml (1000x). ATRA and GSK343 were used to
assess the transcriptional regulation of CD1d in primary CLL cells and the U266 cell line. The ATRA solution in DMSO was freshly
prepared before each experiment protected from light and diluted in PBS to 1 mM (1000X) for immediate use. The GSK343 stock
solution was stored at -20�C and diluted in PBS to 1 mM (1000x) prior to use. CLL cells were treated with 10-6 M ATRA. The
U266 cells were harvested during their exponential growth and treated with either 10-6 M ATRA or 10-6M GSK343 or a combination
of both. 0.01% DMSO was used as control. In all cases, the cells were incubated for up to 96 hr before proceeding to RT-PCR, flow
cytometry and ChIP/re-ChIP assays at the indicated time points.
Retroviral and Lentiviral Vector Constructs, Viral Production and Transduction
VSV-G pseudotyped retroviruses and lentiviruses were generated by transfection of 80% confluent Lenti-X-293T cells with the trans-
fer, packaging and envelope plasmids using the CaCl2 method (Kutner et al., 2009). pCMV-Gag-Pol and pVSV-G were used for retro-
virus, or pRsv-REV, pMDlg-pRRE and pMD2G were used for lentivirus respectively. Virus supernatant was harvested at 48 and 72 hr
post transfection, centrifuged and filtered through a 0.45 mm cellulose acetate filter, concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 23,000 3 g
4�C for 120 min and re-suspended with 1 3 RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lines were transduced with retrovirus in the
presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Two days later, transduction efficiency was determined by flow cytometry as per-
centage of CD19+ and/or CD1d+ cells or tdRFP+ cells. Where required, positive cells were sorted by immuno-magnetic selection
or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and further expanded in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum
(FBS, Gibco) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Pen/Strep, Stem Cell Technologies) (standard culture medium). To generate CAR-en-
gineered T cells, mononuclear cells were activated with Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 (Gibco�) at 1:1 beads-to-cell ra-
tio in complete cell medium prepared as described above, supplemented with IL-15 (Miltenyi Biotec). Activated T were transduced
and expanded as reported below for iNKT cells.
Generation of CAR19-iNKT Cells as per Protocol 4
TCRVa24Ja18+ lymphocytes were immunomagnetically sorted from PBMC or apheresis mononuclear cells using anti-human iNKT
cell microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified iNKT cells were seeded in round-bottom 96-wells at 1:1 ratio with irradiated (3500 rad)
autologous mononuclear cells (iAPC) and activated with Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 (Gibco�) at 1:1 beads-to-cell
ratio in T cell medium at a density of 1-5 x 104 cells per ml. IL-15 (Miltenyi Biotec) at 30 IU/ml and 150 IU/ml was added at the
time of seeding and 12 hr later respectively. Within 24-48 hr, activated iNKT cells were transduced with concentrated CAR lentivirus
using an MOI of 2-5 in the presence of 4 mg/ml polybrene, with spinoculation for 90 min at 1000G. After 8-12 hr, cells were resus-
pended in fresh medium supplemented with 150 IU/ml of IL-15 and let rest for 2 to 4 days before assessment for viability and
CAR expression. Transduction efficiency was determined by flow cytometry as percentage of RQR8+ cells relative to untransduced
controls as previously described (Philip et al., 2014). Where required, CAR+ cells were immunomagnetically sorted by using anti-
CD34-microbeads (Miltenyi), re-plated as above and re-stimulated with 1:1 irradiated C1R-CD1d cells, IL-15 (30 IU/ml) and aGalCer
(100 ng/ml), with additional 150 IU/ml of IL-15 12-24 hr later. After 7 days cells were counted, assessed for purity by flow cytometry
using a F(ab’)2-Goat anti-Mouse antibody (Invitrogen) and switched to a low IL-15 (down to 20 IU/ml) medium for additional 7 days
towards resting phase prior to functional studies. Alternatively, CAR19-iNKT cells were propagated with IL-15 (100 IU/ml) every other
day for up to 4-6 days, harvested during exponential growth phase, cryopreserved in 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen un-
til use.
Antibodies and Intracellular Staining
CAR+ cells were identified by using the mouse anti-human APC-CD34 (QBend10, R&D Systems) or FITC-CD34 (QBend10, Abcam)
monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against the RQR8 marker or the goat anti-mouse FITC-F(ab’)2 fragment (InvitrogenTM) against the CAR
hinge. For T cell phenotyping, the following antibodies were used: mouse anti-human PerCP-Cy5.5-CD3 (OKT3, eBioscience), Pe-
Cy7-CD8 (RPA-T8, eBioscience) and eFluor450-CD4 (OKT4, eBioscience). iNKT cells were defined as TCRVa24+, TCRVb11+,
Cancer Cell 34, 596–610.e1–e11, October 8, 2018
e7
 TCRVa24Ja18+ T cells using mouse anti-human PE-TCRVa24 (C15, Beckman Coulter), APC-TCRVb11 (C21, Beckman Coulter), or
FITC-TCRVa24Ja18+ (6B11, BD) pairwise combinations. Either a minimum of 0.5 x106 CD3+ cells or 200 iNKT cells were recorded to
facilitate accurate calculation of the total, CD4+ and CD4� iNKT cell frequencies. The B cell panel included the mouse anti-human
BV421-CD19 (HIB19, BD Biosciences), APC-CD1d (51.1, Biolegend), PerCP-eFluor710-CD5 (UCHT2, eBioscience), APC-
eFluor780-CD3 (OKT3, eBioscience). 4’,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining was used to exclude
dead cells. For intracellular cytokine profiling, T cells were fixed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus kit as per the
recommendation of the manufacturer, followed by staining with mouse anti-human eFluor450-CD3 (UCHT1, eBioscience),
PerCP-eFluor710-CD4 (SK3, eBioscience), BUV395-CD8a (RPA-T8, eBioscience), FITC-Perforin (d-G9, eBioscience and B-D48,
2BScientific), PE-GranzymeB (GB11, eBioscience), APC-IFNg (4S.B3, eBioscience), PE-IL-2 (MQ1-17H12, eBioscience), PeCy7-
IL-4 (8D4-8, eBioscience) and APC-eFluor780-IL17A (eBio64DEC17, eBioscience). Cytokine profile was assessed in resting cells
and upon stimulation for 4 hr with Dynabeads (1:1) or PMA/ionomycin (eBioscience) or C1R CD1d cells (1:1) in the presence of Mon-
ensin and Brefeldin (eBioscience).
Multiplex Cytokine Quantification Assays
CAR-modified cells were stimulated for 3 and 8 hr with Dynabeads at 1:1 ratio. Supernatants were collected and analyzed with a
Human ProcartaPlex immunoassay (Invitrogen) using the Luminex assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Proliferation Assays
Up to 104 irradiated C1R-CD1d cells were plated in poly-L-ornithine-coated, flat-bottom 96-well microplates. Where required,
aGalCer or vehicle were added for 4 hr before the addition of up to 104 CAR-modified cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep and 20 IU ml�1 IL-15. The cell plate was maintained at 37�C and 5% CO2 into the IncuCyte ZOOM�
instrument (Sartorius) for up to one week without any further manipulation. CAR cell proliferation was determined by the IncuCyte�
software, with a 24 hr scanning scheduled for every 1 hr with 10x or 4x objectives and using the confluence algorithm according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (EssenBio protocol 8000-0331-A00).
In Vitro Real-Time Monitoring of CAR Cell Cytotoxic Activity
CD1d-mCherry-transduced ARH-77 cells were seeded in a 96-well round-bottom ultra-low attachment (ULA) microplate (Corning)
with standard culture medium at a density of 500 cells/well and let settle for 1 hr. Effector cells were then re-suspended in standard
medium with 20 IU ml�1 IL-15 and added at the indicated ratio in triplicates. Wells with targets alone and effectors were included as
controls. The microplate was maintained at 37�C and 5%CO2 into the IncuCyte ZOOM� instrument for up to one week without any
further manipulation and scanned using a phase and a red channel every 1 hr with 10x objective during the first 48 hr and 4x objective
from day 3 until the end of the experiment. Targets cells were monitored as red fluorescent objects and quantified with IncuCyte�
software by using red mean image fluorescence (MIF) and red fluorescence area (mm2/image) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (EssenBio protocol 8000-0330-B00). CAR cell proliferation was determined as described in the paragraph ‘Long-term
proliferation assay’.
Cytotoxicity Assays
CellTrace� Violet (Invitrogen)-labeled targets were incubated at the indicated ratios with effector cells for 3 hours. Where required,
targets were labeled with an antibody mix containing PeCy7-conjugated mouse anti-human CD3 (OKT3, Biolegend), CD56 (5.1H11,
Biolegend), CD11b (ICRF44, Biolegend), CD14 (HCD14, Biolegend) and CD16 (B73.1, Biolegend) mAbs to allow discrimination be-
tween CD19+ and CD19- mononuclear cells. As controls, targets and effectors alone were simultaneously incubated to determine
spontaneous cell death. Where indicated, targets were pre-incubated with aGalCer or vehicle at 37�C for 4 hr before addition of
the effector cells. Cells were then harvested and 7-AAD was added prior to flow cytometric analysis on BD Fortessa Flow Cytometer,
using BD FACSDiva software version 6.0. Specific cytotoxic activity was determined as ((% sample (7-AAD+, Violet+) � % sponta-
neous (7-AAD+, Violet+)) / (100 - %spontaneous (7-AAD+, Violet+)) x 100. All assays were run in duplicates or triplicates. Data analysis
was performed using FlowJo 10.2.
Gene Expression Analysis
Total RNA from primary CLL cells and U266 cell line was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey Nagel), followed by cDNA
synthesis with RevertAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. For gene
expression quantification, RQ-PCR of template cDNA was performed in triplicate on StepOnePlus� Real-Time PCR System using
Taqman Gene Expression Master Mix and Assays (Applied Biosystems). CD1d transcript levels were determined relative to the refer-
ence genes ACTB and GAPDH, using the DDCT method. Taqman probes were CD1D Hs00939888_m1, ACTB Hs99999903_m1 and
GAPDH Hs03929097_g1.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-RQ-PCR) was per-
formed for anti-H3K4me3, anti-H3K27me3, anti-RNA polymerase II CTD phospho Ser2, anti-RNA polymerase II CTD phospho
Ser5, anti-EZH2, anti-RARa and control IgG as previously described (Caputo et al., 2013). For Re-ChIP assays, the wash and
e8
Cancer Cell 34, 596–610.e1–e11, October 8, 2018
 chromatin elution steps of the first IP were performed with protease inhibitor-containing buffers and the first elution was performed by
incubating the magnetic beads in 10 mM DTT/TE for 30 min at 37�C. The eluate of the first IP was diluted at least 20X in ChIP dilution
buffer, followed by a second IP according to the same protocol as above. Expression of immunoprecipitated DNA was calculated,
either relative to input DNA or DNA immunoprecipitated by control IgG antibody, using the DDCT method.
ChIP Primers
For the experiments with U266 cells, ChIP primers were designed to analyze the upstream regulatory element of the CD1D gene,
approximately 1.5kb from the ATG translational start site, consistent with the reported location of the RARE (Chen and Ross,
2007). As controls, the upstream regulatory regions of HOXA2, a putative target of polycomb mediated repression, known to be
marked by bivalent histone modifications, and GAPDH, as transcriptionally active housekeeping gene, were also evaluated. The
primer sequences pairs used were: CD1D 5-CCCTGAGAAAGTGACCTTGG and 5’-TGGCTGTTAGCTTTCAGTTCC, GAPDH
5’-CCGGGAGAAGCTGAGTCATG and 5-TTTGCGGTGGAAATGTCCTT, HOXA2 5’-AGGAAAGATTTTGGTTGGGAAG and 5’-AAAAA
GAGGGAAAGGGACAGAC. For the experiments with primary CLL cells, 3 primer sets were designed to analyze 2 regions upstream
the ATG start codon at -3047 (distal, DP) and -1240 (proximal, PP) and 1 region within exon 2 at +382 (I2P). The corresponding se-
quences were: DP 5’-TGGACGTCCGAGAGGTAAGAG and 5’-CACAGTAACCTGGAGATCCACTA, PP 5’-AATGATGCTGGGGTGT
GAGG and 5’-GCACGGCCTGCAAGATTATG, I2P 5’-CTCCAGATCTCGTCCTTCGC 5’-CTGGGACCAAGGCTTCAGAG.
Systemic Xenograft Tumor Model
On day 0, six-week old NOD/SCID/IL-2Rg-null (NSG) sex-matched mice received 5 3 106 luciferase-expressing C1R-CD1d cells by
tail vein (iv) injection, followed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) monitoring twice a week. Upon confirmation of engraftment, defined
on the basis of increased photon signal in two consecutive scans performed 72 hr apart, on day 11 the mice were randomized to no
treatment or immunotherapy with either T, iNKT, 2nd generation CAR19-T or 2nd generation CAR19-iNKT cells generated from the
same donor. Thereafter, BLI was performed twice a week until day 21 and weekly until the end of experiment on day 90. Primary
endpoints were overall survival and tumor-free survival. Secondary endpoints were acute Graft-versus-Host disease (aGvHD) and
brain tumor-free survival. aGvHD was assessed at least twice a week by means of a five-parameters scoring system incorporating
non-tumor related weight loss greater than 10%, hunched posture, reduced activity, raffled fur and scaling skin, as previously
described (Cooke et al., 1996). Specifically, each criterion was graded from 0 to 2 according to severity and finally a clinical aGvHD
score (min 0 = no GvHD, max 10 = severe aGvHD) was obtained. All mice were sacrificed according to protocol when either exper-
imental or humane endpoints were reached.
Bioluminescence Imaging (BLI)
Bioluminescence images were collected on an IVIS Lumina XR III Imaging System using Living Image software (PerkinElmer). Before
imaging, mice were anesthetized and maintained under inhalational anesthesia via a nose cone with 2% isoflurane (Zoetis UK)/med-
ical oxygen. All mice received a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 150 mg/Kg D-luciferin (Goldbio) in PBS 10 min before scanning.
Up to three mice were imaged simultaneously in a 12.5 cm field of view (FOV) with minimum target count of 30,000 and exposure
times ranging from 0.5 to 2 min at medium binning, with additional images acquired at low binning levels to maximize sensitivity
and spatial resolution where required. Both ventral and dorsal scans were acquired for each mouse. The dorsal and ventral signals
were quantitated separately through region of interest (ROI) analysis using Living Image software and expressed in radiance (unit of
photons/s/cm2/sr) as a total signal summation normalized to the ROI area. Where required, normalized background signal from simi-
larly sized ROIs was subtracted.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MR Spectroscopy (MRS)
Brain tumors were assessed and monitored with MRI and MRS in 12 animals. All MRI scans were performed on a pre-clinical 9.4 T
scanner (94/20 USR Bruker BioSpec; Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany) housed at the Biological Imaging Centre, Imperial College
London. Mice were anesthetized as described above and positioned prone in a dedicated mouse bed provided with a circulating
warm water heat mat to control body temperature. Respiration and body temperature were continuously monitored (1030-MR,
SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY, USA) and the amount of isoflurane and heat delivered were adjusted through the MRI scans to
maintain the respiratory rate within the range of 35-45 breaths per min and the body temperature at 36.5�C. Brain images were
acquired with Paravision 6.01 (Bruker, BioSpin) using an 86 mm inner diameter volume transmit quadrature coil combined with an
actively decoupled mouse brain array receiver. The imaging datasets consisted of T1 weighted FLASH and T2 weighted RARE
sequences in sagittal, axial and coronal orientation obtained within 10 min and 25 min respectively after iv injection of Gadovist (Ga-
dobutrol, Bayer). The contrast agent was diluted in 0.9% saline and used at a concentration of 0.3 mmol/kg in all but 1 mouse. For T1
FLASH images the following settings were applied: T1 sagittal: TR/TE = 250/2.6 ms; FOV = (18 x 14) mm2, in plane spatial resolution
(58 x 56) mm2, slice thickness 500 mm, 10 mm slice gap, 20 slices, scan time 6 min 30 s; T1 axial: TR/TE=320/2.6 ms; FOV = (16 x 14)
mm2, in plane spatial resolution (62 x 61) mm2, slice thickness 500 mm, 10 mm slice gap, 30 slices, scan time 6 min 30 s, T1 coronal: TR/
TE = 200/3 ms, FOV = (14 x x16) mm2, in plane resolution (34 x 62) mm2, 500 mm slice thickness, slice gap 50 mm, 10 slices. Scan time
3 min 50 s. T2 RARE images were generated with: T2 sagittal: TR/TE = 3000/40 ms, FOV = (18 x 14) mm2, in plane spatial resolution
(70 x 55) mm2, slice thickness 500 mm, 10 mm slice gap, 20 slices, scan time 5 min. T2 axial: TR/TE = 2500/45 ms, FOV = (14 x 14) mm2,
in plane resolution (55 x 55) mm2, 700 mm slice thickness, slice gap 50 mm, 12 slices. Scan time 4 min. T2 coronal: TR/TE = 3600/40 ms,

 FOV = (18 x 14) mm2, in plane spatial resolution (70 x 55) mm2, slice thickness 500 mm, 10 mm slice gap, 30 slices, scan time 6 min. All
images were analyzed using OsiriX software. Image quality and contrast enhancement were determined based on assessment of
contrast-to-noise ratio between the areas of clinical relevance (regions of interests (ROI) with higher signal intensity, SA) and
same-size, reference areas with no evidence gadolinium uptake (ROI with lower signal intensity, SB), scaled to image noise, accord-
ing to the following formula: CNR = j SA – SB j / so, where so is the standard deviation of the pure image noise. For MRS, the voxel was
positioned within the pituitary gland avoiding inclusion of surrounding tissue. Field-map based shimming (up to 4th order) was per-
formed prior to the MRS acquisition to optimize the main field homogeneity in the voxel of interest. Single voxel spectra (SVS) were
acquired at both long and short echo times (LTE and STE respectively), with: LTE PRESS: TR/TE = 2500/100 ms, voxel size (2 x 1.2 x
1.35) mm3, total scan time 13 min 20 s; STE STEAM: 2500/3 ms, voxel size (2 x 1.2 x 1.35) mm3, total scan time 13 min 20 s. Relative
quantification of Creatine/NAA, Choline/NAA ratios was computed from the LTE spectra. The spectra were pre-processed (phased,
apodized) and quantified afterwards using AMARES (jMRUI software).
Histologic Analysis
Mouse tissues were fixed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin for up to 36hr. Animal heads underwent additional treatment with aceto-
zinc formalin for 12 hr and Gooding and Stewart’s decalcification fluid for 8.5 hr prior to further processing. All samples were then
processed on a Tissue Tek Sakura VIP 5. Blocks were embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned on Polysine coated slides at
1 mm (organs) or 2 mm (heads). Tissue sections were stained either with Haematoxylin and Eosin using a Leica ST5020 autostainer
or anti-human CD19 and CD3 primary antibodies using a Leica DAB polymer staining kit on a Leica Bond III staining platform. Stained
sections were viewed and images acquired using an EVOS XL Imaging System (ThermoFisher Scientific).
RNA-sequencing and Analysis
Total RNA was isolated from resting CAR19-iNKT and -T cells by using NucleoSpin� RNA (Macherey-Nagel) omitting carrier RNA.
Treatment with DNAse I was performed to remove all traces of DNA. Total RNA concentration was measured using Qubit� RNA HS
Assay Kit on a Qubit� 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), whereas RNA integrity was assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer
RNA 6000 Pico Chip. Next, RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using NEBNext� Ultra� II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit
for Illumina with rRNA depletion (NEB #E7760S/L), according to the manufacturer‘s protocol, applying the algorithm for intact
RNA (RIN >7). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq4000 sequencer to obtain 75bp paired-end reads. Base calling
and demultiplexing and conversion to fastq file were performed using the ‘Real Time Analysis’ (RTA) and bcl2fastq2 v2.18 illumina
software respectively. Reads were subsequently mapped onto the Genome Reference Consortium Human genome build 38
(GRCh38) using STAR (version 2.5.3a)(Dobin et al., 2013) with a threshold of 10,000 alignments per read (command: –alignTranscript-
sPerReadNmax 100000), allowing generation of chimeric outputs for downstream analysis. Processing of large reads files was
completed by further increasing the STAR limits (command: –limitGenomeGenerateRAM 20000000000). Raw counts were obtained
by using the ‘Rsubread’ v1.24.2 Bio-conductor package (Liao et al., 2013). Normalisation analysis was carried out using the ‘edgeR’
v3.20.9 Bio-conductor package (Robinson et al., 2010).
For RNA-seq of C1R-CD1d parental cells, the same procedures were followed, except for the fact that libraries were prepared
.using the NEBNext poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module and the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (New Engand
Biolabs) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to obtain paired-end 100bp reads. Reads obtained from parental C1R-
CD1d RNA-seq experiments were aligned using TopHat (v2.0.14) (Kim et al., 2013) against the Hg19 human reference genome using
the default settings. ‘Cuffdiff’ part of the Cufflinks package (Trapnell et al., 2010) was used for data normalization.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Sample Size
In vitro assays were planned to achieve at least 3 biological replicates per set of experiments. For in vivo experiments, sample size
was determined to show a 30% survival improvement in CAR19-iNKT vs CAR19-T -treated animals at 5% significance and
80% power.
Replicates
The in vitro data were reproduced in technical duplicates or triplicates using samples from different donors and lymphoma patients as
a source of CAR-engineered and target cells respectively. For in vivo studies, to show enhanced anti-lymphoma activity of CAR19-
iNKT compared to CAR19-T cells, after completing two pilot experiments, two repeats were performed, obtaining similar results.
In Vivo Randomization
At the beginning of the in vivo experiment a numeric ID was randomly assigned to each mouse. At the time engraftment, all animals
were assessed in a consecutive order according to their ID, from the smaller to the larger. Same sex mice with comparable weight
were assigned to one of the 5 treatment arms only based on the bioluminescent signal, aiming to ensure an equal distribution of tumor
burden across the groups.

 Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed on GraphPad Prism 7 software. For comparisons between two groups, the Wilcoxon (paired) or
Mann–Whitney U (unpaired) test were used, with correction for multiple t tests according to the two-stage step-up method of
Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli. For comparison between more than two groups, either one of the following tests were performed
depending on the number of variables: non-parametric Friedman (paired) or Kruskal-Wallis (unpaired) test with post-hoc Dunn’s test
(one variable, non-parametric for one-way ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA adjusted by Tukey (more than one variables). Survival was
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with log rank analysis for comparing survival between groups. All experimental data
are presented as mean ± standard error mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. All p values given are two-tailed values. A p value
below 0.05 was considered significant.
