This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during 
October 2, 2016–February 4, 2017,† and updates the previous 
summary (1). Influenza activity in the United States began 
to increase in mid-December, remained elevated through 
February 4, 2017, and is expected to continue for several more 
weeks. To date, influenza A (H3N2) viruses have predominated 
overall, but influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses 
have also been identified.
Virologic Surveillance
U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) and National 
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System laborato-
ries, which include both public health and clinical laboratories 
throughout the United States, contribute to virologic surveil-
lance for influenza.
During October 2, 2016–February 4, 2017, clinical labora-
tories in the United States tested 392,901 respiratory specimens 
for influenza viruses, 38,244 (9.7%) of which were positive 
(Figure 1). During the week ending February 4, 2017 (week 5), 
27,409 specimens were tested, 5,722 (20.9%) of which were 
positive for influenza. Among these, 5,017 (87.7%) were posi-
tive for influenza A viruses and 705 (12.3%) were positive for 
influenza B viruses.
Public health laboratories in the United States tested 
38,141 respiratory specimens collected during October 2, 
2016–February 4, 2017. Among these, 15,781 were posi-
tive for influenza (Figure 2), 14,606 (92.6%) were positive 
for influenza A viruses, and 1,174 (7.4%) were positive for 
influenza B viruses. Among the 14,335 (98.1%) influenza A 
viruses subtyped, 13,973 (97.5%) were influenza A (H3N2) 
and 362 (2.5%) were influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Among 
the 851 (72.5%) influenza B viruses for which lineage was 
* The CDC influenza surveillance system collects five categories of information 
from eight data sources: 1) viral surveillance (U.S. World Health Organization 
collaborating laboratories, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus 
Surveillance System, and novel influenza A virus case reporting); 2) outpatient 
illness surveillance (U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance 
Network); 3) mortality (the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality 
Surveillance System and influenza-associated pediatric mortality reports); 
 
4) hospitalizations (FluSurv-NET, which includes the Emerging Infections 
Program and surveillance in three additional states); and 5) summary of the 
geographic spread of influenza (state and territorial epidemiologist reports).

determined, 460 (54.1%) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage 
and 391 (45.9%) belonged to the B/Victoria lineage.
Age was reported for 13,306 influenza-positive patients, 
among whom 1,048 (7.9%) were aged 0–4 years, 4,041 
(30.4%) were aged 5–24 years, 4,029 (30.3%) were aged 
25–64 years, and 4,188 (31.5%) were aged ≥65 years. 
Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated in each age group, 
representing a range of 82.3% of influenza-positives in per-
sons aged 0–4 years to 93.6% in persons aged ≥65 years. 
The largest number of influenza B viruses were reported in 
persons aged 5–24 years.
Novel Influenza A Viruses
Two human infections with a novel influenza A virus were 
reported during October 2, 2016–February 4, 2017. One 
patient from Iowa with exposure to swine in the week preced-
ing illness was infected with an influenza A (H1N2) variant 
[(H1N2)v] virus.§ Another patient was infected with an 
avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus and reported close, 
prolonged unprotected exposure to the respiratory secretions 
of sick cats known to be infected with this virus at a New York 
City animal shelter. Neither patient was hospitalized; both 
recovered fully, and there was no evidence of human-to-human 
transmission in either instance.
Antigenic and Genetic Characterization of 
Influenza Viruses
WHO collaborating laboratories in the United States are 
requested to submit a subset of influenza-positive respiratory 
specimens to CDC for further virus characterization. CDC 
characterizes influenza viruses through one or more laboratory 
tests, including genomic sequencing, antigenic characteriza-
tion by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and neutralization 
assays. Historically, HI data have been used most commonly 
to assess the similarity between vaccine viruses and circulat-
ing viruses to infer how well the vaccine might work until 
§ Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when 
isolated from swine, but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from 
humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human 
population have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza 
viruses circulating in swine.

vaccine effectiveness estimates are available.¶ For all viruses 
characterized at CDC laboratories, next-generation sequencing 
is performed to determine the genetic identity of circulating 
viruses. The antigenic properties of viruses that cannot be 
characterized are inferred from viruses with matching genes 
whose antigenic profile is known.
CDC has genetically characterized 892 viruses (101 
influenza A (H1N1)pdm09; 593 influenza A (H3N2); and 
198 influenza B viruses) collected from October 1, 2016, 
through February 4, 2017. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene 
segment of all influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses analyzed 
belonged to genetic group 6B.1. Influenza A (H3N2) virus 
HA gene segments analyzed belonged to genetic groups 3C.2a 
¶ A virus is considered “reference virus-like” if its hemagglutination inhibition 
(HI) or neutralization focus reduction assay (FRA) titer is within fourfold of 
the homologous HI/FRA titer of the reference strain. A virus is considered as 
low to the reference virus if there is an eightfold or greater reduction in the HI 
or FRA titer when compared with the homologous HI or FRA titer of the 
reference strain.
(567 viruses) or 3C.3a (26 viruses). Genetic group 3C.2a 
includes an emerging subgroup defined as 3C.2a1. The HA 
of influenza B/Victoria-lineage viruses all belonged to genetic 
group V1A. The HA of all influenza B/Yamagata-lineage 
viruses analyzed belonged to genetic group Y3.
During October 1, 2016–February 4, 2017, CDC antigeni-
cally characterized 484 influenza viruses (74 influenza A (H1N1)
pdm09, 267 influenza A (H3N2), and 143 influenza B viruses). All 
74 (100%) influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically 
similar to A/California/7/2009, the recommended influenza A 
(H1N1) component of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere vac-
cine. Among 267 influenza A (H3N2) viruses, 258 (96.6%) were 
antigenically similar to the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014–like cell 
propagated reference virus belonging to genetic group 3C.2a, 
which is the recommended influenza A (H3N2) component of 
the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. Seventy (90.9%) of 
77 influenza B/Victoria-lineage viruses were antigenically similar 
to B/Brisbane/60/2008, which is the recommended influenza B 
component of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere trivalent and 
* 38,244 (9.7%) of 392,907 tested were positive during October 2, 2016–February 4, 2017.

Antiviral Resistance of Influenza Viruses
The WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza at CDC tested 807 
influenza virus specimens (94 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, 
519 influenza A (H3N2), and 194 influenza B viruses) col-
lected in the United States from October 1, 2016, through 
February 4, 2017, for resistance to the influenza neuramini-
dase inhibitor antiviral medications oseltamivir, zanamivir, 
and peramivir, drugs currently approved for use against sea-
sonal influenza. All 807 influenza viruses tested were found 
to be sensitive to all three antiviral medications. An additional 
114 influenza A (H3N2) viruses were tested for resistance to 
oseltamivir and zanamivir, and were found to be sensitive to 
both antiviral medications.
Outpatient Illness Surveillance
From October 2, 2016, through February 4, 2017, the 
weekly percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness 
(ILI)** reported by approximately 2,000 U.S. Outpatient ILI 
Surveillance Network (ILINet) providers in 50 states, New 
York City, Chicago, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and 
the District of Columbia, has ranged from 1.2% to 4.8%. 
** Defined as a fever (temperature ≥100°F [≥37.8°C]), oral or equivalent, and 
cough and/or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza.
 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
MMWR / February 17, 2017 / Vol. 66 / No. 6 
163
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The percentage exceeded the national baseline†† of 2.2% for 8 
consecutive weeks, from the weeks ending December 17, 2016–
February 4, 2017 (weeks 50–5) (Figure 3). During the previous 
five influenza seasons, the peak weekly percentages of outpatient 
visits for ILI ranged from 2.4%–6.1% and remained above base-
line levels for an average of 13 weeks (range = 1–20 weeks). For 
the week ending February 4, 2017 (week 5), the percentage of 
outpatient visits for ILI was 4.8%, and all 10 U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions§§ reported ILI 
activity at or above region-specific baseline levels.
Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure 
of ILI activity¶¶ by jurisdiction. During the week ending 
February 4, 2017, New York City and 23 states (Alabama, Arkansas, 
Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New 
York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, 
South Dakota, T
ennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming)  expe-
rienced high ILI activity; 10 states (California, Colorado, Florida, 
Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, and 
Wisconsin) experienced moderate ILI activity; Puerto Rico and 
eight states (Alaska, Arizona, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Nevada, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) experienced low ILI 
activity; nine states (Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, New 
Hampshire, Ohio, Utah, Vermont, and Washington) experienced 
minimal ILI activity; and the District of Columbia had insufficient 
data to calculate an ILI activity level.
Geographic Spread of Influenza Activity
Influenza activity levels reported by state and territorial 
epidemiologists indicate the geographic spread of influenza viruses. 
 
†† The national and regional baselines are the mean percentage of visits for 
influenza-like illness (ILI) during noninfluenza weeks for the previous three 
seasons plus two standard deviations. Noninfluenza weeks are defined as periods 
of ≥2 consecutive weeks in which each week accounted for <2% of the season’s 
total number of specimens that tested positive for influenza. National and 
regional percentages of patient visits for ILI are weighted based on state 
population. Use of the national baseline for regional data is not appropriate.
 
§§ The 10 regions include the following jurisdictions: Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont; Region 2: New 
Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; Region 3: Delaware, 
District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia; 
 
Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, and Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Ohio, and Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, 
and Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, 
Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, 
California, Hawaii, Nevada, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, and 
Republic of Palau; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.
 
¶¶ Activity levels are based on the percentage of outpatient visits in a jurisdiction 
attributed to ILI and are compared with the average percentage of ILI visits that 
occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation. Activity levels range 
from minimal, corresponding to ILI activity from outpatient clinics at or below the 
average, to high, corresponding to ILI activity from outpatient clinics much higher 
than the average. Because the clinical definition of ILI is nonspecific, not all ILI is 
caused by influenza; however, when combined with laboratory data, the information 
on ILI activity provides a clearer picture of influenza activity in the United States.
For the week ending February 4, 2017 (week 5), Puerto Rico and 
43 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, 
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode 
Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, T
exas, Vermont, Virginia, 
Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) reported widespread 
activity.*** Guam and six states (Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, 
Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia) reported regional activity. 
The District of Columbia and one state (Hawaii) reported local 
activity, and the U.S. Virgin Islands reported no influenza activity. 
During the previous five influenza seasons, the peak number of 
jurisdictions reporting widespread activity in a single week during 
each season has ranged from 20 in the 2011–12 season to 48 during 
the 2012–13 season.
Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with labora-
tory-confirmed influenza infection in adults and children 
through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network 
(FluSurv-NET),††† which covers approximately 27 million 
persons (9% of the U.S. population). From October 1, 2016, 
through February 4, 2017, 6,804 laboratory-confirmed 
 *** Levels of activity are 1) no activity; 2) sporadic: isolated laboratory-confirmed 
influenza cases or a laboratory-confirmed outbreak in one institution, with no 
increase in activity; 3) local: increased ILI, or two or more institutional outbreaks 
(ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in one region of the state, with recent 
laboratory evidence of influenza in that region; virus activity no greater than 
sporadic in other regions; 4) regional: increased ILI activity or institutional 
outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in two or more outbreaks, 
but less than half of the regions in the state with recent laboratory evidence of 
influenza in those regions; and 5) widespread: increased ILI activity or 
institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in at least half 
the regions in the state, with recent laboratory evidence of influenza in the state.
 ††† FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed, 
influenza-associated hospitalizations in children and adolescents aged <18 years 
(since the 2003–04 influenza season) and adults aged ≥18 years (since the 
2005–06 influenza season). The FluSurv-NET covers approximately 70 counties 
in the 10 Emerging Infections Program states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, 
Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and T
ennessee) 
and additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. 
IHSP began during the 2009–10 season to enhance surveillance during the 2009 
H1N1 pandemic. IHSP sites included Iowa, Idaho, Michigan, Oklahoma, and 
South Dakota during the 2009–10 season; Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, 
Rhode Island, and Utah during the 2010–11 season; Michigan, Ohio, Rhode 
Island, and Utah during the 2011–12 season; Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode 
Island, and Utah during the 2012–13 season; and Michigan, Ohio, and Utah 
during the 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, and 2016–17 seasons. Cumulative 
unadjusted incidence rates are calculated using CDC’s National Center for Health 
Statistics population estimates for the counties included in the surveillance 
catchment area. Laboratory confirmation is dependent on clinician-ordered 
influenza testing, and testing for influenza often is underutilized because of the 
poor reliability of rapid test results and greater reliance on clinical diagnosis for 
influenza. Therefore, cases identified as part of influenza hospitalization 
surveillance likely are an underestimation of the actual number of persons 
hospitalized with influenza.

influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported, with a 
cumulative incidence for all age groups of 24.3 per 100,000 
population. Persons aged ≥65 years had the highest rate of 
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalization 
and accounted for approximately 60% of reported influenza-
associated hospitalizations.
The cumulative hospitalization rate (per 100,000 popula-
tion) during October 1, 2016–February 4, 2017 was 13.6 
among children aged 0–4 years, 4.8 among children and ado-
lescents aged 5–17 years, 7.3 among adults aged 18–49 years, 
23.5 among adults aged 50–64 years, and 113.4 among 
adults aged ≥65 years. Among all hospitalizations reported 
during October 1, 2016–February 4, 2017, a total of 6,367 
(93.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, 395 (5.8%) 
with influenza B virus, 21 (0.3%) with influenza A and B 
virus coinfection, and 21 (0.3%) with influenza virus for 
which the type was not determined. Among 1,729 patients 
with influenza A subtype information, 1,701 (98.4%) were 
infected with influenza A (H3N2) virus and 28 (1.6%) were 
infected with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus.
Complete medical chart abstraction data were available for 
796 (11.7%) hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed 
influenza as of February 4, 2017. Among 744 hospitalized 
adults with complete medical chart abstraction, 703 (94.5%) 
had at least one underlying medical condition that placed them 
at high risk for influenza-associated complications. The most 
commonly reported medical conditions were cardiovascular 
disease (47.1%), metabolic disorders (39.7%), and obesity 
(38.3%). Among 52 hospitalized children with complete medi-
cal chart abstraction, 28 (53.8%) had at least one underlying 
medical condition, the most commonly reported being asthma 
(15.4%), chronic lung disease (15.4%), and neurologic disor-
der (15.4%). Among 59 hospitalized women of childbearing 
age (15–44 years), 20 (33.9%) were pregnant.
Pneumonia and Influenza-Attributed Mortality
CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)-attributed 
deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. The percentages of 
deaths attributed to P&I are released 2 weeks after the week 
of death to allow for collection of sufficient data to pro-
duce a stable P&I mortality percentage. Weekly mortality 
surveillance data includes a combination of machine coded 
and manually coded causes of death collected from death 
certificates. There is a backlog of data requiring manual 
coding within the NCHS mortality surveillance data. The 
percentages of deaths attributable to P&I are higher among 
manually coded records than the more rapidly available 
machine coded records and might result in initially reported 
P&I percentages that are lower than percentages calculated 
from final data. Initiatives continue to reduce and monitor 
the number of records awaiting manual coding.
Based on data from NCHS available on February 9, 2017, 
7.9% (2,691 of 33,868) of all U.S. deaths occurring during 
the week ending January 21, 2017 (week 3) were attributed 
to P&I. This percentage is above the epidemic threshold§§§ of 
7.4% for week 3. Since October 2, 2016 the weekly percentage 
of deaths attributed to P&I has ranged from 5.6% to 7.9% 
and has exceeded the epidemic threshold for three consecutive 
weeks, from the weeks ending January 7–21 (weeks 1–3), this 
season. During the previous five influenza seasons, the peak 
weekly percentage of deaths attributable to P&I ranged from 
8.2% in the 2015–16 season to 11.1% in the 2012–13 season.
Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality
As of February 4, 2017 (week 5), 20 laboratory-confirmed 
influenza-associated pediatric deaths that occurred during the 
2016–17 season were reported to CDC. Of the 20 deaths, 
nine were associated with an influenza A (H3N2) virus infec-
tion, one was associated with an influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
virus infection, five were associated with an influenza A virus 
infection for which no subtyping was performed, four were 
associated with an influenza B virus infection, and one was 
associated with an influenza virus for which the type was not 
determined. Since influenza-associated pediatric mortality 
became a nationally notifiable condition in 2004, the total 
number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths per season has 
ranged from 37 to 171; excluding the 2009 pandemic, when 
358 pediatric deaths were reported to CDC from April 15, 
2009, through October 2, 2010.
Discussion
Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in 
mid-December and remained elevated as of February 4, 2017. 
During the most recent weeks, decreases in activity have been 
observed in the Northwest (HHS Region 10), while activity has 
continued to increase in the remainder of the country. During 
October 2, 2016–February 4, 2017, influenza A (H3N2) 
viruses accounted for the majority of circulating influenza 
viruses, but influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses 
also were identified. Influenza activity has been moderate so far 
this season, and severity indicators are within the range of what 
has been observed during previous seasons when influenza A 
(H3N2) viruses predominated. Elevated influenza activity in 
parts of the United States is expected for several more weeks.
 §§§ The seasonal baseline proportion of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths 
is projected using a robust regression procedure, in which a periodic regression 
model is applied to the observed percentage of deaths from P&I that were 
reported by the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance 
System during the preceding 5 years. The epidemic threshold is set at 1.645 
standard deviations above the seasonal baseline.

2017, indicate that overall the influenza vaccine has been 
48% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 37%–57%) effective 
in preventing influenza-related medical visits across all age 
groups, and specifically was 43% (CI = 29%–54%) and 73% 
(CI = 54%–84%) effective in preventing medical visits associ-
ated with influenza A (H3N2) and influenza B, respectively 
(2). Annual influenza vaccination is the first and best defense 
to protect against influenza infection. Depending on the vac-
cine formulation (trivalent or quadrivalent), influenza vaccines 
can protect against three or four different influenza viruses. 
Even during seasons when vaccine effectiveness is reduced, 
vaccination can offer substantial benefit and might reduce the 
likelihood of severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death.
Although health care providers should continue to offer 
and encourage vaccination to all unvaccinated persons aged 
≥6 months as long as influenza viruses are circulating, influenza 
antiviral medications are an important adjunct to vaccination 
in the treatment and prevention of influenza. No antiviral 
resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir has been 
identified among influenza viruses collected since October 1, 
2016. Treatment as soon as possible with influenza antiviral 
medications is recommended for patients with confirmed or 
suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progres-
sive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk 
for influenza complications.¶¶¶ Antiviral treatment should 
not be withheld from high-risk or severely ill patients with 
suspected influenza infection, even if rapid antigen-detection 
influenza diagnostic test results are negative (3). Generic oselta-
mivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on 
August 3, 2016 (4), and became available in December 2016.
An unusual outbreak of avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus 
infection among cats in an animal shelter in New York City was 
first reported to public health officials on December 14, 2016. 
Approximately 350 persons with exposure to infected cats 
during this outbreak were screened or tested for infection and 
 ¶¶¶ Persons at higher risk include 1) children aged <2 years; 2) adults aged 
≥65 years; 3) persons with chronic pulmonary conditions (including asthma), 
cardiovascular disease (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, 
hematologic (including sickle cell) disease, metabolic disorders (including 
diabetes mellitus), or neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions 
(including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and muscles, 
such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability 
[mental retardation], moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular 
dystrophy, or spinal cord injury); 4) persons with immunosuppression, 
including that caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus 
infection; 5) women who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks after 
delivery); 6) persons aged ≤18 years who are receiving long-term aspirin 
therapy; 7) American Indians/Alaska Natives; 8) persons with extreme obesity 
(i.e., body mass index ≥40); and 9) residents of nursing homes and other 
chronic care facilities.
only one human infection with avian influenza A (H7N2) was 
identified (5). This is the first influenza A (H7N2) virus infec-
tion in humans identified in the United States since 2003 and 
the first known human infection with an influenza A virus likely 
acquired through exposure to an ill cat. The finding of an avian 
lineage influenza virus in an unexpected host, such as a domestic 
cat, or any human infection with a nonhuman influenza virus 
is concerning. Early identification and investigation of human 
infections with novel influenza A viruses are critical so that the 
risk of infection can be more fully understood and appropriate 
public health measures can be taken. If clinical laboratories test 
a respiratory specimen that they cannot type or subtype using 
commercially available rapid or molecular influenza diagnostic 
tests, they should contact their state public health laboratory to 
facilitate transport of specimens for additional testing. Public 
health laboratories should immediately send virus specimens that 
they cannot type or subtype using standard methods to CDC 
and submit all specimens that are otherwise unusual as soon as 
possible after identification.
Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted 
online weekly (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly). Additional infor-
mation regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, influenza 
vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influenza A 
infections in humans is online (https://www.cdc.gov/flu).
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity 
year round in the United States. Timing of influenza activity and 
predominant circulating influenza viruses vary by season.
What is added by this report?
Influenza activity in the United States began to increase in 
mid-December, remained elevated through February 4, 2016, 
and is expected to continue for several more weeks. During 
October 2, 2016–February 4, 2017, influenza A (H3N2) viruses 
were identified most frequently, but influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
and influenza B viruses were also reported. No antiviral 
resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, or peramivir has been 
identified among influenza viruses tested to date.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Elevated influenza activity in parts of the United States is 
expected for several more weeks. Influenza vaccination remains 
the most effective way to prevent influenza illness. Antiviral 
medications are an important adjunct to vaccination in the 
treatment and prevention of influenza. Early treatment with 
neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications is recommended 
for patients with severe, complicated, or progressive influenza 
illness and those at higher risk for influenza complications, 
including adults aged ≥65 years.
