The restoration of light response with complex spatiotemporal features in retinal degen-
erative diseases towards retinal prosthesis has proven to be a considerable challenge over the
past decades. Herein, inspired by the structure and function of photoreceptors in retinas, we
develop artificial photoreceptors based on gold nanoparticle-decorated titania nanowire
arrays, for restoration of visual responses in the blind mice with degenerated photoreceptors.
Green, blue and near UV light responses in the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are restored with
a spatial resolution better than 100 µm. ON responses in RGCs are blocked by glutamatergic
antagonists, suggesting functional preservation of the remaining retinal circuits. Moreover,
neurons in the primary visual cortex respond to light after subretinal implant of nanowire
arrays. Improvement in pupillary light reflex suggests the behavioral recovery of light sen-
sitivity. Our study will shed light on the development of a new generation of optoelectronic
toolkits for subretinal prosthetic devices.

etina is an important light-sensitive tissue that transduces
light information into neural activities through multi-layers
of neuronal cells1–5. Light entering an eye passes through
the transparent retina and is mostly captured by the visual
pigment-containing photoreceptors6–9. Retinal degenerative dis-
eases such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration lead
to irreversible damage or even loss of photoreceptors, which can
result in serious impairment of vision and eventually blind-
ness10,11. The state-of-art retinal prosthesis devices require the
use of a subretinally placed photodiode array detecting near-
infrared signals from a video capturing camera12,13. Recently,
developing light-responsive materials as artificial photoreceptors
for interfacing with blind retinas has emerged as a promising
alternative for retinal prosthesis, with several exciting preliminary
demonstrations using metal electrode arrays14, cadmium sulfide-
carbon nanotubes15, semiconductor silicon photodiodes16 or
conducting
polymers17–19.
However,
these
photoresponsive
devices require additional microelectronic processing for signal
generation, transduction and processing, posting limitations for
in vivo applications. Breaking this bottleneck requires capabilities
for engineering large interaction surfaces/interfaces between ret-
inal cells and semiconductor micro/nanostructures. Recently,
subretinal implantation of photovoltaic polymers restores light
sensitivity in blind rats19. However, spatiotemporal character-
izations of retinal responses are not clear.
Among the potential candidates of photoresponsive materials
targeting the goal of artificial photoreceptors, the ordered,
oriented one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor nanowire (NW)
arrays exhibit high surface areas, large charge transport mobility,
excellent biocompatibility and stability20–22. Distinctive from
previous reports of photoresponsive materials/structures, the high
orientation and anisotropy of 1D NW arrays are analogous to the
morphology and architecture of photoreceptors (Fig. 1a, b), and
thereby enable efficient photoabsorption and charge separation
that are similar in photoconversion devices such as solar cells23 or
photodetectors24. The oriented semiconductor NW arrays are
capable of generating photocurrent upon light illumination to
depolarize neurons25. In addition, as no trans-ocular cables or
power supplies are needed, a high and uniform areal density of
photoresponsive units is expected for optimized spatial resolu-
tion. More uniquely, the surface roughness of oriented NW arrays
may further enhance interfacing efficiency with innate retinal
circuits including bipolar cells, which is crucial for the artificial
retinal prosthesis towards visual function restoration.
Herein, we demonstrate
an
oriented
gold nanoparticle-
decorated titania (Au-TiO2) NW arrays-based artificial photo-
receptor interfaced with retinal degenerated 1 (rd1) /cone diph-
theria toxin subunit-A (cDTA) blind mouse retinas, for real-time
transduction of photo-coded information. Retinal ON responses
to green, blue and near UV light are robustly recorded with high
spatial and temporal resolutions, indicating direct stimulation of
bipolar cells without affecting the rest of retinal circuit. More
excitingly, with NW arrays subretinally implanted into blind
mice,
light-evoked
activities
in
the
primary
visual
cortex
(V1) in vivo, as well as improved pupillary light reflex (PLR) in
awake-behaving mice confirm the recovery of visual function
4–8 weeks after implant surgery, indicating the potential of using
NW arrays as subretinal prosthetic devices.
Results
Fabrication of Au nanoparticle-decorated TiO2 NW arrays.
The oriented Au–TiO2 NW arrays were grown on fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO, Supplementary Fig. 1) or flexible polymer sub-
strates (Supplementary Fig. 2) by a hydrothermal method26,27,
followed by in-situ reduction of gold salt on the surface of pre-
formed TiO2 NW arrays (Methods). The obtained Au-TiO2
NW arrays had a perpendicular orientation to the underlying
substrate, and the average NW diameter and length were ~100
nm and ~2 μm, respectively (Fig. 2a, b), similar to those of
pristine TiO2 NW arrays before deposition of Au nanoparticles
(Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). The density of NWs was ~10 per μm2,
corresponding to ~109 NW arrays per cm2. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the Au-TiO2 NW arrays displayed character-
istic reflection peaks of a rutile TiO2 crystalline structure (Joint
Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, JCPDS No. 21-
1276) and a face-center-cubic Au structure (JCPDS No. 04-0784)
(Fig. 2c)28. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
showed the average size of surface-decorated Au nanoparticles
was ~10 ± 5 nm, with the inter-particle distance ranging from 10
to 30 nm (Fig. 2d). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images
(Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 1c) and the selected-area electron
diffraction (SAED) patterns (inset in Supplementary Fig. 1c)
revealed the single-crystalline nature of both the NW trunks and
the surface-decorated Au nanoparticles, respectively. The well-
resolved lattice fringes of 0.324 and 0.248 nm (Fig. 2e) were
correlated to the d-spacing values of (110) and (101) planes of
rutile TiO2 crystals29. The lattice spacing of 0.235 nm was
assigned to the (111) planes of Au crystal with a face-center-cubic
structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3) and mapping of Ti, O and Au (Supplementary
Fig. 4) further confirmed the composition of Au-TiO2 NW arrays,
as well as the uniform distribution of Au nanoparticles over entire
TiO2 NW arrays. The molar percentages of Au and Ti were
calculated as ~0.11% and 71.77%, respectively. X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. 2f) revealed two peaks for Ti as 2p1/2
and 2p3/2, and two peaks for Au 4f5/2 and 4f7/2.
The decoration of Au nanoparticles can enhance the photo-
conversion efficiency of TiO2 NW arrays into visible range, due to
the electrical field amplification and the injection of surface
plasmon resonance generated hot electrons into TiO2 conduction
band30. The photoabsorption property of Au–TiO2 NW arrays

 was first demonstrated by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy
(Fig. 2g). Compared to pristine TiO2 NW arrays that mainly
absorb at the UV region, the Au–TiO2 NW arrays show a much
enhanced photoabsorption in the visible range, with the peak
position centered around 550 nm, in accordance with the surface
plasmon absorption of ~10 nm Au nanoparticles31,32. The
absorption coefficients for Au–TiO2 NW arrays were calculated
to be ~1.5, 0.4, and 0.5 μm–1 in the UV, blue and green regimes,
respectively, comparable or better than the absorption coefficients
of natural photoreceptors (i.e., 0.02–0.06 μm–1 in the green
regime)33. These enhanced absorption coefficients are beneficial
for Au–TiO2 NW arrays with a much smaller thickness than
normal photoreceptor cell layers, typically on the order of 60 μm.
The photoconversion properties of Au–TiO2 NW arrays were
then demonstrated by photocurrent measurements under differ-
ent wavelengths of near UV, blue and green light, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 5, Methods). The typical substrate size was
~1 cm2. Compared to the dark state without light, when the
Au–TiO2
NW
arrays
were
illuminated
by
different
light
wavelengths, a clear increase of photocurrent was recorded
almost instantaneously, while the shutoff of light led to the drop
of photocurrent to the original dark state. The summarized
photocurrent response of different light wavelengths show the
average magnitudes of photocurrent change were ~1450, 108, and
87 pA, respectively (Fig. 2h).

 Light responses and spatial resolution. Mice are naturally sen-
sitive to both near UV and visible light. In the following elec-
trophysiology studies, light responses of retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) in wild-type (C57BL/6J) and rd1/cDTA mouse retinas
with NW array interfaces were investigated. Mutations in both
Pde6b and cDTA genes in rd1/cDTA mice (also referred to as
blind mice below) led to complete degeneration of rod and cone
photoreceptors by P50 (Fig. 3a, Methods34). To eliminate the
possibility of some remaining photoreceptors, we conducted
more experiments to measure light responses of RGCs in rd1/

 cDTA blind retinas. 0/8 RGCs from 4 retinas, 0/7 RGCs from 5
retinas and 0/6 RGCs from 5 retinas responded to near UV (375/
28 nm), blue (470/20 nm) and green (546/12 nm) light, respec-
tively, indicating that both rod and cone photoreceptors were
completely absent in the rd1/cDTA blind retina. Au-TiO2 NW
arrays were then placed underneath the blind retina, with the
inner nuclear layer in contact with NW arrays, and the activities
of RGCs were recorded using patch clamp pipettes. The retina
and NW arrays were in close contact, as shown in scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images (Fig. 3b). Contours of indi-
vidual retinal cells were not visible in SEM images, as the
membranes of retinal cells were embedded in the retinal tissue
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
It is clear that RGCs in the blind retina robustly responded to
near UV light (with a 0.24 s duration and intervals of 10, 5 and 2
s, respectively) (Fig. 3c). In addition, to evaluate the light
sensitivity of the NW arrays-interfaced blind retina, the spike
activities of RGCs in response to light with different intensities
were measured (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The intensity-dependent
responses to near UV light were similar or close to those in wild-
type mice. The fractions of light responsive RGCs in wild-type
mouse retinas were similar for different intensities (Fig. 3d, black
curve). In the NW arrays-interfaced blind mouse retinas, the
fraction of light responsive RGCs were 78%, 47%, 36% and 42% at
133, 66.5, 33.2, and 16.6 μW mm–2, respectively (Fig. 3d, red
curve). In addition, RGCs in wild-type mice responded to
majority of light pulses (Fig. 3e, black curve). For the NW arrays-
interfaced blind mouse retinas, we also showed that the threshold
to induce light response was ~0.5 μW mm-2 (Fig. 3g), that was 25
lux, which was out of the intensity range of rods (≤0.1 lux). The
percentages of pulses that initiated spike activities in RGCs were
similar to those of wild-type retinas (Fig. 3e, red curve). The
number of spikes for different light intensities, as well as the spike
waveforms were also similar (Supplementary Fig. 7b, g). Due to
the absence of photoreceptors and therefore sign-preserving and
sign-inverting synapses between the photoreceptors and the
bipolar cells, only ON responses were recorded in the NW arrays-
interfaced blind mouse retinas. The latency of RGCs in
NW arrays-interfaced blind retina was similar to those in wild-
type retina at different UV light intensities (Supplementary
Fig. 7d). The latencies for green and blue light in NW arrays-
interfaced blind retina were much larger than those in wild-type
retina, most likely due to the fact that the photocurrent induced
by green and blue light was smaller than that by UV light.
The sensitivity of different light wavelengths was then
investigated. In wild-type mice, RGCs responded to near UV,
blue, and green light (with intensities of 133, 691 and 470 μW
mm–2, respectively) (Fig. 3f, top panel). Without the NW arrays,
retinas of blind mice did not respond to either UV, blue or green
light (Fig. 3f, middle panel), confirming the blindness of these
mice. The representative spiking activities of RGCs in response to
near UV, blue and green light were shown in Fig. 3f, bottom
panel. For each RGC, at least three light pulses were presented,
with approximately 1 min interval between each pulse. The
average number of elicited spikes was 11 for near UV, 4 for blue
and 6 for green light. Light-responsive RGCs responded to 84%
near UV light pulses, 57% blue light pulses and 86% green light
pulses, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Moreover, time
evolution of RGC responses were measured (Supplementary
Fig. 8), indicating that the interface between NW arrays and
retinal cells was purely physical contact and did not evolve over
time.
In order to examine the anatomical and functional On- and
Off-features of RGCs in NW arrays-interfaced blind retina and
wild-type retina, we recorded the light responses of RGCs with
micropipette filled with internal solutions containing Lucifer
Yellow, and then conducted immunostaining of these recorded
RGCs to examine the distribution of their dendritic arbors in On
and Off layers (labeled by ChAT). We first investigated whether
light-sensitive Lucifer Yellow in the pipette affected the light

 responses in the RGCs35. The percentage of responsive RGCs was
similar with or without Lucifer Yellow in the pipette (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9d). In the NW arrays-interfaced blind retina,
dendrites of some RGCs were located in both On and Off layers
(Fig. 4a, top panel). These RGCs exhibited On responses. Some
other RGCs had their dendrites distributed in On layer, and
exhibited On responses as well (Fig. 4a, bottom panel). These
results indicated that RGCs responded to the onset of light by
photocurrent from the NW arrays, despite the fact that they
received input from both On-center and Off-center bipolar cells.
We further examined the light responsive patterns of RGCs in
both NW arrays-interfaced blind retina and wild-type retina. It
turns out that the ~30% of the RGCs in NW arrays-interfaced
blind retina sustained On responses to light stimulation, whereas
the rest RGCs showed transient On responses (Supplementary
Fig. 7e). This ratio of transient On to sustained On response was
similar to that of wild-type RGCs.
To investigate whether the RGC light responses resulted from
direct RGC activation or indirect activation of bipolar cells that
induced spiking activities in RGCs, synaptic transmission from
bipolar cells to RGCs was blocked using glutamate receptor
antagonists (Methods). The light responses from RGCs disap-
peared 4 min after the application of drugs (Fig. 4b, left and
middle columns). After washing off the drugs, the light responses
were restored (Fig. 4b, right columns). Light responses of all the
RGCs were blocked by the drugs, indicating that light responses

 in RGCs originate mostly from activation of bipolar cells instead
of RGCs (Supplementary Fig. 7h).
The spatial resolution of light response in the NW arrays-
interfaced blind mouse retinas was further investigated. The
photocurrents induced by light spots were measured with
different sizes and different distances from the center of the spot
(Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). Near UV and green light spots with
different diameters were presented to the RGC (Fig. 5a). For blind
mouse retinas, the minimum size of light spots to trigger RGC
response was 45 µm. When the diameter of near UV light spot
was smaller than 100 µm, 44% of RGCs exhibited clear responses
(Fig. 5b). The percentages of RGCs that responded to near UV
light spots with diameters of 100–200 µm, 200–300 µm, and
300–600 µm were 79%, 84%, and 96%, respectively. Meanwhile,
for green and blue light spots with diameters of 200–300 µm, 31%
and 22% of RGCs exhibited light responses, respectively; for green
and blue light spots with diameters of 300–600 µm, 36% of RGCs
exhibited light responses. In Supplementary Figure 9b, the
photocurrent increased significantly when the size of the light
spots increased from 200 µm to 300–600 µm, which can lead to
the increased percentage of responsive RGCs for the light spots of
300–600 µm. For wild-type mouse retinas, RGCs exhibited a

 receptive field was 316 µm (Fig. 5d). In addition, we moved the
light spot of 45 µm across the RGC (Supplementary Fig. 9e).

swept around the vicinity of the cell body.

light
responses in the NW array-interfaced blind mouse retinas using
calcium-sensitive protein (GCaMP6s) imaging were also illu-
strated. 88% of GCaMP6s cells expressed Brn3a, a RGC marker,
indicating that majority of the GCaMP6s cells were RGCs
(Fig. 6a, b, Supplementary Fig. 10). Light induced responses in
both RGCs and underlying neuritis (Fig. 6c, d, Supplementary
Movie 1 in the Supporting Information). Some cells had no
obvious light-evoked responses (Fig. 6e). The light response
curves were similar for all the RGCs (Fig. 6f). 46% RGCs had light
responses under whole-field illumination, demonstrating global
activation of RGCs. Taken together, these results indicate that the
NW arrays-interfaced blind mouse retina has good population
light responses.
Light responses of cortical neurons in vivo. To further exhibit
the potential utilization of NW arrays in retinal prosthesis, we
conducted subretinal implant surgery of NW arrays in blind mice.
Figure 7a–c showed the substrate of NW arrays implanted into
the subretinal space. 5 months after the implant surgery, the
lamination of the blind retina, as well as the RGCs labeled by
Brn3a was unaffected by the implant (Fig. 7d). We presented near
UV light to one eye of the blind mice and recorded the light-
evoked spikes and visually evoked potentials (VEPs) in the con-
tralateral primary visual cortex (Fig. 7e). In the blind mice, no
obvious light-evoked spikes were detected (Fig. 7f, left column).
UV light elicited robust spiking responses in all implanted blind
mice 2 days after implantation (Fig. 7f, middle left column) and
wild-type mice (Fig. 7f, right column). In addition, we conducted
recordings in chronically implanted mice of both 2 months and
5 months after the implant surgery. The light evoked spiking
activities were more prominent in chronically implanted mice
(Fig. 7f, middle and middle right columns). UV light also trig-
gered robust local field potentials (LFP) changes in the implanted
blind mice (Fig. 7g). The fraction of stimuli that elicited LFP
responses for blind mice remained the same for different light
intensities, whereas that for the NW arrays-implanted blind mice
increased with increasing light intensity (Fig. 7h), confirming the
clear light response restoration of blind mouse retinas in vivo.
The VEP amplitude in NW arrays-implanted blind mice was
larger than that in blind mice, but still smaller than that in wild-
type mice (Fig. 7i). We also observed light evoked spiking
activities in the superior collicus (SC) in NW arrays-implanted
blind mice (Supplementary Fig. 11).

 The vision in near UV was investigated in vivo in alive rd1/
cDTA mice. Although cornea, lens and other tissues in the eye
absorb some UV light, mouse retinas can still be sensitive to UV
light36. The absorption of UV light (375/28 nm) in the cornea and
lens of the mouse was estimated to be ~42%. The near UV light
responses in V1 in anaesthetized wild-type mice were measured
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 12a). It is clear that near UV light
triggered both LFP and spiking activities across V1 (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 12b, c), indicating that wild-type mice have vision in
UV37.
Recovery of the light sensitivity in awake-behaving mice. In
blind mice, the light-induced pupil constriction was largely
impaired due to the loss of photoreceptors in the retina (Fig. 8a).
Many retinal prosthesis studies use PLR to confirm the behavioral
recovery of light sensitivity34,38–40. We implanted NW arrays
subretinally into one eye of blind mice (Supplementary Fig. 13).
The PLR to near UV light in the implanted eye was improved
compared to that in the contralateral (control) eye at both 0.13
μW mm–2 and 0.25 µW mm–2 4–8 weeks after implant surgery
(Fig. 8b, Supplementary Movie 2 in the Supporting Information).
Likewise, the PLR to green light in the implanted eye was also
improved at both 0.13 μW mm–2 and 0.38 μW mm–2 (Fig. 8c, d,
Supplementary Movie 3 in the Supporting Information). Some of
the implanted eyes reached the same level of PLR as that in wild-
type mice, indicating the recovery of light sensitivity in multiple
colors.
Discussion
The rational design and fabrication of photoresponsive artificial
photoreceptors are important for developing advanced retinal
prosthetic devices. Several possible mechanisms including pho-
tovoltaic and photothermal stimulations have been investigated14.
Although it was recently reported that the photothermal effect by
direct infrared neural stimulation is an alternative for retina
prosthesis41, it requires the use of photoabsorbers in close
proximity of the target cells42. The Au nanoparticles synthesized
in our work have diameters of ~10 nm and are strongly bound to
TiO2 nanowire surfaces. Although the photo-thermal conversion
efficiency of small Au nanoparticles is high43, according to the-
oretical calculations, the temperature increase at the surface of Au
nanoparticles in water is substantially lower for Au nanoparticles
with diameters of 10 nm than those with diameters of 50 nm44.
Thus, the photothermal stimulation of RGCs from our 10-nm-
diameter Au nanoparticles should be minor. Instead, the Au
nanoparticles in our work enable efficient charge injection into
TiO2 nanowires upon photo-illumination. From our experimental
data, it is clear that the RGC responses are closely correlated to
the photocurrent stimulation of the Au-TiO2 nanowire systems.
In addition, the major responses from the UV regime confirm the
photovoltaic contribution of TiO2 nanowires for RGC stimula-
tion. Thus, the mechanism reported in this work is mainly
attributed to photovoltaic stimulation.
It is noted that the estimated receptive field was ~300 µm using
45 μm light spot. However, there was an increase in responsive
percentage of RGCs when the size of the stimulation light spot
was increased from 100 µm to 600 µm. The reason for the
increase in RGC response for larger light spot is due to the
increased photovoltaic current induced by larger light spot
(Supplementary Fig. 9a, b). On the other hand, photocurrent
induced by 45 μm light spot that was 300 µm away was too small
to induce RGC responses.
Compared to other materials, the 1D oriented NW arrays
mimic the morphology of rod and cone photoreceptors, and offer
several distinctive features. First, the unique 1D anisotropic
morphology of NW arrays provides an efficient photo-to-electric
conversion modality, similar to the NW arrays-based photo-
voltaic devices. The nanoscale length of the NW radial dimension
allows for fast separation of photogenerated carriers45. Mean-
while, the micron-scale length of the NW axial dimension can
efficiently absorb incident light with excellent photoabsorption
coefficients, with a thickness much smaller than normal photo-
receptor cell layers. As shown in the pupillary light reflex
experiment, the sensitivity of blind mice implanted with NW
arrays was similar to that in wild-type mice.
Second, the vertically oriented NW arrays are densely and
uniformly grown over the surface, which resemble photoreceptor
rods and cones in the outer retina layer. The space between
neighboring NW arrays is on the order of hundreds of nan-
ometers, and no electrodes or power supplies are needed, thus
allowing for a much higher spatial density (~10 NW arrays per
μm2) of active stimulation elements than most of the previously
reported photoresponsive surface. The calcium imaging experi-
ments in our work demonstrate that adjacent neurons can be
activated simultaneously by NW arrays. In addition, as shown in
our work, the feature size of light response can be as small as ~50
and ~300 μm for near UV and green light, respectively. Further
increase in the sensitivity of individual NW arrays may continue
to improve the spatial resolution.
Third, the rough morphologies of the vertically oriented NW
arrays are beneficial for direct interfacing with cultured neu-
rons46, retinal tissues or in vivo subretinal implant into live mice,
with good biocompatibility and photo/chemical stability for over
8 weeks. The interface between the vertically oriented NW arrays
and retinal cells/tissues leads to efficient light information pro-
cessing. Our in vivo experiments have suggested the possibility of
using NW arrays for chronic implant.
Fourth, although NW arrays used in present work have not
been capable for color vision, further development of multiple
nanowire types with different spectral responses may be a
potentially feasible strategy to realize such a scenario in the near
future. For example, color vision can become possible if 1) type A
nanowire is sensitive to red color and type B nanowire is sensitive
to green color; 2) type A nanowire induces smaller firing rate and
type B nanowire induces larger firing rate in RGC; 3) after
training, the visual cortex can rewire to recognize the difference in
RGC activities, and hence differentiate red color from green color.
In summary, we demonstrated a vertically oriented Au–TiO2
NW arrays as artificial photoreceptors, which absorbs light and
generates photovoltage, and consequently triggers spiking activ-
ities in the interfaced neurons and restore light responses in the
photoreceptor-degenerated
retina.
The
spatial
resolution
is
approaching or comparable to ~50 μm, and the size of receptive
field is comparable to that in wild-type mice. The light-response
inhibition by glutamatergic antagonists suggests the NW arrays-
interfaced retinas were capable of processing visual information
through innate retinal circuits. Moreover, functional and beha-
vioral restoration of light sensitivity has been demonstrated with
subretinal implant of the Au–TiO2 NW arrays in blind mice,
suggesting the possibility for using NW arrays as prosthetic
devices.
Methods
Synthesis of TiO2 and Au–TiO2 nanowire arrays. TiO2 NW arrays were verti-
cally grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (Wuhan Ge-Ao Ltd.,
China) or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates by a hydrothermal method, in
which tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) was used for the Ti precursor. In a typical
synthesis, 0.1 g of Ti foil and 18 mL of 0.1 M HCl solution were put into a Teflon-
lined stainless steel autoclave with a total volume of 25 mL. The PDMS elastomer
was then immersed into the solution after ultrasonic cleaning for 30 min in a 1:1:1
(v/v/v) mixture of acetone, ethanol and deionized (DI) water. The hydrothermal
synthesis was conducted at 150 °C for 12 h in an electric oven. For the Au-TiO2

 NW arrays synthesis, after the fabrication of TiO2 NW arrays, Au nanoparticles
were deposited on TiO2 NW arrays by a solution reduction approach. Briefly, an
FTO substrate with TiO2 NW arrays was soaked into 0.01 M HAuCl4 (with pH
tuned to 4.5 by adding 0.2 M NaOH) for 2 h. The sample was then thoroughly
washed by DI water, dried in air and annealed in air at 300 °C for 2 h. For in vivo
implantation and measurement, after nanowire synthesis, the side of FTO substrate
grown with TiO2 nanowires was pre-covered with a thin layer of poly-
methylmethacrylate (PMMA) and incubated at 85 °C for 5 min. Then, the FTO
substrates were etched in a hydrogen fluoride solution (20%) for ~9 h to reduce the
thickness of FTO substrates to below 100 μm, followed by removal of PMMA in
aceton.
Photoelectric measurement. The photoelectric measurement was carried out
using a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., USA) with a
3-electrode system, in which the Au–TiO2 NW arrays photoanode, a coiled Pt wire
and an Ag/AgCl were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes,
respectively. The photoanode was illuminated under 100 mW cm–2 of simulated
sunlight, using a solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp and an AM
1.5 G filter (94022A, Newport Inc., USA). A phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4)
was used as the electrolytes. Different filters were applied to obtain UV (375/28 nm,
full intensity 133 μW mm–2), blue (470/20 nm, full intensity 691 μW mm–2) and
green light (546/12 nm, full intensity 470 μW mm–2).
Animals and genotyping. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Shanghai Public
Health Clinical Center. Wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice were obtained from the Slac
Laboratory Animal Co. (Shanghai, China). All animals were raised and bred at
25°C, 50% relative humidity, 12 hours light and dark cycles. For sorting the cl
positive and rd1 homozygote mice, two pairs of primers and a restriction enzyme
(ThermoFisher, HpyF3I (DdeI)) which recognizes C^TNAG sites were used. To
differentiate rd1−/− and rd1-/+, primers 5′-CATCCCACCTGAGCTCACA-
GAAAG-3′ and 5′-GCCTACAACAGAGGAGCTTCTAGC-3′ were used. After
digestion, homozygote mice had 2 mutant bands: 126 bp and 155 bp. Heterozygous
mice had two mutant bands and a wild-type band. Mutant bands at 126 bp and
wild-type band at 301 bp. To distinguish cl (also called cone-DTA) knockout and
wild-type, primers 5′-CAAGGAAATTATGACGATGATTGG-3′ and
5′-GGCTTGAGCCATATACTCATACATCGC-3′ were used with mutant band at
about 450 bp. Mice used in experiments were either male or female and from
multiple litters. All the mice were more than 7 weeks old, and more specific ages
could be seen in the corresponding sections of Methods. Sample size was chosen to
be larger than 5 for statistical analysis. In some cases, due to the limited number of
available mice, sample size was 4, and no statistical analysis was conducted. Since
our experiments were designed to look for all-or-none response, we did not ran-
domize our samples. No specific blinding was done in the in vitro and in vivo
electrophysiology recordings and Ca2+ imaging experiments since all data analysis
was conducted using automated methods. Blinding was conducted between PLR
experiment and data analysis.
Retinal tissue preparation. Mice were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (0.3
mL per 100 g weight). One eye was enucleated and rapidly placed in Ringer’s
solution consisting of (in mM) NaCl 124, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 2, NaH2PO4
1.25, NaHCO3 26 and glucose 22, pH 7.35 and oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5%
CO2. Then the retina was dissected and placed on a filter paper (MerckMillipore,
Germany) in the recording chamber.
Photo-stimulation. Light stimulation was performed on a setup consisting of a
Zeiss upright DIC microscope (Examiner A1, Zeiss, Germany). Near UV, blue and
green light were generated from the mercury lamp (X-Cite 120, Lumen Dynamics,
USA), filtered by fluorescence cubes (UV: 375/28 nm; Green: 546/12 nm; Blue: 470/
20 nm, Zeiss Inc., Germany) and provided through the ×40 water-immersion
objective. A circular illumination spot around neurons was obtained by passing
light through a pin hole and focusing the light with a water immersion ×40
objective.
Patch-clamp recording of retinal ganglion cells. Action potentials were recorded
using MultiClamp 700B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA), and
digitized by Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices, USA) under DIC microscope (Zeiss,
Germany) at room temperature. A glass pipette (5–10 MΩ) was pulled by P-97
micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, USA) filled with internal solution (in mM,
potassium gluconate 105, KCl 5, CaCl2 0.5, MgCl2 2, EGTA 5, HEPES 10, Mg-ATP
4, GTP-Na 0.5, sodium phosphocreatine 7, Lucifer Yellow 0.05%, PH 7.4). pClamp
10 (Molecular Devices, USA) was used for data analysis. The investigator was
blinded to the group allocation when analyzing the light-response of RGCs but not
during the patch-clamp experiment. Dendritic arbors of RGCs were labeled by
filling the patch pipette with Lucifer Yellow and imaged after the whole-cell patch
clamp experiment. The distance d from the tip of the longest arbor to the center of
the cell body was measured. The size of the dendritic arborizations was calculated
by πd2. The concentrations for glutamate receptor antagonists were: L-AP4: 50 µM,
D-AP5: 50 µM, NBQX: 20 µM.
Intravitreous injection and Ca2+ imaging in vitro. The mice were anesthetized
by 2% chloral hydrate (0.2 mL per 10 g weight). 1 μL AAV-syn-GCaMP6s virus
were injected into the retina of rd1/cDTA knockout mice at P28 using NanoJectII
(Drummond scientific company, Germany). Expression of GCaMP6s in the retina
started 2 weeks after the injection surgery. After 3-4 weeks, expression reached the
optimal level and retinas were dissected for imaging experiments. A series of
fluorescent images were captured and collected at 10 Hz (512 × 512 pixels) by Flash
4.0 (Hamamatsu, Japan) at room temperature, and were analyzed by ImageJ
software. ΔF/F0 was calculated as (F–F0)/F0. F0 was equal to the mean of fluores-
cence signals from the first 5 frames.
Immunohistochemistry. Retina was fixed in 4% PFA for 5−7 h at 4 °C immedi-
ately after dissection. For retina slice immunohistochemistry, 10% (30 min, room
temperature), 20% (30 min, room temperature) and 30% (overnight, 4 °C) sucrose
were used to dehydrate the fixed retina. The retina was embedded in OCT com-
pound (Sakura) and stored at −80 °C for more than 2 h. Fourteen-micrometer
slices were cut (Leica CM 1950, Leica, Germany) and washed 3 times for 15 min
with 0.05 M TBS to wash away the OCT. After immersing slices in 0.5% Triton-X-
100 for 20 min, slices were incubated in a blocking solution consisting 10% Donkey
serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, USA), 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and
0.05% Triton-X-100 in 0.05 M TBS (DST) for 2 h at room temperature. Then slices
were immediately covered by the primary antibody (ANTI-Choline Acetyl-
transferase antibody47, MILLIPORE (AB144P), 1:200) solution and hybridization
for 20–24 h at 4 °C. The slices were then washed 6 times for 10 min in TBS to get
rid of the primary antibody, followed by incubated with secondary antibody
(Donkey anti-Goat conjugated to Alexa Flour 594, 1:300, Jackson ImmunoR-
esearch, USA) at room temperature for 2 h in dark. After removing the secondary
antibody and washing 3 times for 10 min, the slices were stained in 1:3000 DAPI
solution for 10 min and washed 3 times for 10 min. Slices were air dried and
mounted. Fluorescent images were taken under epifluorescence microscope
(Olympus, Japan).
The immunohistochemistry protocol for whole-mount retinas was similar to
that in the retinal slices. After patch-clamp recording, retinas were fixed in 4% PFA
for 5−7 h at 4 °C, washed by TBS, incubated in 0.5% Triton-X-100 for 30 min,
blocked by 10% DST for 3 h at room temperature. The retina was then transferred
into the primary antibody (ANTI-GFP antibody48, Avēs Labs Inc. (GFP-1020),
1:1000; ANTI-Brn3a antibody49, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC-31984), 1:500;
ANTI-Lucifer Yellow antibody50 Invitrogen (A5750), 1:500) solution and
incubated for 24−30 h at 4 °C. After washing in TBS, retinas were transferred to the
secondary antibody (Donkey anti-Chicken conjugated to Alexa Flour 488, 1:300,
Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA; Donkey anti-Goat conjugated to Alexa Flour 594,
1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA; Donkey anti-Rabbit conjugated to Alexa
Flour 488, 1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) solution for 3 h at room
temperature in the dark. After the secondary antibody was washed off, whole-
mounted retinas were air dried and mounted by Fluruomount-G (Southern
Biotech, USA). Fluorescent images were obtained by fluorescence imaging
microscope (Eclipse Ni, Nikon Inc, Japan) and confocal multi-photon scanning
microscope (AIR-MP, Nikon Inc, Japan) and analyzed in ImageJ software 1.48v
(NIH) and NIS-Elements AR software ver. 4.30.01 (Nikon Inc).
Surgery for in vivo electrophysiology recording. Mice aged at P56 were deeply
anaesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen for 20 min before the surgery. The
nose and mouth of the mice were placed in a respiratory mask infused with 0.5
−1% isoflurane. The mice were kept on a heating pad (FHC Inc., USA), followed
by subcutaneous injection of 1% lidocaine (10 mg mL–1 lidocaine in saline; MP
Biomedicals, USA) under the scalp. After removal of the scalp, the front and back
of the skull were glued onto two copper rods and assembled onto a rotatable
mounting platform. A craniotomy window in the skull was created stereotaxically
in V1 (3.1−4.2 mm posterior to bregma and 2.0−3.2 mm lateral, at a depth of
300–500 μm), and the dura was removed carefully. The craniotomy was filled with
warm (37 °C) sterile buffered saline (150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.4) throughout the experiment. The recording platform was set up on a
rotatable base (Thorlabs Inc., USA). The platform was adjusted such that the
craniotomy plane was vertical to the electrodes.
Visual stimuli and in vivo electrophysiology recordings. Isoflurane anesthesia
was adjusted to 0.5% to maintain a stable respiratory rate. Visual stimuli were
consisted of 1 s UV light with various intensities followed by 59 s non-stimulation
period. The whole-eye UV stimulus were produced by mercury lamp at various
intensities and last for 1.06 s. For multielectrode array recordings, neuronal signals
were recorded in V1 using a 4 × 4 microelectrode array interfaced with Power 1401
(Cambridge Electronic Design, UK). Platinum/Iridium (70%/30%) opto-MEA (1
MΩ, 250 μm apart, Microprobes, USA) was inserted into L2/3 of primary visual
cortex. Electrical signals were amplified (Microelectrode AC Amplifier 1800, A-M
Systems, Inc., USA), high-pass filtered at 1 Hz and sampled at 10 kHz using Power
1401. Spike activity was high pass filtered at 300 Hz. We used 5 times the number
of standard deviation (sigmas) in the mean of the peak height histogram to
threshold the spike signals. Multi-unit spikes were initially clustered using K-means
in Offline sorter (Plexon Inc., USA) and manually grouped similar clusters if

 necessary. Firing rates were calculated in Neuroexplorer (Plexon Inc., USA) and
peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were plotted in Spike2 software (Cam-
bridge Electronic Design, UK).
Implant surgery. Eight to ten weeks old rd1/cDTA (blind mice) were anaes-
thetized. Up and down eyelids were suture to fix the eye-ball in proper position
which is suitable for implantation. The mice were then fixed on the stereotaxic
aparatus. A small cut was made in the sclera, 1–2 μL of 0.9% sodium chloride
solution was injected quickly and carefully by nano-ject (Drummond Instrument)
to leave enough space for NW arrays implantation. After that, an expansion cut
was quickly made at about 45–60 angle to the nasal-temporal axis. The size of the
cut was determined by the size of the substrate for NW arrays. The typical area of
the implanted NW arrays is 0.5 mm2–1.5 mm2. The substrate was held by a sharp
tweezer and inserted into the cut under microscope. After the implantation, wash
the eye-all by 0.9% sodium chloride solution and remove the suture to retract the
eye-ball. Mice were put back to the home cage to recover.
Retinal tissue preparation for scanning electron microscope. Eye-balls were
extracted about 5 days after NW arrays implantation. The lens was removed and
the remaining eye-cup was fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C overnight, dehydrated in 30%,
50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, and 100% ethanol for 1 h in each solution, and air-dried at
room temperature. The retina was trimmed to reveal the edge of the tissue before
SEM.
Pupillary light reflex. Metal plates were implanted onto the skull of mice prior to
behavioral experiments. Following 2 hours of dark adaption, unanaesthetized mice
(over 50 days old) were head-fixed through metal plates under infrared illumina-
tion. Light stimuli were provided by an ultra violet LED (peaked at 395 nm), as well
as green LED (peaked at around 560 nm), to one eye, while a near-infrared camera
(JAI, Denmark) recorded the response from the same eye. Light intensities were
measured at the cornea using an optical power meter (Thorlabs, USA). Each ses-
sion was recorded at 62 Hz frame rate for 1 minute, starting 5 s before a 20 s light
stimulus. Pupil areas were measured using ImageJ (NIH, USA). Percentage of pupil
constrictions was calculated as
1� amin
a0
�
�
´ 100% (amin: minimum pupil area during
light exposure; a0: pupil area immediately prior to light exposure). One mouse was
excluded from pupillary light reflex analysis due to frequent spontaneous pupillary
constriction which disrupted the judge of light reflex.
Statistics. All data are represented as mean and S.E.M. The differences were tested
by OriginPro software ver. 9.0.0 (Hewlett–Packard Company) and SPSS software
version 23.0 (IBM). All comparisons were made by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-
tests, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Chi-square tests, except for the PLR
experiments where paired two-tailed Student’s t-tests or two-sided Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests were used. All data met the assumptions of the test for dis-
tribution with similar variance statistically compared. P values <0.05 were con-
sidered significant.
