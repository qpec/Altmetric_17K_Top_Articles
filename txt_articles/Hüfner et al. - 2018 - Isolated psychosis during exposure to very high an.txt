Background. Psychotic episodes during exposure to very high or extreme altitude have been
frequently reported in mountain literature, but not systematically analysed and acknowledged
as a distinct clinical entity.
Methods. Episodes reported above 3500 m altitude with possible psychosis were collected
from the lay literature and provide the basis for this observational study. Dimensional criteria
of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders were used for psychosis, and the
Lake Louise Scoring criteria for acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral oedema
(HACE). Eighty-three of the episodes collected underwent a cluster analysis to identify similar
groups. Ratings were done by two independent, trained researchers (κ values 0.6–1).
Findings. Cluster 1 included 51% (42/83) episodes without psychosis; cluster 2 22% (18/83)
cases with psychosis, plus symptoms of HACE or mental status change from other origins;
and cluster 3 28% (23/83) episodes with isolated psychosis. Possible risk factors of psychosis
and associated somatic symptoms were analysed between the three clusters and revealed
differences regarding the factors ‘starvation’ (χ2 test, p = 0.002), ‘frostbite’ ( p = 0.024) and
‘supplemental oxygen’ ( p = 0.046). Episodes with psychosis were reversible but associated
with near accidents and accidents ( p = 0.007, odds ratio 4.44).
Conclusions. Episodes of psychosis during exposure to high altitude are frequently reported,
but have not been specifically examined or assigned to medical diagnoses. In addition to the
risk of suffering from somatic mountain illnesses, climbers and workers at high altitude
should be aware of the potential occurrence of psychotic episodes, the associated risks and
respective coping strategies.
Introduction
‘I first met Jimmy on the Balcony, a cold windswept snow shelf high up on the southeast ridge of Mount
Everest. At an altitude of more than 8200 meters our introduction had been brief, with little more than a
muffled “hello” and a few words of encouragement passing between us. Over my right shoulder, obscured
by the bulky oxygen mask and the rim of down that smothered my face, I was sure I could see Jimmy moving
lightly in the darkness. But despite him remaining close by me for the rest of the day, I didn’t see him again’
(Windsor, 2008).
A wealth of personal accounts are available in non-medical literature relating to mountaineer-
ing, mainly describing symptoms of psychosis while exposed to very high (3500–5500 m) and
extreme (>5500 m) altitude. Psychosis has been proposed to benefit climbers where hallucina-
tions consisted of voices or people encouraging them towards survival behaviour, however, it
can also prove detrimental, resulting in potential misjudgements of dangerous scenarios. The
dimensional assessment of psychosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) includes the fol-
lowing core symptoms: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, abnormal psychomotor
behaviour and negative symptoms; and additionally impaired cognition, depression and mania
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Barch et al. 2013). Psychosis is a hallmark of schizo-
phrenia, but can also occur in mood or substance abuse disorders, or as part of the syndrome
of organic brain dysfunction (classified as delirium in DSM-5) (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013).
The professional medical knowledge and climbers’ awareness of somatic high-altitude
(HA)-related symptoms has increased over the past decades, but research on HA psychosis
is still scarce. Available reports currently only consist of the analyses of hallucinations or

 delirium in individual cases or case series (Ryn, 1988; Brugger
et al. 1999; Basnyat, 2002), plus the description of hallucinations
in the context of HA cerebral oedema (HACE) (Wu et al. 2006).
By many authors, HACE is considered an extension of acute
mountain sickness (AMS) (Hackett & Roach, 2004), but it is
now proposed that the continuum of AMS-HACE comprises
more than one pathophysiological process (Hall et al. 2014).
HACE is diagnosed in persons with AMS who also demonstrate
ataxia or mental status changes, such as lethargy/lassitude,
which can progress to delirium, coma and death (Hackett &
Roach, 2004). The reported incidence of HACE varies signifi-
cantly, probably due to differences in diagnostic criteria and
assessment methods as well as limited epidemiological research
(Hackett & Roach, 2004). HACE is very rarely reported below
4000 m and the lowest reported altitude of incidence is 2100 m
(Hackett & Roach, 2004). Most studies report incidences of
0.1–2.0% at altitudes between 3500 and 5500 m (Hochstrasser
et al. 1986; Hackett et al. 1998; Wu et al. 2006), but in situations
of fast ascent numbers as high as 31% have been found (Basnyat
et al. 2000). In the absence of appropriate treatment or rapid des-
cent HACE often leads to death within 24 h (Willmann et al.
2014). By contrast, those people who describe symptoms of
psychosis in personal accounts in the available lay literature
related to mountaineering, have returned from the mountain
safely without professional rescue and lacking neurological
sequelae.
The primary aim of this study was to assess the frequency of
HA psychosis and its association with AMS and HACE, or mental
status change from other origins. The primary hypothesis was that
isolated psychotic episodes may occur at HA without signs and
symptoms of AMS or HACE and therefore can be defined as
an independent HA-related pathology. Secondarily, the potential
risk factors and somatic comorbidities of HA psychosis and its
potential association with near accidents or accidents were
evaluated.
Methods
Included cases
The basis for inclusion was a survey of the lay literature relating to
mountaineering performed via a search on ‘Amazon.de’ (accessed
on 25 July 2014) using the German keyword ‘Bergsteigen’ (moun-
taineering) and the filter ‘Biographien und Erinnerungen’ (biog-
raphy and history). The results were sorted by relevance and
the first 100 hits were analysed. Additionally, the authors of the
study contributed books from their private collections for analyses
(Supplemental Material 1). Episodes were identified and extracted
from the literature via the following criteria: (1) the minimum
altitude of 3500 m was reached; (2a) a detailed description of
the episode with at least three somatic or psychiatric criteria
(regardless if pathological or normal) were present; or (2b) a
significant change in the course of the tour occurred that was
not attributable to external circumstances (i.e. turning back,
change of target, accident or near accident).
Qualitative data analysis
One hundred and two identified episodes were digitised, num-
bered and imported in to MAXQDA® (Verbi GmbH, Berlin,
Germany). Codes for each symptom or factor were defined and
marked in the text. Data from two independent, trained raters
were then exported into Microsoft Exel®. In cases of divergent
ratings, a third rater was involved. The inter-rater reliability
was calculated (Cohen’s κ) using SPSS® software. Inter-rater κ
was substantial (0.60–0.79) to outstanding (>0.80) for all rated
symptoms or factors (Landis & Koch, 1977).
Demographic and tour-related information
Demographic factors and tour-related information were recorded:
name of the mountain/mountain range; altitude at which episode
occurred (in meters); altitude gain on the day before the symp-
toms occurred [⩽400 m altitude gain, >400 m altitude gain, not
available (NA): factor ‘ascent’]; duration of episodes (shorter
than 1, 1–24, 1–7 days, >1 week, NA: factor ‘duration’); whether
the subject was alone (YES/NO/NA: factor ‘alone’) or in a situ-
ation of acute danger (YES/NO/NA: factor ‘danger’) when the
symptoms occurred, or if the episode was self-reported or
observed (YES/NO/NA: factor ‘self-report’).
Scoring of psychiatric symptoms
DSM-5 dimensional criteria (as reflected in the Clinician-Rated
Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity Scale, CRDPSS)
were used for assessment of psychosis (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013; Barch et al. 2013). The CRDPSS includes the
following
symptoms:
hallucinations,
delusions,
disorganised
speech, abnormal psychomotor behaviour, negative symptoms,
impaired cognition, depression and mania. Each symptom was
assessed as either present (YES) or absent (NO), or alternatively
if no information was available on this specific symptom (NA).
According to DSM-5, at least two criteria had to be present for
the diagnosis of psychosis, with one of them being delusions,
hallucinations or disorganised speech (primary symptoms of
psychosis) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
Additionally, the following sub-categories were rated as fol-
lows: (i) for hallucinations the modality (visual, acoustic, somaes-
thetic, olfactoric, gustatory, third person phenomenon), plus the
individual’s personal connotation of the episode (positive, neu-
tral, negative); (ii) for abnormal psychomotor behaviour, whether
there was a decrease or increase; and (iii) for negative symptoms,
whether there was a decrease in motivation, communication or
affective expression. Since the whole spectrum of cognitive abil-
ities cannot be extracted from a written description, formal
thought disorders (slowed, accelerated, automated or disorga-
nised), which have been shown to correlate with cognition in
psychosis, were also assessed (Subotnik et al. 2006). Anxiety
was added as an additional point. Illusions and depersonalisation
were grouped together with hallucinations as perceptional
disturbances.
Associated somatic conditions and diagnosis of AMS and HACE
The Lake Louise Scoring (LLS) system was designed to evaluate
adults for symptoms of AMS. Symptoms include headache,
gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue and/or weakness, dizziness/
lightheadedness and difficulty sleeping (Roach et al. 1993). If pre-
sent, each symptom was rated according to LLS from 0 to 3. The
diagnosis of AMS was made if two items were present and LLS ⩾3
(Roach et al. 1993). We used a modified version of the LLS in
which, contrary to the conventional scoring criteria, headache
was not used as a compulsory symptom since its presence or
absence was not consistently reported in the text. This is in line

 with John West who stated that ‘the basic Lake Louise procedure
could be used without the requirement that headache be essential’
(West, 2011). According to LLS, the diagnosis of HACE was made
in persons with AMS and at least one of the following symptoms
of mental status change: lethargy/lassitude, disorientation/confu-
sion, stupor/semi-consciousness (Roach et al. 1993). Additional
somatic conditions such as breathing problems, frostbite, snow
blindness, starvation and use of supplementary oxygen were
recorded (YES/NO/NA).
Assessment of accidents
It was scored whether there was an accident or near accident
(YES/NO/NA). Accidents which occurred fatefully, such as ava-
lanches or collapses of seracs, were not recorded.
Statistical analysis
To identify similar groups and to assign them to diagnoses, we
performed a cluster analysis using the SPSS® Two Step clustering
method (SPSS Inc., 2007). In order to reveal natural clusters
within the dataset, the most important factors from a theoretical
point of view were identified. This included all symptoms listed in
the CRDPSS, anxiety, tour-related factors and somatic conditions.
Firstly, the clustering procedure was performed on the whole list
of factors, and for the final phase, we chose the factors with the
value of importance higher than 0.4 (see Table 1 for details).
Nominal variables were analysed using χ2 test and z-test to
compare column proportions. Continuous variables were ana-
lysed using Kruskal–Wallis test. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated
to evaluate the association of disease with accidents or near acci-
dents. P < 0.05 was considered significant in all analyses.
Results
Identification of three distinct symptom clusters
Data were collected from 60 subjects describing 102 episodes.
Using cluster analysis, we identified three distinct clusters of
symptoms in 83 episodes, in which complete information on all
clustering variables was available (Table 1). Cluster 1 included
episodes without psychosis ‘no psychosis’ (PSYNO), cluster 2
episodes with psychosis plus symptoms of mental status change
‘psychosis plus’ (PSYPLUS) and cluster 3 episodes with psychosis
without symptoms of HACE or mental status change from
other origins ‘isolated psychosis’ (PSYISO). In the PSYPLUS cluster,
psychosis co-occurred with HACE in 16% (13/83) of episodes,
while in 6% (5/83) of episodes, it occurred together with mental
status change from other origins (Fig. 1).
Subject and mountain-related data
The mean number of episodes per subject was 1.9 (range 1–8),
82% (68/83) of the episodes occurred in males and 18% (15/83)
in females; with no difference between the three clusters (χ2 test,
p = 0.296). The mean age of subjects was 34.2 ± 8.4 (mean ± S.D.)
years (Kruskal–Wallis test, p = 0.315). The altitude at which epi-
sodes occurred was 7280 m ± 1293 (mean ± S.D.; Kruskal–Wallis
test, p = 0.932). The duration of episodes differed between the
three clusters (χ2 test, p = 0.031), with episodes in the PSYPLUS
cluster lasting longer than those in the PSYNO and PSYISO clusters
(z-test < 0.05 for PSYNO a, PSYPLUS b, PSYISO a; Fig. 2). Psychotic
episodes were fully reversible. Most of the episodes occurred in
the Himalayas [55% (46/83)] and Karakorum [34% (28/83);
Supplemental Material 2].
Frequency of HACE and AMS
AMS occurred in 48% (40/83) of episodes and the frequency did
not differ significantly between the three clusters (χ2 test, p =
0.053). HACE occurred in 23% (19/83) of episodes: in 10%
(6/42) of episodes in the PSYNO cluster, in 72% (13/18) of epi-
sodes in the PSYPLUS cluster and in 0% (0/23) of episodes with
isolated psychosis (χ2 test, p = 0.000, z-test < 0.05 for PSYNO a,
PSYPLUS b, PSYISO a).
Analysis of symptoms of psychosis across the different
symptom clusters
We analysed the distribution of different symptoms of psychosis
across the three clusters (Table 2). Overall, hallucinations were
found in 42% (35/83) and perceptional disturbances (hallucina-
tions, depersonalisation and illusions) in 58% (48/83) of episodes.

 Perceptional disturbances were perceived as neutral in 60% (29/
48), as helpful or comforting in 23% (11/48) and as frightening
or dangerous in 17% (8/48).
Risk factors and characteristics of episodes with psychosis
The distribution of potential risk factors of psychosis and accom-
panying somatic symptoms across the three clusters was analysed
(Table 3).
The association of psychosis with near accidents or accidents
We analysed the distribution of accidents and near accidents
across the clusters: 12% (5/42) of cases were associated with
accidents or near accidents in the PSYNO cluster, 59% (10/17,
one missing) in PSYPLUS and 22% (5/23) in PSYISO (χ2 test,
p = 0.001, z-test < 0.05 for PSYNO
a, PSYPLUS
b, PSYISO
a).
Overall, episodes without psychosis (cluster 1) were compared
with episodes with psychosis (clusters 2 + 3). The latter were
associated with a higher number of near accidents and accidents
[cluster 1 12% (5/42), clusters 2 + 3 38% (15/40, one missing),
χ2 test, p = 0.007, OR 4.44]. Episodes where individuals were con-
sidered to display symptomology congruent with AMS were not
associated with a higher number of accidents or near accidents
compared with episodes without AMS [28% (11/40) v. 21%
(9/42, one missing), χ2 test, p = 0.522, OR 1.28]. While episodes
where individuals were considered to display symptomology con-
gruent with HACE showed higher number of accidents and near
accidents compared with episodes without HACE [42% (8/19)
v. 19% (12/63, one missing), χ2 test, p = 0.04, OR 3.09].
Discussion
The major findings of the present study are: (1) psychosis occurs
during exposure to HA; (2) it can occur in isolation, or together
with HACE or mental status change of other origins (e.g. infec-
tion, dehydration); (3) isolated HA psychosis should thus be con-
sidered as a separate HA-related disease (Fig. 1); (4) HA psychosis
is associated with an increased rate of near accidents and
accidents.
The incidence of psychosis was not formally assessed in previ-
ous studies, but the occurrence of hallucinations, one of the core
features, was very variable in the literature: Wu et al. (2006)
reported hallucinations in 3% of cases with HACE, while
Wilson et al. (2009) reported them in 32% of climbers above
7500 m and Brugger et al. (1999) found hallucinatory experiences
in seven of eight (88%) world-class climbers who reached alti-
tudes above 8500 m without supplementary oxygen. In the pre-
sent study, hallucinations occurred in 42% (35/83) of episodes
at a mean altitude of 7280 m; of these episodes in 34% (12/35),
the hallucinations occurred together with HACE. Considering
the severity and high mortality of HACE, it is most likely that hal-
lucinations and/or psychosis can also occur outside of HACE. In
many of our rated episodes, plus in the personal account of one of
the co-authors (I.T. Supplemental Material 3), and also in the
study by Brugger et al., alpinists with symptoms of psychosis des-
cended unaided from the mountain and showed no permanent
neurological sequelae (Brugger et al. 1999); thus, it is unlikely
that they suffered from HACE. Isolated HA psychosis could be
related to the syndrome of transient HA neurological dysfunction,
which has been previously proposed as a separate complication at
HA, distinct from HACE (Firth & Bolay, 2004).
It has long been recognised that signs and symptoms of psych-
osis are on a continuum with normal mental states (Allardyce
et al. 2007), and that there is an individual susceptibility towards
hallucinations
and
psychosis
also
in
healthy
individuals
(Morrison et al. 2002). Possible mechanisms behind HA-related
psychosis could be social and sensory deprivation in conjunction
with psychological stress (Daniel & Mason, 2015), as well as dys-
function of the temporoparietal junction and angular gyrus due to
hypoxia, hypoglycaemia and cold (Lempert et al. 1994; Feddersen
et al. 2007). Imaging alterations in HACE include the white

 matter particularly in the splenium of the corpus callosum
(Hackett & Roach, 2004), which has been implicated in the devel-
opment of psychosis in patients at risk of schizophrenia (von
Hohenberg et al. 2014). Research in animal models has shown
that moderate hypoxia (12.5% oxygen) increases dopamine
(79%) and serotonin (26%) in the extracellular fluid of the rat stri-
atum and both neurotransmitters remain elevated even after the
initial reintroduction of normoxic air (Broderick & Gibson,
1989). Both dopamine and serotonin metabolism are linked to
hallucinations (Rolland et al. 2014), and there is evidence of
altered availability of these neurotransmitters in psychosis, also
in the context of schizophrenia (Geyer & Vollenweider, 2008;
Howes & Kapur, 2009).
While perceptional disturbances were perceived as neutral or
helpful/comforting by the majority of afflicted subjects in the cur-
rent study, such psychiatric symptoms can also be detrimental as
the association of psychosis with accidents and near accidents
showed. This is in line with a previous study, showing that
cognitive disturbances (no exact specification of symptoms) may
predict death on Mount Everest (Firth et al. 2008). Though acci-
dents due to objective dangers such as avalanches or serac col-
lapses were not recorded in the current study, in some cases,
their inclusion could have been justified owing to poor route
selection
or
climbing
in
unsuitable
conditions
due
to
psychosis-induced errors of judgement.
The incidence of HACE is mostly reported to be about 0.1–2%
at altitudes between 3500 and 5500 m (Hochstrasser et al. 1986;
Hackett et al. 1998; Wu et al. 2006), but in situations of fast ascent
numbers as high as 31% have been found (Basnyat et al. 2000). In
our study, HACE was present in 23% of episodes. The reported
differences in HACE incidence in the literature are probably due
to heterogeneous populations, in addition to possible differences
in diagnostic criteria or differences in evaluated altitudes. The
mean altitude in the present study was above 7000 m, while
other studies examined much lower altitudes (Basnyat et al.
2000; Hackett & Roach, 2004; Wu et al. 2006). The most

 important aspect for diverging incidences seems to be that AMS
and HACE are two extremes of a continuum, and that the cut-off
point where severe ‘AMS’ symptomology is called ‘HACE’ is not
always easy to determine. HACE could be underdiagnosed in
the field as mountaineers may ignore minor alterations of the
mental status. In some cases, the diagnosis will be made only
once mental status is severely impaired or coma occurs (Wu
et al. 2006), which is considered the final stage of HACE before
death (Hackett & Roach, 2004). This could also be due to the
nature of the diagnostic criteria of mental status change used for
the diagnosis of HACE. While ‘coma’ is relatively easy to diagnose,
the judgement on ‘lethargy’ will differ between evaluators: it would
be clearer if the quantitative changes in consciousness were rated,
e.g. according to the Glascow Coma Scale. ‘Psychological changes’,
including emotional changes or irrational behaviour (27%), and
disturbances in consciousness (79%), are common in HACE and
are considered indicative of organic brain dysfunction (Ryn, 1988;
Wu et al. 2006) (classified as delirium in DSM-5). HA-related
organic brain dysfunction (delirium), with or without psychosis,
can also occur without HACE (Ryn, 1988; Basnyat, 2002). Such
cases were also identified in the current study (Fig. 1). Possible
underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are hypothermia, infection,
medication or dehydration; however, these aspects have not been
investigated in the current study (Pendlebury et al. 2015).
Additional psychiatric symptoms such as mania, depression or anx-
iety were also assessed in the current study and showed elevated
prevalence at HA: a finding in line with previous reports (Ryn,
1988; Shukitt-Hale et al. 1991; de Aquino Lemos et al. 2012).
There are several limitations to the present study. The most evi-
dent limitation is the method of data collection; inter-rater κs were,
however, very consistent. This was mostly attributable to the train-
ing of the raters. The way in which the literature search was con-
ducted (i.e. the use of German key words in the German site of
an online book shop) is a potential limitation; it would also be inter-
esting to include the American book market. Within this study, we
assume that there is an inherent bias because episodes with psych-
osis are more likely to be reported. Additionally, due to the inclu-
sion of retrospective accounts within this study, there also exists a
bias for survival, since only people surviving the climb can later
report their symptoms. We addressed this question by analysing
whether there was a difference in self-report and observed episodes.
In conclusion, psychosis can occur at very high and extreme
altitude, and reportedly in the absence of other signs and symp-
toms of HACE. Isolated HA psychosis should thus be considered
a distinct and separate HA-related syndrome. It is important to
inform subjects who intend to go to HA about the possibility of
psychosis, in addition to the well-recognised somatic HA disor-
ders. This should be part of the information campaign for HA tra-
vellers. Cognitive strategies (e.g. reality testing, Smailes et al. 2015)
should be considered and practiced beforehand. This information
has the potential to increase safety at HA, especially when with a
partner or in a group. These findings are not only important for
climbers and mountaineers but also for occupational HA work.
To better describe HA psychosis, to determine its incidence,
risk and trigger factors, treatment and patient’s outcome, a pro-
spective observational study should be performed. Additionally,
in vitro studies could further ameliorate knowledge of the under-
lying pathophysiology. Since isolated psychosis at altitude shows
some clinical features similar to schizophrenia, it could potentially
serve as a reversible model of the disease; thus aiding in the inves-
tigation of pathophysiological concepts or new treatments for
schizophrenia and related disorders.
