Abstract
Importance—Medication adherence is essential to diabetes care. Patient-provider language 
barriers may impact medication adherence among Latinos.
Objective—Determine the role of patient ethnicity, preferred language, and provider language 
concordance on adherence to newly prescribed diabetes medications.
Design—Observational study, 2006–2012.
Setting—Large, integrated health care delivery system with professional interpreter services.
Participants—Insured patients with type 2 diabetes, including English-speaking whites, English-
speaking Latinos, or Limited English proficiency (LEP) Latinos with newly prescribed diabetes 
medication.
Exposures—Patient ethnicity, preferred language, and provider self-reported Spanish language 
fluency.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Primary non-adherence (never dispensed), early stage non-
persistence (dispensed only once), late stage non-persistence (received ≥2 dispensings, but 
discontinued within 24 months), inadequate overall medication adherence (>20% time without 
sufficient medication supply during 24 months after initial prescription) based on new prescription 
medication gaps (NPMG).

 Results—Participants included 21,878 whites, 5,755 English-speaking Latinos, and 3,205 LEP 
Latinos with 46,131 prescriptions for new diabetes medications. Among LEP Latinos, 50.2% had 
a primary care provider reporting high Spanish fluency. For oral medications, early adherence 
varied substantially: 32.2% of LEP Latinos, 27.2% of English-speaking Latinos and 18.3% of 
whites were either primary non-adherent or early non-persistent (p<0.05). Inadequate overall 
adherence was observed in 60.2% of LEP Latinos, 51.7% of English-speaking Latinos and 37.5% 
of whites. For insulin, early stage non-persistence was 42.8% among LEP Latinos, 34.4% among 
English-speaking Latinos, and 28.5 % among whites (p<0.05). After adjustment for patient 
demographic and clinical characteristics and provider demographics, LEP Latinos were more 
likely to be non-adherent to oral medications and insulin than English-speaking Latinos [RRs 
1.11–1.17, p<0.05] or whites [RRs 1.36–1.49, p<0.05]. English-speaking Latinos were more likely 
to be non-adherent compared to whites [RRs 1.23–1.30. p<0.05]. Patient-provider language 
concordance was not associated with rates of non-adherence among LEP Latinos.
Conclusions and Relevance—Non-adherence to newly prescribed diabetes medication is 
substantially greater among Latinos than whites, even among English-speaking Latinos. LEP 
Latino patients are more likely to be non-adherent than English-speaking Latinos independent of 
the Spanish language fluency of their providers. Interventions beyond ensuring access to 
interpreters or patient-provider language concordance will be required to improve medication 
adherence among Latino patients with diabetes.
INTRODUCTION
Over 3.1 million Latinos in the US have a diagnosis of diabetes and require daily medication 
use. 1 Adherence to chronic medications is poor in the general population,23 and perhaps 
particularly poor among Latinos.4–6 Poor patient-provider communication has been posited 
as a key barrier to medication adherence.3 Language barriers in health care are common for 
Latinos, as over 44 percent have limited English proficiency (LEP) defined as speaking 
English less than “very well”.7 Language barriers between LEP Latinos and their non-
Spanish-speaking providers have been associated with higher risk of poor glycemic control. 
In a prior study, we found that LEP Latinos whose providers did not speak Spanish were 
twice as likely as those with Spanish-speaking providers to have poor glycemic control (28% 
vs 16%).8
Language barriers might lead to poorer glycemic control via several pathways. Medication 
reconciliation can be difficult across language barriers 9, and providers may be reluctant to 
initiate or intensify medications when they are uncertain of a patient’s current medication 
use. Patients are less likely to initiate insulin if they feel their provider did not adequately 
explain the risks and benefits.10 Encounters carried out across language barriers are often 
less patient-centered 11 and LEP patients with language discordant providers are less likely 
to report trust in their providers.12 Providers who lack fluency in the patient’s language may 
feel stymied when attempting to elicit or address a patient’s medication concerns, 13 and 
patients lingering questions and lack of comprehension of their medication regimen may 
lead to poorer medication adherence. However, the extent to which language barriers impact 
medication adherence for newly prescribed medications, and how these potential barriers

 play out in health care settings with uniform access to professional interpreter services, is 
not well understood.
We designed a study to evaluate the role of ethnicity and language barriers, specifically 
patient-provider language concordance, on Latino patients’ non-adherence to newly 
prescribed oral hypoglycemic medications or insulin.
We compared medication non-adherence across four groups of insured patients with 
diabetes: 1) English-speaking, non-Latino whites (whites); 2) English-speaking Latinos; 3) 
LEP Latinos whose providers were fluent in Spanish (LEP Concordant); 4) LEP Latinos 
whose providers were not fluent in Spanish (LEP Discordant). Our hypotheses were that 
LEP discordant patients would have greater medication non-adherence than LEP concordant 
patients, and that non-adherence among both English-speaking and LEP Latinos would be 
higher than whites.
METHODS
Study Setting and Population
The study setting was Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated 
healthcare delivery system that provides comprehensive medical services to approximately 
3.9 million members. The study population was drawn from the KPNC Diabetes Registry 
(KPNC-DR), a well-characterized, ethnically diverse diabetic population. 1415
For this analysis, participants were eligible if they were active health plan members with 
type 2 diabetes, self-identified as Latino or white, whose preferred language was English or 
Spanish, and were ≥18 years old on the date they were prescribed a new oral hypoglycemic 
medication or insulin during 2006–2010 (n=116,802). Patients were excluded if they had 
end stage renal disease (n=1,744), gaps in KPNC coverage and/or pharmacy benefits for 
more than 2 months during the 2 years prior through the 2 years after the date of the new 
medication prescription (n=35,124), or were not empaneled at the time of the new 
medication prescription with a primary care provider (PCP) for whom Spanish language 
proficiency data existed (n=49,096), leaving 30,838 patients for the study.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of KPNC and the University of 
California, San Francisco.
Measures
Latino patients whose preferred language was Spanish in the electronic health record were 
considered to have LEP. To determine language concordance, we identified the Spanish 
fluency of each LEP Latino’s provider using data from two surveys: (1) an administrative 
survey given to providers upon employment, and (2) a web-based survey we developed 
specifically to ask KPNC providers about their Spanish language ability conducted in 2012. 
Both surveys asked providers to indicate their level of Spanish-speaking proficiency as “not 
at all”, “low”, “moderate”, or “high”. If data from both surveys were available, we used 
answers from the more recent web-based survey. Providers whose self-reported Spanish-
speaking proficiency was “high” were considered to be fluent in Spanish16; their LEP Latino

 patients were designated as being in language concordant relationships (LEP concordant), 
LEP Latinos whose providers were not fluent in Spanish were designated as being language 
discordant (LEP discordant).
Non-adherence
Our outcomes of interest were measures of patient non-adherence to each newly prescribed 
hypoglycemic medication. Diabetes medications were classified as oral or insulin. (See 
Appendix A for details.) Medication adherence was estimated using medication dispensing 
data from KPNC pharmacies; patients’ pharmacy benefits were limited to those pharmacies. 
To be considered a new medication, we required that there was no dispensing of the 
medication in the prior 24 months; for each new medication (“index therapy”), we measured 
adherence subsequent to “index date”, defined as the date of first dispensing (or prescribing 
date if there were zero dispensings). We used four validated measures to assess medication 
non-adherence to each newly prescribed diabetes medication. 17–19 (See definitions in Table 
1.) Three of these measures evaluated non-adherence at specific milestones, while the fourth, 
a continuous measure of overall adherence (new prescription medication gap (NPMG)), 
estimated gaps in medication supplies beginning with the index date until the end of follow-
up (earlier of 24 months or censorship (date the PCP stopped the medication or switched the 
patient to an alternative medication)). Following convention, we then categorized patients as 
demonstrating “adequate” or “inadequate” adherence based on commonly used cut points 
for gaps in medication supplies (i.e., NPMG < 20% versus ≥ 20% of follow-up time, 
respectively). 18 We calculated all four measures of medication non-adherence for oral 
medications. For insulin, we calculated only primary non-adherence and early stage non-
persistence. We did not estimate NPMG as insulin use can vary daily with patient 
requirements, making estimates of this and similar continuous measures of adherence 
unreliable when based on pharmacy dispensing data alone.
Data Analysis
To guide covariate selection, we constructed a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) 
(Appendix B) based on our team’s interpretation of a broad review of the literature and 
hypothesized causal pathways that could link language barriers to medication adherence.
20–22 DAGs are particularly useful in analyses where many factors might influence an 
outcome, as they clarify the relationships between the factors and assist in defining potential 
confounders (which should be included as covariates) and mediators (which need not be 
included in analytic models). From this DAG analysis, we specified the set of covariates 
required in adjusted regression models to generate causal estimates of the impact of 
language barriers on adherence. 2023,24
Based on our DAG, the necessary covariates included patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, socio-
economic status and the provider’s race, age, and sex. Neighborhood deprivation index 
(NDI) 25 was included as a contextual measure of patients’ socio-economic status as socio-
economic status has been associated with adherence26. Mediators in our DAG model 
included comorbidity index, number of non-diabetes medications, out of pocket cost, and 
depression. (See Appendix A for variable definitions.)

 Bivariate analyses comparing covariates and other patient characteristics between specific 
LEP language groups were performed using chi-square tests for categorical variables, t-tests 
for interval variables if normally distributed, and Wilcoxon rank sums tests for interval 
variables not normally distributed.
Repeated measures, multivariate, modified Poisson regression models, with robust error 
variance and logarithm link27 were generated to calculate adjusted relative risk (RR) of the 
binary outcomes (i.e.,non-adherence to newly prescribed oral hypoglycemic medications or 
insulin). We chose this method over logistic regression or binomial regression because: (1) 
the odds ratio is a biased estimate of relative risk for common outcomes and (2) convergence 
problems are common in binomial regression models. We used robust variance estimates 
since log Poisson models tend to give conservative results.27 Our models also adjusted the 
residual covariance structure for within-subject clustering, as some patients were prescribed 
>1 new medication during the study. We compared English-speaking and LEP Latinos 
versus whites, LEP Latinos versus English-speaking Latinos, and LEP discordant versus 
LEP concordant Latinos.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis incorporating providers who reported “moderate” 
fluency into the language concordant group.
RESULTS
The study population of 30,838 included 21,878 white, 5,755 English-speaking Latino and 
3,205 LEP Latino patients. Among LEP Latinos, 1,610 (50.2%) had a provider who was 
language concordant) and 1,595 (49.8%) patients had a provider who language discordant). 
(Table 2)
Compared to whites, Latino patients were somewhat younger, and lived in poorer 
neighborhoods. They also had fewer comorbid illnesses, fewer chronic non-diabetes 
medications, lower out of pocket costs and were also less likely to be diagnosed with 
depression. However, Latino patients had higher rates of poor glycemic control (A1c>9%) 
than whites, with LEP Latinos at 37%, English-speaking Latinos 36% and whites 24%. LEP 
concordant and LEP discordant patients were similar, though depression was more 
commonly diagnosed among the LEP concordant (15.1% vs. 11.0%, p<0.05). (Table 2)
A total of 696 providers cared for the 30,838 patients, with each provider caring for 45 
patients on average (std. dev. 33; range 1 to 156). Providers differed slightly across groups 
by age, gender and race, with providers caring for LEP Latino patients more likely to 
identify as Latino than providers caring for whites or English-speaking Latinos (42.3% vs. 
7.2% and 13.3%). There were 46,131 new prescriptions for diabetes medications (39,157 
oral medications, 6,974 insulin) over the five-year study period. At each adherence stage, 
LEP Latinos had greater non-adherence to oral medication prescriptions than English-
speaking Latinos, who in turn had greater non-adherence than white patients. (Table 3) 
Initiation of treatment to oral medications was poor: 32.2% of LEP Latinos, 27.2% of 
English-speaking Latinos and 18.3% of whites were either primary non-adherent or early

 non-persistent. Over half (54.2%) of LEP Latinos were non-adherent to treatment with oral 
diabetes medications before the end of follow-up.
The prevalence of inadequate adherence for oral medications based on NPMG was 
substantially greater for Latinos than whites, and greater still for LEP Latinos (60.2% LEP 
Latinos, 51.7% English-speaking Latinos, 37.5% whites) (p<0.05 for each comparison) 
(Figure 1.).
The ethnic-language patterns for primary non-adherence for the far fewer new insulin 
prescriptions were similar to those of oral medications, though the differences were not 
statistically significant. Early stage non-persistence with insulin varied substantially: 42.8 % 
among LEP Latinos, 34.4% among English-speaking Latinos, and 28.5% among whites 
(p<0.05 for each comparison).
There were no significant differences between the LEP Concordant and LEP Discordant 
groups for any of the measures. The patterns described above persisted after adjustment for 
variables guided by our DAG (Appendix C) and in fuller models incorporating potential 
mediators (comorbidity index, number of non-diabetes medications, out of pocket cost, 
depression) (Table 4). Relative to whites, English-speaking Latinos had adjusted relative 
risks ranging from 1.19 to 1.30 for non-adherence to oral medications and insulin, while 
LEP Latinos had somewhat larger ARRs ranging from 1.36 to 1.49. LEP concordant and 
LEP discordant patients had similar risks of non-adherence relative to whites ranging from a 
low of 1.33 to a high of 1.52. The differences in primary non-adherence of insulin were 
smaller and not significant (Table 4).
Differences in non-adherence between LEP Latinos and English-speaking Latinos, while 
smaller than those noted between Latino groups and whites, also persisted after adjustment 
for patient and provider factors (Table 4). As in the unadjusted analyses, no differences in 
non-adherence were noted between LEP concordant versus LEP discordant patients at any 
stage of medication use.(data not shown).
A sensitivity analysis incorporating providers reporting “moderate” Spanish into the 
language concordant group resulted in a slight change in patient non-adherence by NPMG: 
LEP concordant 52.6% vs LEP discordant 55.3%, p= 0.13.
DISCUSSION
In this study of non-adherence to newly prescribed diabetes medications among insured 
patients in an integrated healthcare delivery system with uniform access to interpreter 
services, we found substantive, graded differences in non-adherence among whites, English-
speaking Latinos and LEP Latinos. While the greatest non-adherence was among LEP 
Latinos, large differences in adherence between whites and Latino groups existed 
irrespective of English language proficiency. Contrary to our hypothesis that language 
discordance in the patient-provider encounter would be associated with greater medication 
non-adherence for LEP patients, we found no difference in non-adherence measures among 
the LEP Latinos when examined by the Spanish fluency of their provider.

 The relationship between Latino ethnicity, English language proficiency, and medication 
non-adherence has been difficult to study. Although a population level study found no 
differences between elderly Latinos and whites in self-report of diabetes medication non-
adherence,31 the association between Latino ethnicity and medication non-adherence has 
been observed in various clinical settings and with diverse illnesses. 2829–31 Using this same 
Kaiser diabetes registry, a previous study of ongoing medication adherence (employing other 
measures of adherence and models with different covariates) found that a combined lipid, 
blood pressure and diabetes medication adherence outcome varied by ethnicity of the patient 
and by the language capability of the providers, though diabetes medications alone did not. 
28 Multiple explanations have been posited for greater non-adherence among Latinos, 
including issues of pharmacy logistics32, financial barriers33, numeracy and literacy 
barriers34, cultural attitudes toward medications35, and language barriers36. Latinos, 
particularly immigrants, also have high rates of depression, which may contribute to 
medication non-adherence.37
Our study adds to this literature in several ways. First, it offers a clinically relevant 
measurement of the substantial difference in newly prescribed medication adherence 
between Latinos and white patients struggling with the same disease, in a setting conducive 
to medication adherence, and irrespective of Latino language preference. Despite favorable 
clinical characteristics (i.e. fewer comorbidities and less medication burden), approximately 
a third of LEP Latinos never started their prescribed treatment to oral medications and half 
never started prescribed insulin. Between 50–60% of Latino patients (English-speaking or 
LEP) did not have adequate supply of a newly prescribed diabetes medication during follow-
up (e.g., were without medication at least 4.8 out of 24 months) while the same was true for 
about 37% of white patients.
Second, we also observed that language concordance between clinician and patient is 
insufficient to eliminate disparities in adherence for LEP Latinos with diabetes. Prior work 
has consistently demonstrated that LEP patients with language discordant providers report 
less comprehension of diagnosis and treatment, including medication instructions. 3638 LEP 
patients report more adverse medication events, less trust in provider, and less satisfaction 
with the medical encounter. 12,3639 Providers caring for LEP patients report that language 
barriers make it difficult to elicit symptoms, reconcile medications, and establish rapport.13 
Why then, did we find no differences in medication adherence by patient-provider language 
concordance and only small differences in adherence between LEP and English-speaking 
Latinos? Several facts are worth considering. Medical homes that harness the skills of 
ethnically and linguistically diverse medical staff (e.g., nurse care managers) may play a 
large role, as support personnel may supplant the central role of the primary care provider in 
medication coaching. Uniform access to professional interpreter systems, testing and 
certification of bilingual staff,40 and greater provider awareness of language-associated 
disparities may also help mitigate language barriers in the clinical encounter. Yet, the high, 
non-adherence rate observed suggests that even these programs are insufficient to overcome 
barriers to medication adherence among LEP and English speaking Latinos; more research, 
using qualitative as well as quantitative methods is clearly needed to determine key factors 
and enable successful interventions.

 Our study of medication non-adherence should not be taken to imply that language 
concordance is not associated with better glycemic control among Latinos. Glycemic control 
is dictated by a range of lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, exercise, weight control, stress) in 
addition to use of pharmacotherapy. In a recent study, we found that LEP Latino patients 
who switched from a language discordant provider to a language concordant provider 
improved glycemic control more than those who switched to another language discordant 
provider.41 Even in the absence of adherence differences, improved attention to lifestyle or 
intensification of insulin, which we could not capture, could account for the improvement in 
glycemic control observed when patients switched to language concordant providers.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has additional strengths. To our knowledge, this the first study to determine 
ethnic-language medication adherence differences by examining all new diabetes medication 
prescriptions in the clinical record. Most studies have relied on estimates of ongoing 
medication adherence. The use of detailed electronic records allowed us to use multiple, 
validated measures of medication non-adherence to examine oral diabetes medication and 
insulin adherence overall and at different stages of medication use, including primary non-
adherence which is typically not captured. We have shown previously that because Kaiser 
Permanente maintains a closed pharmacy system, ascertainment of pharmacy utilization in a 
sample with pharmacy benefits is quite complete.42 We were able to include a direct 
measure of provider Spanish fluency via a provider self-report survey in addition to 
administrative data. Sensitivity analysis showed little variation when we altered our cut-off 
for provider fluency. Finally, in what may well be a “best case” scenario for many Latinos 
(who often lack ongoing health care access) the integrated healthcare system setting in this 
study affords all patients relatively uniform access and quality of care, relatively small 
financial and logistical barriers to medication use, and access to bilingual staff and 
interpreter services, thereby increasing the internal validity of our findings.
Our study also has several limitations. We were unable to measure individual level socio-
economic indicators such as education and income, health literacy or acculturation level of 
patients, all potentially important factors in medication adherence. Instead, we relied on the 
neighborhood deprivation index, a contextual measure of socioeconomic status. Second, we 
may have misclassification error in adjudication of patient English proficiency status using 
administrative data. Data from our own work and others indicates that about 20–30% of 
patients indicate a non-English language preference despite speaking English well.43 If 
patients classified as LEP with language discordant clinicians were actually English 
speaking, a small difference between the LEP groups may have been obscured. Adoption of 
current recommendations to include an English language proficiency question when 
capturing race, ethnicity and language data would strengthen studies of this type. Third, we 
measured adherence after each new prescription in the electronic medical record. If a patient 
refused a medication during the clinical encounter, the provider would most likely not write 
a prescription. In our study, lower rates of insulin use among Latinos than whites, along with 
higher rates of poor glycemic control among Latinos, suggests that Latino patients might be 
refusing insulin within the clinical encounter, resulting in no prescription and no opportunity 
to measure adherence. Our findings thus likely underestimate the adherence gap between

 Latinos and whites. Fourth, our findings may not generalize to other settings with less access 
to interpreters or with different Latino groups. Fifth, we were unable to systematically 
measure interpreter use. Sixth, we had no objective measure of provider Spanish proficiency. 
Finally, we have no direct measure of medication adherence beyond dispensing.
Conclusion
Our study among insured patients suggests that much more needs to be done to improve 
adherence to newly prescribed medications among Latino patients at all levels of English 
proficiency. Latinos, regardless of their language ability, had much lower rates of initiating 
newly prescribed diabetes medications, suggesting that early interventions should be 
attempted and evaluated. Given the lack of evidence of substantive differences in adherence 
between language concordant vs. discordant LEP patients, these interventions need to go 
beyond simply addressing language barriers. More research on non-adherence in this 
vulnerable subgroup is needed. Finally, interventions both within and outside the patient-
provider interaction will likely be required to adequately support English and Spanish 
speaking Latino patients with the challenges of diabetes medication adherence.

Oral medications included alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, biguanides, 
thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 Inhibitors), and 
combination oral diabetes therapies.
Insulin medication included all insulin except inhaled insulin. Injected glucagon-like 
peptide-1 agonists (pramlintide, exenatide, or liraglutide) were excluded from the analysis.
As a measure of socioeconomic status, we calculated the neighborhood deprivation index 
(NDI) based on 2010 census tract boundaries using 2005–2009 American Community 
Survey census data, and applied to the first recorded patient address in the period 1/1/2006–
12/31/2010. 25 NDI was then categorized, based on quartiles of the distribution among all 
census tracts used in the creation of the NDI measure.
Patient characteristics not used as covariates (because the DAG analysis did not require 
them), but shown in Table 2 to further describe the patient population, included co-
morbidities, depression, number of chronic (non-diabetic) medications dispensed, out-of-

 pocket medication cost in the 6 months prior to index date, use of oral hypoglycemics or 
insulin, no diabetes medication use, and hemoglobin A1c. The Charlson co-morbidity index 
was used to measure co-morbidities (not including diabetes) in the calendar year prior to the 
index date year, and was grouped into four levels (< 1, 1 to < 2, 2 to < 3, and ≥ 3). 
Depression was defined by physician diagnosis (ICD-9 code: 296.2x, 296.3x, 298.0, 300.4, 
309.0, 309.28, 311) or prescribed medications (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, 
paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, bupropion, isocarboxazid, maprotiline, mirtazapine, 
nefazodone, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, trazodone, venlafaxine, duloxetine, 
desvenlafaxine) in the calendar year prior to the index date year. Number of chronic (non-
diabetic) medications dispensed and out-of-pocket medication cost, use of oral 
hypoglycemics or insulin, or no diabetes medication use, was measured during the 12 
months prior to the index date. Hemoglobin A1c was measured as the latest measure within 
6 months prior to the index date and was used to indicate poor glycemic control, defined as 
hemoglobin A1c ≥ 9.0%.

 indicates that variables in the shaded boxes are to be included in multivariate analysis, with 
adjustments only for patient and provider (PCP) characteristics being necessary for inclusion 
as confounders, and thus covariates, in the multivariate model. Variables in the white boxes 
are to be excluded as potential confounders and covariates. Based on DAG analysis, dotted 
arrows indicate causal pathways between language concordance and medication adherence 
which contain confounders that have been blocked by adjustment; the dashed line represents 
a spurious association that does not confound the association between language concordance 
and medication adherence; the dash-double dotted arrow displays open causal pathway and 
possible residual confounding, and solid arrows identify causal pathways for the indirect 
effects. The resulting multivariate model estimates the indirect effect of patient-provider 
language concordance on adherence.

Definitions of Measures of Medication Adherence
Full name
Definition
Primary non-adherence
A dichotomous measure indication that there was no dispensing of a new (index)medication within 60 days 
of the prescribing date.
Early stage non-persistence
A dichotomous measure indicating that the patient did not obtain at least one refill within the period defined 
by the days’ supply at the first dispensing plus a 90-day grace period.
Later stage non-persistence
A dichotomous measure indicating that a newly prescribed medication was refilled at least once, but 
discontinued before the end of follow-up. Occurs when the patient did not refill the medication within 90 
days of end of cumulative days’ supply of previous dispensings.
New Prescription Medication 
Gap (NPMG)
A continuous measure which assesses overall adherence to a newly prescribed medication from the initial 
prescribing date to the end of follow-up (end of observation period or point of censoring) by estimating gaps 
in medication supplies. NPMG theoretically ranges from 100% for a patient who obtained no medication 
(i.e., primary non-adherent) to 0% for a patient who consistently obtained refills of the prescription in a 
timely fashion and thus maintained adequate medication supplies for the entire follow-up period. Following 
convention, adherence is categorized as “adequate” versus “inadequate” based on commonly used cut points 
(i.e.. < 20% versus ≥ 20% of follow-up time, respectively)
