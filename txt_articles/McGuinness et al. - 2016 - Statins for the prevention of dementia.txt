Background
This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol
levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an
association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia.
Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to
determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype
or cognitive level.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), The Cochrane Library,
MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11
November 2015.
Selection criteria
We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people
at risk of dementia.
Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.
Main results
We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a
history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow-up was 3.2
years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536
participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence,
downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged
the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests
(high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non-fatal adverse events were less than 5% in both studies and there
1

 was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies,
OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05).
Authors’ conclusions
There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia.
Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from
observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from
subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the
inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only.

Statins for the prevention of dementia
Background
Dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease) is a global healthcare concern; the number of people affected worldwide is predicted to
double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2010 and 131.5 million in 2050. Therefore, it is important to find means of preventing
dementia. It has been suggested that high levels of cholesterol in the serum (part of the blood) may increase the risk of dementia and
that treatment with cholesterol-lowering medicines such as statins may reduce the risk of dementia.
Study characteristics
We searched medical databases for clinical trials comparing giving a statin to giving a placebo (pretend medicine) to people with normal
cognitive function (which is brain activities that allow us to gain and use knowledge) and of sufficient age to be at risk of Alzheimer’s
disease.
Key results
We found two suitable randomised trials for inclusion in this review with 26,340 participants; neither showed any reduction in
occurrence of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia in people treated with statins compared to people given placebo. Side effects were low in
both statin and placebo groups with no difference between groups in the risk of dropping out of the trial due to side effects.
Quality of the evidence
There were limitations in the included studies involving the methods of assessment of cognition and the inclusion only of participants
deemed to be of moderate to high risk of a problem with their blood (vascular) system. Nevertheless, there was good evidence that
statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia.

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is
based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).
CI: confidence interval; MD: mean difference; OR: odds ratio; RR: risk ratio
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.
If evidence was downgraded it was because of imprecision.

Thisisanupdate of the reviewpublishedin2009 (Other published
versions of this review), which concluded that statins given in late
life to people at risk of vascular disease have no effect in preventing
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or dementia. Biologically, it seemed fea-
sible that statins could prevent dementia by lowering cholesterol
andinitial evidence fromobservational studieswas verypromising.
However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies
and the evidence from the two included randomised controlled
trials (RCTs) was negative. This updated review aimed to re-assess
the evidence.
Description of the condition
Dementia is defined as “a progressive and largely irreversible clin-
ical syndrome that is characterised by a widespread impairment
of mental function” (NICE 2006). It is characterised by a cluster
of symptoms and signs including difficulties in memory, distur-
bances in language, psychosocial and psychiatric changes, and im-
pairments in activities of daily living (ADL) (Burns 2009). The
intellectual decline is usually progressive and spares the level of
consciousness until the very late stages of the illness. Alzheimer’s
Disease International estimates that in 2015 there are 46.8 million
people with dementia in the world, the number is predicted to
double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5
million in 2050 (World Alzheimer Report 2015). These estimates
are 12% to 13% higher than those made for the World Alzheimer
Report 2009. Therefore, it is a major health concern and any in-
tervention that may reduce risk would have a major public health
impact.
There are different subtypes of dementia associated with differ-
ing underlying brain pathologies (World Alzheimer Report 2009;
Burns 2009). The most common subtypes in older people are AD,
vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed dementia (a mixture of AD
and VaD pathology). AD is the most common subtype account-
ing for 60% to 70% of all cases; it has a prevalence of approx-
imately 1% among 60- to 64-year olds rising to 40% in people
aged 85 years and older. Although AD occurs later in life there is a
long preclinical stage characterised by progressive neuropatholog-
ical changes. These include amyloid plaques composed primarily
of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neu-
roinflammation, neuronal dysfunction and cell death (Cole 2007).
According to the influential amyloid cascade hypothesis, Aβ ac-
cumulation is a critical first step in the sequence of pathological
changes that ultimately lead to cognitive dysfunction (Glenner
1984).
VaD is characterised by both large- and small-vessel lesions. Sub-
cortical ischaemic vascular disease is now thought to be more
prevalent than multi-infarct dementia caused by large-vessel le-
sions (Ballard 2000; Esiri 1997). VaD accounts for approximately
17% of cases of dementia; prevalence estimates are 1.6% in Europe
in people over 65 years of age (Rizzi 2014), and correspondingly
1.7% in China (Ji 2015).
Cholesterol and Alzheimer’s disease
There is a close relationship between AD and cardiovascular dis-
ease with coronary heart disease and hypertension being signif-
icant risk factors for AD (Kivipelto 2002; Skoog 1998). Sev-
eral epidemiological studies have shown an association between
high serum cholesterol levels and an increased susceptibility to
AD (Hayden 2006; Jarvik 1995; Kalmijn 2000; Kivipelto 2002;
Kivipelto 2005; Notkola 1998; Solomon 2009; Whitmer 2005),
while other studies have shown no association (Mainous 2005;
Mielke 2010; Romas 1999; Tan 2003), or a negative association
(Mielke 2005; Moroney 1999; Reitz 2004). There have been in-
consistencies between studies, for example, in study design and
follow-up period, making it difficult to compare studies directly.
The best established genetic risk factor for sporadic and late-onset
AD is the ǫ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE); this is a protein
that is involved in cholesterol transport in the brain and that also
binds directly to the Aβ peptide and influences its aggregation
and clearance in vitro (Strittmatter 1993) and in vivo (Naslund
1995; Wisniewski 1995). Meta-analysis has shown that the ApoE
ǫ4 allele increases the risk of the disease by three times in het-
erozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes (Farrer 1997). Each
copy of the allele lowers the age of onset of AD by almost 10 years
(Corder 1993). The ǫ4 allele is associated with higher plasma con-
centrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
as well as a higher risk of atherosclerosis. Other genes involved in
cholesterol metabolism have been found to be associated with AD
through Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS): Apo J or
clusterin (Harold 2009), adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding
cassette subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) (Beecham 2014), and
sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) (Meng 2007).
Generation of cerebral Aβ in vitro (Mizuno 1999; Simons 1998)
and in vivo is cholesterol dependent (Burns 2003; Refolo 2000;
Sparks 1994). Aβ is a cleavage product of amyloid precursor pro-
tein (APP). APP can be cleaved in several ways but Aβ derives
from the sequential proteolytic activities of beta and gamma secre-
tase (the amyloidogenic processing pathway) (Marks 2003). Both
beta and gamma secretases are active in lipid rafts-specialised cell
membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids,
and it appears that APP processing within these lipid rafts deter-
mines the level of Aβ production (Ehehalt 2003; Vetrivel 2004).
Cholesterol and vascular dementia
Risk factors for VaD are similar to risk factors for all types of
vascular disease, namely hypertension, diabetes, smoking and hy-
percholesterolaemia (Ott 1998; Posner 2002; Stewart 1999). Sev-
eral studies have found an association of VaD with decreased
levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (Kuriyama
1994; Muckle 1985; Reitz 2004; Zuliani 2001). The role of LDL
6

 cholesterol remains controversial, with some studies finding an
association between increased LDL cholesterol and risk of VaD
(Klich-Raczka 2002; Moroney 1999; Paragh 2002; Reitz 2004),
and other studies reporting a negative association (van Exel 2002;
Yoshitake 1995). Plasma lipids could be associated with the risk
of VaD through several mechanisms. High levels of LDL choles-
terol and low levels of HDL cholesterol are established risk fac-
tors for coronary heart disease (Moroney 1999) and carotid artery
atherosclerosis (Sharrett 1994). These may lead to cognitive im-
pairment through cerebral hypoperfusion or embolism (Breteler
1994). HDL cholesterol may interact with ApoE to cause small-
vessel disease (Dantoine 2002).
Stroke is also a major risk factor for VaD. Lowering of cholesterol
concentrations using statins reduces the risk of stroke in high-risk
populations and in people with non-cardioembolic stroke or tran-
sientischaemicattack.Each 1mmol/Ldecrease inLDL cholesterol
equates to a reduction in risk ratio for stroke of 21.1% (Amarenco
2009). By reducing the risk of stroke, statins may also act to reduce
the incidence of post-stroke dementia.
Description of the intervention
Statins are a class of drugs that inhibit the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. HMG-CoA
reductase catalyses the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis.
Statins thereby reduce formation and entry of LDL cholesterol
into the circulation and upregulate LDL receptor activity, which in
turn lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and increases HDL
cholesterol. They have also been shown to lower serum fatty acid
concentrations and to alter the relative percentages of important
polyunsaturated fatty acids (Harris 2004). Statins also have mul-
tiple other cholesterol-independent effects since they:
• improve the endothelial function of atherosclerotic vessels
(Wassmann 2001);
• have antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects (Reitz
2004);
• may reduce apoptosis and cell death (Ruocco 2002).
Statins are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypercholes-
terolaemia and for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disease. There has been controversy about the level
of cardiovascular risk that justifies treatment. Some guidelines ad-
vocate treatment for primary prevention in people with a high 10-
year cardiovascular disease risk and in people with a high lifetime
cardiovascular disease risk estimated from heart age and other JBS3
calculator metrics, and in whom lifestyle changes alone are con-
sidered insufficient by the physician and person concerned (Heart
2014). Statins are taken once a day by mouth. Most are avail-
able generically, decreasing their cost. They are classified accord-
ing to their solubility in lipids (lipophilic) or water (hydrophilic).
Lipophilic statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, cervistatin) cross the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and penetrate cell membranes more
effectively than the hydrophilic statins (atorvastatin, pravastatin,
fluvastatin).
Statins and dementia: observational studies
When the first version of this review was written in 2001, two
clinical reports had been published describing an association be-
tween statin therapy and a reduction in the occurrence of AD by as
much as 70% (Jick 2000; Wolozin 2000). Since then, several more
observational studies (cross-sectional and longitudinal) assessing
the relationship between statin therapy and dementia have been
conducted. These have been systematically reviewed by several
groups. Wong 2013 performed a meta-analysis of observational
studies and concluded that statins may provide a slight benefit in
the prevention of AD and all-type dementia but that the studies
were subject to bias and so should be interpreted with caution.
Swiger 2013 evaluated the effects of statins on short-term cognitive
function and long-term incidence of dementia in RCTs or high-
quality prospective cohort studies. There was no consistent effect
of statin therapy on cognitive end points in the short term. Pooled
results assessing long-term cognitive effects revealed a 29% reduc-
tion in incident dementia in people treated with statins with the
caveat of heterogeneity in study design, exposure and outcomes.
Song 2013 carried out a meta-analysis of eight prospective cohort
studies; the risk ratio of dementia was reduced in the statin users
but again the authors commented on significant heterogeneity.
Adverse effects of statins
Statins have known adverse effects; headache; altered liver-func-
tion tests; paraesthesia and gastrointestinal effects including ab-
dominal pain, flatulence, constipation, diarrhoea, nausea and
vomiting, are the most commonly reported. Reversible myositis
is a rare but significant adverse effect of statins; myalgia and my-
opathy have also been reported. There has also been controversy
about the level of cardiovascular risk that justifies treatment. Some
guidelines advocate treatment for primary prevention in people
with a high 10-year cardiovascular disease risk and in people with
a high lifetime cardiovascular disease risk estimated from heart age
and other JBS3 calculator metrics, in whom lifestyle changes alone
are considered insufficient by the physician and person concerned
(Heart 2014).
It is also possible that treatment with statins may cause neurocog-
nitive deficits. Cognitive impairment has been cited on post-mar-
keting surveillance reports, case reports, observational studies and
RCTs (Bettermann 2012; Evans 2009; Orsi 2001; Wagstaff 2003;
Zamrini 2004; Zandi 2005), and following a review, the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a new warning for the
labelling of statin drugs regarding potential adverse effects on cog-
nition in 2012. The FDA advised the reports about memory loss,
forgetfulness and confusion spanned all statin products and all
age groups. In general, the symptoms were not serious and were
reversible within a few weeks after the person stopped taking the

 medication; people affected may have been taking the medica-
tion for a few days; others affected had been taking it for years.
Other groups have systematically assessed the evidence available
in an effort to address the question ’do statins impair cognition?’;
they concluded there is no significant evidence that statins cause
or contribute towards cognitive decline (Kelley 2014; Ott 2015;
Richardson 2013).
How the intervention might work
Lack of understanding as to the true pathophysiology of AD limits
our understanding of the role of statins in the possible prevention
of AD. In vitro and in vivo studies have been carried out that have
resulted in a number of proposed mechanisms of action including:
action on APP metabolism, reduction of chronic neuroinflamma-
tion, reductions in brain oxidative stress, gamma-secretase reloca-
tion in lipid rafts, and reduced amyloid plaques and phosphory-
lated tau-positive dystrophic neuritis (McFarland 2014).
The range of cholesterol-dependent and cholesterol-independent
actions described above may all be relevant to an effect of statins
on the incidence of VaD. They could also reduce the incidence
of post-stroke dementia through efficacy in the primary and sec-
ondary prevention of stroke and other pleiotropic effects. Clin-
ical trials indicate that statins significantly decrease stroke risk.
The meta-analysis carried out by The Cholesterol Treatment Tri-
alists’ Collaborators including 90,056 participants found that the
use of statins caused a significant 17% proportional reduction in
the incidence of first-ever stroke of any type per 1 mmol/l LDL
cholesterol reduction (CTTC 2005). In secondary prevention of
stroke, the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Choles-
terol Levels study showed that treatment with atorvastatin reduced
the risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events in people with recent
stroke or transient ischaemic attack but no history of heart dis-
ease (SPARCL Investigators 2006). A more recent meta-analysis
included 18 RCTs and concluded that statins may be beneficial in
reducing the overall incidence of stroke (Wang 2014).
Why it is important to do this review
In 2015 over 46 million people live with dementia worldwide.
This number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 2050.
Dementia also has a huge economic impact. In 2015 the total
estimated worldwide cost of dementia is USD 818 billion, and
it will become a trillion dollar disease by 2018 (World Alzheimer
Report 2015). Therefore, any medication that may have an impact
in preventing onset of the disease will be of immense interest to the
public, healthcare workers and policy makers. Debate continues
about risks and benefits of widespread statin use with controversy
concerning primary prevention of vascular disease in particular.
This review will add to the knowledge base concerning primary
prevention of dementia.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which a
statin was given for at least 12 months. We considered it unlikely
that any preventive effecton dementia incidence could be detected
in trials with shorter treatment periods.
We excluded trials comparing two different statins without a
placebo.
Types of participants
People with objectively normal cognitive function and of sufficient
age to be at risk of AD (mean age 65 years or over). We also
included people with evidence of cerebrovascular disease or at high
risk of cerebrovascular disease.
Types of interventions
Any member of the statin family given within the licensed dose
range with parallel concomitant placebo.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Objective diagnosis of dementia.
• Objective diagnosis of AD according to standard criteria.
• Objective diagnosis of VaD according to standard criteria.

Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Im-
provement Group’s (CDCIG) specialised register on 11 Novem-
ber 2015 (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois). We used the following
search terms: statin*, simvastatin*, lovastatin*, pravastatin*, flu-
vastatin*, atorvastatin* and rosuvastatin*.
The Trials Search Co-ordinator for the CDCIG maintains ALOIS,
which contains studies that fall within the areas of dementia pre-
vention, dementia treatment and management, and cognitive en-
hancement in healthy elderly populations. The studies are identi-
fied through:
• monthly searches of a number of major healthcare
databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and
Lilacs;
• monthly searches of a number of trial registers: ISRCTN;
UMIN (Japan’s Trial Register); the World Health Organization
(WHO) portal (which covers ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN; the
Chinese Clinical Trials Register; the German Clinical Trials
Register; the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials and the
Netherlands National Trials Register, plus others);
• quarterly searches of the Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL);
• six-monthly searches of a number of grey literature sources:
ISI Web of Knowledge Conference Proceedings; Index to Theses
and Australasian Digital Theses.
To view a list of all sources searched for ALOIS see About ALOIS
on the ALOIS website (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois).
We ran additional searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO,
CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO Portal/ICTRP to ensure
that the search was as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible.
Appendix 1 shows the search strategies used for the retrieval of
reports of trials.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two authors (BMcG and PP) independently undertook searching
and screening of publications.
Two authors (BMcG and PP) agreed upon and tested the MeSH
terms and search strategy. The other authors (DC and RB) acted
as adjudicators and reviewed the process. BMcG and PP screened
the citations and independently selected trials for relevance against
the defined inclusion criteria. We resolved any disagreements in
the independent selection by discussion. We excluded those trials
that did not fulfil the criteria from further analysis. We referred to
excluded studies in the Discussion and Characteristics of excluded
studies table.
Data extraction and management
We extracted data from the published reports using a data collec-
tion form that was piloted by the team. We extracted available data
on demographics of participants (age, gender, lipid values at base-
line), statin regimen (type of statin, daily dosage, starting time,
duration) and follow-up duration. For continuous outcomes, nei-
ther the mean scores nor the mean changes from baseline in the in-
dividual treatment groups were reported. Therefore, we extracted
the mean difference (MD) between groups and the standard error
of the MD. For dichotomous data, we extracted the number of
participants in each treatment group and the number of partici-
pants experiencing the outcome of interest.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We assessed methodological quality of the included trials using
Cochrane’s tool for assessing risk of bias. We assessed the following
domains: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition
bias, reporting bias and other bias.
Measures of treatment effect
Continuous data
We used the MD to measure the treatment effect. If the same out-
come was assessed using different scales, then we used the stan-
dardised mean difference (SMD). We reported 95% confidence
intervals (CI).
Dichotomous data
We reported results of dichotomous outcomes as an odds ratio
(OR) with 95% CI.
Dealing with missing data
For each outcome measure, we sought data on every participant
assessed. To allow an intention-to-treat analysis, we sought the
data irrespective of compliance, whether or not the participant
was subsequently deemed ineligible, or otherwise excluded from
treatment or follow-up. If intention-to-treat data were not avail-
able in the publications, we sought ’on-treatment’ or the data of
9

 participants who completed the trial and indicated as such. We
did not use data from titration phases prior to the randomised
phase to assess safety or efficacy.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We considered clinical heterogeneity between trials (participants,
interventions and outcomes) when deciding whether or not to
synthesise data. Where we performed a meta-analysis, we used a
standard Chi2 test to check for heterogeneity. We also assessed the
impact of heterogeneity on the meta-analysis using the I2 statistic.
If heterogeneity still existed with any model, we carried out a
sensitivity analysis (excluding studies with conflicting results from
the rest) thereby assessing the robustness of the results of fixed-
effect versus random-effects models.
Data synthesis
Where data were suitable for a meta-analysis, we presented the
overall estimate from a fixed-effect model. If we found substantial
heterogeneity (I2 greater than 30%), we also presented results from
a random-effects model and reported this as the main result.
Presentation of results - ’Summary of findings’ table
We used the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment,
Development and Evaluation) approach to assess the quality of
the supporting evidence behind each estimate of treatment effect.
We presented primary outcomes of the review in a ’Summary of
findings’ table including, for each outcome, a summary of the
amount of data, the magnitude of the effect size and the overall
quality of the evidence (Schunemann 2011).

 Included studies
We identified two RCTs with 26,340 participants (HPS 2002;
PROSPER 2002). For full details, see Characteristics of included
studies table.
Participants
The HPS 2002 trial included adults aged 40 to 80 years at high risk
of vascular events (past medical history of coronary heart disease,
other occlusive arterial disease, diabetes or hypertension (if also
male and aged at least 65 years, in order to be at similar risk
to the other disease categories)). A total of 20,536 people were
randomised, with 5806 (28.3%) participants aged at least 70 years
at study entry. A total of 1820 participants had cerebrovascular
disease defined by past history of non-disabling stroke not thought
to be haemorrhagic or transient cerebral ischaemia.
The PROSPER study included 5804 adults aged 70 to 82 years
(mean age 75.4 years) with a history of, or risk factors for, vascular
disease. A total of 649 had a history of stroke or transient Ischaemic
attack.
Participants were recruited from industrialised countries. HPS
2002 recruited participants from the UK and PROSPER 2002
recruited participants from Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands.
Study participants predominantly consisted of ambulatory partic-
ipants recruited from the community or primary care facilities.
HPS 2002 did not assess cognition at baseline but excluded peo-
ple with dementia or any other condition that might limit long-
term compliance (e.g. severely disabling stroke, psychiatric disor-
der). PROSPER 2002 excluded participants with poor cognitive
function (MMSE less than 24) at baseline.
Mean non-fasting blood concentration of total cholesterol in HPS
2002 was 5.9 mmol/L (standard deviation (SD) 1.0), directly mea-
sured LDL cholesterol of 3.4 mmol/L (SD 0.8), HDL cholesterol
of 1.06 mmol/L (SD 0.33) and triglycerides of 2.1 mmol/L (SD
1.4).
For inclusion in the PROSPER 2002 trial, plasma total cholesterol
was required to be 4.0 to 9.0 mmol/L and triglycerides concen-
trations less than 6.0 mmol/L. Mean cholesterol at entry in both
groups was 5.7 mmol/L (SD 0.9), LDL cholesterol 3.8 mmol/L
(SD 0.8), HDL cholesterol 1.3 mmol/L (SD 0.35) and triglyc-
erides 1.5 mmol/L (SD 0.7).
Interventions
Treatment in HPS 2002 consisted of simvastatin 40 mg daily or
matching placebo. Mean compliance with simvastatin was 85%.
Mean non-study statin use in the placebo group was 17%. Mean
duration of follow-up was five years for all randomised partic-
ipants. There was a mean difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0
mmol/L between participants allocated simvastatin and partici-
pants allocated placebo during the study. The proportional reduc-
tion in LDL cholesterol produced by actual use of simvastatin 40
mg daily was approximately independent of the presenting choles-
terol concentration.
Treatment in PROSPER 2002 consisted of pravastatin 40 mg or
matching placebo. Adherence was 94% in both the placebo and
pravastatin groups. About 10% of the placebo group and 5% of
the pravastatin group initiated non-study statin therapy. Mean du-
ration of follow-up was 3.2 years (range 2.8 to 4.0) for partici-
pants who did not die or withdraw consent. At the second an-
nual visit post-randomisation, the pravastatin-induced decrease in
LDL cholesterol was 33% in compliant participants and 27% in
the entire cohort.
Outcomes - primary
Incidence of dementia was an outcome in HPS 2002 although it
was not clear from the study results or the protocol what criteria
were used to diagnose dementia.
Cognition:HPS 2002 assessedcognitive outcomesusingthe mod-
ified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m) ques-
tionnaire, administered to participants at final follow-up, either
face-to-face in the clinic or over the telephone. A TICS-m score
below 22 out of 39 was pre-specified as indicative of some cogni-
tive impairment.
Cognition was a tertiary outcome in PROSPER 2002. The differ-
ence was reported between last-on-treatment and second baseline
values for a number of cognitive tests: MMSE, number of correct
letter digit codes, number of words remembered in the Picture-
Word Learning Test (immediate and delayed) and time needed to
complete the Stroop test. The first baseline measure was used as
a practice measurement to reduce possible learning effects. Cog-
nitive function was measured after nine, 18 and 30 months and
at the end of the study (mean 42 months). A cognitive re-analysis
was published in 2010 (PROSPER 2010).
Adverse effects that were serious were reported by both studies
(HPS 2002; PROSPER 2002). HPS 2002 reported on develop-
ment of psychiatric disorders and attempted suicide.
Outcomes - secondary
PROSPER 2002 measured function in ADLs using the Barthel
Indexandthe Instrumental Activitiesof DailyLiving(IADL)scale.
Neither study provided data on quality of life or behaviour.

 Excluded studies
We excluded three new studies from this updated review. For full
details see Characteristics of excluded studies table. We excluded
26 non-randomised trials from the outset as per Figure 1.
Sparks 2010 assessed cognitive outcomes following the elective use
of statins in people diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment af-
ter enrolment in the Alzheimer’s Disease Anti-inflammatory Pre-
vention Trial (ADAPT). This was a pilot study in which use of
statin was not randomly assigned.
Tendolkar 2012 was an exploratory hypothesis-generating trial
in which 34 stroke-free elderly participants with atrial fibrilla-
tion were randomly assigned to treatment with both atorvastatin
and ezetimibe (inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol)
or placebo for one year on top of normal anticoagulation. We
excluded the study as it was not possible to assess the effect at-
tributable to statin treatment.
Summers 2007 was a cognitive sub-study within the Lipid Lower-
ingandOnsetof Renal Disease (LORD)randomiseddouble-blind
placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to
atorvastatin 10 mg/day or matching placebo and all had chronic
kidney disease. We excluded the trial due to its short duration.
Three studies were excluded from the 2009 review and this up-
date (Muldoon 2000; Muldoon 2004; Santanello 1997). All three
studies followed participants for only six months and so failed to
meet our duration criteria. In addition, participants in Muldoon
2000 had a mean age of 46 years and Muldoon 2004 had a mean
age of 53 years and so were not considered to be at risk of dementia
over the follow-up period.
Ongoing studies
Two further studies are ongoing: PODCAST 2013 (Prevention
of Decline in Cognition after Stroke Trial) and The European
Society of Hypertension - Chinese Hypertension League Stroke
in Hypertension Optimal Treatment (ESH-CHL-SHOT 2014)
randomised trial.
PODCAST 2013 is a multi-centre, prospective, randomised,
open-label, blinded-endpoint, controlled partial-factorial phase
IV trial in secondary and primary care aiming to recruit 100 par-
ticipants who are post-ischaemic stroke by three to seven months
from 30 UK Stroke Research Network sites. Participants with is-
chaemic stroke are randomised to intensive versus guideline lipid
lowering with ezetimibe and a resin. The primary outcome is cog-
nitive function measured by the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Exam-
ination-Revised (ACE-R), which includes the MMSE. There are
also other cognitive secondary outcomes: MoCA (Montreal Cog-
nitive Assessment), TICS, Stroop test and Trail Making A & B;
there is also a blood pressure lowering arm of the trial. As there is
no placebo arm, it will not be suitable for inclusion in this review.
ESH-CHL-SHOT 2014 is a prospective multi-national RCT with
a 3 x 2 factorial design comparing three different systolic blood
pressure targets and two different LDL cholesterol targets in par-
ticipants with hypertension and a stroke or transient Ischaemic
attack one to six months before randomisation. Cognitive decline
as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and
dementia are secondary outcomes. The study aims to recruit 925
participants with four years of follow-up. Investigators are free
to choose the statin (among those approved in each country). As
there is no placebo arm, it will not be suitable for inclusion in this
review.

study.
Allocation (selection bias)
In HPS 2002, potentially eligible people entered a pre randomi-
sation ’run-in’ phase, which was intended chiefly to limit subse-
quent randomisation to people likely to take the randomly allo-
cated study medication for at least five years. A central telephone
randomisation system using a minimisation algorithm was used
to balance the treatment groups; this appeared adequate.
PROSPER 2002 used a computerised pseudo-random number
generator, which consisted of balanced blocks of size 4. Randomi-
sation was done by telephone call or through fax exchange with
the study data centre. This appeared satisfactory.

 Blinding (performance bias and detection bias)
In HPS 2002, blinding of participants and key study personnel
occurred and it was unlikely that the blinding could have been
broken except in a medical emergency. Comment: probably done.
In PROSPER 2000, all study personnel, including the endpoint
adjudication committee, remained unaware of the allocated study
medication status of the participants throughout the study. Emer-
gency unblinding was available via an interactive voice response
telephone system. There were only two requests for emergency
unblinding. Comment: appeared adequate.
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
In HPS 2002, small numbers in both groups were lost to follow-
up; 37 in the simvastatin group: three due to death, 34 due to
morbidity and 30 in the placebo group: four due to death, 26
due to morbidity. In total, there were 1328 (12.9%) deaths in the
simvastatin group and 1507 (14.7%) deaths in the placebo group
during the scheduled treatment period.
In PROSPER 2000, similar numbers in both groups discontinued
with similar reasons, with approximately 25% in each group over
the 3.2-year follow-up. A total of 725 participants discontinued in
the placebo group: 116 due to a non-fatal adverse event, 240 died,
311 refused to participate or did not attend, 58 other reasons.
In addition seven withdrew consent. A total of 724 discontinued
in the pravastatin group: 107 due to non-fatal adverse events,
219 died, 346 refused to participate or did not attend, 52 other
reasons. In addition five withdrew consent. In total, there were
298 (10.3%) deaths in the pravastatin group and 306 (10.5%)
deaths in the placebo group over the mean follow-up of 3.2 years.
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
There was no evidence of selective reporting.
Other potential sources of bias
We identified no other potential sources of bias.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Statins
compared with placebo for prevention of dementia
We judged that efficacy data could not be combined from the two
studies as they measured different cognitive outcomes at different
time points. We synthesised adverse events data. Please refer to
Summary of findings for the main comparison.
Incidence of dementia: there was no evidence of a difference
in the incidence of dementia between the statin group (31 cases,
0.3%) and the placebo group (31 cases, 0.3%), but the result
was imprecise and we downgraded the evidence to moderate (OR
1.00, 98% CI 0.61 to 1.65, 20,536 participants, moderate quality
evidence) (HPS 2002).
Cognitive change from baseline: the MD between groups
(pravastatin-placebo) in change from baseline to last on-treatment
visit for various cognitive tests was as follows: change in MMSE
MD 0.06 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.16, 5804 participants, high quality
evidence), number of correct letter digit codes MD -0.01 (95%
CI -0.25 to 0.23, 5804 participants, high quality evidence), num-
ber of words remembered in the Picture-Word Learning Test MD
0.02 (95% CI -0.12 to 0.16, 5804 participants, high quality evi-
dence), time needed to complete the Stroop test MD 0.8 seconds
(95% CI -0.4 to 2.0, 5804 participants, high quality evidence)
(PROSPER 2002).
Difference in mean TICS-m score: between the two treatment
groups at final visit (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.12, to 0.16, 20,536
participants, high quality evidence). A TICS-m score below 22
out of 39 was pre-specified as indicative of some cognitive im-
pairment. No significant difference observed between the treat-
ment groups in percentage of participants classified as cognitively
impaired either overall (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04, 20,536
participants, high quality evidence) or in subgroups defined with
respect to their age at study entry (under 65 years: OR 0.95, 95%
CI 0.85 to 1.05, 9839 participants; 65 to 69 years: OR 1.02, 95%
CI 0.90 to 1.16, 4891 participants; 70 to 80 years: OR 0.93, 95%
CI 0.84 to 1.04, 2045 participants, high quality evidence) (HPS
2002).
Incidence and severity of adverse events: in HPS 2002, discon-
tinuation of allocated treatment was attributed to adverse events
for similar numbers of participants in the two groups (4.8%
with simvastatin-allocated versus 5.1% with placebo-allocated).
In PROSPER 2002, 107 (3.7%) pravastatin-allocated participants
and 116 (3.98%) placebo-allocated participants withdrew due to
a non-fatal adverse event. When data were combined in a meta-
analysis, there was no evidence of a difference in withdrawal rates
between groups (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05, 26,340 partici-
pant, high quality of evidence). In PROSPER 2002, there was an
increased incidence of newly diagnosed cancers in the pravastatin
group (25% more frequent compared to placebo) (see Agreements
and disagreements with other studies or reviews).
PROSPER 2002 reported serious adverse events. One or more
events were reported by 1604 (55%) participants allocated to
placebo and by 1608 (56%) participants allocated to pravastatin
(OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.13, 5804 participants, high quality
evidence).
Effect on liver and muscle enzymes: in PROSPER 2002 there
were no reported cases of rhabdomyolysis; in HPS 2002, rhab-
domyolysis developed in five simvastatin-allocated and three
placebo-allocated participants (combined analysis OR 1.67, 95%
CI 0.40 to 6.98, 26,340 participants, moderate quality of evi-
dence,downgradeddue toimprecision).In PROSPER 2002, there
were 36 instances of reported myalgia in the pravastatin group and
32 in the placebo group (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.83, 5804
participants, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to im-
precision); in HPS 2002, myopathy developed in five simvastatin-

 allocated and one placebo-allocated participants (OR 5.00, 95%
CI 0.58 to 42.81, 20,536 participants).
In PROSPER 2002, the three month visit was the only formal sa-
fety laboratory assessment and there were no participants in either
group with creatine kinase concentrations higher than 10 times the
upper limit of normal (ULN). There was one participant in each
group with greater than three times ULN plasma concentrations
of alanine and aspartate transaminases. In HPS 2002, 19 simvas-
tatin-allocated and 13 placebo-allocated participants had creatine
kinase four to 10 times ULN and 11 simvastatin-allocated versus
six placebo-allocated participants had creatine kinase greater than
10 times ULN.
HPS 2002 measured blood concentrations of alanine aminotrans-
ferase at each follow-up visit. There was no significant difference
between the groups in the numbers of participants whose study
treatment was stopped because of elevated liver enzymes (OR
1.39, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.15, 5804 participants, moderate quality of
evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). In PROSPER 2002,
one participant in each group (pravastatin and placebo) had in-
creased plasma concentrations of alanine and aspartate transami-
nases (greater than three times ULN).
In HPS 2002, 14 simvastatin-allocated and 11 placebo-allocated
participants had attempted suicide; 67 simvastatin-allocated and
60 placebo-allocated participants had developed some other psy-
chiatric disorder.
In PROSPER 2002, there were no significant differences between
the groups in function over time as measured by the Barthel index
(MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.15, 5804 participants, high quality
of evidence) or in the IADL questionnaire (MD 0.03, 95% CI -
0.08 to 0.14, 5804 participants, high quality of evidence).
Subgroups
Effect of ApoE genotype: one follow-up prospective study from
PROSPER assessed the association between ApoE4 and cogni-
tive decline in elderly adults. Of the 5804 participants recruited
into the study, ApoE genotyping was available for 95.5%; 4155
were classified as E4- and 1389 as E4+. At baseline, participants
in the E4+ group performed significantly less well on the Stroop
test and Picture-Word Recall (immediate and delayed) than par-
ticipants in the E4- group and had marginally, but significantly,
poorer scores on the MMSE. Over the mean 3.2 years of follow-
up, ApoE4 status significantly influenced change in scores on the
cognitive tests associated with memory (immediate and delayed
Picture-Word Recall) but not those for attention and information
processing (Stroop, Letter-Digit Coding). Participants in the E4+
group had significantly greater decrements than participants in
the E4- group on MMSE, Barthel Index, and IADL scores. Treat-
ment assignment (i.e. to placebo or pravastatin) was included in
the multi-variate models and there was no significant interaction
between ApoE4 genotype, treatment and cognition. There were
no significant associations with any of the tests, confirming the
lack of effect of statin therapy on cognition.
From the further analysis published in PROSPER 2010, there
was no difference in pravastatin and placebo groups in cognitive
decline in men or women, people with or without a history of
vascular disease or history of diabetes, with low or high HDL and
total cholesterol levels (all P value > 0.05). There was an effect
of pravastatin on processing speed within the ApoE2 carriers and
within the low cholesterol group but this finding lost statistical
significance after correction for multiple testing, and there was no
consistent parallel change in other cognitive performance tests.
In HPS 2002, age at study entry was not associated with any sig-
nificant difference between the treatment groups in percentage of
participants defined as cognitively impaired, that is, in participants
aged under 65 years, statin users were no less likely to develop
dementia than participants in the placebo group, likewise for par-
ticipants in the 65- to 69-years age group and the 70- to 80-years
age group.

Summary of main results
Two studies including 26,340 people contributed data relevant to
the primary outcomes of this review. The evidence showed that
statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease have
no effect on the incidence of dementia or on cognitive decline.
HPS 2002 evaluated simvastatin in the prevention of heart disease
among 20,536 older adults, including 5806 people aged 70 to 80
years at baseline. Despite significantly reduced rates of myocardial
infarction, stroke and revascularisation procedures, there was no
significant difference between treatment groups in the percentages
of participants classified as cognitively impaired either in the whole
study population or in subgroups classified by their age at study
entry, ortheirprevioushistoryof cerebrovasculardisease. The same
numbers of participants in each treatment group were reported to
have developed dementia during follow-up (31 in each group).
In PROSPER 2002, 5804 people aged 70 to 82 years were ran-
domised to either pravastatin or placebo. These participants were
considered to be at moderate risk of developing dementia over the
mean 3.2 years of follow-up. Despite a 34% reduction in LDL
cholesterol and a significant reduction in the primary endpoint
of composite coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and
fatal or non-fatal stroke in the pravastatin group, there was no sig-
nificant effect on cognitive function measured using several cog-
nitive tests.
Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non-fatal adverse events
were less than 5% in both studies. There was no difference between
statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse
events. PROSPER reported serious adverse events separately and,
again, these did not differ between treatment groups.

 Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This review provided some evidence towards the answer to the re-
view question. However, the studies identified were not sufficient
to answer all of the objectives of the review. Our primary interest
was in the prevention of dementia. Neither study systematically
ascertained dementia at baseline although both attempted to ex-
clude people with pre-existing dementia or significant cognitive
impairment. Only HPS 2002 included incidence of dementia as
an outcome, but the criteria used to identify dementia were not
clear.
Cognition was a tertiary endpoint in both included studies and
neither included a comprehensive cognitive assessment although
PROSPER 2002, which used the MMSE and several neuropsy-
chological tests, was more informative in cognitive terms than the
HPS 2002 study, which used a telephone interview only. Decline
in cognition was very low in both studies and this may relate to
careful control of cardiovascular risk factors. This parallels the ab-
sence of decline in two VaD clinical trials; the control of cardio-
vascular risk factors is common in both (Black 2003; Wilkinson
2003).
Both studies included a large number of participants at risk of
cognitive decline, follow-up was sufficient, one study included the
lipophilic statin simvastatin (HPS 2002), and one study included
the hydrophilic statin pravastatin (PROSPER 2002). There were
adequate data on adverse effects in both studies. There were data
on function in ADL and on change in cognition accounting for
prior cholesterol level, ApoE genotype and cognitive level along
with functional performance from PROSPER 2002 only. There
were no data on quality of life or behaviour.
Both studies included participants at moderate to high risk of
vascular events; therefore, the results may not apply to people at
low vascular risk.
Quality of the evidence
Both studies were at low risk of bias. However, there were key
methodological limitations concerning cognitive outcomes as cog-
nition was a tertiary endpoint in both studies. HPS 2002 had
no baseline cognitive data and included only one cognitive test
(TICS-m), it recorded incidence of dementia but event rates were
very low. Our estimate for the effect of statin treatment on de-
mentia incidence was imprecise (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.65),
so we downgraded the quality of the evidence for this outcome to
moderate. PROSPER 2002 used different cognitive tests at differ-
ent time points and incidence of dementia was not an outcome.
Loss to follow-up was low in HPS 2002, but most cases of mor-
tality were not included in this statistic (three participants in the
simvastatin group lost to follow-up due to mortality, 1328 partic-
ipants died in total in the simvastatin group; four participants in
the placebo group lost to follow-up due to mortality, 1507 par-
ticipants died in total in the placebo group). In PROSPER 2002,
724 participants in the pravastatin group and 725 participants in
the placebo group withdrew due to various reasons; 219 partici-
pants died in the pravastatin group and 240 participants died in
the placebo group. All analyses were by intention to treat.
Potential biases in the review process
It is likely that we identified all relevant studies and obtained all
relevant data due to the strengths of the search strategy and review
process.We donotbelieve thatwe introducedbiasusingourreview
methods.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The question of whether statins were of benefit in the preven-
tion of dementia stemmed from cross-sectional studies in the early
2000s; initial evidence was very promising with some estimates
of risk reduction of more than two-thirds (Jick 2000; Wolozin
2000). However, these studies were subject to important limita-
tions. How representative people in these databases were of the
general population was unclear and information on important
confounding factors, such as education, was unavailable. Cross-
sectional studies are subject to indication bias, which occurs when
a drug is prescribed for a reason that itself is associated with an out-
come of interest. Of note from the Wolozin 2000 study, while the
data were being collected (1996 to 1998), physicians were more
likely to have prescribed statins to people who were ’more highly
educated, attentive, inquisitive and concerned about their future
health’ (Haley 2000), than people at higher risk of dementia. This
may also explain why an effect was seen for pravastatin and lovas-
tatin but not simvastatin, sales of which lagged behind the former
two.
Subsequent systematic reviews have been carried out. Wong 2013
identified 20 relevant studies, comprising 16 cohort studies, three
case-control studies and one RCT. In one meta-analysis, there were
modest protective effects of statin use for any dementia (random
effects pooled RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.97) and AD (random
effects pooled RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80). There was sub-
stantial heterogeneity in the effect sizes for any dementia, but not
for AD. Of note, effect sizes were smaller and closer to the null
in studies that had controlled for more confounders, and where a
clinical diagnosis as opposed to linkage to health records was used
to establish dementia incidence. Song 2013 performed a meta-
analysis of prospective cohort studies but was much less compre-
hensive and several studies were missed. They found a reduced
incidence of dementia in statin users but there was considerable
heterogeneity (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.81, I2 = 70.8%).
When considering the increased cancer incidence in PROSPER
2002 in the pravastatin group compared to the placebo group,
17

 a meta-analysis carried out by the study authors of cancer rates
in previous randomised placebo-controlled studies lasting more
than three years revealed no increased incidence in pravastatin or
all statin users, which is reassuring, but this outcome should be
included in future RCTs of statins. There was no increased in-
cidence of newly diagnosed cancer in HPS 2002 in the simvas-
tatin group compared to the placebo group (814 simvastatin-allo-
cated participants versus 803 placebo-allocated participants; RR
1.0, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11). Subsequently, one systematic review
found six meta-analyses of RCTs and two meta-analyses of RCTs
and observational studies found no association between statin use
and overall incident cancer risk (Bondreau 2010).
Overall, it is still unclear how dyslipidaemia exerts its effects on
dementia risk; the association may vary depending upon the age at
which cholesterol level is assessed and the follow-up interval. The
World Alzheimer Report found studies where the exposure was as-
sessed in mid-life were more likely to report a positive association
than short latency studies where exposure was assessed in late-life
shortly before the onset of dementia (Prince 2014). It is postulated
that cholesterol levels may decline more rapidly from mid-life to
late-life in people who go on to develop dementia, particularly
AD. Of note in the Honolulu Asia Aging Study (HASS) (Stewart
2007), the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging in the USA
(Beydoun 2011), the Prospective Population Study of Women in
Sweden (Mielke 2010), and Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging
and Dementia (CAIDE) in Finland (Solomon 2007), a more rapid
decline in total cholesterol from mid to late life was predictive of
the onset of AD. The only study which did not replicate this find-
ing was the Framingham Heart Study (Tan 2003). This decline
in total cholesterol could be causal, could reflect reverse causality
or could be accounted for by confounding. In order to address
this question, ideally large RCTs would run for many years assess-
ing cognitive decline in statin users compared to non-users but
these would be extremely expensive and labour intensive. It is also
unfeasible, as many people at risk of dementia will be prescribed
statins for other reasons.
Limitations
This review is limited primarily by the lack of evidence from well-
designed RCTs in which cognition is a primary outcome. Ideally,
large RCTs would run for many years in order to assess cognitive
decline in statin users compared to non-users but this is not feasible
due to costs involved and as many participants at risk of dementia
will be prescribed statins for other reasons.

Implications for practice
There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk
of vascular disease have no effect in preventing cognitive decline
or dementia. Inclusion of statins for this indication on national or
local formularies is not currently warranted.
Implications for research
Statins to date have not been shown to be beneficial in the preven-
tion of dementia in randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the gold
standard of clinical research. However, there remain unanswered
questions, as there were insufficient data in the current trials to
address the following questions.
• Whether there is a relationship between the occurrence of
disease and the level of cholesterol - as one’s cholesterol rises does
the risk of disease rise in some graded fashion or does a rapid
decline in total cholesterol from mid to late life predict onset of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD)?
• Whether lowering of cholesterol levels judged normal in the
developed parts of the world might influence the onset of disease.
• Whether people with a family history of AD might
preferentially benefit from therapy compared to people without a
family history.
• Whether therapy started in middle life has an advantage
over therapy started people in their 60s or early 70s.
Further RCTs may address these questions but costs and logistics
make this difficult.

Participants
100 participants from 30 UK Stroke Research Network sites who were post ischaemic stroke by 3-7 months
Interventions
Intensive vs. guideline BP lowering (target systolic < 125 mmHg vs. < 140 mmHg); intensive vs. guideline
lipid lowering (target LDL cholesterol < 1.4 mmol/L vs. < 3 mmol/L)
Outcomes
Primary: cognitive decline as measured by the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination - Revised
Secondary: feasibility of recruitment and retention of participants, tolerability and safety of the interventions,
achieving and maintaining the BP and lipid targets, maintaining differences in SBP (> 10 mmHg) and LDL
cholesterol (> 1 mmol/L) between the treatment groups, and performing clinic and telephone follow-up of
cognition measures
Starting date
2013
