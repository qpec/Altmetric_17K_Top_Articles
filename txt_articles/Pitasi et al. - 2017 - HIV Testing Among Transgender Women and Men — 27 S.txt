HIV Testing Among Transgender Women and Men — 
27 States and Guam, 2014–2015

Transgender persons are at high risk for human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV) infection; in a recent analysis of the results 
of over nine million CDC funded HIV tests, transgender 
women* had the highest percentage of confirmed positive 
results (2.7%) of any gender category (1). Transgender men,† 
particularly those who have sex with cisgender§ men, are also at 
high risk for infection (2). HIV testing is critical for detecting 
and treating persons who are infected and delivering preventive 
services to those who are uninfected. CDC recommends that 
persons at high risk for HIV infection be screened for HIV at 
least annually, although transgender persons are not specified 
in the current recommendations. CDC analyzed data from 
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to 
describe HIV testing among transgender women and men 
and two cisgender comparison groups in 27 states and Guam. 
After adjusting for demographic characteristics, transgender 
women and men had a lower prevalence of ever testing and 
past year testing for HIV (35.6% and 31.6% ever, and 10.0% 
and 10.2% past year, respectively) compared with cisgender 
gay and bisexual men (61.8% ever and 21.6% past year) and 
instead reported testing at levels comparable to cisgender het-
erosexual men and women (35.2% ever, and 8.6% past year). 
This finding suggests that transgender women and men might 
not be sufficiently reached by current HIV testing measures. 
Tailoring HIV testing activities to overcome the unique barriers 
faced by transgender women and men might increase rates of 
testing among these populations.
BRFSS is an annual, state-based, random-digit–dialed cel-
lular and landline telephone survey of the noninstitutional-
ized U.S. adult population.¶ Gender identity was uniformly 
assessed in an optional module used by 20 jurisdictions** in 
2014 and 22 jurisdictions†† in 2015. Fourteen jurisdictions 
participated in the module during both years, six participated 
only in 2014, and eight participated only in 2015, for a total 
 * Persons assigned male sex at birth who identify as woman, transgender woman, 
or another transfeminine identity.
 † Persons assigned female sex at birth who identify as man, transgender man, 
or another transmasculine identity.
 § Persons whose sex assigned at birth is the same as their gender identity or expression.

of 28. Jurisdiction-specific response rates ranged from 33.0% 
to 59.2%§§ and 34.4% to 57.6%¶¶ in 2014 and 2015, 
respectively. Transgender respondents were defined as those 
who answered affirmative to the question if they considered 
themselves to be transgender. Those who answered affirmative 
were asked to identify as male-to-female (defined as transgender 
women in this report), female-to-male (defined as transgender 
men in this report), or gender nonconforming. Because of small 
sample size, responses from gender nonconforming persons 
(n = 272) were not included in this analysis.
Pooled data collected in 2014 and 2015 were used to 
compare demographic characteristics and HIV testing among 
transgender and cisgender respondents. Cisgender men who 
reported sexual orientations of gay or bisexual represent a 
group at high risk for HIV infection (3). Cisgender men and 
women who reported an orientation of straight (hereafter 
referred to as cisgender heterosexual men and women) rep-
resent a group at lower risk for infection (4). The proportion 
of respondents who reported ever and past year HIV testing 
was calculated, and unadjusted prevalence ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals were estimated to identify characteris-
tics associated with ever testing among transgender women 
and men. Multivariable logistic regression models compared 
self-reported prevalence of ever and past year testing among 
transgender women and men with cisgender gay and bisexual 
men while adjusting for characteristics associated with testing 
in univariate models (p<0.10). All estimates were weighted to 
account for the complex multistage sampling design; because 
only 14 of 28 jurisdictions participated in the optional mod-
ule during both years of data collection, weights for these 14 
jurisdictions were averaged across the 2-year period to account 
for varying levels of participation over time. Estimates with 
relative standard error ≥30% were not reported.
During 2014–2015, 28 jurisdictions collected data on 
gender identity, resulting in a total sample of 732 trans-
gender women, 451 transgender men, 3,798 cisgender gay 
and bisexual men, and 301,524 cisgender heterosexual men 
and women (Table 1). The unadjusted prevalence of ever 
testing for HIV was 37.5% among transgender women, 
36.6% among transgender men, 66.2% among cisgen-
der gay and bisexual men, and 35.2% among cisgender

of past year testing was 11.7% among transgender women, 
12.4% among transgender men, 27.5% among cisgender 
gay and bisexual men, and 8.6% among cisgender hetero-
sexual men and women.
Black transgender women (62.6%) and men (66.9%) had a 
higher prevalence of ever testing than their white counterparts 
(33.2% and 30.7%, respectively). Among transgender women, 
the highest prevalence of ever testing (68.5%) was reported by 
those who had ever received a diagnosis of a depressive disorder 
(Table 2). After adjusting for demographic characteristics, 
transgender women and men had a lower prevalence of ever 
testing and past year testing for HIV (35.6% and 31.6% ever, 
and 10.0% and 10.2% past year, respectively) compared with

Discussion
Despite the high risk for HIV infection previously reported 
among transgender populations, nearly two thirds of transgender 
women and men in the sample reported never testing for HIV, 
which is consistent with evidence suggesting that many HIV-
infected transgender women are not aware of their status (5). 
The prevalences of ever and past year testing among transgender 
women and men were comparable to those among cisgender 
heterosexual men and women, a group at much lower risk for 
infection. Transgender women and men reported a substantially 
lower prevalence of ever and past year testing than did cisgender 
gay and bisexual men. These findings indicate that current self-
reported HIV testing levels among transgender women and men 
are inconsistent with their HIV risk profiles. Innovative, tailored 
approaches might be needed to reach transgender persons who 
are not being reached by existing HIV prevention strategies that 
focus on other key populations, such as gay, bisexual, and other 
men who have sex with men.***
Black transgender women and men were more likely than 
their white counterparts to report ever testing, which might 
reflect success of expanded testing measures focused among 
black communities (6) or might be a response to racial/eth-
nic disparities in HIV infection reported among transgender 
women (1,5). Transgender women who ever received a diag-
nosis of depressive disorder were more likely than those who 
had not to report ever testing; this is consistent with previous 
findings in the U.S. general population (7). However, few 
other differences in testing prevalence across demographic 
subgroups were identified, indicating widespread opportuni-
ties for improvement of testing measures aimed toward all 
transgender women and men who are at risk for HIV infec-
tion. Such measures should account for the unique barriers 
to testing that many transgender persons might face, such as 
 *** https://effectiveinterventions.cdc.gov/en.
HIV stigma within the transgender community (8), gender 
identity stigma in health care settings (9), and socioeconomic 
marginalization (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, the proportion of transgender respondents was 
small (<1%), which reduced the precision of HIV testing 
estimates. Second, BRFSS transgender data are only repre-
sentative of transgender persons in the 28 jurisdictions that 
participated in the optional module and therefore cannot be 
generalized to the entire U.S. transgender population. Third, 
the measure of gender identity might incorrectly classify 
transgender respondents who self-identify simply as man or 
woman rather than transgender man or woman, which would 
potentially underestimate the number of transgender persons 
in the sample. Finally, because BRFSS does not ask questions 
about HIV status or sexual risk behaviors, the analytic sample 
might have included respondents who are already living with 
HIV infection or who are not at risk for HIV infection and 
therefore would be less likely to have tested for HIV in the 
past year or at all.
The findings of this analysis indicate suboptimal rates of 
HIV testing among transgender women and men. The pop-
ulation-based estimates in this report can serve as a baseline 
for future monitoring of testing trends among transgender 
persons. Intensified and expanded use of culturally appro-
priate recruitment methods by public health officials might 
enhance activities to reach transgender women and men and 
increase the rates of testing. CDC is currently working to 
enhance the capacity of community-based organizations to 
provide targeted HIV testing in addition to other preven-
tion and support services to transgender persons who are 
at risk for or have newly diagnosed HIV. These programs 
and other innovative approaches are needed to improve 
delivery of HIV testing and other prevention services to 
transgender persons.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Transgender persons are at high risk for HIV infection. CDC 
recommends that persons at high risk for HIV infection be 
screened for HIV at least annually, but transgender persons 
are not specified in the current recommendations, and 
current nationwide HIV testing rates for transgender persons 
are unknown.
What is added by this report?
This analysis of 2014 and 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System data showed that transgender women and 
men self-reported a lower prevalence of HIV testing (both ever 
and in the past year) compared with gay and bisexual men 
whose gender identities match their sex assignments at birth 
(cisgender). Transgender women and men self-reported testing 
at levels similar to cisgender heterosexual men and women.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Transgender women and men reported current HIV testing 
levels that were inconsistent with their HIV risk profiles. 
Innovative, tailored approaches might be needed to reach 
transgender persons who are not being reached by existing HIV 
prevention strategies that focus on other key populations, such 
as gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.
