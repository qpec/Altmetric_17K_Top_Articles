ABSTRACT 
Background: Autism is a dimensional condition, representing the extreme end of a 
continuum of social competence that extends throughout the general population. 
Currently, little is known about how autistic social traits (ASTs), measured across the 
full spectrum of severity, develop during childhood and adolescence, including whether 
there are developmental differences between boys and girls. Therefore, we sought to 
chart the trajectories of ASTs in the general population across childhood and 
adolescence, with a focus on gender differences.  
 
Methods: Participants were 9,744 males (n=4,784) and females (n=4,960) from 
ALSPAC, a UK birth-cohort study. ASTs were assessed when participants were aged 7, 
10, 13 and 16 years, using the parent-report Social Communication Disorders Checklist. 
Data were modelled using latent growth curve analysis.  
 
Results: Developmental trajectories of males and females were non-linear, showing a 
decline from 7 to 10 years, followed by an increase between 10 and 16 years. At seven 
years, males had higher levels of ASTs than females (mean raw score difference=0.88, 
95% CI [.72, 1.04]), and were more likely (odds ratio [OR] = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.82, 2.16) to 
score in the clinical range on the SCDC. By 16 years this gender difference had 
disappeared: males and females had, on average, similar levels of ASTs (mean 
difference= 0.00, 95% CI [-.19, .19]) and were equally likely to score in the SCDC’s 
clinical range (OR=0.91, 95% CI, 0.73, 1.10). This was the result of an increase in 
females’ ASTs between 10 and 16 years. 
 
  
3 
Conclusions and relevance: There are gender-specific trajectories of autistic social 
impairment, with females more likely than males to experience an escalation of ASTs 
during early and mid adolescence. It remains to be discovered whether the observed 
female adolescent increase in ASTs represents the genuine late onset of social 
difficulties or earlier, subtle, pre-existing difficulties becoming more obvious.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTISTIC SOCIAL TRAITS ACROSS CHILDHOOD AND 
ADOLESCENCE IN MALES AND FEMALES 
 
Autism Spectrum Disorder (hereafter ‘autism’) is characterised by often severe and 
impairing difficulties with social relatedness and social communication (American 
Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). Autism is a dimensional condition, which sits at 
the extreme of a continuum of social impairment that extends throughout the general 
population (Constantino, 2009). This is suggested by observations in general-
population samples of a continuous distribution of autistic social traits (ASTs), with no 
natural cut-point between autism and sub-clinical social difficulties (Constantino & 
Todd, 2003; Skuse et al., 2009). Further, specific cognitive (e.g., Baron-Cohen, 
Wheelwright, Hill, Raste & Plumb, 2001) and genetic (e.g., Robinson et al., 2011; 
Robinson et al., 2016) aetiological risk factors are associated both with autism and 
social variability within the non-clinical range. 
 
ASTs are a risk factor for the development of a broad array of emotional, behavioural, 
social and functional difficulties (Lundström et al., 2011; Mandy, Skuse, Steer, St 
Pourcain & Oliver, 2013; Oliver, Barker, Mandy, Skuse & Maughan, 2011). This 
association is linear, across the full range of severity: there is not a threshold below 
which ASTs confer no risk for co-occurring problems (Skuse et al., 2009). Thus, even 
AST variability within the normal range is relevant to understanding risk and resilience 
in development.  
 
Despite their importance within developmental psychopathology, relatively little is 
known about the developmental trajectory of autistic traits. This is in contrast to other 
  
5 
conditions, such as conduct problems, depression and anxiety, the developmental 
courses of which have been studied for several decades (e.g., Kovacs, Feinberg, Crouse-
Novak, Paulauskas, & Finkelstein, 1984; Robins, 1966; Cote, Tremblay, Nagin, Zoccolillo 
& Vitaro, 2002). Most research on the developmental course of autistic symptoms has 
focused on participants with a clinical diagnosis of autism who, by definition, represent 
the extreme high end of the autism trait continuum. This work has found a high degree 
of stability in autistic symptoms over time amongst autistic children (Fountain, Winter 
& Bearman, 2012; Gotham, Pickles & Lord, 2012; Lord, Luyster, Guthrie & Pickles, 2012; 
Szatmari et al., 2015; Venker, Ray-Subramanian, Bolt, Ellis Weismer, 2014). Such 
research provides valuable clinical and theoretical insights into autism, but leaves 
several questions unanswered. First, studies that only include autistic participants 
cannot test whether sub-clinical autistic traits also show stability across development.  
In particular, such investigations are not suited to testing whether autistic traits ever 
escalate during development, as any individuals showing such a trajectory would be 
excluded from studies that preselect participants for having high autistic traits (i.e., 
autism) at baseline.  Second, most work on symptom trajectories of autistic people has 
focused on infancy and early childhood, and so autistic trait development during late 
childhood and adolescence is currently poorly understood. Third, selecting children 
diagnosed with autism, which has a male-to-female ratio of approximately three-to-one 
(Loomes, Hull & Mandy, 2017), limits the number of female participants, and so reduces 
power for studying any sex/gender differences in AST developmental trajectory.  
 
The small extant literature on the development of autistic traits across the full 
continuum of severity only partially addresses these gaps in knowledge.  In studies that 
have calculated correlations between autism traits measured at two timepoints in non-
  
6 
clinical samples, there is evidence for within-person continuity across late childhood 
and adolescence. In a mixed-age (8 to 20 years) sample of male twins (N=95 twin pairs), 
Constantino and colleagues (2009) observed high autism trait stability (ICC=.71) over a 
five-year period. Similarly, in a larger longitudinal twin study (N>6,000 twin pairs), 
Holmboe and colleagues (2014) found substantial bivariate correlations for males 
(r=.67, 95% CI [.66, .69]) and females (r=.60, 95% CI [.58, .62]) between autism trait 
scores at 8 and 12 years.  
 
Another study, which examined the association between parent-rated autism traits in 
toddlerhood and self-reported autism traits in late adolescence, presents a somewhat 
different picture, having reported a low correlation for males (r=.16) and no association 
in females (r=.06, ns) (Whitehouse, Hickey & Ronald, 2011). Yet, the interpretation of 
these findings is complicated by methodological factors. First, autism traits were 
measured by parent report at baseline and self report in adolescence which may have 
depressed estimates of trait stability. Second, the long time period between the two 
assessment waves does not allow for a fine-grained understanding of the development 
of symptoms during this time. For example, the low correlations between toddler and 
late adolescent autism traits could reflect a general lack of continuity, but would also be 
compatible with a situation in which there is continuity in childhood, followed by 
discontinuities in adolescence.  
 
Robinson and colleagues (2011) went some way towards providing a more detailed 
picture of autism symptom trajectories across childhood and adolescence, as they 
performed analyses incorporating three timepoints. They investigated ASTs in a large 
(N=6,339) general population sample, assessed aged seven, 10 and 13 years by parent 
  
7 
report. They found within-person stability in ASTs between seven and 13 years, for both 
boys and girls. Nevertheless, this belied a shallow, U-shaped AST trajectory, with boys’ 
and girls’ scores falling between seven and 10 years, and rising between 10 and 13 
years. It is uncertain whether the rise in ASTs from 10 to 13 years levels off in 
adolescence, or whether it continues beyond 13 years as an increase in observed ASTs 
in the teenage years.  The current literature reveals little about autism trait trajectories 
after 13 years.  The first aim of the current study is therefore to extend the work of 
Robinson and colleagues beyond 13 years, to chart the trajectory of ASTs beyond early 
adolescence. 
 
Sex/Gender differences 
Females who have severe autistic traits are less likely than equivalent males to receive 
an autism diagnosis (Dworzynski, Ronald, Bolton & Happé, 2012; Lai, Lombard, 
Auyeung, Chakrabarti & Baron-Cohen, 2015; Russell, Steer & Golding, 2011). This 
diagnostic bias is partly due to the existence of a female autism phenotype; a female-
specific presentation that is somewhat at odds with the current, male-based, 
conceptualisation of autism (APA, 2013; Lai et al., 2015). Efforts to reverse current 
biases against females with high levels of autistic symptoms rely on the development of 
an empirically-based understanding of how autism and autistic traits present in girls 
and women.  
 
To date, research on sex/gender differences in autistic symptoms has almost exclusively 
used cross-sectional designs (Van Wijngaarden-Cremers et al., 2014). This represents a 
significant limitation of the literature since a better understanding of sex/gender 
differences across the lifespan would help improve recognition and support of autistic 
  
8 
difficulties of females. Further, the literature on the developmental course of autism 
traits across the full range of severity, described above, raises the possibility of gender-
specific trajectories: two of the three studies to include both genders reported lower 
levels of autism trait stability in females than males (Holmboe et al., 2014; Whitehouse 
et al. 2011). In the current longitudinal study, we critically extend understanding of 
ASTs in females by investigating gender differences in autism symptom trajectories. We 
do this by testing the opposing predictions of two hypotheses about the development of 
the female autistic phenotype.  
 
The female compensation hypothesis states that females with high ASTs learn over time 
to compensate for their social communication difficulties more effectively than males 
with high ASTs (Dworznyski et al., 2012; Lai et al., 2015; Mandy et al., 2012). According 
to this idea, compared to ASTs of males, ASTs in females should diminish during 
development. Support for the female compensation hypothesis comes from the finding 
that in a sample of autistic adults, retrospective informant reports suggest that females 
and males experienced similar levels of autistic difficulties in childhood; yet in 
adulthood, the females demonstrated substantially lower levels of overt autistic social 
symptoms (Lai et al., 2011). One interpretation of this finding is that severe autistic 
traits are more likely to diminish over time in females compared to males. A possible 
mechanism is suggested by the discovery that from childhood onwards, many autistic 
people learn social coping strategies to mask and compensate for their difficulties (e.g., 
Hull et al., 2017; Livingston & Happë, 2017). This is known as social camouflaging, and 
is more common in females than males (Lai et al., 2017).  
 
  
9 
An alternative idea is the adolescent emergence hypothesis, which states that compared 
to males, ASTs in females are more likely to become evident later in development – in 
adolescence rather than childhood. This idea is based on reports from autistic women 
that their social and communication difficulties only became overt in adolescence, when 
their social ecology became increasingly complex (Bargiela, Steward & Mandy, 2016); 
and fits with the observation that autistic females tend to receive their diagnosis later 
than males (Giarelli et al., 2010). Intriguingly, a version of this as-yet-untested 
hypothesis was expressed first by Hans Asperger, who wrote “it could be that autistic 
traits in the female become evident only after puberty. We just do not know” (Asperger, 
1944). This hypothesis is in direct contrast to the female compensation hypothesis, 
which predicts that females’ ASTs should diminish from childhood onwards. 
 
In summary, we sought to investigate the course of AST development in the general 
population between the ages of 7 and 16 years, with a particular focus on determining 
whether (1) there is an increase in ASTs between 10 and 16 years and (2) AST 
trajectories between 7 and 16 years differ for males and females.  
 
METHODS 
Procedure  
Participants were enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children 
(ALSPAC), a general-population, longitudinal cohort study in the South-West of England, 
comprising those with an estimated birth date between April 1991 and December 1992. 
The total ALSPAC sample comprised 14,541 pregnancies, with 13,971 children alive at 
12 months (Boyd et al., 2013). Ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Law and 
Ethics Committee and Local Research Ethics Committees.  Please note that the study 
  
10 
website contains details of all the data that is available through a fully searchable data 
dictionary (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers). 
 
Participants 
ASTs were measured in ALSPAC at 7, 10, 13 and 16 years. ALSPAC participants were 
included in the current study if they had AST trait data from at least one of these waves 
of data collection. Of the 9,744 eligible participants, 95.9% were white, 2.5% were born 
to a teenage mother, 15.2% had a mother with a university degree, and 80.5% had a 
parent who was a homeowner. There were no gender differences for any of these 
demographic characteristics (all ps >.2).  Compared to members of the original birth 
cohort who are excluded from the current analyses, our participants were more likely to 
have a mother who: had higher or further education (OR=2.36, 95% CI [2.15,2.58]); was 
a homeowner (OR=2.93, 95% CI [2.71, 3.18]); and was not a teenager when they gave 
birth to the participant (OR=3.77, 95% CI [3.19, 4.46]).  
 
Measures 
Autistic social and communication traits were measured using the Social 
Communication Disorders Checklist (SCDC), a widely-used and well-validated 
dimensional parent-report measure of ASTs (Skuse, Mandy & Scourfield, 2005). The 
SCDC has excellent reliability (internal consistency α=.93, test-retest over 2.7 years 
r=.81) (Skuse et al., 2005). Criterion validity is demonstrated by substantial correlations 
with in-depth, well-validated measures of autistic symptoms (Bölte, Westerwald, 
Holtmann, Freitag & Poustka, 2011; Skuse et al., 2005); and by high sensitivity (.88) and 
specificity (.91) for autism when a cut-point of 8 or above is used to denote possible 
caseness (Skuse et al., 2009). Construct validity is shown by the SCDC’s high heritability 
  
11 
(.74) (Skuse et al., 2005), by its associations with impaired social cognition, pragmatic 
language impairment, peer problems and antisocial behaviour (convergent validity), 
and by a lack of/low association with age, socioeconomic status, IQ, social anxiety and 
teenage pregnancy (discriminant validity) (Bölte et al, 2011; Kothari, Skuse, Wakefield 
& Micali, 2013; Mandy et al., 2013; Pickard, Rijsdijk, Happé & Mandy, 2017; Skuse et al., 
2005). Further evidence for validity comes from the observation that genetic risk for 
clinical autism, from common and de novo variants, influences SCDC scores across the 
full range of severity (Robinson et al., 2016; St Pourcain et al., 2010).  
 
Intelligence was measured aged 8 using a short form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales 
for Children, Third Edition (WISC-III) (Wechsler, 1992), administered by trained 
psychologists. We categorised participants into low (IQ<85), average (85≤IQ≥115) and 
high (IQ>115) groups, enabling us to investigate and depict AST trajectories at different 
levels of IQ. These cut-points were chosen to map onto those used by Robinson and 
colleagues (2011), to ensure comparability of our work with that study. 
 
Analysis 
Initially, means for the SCDC administered at 7, 10, 13 and 16 years were plotted. These 
are shown for males and females in Figure 1a. The data were then modelled using 
various non-linear latent growth curve models, with latent growth factors (random 
effects) capturing heterogeneity in both baseline levels and longitudinal patterns of 
change.  Gender differences in patterns of change were studied using a multi-group 
model, which allowed growth factor means, (co)variances and residual variances to 
vary between males and females.  Time was specified as the number of years since age 7 
(with loadings 0.157, 3.221, 6.406 and 9.330) and assumed fixed for all individuals. 
  
12 
Residual variances were constrained to be longitudinally invariant within each group, 
the default in multilevel modelling.  Subsequently, IQ was included as a covariate to 
examine the association between IQ and the growth factors for SCDC, again within each 
gender as this relationship may be different for boys and girls (Skuse et al., 2009). 
To retrieve the maximum amount of information possible from the data, a Maximum 
Likelihood based approach to missing data was adopted permitting partial responders 
to be included in the sample (N=9,744). These methods make the Missing at Random 
assumption, namely that there are no systematic differences between observed and 
missing values for any dependent variable when conditioning on the remaining 
variables in the model. To investigate the robustness of our models to consequences of 
missing data, we re-ran our analyses for those with complete SCDC data (n=4,380), and 
those with one (n=6,385) or two (n=8,024) of the four SCDC data points missing (see 
Supplementary Table 1).  
 
RESULTS 
Figure 1a shows the mean scores for the SCDC at 7, 10, 13 and 16 years. Focussing on 
the mean-structure residuals from the latent growth models, two alternative 
formulations appeared suited to capturing the population average change, namely a 
two-part piecewise linear (‘spline’) model (with a knot at the second timepoint) and a 
quadratic polynomial model. Whilst the two models are of equal parsimony the 
piecewise model encountered some estimation problems due to a very strong 
correlation between the first and second slope growth factors. Consequently, we opted 
for the model that allowed mean SCDC to change as a quadratic function of age.   
 
  
13 
We used a multi-group approach and explored a range of models in which the intercept, 
slope and quadratic term variances and covariances were permitted to vary between 
genders rather than simply the growth factor means. We also considered the possibility 
that the variance of the occasion-specific (error) residuals may be different for males 
and females. By studying summary fit statistics (CFI, TLI, RMSEA), comparative fit 
statistics (sample size adjusted BIC) and the covariance structure residuals we opted for 
the model in which all variance and covariance terms were allowed to be gender variant 
(see supplementary Tables S1 and S2).  
 
Predicted scores from this model are presented in Table 1, and depicted in Figure 1a, 
demonstrating that from the age of 10 years, there was a narrowing of the gender gap in 
SCDC scores, due to a sharper increase in average SCDC scores for females compared to 
males. This is confirmed by Figure 1b, showing the estimated gender difference as a 
function of age. Here, the tendency for boys to have higher SCDC-measured traits at age 
7 diminishes over time: by the age of 16 years this gender difference is no longer 
present.  
 
[Figure 1a and 1b here] 
[Table 1 here] 
 
When we added IQ to the model we did not find evidence that IQ moderated the effect 
of gender on SCDC score, as tests for an interaction between gender and IQ were not 
significant at 7, 10, 13 or 16 years (all p values >.320) (see Figure S1 and Table S3 in the 
Supplement).  
 
  
14 
We were interested to discover whether the pattern of findings for means of 
continuously-measured ASTs held for those with severe difficulties of clinical relevance. 
To this end we examined the proportion of males and females scoring above the 
conventional clinical cut point of the SCDC (i.e., 8) at 7, 10, 13 and 16 years. We also 
inspected alternative, more stringent cut points, namely the 95th and 99th percentile.  
The results of these analyses are presented in Table 1, and show a similar pattern to the 
findings to the latent growth curve model: at 7 years males were substantially more 
likely than females to score high on the SCDC, but this gender gap declined over time 
such that by 16 years males and females were equally likely to show high levels of ASTs, 
regardless of the threshold used. 
 
In total 1,442 participants scored above the clinical threshold of the SCDC at least once 
across the four waves of data collection in the current study. The age at which these 
individuals first scored above threshold is shown in Table 2.  Females had higher odds 
than males of first being identified by the SCDC as having high ASTs in adolescence (at 
13 or 16 years) rather than in childhood (at 7 or 10 years) (OR=2.47, 95% CI [1.97, 
3.09]). 
 
[Table 2 here] 
 
DISCUSSION 
This was the first investigation of autistic social trait (AST) trajectories in the general 
population spanning late childhood (7 years) and mid-adolescence (16 years).  We 
discovered distinct AST trajectories for males and females. At seven years of age, males 
had higher ASTs than females; and these showed a shallow u-shaped curve, declining 
  
15 
between 7 and 10 years and then rising slightly from 10 to 16 years. At 16 years, males 
had, on average, lower ASTs than they had at 7 years. In contrast, females showed a 
marked escalation in ASTs during adolescence, such that by 16 years females had, on 
average, higher ASTs than they had at 7 years. By mid adolescence, there was no longer 
a tendency for females to have lower ASTs than males. These findings apply across the 
IQ range. When we looked at the individuals with very high ASTs the same pattern was 
observed: in adolescence females caught up with males, such that by 16 years males and 
females were at equal likelihood of having clinically severe levels of ASTs.  
 
This new finding of an escalation of parent-observed ASTs in females during 
adolescence contradicts the notion that females’ ASTs decline over time as they learn 
strategies to cope with and mask their social difficulties (‘female compensation 
hypothesis’). Instead, the trajectories we observed are consistent with the ‘adolescent 
onset hypothesis’, first proposed by Hans Asperger but never previously tested, that 
female ASTs appear later than those of males (Asperger, 1944). It is interesting to note 
that the female teenage increase in ASTs that we report for the first time has been 
observed for another aspect of atypical neurodevelopment: over the course of 
adolescence the male-to-female ratio for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) narrows, reflecting an increase in observable symptoms in females during this 
period (Zahn-Waxler, Crick, Shirtcliff & Woods, 2006). 
 
One interpretation of the female increase in AST scores in adolescence is that there are 
some females who have subtle social difficulties that went unnoticed by their parents in 
childhood, but which became problematic, and therefore overt, once they were required 
to navigate the increasingly complex adolescent social world. This is consistent with the 
  
16 
reports of late-diagnosed autistic women, who tend to recall childhood social 
impairments that only became severely impairing during adolescence (Bargiela et al., 
2016). Of relevance to our observation of AST increases in females but not males, there 
is some evidence that the rise in social demands upon adolescents is especially 
pronounced for females (Dunn, 2004).   
 
Another interpretation of the increase in observed ASTs of females in adolescence is 
that it reflects the genuine late-onset of new problems that were not present in 
childhood. One possibility for future investigation is that the biological changes of 
puberty could be implicated. A first step will be testing whether the increase in parent-
reported ASTs in females is specifically associated with progression through puberty, 
rather than chronological age. If this is the case, it will be valuable to consider how 
ovarian hormones like estrogen could influence ASTs, for example via its downstream 
effects on serotonin and oxytocin, and on the hypothalimic-pituitary axis (Martel, 2013). 
A related possibility is that a ‘two-hit’ mechanism could be in operation, whereby 
pubertal influences interact with pre-existing vulnerabilities (Picci & Scherf, 2015). 
Further, there is evidence that some genetic influences on social behaviour only start to 
influence the phenotype in adolescence, and it will be important to investigate whether 
such time-specific genetic effects are moderated by gender (St Pourcain et al., 2017). 
 
Another key question is whether the SCDC-measured traits we observed in adolescent 
girls are truly autistic in nature, or whether they represent a different type of social 
impairment, for example arising from the onset of internalising problems, ADHD or 
psychosis risk (St Pourcain et al., 2017). Several strands of evidence support the notion 
that the female social variability we observed in adolescence is related to autism. First, 
  
17 
our findings are compatible with observations from cross-sectional studies using 
alternative AST measures, which find females have lower levels of ASTs than males in 
child samples (Constantino & Todd, 2003) but that this gender difference is attenuated, 
or non-existent in adult samples (e.g., Kanne, Christ & Reiersen, 2009; Takei et al., 
2014). Second, the SCDC is a well-validated measure that continues to show high-
heritability in adolescence, as would be expected of a true measure of ASTs (St Pourcain 
et al., 2015). Third, the SCDC has been shown to measure social communication 
difficulties independent of other types of psychopathology throughout childhood and 
adolescence (Mandy et al., 2013; Oliver et al., 2011; Robinson et al., 2011; Skuse et al., 
2009). In particular, using a cross-lagged model, Pickard and colleagues (2017) showed 
that in adolescence SCDC scores predict subsequent increases in anxiety symptoms; but 
that the reverse is not true. This contradicts the idea that the rise in SCDC scores of 
females we observed is merely an epiphenomenon driven by a rise in internalising 
problems (in this case, social anxiety). Nevertheless, future work is needed to elucidate 
the nature and causes of adolescent onset social communication difficulties, including 
the extent to which they are influenced by non-autistic factors (St Pourcain et al., 2017). 
This should include investigation of their infant and early childhood precursors, co-
occurring psychopathology, and early adult outcomes. 
 
Limitations 
The findings of this study should be considered in the light of the following limitations. 
First, our measure of ASTs is focused on the core social difficulties of autism, not those 
concerning inflexibility and atypical sensory processing. Therefore, it remains unclear 
whether the pattern of findings we report would also be observed for these ‘non-social’ 
elements of autism. Longitudinal investigations using trait measures such as the Social 
  
18 
Responsiveness Scale (Constantino & Todd, 2003), which span childhood and 
adolescence and measure the full array of autistic features, are needed.  Second, like all 
large birth cohort studies, ALSPAC has suffered attrition, with families of higher socio-
economic status (SES) more likely to participate, which could affect generalizability of 
findings.  Nevertheless, our findings were robust to missing data. Third, our analyses 
only extend to mid-adolescence. It will be important in future to chart AST trajectories 
for males and females during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Fourth, like 
most studies of AST in the general population of young people, our measure relied upon 
parent report. Whilst parent report is more sensitive than teacher report (Posserud, 
Lundervold & Gillberg, 2006) and direct observation (Lai et al., 2011) to autistic traits in 
females, it will nevertheless be valuable in future to triangulate our findings using 
different methods of assessment, especially self-report. Such work can help elucidate 
whether our finding of an increase in female ASTs could partially reflect changes in 
parental expectations. For example, it may be that parental expectations of their 
daughters’ social skills increase more substantially than of their sons’ during 
adolescence.  
 
Conclusions 
Our findings have the following clinical implications. First, they likely help explain the 
fact that autistic females receive their diagnosis later on average than autistic males, 
and are more likely to reach adulthood without appropriate understanding and support 
(Bargiela et al., 2016; Giarelli et al., 2010). They also fit with the observation that the 
male-to-female ratio is lower in adult and adolescent autism clinics (~2-to-1) compared 
to child ones (~6-to-1) (Rutherford et al., 2016). It is important that educational and 
clinical services are responsive to the fact that some autistic females may first present 
  
19 
in adolescence, after the age at which most autism cases are identified, without an 
extensive history of obvious childhood autistic difficulties. Second, the under-diagnosis 
of females with high ASTs, relative to high AST males, has sometimes been attributed to 
their having a greater capacity to compensate for their core autistic difficulties (e.g., 
Dworzynski et al., 2012; Mandy et al., 2012). Our findings contradict this idea, as they 
show that ASTs in females tend to get worse, not better, over time. This suggests the 
need to ensure that high AST females receive appropriate clinical diagnoses and 
associated support. 
 
The analyses presented emphasise the value of studying the ‘chronogeneity’ (i.e., 
longitudinal heterogeneity) of autistic symptoms (Georgiades, Bishop & Frazier, 2017). 
A next step will be to use growth mixture modelling to identify specific subgroups 
defined by AST trajectory, and to identify the clinical utility of these groups. This would 
extend our understanding of which children, and in particular which girls, are likely to 
require clinical and/or educational support due to having social communication 
difficulties.

Key points 
•
Autism is a dimensional condition, representing the extreme of a continuum 
of social competence that extends throughout the population: where an 
individual sits on this autism social trait (AST) continuum predicts their 
chances of adaptation and wellbeing. 
•
Despite their importance in developmental psychopathology, little is known 
about the developmental course of ASTs in the general population of children 
and adolescents.  
•
AST trajectories were different for males and females.  Aged 7 years, boys had, 
on average higher levels of ASTs than girls. By mid-adolescence, this gender 
difference had disappeared, due to a marked escalation of ASTs of females 
between 10 and 16 years.  
•
Of those with clinically-severe ASTs, 37% did not show these before 13 years. 
The majority (57%) of this adolescent-onset group were female. 
•
Clinical services and educational systems should be responsive to social 
communication difficulties that only become overt in adolescence, especially 
in females.
