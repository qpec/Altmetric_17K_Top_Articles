IMPORTANCE In the United States, national associations of individual dietary factors with
specific cardiometabolic diseases are not well established.
OBJECTIVE To estimate associations of intake of 10 specific dietary factors with mortality due
to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (cardiometabolic mortality) among US adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A comparative risk assessment model incorporated data
and corresponding uncertainty on population demographics and dietary habits from National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999-2002: n = 8104; 2009-2012: n = 8516);
estimated associations of diet and disease from meta-analyses of prospective studies and
clinical trials with validity analyses to assess potential bias; and estimated disease-specific
national mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics.
EXPOSURES Consumption of 10 foods/nutrients associated with cardiometabolic diseases:
fruits, vegetables, nuts/seeds, whole grains, unprocessed red meats, processed meats,
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), polyunsaturated fats, seafood omega-3 fats, and sodium.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated absolute and percentage mortality due to heart
disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes in 2012. Disease-specific and demographic-specific (age,
sex, race, and education) mortality and trends between 2002 and 2012 were also evaluated.
RESULTS In 2012, 702 308 cardiometabolic deaths occurred in US adults, including 506 100
from heart disease (371 266 coronary heart disease, 35 019 hypertensive heart disease, and
99 815 other cardiovascular disease), 128 294 from stroke (16 125 ischemic, 32 591
hemorrhagic, and 79 578 other), and 67 914 from type 2 diabetes. Of these, an estimated
318 656 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 306 064-329 755; 45.4%) cardiometabolic deaths
per year were associated with suboptimal intakes—48.6% (95% UI, 46.2%-50.9%) of
cardiometabolic deaths in men and 41.8% (95% UI, 39.3%-44.2%) in women; 64.2% (95%
UI, 60.6%-67.9%) at younger ages (25-34 years) and 35.7% (95% UI, 33.1%-38.1%) at older
ages (�75 years); 53.1% (95% UI, 51.6%-54.8%) among blacks, 50.0% (95% UI,
48.2%-51.8%) among Hispanics, and 42.8% (95% UI, 40.9%-44.5%) among whites; and
46.8% (95% UI, 44.9%-48.7%) among lower-, 45.7% (95% UI, 44.2%-47.4%) among
medium-, and 39.1% (95% UI, 37.2%-41.2%) among higher-educated individuals. The largest
numbers of estimated diet-related cardiometabolic deaths were related to high sodium
(66 508 deaths in 2012; 9.5% of all cardiometabolic deaths), low nuts/seeds (59 374; 8.5%),
high processed meats (57 766; 8.2%), low seafood omega-3 fats (54 626; 7.8%), low
vegetables (53 410; 7.6%), low fruits (52 547; 7.5%), and high SSBs (51 694; 7.4%). Between
2002 and 2012, population-adjusted US cardiometabolic deaths per year decreased by
26.5%. The greatest decline was associated with insufficient polyunsaturated fats (−20.8%
relative change [95% UI, −18.5% to −22.8%]), nuts/seeds (−18.0% [95% UI, −14.6% to
−21.0%]), and excess SSBs (−14.5% [95% UI, −12.0% to −16.9%]). The greatest increase was
associated with unprocessed red meats (+14.4% [95% UI, 9.1%-19.5%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dietary factors were estimated to be associated with a
substantial proportion of deaths from heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. These
results should help identify priorities, guide public health planning, and inform strategies to
alter dietary habits and improve health.

D
ietary habits influence many risk factors for cardio-
metabolic health, including heart disease, stroke, and
type 2 diabetes, which collectively pose substantial
health and economic burdens.1 In both global2,3 and national4
modeling studies, the associations of suboptimal diet with
overall health have been estimated. Understanding the rela-
tions of individual dietary components with cardiometabolic
disease at the population level is essential to identify priori-
ties, guide public health planning, and inform strategies to al-
ter these dietary habits and improve health. In addition, the
differences in these estimated health burdens by underlying
personal characteristics, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity,
and education, are relevant to consider more targeted ap-
proaches to reducing disparities.
For the United States, prior analyses have estimated the
associations of suboptimal dietary habits with cardiometa-
bolic health overall4 or for a limited number of dietary factors
(eg,sodium,sugar-sweetenedbeverages).5Theresultsforother
individual dietary components, as well as differences by age,
sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, are not well es-
tablished. The current investigation used a comparative risk
assessment modeling design2,6,7 to estimate the cardiometa-
bolic mortality related to suboptimal intakes of 10 dietary fac-
tors, individually and jointly, among US adults in 2012; to as-
sess diet-associated mortality by disease subtypes (heart
disease and subtypes, stroke and subtypes, and type 2 diabe-
tes) and population subgroups (age, sex, race, and educa-
tion); and to evaluate trends between 2002 and 2012.
Methods
Study Design
A comparative risk assessment model was used to estimate the
numbers and proportions of cardiometabolic deaths associ-
ated with suboptimal intakes of 10 dietary factors in the United
States, both individually and in combination (eAppendix 1 in
the Supplement). The model incorporated separately derived
data and corresponding uncertainty on (1) population demo-
graphics and dietary habits by sex, age, race, and education
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES); (2) the estimated relationships of 10 foods and nu-
trients with heart disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes mortal-
ity, by age, from meta-analyses of prospective cohorts and ran-
domized clinical trials, further evaluated by several validity
analyses; (3) the optimal population intake distributions of
thesedietaryfactorsbasedonobservedintakesassociatedwith
lowest risk in observational studies; and (4) observed US dis-
ease-specificcardiometabolicdeathsbysex,age,race,andedu-
cation from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
This modeling investigation was exempt from human sub-
jects review because it was based on published data and na-
tionally representative, deidentified data sets that included no
personally identifiable information.
Identification of Relevant Dietary Factors
The methods and results for review, identification, and as-
sessment of evidence for etiologic diet-disease relationships
have been described (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement).8,9
Using Bradford-Hill criteria and considering consistency with
other criteria for assessing potential causality of diet-disease
relationships,10-12 probable or convincing evidence was iden-
tified for associations of 17 dietary factors with coronary heart
disease (CHD), stroke, type 2 diabetes, body mass index (BMI),
or systolic blood pressure (SBP) (eTables 1-5 in the Supple-
ment). Of these, 10 were included in the present analysis
(Table 1), excluding others with major overlap for estimating
joint effects (eg, dietary fiber overlaps with whole grains, fish
overlaps with omega-3 fats). Several other dietary factors were
evaluated and not included because of insufficient evidence
for casual relationships, including monounsaturated fats,
vitamin D, magnesium, calcium, antioxidant vitamins, dairy
products, cocoa, coffee, and tea. Evidence for potential
associations of diet with other conditions such as cancer,
osteoporosis, gallstones, inflammatory diseases, depression,
cognitive function, or micronutrient deficiency diseases was
not evaluated.
National Distributions of Dietary Intake and Demographics
Dietary intakes were estimated using nationally representa-
tive data from multiple NHANES cycles, accounting for com-
plex survey design and sampling weights,16 to be representa-
tive of the US population aged 25 years or older (eTable 6 in
the Supplement). As previously described,17 intakes were
assessed from up to 2 standardized 24-hour dietary recalls
per person, accounting for within-person variation (eTables
7-10 in the Supplement).18 Optimal metrics and units for
each dietary factor were characterized to be consistent with
studies providing evidence on etiologic diet-disease rela-
tionships (Table 1; eTable 3 in the Supplement).8 All dietary
factors were adjusted for energy intake (using the residual
method18 or, for polyunsaturated fats, as percentage energy)
to reduce measurement error and account for potential dif-
ferences in body size, lean mass, metabolic efficiency, and
physical activity.
The means and standard deviations of intake of each di-
etary factor were estimated in population strata by age (25-
34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, or ≥75 years), sex (male or fe-
male),race/ethnicity(non-Hispanicwhite,non-Hispanicblack,
Key Points
Question What is the estimated mortality due to heart disease,
stroke, or type 2 diabetes (cardiometabolic deaths) associated
with suboptimal intakes of 10 dietary factors in the United States?
Findings In 2012, suboptimal intake of dietary factors was
associated with an estimated 318 656 cardiometabolic deaths,
representing 45.4% of cardiometabolic deaths. The highest
proportions of cardiometabolic deaths were estimated to be
related to excess sodium intake, insufficient intake of nuts/seeds,
high intake of processed meats, and low intake of seafood
omega-3 fats.
Meaning Suboptimal intake of specific foods and nutrients was
associated with a substantial proportion of deaths due to heart
disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes.

Mexican American/other Hispanic, or other race/mixed race),
and education (less than high school diploma, high school di-
ploma/equivalent or some college, or 4-year college degree or
greater). These demographic characteristics were classified in
NHANES based on self-report. Dietary factors were modeled
based on the mean and standard deviations using gamma
(rather than normal) distributions, allowing for and incorpo-
rating skewed distributions. To maximize power for sub-
groups, 2002 intakes were estimated by combining 1999-
2000 and 2001-2002 cycles (the earliest with nationally
representative24-hourrecalls;n = 8104;48.2%men)and2012
intakes by combining 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 cycles
(n = 8516; 47.6% men).
Estimated Diet-Disease Relationships
Methods for reviewing and synthesizing evidence to esti-
mate effect sizes (relative risks) for associations between di-
etary factors and cardiometabolic end points have been de-
scribed (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement).8,9 The present
analysis incorporated evidence from published or de novo
meta-analyses of prospective cohorts or randomized clinical
trialsevaluatingdirectassociationsofdietaryfactorswithCHD,
stroke,ortype2diabetesbyage(Table1;eTable2intheSupple-
ment). We included additional BMI-mediated associations of
sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) by age and overweight/
obesity status on deaths due to CHD, hypertensive heart dis-
ease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes and SBP-mediated associa-
tions of dietary sodium by age, race, and hypertensive status
on deaths due to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes
(eTable 5 in the Supplement).
These estimated effects can be used to model associa-
tions with cardiometabolic diseases if bias from confounding
(which might overestimate effects) or measurement error
(which might underestimate effects) is limited. To reduce
bias from confounding, all identified observational studies in
these meta-analyses used multivariable adjustment for other
risk factors. Measurement error was generally not addressed,
although some studies used serial measures of diet. In addi-
tion, associations of individual dietary factors with health
may be different from joint associations when consumed as
diet patterns; eg, healthful dietary factors such as fruits, veg-
etables, and whole grains tend to positively correlate in diets
while inversely correlating with unhealthful dietary factors
such as SSBs or processed meats. To determine the extent to
which the estimated multivariable-adjusted effect sizes
might be biased because of these limitations, 3 separate
validity analyses were performed comparing the estimated
effect sizes for individual dietary components to (1) observed
associations of overall dietary patterns with clinical end
points in long-term observational studies; (2) effects of
dietary patterns on cardiovascular risk factors (low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, SBP) in randomized clinical feeding
trials; and (3) effects of dietary patterns on hard end points in
a large randomized clinical trial (eAppendix 2 and eTable 4 in
the Supplement).9,19,20 Each of these validity analyses dem-
onstrated that estimated effect sizes for individual dietary
components were very similar to what would be expected
based on these other lines of evidence.
Characterization of Optimal Intakes
Optimal consumption levels for each dietary factor were
characterized (Table 1) based on observed levels associated
with lowest disease risk in meta-analyses of clinical end
points, while further considering feasibility (observed
national consumption levels in at least 2 to 3 countries
around the world) and consistency with major dietary guide-
lines (eTable 3 in the Supplement).8 The population distribu-
tion (ie, standard deviation) around each optimal population
mean was estimated from the optimal distributions of diet-
related metabolic risk factors in the Global Burden of Dis-
eases study (10% of the mean).2 For each dietary factor, the
modeling assumed no additional health benefits beyond the
optimal intake distribution within each sex, age, race, and
education stratum.
National Mortality, BMI, and SBP Distributions
by Sex, Age, Race, and Education
National disease-specific deaths in each stratum for 2002 and
2012 were obtained from the NCHS, which includes the en-
tire US population (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access
/vitalstatsonline.htm). Deaths were excluded for foreign
residents (individuals dying in the United States but whose
place of residence is outside the United States), ages 25 years
or younger, missing age information (2012: 0.005%; 2002:
0.006%), or, in education-stratified analyses, missing
education information (2012: 2.1%; 2002: 6.2%). Diet-related
cardiometabolic diseases were defined using International
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems, Tenth Revision, including heart disease (the sum of
CHD, hypertensive heart disease, and other cardiovascular
disease), stroke (the sum of ischemic, hemorrhagic, and other
stroke), and type 2 diabetes (Table 2; eTables 11-12 in the
Supplement). Events were characterized by age, sex, race
/ethnicity, and education as described above to match dietary
strata. For associations mediated by BMI (SSBs), including with
CHD, hypertensive heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes,
and by blood pressure (sodium), including with CHD,
hypertensive heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, and
stroke, the stratum-specific distributions (means and standard
deviations) of BMI (based on measured heights and weights)
and SBP (from certified examiners, using the mean of 3
measurements or 4 if necessary) in 2002 and 2012 were
estimatedfromthe1999-2002and2009-2012NHANEScycles,
respectively. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood
pressure of at least 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of at
least 90 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive drugs.23
Cardiometabolic Disease Burdens Attributable
to Key Dietary Targets
All data inputs were combined in a comparative risk assess-
ment model to estimate the absolute number and percent-
age of overall cardiometabolic deaths associated with sub-
optimal intake of each dietary factor. This framework21
incorporated each stratum-specific input and its uncertainty
(except for uncertainty in baseline number of deaths, not
reported by the NCHS) to estimate associated mortality
by age and sex; by age, sex, and race; and by age, sex, and

education. Stratification by all 4 demographic factors was
not performed because of low sample size and unstable
estimates in some strata. The main outcomes were the
estimated absolute number and percentage of cardiometa-
bolic mortality related to suboptimal intakes of 10 dietary
factors, individually and jointly, in 2012. We also evaluated
disease-specific and demographic-specific (age, sex,
race, and education) mortality and trends between 2002
and 2012.
For each stratum, the model calculated the percentage of
disease-specific mortality associated with each dietary factor
bycomparingthepresentdistributionofconsumptionwiththe
optimal distribution using the continuous population-
attributable fraction (PAF) formula (eAppendix 1 in the
Supplement).21 This PAF was multiplied by the actual num-
ber of disease-specific deaths in that stratum of the US popu-
lation to estimate the absolute number of disease-specific
deaths in that stratum related to the dietary factor. The joint
associations of all 10 dietary factors was estimated by propor-
tional multiplication of each stratum-specific PAF (eAppen-
dix 1). For comparing trends between 2002 and 2012, the es-
timated absolute (2012-2002) and relative (2012-2002/
2002×100) associated mortality rates in 2002 were age- and
sex-standardized to 2012 age-sex distributions.

a Based on the National Center for Health Statistics, International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision
(eTable 11 in the Supplement). Cardiometabolic diseases included heart
disease (the sum of CHD, hypertensive heart disease, and other CVD, including
rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, atrial fibrillation
and flutter, aortic aneurysm, peripheral vascular disease, endocarditis, and
other cardiovascular and circulatory diseases), stroke (including ischemic,
hemorrhagic, and other stroke [unclassified stroke or sequelae of stroke not
specified as hemorrhage or infarction]), and type 2 diabetes. Diabetes
deaths are those coded as proximally due to diabetes; diabetes is also
separately a risk factor for CVD deaths along with other risk factors such as
smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, physical
inactivity, etc.
bCalculated from a total of 702 308 total US cardiometabolic deaths in 2012.
Because each value represents central estimates from 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations (see Methods section of text and eAppendix 1 in the Supplement),
the subtype estimates may not sum perfectly to the total number. Deaths due
to hypertensive heart disease were estimated from relationships with blood
pressure (sodium) or body mass index (sugar-sweetened beverages) and
deaths due to other CVD from relationships with blood pressure (sodium)
(eTable 5 in the Supplement).
c Based on the joint (multiplicative) population attributable fraction21 for the
factors in this Table. For this, we used PUFAs replacing saturated fats rather
than carbohydrates to be more conservative when estimating joint associations
and excluded CHD estimates for processed meat because this relationships may
be mainly driven by sodium content,22 already separately included.
dFor findings for subtypes of other CVD deaths, see eTable 14 in the Supplement.
e Associated mortality was similar for insufficient PUFAs in place of saturated
fats alone: 14 382 CHD deaths (95% UI, 11 732-17 079), representing 3.9% of
CHD deaths (95% UI, 3.2%-4.6%) and 2.0% of total cardiometabolic disease
deaths (95% UI, 1.7%-2.4%). In sensitivity analyses, we also modeled mortality
associated with excess saturated fats (>10%) in place of PUFAs: 4244 CHD
deaths (95% UI, 3366-5278), representing 1.1% of CHD deaths (95% UI,
0.9%-1.4%) and 0.6% of total cardiometabolic disease deaths (95% UI,
0.5%-0.8%).
f Based on effects of sodium on systolic blood pressure in randomized trials,
including by age, race, and hypertension status (eAppendix 1 and eTable 5 in
the Supplement) and associations of blood pressure with heart disease and
stroke by age (eTable 5 in the Supplement).7,14

Uncertainty was quantified using multiway probabilistic
Monte Carlo simulations, jointly incorporating stratum-
specific uncertainties in dietary exposure distributions, diet-
disease relative risk estimates, and, for sodium, prevalence
of hypertension and proportion of non-Hispanic blacks. Cor-
responding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were derived
from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of 1000 estimated
models. Different outcomes were evaluated without adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons, so the UI bounds for each
finding should be interpreted in that context. These analyses
represent the estimated total cardiometabolic mortality
associated with each dietary factor, including any mediated
relationships through major cardiovascular risk factors (eg,
the estimated mortality from low fruit or vegetable con-
sumption would include any association mediated by their
effects on lowering of blood pressure and blood cholesterol).
Except for SSBs, additional potential relationships of dietary
habits with obesity were not considered, which could under-
estimate total diet-related cardiometabolic mortality. All
analyses were performed using R statistical software, ver-
sion 3.1.0.
Results
In both 2002 and 2012, national intakes of each dietary fac-
tor were suboptimal (Table 1; eTables 7-10 in the Supple-
ment). In 2012, a total of 702 308 cardiometabolic deaths
occurred in US adults, including 506 100 due to heart dis-
ease (including 371 266 due to CHD, 35 019 due to hyperten-
sive heart disease, and 99 815 due to other cardiovascular
disease), 128 294 from stroke (16 125 ischemic, 32 591 hemor-
rhagic, and 79 578 other), and 67 914 from type 2 diabetes
(eTable 11 in the Supplement).
Estimated Cardiometabolic Mortality Attributed to Diet
When all 10 dietary factors were evaluated in combination,
they were associated with 318 656 estimated cardiometa-
bolic deaths, or nearly 1 in 2 (45.4%) of all US cardiometa-
bolic deaths in 2012. Among individual factors, largest num-
bers of estimated diet-related cardiometabolic deaths were
related to high sodium (66 508 estimated cardiometabolic
deaths [9.5% of all cardiometabolic deaths]), low nuts/seeds
(59 374 [8.5%]), high processed meats (57 766 [8.2%]), low
seafood omega-3 fats (54 626 [7.8%]), low vegetables (53 410
[7.6%]), low fruits (52 547 [7.5%]), and high SSBs (51 694
[7.4%]) compared with optimal consumption levels
(Table 2; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Lowest estimated
mortality burdens were associated with low polyunsatu-
rated fats (16 025 [2.3%]) and high unprocessed red meats
(2869 [0.4%]).
Among cardiometabolic diseases, the largest numbers of
deathsduetoCHDwereassociatedwithlownuts/seeds(54 591
[14.7% of CHD deaths]), low seafood omega-3 fats (54 626
[14.7%]), high processed meats (45 637 [12.3%]), high SSBs
(39 937[10.8%]),andhighsodium(37 744[10.2%]);duetototal
stroke, to low vegetables (28 039 [21.9%]), low fruits (28 741
[22.4%]), and high sodium (13 787 [10.7%]); due to hyperten-
sive heart disease, to high sodium (7505 [21.4%]); and due to
type 2 diabetes, to high processed meats (11 900 [17.5%]), low
whole grains (11 639 [17.1%]), and high SSBs (10 043 [14.8%])
(Table 2).
Findings by Sex, Age, Race, and Education
Estimated cardiometabolic mortality associated with each di-
etary factor was modestly higher in men than in women, pri-
marily because of generally unhealthier dietary habits in men
(Figure 1; eFigure 5 and eTable 14 in the Supplement). The larg-
est sex differences were seen for processed meats (10.8% of
all cardiometabolic deaths in men and 5.4% in women; differ-
ence, +5.4%; 95% UI, 2.3%-8.3%) and SSBs (9.3% vs 5.3%; dif-
ference, +3.9%; 95% UI, 2.3%-5.4%). In men, the top 5 esti-
mated dietary factors associated with cardiometabolic deaths
were excess processed meats (38 632 deaths [10.8% of all car-
diometabolic deaths]), sodium (35 777 [10.0%]), SSBs (33 314
[9.3%]); and insufficient nuts/seeds (31 587 [8.8%]) and sea-
food omega-3 fats (31 545 [8.8%]). In women, these were ex-
cess sodium (30 281 [8.8%]) and insufficient nuts/seeds (27 721
[8.1%]), vegetables (25 592 [7.4%]), fruits (24 449 [7.1%]), and
omega-3 fats (23 032 [6.7%]). Jointly, suboptimal diet was re-
latedto48.6%ofestimatedcardiometabolicdeathsinmenand
41.8% in women in 2012 (absolute difference, +6.9%; 95% UI,
3.3%-10.1%) (Figure 2).
By age, in 25- to 64-year-olds, excess SSBs and processed
meats were the top estimated diet factors associated with car-
diometabolic mortality; in 65-year-olds and older, these were
excesssodiumandinsufficientnuts/seedsandvegetables(eFig-
ure 2, eFigure 5, and eTable 14 in the Supplement). Overall,
suboptimaldietwasassociatedwith64.2%ofallestimatedcar-
diometabolicdeathsin25-to34-year-oldsand35.7%in75-year-
olds and older (absolute difference, −28.6%; 95% UI, −32.9% to
−24.0%) (Figure 2). The highest estimated proportional deaths
at youngest ages (<44 years) were associated with SSBs fol-
lowed by processed meat, fruits, nuts/seeds, and vegetables; at
middle age (45-54 years), with SSBs, processed meat, nuts/
seeds, and seafood omega-3 fats; and at oldest age (≥65 years),
with sodium. For example, estimated proportions of SSB-
relateddeathsweremuchhigheratage25-34years(26.8%)and
35-44years(28.9%)thanatage≥75years(3.5%).Estimatedpro-
portions of deaths related to processed meat and nuts/seeds
were higher at age 45-54 years (16.8% and 15.7%, respectively)
than at age ≥75 years (4.9% and 6.8%).
By race/ethnicity, estimated proportional diet-related
mortality was higher among blacks or Hispanics for most
dietary factors assessed (Figure 2; eFigure 3, eFigure 5, eFig-
ure 6, and eTable 14 in the Supplement). For example, esti-
mated cardiometabolic mortality associated with SSBs was
nearly twice as high in blacks (12.6%; the leading factor) vs
whites (6.4%), and from low nuts/seeds, higher in Hispanics
(11.7%; the leading factor) vs whites (7.9%). One exception
was omega-3 fat–associated proportional mortality, which
was higher in whites (8.0%). Relative rankings of cardio-
metabolic mortality related to different dietary factors were
otherwise generally similar by race/ethnicity. Overall, subop-
timal diet was associated with 53.1% of total estimated
cardiometabolic deaths among blacks, 50.0% among

Hispanics, and 42.8% among whites (absolute differences,
+10.5% [95% UI, 8.0%-12.7%] for blacks vs whites and +7.2%
[95% UI, 4.8%-9.8%] for Hispanics vs whites).
Estimated proportional diet-related cardiometabolic mor-
tality was generally higher among individuals with low or me-
diumeducationcomparedwithhigheducation(Figure2;eFig-
ure 4, eFigure 5, eFigure 7, and eTable 14 in the Supplement).
This was most notable for nuts/seeds (in low vs high educa-
tion, 10.7% vs 6.2% of cardiometabolic deaths), SSBs (8.4% vs
4.5%), and fruits (8.5% vs 6.4%). Overall, suboptimal diet was
associated with 46.8% of cardiometabolic deaths for lower-,
45.7% for medium-, and 39.1% for higher-educated adults (ab-
solute differences, +7.7% [95% UI, 4.9%-10.4%] for low vs high
and +6.7% [95% UI, 4.1%-9.0%] for medium vs high).
Trends Between 2002 and 2012
Between 2002 and 2012, the total number of population-
adjusted US cardiometabolic deaths per year decreased by
26.5%. Improvements were seen in national intakes of some
factors, including polyunsaturated fats, nuts/seeds, SSBs,
whole grains, and fruits (eFigure 8 in the Supplement). Thus,
absolute numbers of diet-related cardiometabolic deaths
decreased for all dietary factors (eTable 13 in the Supple-
ment). As a percentage of annual cardiometabolic deaths,
which accounts for underlying trends in absolute death
rates, estimated diet-associated mortality declined for poly-
unsaturated fats (−20.8% smaller proportion of deaths; 95%
UI, −18.5% to −22.8%), nuts/seeds (−18.0%; 95% UI, −14.6%
to −21.0%), and SSBs (−14.5%; 95% UI, −12.0% to −16.9%);
remained relatively stable for whole grains, fruits, veg-
etables, seafood omega-3 fats, and processed meats; and
increased for sodium (+5.8%; 95% UI, 2.9%-8.8%) and
unprocessed red meats (+14.4%; 95% UI, 9.1%-19.5%)
(Figure 3). In 2002, excess SSB intake was the third leading
risk factor for diet-associated cardiometabolic death among
these 10 dietary factors, with an estimated 73 162 associated
deaths, or 8.6% of all cardiometabolic deaths (see eTables
5, 8, and 12 for 2002 inputs and eFigures 9-16 in the
Supplement for 2002 results overall and by population sub-
groups). In comparison, by 2012, SSBs had declined to the
seventh cause of diet-associated deaths.
Proportional trends in cardiometabolic mortality associ-
ated with dietary factors were generally similar by sex and
age (eFigures 5, 14, and 17 in the Supplement). Trends by
race were also consistent with overall results, with some
exceptions. For instance, the percentage of cardiometabolic
deaths associated with insufficient nuts/seeds declined in
whites (from 10.0% to 7.9%; −21.8% [95% UI, −35.8% to
−3.4%]) but not in blacks or Hispanics, while the percentage
of cardiometabolic deaths associated with insufficient whole
grains declined in Hispanics (from 12.9% to 7.6%; −41.2%
[95% UI, −49.8% to −28.8%]) but not in whites or blacks, yet
Hispanics started at higher levels and declined to more simi-
lar associated burdens by 2012. Trends in diet-associated
cardiometabolic deaths were also generally similar by educa-
tion, except that the percentage of cardiometabolic deaths

Discussion
Based on a comparative risk assessment model and nation-
ally representative data, an estimated 45.4% of all cardio-
metabolic deaths (n=318 656 due to heart disease, stroke,
and type 2 diabetes) were associated with suboptimal
intakes of 10 dietary factors in 2012. By sex, larger diet-
related proportional mortality was estimated in men than in
women, consistent with generally unhealthier dietary habits
in men. Suboptimal diet was also associated with larger pro-
portional mortality at younger vs older ages, among blacks
and Hispanics vs whites, and among individuals with low
and medium education vs high education.
Among individual dietary components, the largest esti-
mated mortality was associated with suboptimal sodium
(9.5%) followed by nuts/seeds, processed meats, seafood
omega-3 fats, vegetables, fruits, SSBs, and whole grains
(each between 5.9%-8.5%), and, last, polyunsaturated fats
(2.3%) and unprocessed red meats (0.4%). Estimated deaths
related to processed meats and SSBs were higher among men
than women. By age, SSBs were the leading estimated factor
associated with cardiometabolic mortality between ages 25
and 64 years and sodium at age 65 years or older. Disparities
were evident by race, especially for excess SSBs among
blacks and insufficient nuts/seeds among Hispanics, and by
education, especially for low nuts/seeds and fruits and
excess SSBs among less-educated adults. Income-related
disparities in current levels and trends over time of national
consumption of nuts/seeds, fruits, and SSBs have been
reported,17 which likely contribute to the disparities in diet-
associated mortality by race and education identified in the
present investigation.
Between2002and2012,severalimprovementswereiden-
tified. Even accounting for underlying declines in total cardio-
metabolic mortality, fewer diet-associated proportional deaths

Nationally, estimated cardiometabolic deaths related to
insufficient healthier foods/nutrients remained at least as
substantial as those related to excess unhealthful foods/
nutrients. These results inform strategies for prevention to re-
duce the health and economic burdens of cardiometabolic dis-
eases in the United States. For example, positive messaging to
patients, the public, and industry can emphasize maximizing
the good (rather than simply reducing the harmful) food
choices and products. Within the health system, changes to
clinician education, multidisciplinary care teams, electronic
health records, quality guidelines, and reimbursement stan-
dards can each facilitate lifestyle counseling and behavior
change.1,23 At local or national levels, strategies with evi-
dence for effectiveness include multicomponent school and
workplace programs focused on healthier eating, economic in-
centives (eg, subsidies) for more healthful foods or taxation of
less healthful foods, incentivized or mandated product refor-
mulation(eg,toreduceadditivessuchassodiumandtransfats),
and restrictions on advertising of unhealthy foods to
children.24,25 For example, the US Food and Drug Administra-
tion recently announced voluntary sodium reduction targets
for the food industry,26 while in the 2016 elections, SSB taxes
were passed in all 4 cities with this measure on the ballot.27
Compared with education alone, such “upstream” strategies
could also reduce disparities. For example, disparities in diet-
related cardiometabolic deaths identified in our investiga-
tion might be partly addressed by the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program (SNAP), which serves 44 million
low-income individuals in the United States; for example, by
expanding the SNAP Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive
program28toprovidewiderincentivesforpurchasingfruitsand
vegetables as well as nuts/seeds and adding restrictions or dis-
incentives for unhealthier products such as SSBs, processed

meats, and high-sodium foods.29,30 Gaps in knowledge re-
main regarding cost-effectiveness, equity assurance, and po-
litical feasibility of dietary policies in different settings and
within different subgroups; our results highlight the need for
government and other stakeholders to prioritize implemen-
tation and evaluation of such strategies.
Among unhealthful foods/nutrients, the present find-
ings suggest that sodium is a key target. Population-wide salt
reduction policies that include a strong government role to
educate the public and engage industry to gradually reduce
salt content in processed foods (for example, as imple-
mented in the United Kingdom and Turkey) appear to be
effective, equitable, and highly cost-effective or even
cost-saving.31,32 Such population approaches can also mini-
mize challenges of public taste preferences, placing all com-
panies on a level playing field and allowing the population’
s
taste receptors for salt to gradually upregulate, preventing
any major perception of changes in taste.33 Functional ben-
efits of salt in foods, such as for texture or food safety, must
also be further addressed by advances in food processing.33
The decline in SSB-associated proportional mortality be-
tween 2002 and 2012 is promising. The current results suggest

Thisstudyextendsandisconsistentwithanumberofprior
USanalysesofdiet-relatedcardiometabolicmortalityhavebeen
performed. In an analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases
Study, 26% of US deaths from all causes in 2010 were esti-
mated to be related to joint suboptimal intakes of 14 dietary
factors4; with approximately 40% of these deaths due to car-
diometabolic diseases.4 In earlier analysis5 evaluating 5 di-
etary factors in 2005, excess sodium was estimated to be as-
sociated with 102 000 cardiovascular deaths, followed by low
omega-3 fats (84 000 deaths), high trans fats (82 000 deaths),
low fruits and vegetables (58 000 deaths), and low polyun-
saturated fats (15 000 deaths). In global analyses of mortality
related to excess sodium7 and SSBs15 in 2010, about 58 000 US
cardiovascular deaths were estimated to be associated with so-
dium and 24 000 US cardiometabolic deaths with SSBs. The
present investigation builds on and expands these prior re-
ports by using direct national data on dietary intakes and mor-
tality from NHANES and the NCHS rather than values im-
puted from these sources plus other global data4,5,7,15; gamma
distributions for dietary factors, particularly relevant for
skewed intakes such as for SSBs, nuts/seeds, and processed
meats; and updated estimates of relative risks of dietary fac-
tors on disease risk.
Our investigation has several strengths. The modeling
study design incorporated separately derived measures of de-
mographics, dietary habits, optimal dietary intakes, disease
rates, and estimated diet-disease relationships. This ap-
proach, which derived and estimated cardiometabolic mor-
tality associated with dietary intakes based on external evi-
dence, should be differentiated from an ecologic study design,
which would assess cross-sectional correlations within a na-
tional data set. Relative risks were based on multivariable-
adjusted meta-analyses of different dietary factors and car-
diometabolic end points, with supportive validity analyses
from both long-term cohorts and randomized clinical trials of
dietary patterns. The modeling framework incorporated stra-
tum-specific data, including by sex, age, race, and education,
wherever relevant and available, increasing validity of our es-
timates and ability to evaluate disparities. Uncertainty was in-
corporated and quantified in the model inputs using probabi-
listic sensitivity analyses, allowing estimation of the bounds
of plausible effects. Nationally representative data sets on di-
etary habits, cardiovascular risk factors, and death rates pro-
vide generalizability to the US adult population.
Potential limitations should be considered. Although ev-
ery effort was made to maximize validity, minimize bias, and
incorporate heterogeneity and uncertainty, the study’
s com-
parative risk assessment model does not prove that changes
in these dietary habits reduce disease risk. Causality is differ-
ent from identifying associations. Estimated relative risks of
individual dietary components could be limited by measure-
ment error (typically causing underestimation of effects) and
residual confounding (typically causing overestimation of ef-
fects). For any person, the contribution to health of each di-
etary component may be modified by other factors such as
other dietary habits as well as age, sex, activity, adiposity, and
genetics. Thus, as with any medical or public health interven-
tion, our findings should be considered as estimates of the av-
erage population relationships. Dietary habits are intercorre-
lated, increasing complexity of estimating associations. Yet
separate validity analyses of dietary pattern studies, includ-
ing from interventional studies, suggested that the estimated
relative risks for both individual components and their joint
associations were reasonable. We limited our investigation to
dietaryfactorswiththestrongestevidence,notincludingmany
other dietary factors that may influence cardiometabolic
health, and except for SSBs did not incorporate additional po-
tential effects of these dietary factors on obesity, which could
underestimate the full health associations of poor diet.
Dietary habits were based on self-reported 24-hour re-
calls, which have known measurement errors for individual
people; and sodium intake is best assessed by multiple 24-
hour urine collections, not available in NHANES. Yet our analy-
sis used stratum-specific mean intakes, which are measured
reasonably well by 24-hour recalls; potential measurement er-
ror was further reduced by energy adjustment and distribu-
tions were corrected for within-person variation. Optimal in-
take levels for each dietary factor are not conclusively
established and could be modestly lower or higher. If ben-
efits continue beyond our optimal levels, the reported asso-
ciated mortality may be underestimated. National cause-
of-death data are prone to error; these findings should be
considered the best available national data rather than per-
fect clinical determination of mortality burdens. National

Center for Health Statistics data do not differentiate by type
of diabetes, so our estimates may include a small number of
deaths due to type 1 diabetes. Like most disease models, com-
parative risk assessment may underestimate mortality for risk
factors with prolonged lag effects. For example, SSB intake is
much higher in children and young adults, in whom measur-
ablemortalitywouldbelowcomparedwitholderadults.There-
fore, the full lifetime disease associations of suboptimal di-
etary habits at younger ages may be underestimated. Model
estimates do not make assumptions about feasibility of inter-
ventions to improve diet, which must consider cost, produc-
tion, distribution, cultural preferences, disparities, potential
industry cooperation or opposition, and political feasibility.37
Thus, these findings should be considered estimates of na-
tional cardiometabolic mortality related to suboptimal in-
takes of these 10 dietary factors, and potential effects of spe-
cific interventions should be evaluated in future studies.
Conclusions
Dietary factors were estimated to be associated with a sub-
stantial proportion of deaths from heart disease, stroke, and
type 2 diabetes. These results should help identify priorities,
guide public health planning, and inform strategies to alter di-
etary habits and improve health.
