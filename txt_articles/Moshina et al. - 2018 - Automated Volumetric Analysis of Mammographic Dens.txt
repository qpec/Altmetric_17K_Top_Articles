ORIGINAL RESEARCH • BREAST IMAGING
S
tratified breast cancer screening among women with aver-
age risk is now a recommended practice in the United 
States, with some suggesting tailored regimens based on 
breast density (1,2). Women with mammographically dense 
breasts have a higher risk of breast cancer and a higher risk of 
missed cancers than do those with nondense breasts (3–5). 
The sensitivity of mammography is reported to be as low as 
60% for women with extremely dense breasts (5–7). The 
higher risk of breast cancer among women with dense breasts 
is etiologically related to biologic mechanisms (8), whereas 
the superimposition of breast tissue leads to a masking effect 
whereby breast cancers can go undetected (9). Breast can-
cers are detected in dense breasts at a later stage and have 
less favorable tumor characteristics than do those detected 
in nondense breasts (7,10,11). Population-based mammo-
graphic screening may therefore be less effective for women 
with dense breasts than for those with nondense breasts.
The majority of studies about mammographic den-
sity have focused on the association between subjective 
density assessments and breast cancer risk (3–5). Only a 
few studies have used objective density measures for risk 
estimation, and even fewer studies have evaluated quanti-
tative breast density measurement with regard to screening 
performance (7,11,12). The most commonly used method 
for classification of mammographic density is the radiolo-
gist’s subjective interpretation using the American College 
of Radiology’s Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 
(BI-RADS) (13). However, no reference standard exists for 
breast density determination. To eliminate inter- and in-
trareader variability regarding density categorization, auto-
mated software has been developed to provide quantitative 
density assessments in real time (12,14).
In some places, supplemental screening with US and 
MRI and/or more frequent screening are options for women 
with dense breasts (4,15,16). In the United States, more than 
half of the states have enacted breast density legislation (17). 
In some places, this legislation mandates that women should 
be informed about their breast density or that additional

Purpose: To describe screening outcomes from BreastScreen Norway stratified by volumetric breast density (VBD).
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included data from 107 949 women aged 50–69 years (mean age 6 standard deviation, 
58.7 years 6 5.6) who underwent 307 015 screening examinations from 2007 to 2015. Automated software classified mammographic 
density as nondense (VBD ,7.5%) or dense (VBD 7.5%). Rates and distributions of screening outcomes (recall, biopsy, screen-
detected and interval breast cancer, positive predictive values of recall and of needle biopsy, sensitivity, specificity, and histopathologic 
tumor characteristics) were analyzed and stratified by density. Tests of proportions, including propensity score and t tests, were used.
Results: In 28% (87 021 of 307 015) of the screening examinations, the breasts were classified as dense. Recall rates for women 
with nondense versus dense breasts were 2.7% (5882 of 219 994) and 3.6% (3101 of 87 021); biopsy rates were 1.1% (2359 of 
219 994) and 1.4% (1209 of 87 021); rates of screen-detected cancer were 5.5 (1210 of 219 994) and 6.7 (581 of 87 021) per 1000 
examinations; and rates of interval breast cancer were 1.2 (199 of 165 324) and 2.8 (185 of 66 674) per 1000 examinations, respec-
tively (P , .001 for all). Sensitivity was 82% (884 of 1083) for nondense breasts and 71% (449 of 634) for dense breasts, whereas 
specificity was 98% (160 973 of 164 440) and 97% (64 250 of 66 225), respectively (P , .001 for both). For screen-detected can-
cers, mean tumor diameter was 15.1 mm and 16.6 mm (P = .01), and lymph node–positive disease was found in 18% (170 of 936) 
and 24% (98 of 417) (P = .02) of women with nondense and dense breasts, respectively.
Conclusion: Screening examinations of women with dense breasts classified by using automated software resulted in higher recall 
rate, lower sensitivity, larger tumor diameter, and more lymph node–positive disease compared with women with nondense breasts.

imaging could be beneficial. However, supplemental screening for 
women with dense breasts is not currently recommended by any 
major societies or organizations (1,18).
Our study objective was to describe population-based screen-
ing performance and outcomes stratified by volumetric mam-
mographic density. Specifically, we aimed to determine the rates 
of recall and biopsy, rates of cancer detection, positive predictive 
values, sensitivity, specificity, histopathologic tumor character-
istics, odds of breast cancer, and predicted numbers of breast 
cancer cases based on volumetric breast density (VBD) catego-
ries. Our findings will help inform how automated volumetric 
density categorization will change population-based screening 
performance and outcomes under a more objective paradigm for 
breast density measurement. We hypothesized that screening ex-
aminations of women with high VBD were associated with less 
favorable screening outcomes compared with those of women 
with low breast density.
Materials and Methods
Our study was approved by the data protection official for re-
search at Oslo University Hospital (Oslo, Norway) and the re-
gional committee for medical and health research ethics. Neither 
the authors nor the study received any funding or support from 
industry.
Data for this retrospective study were extracted from databases 
at the Cancer Registry of Norway and deidentified prior to analy-
ses. It has been mandatory to report information about neoplasms 
to the Cancer Registry of Norway since 1952 (19). Breast cancer 
completeness has been estimated to be close to 100%, and 99% 
of the cases are morphologically verified. According to the Can-
cer Registry Regulations, information about screening examina-
tions performed in BreastScreen Norway—the national screening 
program for breast cancer—can be used for quality assurance and

Summary
By using automated volumetric mammographic density assessment 
software, the authors identified higher recall and biopsy rates and 
higher odds of screen-detected and interval breast cancer for screening 
examinations of women with volumetrically dense versus nondense 
breasts.
Implications for Patient Care
 
n Automated volumetric breast density measurements may be con-
sidered a future standard for breast cancer screening, ensuring an 
objective density classification.
 
n By using automated volumetric breast density assessment software, 
screening examinations of women with dense breasts are associated 
with higher rates of recall and biopsy, and higher odds of screen-
ing-detected and interval breast cancers than are examinations of 
women with nondense breasts.
 
n By using automated volumetric breast density software, less than 
one in three women in a population-based screening program will 
be classified as having dense breasts.
research if the women have not actively opted out. About 2% of 
women attending the program have refused such data usage (20). 
The Cancer Registry of Norway coordinates BreastScreen Nor-
way, which started in 1996 and offers biennial mammography to 
approximately 600 000 women aged 50–69 years (20). A unique 
11-digit personal identification number assigned to all residents 
of Norway ensures 100% completeness of the invitations to the 
program. Attendance rate for each round of screening is approxi-
mately 75% and about 85% of all the invited women have at-
tended the program at least once.
The program provides independent double reading per-
formed by two breast radiologists; the readers are totally 
blinded to the interpretation scores of one another. Each breast 
is assigned a score of 1–5 by each radiologist to indicate mam-
mographic findings (1, negative for malignancy; 2, probably 
benign; 3, intermediate suspicion of malignancy; 4, probably 
malignant; 5, high suspicion of malignancy). If either radiolo-
gist assigns a score of 2 or higher, then a consensus or arbitra-
tion meeting is held to determine whether to call the woman 
back for further assessment (recall). The recall rate in the pro-
gram is about 3% (21). All radiologists are required to undergo 
training to start and continue screen reading (21). The expe-
riences in screen reading for the radiologists included in this 
study varied from first-year faculty to those with more than 20 
years of experience.
Study Sample
Data from women screened in Rogaland and Hordaland coun-
ties as a part of BreastScreen Norway during the study period 
of January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2015 (n = 109 821 women 
and 329 179 screening examinations) constituted the study 
population (Fig 1).
We excluded information about 20 672 women and 22 164 
screening examinations (6.8% [22 164 of 329 179] of the screen-
ing examinations) without information about VBD. Our final 
study population consisted of 107 949 women aged 50–69 
years, with mean age at time of screening of 58.3 years 6 5.7 
(standard deviation). The women underwent an average of 2.8 
screening examinations during the study period, accounting for 
307 015 examinations in total. Results of sensitivity analyses on 
screening outcome for women with and without density data 
did not differ significantly, except for positive predictive value of 
biopsies (Table E1 [online]).
Analyses pertaining to interval breast cancers, sensitivity, and 
specificity included information from women who underwent 
screening and had follow-up data for 2 years (96 052 women 
who underwent 231 998 examinations) to ensure sufficient fol-
low-up time for detection of interval cancer (24 months).
Equipment Used and Assessment of VBD
All examinations were performed with full-field digital mam-
mography (Senographe DS or Senographe Essential; GE Med-
ical Systems SCS, Buc, France). Continuous measures of fibro-
glandular volume (absolute density), breast volume, and VBD 
(percent density) were obtained from raw data by using an auto-
mated software (Volpara, version 1.5.1; Volpara Solutions, Wel-
lington, New Zealand) (22). The density values represented the

average value for a screening examination, which 
typically consisted of four images (craniocaudal and 
mediolateral oblique views of each breast).
This software used the maximum VBD value per 
examination to classify density into a four-category 
scale, or Volpara density grade (VDG). Examina-
tions with VBD less than or equal to 4.5% were clas-
sified as VDG1, those with 4.5%–7.49% as VDG2, 
those with 7.5%–15.49% as VDG3, and those with 
greater than or equal to 15.5% as VDG4 (Figure 2). 
These volumetric density categories are considered 
analogous to the BI-RADS density categories (13). 
The correlation between radiologists’ BI-RADS den-
sity scores and automated density assessment was 
previously reported to be moderate (12). We pres-
ent results based on a binary classification of VDG 
as follows: VDG1 or VDG2 (VBD ,7.5%) versus 
VDG3 or VDG4 (VBD 7.5%), hereafter referred 
to as nondense and dense, respectively. Results for 
the four VDG categories are provided in Figure E1 
(online).
Variables of Interest
Screening history was based on women’s personal screening history, 
recorded by the Cancer Registry of Norway. Prevalent examina-
tion was defined as the women’s first examination in BreastScreen 
Norway, regular subsequent examination as those less than 752 
days since last examination, and irregular subsequent examination 
as those greater than or equal to 752 days since last examination.
Individual breast cancer risk factors were captured by 
using a questionnaire sent with screening invitations (23). 
Information from 62% (66 817 of 107 949) of the women 
in the study population was available. Weight, height, 
use of hormonal therapy, number of pregnancies lasting 
greater than 6 months, and first- or second-degree fam-
ily history of breast cancer were risk factors included in 
our analysis. Body mass index was calculated as weight di-
vided by squared height and we defined less than 20.0 kg/
m2 as underweight, 20.0–24.9 kg/m2 as healthy weight, 
25.0–29.9 kg/m2 as overweight, and greater than or equal to 
 
30 kg/m2 as obese. Use of hormonal therapy was categorized 
as never user, past user, current user of estrogen alone (eg, 
estradiol and estriol), current user of combined estrogen-pro-
gestin (estradiol and norethisterone acetate), or unspecified 
(current user of unspecified hormonal therapy or incomplete 
information on past use). The number of pregnancies lasting 
greater than 6 months was categorized as none, one to two, 
or at least three, and a positive family history was defined as 
a mother, sister, daughter, or grandmother diagnosed with 
breast cancer at any age.
Recall rate was defined as the percentage of screening exami-
nations resulting in a call back for further assessment because of 
abnormal mammographic findings, whereas the biopsy rate was 
related to screening examinations resulting in a needle biopsy. A 
screen-detected breast cancer was defined as breast cancer (ductal 
carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer) diagnosed after a recall. 
An interval breast cancer was defined as a breast cancer diagnosed

within 24 months of a negative screening examination or within 
6–24 months of a false-positive screening result. Detection rates 
for screen-detected and interval breast cancer were presented per 
1000 screening examinations. Positive predictive value was defined 
as the percentage of screen-detected breast cancers among recalls 
(hereafter, PPV-1) and as the percentage of screen-detected breast 
cancers among recalls leading to needle biopsy (hereafter, PPV-3). 
Sensitivity was defined as the percentage of screen-detected breast 
cancers among screen-detected and interval breast cancers. Speci-
ficity was defined as the percentage of true-negative screening ex-
aminations among false-positive and true-negative examinations.
Data about tumor characteristics included histopathologic 
type, tumor diameter (in millimeters), histologic grade, and 
lymph node involvement, as well as hormonal receptor (estrogen, 
estrogen receptor [ER], and progesterone, progesterone receptor 
[PR]) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
status, which were used to determine immunohistochemical 
subtype classifications: luminal A–like (ER positive, PR positive, 
and HER2 negative), luminal B–like HER2 negative (ER posi-
tive, PR negative, and HER2 negative), luminal B–like HER2 
positive (ER positive, PR positive, and HER2 positive), HER2 
positive (ER negative, PR positive, and HER2 positive), and triple 
negative (ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 negative) (24).
Statistical Analyses
Our analysis was performed at the examination level. Distribu-
tions of the variables of interest were stratified by automated volu-
metric density (nondense vs dense breasts) and mode of detection 
(screen-detected or interval breast cancer). We tested for statisti-
cally significant differences between groups by using t tests and 
tests of proportions. We also performed a propensity score analysis 
to account for differences between the dense and nondense group.
The propensity score weights were estimated by fitting a lo-
gistic regression model on density, adjusted for age at screening, 
screening location, screening history, number of pregnancies, 
body mass index, use of hormonal therapy, number of pregnancies

The odds ratios of screen-detected and interval breast 
cancers associated with volumetric density were estimated 
by using generalized estimating equations with a logit link 
function and robust standard errors to account for within-
woman correlation. Models were adjusted for age at screen-
ing, screening location, and screening history.
The number of cases of screen-detected and interval breast 
cancer per 1000 screening examinations were predicted and 
graphed by using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing 
to show the association between density and breast cancer, 
stratified by 5-year age groups. These predicted numbers were 
derived from generalized estimating equations models with 
lasting greater than 6 months, and first- or second-degree fam-
ily history of breast cancer. Women with missing information on 
questionnaire data were included with mean values of the missing 
estimates, identified with a dummy variable. The inverse probabil-
ity weight for individual i were defined as follows:

density represented by cubic splines with six knots. Covari-
ates in these models were the same as described above.
Because of multiple testing, we performed the Bonferroni 
correction, such that the adjusted P value , .0008 was consid-
ered to indicate statistical significance. Analyses were performed 
by using Stata (version 14.2; Stata, College Station, Tex). Data 
analyses and interpretation were performed by N.M. (with 4 
years of expertise), S.S. (with 7 years of expertise), K.M.T. (with 
6 years of expertise), and S.H. (with 20 years of expertise).
Results
Among the 307 015 screening examinations performed dur-
ing 2007–2015, 14% were prevalent, 82% were regular subse-
quent, and 4% were irregular subsequent examinations. VBD 
measurements ranged from 1% to 52%; 72% (219 994 of 
307 015) of examinations were classified as nondense and 28% 
(87 021 of 307 015) as dense (Table 1, Fig 1).
The recall rate was 2.7% (5882 of 219 994) for screening ex-
aminations of women with nondense breasts and 3.6% (3101 
of 87 021) for those with dense breasts (P , .0001) (Table 1). 
 
The rate of needle biopsy resulting from abnormal screening was 
1.1% (2359 of 219 994) for screening examinations of those with 
nondense and 1.4% (1209 of 87 021) for those with dense breasts 
(P , .0001). A lower rate of breast cancer was observed for non-
dense versus dense breasts: 5.5 (1210 of 219 994) versus 6.7 per 
1000 examinations (581 of 87 021) for screen-detected breast can-
cer, and 1.2 (199 of 165 324) versus 2.8 (185 of 66 674) per 1000 
examinations for interval breast cancer, respectively (P , .001 for 
both). Sensitivity was 82% (884 of 1083) versus 71% (449 of 
634) and specificity was 98% (160 973 of 164 440) versus 97% 
(64 250 of 66 225) for screening examinations of women with 
nondense and dense breasts, respectively (P , .0001 for both). 
Results of crude and propensity-weighted analyses did not differ 
for nondense versus dense breasts, except for the percentage of 
screen-detected breast cancers among recalls (PPV-1) and for the 
percentage of screen-detected breast cancers among recalls leading 
to needle biopsy (PPV-3) (Table E2 [online]).
Among women with screen-detected breast cancer, a lower 
proportion of ductal carcinoma in situ was found for those with 
nondense (20%, 237 of 1210) versus those with dense breasts

rate (2.2%, 2541 of 116 037), biopsy rate (0.9%, 1048 of 
116 037), rate of screen-detected cancer (0.46%, 529 of 
116 037), and rate of interval breast cancer (0.07%, 60 of 
84 991) compared with those with the densest breasts (or 
VDG4) (recall rate, 3.6% [512 of 14 225]; biopsy rate, 1.6% 
[228 of 14 225]; rate of screen-detected cancer, 0.68% [96 
of 14 225]; and rate of interval breast cancer, 0.31% [34 of 
11 045]) (Table E5 [online]). The proportion of women clas-
sified as VDG4 was 5% (11 045 of 231 998) and tumors de-
tected among these women contributed to 5.4% (96 of 1791) 
of the total number of the screen-detected cancers and 8.9% 
(34 of 384) of the interval breast cancers. Tumor characteris-
tics were less favorable for women with VDG4 than for those 
classified as VDG1 (Tables E6 and E7 [online]).
Age, body mass index, use of hormonal therapy, number 
of pregnancies, and family history were significantly asso-
ciated with volumetric density categories (Table 4). Nota-
bly, the average body mass index was higher for screening 
examinations of women with breasts classified as nondense 
compared with those classified as dense (27 kg/m2 vs 23 kg/
m2; P , .0001).
(26%, 152 of 581; P = .002) (Table 2). A smaller mean tumor 
diameter and proportion of lymph node–positive tumors was 
found among those with nondense versus dense breasts (tumor 
diameter, 15.1 mm vs 16.6 mm; P = .009 and lymph node in-
volvement, 18% [170 of 936] vs 24% [98 of 417]; P = .023). 
The proportion of luminal B–like HER2-positive tumors was 
7% (59 of 913) for women with nondense and 11% (43 of 397) 
for women with dense breasts (P = .007).
Histopathologic tumor characteristics of interval breast cancer 
did not differ significantly for women with nondense versus dense 
breasts with regard to mean tumor diameter (25.3 mm vs 24.1 
mm; P = .46), lymph node involvement (41% [72 of 178] vs 44% 
[72 of 165]; P = .55), and triple negative status (17% [29 of 173] 
vs 15% [26 of 171]; P = .69) (Table 3). Results of propensity-
weighted analyses are shown in Tables E3 and E4 (online).
Additional results pertaining to screening performance 
measures and tumor characteristics for screen-detected and 
interval breast cancers stratified by four-group volumetric 
density categorization are available in Appendix E1 (on-
line). Notably, screening examinations of women with fatty 
breasts (or VDG1) had a statistically significantly lower recall

Figure 2: Mammograms show volumetric breast density classified as Volpara density grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 (,4.5%, 4.5%–
7.49%, 7.5%–15.49%, and 15.5%, respectively) with automated volumetric breast density measurement.
The adjusted odds of a screen-detected breast cancer were 
1.37 times higher (95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.59) for 
screening examinations of women with dense versus nondense 
breasts (Table 5). Compared with women with nondense 
breasts, women with dense breasts had 2.93 times higher (95% 
confidence interval: 2.16, 3.97) odds of an interval breast cancer.
By using a continuous volumetric density measure, the 
predicted number of screen-detected breast cancers per 1000 
screening examinations increased monotonically with increas-
ing breast density and was highest for women aged at least 
 
65 years (Fig 3). Women with very low breast density (VBD 
,4%) had the lowest predicted number of cases of screen-
detected breast cancer (less than five per 1000 screening ex-
aminations). Screening examinations of women aged at least 
65 years with very high breast density (about 30% or higher) 
had the highest predicted number of screen-detected breast 
cancers (approximately 13 per 1000 screening examinations). 
The predicted numbers of interval breast cancers were approx-
imately one per 1000 screening examinations for those with 
VBD less than 4%, increasing to four per 1000 screening ex-
aminations for those with breast density greater than or equal 
to 10%, irrespective of age.

The higher recall and biopsy rates for screening exami-
nations of women with dense versus nondense breasts were 
expected (7,25) and likely related to challenges in interpreta-
tion (4). However, the highest recall rate in our study was 
substantially lower than recall rates in the United States, 
which are usually reported to be about 10% (26). The lower 
recall rates in Europe, including Norway, are likely related 
to independent double reading of mammograms with con-
sensus for equivocal cases. It should be mentioned that a 
relatively small difference in biopsy rates for examinations 
with dense (1.4%) versus nondense (1.1%) breasts is clini-
cally relevant for a screening program that covers about 85% 
Discussion
By using automated volumetric mammographic density as-
sessment software, we identified higher rates of recall and bi-
opsy and higher odds of screen-detected and interval breast 
cancer for screening examinations of women with volumet-
rically dense versus nondense breasts. Overall, 28% of the 
screening examinations in our study population were classi-
fied as volumetrically dense (VDG3 or VDG4), whereas 5% 
were categorized as very dense (VDG4). Tumor diameter and 
lymph node involvement of screen-detected cancers were less 
favorable for women with volumetrically dense versus non-
dense breasts.

of the 600 000 women in the target popula-
tion. The lower sensitivity of mammography 
screening among women with dense breasts 
indicates that mammographic screening is less 
effective for these women. This is because of 
a higher rate of interval breast cancers with 
less favorable tumor characteristics compared 
with screen-detected breast cancers. Our re-
sults support findings from studies based on 
subjectively assessed mammographic density 
and associated screening outcomes (25,27). A 
recent study from the Netherlands, using the 
same software for density assessment that we 
used, showed comparable results to our study 
among women with very high (VDG4) versus 
very low density (VDG1) (7).
Our findings of larger tumor diameter and a 
higher proportion of lymph node–positive tu-
mors for screen-detected breast cancers among 
women with dense breasts are in line with other 
studies (11,28). The higher aggressiveness of tu-
mors among women with dense breasts might 
indicate a combination of biologic characteristics 
and masking effect. The differences observed be-
tween women with nondense and dense breasts 
did not reach statistical significance for interval breast cancers, 
possibly because of the relatively small number of examinations 
categorized as dense. We assume the lower proportion of ductal 
carcinoma in situ for nondense versus dense breasts to be also re-
lated to biologic differences. However, further studies exploring 
mammographic features of ductal carcinoma in situ are needed to 
understand this finding.
Our results of higher odds of both screen-detected and inter-
val breast cancers for women with dense versus nondense breasts 
(1.37 and 2.93, respectively) are in line with results from other 
studies (7,29–31). However, the predicted number of screen- 
detected and interval breast cancers per 1000 screening examina-
tions were at most five for examinations with nondense breasts 
and were 13 for those with dense breasts. Thus, although the 
odds of breast cancer were higher for those with dense versus 
nondense breasts, the absolute risk of breast cancer was low. 
The predicted number would be substantially lower for VDG4, 
which corresponds to only 5% of the screening examinations.
The distribution of BI-RADS density into categories (al-
most entirely fatty, scattered fibroglandular densities, het-
erogeneously dense, and extremely dense) is reported to be 
approximately 10%, 40%, 40%, and 10%, respectively, for 
U.S. women in all ages (13). Correspondingly, the distribu-
tion of volumetric density in our sample was 38% (116 037 of 
307 015), 35% (103 957 of 307 015), 24% (72 796 of 307 015), 
and 5% (14 225 of 307 015) for VDG1, VDG2, VDG3, and 
VDG4, respectively. The percentage of examinations classified 
into the two highest densities (VDG3 or VDG4) was 28%, 
which is lower than the expected distribution according to BI-
RADS. However, the distribution of our study population cor-
responded well with another European study (7). Our study 
included information about screening examinations performed 
among women aged 50–69 years who participated in a nation-
wide program offering biennial mammographic screening, 
which is different from the United States where women usually 
are screened annually from age 40 years.
To our knowledge, our study is one of the largest to date on 
volumetric mammographic density and performance measures 
in an organized breast cancer screening program, including 1791 
cases of screen-detected cancer and 384 cases of interval breast 
cancer. Furthermore, to assess the odds of breast cancer associ-
ated with volumetric mammographic density categorization, we 
obtained standardized data on breast cancer risk factors from a 
patient questionnaire with a high rate of response (23). The use 
of GE digital mammography systems only provided consistency 
in measurement.
Our study had some limitations. Despite the high complete-
ness of data, we had some missing values for tumor character-
istics and risk factors. Women included in the nondense group 
differed in some characteristics other than breast density from 
those in the dense group, making it difficult to conclude that 
differences in outcomes were solely because of breast density. To 
mitigate this issue, we included propensity scores in our analyses. 
Despite this correction, the results remained stable. The Bonfer-
roni correction reduced the level of significance for each statisti-
cal test from the standard level, which limited the amount of 
statistically significant findings.
Furthermore, VBD was determined by using nonprocessed 
images. Mammographic density might be different when as-
sessed by the radiologist or any other software by using processed 
images (12,30). The correlation of BI-RADS density categoriza-
tion between radiologists in the United States and Norway is not 
known. The women with dense and nondense breasts do not 
share the same distributions for the available covariates. Thus, 
Figure 3: Graph shows smoothed predicted number of cases per 1000 screening 
examinations for screen-detected breast cancer (SDC) and interval breast cancer (IBC) in 
BreastScreen Norway by using volumetric breast density stratified by 5-year age groups. 
Models for risk of SDC and IBC included cubic spline function with six knots. Covariates 
included continuous volumetric breast density, age at screening (continuous), screening 
location and history, body mass index, number of pregnancies longer than 6 months, 
first- and second-degree family history of breast cancer, and use of hormonal therapy.

this study had limitations related to the statistical uncertainty 
when constructing comparable groups.
In summary, by applying automated volumetric density mea-
surements to our population-based screening program for women 
aged 50–69 years, we found that screening examinations of women 
having dense breasts showed higher rates of recall and biopsy, and 
higher odds of screen-detected and interval breast cancers than 
women with nondense breasts. Our results can be used to help 
inform how automated volumetric density categorization will 
change population-based screening performance and outcomes 
under a more objective breast density measurement paradigm.
