ABSTRACT
Objective Acute heart failure (AHF) is associated with
high mortality and morbidity. Trimethylamine N-oxide
(TMAO), a gut-derived metabolite, has reported
association with mortality risk in chronic HF but this
association in AHF is still unknown. The present study
investigated TMAO in patients admitted to hospital with
AHF, and association of circulating levels with prognosis.
Methods In total, 972 plasma samples were analysed
for TMAO concentration by liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry. Associations with in-hospital mortality (72
events), all-cause mortality (death, 268 events) and a
composite of death or rehospitalisation due to HF
(death/HF, 384 events) at 1 year were examined.
Results TMAO improved risk stratification for in-
hospital mortality in combination with current clinical
scorings (OR≥1.13, p≤0.014). TMAO tertile analyses
reported a graded risk in adverse outcome within 1 year
(OR≥1.61, p≤0.004) and improved outcome prediction
when stratified as none, one or both biomarker(s)
elevated in combination with N-terminal pro B-type
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (OR≥2.15, p≤0.007).
TMAO was independently predictive for death and death/
HF when corrected for cardiac risk factors (HR≥1.16,
p≤0.037); however, this ability was weakened when
indices of renal function were included, possibly due to
multicollinearity.
Conclusions TMAO contributed additional information
on patient stratification for in-hospital mortality of AHF
admissions using available clinical scores that include
renal indices. Furthermore, elevated levels were
associated with poor prognosis at 1 year and
combination of TMAO and NT-proBNP provided
additional prognostic information. TMAO was a
univariate predictor of death and death/HF, and
remained an independent predictor until adjusted
for renal confounders.
INTRODUCTION
Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common
heart conditions, especially in the elderly, and has a
high morbidity and mortality.1 More than 23
million people worldwide suffer from HF,2 and
approximately 50% of HF events lead to death
within 5 years.3 A multitude of factors and path-
ways regulate the development of this condition
(eg, neurohormonal regulation, mechanical stress/
hypertension and so on) as a (mal)adaptation/
remodelling response of the heart to intrinsic and
extrinsic stresses.4
Recent
studies
have
identified
a
hitherto
unknown interaction of the gut microbiome with
cardiovascular disease.5 The bacterial flora, which
shows heterogeneity between individuals with sea-
sonal and dietary influences,6 generates metabolites
from dietary nutrients.7 One pathway involves car-
nitine, a large nutritional component of red meat,
which is digested by bacteria into the downstream
metabolite,
trimethylamine
N-oxide
(TMAO).
TMAO is formed when bacteria cleave trimethyla-
mine
from
the
carnitine
molecule,
which
is
reabsorbed into the bloodstream and converted
to
TMAO
in
the
liver
by
flavin-containing
monooxygenases.8
Investigations of TMAO in heart disease have
shown an association of elevated levels with coron-
ary artery disease,9 promotion of atherosclerotic
plaque formation,10 renal fibrosis11 and the pro-
longation of the hypertensive effect of angiotensin
II.12 In addition, poorer prognosis (at 5 years) has
been reported in chronic HF (CHF) patients with
elevated levels of circulating TMAO.13 Thus, there
seems to be an association between increased circu-
lating levels of the gut-derived metabolite and pro-
gression
of
cardiovascular
conditions.
To
our
knowledge, the role of TMAO in acute HF (AHF)
remains unaddressed. The present study, therefore,
sought to investigate whether plasma TMAO con-
centrations show an association with AHF and
provide additional information for assessment of
prognosis of the condition.
METHODS
Study population
Nine hundred and seventy-two patients with AHF
were
admitted
to
the
University
Hospitals
of
Leicester, UK between February 2006 and August
2011.
Each
patient
consented
(written
and
informed) to have blood samples taken and out-
comes surveyed. This study complied with the
Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
local ethics committee. Diagnosis of AHF was
made on the basis of progressive worsening or new
onset of shortness of breath along with clinical
signs of pulmonary oedema, peripheral oedema or
elevated jugular venous pressure.14 Exclusion cri-
teria included previous history of cancer or renal
replacement therapy; any surgical procedure within
the previous month; presence of cardiogenic shock,
sepsis,
pneumonia;
acute
coronary
syndromes
(ACS); and inability to consent (eg, dementia).
Where echocardiograms were performed, patients
were not excluded on values of preserved/reduced
ejection fraction.
The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality
(death) and a composite of death or rehospitalisa-
tion due to HF (death/HF) at 1 year, as obtained

 from hospital records. All surviving patients were followed up
for at least 1 year after initial hospitalisation, with a cut-off at
1 year implemented for the data in this report. All inclusion and
endpoint determinations were performed by an independent
cardiologist. In cases where the patient had multiple events, the
time to first event was counted as the outcome. The simplified
modified diet in renal disease formula was used to estimate
glomerular filtration rate (GFR).15
Sample collection
Venepuncture was performed in recumbent patients within the
initial 24 h period after admission to hospital with AHF. Blood
was collected in prechilled tubes containing EDTA and aproto-
nin, and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 1500g for
20 min at 4°C. Plasma was aliquoted and stored at −80°C until
analysis. At the time of analysis, samples were defrosted at room
temperature and analysed immediately after preparation.
TMAO and other biomarker measurements
Plasma TMAO was extracted using stable-isotope dilution and
analysed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spec-
trometry, with previously reported techniques.16 A brief explan-
ation of these methods is described in the online supplementary
material.
N-terminal
pro
B-type
natriuretic
peptide
(NT-
proBNP) was measured in all patients using a
sandwich
immunoassay as described previously.17
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics
(V
.22, IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA) and Stata (V
.14,
College Station, T
exas, USA). Patient demographics were com-
pared using the Mann–Whitney independent U test for continu-
ous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables, after
stratification by TMAO levels. Spearman’s correlations were per-
formed on TMAO values and continuous variables. Cox propor-
tional hazard analyses were used to identify the independent
predictors of death and death/HF. Multivariate models were
created with and without the inclusion of markers of renal func-
tion. TMAO and NT-proBNP levels were log transformed, and
normalised to 1 SD, so that HRs refer to the Z-transformed vari-
ables. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated to visualise
the relationship between TMAO and the outcome of death/HF.
Mantel–Cox log rank tests were used to assess the significance of
the stratification of using tertiles of TMAO and the relationship
of above-median and below-median levels of TMAO and
NT-proBNP in combination. Additional Kaplan–Meier survival
curves were generated to test the adverse outcome relationships
of TMAO levels and patients with and without de novo HF. To
test the predictive power of TMAO for in-hospital mortality,
binary logistic regression analyses were conducted and included
the ADHERE, OPTIMIZE-HF or GWTG-HF score.18–20 The
ADHERE score was categorised against the first (reference)
grouping and patients were assigned to risk groups 1 (lowest) to
5 (highest) using the ADHERE registry model. In addition, the
ADHERE score probability was calculated as a continuous
variable
from
the
following

and Z-transformed for use in analyses. OPTIMIZE-HF and
GWTG-HF data were Z-transformed for analyses. Additional
logistic regression calculations were performed for each of the
clinical risk score components listed individually, with the add-
ition of TMAO. Comparison of receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) curve areas was performed by calculating the probability
of outcome for each model and comparing baseline in-hospital
mortality models versus those models with the addition of either
NT-proBNP and/or TMAO. Reclassification analyses21 were used
to assess the utility of addition of TMAO and NT-proBNP to a
basic model of clinical risk scorings alone. A two-sided p value
of <0.05 was deemed to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patient demographics
Clinical and demographic factors are shown in table 1 for the
entire cohort and further categorised to above-median and
below-median TMAO levels. Analysis of trends for TMAO
showed that individuals with higher levels of TMAO were more
likely to be older, have reduced renal function, decreased heart
rate, BP and haemoglobin levels, increased levels of NT-proBNP
and potassium, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
(p≤0.038). More patients in the higher TMAO group had dia-
betes or previous HF, evidence of oedema or atrial fibrillation,
and were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV
(p≤0.042).
Clinical parameters associated with TMAO
Spearman’s correlation analyses were performed to assess the
clinical correlates of TMAO. Spearman’s rank correlation coeffi-
cients (rs) showed that TMAO was significantly correlated to age
(0.230), estimated GFR (eGFR) (−0.528), blood urea (0.529),
serum creatinine (0.515), NT-proBNP (0.207), systolic BP
(−0.110) and heart rate (−0.108, all p’s <0.0005).
A general linear model for independent predictors of log
TMAO levels indicated that the most significant predictors of
TMAO were age, blood urea and eGFR, with smaller contribu-
tions from past history of diabetes, smoking status, atrial fibrilla-
tion and NYHA class (table 2). The general linear model
reported that the variation of TMAO as explained by all factors
was 32.4%.
Plasma TMAO levels as a predictor of death/HF at 1 year
Cox survival analyses, including traditional cardiovascular risk
factors and variables that independently predict TMAO levels,
for the primary endpoint of death/HF at 1 year were produced
(figure 1A, B). TMAO was a univariate predictor of death/HF
(HR (95% CI) 1.33 (1.20 to 1.46), p<0.0005). As TMAO is
strongly associated with renal function, with eGFR and urea
recording variance inflation factors (VIFs) of 16.2 and 7.9,
respectively, multivariate analyses were performed with and
without the inclusion of these confounding factors, which may
show collinearity with TMAO. In multivariate analyses for
death/HF without correction for renal function, independent
predictors included age, de novo HF and past history of dia-
betes, NYHA class, systolic BP
, heart rate, respiratory rate and
NT-proBNP
. TMAO also showed independent predictive value
(HR 1.18 (1.05 to 1.33), p=0.005) (figure 1A). When eGFR
and urea were added to the model, TMAO was no longer able
to independently predict death/HF, indicating a strong con-
founding influence from biomarkers of renal function (figure
1B). Data modelling on a subset of patients, with the addition
of cardiac troponin, can be seen in online supplementary tables
S1 and S2 (note that cardiac troponin was available for 503
patients only). The findings on TMAO were similar to those
when troponin was excluded.
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis performed on death/HF rates
in TMAO tertiles (figure 2A) showed that the highest tertile was
different from the lowest (p<0.0005) and middle (p=0.04),
and for the middle tertile to be different from the lowest

 (p=0.004). The TMAO values for each tertile and the increase
in OR were as follows: lowest tertile (range (median)) 0.5–4.0
(2.9) mmol/L; middle tertile, 4.1–8.1 (5.6) mmol/L (OR (95%
CI) 1.61 (1.17 to 2.20), p=0.004) and highest tertile, 8.2–
151.5 (14.2) mmol/L (OR 2.12 (1.54 to 2.93), p<0.0005).
When patients were categorised according to below-median
or above-median levels of TMAO and NT-proBNP
, there was a
graded increase in death/HF depending on risk groups: group
with TMAO and NT-proBNP less than median versus group
with either TMAO or NT-proBNP greater than median (OR
2.15 (1.59 to 2.91), p<0.0005); and group with both TMAO
and NT-proBNP greater than median (OR 3.14 (2.18 to 4.50),
p<0.0005). The group with both biomarkers elevated was
different from all other groups (p<0.0005, figure 2B), and the
group with either biomarker elevated differed from the group
with neither elevated (p=0.007). No differences were reported
between high TMAO with low NT-proBNP
, and low TMAO
with high NT-proBNP (data not shown). Patients were further
stratified into four groups, dependent on high or low TMAO
and whether they suffered recurrent or de novo HF. No differ-
ences were seen in survival curves for death/HF between any
groups (p≥0.144) (see online supplementary figure S1).
Plasma TMAO levels as a predictor of death at 1 year
Univariate analysis showed that TMAO was a predictor of death
(HR 1.35 (1.21 to 1.51), p<0.0005). In multivariate analyses,

TMAO, alongside NT-proBNP
, with clinical risk scores as either
a categorical (ADHERE) or continuous variable (ADHERE,
OPTIMIZE-HF and GWTG-HF). TMAO levels, stratified by
ADHERE categorical score, were elevated in groups 3–5 and
are shown in figure 3. TMAO was an independent predictor
with
all
three
clinical
risk
scores
(OR≥1.13,
p≤0.012).
Interestingly, NT-proBNP was not an independent predictor (see
online supplementary table S5). When TMAO was added to a
base model of the clinical risk scores presented as their individ-
ual components, TMAO was no longer able to independently
predict in-hospital mortality, with a strong influence from bio-
markers of renal function (figure 4).
Reclassification analyses, using the continuous net reclassifica-
tion improvement index (table 3), showed similar findings.
NT-proBNP did not improve reclassification, whereas TMAO
did by a down-classification of risk in those without endpoints
(p<0.0005). Further reclassification analyses were performed
using the three clinical variables in the ADHERE scoring system
(blood urea nitrogen, systolic BP and creatinine) and the data
reported comparable findings to those obtained using the
ADHERE log odds mortality calculations (see online supple-
mentary table S6).
DISCUSSION
The present study shows that the gut-derived metabolite,
TMAO, demonstrates an association of circulating levels with
AHF, and to be a predictive biomarker for death and death/HF
at 1 year. Inclusion of markers of renal function caused TMAO
to lose independent predictive ability, possibly due to multicolli-
nearity as TMAO was significantly correlated to both urea and
eGFR. Furthermore, TMAO improved risk stratification for
in-hospital mortality in combination with current clinical risk
scoring methods. TMAO had been previously reported to show
independent association with adverse outcomes in stable HF
patients at 5 years.13 Collectively, we find that TMAO is additive
in the prediction of death and death/HF within 1 year, when
renal function is excluded. However, TMAO was additive in the
prediction of in-hospital mortality in patients with AHF when
using clinical risk scores that incorporate renal indices.

 TMAO further strengthened the prediction of death/HF at
1 year when combined with NT-proBNP
. Patients with elevated
levels in both markers were at the highest risk of death/HF, with
a graded risk seen above those with one, or neither elevated.
Combining these two circulatory analytes may provide useful
prognostic information in clinical assessment of AHF as previ-
ously demonstrated in stable HF.13 As NT-proBNP reflects neu-
rohormonal regulation of HF, and TMAO the involvement of
the gut microbiome, it is likely that these biomarkers reflect dif-
ferent and independent mechanistic contributions within the
complexity of HF.
When used in combination with the clinical risk algorithms
developed
for
in-hospital
mortality,
TMAO
was
able
to
independently predict in-hospital mortality for patients being
admitted with AHF. Interestingly, NT-proBNP did not add to
in-hospital mortality prediction for this cohort, and even signifi-
cantly down- or up-classified risk in those with or without
events when using the OPTIMIZE-HF score. When added to a
baseline model consisting of both the clinical risk score and
NT-proBNP
, TMAO was able to improve the stratification and
refine classification of mortality risk by predominantly down-
classifying those without endpoints. Addition of TMAO to the
base model of the clinical risk scores did not increase the ROC
areas. However, it has been previously demonstrated that where
comparisons of the ROC area report as insignificant, reclassifica-
tion analyses may offer greater sensitivity in highlighting an
improvement for the inclusion of an additional variable.22
Further improvements in sensitivity have been described when
using continuous category-free reclassification,21 as performed
with these data. However, in contrast, arguments have been pre-
sented to show oversensitivity in net reclassification analyses.23
Interestingly,
when
the
percentage
contribution
to
total
in-hospital patient mortality was assessed, elevated TMAO was
attributable to 75% of in-hospital deaths, whereas elevated
NT-proBNP was only 51%. For those deaths with elevated
NT-proBNP
, 78% of these patients also reported elevated
TMAO, therefore supporting the association of elevated levels
of TMAO with increased in-hospital mortality (see online sup-
plementary figure S3). This finding might suggest that the gut
microbiome contributes more than neurohormonal regulation
to short-term outcome in AHF.
The inverse
relationship
of
TMAO
and
renal
function
reported in this and previous work13 may partially explain the
link with poor prognosis, although TMAO may have additional
effects independent of this relationship since the clinical risk
scores
have
measures
of
renal
function
incorporated.
Association of TMAO with prognostic ability for AHF was not
as strong as seen previously with stable HF.13 Although the

 mechanistic underpinnings of this are not clear, these findings
might suggest that there is less contribution of the gut micro-
biome to AHF than CHF. The loss of independent predictive
value of TMAO when renal indices were included must be inter-
preted with caution. The high VIF values of urea and eGFR, in
relation to TMAO, may have reduced the level of statistical sig-
nificance of TMAO in modelling due to multicollinearity.
Correction
for
eGFR
has
been
used
in
previous
HF
cohorts,13 24 25 but no data currently report how levels of blood
urea affect the multivariate prediction models in CHF or ischae-
mic heart disease. Sample collections for TMAO analyses were
not strictly time-controlled due to emergency admission proce-
dures. Urinary levels are subject to time variation,26 although
time variability in blood is currently unknown. Other factors
(eg, time since last meal or urination) may alter the relationship
of TMAO to renal metabolites and these data would be additive
in future experiments.
Although a rise in TMAO has been linked to increased intake
of carnitine,10 this is associated with a pro-atherosclerotic effect
that is less likely to be a reason for adverse outcome in this
cohort as ACS were excluded. However, the onset of renal fibro-
sis with elevated TMAO levels11 may provide a more plausible
link to the pathophysiology of AHF cases. TMAO has been
shown to be effectively removed from the circulation by dialysis
in chronic kidney disease patients,27 and therefore a reduction
in renal function is a likely cause for the increase in plasma
TMAO concentrations. Mechanistically, increased TMAO may
induce renal fibrosis and, therefore, cause further reduction in
renal function. Combined with increased permeability of the gut
epithelium associated with intestinal congestion in HF,28 this
may lead to rapid circulatory rises in gut-derived metabolites
such as TMAO. Circulating TMAO may, therefore, be important
in patients with AHF and downregulation of levels may poten-
tially aid in the suppression of further renal impairment, and
ultimately a reduction in adverse outcome. Data to confirm
these links are not currently available and would provide great
insight into the role of TMAO measurements in this population.
In conclusion, TMAO levels contribute to risk prediction
models for in-hospital mortality, associate with poor prognosis
at 1 year and strongly associate with renal dysfunction in
patients with AHF. A larger, multicentre validation cohort with
extended clinical data would provide additional information
and strengthen the understanding for the prognostic use of
TMAO following admission with AHF.

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
Elevated levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut-derived
metabolite, have shown association with cardiovascular disease
and report poor survival statistics in stable heart failure patients.
What might this study add?
TMAO contributes to risk prediction of in-hospital mortality in
acute heart failure (AHF) when combined with current clinical
risk scores that include adjustment for renal function (OR ≥1.13,
p≤0.014). Reclassification analyses reported an improvement for
the combination of TMAO with clinical risk scores by
down-classifying those who survived the hospital admission
period (net reclassification index ≥26.1, p≤0.033).
How might this impact on clinical practice?
As routine clinical measurements expand and gut-derived
metabolites are being considered as potential biomarkers, we
report that measurements of TMAO for AHF admissions may
benefit clinicians when categorising patients for short-term risk
of serious adverse events.
