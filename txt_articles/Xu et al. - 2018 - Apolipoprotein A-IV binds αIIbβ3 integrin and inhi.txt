Platelet αIIbβ3 integrin and its ligands are essential for thrombosis and hemostasis, and play
key roles in myocardial infarction and stroke. Here we show that apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-
IV) can be isolated from human blood plasma using platelet β3 integrin-coated beads. Binding
of apoA-IV to platelets requires activation of αIIbβ3 integrin, and the direct apoA-IV-αIIbβ3
interaction can be detected using a single-molecule Biomembrane Force Probe. We identify
that aspartic acids 5 and 13 at the N-terminus of apoA-IV are required for binding to αIIbβ3
integrin, which is additionally modulated by apoA-IV C-terminus via intra-molecular inter-
actions. ApoA-IV inhibits platelet aggregation and postprandial platelet hyperactivity. Human
apoA-IV plasma levels show a circadian rhythm that negatively correlates with platelet
aggregation and cardiovascular events. Thus, we identify apoA-IV as a novel ligand of αIIbβ3
integrin and an endogenous inhibitor of thrombosis, establishing a link between lipoprotein
metabolism and cardiovascular diseases.

 A
polipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) is a 46 kDa exchangeable
plasma protein that shares structural features with other
apolipoproteins1. It is synthesized in the small intestine
and can rapidly increase 3–5 fold in response to the absorption of
dietary or biliary fat, particularly unsaturated fats2,3. After
secretion into the intestinal lymphatics, apoA-IV primarily
associates with chylomicrons and enters the blood circulation via
the thoracic duct. Unlike other apolipoproteins (e.g., apolipo-
protein A-I), apoA-IV binds to lipoprotein particles weakly and
can be readily displaced by other apolipoproteins4. As a result,
approximately 80% of circulating
apoA-IV is lipid-free3,5.
Although abundant in the blood (150–370 µg/mL)6, the exact
function of apoA-IV is still unclear. Roles postulated for apoA-IV
to date include regulation of lipoprotein metabolism and reverse
cholesterol transport, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and
control of food intake3,7. Several studies in different human
populations have consistently demonstrated that the plasma levels
of apoA-IV are inversely correlated with cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs)8–10, but its roles in platelet activity and thrombosis, the
major cause of heart attack and stroke, and the leading cause
of mortality and morbidity worldwide11,12, are unknown.
Platelets are anucleate cells in the blood that play a key role
in thrombosis and hemostasis13–16. They are also actively
involved in inflammation17,18, immune responses19–21, tumor
metastasis22,23, and contribute to the initiation of atherosclerosis
through interaction with other cells including endothelial cells,
leukocytes, and endothelial progenitor cells24,25. Recently, the role
of platelets in atherosclerosis has been highlighted since increased
platelet production accelerates atherogenesis25. Upon rupture
of the atherosclerotic lesion, platelet adhesion, and subsequent
aggregation at the site of injury may lead to thrombosis and vessel
occlusion, resulting in myocardial and/or cerebral infarction.
It has been well documented that platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is the
dominant integrin expressed on platelets, which plays a key role
in platelet adhesion and is required for platelet aggregation26,27.
Although fibrinogen (Fg), a major ligand of platelet αIIbβ3, was
considered to be essential for platelet aggregation (and con-
tributing in part to platelet adhesion), Fg-independent throm-
bosis occurs27–31. This suggests that other ligands of αIIbβ3 exist
which are involved in platelet aggregation and thrombosis, but
little information is available regarding what they are and how
they regulate thrombosis and hemostasis; two opposing but cri-
tical biological processes.
Here we show that apoA-IV is a novel ligand of platelet αIIbβ3
integrin. Through competing with Fg and other prothrombotic
ligands, it attenuates platelet aggregation, thrombosis, and post-
prandial platelet hyperactivity, and is an important endogenous
protective factor against CVDs.
Results
ApoA-IV is a novel ligand of αIIbβ3 integrin. To search for the
unknown ligands of αIIbβ3 integrin, we coated latex beads with
RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) peptide-activated human
platelet β3 integrins, and incubated them with human blood
plasma. Protein(s) associated with β3 integrin-coated beads were
electrophoresed and apoA-IV was identified by mass spectro-
metry. We found that apoA-IV bound to the surface of platelets
activated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or collagen, but not to
quiescent or β3 integrin-deficient platelets in platelet-rich plasma
(PRP) (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, apoA-IV-platelet association was
completely blocked by a specific anti-β3 integrin monoclonal
antibody (mAb) M130 (Fig. 1a). Thus, binding of apoA-IV to
platelets is dependent on activated β3 integrin.
Interestingly, apoA-IV bound to activated platelets, but was not
internalized by β3 integrins since no apoA-IV was detected in
resting platelets (Fig. 1b), which is different from either Fg or
fibronectin29,32. To confirm whether apoA-IV is a ligand of β3
integrin, we generated biotinylated recombinant apoA-IV and
detected the binding between apoA-IV and platelet β3 integrins
using a Biomembrane Force Probe (BFP)33,34 (Fig. 1c–e,
Supplementary Fig. 1a, Methods). The BFP brings an αIIbβ3
integrin-coated bead or a platelet target into contact with an
apoA-IV bearing force probe (Supplementary Fig. 1a), and detects
the
single-molecular
adhesions
from
the
pico-force
signal
measured upon target retraction (Supplementary Fig. 1b), while
a zero force indicates a non-adhesion event33 (Supplementary
Fig. 1c). At 1 mM Ca2+, apoA-IV bound to ADP-treated platelets
with high frequency and had minimal interactions with resting
platelets (Fig. 1c). ApoA-IV also bound to Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells that express αIIbβ3, but not to the cell lines that
express GPIb-IX or αMβ2 integrin (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, at
1 mM Ca2+, apoA-IV bound to purified αIIbβ3, but not αVβ3
and α5β1 integrins (Fig. 1e). Importantly, apoA-IV and αIIbβ3
interactions in these experiments were completely blocked by
anti-β3 integrin mAb M1 (Fig. 1c–e). Kinetic measurements
further showed that the effective two-dimensional (2D) affinity
of apoA-IV-αIIbβ3 is approximately 40% of the affinity between
Fg
and
αIIbβ3
(Fig.
2a).
Notably,
recombinant
apoA-IV
competitively inhibited the Fg-αIIbβ3 interaction in a dose-
dependent manner in BFP (Fig. 2b), enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (Fig. 2c) and a flow cytometric assay (Fig. 2d). Fg
also
inhibited
apoA-IV-αIIbβ3
interaction
(Supplementary
Fig. 1d–e), indicating that apoA-IV and Fg inhibit one another
in a reciprocal fashion. Furthermore, recombinant apoA-IV
decreased
Fg-mediated
platelet
adhesion
(Supplementary
Fig. 2a-b). These findings suggest that the occupancy of αIIbβ3
by apoA-IV inhibits Fg-αIIbβ3 interactions. We further found
that RGD peptides, the canonical integrin binding motif,
decreased apoA-IV binding to αIIbβ3 in a dose-dependent
manner (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, apoA-IV is identified as
a novel ligand of platelet integrin αIIbβ3.
ApoA-IV inhibits platelet aggregation in vitro. Fg-αIIbβ3
interaction plays an important role in platelet aggregation (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4) and is required for platelet aggregation in
anticoagulated blood27. Since apoA-IV can inhibit Fg-αIIbβ3
interaction, we first examined the role of apoA-IV in platelet
aggregation using apoA-IV-deficient (apoA-IV−/−) mice6 and
wild-type
(WT)
littermate
controls
(apoA-IV+/+).
Platelet
aggregation was significantly enhanced in the PRP of apoA-IV
−/− mice following stimulation with various agonists including
ADP, collagen, and thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP,
AYPGKF-NH2) (Fig. 3a). To distinguish whether this enhance-
ment was due to plasma apoA-IV deficiency, but not alteration of
platelet function, we switched apoA-IV−/− and apoA-IV+/+
plasma (platelet poor plasma, PPP), and found the enhancement
of platelet aggregation was specific to plasma apoA-IV deficiency
(Fig. 3b). This was further confirmed using plasma-free gel-fil-
tered platelets, in which plasma was removed during Sepharose
2B column filtration, and no differences were observed in
platelet aggregation between apoA-IV−/− and apoA-IV+/+ mice
(Fig. 3c). This is consistent with our data demonstrating that
apoA-IV was not internalized by platelets (Fig. 1b) and therefore
does not affect platelet granule release-related platelet aggrega-
tion. Considering the anti-inflammatory roles of apoA-IV7, pos-
sible alterations of inflammatory factors and other plasma
proteins in apoA-IV−/− mice may alter platelet aggregation, thus
recombinant human and mouse apoA-IV were used directly to
confirm these results. We found that recombinant apoA-IV
inhibited both WT mouse and human ADP-induced platelet

 aggregation in PRP in a dose-dependent manner (80–320 µg/mL)
(Fig. 3d, e). Recombinant apoA-IV also reduced platelet aggre-
gation induced by thromboxane A2 analogue (U46619), calcium
ionophore (AY23187) and various doses of collagen (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5a-b). Furthermore, apoA-IV inhibited Fg/von
Willebrand
Factor
(VWF)-independent
platelet
aggregation
(Supplementary Fig. 5c), which is known to be mediated by β3
integrin27,29–31.
To further evaluate the role of endogenous apoA-IV in platelet
function, we depleted human plasma apoA-IV with an anti-
apoA-IV polyclonal antibody. This depletion enhanced ADP-
induced platelet aggregation in healthy blood donors (Fig. 3f).
Furthermore, we employed transgenic
mice overexpressing
mouse apoA-IV (apoA-IV-Tg), which have an approximately 3-
fold increase in plasma apoA-IV compared to WT levels35.
Consistently, apoA-IV-Tg mice had markedly attenuated platelet
aggregation (Fig. 3g).
To test whether apoA-IV affects other physiological antagonist
pathways, we examined platelet cAMP levels and found that they
were not significantly altered by apoA-IV treatment (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6a). ApoA-IV also did not directly affect collagen-
and ADP-induced WT platelet P-selectin expression (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6b). However, it indirectly inhibited the late phase
P-selectin expression in an αIIbβ3-dependent manner, suggesting
it inhibits αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling-mediated platelet activation
and granule release36 (Supplementary Fig. 6c) and apoA-IV−/−
platelets had enhanced P-selectin expression (Supplementary
Fig.
6d).
Consistently,
it
inhibited
shear-induced
platelet
phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure (Supplementary Fig. 7a), which
is important for cell-based thrombin generation and blood
coagulation (Supplementary Fig. 7b).
These in vitro studies demonstrated that apoA-IV inhibits both
Fg-dependent and -independent platelet aggregation via blocking
αIIbβ3-ligand interactions, which subsequently inhibits αIIbβ3
outside-in signaling-mediated platelet activation. These suggest
its physiological roles in humans and animals.
ApoA-IV aspartic acids 5/13 are required for its inhibition. To
understand the structural basis of this antiplatelet effect and
localize the potential binding site in apoA-IV for platelet αIIbβ3
integrin, we first deleted both the N-terminal 38 amino acids
(Δ1-38) and C-terminal 41 amino acids (Δ336–376), leaving the
core helical bundle region we had identified previously37 (resi-
dues 39–335) intact (Fig. 4a). This deletion mutant of recombi-
nant apoA-IV (160 µg/mL) lost platelet-inhibitory function
(Fig. 4b). Similar results were observed when only the N-terminus
was deleted (Δ1–38, Fig. 4c, d). Interestingly, deletion of the
C-terminus (Δ336–376) in the presence of an intact N-terminus
enhanced the inhibitory function of apoA-IV (Fig. 4c, d). This
suggests that the N-terminus plays a key role in the interaction
with αIIbβ3 and the inhibition of platelet function, whereas the

 C-terminus negatively regulates this process. Our previous studies
have demonstrated that the C-terminus of apoA-IV can interact
with the N-terminus, which alters the lipid binding affinity of
apoA-IV38,39. These new data suggest that this intra-molecular
interaction also regulates the exposure of the apoA-IV N-termi-
nus for binding to platelet αIIbβ3.
Notably, apoA-IV does not contain an RGD sequence, the
classical binding motif of many integrin ligands. However,
through sequence analysis we observed two conserved aspartic
acid (D) residues at positions 5 and 13. The D residues in some
non-RGD integrin ligands have been reported to be essential
for integrin binding40. We replaced these residues individually
with glutamate (E), a conservative mutation that preserves
the negative charge, but increases the side-chain volume of the
amino acid. As expected, a mutation in D5E or D13E attenuated
the

 generated recombinant human and mouse double D mutant
(DM) apoA-IV with mutations at both of these residues and
found that DM apoA-IV abrogated these inhibitory effects

of apoA-IV (Fig. 4f, i).
To determine whether the double D mutations affected the
structure of apoA-IV, we performed circular dichroism (CD)
spectroscopy and thermal denaturation assays. CD wavelength
scans revealed excellent superimposition between the WT and
DM apoA-IV CD spectra, suggesting no loss of secondary
structural elements as a result of the mutation (Supplementary
Fig. 9a). In addition, both the WT and DM apoA-IV exhibited

 similar thermal denaturation profiles with a melting temperature
(Tm) of 54.3 °C (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Taken together, these
findings strongly suggest that double D mutations at the apoA-IV
N-terminus do not affect the global structure and stability of
apoA-IV. Furthermore, the synthetic peptide of the N-terminal
20 amino acids was capable of inhibiting platelet aggregation,
while the D5E, D13E, or DM mutations on the peptides
attenuated or abrogated its inhibition (Fig. 4j). These studies
demonstrate that D5 and D13 at the apoA-IV N-terminus are
required for its inhibitory function and are potential binding sites
for αIIbβ3 integrin.
ApoA-IV inhibits thrombus growth in vitro. To examine
whether apoA-IV affects thrombus formation under flow condi-
tions, we perfused heparin-anticoagulated and fluorescently
labeled whole blood from either apoA-IV−/− or apoA-IV+/+
mice across type I collagen-coated microcapillary perfusion
chambers, under a real-time fluorescence microscope. Compared
to apoA-IV+/+ controls, platelet aggregation and thrombus
growth were enhanced in apoA-IV−/− mouse blood both at
300 s−1 (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 10a) and 1800 s−1 (Fig. 5b,
Supplementary Fig. 10b) wall shear rates, corresponding to blood
flow in venules/large arteries and arterioles, respectively. Con-
sistently, addition of recombinant mouse apoA-IV (160 µg/mL)
to heparin-anticoagulated WT mouse blood significantly atte-
nuated the thrombus growth under both low (Fig. 5c) and high
(Fig. 5d) shear rates, while DM apoA-IV did not (Fig. 5c, d).
Recombinant mouse apoA-IV also markedly inhibited mouse
thrombus growth under shear rates that mimic stenotic arteries
(e.g., 5000 s−1; Supplementary Fig. 10c). Human thrombus
growth under both low (Fig. 6a) and high (Fig. 6b) shear rates in
the perfusion chambers was also inhibited by recombinant
human apoA-IV. These ex vivo results suggest that apoA-IV is a
significant inhibitor of thrombosis at both arterial and venous
shear rates.
Interestingly, we observed that the inhibitory effect of apoA-IV
increased with increasing shear rate (Figs. 5c, d and 6,
Supplementary Fig. 10–11). Considering the results obtained
with C-terminal truncated apoA-IV in platelet aggregation
(Fig. 4c, d), it is possible that high shear stress may disrupt
the previously reported intra-molecular contact between the
C and N termini38, increasing the exposure of N-terminal
residues that bind to platelet αIIbβ3. The enhanced platelet
inhibition with increasing shear rate may be a critical property of
apoA-IV opposing the formation of occluding plugs at the apex
of growing thrombi, thus preserving blood supply to the
downstream tissues.
ApoA-IV inhibits thrombus growth in vivo. To examine whe-
ther apoA-IV affects thrombus growth in vivo, we next utilized
two complementary intravital microscopy thrombosis models and
a large artery thrombosis model. Thrombus growth and vessel
occlusion induced by FeCl3 injury29–31,41 were significantly
accelerated in apoA-IV−/− mice versus apoA-IV+/+ littermate
controls (Fig. 7a). To exclude the possibility that apoA-IV in vivo
inhibition was due to anti-oxidant activity42 as opposed to
blockade of platelet αIIbβ3 integrins, we used a cremaster arter-
iole intravital microscopy thrombosis model which does not
involve oxidative stress as it induces mild vascular injury with a
laser43,44. We found that thrombus growth was also markedly
accelerated and thrombus dissolution was slower in apoA-IV−/−
mice than apoA-IV+/+ controls (Fig. 7b). Interestingly, we
observed that thrombi could reach occlusive size in apoA-IV−/−
mice (Fig. 7b), which has not been previously reported in this
laser injury model43. These findings indicate that endogenous
apoA-IV could inhibit thrombus growth and promote thrombus
dissolution. Intravenous infusion (9 μg/g) of recombinant mouse
apoA-IV attenuated the thrombus growth in apoA-IV−/− mice
(Fig. 7b). To examine whether apoA-IV also inhibits thrombus
growth in large arteries, a carotid artery thrombosis model45,46
was used. ApoA-IV−/− mice indeed exhibited accelerated vessel
occlusion in carotid arteries (Fig. 7c). We further demonstrated
that thrombus growth in WT mice was significantly inhibited
by intravenous infusion of recombinant apoA-IV, but not DM
apoA-IV, in mesenteric arterioles (Fig. 8a), cremaster arterioles,
and carotid arteries Fig. 8b). ApoA-IV significantly prevented
stable vessel occlusion in carotid arteries, suggesting its critical
inhibitory roles in high shear flow environments (Fig. 8b). These
data clearly demonstrate that apoA-IV is an endogenous antith-
rombotic factor.
To further evaluate the therapeutic potential of recombinant
apoA-IV, we compared apoA-IV treatment (9 μg/g) with aspirin
(20 μg/g) and clopidogrel (12 μg/g) treatments. The inhibitory
effect of apoA-IV was similar to aspirin or clopidogrel treatments,
although there was a synergistic effect when apoA-IV and
aspirin, or apoA-IV and clopidogrel were used in conjunction
(Supplementary Fig. 12). Importantly, there was no significant
alteration of bleeding time or blood loss between apoA-IV−/−
mice and littermate controls, or in mice transfused with apoA-IV
(Supplementary Fig. 13). No bleeding tendency has been observed
during surgery on these mice in the intravital microscopy
experiments after apoA-IV infusion (9 μg/g), although infusing
a higher dose (>45 μg/g, i.e., >5 times of physiological level) of
recombinant apoA-IV prolonged the bleeding time. These data
are consistent with the observations in heterozygous β3 integrin
deficient (β3+/−) mice that express approximately 50% αIIbβ3
on platelets without obvious bleeding disorders but do have
impaired thrombosis, particularly at high shear in vitro and
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 14a-d). In addition, plasma lipid
and cholesterol components in apoA-IV transfused mice were
not significantly altered (Supplementary Table 1). Therefore,
Fig. 4 N-terminal aspartic acids (D5 and D13) of apoA-IV are required for its inhibitory effect on platelets. a Schematic map of human apoA-IV. b Deletion
of both the N-terminus and C-terminus of human apoA-IV abolished the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by TRAP (250 μM) (39–335 vs Control:
NS; ApoA-IV vs Control: P < 0.01). c, d Recombinant apoA-IV lacking the N-terminus (Δ1–38) abolished the inhibition of platelet aggregation (Δ1–38 vs
Control: NS), while only deletion of the C-terminus (Δ336–376) enhanced the inhibition induced by (c) thrombin (0.5 U) and (d) ADP (2.5 μM)
(Δ336–376 vs ApoA-IV: P < 0.05). e Point mutation of aspartic acids (D5E or D13E) at the apoA-IV N-terminal attenuated the inhibition of platelet
aggregation (D5E and D13E vs ApoA-IV: P < 0.05). f–i Double D (D5 and D13) mutant human apoA-IV (f, g) and mouse apoA-IV (h, i) abrogated the
inhibition of platelet aggregation (DM vs Control: NS; ApoA-IV vs Control: P < 0.01). Area under the curve of each group was compared. j Synthetic
peptides of N-terminal 20 amino acids (N-20) of apoA-IV inhibited human platelet aggregation, while D5E, D13E or DM mutations on the N-20 synthetic

 apoA-IV may have the potential for treating thrombotic diseases
with a relatively safe therapeutic window.
ApoA-IV attenuates postprandial platelet hyperactivity. ApoA-
IV can be rapidly synthesized and secreted in response to lipid
intake2,47. To investigate the in vivo role of apoA-IV following
high fat diet (HFD), we tested platelet function from C57BL/6 J
WT, apoA-IV-Tg, apoA-IV+/+, heterozygous (apoA-IV+/−),
and apoA-IV−/− mice under fasting conditions, and after a HFD.
We observed that a HFD induced postprandial platelet hyper-
activity in WT mice (Fig. 9a). Transgenic mice overexpressing
mouse apoA-IV, with an increase in plasma apoA-IV con-
centration following HFD, markedly attenuated postprandial
platelet aggregation (Fig. 9a). Correspondingly, deficiency or
decrease of apoA-IV levels significantly enhanced postprandial
platelet function (Fig. 9b). Thus, apoA-IV is a postprandial reg-
ulator of platelet activity in vivo.

Fig. 8 Intravenous infusion of recombinant apoA-IV inhibits thrombus growth and vessel occlusion in vivo. a Thrombus growth (white) in wild-type mice
mesenteric arterioles was inhibited by infusion of recombinant mouse apoA-IV (rM-apoA-IV; n = 13) but not double D mutant apoA-IV (rM-DM; n = 11).
Representative images of thrombus growth in all mice tested is shown. b ApoA-IV prevented stable occlusion in a mouse FeCl3 injury carotid artery
thrombosis model. The time to first (left) and stable (middle) occlusion was significantly prolonged and the flow index (right) increased (indicating less
decrease in blood flow) by infusion of rM-apoA-IV as compared to vehicle (control) or rM-DM (n = 10). Individual experimental points are shown along
with median and interquartile range. In the control group, a circle and diamond with thick blue borders identify two cases that gave a value outside of the
90th percentile (red filling) for at least one of the parameters measured; note that abnormalities in the measured parameters are not concordant. In the
apoA-IV WT treatment (i.e., rM-apoA-IV) group, a blue and a yellow square identify the two cases in which treatment caused the least change in the blood
flow index, highlighting that one of them failed to achieve stable occlusion; thus, delayed stable occlusion is the most sensitive parameter to discriminate
the antithrombotic effect of rM-apoA-IV infusion. All significantly different comparisons are shown. apoA-IV WT recombinant mouse apoA-IV, apoA-IV

 Human apoA-IV inversely correlates with platelet aggregation.

peak
in
the
morning, likely related to the increased thrombosis in critical ves-
sels48–50. Besides changes in apoA-IV postprandial concentrations,
whether there are diurnal changes in apoA-IV levels in humans that
might contribute to the increased incidence of heart attacks in the
morning is unknown. We therefore studied the relationship
between levels of apoA-IV and platelet aggregation at 6-h intervals
for 24 h in 20 healthy volunteers. We found that humans exhibit the
strongest platelet aggregation in the morning around 06:00 (Fig. 10,
Supplementary Fig. 15a). Interestingly, plasma apoA-IV levels in
humans also exhibited a circadian rhythm, with a peak at midnight
and nadir around 06:00 (Fig. 10, Supplementary Fig. 15b). Impor-
tantly, our study revealed that the levels of apoA-IV and platelet
aggregation are, in most cases (16/20), inversely correlated
throughout the day (Fig. 10, Supplementary Fig. 15a-d). Therefore,
the lowest level of apoA-IV in the morning likely contributes to
enhanced platelet aggregation, leading to more adverse cardiovas-
cular and cerebrovascular events.
Discussion
Thrombotic disorders, such as heart attack and stroke, are the
leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Platelet
aggregation mediated by αIIbβ3 integrin and its ligands is
essential for the progression of these disorders. In this compre-
hensive study, using a series of in vitro and in vivo methods
(including the single-molecule force spectroscopy technique
BFP), as well as conducting human studies in healthy subjects, we
identified that apoA-IV is a novel ligand of platelet αIIbβ3
integrin and an endogenous inhibitor of platelet aggregation and
thrombosis. Through the long-term moderate but significant
attenuation of platelet hyperactivity, particularly during the
postprandial period, apoA-IV may also slow down the chronic

without impairing hemostasis.
Our results demonstrate that endogenous apoA-IV can block
20–40% of interactions between αIIbβ3 and Fg or other pro-
thrombotic ligands under static or low shear rate conditions.
Notably, clinical experience has not revealed pronounced bleed-
ing effects of a 50% reduction in αIIbβ3 expression (heterozygous
individuals who are carriers for Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia).
The same holds true in β3+/− mice. However, thrombosis is
different from hemostasis and the antithrombotic effect could
be achieved before bleeding occurs, as has been well documented
in both animal models and antithrombotic drug developments
in human clinical trials52–55. Such is the case in our thrombosis
models, in which thrombus growth was markedly decreased in
β3+/− mice in vitro and in vivo. Since there are limited
human cases of Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia, it is currently
unknown whether the 50% reduction in αIIbβ3 can also reduce
their risk for thrombosis. This concept is consistent with the
positive correlation between levels of Fg (αIIbβ3 ligand) and
platelet aggregation in vitro, and thrombotic events in patients
in vivo56,57.
Of note, apoA-IV has an enhanced antiplatelet and antith-
rombotic effect with escalating shear stress at the apical zone of
growing thrombi under flow conditions, likely due to high shear
stress that may disrupt apoA-IV intra-molecular interactions and
increase exposure of the apoA-IV binding site for αIIbβ3. This
may be critical for preventing vessel occlusion at the sites of
stenosis. In addition, competitive blockade of the Fg-αIIbβ3
interaction and αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling can subsequently
reduce platelet granule release and PS exposure, which may
decrease amplification of platelet aggregation, and thrombin
generation/clot
formation
in
non-anticoagulated
blood58,59.
These mechanisms may explain its stronger antithrombotic
effects in vivo than in vitro. Thus the blockade of αIIbβ3 by
apoA-IV is biologically significant in that this level of inhibition
does not significantly impair hemostasis, but can predominantly
attenuate thrombosis, while a low level of plasma apoA-IV
increases the risk for CVDs8,9. Indeed, our finding that circadian
rhythm of apoA-IV in most blood donors had a negative corre-
lation with platelet aggregation throughout a 24 h period, is
suggestive and might at least partially explain the high incidence
of heart attack and stroke in the morning compared to the
evening.
Recent studies have shown that the high density lipoprotein
(HDL) inhibits platelet function by promoting cholesterol efflux,
as well as by attenuating agonist-induced platelet activation sig-
naling pathways upon binding to platelet HDL receptors60–62.
Although a small fraction of apoA-IV in circulation is associated
with HDL particles, the inhibitory effects observed in our in vitro
study do not likely result from other HDL components, but rather
via apoA-IV directly antagonizing prothrombotic ligand-αIIbβ3
binding. Recombinant apoA-IV in buffer (i.e., in the absence of
HDL components) directly bound to αIIbβ3 in single molecule
BFP assays and inhibited gel-filtered platelet aggregation. Double
mutations of apoA-IV D5E and D13E, which do not affect global
structure and likely do not affect affinity of lipid binding39,
completely abolished the binding to αIIbβ3 and abrogated the
inhibitory effects on platelet function in vitro and in vivo. Fur-
thermore, apoA-IV did not significantly alter platelet cAMP
levels. However, the current study could not completely exclude
other mechanisms mediated by apoA-IV, such as possible inter-
actions with HDL, LDL or membrane lipid components25,62,
which may synergistically contribute to the inhibitory effect on
platelet aggregation and thrombus growth. It is also conceivable
that interactions with HDL and other plasma components may
increase the sensitivity of apoA-IV to shear stress, which facilitate
the accessibility of the N-terminus to αIIbβ3 integrin. These
possibilities merit future investigation.
The displacement of platelet β3 integrin ligands has broad
implications not only in thrombotic disorders, but also in
platelet-mediated inflammation. Platelet β3 integrins contribute
to platelet–leukocyte and platelet–endothelial cell interactions,
and the effect of β3 integrin inhibitors on reduction of intimal
hyperplasia has been well demonstrated in animal models63. We
previously reported that platelet Fg-αIIbβ3 integrin interaction
can induce platelets to de novo synthesize P-selectin64, an
important mediator of inflammation, leukocyte rolling and the
Th1 immune response, which promotes atherogenesis17,21,65. In
the current study, although we did not observe that recombinant
apoA-IV
directly altered platelet
activation
and
P-selectin
expression, apoA-IV indirectly inhibited the late phase P-
selectin expression by interfering with αIIbβ3-Fg/prothrombotic
ligand interactions and the subsequent αIIbβ3 outside-in signal-
ing, which is important for platelet granule release and P-selectin
expression36. Notably, in the absence of αIIbβ3, apoA-IV did not
significantly inhibit the late phase P-selectin expression on
thrombin-treated β3−/− platelets. Consistently, enhanced P-
selectin expression was observed on ADP-treated platelets from
apoA-IV−/− PRP, where Fg and other prothrombotic ligands can
more easily bind to αIIbβ3 and deliver outside-in signaling, which
may increase both platelet P-selectin synthesis and releasing. Our
data may explain why transgenic mice overexpressing apoA-IV
were protected from atherosclerosis51.
It has also been reported that postprandial spikes in glucose
and lipids may generate excess free radicals, induce inflammation
and enhance platelet-endothelial cell and platelet-leukocyte
interactions, which may play an important role in atherogenesis
and thrombogenesis25,66. In our study, we also observed that a
HFD induced postprandial platelet hyperactivity. The rapid
increase in apoA-IV secretion after lipid intake is therefore
important to attenuate postprandial platelet hyperactivity and
inflammation, and thus may be physiologically critical to slow the
progression of atherosclerosis and thrombogenesis. Furthermore,
since platelets have recently been revealed to contribute to tumor
metastasis23, in which αIIbβ3-mediated platelet-tumor cell het-
erotypic aggregation is involved23, whether apoA-IV can thus
attenuate this process remains to be investigated.
This study provides the first direct link between apoA-IV and
platelet activity, and the novel mechanisms as to why apoA-IV is
a protective factor for CVDs. We demonstrate that apoA-IV, by
antagonizing platelet αIIbβ3 integrin activity, attenuates platelet
aggregation and thrombosis, postprandial platelet hyperactivity,
and may also slow the progression of atherosclerosis (i.e., both
early and late stages of atherothrombosis). Furthermore, we
identified a circadian rhythm of apoA-IV in humans, which
negatively correlates with platelet aggregation and the risk of
cardiovascular events. Control of food consumption (e.g., increase
of unsaturated fat)2, which raises apoA-IV synthesis and secre-
tion, may have a significant impact on the prevention of the early
developmental stages of atherosclerosis. Infusion of recombinant
apoA-IV may be able to directly intervene in thrombosis and
control CVDs and stroke.

were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, USA). ApoA-IV−/− mice
have been backcrossed onto a C57BL/6J background to generate apoA-IV+/+ lit-

were kindly provided by Dr. Karen Reue (University of California, USA). β3
integrin gene-deficient (β3−/−) mice were kindly provided by Dr. Richard O.
Hynes (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA). Both female and male mice
were used with a ratio approximately 1:1 unless where indicated for the intravital
microscopy thrombosis models that only male mice can be used29,43. Genotypes of
all experimental animals were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis of tissue DNA. All mice were housed in the research vivarium of St.
Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, or in each participating institution. Mice or platelets
from mice were randomly allocated to experimental and control groups. General
conditions of mice were monitored, and the blood flow was evaluated before
in vivo experiments. Mice with conditions such as dehydration, or reduced activity
were excluded from the study. All animal studies were approved by the Animal
Care Committees of St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, Canada, University of Cin-
cinnati, Cincinnati, USA and The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA.
Mouse platelet and plasma preparation. Mice (6–8 weeks old) were anaes-
thetized and bled from the retro-orbital plexus using heparin-coated glass capillary
tubes29,30. Blood was collected into a tube containing sodium citrate or ACD (38
mM citric acid, 75 mM trisodium citrate, 100 mM dextrose). PRP was obtained by
centrifugation at 300 × g for 7 min. Gel-filtered platelets were then isolated from
the PRP using a Sepharose 2B column in PIPES buffer (PIPES 5 mM, NaCl 1.37
mM, KCl 4 mM, glucose 0.1%, pH 7.0). Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was prepared
by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 20 min. The PPP was further centrifuged at 10,000
× g for 5 min to remove the remaining cells.
Human blood preparation. Human blood samples were drawn from antecubital
veins of healthy volunteers after providing informed consent. Blood was obtained
by venipuncture into Li-Heparin Vacutainers and was allowed to rest at 37 °C
for 10 min prior to preparation of PRP. Whole anticoagulated blood was spun
at 300 × g for 7 min. The PRP was transferred to a fresh tube and stored at 37 °C
before experiments. Gel-filtered human platelets were prepared as described above
for mouse platelets. Human blood samples with significant hemolysis or visible clot
formation were excluded from this study. Human platelets were randomly allo-
cated to recombinant apoA-IV treatment or control groups. All experimental
procedures using human blood samples were approved by the Research Ethics
Board of St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, Canada, the Institutional Review Board
of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Guangdong Provincial Hospital of
Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.
Isolation of β3 integrin ligands. Human β3 integrins were coated on the latex
beads and the presence of active β3 integrins on the beads was confirmed by flow
cytometry with PAC-1 or anti-β3 integrin anti-sera using a FACScan™ flow cyt-
ometer (BD Biosciences, USA). Ligands were precipitated from fractionated,
heparin anticoagulated human blood spin filters (Centricon YM-100 and YM-50,
Millipore, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Beads were then
washed, resuspended in protein loading buffer, and subjected to 2D electrophor-
esis. The protein spots of interest were identified by MALDI Quadrupole time-of-
flight mass spectrometry.
Detection of apoA-IV on activated platelets. PRP was obtained from WT or β3
−/− mice and were pre-incubated with anti-β3 integrin mAb M1 (where indicated)
for flow cytometry. Resting or activated (20 µM or 50 µM ADP or 5 µg/mL
collagen) platelets were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Samples were
incubated with goat anti-human apoA-IV antibody (N-20, Santa Cruz), which
also detects mouse apoA-IV, and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz) at room temperature in the
dark. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.2 mL) was added to the sample immedi-
ately before acquisition. All samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a
calibrated FACScan™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For Western blot analysis,
resting or activated (0.5 U/mL thrombin) gel-filtered mouse platelets (4 × 107 to
1 × 108) were lysed, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE),
transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, and probed with
polyclonal goat anti-human apoA-IV antibody and rabbit anti-goat IgG HRP
conjugated antibody (Bio-Techne). Following apoA-IV detection, actin was probed
as a loading control after stripping the blots and the actin bands were visualized
using HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse actin antibody (Supplementary Fig. 16).
Protein expression and purification. Recombinant human and mouse apoA-IV
were expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and purified by immobilized metal
affinity chromatography (IMAC) columns (His GraviTrap, GE Healthcare)67.
Briefly, full-length human and mouse apoA-IV were subcloned into the pET30
E. coli expression plasmid containing 6× His tag and tobacco etch virus (TEV)
protease cleavage site. The uncut protein was expressed by 1-thio-β-D-galacto-
pyranoside induction and purified by affinity chromatography utilizing the
vector’s His tag and Ni2+ resin columns followed by overnight dialysis in PBS
buffer at 4 °C. The tag was then cleaved using the TEV protease overnight at 4 °C
and the cleaved tag was separated using the Ni2+ columns and collecting the
eluent containing pure cut protein.
Site-specific biotinylation of apoA-IV. Site-specific cysteine incorporation for
biotinylation was accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a
cysteine residue at the C-terminus for plasmid construction68. The target gene
fragment was first PCR amplified and subcloned into pET 30 E. coli expression
vector. Using human apoA-IV as the template, the target gene fragment was
amplified by PCR with upstream primers containing TEV protease site
(GAGAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGCGAG) with an Nco I site, and a downstream
primer including C-terminal linker GlyGlyCys (GGGGGCTGC) with a hind III
site. The final construct (TEV-apoAIV-GGC) was then inserted into a pET 30
expression vector using restriction endonucleases Nco I and Hind III. All muta-
tions were verified through sequence analysis. The expression plasmid TEV-apoA-
IV-GGC was next transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. Protein expression and
purification were performed as described above. For in vitro biotin labeling, the C-
terminal biotinylation of apoA-IV-GGC was performed by adding maleimide-
PEG2-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) into apoA-IV-GGC in PBS (pH7.4) for 30 min at
room temperature to produce a C-terminal biotinylated apoA-IV. SDS-PAGE and
Western blot analysis were used to verify apoA-IV biotinylation.
Biomembrane-Force-Probe detection of apoA-IV-αIIbβ3 integrin interactions.
Purified proteins (i.e., Fg and αIIbβ3) were covalently pre-coupled with maleimide-
PEG3500-NHS (JenKem, USA) in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5). To coat
proteins onto the glass beads, 2 μm silanized borosilicate beads (Thermo Scientific)
were first covalently coupled with mercapto-propyl-trimethoxysilane (Sigma-
Aldrich), then covalently linked to maleimide modified streptavidin (SA, Sigma-
Aldrich) and proteins of interest in PBS (pH 6.8) by overnight incubation33,34.
To coat beads with apoA-IV, SA alone pre-coupled beads were prepared as above.
Subsaturating biotinylated apoA-IV was coupled to SA beads by 2 h incubation
at room temperature. After resuspending in PBS with 1% BSA, beads were ready
for immediate use in BFP experiments. Please refer to the published protocols for
details33,34.
For the BFP adhesion frequency assay, in each BFP cycle, the target (a receptor-
bearing bead, cell, or platelet, i.e., αIIbβ3) was driven to approach and contact the
probe (a ligand-bearing bead, e.g., apoA-IV or Fg) with a ~15 pN compressive force
for a certain contact time (tc) (0.2 s by default, 0.1–1 s for adhesion frequency assay,
1 s for competition assay) that allowed for bond formation and then retracted for
adhesion detection. During retraction, tensile force signified an adhesion event and
no tensile force indicated a non-adhesion event. Adhesion and non-adhesion
events were enumerated to calculate an adhesion frequency (Pa) in 50 cycles for
each probe-target pair. As Pa depends on tc, the 2D effective on-rate (Ackon) and 2D
off-rate (koff) can be derived by fitting the Pa vs tc curve with the model
Pa ¼ 1 � expf�mrmlAckon½1 � expð�kofftcÞ�=koffg34, where mr and ml are the
respective surface densities of receptors and ligands measured by flow cytometry.
The 2D effective affinity (AcKa) is calculated as Ackon/koff. Three to five probe-
target pairs were measured at each tc. For the competition assay, Pa of Fg-αIIbβ3
interaction was measured with different concentrations of apoA-IV in solution.
Flow cytometry detection of platelet-bound Fg on human platelets. Resting
human gel-filtered platelets (1 × 108) were incubated with increasing doses of
human recombinant apoA-IV or BSA control, then incubated with FITC-
conjugated human Fg (15 min, room temperature). Platelet activation was induced
by TRAP (250 μM, 5 min, room temperature) in the dark. The samples were then
fixed using 4% PFA. Fg binding to the platelet surface was analyzed by flow
cytometry.

 Flow cytometry detection of P-selectin expression upon platelet activation.
Resting WT or β3 integrin−/− mouse gel-filtered platelets were incubated with
recombinant mouse apoA-IV (160 µg/mL) or the same molar concentration of
albumin for 10 min. To minimize αIIbβ3 integrin outside-in signaling induced
by ligand-αIIbβ3 interaction, particularly following platelet granule release (e.g., Fg,
VWF, fibronectin, and multimerin) that causes platelet aggregation, low platelet
concentrations (4 × 105/mL) were used. After incubation, the platelets were
treated with thrombin (2 U/mL), collagen (2.5 µg/mL), and ADP (40 µM) for 2
min. P-selectin expression was then detected with flow cytometry.
In vitro platelet aggregation assays. PRP and PPP from human and mice (apoA-
IV−/−, apoA-IV+/−, apoA-IV+/+ control, apoA-IV transgenic mice and WT mice)
were obtained by centrifugation of sodium citrate anticoagulated whole blood.
Platelet concentration in PRP or PIPES buffer was adjusted to 3 × 108 platelets/mL
with the use of autologous PPP or PIPES buffer27,30,41. Platelet aggregation was
performed at 37 °C with a sample stir speed of 1000 rpm using a computerized
aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp, Havertown, USA). Platelet aggregation in mouse
PRP was stimulated by 1 μM ADP, 1 μg/mL collagen, and 250 μM TRAP. Platelet
aggregation in human PRP was stimulated by 2.5 μM ADP and 5 μg/mL collagen.
Platelet aggregation in gel-filtered platelets was stimulated by 10 μg/mL collagen
and 0. 5U thrombin. For platelet aggregation after switching plasma from the
opposite genotype40, gel-filtered apoA-IV−/− and apoA-IV+/+ control platelets
were suspended in PPP (3 × 108 platelets/mL) from either the same or opposite
genotype, and aggregation was induced by 250 μM TRAP. In another set of
experiments, gel-filtered platelet aggregation in PIPES buffer was induced by
250 μM TRAP. Platelet aggregation induced by various agonists was also
measured after adding indicated doses of human or mouse recombinant apoA-IV
(incubation for 2 min). The change in light transmission was monitored and
recorded for at least 10 min.
Depletion of human plasma apoA-IV. Goat anti-human apoA-IV antibody (C-20,
Santa Cruz) was used to deplete apoA-IV in human PPP. Antibody was first coated
on the protein G Sepharose beads. The same amount of non-specific goat IgG
(Santa Cruz) was used as control. Human PPP was prepared as described above,
and added to the beads. The eluate was collected and used for western blot
(Supplementary Fig. 17) and platelet aggregometry. For platelet aggregometry, one
third volume of normal human PRP was combined with two third volumes of
apoA-IV-depleted human PPP or non-specific goat IgG-treated control PPP.
Site-directed mutagenesis. Depletion and point mutations of human and mouse
apoA-IV were created by site-directed mutagenesis37. Human or mouse apoA-IV
DNA was ligated into the pET30 expression vector using the NcoI and Hind III
sites with a cleavable N-terminal 6×His tag as described above. We generated the
single mutants Δ1–38 apoA-IV, Δ336–376 apoA-IV, D5E apoA-IV, D13E apoA-IV
and double mutants 39–335 (Δ1–38, 336–376 apoA-IV), DM (D5E, D13E apoA-
IV). Point mutagenesis was performed in the expression vector using the Quick
Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Canada). All
mutations were verified through sequence analysis.
Circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) and thermal denaturation assays. WT
and DM apoA-IV recombinant proteins were purified by size exclusion chroma-
tography on a BioRad SEC650 column equilibrated in PBS. Protein concentration
and purity were quantified by A280 and SDS-PAGE analysis, respectively. CD
spectral scans and thermal melts of WT and DM apoA-IV (concentrations ranging
from 0.4 to 0.5 mg/mL) were acquired on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a
1 mm quartz cuvette (Helma). CD wavelength scans were collected between 190
and 250 nm and averaged over five accumulations. Raw data was then converted to
molar ellipticity (deg.cm2.dmol−1). Thermal denaturation assays were carried out
at a single wavelength (209 nm) by monitoring the change in ellipticity as the
temperature was raised from 20 °C to 90 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. All thermal
denaturation data were baseline corrected, normalized between 0 (folded) and 1
(unfolded) and were fit to a nonlinear biphasic sigmoidal curve in GraphPad
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Ex vivo perfusion chamber assays. Rectangular microcapillary chambers (ibidi
channel slides, ibidi GmbH) were coated with 100 μg/mL type-I collagen
(Nycomed) or 50 μg/mL human Fg (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 4 °C30,31,45.
For murine studies, whole blood was collected from anaesthetized apoA-IV−/−,
apoA-IV+/+ control, or WT control mice (C57BL/6 J) with heparin (15 U/mL).
Blood was then fluorescently labeled with DiOC6 (1 μM, Sigma; 10 min, 37 °C).
ApoA-IV−/− or apoA-IV+/+ control mouse blood was perfused over the collagen-
coated surface using a syringe pump (3 min; 300 s−1 and 1800 s−1; Harvard
Apparatus, USA). WT control blood (treated with same volume of PBS), recom-
binant apoA-IV-treated blood (160 μg/mL), and DM apoA-IV-treated blood
(160 μg/mL) were perfused at shear rates from 300 s−1 to 5000 s−1. We performed
human blood perfusion chamber assays as described above. Platelet aggregation
and thrombus formation or platelet adhesion to Fg were recorded in real-time
under a Zeiss Axiovert 135-inverted fluorescence microscope (32 X-W objectives).
Quantitative dynamics of platelet fluorescence intensity were acquired by Slide-
Book software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc., USA).
Intravital microscopy thrombosis models. The experiments on intravital
microscopy thrombosis models were performed after injuries induced by ferric
chloride (FeCl3)27,29,41,45 or laser30,31,41,43. The person conducting the experiment
was unaware as to the genotype or treatments received by the mice.

arterioles was monitored in 3- to 4-week-old mice27,29,41,45. ApoA-IV−/−,
apoA-IV+/+, WT control, and WT mice treated with recombinant or DM apoA-IV
were used. Mice were injected with donor-matched fluorescently labeled platelets and
visualized under a Zeiss Axiovert 135-invertedfluorescent microscope (Zeiss,
Germany). Briefly, blood was collected into ACD from the donor-matched mice.
Gel-filtered platelets were prepared and labeled with Calcein AM (1 mg/mL,
Invitrogen, Canada) at room temperature for 20 min. Platelets were then injected into
the experimental mice via the tail vein with control saline buffer, mouse recombinant
apoA-IV (9 μg/g) or DM apoA-IV (9 μg/g). Mice were then anesthetized and the
mesentery was externalized. A single mesenteric arteriole of 100–120 μm diameter
was chosen and injury was induced by topical application of 30 μL of 250 mM ferric
chloride. The time required for formation of the first 20 μm thrombus and the time to
complete vessel occlusion was recorded. Images of thrombus formation and
dissolution were visualized with a fluorescence microscope.
For the laser-induced cremaster arterial thrombosis model30,31,41,43,
apoA-IV−/−, apoA-IV+/+ control, and WT control mice (male, 6–8 weeks old)
were anesthetized and a tracheal tube was inserted to facilitate breathing. The
cremaster muscle was prepared under a dissecting microscope and superfused
throughout the experiment with preheated bicarbonate-buffered saline. Antibody,
control saline buffer, mouse recombinant apoA-IV (9 μg/g) or DM apoA-IV (9 μg/
g) were administered where indicated by a jugular vein cannula. Platelets were
labeled by the rat anti-mouse CD41 antibody (Leo.A1; EMFRET Analytics,
Germany; 0.1 μg/g) injection. Multiple independent upstream injuries were induced
on a cremaster arteriole using an Olympus BX51WI microscope with a pulsed
nitrogen dye laser. The dynamic accumulation of fluorescently labeled platelets
within the growing thrombus was captured and analyzed using Slidebook software.
Ferric chloride-induced carotid artery thrombosis. Experiments were performed
in >8-week old, 20–35 g, isoflurane-anesthetized C57BL/6J mice of both genders45,46.
Ten minutes before inducing arterial injury, WT or mutant apoA-IV (9 μg/g), or an
equal volume (100 μL) of PBS were injected through a catheter into the right jugular
vein. After measuring the baseline blood flow rate (volume/time) for 20 s (s), the left
common carotid artery was injured by applying fresh FeCl3•6H2O solution (0.7 μL,
8%, 0.30 M Fe3+ ion) onto the exposed adventitia for 180 s. The vessel was then
rinsed with warm physiologic saline solution and the flow rate was measured for an
additional 1800 s (1980 s total from beginning of injury). Three parameters were
calculated: (1) time to first occlusion (O-1), until the flow rate was ≤0.1 mL/min
(maximum zero flow error of the probe); (2) time to stable occlusion (O-S), until the
flow rate was ≤0.1 mL/min lasting at that level for ≥10 min; and (3) flow index (FI),
the ratio of the volume of blood flowed through the artery after-injury (calculated by
integrating post-injury flow rate values sampled every second for 1800 s) to the
volume flowed through in an uninjured vessel (calculated from the average pre-injury
flow rate). For the carotid artery thrombosis model in apoA-IV−/− and apoA-IV+/+
control mice, the right carotid artery was dissected following anesthetization and held
with a miniature Doppler flow probe (TS420 transit-time perivascular flowmeter,
Transonic Systems Inc., USA). Carotid artery injury was induced with a strip of
Whatman filter paper saturated with 10% ferric chloride. Blood flow was monitored
until complete vessel occlusion was observed.
Bleeding time assay. ApoA-IV−/−, apoA-IV+/+, and WT mice (6–8 weeks old)
were injected with recombinant apoA-IV where indicated via the tail vein 40 min
before injury. Mice were anesthetized and maintained at 37 °C on a heating pad
during the experiment. The tip of the tail (5 mm) was cut off with a sharp scalpel,
and the tail was immediately placed into warm saline at 37 °C. Bleeding time was
recorded as the time to cessation of blood flow (bleeding stopped for >10 s). Blood
loss was calculated by counting the red blood cells in the PBS fraction.
Postprandial platelet function assay. C57BL/6 J WT, apoA-IV transgenic (apoA-
IV-Tg), apoA-IV−/−, apoA-IV heterozygous (apoA-IV+/−), and apoA-IV+/+ mice
(6–8 weeks old) were fasted for 12 h, followed by a HFD for 3 h. Blood was then
collected from these mice following fasting or HFD condition. Gel- filtered platelets
(2.5 × 108/mL) and PPP were prepared respectively. To minimize interference in
the light transmission of PRP, which is commonly caused by postprandial chylo-
microns and other lipid particles69, 125 µL gel-filtered platelets were incubated with
its PPP (125 µL) for 20 min under 37 °C. The same volume of PPP and PIPES
buffer were used as blank control. Platelet aggregations were then induced by
collagen (10 µg/mL).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect αIIbβ3 binding. A 96-well plate
(Nunc MaxiSorp) was coated with purified human αIIbβ3 or control proteins (BSA
and β3−/− platelet lysate) by incubation of 0.01 µg/µL protein in binding buffer

 (TRIS buffered saline with 0.05 % TWEEN-20 and 1 mM each of MgCl2, MnCl2
and CaCl2) at 4 °C overnight. Incubation of 3% skim milk (ED Millipore) and 2%
TWEEN-20 for 1 h at 37 °C was used for blocking. For Fg binding experiments,
wells were incubated with the appropriate Fg concentration in binding buffer for 1
h at 37 °C. Wells were then incubated with anti-fibrinogen mouse IgG (Sigma
Aldrich) followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz), both at
37 °C for 1 h. For apoA-IV binding experiments the desired protein concentration
in binding buffer was added to each well and incubated 1 h at 37 °C followed by the
incubation of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated protein
(Abcam), at 37 °C for 1 h. Peroxidase substrate, o-Phenylenediamine dihy-
drochloride (OPD, Sigma Aldrich) was prepared at 0.4 mg/mL in 0.05 M phosphate
citrate buffer at pH = 5.0 with 0.4 µL/mL of 30 % H2O2. The OPD peroxidase
reaction was stopped after 1 h with 2 M H2SO4 and the absorbance was read at 492
nm. Between incubation steps the plate was washed with copious amounts of TRIS
buffered saline with 0.5% TWEEN-20.
IC50 Determination: For the IC50 of apoA-IV; 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 5 µM Fg
was bound to immobilized αIIbβ3 in the presence of 1 µM apoA-IV in binding
buffer. While for the IC50 of Fg; 0, 0.3, 0.7, 1, 2, 5, and 10 µM apoA-IV were each
mixed with 1 µM Fg in binding buffer and bound to immobilized αIIbβ3. ELISA
absorbance was plotted against inhibitor concentration and the curves were fit to
the half maximal inhibitory model, eq. 170.

Human study to evaluate the correlation between apoA-IV and platelet
aggregation. Twenty healthy volunteers taking no medications (mean (range),
25.8 (20–31) years; body mass index, 23.6 (19.9–29.6) kg/m2; 10 women and
10 men) were recruited in this study. All participants gave written informed
consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The meals, sleep, physical activity, room temperature, and light the volunteers
received were all controlled. Blood samples were collected prior to meals via
venipuncture at 12:00, 18:00, 24:00, and 06:00 across a 24-h period. PRP and PPP
were prepared as described above. Plasma samples to be assayed for the
concentration of apoA-IV were stored at −80 °C until analyzed by ELISA. Platelet
aggregation was induced by ADP (6 µM) and assays were performed immediately
using fresh PRP and PPP within 1 h after blood samples were collected.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure apoA-IV plasma level.
Plasma apoA-IV concentrations were determined using an ELISA that employs
affinity purified goat anti-human apoA-IV polyclonal antibody as the capture
antibody (apoA-IV N-20; Santa Cruz). ApoA-IV N-20 was raised against a peptide
mapping near the N-terminus of apoA-IV of human origin. Recombinant human
apoA-IV proteins with known concentrations (determined by Nanodrop) served as
a standard. ApoA-IV N-20 (1 µg/mL) was coated on the surface of ELISA plates
(Nunc MaxiSorp) at 4 °C for overnight. 3% Skim Milk (Millipore) with 2% Tween-
20 in PBS buffer were used for blocking the wells at 37 °C for 1 h. We then incu-
bated recombinant human apoA-IV or human plasma samples (100 times dilution)
at 37 °C for 3 h, followed by incubation with the detection antibody, apoA-IV G-8, a
mouse monoclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping near the C-terminus
of apoA-IV of human origin (2ug/mL; Santa Cruz) at 37 °C for 2 h. The mouse IgG
kappa binding protein (m-IgGκ BP) conjugated to HRP (1ug/mL; Santa Cruz) was
then incubated in the wells at 37 °C for 1 h. OPD substrate and the stop solution
were used as described above. Three to five times washing were performed between
each step. Read absorbance at 492 nm and 650 nm in a plate reader.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was
assessed by unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test and non-parametric
Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunn’s test for multiple
paired comparisons. The sample size of each experiment was estimated based on
our previous experience and the publications from others32,33,37,47,50.
