ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND The prognostic importance of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as a specific risk factor for
cardiovascular (CV) disease has been challenged by recent clinical trials and genetic studies.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to reappraise the association of HDL-C level with CV and non-CV mortality using a
“big data” approach.
METHODS An observational cohort study was conducted using the CANHEART (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory
Care Research Team) dataset, which was created by linking together 17 different individual-level data sources. People
were included if they were between 40 and 105 years old on January 1, 2008, living in Ontario, Canada, without previous
CV conditions or severe comorbidities, and had an outpatient fasting cholesterol measurement in the year prior to the
inception date. The primary outcome was cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS A total of 631,762 individuals were included. The mean age of our cohort was 57.2 years, 55.4% were women,
and mean HDL-C level was 55.2 mg/dl. There were 17,952 deaths during a mean follow-up of 4.9 � 0.4 years. The overall
all-cause mortality rate was 8.1 per 1,000 person-years for men and 6.6 per 1,000 person-years for women. Individuals
with lower HDL-C levels were more likely to have low incomes, unhealthy lifestyle, higher triglycerides levels, other cardiac
risk factors, and medical comorbidities. Individuals with lower HDL-C levels were independently associated with higher
risk of CV, cancer, and other mortality compared with individuals in the reference ranges of HDL-C levels. In addition,
individuals with higher HDL levels (>70 mg/dl in men, >90 mg/dl in women) had increased hazard of non-CV mortality.
CONCLUSIONS Complex associations exist between HDL-C levels and sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidity
factors, and mortality. HDL-C level is unlikely to represent a CV-specific risk factor given similarities in its
associations with non-CV outcomes. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2016;68:2073–83) © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier on

or the past several decades, it has
been
widely
accepted
that
high-
density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
(HDL-C) plays an important role in the devel-
opment
of
cardiovascular
(CV)
mortality
and morbidity (1–4). Early epidemiological
studies consistently demonstrated a linear
inverse relationship between HDL-C levels
and CV events. For example, studies have
shown that each 1 mg/dl increase in HDL-C
level was associated with 3% to 4% lower
rates of death from cardiac causes (2,5,6),
suggesting that attainment of higher levels
of HDL-C may reduce the risk of CV events.
However, the inability of recent randomized
trials to improve clinical outcomes by attempting to
increase HDL-C level has challenged this conven-
tional wisdom (7–11). Newer epidemiological and
genetics studies have suggested that HDL-C level
may not be predictive of CV outcomes in all subjects
(12–15). Moreover, associations are known between
HDL-C level and other demographic and lifestyle fac-
tors, such as smoking, obesity, and limited physical
activity (2). These data suggest that HDL-C level
may be a confounded variable, and thereby question
the plausibility of HDL-C level as a specific risk factor
for CV disease (16).
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge,
no
large
population-based study has evaluated the associa-
tion between the full range of HDL-C levels and CV
and non-CV deaths in individuals living in the same
environment and exposed to the same health care
system. To achieve our objectives, we used the
CANHEART (Cardiovascular Health in Ambulatory
Care
Research
Team)
cohort,
which
is
a
novel
“big
data”
research
database
created
by
linking
together multiple individual-level population-based
datasets on sociodemographics, cardiac risk factors
and comorbidities,
laboratory
values,
health ser-
vices, medications, and clinical outcomes in Ontario,
Canada (17,18).
METHODS
The
CANHEART
cohort
used
in
this
study
was
created by merging 17 different individual-level data
sources using encoded identifiers to ensure patient
confidentiality
(17,18).
This
big
data
source
is
described in detail elsewhere (17,18). Specific data
sources essential to this current study included: 1) the
Ontario Registered Persons Database, a registry of all
Ontario residents with health insurance coverage;
2) the Canadian Institute for Health Information
Discharge Abstract Database, the Ontario Diabetes
Database, the Ontario Hypertension Database, and
the Ontario Cancer Registry, which were used to
identify previous cardiac risk factors and comorbid-
ities; 3) the Ontario Drug Benefit prescription data-
base,
which
was
used
to
determine
outpatient
prescription drug use for patients 65 years or older;
4) the Gamma-Dynacare Medical Laboratory data-
base, which captures 25% to 30% of all outpatient
laboratory testing in Ontario, was used to determine
cholesterol levels; 5) the Registrar General of Ontario
Vital Statistics Database, which was used to deter-
mine cause of death of all Ontarians; and 6) the Ca-
nadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), an ongoing
Canada-wide population-based survey that collected
information on self-reported health status, health
determinants, and health care utilization. This study
was approved by the Sunnybrook Health Sciences
Center Ethics Board. Consent was obtained by Sta-
tistics Canada from respondents to link the CCHS
database to administrative databases.
STUDY SAMPLE. Ontario residents who were alive on
January 1, 2008, were 40 to 105 years of age, and had
a valid Ontario Health Insurance Plan number were
eligible for inclusion in the study cohort. The incep-
tion year of 2008 was chosen to allow at least 4 years
of follow-up on every individual. We excluded in-
dividuals who had lived in Ontario for <2 years prior
to the inception date because they may represent
temporary residents of the province. To construct a
cohort of individuals without pre-existing CV disease,

 we excluded patients who had a history of myocardial
infarction, heart failure, stroke, and coronary revas-
cularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or
coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Individuals
who were long-term nursing home residents were
excluded. We also excluded conditions that may
reduce life expectancy such as a history of cancer,
dementia, peripheral vascular disease, abdominal
aortic
aneurysm,
and
venous
thrombosis
(deep
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). Identifi-
cation of these conditions was based on Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9th and -10th
revisions (17).
EXPOSURES AND OUTCOMES. Individuals who had a
fasting
HDL-C
measurement
performed
in
the
outpatient setting in the year prior to the inception
date (i.e., January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007) were
included in the study cohort. Cholesterol results
closest to January 1, 2008, were used as the exposure
measurement. HDL-C levels were determined by ho-
mogenous assay. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) levels were calculated by the Friedewald
equation. In Canada, national practice guidelines
recommend screening with full fasting lipid profile
every 1 to 3 years for all men older than 40 years of
age and women who are post-menopausal or older
than 50 years of age (19). Lipid testing is also re-
commended for individuals at any age with CV risk
factors, renal insufficiency, or evidence of athero-
sclerosis (19).
The primary outcome of our study was cause-
specific mortality. Information on cause of death
was obtained from the Ontario Vital Statistics Data-
base, which categorizes cause of death using ICD
codes (17). Deaths from CV causes were identified
with ICD-10-CA I00 to I99, deaths from cancer causes
were identified using C00 to D48, and the remaining
codes were used to identify non-CV, noncancer cau-
ses of death. Complete follow-up data were available
for each patient through December 31, 2012.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. The
study
cohort
was
stratified into pre-determined groups based on HDL-C
levels in mg/dl (#30, 31 to 40, 41 to 50, 51 to 60, 61 to 70,
71 to 80, 81 to 90, and >90) to allow examination of
the relationship between HDL-C levels and mortality.
Overall cause-specific mortality rates were standard-
ized by age and sex, calculated by direct standardiza-
tion using the 2006 Canadian population as the
reference population. Based on previous studies, the
HDL-C strata 41 to 50 mg/dl in men and 51 to 60 mg/dl
in women were selected as the reference ranges for
comparison (20). Analyses were stratified by sex
because HDL-C levels differ in men and women in the
general population. Tests of differences in character-
istics
across
strata
were
performed
using
1-way
analysis of variance for comparing mean values of
continuous variables and chi-square test for categori-
cal variables.
Cause-specific hazard models were used to esti-
mate the association of HDL-C levels on each of the
3 causes of death, after accounting for the other
2 causes of death as competing risks because in-
dividuals who died of a specific cause were no longer
at risk of other causes of death (21,22). Hazard models
were constructed separately in men and women. In
the final cause-specific hazard model, we adjusted for
the following factors: age, neighborhood income,
hypertension, diabetes, smoking, cholesterol levels
(non-HDL,
triglyceride
with
logarithmic
trans-
formation), previous comorbidities (chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, hemiplegia or paraplegia,
renal disease, liver disease, rheumatologic disorder,
bleeding,
major
psychiatric
disorder,
pneumonia,
respiratory failure, sepsis, and trauma), and the Johns
Hopkins’ Aggregated Diagnosis Groups, which has
been shown to accurately predict mortality in the
general ambulatory population (23). Alcohol use was
also included in the adjustment model for non-CV,
noncancer death. We imputed smoking status and
alcohol use for those with missing data based on the
characteristics of the respondents to CCHS surveys
(additional
details
can
be
found
in
the
Online
Appendix)
(17).
Analyses
were
conducted
in
10
imputed datasets and the validity of these databases
was checked by examining the distribution of the
observed and imputed values.
A series of additional analyses were performed to
enhance our findings. First, we performed covariate
adjustment starting with age, adding other variables
sequentially (cardiac risk factors, neighborhood in-
come, cholesterol levels, medical comorbidities, and
smoking) to ensure consistent results. Second, we
explored the association of HDL-C and cause-specific
mortality in individuals with different LDL-C levels
(#100 mg/dl and >100 mg/dl). Third, we examined
the potential impact of statins in a selected subgroup
of individuals older than 66 years of age who were
eligible for prescription drug benefits and stratified
them based on the presence or absence of statin
prescriptions within a year prior to cohort inception.
Finally, we examined the potential impact of obesity
by incorporating imputed body mass index (BMI) to
the adjustment model and stratified individuals by
BMI (more or less than 25 kg/m2) among those who
completed the CCHS.
Two-tailed p values <0.05 were considered signif-
icant. Analyses were performed with the use of SAS

RESULTS
To create the study cohort (Figure 1), we began with
more than 6.3 million Ontario residents 40 to 105
years of age, with a valid health card number, and
who were alive on January 1, 2008. From this study
sample, 870,729 were excluded for demographic or
medical conditions as described previously. Of the 5.5
million
eligible
individuals,
cholesterol
measure-
ments
were
available
in
631,762
patients
within
12 months prior to the date of cohort inception; these
individuals formed the study cohort.

 The mean HDL-C level was 55.2 mg/dl, mean non-
HDL-C
level
was
146.0
mg/dl,
and
the
mean
triglyceride level was 134.2 mg/dl. Table 1 shows the
baseline characteristics in all individuals as well as by
HDL-C strata. The proportion of elderly and women
was higher with increased HDL-C levels. Conversely,
individuals with lower HDL-C levels had progres-
sively higher rates of lower income, hypertension,
diabetes, smoking, and chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease. LDL-C levels did not have a consistent
relationship with HDL-C levels, whereas triglyceride
levels were lower in individuals with higher HDL-C
levels. Heavy alcohol consumption was more fre-
quently observed among individuals with very high
HDL-C levels. The mean HDL-C level was 48.9 mg/dl
in men and 60.2 mg/dl in women. The relationship
between lower HDL-C levels and higher rates of car-
diac risk factors and comorbidities were similarly
observed in men and women.
There were 5,108 individuals who also completed
the CCHS survey, which allowed us to examine
lifestyle factors by HDL-C levels (Table 1). There was a
strong relationship between healthier lifestyle factors
with
increasing
HDL-C
levels.
Individuals
with
increasing HDL-C levels had progressively higher
prevalence
of
lower
BMI
(<25
kg/m2),
moderate
physical activity ($30 min walking/day), and fruit
and vegetable consumptions ($5 servings/day).
MORTALITY AND HDL-C LEVELS. There were 17,952
deaths observed during a mean follow-up period of
4.9 � 0.4 years, of which 4,658 were due to cardiac
causes, 6,850 were cancer-related, and 6,444 deaths
due to noncardiac/noncancer causes. The overall age-
and sex-standardized mortality rate was 2.0 per
1,000 person-years for CV deaths, 2.5 per 1,000
person-years for cancer deaths, and 2.7 per 1,000
person-years for other deaths (Online Table 1). Age-
standardized mortality rates for men and women ac-
cording to HDL-C levels are shown in Table 2 and
Figure 2. In men, the age-standardized mortality rate
was 8.1 per 1,000 person-years. Individuals at the

 lowest 2 strata of HDL-C levels (#30 mg/dl and 31 to 40
mg/dl) had significantly higher overall mortality rates
at 14.7 per 1,000 person-years, and 9.3 per 1,000-
person years, respectively. Furthermore, individuals
at the highest HDL-C stratum (>90 mg/dl) also had a
higher
than
average
mortality
rate
at
12.1
per
1,000-person years. In women, a similar pattern was
observed where individuals with lower HDL-C levels
had significantly higher age-standardized all-cause
mortality and cause-specific mortality compared with
the overall rate. Also, a higher than overall age-
standardized mortality rate was observed for noncar-
diac/noncancer mortality in individuals with very
high HDL-C levels (>90 mg/dl).
Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of cause-specific mor-
tality in different cholesterol strata compared with
pre-specified reference ranges (41 to 50 mg/dl in men
and 51 to 60 mg/dl in women) are shown in the Central
Illustration.
Men
in
the
lowest
HDL-C
category
(#30 mg/dl) had increased cause-specific HR for CV
mortality (HR: 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45
to 2.25), cancer mortality (HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.32 to 1.97),
and other mortality (HR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.63 to 2.47) as
compared to individuals with HDL-C of 41 to 50 mg/dl.
Men with HDL-C levels from 31 to 40 mg/dl had
increased relative hazard that ranged from 15% to
29% for cause-specific mortality. For men with high
HDL-C levels (>90 mg/dl), increased hazards for
noncardiac/noncancer mortality were also observed
(Central Illustration).
Women with low HDL-C levels #30 mg/dl also
demonstrated significantly higher cause-specific haz-
ards of CV mortality (HR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.56 to 3.29),
cancer mortality (HR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.43 to 2.69), and
othermortality(HR:2.86;95%CI:2.17to3.76)compared
with women with cholesterol of 51 to 60 mg/dl.
Individuals with HDL-C levels 31 to 40 mg/dl and 41 to
50 mg/dl had significantly higher relative hazard
for cause-specific mortality that ranged from 7% to
43%. Women in the highest cholesterol category
(>90 mg/dl) had significantly increased hazard of non-
CV/noncancer deaths (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.71).
ADDITIONAL
ANALYSES. Among
149,348
indivi-
duals (61,343 men; 88,005 women) who were older
than 66 years, 31,507 men and 44,399 women were
prescribed statin therapy prior to cohort inception.
The relationship between HDL-C cause-specific out-
comes for statin users (Figure 3) was similar to our
overall cohort in that we observed those with lower
HDL-C had higher HR for cause-specific mortality.
Subjects with very high HDL-C levels were not asso-
ciated with significantly higher risk of mortality. For
29,836 men and 43,606 women older than 66 years
who were not prescribed statins, the relationship was
similar
with
those
prescribed
statins
(Online
Figure 1).
The results of additional analyses for patients with
LDL-C <100 mg/dl or $100 mg/dl (Online Figures 2
and 3) were consistent with the previous analysis
that lower HDL-C levels were associated with higher
HR for cause-specific mortality and subjects with very
high HDL-C levels also were associated with higher
risk. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of BMI,
but it did not alter our overall results, as shown in
Online Figure 4.

2078
 CANHEART “big data” cohort to examine the rela-
tionship of HDL-C levels and cause-specific mortality
in more than 630,000 individuals without previous
CV conditions. This afforded a unique opportunity
to extend previous knowledge by evaluating the
entire spectrum of HDL-C levels in an unselected
population. We found that lower HDL-C levels were
associated with a progressively higher proportion of
individuals who were socioeconomically disadvan-
taged and had less healthy lifestyle behaviors, more
cardiac risk factors, and a greater burden of medical
comorbidities. Even adjusting for a comprehensive
list of potential confounding factors, we found that
the relationship between HDL-C levels and outcomes
were not linear. Instead, we found lower HDL-C levels
had increased hazard of both CV and non-CV mor-
tality, and individuals who had very high HDL-C
levels
also
demonstrated
increased
hazard
of
non-CV mortality. This suggested that HDL-C level is
a marker of poor general health and may not be an
independent modifiable risk factor specifically for CV
disease.
Recent studies have cast doubts about the prog-
nostic importance of HDL-C level as a modifiable
risk factor (3,16,24). Trials of niacin and cholesteryl
ester
transfer
protein
inhibitors
have
clearly
demonstrated their ability to increase HDL-C sub-
stantially
(7–11).
However,
none
of
these
trials
exhibited
improved
clinical
outcomes
compared
with
the
placebo
arms.
Several
contemporary
studies have shown a lack of significant association
of
HDL-C
levels
and
outcomes
for
patients
on
higher-intensity statins, with coronary artery dis-
ease, or who had undergone coronary artery bypass
graft surgery (12,13,15). Genetic studies using Men-
delian randomization to examine the effect of very
low HDL-C levels found no association with pre-
mature coronary heart disease (14). Accordingly, the
current focus of the HDL-C hypothesis has shifted
away from absolute HDL concentrations and toward
the function of HDL-C. For example, HDL-C efflux
capacity has been shown to be less confounded than
HDL-C levels and a strong independent marker of
CV events (25).
Our finding that lower HDL-C levels were associ-
ated with higher risk of CV death was consistent
with
other
observational
studies.
However,
our
study was among the first to describe a similar
relationship with cancer death and other causes of
death. Wilson et al. (26) examined 2,748 Framing-
ham Heart Study participants and found no conclu-
sive relationship between HDL-C levels and cancer
deaths. The study was likely underpowered because
it was based only on 100 cancer deaths in men and
76 cancer deaths in women, whereas our study
included 6,850 cancer deaths, and 6,444 non-CV/
noncancer deaths. Wilkins et al. (27) conducted the
Lifetime
Risk
Pooling
Project,
which
included
a
community-based cohort of 24,440 participants, also
found
an
association
between
HDL-C
and
total
mortality in men. However, in contrast to our find-
ings, that association was attenuated after adjust-
ment for traditional CV risk factors and alcohol
consumption.
The majority of previous observational studies
likely lacked sufficient sample sizes to explore out-
comes at a full range of HDL-C levels. The Emerging

 CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION HDL-C and Cause-Specific Mortality in Individuals Without Prior CV Conditions
Ko, D.T. et al. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2016;68(19):2073–83.
In this observational cohort study, we examined the association of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level with cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV
mortality using a “big data” set created by linking together 17 different individual-level data sources. Lower HDL-C levels were independently
associated with higher risk of CV, cancer, and other mortality compared with individuals in the reference ranges of HDL-C levels (men: 41 to 50 mg/dl;
women: 51 to 60 mg/dl). Additionally, individuals with higher HDL levels had increased hazard of non-CV mortality. Given the similarities in
associations with CV and non-CV outcomes, it is not likely that HDL-C level represents a CV-specific risk factor.

 Risk Factors Collaboration was able to examine the
impact
of
cholesterol
levels
and
outcomes
on
302,430 subjects, but the data were merged from 68
long-term prospective studies from different time
periods and different countries. A major strength of
our
study
was
the
ability
to
examine
a
large
population-based cohort of individuals living in a
similar environment, under the care of the same
health care system, with complete follow-up for a
host of mortality outcomes. We observed a dose-
response
association
between
HDL-C
levels
and
cause-specific mortality outcomes that was “U-sha-
ped,”
rather
than
linear,
as
it
is
traditionally
described. Patients whose HDL-C levels were very
low (<50 mg/dl in women and <40 mg/dl in men)
and very high (>80 to 90 mg/dl) experienced a
greater hazard of death compared with individuals
who had HDL-C levels that fell within intermediate
ranges.
We are uncertain as to why higher hazard of
noncardiac/noncancer
mortality
was
observed
among individuals with very high HDL-C levels. A
previous study from Finland has suggested that the
increased risk associated with high HDL-C levels in
men might be related to increased alcohol intake
(28).
However,
similar
increased
hazard
was
observed in our study even after adjusting for heavy
alcohol use. The relationship of HDL-C levels and
mortality may be mediated through complex re-
lationships
of
many
factors
as
we
observed
a
pervasive pattern that individuals with low choles-
terol levels had lower income; worse lifestyle factors
in terms of ideal BMI, smoking status, physical ac-
tivity, and fruit and vegetable consumption; and
more comorbidities with higher prevalence of hy-
pertension, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and unfa-
vorable lipid profiles. Each of these factors is known
to be associated with increased risk of morbidity and
mortality.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. First, our study focused on
HDL-C because it is commonly performed in routine
clinical practice to assess CV risk. We were unable
to examine other potentially important aspects of
HDL-C such as the relationship of HDL particle sizes,
subclasses, or function with CV or non-CV mortality
because these data are not available at the popula-
tion
level.
Second,
our
laboratory
data
source
included approximately 25% to 30% of all outpatient
laboratory test results in Ontario. However, we have
previously found that individuals included in our
dataset are representative of those in the entire
province (17). Third, information on cause-specific
mortality
may
be
subject
to
misclassification
because we relied on vital statistics data, which
classify causes of death on the basis of death cer-
tificate reports. However, such misclassification is
likely nondifferential and unlikely to influence our
results
substantially.
Fourth,
we
did
not
have
smoking status or alcohol use in the entire popu-
lation. Using data from individuals in our study
cohort who also completed the CCHS survey, we
imputed smoking status and alcohol use for those
with missing data to facilitate additional analyses.
We analyzed the relationship of HDL-C and out-
comes with and without imputed values and found
the results were unchanged. Finally, although we
did not have physical measures of obesity beyond

 BMI, our overall cohort included individuals with
and without obesity, and the inclusion of BMI did
not alter our finding between HDL-C levels and
outcomes. This additional analysis reinforces the
fact that our associations were not just driven by
patients with increased adiposity.
CONCLUSIONS
In a large population-based cohort of individuals
without pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, low
and very high HDL-C levels were associated with a
higher risk of CV mortality as well as non-CV mor-
tality. HDL-C levels were highly correlated with many
factors such as sociodemographic, lifestyle, and co-
morbidity factors, all of which increase the risk of
adverse outcomes. These findings suggested that
HDL-C level is unlikely to represent a cardiovascular-
specific risk factor or a target for intervention given
similarities in its associations with noncardiovascular
outcomes.
