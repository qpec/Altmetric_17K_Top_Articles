Abstract
Mobile phone usage has become an integral part of our lives. However, the effects of the radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation 
(RF-EMR) emitted by these devices on biological systems and specifically the reproductive systems are currently under active debate. 
A fundamental hindrance to the current debate is that there is no clear mechanism of how such non-ionising radiation influences 
biological systems. Therefore, we explored the documented impacts of RF-EMR on the male reproductive system and considered any 
common observations that could provide insights on a potential mechanism. Among a total of 27 studies investigating the effects of 
RF-EMR on the male reproductive system, negative consequences of exposure were reported in 21. Within these 21 studies, 11 of the 
15 that investigated sperm motility reported significant declines, 7 of 7 that measured the production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) documented elevated levels and 4 of 5 studies that probed for DNA damage highlighted increased damage due to RF-EMR 
exposure. Associated with this, RF-EMR treatment reduced the antioxidant levels in 6 of 6 studies that discussed this phenomenon, 
whereas consequences of RF-EMR were successfully ameliorated with the supplementation of antioxidants in all 3 studies that carried 
out these experiments. In light of this, we envisage a two-step mechanism whereby RF-EMR is able to induce mitochondrial 
dysfunction leading to elevated ROS production. A continued focus on research, which aims to shed light on the biological effects of 
RF-EMR will allow us to test and assess this proposed mechanism in a variety of cell types.

Introduction
Over the past 20 years, the use of mobile phones has 
increased exponentially (Gorpinchenko et al. 2014), 
with a current estimate of more than one billion users 
worldwide (French et al. 2001, Meral et al. 2007). In the 
United States, there is approximately one device in use 
per person, and well above more than one person in 
European countries such as Germany, Denmark and Italy 
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Furthermore, the number of 
devices in service is rising at an estimated rate of 3% 
annually (ACMA 2013). Accordingly, the exposure of 
humans to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation 
(RF-EMR) emitted from these devices has also increased 
substantially, with an average talk time of 30 
min per day 
spent talking on mobile phones (CTIA 2011). The effect 
of this radiation on human health remains to be fully 
elucidated with current literature detailing an array of 
apparently contradictory results. Indeed, although some 
studies have identified pronounced deleterious effects 
of RF-EMR on a variety of cell types (Balode 1996, 
d’Ambrosio et al. 2002, Bilgici et al. 2013, Furtado-Filho 
et al. 2014, Hou et al. 2015, Kahya et al. 2014, Dasdag 
et al. 2015), others have reported only very subtle or 
no significant effects (Marchionni et al. 2006, Masuda 
et al. 2006, Dasdag et al, 2009, Demirel et al. 2012, 
Khalil et al. 2014). A confounding factor in these studies 
involves the use of differing RF intensity, frequency, 
exposure length and method of administration, which 
discounts the possibility of direct and robust study-to-
study comparisons. Such variation attempts to simulate 
elevated levels of exposure in certain studies and real-
life mobile phone exposure in others, which is extremely 
hard to model given the variability that exists in each 
of these parameters of intensity and frequency (Lerchl 
2013). For instance, the intensity of RF-EMR emitted 
from mobile phones varies from ~0.1–4 
W/kg (Fejes 
et al. 2005, Guney et al. 2007, La Vignera et al. 2012), 
whereas mechanistic studies have involved intensities as 
high as 27.5 
W/kg (De Iuliis et al. 2009a). Regardless of 
these differences, the balance of evidence supports the 
principle that RF-EMR has the ability to induce cellular 
damage (Adams et al. 2014). In light of this conclusion

and to work towards identifying real clinical risks, it 
is imperative that we develop an understanding of the 
mechanism(s) by which this form of radiation affects 
different biological systems.
Physical parameters of RF-EMR
Radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation is a form of 
microwave radiation. Its important properties include 
the frequency at which it is generated, measured 
in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz), and the 
intensity of the waves, or the specific absorption 
rates (SAR), which is a measure of the rate of energy 
transfer from the electromagnetic field to particles 
in an absorber, defined at a particular point in the 
absorber (Durney 1986). The frequency of RF-EMR 
emitted by mobile phone devices is in the range of 
 
900–1800 MHz, and the intensity of this radiation is 
generally restricted to a local limit of <2 
W/kg and 
whole-body limit of 0.08 
W/kg (Durney 1986, Chen 
2007) to enforce safe exposure levels in humans. 
Meanwhile, the ability of RF-EMR itself to penetrate 
into the skin and body is dependent on the permittivity 
and conductivity of the irradiated tissue, as well as 
the wavelength of the radiation, which is inversely 
related to the wave frequency (Fig. 1). Therefore, at 
lower frequencies, the penetration of the RF-EMR is 
higher and devices operating in the 900 MHz range 
will irradiate the body more; approximately 25% of 
the body in humans compared with 20% penetration 
at 1800 MHz (Durney 1986). However, it is possible 
that the penetration of RF-EMR into the testis may 
be more pronounced than other tissues, due to the 
fact that this organ is less protected by tissue in 
comparison to others. Mobile phone communications 
uses a variety of different frequency ranges, with the 
most common utilising the 880–915 MHz range for 
the global system for mobile communications (GSM) 
900 uplink (from mobile phone to base station), 
925–960 MHz for the GSM900 downlink (from base 
station to mobile phone), 1710–1785 MHz for the 
DCS1800 uplink, 1805–1880 MHz for the GSM1800 
downlink, 1920–1980 MHz for the universal mobile 
telecommunications system (UTMS) data uplink and 
2110–2170 MHz for the UTMS data downlink (Bolte 
& Eikelboom 2012). Of particular interest is this 
radiofrequency range, in which a majority of studies 
have used exposure frequencies of 900–1800 MHz. 
This in turn forms the basis of studies selected for this 
review.
Review focus
For the purpose of this review, we shall focus on an 
analysis of the effects of RF-EMR on the male reproductive 
system, a site that may be uniquely vulnerable to chronic 
EMR exposure from devices stored in the vicinity of 
the testes that are held in ‘standby mode’ and, more 
importantly, at the initiation of a call or when hands-
free mode is in use. Our specific interest is to draw a 
consensus regarding the impact of RF-EMR on the male 
germline, with an emphasis on frequencies that equate 
to analog/digital signals (900/1800 
MHz (Irmak et al. 
2002)) and with specific absorption rates (SAR) of up to 
4 
W/kg. We imposed strict search criteria, which gives 
this review focus on probing a potential mechanism 
of action, independent of its clinical significance. To 
source the appropriate studies, we used the following 
search terms: ‘rf-emr spermatozoa’; ‘radiofrequency 
electromagnetic radiation spermatozoa’ and ‘cell phone 
radiation 
+ 
spermatozoa’ in the PubMed database. Of 
those studies identified, we elected to review those 
reporting exposure at the RF range of between ~900 
and 1800 
MHz and those that focused on the male 
reproductive tract/spermatozoa. Such criteria were 
imposed to reflect the intensity of radiation emitted from 
the devices. This narrowed the list of articles to those 
summarised in Table 1. Largely independent of clinical 
significance, the unique cell biology of spermatozoa 
provides an ideal model in which the specific physical 
and chemical responses to EMR can be observed. 
These cells provide a sensitive model as (Aitken 2013, 
Aitken et al. 2014) (i) they are sensitive to damage by 
environmental factors including free radicals, (ii) they 
can be maintained for 48–72 
h in vitro in simple, defined 
culture media, (iii) their motility provides a readily 
assessable means of monitoring adverse biological

effects and (iv) they are clinically important because 
DNA damage in spermatozoa has the potential to 
influence the health and wellbeing of the offspring. As 
a consequence of the information summarised in this 
review, we propose a mechanism for the negative effects 
of RF-EMR on the male germline. Given the unique 
susceptibility of spermatozoa to subtle oxidative insults, 
which may arise from RF-EMR exposure, the translation 
towards clinical significance, especially involving other 
cell types, should not be made. However, given that 
spermatozoa may be acutely sensitive to stressors such 
as RF-EMR, we propose that a clear hypothesis for a 
mechanism of action can be developed using this model, 
which can then be applied for testing in other cell types.
The impact of RF-EMR on semen quality
Mobile phone use is becoming increasingly popular 
worldwide, with specific population groups, including 
businessmen and adolescents, estimated to spend as much 
as half of their day in close proximity to mobile phones 
held in either active or standby modes (Redmayne et al. 
2011, Roberts et al. 2014). Owing to the common practice 
of storing mobile phones in close proximity to the testes, 
these individuals may be unintentionally exposing their 
reproductive system to relatively high levels of RF-EMR. 
It is therefore of considerable concern that the use of 
mobile phones (Fejes et al. 2005, Yan et al. 2007, Agarwal 
et al. 2009, Gorpinchenko et al. 2014, Zalata et al. 2015), 
or exposure to RF-EMR emitted by these devices (De Iuliis 
et al. 2009a, Al-Damegh 2012, Ghanbari et al. 2013), 
has been linked to negative impacts on semen quality. 
Notwithstanding considerable controversy regarding the 
timing and nature of such exposures (Dasdag et al. 2003, 
Imai et al. 2011, Tumkaya et al. 2013), the principle that 
RF-EMR can elicit a detrimental effect on sperm function 
is supported by a growing number of studies (Fejes et al. 
2005, Agarwal et al. 2009, Mailankot et al. 2009, De 
Iuliis et al. 2009a, Liu et al. 2013a,b, Gorpinchenko et al. 
2014). In general, these data lend support to the notion 
that RF-EMR can significantly impair key aspects of sperm 
function including the motility and vitality of these cells 
and the integrity of their DNA (Table 1), suggesting a 
direct effect on mature spermatozoa. However, there is 
less compelling evidence to suggest an additional role at 
the level of spermatogenesis in reducing sperm counts 
 
in vivo (Imai et al. 2011, Tas et al. 2014). Indeed, a 
chronic, multigenerational study demonstrated RF-EMR 
to have no effects on sperm production and testicular or 
epididymal weight (Sommer et al. 2009).

on sperm quality, Wdowiak and coworkers (2007)

increased rates of abnormal sperm morphology and 
decreased motility compared with counterparts who 
did not use these devices. Furthermore, these effects 
were exacerbated with longer exposure to this form 
of radiation (Wdowiak et al. 2007). Since this report, 
additional studies have replicated the adverse impact 
of RF-EMR treatment on human sperm motility using 
a model waveguide device capable of emitting finely 
tuned electromagnetic radiation to mimic that emitted 
by mobile phones (Gajda et al. 2002, De Iuliis et al. 
2009a). The waveguide approach improves control of 
exposure as well as replicates the use of a mobile phone 
held in talk mode (Agarwal et al. 2009).
Males 
experiencing 
subfertility, 
for 
example 
asthenozoospermia and oligozoospermia, appear to 
be particularly vulnerable to RF-EMR as highlighted by 
a marked decline in sperm motility after the exposure 
of semen samples to a mobile device for just 10 
min 
(Zalata et al. 2015). Similar pronounced effects have 
also been documented after in vivo exposure of whole 
animals to a mobile phone operating in talk mode (Yan 
et al. 2007, Mailankot et al. 2009). In terms of the nature 
of the impaired motility, RF-EMR appears to primarily 
influence the capacity of spermatozoa to sustain forward 
progressive motility. Indeed, a study by Erogul and 
coworkers (2006) confirmed that the exposure of human 
spermatozoa to RF-EMR compromised their ability to 
sustain both rapid and slow progressive motility after 
an alarmingly brief exposure time of only five minutes. 
Although other studies have required longer exposure 
times (hours or days) to generate significant reductions in 
sperm motility, impaired progressive motility (involving 
a decrease in the percentage of cells displaying rapid 
progressive motility and a corresponding increase in 
cells expressing slow progressive motility) appears to be 
a common consequence arising from RF-EMR exposure 
(Fejes et al. 2005, Gorpinchenko et al. 2014) and was 
observed in 11/15 studies, as presented in Table 1.
Nevertheless, these studies must be considered 
alongside others in which the presence of RF-EMR had 
no overt effect on either progressive (Tas et al. 2014) 
or overall sperm motility (Aitken et al. 2005, Imai 
et al. 2011, Trosic et al. 2013). A possible explanation 
for such inconsistencies in the effects of RF-EMR on 
sperm motility rests with the use of different exposure 
conditions. Indeed, in a majority of studies reporting 
negative impacts of RF-EMR on sperm motility (64%), 
the study design featured the use of isolated human 
spermatozoa that were exposed to RF-EMR via a mobile 
phone device. In contrast, at least half of the instances 
in which no effect was recorded on sperm motility, the 
studies involved whole-body animal exposure using a 
signal generator to produce the RF-EMR (Aitken et al. 
2005, Trosic et al. 2013, Tas et al. 2014). Although 
these data further lend support to our proposal of 
spermatozoa as a sensitive model, they also highlight 
that in vivo, the body may be capable of absorbing 
some of this radiation (Fig. 1), thus, diminishing the 
level of exposure experienced by spermatozoa within 
the reproductive system.
Effects of RF-EMR on spermatogenesis
In addition to the studies indicating that the RF-EMR 
can have detrimental effects on sperm function, there 
are sporadic reports that this type of radiation can 
also affect the testes. It has been demonstrated that a 
60-minute exposure of male rats to RF-EMR daily for two 
weeks can cause widening of the seminiferous tubules 
(Al-Damegh 2012). In contrast, Dasdag and coworkers 
(1999) documented a thinning of seminiferous tubules 
in response to an intermittent mobile phone exposure of 
three minutes (on and off) for 2 
h per day in active talk 
mode every day for one month. 
To add further difficulty to 
the interpretation of these data, a subsequent study by the 
same authors (Dasdag et al. 2003), reported no changes 
to testis structure after a similar RF-EMR exposure time of 
20 
min every day for one month. In addition to potential 
impacts on the diameter of the seminiferous tubules, 
chronic exposure (3 
h per day for one year) of rats to 
RF-EMR reportedly elicited a reduction in the thickness 
of the tunica albuginea (Tas et al. 2014). Prolonged 
exposures (6 
h daily over a 100-day period) have also 
been associated with patterns of sperm aggregation that 
were absent from unexposed rats and independent of 
any impact on sperm morphology (Yan et al. 2007). 
Nevertheless, abnormal sperm morphology arising from 
RF-EMR exposure has been documented (Wdowiak 
et al. 2007). In humans, these abnormalities have 
primarily been associated with the sperm head leading 
to a reduced capacity to engage in interactions with the 
oocyte (Falzone et al. 2011). Curiously however, Ozlem 
Nisbet and coworkers (2012) suggest that this form of 
insult appears to have no effect on the head morphology 
of rat spermatozoa at a frequency of 900 
MHz, but 
instead alleviates the incidence of tail abnormalities 
and promotes a suite of positive functional outcomes, 
including increased testosterone levels and superior 
progressive motility. Furthermore, this group observed 
better formed seminiferous epithelia with 1800 
MHz 
exposure that was not seen in 900 
MHz or unexposed 
treatments. Moreover, another study involving exposure 
during pubertal development documented RF-EMR 
to induce no changes to the spermatogenic cycle or 
testicular morphology (Tumkaya et al. 2013).
Notwithstanding the conflicting nature of the data 
documented above, recent meta-analyses performed 
by Adams and coworkers (2014) and Liu and coworkers 
(2014) have concluded that RF-EMR has two major 
negative impacts on sperm function: significant 
reductions in motility and loss of viability. In line 
with the recent studies by Mailankot and coworkers 
(2009) and Trosic and coworkers (2013), this analysis 
confirmed that sperm concentration is not significantly

influenced by RF-EMR treatment. Although these data 
suggest that RF-EMR is not capable of causing major 
disruptions to the spermatogenic cycle, in line with 
Sommer and coworkers (2009), they do nonetheless 
highlight an effect on the functional attributes of 
spermatozoa. Such findings are particularly concerning 
given that they are attributed, at least in part, to studies 
involving human spermatozoa and therefore bring into 
question whether RF-EMR may be having any negative 
impact on fertility in our species. Collectively, the 
uncertainty surrounding the effects of RF-EMR on the 
male germline presents a challenge for interpretation, 
which is further exacerbated by the lack of any 
consolidated, mechanistic explanation for the effects 
of such low-energy radiation on biological systems.
Molecular mechanisms of RF-EMR action
Here, we focus on studies documenting the effects of 
RF-EMR on biology, with the purpose of identifying 
common pathways that may direct our understanding 
of how this factor influences biological systems. 
Furthermore, unveiling a mechanism to explain the 
biological stresses of RF-EMR will allow us to then 
rationally assess the clinical relevance of certain 
exposure conditions.
Generation of oxidative stress
It has previously been hypothesised that the biological 
effects of EMR could be attributed solely to heat 
stress, which is induced at the higher intensities of 
approximately ≥4 
W/kg radiation used in some studies 
(Hossmann & Hermann 2003, Li et al. 2007). However, 
through the use of various ‘intermittent’ exposure systems 
(e.g. 5 
min on/10 
min off), it has been demonstrated that 
the effects of bulk heat stress are likely to be negligible 
at the intensities of radiation generated during typical 
RF-EMR exposure (Liu et al. 2013a). Such results have 
subsequently been verified in the transformed GC2 
mouse spermatocyte cell line, in which it was shown 
that such transient exposure patterns are capable of 
inducing DNA fragmentation and oxidised base adduct 
formation (Liu et al. 2013b, Duan et al. 2015) in the 
absence of a significant impact on temperature.
RF-EMR treatment is known to have the capacity 
to induce oxidative stress, characterised by excessive 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that 
overwhelm the intrinsic cellular antioxidant capacity, 
in a variety of tissue types. Indeed, this phenomenon 
has been documented after RF-EMR treatment in whole-
body and ovarian tissue models of Drosophila (Manta 
et al. 2014), mouse fibroblasts (Hou et al. 2015), 
cultured breast cancer cells (Kahya et al. 2014), rat 
heart tissue (Ozguner et al. 2005), human lens epithelial 
 
cells (Yao et al. 2008) and mammalian spermatozoa 
(Agarwal et al. 2009, De Iuliis et al. 2009a, Kesari et al. 
2011). We have also replicated this response using 
transformed male spermatogonial and spermatocyte 
germ cell lines, documenting an increase in ROS of 
mitochondrial origin (B Houston & R J Aitken 2015, 
unpublished 
observations). 
Furthermore, 
of 
the 
 
27 RF-EMR exposure studies summarised in Table 1, 
at least 21 of these (78%) document negative effects of 
RF-EMR on one or more parameters of sperm function 
and/or testicular histology that are characteristic of 
responses elicited by oxidative stress, such as lipid 
peroxidation, impaired motility and the formation of 
oxidative DNA damage.
Such pronounced effects on the male germline 
may stem from the fact that spermatozoa are uniquely 
susceptible to oxidative stress. This vulnerability 
arises due to the highly specialised structure of the 
spermatozoon, featuring limited protective antioxidant 
capacity due to a diminutive cytoplasmic volume and, 
at the same time, an abundance of substrates for free 
radical attack including DNA, thiol-rich proteins and 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (Aitken et al. 2012a). 
The latter are of critical importance to the spermatozoon 
and are required to generate the membrane fluidity 
needed to support both motility and the membrane-
fusion events associated with fertilisation (Lenzi et al. 
2000). Yet when peroxidised, PUFAs elicit the formation 
of small molecular mass, electrophilic aldehydes that 
perpetuate a state of oxidative stress (Aitken et al. 2012a) 
as detailed in Fig. 2.
Human spermatozoa exposed to RF-EMR exhibit 
significant increases in mitochondrial and cytosolic 
superoxide formation (Agarwal et al. 2009, De Iuliis 
et al. 2009a), as well as a significant reduction in sperm 
motility (Fejes et al. 2005, Gorpinchenko et al. 2014). 
The causative link between excess ROS production and 
sperm motility loss is a well-established paradigm in 
sperm biology (Fig. 2). This is commonly attributed to 
increased lipid peroxidation and the ensuing formation 
of electrophilic aldehydes such as malondialdehyde, 
4-hydroxynonenal 
(4HNE) 
and 
acrolein, 
which 
are capable of covalently binding to proteins, thus 
compromising their function (Jones et al. 1979, Koppers 
et al. 2008, 2010, Aitken et al. 2012a,b, Moazamian 
et al. 2015). In the case of sperm motility, these 
compounds appear to alkylate sperm axonemal proteins 
that regulate sperm motility, particularly dynein heavy 
chain (Baker et al. 2015, Moazamian et al. 2015). In 
addition, electrophiles such as 4HNE are also known to 
promote oxidative stress by stimulating ROS generation 
through the sperm mitochondria (Fig. 2). This situation 
arises because another group of proteins alkylated 
by 4HNE is the constituents of the mitochondrial 
electron transport chain (ETC), particularly succinic 
acid dehydrogenase (Aitken et al. 2012b). When these 
proteins become adducted by 4HNE, it promotes the 
leakage of electrons from the ETC, which are then

consumed by the universal electron acceptor, oxygen, to 
generate superoxide anion (Aitken et al. 2012b). By such 
mechanisms, even slight increases in ROS induced by 
RF-EMR have the potential to become amplified through 
the mediation of the mitochondria. In support of this 
mechanism, it has been revealed that RF-EMR-induced 
ROS production does encourage lipid peroxidation in 
spermatozoa (Kesari et al. 2011, Al-Damegh 2012). 
Moreover, lipid peroxidation has also been localised 
within the testicular and epididymal microenvironments 
after RF-EMR treatment in vivo, and this has, in turn, 
been associated with a loss of sperm motility (Mailankot 
et al. 2009).
If RF-EMR is responsible for the induction of oxidative 
stress, we should see evidence of ROS overwhelming 
the sperm cell’s antioxidant defences under these 
conditions (Gharagozloo & Aitken 2011). Indeed, 
intracellular concentrations of glutathione peroxidase 
and superoxide dismutase have been shown to be 
compromised in the spermatozoa of RF-EMR-exposed 
rats (Kesari et al. 2011). Furthermore, the addition of 
exogenous antioxidants such as vitamin C or E has 
been shown to significantly diminish RF-EMR-induced 
lipid peroxidation, while simultaneously leading to 
a partial restoration of the glutathione content of the 
testis in RF-EMR-exposed rats (Al-Damegh 2012). As 
an extension of this work, both spermatozoa (Kesari 
et al. 2011) and testes (Al-Damegh 2012) respond by 
increasing catalase activity after exposure to EMR. This 
potentially represents a physiological response aimed at 
counteracting increases in hydrogen peroxide and other 
ROS formation induced by RF-EMR stress. Interestingly, 
it has been suggested that RF-EMR may have more 
pronounced effects in poor quality spermatozoa as 
revealed in studies where only a proportion of the sperm 
population was found to respond to RF-EMR treatment 
(De Iuliis et al. 2009a). If this was the case, then the 
increased ROS production generated in these highly 
vulnerable cells could reasonably be expected to impose 
an oxidative stress environment upon the remainder of 
the sperm population (Tosic & Walton 1950).
Downstream of lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress is 
known to culminate in oxidative damage to sperm DNA 
(Fig. 2). This has been characterised by elevated levels of 
the DNA damage marker, 8-hydroxy, 2′-deoxyguanosine 
(8OHdG; Aitken et al. 2012b,c, Aitken et al. 2014). 
Accordingly, RF-EMR exposure has been shown to 
elicit a significant increase in the staining intensity 
for this marker in human spermatozoa (De Iuliis et al. 
2009a). RF-EMR has also been correlated with DNA 
strand breakage in spermatozoa (Zalata et al. 2015), 
cultured spermatogonia (B Houston & R J Aitken 2015, 
unpublished observations) and spermatocyte cells (Liu 
et al. 2013a). In the latter cell type, the DNA damage 
was successfully ameliorated by co-incubation of the 
cells with the antioxidant, melatonin (Liu et al. 2013a). 
Meanwhile, the observation that RF-EMR has the 
potential to generate sperm DNA damage is especially 
concerning due to the fact that these cells are capable 
of harbouring a considerable oxidative DNA damage 
load independent of any pronounced effects on motility 
(Aitken et al. 1998). These spermatozoa therefore have 
potential to participate in fertilisation, whereupon the 
oocyte would bear the responsibility for repairing the 
DNA before the initiation of S-phase of the first mitotic 
division. The fact that oocytes are relatively deficient in 
the first enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, 
OGG1 (Lord & Aitken 2015), means that any 8OHdG 
brought into the egg by the fertilising spermatozoon 
are likely to persist into the first cleavage division. 
As 8OHdG lesions are potentially mutagenic, these 
considerations may carry implications for the mutational 
load subsequently carried by the offspring, if the father’s 
germline has been oxidatively damaged by RF-EMR.
The ability of RF-EMR to induce damage, which 
leads to negative biological outcomes is yet to reach 
consensus; nevertheless, biological effects of RF-EMR 
are more strongly demonstrated in the literature and 
are likely to depend on the properties of the affected 
macromolecule. With respect to proteins, it is expected 
that this form of damage could be resolved upon 
Figure 2 Oxidative stress cascade within the spermatozoon. ROS is 
formed within the cell from a variety of possible sources including 
mitochondrial dysfunction, plasma membrane NADPH oxidase 
activity, infiltrating leukocytes and environmental factors such as 
electromagnetic radiation. In the event these ROS outweigh the poor 
antioxidant capacity of the cell, or a deficiency in this protection 
exists, a state of oxidative stress ensues. ROS, particularly hydrogen 
peroxide, attack the lipid membranes which are richly bestowed with 
polyunsaturated fatty acids that are susceptible to oxidative attack, 
resulting in the formation of small, reactive aldehydes – acrolein, 
malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal. Although these aldehydes 
differ in their reactivity (Moazamian et al. 2015), they each target a 
specific subset of protein centres, typically thiol constituents, as a 
form of nucleophilic attack. One major consequence of this is 
impairment of protein function, such as key proteins involved in 
sperm motility. Succinate dehydrogenase, a protein complex within 
the mitochondria, is a predominantly vulnerable target of these 
electrophilic aldehydes, and alkylation of this complex results in the 
disruption of redox-regulated metabolism within the mitochondria, 
forcing electron flow to oxygen and thus forming yet more 
superoxide anion. Furthermore, this imbalance of ROS leads to 
oxidative DNA damage as hydrogen peroxide migrates to the sperm 
head and preferentially targets guanine residues within the sperm 
DNA, highlighted by significant increases in the oxidised base 
product 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine.

turnover or degradation. However, in the case of long-
lived molecules such as DNA, the impact of such 
damage could be far more insidious. This is particularly 
the case in the male germline where the integrity of 
the paternal genome has direct implications for future 
generations. Of particular concern is the potential for 
the damage to be acquired in post-meiotic germcells, 
which have limited DNA repair mechanisms and are 
therefore unequipped to resolve the damage. This 
has been shown previously in spermatozoa, by the 
existence of dominant lethal mutations (Singer et al. 
2006), which indicate the possibility of these mutations 
to be transferred through one generation. Given the 
strong paradigm for oxidative stress as a key mediator 
of sperm quality and that published data support the 
conclusion that RF-EMR can drive ROS production in 
the male germline, understanding how RF-EMR induces 
ROS is therefore of key importance.
Metabolic pathways activated by RF-EMR
It has been demonstrated that RF-EMR has the ability to 
stimulate signalling pathways in somatic cells, such as 
those associated with the extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK) cascade (Friedman et al. 2007) or heat-
shock protein response (Di Carlo et al. 2002, Li et al. 
2007, Valbonesi et al. 2014). As both of these pathways 
are known to be redox regulated, it is possible that 
RF-EMR activates these signal transduction cascades as a 
secondary consequence of ROS production (Christman 
et al. 1985, Polla et al. 1996, Nahomi et al. 2015). 
As indicated previously, the major site of intracellular 
ROS generation observed after RF-EMR exposure is the 
mitochondria.
There are several lines of evidence that point to the 
mitochondria being the major mediator of RF-EMR 
action of biological systems. Thus, in pancreatic cancer 
cells, it has been shown that EMR has the ability to 
induce extensive changes to the morphology of the 
mitochondria, stimulating a loss of their membrane 
potential and significantly increasing production of 
ROS (Curley et al. 2014). This effect is mirrored across 
a variety of additional somatic cell types including rat 
hippocampal slices where EMR evokes substantial 
changes to mitochondrial morphology (Zhao et al. 2012) 
and membrane potentials (Tattersall et al. 2001), and 
human peripheral blood monocytes where it induces a 
transient decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential 
that is accompanied by increased ROS production and 
caspase activation; the latter of which are hallmarks 
of an apoptotic cascade (Lu et al. 2012). As indicated 
previously, there is also very clear evidence that RF-EMR 
activates mitochondrial ROS generation in spermatozoa 
(De Iuliis et al. 2009a).
Although such effects of RF-EMR have been recorded 
at radiofrequency levels of around 900–1800 MHz, 
corresponding to that emitted by mobile phones 
(Marchionni et al. 2006), contradictory stimulatory 
effects have in fact been observed at very low frequencies, 
less than 100 
MHz (Marchionni et al. 2006, Iorio et al. 
2011). Indeed, in marked contrast to the negative effects 
of RF-EMR, extremely low-frequency EMR (50 
Hz) has in 
fact been shown to encourage sperm motility (Iorio et al. 
2011). This effect is also believed to be a consequence of 
altered mitochondrial activity; however, in this instance, 
it appears that the EMR exposure leads to an increase in 
mitochondrial membrane potential (Iorio et al. 2011). 
Such a discrepancy may be explained, at least in part, 
by the variable degree of penetration achieved with 
EMR of different wavelengths (Lin 1976; Fig. 1). In this 
context, it is well established that the intensity of the 
RF-EMR decays exponentially as it penetrates the skin, 
whereas penetration depth varies between different 
tissues and organs (Fig. 1; De Iuliis et al. 2012, Markov & 
 
Grigoriev 2015). This radiation exposure generally 
depends on emitted power, but to some extent, it also 
depends on other parameters such as the frequency, 
antenna position relative to the body and the material 
properties of the absorbing tissue (Balzano 1999). 
In any case, the biophysics involved in these types 
of interactions is unresolved and represents a major 
limitation regarding RF-EMR studies (Lerchl 2013). We 
have also observed subtle variations in the response 
to RF-EMR when assessing mitochondrial function in 
male germ cells at different stages of maturation, with 
vulnerabilities to RF-EMR appearing to be dependent on 
the stage of development (B Houston & R J Aitken 2015, 
unpublished observations). This again highlights the 
potential difficulties with interpreting and rationalising 
the effects of RF-EMR on biology, given the diversity of 
cells that are potentially exposed by mobile phone use.
It is also probable that the variation in mitochondrial 
membrane potential stimulated by EMR is dependent on 
SAR, as extremely low-intensity radiation (2.5 
× 
10−5 W/
kg) fails to alter mitochondrial membrane potential in 
human promyelotic leukaemia cells (Jin et al. 2012). 
Similarly, mitochondrial membrane potential also 
remains unaffected when exposed to low doses of EMR 
(150–570 
μW/cm2) in mouse endometrial glandular cells, 
but it is successfully impaired with higher intensities 
(1400 
μW/cm2) (Liu et al. 2012). In human spermatozoa, 
mitochondrial ROS generation was evident at SAR values 
above 2.8 
W/kg (De Iuliis et al. 2009a), although there 
are no data linking such ROS generation to a change 
in mitochondrial membrane potential. Nevertheless, 
an increase in ROS generation has been consistently 
reported in studies focusing on the impacts of RF-EMR 
on spermatozoa (Agarwal et al. 2009, De Iuliis et al. 
2009a, Kesari et al. 2011, Al-Damegh 2012).
It should be noted that within the electron transport 
chain, small concentrations of superoxide are a normal 
by-product of this essential redox process. However, 
the magnitude of ROS leakage varies between the ETC 
complexes, with Complex I (NADH oxidase) responsible

for a bulk of the superoxide, and with the substrate 
used for energy production, as observed in isolated 
mitochondria (Quinlan et al. 2013). It is also important 
to note that superoxide production at Complex I is much 
more damaging than at Complex III in spermatozoa, due 
to the mode of emigration of ROS from Complex I to the 
matrix, allowing for subsequent peroxidative damage 
(Koppers et al. 2008). Meanwhile, ROS generated at 
Complex III escapes to the intermembrane space, where 
it encounters the pool of mitochondrial antioxidant 
protection. The movement of electrons through the 
electron transport chain is a highly regulated process, 
partly to limit the production of deleterious amounts 
of ROS. Perturbation of the electron flow through 
this chain by RF-EMR, and the subsequent promotion 
of electron leakage within the mitochondria, would 
provide a gateway for the formation of ROS such as the 
superoxide anion (Martino & Castello 2011) as part of 
a two-step process (Fig. 3). Considering that RF-EMR 
specifically promotes mitochondrial ROS production 
(De Iuliis et al. 2009a, Burlaka et al. 2013) associated 
with increased expression of mitochondrial apoptotic 
markers (Liu et al. 2015) and decreased mitochondrial 
membrane potential (Lu et al. 2012), we propose that this 
radiation potentiates the leakage of electrons within the 
electron transport chain. Such electron leakage may be 
achieved through interference with proton transmission 
through the transmembrane complexes of the inner 
mitochondrial membrane. This is caused by the ability 
of modulated EMR (such as that emitted from mobile 
phones) to augment the oscillation of ions, interfering 
with their transport through membrane proteins, thus 
potentially perturbing the strict membrane potentials 
(Panagopoulos et al. 2000, 2002, 2015) enforced 
in the specific intermembrane compartments of the 
mitochondria, which otherwise stabilise proton flow 
(Fig. 3; Perry et al. 2011). A consequence of reduced 
proton emigration is a reduced proton motive force and 
a subsequent reduction in ATP production (Perry et al. 
2011). Under these conditions, when the NADH/NAD+ 
ratio is high and associated with low or compromised 
mitochondrial respiration, as previously shown to be 
induced by EMR (Sanders & Joines 1984), superoxide is 
formed at Complex I (Kudin et al. 2004, Murphy 2009). 
This scenario is accompanied by the ability of RF-EMR 
treatment to significantly impair the conformation of 
proteins and DNA, including key antioxidant proteins 
(Lu et al. 2012), preventing them from participating in 
the elimination of radicals generated during respiration. 
Thus, as a first step, the combined effects of RF-EMR 
results in an imbalance of free radical formation and 
antioxidant status, driving a state of oxidative stress 
(Fig. 3). The ROS formed through this process, modified 
to hydrogen peroxide via mitochondrial superoxide 
dismutase, would in turn have the ability to drive a lipid 
peroxidation cascade (Al-Damegh, 2012), resulting 
in the production of electrophilic aldehydes including 
malondialdehyde (Mailankot et al. 2009, Kesari et al. 
2011) and 4HNE (Moazamian et al. 2015). Once 
formed, these potent electrophiles activate the second 
Figure 3 Potential effects of RF-EMR on the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Electron flow within the transport chain usually involves 
transfer of electrons through Complexes I and II into the Q pool where the electrons then feed into Complex III, interact with cytochrome-C and 
finally Complex IV where water acts as the terminal electron acceptor. Step 1, the presence of EMR may interfere with proton flow through these 
complexes, reducing proton motive force and ATP production. Via such mechanisms, EMR would also increase the NADH/NAD+ ratio (Sanders 
& Joines 1984), which would, in turn, promote the leakage of electrons from NADH to oxygen, forming superoxide anion – a progenitor ROS 
molecule. Subsequent dismutation of superoxide to H2O2 allows for step 2, where an imbalance of ROS results in lipid peroxidation and the 
formation of electrophilic aldehydes. These nucleophilic compounds impair the electron transport chain further by binding to the complexes of 
the ETC, promoting additional dislocation of electron flow and generating yet more superoxide, promoting extensive lipid peroxidation, motility 
loss and oxidative DNA damage. Grey arrows represent proton movement, black arrows represent electron flow, dashed lines represent electron

step of this response, inducing widespread interference 
within the electron transport chain by directly alkylating 
key proteins associated with the protein complexes 
of this pathway. As mentioned previously, Complex II 
(succinate dehydrogenase) of this chain is preferentially 
targeted by 4HNE (Aitken et al. 2012b). Modification 
or inhibition of Complex II prevents the oxidation of 
FAD in the succinate dehydrogenase-A subunit, forcing 
the flow of electrons to oxygen and thus resulting in 
elevated mitochondrial perturbation with consequential 
increases in superoxide formation (Zhang et al. 1998, 
Aitken et al. 2012b). Moreover, as mitochondria are 
responsible for a majority of ROS production within 
spermatozoa (Koppers et al. 2008), it is conceivable that 
disrupting the function of these organelles accounts for 
the elevated ROS production observed with RF-EMR 
treatment in several studies, as exemplified by De 
Iuliis and coworkers (2009b). An important feature of 
this putative mechanism is that it would account for 
the subtle or variable changes that RF-EMR has been 
recorded to induce in terms of sperm motility, owing to 
the fact that in species such as humans, mice and rats, 
the energy demands required to support motility are not 
exclusively dependent on oxidative phosphorylation 
(Williams & Ford 2001, Storey 2008). However, it should 
be taken into account that these cells are susceptible to 
a state of oxidative stress.
Conclusion
To date, contradictory studies surrounding the 
impacts of RF-EMR on biological systems maintain 
controversy over this subject. Nevertheless, research 
on the biological responses stimulated by RF-EMR is 
particularly important given our ever-increasing use 
of mobile phone technology. Although clinical studies 
are identifying possible detrimental effects of RF-EMR, 
it is imperative that mechanistic studies are conducted 
that elucidate the manner in which RF-EMR perturbs 
biological function, thus supplying a rational cause. 
A focus on the male reproductive system is justified 
given the potentially elevated levels of exposure 
this system may experience as consequences of 
the personal storage of mobile devices, the unique 
vulnerability of the highly specialised sperm cell, 
and the future health burden that may be created if 
conception proceeds with defective, DNA-damaged 
spermatozoa. Although this subject remains a topic 
of active debate, this review has considered the 
growing body of evidence suggesting a possible role 
for RF-EMR-induced damage of the male germline. 
In a majority of studies, this damage has been 
characterised by loss of sperm motility and viability 
as well as the induction of ROS generation and DNA 
damage. We have therefore given consideration to 
the potential mechanisms through which RF-EMR 
may elicit these effects on spermatozoa, which we 
used as a sensitive model system. We propose a 
mechanistic model in which RF-EMR exposure leads 
to defective mitochondrial function associated with 
elevated levels of ROS production and culminates 
in a state of oxidative stress that would account 
 
the varying phenotypes observed in response to 
RF-EMR exposure. With further complementary 
 
data, this model will provide new impetus to the 
field and stimulate research that will allow us to 
confidently assess the reproductive hazards of mobile 
phone usage.
