Acute kidney injury following cardiac
surgery: current understanding and future
directions
Jason B. O’Neal*, Andrew D. Shaw and Frederic T. Billings IV
Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates recovery from cardiac surgery in up to 30 % of patients, injures and impairs
the function of the brain, lungs, and gut, and places patients at a 5-fold increased risk of death during hospitalization.
Renal ischemia, reperfusion, inflammation, hemolysis, oxidative stress, cholesterol emboli, and toxins contribute to the
development and progression of AKI. Preventive strategies are limited, but current evidence supports maintenance of
renal perfusion and intravascular volume while avoiding venous congestion, administration of balanced salt as opposed
to high-chloride intravenous fluids, and the avoidance or limitation of cardiopulmonary bypass exposure. AKI that requires
renal replacement therapy occurs in 2–5 % of patients following cardiac surgery and is associated with 50 % mortality. For
those who recover from renal replacement therapy or even mild AKI, progression to chronic kidney disease in the
ensuing months and years is more likely than for those who do not develop AKI. Cardiac surgery continues to be a
popular clinical model to evaluate novel therapeutics, off-label use of existing medications, and nonpharmacologic
treatments for AKI, since cardiac surgery is fairly common, typically elective, provides a relatively standardized insult, and
patients remain hospitalized and monitored following surgery. More efficient and time-sensitive methods to diagnose AKI
are imperative to reduce this negative outcome. The discovery and validation of renal damage biomarkers should in time
supplant creatinine-based criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AKI.

Background
Risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) are common
among patients undergoing cardiac surgery (Table 1) [1],
and partially explain why AKI occurs in up to 30 % of
patients [2]. Many of these factors are not modifiable,
such as advanced age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
peripheral vascular disease [3]. Other factors are specific
to anesthetic, surgical, and ICU management, and physi-
cians should be cognizant of these factors in order to
eliminate or mitigate their effects. The unique characteris-
tics of cardiac surgery, including cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB), aorta cross-clamping, high rates and volumes of
exogenous blood product transfusion, and high doses of
exogenous vasopressors, increase the risk of AKI com-
pared with noncardiac surgery. These factors alter renal
perfusion, induce cycles of ischemia and reperfusion, in-
crease oxidative damage, and increase renal and systemic
inflammation—all mechanisms implicated in the develop-
ment of AKI [4].
Strategies to prevent AKI are integral to the routine
management of cardiac surgery patients. For example,
intravenous fluid management, surgical and extracorporeal
circulation techniques, and hemodynamic stability affect
AKI development. Pharmacologic and many nonpharma-
cologic treatments have largely failed to reduce cardiac
surgery-associated AKI in clinical trials, although some
treatments may be effective in specific patients. Recent
trials of high-dose perioperative atorvastatin and remote is-
chemic preconditioning (RIPC) therapy unfortunately have
provided minimal evidence that these treatments reduce
AKI following cardiac surgery [5].
When prevention fails, a prompt diagnosis of AKI is
required to allow physicians to implement the few

 strategies that are known to improve renal function. The
diagnosis of AKI typically includes the use of serum
creatinine (SCr) concentrations and urine output. Urine
output is relatively nonspecific, and increases in SCr
concentration require several days, extending the time
to diagnose AKI and initiate treatment. Measurement of
urinary markers of kidney damage may provide a more
rapid diagnosis, although candidate biomarkers require
further validation before clinicians will incorporate them
into routine patient care and expert groups implement
them into AKI diagnostic criteria [6].
Review
Pathophysiology
Mechanisms of cardiac surgery-associated AKI include
perioperative renal ischemia, reperfusion injury, CPB-
induced hemolysis and pigment nephropathy [7], oxidative
stress [8], and inflammation (Fig. 1).
Renal perfusion is complex and highly regulated. Al-
though 20 % of cardiac output perfuses the kidneys, the
majority of blood filtered by cortex glomeruli is shunted
away from the vasa recta. This shunt may help maintain
the electrolyte and water concentration gradients in the
renal medulla required for tubule and collecting system
reabsorption, but renders the renal medulla and cortico-
medullary junction hypoxic relative to other tissues (PO2
10–20 mmHg) [9]. This may be a protective mechanism
for oxidative injury but increases susceptibility to ische-
mia. During surgery many factors alter renal perfusion,
and tubules at the corticomedullary junction and in the
medulla are often damaged.
CPB provides nonpulsatile blood flow and may dysregu-
late the balance between cortical and medullary perfusion.
Paradoxically, increased cortical perfusion may precipitate
corticomedullary ischemia due to increased medullary
oxygen consumption from increased solute transport
[10]. Aorta cannulation and cross-clamping increase

 atheroemboli to the kidneys, further exacerbating ischemia
and inducing inflammation [11]. Other factors including
sympathetic nervous system activation, the endogenous
release of circulating catecholamines, and induction of the
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone cascade may further impair
renal oxygenation during surgery [12–14].
Cardiac surgery also induces renal and systemic inflam-
mation. Elevated postoperative plasma concentrations of
inflammatory cytokines are associated with a subsequent
diagnosis of AKI and increased mortality [15]. The mecha-
nisms that increase inflammation during cardiac surgery
are not fully understood, but contact activation from the
exposure of blood to the CPB circuit, ischemia reperfusion
injury, and oxidative damage all contribute [12, 16]. For ex-
ample, ischemia and most notably reperfusion induce react-
ive oxygen species production [17, 18], and reactive oxygen
species induce inflammation by upregulation of proin-
flammatory transcription factors, including nuclear factor
kappa-B [19, 20]. Cytokines and chemokines recruit neutro-
phils, macrophages, and lymphocytes into the renal paren-
chyma. Parenchymal infiltration and activation of these
immune cells increases AKI and leads to fibrosis [16].
The CPB circuit contains a pump, oxygenator, suction
catheters,
and
filters
that
damage
erythrocytes
and
increase plasma-free hemoglobin [21]. Free hemoglobin
depletes circulating haptoglobin and injures the kidneys
by catalyzing free-radical production, precipitating with
Tamms Horsfall proteins in the renal collecting system,
and inducing renal arteriole vasoconstriction by eliminat-
ing nitric oxide [22–24]. In addition, circulating labile iron
further increases reactive oxygen species production via
the Fenton and Haber Weis reactions [25, 26], particularly
in tissues where free hemoglobin and iron are sequestered,
namely the kidney. In a case–control study of AKI pa-
tients and risk-matched controls, patients who developed
AKI had twice the plasma-free hemoglobin at the end of
CPB than those who did not develop AKI, despite similar
AKI risk profiles and identical CPB durations in each
group (Fig. 2) [27]. These data suggest that hemolysis and
high concentrations of plasma-free hemoglobin, through
induction of subsequent injurious mechanisms or from
direct effects, may contribute to the development of AKI
following cardiac surgery.
Diagnosis
Establishing an accurate and timely diagnosis of AKI en-
ables prompt treatment. Current consensus guidelines for
AKI diagnosis use Kidney Disease Improving Global Out-
comes (KDIGO) criteria [6]. KDIGO criteria define AKI
as a 0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 mol/l) SCr increase from baseline
within 48 hours of surgery, a 50 % SCr increase from base-
line within 7 days of surgery, or a decrease in urine output
below 0.5 ml/kg/hour for 6 hours. All recent consensus
criteria for AKI diagnosis, including RIFLE, AKIN, and
KDIGO, use changes in SCr concentrations and urine out-
put [6, 28]. Oliguria is common following cardiac surgery
and typically occurs prior to SCr increase following renal
injury, but often is an appropriate response to intravascu-
lar hypovolemia. For this reason and because accurate
hourly urine output documentation is frequently poor,
AKI is most often diagnosed by clinicians using SCr mea-
surements. In a heterogeneous cohort of ICU patients,
however, AKI using urine output criteria was common
(60 % of the cohort) and associated with similar poor out-
comes (dialysis and mortality) to AKI by SCr criteria alone
[29]. AKI that met oliguria and creatinine threshold cri-
teria in this study was associated with significantly worse
outcomes than AKI from oliguria or creatinine alone.
These results need replicating in cardiac surgery cohorts.
Creatinine endpoints are better validated than oliguria
endpoints but unfortunately require many hours or days
to diagnose AKI after a renal insult and may be insensitive
to mild kidney injury since the kidney can maintain glom-
erular filtration as nephrons are damaged. Conversely,
small changes in SCr may reflect an ongoing systemic
inflammatory process nonspecific to AKI. Nonetheless,
the 0.3 mg/dl threshold is strongly associated with poor
outcomes [30, 31]. What remains unclear is whether poor

CPB times) control patients who did not develop AKI. Postoperative AKI
was associated with higher circulating concentration of free Hb during
and immediately following CPB (P < 0.01) and throughout the study
period (P = 0.006)

 outcomes associated with stage 1 AKI result from the AKI
or from an independent systemic process associated with
the AKI.
Scientists have identified proteins released from the
kidney during injury and others filtered by the kidneys
that more closely reflect glomerular filtration. These
markers of renal damage (e.g., NGAL, KIM 1, IL-18,
NAG, and GST) and function (cystatin C) offer several
theoretical advantages over SCr. Concentrations of dam-
age biomarkers increase in the plasma and urine within
hours of injury, may be more specific, and are more
sensitive. Haase et al. [32] validated these benefits for
NGAL when they demonstrated that NGAL-positive but
creatinine-negative AKI independently predicted the dur-
ation of ICU and hospital length of stay. Further validation
of these damage and function markers versus short-term
and long-term clinical outcomes including dialysis, length
of stay, mortality, and progression of chronic kidney dis-
ease (CKD) remains insufficient. These markers are most
frequently judged relative to SCr-based AKI criteria, and
SCr-based criteria provide a poor standard due to the
sensitivity and specificity concerns related to renal injury
outlined in the preceding paragraph. For this reason (lim-
ited validation) and others (limited availability and reim-
bursement), the aforementioned biomarkers are confined
to research purposes and are not used in clinical practice
today. The FDA recently approved the measurement of
urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) 2
and insulin-like growth factor–binding protein (IGFBP) 7,
markers of growth phase cell-cycle arrest, to aid in the risk
assessment for moderate or severe AKI within 12 hours of
cardiac surgery. Clinical use of these markers, marketed as
Nephrocheck®, to predict AKI has been limited, and their
validation versus acute and more persistent renal injury
is ongoing. The ability to measure AKI damage markers
in routine clinical practice, however, may help the renal
community advance past the use of SCr to diagnose,
predict, prognosticate, or monitor AKI.
Just as intensivists and nephrologists developed con-
sensus criteria for AKI diagnosis, clinician scientists are
hoping to adopt unified criteria for persistent renal in-
jury. This will enable therapeutic, clinical practice, and
epidemiologic data to be compared against a consistent
benchmark – the same benefits AKI consensus criteria
brought to the AKI field. The Major Adverse Kidney
Events (MAKE) composite, consisting of a 25 % or
greater eGFR reduction, dialysis, or death, meets this ob-
jective. Because some physicians believe AKI is transient
and not a clinically relevant endpoint, the adaptation of
MAKE as a primary endpoint may advance the field
[33]. MAKE are often assessed at 30, 90, or 365 days
after surgery. MAKE90 may be the best time point,
because 90 days is a threshold that nephrologists use to
declare AKI has progressed to CKD.
Predicting risk
Accurate prediction of AKI provides the opportunity for
clinicians to optimize high-risk patients, increase monitor-
ing, enroll patients in clinical trials, and initiate preventa-
tive and therapeutic treatments. Several risk stratification
systems exist for cardiac surgery patients. The best-
validated scores predict severe AKI requiring dialysis and
include the Cleveland Clinic Score and the Mehta Score
[34, 35]. These scores use similar risk factors to predict
AKI, although the Cleveland Clinic score offers the best
discrimination [36].
Prediction of mild and moderate AKI is also important
[37]. As such, Birnie et al. [38] analyzed data collected
prospectively from over 30,000 subjects undergoing cardiac
surgery at three hospitals in the UK to develop a model
using KDIGO criteria for predicting all stages of AKI. The
model’s risk prediction score for any stage of AKI (AUC,
0.74 (95 % CI: 0.72–0.76)) demonstrated better discrimin-
ation compared with the Cleveland Clinic Score and
equivalent discrimination to the Mehta score. This is the
first predictive model for all stages of AKI.
Incorporation of novel markers into prediction algo-
rithms may provide additional opportunities to identify
patients at high risk. To date, most studies have evaluated
the ability of damage and functional markers to predict
AKI as compared with clinical risk factors, but to our
knowledge these have yet to be incorporated into predic-
tion scores for AKI following cardiac surgery.
Prevention
Several practical interventions are available for the preven-
tion of AKI, starting with the management of intravenous
fluid administration. Although cardiac surgery is associ-
ated with microvasculature injury and tissue edema [39],
colloid administration is not clearly superior to crystalloid.
Colloid administration marginally improves maintenance
of intravascular volume compared with crystalloid [40],
and both albumin administration and hydroxyethyl starch
administration have been associated with increased rates
of AKI in some studies [41, 42]. However, a recent clinical
trial of hypoalbuminemic patients undergoing off-pump
coronary artery bypass surgery (OpCAB) demonstrated
that albumin administration decreased the incidence of
AKI compared with crystalloid [43]. The results suggest
hypoalbuminemia may be a modifiable risk factor for AKI
associated with OpCAB. It is not clear whether benefit
was derived from improved renal perfusion or direct ef-
fects of albumin on the kidneys [44]. Additional studies
are needed, particularly in on-pump surgery where inflam-
mation and tissue edema are often worse than in off-
pump surgery. With regard to crystalloid composition,
isotonic normal saline administration has recently been
associated with AKI, possibly as a result of the excess
chloride load [40, 45]. A meta-analysis of 21 studies that
O’Neal et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:187 
Page 4 of 9
 included 6253 subjects found high-chloride solution ad-
ministration to be independently associated with increased
risk of AKI (relative risk (RR), 1.64 (95 % CI: 1.27–2.13);
P < 0.001) and metabolic acidosis (RR, 2.87 (95 % CI:
1.95–4.21); P < 0.001), although mortality was unaffected
[46]. Interventional trials of hyperchloremic and balanced-
salt crystalloid solutions have thus far confirmed that
administration of normal saline may be harmful or at least
no different from administration of a balanced-salt solu-
tion during critical illness [47, 48].
“Goal-directed therapy” incorporates specific monitor-
ing techniques to guide intravenous fluid and vasoactive
agent administration and may reduce AKI and length of
stay when employed during cardiac surgery [49, 50]. One
study demonstrated that stroke volume optimization—a-
chieved by monitoring the effects of 250 ml3 fluid chal-
lenges on left ventricle stroke volume—reduced the
incidence of AKI following cardiac surgery from 19.9 % to
6.5 % (P = 0.002) [51]. The optimal fluid type, vasoactive
drug regimen, and guiding hemodynamic parameters for
goal-directed therapy are not well established.
Discontinuation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhib-
itors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), nonste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs, metformin, and diuretics
prior to surgery is typically recommended; however, the
largest clinical trial of perioperative ACEi in cardiac surgery
patients found higher rates of renal failure, defined as an
increase in SCr above 2.5 mg/dl, in patients randomized to
placebo compared with ramipril or spironolactone [52],
and another clinical trial found evidence that ACEi or
ARBs continued until the day of surgery were safe com-
pared with placebo [53]. Some studies indicate that intra-
operative calcium channel blocker administration may
limit AKI [54–56]. The use of these medications has not
gained acceptance, possibly due to concern for vasodilation
and reduced cardiac output.
To improve the balance between renal oxygen supply
and consumption, physicians have tested treatments that
increase blood flow or decrease oxygen consumption.
Fenoldopam dilates renal vasculature and therefore
increases perfusion. The evidence supporting its use is
mixed. Some studies have demonstrated that intraopera-
tive fenoldopam may reduce AKI following cardiac sur-
gery [57, 58], while another showed no benefit and
revealed a higher rate of hypotension [59]. These mixed
results may be explained by variable effects of fenoldo-
pam on the two distinct renal capillary beds. If glomeru-
lar perfusion increases to a greater extent than tubule
perfusion, increased solute delivery to the tubules may
induce medullary ischemia because increased solute
reabsorption requires more oxygen consumption [60].
Dopamine activates D1 receptors like fenoldopam but
also D2 receptors. Dopamine administration does not
prevent AKI associated with cardiac surgery [61, 62].
Sodium bicarbonate administration also decreases renal
oxygen consumption but has not been demonstrated to
consistently prevent AKI after cardiac surgery. One study
reported a reduction in the incidence of severe AKI (odds
ratio (OR), 0.45 (99 % CI: 0.43–0.48); P < 0.001) and the
need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) (OR, 0.38 (99 %
CI: 0.25–0.58); P < 0.001) [63], while another showed no
effect on AKI (RR, 0.99 (95 % CI: 0.78–1.24); P = 0.91) but
increased the ICU length of stay for patients who received
sodium bicarbonate (weighted mean difference between
groups, 2.06 days (95 % CI: 0.54–3.58); P = 0.008) [64].
The routine administration of sodium bicarbonate during
cardiac surgery is not recommended to reduce AKI [65].
Intravenous acetaminophen reduced plasma concentra-
tions of isofurans, in-vivo biomarkers of oxidative stress,
in both adult and pediatric cardiac surgery clinical trials
but did not affect AKI [66, 67]. Perioperative dexmedeto-
midine administration has been associated with a lower
incidence of AKI following valvular heart surgery (OR,
0.331 (95 % CI: 0.164–0.667); P = 0.002) and a decreased
likelihood of progression to a more advanced stage of AKI
(OR, 0.307 (95 % CI: 0.152–0.620); P = 0.001) [68]. This
association may be related to the vasoactive or anti-
inflammatory properties of dexmedetomidine and its ef-
fects on circulating levels of bone morphogenetic protein
7 (BMP7) [69, 70]. Propofol also increases circulating
levels of BMP7, and in mice decreased septic AKI [71].
Other anti-inflammatory regimens have been ineffective.
Two recent large multicenter randomized clinical trials
of perioperative steroid administration (the DECS trial
and the SIRS trial) did not find data to support the rou-
tine use of high-dose corticosteroids to reduce AKI fol-
lowing cardiac surgery, although there may be benefit in
patients younger than 65 years of age and those with
severe (stage 5) CKD [72, 73].
RIPC induces brief transient episodes of ischemia at a
site remote from vital organs (e.g., the arm or leg) before
organs are exposed to prolonged periods of ischemia
and reperfusion. RIPC is hypothesized to attenuate renal
damage by inducing the release of signaling molecules in
the circulation that activate Toll-like receptors in the
proximal tubule epithelia, conditioning the epithelium to
tolerate a subsequent inflammatory or ischemic stress
[74, 75]. Until recently, studies on the effects of RIPC on
AKI in cardiac surgery were small single-center random-
ized trials that produced conflicting results [76–78].
Three recent multicenter randomized trials were com-
pleted to further test the hypothesis that RIPC decreases
AKI following cardiac surgery.
Zarbock et al. recruited 240 cardiac surgery patients from
four medical centers in Germany at high risk for AKI
(Cleveland Clinic score ≥ 6) and randomized them to RIPC
or sham treatment. The RIPC treatment group had
decreased AKI, RRT, duration of ICU stay, and urine
O’Neal et al. Critical Care  (2016) 20:187 
Page 5 of 9
 concentrations of IGFBP-7 and TEMP2 compared with the
sham treatment group [79]. Shortly thereafter, Meybohm et
al. [5] reported in a trial of 1385 patients that RIPC had no
effect on moderate or severe AKI compared with sham
treatment (6.1 % RIPC versus 5.1 % sham, P = 0.45). The
study was also a multicenter, double-blind randomized
clinical trial in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery;
however, in these patients total intravenous anesthesia with
propofol was provided throughout surgery. This practice
limits the generalizability of the results, and in addition
previous studies have suggested that propofol blunts the
protective effects of RIPC on myocardial damage when
compared with isoflurane [80]. A third multicenter ran-
domized clinical trial of 1612 cardiac surgery patients
performed by Hausenloy et al. found no effect of RIPC on
stage 1, 2, or 3 AKI compared with control treatment [81].
So although RIPC treatment is supported by solid preclin-
ical studies, recent large randomized clinical trials in
patients undergoing cardiac surgery do not support its use
as a preventative measure for AKI.
OpCAB was developed in order to avoid the potential
harm of CPB during myocardial revascularization. Clinical
trials have not clearly demonstrated that OpCAB surgery
reduces the major morbidities associated with cardiac sur-
gery, although OpCAB may lead to marginally lower rates
of AKI compared with on-pump surgery [82, 83]. Trans-
catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) might reduce
AKI compared with on-pump aortic valve replacement
(AVR), since hemodynamics may be more stable during
TAVR compared with AVR [84] and systemic inflamma-
tion may be lower [85]. The first large randomized trial of
TAVR versus AVR found no difference in AKI defined as
postoperative SCr > 3.0 mg/dl or initiation of RRT [86].
Treatment
Treatment options for AKI have focused on attenuating
ischemia, reducing intrarenal inflammation, and support-
ive care. Nutrition is an important component of peri-
operative care and should not be neglected. Malnourished
patients with AKI have an increased risk of mortality [87].
Goals to provide 20–30 kcal/kg/day in patients with any
stage of AKI should be met with either parenteral or
enteral feeding [6]. If AKI is severe enough to require
RRT, higher caloric intake via protein supplementation
may be necessary [88]. Glycemic control is also indicated
in patients developing AKI [89]. Maintaining a glucose
concentration ≤ 150 mg/dl is an appropriate target, while
avoiding hypoglycemia (≤80 mg/dl).
In severe AKI, RRT is frequently required to treat
hyperkalemia, remove excess fluid, treat uremia, or reverse
acidosis. Clinical trials of early versus late initiation of
RRT in cardiac surgery patients with severe AKI suggest
early RRT may lower mortality and shorten the ICU
length of stay [90]. In one study, early RRT was associated
with lower mortality (51.5 versus 77.9 %, P = 0.001) and
decreased time on the ventilator (12.8 versus 18.9 days,
P = 0.03) [91]. Studies of dialysis dose, frequency, and
modality (continuous versus intermittent) have also
failed to demonstrate a consistent benefit of one technique
versus another. The undisputed benefit of continuous
versus intermittent RRT is hemodynamic stability, but
otherwise, if a patient meets dialysis criteria (i.e., electro-
lyte abnormality, acidosis, uremic sequelae, or volume
overload), modality does not appear to affect outcomes.
Mesenchymal
stem
cells
(MSCs)
possess
anti-
inflammatory and immunoregulatory characteristics that
promote cell survival and tissue repair, and therefore
present an attractive potential treatment for AKI [92, 93].
Murine models of ischemic AKI have yielded positive
results. Mice that received subcapsular renal injection of
MSCs from human exfoliated deciduous teeth following
ischemia had decreased SCr, blood urea nitrogen, and in-
flammatory cytokine concentrations compared with those
injected with vehicle [94]. A murine study of rhabdo-
myolysis AKI (glycerol injection) showed that human liver
stem cells (HLSCs) decreased creatinine, urea, hyaline cast
formation, and tubular necrosis while enhancing tubular
cell proliferation compared with vehicle [95]. The use of
human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) was also
found to be a potential therapeutic option for AKI because
mice with ischemic AKI benefited from renal subcapsular
transplantation of hiPSCs [96]. A trial investigating the
use of stem cells in cancer patients for the treatment of
cisplatin-induced AKI is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT01275612). Stem cells may provide a future ther-
apy for AKI following cardiac surgery.
Another potential treatment for AKI is alkaline phosphat-
ase [97, 98]. Alkaline phosphatase converts the proinfl-
ammatory adenosine triphosphate into anti-inflammatory
adenosine, and in septic rats attenuated plasma concentra-
tions of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 [99]. A randomized clinical
trial of septic patients found that intravenous administra-
tion of recombinant alkaline phosphatase increased creatin-
ine clearance from 50 ± 27 (mean ± SEM) ml/minute at
baseline to 108 ± 73 ml/minute after treatment in the
alkaline phosphatase group versus from 40 ± 37 to 65 ±
30 ml/minute in the placebo group (P = 0.01), although
this functional benefit did not translate into a decreased
need for RRT [100].
Conclusions
AKI after cardiac surgery is common, although most often
mild. The development of any AKI remains a major
predictor of adverse outcomes, including progression of
CKD. Effective prevention and treatment strategies for
AKI after cardiac surgery may be on the horizon, and the
discovery, validation, and adaptation of biomarkers of
nephron damage may accelerate their development as well

 as shorten the time for diagnosis. For now, efforts to re-
duce AKI following cardiac surgery and its influence on
patient morbidity are confined to hemodynamic manipu-
lations, close attention to intravenous resuscitation strat-
egies including goal-directed therapy and balanced-salt
fluid administration, reduced exposure to CPB, and the
identification and mitigation of modifiable risk factors.
