Abstract
Objective The objective of this study was to pool, har-
monise and re-analyse national accelerometer data from
adults in four European countries in order to describe
population levels of sedentary time and physical inactivity.
Methods Five cross-sectional studies were included from
England,
Portugal,
Norway
and
Sweden.
ActiGraph
accelerometer count data were centrally processed using
the same algorithms. Multivariable logistic regression
analyses were conducted to study the associations of
sedentary time and physical inactivity with sex, age, weight
status and educational level, in both the pooled sample and
the separate study samples.
Results Data from 9509 participants were used. On aver-
age, participants were sedentary for 530 min/day, and
accumulated 36 min/day of moderate to vigorous intensity
physical activity. Twenty-three percent accumulated more
than 10 h of sedentary time/day, and 72% did not meet the
physical activity recommendations. Nine percent of all
participants were classified as high sedentary and low
active. Participants from Norway showed the highest levels
of sedentary time, while participants from England were
the least physically active. Age and weight status were
positively associated with sedentary time and not meeting
the physical activity recommendations. Men and higher-
educated people were more likely to be highly sedentary,
while women and lower-educated people were more likely
to be inactive.
Conclusions We found high levels of sedentary time and
physical inactivity in four European countries. Older peo-
ple and obese people were most likely to display these
behaviours and thus deserve special attention in interven-
tions and policy planning. In order to monitor these
behaviours, accelerometer-based cross-European surveil-
lance is recommended.

 Key Points
Accelerometer data showed high levels of sedentary
time (530 min/day) and physical inactivity (72% did
not meet the physical activity recommendations) in
adults in four European countries.
Older people and overweight and obese people are
more likely to be highly sedentary and less active,
and thus are more at risk for developing certain
chronic diseases.
Men and higher-educated people were more likely to
be highly sedentary, while women and lower-
educated people were more likely to be inactive.
1 Introduction
Sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity are well-
known risk behaviours for many non-communicable dis-
eases. Sedentary behaviour is defined as any waking
behaviour in a sitting or reclining position and a low energy
expenditure [1] and is often operationalised as sedentary
time or sitting time, while physical inactivity is commonly
conceptualised as not meeting the World Health Organi-
zation
(WHO)
physical
activity
recommendations
of
150 min of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity
(MVPA) per week [2]. Both behaviours are associated with
increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
disease, certain types of cancer and premature mortality
[3–6]. While there is a debate as to whether the associa-
tions between sedentary time and health outcomes exist
independently of physical activity levels, physical activity
is known to attenuate the association between sedentary
time and health outcomes [3, 4]. Similarly, a recent study
showed that replacing sitting with activity was associated
with lower mortality more strongly in inactive than active
older adults [7]. These studies show that people who are
both highly sedentary and physically inactive might not
just be most at risk for the development of non-commu-
nicable diseases but might also benefit most from preven-
tive measures.
Within Europe, accurate and comparable data on
sedentary time and physical inactivity levels are needed to
monitor, compare and benchmark these levels within and
across countries, and to target populations at risk. Tradi-
tionally, sedentary time and physical activity levels are
predominantly assessed by self-reported measures such as
questionnaires. However, these measures suffer from lim-
itations such as recall and social desirability bias, limiting
their validity [8, 9]. Recently, Steene-Johannessen and
colleagues [10] demonstrated low agreement for subjective
physical activity data versus objective data when deter-
mining adherence to the physical activity recommendations
in a European sample, and concluded that self-reported
surveillance data should be interpreted with caution. Typ-
ically, physical activity time tends to be overestimated and
sedentary time tends to be underestimated by self-report.
Moreover, in an international context, cultural and lin-
guistic issues in the interpretation of questions or concepts
used may hamper comparability between countries and
cultures. Objective measures, such as accelerometers, are
able to overcome many of these issues and therefore have
the potential to provide more accurate and comparable
estimates of sedentary time and physical inactivity levels
across countries.
Even though there are no cross-European studies that
have used accelerometers in population-based samples to
date, there are a number of national studies in Europe that
have used accelerometers to measure activity behaviour
[11]. Because these studies used different algorithms for
the interpretation of the accelerometer data (e.g. epoch
lengths, non-wear definitions, cut-points for intensity), it is
difficult to compare the results based on the published
articles. However, such a comparison is possible when the
accelerometer count data is harmonised. One of the aims of
the DEterminants of DIet and Physical ACtivity (DED-
IPAC) knowledge hub is to better utilise existing data by
harmonising physical activity and sedentary time surveil-
lance data [12]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
pool, harmonise and re-analyse national accelerometer data
in order to estimate and compare levels of sedentary time
and physical inactivity across Europe, as well as to assess
the associations with several socio-demographic charac-
teristics in order to identify those populations at risk of
health-related outcomes.
2 Methods
Recently, Wijndaele and colleagues [11] published a sys-
tematic literature review reporting on the scope of
accelerometer data in adults. In this review, they identified
four national population-based studies in European coun-
tries that used ActiGraph accelerometers. These studies
were from England [13–15], Norway [16], Portugal [17]
and Sweden (the ABC [Attitude Behaviour Change] study)
[18]. In addition, we included the SNAP (Swedish Neigh-
borhood and Physical Activity) study [19]; even though
this study was not based on data from the entire country, it
did include a large study sample from the Stockholm area.
As this study had similarities with the other studies but was
not population based, it served as a case study, providing
1422

123
 the opportunity to compare data across countries as well as
within Sweden. The principal investigators of the studies
were contacted and agreed to participate. Subsequently,
data-sharing agreements were signed and the accelerometer
count data were transferred to the analysis team.
The characteristics and measurement details of the
included studies are shown in Table 1. Four studies were
conducted between 2006 and 2009; the Swedish ABC
study was conducted in 2001–2002. The size of the anal-
ysed samples ranged from 1114 to 3267 across the studies.
The studies included varying age groups; we included the
age group that was present in the majority of the studies
(20–75 years). The reported response rates ranged from 31
to 68%. All studies used random sampling strategies, but
they recruited participants in different ways, as shown in
Table 1. All studies aimed to include a population-repre-
sentative sample, with the exception of the Swedish SNAP
study. As the primary aim of this study was not population
surveillance, it had additional inclusion criteria around how
long participants lived in their neighbourhood and whether
they were able to walk. All studies used the ActiGraph
GT1M (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA), except for the
Swedish ABC study, which used the ActiGraph 7164. All
measurements were uniaxial on the vertical acceleration
axis. The epoch length varied from 10 to 60 s, which was
harmonised to 60 s. The right hip was the most frequent
wear site, although participants of the Swedish ABC study
wore their accelerometer on the lower back, and partici-
pants of the Swedish SNAP study could choose between
these two wearing positions. All protocols included 7
consecutive days of wear time, except the Portuguese
study, which included a minimum of 4 consecutive days
consisting of 2 week days and both weekend days. All
participants were asked to wear the accelerometer while
they were awake, except during water-based activities (e.g.
showering, swimming).
2.1 Accelerometer Data
We used ActiLife (version 6.12.0; ActiGraph) to convert
DAT-files to AGD-files and reintegrate files to 60 s epoch
length where appropriate. STATA� (version 12.1; STA-
TACorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used for the
wear time validation and intensity classification. We

any

data
points
defined
as
[
20,000 counts/min. Non-wear time was defined as bouts
of C60 min of consecutive zero counts, allowing inter-
ruptions of up to two non-zero counts (B100 counts/min)
[20]. A valid day was defined as a minimum of 600 wear
time min/day and participants needed a minimum of 4
valid days to be included in the analyses; we did not dis-
criminate between week and weekend days. We used the
Troiano cut-points to define sedentary time (
\
100 counts/
min),
and
light-
(100–2019 counts/min),
moderate-
(2020–5998 counts/min) and vigorous-intensity physical
activity (C5999 counts/min) [20]. The number of and time
spent in consecutive sedentary bouts of C30 and C60 min
were calculated. In addition, the number of and time spent
in MVPA bouts of C10 min were calculated, allowing for
up to 2 min below the MVPA threshold [20].
In SPSS� (version 22; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA),
day-to-day data were aggregated to mean values per day
using all valid days. Variables were computed to indicate
whether participants met the physical activity recommen-
dations
of
C150 min
of
MVPA/week
(defined
as
C21.42 min
of
MVPA/mean
day,
not
discriminating
between moderate or vigorous physical activity), based on
the total time in MVPA and time in MVPA bouts of
C10 min. We used these two definitions because several
recommendations, including the WHO recommendations,
state that the activity should occur in bouts of at least
10 min [2], while others, such as the Australian guidelines,
do not include these bouts [21]. Furthermore, participants
were classified according to whether they accumulated
more than 7.5 and 10 h of sedentary time/day. The cut-
point of 7.5 sedentary h/day was based on a meta-analysis
suggesting that the risk for all-cause mortality risk
increases between 7 and 8 h of sedentary time/day [4].
However, because this research was mostly based on self-
reported measures, and sedentary time tends to be under-
reported, we selected an additional cut-point of 10 h based
on validation studies from the Health Survey for England
and the Norwegian study showing that participants on
average reported between 2 and 2.5 h less sedentary time
than accelerometer data [22, 23]. Finally, we classified
participants as being high sedentary/low active if they
accumulated more than 10 h of sedentary time/day and did
not meet the physical activity recommendations based on
total time in MVPA, which is considered the group at
highest risk to develop non-communicable diseases.
2.2 Socio-Demographic Characteristics
In addition to the accelerometer data, four socio-demo-
graphic characteristics were assessed in all studies and
could hence be harmonised: sex, age, weight status based
on body mass index (BMI) and educational level. All
variables were self-reported, except for height and weight
(used to calculate BMI) in the Health Survey for England
and the Portuguese study, which were objectively mea-
sured. We included age in four categories: 20–35, 36–50,
51–66 and 67–75 years. The cut-off of the oldest category
was based on the study sample of the Swedish SNAP study,
since they only included participants up to 66 years old. By
using this cut-off, the oldest category did not comprise any
participants from the Swedish SNAP study. We categorised

\
25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25–30 kg/m2) and obese
(BMI C30 kg/m2) according to WHO guidelines [24].
There was variation in the assessment of educational level.
The Health Survey for England used respondents’ age at
which they finished full-time education, the Portuguese
study used the number of years people attended education,
while the three remaining studies used the level of the
highest completed education (with different classifications
across studies). Since direct mapping of the categories from
these different variables was not possible, we categorised
this variable into quartiles at the study level to provide a
rough estimate of education level.
2.3 Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted in SPSS� (version 22).
Descriptive statistics were used to assess sample charac-
teristics as well as levels of sedentary time and physical
activity. In addition, multivariable logistic regression
analyses were conducted to obtain the odds ratios (ORs)
of (1) sitting more than 7.5 h/day; (2) sitting more than
10 h/day; (3) meeting the physical activity recommenda-
tions based on total time in MVPA; (4) meeting the
physical activity recommendations using MVPA time in
bouts of C10 min; and (5) being classified as high
sedentary/low active. These analyses were conducted on
the total sample and stratified by study sample. The
overall analyses were adjusted for within-study correla-
tions by adding dummy variables for study. Since we only
had a small number of studies, this results in a more valid
estimation of the variance than multilevel analyses. Sex,
age, weight status and level of education were included as
independent variables. In addition, wear time was inclu-
ded as a covariate. Statistical significance was set at
p \ 0.05.
3 Results
We obtained accelerometer data from 12,071 participants,
9509 of which were aged 20–75 years and had [
4 valid
days, and were thus included in analyses. The number of
participants per study ranged from 1059 in the Swedish
ABC study to 3098 in the Norwegian study. Of the par-
ticipants, 56% were female, with a mean age of 48 years
and a mean BMI of 26 kg/m2. When combining the study-
specific quartiles for educational level, 17% of the partic-
ipants belonged to the lowest category, followed by 26, 22
and 35% in the other three categories. All sample charac-
teristics of the total sample and the separate study samples
are shown in Table 2.

 Table 3 summarises the sedentary time and physical
activity outcomes. In general, the accelerometers were
worn for 6–7 days except in Portugal, where the mean
number of valid days was 4.8. Mean wear time was
14.5 h/day. Of the daily wear time, 61% was spent
sedentary and only 2 min on vigorous-intensity physical
activities. Averaging all valid days, participants accumu-
lated a mean of 133 min in 2.8 (median) sedentary bouts of
C30 min, and a mean of 31 min in 0.3 (median) sedentary
bouts
of
C60 min/day.

 16 min/day were spent in 0.6 (median) MVPA bouts of
C10 min. These low numbers for sedentary time and
MVPA are explained by the fact that most participants did
not accumulate C60 min of sedentary time or C10 min of
MVPA on most days. Eighty percent of the participants
were sedentary for more than 7.5 h/day, and almost one-
quarter were sedentary for more than 10 h/day. One-third
of the participants did not meet the physical activity rec-
ommendations based on total time in MVPA, while more
than 70% did not meet the recommendations based on time
in MVPA bouts of C10 min. We also calculated the per-
centage of people meeting the recommendations by
150 min of MVPA/week, 75 min of vigorous-intensity
physical activity (VPA)/week, or an equivalent combina-
tion, which resulted in a 1% increase (results not shown).
Finally, 9% of the participants were classified as low
sedentary/high active. An overview of these outcomes
stratified by sex, age, weight status and educational level is
provided in Electronic Supplementary Material Table S1.
Figure 1 further visualises the country-specific differ-
ences based on the four national population-based studies.
Participants from Norway consistently showed the highest
levels of sedentary time, followed by participants from
England, Sweden and Portugal. Participants from England
showed the highest percentages of not meeting (both)
physical activity recommendations, followed by participants
from Portugal, Sweden and Norway. With regards to the high
sedentary/low active classification, participants from Nor-
way and England showed higher percentages (11%) than
those from Sweden (7%) and Portugal (5%).
The multivariable ORs of accumulating more than 10 h
of sedentary time/day are shown in Table 4 for the total
sample as well as for the separate study samples. In the
total sample, men, people aged 67–75 years, obese people,
and higher-educated people had a significantly higher OR
of sitting more than 10 h/day. The direction of these
associations was the same in the majority of the separate
study samples, with varying levels of significance. Similar
analyses using 7.5 h/day as a cut-point are summarised in
Electronic Supplementary Material Table S2 and showed
reasonably similar results.
Table 5 shows the multivariable ORs of not meeting the
physical activity recommendations based on total time in
MVPA. Women, older people, overweight and obese
people, and lower-educated people showed significantly
higher ORs of not meeting the physical activity recom-
mendations in the total sample. ORs increased with
increasing age and weight status. While the levels of sig-
nificance differed across separate study samples, the
directions
of
association
were
consistent
across
the
majority of the studies. Electronic Supplementary Material
Table S3 shows similar analyses using time spent in MVPA
Fig. 1 Sedentary time and physical inactivity in England, Norway,
Portugal and Sweden. This figure is based on the four national
population-based studies included in this research and shows the
percentage of participants accumulating more than 7.5 and 10 h of
sedentary time/day, the percentage of participants not meeting the
physical activity recommendations based on total time in MVPA and
time in C10 min MVPA bouts, and the percentage of participants
accumulating more than 10 h of sedentary time per day and not
meeting the physical activity recommendation based on total time in
MVPA across the different countries. MVPA moderate to vigorous
physical activity

weight status and educational level, the associations with
sex and age were less clear.
Finally, the ORs of being classified as high sedentary/
low active are shown in Table 6. Men, older people, and
overweight and obese people showed significantly higher
ORs of being high sedentary/low active. No clear pattern
with educational level was observed. These associations
were comparable in the majority of the separate study
samples, with varying levels of significance.
4 Discussion
Our findings indicate that participants on average accumu-
lated 8–9 h of sedentary time/day and that 80% accumulated
at least 7.5 sedentary h/day. These numbers are similar to the
results of the 2005–2006 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) accelerometer study from
the USA [25] that reported a mean of 8 sedentary h/day. The
current estimates are much higher than previous European
studies based on questionnaires, which reported a median of
5 h of sedentary time/day [26–28] and that 20% were
sedentary C7.5 h/day [28, 29]. Interestingly, we found that
approximately 20% of the participants were sedentary
C10 h/day. The largest difference between the most recent
Eurobarometer survey and the current study can be found in
Portugal, with the Eurobarometer reporting 5 h less seden-
tary time (180 min/day) than the present objective assess-
ments of 485 min/day [28].
With regard to physical activity, participants accumu-
lated a mean of 36 min of MVPA/day; however, 32% did
not
meet
the
physical
activity
recommendations
of
C150 min/week based on total time in MVPA. This latter
finding is similar to a study by Hallal and colleagues [30],
which relied on self-report questionnaires and concluded
that 35% of European adults did not meet the physical
activity recommendations defined as C30 min of MVPA
on 5 days/week, C20 min of VPA on 3 days/week or an
equivalent combination. However, when we calculated
these percentages based on the time in MVPA bouts of
C10 min, as is currently recommended by the WHO [2],
over 70% of the participants did not meet the physical
activity recommendations. Even though this is a substantial
difference, these numbers are still lower than the percent-
ages reported in the 2003–2004 NHANES accelerometer
study from the USA, which reported that approximately
97% of the participants did not meet the physical activity
recommendations
when
taking
into
account
similar
C10 min MVPA bouts [20]. It should be noted, however,
that they defined this as accumulating C30 min of MVPA
on 5 days/week, which is slightly different from our defi-
nition of C150 min of MVPA/week.
These findings support the notion that prevalence data
based on subjective measures substantially underestimates
sedentary time and overestimates physical activity. The
interpretation of these findings is somewhat difficult, as the
physical activity recommendations are largely based on
self-reported studies using questionnaires when examining
associations between activity and health-related outcomes.
This might mean that the questionnaire-induced overesti-
mation of physical activity levels is already taken into
account in the recommendations and that the recommen-
dations may change based on future large-scale longitudi-
nal studies using objective measurements related to health-
related outcomes. Although there are no specific public
health recommendations regarding sedentary time, most
epidemiological evidence regarding the health risks of
sedentary behaviours is also based on self-reported data.
Hence, the translation of accelerometer-based surveillance
data with regard to public health risks is not straightfor-
ward. However, to date, few studies have been performed
on the association between objectively measured physical
activity and/or sedentary time and clinical health-related
outcomes.
Of the population-based studies included in our analy-
ses, Norway had the highest levels of sedentary time and
the lowest percentage of not meeting physical activity
recommendations, which further emphasises that these
behaviours are not the inverse of each other and may
coexist. England was the least physically active country,
and both England and Norway showed relatively high
percentages of people being high sedentary/low active. The
relative order of the countries in our pooled analysis is
roughly the same as in previous research, with Norway and
Sweden generally more sedentary but also more physically
active than England and Portugal [26, 28, 30, 31]. Even
though our study included northern and southern European
countries, the limited amount and geographical dispersion
of included countries calls for more research to assess the
wider distribution of sedentary time and physical activity
across Europe.
The Swedish SNAP study showed substantially lower
levels of physical inactivity and higher levels of sedentary
time than the Swedish ABC study. The ABC study was set
up as a population-based surveillance study for Sweden,
while the SNAP study was not designed or primarily aimed
at population surveillance but rather to study environ-
mental correlates in the Stockholm metropolitan area.
When looking at the characteristics of the two Swedish
study samples, the SNAP study has a larger proportion of
higher-educated people. Based on our findings that higher-
educated people are more sedentary and less physically
inactive, it might be that the SNAP study overestimated the
levels of sedentary time and underestimated the levels of
physical inactivity in Sweden. Having said that, the ABC

 study was conducted earlier (in 2001–2002), using an older
model accelerometer (ActiGraph 7164) and had a different
wear site (the lower back), while the SNAP study was more
comparable to the other studies in this respect. However, a
sub-sample of the ABC study were followed-up in
2007–2008 (500 participants) and although sedentary time
had increased by half an hour per day, the overall results
were similar [32]. Even though studies have shown that
there are no significant differences between accelerometer
placement on the hip or lower back [33], there is some
discussion about the comparability of the results of the two
ActiGraph models [34–36]. In conclusion, the marked
difference between the two studies illustrates the impor-
tance of using an appropriate study sample for accurate
population surveillance of sedentary time and physical
activity.
Being in the highest age group (67–75 years) and being
obese was consistently associated with more sedentary
time, less physical activity and being classified as high
sedentary/low active. The strength of the association
increased with increasing age and weight status for not
meeting the physical activity recommendations and being
classified as high sedentary/low active (although not for
being sedentary for more than 10 h/day). These findings
are in line with previous findings reported in reviews of the
correlates of sedentary behaviour [37] and physical activity
[38] and indicate that populations that are older and have a
higher BMI need special attention in interventions and
policies aiming to improve these lifestyle behaviours. It
should be noted, however, that the relative intensity of
activities is different for older adults, with research
showing cut-points around \
22 counts/min for sedentary
behaviour [39] and C1040 counts/min for MVPA [40].
This means that we might have overestimated sedentary
time and physical inactivity in this group using the regular
cut-points (of \
100 and C2020 counts/min, respectively).
Men and higher-educated people were more likely to be
highly sedentary, but also more likely to meet the physical
activity recommendations. This is in line with previous
research reported in systematic reviews [37, 38]. Instead of
sedentary time and moderate-intensity activities, women
accumulated more time in light-intensity physical activities
than men. Higher-educated people might be more likely to
have a desk job, and hence accumulate a lot of sedentary
time/day, while they might also be more inclined to exer-
cise and therefore are more likely to meet the physical
activity recommendations. Men were more likely to be
classified as high sedentary/low active than women, while
education did not show a clear association with this clas-
sification. It should be noted, however, that we have used a
crude way of categorising education, since it was difficult
to harmonise between studies. Overall, public health efforts
aiming to enhance these lifestyle behaviours should pay
special attention to increasing physical activity in women
and lower-educated people, and to decreasing sedentary
time in men and higher-educated people. In men, specifi-
cally, extra attention could be given to decrease the com-
bination of high sedentary time and low physical activity.
Across all studies, 8.5% of the participants were clas-
sified as high sedentary/low active because they accumu-
lated more than 10 h of sedentary time/day and did not
meet the physical activity recommendations based on total
time in MVPA. As this phenomenon has not been studied
extensively before, and the prevalence numbers are highly
dependent on the way the variable is defined, it is difficult
to draw comparisons with other studies. However, as these
people might be most at risk for adverse health outcomes,
more research targeting this group is warranted.
In order to assess the added value of pooled analyses, we
compared the ranking of the countries based on the original
country-specific articles with the ranking based on our
pooled results. For MVPA min/day, the order of most
active countries based on the original articles was (1)
Norway, (2) Sweden, (3) England and (4) Portugal, while
this was (1) Norway, (2) Portugal, (3) Sweden and (4)
England based on our analysis. For sedentary min/day, the
ranking was (1) England, (2) Portugal, (3) Norway and (4)
Sweden based on the original articles, while this was (1)
Norway, (2) England, (3) Sweden and (4) Portugal based
on the pooled data. This was the case for the total sample as
well as for the stratified samples by sex. These differences
are caused by methodological differences across the orig-
inal studies (e.g. non-wear definitions, intensity cut-points)
and illustrate the importance of harmonisation and stan-
dardisation. Even though studies seem reasonably similar
at
first
glance,
small
but
significant
differences
in
methodology may cause large differences in results and
consequently the conclusions. This can only be solved by a
priori universal standardisation or post-priori pooling,
harmonising and re-analysing the accelerometer count data,
applying the exact same algorithms to all data involved.
4.1 Strengths and Limitations
This study is the first to combine population-based
accelerometer data from all four European countries that
have collected such data in adults. The main strength of
this study is that accelerometer count data were centrally
pooled, harmonised and re-analysed, using identical defi-
nitions for the interpretation of the accelerometer data (e.g.
epoch lengths, cut-points) across studies.
A limitation of this study is the possible differences in
sampling methodology across studies. Even though four of
the studies were set up as national population-based stud-
ies, it is unclear how representative the studies really are of
the population of their country. The reported response rate
1432
A. Loyen et al.
123
 of the different studies ranges from 31 to 68%. Even
though the underlying calculations might be different, this
may suggest selection bias. This is further suggested by
some of the sample characteristics, e.g. 63% of the Por-
tuguese participants were female. This might mean that the
study populations may differ in terms of socio-demo-
graphic characteristics, and possibly also physical activity
and sedentary time levels, which might have influenced the
results and hampers the comparability across studies.
Weighting data towards the population distribution for key
characteristics such as age, sex and educational level would
partly solve this problem. However, the majority of the
included studies did not have such a weighting system.
More importantly, such a system would still not adjust for
selection bias caused by fewer or more sedentary/active
individuals agreeing to take part in the study. Guidelines on
how to deal with such differences between study samples
in population-based studies would be useful in interna-
tional population surveillance, especially when the data are
pooled.
In addition, differences between studies with regard to the
data collection could have influenced the results and might
partly explain the observed differences between countries in
the current analysis. For example, the Swedish ABC study
was conducted in 2001–2002, while the other data were
collected between 2006 and 2009. In addition, the Por-
tuguese participants were asked to wear the accelerometer
for at least 4 days, including at least 2 weekend days, but
were encouraged to wear it longer. The other studies all
asked their participants to wear the accelerometer for at least
7 days. These different strategies have resulted in a different
number of valid days (with Portugal having approximately
2 days less) and might have led to an over-representation of
weekend days in the Portuguese data.
Moreover, we found that several socio-demographic
characteristics were difficult to harmonise across studies,
which is illustrated by the crude harmonisation of the
educational level of the participants, and the inability to
harmonise any other characteristics in addition to sex, age,
weight status and education. In addition, since some of the
studies used 60 s epochs in their data collection, we were
forced to apply this setting to all data files. This meant that
we lost detail of the data at the expense of comparability.
Finally, a known limitation of accelerometers is their
inability to capture certain movements, especially those
without a strong vertical component, such as cycling. Since
we also know there are cultural differences in activity
behaviours across countries/regions in Europe, this might
mean that some of the observed differences might be partly
explained by these limitations of the accelerometers.
Overall, while the pooling of existing accelerometer
data has substantial advantages over comparing self-
reported data from different countries, there are still some
limitations. These could be overcome by further stan-
dardisation in data collection and interpretation across
countries or by installing a cross-European surveillance
system, using the same standardised protocol across
countries. A recently published expert consensus provides
an overview of the strategies and utilities needed to enable
cross-country comparison of accelerometer data, both for
historical and future data collection [11].
4.2 Future Recommendations
The results of this study demonstrate the utility of objective
measures in sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity pop-
ulation surveillance and research. Setting up a cross-European
accelerometer-based surveillance system using standardised
protocols for data collection in all involved countries simul-
taneously would enable more insight into the prevalence,
diversity and correlates of sedentary behaviour and physical
inactivity across Europe. Assessing a wide variety of possible
correlates of sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity
would provide a better notion of the individuals and groups at
risk, which could then be targeted in public health strategies, as
well as the opportunity to investigate the differences across
countries in-depth. The major challenge for accelerometer-
based surveillance is budget, as using accelerometers is more
costly than using questionnaires. In particular, cross-country
efforts are challenging to fund (and organise); however, they
have clear additional benefits over national surveillance when
it comes to comparability of the data.
5 Conclusions
This study shows high levels of sedentary time and phys-
ical inactivity across European adults. Participants from
Norway were the most sedentary, whereas participants
from England were the most inactive. In general, inter-
ventions and policies aiming to improve these lifestyle
behaviours should pay special attention to older people and
people with overweight or obesity, who are more likely to
be sedentary and physically inactive. Additionally, sex and
socio-economic differences should be taken into account as
men and highly educated people tend to be more active but
also more sedentary than women and people with lower
levels of education, respectively. As people who are clas-
sified as high sedentary/low active might be most at risk of
the associated non-communicable diseases, this combina-
tion of behaviours deserves specific attention in both
research as well as in intervention and policy actions. It is
recommended that these behaviours be monitored across
Europe using an accelerometer-based surveillance system.
