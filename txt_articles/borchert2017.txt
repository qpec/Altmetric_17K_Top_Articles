ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is characterized by an acute left ventricular dysfunction and is associated
with life-threating complications in the acute phase. The underlying disease mechanism in TTS is still unknown. A genetic
basis has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVES The aims of the study were to establish an in vitro induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model of TTS, to
test the hypothesis of altered b-adrenergic signaling in TTS iPSC-cardiomyocytes (CMs), and to explore whether genetic
susceptibility underlies the pathophysiology of TTS.
METHODS Somatic cells of patients with TTS and control subjects were reprogrammed to iPSCs and differentiated
into CMs. Three-month-old CMs were subjected to catecholamine stimulation to simulate neurohumoral overstimulation.
We investigated b-adrenergic signaling and TTS cardiomyocyte function.
RESULTS Enhanced b-adrenergic signaling in TTS-iPSC-CMs under catecholamine-induced stress increased expression
of the cardiac stress marker NR4A1; cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels; and cyclic adenosine monophosphate–
dependent protein kinase A–mediated hyperphosphorylation of RYR2-S2808, PLN-S16, TNI-S23/24, and Cav1.2-S1928,
and leads to a reduced calcium time to transient 50% decay. These cellular catecholamine-dependent responses were
mainly mediated by b1-adrenoceptor signaling in TTS. Engineered heart muscles from TTS-iPSC-CMs showed an
impaired force of contraction and a higher sensitivity to isoprenaline-stimulated inotropy compared with control
subjects. In addition, altered electrical activity and increased lipid accumulation were detected in catecholamine-treated
TTS-iPSC-CMs, and were confirmed by differentially expressed lipid transporters CD36 and CPT1C. Furthermore, we
uncovered genetic variants in different key regulators of cardiac function.
CONCLUSIONS Enhanced b-adrenergic signaling and higher sensitivity to catecholamine-induced toxicity
were identified as mechanisms associated with the TTS phenotype. (International Takotsubo Registry [InterTAK

 T
akotsubo
syndrome
(TTS)
is
an
increasingly diagnosed disease with
symptoms similar to acute myocar-
dial infarction, including clinical symptoms,
electrocardiogram
changes,
and
cardiac
biomarkers,
usually
in
the
absence
of
obstructive coronary artery stenosis (1,2).
The
syndrome
is
often
triggered
by
emotional or physical stressors (3,4). TTS is
life-threatening, with 22% of patients experi-
encing
serious
in-hospital
complications,
such as ventricular tachycardia, cardiogenic
shock, or death (2). Even long-term follow-
up is not completely benign, as the rate of
recurrence in TTS is 2%, and the major
adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event
rate is 10% per patient-year (2).
Several hypotheses have been proposed to
describe the pathomechanisms (5,6); how-
ever, the exact mechanism leading to TTS is
still
under
debate.
Detailed
mechanistic
studies are difficult to perform due to the
lack of a reliable TTS model that translates to
humans. Adrenergic overstimulation seems
to play an important role in TTS, and it has
been suggested that heart function can be
damaged by excessive catecholamine release
(7). This indicates that a normally protective
mechanism
might
fail
in
these
subjects.
Several familial cases of TTS have been described in
published reports (8), although it is unclear to date
whether this disease has a genetic component. Small
studies
in
individual
patients
have
reported
an
association between TTS and several genes, including
Bcl-2–associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) (9).
A big hurdle in understanding the molecular and
cellular physiology of TTS has been the lack of human
cardiomyocyte (CM) culture models from patients
with TTS. The availability of methods to generate
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and to direct
their differentiation toward a CM phenotype over-
comes this hurdle by enabling the creation of patient-
specific TTS disease models. iPSC-CMs have been
especially widely used to study hereditary cardiac
conditions in vitro, including arrhythmic disorders or
cardiomyopathies, with a robust correlation to pre-
dicted phenotypes (10). A genetic predisposition,
although suggested (8), is less well established for
TTS. We tested the hypothesis that TTS-iPSC-CMs
phenocopy the disease in the dish, and thus allow
for mechanistic studies to facilitate the development
of novel therapeutic and protective strategies in pa-
tients with TTS.
METHODS
Details are available in the Online Appendix.
PATIENTS. Patients with TTS (not related to each
other) presented here have been selected from the
International Takotsubo Registry (NCT01947621) and
fulfilled the Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria for TTS
(Online Table 1) (11). A total of 4 healthy donors were
used as control subjects in this study (Online Table 1).
One healthy control subject (control 1) is a 52-year-old
postmenopausal
woman.
Two
further
control
subjects are 25-year-old women (controls 2 and 3).
One anonymous healthy woman control subject (FB2)
was characterized and described in our previous
study (12).
REPROGRAMMING OF SOMATIC CELLS INTO iPSCs.
Fibroblasts (TTS patients 1, 2, 5 and 8; controls 2 and 3)
or peripheral blood cells (control 1) were reprog-
rammed using nonintegrating systems, and high-
quality iPSC clones were expanded. Cell lines were
named 1-TTS-1, 1-TTS-2, 2-TTS-1, 5-TTS-1, 5-TTS-2,
8-TTS-1, and 8-TTS-2 from TTS patients 1, 2, 5, and 8;
and 1-C-1, 1-C-2, 2-C-1, 2-C-2, 3-C-1, and 3-C-2 for cell
lines from healthy controls 1, 2, and 3 (Online Table 2).

RESULTS
iPSCs GENERATED FROM PATIENTS WITH TTS SHOW
PLURIPOTENT
CHARACTERISTICS
AND
CAN
BE
DIFFERENTIATED INTO FUNCTIONAL CMs. The iPSC
lines generated for this study showed typical human
pluripotent stem cell characteristics (Online Figure 1).
No
differences
in
differentiation
efficiency
were
observed between control and TTS-iPSCs. Using a
directed
differentiation
protocol,
we
achieved
a
cardiomyocyte purity of >85% at culture day 60
(determined by flow cytometry analysis for cardiac
troponin T [cTNT]) (Figure 1A). The CM cultures
derived from both control- and TTS-iPSCs expressed
high levels of cardiac-specific genes, such as a-actinin
(ACTN2), a-myosin heavy chain (a-MHC), b-myosin
heavy
chain
(ß-MHC),
and
cTNT
at
the
mRNA
level, and show a-actinin–, and cTNT-positive sarco-
meric structural features (Figures 1B and 1C, Online
Video 1).
BRIEF CATECHOLAMINE TREATMENT AS AN INDUCER OF
STRESS. Exposure to high levels of catecholamines
has been implicated in TTS (7). We therefore aimed to
induce a TTS-related phenotype in iPSC-CMs after
exposure
to
catecholamines
(Iso
[100
nmol/l
to
5 mmol/l], and Epi [100 nmol/l to 500 mmol/l]), as
described previously (6,7). These experimental con-
ditions did not result in an irregular sarcomeric
structure (Figure 1C) or apoptosis as analyzed by
annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometric
assay (Figure 1D). We then analyzed the expression of
cardiac stress–related genes in iPSC-CMs, including
NR4A1,
by
quantitative
PCR.
NR4A1
is
strongly
increased for all tested concentrations of Iso and Epi
in both TTS-iPSC-CMs (16- to 19-fold for Iso; 13- to
30-fold for Epi) and control-iPSC-CMs (10- to 8-fold
for Iso; 13- to 27-fold for Epi) (Figure 1E). After Iso
stimulation,
NR4A1
expression
was
significantly
greater in TTS-iPSC-CMs than in control-iPSC-CMs.
These changes in NR4A1 expression were reversed
after
a
3-week
catecholamine
washout
period
(Figure 1E, Epi rec).
EFFECTS OF CATECHOLAMINES ON b-ADRENERGIC
SIGNALING. b-ARs activate the Gs/adenylate cyclase
(ADCY) cascade, generating the second messenger
cAMP. To analyze the activation of this pathway, we
measured cAMP levels, PKA activity, and electrical
activity in iPSC-CMs from TTS and control subjects.
cAMP dynamics were measured by transduction of
iPSC-CMs with an adenoviral construct expressing the
Förster
resonance
energy
transfer
(FRET)–based
cAMP sensor Epac1-camps under the control of the
cytomegalovirus
promoter
(15).
Control
iPSC-CMs
reacted to the b-AR agonist Iso (100 nmol/l), which
demonstrated a clear increase in the cyan fluorescent
protein (CFP)/yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) ratio
and cytoplasmic cAMP levels (Figures 2A and 2C).
There was no additional effect at greater Iso levels
(1.18-fold increase at 1 mmol/l Iso) (Figures 2A and 2C).
In
contrast,
TTS
CMs
reacted
to
higher
Iso
concentrations of 1 mmol/l (1.55-fold; p ¼ 0.0621) and
1 mmol/l (1.98; p ¼ 0.0029) with a further significant
increase in the CFP/YFP ratio, and therefore higher
cytoplasmic cAMP levels in TTS-CMs relative to con-
trol iPSC-CMs (Figures 2B and 2C). This suggests a
higher catecholamine-dependent dynamic range in
TTS-iPSC-CMs. As cAMP can be synthesized at low
rates under basal conditions, we pretreated the iPSC-
CMs with the unselective phosphodiesterase (PDE)
inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin (IBMX) in the
absence of Iso. Under these experimental conditions,
we
detected
no
significant
difference
in
FRET
response
in
control
and
TTS-iPSC-CMs
(Online
Figures 2A to 2C). This suggests similar basal cyto-
plasmic cAMP levels in iPSC-CMs of patients with TTS
compared to control subjects.
To further investigate b-adrenergic signaling in
TTS-iPSC-CMs, we analyzed the activation of PKA by
phosphorylation of its target sites RYR2-2808, PLN-
S16, TNI-S23/24, and Cav1.2-S1928. Western blots of
Iso- and Epi-treated iPSC-CMs showed significantly
greater phosphorylation of PLN-S16, RYR2-S2808,
and Cav1.2-S1928 in TTS-iPSC-CMs after catechol-
amine
treatment
(Figures
2D
to
2G).
TNI-S23/24
exhibited a trend toward enhanced phosphorylation

 in TTS compared with control iPSC-CMs (Figure 2H).
Importantly, we found a significant 5.7-fold increase
of
PLN-S16
phosphorylation
at
a
basal
level
without catecholamine treatment in TTS-iPSC-CMs
(Figure 2E, Online Figures 2D and 2E). An additional
Iso treatment resulted in a 13- (100 nmol/l) or 14-fold
(5 mmol/l) greater absolute phosphorylation in TTS
compared with control subjects (Figures 2D and 2E).
After normalization, we found no significant differ-
ences in phosphorylation between TTS and control
subjects (Online Figure 3C). PKA-specific RYR2-S2808
showed a 3.3- to 6.4-fold greater phosphorylation and
Cav1.2-S1928 showed a 3.3- to 3.7-fold greater phos-
phorylation after Iso treatment (100 nmol/l, 5 mmol/l)
compared with untreated cells from patients with
TTS. In contrast, the phosphorylation of control-iPSC-
CMs was only increased 1.2- to 3.0-fold for RYR2, and
1.5- to 1.6-fold for Cav1.2 under the same conditions
(Figures 2F and 2G). The extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (ERK), involved in cardiac structural remod-
eling and known to be activated by b-AR–dependent
phosphorylation,
was
maximally
phosphorylated
in TTS after treatment with 100 nmol/l Iso or Epi.
In
contrast,
control
iPSC-CMs
had
reduced
ERK
phosphorylation
compared
with
TTS
iPSC-CMs
(Figure 2D).
Similar results were obtained after Epi treatment of
iPSC-CMs (Online Figures 3A, 3B, 3D, and 3E). We also
quantified
the
basal
protein
expression
of
key
downstream targets of b-AR signaling and calcium-
handling proteins, and detected decreased expres-
sion of total PLN (Online Figure 2E). RYR2, TNI,
phosphorylation
of
RYR2-S2808,
and
TNI-S23/24
(b-AR downstream partners) all showed no signifi-
cant differences in protein expression, but exhibited
a
decreasing
trend
in
unstressed
TTS-iPSC-CMs
toward levels detected in control-iPSC-CMs. The key
calcium-handling proteins sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic
reticulum calcium ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and sodium-
calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) were similarly expressed
under basal conditions in control- and TTS-iPSC-CMs
(Online Figure 2E). Furthermore, expression of these
proteins was not altered after catecholamine treat-
ment in TTS- and control-iPSC-CMs (Figure 2D).
ALTERED ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY OF CATECHOLAMINE-
TREATED
iPSC-CMs
FROM
PATIENTS
WITH
TTS. As
cAMP was shown to regulate chronotropic, inotropic,
and lusitropic effects in the mammalian heart (16), we
sought to analyze the effects of altered b-adrenergic
signaling
in
the
bioelectrical
features
of
catecholamine-treated TTS-iPSC-CMs using the MEA
system. In more than one-half of the analyzed TTS-
iPSC-CMs, electrical activity was completely silenced
at different Iso concentrations, which was observed
in only a few control-iPSC-CMs under the same
conditions (Figure 2I, Online Figure 4). However,
unsilenced
TTS-iPSC-CMs
showed
a
significantly
increased
beating
frequency
in
comparison
with
control-iPSC-CMs at 1 mmol/l Iso (3.3 � 0.3 vs. 2 � 0.3;
n ¼ 7 for TTS and 8 for control; p ¼ 0.002) and 10
mmol/l Iso (3.3 � 0.2 vs. 2.3 � 0.3; n ¼ 7 for TTS and 8
for control; p ¼ 0.04) (Figure 2J), whereas there were
no differences in basal beating frequencies between
TTS and control subjects (Online Figure 4B). Of note,
the
beating
frequency
in
control
and
TTS-CMs
was suppressed when Iso concentrations exceeded
10
and
1 mmol/l,
respectively
(Figure
2J).
These
changes
in
electrical
activity
were
completely
reversible upon washout of Iso after 24 h (Online
Figure 4).
ALTERED FUNCTIONALITY OF CALCIUM HOMEOSTASIS
AND FORCE DEVELOPMENT IN PATIENTS WITH TTS. Due
to Iso-dependent alterations in cAMP levels, PKA
activity, and electrical activity in TTS, we sought to
investigate
calcium
kinetics
in
iPSC-CMs.

 detected a significantly lower T50 in TTS-iPSC-CMs
compared with control subjects in the absence (T50:
883.6 � 30.3 ms vs. 1,018.3 � 35.6 ms; adjusted
p ¼ 0.006) and presence of Iso stimulation (at
100 nmol/l and 1 mmol/l Iso) (Figure 3A). Of note, in
TTS, lower Iso concentrations (100 nmol/l) were
sufficient to significantly reduce T50 compared with
control
subjects
(1
mmol/l)
(Online
Figure
5B,
Figure 4D, blue bars). Furthermore, we found an
increase in the amplitude of calcium transients (Ca2þ
I)
in the TTS-iPSC-CMs compared with control subjects
in unstimulated cells (6.4 � 0.3 Ca2þ
I vs. 5.1 � 0.2
Ca2þ
I; adjusted p ¼ 0.0007) and under Iso stimulation
of 100 nmol/l (Online Figure 5D).
Engineered heart muscle (EHM) from TTS-iPSC-
CMs (Online Video 2) showed an impaired absolute
force of contraction in comparison with control EHMs
(Figure 3B). In line with the calcium kinetics of single
cardiomyocytes
(Figure
3A),
we
observed
faster
relaxation times in TTS EHMs under baseline condi-
tions and in the presence of 1 mmol/l Iso compared
with control subjects (Online Figure 6A). Further-
more, we found higher sensitivity to adrenergic
stimulation in TTS EHMs (Iso half-maximal effective
concentration [EC50]: 6 � 1 nmol/l vs. 13 � 2 nmol/l;
n ¼ 10 for TTS and 11 for control; p < 0.05), which was
efficiently antagonized by the combination of the b-
AR-inhibitors ICI (b2-selective antagonist) and CGP
(b1-selective antagonist) (Figure 3C). Interestingly, not
only was the sensitivity to acute Iso stimulation
increased
in
TTS
compared
with
control
EHMs
(Figure 3C), but chronic Iso stimulation for 24 h also
resulted in significant differences between TTS and
control EHMs. In line with the acute monolayer CM
data (Figure 2J), we observed a greater change in
beating frequency after 24 h Iso in TTS compared with
control (222 � 32% vs. 59 � 19%; n ¼ 7 for TTS and
5 for control; p < 0.05) (Figure 3D, Online Figure 6B).
Furthermore, 24-h chronic stimulation resulted in a
right shift of the acute Iso concentration curve,
indicating
rapid
catecholamine
desensitization
in
EHM. However, this shift was less pronounced in TTS
EHMs in comparison with control EHMs (Iso EC50:
19 � 4 nmol/l vs. 64 � 10 nmol/l; n ¼ 7 for TTS and 5
for control; p < 0.05) (Figures 3C and 3E), indicating a
lower degree of catecholamine desensitization in
TTS-EHMs.
SELECTIVE b-ADRENERGIC SIGNALING IN TTS-iPSC-CMs.
To further assess the contribution of specific b-AR
subtypes in TTS-iPSC-CM signaling, cells were treated
with ICI (b2-antagonist), CGP (b1-antagonist), or both.
We examined cAMP generation; PKA activity by
assessing the phosphorylation of RYR2, PLN, TNI, and
Cav1.2; calcium fluctuation; and beating frequency by
MEA measurements for antagonist-specific effects in
TTS-iPSC-CMs. We found that b-AR activity was
mediated by both b1- and b2-ARs in TTS-iPSC-CMs, as
demonstrated by a significantly increased b1-AR– and
b2-AR–mediated
cAMP
(ICI
or
CGP)

Furthermore,

Only PKA-dependent phosphorylation of TNI was

 MEA data showing Iso-dependent rising frequencies
after ICI or CGP treatment in TTS, similar to cells
without inhibitor (Figure 4C). In contrast, in control
cells, the vast majority of Iso-dependent b-AR activity
(cAMP generation, PKA-promoted phosphorylation of
TNI and Cav1.2, and an Iso-dependent increase in
beating
rate)
was
mediated
by
b2-ARs
(CGP)
(Figures 4A to 4C, Online Figures 7F and 8). Of note,
the Iso-dependent reduction of calcium T50 is mainly
mediated by b1-ARs in TTS, whereas b2-ARs are the
main contributors in control iPSC-CMs (Figure 4D).
Taken together, TTS-specific effects of antagonists
were mainly mediated by b1-ARs, but our findings
indicate that b2-ARs are involved as well.
Simultaneous inhibition of both b-AR subtypes
(ICI þ CGP) suppressed FRET changes, T50-changes
(up to 1 mmol/l Iso in TTS), beating rate (up to 1 mmol/l
Iso in TTS and control subjects), and PKA-specific
phosphorylation,
indicating
that
catecholamine-
induced changes are mediated by b1-AR, b2-AR, or
their combined activity. Notably, ICI treatment in the
absence of Iso produced inverse agonism in TTS,
shown by significantly enhanced T50 and decreasing
beating rate below baseline (Online Figures 7A to 7C).
INCREASED
LIPID
ACCUMULATION
AND
DECREASED
MITOCHONDRIAL AREA IN PATIENTS WITH TTS AFTER
CATECHOLAMINE TREATMENT. Adrenergic stimulation
results in positive inotropic and chronotropic effects
of the heart and regulates lipid metabolism through
the PKA pathway and NR4A1 (6,17). Therefore, we
analyzed cardiac lipids by Oil Red O staining in
catecholamine-treated
iPSC-CMs.
We
observed
a
dose-dependent increase in lipid droplets in TTS-
iPSC-CMs, but not in control cells (Figures 5A and 5B).
The overall lipid droplet accumulation was highest in
Epi-treated iPSC-CMs from patients with TTS (5.0- to
5.7-fold) compared with untreated iPSC-CMs. Based on
these data, we analyzed the different lipid trans-
porters and found significantly increased expression
of the lipid importer CD36 in TTS-iPSC-CMs under
basal
conditions
(6.1-fold)
and
upon
treatment
with 500 mmol/l Epi (7.1-fold) compared with control
iPSC-CMs (Figure 5C). Furthermore, CD36 showed a
slight increase (1.7- and 1.6-fold) in expression in
control iPSC-CMs after Epi stimulation (100 nmol/l and
500 mmol/l) compared with unstimulated conditions
(Figure 5C). In addition, the lipid translocator CPT1C
was expressed at significantly lower levels in TTS-
iPSC-CMs
compared
with
control
iPSC-CMs
after
catecholamine treatment (Figure 5D). Because mito-
chondrial disorders have been described as potential
causes for lipid accumulation and cardiomyopathies,
we
characterized
changes
in
the
mitochondrial
network during catecholamine-induced stress in iPSC-
CMs. Cells were treated with Iso (100 nmol/l and
5 mmol/l) and costained with the mitochondrial-
specific
probe
MitoSpy
Orange
(BioLegend,
San
Diego, California) and the sarcomeric protein a-actinin
(Figure 5F). Confocal microscopy showed that control
cells treated with high Iso dosages showed a significant
decrease in mitochondrial area, but a regular a-acti-
nin–positive sarcomeric structure (Figures 5E and 5F).
In contrast, iPSC-CMs of patients with TTS already
revealed a significantly decreased mitochondrial area
at basal conditions without Iso treatment (Figures 5E
and 5F).

 the limited patient number prevents a significant as-
sociation of novel gene(s) with a genetically complex
disorder, we focused our WES data analysis on 81
genes previously associated with genetic forms of
cardiomyopathies and cardiac
arrhythmias. Using
specific filter criteria, we identified the following
candidate variants. Patient 2-TTS carried the hetero-
zygous c.1040A>G variant in RNA binding motif
protein 20 (RBM20) predicted to substitute the highly
conserved
tyrosine
at
position
347
by
cytosine
(p.Y347C). This variant is not found in over 121,000
alleles in the ExAC database, excluding that this
variant represents a single-nucleotide polymorphism
common in the general population. Another hetero-
zygous variant, c.1139G>A (p.R380H), was found in
dolichol kinase (DOLK; present in 5 of >121,000 in the
ExAC database), but was predicted as benign. Patient
5-TTS was found to carry the heterozygous rare
variant c.567C>G (p.F189L) in the calsequestrin 2
(CASQ2) gene (present in 84 of >121,000 in the ExAC
database) that was predicted to be deleterious or
damaging. No likely candidate variant was found
in
the
other
2
patients.
All
candidate
variants
were
confirmed
by
Sanger
sequencing
(Online
Figure 9). This finding of variants in genes encoding
important cardiac proteins associated with cardiac
pathologies may underlie the hypothesis of a pre-
disposition to TTS, but also suggests a number of
unrelated
mechanisms
underlying
the
observed
phenotypes.
DISCUSSION
Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility
of a human in vitro TTS model by using iPSC-CMs,
and we provide evidence that catecholamine-treated
TTS-specific
iPSC-CMs
mimic
features
consistent
with those found in individuals with TTS. Notably, we
found that: 1) sudden stress can be induced in
iPSC-CMs by short-term catecholamine exposure; 2)
b-adrenergic signaling, including cAMP response and
cAMP-dependent
PKA
activity,
is
increased
in
TTS-iPSC-CMs after treatment with high levels of
catecholamines; 3) b-AR activity is mediated by both
b1- and b2-ARs in TTS-iPSC-CMs; 4) the active force
of
contraction
is
reduced
and
sensitivity
to
isoprenaline-stimulated
inotropy
is
enhanced
in
TTS-EHMs; and 5) electrical activity and lipid accu-
mulation is altered in TTS-iPSC-CMs. In conjunction
with the identified genetic variants of several key
regulators of cardiac function, our findings suggest a
genetic predisposition in TTS. Therefore, iPSC-CMs
can overcome the limitations of artificial animal or
in vitro TTS models.
The hormone receptor NR4A1 plays a crucial role
in cardiovascular diseases and, as such, is markedly
expressed in the human heart and in neonatal rat
cardiomyocytes after b-adrenergic stimulation, with
a proposed protective role in b-AR–induced cardiac
remodeling and hypertrophy (18,19). Thus, in our
study, we found mRNA expression to be highly
up-regulated after exposure to catecholamines in all
iPSC-CMs, with a significant increase in patients
with TTS under Iso compared with control subjects
(Figure 1E). b-AR inhibition resulted in clear reduc-
tion of NR4A1 protein (Online Figure 8), confirming
the dependence of NR4A1 expression on b-AR ac-
tivity. In addition, it is known that NR4A1 regulates
lipid metabolism in muscle cells via modulation of
the expression of lipid transporter proteins, such as
CD36 (17), which we found to be expressed at higher
abundance in TTS (Figure 5C). These data argue for
NR4A1-dependent
crosstalk
between
the
b-AR
signaling and lipid metabolism, and suggest NR4A1
as a potential therapeutic target in TTS. However,
the exact functional role of NR4A1 in b-AR signaling
and lipid homeostasis in the TTS heart remains to be
elucidated.
The FRET measurements showed a higher cAMP
response to increasing catecholamine levels in TTS-
iPSC-CMs compared with control cells (Figure 2C).
This may result in a cAMP-dependent increased
activation of PKA and subsequent specific phos-
phorylation
of
its
cellular
targets,
including
RYR2-2808, PLN-S16, TNI-S23/24, and Cav1.2-S1928
(Figures
2D
to
2H).
Besides
cAMP
levels,
Iso-
dependent beating frequency also shows a larger
dynamic range in TTS compared with control sub-
jects
(Figure
2J).
The
combined
monolayer
data
suggests increased susceptibility to catecholamines
under intensive stress conditions in patients with
TTS. This conclusion is strengthened by our EHM
data, which demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to
Iso in TTS (Figure 3D). A possible explanation could
be reduced receptor desensitization in TTS after
excessive stress. This hypothesis is supported by a
less-pronounced right shift of the acute Iso concen-
tration curve after 24-h chronic stimulation in TTS-
EHMs in comparison with control EHMs, indicating
a lower degree of catecholamine desensitization in
TTS-EHMs (Figures 3C and 3E). Preliminary data of
increased b1-AR gene expression after catecholamine
treatment in TTS compared with control subjects
underline the reduced receptor desensitization in
TTS (data not shown). As such, a role for b-AR
desensitization in cardiac diseases and maladaptive
responses has been discussed (20). Furthermore, and
consistent with the often-observed neuropsychiatric

 disorders in patients with TTS, b-AR desensitization
can be influenced by neurohormonal stimuli (21).
However, whether the ligand affinity of b-ARs is
different in TTS compared with control subjects is
still unclear
and needs
to be
elucidated
in the
future.
Moreover, in this study, we describe for the first
time that b-AR activity in TTS seems to be mainly
mediated by b1-ARs in combination with b2-ARs. This
is shown by a significantly increased Iso-dependent
FRET
response,
PKA-specific
phosphorylation
at
target sites, and electrical beating activity under ICI
or CGP treatment compared with control subjects
(Figure 4, Online Figure 8). This is an interesting
finding,
because
although
patients
treated
with
b-blockers developed TTS (2), b2-ARs can mitigate the
response to b1-ARs by activation of inhibitory G pro-
teins
(7).
Thus,
an
increase
in
b2-AR
activity
would not be expected to lead to a TTS phenotype.
However, the exact roles of the different b-ARs in
TTS
are
still
controversial,
as
previous
studies
showed that b2-ARs play a significant role in TTS
development (7).
Interestingly, despite similar basal cAMP levels, we
identified a hyperphosphorylation of the PKA target
PLN-S16
in
TTS
under
basal
conditions
(Online
Figure 2, Figure 2). This is consistent with a lower
absolute T50 time in monolayer TTS iPSC-CMs and
TTS-EHMs, and an increase in the amplitude of
calcium transients in TTS iPSC-CMs under the same
conditions (Figure 3A, Online Figures 5D and 6A).
These data indicate faster reuptake of calcium in
the
sarcoplasmic
reticulum
by
the
SERCA-PLN
complex
and
accelerated
relaxation.
A
possible
PKA-independent mechanism for PLN-S16 phosphor-
ylation is mediated by the cyclic guanosine mono-
phosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase I (22).
Crosstalk between cGMP and cAMP is mainly medi-
ated by b3-ARs (23). The contribution of b3-ARs to the
development of TTS and the level of cGMP as a
regulator of cAMP in TTS need to be analyzed in the
future.
We also identified increased lipid accumulation in
catecholamine-treated TTS-iPSC-CMs compared with
control iPSC-CMs, which was confirmed by higher
expression of the lipid importer CD36 in TTS-iPSC-
CMs and by decreased expression of the CPT1C lipid
translocase (Figures 5A to 5D). This, in fact, suggests
that more lipids are imported into the cell, with lower
levels of lipid translocation from the cytoplasm into
the mitochondria in TTS-CMs. These findings are
consistent with previous studies showing Iso-induced
lipid accumulation in human biopsies from patients
with TTS and in ISO/patient serum-stressed HL-1
cardiomyocytes (6,24). However, the expression of
lipid transporters, such as CD36, under acute stress is
still controversial (6). As alterations in the activity of
proteins, such as CD36 or CPT1C, that are involved in
the
transport
of
mitochondrial
substrates
were
described as mitochondrial disorders causing lipid
accumulation (25), we analyzed mitochondrial area in
iPSC-CMs and found a reduction in TTS compared
with
control
subjects
(Figures
5E
and
5F).
The
decreased
mitochondrial
content
might
influence
lipid droplet concentration in TTS. Excessive lipid
accumulation may result in lipid peroxidation and
disruption of biomembranes, resulting in disturbance
of ion transport processes and therefore lipotoxicity
(26). Consequently, our observation of increased lipid
accumulation after stress in TTS-iPSC-CMs suggests
that
catecholamine-induced
cardiac
lipotoxicity
contributes to the pathogenesis of TTS.
Another important finding includes the altered
electrical activity observed in iPSC-CMs of patients
with TTS after Iso stimulation. Under increasing Iso
concentrations,
TTS-iPSC-CMs
showed
a
larger
dynamic range than control cells (Figure 2J). In line
with these acute monolayer CM data, we showed a
greater change in beating frequency after chronic Iso
pre-incubation in TTS-EHMs compared with control

 subjects (Figure 3D, Online Figure 6B). This higher
responsiveness to Iso could be interpreted as a sur-
rogate for the hypercontractile phenotype of basal
CMs in the acute phase of TTS. The beating frequency
of iPSC-CMs from TTS recorded by MEA was gradually
lowered at Iso dosages of 1 mmol/l to 5 mmol/l, which
is similar to the range of Iso dosages that resulted in
intracellular lipid accumulation as a potential cause
of lipotoxicity. This gradual inhibition of electrical
activity is in line with earlier findings in HL1-CMs (6).

Generated TTS iPSC-CMs show a larger dynamic range toward excessive b-AR stress compared with control cells, as shown by FRET-measured cAMP, PKA activity, and
altered Ca2þ kinetics resulting in increased electrical abnormalities. The b-AR activity is mainly mediated by b1-AR in combination with b2-AR. The induced high
b-activation–dependent cellular stress can cause lipid-accumulation–dependent electrical stunning in a rising number of cells. Engineered human myocardium from
TTS-iPSC-CMs showed contractility abnormalities such as an impaired force of contraction and a greater sensitivity to catecholamine-induced toxicity as potential
mechanisms associated with the TTS phenotype. Taken together with the identified genetic variants in cardiac key regulator genes (RBM20, CASQ2), our findings
imply a genetic predisposition for TTS with substantial risk under excessive adrenergic stress. Furthermore, our findings shed new light on the possible underlying
mechanism of the contractile phenotype. Red indicates the main outcomes of this study, such as increased catecholamine-dependent sensitivity, electrical
abnormalities, and lipid accumulation. Green indicates new players or hints with evidence from this study, and blue indicates central issues in TTS, but without

 Another type of TTS-iPSC-CMs in our experiments
showed reversible silenced electrical activity, directly
after exposure to Iso (Figure 2I, Online Figure 4).
These findings of a gradual decrease of electrical
activity upon high Iso doses and reduced calcium-
dependent force generation in TTS-EHMs compared
with control subjects (Figure 2B, Online Figure 6A)
suggest that TTS-iPSC-CMs could recapitulate the
acute apical cardiodepression frequently observed in
patients with TTS.
We
also
identified highly
relevant variants
in
cardiac genes, such as RBM20, encoding RNA-binding
motif protein 20, or CASQ2, encoding calsequestrin 2,
in patients TTS 2 and 5. Interestingly, autosomal
dominant mutations in RBM20 have been associated
with
dilated
cardiomyopathy
(CMD1DD,
OMIM
613172). Sequence analyses revealed that the identi-
fied RBM20 variant substitutes the highly conserved
tyrosine at position 347 with cytosine (p.Y347C)
(Online Figure 9B). It was previously shown by us and
others that single variants in conserved regions of
RBM20 can lead to mis-splicing of targets, such as
titin or CAMKII, and to decreased force of contraction
as a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in 2- and
3-dimensional
iPSC-CM
heart
models
(27)
(our
unpublished data, Streckfuss-Bömeke et al., May
2017). These findings further support the suggested
functional evidence of variants in RBM20 in TTS.
Autosomal recessive mutations in CASQ2 have been
associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic ven-
tricular tachycardia, with or without structural heart
disease
(OMIM
611938
and
615441).
The
CASQ2
variant F189L is located in a very conserved region
(Online Figure 9B), and was shown to have functional
consequences for cytosolic Ca2þ and human ether-a-
go-go–related channels (hERG), supporting the sug-
gested functional evidence on this variant in TTS (28).
Variants in hERG itself are also associated with TTS
(29). Follow-up studies are required to investigate in
detail the effect of the identified novel RBM20 and
CASQ2 variants on the TTS phenotype. Still, further
WES experiments and analysis, especially in larger
patient
cohorts,
will
be
necessary
to
prove
the
hypothesis
of
a
genetic
predisposition
to
TTS.
Nevertheless, identifying variants in genes encoding
important cardiac proteins associated with cardiac
pathologies in 2 of 4 patients suggests that genetic
variants
affecting
different
key
components
of
cardiac function may underlie or predispose to TTS.
Of note, besides the hypothesized genetic predispo-
sition to TTS, epigenetic mechanisms were shown to
be important for the development of stress-induced
heart failure (30).
Taken together, based on our results, TTS-CMs
show
a
greater
sensitivity
and
response
toward
catecholamine stimulation compared with control
cells, as shown by FRET-measured cAMP and PKA
activity, resulting in enhanced beating frequency and
accelerated Ca2þ kinetics. This high b-activation–
dependent cell stress is mainly mediated by b1-ARs,
and can cause lipid-accumulation–dependent elec-
trical stunning in a rising number of cells, shown by
decreasing frequency at excessive Iso dosages simu-
lating an overload in TTS. Furthermore, our data
demonstrate that lowering of frequencies at high
Iso dosages is also present in control iPSC-CMs,
suggesting that TTS might, in principle, be inducible
in all humans, whereas patients with TTS are genet-
ically predisposed and at high risk under excessive
adrenergic stress (Central Illustration).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. It is hypothesized that TTS is
based on multiple factors in a complex whole organ
setting,
rather
than
on
cell-autonomous
defects.
Therefore, in the future, protocols to differentiate
iPSCs into organoid cultures composed of several
distinct cell types should be developed to recapitulate
features of tissues, rather than that of individual cell
types in vitro (31). For this study, we used 2 different
selected clones from each TTS patient based on car-
diac differentiation capacity and cardiac phenotype.
As the genetic background, sex, and age of the
patients with TTS and control subjects, as well as the
maturity of iPSC-CMs can influence the results of this
work, age-matched control iPSCs or healthy family
members would be ideal controls and should be
considered in future studies. However, donor-specific
analysis
of
various
readouts
(e.g.,
calcium
T50)
showed minor differences between single patients or
control subjects (Online Figures 5C and 10). As the
contribution
of
the
identified
novel
RBM20
and
CASQ2 variants to the observed TTS phenotype is still
unclear,
detailed
functional
analyses,
including
comprehensive
genome
editing
work
on
these
variants, are required in the future. Apart from the
studied
catecholamines,
further
investigation
of
potential protective mechanisms, including estrogen
and
other
signaling,
and
therapeutic
substances
besides beta-blockers need to be investigated.
CONCLUSIONS
Our data show that iPSC-CMs from patients with TTS
are substantially different from control iPSC-CMs
regarding catecholamine susceptibility, b-adrenergic
signaling, lipid accumulation, electrophysiology, and
active force generation. In conjunction with our

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:
IPSC-CMs from patients with a severe TTS phenotype
show strong catecholamine sensitivity and altered
b-adrenergic signaling as a potential disease cause for
TTS. Taken together with the identified genetic
variants in key cardiac regulator genes, our findings
imply a genetic predisposition in TTS through
increased sensitivity to catecholamine toxicity.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies,
including clinical studies, are needed to establish the
detailed mechanism by which higher sensitivity of TTS
to Iso, and therefore altered b-adrenergic signaling,
results in cardiac dysfunction in patients with TTS.
This should help to develop a therapeutic long-term
treatment option and pave the way to studying
predisposing genetic factors in a large patient cohort.
