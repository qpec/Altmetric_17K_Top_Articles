Objective: To investigate the impact of the androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on the decidualization of human
endometrial stromal cells isolated from women of advanced reproductive age.
Design: In vitro study.
Setting: University research institute.
Patient(s): Proliferative phase primary human endometrial stromal fibroblasts (hESFs) were isolated from women of advanced re-
productive age (n ¼ 16; mean age, 44.7 � 2.3). None of the women were receiving hormone therapy or had endometriosis.
Intervention(s): Isolated hESFs were decidualized in vitro by incubation with P (1 mM) and cAMP (0.1 mg/mL) in the presence, or
absence, of DHEA (10 nM, 100 nM).
Main Outcome Measure(s): Secretion of androgens was assessed by ELISA. Expression of decidualization markers and endometrial
receptivity markers was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and ELISA.
Result(s): Decidualization responses were retained in hESF isolated from women of advanced reproductive age. Supplementation with
DHEA increased androgen biosynthesis and concentrations of T and dihydrotestosterone were �3� greater after coincubation with
DHEA compared with hESF stimulated with decidualization alone. Addition of DHEA to decidualized hESF increased expression of
the decidualization markers IGFBP1 and PRL and the endometrial receptivity marker SPP1. DHEA enhanced secretion of IGFBP1,
PRL, and SPP1 proteins maximally by day 8 of the decidualization time course concomitant with peak androgen concentrations.
Conclusion(s): These novel results demonstrate DHEA can enhance in vitro decidualization responses of hESF from women of
advanced reproductive age. Supplementation with DHEA during the receptive phase may augment endometrial function and improve
pregnancy rates in natural or assisted reproductive cycles. (Fertil Steril� 2018;109:728–34. �2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

 implantation is a rate-limiting step in achieving a successful
pregnancy.
Endometrial receptivity and implantation are dependent
on endometrial stromal cell decidualization, which plays a
critical role in defining a time-limited window of receptivity
when embryo implantation is favored. Decidualization is
accompanied by biosynthesis of androgens (8) that in turn
support the biosynthesis of factors critical to the development
of a robust decidualization response and associated end-
ometrial receptivity (8). Appropriate regulation and inte-
gration of these intracrine/paracrine signals is key to
promoting an endometrial microenvironment that can sup-
port establishment and maintenance of pregnancy.
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an adrenal androgen
precursor that is abundant in the circulation. In women, the
androgen receptor agonists T and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
are synthesized within peripheral tissues from DHEA by the
actions of the enzymes 3b- and 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydro-
genases (3BHSD, 17BHSD) and 5a-reductases. All these en-
zymes are expressed in the normal endometrium (9).
Whether changes in the bioavailability of DHEA determine
the capacity for androgen biosynthesis in the premenopausal
endometrium is not known. Importantly, the circulating ‘‘pre-
cursor pool’’ of DHEA declines with age, and concentrations
of DHEA in women ages 40–50 are half those of women in
their 20s (10). In addition, circulating concentrations of
DHEA are elevated in women with polycystic ovarian syn-
drome (PCOS) (11), but the potential impact of increased
DHEA on endometrial function is poorly understood. We
therefore speculated that changes in circulating DHEA might
alter endometrial androgen bioavailability and modify the
endometrial microenvironment.
In the current study we assessed the impact of DHEA sup-
plementation on decidualization of endometrial stromal fi-
broblasts isolated from women of advanced reproductive
age. Our results demonstrate that DHEA can enhance de-
cidualization and endometrial receptivity by acting as precur-
sor to androgens produced within the endometrium. Thus,
targeted supplementation with DHEA may enhance end-
ometrial function and improve pregnancy rates in women
of advanced reproductive age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Studies
Primary human endometrial tissue (proliferative phase, n ¼ 16)
was obtained from women of advanced reproductive age
(mean age, 44.7 � 2.3) undergoing surgery for nonmalignant
gynecological conditions. None of the women were receiving
hormone therapy or had endometriosis. Primary human endo-
metrial stromal fibroblasts (hESFs) were isolated from prolifera-
tive phase endometrium, and the cycle phase was determined as
reported previously (12). Decidualization was induced by addi-
tion of decidualization (DEC) media (RPMI 1640, 2% charcoal-
stripped fetal calf serum [FCS], 0.1 mg/mL 8-Br-cAMP [Sigma,
B5386], 1 mM P [Tocris, cat no. 2835]). Some cell cultures were
supplemented with DHEA (10 or 100 nM, Santa Cruz sc-
202573) for the duration of the culture period. Control cultures
were incubated with RPMI 1640, 2% charcoal-stripped FCS,
and equivalent volume of vehicle control (DMSO). To assess
the time-dependent accumulation of secreted products, treat-
mentsweremaintainedforthedurationofeachtimepoint.hESFs
were treated for 1, 2, 4, and 8 daysas indicated. The expressionof
decidualization markers and an androgen-regulated receptivity
marker(SPP1)wasassessedbyquantitativepolymerasechainre-
action(qPCR)andELISA.SecretionofT,DHT,SPP1,IGFBP1,and
PRL was assessed by ELISA. Some experiments were performed
in immortalized human endometrial stromal cells (SHT290) as
indicated in Supplemental Figure 1. Culture conditions, treat-
ments, and sample collection/analysis for SHT290 cells were
identical to hESF cultures.
Measurement of mRNA
Isolation of mRNAs, preparation of cDNAs, and analysis by
qPCR was performed according to standard protocols (12);
samples were quantified by standard curve method or by
the comparative DDCt method with CYC as an internal con-
trol. Primers/probes are given in Supplemental Table 1.
ELISA
T, DHT, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1),
and PRL were measured in culture supernatants as described
previously (8) (Supplemental Tables 2–4). Secretion of SPP1
was quantified by bead ELISA (R&D) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions and measured using a Bio-Plex 200
HTF machine and Bio-Plex Manager Software (ver. 5, BioRad).
Western Blot Analysis
Western blotting was performed using 50 mg/lane total cell
lysates; membranes were probed with rabbit anti-AKR1C3
(Supplemental Table 5; predicted molecular weight 37 kDa;
green), loading control was goat anti-actin (Supplemental
Table 5; predicted molecular weight 43 kDa; red). Membranes
were incubated with species-specific fluorescent-conjugated
secondary antibodies and visualized using the Licor Odyssey
system (Licor). Protein bands detected by Western blot were
quantified by performing densitometry analysis using ImageJ
(NIH.gov). Data were normalized to actin and expressed as
fold change relative to control treatment.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad prism.
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to deter-
mine significance between treatments in grouped data.
Nonparametric testing was used where sample sizes were
insufficient to confirm normality of data distribution; the
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess differences between
treatments. Where data were analyzed as fold change, signif-
icance was tested using one-sample t-test and a theoretical
mean of 1. P<.05 was considered statistically significant.
All data are presented as mean � SEM.
Study Approval
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects
before surgery; ethics approval was granted by the Lothian

RESULTS
DHEA Supplementation Increases Intracrine
Androgen Production
We assessed secretion of androgens by hESF from day 1 to 8
of a decidualization time course in the presence or absence of
10 nM DHEA (Fig. 1A and 1B). This concentration was chosen
to mimic those reported for premenopausal women below the
age of 40 (Table 1). At each time point assessed, supp-
lementation of DEC media with DHEA significantly increased
the amount of androgen secreted into the culture media such
that by days 4 and 8 concentrations of T in DHEA supp-
lemented cultures were �3� those of hESF incubated in stan-
dard DEC medium (Fig. 1A; P<.0001). DHT concentrations
were also increased by supplementation with DHEA, being
2� higher after 4 (P<.001) and further increased after
8 days (P<.0001) compared with DEC alone (Fig. 1B). We
next assessed whether secretion of androgens in hESF was
influenced by the amount of DHEA by supplementing with
10 or 100 nM DHEA (Fig. 1C and 1D). The concentration of
both T and DHT secreted by hESF was robustly and sig-
nificantly increased in a dose-dependent manner by both
10 nM (P<.0001) and 100 nM (P<.0001) DHEA compared
with DEC alone (Fig. 1C and 1D). DHEA did not affect ex-
pression of aldo-keto-reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3), the key
enzyme required for the conversion of precursors to T during
decidualization of hESF (8) (Fig. 2), suggesting the increase in
T biosynthesis in DHEA supplemented cultures was due to an
increase in the amount of precursor steroid and not altered
concentrations of enzyme.
DHEA Supplementation Enhances Decidualization
and Expression of the Endometrial Receptivity
Marker SPP1
To assess whether decidualization was enhanced by addition
of DHEA, the expression of the decidualization markers
IGFBP1 and PRL was determined by ELISA and qPCR. Time
course analysis revealed a significant time-dependent in-
crease in expression of IGFBP1 (Fig. 3A; P<.01) and PRL
(Fig. 3D; P<.0001) in hESFs treated with DEC. Cotreatment
with DHEA further enhanced expression of mRNAs encoding

 both IGFBP1 (P<.001) and PRL (P<.0001) by 8 days
compared with DEC alone (Fig. 3A and 3D). Assessment of su-
pernatants revealed a significant increase in the secretion of
IGFBP1 and PRL protein with DEC consistent with previous
studies (Supplemental Fig. 1) (8). Addition of DHEA led to a
robust and significant increase in secretion of decidualization
markers, which was approximately double that of DEC alone
for IGFBP1 (Fig. 3B; P<.01) and PRL (Fig. 3E; P<.001) after
4 days, an effect that was still detectable after 8 days treat-
ment for both IGFBP1 (Fig. 3C; P<.001) and PRL (Fig. 3F;
P<.01). Since androgen production was dependent on
DHEA concentration during decidualization, we also performed
a DHEA dose-response experiment to determine the impact of
DHEA concentration on decidualization (Supplemental Fig. 1).
We tested DHEA concentrations, which ranged from sub-
physiological (0.1 nM), to physiological (1, 10 nM), and supra-
physiological (100 nM DHEA). We found that the impact of
DHEA on expression of decidualization markers was dose
dependent, appearing to elicit a bell-shaped dose response
consistent with androgens acting as ‘‘Goldilocks factors’’
(18). Notably, neither very low nor very high concentrations
of DHEA reduced expression of the decidualization markers
IGFBP1 and PRL. The greatest increase in expression of de-
cidualization markers was detected after supplementation
with DHEA concentrations between 1 and 10 nM in line
with reported physiological serum concentrations in healthy
women (Table 1).
Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1; osteopontin) is an ess-
ential marker of endometrial receptivity, and its expression in-
creases as hESFs decidualize (8). Our previous study (8)
identified that SPP1 was androgen regulated during deci-
dualization. In the current study, time course analysis revealed
that expression of SPP1 was increased by 8 days after stim-
ulation with DEC media (Fig. 3G). Addition of DHEA had a
time-dependent impact on SPP1 mRNA with a striking and sig-
nificant increase on day 8 compared with DEC alone (P<.001;
Fig. 3G). Concentrations of secreted SPP1 protein were
measured by ELISA in matched supernatants from 4 and
8 days of treatment. SPP1 concentrations were variable among
patients (Supplemental Fig. 1). Fold-change analysis of SPP1
concentrations between DEC and DEC DHEA revealed no
significant change after 4 days of treatment (Fig. 3H) but a
significant increase in cultures treated with DHEA after
8 days (Fig. 3I; P<.01).
DISCUSSION
Optimizing endometrial responses is critical for pregnancy
success. To date, there has been limited evidence to suggest
that altering the bioavailability of androgen precursors like
DHEA could have an impact on endometrial function. An
older study reported that the endometrium can convert
DHEA to active androgens and that formation of T is
increased during the secretory phase (19), but whether this
affects hESF function is not known. Pharmacological con-
centrations of DHEA (100 mM) impair decidualization of
hESF by inhibiting glucose flux and the pentose phosphate
pathway (20); however, 100 nM DHEA is reported to enhance
expression of the decidualization marker Homeobox A10
(HOXA10) and reduce production of reactive oxygen species
in murine endometrial stromal fibroblasts (21). In the current
study, we provide the first evidence that DHEA can act as a
prohormone to increase intracrine androgen production in
hESFs derived from normal endometrium during decidualiza-
tion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the capacity for a
robust decidualization response is retained in women of
advanced reproductive age and can be enhanced by
increasing availability of the androgen precursor DHEA.
SPP1, the only factor identified that is common to all reported
endometrial receptivity gene sets (22), was increased maxi-
mally after supplementation with DHEA after 8 days.
Concomitantly, we detected an increase in expression of the
decidualization markers IGFBP1 and PRL. Increased ex-
pression of these key markers was associated with maximal
production of androgens in the DHEA-treated group. Taken
together, these results suggest that poor endometrial re-
sponses in some older women may reflect deficits in the
bioavailability of systemic factors, such as DHEA, rather
than functional decline of the cells/tissue per se. These find-
ings support and expand evidence that androgens have the

 capacity to fine-tune the trajectory of endometrial tissue re-
modeling and thus targeting androgen action may be benefi-
cial in improving suboptimal endometrial responses.
Fluctuations in DHEA that occur as a result of endo-
crinopathies provide some insights into the potential impact
of DHEA on fertility. PCOS is a complex, multifactorial disor-
der that is characterized by the presence of two out of three
criteria: anovulation, polycystic ovarian morphology, and
hyperandrogenism (Rotterdam criteria) (23). DHEA, as well
as androstenedione and T, is reported to be elevated in
PCOS (11), however, interpreting the impact(s) of hyperandro-
genism on endometrial function is challenging. Elevated
expression of androgen receptor has been reported in the
endometrium of women with PCOS (24), and decidualization
is reported to be impaired in hESF isolated from women with
PCOS in some but not all patients (25). In the current study,
the highest concentration of DHEA tested (100 nM), which ex-
ceeded reported serum concentrations for PCOS (18 nM;
Table 1), enhanced production of T and DHT during decidual-
ization but did not alter expression of decidualization
markers. Thus, although androgen signaling is altered in
women with PCOS, its impact on endometrial function is as
yet unclear. A recent study that compared IVF outcomes in
364 women with tubal factor infertility to 307 women with
PCOS reported that women with PCOS had more oocytes
retrieved and higher clinical pregnancy and LBRs (26). It is
conceivable that higher concentrations of androgens may
have an impact on endometrial function in women with
PCOS, which may account for some of the differences in
IVF success, however, further studies are needed to determine
any potential endometrial effect. Future studies should focus
on investigating the responses of hESFs isolated from women
undergoing donor egg recipient regimen (E2 and P4 before ET).
This approach would account for menstrual cycle distur-
bances as a result of ovarian dysfunction and allow isolated
assessment of the impact of age and DHEA on endometrial
responses.
Implantation and pregnancy rates are reported to remain
constant with increasing recipient age when donor oocytes
are used in ART cycles. Reports from collated Centers for Dis-
ease Control data using large patient cohorts from multiple
centers in the Unites States (n ¼ 17,339 cycles) demonstrated
no age-dependent decline in pregnancy rates of recipients un-
der the age of 50 (5). The most up-to-date data from the So-
ciety for Assisted Reproductive technology member clinic
survey from 27,959 fresh donor oocyte IVF cycles reported
a small but significant drop in pregnancy rates in recipient
women over the age of 44; but it was noted that absolute
LBRs were still relatively high in this patient cohort (3). In
the absence of oocyte donation, age-related decline in IVF
success rates is reported (4). A number of different strategies
have been reported to help improve success of non–oocyte
donor IVF cycles including supplementation with DHEA,
however, studies investigating the impact of DHEA on re-
productive outcomes have been limited by a lack of random-
ized controlled trials. A recent Cochrane review examining
the effect of either direct androgen supplementation (T) or
DHEA supplementation in women undergoing ART reported
that androgens may be associated with improved LBRs but
had no conclusive effect on ovarian function or miscarriage
rates (27). Barad et al. investigated the impact of DHEA on
pregnancy rates in women with diminished ovarian reserve
and reported improved clinical pregnancy rates compared
with controls (28). However, in this study half of the pregnan-
cies reported occurred spontaneously, before IVF, which we
believe could be due to improved endometrial function/recep-
tivity. An increased capacity to convert supplemented DHEA
to T was also associated with improved pregnancy rates in a

 study of 213 women with diminished ovarian reserve under-
going IVF, consistent with a role for adrenal precursors in
successful pregnancies (29). Although these studies suggest
DHEA supplementation may improve pregnancy rates, the
mechanism and impact of DHEA on endometrial function
were not explored.
Sex steroid precursors represent new therapeutic targets in
both natural and assisted reproduction. While there is accumu-
lating evidence that DHEA supplementation is well tolerated in
postmenopausal women, the effects in premenopausal women
are poorly defined. Notably, the Cochrane review on androgen
supplementation in ART concluded there was still insufficient
data to draw conclusions on the safety of either T or DHEA sup-
plementation (27). We propose that future trials should focus on
evaluating the efficacy of transient targeted delivery rather than
systemic longitudinal treatment to reduce the likelihood of side
effects. Indeed, it has already been reported that intravaginal
DHEA does not have systemic effects (30).
Conclusion
The novel findings presented in the current study provide
compelling evidence that DHEA can act as a precursor to
intracrine androgen production in the premenopausal endo-
metrium and that concentrations of DHEA within the phys-
iological range enhance decidualization. Our data suggest
that decidualization responses are retained in women of

 reductions in circulating concentrations of DHEA may
constrain endometrial function. We suggest that supple-
mentation with DHEA may therefore represent a novel ther-
apeutic strategy that could enhance fertility in women of
advanced reproductive age.

 SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE 1
Dose-dependent impact of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on expression of decidualization markers. To determine the impact of varying
concentrations of DHEA on decidualization, immortalized human endometrial stromal cells (SHT290) were treated with either vehicle control
(VC), decidualization (DEC) media, or DEC media supplemented with 0.1, 1, 10, or 100nM DHEA (DEC DHEA) for 4 days. Expression of mRNAs
encoding IGFBP1 and PRL were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. n ¼ 3, triplicate treatments. One-way ANOVA with
Tukey's multiple comparisons test (IGFBP1) or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's multiple comparison test (PRL). *P<.05; ***P<.001; ****P<.0001.

DHEA supplementation enhances secretion of decidualization and endometrial receptivity markers. Primary hESF were treated with either vehicle
control (VC), DEC media, or DHEA-supplemented DEC media (DEC DHEA) for up to 8 days. Concentrations of IGFBP1, PRL, and SPP1 were
measured by ELISA. Median IGFBP1 and PRL concentrations plotted at each time point and treatment. SPP1 was measured by ELISA in day 4
and day 8 supernatants from hESF treated with DEC and DEC DHEA. n ¼ 6 patients, duplicate treatments. Two-way ANOVA. *P<.05;
**P<.01; ***P<.001; ****P<.0001.
