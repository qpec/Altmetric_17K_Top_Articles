Summary
Background Time-limited, early-life exposures to institutional deprivation are associated with disorders in childhood, 
but it is unknown whether effects persist into adulthood. We used data from the English and Romanian Adoptees 
study to assess whether deprivation-associated adverse neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes persist into 
young adulthood. 
Methods The English and Romanian Adoptees study is a longitudinal, natural experiment investigation into the long-
term outcomes of individuals who spent from soon after birth to up to 43 months in severe deprivation in Romanian 
institutions before being adopted into the UK. We used developmentally appropriate standard questionnaires, 
interviews completed by parents and adoptees, and direct measures of IQ to measure symptoms of autism spectrum 
disorder, inattention and overactivity, disinhibited social engagement, conduct or emotional problems, and cognitive 
impairment (IQ score <80) during childhood (ages 6, 11, and 15 years) and in young adulthood (22–25 years). For 
analysis, Romanian adoptees were split into those who spent less than 6 months in an institution and those who 
spent more than 6 months in an institution. We used a comparison group of UK adoptees who did not experience 
deprivation. We used mixed-effects regression models for ordered-categorical outcome variables to compare symptom 
levels and trends between groups.
Findings Romanian adoptees who experienced less than 6 months in an institution (n=67 at ages 6 years; n=50 at 
young adulthood) and UK controls (n=52 at age 6 years; n=39 at young adulthood) had similarly low levels of 
symptoms across most ages and outcomes. By contrast, Romanian adoptees exposed to more than 6 months in an 
institution (n=98 at ages 6 years; n=72 at young adulthood) had persistently higher rates than UK controls of 
symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, disinhibited social engagement, and inattention and overactivity through to 
young adulthood (pooled p<0·0001 for all). Cognitive impairment in the group who spent more than 6 months in an 
institution remitted from markedly higher rates at ages 6 years (p=0·0001) and 11 years (p=0·0016) compared with 
UK controls, to normal rates at young adulthood (p=0·76). By contrast, self-rated emotional symptoms showed a late-
onset pattern with minimal differences versus UK controls at ages 11 years (p=0·0449) and 15 years (p=0·17), and 
then marked increases by young adulthood (p=0·0005), with similar effects seen for parent ratings. The high 
deprivation group also had a higher proportion of people with low educational achievement (p=0·0195), unemployment 
(p=0·0124), and mental health service use (p=0·0120, p=0·0032, and p=0·0003 for use when aged <11 years, 
11–14 years, and 15–23 years, respectively) than the UK control group. A fifth (n=15) of individuals who spent more 
than 6 months in an institution were problem-free at all assessments.
Interpretation Notwithstanding the resilience shown by some adoptees and the adult remission of cognitive 
impairment, extended early deprivation was associated with long-term deleterious effects on wellbeing that seem 
insusceptible to years of nurturance and support in adoptive families.

Introduction
The role of social and emotional deprivation in the 
pathogenesis of mental health problems is a long-
standing focus of psychiatry.1 One hypothesis, held by 
many to be self-evident, is that such adverse exposures 
have an especially pernicious and persistent effect when 
experienced early in life during sensitive periods of 
development.2 Although animal studies strongly support 
this view,3 equivalently robust evidence in human beings 
has been difficult to find. Experimental exposure of 
children to deprivation is ethically unacceptable,4 but 
drawing inferences from associations between early

adversity and later mental disorder in observational 
studies is compromised by heterogeneity in exposure 
type, timing, and severity; confounding between initial 
and continuing adversity; and familial correlations 
between genetic and environmental risks.5
The English and Romanian Adoptees study addresses 
these limitations by using data from a natural 
experiment, the adoption by UK families of young 
children who had spent nearly all their early lives in 
Romania’s grossly depriving institutions during the 
regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu.6 In the institutions, most 
children 
experienced 
extremely 
poor 
hygiene, 
insufficient food, little personalised care, and social and 
cognitive understimulation. By contrast, following their 
arrival in the UK (between 2 weeks and 43 months of 
age), the children joined socioeconomically advantaged, 
stable, caring, and supportive families. We previously 
assessed these children’s development at ages 6, 11, and 
15 years (and a subsample at 4 years). Profound 
developmental delay for most children at UK entry7 was 
followed by a period of rapid recovery for many adoptees.8 
By age 6 years, children with limited exposure to 
deprivation (<6 months) were largely indistinguishable 
from a group of non-deprived UK adoptees. However, 
for many, but not all, children exposed to more extended 
deprivation (>6 months) significant impairment of 
social and cognitive functioning persisted through to 
adolescence.9 Core to this pattern were symptoms of 
disinhibited social engagement, autism spectrum 
disorder (termed quasi-autism; includes especially 
notable communication and obsessional problems), 
inattention and overactivity, and cognitive impairment. 
Although initially absent, signs of emotional problems 
began to emerge in adolescence.10,11 Similar effects have 
been found in other institutionalised, although less 
severely deprived, populations.12–14
Although other studies have examined the adult 
outcomes of groups of international adoptees,15 the 
recent completion of the English and Romanian 
Adoptees young adult follow-up (age 22–25 years) allows 
us, for the first time, to chart childhood-to-adult develop-
mental trajectories in a large group of individuals affected 
by early profound global institutional deprivation. We 
had several hypotheses. First, that Romanian adoptees 
who spent less than 6 months in an institution and UK 
adoptee controls would display similarly low levels of 
symptoms at all ages. Second, that increased rates of 
inattention 
and 
overactivity, 
disinhibited 
social 
engagement, autism spectrum disorder, and cognitive 
impairment symptoms would persist despite continued 
good-quality adoptive care in the adoptees who spent 
more than 6 months in an institution. This hypothesis is 
based on animal research highlighting the deep-seated 
nature of such effects and previous evidence of childhood 
persistence from the English and Romanian Adoptees 
study.6 Third, that emotional problems would escalate 
between adolescence and adulthood in the group 
who experienced more than 6 months of deprivation, 
Research in context
Research before this study
We searched ISI Web of Science and MEDLINE on July 1, 2016, 
for longitudinal studies on the effects of early institutional 
deprivation on development with adult outcome data 
published in English since 1990. Search terms included 
“deprivation”, “institutional”, “early adversity”, “children”, 
“autism,” “disinhibited attachment/social engagement”, 
“hyperactivity”, “inattention”, “IQ”, “cognition”, “behaviour 
problems”, “conduct problems”, “depression”, “anxiety”, and 
“emotional problems”. Although there are a number of 
longitudinal cohort studies of the effects of early institutional 
deprivation, they did not follow up individuals into adult life.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to follow a 
cohort of children who suffered profound but circumscribed 
periods of institutional deprivation through to adult life, allowing 
direct comparison of their post-institutional developmental 
trajectories across multiple neurodevelopmental and mental 
health domains. It extends our previous work and that of studies 
such as the Bucharest Early Intervention Project by providing 
evidence of a striking persistence into young adulthood of core 
neurodevelopmental problems in three symptom domains: 
inattention and overactivity, disinhibited social engagement, and 
autism spectrum disorder, despite the positive influence of well 
resourced, caring, and supportive adoptive families. By contrast, 
early problems in cognitive impairment were rarely carried into 
young adulthood. There was an emergence of emotional 
problems among the young adults who experienced extended 
deprivation. Despite the extent of problems in this group overall, 
there was a substantial minority who appeared resilient, showing 
no core problem at any age.
Implications of all the available evidence
Time-limited but intense periods of early institutional 
deprivation can have profound effects on development and 
mental health that can persist beyond adolescence and into 
young adulthood in ways that both compromise functioning 
and lead to clinically significant problems. These effects are 
consistent with models that propose that early environmental 
adversity can have deep-seated neurobiological effects. 
Practitioners and policy makers need to take histories of 
deprivation and other forms of adversity into account when 
assessing and treating individuals with mental health and 
neurodevelopmental problems. Most importantly, 
adolescent-to-adult transitional services need to carefully 
consider the needs of such patients and ensure continuation of 
appropriate care as young people enter adult life.

reflecting the especially challenging nature of the 
adolescent-to-adult transition for this group. We aimed to 
test these hypotheses using available data from the 
English and Romanian Adoptees study.
Methods
The English and Romanian Adoptees study
The English and Romanian Adoptees project is a 
longitudinal investigation into the development of children 
adopted into UK families from Romania in the early 1990s. 
The vast majority of the adoptees experienced extreme early 
global deprivation up to 43 months of age. 165 Romanian 
and 52 UK adoptees and their adoptive families were 
recruited in the years following their entry into the UK 
between February, 1990, and September, 1992. Ethical 
approval for the young adult follow-up was received from 
the University of Southampton Research Ethics Committee. 
At each assessment wave, all adoptees and family members 
gave written informed consent or verbal assent (where 
developmentally appropriate).
Procedures and assessments
Assessments took place in the individuals’ homes. 
Questionnaires were completed online or returned by 
post. For practical and scientific reasons, different 
assessment instruments were used at different ages. 
We collected parent reports, available at all age 
assessments, of six neurodevelopmental and mental 
health outcomes (autism spectrum disorder, inattention 
and overactivity, disinhibited social engagement, 
conduct problems, emotional problems, and cognitive 
impairment). Self-ratings of emotional and conduct 
problems, which are considered valuable complements 
to parent ratings in the adolescent and adult years,16,17 
were also collected for children aged 11 years, 15 years, 
and in young adulthood (age 22–25 years). Each 
outcome was characterised by three core symptom 
domains, measured, as far as possible, by equivalent 
ratings at each age. Indicators were extracted from 
available questionnaires and interviews using standard 
thresholds for symptom domain endorsement wherever 
possible (see appendix for specific wording of items at 
each age).
Inattention and overactivity covered the symptom 
domains 
hyperactivity, 
sustained 
attention, 
and 
distractibility, measured using items from the Revised 
Rutter scale18 at ages 6 years and 11 years; the Strengths and 
Difficulties Questionnaire19 at age 15 years; and the 
Conners Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scale20 in young 
adulthood. The same questionnaires were used to derive 
measures of conduct problems (covering the domains 
dishonesty, fighting, and defiance) and emotional 
problems (depressed mood, worry, and social anxiety). For 
each Revised Rutter scale and Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire domain, a symptom was judged endorsed 
when a rating of 2 (certainly applies) was made (0–2 scale). 
For the Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scale, the 
equivalent rating was often/very often (rating of 2 or 3; 
0–3 scale).
Assessment of disinhibited social engagement was based 
on researcher ratings of parents’ responses to age-
appropriate variations of three interview questions relating

to interactions with strangers, tapping the constructs of 
being “too friendly”, showing “inappropriate intrusiveness”, 
and being “unaware of social boundaries”. A rating of 
“definite evidence of disinhibition” (rating of 2 on a 
0–2 scale) represented a positive endorsement (appendix).8
Domains of autism spectrum disorder symptoms were 
assessed using 15 items from the Social Communication 
Questionnaire21 deemed to be developmentally relevant 
at all ages (appendix). Each symptom domain (social 
reciprocal interaction, communication, and repetitive 
and stereotyped behaviours) consisted of five items 
(appendix). A symptom domain was deemed endorsed if 
at least three items were rated 1 (0–1 scale).
Cognitive impairment was based on age-appropriate 
standardised IQ assessments: the McCarthy Scales of 
Children’s Abilities General Cognitive Index (age 
6 years),22 the short form of the Wechsler Intelligence 
Scale for Children (block design, object assembly, 
vocabulary, and similarities) at ages 11 years and 
15 years,23 and block design and vocabulary subscales 
from the short-form Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of 
Intelligence in adulthood.24 General Cognitive Index 
values were adjusted to account for apparent inflation of 
scores since the norms were established in 1970.25 As in 
previous studies of the English and Romanian Adoptees 
study population, cognitive impairment was judged 
present when individuals had an IQ of less than 80.
Family context, mental health service use, and young 
adult functioning data were derived from interviews on 
adoption breakdown (defined here as the child leaving 
the care of the family before age 18 years); adoptees’ 
mental health service use (parent-report); educational 
attainment and employment status; and parental 
socioeconomic status (based on parents’ occupation) and 
marital status. To assess parental supportiveness, young 
adult adoptees completed the 13-item support subscale of 
the Parental Attachment Questionnaire,26 while mothers’ 
and fathers’ responses to specific interview questions 
were coded. Young adult adoptees rated their relationship 
with their parents using the 25-item Inventory of Parent 
and Peer Attachment (appendix).27
Statistical analysis
As previously, we divided the Romanian adoptees into 
two groups: Romanian adoptees who spent less than 
6 months in an institution (n=67 at entry; including 
21 adoptees placed directly from their homes) and 
Romanian adoptees who spent more than 6 months in 
an institution (n=98 at entry). Previous analyses validated 
this distinction by showing a step-change in risk within 
the group with between 6 and 12 months of deprivation28 
and a similar low rate of problems in the UK and 
Romanian adoptees with less than 6 months of 
deprivation.6
We used mixed-effects logistic regression models for 
ordered categorical outcome variables to test for 
differences across development between the three 
groups, while supplementary analyses compared the 
UK and the other two groups separately (appendix). We 
ran models to compare the number of symptom 
domains endorsed for each outcome (0, 1, 2, or 3 for all 
outcomes except cognitive inhibition, which was coded 
0 or 1) and to test for symptom trends over age; 
differences in age-trends between groups; and contrasts 
of simple effects within assessment waves comparing

groups. We used χ² and McNemar tests to assess group 
differences in binary outcomes or covariates, as well as 
co-occurrence of symptoms among outcome domains 
(binary indicator, coded 1 if two or more of three 
symptom domains were endorsed for each outcome). To 
help to illustrate outcome co-occurrence, we combined 
the UK control and less than 6 months deprivation 
groups into a low deprivation group and compared with 
the more than 6 months deprivation group (for further 
details see appendix). We did McNemar tests and 
frequency tests using SPSS version 23. All other 
analyses were done using Stata version 13.1. 
We used largely illustrative cutoffs to provide 
consistency across outcome domains and over time. 
Although necessarily arbitrary to some degree and not 
representative of precise clinical cutoffs we attempted, as 
far as possible, to map these cutoffs onto acknowledged 
thresholds of clinically significant expressions across 
disorders.
We investigated missing data for all outcome variables 
using multivariate tests that modelled random dropout 
from the study and selective attrition (appendix). 
Additionally, to exclude the possibility of systematic 
differences in genotype that might explain differences in 
duration of deprivation, we used DNA taken at 15 years’ 
follow-up to compare minor allele frequencies of a small 
set of candidate genes between the groups of Romanian 
adoptees that spent more or less than 6 months in 
institutions using χ² tests. We also adjusted additional 
tests of group levels, assessment wave trends, and 
interactions of group by wave for standard scores of 
birthweight and for sex (appendix).

in the Romanian group were 66 (99%), 65 (97%), 62 (93%), 
and 50 (75%) for those with less than 6 months of 
deprivation and 98 (100%), 96 (98%), 89 (91%), and 
72 (73%) for those with more than 6 months’ deprivation. 
The average age at young adult assessment for the less 
than 6 month group was 23·5 years and for the more 
than 6 month group was 24·5 years. Missing data and 
participant dropout were largely consistent with an 
assumption of data missing completely at random 
(appendix). The exception to this was parent ratings of 
emotional problems, where dropout was predicted by 
previous low or average scores.
One family had an adoption breakdown. With this 
exception, adoptive families generally continued to 
provide a positive environment in adulthood with no 
difference between groups in terms of family socio-
economic status, intactness of parents’ marriage, child’s 
perception of parent relationship quality, and parent or 
adoptee perceptions of family support (table 1).28
Figure 1 shows developmental trends in binary 
indicators of all outcomes (statistical values reported in 
tables 2, 3, and the appendix). Outcomes mostly did not 
differ between the control group of UK adoptees and the 
group of Romanian adoptees who spent less than 
6 months in an institution, with both groups showing 
consistently low levels of symptoms (figure 1, table 2). By 
contrast, the group of Romanian adoptees who spent 
more than 6 months in an institution had early onset and 
persistently higher rates of symptoms for autism 
spectrum disorder, disinhibited social engagement, and 
inattention and overactivity compared with both the UK 
adoptees control group and the less deprived Romanian 
adoptees group (figure 1, table 2). Group differences in 
these domains established at age 6 years persisted to 
adulthood (table 2). Substantially elevated rates of 
cognitive impairment at age 6 years gradually resolved 
during development so that the group with more than 
6 months’ deprivation was indistinguishable from the 
other groups by adulthood (figure 1, table 2). Emotional 
problems followed a different, late-onset pattern: there 
were no differences between groups at age 6 years, and 
the pattern was largely unchanged at ages 11 and 15 years, 
but there was a significant increase in the number of both 
parent-rated and self-rated emotional symptoms seen in 
the group with more than 6 months deprivation during 
the transition to adulthood (figure 1, table 3). Conduct 
problems followed a similar, but less marked, pattern 
(parent rating only; tables 2, 3). Adjusting models for sex 
and birthweight did not change the results (appendix). 
Many individuals in the group who experienced more 
than 6 months of deprivation had symptoms of multiple 
problems (figure 2). More than a fifth of the group had 
two or more problems during childhood and adolescence 
(figure 2); however, this proportion dropped significantly 
to 8·5% (n=6; p for change=0·012) in young adulthood. 
15 (21%) individuals in the most deprived group did not 
meet criteria for any adverse outcomes at any age. By 
contrast, 33 (34%) persisted in meeting criteria for at 
least one problem at ages 6, 11, and 15 years; this figure 
dropped to 25% (n=18) if young adult outcomes were 
included. Different individuals displayed different 
patterns of overlapping problems, with every pair of co-
occuring problems being displayed at some age by at 
least some individuals who experienced more than 
6 months of deprivation (figure 2).

educational attainment and unemployment in early 
adulthood (table 1). Mental health service use at all ages 
was significantly higher in the group who experienced 
more than 6 months of deprivation than in the group of 
UK adoptees (table 1). Lifetime contact with services was 
very high in the 33 individuals in the most deprived 
group with persistent problems (67% [n=22] compared 
with the 28% [n=18] who reported no persistent problems; 
p=0·0003). At young adult follow-up, in the group who 
experienced more than 6 months in a Romanian 
institution, three individuals had referrals for borderline 
personality disorder, two had referrals for bipolar 
disorder, and two had referrals for psychosis.
Discussion
We provide compelling evidence that time-limited 
exposure to severe adversity, occurring because of 
institutional deprivation in early childhood, can have a 
profound and lasting psychological impact despite 
subsequent environmental enrichment in well resourced 
and supportive families. Our findings are in line with 
animal models describing long-lasting and deep-seated 
neurobiological 
and 
behavioural 
alterations 
after 
environmental adversity during circumscribed early 
developmental periods.29 The presence of multiple 
neurodevelopmental and mental health problems, with 
characteristic developmental trajectories, creates a 
distinctive, complex, and heterogeneous clinical picture; 
any two affected children rarely presented with the same 
clinical profile over time. Nevertheless, taking the group 
as a whole, three outcome domains (autism spectrum 
disorder, disinhibited social engagement, and inattention 
and overactivity) followed similar, somewhat overlapping, 
developmental trajectories, and appear to form an early 
onset, highly persistent, impairing, and clinically 
significant deprivation-specific core of characteristics.

The pattern of inappropriate social engagement with 
strangers (disinhibited social engagement) has, until 
now, been considered a childhood-limited feature.30 
However, given the previous evidence of persistence into 
adolescence in the presented sample, it is perhaps not 
surprising that it continued as a core of deprivation-
related characteristics in adulthood. Childhood autism 
spectrum disorder and inattention and overactivity can 
both persist into adulthood.31 The deprivation-related 
autism spectrum disorder phenotype was originally 
termed quasi-autism because initial results for children 
at age 6 years suggested a severe but remitting variant 
with a distinctive profile that was marked especially by 
aberrant patterns of social communication and obsessive 
behaviours.7 The young adult presentation of this 
disorder continues to reflect this original formulation, 
especially in the communication domain, although the 
extent of long-term persistence appears higher than 
originally expected.
Deprivation-related cognitive impairment followed a 
markedly different trajectory in its pattern of remission 
and normalisation. This course suggests either that 
institutional deprivation operates in different ways for 
cognitive impairment, making it more remediable, or 
that adoptive family life provided a more powerful 
remediating context for cognitive impairment. Either 
way, our results provide compelling evidence for long-
term neuroplasticity in human beings.
Unlike other outcomes, emotional problems showed a 
later-emerging pattern in the extended deprivation group, 
from age 6 years, when levels were practically identical 
across the groups, to young adulthood, where emotional 
problems were three-to-four-times higher than in other 
groups (figure 1). Although other forms of early adversity 
have been associated with adult depression and anxiety,32 
given their relative absence in this sample at earlier 
sampling waves, it is striking to see how emotional 
problems had become such a central feature of deprivation-
related clinical burden. These outcomes might be a 
developmental consequence of the adoptees’ experience of 
early-onset problems. Alternatively, they could be the result 
of a long-standing, but latent, vulnerability linked to early 
stress system sensitisation that is only expressed later in 
life. Finally, it is important to note that a substantial 
minority of the group who were deprived for more than 
6 months were problem-free from age 6 years onwards 
and had positive young adult outcomes. Understanding 
the origins of this resilience is a major focus of ongoing 
work, with preliminary studies pointing towards genetics33 
and epigenetics4 as important contributors.
Despite the many strengths of the design of the 
longitudinal English and Romanian Adoptees study, 
there are a number of possible limitations to consider. 
We had limited information on possible preinstitutional 
risks. Maternal smoking, substance use, or stress 
exposures during pregnancy have been associated with 
increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems.34 
However, it seems unlikely that these factors could 
account for the association shown here between 
deprivation duration and poor outcome. The effects of 
deprivation reported here are much larger than previous 
estimates for prenatal exposure risk. Also, it seems 
unlikely that children who spent more than 6 months in 
institutions would have been exposed to sufficiently 
greater prenatal risk than those who had spent less than 
6 months in institutions, partly because the timing of 
adoption was largely determined by the fall of Ceaușescu’s 
regime. Consistent with this view, we found no 
statistically significant differences in birthweight, a 
perinatal marker of prenatal risk, between the 
two institutional groups (table 1), and adjustment for 
birthweight did not change results of longitudinal 
models (appendix). Likewise, there was no evidence that 
these two groups differed in terms of a number of known 
genetic markers of neurodevelopmental risk (appendix). 
In fact, the high rates of mortality35 from infection in the 
institutions (some have estimated a 40% death rate each 
winter) might have, over time, enriched the long-term 
institutionalised group with more, rather than less, 
resilient children.
A second potential limitation was that outcomes were 
measured using different questionnaires, with different 
formats for response scaling used at different ages. As a 
result, we needed to identify equivalent thresholds for 
the 
endorsement 
of 
symptom 
domains. 
Our 
thresholding decisions were further validated by the 
overall low and stable pattern of symptoms in the UK 
group and the group who spent less than 6 months in 
institutions and the high levels of contact with mental 
health services and poor adult functioning in the group 
who spent more than 6 months in institutions. However, 
this approach inevitably restricted the scope of the 
assessments to the constructs measured at age 6 years. 
A third limitation was that, by contrast to the previous 
assessment phases, there was more attrition between 
adolescence and young adulthood, although this 
appeared to be non-selective (appendix). Finally, because 
duration and timing of deprivation overlapped, we were 
unable to address the key issue of sensitive 
developmental windows in any detail.
Our finding that early institutional deprivation is 
associated with a pervasive pattern of long-term 
impairment and burden is relevant to the health and 
wellbeing of the very large numbers of children worldwide 
still exposed to depriving and neglectful conditions.36,37 
Even when the deprivation experienced is less severe than 
in the Romanian institutions, studies suggest that the 
cluster of neurodevelopmental problems seen in the 
English and Romanian Adoptees study sample are 
common in other samples of institutionalised but well 
cared for children and adolescents.12–14,38 Questions about 
the extent to which such problems will persist to 
adulthood in these groups, and whether our findings can 
be generalised to children who experience other forms of

abuse or trauma, remain to be investigated fully. Our 
findings highlight the importance of documenting early-
life adversity during clinical assessments. Records of 
adversary can aid in the planning of services to address 
the especially persistent and complex nature of the 
problems such individuals have. Our results suggest that 
taking account of such histories is likely to be important 
in planning adult transitional services so that affected 
individuals have continued access to the specialist 
services they need.
