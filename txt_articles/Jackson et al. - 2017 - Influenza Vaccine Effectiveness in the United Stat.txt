Abstract
BACKGROUND—The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strain used in the live attenuated influenza vaccine 
was changed for the 2015–2016 influenza season because of its lack of effectiveness in young 
children in 2013–2014. The Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network evaluated the effect of this 
change as part of its estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness in 2015–2016.
METHODS—We enrolled patients 6 months of age or older who presented with acute respiratory 
illness at ambulatory care clinics in geographically diverse U.S. sites. Using a test-negative design, 
we estimated vaccine effectiveness as (1 – OR) × 100, in which OR is the odds ratio for testing 
positive for influenza virus among vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants. Separate estimates 
were calculated for the inactivated vaccines and the live attenuated vaccine.
RESULTS—Among 6879 eligible participants, 1309 (19%) tested positive for influenza virus, 
predominantly for A(H1N1)pdm09 (11%) and influenza B (7%). The effectiveness of the 
influenza vaccine against any influenza illness was 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41 to 55; 
P<0.001). Among children 2 to 17 years of age, the inactivated influenza vaccine was 60% 
effective (95% CI, 47 to 70; P<0.001), and the live attenuated vaccine was not observed to be 
effective (vaccine effectiveness, 5%; 95% CI, −47 to 39; P = 0.80). Vaccine effectiveness against 
A(H1N1)pdm09 among children was 63% (95% CI, 45 to 75; P<0.001) for the inactivated 
vaccine, as compared with −19% (95% CI, −113 to 33; P = 0.55) for the live attenuated vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS—Influenza vaccines reduced the risk of influenza illness in 2015–2016. 
However, the live attenuated vaccine was found to be ineffective among children in a year with

 substantial inactivated vaccine effectiveness. Because the 2016–2017 A(H1N1)pdm09 strain used 
in the live attenuated vaccine was unchanged from 2015–2016, the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices made an interim recommendation not to use the live attenuated influenza 
vaccine for the 2016–2017 influenza season. (Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.)
The effectiveness of influenza vaccination and the corresponding effect of vaccination 
programs on the burden of influenza can vary considerably from year to year.1–4 In light of 
this variability, annual observational studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness are critical as 
ongoing evaluations of the value of influenza vaccination programs,5–7 as well as for 
identifying problems with licensed influenza vaccines. The Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 
Network provides estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness and of the cases of influenza 
averted by vaccination in the United States.3,4,8–10
A recent important finding of the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network,8 later confirmed 
by other studies,11,12 was that the quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine lacked 
effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in young children during the 2013–2014 
influenza season.8 This occurred in a season in which trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccines were effective at preventing influenza, indicating that the failure of the 
live attenuated vaccine was not due to a poor match between vaccines and circulating 
A(H1N1)pdm09 strains. This failure of the live attenuated vaccine was surprising, since 
earlier randomized trials had suggested that, among young children, the trivalent live 
attenuated vaccine provided protection against influenza that was superior to that provided 
by the trivalent inactivated vaccine.13,14 Poor thermostability of the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine 
strain was suspected as a possible cause, and the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain in the live 
attenuated vaccine was updated to A/Bolivia/559/2013 (an A/California/7/2009-like virus) 
for the 2015–2016 influenza season. Here, we report estimates of influenza vaccine 
effectiveness from the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network for the 2015–2016 influenza 
season, including comparisons of vaccine effectiveness between the trivalent and 
quadrivalent inactivated vaccines and the quadrivalent live attenuated vaccine.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
Details of the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network have been published 
previously.3,8–10 Study participants were recruited during the 2015–2016 influenza season 
(defined by local influenza surveillance) at study sites in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, 
Washington, and Wisconsin. Eligible participants were patients 6 months of age or older 
who presented to ambulatory care clinics for acute respiratory illness with a cough of 7 or 
fewer days in duration at the time of the medical visit. Patients who had received antiviral 
agents for their current illness, who were younger than 6 months of age as of September 1, 
2015, or who had enrolled in the study within the previous 14 days were ineligible. Study 
staff obtained informed consent from patients (or from a parent or guardian for minors) and 
interviewed the patients regarding demographic characteristics, influenza risk factors, health 
status, symptoms, and receipt of the influenza vaccine for the current season. Health 
conditions associated with an increased risk of severe influenza15 were defined on the basis

 of International Classification of Diseases codes assigned to medical encounters in the year 
before enrollment (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
INFLUENZA VACCINATION HISTORY
The virus strains recommended for the 2015–2016 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines 
were A/California/7/2009 (H1N1pdm09)–like, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)–like, 
B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) viruses, and (for quadrivalent vaccines) B/
Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage). Study staff reviewed the electronic 
immunization records for all participants to determine receipt of influenza vaccinations. 
Electronic immunization records varied among sites and included electronic health records, 
employee health records, and state immunization registries. During enrollment interviews, 
participants (or their parents or guardians) also provided information regarding whether they 
received an influenza vaccination for the current season, including information on vaccine 
type (nasal spray vs. injection) (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Influenza vaccination history for the current season was defined with the use of electronic 
immunization records and data reported by the participants, as described previously.8 
Vaccination status for the previous season was defined with the use of electronic 
immunization records.
LABORATORY METHODS
At enrollment, study staff obtained combined nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens 
(only nasal swab specimens were obtained for children younger than 2 years of age). 
Specimens were tested for influenza viruses with the use of real-time reverse-transcriptase 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).9 Specimens were first tested for any influenza A or B 
virus; subsequent assays identified influenza A virus subtype and influenza B virus lineage. 
Participants who tested positive for influenza were designated as case patients, and 
participants who tested negative were designated as non–case patients.
A subset of influenza virus–positive specimens was sent to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention for genetic characterization, antigenic characterization, or both. Full-length 
hemagglutinin sequences were obtained by means of whole-genome sequencing from 
original specimen samples.16 Viruses were classified into hemagglutinin genetic groups on 
the basis of phylogenetic analyses. In addition, A(H3N2) viruses were classified into 
hemagglutinin genetic groups by means of a pyrosequencing assay.17,18 Selected viruses 
from each clade or genetic group were grown to high titer and antigenically characterized by 
means of hemagglutination-inhibition or focus-reduction (for A[H3N2]) assays against the 
2015–2016 vaccine reference strains.19
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We excluded the following participants from the primary analyses: participants with 
inconclusive RT-PCR results, participants who had been vaccinated less than 14 days before 
illness onset (as reported by the participant), children younger than 9 years of age who were 
partially vaccinated according to the 2015–2016 Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (ACIP) recommendations,15 and non–case patients who were enrolled outside the

 periods of local influenza circulation. For the remaining participants, we calculated 
descriptive statistics separately for influenza case patients and non–case patients, including 
medians for continuous variables and distributions for categorical variables.
Influenza vaccine effectiveness was estimated with the use of a test-negative design, which 
compares the odds of testing positive for influenza virus among vaccinated versus 
unvaccinated participants.20,21 Following Jackson and Nelson,20 we considered vaccine 
effectiveness to be the relative difference in influenza risk between vaccinated and 
unvaccinated participants, expressed as a percentage and calculated as (1 – OR) × 100, 
where OR is the odds ratio for influenza among vaccinated persons as compared with 
unvaccinated persons, determined from logistic-regression models. The 95% confidence 
intervals for vaccine effectiveness were calculated as 1 – CIOR, is the confidence interval of 
the odds where CIOR ratio estimates. A priori, estimates were adjusted for network site, age 
(with the use of linear tail-restricted cubic splines), presence of high-risk medical conditions, 
and calendar time (in 2-week intervals). No additional covariates modified the estimated 
odds ratio by 5% or more, our predetermined inclusion threshold, so the final model 
included only the a priori covariates.
We estimated vaccine effectiveness for any influenza-associated illness and separately for 
illness due to influenza according to subtype or lineage. We also estimated vaccine 
effectiveness according to age group, vaccine type (overall and among children 2 to 17 years 
of age), and receipt of a vaccine for the 2014–2015 season (among participants ≥9 years of 
age). For the subtype-specific and lineage-specific estimates, case patients infected with 
other influenza virus subtypes or lineages were excluded. For vaccine type–specific 
estimates, participants who received other vaccine types were excluded. For all estimates, P 
values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.
To assess the potential for bias from excluding partially vaccinated children younger than 9 
years of age, we repeated the primary analyses (vaccine effectiveness overall and stratified 
according to age) with these children included. We estimated vaccine effectiveness while 
restricting the analysis to participants who enrolled less than 5 days after illness onset in 
order to identify bias resulting from potential false negative influenza virus test results 
among participants who presented 5 to 7 days after illness onset. We also estimated vaccine 
effectiveness using different definitions of vaccination: participant-reported vaccination only 
(excluding the Wisconsin site, where participant-reported history data were not collected) 
and electronic immunization records–confirmed vaccination only.
RESULTS
PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS
From November 2, 2015, through April 15, 2016, we enrolled 7563 patients who presented 
to ambulatory care clinics for acute respiratory illness. We excluded 684 participants (9%) 
from the primary analyses, including 10 participants with inconclusive RT-PCR results, 62 
participants who had been vaccinated less than 14 days before illness onset, 160 partially 
vaccinated children younger than 9 years of age, and 452 influenza virus–negative 
participants who enrolled outside the periods of influenza circulation. Of the remaining 6879

 eligible participants, 1309 (19%) tested positive for influenza virus (case patients), with the 
number of cases peaking in calendar week 10 (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
influenza case patients included 765 (58%) who were infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, 72 
(6%) infected with A(H3N2), 250 (19%) infected with B/Yamagata, 200 (15%) infected 
with B/Victoria, and 3 (<1%) coinfected with A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Yamagata (Table S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix); 16 were infected with influenza A virus but no subtype was 
determined, and 3 were infected with influenza B virus of undetermined lineage. A total of 
3396 participants (49%) were vaccinated 14 or more days before illness onset.
As compared with non–case patients, case patients were more likely to be 9 to 64 years of 
age, male, and black and non-Hispanic, to report “excellent” general health, and to have a 
shorter interval from illness onset to enrollment (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Case patients were less likely than non–case patients to be obese (body-mass 
index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], ≥30), to have a 
high-risk medical condition, or to have received influenza vaccine. Among non–case 
patients, those who had been vaccinated tended to be older, female, and white and non-
Hispanic and to have one or more high-risk medical conditions and an educational level of 
bachelor’s degree or higher (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
ANTIGENIC AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF VIRUSES
All antigenically characterized viruses — 67 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 16 A(H3N2) viruses, 
43 B/Yamagata viruses, and 47 B/Victoria viruses — were antigenically similar to the 
respective vaccine reference strains. Among the 73 genetically sequenced A(H1N1)pdm09 
viruses, 72 (99%) were of hemagglutinin genetic group 6B.1, and 1 (1%) was of group 6B. 
Among the 73 A(H3N2) viruses that were tested by sequencing or pyrosequencing, 34 
(47%) were of hemagglutinin group 3C.2a, and 39 (53%) were of group 3C.3a. Among the 
sequenced influenza B viruses, 33 of 34 B/Yamagata viruses (97%) belonged to clade 3, and 
all 35 B/Victoria viruses belonged to clade 1A.
OVERALL VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS
After adjustment for potential confounders, the estimated vaccine effectiveness against any 
influenza virus was 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41 to 55; P<0.001) (Fig. 1, and 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Significant vaccine effectiveness was observed in 
all age groups (with point estimates ranging from 26 to 59%; P≤0.04 for all estimates) and 
for each virus subtype or lineage (with point estimates ranging from 43 to 57%; P≤0.03 for 
all estimates) (Fig. 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among participants of 
all ages, significant vaccine effectiveness was observed for the inactivated influenza vaccine 
(P<0.001) but not for the quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (P=0.86) (Fig. 1).
VACCINE TYPE COMPARISONS
Among children 2 to 17 years of age, the risk of influenza was not significantly lower among 
those who received the quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine than among those who 
received no vaccine; the effectiveness of the vaccine in this group was not significant for the 
prevention of influenza overall (vaccine effectiveness, 5%; 95% CI, −47 to 39; P = 0.80), of 
A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza (vaccine effectiveness, −19%; 95% CI, −113 to 33; P = 0.55), or

 of influenza B (vaccine effectiveness, 18%; 95% CI, −52 to 56; P = 0.53) (Fig. 2, and Table 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In contrast, the risk of influenza was significantly lower 
among children who received any inactivated influenza vaccine than among those who 
received no vaccine; the effectiveness of the inactivated vaccine in this group was significant 
against influenza caused by any virus (vaccine effectiveness, 60%; 95% CI, 47 to 70; 
P<0.001), by A(H1N1)pdm09 (vaccine effectiveness, 63%; 95% CI, 45 to 75; P<0.001), and 
by influenza B virus (vaccine effectiveness, 54%; 95% CI, 31 to 69; P = 0.001). In a 
comparison between the 136 children (2 to 17 years of age) who received quadrivalent live 
attenuated vaccine and the 682 children who received the trivalent or quadrivalent 
inactivated vaccine, the live attenuated vaccine was associated with significantly higher odds 
of influenza (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.6; P<0.001) (Fig. 3).
Vaccine-effectiveness estimates tended to be higher for the quadrivalent inactivated vaccine 
than for the trivalent inactivated vaccine, both overall and when participants were stratified 
according to age group (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), but the differences were 
not significant. In a comparison between the 781 participants who received the standard-
dose trivalent inactivated vaccine and the 1885 who received the quadrivalent inactivated 
vaccine, the trivalent vaccine was not associated with significantly higher odds of influenza, 
either overall (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.7) or according to age group (Fig. 3). Against 
B/Victoria viruses, which were not included in the trivalent inactivated vaccine, we observed 
significantly higher vaccine effectiveness for the quadrivalent inactivated vaccine than for 
the trivalent vaccine (57% [95% CI, 36 to 71] vs. −99% [95% CI, −311 to 4]; P = 0.01 for 
the comparison).
EFFECTS OF PREVIOUS INFLUENZA VACCINATION
Against the A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Yamagata strains, 2015–2016 season vaccine 
effectiveness among participants 9 years of age or older was similar between patients who 
had also been vaccinated in the previous season (2014–2015) and those who had not (Fig. 4). 
Against B/Victoria, the estimate of 2015–2016 vaccine effectiveness was lower among 
participants who had been vaccinated in 2014–2015 than among participants who had not, 
although the difference was not significant (33% [95% CI, −8 to 58] vs. 62% [95% CI, 27 to 
80]; P = 0.10).
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
Our findings were robust to the method of determining influenza vaccination (participant 
report only, electronic immunization records plus plausible participant report, or electronic 
immunization records only) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). When the analysis 
was restricted to participants who enrolled less than 5 days after illness onset, the estimate of 
vaccine effectiveness was higher among adults 65 years of age or older than in the primary 
analysis population, although not significantly so (69% [95% CI, 42 to 83] vs. 42% [95% 
CI, 6 to 64]). In other age groups, restricting the analysis to participants who enrolled less 
than 5 days after illness onset did not meaningfully change the estimates of vaccine 
effectiveness. In the analysis of vaccine effectiveness among children younger than 18 years 
of age, the inclusion of partially vaccinated children did not change the estimates of 
effectiveness, either overall or according to vaccine type, by more than 4 percentage points.

 DISCUSSION
For the 2015–2016 influenza season, influenza vaccines were effective against influenza 
viruses in general and against A(H1N1)pdm09 in particular. The overall vaccine 
effectiveness was 48%, a finding consistent with other seasons in which vaccine virus strains 
were antigenically similar to circulating virus strains,3,8,9 and inactivated vaccines were 
effective against both A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and influenza B viruses. However, despite the 
change to the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain in the quadrivalent live attenuated vaccine,8 we again 
observed that this vaccine was not effective among children, particularly against 
A(H1N1)pdm09.
In June 2016, preliminary 2015–2016 vaccine-effectiveness estimates from the Influenza 
Vaccine Effectiveness Network and from several other observational studies were presented 
to the ACIP. In each of these studies, estimated vaccine effectiveness against 
A(H1N1)pdm09 was lower for the live attenuated vaccine than for the inactivated vaccine. 
Preliminary estimates from the Department of Defense for children 2 to 17 years of age 
indicated a nonsignificant vaccine effectiveness of 15% for the quadrivalent live attenuated 
vaccine against A(H1N1)pdm09, as compared with a significant 68% effectiveness for the 
trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated vaccine.22 The Influenza Clinical Investigation for 
Children (ICICLE) study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01997450) estimated vaccine 
effectiveness among children 2 to 17 years of age at study sites in eight U.S. states. For 
A(H1N1)pdm09, the interim results of that study showed a non-significant vaccine 
effectiveness of 50% for the quadrivalent live attenuated vaccine and a significant vaccine 
effectiveness of 71% for the trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated vaccine.23 A Finnish cohort 
study involving 2-year-old children showed a significant vaccine effectiveness against 
influenza A — predominantly against A(H1N1)pdm09 — of 48% for the quadrivalent live 
attenuated vaccine and 80% for the trivalent inactivated vaccine.24 Finally, a U.K. study 
involving children 2 to 17 years of age showed a non-significant vaccine effectiveness of 
42% against A(H1N1)pdm09 for the quadrivalent live attenuated vaccine, as compared with 
an effectiveness of 100% for the trivalent inactivated vaccine.25 In light of these data, the 
ACIP made an interim recommendation not to use the quadrivalent live attenuated vaccine in 
the United States for the 2016–2017 influenza season.26
Although these observational studies consistently showed lower effectiveness for the live 
attenuated vaccine than for the inactivated vaccine, point estimates for the effectiveness of 
the live attenuated vaccine varied widely among studies. The reasons for this are unclear. 
The quadrivalent live attenuated vaccines in the United States, Finland, and the United 
Kingdom were all produced by the same manufacturer at the same plant,24 so it is unlikely 
that differences in estimated vaccine effectiveness are due to variations in the vaccine 
product. The observed variations could be due to chance, since the vaccine-effectiveness 
point estimates for all five studies have relatively wide confidence intervals. Vaccination 
history among children probably differs between populations in the U.S. and European 
studies. In the United States, children following the ACIP recommendations would have 
received at least one dose of inactivated influenza vaccine before 2 years of age and the 
quadrivalent live attenuated vaccine thereafter.27 In contrast, the Joint Committee on 
Vaccination and Immunisation in the United Kingdom recommends influenza vaccination

 beginning at 2 years of age for healthy children, using the quadrivalent live attenuated 
vaccine, and the Finnish study predominantly included children who had never received an 
influenza vaccine. Thus, children in the U.S. studies differed from their European 
counterparts in the number of previous influenza vaccine doses received and in the 
formulation of their first vaccinations. None of these studies was well-powered to examine 
differences in vaccine effectiveness according to vaccination history, so it is difficult to 
explore this in more detail. This is not a complete explanation, since discrepant results were 
also seen among the U.S. studies, which may have similar populations with regard to 
previous vaccination.
Other findings from this study merit comment. With the exception of the quadrivalent live 
attenuated vaccine in children, the 2015–2016 influenza vaccines were effective in persons 
of all ages and against all circulating virus subtypes and lineages. Some studies have 
suggested that previous-season vaccination inhibits the effectiveness of the vaccine for the 
current season. As in previous seasons investigated by the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 
Network, we found that vaccine effectiveness among participants who had been vaccinated 
in the previous season was lower than that among those who had not been vaccinated in the 
previous season, although the difference was not significant.3,8,9 We also found that the 
quadrivalent inactivated vaccine was significantly more effective than the trivalent 
inactivated vaccine against B/Victoria viruses, which were not included in the 2015–2016 
trivalent vaccine. In some previous seasons, the trivalent inactivated vaccine has been seen to 
protect against both B lineages.3 Our finding of superior vaccine effectiveness of the 
quadrivalent relative to the trivalent inactivated vaccine against B/Victoria suggests that 
switching to the quadrivalent inactivated vaccine may indeed prevent more cases of 
influenza B than the trivalent vaccine during some seasons; this idea needs to be tested.
Several limitations of our study should be considered. As with any observational study, we 
cannot rule out unmeasured confounding as an explanation for our findings. In addition, the 
test-negative design is still comparatively new. This design may be subject to biases that are 
not fully understood,28–31 although it is unlikely that these biases would be differential 
between the live attenuated vaccine and the inactivated vaccine. Our overall study population 
was large, but the study lacked power to estimate vaccine effectiveness precisely in certain 
subgroups of interest, particularly when participants were stratified according to both age 
and influenza virus subtype or lineage. Strengths of this study include the prospective 
screening and enrollment of participants meeting predefined clinical criteria, the 
geographically diverse study sites, and the use of a highly specific test for influenza virus.32 
In addition, our findings were robust to a wide range of assumptions regarding study 
eligibility, choice of variables to include in adjusted vaccine-effectiveness models, and 
definition of vaccination status.
During the 2015–2016 influenza season, the quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine 
was found to be ineffective against A(H1N1)pdm09 in children, whereas there was 
substantial effectiveness of the inactivated influenza vaccine. Potential explanations for the 
live attenuated vaccine having lower effectiveness than the inactivated vaccine in this group 
remain unclear but may include poor replicative fitness of its A(H1N1)pdm09 strains or 
vaccine-virus interference.33 Although the quadrivalent live attenuated vaccine remains

 Figure 1. Adjusted Estimates of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness, Overall and Stratified 
According to Age, Virus Subtype or Lineage, and Vaccine Type
In each subgroup, the number of case patients is the number of participants in that subgroup 
who tested positive for influenza virus; the total number in each subgroup is the number of 
participants in the subgroup who tested positive or negative. For the analysis according to 
virus subtype or lineage, the total number included all patients who tested negative plus all 
those who tested positive for the subtype or lineage of interest, with the exception that 
participants from the Wisconsin site were excluded from the analysis of A(H3N2). Vaccine 
effectiveness was calculated as (1 – OR) × 100, in which OR is the odds ratio for testing 
positive for influenza virus among vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants in each 
subgroup. Horizontal bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. IIV denotes inactivated 
influenza vaccine, IIV3 trivalent IIV, IIV4 quadrivalent IIV, and LAIV4 quadrivalent live 
attenuated influenza vaccine.

 Figure 2. Adjusted Estimates of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness among Children 2 to 17 Years of 
Age, Overall and Stratified According to Virus Subtype or Lineage and Vaccine Type
In each subgroup, the number of case patients is the number of children 2 to 17 years of age 
who tested positive for influenza virus (or for the type or subtype of interest, in the 
subgroups that are based on these factors); the total number includes unvaccinated children 
who tested negative for influenza virus, children vaccinated with the relevant vaccine type 
who tested negative for influenza virus, and children who were vaccinated with the relevant 
vaccine and tested positive for influenza virus (or for the type or subtype of interest, in the 
subgroups that are based on these factors). Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1 – OR) 
× 100, in which OR is the odds ratio for testing positive for influenza virus among 
vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants in each subgroup. Horizontal bars indicate 95% 
confidence intervals.

 Figure 4. Adjusted Estimates of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness, Stratified According to Receipt 
of Vaccines for the Current Season (2015–2016) and Previous Season (2014–2015)
In each subgroup, the number of case patients is the number of participants with the 
specified vaccination history who tested positive for the relevant influenza virus subtype or 
lineage; the total number in each subgroup is the number of participants with the specified 
vaccination history who tested negative for influenza or tested positive for the specified 
subtype or lineage. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1 – OR) × 100, in which OR is 
the odds ratio for testing positive for influenza virus among participants who were 
vaccinated in the season or seasons of interest versus participants who received no 
vaccination in either season (the reference group). Horizontal bars indicate 95% confidence 
intervals.
