IMPORTANCE Inflammation is important in colorectal cancer development. Diet modulates
inflammation and may thus be a crucial modifiable factor in colorectal cancer prevention.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether proinflammatory diets are associated with increased
colorectal cancer risk by using an empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) score based
on a weighted sum of 18 food groups that characterizes dietary inflammatory potential based
on circulating levels of inflammation biomarkers.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort study of 46 804 men (Health Professionals
Follow-up Study: 1986-2012) and 74 246 women (Nurses’ Health Study: 1984-2012) followed
for 26 years to examine associations between EDIP scores and colorectal cancer risk using
Cox regression. We also examined associations in categories of alcohol intake and body
weight. Data analysis began January 17, 2017, and was completed August 9, 2017.
EXPOSURES EDIP scores calculated from food frequency questionnaires administered every
4 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident colorectal cancer.
RESULTS We documented 2699 incident colorectal cancer cases over 2 571 831 person-years
of follow-up. Compared with participants in the lowest EDIP quintile (Q) who had a colorectal
cancer incidence rate (per 100 000 person-years) of 113 (men) and 80 (women), those in the
highest Q had an incidence rate of 151 (men) and 92 (women), leading to an unadjusted rate
difference of 38 and 12 more colorectal cancer cases, respectively, among those consuming
highly proinflammatory diets. Comparing participants in the highest vs lowest EDIP Qs in
multivariable-adjusted analyses, higher EDIP scores were associated with 44% (men: hazard
ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.74; P < .001 for trend), 22% (women: HR, 1.22; 95% CI,
1.02-1.45; P = .007 for trend), and 32% (men and women: pooled HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12-1.55;
P < .001 for trend) higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. In both men and women,
associations were observed in all anatomic subsites except for the rectum in women. In
subgroups (P � .02 for all interactions), associations differed by alcohol intake level, with
stronger associations among men (Q5 vs Q1 HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.05-2.49; P = .002 for trend)
and women (Q5 vs Q1 HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.97-1.81; P = .03 for trend) not consuming alcohol;
and by body weight, with stronger associations among overweight/obese men (Q5 vs Q1 HR,
1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.94; P = .008 for trend) and lean women (Q5 vs Q1 HR, 1.31; 95% CI,
0.99-1.74; P = .01 for trend).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Findings suggest that inflammation is a potential mechanism
linking dietary patterns and colorectal cancer development. Interventions to reduce the
adverse role of proinflammatory diets may be more effective among overweight/obese men
and lean women or men and women who do not consume alcohol.

olorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed
cancerinbothmenandwomenintheUnitedStates.1In-
flammation plays an important role in cancer develop-
ment, including colorectal cancer.2,3 Though epidemiological
studies have not consistently reported significant associations
betweenprediagnosislevelsofwidelyusedinflammatorymark-
ers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), and colorectal cancer risk,4
there is plausible evidence that inflammation plays an impor-
tant role in colorectal cancer development. For example, obe-
sity, a state of low-grade chronic inflammation,5 has been
associated with colorectal cancer risk.6 Chronic inflammation
mayalsocontributetoinsulinresistanceandhyperinsulinemia,
which are associated with colon cancer risk. Also, chronic
inflammation has been implicated as a key predisposing
factortocolorectalcancerininflammatoryboweldisease.7Fur-
thermore, several studies have shown that the use of anti-
inflammatorymedications,suchasaspirin,canreducecolorec-
talcancerdevelopment.8Interventionstudieshaveshownthat
diet modulates inflammation9,10; therefore, dietary patterns
with higher inflammatory potential may influence colorectal
cancer risk.
There are likely complex added effects and interactions of
multiple foods and nutrients in diet. Furthermore, a change
in the intakes of specific foods or nutrients is associated with
changes in the intake of other foods and nutrients. Studies of
single nutrients and foods do not account for complex inter-
actions inherent in whole diets.11 Therefore, the examination
of whole diets or dietary patterns in relation to disease out-
comes is an appealing approach that has been adopted in many
studies in nutritional epidemiology. To elucidate the role of di-
etary inflammatory potential in colorectal cancer develop-
ment, we investigated the association between a previously
developed empirical food-based dietary inflammatory pat-
tern score12 with colorectal cancer risk in 2 prospective co-
hort studies, 1 of men and 1 of women. We further examined
potential differences of this association in subgroups of fac-
tors that have been linked with colorectal cancer risk, includ-
ing alcohol intake and body weight.
Methods
Study Population
We used data from 2 ongoing prospective cohorts: The Nurses'
Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up
Study (HPFS). The NHS recruited 121 701 registered female
nurses ages 30 to 55 years at baseline in 1976, and the HPFS
enrolled 51 529 male health professionals ages 40 to 75 years
at baseline in 1986 in the United States. In both cohorts, ques-
tionnaires were sent at baseline and every 2 years thereafter
tocollectandupdatedemographic,lifestyle,medical,andother
health-related information.13,14 Every 4 years, participants re-
ceived validated semiquantitative food frequency question-
naires (FFQ) for dietary assessments.15
For the current study, we excluded participants who re-
ported any cancer except nonmelanoma skin cancer, who did
not complete an FFQ during follow-up or who had implau-
sible values for total energy intake (<600 or >3500 kcal/d for
women and <800 or >4200 kcal/d for men) at study entry. This
resulted in the inclusion of 74 246 women from the NHS and
46 804 men from the HPFS for a total of 121 050 participants.
The institutional review boards at Brigham and Women’s
Hospital and at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health
approved this study.
Assessment of the Empirical Dietary Inflammatory
Pattern Score and Other Covariates
The development of the empirical dietary inflammatory pat-
tern (EDIP) score in a sample of 5230 women in the Nurses’
Health Study has been previously described.12 The goal was
to empirically create a score for overall inflammatory poten-
tial of whole diets defined using food groups. Briefly, 39 pre-
defined food groups16 were entered into reduced-rank regres-
sion models followed by stepwise linear regression analyses
to identify a dietary pattern most predictive of 3 plasma mark-
ers of inflammation: IL-6, CRP, and TNFRSF1B (TNF receptor
superfamily 1B, so-called TNF-α receptor 2, or TNF-R2).12 The
EDIP score is the weighted sum of 18 food groups and as-
sesses the inflammatory potential of diet on a continuum from
maximally anti-inflammatory to maximally proinflamma-
tory. That is, lower (more negative) scores indicate anti-
inflammatory diets and higher (more positive) scores indi-
cate proinflammatory diets. The EDIP score was evaluated for
validity in independent samples of men and women using di-
etary and inflammatory biomarker data from the HPFS
(n = 2632) and Nurses’ Health Study-II (NHS-II [n = 1002]).12
A subsequent study that used data from a much larger sample
of men in HPFS (n = 5227) and women in NHS-II (n = 5826) to
compare the inflammation predictive ability of the EDIP score
and a previously developed literature-derived nutrient-
based dietary inflammatory index,17 showed that the EDIP had
a higher ability to predict concentrations of CRP, TNFRSF1B,
and ADIPOQ (adiponectin).18
The component food groups comprising the EDIP score are
thefollowing:intakesofprocessedmeat,redmeat,organmeat,
fish(otherthandark-meatfish),othervegetables(ie,vegetables
other than green leafy vegetables and dark yellow vegetables),
refined grains, high-energy beverages (cola and other carbon-
ated beverages with sugar, fruit drinks), low-energy beverages
(low-energy cola and other low-energy carbonated beverages),
Key Points
Questions Do proinflammatory dietary patterns increase the risk
of developing colorectal cancer?
Findings In this cohort study that followed 121 050 adults for 26
years, intake of proinflammatory diets as evidenced by higher
scores on an empirical dietary inflammatory pattern score was
associated with a significantly higher risk of developing colorectal
cancer in both men and women.
Meaning Inflammation is a potential mechanism linking dietary
patterns and colorectal cancer development, and strategies to
reduce the adverse role of a proinflammatory diet may reduce
colorectal cancer risk.

 and tomatoes were positively related to concentrations of the
inflammatory markers. Intakes of beer, wine, tea, coffee, dark
yellowvegetables(comprisingcarrots,yellowsquash,andsweet
potatoes), green leafy vegetables, snacks, fruit juice, and pizza
were inversely related to concentrations of the inflammatory
markers.12WecalculatedEDIPscoresforeachparticipantbased
on self-administered FFQ data in eight 4-year data cycles from
1984 to 2010 in the NHS and in seven 4-year data cycles from
1986 to 2010 in the HPFS.
Self-administered questionnaires were sent to partici-
pants biennially to assess medical and lifestyles factors, in-
cluding smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, multivita-
min use, endoscopy status, regular use of aspirin and other
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), family his-
tory of colorectal cancer, weight, height, menopausal status,
and postmenopausal hormone use (only for women), in both
cohorts as previously described.16,19,20
Colorectal Cancer Ascertainment
Participants reported new colorectal cancer diagnoses on each
biennial questionnaire. For self-reported cases, as well as co-
lorectal cancer-related deaths identified through family mem-
bersortheUSNationalDeathIndex,21weobtainedmedicalrec-
ords related to the diagnoses. When we were unable to obtain
medical records (approximately 10% of cases), we linked to the
appropriate cancer registry to confirm the diagnosis. A pa-
thologist reviewed medical records to confirm the diagnoses.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated person-years of follow-up from the return date
of the first FFQ until the date of death, any cancer diagnosis
(except nonmelanoma skin cancer), or end of follow-up (June
1, 2012, for NHS and January 31, 2012, for HPFS), whichever
was earliest. EDIP scores were calculated as the cumulative av-
erage score from all prior reports up to the start of each 2-year
follow-up interval to best represent habitual long-term di-
etary intake and reduce within-person variation. We ad-
justed EDIP scores for total energy intake using the residual
method.22 Owing to the high within-individual correlations in
EDIP scores between adjacent data cycles, we carried for-
ward non–missing dietary intake data from the previous data
cycle to replace missing data in the next cycle. Covariate data
were treated similarly.
We used Cox proportional hazards regression models with
time-varyingcovariatestoestimatehazardratios(HR)and95%
CIs for EDIP scores in relation to colorectal cancer risk, with
the lowest EDIP quintile as the reference group. We exam-
ined proportionality of hazards for each covariate included in
the Cox models using time × covariate interaction terms and
found no violations (all P > .05). Early symptoms of undiag-
nosedcolorectalcancermayalterhabitualdietaryintake;there-
fore, to address this potential issue, we used a 2-year lag be-
tween dietary assessment and colorectal cancer incidence as
the main analytic approach. For example, in NHS, we used cu-
mulative average EDIP scores from 1986 to 1990 as the expo-
sure for the follow-up period from 1992 to 1994 and cumula-
tive average score from 1986 to 1994 for follow-up from 1996
to 1998, etc. All analyses were stratified by age in months and
calendar year of the current questionnaire. Multivariable mod-
els were adjusted for risk factors for colorectal cancer, most
of which were updated biennially. These included race, fam-
ily history of cancer, history of endoscopy, multivitamin
use, alcohol intake, physical activity, pack-years of smoking,
regular aspirin use, regular NSAID use, and additionally for
menopausal status and postmenopausal hormone use in
women. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared) and diabetes are
possible intermediates in the association of dietary inflamma-
tory potential and colorectal cancer risk; therefore, we did not
adjust for BMI and diabetes in the main analyses but addition-
ally adjusted for these 2 covariates in sensitivity analyses. For
analyses of linear trend across EDIP quintiles, we assigned the
median EDIP score for each quintile to all participants in the
quintile. We then pooled the sex-specific HR and correspond-
ing standard errors using random effects meta-analyses meth-
ods to calculate the association between EDIP scores and risk
of colorectal cancer combining men and women and tested for
heterogeneity of risk estimates by sex using the likelihood ra-
tio test. Also, we used duplication method cause-specific Cox
models23 to test for heterogeneity by anatomic location (proxi-
mal colon, distal colon, and rectum).
We used the likelihood ratio test to test for potential ef-
fect modification by comparing models with and without the
interaction term of the EDIP score and potential effect modi-
fier (ie, 1 degree of freedom). Potential effect modifiers
included were total alcohol intake (no drink/d, 0.1 to 1 drink/d,
and >1 drink day), and body weight (BMI, <25 vs ≥25). All analy-
ses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 for UNIX
(SAS Institute), all P values were 2-sided, and significance was
set at .05.
Results
Over the entire follow-up period in both cohorts (26 years in
NHS and 24 years in HPFS), participants consuming the most
proinflammatory diets (EDIP quintile 5) reported lower physi-
cal activity, higher BMI, and were more likely to have diabe-
tes. They were also less likely to be using multivitamins and
reported lower intakes of dietary fiber, dietary calcium, and
whole grains, than those consuming the most anti-
inflammatory diets (EDIP quintile 1) (Table 1).
We documented 2699 cases of incident colorectal cancer
(1441 in women and 1258 in men) over 2 571 831 person-years
offollow-up.ComparedwithmeninthelowestfifthoftheEDIP
score, who had a colorectal cancer incidence rate of 113 per

dence rate of 151 per 100 000 person-years, leading to an un-
adjusted rate difference of 38 more cases of colorectal cancer

pared with women in the lowest EDIP quintile, who had a co-

years, women in the highest quintile had an incidence rate of
92 per 100 000 person years, leading to an unadjusted rate dif-
ference of 12 more cases of colorectal cancer in women con-

 the minimally adjusted model that included only age, alco-
hol intake, and calendar year of current questionnaire were
similar to the multivariable-adjusted results (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).Comparingparticipantsinthehighestvsthelow-
est EDIP quintile in multivariable-adjusted analyses, colorec-
tal cancer risk was 44% higher in men (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-
1.74; P < .001 for trend), 22% higher in women (HR, 1.22; 95%

women combined (pooled HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12-1.55; P < .001
fortrend)(Table2).Inbothmenandwomen,associationswere
observed in all anatomic locations, except for the rectum in
women. Pooled HRs comparing men and women in the high-
est EDIP quintile to those in the lowest quintile were 1.35 (95%
CI, 1.16-1.56; P < .001 for trend) for overall colon cancer, 1.38
(95% CI, 1.13-1.68; P < .001 for trend) for proximal colon can-
cer, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.14-1.86; P = .002 for trend) for distal colon
cancer and 1.19 (95% CI, 0.60-2.38; P= .53 for trend) for rectal
cancer. There was significant heterogeneity (P = .03) in rectal
cancer risk between men (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.14-2.54; P < .001
for trend) and women (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.57-1.24; P = .57 for
trend) (Table 2). Further adjusting for BMI and diabetes did not
materially change the results (eTable 2 in the Supplement). We
have provided the full multivariable-adjusted model sepa-
rately for women and men in eTable 3 in the Supplement.
In subgroups defined by BMI categories and alcohol in-
take levels, there were significant differences (P ≤ .02 for all
interactions) in the association between dietary inflamma-
tory potential and colorectal cancer risk for both men and
women (Table 3). There was a 48% higher risk (HR,1.48; 95%
CI, 1.12-1.94; P= .004 for trend) among overweight or obese
men consuming the most proinflammatory diets (quintile 5)
and an indication for higher risk in other quintiles compared
with the lowest quintile (though this did not attain statistical
significance). Though risk was also elevated among lean men,
the difference between lean and overweight/obese men was
significant (P = .01 for interaction). In contrast, risk was el-
evated among lean women (HR,1.31; 95% CI, 0.99-1.74; P = .01
for trend) but not among overweight or obese women. Differ-
ences were more pronounced by alcohol intake levels. Com-
paring extreme EDIP quintiles, there was a 62% higher risk of
colorectal cancer among men (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.05-2.49;
P = .002 for trend) and a 33% higher risk among women (HR,
1.33; 95% CI, 0.97-1.81; P = .03 for trend) not consuming
alcohol. This association was weaker among men and women
consuming any amount of alcohol (Table 3).
Discussion
We conducted a large prospective study in men and women,
using a food-based dietary index—the EDIP score—to charac-
terize the inflammatory potential of diet and elucidate its role

tial was associated with higher risk of developing colorectal
cancer in men and women. In both men and women, associa-

was even higher among overweight or obese men and lean
women and among men and women not consuming alcohol.

a EDIP scores were adjusted for total energy intake using the residual method.
Lower scores indicate anti-inflammatory diets, whereas higher scores indicate
proinflammatory diets. Heterogeneity for risk by anatomic subsite (P
heterogeneity = .84 in men and .10 in women) was tested using duplication
method cause-specific Cox regression analyses. All analyses were adjusted for
the following potential confounding variables: age (months) calendar year of
current questionnaire, race (white, nonwhite); family history of cancer (yes,
no); history of endoscopy (yes, no); multivitamin use (yes, no); alcohol intake
(continuous, g/d); physical activity (continuous, Metabolic Equivalent of Task
h/wk); pack-years of smoking (continuous); regular aspirin use (yes, no); and
regular NSAIDs use (yes, no); and additionally for menopausal status
(premenopausal, postmenopausal) and postmenopausal hormone use (yes,
no) in women.
bQuintile 1 is the reference for comparisons.
c The P value for linear trend was obtained using EDIP quintile medians as an
ordinal variable adjusted for age (months) calendar year of current
questionnaire, race, family history of cancer, history of endoscopy,
multivitamin use, alcohol intake, physical activity, pack-years of smoking,
regular aspirin use, regular NSAIDs use, and for menopausal status and
postmenopausal hormone use in women.
dHazard ratios for men and women were pooled using random effects
meta-analyses, and the likelihood ratio test was used to test for heterogeneity
in risk between men and women for each anatomic subsite. The difference in
risk by sex for the rectum was significant (P = .03 for heterogeneity). All other
P values for heterogeneity by sex were greater than .36.

 The differences by body weight category may partly underlie
the differences by sex observed for rectal cancer risk; whereas
the differences by alcohol intake category may indicate that
the influence of alcohol on colorectal cancer risk through
mechanisms other than inflammation, may be stronger than
that of its effects on the EDIP.
Previous studies24,25 have used a literature-derived nu-
trient-based dietary inflammatory index17,26 to examine the
association of dietary inflammatory potential and colorectal
cancer risk. Given that the nutrient-based index scores are in-
fluenced by nutritional supplements,27,28 findings from these
previous studies that are directly comparable to the current
study results are from studies that calculated the nutrient-
based index scores from food sources only (ie, without includ-
ing supplements). In a study conducted using data from the
Iowa Women’s Health Study,28 there was a statistically signifi-
cant 20% higher risk of colorectal cancer (HR, 1.20; 95% CI,
1.01-1.43;comparingextremeEDIPquintiles)thatbecamenon-
significant when supplements were excluded (HR, 1.12; 95%
CI, 0.90-1.38; comparing extreme EDIP quintiles). However,
in a study conducted using data from the Multiethnic Cohort
with the inclusion of 190 963 men and women and 4388 co-
lorectal cancer cases diagnosed during up to approximately 20
years of follow-up, investigators calculated the nutrient-
based index scores from foods sources only, and found sig-
nificantassociationswithcolorectalcancerriskasfollows(com-
paring participants in quintile 5 vs 1): 21% higher risk in men
andwomencombined,28%higherriskinmen,and16%higher
risk in women. These results align with findings in the cur-
rentstudy,thoughwefoundstrongerassociationswiththeem-
pirically derived food-based score.
Itisnotentirelyclearwhyassociationsforrectalcancerwere
stronger in men than in women but are unlikely to be due to
chancegiventhelargesignificantheterogeneitybysex.Though
mostriskfactorsforcolorectalcancerarecommonbetweenmen
andwomen,thepatternofriskdiffers.Forexample,higherbody
weight strongly predisposes men to higher risk of proximal co-
lon cancer, distal colon cancer, and rectal cancer, and predis-
poses women to mainly higher risk of distal colon cancer but
notrectalcancer.29,30Also,early-lifeobesityseemstobethepri-
mary risk factor for colorectal cancer in women, whereas for
men, adult weight gain rather than early life, predominates.31
This pattern may be due to differences in sex hormones, given
that in men and postmenopausal women, estrogen is pro-
duced mainly in fat tissue.32 In women, a high estrogen:
testosteroneratioisprotectiveagainstcolorectalcancerriskbut
in men it may have an adverse effect.33,34 Regarding differ-
ences by alcohol intake, high intake of alcohol has been asso-
ciated with higher risk of cancer, including colorectal cancer,
in both men and women.6 It is possible that the adverse effects
ofalcoholintakethroughothermechanismsmaybemoredomi-
nant than those of its effect on the EDIP and may partially
explain the stronger associations among men and women not
consuming alcohol than among alcohol consumers.
Strengths and Limitations
Major strengths of our study include the use of a food-based
EDIP score that is correlated with levels of inflammatory mark-

fied by levels of other colorectal cancer risk factors. We also
had comprehensive information on diet and important covar-
iates, which reduces the potential for residual confounding,
and the data were prospectively collected, thus reducing the
potential for recall bias. Also, dietary and covariate data were
assessed at multiple times throughout follow-up, which al-
lowed us to use long-term cumulative average exposures, thus
reducing within-person variation. To reduce potential re-

tern may be associated with other factors not included in the

we adjusted for several potential confounding variables, we
cannot completely rule out confounding by unmeasured
variables.
Conclusions
Findings from this large prospective study support a role for
the inflammatory potential of diet in colorectal cancer devel-
opment, suggesting inflammation as a potential mechanism
linking dietary patterns and colorectal cancer development.
Strategies to reduce the adverse role of a proinflammatory di-
etarypatternincolorectalcancerdevelopmentmayhavehigher
benefits among overweight or obese men and among lean
women or among men and women not consuming alcohol.
