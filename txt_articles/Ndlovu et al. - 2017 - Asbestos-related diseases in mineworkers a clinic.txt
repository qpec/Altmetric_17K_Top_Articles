ABSTRACT
The accurate diagnosis of asbestos-related diseases is important because of past and current
asbestos exposures. This study evaluated the reliability of clinical diagnoses of asbestos-related diseases in
former mineworkers using autopsies as the reference standard.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated.
The 149 cases identified had clinical examinations 0.3–7.4 years before death. More asbestos-related
diseases were diagnosed at autopsy rather than clinically: 77 versus 52 for asbestosis, 27 versus 14 for
mesothelioma and 22 versus 3 for lung cancer. Sensitivity and specificity values for clinical diagnoses were
50.6% and 81.9% for asbestosis, 40.7% and 97.5% for mesothelioma, and 13.6% and 100.0% for lung
cancer. False-negative diagnoses of asbestosis were more likely using radiographs of acceptable (versus
good) quality and in cases with pulmonary tuberculosis at autopsy.
The low sensitivity values are indicative of the high proportion of false-negative diagnoses. It is unlikely
that these were the result of disease manifestation between the last clinical assessment and autopsy. Where
clinical features suggest asbestos-related diseases but the chest radiograph is negative, more sophisticated
imaging techniques or immunohistochemistry for asbestos-related cancers should be used. Autopsies are
useful for the detection of previously undiagnosed and misdiagnosed asbestos-related diseases, and for
monitoring clinical practice and delivery of compensation.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL LUNG DISEASE
 Introduction
This study compared clinical and autopsy findings for three asbestos-related diseases (asbestosis,
mesothelioma and lung cancer) in former asbestos mineworkers, and explored factors that influenced
agreement between clinical and autopsy findings using data from two compensation systems. In South
Africa, statutory compensation for occupational lung diseases in mineworkers makes provisions for autopsy
examinations of the cardio-respiratory organs at the National Institute for Occupational Health (NIOH) in
Johannesburg [1]. In addition, the Johannesburg-based Asbestos Relief Trust and Kgalagadi Relief Trust (the
“Trusts”) compensate individuals with defined asbestos-related diseases who worked in or lived near
qualifying asbestos mining or processing operations [2]. The Trusts also compensate dependents of deceased
qualifying mineworkers and therefore encourage statutory autopsies for the detection of previously
undiagnosed asbestos-related disease or disease that may have progressed to higher compensation grades.
South Africa was the third largest producer of asbestos and cumulatively produced 97% of the world’s
crocidolite [3]. It is among 57 countries that have banned the mining and/or use of all types of asbestos
[4]. However, past and current occupational exposures, and nonoccupational domestic and neighbourhood
exposures in communities living near asbestos operations, have resulted in a global asbestos-related disease
pandemic [5, 6].
The reliability of the clinical diagnosis of asbestos-related diseases continues to be important given the
large numbers of affected individuals, projections that the asbestos-related disease epidemic is yet to reach
its peak and the significant underreporting of asbestos-related diseases [5, 7, 8]. In many parts of the
world, benign asbestos-related diseases are often diagnosed based on history, clinical features and chest
radiology alone, despite evidence showing that the chest radiograph is inadequate for diagnosis [9, 10].
Similarities between the presenting features of asbestosis and those of other types of diffuse interstitial
fibrosis contribute to this unreliability [9, 11]. The malignant diseases, mainly mesothelioma and lung
cancer, require histological and immunohistochemical confirmation as their radiological appearance may
be misleading [9, 12–14]. In addition, metastases and infections, such as tuberculosis, may mimic the
appearance of mesothelioma and result in misdiagnosis.
Few recent studies have validated chest imaging findings for asbestos-related diseases using the autopsy as
the reference standard (table 1). The chest radiograph was shown to underestimate asbestosis and,
conversely, to overestimate it when readers were aware of previous asbestos exposure [15, 16]. AKIRA et al.

 asbestos-related lung cancer. However, one study showed that radiology alone detected fewer cases of lung
cancer than when used in conjunction with HRCT and cytology [14].
Materials and methods
Study subjects
This retrospective, consecutive case series included the records of all former asbestos mineworkers who
were clinically examined by the Trusts and had autopsy examinations at the NIOH in 2010 and 2011. No
mineworker had occupational asbestos exposure after the clinical evaluation for asbestos-related diseases.
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of the Witwatersrand, Human Research
Ethics Committee (M120236) and the University of Michigan Health Sciences and Behavioural Sciences
Institutional Review Board (HUM00069012).
Clinical assessment of asbestos-related diseases
Clinical diagnoses were made by the Trusts’ Specialist Occupational Medical Panel (SOMP) that consisted
of two radiologists and four occupational medical specialists, three of whom were current or former
University of Cape Town medical professors. The SOMP was experienced with occupational lung diseases,
and the reading and interpretation of computed tomography images and chest radiographs using the
International Labour Office (ILO) classification of chest radiographs [21]. At each session, cases were
evaluated by two members of the SOMP (a radiologist and an occupational medical specialist). If the
SOMP could not reach a diagnosis, further clinical testing was requested and where there was uncertainty
the case was referred to the SOMP Forum, which consisted of all six panellists, for certification.
Posterior–anterior chest radiographs were read according to the ILO methodology, and radiograph quality
and any significant radiological changes or abnormalities were recorded [21]. Asbestosis was considered in
individuals with small, bilateral irregular linear parenchymal opacities classified as s, t or u of profusion
⩾1/0 in the lower zones of the lungs (with or without extension into the middle and upper zones) [21].
The cut-point of 1/0 was used to distinguish radiographs that were positive for asbestosis from those that
were negative [22]. Individuals with radiological features were diagnosed with asbestosis if they had an
appropriate occupational history and latency period, clinical findings consistent with asbestosis, and the
absence of competing explanations for the observed radiological changes, in accordance with the
guidelines of the American Thoracic Society [22]. Chest radiograph quality was categorised according to
the ILO criteria for the classification of pneumoconiosis as good, where all criteria were met; acceptable,
with few technical defects; acceptable, with defects but still adequate; or unreadable [21]. Only clinical
asbestosis cases with good or acceptable radiographs were included in the analyses.
Malignant pleural mesothelioma and lung cancer were diagnosed in individuals with suggestive clinical
and radiological findings, usually followed by biopsy of the lesion and confirmation by histology, including
immunohistochemistry where available.
Pathological assessment of asbestos-related diseases
The cardio-respiratory organs were removed with consent at the site where mineworkers died, placed in
formalin and sent to the NIOH for examination by specialist anatomical pathologists. The nature and
extent of occupational lung diseases, including asbestos-related diseases, were recorded and captured on
the Pathology Automation (PATHAUT) database [23].
The presence of asbestos-related diseases was determined by pathological examination of the lungs according
to a standard protocol. Slices of lung tissue (1 cm thick) were examined macroscopically. Thereafter, a section
of the main bronchus with the hilar lymph nodes and a minimum of three sections from each zone of both
lungs were taken for microscopic examination. Depending on the pathology identified, additional sections
were taken, as appropriate, from areas of the lung with fibrosis or affected by malignancy.
Routine special stains used to assess the degree of fibrosis and detect ferruginous bodies were Gordon and
Sweets’ reticulin silver and Perl’s Prussian blue iron stains, respectively.
The extent of asbestosis was graded using a modification of the grading scheme of CRAIGHEAD et al. [24].
Asbestosis was considered absent if there was no fibrosis; mild where fibrosis was confined to the area
around the respiratory bronchioles and the immediately adjacent alveoli; moderate if there was coalescence
of fibrosis involving all alveoli between two adjacent bronchioles; and severe if there was widespread
fibrosis with the formation of abnormal airspaces or honeycombing.
Pleural malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer were diagnosed based on morphology supported by
immunohistochemistry. Calretinin, WT1 (Wilms tumour 1) and CK5/6 (cytokeratin 5/6) were routinely
used to confirm mesothelioma. Tumour protein p63 and TTF-1 (thyroid transcription factor-1) were used
https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00022-2017

 to confirm squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas, respectively. The World Health Organization
TNM classification was used to determine the pathological stages of mesothelioma and lung tumours that
had not been diagnosed in life [25]. For this study, all histology slides and pathology reports were reviewed
and confirmed by two pathologists experienced in asbestos-related diseases.
Data collection
Personal/occupational information, radiology and other clinical findings were obtained from the Trusts’
records; pathology findings were obtained from the PATHAUT database. The study did not assess
nonmalignant pleural diseases because for many cases the parietal pleurae were not submitted for autopsy.
Both clinicians and pathologists were aware of asbestos exposures at the time of examination.
Statistical analysis
Summary measures are presented as frequencies and percentages or medians and ranges. The
Mann–Whitney, Chi-squared and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to determine statistical differences
between and among groups, as appropriate. Statistical significance was defined at p⩽0.05. Specificity,
sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated with
autopsy findings as the reference standard.
Radiological profusion scores for asbestosis were grouped as none (0/0 and 0/1), mild (1/0, 1/1 and 1/2),
moderate (2/1, 2/2 and 2/3) and severe (3/2 and 3/3). The κ statistic was used to test agreement between
the clinical and pathological diagnoses. Factors associated with false-negative asbestosis diagnoses were
determined using binary logistic regression, with true-positive asbestosis cases as the reference group.
Variables with p-values ⩽0.2 in the univariate analyses were included in the multivariable model.
Post-regression analysis was done using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. All analyses were
performed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
There were 149 former asbestos mineworkers, of which 131 (87.9%) were male. The overall median (range)
age at death was 66.1 (41.8–95.2) years. Most (n=131 (87.9%)) were from the Northern Cape Province, a
former crocidolite mining area. First occupational asbestos exposures occurred between 1952 and 1990
(median 1976) and the median (range) latency period (first asbestos exposure to asbestos-related disease
diagnosis) was 31.0 (15.0–56.0) years. Approximately one-third had worked in other mining industries, e.g.
gold, manganese, platinum and iron.
Based on clinical evaluation, the SOMP diagnosed 52 (34.9% of the study population) asbestosis cases, 14
(9.4%) mesothelioma cases and three (2.0%) lung cancer cases. At autopsy, 77 (51.7%) cases of asbestosis,
27 (18.1%) cases of mesothelioma and 22 (14.8%) cases of lung cancer were diagnosed (table 2).
Asbestosis was also diagnosed in 10 lung cancer cases and seven mesothelioma cases. The asbestosis cases
were older, and had longer employment duration and intervals from first asbestos exposure to death, than
those with malignancies. The interval from last clinical assessment to death was shorter compared with
lung cancer cases.
Of the 126 asbestos-related diseases diagnosed at autopsy, 73 (57.9%) were not diagnosed clinically. The
low sensitivity values (table 3) indicate that most autopsy-diagnosed asbestos-related diseases had not been
diagnosed clinically. The specificity, PPV and NPV for asbestosis were lower than those for malignancies
(table 3).

 Asbestosis
Of the 52 clinical asbestosis diagnoses, 39 were true-positives. The 13 false-positive cases had other lung
pathologies at autopsy, i.e. emphysema (n=2), pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) (n=2), mesothelioma (n=2),
both PTB and mesothelioma (n=1), lung cancer (n=5), and pneumonia (n=1).
77 cases had autopsy-diagnosed asbestosis, of which 38 (49.4%) had false-negative clinical diagnoses. The
chest radiographs of the false-negative cases were re-read into the ILO classification by three independent
readers who were aware of asbestos exposure but not of the SOMP findings. The median scores for the
three readings were ⩽0/1 (n=30) and ⩾1/0 (n=6), and two radiographs had become unreadable. There was
good agreement (83.3%) between the original and independent readings. Hence, SOMP findings are
presented in this paper.
The false-negative cases were significantly younger, and had shorter employment and latency periods than
the true-positive cases (table 4). The interval between last clinical assessment and death was not

 significantly different. Using tertiles of this interval, we found that although the sensitivity values for
asbestosis increased with increasing interval, the differences were not significant.
Compared with true-positive asbestosis cases, the likelihood of false-negative diagnoses was significantly
higher in cases with acceptable radiographs (versus good) and in those with autopsy-diagnosed PTB (table 5).
There was poor agreement (47.0%; κ=0.15) between the severity of radiological and autopsy-diagnosed
asbestosis. Of the 72 individuals who did not have asbestosis at autopsy, 12 had mild asbestosis (1/0, 1/1
and 1/2) and one had severe asbestosis (3/3) (table 6). Of the 39 true-positive cases, 27 had more severe
disease at autopsy. Nine cases had severe asbestosis at autopsy and profusion scores of ⩽1/0. Of these, two
had normal spirometry, and restrictive patterns in the remaining cases were mild (n=1), moderate (n=3)
and severe (n=3).
Asbestos-related cancer
27 cases of mesothelioma and 22 cases of lung cancer were diagnosed at autopsy. 14 (28.6%) malignancies
had been correctly diagnosed clinically, resulting in low sensitivity values (table 3). Specificity values were
high with no false-positive diagnoses of lung cancer. The three false-positive cases of mesothelioma were
diagnosed as large (n=1) and squamous cell (n=2) carcinomas at autopsy. All clinical diagnoses were
confirmed using histology and immunochemistry, except for two mesothelioma cases: one refused biopsy
and another died while undergoing investigation. HRCT was used to diagnose two of the true-positive
malignancies.
There were 35 false-negative diagnoses of malignant disease. The 16 mesothelioma cases and 19 lung
cancer cases had last been examined 4.8 years (range 0.3–6.3 years) and 4.4 years (range 0.7–7.0 years)
before death, respectively. 24 of the cases had benign asbestos-related diseases (11 had asbestosis, four had
pleural disease, and nine had both asbestosis and pleural disease). Seven false-negative cases (five
mesotheliomas and two lung cancers) died while undergoing investigation.
Three of the 16 false-negative mesotheliomas were from lungs that were received piecemeal. The
pathological classification of four of the mesotheliomas was T2 (with confluent visceral pleural tumours),
one of which also had invasion of the lung parenchyma. 12 were T4 with direct extension to the
contralateral pleura and/or invasion of the myocardium. The thickness of the mesotheliomas was <10
(n=1), 10–20 (n=7) and ⩾30 mm (n=8). Four of the 19 false-negative primary lung cancers were from
lungs that were received piecemeal and could not be classified. The lung cancers were classified as T1b
(n=1), T2 (n=4), T3 (n=8) and T4 (n=2). One lung cancer was >30 mm in diameter and the remainder
were >70 mm.
Discussion
This study provides recent clinicopathological findings on three asbestos-related diseases in former
asbestos mineworkers using autopsies as the reference standard for comparison. The major finding was
that many diagnoses had been missed clinically.
One limitation of this study is the interval (0.3–7.4 years) between the last clinical assessment and death.
This might explain the large proportion of false-negative cancer diagnoses, as tumours may have
developed and progressed rapidly during this interval and/or manifested clinical symptoms late [26]. This

 could also explain the poor agreement between the clinical and autopsy grading of asbestosis but this is
unlikely, as discussed later.
The proportion (49.4%) of false-negative asbestosis diagnoses is higher than that reported for interstitial
fibrotic lung diseases (10–20%) [22, 27–29]. The sensitivity value for asbestosis is within the range of
26.9–56.7% reported for deceased South African asbestos mineworkers [20]. False-negative asbestosis
diagnoses may have occurred because the Trusts used radiological detection of opacities as the entry point
for investigation of asbestosis and, as such, a negative reading would preclude further investigation. The
missed diagnoses were not due to poor interpretation of films by the SOMP as its findings were confirmed
by three independent readers.
The false-negative cases may have arisen from progression in the interval between the clinical and autopsy
examinations. Progression from normal to radiologically detectable asbestosis, even long after exposure
cessation, is well established and occurs in a minority of amphibole exposed workers [30–32]. The
determinants of progression include cumulative asbestos exposure, intensity of exposure, duration of
follow-up and age, but vary among study cohorts [30–33]. Asbestosis developed in 10.6% of former South
African mineworkers 5.7 years after exposure cessation and in 4–10% of former US amosite factory
workers after ⩾10 years [31–33]. As in our study, the workers had been exposed to amphibole asbestos
(amosite and/or crocidolite), but decades earlier and after shorter asbestos exposures [31–33]. Hence,
progression rates reported elsewhere may not be directly applicable to our setting.
Diagnostic accuracy may be improved by having serial chest radiographs, but we did not have the data to
examine this. HRCT, a more sensitive tool for asbestosis diagnosis, is particularly useful where there are no
or indeterminate radiological findings (0/0 or 0/1) in symptomatic, exposed individuals with abnormal
lung function [22, 26]. It reduces false-positive diagnoses through identification of other pleural and
parenchymal conditions, e.g. emphysema and bronchiectasis, which may explain radiological changes
thought to be asbestosis [22, 34]. Nonetheless, HRCT may miss disease, detect nonspecific changes
unrelated to asbestosis and is prone to inter-reader variability [10, 35]. In settings with limited access to
HRCT, patients with asbestos exposure and clinical features of asbestosis, including exertional dyspnoea,
crackles on auscultation of the chest and abnormal lung function tests, particularly chest restriction or
reduced transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide, should be prioritised for imaging [22].
The second limitation is the small number of cases available to determine factors associated with
false-negative asbestosis diagnoses. Hence, some explanatory variables may not have been identified.
Nonetheless, our findings suggest that asbestosis is more likely to be diagnosed using radiographs of good
quality and less likely in cases with PTB.
There were few false-positive diagnoses of asbestosis and mesothelioma, and none of lung cancer. The
specificity of asbestosis (81.6%) is similar to that observed in a previous study (76.2–80.0%) [20]. Factors
associated with false-positive asbestosis readings include radiographic technique, aging, obesity, smoking,
presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dust exposures [10, 20]. We found that the
false-positive cases had other pathologies (PTB, emphysema or lung cancer) that could have been misread
as asbestosis.

OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL LUNG DISEASE | N. NDLOVU ET AL.
 Most of the 35 cases with false-negative malignancies had advanced tumours at autopsy. Although seven
malignancies were suspected in life, the cases died before a definitive diagnosis was made. The
predominantly advanced pathological stage of the tumours suggests that there could have been more
true-positive clinical diagnoses if clinicians had a higher index of suspicion and had been more aggressive
in investigating these tumours. Accuracy could be improved by the introduction of standardised protocols
for immunohistochemistry panels for mesothelioma and lung cancer in peripheral pathology laboratories.
Conclusions
This study confirms that chest radiography, as the sole imaging tool in asbestos-exposed individuals,
substantially underdiagnoses asbestos-related diseases but has good specificity, producing few false-positive
results. Accurate clinical diagnoses ensure timely management and treatment of diseases that present
similarly to asbestos-related diseases, and provide more reliable incidence and prevalence estimates to
inform prevention strategies [8]. Increased diagnostic awareness among healthcare providers is necessary
for asbestos-related disease diagnosis, particularly in the poorly resourced public healthcare facilities to
which many South Africans present [36]. This study highlights the valuable role of autopsies in the
detection of undiagnosed disease, monitoring of clinical practice and delivery of compensation.
