background Breathlessness is a common, distressing 
symptom in people with advanced disease and a marker 
of deterioration. Holistic services that draw on integrated 
palliative care have been developed for this group. this 
systematic review aimed to examine the outcomes, 
experiences and therapeutic components of these 
services.
Methods Systematic review searching nine databases 
to June 2017 for experimental, qualitative and 
observational studies. eligibility and quality were 
independently assessed by two authors. Data on service 
models, health and cost outcomes were synthesised, 
using meta-analyses as indicated. Data on recipient 
experiences were synthesised thematically and integrated 
at the level of interpretation and reporting.
Results From 3239 records identified, 37 articles 
were included representing 18 different services. Most 
services enrolled people with thoracic cancer, involved 
palliative care staff and comprised 4–6 contacts over 
4–6 weeks. commonly used interventions included 
breathing techniques, psychological support and 
relaxation techniques. Meta-analyses demonstrated 
reductions in numeric rating Scale distress due to 
breathlessness (n=324; mean difference (MD) −2.30, 
95% ci −4.43 to −0.16, p=0.03) and Hospital anxiety 
and Depression Scale (HaDS) depression scores (n=408, 
MD −1.67, 95% ci −2.52 to −0.81, p<0.001) favouring 
the intervention. Statistically non-significant effects 
were observed for chronic respiratory Questionnaire 
(crQ) mastery (n=259, MD 0.23, 95% ci −0.10 to 
0.55, p=0.17) and HaDS anxiety scores (n=552, MD 
−1.59, 95% ci −3.22 to 0.05, p=0.06). Patients and 
carers valued tailored education, self-management 
interventions and expert staff providing person-centred, 
dignified care. However, there was no observable effect 
on health status or quality of life, and mixed evidence 
around physical function.
Conclusion Holistic services for chronic breathlessness 
can reduce distress in patients with advanced disease 
and may improve psychological outcomes of anxiety and 
depression. therapeutic components of these services 
should be shared and integrated into clinical practice.

InTRoduCTIon
Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom 
of chronic disease, affecting almost all people with 
chronic respiratory disease,1 the majority with heart 
disease or cancer,1 and significant proportions of 
those with renal disease, neurological conditions 
or HIV/AIDS.1 2 With our ageing population and 
increasing multimorbidity,3 the number of people 
affected by breathlessness worldwide will rise. 
Breathlessness increases as disease progresses4 
and often becomes chronic (ie, it persists despite 
optimal treatment of the underlying disease5). The 
symptom can result in fear, sleep disturbance, social 
isolation and disability for patients and carers.6 7 
Breathlessness also occurs alongside other trouble-
some symptoms such as cough, fatigue and anxiety, 
and serves as a marker of overall symptom burden 
and deterioration.8 9 
There are limited pharmacological treatments for 
breathlessness: moderate evidence supports use of 
low-dose opioids,10 11 and there is little to support 
use of benzodiazepines.12 As these approaches 
do not address the psychosocial problems that 
underlie and perpetuate the symptom,13 non-phar-
macological treatments take priority. In many 
people, breathlessness is successfully managed via 
Key messages
What is the key question?
 
► What are the outcomes, recipients’ experiences 
and therapeutic components of holistic services 
for chronic breathlessness in people with 
advanced disease?
What is the bottom line?
 
► Overall these services reduce patient distress 
due to breathlessness and may improve 
psychological outcomes of anxiety and 
depression.
 
► Despite wide variability in content and delivery, 
recipients value tailored interventions and 
expert staff providing person-centred, dignified 
care.
Why read on?
 
► This is the first review to synthesise available 
quantitative and qualitative evidence around 
holistic services triggered by breathlessness, 
which may serve as an appropriate referral 
indicator for early integration of palliative care.

rehabilitation services that incorporate exercise training, educa-
tion and behaviour change interventions.14 15 Pulmonary reha-
bilitation, for example, improves functional status and quality of 
life, and is a cornerstone of best standard breathlessness care.14 
However, issues with referral, uptake and completion limit 
reach, particularly to people with the most advanced disease 
with high levels of disability.6 16 17
Holistic services are emerging, designed specifically for those 
with advanced disease and chronic breathlessness.18–21 These typi-
cally draw on palliative care, but with integrated working from 
multiple specialties and professional groups. Treatments are selected 
based on the physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of 
individual patients, and their families or carers. Individual studies 
suggest a positive impact on health outcomes.18–21 For example, 
an integrated palliative and respiratory care service improved 
breathlessness mastery, and suggested a potential survival advan-
tage.21 Recent international guidelines subsequently advocate for 
early integration of palliative care in people experiencing chronic 
disease,22 23 and refractory and/or distressing breathlessness may 
serve as an appropriate referral indicator, especially in non-cancer 
conditions where prognostication causes delays.24 However, the 
evidence base to guide practice and policy is poorly understood.
We therefore aimed to synthesise available evidence around 
holistic breathlessness services for people with advanced disease. 
Our objectives were to describe structures and therapeutic compo-
nents; determine clinical and cost-effectiveness; and understand 
patients’ and carers’ experiences of these services.

design and registration
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and 
reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) state-
ment25; the protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO: 
CRD42017057508).26
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Participants
Adults experiencing breathlessness related to advanced disease, 
including cancer (advanced local or metastatic), chronic respira-
tory disease (GOLD stage III–IV/grade C–D), heart failure (New 
York Heart Association stage III–IV) or progressive neurological 
conditions. Studies were eligible if ≥50% of participants met these 
definitions.
Interventions and comparators
In the absence of a standard definition, we defined holistic breath-
lessness services as those where patients are enrolled due to their 
breathlessness (not their diagnosis); drawing on skills from multiple 
specialties and disciplines; using a holistic approach encompassing 
non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions as indi-
cated; and supporting self-management. Interventions were 
excluded if they did not specifically target patients with breath-
lessness; or used single treatments (eg, breathing training alone). 
Pulmonary rehabilitation and disease-specific services (eg, inte-
grated respiratory care) were deemed outside the scope of this 
review. Exclusively targeted service provider or carer interventions 
were excluded. All comparators were considered.
Outcomes
Health outcomes included breathlessness intensity, affect and 
impact domains27; anxiety and depression; physical function; 
health status or quality of life; and survival. Cost outcomes of 
interest included service costs and utilisation, and quality-ad-
justed life-years (QALYs) derived from generic quality of life 
measures (eg, EuroQol-5D). Experience outcomes included 
patient and carer perspectives.
Designs
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs, observa-
tional studies and qualitative studies were included. Narrative 
reviews, opinion papers and case series with <5 participants were 
excluded. Our search strategy is shown in Box 1.
Quality assessment
T
wo authors (LB, MM) independently assessed the quality of 
included studies using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for 
Evaluating Primary Research Papers (QualSyst),28 which contains 
checklists for quantitative and qualitative studies. For mixed-
method studies, both checklists were used. QualSyst scores are 
summarised as a percentage score of applicable items. Information 
to aid quality assessment was obtained from primary, secondary 
and protocol articles. For RCTs we also assessed risk of bias using 
the Cochrane Collaboration tool.29
data extraction and analysis
Data were extracted by one author (SM/LB) using a predesigned 
electronic form and checked by a second author to ensure rigour 
(LB/MM). Data were extracted on service characteristics (staff; 
contacts; duration; interventions; target population), study 
information (country; authors; year; design) and outcomes. 
Where additional information was needed for inclusion in 
box 1 search strategy
electronic searches
The following electronic databases were searched from their 
inception up to 2 June 2017:
 
► British Nursing Index
 
► CINAHL
 
► Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
 
► Central Register of Controlled Trials
 
► Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness
 
► EMBASE
 
► MEDLINE
 
► PsycINFO
 
► Science Citation Index Expanded
Search terms were informed by literature scoping and 
information specialists, and piloted to ensure inclusivity. 
Subject headings and free text terms were combined to search 
for population and intervention terms (online supplementary 
appendix 1 shows the MEDLINE strategy).
handsearching
Reference lists of retrieved studies and relevant reviews, 
citations, textbooks and voluntary sector materials were 
searched, and we contacted active researchers for unpublished 
data/grey literature. No language or publication status 
restrictions were imposed.
screening
Records were imported into Endnote X756 and duplicates 
removed. Two authors (SM, LB/MM) screened titles and 
abstracts for relevance, and independently assessed full 
texts of potentially eligible studies against eligibility criteria. 
Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and consultation 
with a third author (IH) to reach consensus.

meta-analysis, authors were contacted. For experience data, all 
text (including quotations) under the headings of ‘results’ or 
‘findings’ in qualitative or mixed-methods studies were imported 
verbatim into qualitative data software (NVIVO V
.12).30
Service characteristics and details of associated studies 
were tabulated. Component interventions were tabulated and 
summarised narratively. Data from controlled studies were 
included to estimate effectiveness. Outcomes were analysed 
as continuous data where possible. Mean differences (MDs) 
between intervention and comparator groups were reported with 
95% CIs. Where data permitted, meta-analysis was performed 
using random-effects models, and heterogeneity assessed using 
the I22 statistic. In all cases, individual studies were only repre-
sented once within each analysis. Sensitivity analyses excluded 
studies with high risk of bias (<70% 
QualSyst score) and 
removed outliers where substantial heterogeneity (I2 >75%)31 
was present. We planned funnel plots to assess reporting bias 
if ≥10 studies were included.32 Additional findings were 
summarised narratively.
Qualitative data were coded line by line, and descriptive themes 
were developed encompassing the themes or codes of primary 
studies. From these, new analytical themes going beyond presen-
tation of primary data were generated.33 Particular attention was 
paid to similarities and differences across studies, and divergent 
cases. Multiple stakeholders (researchers, patient/carer repre-
sentatives, clinicians involved in delivery of services) reviewed 
the analysis and interpretation to ensure comprehensiveness and 
increase validity. Data were integrated at the level of interpreta-
tion and reporting.
ResulTs
Of 3239 unique records identified and 56 full texts screened, 
37 articles were eligible for inclusion (figure 1). Articles were 
published in the period 1996–2017 (27 since 2010) and related 
to 18 separate holistic breathlessness services: 12 based in the 
UK, 3 in Canada and 1 each in Australia, Germany and Hong 
Kong.
service characteristics
Thirty-three articles were included in the descriptive synthesis 
(tables 1 and 2). Most of the services (12 of 18) were deliv-
ered to people with advanced cancer and used a mixture of 
face-to-face and phone contacts (median 4–6, range 1–12) and 
were short term, usually over 4–6 weeks (range 1–12; table 1). 
Service providers included doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and

occupational therapists, with involvement from palliative care, 
respiratory care and oncology. Services used a wide range of 
interventions (table 2), most commonly breathing techniques, 
psychological support and relaxation or calming techniques. A 
minority (≤2 of 18) included acupressure/transcutaneous 
elec-
trical nerve stimulation, sleep hygiene advice, spiritual support 
or smoking cessation interventions.
effectiveness of holistic breathlessness services
T
welve studies (11 RCTs18–21 34–40 and 1 quasi-experimental 
design37) from seven services were included in the quantitative 
synthesis (table 1). Of these five were designed as pilot/feasibility 
studies18 36 38 39 and seven as effectiveness studies.19–21 34–36 40 
Nine studies compared the services to usual care; in one study18 
the control group were encouraged to talk freely about their 
breathlessness and disease but not offered training or counsel-
ling, and two studies compared one versus three contacts with 
a service.39 40
Nine studies enrolled only patients with cancer,18 19 34 36–40 two 
enrolled only patients with non-malignant disease20 or COPD35 
and one study enrolled patients with any advanced disease.21 
In total, 979 patients were recruited (range 2239 to 15640), 
including 757 (77.3%) with advanced cancer and 180 (18.4%) 
with advanced COPD. The remaining participants (4.3%) had 
other non-malignant diseases including interstitial lung disease 
or heart failure. A wide variety of outcomes were measured 
(online supplementary table S1). The most common measures 
were breathlessness intensity (10 studies), distress due to breath-
lessness (10 studies) and anxiety and depression (9 studies). 
Breathlessness intensity measures varied by type (average/best/
worst), context (at rest/on exertion) and timing (current/past 
24 
hours/past week).
Quality assessment scores ranged from 35% to 100% (median 
90.4%; online supplementary table S2). The lowest scores 
were for studies where only an abstract was available.35–37 
Due to the nature of the intervention that prohibits patient 
blinding and prioritises self-assessed outcomes, all studies were 
deemed at risk of detection bias and most at risk of perfor-
mance bias (figure 2). Only three studies reported blinding of 
investigators.19–21
Breathlessness intensity
Ten studies18 21 34–40 assessed the severity of breathlessness using 
one or more of the following measures: visual analogue scale 
(VAS), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) or Borg scores (see online

study using an unspecified measure found a greater improve-
ment compared with control (difference in mean change 1.2,36 
whereas two studies using NRS did not (MD −0.33, 95% 
CI 
−1.28 to 0.62, p=0.4921; MD 0.65, 95% 
CI −0.49 to 1.80, 
p=0.26).38 One study using NRS found no effect on breathless-
ness on exertion (MD −0.73 95% 
CI −1.69 to 0.22, p=0.13),21 
and one study using Borg scale ratings for breathlessness at 
rest and on exertion found no difference between groups (data 
not reported).35 In line with their feasibility study results,39 a 
powered trial comparing one with three service contacts found 
no significant difference in NRS worst (MD 0.2, 95% 
CI −2.31 
to 2.97, p=0.83) or average (MD 0.3, 95% 
CI −2.00 to 2.62, 
p=0.79) breathlessness.40
Breathlessness affect
Ten studies18–20 34 36–40 assessed ‘distress due to breathlessness’ 
using VAS (range 0–100, higher=worse) or NRS (range 0–10, 
higher=worse), two as a prespecified primary outcome.19 20 Of 
eight studies comparing breathlessness services to usual care, 
data from five18–20 34 38 were pooled in a meta-analysis (n=324, 
figure 3A). Three studies36 37 reported no significant difference 
but could not be included as data were not reported. Meta-anal-
ysis of those studies reporting data showed significantly lower 
NRS distress following the intervention compared with control 
(MD −2.30, 95% CI −4.43 to −0.16, p=0.03). A sensitivity 
analysis excluding two outlier studies18 34 resulted in a reduced 
point estimate of effect and non-significant difference (MD 
−0.29, 95% CI −1.00 to 0.43, p=0.43; I2=0%). One feasi-
bility study39 and one randomised trial40 testing service varia-
tions found no difference on NRS ‘coping with breathlessness’ 
(MD −1.7, 95% CI −4.27 to 0.90, p=0.20)40 and significantly 
higher NRS distress due to breathlessness following three 
sessions versus one session (MD 3.9, 95% CI 0.98 to 6.91, 
p=0.01).40
Four studies19–21 35 assessed ‘mastery over breathlessness’ using 
the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire mastery domain; two as 
a primary outcome.21 35 A meta-analysis of these data (n=259, 
figure 3B) showed a statistically non-significant increase in 
mastery (range 1–7, higher=better) favouring the intervention 
(MD 0.23, 95% 
CI −0.10 to 0.55, p=0.17). A sensitivity anal-
ysis excluding one study35 deemed at high risk of bias increased 
the point estimate of effect (MD 0.30, 95% 
CI −0.06 to 0.66, 
p=0.11). One study found significantly lower mastery scores 
following three compared with one service contact (MD −0.6, 
95% 
CI −1.06 to −0.11, p=0.02).40
One further study found improved dyspnoea-12 (range 0–36; 
higher=worse) scores following intervention as compared with 
control (MD 5.19, 95% 
CI 0.62 to 9.75, p=0.026).38
Psychological outcomes
Seven studies assessed anxiety and depression using the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).18–21 34 36 38 Data from 
these seven studies (n=552, figure 3C) showed a statistically 
non-significant reduction in anxiety scores (range 0–21; high-
er=worse) favouring the intervention (MD −1.59, 95% 
CI 
−3.22 to 0.05, p=0.06). Sensitivity analysis excluding one 
study36 deemed at high risk of bias increased the point estimate 
(−1.85, 95% 
CI −3.76 to 0.06, p=0.06). Sensitivity analysis 
removing one outlier study34 resulted in a reduced point estimate 
but statistically significant group difference (MD −0.66,–1.23 
to −0.10, p=0.02; I2=0%). No statistical differences in anxiety 
were reported when comparing one and three contacts.39 40
For depression, one study37 reporting no difference between 
groups could not be included in the meta-analysis as data were 
not provided. Meta-analysis using six remaining studies (n=408, 
figure 3D) showed reduced depression scores (range 0–21, 
higher=worse) favouring the intervention (MD −1.67, 95% 
CI 
−2.52 to −0.81, p<0.001). No statistical differences in depres-
sion were reported when comparing one and three contacts.39 40
Three further studies reported no significant differences 
between the intervention and control groups in ‘psycholog-
ical symptoms’; two using an unspecified measure (data not 
reported)36 37 and one using the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist 
(range 7–28, higher=worse; difference in median change −8, 
p=0.21).34 One study comparing one session with three sessions 
found no significant difference on CRQ emotion scores (MD 
−0.09, 95% 
CI −0.54 to 0.36, p=0.69).40
Physical function, health status and survival
Five studies18–21 34 assessed physical function. T
wo studies found 
greater improvements following intervention compared with 
control using the Functional Capacity Scale (range 0–14; high-
er=better; MD for change 1.25, p<0.02)18 and WHO Perfor-
mance Scale (range 0–5, higher=worse; difference in median 
change −2, p=0.02),34 respectively. Three studies observed no 
difference in functional outcomes between groups assessed using 
either the London Chest Activities of Daily Living Scale21 (MD 
–5, 95% 
CI –12.22 to 1.02, p=0.10) or patient-reported number 
of times out of house19 20 (data not reported).
Seven studies19–21 34 35 38 40 included a measure of health status 
or quality of life. No significant differences were found between 
groups across the CRQ dyspnoea domain19–21 35 (including the 
comparison between one and three sessions40) or total score,21 
EuroQol-5D index21 or VAS,21 38 and the Rotterdam Symptom 
Scale quality-of-life domain.34 Due to heterogenous measures, 
change from baseline and post-intervention scores, and cases of 
non-normally distributed data, we decided against meta-analysis 
for these outcomes.
T
wo studies reported survival data.21 34 One found a significant 
difference in survival (generalised Wilcoxon score 3.9, p=0.048) 
in favour of the intervention.21 Subgroup analysis found the 
difference was driven by participants with non-cancer diagnoses. 
The remaining study, enrolling only patients with cancer, found 
no difference in survival across groups (data not reported).34
economic evaluation
One service did not increase formal care costs compared with 
usual care (mean (SD) £2911 (£2729) vs £3709 (£4484); incre-
mental QALY gain 0.092 (95% CI −0.23 to 0.04)).21 Another 
service19 20 was more cost-effective than usual care for patients 
with cancer (total costs £354 lower (95% 
CI  ̶ £1020 to £246); 
incremental QALY-gain 0.0002 (95% CI −0.001 to 0.002)),19

experiences of holistic breathlessness services
T
welve articles18–21 41–48 reporting experience data from five sepa-
rate services were included in the qualitative synthesis (table 1). 
These included six mixed-method18–21 43 46 47 and five qualita-
tive studies.41 42 44 45 48 Most data were from patient and/or carer 
interviews18–21 41–45 48; one used therapists notes,46 and one used 
free-text responses to a postal survey.47 Data represented views 
of 167 patients (53.9% with cancer) and up to 49 carers. Quality 
assessment scores ranged from 40% to 85% (median 70%; 
online supplementary table S4). Common limitations included 
lack of reflexivity, not using verification procedures to establish 
credibility and unclear reporting of the analytic methods.

Three themes were identified: valued characteristics, perceived 
outcomes and challenges to services.
Patients valued the education and information sharing included 
in the services, particularly to help them understand their breath-
lessness, legitimise the treatments being suggested, and provide 
resources to refer to in future crises (Box 2). The treatments 
themselves (breathing techniques, pacing, positioning, relax-
ation, handheld fan) were praised for their simplicity, portability 
and perceived effectiveness. The psychosocial support received 
through the services was highly valued, providing opportuni-
ties for participants to have their experiences listened to and 
acknowledged, receive support and reassurance, and discuss 
problems beyond their breathlessness. Participants appreciated 
when carers were involved, both to support them as individ-
uals and in caring for the patient. Overwhelmingly, recipients 
commented on the qualities of the staff providing services, 
whom they deemed experts in not only managing breathlessness, 
but in person-centred care and treating participants with respect 
and dignity.
In line with quantitative findings, perceived outcomes were 
mostly psychological, including increased understanding and 
self-efficacy, and feeling more ‘in control’, less isolated, or less 
distressed (Box 2). Some recipients also reported their breathing 
feeling easier and more controlled. Others felt the sensation 
of breathlessness was unchanged, but their reaction to it had 
changed. Participants reported being more able to maintain and/
or increase their daily activity, and successfully self-manage.
T
wo potential challenges for services were identified (Box 2). 
First, respondents’ accounts showed the importance of motiva-
tion to self-manage in the success of the interventions, yet this 
was difficult if benefits were not quickly achieved. Second, some 
participants had low expectations of the services or the treat-
ments offered, which at times resulted in a reluctance to engage.
dIsCussIon
This review synthesised quantitative and qualitative evidence to 
provide a detailed understanding of holistic services for people 
with advanced disease and breathlessness that persists despite 
optimal treatment of the underlying disease. Despite wide varia-
tion across health service models, we found evidence suggesting 
an effect on the affective domain of breathlessness, and on 
psychological outcomes of anxiety and depression. Services were 
highly valued by patients and carers, who appreciated the educa-
tion to help them understand their breathlessness, the provision 
of useful self-management interventions and the provision of 
expert dignified care which centred on the person. There was 
however no effect on overall health status or quality of life using 
varied generic measures, and mixed evidence around any effect 
on physical function.
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review in this 
field; a recent narrative review described some common service 
features, but focused on an emerging service in Munich that 
contributed to our data.49 The bias of effect towards psycho-
logical health outcomes is concordant with the primary focus 
of these services to support living with breathlessness rather 
than taking the symptom away. The effect on depression, which 
in cases arose from preventing its onset within usual care,21 34 
may have been achieved through expert management of breath-
lessness and concurrent symptoms, but also through receipt 
of holistic care that prioritised active listening and putting the 
person before their disease. The effect sizes observed (point esti-
mates: distress: −0.57, mastery: 0.18, anxiety −0.45, depres-
sion: −0.55) are larger than those achieved with psychological 
box 2 example quotes for themes derived from 
qualitative synthesis
Valued service characteristics
 
► Education and information sharing: 'When I’m having 
problems I go back and read it to see if I am doing the right 
thing. I find that very, very helpful.’ (Man, ILD)21 
 
► Caring and expert service providers: ‘Would you like a cup 
a tea […] it's just human to human situation. But that 
environment makes you: you are in the right place, you know. 
There is no guessing going on, […]. You are gonna get the 
best of their mind.’ (P01043, man with COPD)45 
 
►  Involving carers: 'Knowing now that he won’t die in one of 
these sort of situations, so that certainly helped me, and it 
certainly helped me to realise that, you know, I can probably 
help him to calm down. So yes, as a carer I think it was a 
help.’ (038t3c)20
 
► Psychological support: ‘I was able to discuss my personal 
feelings, that you don’t talk to your family about so not to 
worry them.’ (69-year-old woman with COPD)47  
 
► Simple, portable and effective tools: 'To put my hand on 
my tummy … puff puff puff … and do that, and you know, 
it’s amazing really, it sounds so pathetic when you say 
something … It is simple, it’s not a thing you’d think of 
doing.’ (530t3pc)19 
Perceived outcomes
Affective distress
 
► Increased self-efficacy: ‘They were increasing activity 
and functional levels by using breathing techniques and 
exploiting the confidence these gave them.’ (Researcher 
comments)18
 
► Feeling more ‘in control’: 'The blissful thing is, like I’ve said is, 
you can control your breathing, if you get a bad spell you can 
work your way through it.’ (Man, ILD)21
 
► Feeling less isolated: ‘At this time you’re down and lonely 
anyway so having someone there for support is important.’ 
(04M)48
 
► Increased understanding: 'I was thrilled to bits to be able to 
be getting some knowledge of what my complaint was all 
about … that they're doing something about it.’ (P04)41
 
► Reduced distress: 'Learning to relax and not get so  
stressed out, I mean I still get the old panic now and again  
when I've really put myself out […], but most of the time  
I deal with it quite easily.’ (Patient with cancer)44
Sensory-perceptual experience
 
► Perceived impact on what breathing feels like: ‘It helped me 
to learn to relax, learn to breathe in a more controlled way.’ 
(54-year-old man with COPD)47
Symptom impact or burden
 
► Improved daily activities: 'Went up and down [the stairs] with 
very little increase in respiratory rate. Flung her arms around 
my neck and said "I never thought I would be able to do that 
again".’ (Staff comment 11)46
 
► Increased self-management: 'I would get into a panic when 
I was breathless, but now I can sit down use my fan, wet my 
face, read my laminate (breathlessness poem) and I calm 
down.’ (Woman with COPD)21
Challenges to services
 
► Motivation: 'She gave me a fan and told me to, you know, 
put it on … and then blow out. I do try to do it, but I get so 
out of breath doing it. I give up.’ (Case 013)43

therapies, self-management programmes and more comparable 
to pulmonary rehabilitation,50 51 despite the different interven-
tional approach. While few measurable effects were identified 
for physical function and quality of life, we feel it important 
to acknowledge the qualitative data that captured participants’ 
feelings of expanding horizons, including being able to maintain 
daily activities and tasks. The diverse nature of patient-reported 
improvements in physical function may be difficult to capture 
using standardised measures, and individualised measures (eg, 
goal attainment scaling52) could have more utility in this setting.
We intentionally made no attempt to compare with pulmo-
nary rehabilitation, although in chronic respiratory disease the 
interface between the two service models must be addressed. 
In no respect do we view holistic breathlessness services as a 
replacement for pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a highly 
effective and underused intervention.14 These services may 
however act as a next step for people who remain highly symp-
tomatic despite completing pulmonary rehabilitation, as a bridge 
for people limited by chronic breathlessness but who decline 
pulmonary rehabilitation (which may include people who are 
post-admission for an acute exacerbation), and/or as an adjunct 
for patients whose goals relate to psychosocial health. Home-
based pulmonary rehabilitation provision overcomes some issues 
with transportation and improves reach.53 54 However, holistic 
breathlessness service services may provide an additional oppor-
tunity for health gains in people unable to complete programmes 
with a major exercise component, particularly where breath-
lessness limits people from exercising to an intensity associated 
with a training response.6 16 55 The inclusion of palliative care 
may also be helpful for this population, who have distressing 
physical and psychological symptoms, often limited under-
standing of their disease, and infrequently discuss end-of-life 
issues in routine clinical care.24 Although international guide-
lines advocate for early integration of palliative care in chronic 
disease,22 23 the unpredictable course of many respiratory condi-
tions, including COPD, and the difficulty of predicting survival 
are barriers to timely palliative care referral and receipt. A 
symptom-triggered approach should reach more people likely to 
benefit than current approaches based on prognostication.24 For 
services already well-aligned with palliative care, adoption of 
the core therapeutic components for breathlessness management 
into existing practice may suffice.
The heterogeneity of service models with respect to staffing, 
structure, content and target populations is an important finding. 
While some shared characteristics were identified (Box 3), 
further work is required to determine the most effective compo-
nents, and which recipients gain most benefit. This includes 
determining optimal service duration, particularly as one trial 
found better outcomes for distress due to breathlessness and 
mastery after one session versus three (hypothesising that one 
session increased self-efficacy and reduced logistic challenges of 
multiple clinic visits). The literature is small but increasing, and 
new data from services identified with no published outcomes 
can be expected. Use of consistent measures may permit meta-re-
gression, or responder analysis using individual level data to iden-
tify service and patient characteristics related to better outcomes. 
An alternative approach is to use discrete choice experiments to 
identify which components would be prioritised and preferred 
by patients and carers, particularly in resource-limited settings. 
Findings would inform future services as appropriate, but also 
adoption of the most effective characteristics into existing 
services upstream. Increased consideration of cost effectiveness 
is also warranted.
Strengths of this work include a registered protocol, and a 
systematic and comprehensive search across multiple data-
bases, inclusive of grey literature, with no exclusions by publi-
cation year or language. Eligibility and quality assessment was 
conducted independently by two authors, and multiple stake-
holders (researchers, clinicians, service user representatives) 
contributed to the analysis and interpretation of these data. 
The review also has some limitations. First, the meta-analyses 
included data from services shown to vary in structure, delivery 
and recipients. We completed sensitivity analyses in response to 
any clinical heterogeneity, but the overall dataset was moderate 
in size and sensitivity analysis compromised the precision of our 
effect size estimates. These estimates may be inflated by lack 
of blinding of study personnel in some instances, and disap-
pointment effects in control groups where a fast-track design 
was not used. Moreover, although we did not assess for statis-
tical evidence of publication bias, there was clear evidence of 
selective reporting where study authors did not provide data 
for statistically non-significant findings. Some of our estimates 
do not include these data, and caution should be applied in 
these instances. There were also challenges with inconsistent 
use of, and unclear reporting of, outcome measures, which 
sometimes precluded meta-analysis (eg, breathlessness inten-
sity). For the qualitative synthesis, included data were drawn 
from published studies or abstracts. This created an additional 
layer of abstraction, although also allowed synthesis of study 
authors’ interpretations as we did not limit data extraction to 
direct quotations. Qualitative data were predominantly drawn 
from two UK services,19–21 and patients who had fully engaged 
with the services. Less is understood about experiences of these 
services internationally, of carers, and of those who dropped out 
and perhaps might report less benefit. Finally, we limited the 
review to studies in people with advanced disease, which reflects 
key studies in the current evidence base. We acknowledge that

service access based on disease severity may however not serve 
those patients with distressing breathlessness but in early stages 
of disease by traditional markers, for example, moderate airflow 
obstruction or potentially resectable thoracic cancer. As such, 
we advocate access to these services primarily based on the pres-
ence of breathlessness, accepting the empirical data presented 
does not extend to some groups.
In conclusion, holistic services for chronic breathlessness 
in people with advanced disease overall demonstrate positive 
effects on patient distress due to breathlessness and psycho-
logical health. Services are heterogonous in their content and 
delivery, but are highly valued by patients and families, who 
appreciate tailored education around breathlessness, provi-
sion of simple, portable self-management interventions and 
expert staff providing person-centred, dignified care. Chronic 
or distressing breathlessness can serve as an appropriate referral 
indicator for timely referral and receipt of palliative care, espe-
cially in non-cancer conditions where prognostication causes 
delays. Further work should test and understand the most effec-
tive service configurations and how these can be integrated into 
existing healthcare systems.
