 Trends in Cardiovascular Health Metrics in Obese Adults: National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1988–2014
Fangjian Guo, MD, PhD; W. Timothy Garvey, MD
Background-—No study has quantified trends in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors and cardiovascular health
metrics among obese people in the United States in recent years.
Methods and Results-—We examined the secular changes in cardiovascular health metrics and key cardiovascular disease risk
factors among obese adults (aged ≥20 years) in the United States. We included 18 626 obese adults (body mass index ≥30) from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and NHANES 1999–2014. Among those obese adults, there
were decreases in mean systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol levels and increases in mean high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and mean hemoglobin A1c levels. Prevalence of blood pressure health and lipid health
remained stable during the period 1988–2014, whereas prevalence of blood glucose health decreased significantly during this
period. Prevalence of freedom from cardiovascular disease risk factors remained stable at �15% among the adult obese population
during the period 1988–2014, whereas prevalence of presence of all 3 risk factors increased from 16.4% to 22.4% during this
period, commensurate with a decline in those with 1 to 2 risk factors (from 69.6% to 62.4%).
Conclusions-—During the past 3 decades, blood pressure health and blood lipid health remained stable or improved, whereas
blood glucose health deteriorated among adult obese population. This resulted in an overall decrease in cardiovascular health
status among obese adults and greater risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The data argue for interventions targeted to those obese
persons who are metabolically unhealthy to stem rising rates of diabetes mellitus. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003619 doi:

O
besity is associated with elevated risk of morbidity and
mortality1 and has become an epidemic both in the
United States and worldwide.2,3 Obese persons who are free
from cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia, are relatively
insulin sensitive.4–9 Epidemiological data indicate low risk of
progression to diabetes mellitus and CVD outcomes among
such people compared with obese persons with risk fac-
tors10–14 but increased risk of diabetes mellitus compared
with healthy lean persons. These people experience low rates
of incident diabetes mellitus and CVD, and their CVD risks are
substantially reduced in comparison with either lean or obese
persons who have the metabolic syndrome.10–12
Prevalence of obesity in the United States has leveled off in
recent years.2,15 It was reported that during the period 1960–
2000, except for diabetes mellitus, prevalence of CVD risk
factors declined in obese people in the United States16;
however, no study has quantified trends in the prevalence of
individual CVD risk factors together with cardiovascular health
status among obese people in the United States in recent

 years. Using nationally representative data from National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988–
2014, we examined secular changes in cardiovascular health
and CVD risk factors among obese adults (aged ≥20 years)
during the past 3 decades in the United States.
Methods
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
NHANES is a serial cross-sectional study involving nationally
representative samples of the civilian noninstitutionalized US
population. NHANES III was conducted during the period
1988–1994, and the continuous NHANES study has been
conducted since 1999 with data released in 2-year cycles. The
survey is conducted by National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) using a complex, stratified, multistage probability
cluster design.17 The NCHS ethics review board approved all
NHANES protocols before data collection, and all adult
participants provided written informed consent.17 The partic-
ipant response rate has consistently been �75% for inter-
views and �70% for examinations at mobile examination
centers among adults (aged ≥20 years). This study was
exempt from full board review by the institutional review
boards at the University of Texas Medical Branch and the
University of Alabama at Birmingham.
Race and ethnicity were self-reported and classified as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
other Hispanic, and other. Standardized blood pressures were
obtained by sphygmomanometer,18 and mean blood pres-
sures from the last 3 measurements were used in this study.
Blood lipids were measured enzymatically; hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) was measured by high-performance liquid chro-
matography. Detailed specimen collection and processing
instructions are described in the NHANES Laboratory Proce-
dures Manual.19 Obesity was defined according to body mass
index (BMI; in kg/m2) status (BMI ≥30).
Cardiovascular Health Metrics
Cardiovascular health metrics included blood pressure, blood
glucose, and lipid profile based on criteria modified from the
American Heart Association (AHA)20 and the National Choles-
terol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evalua-
tion, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult
Treatment Panel III)21 and the American College of Cardiology
and AHA guidelines expert panel.22 Abnormal blood pressure
status included systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg, dias-
tolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg, or use of antihypertensive
medication; blood glucose status included HbA1c ≥5.7% or
use of antidiabetic medication; and blood lipids status
included
total
cholesterol
≥240 mg/dL,
high-density
lipoprotein
(HDL)
cholesterol
<40 mg/dL
in
men
and
<50 mg/dL in women, or use of lipid-lowering medications.
Participants with blood pressure health, blood glucose health,
and blood lipid health were free from the above corresponding
risk factors, according to these metrics. We also assessed
trends in overall cardiovascular health status (presence of all
3 risk factors, presence of 1 or 2 risk factors, and freedom
from all 3 risk factors). Ideal cardiovascular health was
defined by the strict definition of the AHA: Blood pressure
measured as untreated systolic <120 mm Hg and diastolic
<80, blood glucose measured as untreated HbA1c <5.7%, and
blood
lipids
measured
as
untreated
total
cholesterol
<200 mg/dL and HDL ≥60 mg/dL.20
Statistical Analysis
Data from NHANES 1988–2014 were used to determine
secular trends in the prevalence of each CVD risk factors and
cardiovascular health status in the United States during the
past 3 decades. All analyses using NHANES data took into
account differential probabilities of selection and the complex
sample design and nonresponse and noncoverage by using
sample weights and SAS (SAS Institute) survey analysis
procedures, following NHANES analytic and reporting guide-
lines.23,24 Standard errors were calculated using Taylor series
linearization. Age-adjusted values25 were adjusted by the
direct method to the year 2010 census population using the
age groups 20 to 39, 40 to 59, and ≥60 years. Regression
models were used to assess linear trends in the prevalence of
healthy obese persons among obese adults during the period
1988–2014. Statistical analyses were carried out with SAS for
Windows version 9.4 (SAS Institute). A 2-sided P<0.05 was
determined to be statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics
The characteristics of participants from NHANES are provided
in Table 1 for each of the sequential cross-sectional surveys
from 1988 to 2014. The study population over this time frame
was composed of 18 626 obese adults. By way of illustration,
the characteristics of obese participants from the most recent
NHANES study, from 2011 to 2014, included a mean age of
47.2 years, mean systolic blood pressure of 124.4 mm Hg
and diastolic blood pressure of 72.5 mm Hg, mean HbA1c of
5.9%, mean HDL cholesterol of 47.4 mg/dL, mean total
cholesterol of 193.7 mg/dL, mean BMI of 36.0, and mean
waist circumference of 114.8 cm. In examining trends in BMI
and waist circumference in the analyses of participants with
obesity, mean BMI was observed to significantly increase from
34.7 in 1988–1992 to 36.0 in 2011–2014 (Table 2), and

 waist circumference increased from 110.1 to 114.8 cm
(Table 3).
Blood Pressure Health
Mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 126.1 mm Hg in
1988–1992 to 124.4 mm Hg in 2011–2014 (P for trend
<0.001). The decrease was observed in all age groups, for both
sexes, and in all racial and ethnic groups except for young adults
(Table S1). Mean diastolic blood pressure also decreased from
76.6 to 72.5 mm Hg over the period 1988–2014 (Table S2).
Prevalence of blood pressure health was stable during the
1988–2014 period and characterized just below 50% of the
population (Table 4). In 2011–2014, 44.1% of men and 51.5% of
women were below the threshold for the blood pressure risk
factor. Prevalence of blood pressure health decreased as a
function of age; >70% of young adults (aged 20–39 years)
exhibited healthy blood pressure metrics, whereas only 20.4%
of older adults (aged ≥60 years) did. Non-Hispanic black
participants had the lowest prevalence of blood pressure
health, whereas Mexican American participants had the highest
prevalence. For the prevalence of ideal blood pressure health
(untreated systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg and diastolic
<80), we observed similar patterns, and the prevalence was
stable, slightly above 30% (Table S3).
Blood Glucose Health
Mean HbA1c increased from 5.7% in 1988–1992 to 5.9% in
2011–2014 (P for trend <0.001). All age, sex, and racial and
ethnic groups showed increases except non-Hispanic black
participants (Table S4). Prevalence of blood glucose health
declined from 67.0% to 56.2% during the period 1988–2010
(P<0.001) but leveled off at �57% during 2011–2014
(Table 5). In 2011–2014, men and women had similar
prevalence of ideal glucose health (57.4% versus 57.1%),
and the prevalence declined by age (P<0.001); non-Hispanic
white participants had the highest prevalence, at 62.6%,
whereas non-Hispanic black participants had the lowest
prevalence, at 44.2%.
An increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (self-
reported or HbA1c ≥6.5%) contributed to declining rates of

 blood glucose health. Diabetes prevalence increased from
11.3% to 19.0% during the 1988–2014 period (Table S5).
The prevalence increased with aging. A significant increase
was observed in all age groups, for both sexes, and in
all racial and ethnic groups except for young adults (aged
20–39 years).
Blood Lipid Health
Mean blood total cholesterol in obese adults decreased
markedly by 20.8 mg/dL, from 214.5 mg/dL in the period
1988–1992 to 193.7 mg/dL in 2011–2014 (P<0.001). All
subgroups experienced substantial decrements in mean total
cholesterol during 1988–2014 (Table S6). In contrast, mean
HDL cholesterol increased from 45.4 to 47.4 mg/dL during
1988–2014 (P<0.001 for trend) (Table S7). Prevalence of
blood lipid health status changed little during the period
1988–2014 (Table 6). In 2011–2014, men had higher preva-
lence of lipids health than women (38.0% versus 31.7%), and
the non-Hispanic black group was the racial/ethnic group
with the highest prevalence of lipids health (33.7%). In all
constituencies, the prevalence of lipids health declined as a
function of age; however, the prevalence of ideal blood
cholesterol health (untreated total cholesterol <200 mg/dL
and HDL ≥60 mg/dL) increased from 1988 to 2006 (3.3–
5.2%) and then leveled off during 2007–2014 (Table S8).
Presence of All 3 CVD Risk Factors
Table 7 shows the trends in prevalence of the presence of all
3 risk factors among obese adults. Prevalence increased by
37% from 16.4% to 22.4% during the period 1988–2014. An

 increase was noted in all ages, sexes, and racial/ethnic
subgroups. The increase occurred in parallel with a decline in
the prevalence of healthy blood glucose, which is the
predominant explanation accounting for the rise in the
prevalence of presence of all 3 risk factors.
Presence of 1 to 2 CVD Risk Factors
Table 8 shows the trends in the prevalence of presence of 1
to 2 risk factors among obese adults. The prevalence
decreased significantly from 69.6% to 62.4% during the
1988–2014 period. Only young adults (aged 20–39 years)
and non-Hispanic black participants did not see a decrease
trend in prevalence over this time frame.
Freedom From CVD Risk Factors
As can be seen in Table 9, the prevalence of participants
free from all 3 CVD risk factors remained stable at �15%
among the general adult obese population and in all sex
and racial/ethnic subgroups during the period 1988–2014.
The prevalence remained highest in participants aged 20
to 39 years and declined progressively in the subgroups
aged 40 to 59 and ≥60 years. Very few adult obese
participants
met
the
criteria
for
ideal
cardiovascular
health, and the prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health
remained stable at �2% during the 1988–2014 period
(Table 10).
We summarized the trends in cardiovascular health status
in obese adults during NHANES 1988–2014 in Figure.

 Prevalence of freedom from all 3 CVD risk factors remained
stable at �15% during 1988–2014, whereas prevalence of
the presence of all 3 risk factors was greatly increased
during this period. In addition, prevalence of ideal cardio-
vascular health remained very low at <2% over the period
1988–2014.
Discussion
Using data from NHANES III and NHANES 1999–2014, we
assessed the secular trends in the prevalence of CVD risk
factors and in cardiovascular health status in an adult
obese population in the United States over the past 3
decades. Among 18 626 obese adults from NHANES 1988–
2014, mean systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pres-
sure, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels all
showed improvement. In contrast, mean HbA1c levels
increased during this period. Healthy status was ascribed
to each factor based on accepted risk thresholds. During
the
period
1988–2014,
the
prevalence
of
participants
meeting
criteria
for
blood
pressure
health
and
blood
cholesterol health remained stable, whereas the prevalence
of blood glucose health decreased significantly. Prevalence
of freedom from all 3 CVD risk factors remained stable at

Prevalence of ideal blood lipid health improved from 1988
to 2006 and then leveled off during the 2007–2014 period
but remained extremely low (<5%).
Cardiometabolic Health in People With Obesity
Obese participants who are free from cardiometabolic disease
risk factors are termed “metabolically healthy obese.”9,26 The
existence of the metabolically healthy obese condition has
been controversial27–30; however, we have recently added
some
clarification

 conclusions rest heavily on the definition of metabolically
healthy obese.31 We4,5,10 and others12–14 have shown that 1
or 2 metabolic syndrome traits confer increased risk of
diabetes mellitus and CVD outcomes and that such persons
are relatively insulin resistant. The problem with many reports
minimizing the importance of the metabolically healthy obese
condition is the inclusion of participants with 1 or 2 risk
factors among metabolically healthy participants. When
“metabolically healthy” is defined as the absence of all
metabolic syndrome risk factors, there is minimal or no
contribution of BMI to CVD events or mortality, and cumu-
lative rates of diabetes mellitus remain quite low regardless of

 BMI. Obese participants with metabolic syndrome consis-
tently have much greater risks for diabetes mellitus and CVD
than their counterparts assigned to the metabolically healthy
subgroup.12–14 We have also defined a subgroup of patients
with suboptimal metabolic health who have 1 or 2 risk factors
but who do not meet criteria for metabolic syndrome, and
those persons have intermediate risks of incident diabetes
mellitus and CVD outcomes.10,31 BMI interacts with metabolic
status to significantly augment diabetes risks such that
progressive increments in BMI augment the risk of diabetes
mellitus; however, the impact of BMI on rates of diabetes
mellitus is greater among those with metabolic syndrome (ie,
metabolically unhealthy obese), less so in those with subop-
timal metabolic health, and least in metabolically healthy
obese persons. In any event, cardiometabolic risk factors
confer much higher risk of diabetes mellitus, CVD, stroke, and
mortality than BMI per se.
Our finding that the prevalence of metabolically healthy
obese participants who are free from all CVD risk factors
has remained relatively stable at �15% during the past 3
decades in the United States agrees with a large collabo-
rative study in Europe encompassing 163 517 participants
(the BioSHaRE-EU Healthy Obese Project). This European
study demonstrated that the frequency of metabolically
healthy obesity was 7% to 28% in women and 2% to 19% in
men
in
various
European
countries.32
Although
these
persons have lower risks of total and CVD mortality and
type 2 diabetes mellitus, the proportion of metabolically
healthy persons among all obese adults is relatively low. We
also observed that the prevalence of ideal cardiovascular
health among obese people was extremely low over the past
3 decades, remaining consistently <2%, and that very few
adult obese participants met the criteria for ideal blood
cholesterol health (<5%). These results are consistent with
previously reported very low prevalence of meeting cardio-
vascular health among the general adult population in the
United States.33 Consistent with a previous report on the
prevalence of CVD risk factors in US adults from 1960 to
2000,16 our results indicated that blood glucose health
continued to deteriorate in obese people during the period
1988–2014.
Further
studies
are
need
to
unravel
the
underlying causes of this troubling phenomena. The improve-
ments in mean blood pressure and blood cholesterol may
reflect the healthy trends in the US population, including
decreases
in
the
proportion
of
dietary
saturated
fat;
increases in fruits and vegetables and the proportion of
polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats in the diet34–37;
decreased smoking38–40; and increased awareness, identifi-
cation, and pharmacological treatment of high cholesterol
and blood pressure levels.25,41
Obese participants with metabolic syndrome are at
greater risk of diabetes and CVD outcomes.12–14 In our
study, the prevalence of obese people with all 3 CVD risk
factors kept increasing over the past 3 decades in the United
States. The increasing trend of obese people with all 3 CVD
risk factors, commensurate with a decline in those with 1 to
2 risk factors, suggested an overall deterioration in health
among people with obesity. In recent years, almost 1 in 4
obese adults had all 3 CVD risk factors. During the period
1988–2010, adults in the United States experienced a
significant decrease in diet quality and an increase in the
prevalence of sedentary lifestyles.33 Those changes may
partially explain our findings regarding the increasing trend in
prevalence of presence of all 3 CVD risk factors in obese
adults.
Implications
Although some data point to a leveling off of prevalence rates
of obesity in recent years, our data indicate that overall
metabolic health is declining among people with obesity in the
United States. Furthermore, deteriorating metabolic health
can be attributed primarily to worsening glycemic health
because mean values of HbA1c have been increasing,
whereas mean blood pressure and lipid metrics have been
improving. These patterns of worsening metabolic health
constitute an increase in risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and
underlie increasing prevalence rates for diabetes mellitus.
Without intensive interventions, obese people do not lose
sufficient body weight to become lean, regardless of their
age31; however, moderate weight loss of 10% of body weight
is sufficient to dramatically reduce progression to diabetes
among high-risk persons.42,43 The deteriorated blood glucose
health among obese adults in the United States calls for
lifestyle interventions (diet and exercise) on a national scale.
Community-based public health intervention programs may
help increase physical activity and diet quality to alleviate the
problem.44,45 Obese adults at high risk of diabetes and CVD
may require more intense approaches to achieve weight loss
using lifestyle interventions alone or in combination with
weight loss medications.42,43,46,47 A complication-centric
approach may be adopted to guide the selection of weight
loss therapy options (eg, more aggressive treatment in those
obese patients with complications or at higher risk of
complications to optimize outcomes, the benefit–risk ratio
of the intervention, and the cost-effectiveness of care).48,49 In
the context of the current data, those obese adults who are
metabolically unhealthy or perhaps those with suboptimal
metabolic health represent patients who will benefit most
from intensive obesity management. As suggested by Yang
et al,33 coordinated efforts aligning CVD prevention and
control activities across the public and private sectors in the
United States are needed reduce the burden of CVD among
the obese population.50

 Strengths and Limitations
The main strengths of this study involve the use of sequential
surveys over time, consisting of nationally representative data
from NHANES. These data from the past 3 decades enabled
us to assess the secular trends of prevalence of individual
CVD risk factors and overall CVD health status among obese
people in a nationally representative sample. Limitations of
this study include the sample size, which may not be large
enough to permit extensive subgroup analyses of each age,
sex, and racial or ethnic group. In addition, we were able to
assess only the trends in major racial and ethnic groups (eg,
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican Amer-
ican); we could not further differentiate other racial and ethnic
groups because of the sample size limit. Furthermore,
because the duration of physical activity (in minutes) changed
substantially since the 2007–2008 cycle, we did not assess
physical activity among obese adults during the 1988–2014
period.
Conclusions
During past 3 decades, blood pressure health and blood lipid
health
remained
stable,
whereas
blood
glucose
health
deteriorated among adults with obesity. During the period
1988–2014, the prevalence of freedom from all 3 CVD risk
factors remained stable at �15% among the adult obese
population, whereas prevalence of the presence of all 3 risk
factors greatly increased from 16.4% to 22.4%. In 2011–
2014, almost 1 in 4 obese people had all 3 risk factors. The
increase in the number of obese people with all 3 risk factors
was largely the result of worsening glycemic status. The data
support continuing efforts to target obese people who are at
risk with weight loss therapy to improve cardiometabolic
disease health and to prevent progression to diabetes
mellitus.
