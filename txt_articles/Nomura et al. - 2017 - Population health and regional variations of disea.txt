Summary
Background Japan has entered the era of super-ageing and advanced health transition, which is increasingly putting 
pressure on the sustainability of its health system. The level and pace of this health transition might vary across 
regions within Japan and concern is growing about increasing regional variations in disease burden. The Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive, comparable 
framework. We used data from GBD 2015 with the aim to quantify the burden of disease and injuries, and to attribute 
risk factors in Japan at a subnational, prefecture-level.
Methods We used data from GBD 2015 for 315 causes and 79 risk factors of death, disease, and injury incidence and 
prevalence to measure the burden of diseases and injuries in Japan and in the 47 Japanese prefectures from 
1990 to 2015. We extracted data from GBD 2015 to assess mortality, causes of death, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived 
with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy, and healthy life expectancy (HALE) in 
Japan and its 47 prefectures. We split extracted data by prefecture and applied GBD methods to generate estimates of 
burden, and attributable burden due to known risk factors. We examined the prefecture-level relationships of common 
health system inputs (eg, health expenditure and workforces) to the GBD outputs in 2015 to address underlying 
determinants of regional health variations.
Findings Life expectancy at birth in Japan increased by 4·2 years from 79·0 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
79·0 to 79·0) to 83·2 years (83·1 to 83·2) between 1990 and 2015. However, the gaps between prefectures with the 
lowest and highest life expectancies and HALE have widened, from 2·5 to 3·1 years and from 2·3 to 2·7 years, 
respectively, from 1990 to 2015. Although overall age-standardised death rates decreased by 29·0% (28·7 to 29·3) 
from 1990 to 2015, the rates of mortality decline in this period substantially varied across the prefectures, ranging 
from –32·4% (–34·8 to –30·0) to –22·0% (–20·4 to –20·1). During the same time period, the rate of age-standardised 
DALYs was reduced overall by 19·8% (17·9 to 22·0). The reduction in rates of age-standardised YLDs was very small 
by 3·5% (2·6 to 4·3). The pace of reduction in mortality and DALYs in many leading causes has largely levelled off 
since 2005. Known risk factors accounted for 34·5% (32·4 to 36·9) of DALYs; the two leading behavioural risk factors 
were unhealthy diets and tobacco smoking in 2015. The common health system inputs were not associated with age-
standardised death and DALY rates in 2015.
Interpretation Japan has been successful overall in reducing mortality and disability from most major diseases. 
However, progress has slowed down and health variations between prefectures is growing. In view of the limited 
association between the prefecture-level health system inputs and health outcomes, the potential sources of regional 
variations, including subnational health system performance, urgently need assessment.

Introduction
Japan is one of the fastest ageing countries in the world 
with a population that has started to shrink since 2008 
mainly due to a low fertility rate.1 The number of Japanese 
people aged 65 years or older has nearly quadrupled in the 
past 40 years to 27% of the total population in 2016,2 
making Japan the country with the highest proportion of 
elderly people in the world.3 This figure is expected to 
increase to 35% of the population by 2040, and to 40% by 
2060.4 The ageing population has a substantial effect on 
disease structure, turning Japan into the advanced stage of 
epidemiological transitions—ie, elderly Japanese people

experience more chronic and multimorbidity, which 
require long-term care and put pressures on health-care 
expenditure and use of resources.5 However, the pace of 
epidemiological transitions as well as population decline 
varies substantially by region,6,7 and such regional vari-
ations could have great influence on the performance of 
regional health systems and population health outcomes.8 
In Japan, regional variations in health outcomes, its 
causes, per 
formance of regional health systems, and the 
effects of social determinants of health are becoming 
increasingly complex with the country’s transition to a 
super-ageing society.5,9,10
Although regional health variations associated with 
communicable diseases have been narrowing over time 
globally, disease burden due to non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) and injury varies markedly across 
regions.11–13 Previous subnational studies in the UK,11 
Mexico,12 and China13 shed light on the importance of the 
subnational estimates of disease burden. These enabled 
policy makers to improve understanding of the health 
needs of each region and to inform domestic health 
policy making.11–13 The issue of regional variations in 
health is especially relevant in Japan, as the country is 
confronted by a super-ageing population and increasing 
health expenditure.8 In this context, what is happening in 
Japan—the country at the forefront of the world’s hyper-
ageing societies—has many implications for other 
countries. However, to our knowledge, no systematic 
subnational comparative assessment of disease burden 
and risk factors have been done in the context of Japan.14 
Empirical evidence in Japan would be immensely helpful 
to reveal the features of an ageing society in the advanced 
stage of epidemiological transition, and understanding 
how to respond to regional health variations.
Using the latest data from the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 
2015), we compared mortality, causes of death, years of 
life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), life expectancy at 
birth, and healthy life expectancy at birth (HALE, the 
average number of years that a newborn can expect to live 
in full health), as well as attributable risk factors in Japan’s 
47 prefectures—the country’s first-order administrative 
division. This study comes at a time when both national 
and local health policy makers are reviewing and assess-
ing priorities for action in light of the rapidly ageing 
population and growing regional health variation.6,7 This 
subnational analysis we report here supports mapping of 
the disease burden in Japan; and contributes to national 
and region-specific health policies.
Methods
Overview
GBD 2015 provides updated and improved data and 
methods from previous GBD versions (2010 and 2013).15–18 
We used data from GBD 2015 for 315 causes and 
79 risk factors of death, disease, and injury incidence 
and prevalence to measure the burden of diseases 
and injuries in Japan and in the 47 Japanese prefectures 
from 1990 to 2015. The population demographic of each 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Japan is one of the most successful countries in the world for 
many health indicators, but the level and pace of progress in 
health are not unique across the country and concern is 
growing about increasing health variations in Japan and its 
prefectures. These trends suggest Japan is experiencing a more 
complex process of health transition than historically observed; 
however, to our knowledge, no systematic and comprehensive 
study has been implemented to explore the variation within the 
country. Attributable risks have been calculated for some causes 
(eg, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and for some 
disorders (eg, cancer) but are not available in a comprehensive 
framework covering multiple risks and diseases because no 
single accessible data source describing disease burden by cause 
exists in Japan. 
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess GBD results at 
the prefecture level in Japan, using a range of routine and 
published data sources. Our comprehensive subnational 
comparisons within Japan’s 47 prefectures provide new insights 
into health trends and determinants, particularly in light of the 
rapid population ageing process and growing regional 
variations in health.
Implications of all available evidence
Despite substantial reductions in the mortality and disability 
from most preventable diseases and improvement in life 
expectancy since 1990, many leading causes of death varied 
markedly at prefecture level in Japan. National and local 
health policies should therefore address region-specific 
health interventions in the most at-risk prefectures, aiming 
at dealing with regional variations in health. Preventive 
public health measures still have a huge capacity to reduce 
the continuing burden of preventable diseases via scaling up 
of investment in research and development of new and 
better prevention, treatment, and care strategies. Increasing 
levels of multimorbidity—because of the growing effect of 
survivorship, together with the super-ageing population—
need to be addressed in Japan’s recent health system 
reforms, in which a range of public services spanning health 
and social care services that respond to the specific needs, 
contexts, and circumstances of individual patients are 
offered. Although health in Japan is improving, substantial 
opportunities exist for a healthier population in Japan via 
modifiable risk factor approaches throughout life, especially 
through tackling of unhealthy diet and tobacco smoking.

prefecture can be found elsewhere.4 The methods used in 
GBD 2015, including the systematic approach to collating 
cause of death from different countries, the mapping 
across different revisions and national variants of the 
International Classification of Diseases and Injuries and 
Related Health Problems (ICD), redistribution of deaths 
assigned to so-called garbage codes, and the cause of 
death modelling approach used for each cause, have 
been described in detail elsewhere.15–18 Unless indicated 
otherwise, we present results in terms of age-standard-
ised rates, as derived from world population standards 
developed for GBD 2015.15
Our estimates for each measure (eg, deaths, DALYs, 
life expectancy) depend on the Bayesian approach and, 
unless noted otherwise, 95% uncertainty intervals 
(UIs)—also known as credible intervals—are presented 
along with them. These UIs include uncertainty in our 
estimates that depend on the sample size of data, 
adjustments to different sources of all-cause mortality, 
and cause-of-death model specification and estimation. 
Uncertainty from all of these sources is propagated into 
the final quantities of interest by taking 1000 draws 
from the posterior distribution of each component 
quantity of interest.15–18 We were unable to quantify and 
include uncertainty in garbage code redistribution 
algorithms—statistical models adopted in GBD 2015 to 
reassign deaths in garbage codes to more specific causes 
of death.15 In this study, we focus on specific data and 
analyses used to quantify mortality, causes of death, 
YLLs, YLDs, DALYs, life expectancy at birth and HALE 
at birth.
Mortality, cause of death, life expectancy, and YLLs
We used national population censuses and national and 
prefecture-level records on all-cause mortality derived 
from Japan’s national vital registration systems. Vital 
registration data from 1990 to 2013 were included to align 
with GBD 2015, which spans 25 years from 1990 to 2015. 
Additional details on the full range of data sources are in 
the appendix (pp 10–25). Details for GBD 2015 estimation 
methods for all-cause mortality have been reported 
previously.15,19
As described previously,15,20 an expanded cause-of-
death database was constructed for GBD 2015. To 
generate estimates on cause-specific mortality rate, we 
analysed prefecture-level vital registration data from 
1990 to 2013. We sought to account for vital registration 
data quality and completeness, which included 
adjustment of cause-of-death data and standardisation 
of data to align with cause classifications and 
hierarchies in the GBD 2015 study.15 We then 
systematically identified causes of death that could not 
or should not be classified as underlying causes of 
death (so-called garbage codes), and applied standard 
GBD 2015 garbage code redistribution algorithms. To 
examine the changes in life expectancy at birth in 2015 
from 2005, we have applied the life expectancy cause-
specific decomposition method developed by Beltran-
Sanchez, Preston, and Canudas-Romo.21 We computed 
YLLs using the standard GBD methods whereby we 
multiplied each death by the reference life expectancy 
at each age. The reference life expectancy at birth is 
86·59 years, which is based on the lowest observed 
death rates for each 5-year age group in populations 
larger than 5 million.15
Disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs
Data sources used for quantifying non-fatal outcomes 
in Japan are in the appendix (pp 10–25). We used 
DisMod-MR 21, an updated Bayesian-regression analytic 
tool,16 to synthesise consistent estimates of disease inci-
dence, prevalence, remission, excess mortality, and 
cause-specific mortality rates. Details of the estimation 
method, including the source code are published in the 
methods appendix of GBD 2015 publications.16 Following 
GBD 2015 methods,16 we multiplied prevalence of each 
sequela by the disability weight for the corresponding 
health state to calculate YLDs for the particular sequela. 
The sum of all YLDs for relevant sequelae equated to 
overall YLDs for each disease. GBD 2015 used the same 
disability weights as in GBD 2013, details of which 
including 
data 
collection 
and 
disability 
weight 
construction, have been described previously.22
DALYs, HALE, and attributable risks
Following GBD 2015 methods,17 national and prefecture-
level DALYs were computed by summing YLLs and 
YLDs for each cause, age, and sex in 1990, 2005, and 
2015. HALE was calculated for Japan and each prefecture 
using multiple-decrement life tables and estimated 
YLDs per person.17 To calculate risk-attributable fractions 
of disease burden by cause, we modelled the effects of 
risk exposure levels, documented relative risks associated 
with risk exposure and specific health outcomes, and 
computed counterfactual levels of risk exposure on 
estimates of national and prefecture-level deaths, YLLs, 
YLDs, and DALYs. Detailed descriptions of the GBD 
2015 methods for risk factor assessment and attribution 
are found elsewhere.18
Health system inputs and health outcomes in 2015
Health systems are important underlying determinants 
of health and are mainly responsible for health 
variations.23 Correlations of prefecture-level per capita 
health expenditure and number of health workforce per 
population (physicians, registered nurses, and public 
health nurses)—common inputs for health system and 
major control levers for the Japanese health policy—to 
health outcomes in 2015, such as mortality and DALYs 
were calculated using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. 
We also used a univariate linear regression analysis to 
assess the association between them. We extracted data 
for total health expenditure per capita for each prefecture 
in 2015 and the number of physicians, registered nurses,

the database maintained by the Ministry of Health,

was 71·5 years (69·1–73·7) for men and 76·3 years 
(73·3–78·9) for women. The approximate 9-year gap 
between life expectancy at birth and HALE at birth 
observed in 1990 has been static until 2015 (appendix 
pp 26–31). The gap between prefectures with the lowest 
and highest HALE in 1990 was 2·3 years. As with life

Figure 1: Life expectancy at birth in Japan and the 47 prefectures in 2015 and its change from 2005 to 2015 decomposed into the contribution of GBD level 2 cause group for (A) both sexes 
combined, (B) men, and (C) women
Causes to the left of the 2005 life expectancy values reflect causes that contributed to reduced life expectancy between 2005 and 2015. Causes to the right of the 2005 life expectancy values reflect 
causes that contributed to increased life expectancy between 2005 and 2015. GBD=Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors.

expectancy, this gap in HALE among prefectures 
increased by 2015 to 2·7 years.
All-cause age-standardised death rates decreased by 
29·0% (95% UI 28·7–29·3) between 1990 and 2015, 
falling from 584·1 deaths per 100 000 people (583·2–585·1) 
in 1990 to 414·8 deaths per 100 000 people (413·3–416·4) 
in 2015 (appendix pp 26–31). Prefecture-level reductions 
in all-cause age-standardised death rates largely varied 
from 22·0% (20·1–24·0) in Okinawa to 32·4% (30·0–34·8) 
in Shiga between 1990 and 2015. During the same time 
period, the rate of age-standardised DALYs reduced by 
19·8% overall (17·9–22·0). The reduction in the rate of 
age-standardised YLLs was 33·4% (33·0–33·8; appendix 
pp 32–37), indicating a proportionately larger reduction

in premature mortality when compared with overall 
mortality. By contrast, reduction in rates of age-
standardised YLDs was very small between 1990 and 2015 
(3·5% [2·6–4·3]).
In the 10 years between 2005 and 2015, all 47 prefectures 
had more than 1 year of life expectancy gains (figure 1), 
but the gap in the gains between prefectures was 
distinctive. Across the prefectures, decreased mortality 
because of cardiovascular diseases (mostly cerebrovascular 
diseases and ischaemic heart diseases) and neoplasms or 
cancers was the leading driver of increased life expectancy.
The leading causes of death using broad disease 
categories (level 3 in the GBD cause hierarchy) are in 
figure 2. The top three causes of death in 1990 
(cerebrovascular diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, and 
lower respiratory infection) remained at the top in 2015, 
despite substantial declines in their age-standardised 
rates (–19·3% [95% UI –21·3 to –16·8], –11·6% 
[–13·9 to –9·4], and –6·5% [–10·5 to –2·5]; figure 2). In 
addition, the speed of mortality decline in these 
three leading causes and many other causes has levelled 
off since 2005 for both men and women (average annual 
percentage change in age-standardised death rates 
between 1990 and 2005 was –2·6% for cerebrovascular 
diseases, –2·6% ischaemic heart diseases, and –1·2% for 
lower respiratory infection; after 2005, –1·9%, –1·2%, 
and –0·7%). Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias 
were the only causes out of the ten leading causes that 
showed a significant increase in age-standardised death 
rates since 2005 (3·7% [95% UI 2·3–5·0]). The leading 
causes of YLLs are shown in the appendix (p 1).
Age-standardised death rates for GBD’s most detailed 
causes between Japan and the 47 prefectures in 2015 are 
shown in figure 3. A subnational comparison of age-
standardised rates for YLLs are shown in figure appendix 2 
(p 2). Many of the leading causes of mortality and YLLs 
showed striking variation by prefecture (figure 3). For 
example, due to cerebrovascular disease (combined 
mortality of ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, and 
other types of stroke), Shiga’s age-standardised death 
rates (37·9 per 100 000 people)—the lowest in Japan in 
2015—was 1·6 times lower than Iwate’s, which was the 
highest (62·0 per 100 000 people). For ischaemic heart 
disease, the age-standardised death rate was 1·5 times 
lower in Kumamoto (lowest; 35·9 per 100 000 people) and 
Saitama (highest; 55·0 per 100 000 people). Some causes 
had distinct patterns largely determined by geography 
(higher rates in the north, and lower in the central 
and south), and others did not. 
Cerebrovascular disease and ischaemic heart diseases 
are now at similar levels nationally in Japan (figure 4). As 
with mortality, the pace of reduction in DALYs in these 
causes largely levelled off since 2005. The average yearly 
percentage change in age-standardised DALY rates was 
–2·6% for both ischaemic heart diseases and cerebro-
vascular disease from 1990 to 2005, which reduced to

–1·5% for ischaemic heart diseases and –2·1% for 
cerebrovascular disease after 2005. With no significant 
change in age-standardised DALY rates since 2005, low 
back and neck pain, sense organ diseases (consisting of 
hearing loss and vision loss), and depressive disorders 
were leading causes of DALYs in 2015, although they did 
not cause substantial death and YLLs but major disabilities. 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are distinctive 
causes of DALYs, which was only one (of the ten leading 
causes) that significantly increased age-standardised DALY 
rates between 2005 and 2015 by 3·3% (95% UI 2·2–4·5).
Age-standardised DALY rates by Japan’s 47 prefectures 
for GBD’s most detailed causes are in figure 5. Many 
causes, that were also significant causes of death (eg, 
ischaemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular disease), 
showed substantial variation between prefectures, which 
largely followed patterns determined by geography. As 
with mortality, the difference between prefectures with

the lowest and highest DALY rates in 2015, was 1·7 times 
for ischaemic heart disease and 1·8 times for cerebro-
vascular disease (combined DALY rates of ischaemic 
stroke, and haemorrhagic and other stroke). Many dis-
abling conditions that predominantly lead to DALYs but 
do not cause substantial death, such as low back and neck 
pain, 
major 
depression, 
anxiety 
disorders, 
and 
schizophrenia, were homogeneous across the prefectures, 
revealing no distinct patterns.
Overall for Japan in 2015, 47·1% (95% UI 44·9–49·3) of 
total deaths were attributable to identified risk factors: 
behavioural risk factors accounted for 33·7% (30·9–36·8) 
of total deaths, metabolic risks for 24·5% (22·6–26·4), 
and environmental and occupational risks for 6·7% 
(5·4–8·2; data not shown). Similarly, all identified risk 
factors jointly explained 34·5% (95% UI 32·4–36·9) of 
DALYs, with the remaining 65∙6% DALYs as yet 
unexplained by the risk factors analysed. Nationally, 
behavioural risk factors made a greater contribution to 
DALYs in 2015 (25·2% of total DALYs [22·9–27·7]) than 
metabolic risks (16·4% [15·2–17·6]) or environmental 
and occupational risks (4·4% [3·9–4·1]).
Dietary risks—combined risks of diets high in sodium, 
and diets low in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and nuts 
and seeds—were the leading risk for DALYs both in men 
(13·8% [95% UI 11·7–16·3]) and women (9·3% [7·8–11·5]) 
in 2015. Among the dietary risks, high sodium con-
sumption was the dominant risk for DALYs in both men 
and women (men 4·4% [2·2–7·3]; women 3·0% [1·4–5·2]). 
Tobacco smoking was the second leading risk factor for 
men (12·5% [11·0–14·0]). A number of metabolic risks, 
such as high blood pressure and high fasting plasma 
glucose, were among the five leading risk factors for DALYs 
in both men and women. The contributions of these risk 
factors to DALYs did not vary much across the prefectures 
in 2015 (appendix pp 3–5). For example, dietary risks 
accounted for 10·4% (8·7–12·4) of total DALYs in Fukuoka 
(lowest) and 13·5% (11·3–15·6) in Aomori (highest). High 
sodium—the dominant downstream risk of dietary risks—
explained 3·2% (1·5–5·4) of total DALYs in Okinawa 
(lowest) and 4·5% (2·2–7·4) in Akita (highest). For 
mortality, smoking was the leading risk factor for men 
(18·9% [95% UI 17·4–20·4]), while dietary risks were the 
major contributors to the total deaths for both men (18·8% 
[15·7–21·8], second rank) and women (18·0% [15·0–21·4], 
first rank). The contributions of these risk factors to 
mortality also did not vary much across the prefectures in 
2015 (appendix pp 6–8).
We observed a distinct north–south gradient—with 
higher values in the south and lower in the north for the 
health system inputs analysed (appendix p 38). The 
prefectural mean of per capita health expenditure was 
US$2246 (SD 311). In 2015, the average number of health 
workforce per 100 000 people across prefectures in 2014 
was 237 (39) physicians, 957 (178) registered nurses, and 
47 (12) public health nurses. The associations between 
the age-standardised death rates in 2015 and prefecture’s 
per capita health expenditure (in 2015), number of 
physicians, registered nurses, and public health nurses 
per 100 000 people (in 2014) are shown in figure 6. Their 
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were all very small 
(0·12, 0·10, 0·02, and –0·05, respectively), indicating 
very weak correlations, and there were no statistically 
significant relationship between them with small

Discussion
Japan has had the highest average life expectancy in the 
world since 1986.27 Annual mortality statistics show a 
decline in age-standardised mortality rates in Japan since 
1998 to present,28 except for 2011, when an unprecedented 
earthquake of magnitude 9·0 off the Pacific coast of Japan 
killed more than 18 000 people.29 Across the prefectures, 
decreased mortality due to cardiovascular diseases and 
neoplasms has been the leading driver of increased

and other dementia has substantially increased in both 
number of people dying and age-standardised death rates 
since 2005, indicating that improvements in overall 
mortality in Japan might have levelled off mainly due to 
these causes. Similar to mortality, the pace of reduction in 
DALYs in these leading causes also largely slowed down 
since 2005. All-cause age-standardised YLLs decreased by 
33·4% between 1990 and 2015; however, the reduction in 
the rate of age-standardised YLDs was only 3·5% 
(appendix pp 32–37). These findings indicate an increase 
in the proportion of the population with morbidity, 
particularly age-related disorders.
One important implication of our results is that, 
coupled with the slowed-down progress in population 
health, Japan is experiencing a morbidity expansion due 
to its health transition. This expansion will require a shift 
in the health system framework in Japan. Yasuhisa 
Shiozaki, the Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare, 
commissioned the “Health Care 2035 Advisory Panel” in 
2015 that brought together young Japanese health policy 
leaders to develop a long-term strategy for Japan’s future 
health policy for the next 20 years. Their report—Japan 
Vision: Health Care 203530,31—proposes integrating health 
care into social and community system frame 
works 
around the country. The report also proposes that Japan’s 
new health system should continue to value equality and 
solidarity, while recognising individual patient priorities 
and values and incorporating global health perspectives. 
The report further suggests a shift in focus from inputs to 
outcomes. The system should redirect attention from the 
quantity of services provided to the quality of care, from 
cure to health maintenance and wellbeing, from central 
regulation to professional self-regulation, and from 
specialisation of services to integrated approaches across 
medical and social service sectors.30
Gaps in life expectancy and HALE between prefectures 
have widened from 2·5 to 3·1 years in 1990 and from 
2·3 to 2·7 years in 2015 (appendix pp 26–31). Consistent 
with other analyses,14 a broad tendency of higher mortality 
was observed in the north. Age-standardised mortality

reduction between 1990 and 2015 varied across the 
prefectures. These results could indicate an unequal 
health transition in the past 2 decades across Japan, and 
regional variations in national and local public health 
policy and strategy should therefore be addressed.
Many disabling conditions that predominantly lead to 
DALYs but do not cause substantial death, such as low 
back and neck pain, and depressive disorders, had no 
distinct patterns across the prefectures. This low regional 
variation might be an artifact of our limited coverage of 
subnational data sources for Japan. Nevertheless, many of 
the leading causes of mortality and YLLs, including 
cerebrovascular disease, ischaemic heart diseases, and 
self-harm showed remarkable variations by prefecture 
(appendix p 2). In view of the prominence of the different 
variation patterns in causes across regions, cause-specific 
and region-specific health interventions might need to be 
addressed in the most at-risk prefectures to deal with 
regional variations.
Several plausible mechanisms exist as to why some 
prefectures are achieving better health outcomes than 
others. First, according to the National Health and 
Nutrition Survey 2012, a nationwide survey conducted by 
the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, statistically 
significant, slight variations by prefectures were observed 
in major lifestyle-associated behavioural factors (eg, salt 
intake and smoking) among adults aged 20 years and 
older.32 These variations are consistent with the patterns 
by geography we found in our study (higher death or 
DALY rates in the north, lower in the central and south). 
Therefore, regional variations in lifestyles might explain 
the regional health variations. However, importantly, 
our estimates showed that the contributions of such 
behavioural risk factors (ie, dietary risks, smoking, 
alcohol consumption) to DALYs as well as mortality did 
not vary much across the prefectures (appendix pp 3–8). 
This implies that regional variations in health might be 
driven by other unobserved factors, such as health 
system performance, which varies across the country.5 
However, as mentioned previously, the low regional 
variation in risk factor contributions could be due to our 
poor data coverage of limited subnational data sources.
Second, a north–south gradient (lower–higher) was 
suggested in major proxy indicators of health system 
inputs, such as per capita health expenditures, and 
health workforce in numbers (appendix p 38), which 
might differentiate health outcomes across the country. 
However, prefecture-level associations between these 
health system inputs and mortality and DALYs were 
weak and not significant, suggesting other social 
determinants of health might suitably capture the 
regional variations in health (ie, socioeconomic and 
political contexts, including income and education 
levels23). Health-care spending is strongly linked with 
health conditions and varies across Japan.8,33 In future 
rounds of subnational analysis for the GBD study 
in Japan, we plan to quantify the effect of personal 
health-care spending and public health spending as well 
as other social determinants of health on the outputs 
from GBD, to identify prefecture-level characteristics 
potentially associated with improved health outcomes.
As observed elsewhere in the world,34 the overall 
proportion of disease burden decreased in Japan between 
1990 and 2015 largely due to a substantial decline in the 
incidence of preventable diseases (eg, cerebrovascular 
diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, lower respiratory 
infection, and some types of cancer), resulting in increased 
life expectancy. However, these diseases remained top 
causes of death and DALYs in 2015, which underlines the 
need to scale up effective coverage of preventive and 
public health measures nationally, such as screening and 
risk factor reduction to tackle the continuing burden of 
preventable diseases. Simultaneously, the scale-up of 
preventive measures should raise debates on investment 
in comparative cost-effectiveness assessment of policies 
and programmes to aid decision making.
In Japan, in 2015, behavioural risk factors made a greater 
contribution to both DALYs (25·2%) and mortality (33·7%) 
than did metabolic risks (DALYs 16·4%; mortality 24·5%) 
or environmental and occupational risks (DALYs 4·4%; 
mortality 6·7%). Unhealthy diets (particularly diets high 
in salt) and tobacco smoking were the two most important 
behavioural risk factors for many health conditions.
Smoking also increases the probability of many of 
serious clinical conditions.35–37 In 2017, Japan is expected to 
pass its strictest-ever smoking laws that would ban 
smoking on the premises of public facilities, such as 
restaurants, pubs, hospitals, and municipal offices. 
However, opposition is mounting from members of 
parliament. A group of parliamentarians has suggested 
that Japan should instead focus on smoke segregation 
policies that divide smoking and non-smoking areas in 
public places (ie, designated smoking rooms), which is not 
in line with the 2010 agreement adopted by WHO and the 
International Olympic Committee. Japan is responsible 
for hosting a smoke-free Olympics Games in 2020.38
In view of our findings, addressing of these modifiable 
risk factors throughout an individual’s life (namely risk 
factor approach) within national and local public health 
policies and strategies could enable the whole population 
to age better than in the past and maximise their health 
and longevity. More importantly, the contributions of 
these modifiable behavioural risk factors to DALYs and 
mortality did not vary much across the prefectures 
(appendix pp 3–8), implying that national systematic 
action could make a significant difference.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a 
comprehensive picture of disease burden and patterns in 
Japan and prefectures—the country with the fastest 
ageing population in the world. Our subnational esti-
mates of disease burden are the first and crucial step 
toward a greater understanding of prefecture-specific 
health priorities aligned to national and local health 
policy and programme implementations. Our study,

therefore, can help not only guide policy agendas and 
programme implementation, and facilitate intervention 
prioritisation, nationally and locally, to further improve 
the population health in Japan but also identify particular 
regions in the county where more targeted policy 
attention might be required.
Our analyses are, however, subject to the same 
limitations described for GBD 2015,15–18,39 as well as 
specific limitations associated with data availability for 
Japan. First, we had limited data access to up-to-date vital 
data, especially cause of death. Registration of death that 
occurred in Japan is a legal requirement. Therefore, we 
assumed mortality data were complete. However, a time 
lag between data registration and becoming available in 
databases exists. Second, sources of subnational data are 
not available at the prefecture level for the estimates of 
prevalence and incidence for several diseases as well as 
their risk factors. Our subnational estimates depend on 
the GBD Bayesian models, which allow for borrowing 
strength from other studies while using available 
covariates as predictors for imputing the missing data. 
Addressing of the sparse availability of individual-level 
morbidity data, such as patient records (ie, hospital 
inpatient and out 
patient data) by prefecture will 
substantially improve future analytic efforts. Finally, as 
with other GBD studies reported elsewhere, the relative 
ranking across causes and risk factors are dependent on 
the level of their aggregation. Online data visualisations 
provide access to results based on different levels of the 
GBD 2015 hierarchy of causes and risk factors, including 
a complete set of age-specific, gender-specific, cause-
specific, and prefecture-specific estimates of GBD 
outputs from 1990 until 2015.
Our study showed that health in Japan has been 
improving and life expectancy is rising because of the 
successful reduction in mortality and disability from 
most preventable diseases, such as cerebrovascular 
diseases, ischaemic heart diseases, lower respiratory 
infection, and some cancers that were previously severe 
and often fatal. However, the progress in population 
health has slowed down and variation in health is 
growing between prefectures for many leading causes. 
National and local health policies should therefore 
address region-specific health interventions to deal with 
these variations. The subnational health system inputs 
were not obviously associated with health outcomes, 
suggesting they are weakly associated with regional 
health variations. Therefore, the potential sources of the 
regional health variations, including subnational health 
system performance, need assessment.
