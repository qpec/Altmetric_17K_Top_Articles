Abstract Over the past decade, it has been convincingly
shown that regularly performing repeated brief supramax-
imal cycle sprints (sprint interval training [SIT]) is asso-
ciated with aerobic adaptations and health benefits similar
to or greater than with moderate-intensity continuous
training (MICT). SIT is often promoted as a time-efficient
exercise strategy, but the most commonly studied SIT
protocol (4–6 repeated 30-s Wingate sprints with 4 min
recovery, here referred to as ‘classic’ SIT) takes up to
approximately 30 min per session. Combined with high
associated perceived exertion, this makes classic SIT
unsuitable as an alternative/adjunct to current exercise
recommendations involving MICT. However, there are no
indications that the design of the classic SIT protocol has
been based on considerations regarding the lowest number
or shortest duration of sprints to optimise time efficiency
while retaining the associated health benefits. In recent
years, studies have shown that novel SIT protocols with
both fewer and shorter sprints are efficacious at improving
important risk factors of noncommunicable diseases in
sedentary individuals, and provide health benefits that are
no worse than those associated with classic SIT. These
shorter/easier protocols have the potential to remove many
of the common barriers to exercise in the general popula-
tion. Thus, based on the evidence summarised in this cur-
rent opinion paper, we propose that there is a need for a
fundamental change in focus in SIT research in order to
move away from further characterising the classic SIT
protocol and towards establishing acceptable and effective
protocols that
involve
minimal
sprint
durations
and
repetitions.
Key Points
Over the past decade, aerobic fitness adaptations and
health benefits following sprint interval training
(SIT) have received much attention. However, the
most commonly used SIT protocol, involving 4–6
repeated ‘all-out’ 30-s cycle sprints, is very
demanding and not as time efficient as often
suggested.
Recent studies demonstrate that both the number of
sprint repetitions and the sprint duration of SIT
protocols can be reduced (to a point) without
attenuating the associated health benefits.
Based on the evidence that we present in this article,
we contend that the focus of SIT research should be
moved towards establishing acceptable and effective
protocols that involve minimal sprint durations and
repetitions.
1 Background
Addressing the negative consequences associated with the
high prevalence of physical inactivity in the general pop-
ulation [1] is one of the main public health challenges of
current-day society. As lack of time has consistently been
identified as one of the main perceived barriers preventing

 sedentary individuals from becoming, and remaining,
physically active [2–4], this has led to the question of
whether a subgroup of sedentary individuals would be
more willing or able to reap the benefits of regular exercise
if alternative, more time-efficient options were available. A
one-size-fits-all approach to exercise recommendations
may not suit all individuals, and alternative/adjunct inter-
ventions need to be identified in order to overcome this
problem. Therefore, over the past decade there has been
increasing interest in the use of exercise interventions that
enable health benefits with shorter exercise times by
increasing exercise intensity [5, 6].
As high exercise intensities cannot be maintained for
extended periods of time, the logical approach has been to
develop interval protocols alternating repeated bouts of
(sub)maximal exercise (high-intensity interval training
[HIIT]) or supramaximal exercise (sprint interval training
[SIT]) with recovery intervals. The time spent performing
high-intensity intervals in common HIIT protocols (ap-
proximately 10–16 min) [7, 8] is larger than that in common
SIT protocols (approximately 2–3 min) [9]; therefore, in
theory, the latter have a greater potential to provide a time-
efficient alternative or addition to current recommendations
based on moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT).
The most commonly studied SIT protocol progresses from
four repeated 30-s Wingate sprints at the start of a 2- to 8-
week programme to six sprints towards the latter stages
(hereafter termed ‘classic’ SIT) (Fig. 1). In a recent meta-
analysis of the effects of SIT on maximal aerobic capacity
( _
VO2max), this specific protocol was used by more than half
of all included studies [10]. However, the classic 4–6 9 30-s
SIT protocol is extremely fatiguing and is not actually that
time efficient; including a warm-up and 4 min recovery
following sprints, the total time commitment is approxi-
mately 30 min per training session towards the end of the
training programme. The resulting total time commitment of
approximately 90 min per week is greater than the current
recommendations for vigorous-intensity continuous exer-
cise of 75 min per week [11]. Thus, considering the pro-
claimed aim of SIT to provide a time-efficient alternative/
adjunct to current exercise recommendations, it is surprising
that relatively little attention has been given to investigating
whether various SIT protocol parameters (e.g. number of
sprint repetitions, training frequency, sprint duration,
intensity) can be modulated to achieve beneficial car-
diometabolic adaptations with a lower time commitment and
reduced perceived exertion. As each of these protocol
parameters will impact on the likelihood of sedentary indi-
viduals adopting and adhering to an SIT intervention, this is
an important area of research. In this paper, we present an
overview of the growing body of recent research that sug-
gests the classic SIT protocol is unnecessarily long and
strenuous, and make a case for changing the focus of SIT
research towards protocols that are shorter, easier and
potentially even more effective.
2 What is the Evidence-Base for the Design
of the Classic Sprint Interval Training (SIT)
Protocol?

 including maximal glycolytic and mitochondrial enzyme
activity [12, 13], purine metabolism [14], pulmonary and
muscle gas exchange [15], muscle metabolism and ion
regulation [16], muscle buffering capacity [17], and ery-
throcyte characteristics [18]. Although never stated as a
main aim, several of these studies provided evidence that
regularly
performing
8–10
repeated
Wingate
sprints
improves _
VO2max [13, 15, 16, 18], which has consistently
been shown to be the strongest predictor of future mor-
bidity and mortality [19–22]. However, as performing 8–10
repeated Wingate sprints is associated with severe fatigue,
and, including recovery time, takes C35 min per training
session, these protocols were never proposed to be of
practical use for sedentary individuals. Interestingly how-
ever, Allemeier et al. [23] had by then already demon-
strated that _
VO2max can be improved by approximately
14% with as little as three repeated Wingate sprints per
training session, but this finding received little attention.
The classic SIT protocol incorporating up to six repeated
30-s Wingate sprints was first used in a study by Barnett
et al. [24], who reported an 8% increase in _
VO2max and a
42% increase in maximal citrate synthase activity follow-
ing 8 weeks of SIT. This protocol, with minor modifica-
tions,
was
subsequently
used
by Gibala’s
group
at
McMaster University in a series of seminal studies inves-
tigating the aerobic adaptations associated with classic SIT
[5, 25–27]. None of these studies provided a specific jus-
tification for the use of 4–6 repeated Wingate sprints, and
the authors did not comment on whether the protocol was
developed to optimise a specific training stimulus or to
maximise
a
hypothesised
mechanism
of
adaptation.
Nonetheless, the classic SIT protocol was shown to be
effective at inducing peripheral and whole-body aerobic
adaptations, and the majority of subsequent studies inves-
tigating aerobic adaptations and/or health benefits of SIT
have since used this protocol or minor modifications
thereof. To our knowledge, no publications have attempted
to justify why performing 4–6 9 30-s Wingate sprints
would be an optimal SIT protocol, i.e. many researchers
appear to have opted to persist with a protocol that works.
We cannot but conclude that the number and duration of
sprints used in the classic SIT protocol has been mostly
arbitrary.
3 How Effective is the Classic SIT Protocol?
There is a large body of evidence to support the efficacy of
the classic SIT protocol for improving a variety of
important health parameters, including _
VO2max [28–33],
insulin sensitivity [33–35], blood pressure [33, 36], car-
diovascular
function
[37]
and
body
composition
[33, 38, 39]. However, in order for any exercise interven-
tion to be recommended to the general public for improv-
ing or maintaining good health, the benefits of the
intervention will need to be at least as good as those
associated
with
current
exercise
recommendations.
Although several studies have directly compared SIT pro-
tocols with MICT, interestingly the MICT condition often
involves exercise intensities and durations that exceed
current exercise recommendations [26, 32, 40, 41]. Despite
this, SIT protocols tend to compare favourably with MICT;
meta-analyses have concluded that SIT is as good as or
better than MICT at improving, for example,
_
VO2max
[9, 42, 43] and insulin sensitivity [44] (although it should
be noted that some of these have included both HIIT and
SIT studies in the analysis [9, 44]). However, while
experimental data thus clearly support the efficacy of SIT
(i.e. producing beneficial results in laboratory studies), the
effectiveness of SIT (i.e. producing beneficial results under
‘real-world’ conditions) is often questioned [45–47]. In
recent years, it has been argued that the high exercise
intensities in SIT protocols may make SIT ‘‘unsafe,
unpractical or intolerable for general populations’’ [48].
Detractors of SIT propose that the strenuous nature of
supramaximal sprint exercise will result in negative affect
and, consequently, low uptake of and adherence to SIT
[46]. However, it is important to bear in mind that no
studies have produced data to support the suggestion that
medium- to longer-term adherence to SIT will be low.
Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to hypothesise that
members of the general public who currently fail to achieve
the MICT-based recommendations will not consider per-
forming approximately 30 min of classic SIT to be an
attractive alternative [49].
4 Do Proposed Mechanisms Support the Use
of the Classic SIT Protocol?
It is generally accepted that greater volumes/higher inten-
sities of MICT will lead to more pronounced car-
diometabolic adaptations [50–52], therefore it is tempting
to assume that performing more and/or longer supramaxi-
mal sprints will also enhance the cardiometabolic adapta-
tions associated with SIT. However, this cannot be a
foregone conclusion as, unlike with small volumes of
MICT, the disturbance of homeostasis following just a
single supramaximal cycle sprint is already rapid and
severe. An understanding of the specific stimuli and sub-
sequent signalling pathways responsible for the various
adaptations associated with SIT would be helpful in iden-
tifying protocols that are more time efficient and less
strenuous, but progress to date has been limited. The initial

123
 stimuli could either involve factors that would be expected
to lead to greater adaptations with more/longer sprints,
such as energy turnover or time spent at high intensity, or
factors that may be similar with fewer/shorter sprints, such
as peak power generation [53], maximal activation of
metabolic pathways, or maximal increases in specific
metabolites or signalling molecules. Furthermore, car-
diometabolic adaptations could be initiated by either cen-
tral factors (e.g. changes in heart rate, stroke volume, blood
flow, plasma volume) or peripheral factors (e.g. glycogen
depletion, increased intramyocellular [Ca2?] and [AMP],
ryanodine receptor fragmentation and sarcoplasmic retic-
ulum Ca2? leaking [54], etc.). Although _
VO2max is gen-
erally considered to be limited by central factors [55],
recent data have challenged this view [56], and several
authors have proposed that SIT may increase _
VO2max due
to increased mitochondrial density [31, 41, 43, 57, 58].
Similarly, changes in insulin sensitivity may be due to
adaptations within the muscle [59], but could also be due
to, for example, improved delivery of insulin and glucose
to skeletal muscle due to cardiovascular adaptations [60].
Potential mechanisms have been investigated in HIIT
studies [7, 58, 61, 62], but as there is a several-fold dif-
ference in exercise intensity between SIT and HIIT, it
remains unclear whether such information is relevant for
SIT
protocols.
Few
authors
have
provided
detailed
hypotheses about which stimuli may be responsible for
specific adaptations with SIT, but hypotheses on peripheral
mechanisms appear to be more prevalent [6, 54, 63, 64].
Gibala’s group proposed that, similar to MICT, car-
diometabolic adaptations to SIT are secondary to activation
of upstream kinases, including 50-adenosine monophos-
phate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38 mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK), which subsequently
activate the proposed ‘master regulator’ of mitochondrial
biogenesis and function, peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1a [63, 65]. There is
sufficient evidence to suggest that these pathways are
indeed
activated
with
repeated
supramaximal
sprints
[30, 65, 66], and that mitochondrial density rapidly
increases in response to SIT [5, 25, 30]. We have subse-
quently proposed that this may be due to rapid glycogen
depletion and associated release of glycogen-bound AMPK
[66, 67]. Glycogen depletion during repeated Wingate
sprints is attenuated by the third sprint [68], and the
increase in activation of various signalling kinases and
transcriptional regulatory proteins in response to a single
30-s Wingate sprint [69–72] is indeed similar compared
with multiple sprints [65, 73]. We therefore hypothesised
and demonstrated that protocols with fewer and shorter
sprints result in similar acute signalling responses [66] and
chronic adaptations [67, 74] compared with the classic SIT
protocol. However, our recent findings that performing
single 20-s Wingate sprints three times per week is not a
sufficient stimulus for improving _
VO2max [75, 76] does
not provide support for the hypothesis that AMPK-activa-
tion following glycogen depletion is responsible for caus-
ing increases in _
VO2max.
To date, the limited amount of available data neither
supports nor refutes that the classic 4–6 9 30-s SIT pro-
tocol will lead to more pronounced activation of potential
signalling pathways involved in any of the cardiometabolic
adaptations to SIT compared with shorter/easier protocols.
It is entirely plausible that the severe disruption of home-
ostasis associated with supramaximal exercise rapidly
‘saturates’ the signalling response and that regularly per-
forming just a few brief supramaximal sprints is sufficient
to gain the desired health benefits.
5 Evidence to Support the Efficacy of Fewer and/
or Shorter Sprints
A growing body of evidence supports that performing fewer
and/or shorter sprints does not impair the cardiometabolic
adaptations associated with SIT (Table 1). Hazell et al. [53]
directly compared the impact of reducing sprint duration in
the classic SIT protocol from 30 to 10 s, and reported similar
increases in _
VO2max with the 10-s protocol. This finding was
supported a few years later by Zelt et al. [41], who reported
no significant difference in _
VO2max response to the classic
SIT protocol with 30-s sprints (4%) and a modified protocol
with 15-s sprints (8%). These findings are important as the
duration of supramaximal sprints has a substantial impact on
perceived exertion; the strong contribution of phosphocre-
atine hydrolysis to energy demands during the first approx-
imately 10 s of a 30-s Wingate sprint means that fatigue
during this phase is relatively low, whereas the gradual
switch to glycolysis as the predominant energy source [68] is
associated with severe and progressive fatigue during the
latter stages of the sprint.
Similar to reducing sprint duration, reducing the number
of sprint repetitions will also decrease the perceived exertion
associated with SIT. As mentioned in Sect. 2, in the early
1990s Allemeier et al. [23] demonstrated robust improve-
ments in
_
VO2max following a protocol involving three
repeated 30-s Wingate sprints; however, this protocol
involved 20 min of passive recovery following each sprint,
negating its potential time efficiency. More recently, Ijichi
et al. [77] also used long recovery intervals (10 min) in
between three repeated 30-s Wingate sprints, and confirmed
the potential of a low number of sprint repetitions to improve
_
VO2max (?14% following 4 weeks of training).

Health Benefits of Shorter/Easier SIT Protocols
2447
123
 In our own laboratory, we have demonstrated that
6 weeks of 3-weekly 10-min SIT sessions involving just
two 20-s Wingate sprints (termed ‘reduced-exertion HIIT’,
or REHIT) (Fig. 1) is sufficient to improve _
VO2max by 10–
13% [67, 74]. The ability of the REHIT protocol to
improve oral glucose tolerance test-derived measures of
insulin
sensitivity
was
unclear,
with
a
significant
improvement in the Cederholm Index in men in one study
[67], but only a trend towards a 10% reduction in insulin
area under the curve (irrespective of sex) in the other study
[74]. Gibala’s group [57, 78] subsequently modified the
REHIT protocol to include a third 20-s sprint. In an initial
study, they confirmed the increase in _
VO2max (?12%) and
reported a 7% decrease in mean arterial pressure [78].
Glycaemic control, determined through 24-h continuous
glucose monitoring, significantly improved in men but not
women
[78].
In
a
follow-up
study,
Gibala’s
group
demonstrated that the increase in _
VO2max does not plateau
after 6 weeks (?12% after 6 weeks and ?19% after
12 weeks), and that the increase in insulin sensitivity in
response to REHIT (?53%) is not significantly different
compared with the increase with MICT (34%) [57].
The strongest evidence in favour of the efficacy of shorter/
easier SIT protocols comes from our recent meta-analysis in
which we examined the modifying effect of the number of
sprint repetitions in an SIT session on the increase in _
VO2max
[10]. A surprising finding of this study was that this effect may
be negative, i.e. increasing the number of sprint repetitions
may actually decrease the improvement in
_
VO2max.
Although the magnitude-based inference of this effect was
‘possibly small’, and therefore further research is required to
provide a definitive answer to the question as to whether
performing more sprints is worse, this question is irrelevant
for the practical implications of our finding; performing more
sprints was clearly not better for improving _
VO2max. The
logical question then is whether regularly performing just a
single supramaximal sprint will be sufficient to improve
_
VO2max; however, in two recent studies we have provided
initial data to suggest that this is not the case [75, 76]. It
appears that repeating sprints is required for training to be
effective. However, to date, all the available evidence sug-
gests that SIT protocols with fewer (two to three) and shorter
(10–20 s) sprints are as good as or better than the classic SIT
protocol at improving important health markers.
6 Implications of Evidence in Favour of Shorter
SIT Protocols
In recent years, the focus of research investigating time-
efficient alternatives to current exercise recommendations
has shifted away from the classic SIT protocol towards
HIIT protocols. Gibala’s HIIT protocol involving 10
repeated 1-min sprints at approximately 90% of maximal
heart rate interspersed with 1 min recovery [7, 79, 80],
and Wisløff’s protocol involving four repeated 4-min
sprints at 90% of maximal heart rate interspersed with
3 min recovery [8, 81, 82], are associated with promising
results in sedentary individuals and patient populations,
and, due to the lower exercise intensities, are proposed to
be safer and more likely to be adhered to. However,
similar to the classic SIT protocol, these HIIT protocols
are not actually very time efficient (25–40 min per
training session), and, although (sub)maximal sprints are
clearly less strenuous compared with Wingate sprints, the
increased sprint duration and number of repetitions result
in substantial progressive fatigue and negative affective
responses [80, 83, 84]. In contrast, the newly developed
REHIT protocol takes no more than 10 min per training
session
to
complete and
is
associated with accept-
able session ratings of perceived exertion [67, 74]. In our
experience, the sweat-response to this protocol is low,
which removes the need for changing into exercise
clothes or having a shower after exercise; our research
participants tend to do exercise in their regular clothes.
Furthermore, although the need for ‘specialist’ exercise
equipment has been raised as a barrier to implementing
SIT [85], a recent study has shown that a stair-running-
based REHIT protocol can be effective [86]. Further-
more, developing cheap exercise bikes for the use of SIT
protocols is not limited by technical difficulties but rather
by the issue of supply and demand. Moreover, unlike
HIIT, SIT does not require pre-intervention tests to
establish appropriate exercise intensities, nor does it
require equipment to monitor the prescribed intensity.
The shorter exercise session duration (10 min) could
facilitate cost-effective use of SIT-enabled stationary
bikes in gyms, schools or at the workplace. Thus,
shorter, easier SIT protocols have the capacity to remove
many of the common barriers that prevent people from
adopting and adhering to regular structured exercise
[2–4]. We propose that such protocols are particularly
well-suited as a primary prevention exercise routine for
sedentary individuals. Although the safety of SIT proto-
cols has often been questioned (without data to support
this argument), we recently observed no adverse events
during an 8-week REHIT intervention in 16 middle-aged
overweight/obese,
prehypertensive,
type
2
diabetes
patients [87]. Although this does not ‘prove’ the safety of
SIT (safety is a difficult concept to demonstrate experi-
mentally), it does provide some tentative indirect support
for SIT to be a safe intervention in sedentary but disease-
free individuals. However, more research should address
the
safety
of
supramaximal
exercise
in
various
populations.

 7 Conclusions
In a recently published debate on the pros and cons of HIIT
as a public health strategy [45], the proponent of HIIT
conceded that ‘‘no one is proposing Wingate-based SIT as
a strategy to impact public health’’; however, based on the
information presented in this paper, we do precisely this. A
growing body of evidence demonstrates the efficacy of SIT
protocols with fewer (as little as two repetitions) and
shorter (10–20 s) sprints, thus removing many of the pro-
posed barriers to SIT as a feasible intervention for reducing
the risk of noncommunicable diseases in the general pop-
ulation. Limiting sprint repetitions and duration makes SIT
shorter and easier without attenuating the associated health
benefits. This firmly establishes these novel protocols as
viable alternatives to current MICT-based recommenda-
tions. We contend that research into the health benefits of
SIT requires a change of focus—away from further char-
acterising the classic SIT protocol incorporating 4–6 9 30-
s Wingate sprints and towards establishing acceptable and
effective protocols that involve minimal sprint durations
and repetitions.
