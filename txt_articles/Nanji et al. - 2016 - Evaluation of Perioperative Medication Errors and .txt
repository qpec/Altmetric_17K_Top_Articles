Abstract
Background—The purpose of this study is to assess the rates of perioperative medication errors 
(MEs) and adverse drug events (ADEs) as percentages of medication administrations, evaluate 
their root causes, and formulate targeted solutions to prevent them.
Methods—In this prospective observational study, anesthesia-trained study staff 
(anesthesiologists/nurse anesthetists) observed randomly selected operations at a 1,046 bed tertiary 
care academic medical center to identify MEs and ADEs over eight months. Retrospective chart 
abstraction was performed to flag events that were missed by observation. All events subsequently 
underwent review by two independent reviewers. Primary outcomes were the incidence of MEs 
and ADEs.
Results—A total of 277 operations were observed with 3,671 medication administrations of 
which 193 (5.3%, 95% CI 4.5 to 6.0) involved a ME and/or ADE. Of these, 153 (79.3%) were 
preventable and 40 (20.7%) were non-preventable. The events included 153 (79.3%) errors and 91 
(47.2%) ADEs. While 32 (20.9%) of the errors had little potential for harm, 51 (33.3%) led to an 
observed ADE and an additional 70 (45.8%) had the potential for patient harm. Of the 153 errors, 
99 (64.7%) were serious, 51 (33.3%) were significant and 3 (2.0%) were life-threatening.
Conclusions—One in twenty perioperative medication administrations included an ME and/or 
ADE. More than one third of the MEs led to observed ADEs, and the remaining two thirds had the

 potential for harm. These rates are markedly higher than those reported by retrospective surveys. 
Specific solutions exist which have the potential to decrease the incidence of perioperative MEs.
Introduction
Medication administration in the perioperative setting presents particular patient safety 
challenges compared to other hospital settings.1 Unlike in the inpatient hospital ward setting, 
perioperative medication administration today often bypasses standard safety checks, such 
as electronic physician order entry with decision support, pharmacy approval of specific 
drugs prior to administration, and multiple nursing checks at the time of medication 
administration. Furthermore, the high-stress, time-sensitive nature of operating room care 
may lead to both higher rates of medication errors (MEs) and errors of high severity.
Perioperative syringe swaps, ampoule swaps, and wrong dose errors can all cause serious 
harm.2 In fact, the most frequently cited critical incidents in anesthesia are drug 
administration errors.3 However, the literature on perioperative ME rates is sparse and 
contains largely self-reported data,4-7 consisting of either spontaneous self-reports of 
errors5, 7 or facilitated incident reporting of whether or not an error occurred.1, 6 The validity 
and reliability of studies based on self-reporting of MEs in other patient care areas has been 
called into question.8-10 For example, in a study of 2,557 doses of medications administered 
on hospital wards, Flynn and colleagues found 456 medication errors by direct observation, 
34 by chart review and only one by self-report.8 Without valid and reliable assessments of 
perioperative errors and their root causes, proposed solutions may be less effective, more 
costly and subject to considerable resistance to implementation, and their impact cannot be 
accurately measured.
Reductions in MEs in other patient care areas, including inpatient units and outpatient 
clinics, have occurred because error rates were measured, errors were categorized in order to 
determine their root causes and potential for harm, solutions were designed and 
implemented, and error rates were then systematically re-measured to show a reduction. In 
addition, typically the costs of the solutions were assessed to justify their widespread 
adoption. This process has occurred with solutions such as computerized physician order 
entry systems,11, 12 bar code scanning systems for medication administration in hospital 
pharmacies,13 and outpatient electronic prescribing systems.14, 15 Perioperative areas are 
among the only remaining patient care areas that have not had rigorous assessments of MEs 
to guide proposed solutions. Thus, it is not surprising that there have been few specific 
improvements to perioperative medication errors since they were originally flagged as a 
problem in 1978.16
The aim of this epidemiologic study was to assess the rates, types, severity and 
preventability of MEs and potential adverse drug events (ADEs) in the perioperative setting, 
from initiation of anesthesia care to handover of patient care in the recovery room or 
intensive care unit.

 Materials and Methods
Data for the study were collected during a seven month period from November 2013 to June 
2014. We obtained approval from the Partners Human Research Office (Boston MA, 
protocol #2012P000833).
Study Site
This study was conducted in the perioperative area at a 1,046 bed tertiary care academic 
medical center that performs over 40,000 operations annually in 64 operating rooms 
excluding off-site anesthetizing locations. The anesthesia providers use an electronic 
anesthesia information management system (MetaVision, iMDSoft, MA) to document 
patient demographic information, vital signs, medications administered and perioperative 
events. The hospital also recently introduced a bar code-assisted syringe labeling system 
(Safe Label System, Codonics, OH). Providers scan the manufacturer-issued bar code on 
each medication vial, and the system prints a color syringe label containing, at a minimum: 
drug name, strength, quantity, diluent and diluent volume, expiration date and time, and the 
provider's initials. The system also provides audio and visual readback of drug name and 
concentration, and clinical alerts for recalled and expired vials.
Definitions
The perioperative medication administration process starts when a medication is requested 
or obtained from the anesthesia cart and ends with appropriate monitoring after the 
medication has reached the patient. The stages in this process are shown in Table 1, and any 
of these stages may involve one or more errors. A medication error is defined as failure to 
complete a required action in the medication administration process, or the use of an 
incorrect plan or action to achieve a patient care aim.17 An adverse drug event is defined as 
patient harm or injury due to a medical intervention related to a drug, regardless of whether 
an error in the medication process occurs.11
In order to adapt these definitions for the perioperative setting, we built on a previously 
described framework used to identify and classify MEs in inpatient and outpatient 
settings.14;17 Using this ME detection framework, we assessed various ME scenarios with 
consultation from clinical and ME experts to make the necessary iterative revisions to ensure 
that all elements of the framework were mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive in 
the perioperative setting. We then created an observer training manual based on the error 
definitions outlined in the framework. A full list of definitions with examples is shown in 
Table 2 and their associated severity levels are defined in Table 3.
Study Participants
All 237 anesthesia care providers (excluding study staff) were eligible to participate. The 
providers included 81 (34.2%) anesthesiologists, 53 (22.4%) certified registered nurse 
anesthetists (CRNAs), and 103 (43.5%) house staff. We held an informational session in 
conjunction with department-wide grand rounds to describe the study purpose and provide 
an opportunity for anesthesia providers ask questions. We subsequently sent a consent email

 to all anesthesia providers, providing them with the option to opt-out of participation at any 
time during the study period.
Observers
Four fully-trained, practicing clinician observers (three anesthesiologists and one nurse 
anesthetist) independently observed medication administration by anesthesia providers 
during routine patient care without intervention, in order to detect MEs and/or ADEs per our 
error detection framework. Observer training prior to participation included: Thorough 
review of the observer training manual, which includes ME and ADE definitions and 
examples; at least one three-hour formal training session led by a ME expert to review error 
terminology and classification, including scenario-based case discussions; and collecting 
data simultaneously with an experienced, trained observer for a minimum of ten cases, with 
an emphasis on techniques used to minimize the effect of the observer on the observed 
(Hawthorne effect)10 such as minimizing interaction with participants, remaining outside of 
the participants’ immediate workspace.
Data Collection
We randomly selected operating rooms for data collection, excluding pediatric, cardiac 
surgery and off-site locations due to unique medication administration considerations in 
these areas. A two-pronged approach was used to capture suspected medication errors and/or 
adverse drug events: direct observation and chart review.
The primary method of data collection was continuous direct observation, originally 
described by Barker and colleagues, who demonstrated that with properly trained observers, 
there is negligible if any Hawthorne effect.10, 18 Observations began when the anesthesia 
provider assumed care for the patient, and ended when the patient arrived in the recovery 
room or intensive care unit. Using paper data collection forms, observers documented in real 
time all medications administered as well as any MEs and/or ADEs observed. They recorded 
the event type (ME and/or ADE), error type, time of event, provider type, and other 
comments (free text) associated with the event. If an ADE occurred in conjunction with a 
ME, the observer completed the Naranjo Algorithm19 to determine the likelihood that the 
ADE was related to the ME. All field observations were entered into our study database by a 
clinical research coordinator.
The second data collection method was guided chart abstraction from our anesthesia 
information management system by trained anesthesiologists. For all directly observed 
patient care encounters, we also queried our anesthesia information management system 
database for cases of drug dosages and/or vital signs during the observational period that 
were outside of our defined acceptable range, some of which are outlined in Table 2. These 
cases were put forward for further review to determine whether a ME or ADE was present. 
Duplicate events (detected by both chart review and observation) were deleted.
Event Classification
The study team, including observers, met weekly to review and discuss events, further 
assess and reclassify them as needed. All events identified during this data collection phase

 subsequently underwent review by two independent members of the adjudication committee, 
which was comprised of board-certified anesthesiologists and/or ME experts. Events not 
deemed to be MEs and/or ADEs were excluded. For example, moderate hypotension (with 
mean arterial pressure > 55 mmHg) in a patient without cardiac risks factors after receiving 
a standard dose of propofol (<3.5 milligrams per kilogram) was excluded. Mean arterial 
pressure less than 55 mmHg was classified as an adverse event.20 The committee judged 
ADE and potential ADE severity on a four-point Likert scale (significant, serious, life-
threatening and fatal), and preventability on a four-point Likert scale (definitely preventable, 
probably preventable, probably not preventable and definitely not preventability), with the 
scale collapsed to two categories (probably preventable or probably not preventable) prior to 
analysis. The committee also assigned each ME type to a prevention strategy which, in their 
judgment, has potential to reduce the likelihood of the ME and/or associated ADE. Rater 
disagreements were resolved by consensus through discussion between the two raters.
Statistical Analysis
We present the results as the number and rate of MEs and ADEs per 100 medication 
administrations as well as the percentage of medication administrations with at least one 
error. Based on medication error rates in other patient care areas, we expected 10% of 
medication administrations to involve at least one error.1, 15, 16, 21 Sample size estimation 
was performed using the binomial distribution to ensure that the width of the 95% 
confidence interval for the number of medication administrations involving at least one error 
was approximately +/−1.5%. With approximately 1,380 medication administrations and an 
expected rate of 10%, the 95% confidence interval for the number of medication 
administrations having at least one error was approximately 3%. Due to the large number of 
expected cases with zero errors, the association between error rate and demographic/clinical 
characteristics was assessed using the Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression, and we considered 
that a single medication administration could involve multiple errors. The inter-rater 
reliability between adjudication committee members for incident classification, severity, and 
preventability was assessed using Cohen's kappa statistic. All analyses were performed 
using SAS(R) version 9.3 (Cary, NC) and statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.
Our primary outcomes were the incidence of MEs and ADEs in the perioperative setting. 
Secondary outcomes were MEs and ADEs by patient characteristics, specifically age, sex, 
race, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score,22 body mass index 
(BMI), procedure type, procedure duration and number of medication administrations.
Results
Data were collected during an eight month period from November 2013 to June 2014. Of 
237 eligible anesthesia care providers, 11 opted out: Seven attending anesthesiologists, two 
CRNAs, and two house staff. Thus, our eligible study population consisted of 74 (32.7%) 
attending anesthesiologists, 51 (22.6%) CRNAs and 101 (44.7%) house staff. Over 105 
observation days, four anesthesia-trained observers observed 277 operations on 275 patients, 
with a total of 3,671 medication administrations (Table 4) by 24 (8.7%) attending 
anesthesiologists, 160 (57.8%) CRNAs and 93 (33.6%) house staff. Of the 277 operations

 observed, 124 (44.8%) included one or more ME and/or ADE. A total of 227 (82.0%) 
operations required general anesthesia and 37 (13.4%) involved sedation only. There was no 
significant difference between event rates for general anesthesia (227 operations, 3,297 
medication administrations, 5.3% event rate) versus sedation (50 operations, 374 medication 
administrations, 4.6% event rate, p=0.52).
A total of 211 medication errors and/or ADEs were detected, of which 172 (81.5%) were 
directly observed and 39 (18.5%) were discovered through targeted review of the anesthesia 
records from operations that we observed. Of the 211 errors, 14 (6.6%) were excluded by 
the adjudication committee and 4 (1.9%) were determined to have no potential for harm, 
leaving a final sample of 193 events (5.3%, 95% CI: 4.5 to 6.0) associated with 187 unique 
medication administrations (5.1%, 95% CI: 4.4 to 5.8). Inter-rater reliability between 
adjudication committee members for event classification was good (Kappa=0.97, 4 cases 
resolved by consensus).
Errors and Adverse Events
The 193 events detected included 153 (79.3%) MEs and 91 (47.2%) ADEs. A single event 
can involve both an error and an ADE (Figure 1). Of these events, 40 (20.7%) were ADEs 
that did not involve a ME, 51 (26.4%) were MEs that led to an observed ADE, 70 (36.3%) 
were MEs with the potential for an ADE, and 32 (16.6%) were MEs with little potential for 
harm (Figure 1). Of the 70 MEs with the potential for an ADE, four (5.7%) were 
intercepted. A total of 153 (79.3%) events were deemed preventable and 40 (20.7%) were 
deemed non-preventable. Inter-rater reliability for preventability classification was good 
(Kappa=0.98, 1 case resolved by consensus). Of the 193 events, 104 (53.9%) occurred 
within 20 minutes of the induction period. None of the observed or potential ADEs were 
fatal, three (1.6%) were life threatening, 133 (68.9%) were serious and 57 (29.5%) were 
significant. Inter-rater reliability for severity classification was good (Kappa=0.85, 12 cases 
resolved by consensus). Of the 51 medication errors that led to an ADE, the most prevalent 
error types were inappropriate medication doses (N=24; 47.1%) and omitted medications/
failure to act (N=16; 31.4%). Using the Naranjo algorithm, 28 (54.9%) of the observed 
ADEs with error were probably due to the error, 22 (43.1%) were possibly due to the error, 
and 1(2.0%) was doubtfully due to the error.
Of the 153 medication errors recorded, 51 (33.3%) led to an observed ADE and an 
additional 102 (66.7%) errors were associated with a potential ADE. The most common 
overall error type was labeling error (N=37; 24.2%), followed by wrong dose error (N=35; 
22.9%) and omitted medication/failure to act (N=27; 17.6%). Of the 153 errors recorded 
(Table 5), 117 (76.5%) were associated with a specific medication administration and 36 
(23.5%) were associated with other factors such as a delay or failure to treat an adverse 
event, or an error in monitoring. Medications most frequently associated with errors were 
propofol 30 (25.6%), phenylephrhine 12 (10.3%) and fentanyl 11 (9.4%). No significant 
difference existed between the event rates of house staff (N=68 events, 5.1% event rate), 
nurse anesthetists (N=111 events, 5.5% event rate) and attending anesthesiologists (N=14 
events, 4.5% event rate, p=0.79).

 Patient characteristics as well as event rates by patient characteristic are shown in Table 4. 
No association exists between ME and/or ADE rates and patient age, sex, American Society 
of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score,22 body mass index (BMI) or procedure 
type. Longer procedures, especially those greater than six hours, had higher total event rates 
(p < 0.0001), ME rates (p < 0.0001) and ADE rates (p=0.004) than shorter procedures. Also, 
procedures with 13 or more medication administrations had higher event rates (p=0.02) and 
ADE rates (p=0.002) than those with 12 or fewer medication administrations. Finally, event 
rates (p=0.01), ME rates (p=0.03) and ADE rates (p=0.02) varied by patient race.
Contributing Factors and Solutions
We identified several strategies which, in our judgment, can be mapped to particular ME 
types in order to reduce the likelihood of ME and/or ADE. These strategies include both 
technology-based interventions and process-based interventions. Examples of technology-
based interventions include: point-of-care bar code-assisted anesthesia documentation 
systems, which have the potential to eliminate 17.0% of MEs and 25.5% of potential ADEs; 
specific drug decision support, 28.8% of MEs, 13.7% of potential ADEs and 58.8% of 
ADEs; and alerts, 52.9% of MEs, 32.4% of potential ADEs and 94.1% of ADEs. An 
individual error can be prevented by multiple solutions.
Process-based interventions included changing the timing of documentation, which had the 
potential to eliminate 35.3% of MEs, 21.6% of potential ADEs and 62.8% of ADEs; 
reducing opportunities for workarounds, 24.2% of MEs and 36.3% of potential ADEs; 
connecting infusions to the most proximal IV port, 1.3% of MEs and 2.0% of potential 
ADEs; and rigorous vendor selection with strong training, which could work synergistically 
with the other interventions to reduce MEs and ADEs.
Discussion
We found that approximately one in twenty perioperative medication administrations and 
every second operation resulted in a ME and/or ADE. More than one third of these errors led 
to observed patient harm, and the remaining two thirds had the potential for patient harm. 
More than two-thirds of the harm or potential harm was classified as serious. Thus, there is 
substantial potential for medication-related harm, and a number of opportunities to improve 
safety in the peri-operative setting. Longer procedures, especially those greater than six 
hours in duration, had higher event, ME and ADE rates than those less than one hour. Also, 
procedures with 13 or more medication administrations had higher event and ADE rates than 
those with 12 or fewer medication administrations. Further research is required to assess 
whether this is related to fatigue and lapses in vigilance over longer time periods and more 
medication administrations.
The pre-existing literature on perioperative ME rates is sparse and often uses self-reports as 
a primary data source.4-7 In one study of anesthesiologists, the reported drug administration 
error rate was one per 133 anesthetics.4 In another survey study, 85% of anesthesiologists 
reported at least one drug error or near miss during their careers.5 These error rates are 
markedly lower than the rates that we found, which may be due to provider reluctance to 
self-report errors, or failure of providers to recognize errors they have made.

 Self-reporting results in missing the vast majority of medication errors in most settings, and 
should not be expected to reliably assess ME rates.23 High-fidelity simulation has also been 
used to assess medication errors, with a reported error rate of approximately 10%.24 While 
measures were taken to make errors more likely in this setting, artificially raising the error 
rate, the simulation setting itself may also inherently lead to different error rates than found 
in an actual clinical practice setting. Merry and colleagues present the only previous 
investigation of perioperative errors that used direct observation as a method for data 
collection.1 In five operating rooms in a tertiary academic center in New Zealand, they 
found a perioperative medication error rate of 11.6% in a study group that used conventional 
non-electronic methods for anesthetic record keeping. However, they did not assess the 
errors’ potential for harm as this was a before and after study designed only to assess the 
impact of a specific anesthesia information management system on ME rates. Notably, this 
is also the only study to measure perioperative medication errors as a percentage of 
medications administered, which has been the standard denominator used to measure 
medication errors in other areas.14-16, 21 Previous studies in the perioperative setting had 
used the number of anesthetics administered as the denominator,4, 5, 7 which lacks the 
benefit of explicitly negative administrations.
In our Contributing Factors and Solutions Section, we identified several strategies to 
minimize perioperative MEs and/or ADEs, including technology-based interventions and 
process-based interventions. Examples of technology-based interventions include bar code-
assisted syringe labeling systems, point-of-care bar code-assisted anesthesia documentation 
systems, specific drug decision support, and alerts.
Bar code-assisted syringe labeling systems have the potential to eliminate labeling errors. 
Despite the recently introduced bar code-assisted syringe labeling system at the study site, 
37(24.2%) events involved a labeling error. These occurred when the provider did not use 
the labeling system either because it was not installed in that particular location or there was 
a workaround available to circumvent its use. This is addressed with the process-based 
interventions.
Point-of-care bar code-assisted anesthesia documentation systems allow the syringe label to 
be scanned immediately prior to drug administration, and automatically populate the 
anesthesia record with the medication and/or dose administered. These have the potential to 
reduce the incidence of documentation errors.
Specific drug decision support, including features such as dose calculators and maximum 
dose checking, has the capacity to reduce the incidence of wrong dose and wrong drug 
errors.
Alerts that are thoughtfully implemented into an electronic anesthesia information 
management system in a tiered manner to minimize cognitive overload can decrease the 
incidence of omitted medication/failure to act errors, and monitoring errors. For example, 
reminders to redose antibiotics or record a blood pressure after ten minutes without a 
reading have the potential to eliminate many of these errors.

 Process-based interventions include determining optimal timing for documentation, reducing 
opportunities for workarounds, connecting infusions to the most proximal IV port, rigorous 
vendor selection and strong training.
Timing of documentation is critical in taking full advantage of decision support. In our 
study, most practitioners documented medications after they were administered. If syringe 
labels were scanned via a point-of-care bar code-assisted documentation system 
immediately prior to administration, the system could provide decision support such as dose 
calculators, maximum dose checks, allergy warnings and other alerts, eliminating many of 
the wrong dose errors. Even without comprehensive decision support, Merry and colleagues 
have shown that a system allowing syringe labels to be scanned immediately prior to 
administration with visual and auditory medication verification reduced perioperative MEs 
by 21%.1
Reducing the opportunity for workarounds is a key step in ensuring proper use of 
systems to reduce errors. For example, when a bar code-assisted syringe labeling system is 
installed and providers are fully trained on its use, manual sticker labels may be removed 
from the immediate workspace so that the easiest option is for providers to use the bar code-
assisted, fully compliant labels. In the event of a bar code scanning system failure, 
appropriate manual backup labels should be readily available in a nearby location, such as 
the anesthesia workroom. We found that in most instances where the labeling system was 
not used, manual sticker labels were available and the provider used those instead.
Connecting infusions to the most proximal IV port, and ideally through a dedicated carrier 
line, may minimize the potential for inadvertent boluses of intravenous infusion. Boluses 
given through an infusion carrier line have the potential to inadvertently deliver a significant 
amount of infusion drug along with the intended bolus. While we observed cases where this 
led to significant hemodynamic changes, these are lessened when the infusion is connected 
to the most proximal IV port as the volume of infusion drug in the carrier IV line is 
minimized.
Rigorous vendor selection, with strong training, should eliminate vendors that are 
unwilling to commit to iteratively revise and improve a technology based on user feedback. 
Long-term, on-site training that covers all shifts is also important to minimize workflow 
disruptions.
This study has several limitations. First, due to the Hawthorne effect, the observed 
anesthesia providers may have altered their behavior during the observations. Barker and 
colleagues have shown that with proper observer training, the Hawthorne effect is 
negligible.10 If there were some residual Hawthorne effect present during our study, it 
would have artificially decreased our event rate, suggesting that the actual event rate is 
likely higher than we have reported. Second, our primary method of data collection was 
direct observation, which may not capture all events that occurred. We did undertake a 
corresponding chart abstraction to capture additional events that may have been missed by 
observation. However, our results may still underrepresent the actual number of events. 
Third, our study setting was a large tertiary care academic institution, where anesthesia is

 administered by residents, fellows, CRNAs and attending anesthesiologists, and our findings 
may not be generalizable to nonteaching hospitals. Fourth, our sample may not have been 
large enough to detect small differences in event rates by patient characteristic such as ASA 
score, BMI and procedure type. While we did find that event rates varied by patient race, 
this result may not be robust or representative of large populations as the proportion of 
minority patients in our sample was very small. Detecting differences in event rates by 
patient characteristic was not a primary aim of our study, and future research can be 
designed to assess whether patient characteristics affect rates of MEs and ADEs. Fifth, while 
we assumed that each medication administration was an independent event, this assumption 
was not directly assessed. We indirectly assessed the independence of each medication 
administration by examining the association between event rates and procedure type (length 
and complexity), provider type and number of medication administrations in the procedure, 
and found no indication of strong dependence between medication administrations. Finally, 
our center has an electronic anesthesia information management system and a bar code-
assisted syringe labeling system, both of which may reduce the frequency of medication 
errors and/or ADEs.25 Thus, our findings may not be generalizable to centers without these 
tools.
In summary, we found that approximately one in twenty perioperative medication 
administrations, and every second operation, resulted in a ME and/or ADE. More than one 
third of these errors led to observed patient harm, and the remaining two thirds had the 
potential for patient harm. These rates are markedly higher than those reported by existing 
retrospective surveys. Future analyses should target the creation and implementation of 
process- and technology-based solutions that may address the root causes of the errors in 
order to reduce their incidence.

The 193 events detected included 153 (79.3%) medication errors (MEs) and 91 (47.2%) 
adverse drug events (ADEs). A single event can involve both an error and an ADE. Of these 
events, 40 (20.7%) were ADEs that did not involve a ME, 51 (26.4%) were MEs that led to 
an observed ADE, 70 (36.3%) were MEs with the potential for an ADE (four intercepted 
and 66 non-intercepted), and 32 (16.6%) were MEs with little potential for harm.

Stages of Medication Administration
Term
Definition
Requesting
Prescriber requests medication from pharmacy or from medication dispensing system; this step may be bypassed when 
provider obtains a medication directly from anesthesia cart
Dispensing
Pharmacist dispenses a medication directly to the provider, or provider withdraws medication from dispensing system
Preparing
Medication is prepared by provider (e.g., drawn from vial, placed into a labeled syringe, diluted, etc.)
Administration
Medication reaches the patient either by self-administration or administration via an anesthesia provider.
Documenting
The medication and dose are documented in the anesthesia information management system
Monitoring
Following vital signs or relevant labs after medication administration (e.g., checking glucose after insulin administration)

Examples
Medication Error (ME)
Failure to complete a required action, or the 
use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim; may 
involve any of the stages of medication 
administration (Table 1) regardless of 
whether an injury occurred or the potential 
for injury was present.
• Patient given a dose of medication which was not intended.
• Significant hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 55mmHg) 
that is not treated.
Error with no Potential for 
Harm
Violates strict standards but has essentially 
no potential for patient harm.
• Not including provider initials on a syringe label.
Error with Little Potential for 
Harm
A medication error that has little possibility 
of causing injury.
• Propofol infusion increased from 50 to 150 micrograms/
kilogram/minute but not documented.
Error with Potential for an 
Adverse Drug Event (ADE)
A medication error that has the possibility 
of causing injury.
• A patient with history of upper gastrointestinal bleed given a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with no resultant 
bleeding.
Error with an ADE
An injury due to a medical intervention 
related to a drug that resulted from an error 
in the medication process.
• A patient with positive cocaine toxicology screen receives 
beta blockers and has severe hypertension.
• Administering penicillin to a patient with a penicillin allergy 
who subsequently develops a rash.
• A patient who develops mean arterial pressure < 55 mmHg 
after 4mg/kg propofol bolus.
ADE without Error
An injury due to a medical intervention 
related to a drug with no error in the 
medication process.
• An allergic reaction in a patient not previously known to be 
allergic to that particular medication.
• A patient with a history of postoperative nausea and vomiting 
(PONV) who is given a combination of antiemetics 
perioperatively and subsequently develops PONV.
• A patient who develops mean arterial pressure < 55 mmHg 
after a standard dose of propofol.
Ameliorable ADE
An ADE whose severity could have been 
substantially reduced if different actions 
had been taken.
• A patient with continuing PONV who did not receive 
antiemetics within 30 minutes
• A patient with >4/10 pain on emergence that is not treated 
until after arriving in the recovery room

Severity of Medication Error or Adverse Drug Event
Term
Definition
Examples
Life-threatening
The event has the potential to cause symptoms that if not treated, 
would put the patient at risk of death.
• More than three consecutive premature ventricular 
contractions.
• Patient with a prior anaphylactic reaction to penicillin 
who is given penicillin or cefazolin.
Serious
The event has the potential to cause symptoms that are 
associated with a serious level of harm that is not high enough to 
be life-threatening.
• Failing to administer antibiotics before incision in a 
person requiring antibiotics.
• Patient given insulin without subsequently checking 
blood glucose levels.
Significant
The event has the potential to cause symptoms that while 
harmful to the patient pose little or no threat to the patient's 
function.
• Blood glucose levels not checked in a patient with 
diabetes.
