Objective: This study examined the role of static indicators
and proximal, clinically relevant indicators in the prediction
of short-term community violence in a large, heterogeneous
sample of adults with mental illnesses.
Methods: Data were pooled from five studies of adults with
mental illnesses (N=4,484). Follow-up data were available for
2,579 participants. A hierarchical linear regression assessed
the incremental validity of a series of variable clusters in the
prediction of violence risk at six months: static characteristics
(age, sex, race-ethnicity, and primary diagnosis), substance
use (alcohol use and drug use at baseline), clinical functioning
(psychiatric symptoms at baseline and recent hospitalization),
recent violence, and recent victimization.
Results: Results demonstrated improved prediction with
each step of the model, indicating that proximal indicators
contributed to the prediction of short-term community vi-
olence above and beyond static characteristics. When all
variables were entered, current alcohol use, recent violence,
and recent victimization were positive predictors of subse-
quent violence, even after the analysis controlled for par-
ticipant characteristics.
Conclusions: This study provides empirical evidence for
three proximal, clinically relevant indicators in the assess-
ment and management of short-term violence risk among
adults with mental illnesses: current alcohol use, recent vi-
olence, and recent victimization. Consideration of these
indicators in clinical practice may assist in the identification
of adults with mental illnesses who are at heightened risk of
short-term community violence.

In light of recent tragedies, including the Newtown,
Connecticut, and Aurora, Colorado, shootings, increased
attention has been focused on the elevated risk of violence
perpetration among adults with mental illnesses, com-
pared with the general population (1–4), and with the role
of mental health professionals in preventing such violence
(5,6). Although clinicians are tasked with the identifica-
tion of risk factors associated with community violence,
research efforts have focused primarily on static factors
(for example, age, sex, and race-ethnicity) with relatively
limited clinical utility (7). When clinically relevant factors
are considered, they often are distal in nature (for example,
childhood victimization experiences and a history of sub-
stance use) and may not be representative of current func-
tioning and, therefore, of the current risk of violence.
However, some evidence suggests that proximal factors—
that is, factors that are currently present or that occurred in
the recent past—may play an important role in the assess-
ment of violence risk, particularly vis-à-vis the prediction of
short-term violence (8,9). Four proximal indicators stand
out as potentially relevant to the clinical prediction and
prevention of short-term community violence among adults
with mental illnesses: current substance use, current psychi-
atric symptoms, recent violence, and recent victimization.
Alcohol and drug use are widely recognized as robust
correlates of violence perpetration among adults with
mental illnesses (4,10,11). However, research-based and
clinical assessments of violence risk often rely on a diagnosis
of a substance use disorder or self-reported history of sub-
stance use problems, rather than on current levels of use
(12,13). In addition, alcohol and drug use are often consid-
ered together under the umbrella of substance use, although
past research differs as to which evinces a stronger rela-
tionship with violence (14,15). Thus information on prior
substance use problems, although predictive of long-term
violence, provides little in the way of information regarding
current functioning, risk of violence in the short-term, and
treatment needs.
As with substance use, having a psychiatric diagnosis,
compared with having no diagnosis, is associated with an
increased risk of violence (4). However, evidence regarding
the role of psychiatric symptoms in relation to violence is
mixed. Prior reviews have not reached a consensus regard-
ing the strength or even direction of the association between

 psychiatric symptoms and violence (16–18). These equivocal
findings may reflect, in part, heterogeneity in operational
definitions; studies vary in their use of total scores, indi-
vidual symptoms, and latent factors (10,19). Furthermore,
most research on the association between psychiatric
symptoms and violence has focused on long-term violence
(that is, more than 12 months after assessment) (11,16). Few
studies have examined the associations between current
psychiatric symptomatology and violence over the coming
months. As a result, psychiatric symptoms are often sup-
planted in assessments of violence risk by distal measures of
psychiatric diagnoses or insensitive proximal measures
of exacerbated symptomatology (for example, recent
hospitalization).
In addition to being perpetrators of violence, adults with
mental illnesses are also victims of violence—and at rates
higher than those in the general population (1,20,21). Both
a history of violence and a history of victimization have
been identified as robust correlates of long-term violence
(11,22,23), although the latter is attended to less frequently
in violence risk assessment. When a history of victimization
is considered, the focus is typically on distal experiences (for
example, a history of childhood abuse) (24). Although
childhood and adult forms of victimization are related
among adults with mental illnesses (25), the experiences
are qualitatively distinct and thus may evince different as-
sociations with short-term violence. Indeed, a recent study
of 167 justice-involved adults with mental illnesses showed
that recent violence and victimization predicted violence
over a 12-month period, above and beyond static and distal
factors, including childhood physical abuse (24). However,
generalizability of findings from this study is limited by the
small sample and the authors’ decision to collapse six- and
12-month assessments of violence.
This study sought to better understand the role of proximal
indicators in the prediction of short-term violence through
analysis of integrated data. Specifically, we examined current
alcohol and drug use, current psychiatric symptomatology,
recent hospitalization, recent violence, and recent victimiza-
tion as predictors of community violence over a six-month
period in a large, heterogeneous sample of adults with mental
illnesses.
METHODS
Data
Data were pooled from five studies of adults with mental
illnesses (N=4,484). The most recent was a study of facili-
tated psychiatric advance directives (F-PAD study; N=473)
(10) that investigated a psychiatric advance directive inter-
vention, with interviews conducted between 2003 and 2007.
The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study (MacRisk
Study; N=1,136) (2) evaluated violence among psychiatric
patients on civil commitments; data were collected through
participant and collateral interviews and abstraction from
hospital records from 1992 to 1995. The Schizophrenia Care
and Assessment Program (SCAP; N=404) (26) examined
clinical, functional, and service outcomes for adults with
schizophrenia from 1997 to 2002. The MacArthur study of
mandated community treatment (MacMandate; N=1,011)
(27) assessed treatment leverage among psychiatric out-
patients between 2002 and 2003 (1). The Clinical Anti-
psychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE;
N=1,460) (28) examined the effectiveness of antipsychotic
medications among adults with schizophrenia between 2001
and 2004.
The protocol for the study reported here was approved by
institutional review boards from North Carolina State Uni-
versity, RTI International, and Arizona State University. All
participants gave written informed consent. Parent studies
enrolled a range of participants, from inpatients with exac-
erbated symptoms to outpatients in partial remission. To-
gether, the characteristics of the sample used for this study
approximate those of a usual-care, noninterventional pop-
ulation. Analyses were conducted with data from 2,579
participants available at six-month follow-up (74% of the
longitudinal subsample).
Measures
Outcome variable. Prevalence and severity of community
violence were assessed in all studies by using the MacArthur
Community Violence Screening Instrument (MCVSI) (2).
The MCVSI comprises eight questions each for violence
and victimization; questions are derived from the Revised
Conflict Tactics Scale (29). Specifically, the questions as-
sess pushing, grabbing, or shoving; kicking, biting, or
choking; slapping; throwing an object; hitting with a fist or
object; sexual assault; threatening with a weapon in hand;
and using a weapon. For each item, participants are first
asked whether someone did this to them and then whether
they did this to someone else. Factor analyses (not presented
here but available upon request) showed that the violence
and victimization items each mapped onto a unidimen-
sional factor in the current sample. These findings are con-
sistent with prior psychometric evaluations of the MCVSI
(20,30).
For the analyses reported here, violence and victimiza-
tion factor scores were created from unidimensional factor
models by using expected a posteriori (EAP) estimates. EAP
estimates are calculated as the mean of the posterior-
predicted distribution of scores for an individual based on
his or her response pattern and the estimated model pa-
rameters. The factor scores account for incomplete data and
reflect the items to which the participant responded affir-
matively, such that a higher score indicates greater preva-
lence or severity of violence. Because the MacMandate study
was cross-sectional in design, participant data were used in
the calculation of factor scores but were excluded from
predictive analyses. In the MacRisk Study, violence was also
assessed three months after the baseline interview; to in-
clude these data, we averaged three- and six-month factor
scores.

PROXIMAL RISK FACTORS FOR SHORT-TERM COMMUNITY VIOLENCE
 Static predictors. Participant age was measured continuously
(in years) at baseline. Sex was coded dichotomously (1, male;
0, female). Race-ethnicity was captured with four variables:
white, black, Hispanic, and other. Primary diagnosis was
measured with five dummy variables: schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, major depressive disorder, substance use disorder,
and other disorder (for example, anxiety disorder). Psychi-
atric diagnoses were obtained through a combination of
clinician diagnoses and medical records abstraction.
Proximal predictors. Current alcohol and drug use were
assessed at baseline with multiple measures across studies.
Measures included the CAGE questionnaire (31), urine drug
screens, self-report, the Alcohol or Drug Use Scales (32), and
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (33). For both
alcohol use and drug use, we harmonized data across
studies by creating a three-level indicator (0, abstinence; 1,
nonproblematic use; and 2, problematic use).
Our indicators of clinical functioning included current
psychiatric symptoms and recent hospitalization. Psychiat-
ric symptoms were assessed at baseline with the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale (34) in the CATIE and SCAP
and with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (35) in the F-PAD
and MacRisk studies. Briefly, a factor-analytic cross-
validation approach was employed, with exploratory factor
analyses conducted on a random subsample of data in which
four factors were retained: affect, positive symptoms, nega-
tive symptoms, and disorganized cognitive processing. This
model was then evaluated and supported by using a confir-
matory factor model with the remainder of the data. Factor
scores for each latent trait were then created as described
above (Van Dorn et al., unpublished manuscript, 2015).
Recent hospitalization was measured in all studies and in-
dicated whether a participant was hospitalized in the three
months prior to the baseline assessment.
Recent violence and recent victimization referred to the
baseline factor scores, created as described above.
Data Analysis
All analyses were conducted with SAS, version 9.4. De-
scriptive statistics were calculated for all variables, and
characteristics were compared between participants who
were and were not available at follow-up. For bivariate and
multivariable analyses, we used all cases with data at
baseline and six-month follow-up (N=2,579). Bivariate as-
sociations of predictor variables with violence at six-month
follow-up were examined by using a series of one-way
analyses of variance and Pearson correlations; post hoc
comparisons were conducted by using Bonferroni-
adjusted t tests. A hierarchical linear regression analysis
assessed the incremental validity of several variable clus-
ters in the prediction of violence risk. Variables were en-
tered into the model in five steps: static characteristics,
substance use, clinical functioning, recent violence, and
recent victimization. Listwise deletion was used in cases of
missing data. We included the parent study as a covariate in
multivariable analyses to control for differences across
studies.
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Frequencies and means for all predictor variables are re-
ported in Table 1. Characteristics of the participants who
completed follow-up interviews differed from the full,
baseline sample in several ways (Table 1). In general, those
present at follow-up exhibited poorer psychosocial func-
tioning at baseline. These factors were included as predic-
tors in subsequent analyses. Of the 2,579 participants
available at six-month follow-up, almost two-thirds were
male. About half were white, about a third were black, and
the remainder identified as Hispanic or other race-ethnicity.
Schizophrenia was the most prevalent primary diagnosis,
followed by major depression, bipolar disorder, substance
use disorder, and other disorder (for example, anxiety dis-
order). Just over half had been hospitalized within three
months of baseline. At baseline, most participants reported
abstinence from both alcohol and drugs. Approximately one-
quarter of participants reported perpetrating at least one
violent act, and about one-third reported experiencing at
least one incident of victimization in the six months pre-
ceding baseline. At follow-up, 23% of participants reported
perpetrating at least one violent act in the past six months.
Prevalence rates for each type of act are reported else-
where (20).
Bivariate Analyses
The mean, standard deviation, and range of six-month vio-
lence factor scores, overall and across participant character-
istics, are presented in Table 2. Results of bivariate analyses
showed that all predictor variables were associated with
short-term violence, with the exception of race-ethnicity.
Age was negatively correlated with violence. Compared with
female participants at follow-up, male participants reported
less violence. Participants with a primary diagnosis of
schizophrenia reported less violence than participants with
other diagnoses. Participants with bipolar disorder reported
less violence than those with major depression and those
with a substance use disorder. Nonproblematic and prob-
lematic use of both alcohol and drugs were positively asso-
ciated with violence. Affect was positively correlated with
violence, whereas all other psychiatric symptoms exhibited
negative correlations with the outcome variable. Recent
hospitalization and baseline violence and victimization were
positively correlated with violence.
Multivariable Analyses
Diagnostic tests showed that tolerance values were all .420 or
higher and variation inflation factor values were all below 2.379,
indicating no multicollinearity among predictor variables (36).
Model fit statistics and incremental validity of predictors across
steps are presented in Table 3. Overall, results show improved

 prediction with each step, indicating that proximal indicators
contributed to the prediction of short-term community vio-
lence above and beyond the static characteristics included in
the regression model.
Table 4 shows the final step of the model.
In the final step, young age, female sex,
and primary diagnoses of major depression
and substance use disorder (compared with
schizophrenia) were positive predictors of
violence. Alcohol use, but not drug use, was
a positive predictor of violence. None of
the psychiatric symptoms were significant
predictors. Baseline violence and victimiza-
tion each significantly predicted six-month
violence.
DISCUSSION
Clinical assessments of violence risk inform
delivery of mental health services, including
treatment approaches, risk management
strategies, and mandated treatment orders.
This study examined individual and com-
bined effects of static characteristics and of
proximal, clinically relevant indicators of vi-
olence risk in a large, heterogeneous sample
of adults with mental illnesses. Consistent
with prior research, we found empirical
support for the role of static characteristics,
including age, sex, and primary diagnosis,
in predicting community violence; however,
alcohol use, violence, and victimization
predicted subsequent violence, even after the
analysis controlled for static characteristics.
These findings add to the empirical evidence
supporting the role of proximal factors in the
assessment and management of short-term
violence risk among adults with mental ill-
nesses (15,37,38). Below, we discuss the ob-
served effects of these proximal factors and
how results may inform the administration of
risk assessment instruments and formulation
of interventions.
Although there is consensus on the in-
creased risk of violence associated with
substance use among adults with mental
illnesses, extant findings are mixed regarding
which indicator—alcohol use or drug use—
is the more robust predictor (15,39,40). In
this study’s multivariable models, alcohol use
emerged as the better predictor of short-term
community violence among adults with
mental illnesses. (However, the bivariate re-
lationship between drug use and subsequent
violence was significant.) As such, integrated
interventions targeting mental illness and
alcohol use should reduce community-based violence risk
in this population. These distinctions between alcohol and
drug use become important when clinical efforts are not just
broadly focused on improving psychosocial functioning

PROXIMAL RISK FACTORS FOR SHORT-TERM COMMUNITY VIOLENCE
 among psychiatric patients
but are also focused on re-
ducing dangerousness to oth-
ers (5,6).
Bivariate findings regard-
ing the associations between
clinical functioning and short-
term violence risk underscore
the importance of precise mea-
surementandspecification of
psychiatric symptoms in re-
search and practice. Although
psychiatric symptoms failed
to maintain significance in the
multivariable model, their in-
dividual relationships with
short-term violence remain
relevant to clinical practice.
Prior research on the associ-
ations between affect, positive
symptoms, negative symp-
toms, and disorganized cog-
nitive processing symptoms
and violence perpetration has
sometimes been inconsistent
(41,42). This may result, in
part,fromexaminationof these
symptoms as individual pre-
dictors, as well as from dif-
ferences in assessment and
follow-up time frames (16).
Indeed, most significant as-
sociations are found in cross-
sectional structures, which do
not ensure temporality (Van
Dorn et al., unpublished man-
uscript, 2015). The findings of
this study suggest that con-
sideration of current psychiatric symptoms, instead of psy-
chiatric diagnosis alone, should assist in the identification of
individuals at heightened risk of short-term violence. Fur-
thermore, evidence-based treatment targeting psychiatric
symptoms, including cognitive, behavioral, and psychophar-
macological interventions, should contribute to reductions in
violence risk (43–46). Beyond these main effects, however,
there remains a need for research examining how these
symptoms may interact with one another to increase violence
risk (47).
The strong effect of past violence provides further evidence
that a history of violence is a key risk factor for future violence
but also suggests that recent violence, specifically, should be
attended to in clinical assessments of short-term risk. The
same is true for victimization; in fact, recent victimization,
although rarely examined in research, added to the pre-
diction of short-term violence when the analysis con-
trolled for all other factors in the model, including recent
violence. This finding, consistent with that of Sadeh and
colleagues (24) regarding the role of victimization in pre-
dicting long-term (that is, 12-month) violence, provides
compelling evidence that recent victimization should be
considered in the assessment of both short- and long-term
violence risk. However, to our knowledge, only one instru-
ment, the Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability
(START) (9), considers both recent violence and recent
victimization. Moreover, there is much discussion of and
emphasis on trauma-informed care in this population, and
among female psychiatric patients in particular, although
the focus is typically on childhood victimization experi-
ences (48,49). Findings suggest that trauma-informed ap-
proaches should also consider the trauma and sequelae of
adult victimization experiences and that these efforts may
reduce risk of violence.
This study had several strengths, including its large,
representative sample; inclusion of proximal, clinically

 relevant indicators; and prospective data structure. How-
ever, findings should be interpreted within the context of the
study’s limitations. First, our data on violence and victimi-
zation were derived from self-report and may thus be sus-
ceptible to the effects of social desirability, recall bias, and
errors. Although self-report is a valid and reliable approach
for collecting data on violence and victimization (50,51),
additional sources of information across all parent studies,
such as hospital and arrest records, may have assisted in
capturing non–self-reported violent events. Second, attrition
across studies over time resulted in missing outcome data for
a large portion of the integrated sample (N=1,905, 55%).
Nevertheless, this study remains the largest examination of
the effects of proximal indicators on short-term community
violence in this population. Third, the assessment periods
implemented across parent studies limited our evaluation of
even shorter-term effects. Specifically, we operationalized
recent, current, and short-term variables as occurring within
a six-month time frame; however, the optimal assessment
and prediction time frame for these variables is unknown.
CONCLUSIONS
This study provides empirical evidence for three proximal,
clinically relevant indicators in the assessment and man-
agement of short-term violence risk among adults with
mental illnesses: current alcohol use, recent violence, and
recent victimization. Although clinicians may never be able
to answer the public calls for the absolute prediction—and
prevention—of violence by adults with mental illnesses (6),
attending to these indicators in clinical practice should assist
in the identification of persons at heightened risk of
community-based violence. There is now a preponderance
of evidence demonstrating the superiority of structured over
unstructured approaches to assessing violence risk (52,53).
Clinicians should use a validated risk assessment instrument
that emphasizes proximal indicators, such as the START or
the HCR-20 (12), to reduce violence risk in this population
(54–56).
