ABSTRACT 
 
Loss-of-function mutations in  
JAK1 
/ 
2 can lead to acquired resistance to anti-
programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. We reasoned that they may also 
be involved in primary resistance to anti–PD-1 therapy.  
JAK1 
/ 
2- 
inactivating mutations were noted 
in tumor biopsies of 1 of 23 patients with melanoma and in 1 of 16 patients with mismatch repair–
defi
 cient colon cancer treated with PD-1 blockade. Both cases had a high mutational load but did 
not respond to anti–PD-1 therapy. Two out of 48 human melanoma cell lines had  
JAK1/2 mutations, 
which led to a lack of PD-L1 expression upon interferon gamma exposure mediated by an inability to 
signal through the interferon gamma receptor pathway.  
JAK1/2 loss-of-function alterations in The 
Cancer Genome Atlas confer adverse outcomes in patients. We propose that  
JAK1/2 loss-of-function 
mutations are a genetic mechanism of lack of reactive PD-L1 expression and response to interferon 
gamma, leading to primary resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: A key functional result from somatic  
JAK1/2 
 mutations in a cancer cell is the inability to 
respond to interferon gamma by expressing PD-L1 and many other interferon-stimulated genes. These 
mutations result in a genetic mechanism for the absence of reactive PD-L1 expression, and patients 
harboring such tumors would be unlikely to respond to PD-1 blockade therapy.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Blocking the programmed death 1 (PD-1) negative immune 
receptor results in unprecedented rates of long-lasting antitumor 
activity in patients with metastatic cancers of different histologies, 
including melanoma, Hodgkin disease, Merkel cell carcinoma, 
and head and neck, lung, esophageal, gastric, liver, kidney, ovarian, 
bladder, and high mutational load cancers with defective mis-
match repair, among others, in a rapidly growing list ( 
1–8 
). This 
remarkable antitumor activity is explained by the reactivation of 
tumor antigen–specifi
 c T cells that were previously inactive due 
to the interaction between PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 expressed 
by cancer cells ( 
1, 9–12 
). Upon tumor antigen recognition, T cells 
produce interferon gamma, which through the interferon gamma 
receptor, the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2, and the signal trans-
ducers and activators of transcription (STAT) results in the expres-
sion of a large number of interferon-stimulated genes. Most of 
these genes lead to benefi
 cial antitumor effects, such as increased 
antigen presentation through inducible proteasome subunits, 
transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP), and the 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC), as well as increased 
production of chemokines that attract T cells and direct tumor 
growth arrest and apoptosis ( 
13 
). However, interferon gamma also 
provides the signal that allows cancer cells to inactivate antitumor 
T cells by the adaptive expression of PD-L1 ( 
9 
), thereby specifi
 cally 
escaping their cytotoxic effects ( 
12 
). 
 
Acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade in patients with 
advanced melanoma can be associated with loss-of-function 
mutations with loss of heterozygosity in  
JAK1/2 
 or in beta 
2-microglobulin ( 
B2M 
; ref. 
 14 
). The complex genetic changes 
leading to acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade, wherein one 
 
JAK1/2 allele was mutated and amplifi
 ed and the other was 
lost, suggest a strong selective pressure induced by the thera-
peutic immune response. Similar events leading to lack of sen-
sitivity to interferon gamma have been reported in the cancer 
immune-editing process and acquired resistance to immuno-
therapy in mouse models ( 
15–17 
) and in patients treated with 
the anti–CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab who did not respond to 
therapy ( 
18 
). Therefore, lack of interferon gamma responsive-
ness allows cancer cells to escape from antitumor T cells, and in 
the context of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, results in the loss of 
PD-L1 expression, the target of PD-1 blockade therapy, which 
would abrogate the antitumor effi
 cacy of this approach. 
 
In order to explore the role of  
JAK1 and  
JAK2 
 disruption in 
primary resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy, we performed a 
genetic analysis of tumors from patients with melanoma and 
colon cancer who did not respond to PD-1 blockade therapy 
despite having a high mutational load. We identifi
 ed tumors 
with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in  
JAK1 
 and 
 
JAK2 and studied the functional effects of defi
 cient interferon 
gamma receptor signaling that lead to a genetically mediated 
absence of PD-L1 expression upon interferon gamma exposure.

blockade therapy ( 
6, 19–21 
). However, in all of these series 
some patients failed to respond despite having a high muta-
tional load. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES 
) 
of 23 pretreatment biopsies from patients with advanced 
melanoma treated with anti–PD-1 therapy, which included 14 
patients with a tumor response by immune-related RECIST 
(irRECIST) criteria and 9 without a response (Supplemen-
tary Table S1). Even though the mean mutational load was 
higher in responders than nonresponders, as reported for 
lung, colon, and bladder cancers ( 
6, 19, 21 
), some patients 
with a tumor response had a low mutational load and some 
patients without a tumor response had a high mutational 
load ( 
Fig. 1A 
). 
 
 
We then assessed whether loss-of-function mutations in 
interferon receptor signaling molecules, which would prevent 
adaptive expression of PD-L1, might be present in tumors 
with a relatively high mutational load that did not respond 
to therapy. A melanoma biopsy from the patient with the 
highest mutational load among the 9 nonresponders (patient 
#15) had a somatic P429S missense mutation in the src-
homology (SH2) domain of  
JAK1 
 ( 
Fig. 1B 
). WES of an early 
passage cell line derived from this tumor (M431) showed an 
amplifi
 cation of chromosome 1p, including the  
JAK1 
 locus, 
and a 4:1 mutant:wild-type allele ratio was observed at both 
the DNA and RNA level (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1E and 
Supplementary Database S1). None of the tumors from the 
other 22 patients had homozygous loss-of-function muta-
tions or deletions in the interferon receptor pathway. Rather, 
the other  
JAK2 
 mutations found in biopsies of responders 
had low variant allele frequency (VAF) as shown in  
Fig. 1B 
and were likely heterozygous. These mutations would not 
carry the same functional signifi
 cance, as signaling would 
still occur upon interferon exposure through the wild-type 
JAK protein from the nonmutated allele. Two nonresponders 
had  
IFNGR 
 mutations, also of low allele frequency and there-
fore uncertain signifi
 cance. We also analyzed potential muta-
tions in genes involved in the antigen-presenting machinery 
and did not fi
 nd any loss-of-function mutations that were 
homozygous (Supplementary Fig. S2). 
 
As expected, tumors from patients who responded had 
a higher density of CD8 cells and PD-L1 in the center and 
invasive tumor margin ( 
Fig. 1C and D 
). In contrast, the base-
line biopsy from patient #15 with a high mutational load but 
with the  
JAK1 
 
P429S  missense mutation had undetectable CD8 
infi
 ltrates, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 
S3). The amplifi
 cation of  
PD-L1, PD-L2, 
 and  
JAK2 (PDJ ampli-
con), which has been associated with a high response rate in 
Hodgkin disease ( 
4 
), was noted only in patient #16, who did 
not respond to PD-1 blockade therapy despite having the 
second highest mutational load and a high level of PD-L1 
expression ( 
Fig. 1B, D and E 
). 
 
 
 
Functional Analyses of the Role of  
JAK 
 Loss-of-
Function Mutations in Regulating PD-L1 Expression 
 
We next sought to characterize the interferon response 
of M431, the melanoma cell line established from a biopsy 
of patient #15 with high mutational load and no response 
to therapy. First, we optimized fl
 ow cytometry conditions in 
selected human melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Figs. S4A–
S4F, S5A–S5D, S6A–S6H, and S7A–S7C). PD-L1 expression 
increased less than 1.5-fold interferon gamma exposure in 
M431 ( 
Fig. 2A 
), versus 5.1-fold in M438, a cell line estab-
lished from patient #8 used as a positive control in this 
same series. Phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) was induced at 
30 minutes in M431, but the signal dissipated at 18 hours, 
faster than in cell lines with more durable responses to 
interferon gamma leading to PD-L1 upregulation ( 
Fig. 2B, 
C compared with Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8C). These data 
are consistent with the 4:1  
JAK1 
 mutant:wild-type allele fre-
quency in the M431 cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1E). 
 
 
We then screened a panel of 48 human melanoma cell 
lines for absolute absence of PD-L1 induction by either type 
I (alpha and beta) or type II (gamma) interferons. Among the 
three interferons, interferon gamma most potently induced 
PD-L1 expression ( 
Fig. 2D 
; Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B 
for type I interferons). Two cell lines had  
JAK1/2 
 homozygous 
loss-of-function mutations and did not respond to interferon 
gamma with upregulation of surface PD-L1 expression. M368 
had a mutation in  
JAK2 
 (20 out of 22 reads, VAF = 0.91) that 
is predicted to disrupt and shift the D313 splice-site acceptor 
in exon 8 by one nucleotide, changing the reading frame, and 
had loss of the wild-type allele ( 
Fig. 3A 
; Supplementary Fig. 
S10A and S10B). M395 had an inactivating  
JAK1 
D775N kinase 
domain mutation in exon 17 and loss of the other allele (140 
out of 143 reads, variant allele frequency 0.98;  
Fig. 3B 
). 
 
 
We then analyzed signaling in response to interferon alpha, 
beta, and gamma in these two cell lines. M368, which harbored 
the  
JAK2 loss-of-function mutation, maintained signaling in 
response to interferon alpha and beta, but did not respond to 
interferon gamma ( 
Fig. 3C 
), which resulted in the ability of 
M368 to upregulate PD-L1 when exposed to interferon alpha 
and beta, but not to interferon gamma ( 
Fig. 3C 
; Supplementary 
Fig. S9A and S9B). M395, which harbored the  
JAK1 
 loss-of-
function mutation, did not respond to downstream signaling 
to interferon alpha, beta, or gamma ( 
Fig. 3D 
), and equally did 
not upregulate PD-L1 in response to any of these cytokines ( 
Fig. 
3D 
; Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B). We were able to retrieve 
the tumor from which the cell line M395 had been established, 
and this tumor exhibited an absence of CD8 infi
 ltration simi-
lar to the fi
 nding in patient #15 with a  
JAK1 
 loss-of-function 
mutation who did not respond to anti–PD-1 therapy (Sup-
plementary Fig. S11). Taken together, these data are consistent 
with the knowledge that JAK1 (disabled in M395) is required 
to propagate signaling downstream of the interferon alpha/
beta and gamma receptors, whereas JAK2 (disabled in M368) 
is required for signaling downstream only from the interferon 
gamma receptor ( 
22–24 
). 
 
To assess a causal relationship between loss of adaptive PD-L1 
expression and loss-of-function  
JAK 
 mutations, we transduced 
the M395 and M431 cell lines with a lentivirus vector express-
ing  
JAK1 
 wild-type (Supplementary Fig. S12A–S12C). Rein-
troduction of wild-type JAK1 rescued PD-L1 expression in 
M395 cells, which exhibited a 4-fold increase in PD-L1 surface 
expression after interferon gamma exposure ( 
Fig. 3E 
). For 
M431, the magnitude of change in PD-L1 expression after 
18-hour interferon gamma exposure for M431 was modest 
after reintroducing the JAK1 wild-type protein (approximately 
2-fold, compared with a 1.5-fold in the untransduced cell line; 
 
Fig. 3F 
). However, the difference between untransduced and

JAK Loss-of-Function Mutations in Primary 
Resistance to PD-1 Blockade in Patients with 
Metastatic Colon Carcinoma 
 
To determine whether  
JAK1/2 
 loss-of-function mutations 
are present and relate to response to PD-1 blockade therapy 
in another cancer histology, we analyzed WES data from 16 
biopsies of patients with colon cancer, many with a high muta-
tional load resultant from mismatch-repair defi
 ciency ( 
6 
). One 
of the biopsies of a rare patient with high mutational load 
with neither an objective response nor disease control with anti–
PD-1 had a homozygous  
JAK1 
W690*  
 nonsense loss-of-function 
mutation, expected to truncate the protein within the fi
 rst 
kinase domain, and an accompanying loss of heterozygosity at 
the  
JAK1 
 locus ( 
Fig. 4A–D 
). No mutations in antigen presen-
tation machinery were detected in this sample (Supplementary 
Fig. S13). Although we observed other interferon pathway 
and antigen presentation mutations in the high mutational 
load patients with a response to therapy in this cohort, they 
appeared to be heterozygous by allele frequency (adjusted VAF 
< 0.6) after adjustment for stromal content. Most were splice-
site mutations or frameshift insertions/deletions unlikely to 
create a dominant-negative effect. Several samples bore two 
mutations in  
JAK1/2 
 or  
B2M 
, but either retained at least one 
wild-type copy (subjects #4 and #5), were too far apart to deter-
mine cis versus trans status (subject #6), or were of uncertain 
signifi
 cance (subject #1, both near c-terminus). 
 
 
 
Frequency of  
JAK Loss-of-Function Mutations 
in Cell Lines of Multiple Histologies 
 
We then analyzed data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclo-
pedia (CCLE) from cBioPortal to determine the frequency of 
homozygous putative loss-of-function mutations in  
JAK1/2 in 
905 cancer cell lines ( 
25 
). For this analysis, we considered a 
homozygous mutation when the VAF was 0.8 or greater, as 
previously described ( 
26 
). Approximately 0.7% of cell lines have 
loss-of-function mutations that may predict lack of response to 
interferons ( 
Fig. 5A and  
5B 
). The highest frequency of mutations 
was in endometrial cancers, as described previously ( 
26 
). None of 
these cell lines had  
POLE 
 or  
POLD1 
 mutations, but microsatel-
lite instability and DNA-damage gene mutations were present 
in the  
JAK1/2 
 mutant cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S14). The 
frequency of  
JAK1/2 
 mutations across all cancers suggests that 
there is a fi
 tness gain with loss of interferon responsiveness. 
 
 
 
JAK1/2 Loss-of-Function Alterations in The 
Cancer Genome Atlas 
 
Analysis of WES, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and reverse-
phase protein array (RPPA) data from tissue specimens from 
472 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Skin Cuta-
neous Melanoma dataset revealed that 6% (28 of 472) and 
11% (50 of 472) harbored alterations in  
JAK1 and  
JAK2 
, res-
pectively. These include loss-of-function alterations in either 
 
JAK1 or JAK2 
 that would putatively diminish JAK1 or JAK2 
signaling (homodeletions, truncating mutations, or gene or 
protein downregulation). 
 
There was no survival difference in patients in the TCGA 
Skin Cutaneous Melanoma dataset harboring any  
JAK1 
 or 
 
JAK2 
 alteration ( 
Fig. 6A 
). However, when considering only 
loss-of-function  
JAK1 or JAK2 
 alterations (homodeletions, 
truncating mutations, or gene or protein downregulation), 
patients with tumors that had  
JAK1 or  
JAK2 alterations had 
signifi
 cantly decreased overall survival ( 
P 
 = 0.009, log-rank 
test). When considered separately, the 8 patients with trun-
cating mutations in  
JAK1 or  
JAK2 and the 18 patients with 
 
JAK1 or  
JAK2 gene or protein downregulation also had sig-
nifi
 cantly decreased overall survival ( 
P 
 = 0.016 and  
P 
 < 0.001, 
respectively). 
 
 
To assess the relevance of these fi
 ndings in a broader set 
of malignancies, we examined the frequency of  
JAK1 
 and 
 
JAK2 
 alterations and their association with clinical outcome in 
TCGA datasets for four common malignancies (breast invasive 
carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, 
and colorectal adenocarcinoma). Similar to fi
 ndings in mela-
noma, alterations in  
JAK1 
 were found in 6%, 8%, 10%, and 10% 
of patients with breast invasive carcinoma, prostate adeno-
carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and colorectal adenocarci-
noma, respectively. Likewise, alterations in  
JAK2 were found in 
12%, 7%, 12%, and 5% of these respective malignancies. 
 
Consistent with our fi
 ndings in melanoma,  
JAK1 or  
JAK2 
 
alterations as a whole were not associated with a difference 
in survival in any of the four additional TCGA datasets. 
However, for patients with breast invasive carcinoma har-
boring truncating mutations, there was an association with 
decreased survival ( 
P 
 = 0.006, log-rank test;  
Fig. 6B 
). Likewise, 
patients with prostate adenocarcinoma harboring truncating 
mutations had worse overall survival ( 
P 
 = 0.009, log-rank 
test;  
Fig. 6C 
), with a similar trend noted in patients harbor-
ing any loss-of-function  
JAK1 or JAK2 alterations ( 
P 
 = 0.083, 
 
Fig. 6C 
). We did not observe differences in survival in patients 
with lung adenocarcinoma or colorectal adenocarcinoma 
harboring  
JAK1 or  
JAK2 
 loss-of-function alterations, when 
considered either separately or as a whole (Supplementary 
Fig. S15A and S15B). 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
For this work, we hypothesized that if cancer cells evolved 
to disable inducible PD-L1 expression upon interferon expo-
sure due to selective immune pressure as demonstrated in 
preclinical models of cancer immune-editing ( 
15, 16 
), then 
it would be superfl
 uous to attempt to treat these cases 
with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy (Supplementary 
Fig. S16A and S16B). The premise of therapy with anti–PD-1– 
or anti–PD-L1–blocking antibodies is that T cells with speci-
fi
 city for cancer antigens recognize their target on cancer cells 
and produce interferon gamma. The cancer cell then fi
 nds 
a way to specifi
 cally protect itself from the T-cell attack by 
reactively expressing PD-L1 upon interferon gamma signal-
ing. This reactive process is termed adaptive immune resist-
ance, and it requires signaling through the interferon gamma 
receptor ( 
12 
). By understanding this process, it is then logical 
to anticipate that a genetically acquired insensitivity to inter-
feron gamma signaling could represent an immune resistance 
mechanism; these tumors would be expected to be incapa-
ble of upregulating either antigen-presenting machinery or 
PD-L1 even in the presence of a robust preexisting repertoire 
of tumor-specifi
 c T cells. With a genetic mechanism of lack

of interferon gamma signaling, a T-cell response with inter-
feron gamma production would not lead to reactive PD-L1 
expression and therefore these would be cases that would be 
considered constitutively PD-L1 negative. 
 
JAK kinases mediate signaling from many cytokine recep-
tors, but the commonality between  
JAK1 
 and  
JAK2 
 homozy-
gous loss-of-function mutations is that they are both required 
for signaling upon exposure to interferon gamma ( 
27 
). Inter-
feron gamma is a major cytokine produced by T cells upon 
recognizing their cognate antigen, and it has multiple effects 
on target cells. In the setting of acquired resistance to PD-1 
blockade therapy in patients who progressed while on continu-
ous anti–PD-1 therapy, the tumor’
s insensitivity to interferon 
gamma provides a selective advantage for the relapsed cancer to 
grow, as it no longer is sensitive to the antiproliferative effects 
of interferon gamma ( 
14 
). In that setting, T cells continued to 
recognize cancer cells with  
JAK1 
 or  
JAK2 
 mutations despite the 
known role of interferon gamma signaling in upregulating a 
series of genes involved in the antigen-presenting machinery. 
However, as the baseline expression of MHC class I, protea-
some subunits and TAP transporters is unchanged, tumor 
antigen presentation to T cells was not impaired ( 
14 
). 
 
In primary resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy with 
the anti–CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab, there is a higher fre-
quency of mutations in the several molecules involved in the 
interferon signaling pathway ( 
18 
). It is hypothesized that 
cancer cells lacking interferon receptor signaling would have 
a selective advantage because they evade T cells activated by 
CTLA-4 blockade, in particular through decreased antigen 
presentation and resistance to the antiproliferative effects of 
interferons. The same processes may have an important role in 
the lack of response to anti–PD-1 therapy in the cancers with 
 
JAK1/2 
 loss-of-function mutations in our series, as antitumor 
T cells would be anticipated to have lower ability to recognize 
and kill cancer cells. Loss-of-function mutations in  
JAK1/2 
 
would likewise prevent the antitumor activity of any immuno-
therapy that results in the activation of T cells to attack cancer 
cells. But in the setting of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, it has the

additional important effect of preventing PD-L1 expression 
upon interferon gamma exposure, thereby making it futile to 
pharmacologically inhibit the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction. 
 
As the interferon gamma receptor pathway downstream of 
JAK1/2 controls the expression of chemokines with a potent 
chemoattractant effect on T cells, such as CXCL9, CXCL10, 
and CXCL11 ( 
28 
), it is possible that an important effect of 
 
JAK1/2 
 loss may result in a lack of T-cell infi
 ltrates. Indeed, 
both the patient in the melanoma series with a  
JAK1 
 loss of 
function and the biopsy from which we had derived a mela-
noma cell line with a  
JAK1 
 mutation were completely devoid of 
T-cell infi
 ltrates. As preexisting T cells in the tumor are a requi-
site for response to anti–PD-1 therapy ( 
11 
), a  
JAK1/2 
 mutation 
may result in lack of response not only because PD-L1 cannot 
be reactively expressed but also because the cancer fails to 
attract T cells due to lack of chemokine production. 
 
Beyond a genetic mutation that prevented expression of 
 
JAK1/2 
, it is also possible that epigenetic silencing of  
JAK 
s 
could result in lack of response to interferon gamma, as previ-
ously reported for the LNCaP cell line ( 
29 
). In this case, loss 
of JAK1/2 expression could then be corrected with exposure 
to a demethylating agent. This evidence suggests that the fre-
quency of loss of function in  
JAK1/2 
 may be higher than can 
be estimated by exome-sequencing analyses, as it could occur 
epigenetically, and in these cases it would provide an option 
for pharmacologic intervention. 
 
In conclusion, we propose that  
JAK1/2 mutations that lead 
to loss of interferon gamma signaling and prevent adaptive 
PD-L1 expression upon interferon gamma exposure represent 
an immunoediting process that defi
 nes patients with cancer 
who would not be good candidates for PD-1 blockade therapy. 
This mechanism would add to other multiple explanations 
that may lead to primary resistance to PD-1 blockade therapy, 
including a tumor that lacks antigens that can be a target for 
a T-cell response, the presence of immune suppressive factors 
in the tumor microenvironment that exclude T cells in tumors 
or that lead to alteration of T-cell function, presence of immune 
suppressive cells such as T regulatory or myeloid-derived sup-
pressor cells, or cancers that have specifi
 c genetic signaling 
or transcriptomes that are not permissive to T-cell infi
 ltrates 
( 
20, 30, 31 
). The recognition that  
JAK1/2 
 loss-of-function 
mutations would lead to lack of response to PD-1 blockade 
therapy could be incorporated in oncogenic sequencing panels 
used to select patients for precision cancer treatments. 
 
 
METHODS 
 
Tumor Samples 
 
Tumor biopsies were obtained from a subset of patients enrolled in 
a phase I expansion clinical trial with pembrolizumab after signing a 
written informed consent ( 
32 
). Patients were selected for this analy-
sis by having adequate tumor biopsy samples and clinical follow-up. 
Baseline biopsies of metastatic tumors were obtained within 30 days 
of starting on treatment, except for one in a patient with an eventual 
complete response ( 
Fig. 3B 
, subject #4) collected after 84 days on 
treatment. Samples were immediately fi
 xed in formalin followed by 
paraffi
 n embedding, and when there was an additional sterile piece 
of the tumor, processed for snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen and to 
establish a cell line as previously described ( 
33–35 
). Tumor biopsy 
and peripheral blood cell collection and analyses were approved by 
UCLA Institutional Review Boards 11-001918 and 11-003066. 
 
 
 
Treatment and Response Assessment 
 
Patients received single-agent pembrolizumab intravenously in one 
of three dosing regimens: 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (2Q3W), 10 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks (10Q3W), or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (10Q2W; ref.  
32 
). 
Tumor responses to pembrolizumab were evaluated at 12 weeks after 
the fi
 rst infusion (confi
 rmed at 16 weeks), and every 12 weeks there-
after. The RECIST version 1.1 was used to defi
 ne objective clinical res-
ponses. The protocol was allowed to proceed beyond initial progression 
at the restaging scans at 12 weeks and have repeated imaging scans 4 
weeks later following the immune-related response criteria (irRC; ref. 
 36 
). 
 
 
IHC Staining 
 
For CD8 T-cell density, 5 of the 11 cases were reanalyzed blindly 
from IHC samples already used in our prior work ( 
11 
), and the other 
6 cases were newly stained cases also analyzed blindly. Slides were 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin, S100, CD8, CD68, PD-1, and 
PD-L1 at the UCLA Anatomic Pathology IHC Laboratory. Immu-
nostaining was performed on Leica Bond III autostainers using Leica 
Bond ancillary reagents and the REFINE polymer DAB detection 
system as previously described ( 
11 
). Cell density (cells/mm 
2 
) in the 
invasive margin or intratumoral area was calculated using the Indica 
Labs Halo platform as previously described ( 
11 
). 
 
 
 
Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and Conditions 
 
Patient-derived melanoma cell lines were generated as reported 
previously and characterized for their oncogenic mutational status 
( 
33–35 
). Each melanoma cell line was thawed and maintained in 
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL 
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37°C in a humidifi
 ed 
atmosphere of 5% CO 
2 
. Cells were subject to experimental con-
ditions after reaching two passages from thawing. Cell lines were 
periodically authenticated using GenePrint 10 System (Promega) 
and were matched with the earliest passage cell lines. Selected mela-
noma cell lines were subjected to  
Mycoplasma tests periodically (every 
2–3 months) with the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). 
 
 
 
Surface Flow Cytometry Analysis for PD-L1 and MHC Class I 
 
Melanoma cells were seeded into 6-well plates on day 1, ranging 
from 420,000 to 485,000 depending on their doubling time, target-
ing 70% to 80% of confl
 uence at the time of trypsinization after 18 
hours of exposure to interferons. For 48-hour exposure, 225,000 to 
280,000 cells were seeded, and 185,000 to 200,000 cells were seeded 
for 72-hour exposure. After trypsinization, cells were incubated at 
37°C for 2 hours with media containing different concentrations of 
interferons. Concentrations of each interferon were determined after 
optimization process (dose–response curves were generated with 
representative cell lines as shown in Supplementary Fig. S5B–S5D). 
After 2 hours of incubation, the media were removed by centrifuga-
tion and cells were resuspended with 100% FBS and stained with APC 
anti–PD-L1 antibody on ice for 20 minutes. The staining was halted 
by washing with 3 mL of PBS, which was removed by centrifugation 
at 500 ×  
g 
 for 4 minutes. The cells were resuspended with 300 μL of 
PBS, and 7-AAD for dead cell discrimination was added to samples 
prior to data acquisition by LSRII. The data were analyzed by FlowJo 
software (Version 10.0.8r1, Tree Star Inc.). Experiments were per-
formed at least twice for each cell line; some cell lines with high assay 
variability were analyzed three times. 
 
Phosphofl
 ow Signaling Analyses 
 
Cells were seeded into two 6-well plates for each cell line for single 
phospho-proteomics study. After 30-minute or 18-hour exposure to 
interferon alpha, beta, or gamma, cells were trypsinized and resus-
pended with 1 mL of PBS per 1 to 3 million cells and stained with 
live/dead agent at room temperature in the dark for 30 minutes.

Cells were then fi
 xed with paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 
10 minutes in the dark, permeabilized by methanol, and stained with 
pSTAT1. Cells were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 
30 minutes, washed with phospho-fl
 ow cytometry buffer, and resus-
pended with 300 to 500 μL of the same buffer and analyzed with an 
LSRII. The fl
 ow cytometry standard (FCS) fi
 les obtained by LSRII were 
analyzed using the online fl
 ow cytometry program (Cytobank; ref.  
37 
). 
The raw FCS fi
 les were deconvoluted into four different conditions, 
three of which were exposed to interferon alpha, beta, and gamma and 
compared with an untreated condition at each time point. Data repre-
sented as Arcsinh ratio, which is one of transformed ratio of cytometry 
data (inverse hyperbolic sine) analyses; each data point was compared 
with its control [Value = arcsinh((x − control)/scale_argument)]. 
 
 
Western Blot Analyses 
 
Selected melanoma cells were maintained in 10-cm cell culture 
dishes and exposed to interferon alpha, beta, or gamma (same con-
centrations as above) for 30 minutes or 18 hours. Western blotting 
was performed as described previously ( 
38 
). Primary antibodies 
included pJAK1 (Tyr1022/1023), pJAK2 (Tyr221), pSTAT1 (Tyr701), 
pSTAT3 (Tyr705), pSTAT5 (Tyr695), and their total proteins; PIAS1, 
IRF1, SOCS1, and GAPDH (all from Cell Signaling Technology). 
Antibodies were diluted to 1:1,000 ratio for each blot. Immunore-
activity was revealed with an ECL-Plus Kit (Amersham Biosciences 
Co.), using the ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-rad Laboratories). 
 
 
 
Lentiviral Vector Production and Gene Transfer 
 
Lentivirus production was performed by transient cotransfection of 
293T cells (ATCC). The lentiviral vectors pLenti-C-mGFP and pLenti-
C-JAK1-mGFP were purchased from Origen (cat# RC213878L2). In 
brief, T175 tissue culture fl
 asks coated with poly- 
L 
-lysine (Sigma 
Aldrich) containing 6 × 10 
6 
 293T cells were used for each transfec-
tion. The constructs required for the packaging of third-generation 
self-inactivating lentiviral vectors pLenti-C-mGFP and pLenti-C-
JAK1-mGFP (60 μg), pMDLGg/p (39 μg), pRSV–REV (15 μg), and 
pMD.G (21 μg) were dissolved in water in a total volume of 2.7 mL. A 
total of 300 μL of 2.5 mol/L CaCl 
2 
 (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the 
DNA mixture. A total of 2.8 mL of the DNA/CaCl 
2  mix was added 
dropwise to 2.8 mL of 2× HBS buffer, pH 7.12 (280 nmol/L NaCl, 1.5 
mmol/L Na 
2 
HPO 
4 
, 100 mmol/L HEPES). The DNA/CaPO 
4 
 suspen-
sion was added to each fl
 ask and incubated in a 5% CO 
2 
 incubator 
at 37°C overnight. The next morning, the medium was discarded, 
the cells were washed, and 15 mL DMEM with 10% FBS containing 
20 mmol/L HEPES (Invitrogen) and 10 mmol/L sodium butyrate 
(Sigma Aldrich) was added, and the fl
 ask was incubated at 37°C for 8 
to 12 hours. After that, the cells were washed once, and 10 mL fresh 
DMEM medium with 20 mmol/L HEPES was added onto the 293T 
cells, which were further incubated in a 5% CO 
2 incubator at 37°C 
for 12 hours. The medium supernatants were then collected, fi
 ltered 
through 0.2 μmol/L fi
 lters, and cryopreserved at minus 80°C. Virus 
supernatant was added at different concentrations into 6-well plates 
containing 5 × 10 
5 cells per well. Protamine sulphate (Sigma Aldrich) 
was added at a fi
 nal concentration of 5 μg/mL, and the transduction 
plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 
2 
 overnight. 
 
 
Whole-Exome Sequencing 
 
Exon capture and library preparation were performed at the UCLA 
Clinical Microarray Core using the Roche Nimblegen SeqCap EZ 
Human Exome Library v3.0 targeting 65 Mb of genome. Paired-end 
sequencing (2 × 100 bp) was carried out on the HiSeq 2000 platform 
(Illumina) and sequences were aligned to the UCSC hg19 reference 
using BWA-mem (v0.7.9). Sequencing for tumors was performed to 
a target depth of 150× (actual min. 91×, max. 162×, mean 130×). 
Preprocessing followed the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) Best 
Practices Workfl
 ow v3, including duplicate removal (PicardTools), 
indel realignment, and base quality score recalibration. 
 
Somatic mutations were called by comparison to sequencing of 
matched normals for the PD1-treated whole-tumor patient samples. 
Methods were modifi
 ed from ref.  
39 
; specifi
 cally, the substitution the 
GATK-HaplotypeCaller (HC, v3.3) for the Unifi
 edGenotyper. gVCF 
outputs from GATK-HC for all 23 tumor/normal exomes, and cell lines 
M395 and M431, were jointly genotyped and submitted for variant 
quality score recalibration. Somatic variants were determined using 
one-sided Fisher exact test ( 
P 
 value cutoff ≤ 0.01) between tumor/nor-
mal pairs with depth >10 reads. Only high-confi
 dence mutations were 
retained for fi
 nal consideration, defi
 ned as those identifi
 ed by at least 
two out of three programs [MuTect (v1.1.7; ref.  
40 
), Varscan2 Somatic 
(v2.3.6; ref.  
41 
), and the GATK-HC] for single nucleotide variants, 
and those called by both Varscan2 and the GATK-HC for insertions/
deletions. Variants were annotated by Oncotator ( 
42 
), with nonsynony-
mous mutations for mutational load being those classifi
 ed as nonsense, 
missense, splice_site, or nonstop mutations, as well as frame_shift, 
in_frame_, or start_codon altering insertions/deletions. Adjusted vari-
ant allele frequency was calculated according to the following equation: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VAF adjusted = nmut/CNt = VAF∗[1+(2∗Stromal Fraction)/(Tumor 
Fraction*Local Copy Number)] 
 
This is an algebraic rearrangement of the equation used in the clonal 
architecture analysis from McGranaham and colleagues ( 
43 
) to calculate 
the fraction of mutated chromosomal copies while adjusting for the 
diluting contribution of stromal chromosomal copies. Local tumor copy 
number (CN 
t 
,) tumor fraction (purity, or p) and stromal fraction (1 – p) 
were produced by Sequenza ( 
44 
), which uses both depth ratio and SNP 
minor B-allele frequencies to estimate tumor ploidy and percent tumor 
content, and perform allele-specifi
 c copy-number variation analysis. 
 
PDJ amplifi
 cation was considered tumor/normal depth ratio ≥ 2 stan-
dard deviations above length-weighted genome average. BAM fi
 les for 
the 16 colorectal cases were previously mapped to hg18, and sequencing 
and analysis were performed at Personal Genome Diagnostics. After pre-
processing and somatic variant calling, positions were remapped to hg19 
using the Ensembl Assembly Converter before annotation. 
 
M431 and M395 were compared with matched normal samples, 
the other 47 cell lines lacked a paired normal sample. For detection 
of potential  
JAK1 
 or  
JAK2 
 mutations, variants were detected using 
the Haplotype Caller, noted for membership in dbSNP 146 and allele 
frequency from the 1000 Genomes project, and confi
 rmed by visual 
inspection with the Integrated Genomics Viewer. 
 
RT-PCR 
 
Forward 
5′-AACCTTCTCACCAGGATGCG-3′ 
and 
reverse 
5′-CTCAGCACGTACATCCCCTC-3′ primers were designed to per-
form RT-PCR (700 base pair of target PCR product to cover the P429 
region of the JAK1 protein) on the M431 cell line. Total RNA was 
extracted by the  
mir 
Vana miRNA Isolation Kit, with phenols as per 
the manufacturer’
s protocol (Thermo Fischer Scientifi
 c). RT-PCR 
was performed by utilizing ThermoScript RT-PCR Systems (Thermo 
Fisher Scientifi
 c, cat# 11146-057). PCR product was subject to Sanger 
sequencing at the UCLA core facility. 
 
TCGA Analysis 
 
To determine the relevance of  
JAK1 and  
JAK2 alterations in a 
broader set of patients, we queried the TCGA skin cutaneous mela-
noma provisional dataset for the frequency of genetic and expression 
alterations in  
JAK1 
 and  
JAK2 
. We then extended our query to the 
breast invasive carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, lung adenocar-
cinoma, and colorectal adenocarcinoma provisional TCGA datasets. 
We then examined the association of various  
JAK1 and  
JAK2 altera-
tions with overall survival for each dataset. The results are based upon 
data generated by the TCGA Research Network and made available 
through the NCI Genomic Data Commons and cBioPortal ( 
45, 46 
). 
 
The mutation annotation format (MAF) fi
 les containing  
JAK1 
 
and  
JAK2 mutations in the TCGA datasets were obtained from the

Genomic Data Commons. In addition, mutations, putative copy-
number alterations, mRNA expression, protein expression, and sur-
vival data were obtained using the cBioPortal resource. The putative 
copy-number alterations (homodeletion events, in particular) avail-
able in cBioPortal were obtained from the TCGA datasets using 
Genomic Identifi
 cation of Signifi
 cant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC; 
ref. 
 47 
). The mRNA expression data available in cBioPortal were 
obtained from the TCGA datasets using RNA-seq (RNA Seq V2 
RSEM). Upregulation and downregulation of  
JAK1 
 and  
JAK2 
 mRNA 
expression were determined using an mRNA  
z 
-score cutoff of 2.0. 
Protein expression data available in cBioPortal were obtained from 
the TCGA dataset using RPPA, with a  
z 
-score threshold of 2.0. 
 
Mutation data between the MAF fi
 les and data from cBioPortal were 
combined. Genetic and expression alterations were characterized in 
one of six categories: amplifi
 cations, homodeletions, single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms, truncating mutations (stop codons and frameshift 
insertions and deletions), mRNA or protein downregulation, and 
mRNA or protein upregulation. The frequency of  
JAK1 
 and  
JAK2 
 alter-
ations was determined using combined data from the *.MAF fi
 le and 
cBioPortal. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated in R, using 
the “survminer” package and the “ggsurvplot” function. Overall sur-
vival was determined using log-rank analysis. 
 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
Statistical comparisons were performed by the unpaired two-tailed 
Student  
t 
 test (GraphPad Prism, version 6.0 for Windows). Muta-
tional load was compared by unpaired two-sided Mann–Whitney 
test. R programming was utilized to generate arrow graphs of PD-L1/
MHC class I expression upon interferon exposures and the CCLE 
 
JAK1/2 
 mutation frequency graph.
