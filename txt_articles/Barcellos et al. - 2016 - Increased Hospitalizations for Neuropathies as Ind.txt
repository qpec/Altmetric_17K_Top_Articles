 Evidence is increasing that Zika virus can cause extensive 
damage to the central nervous system, affecting both fe-
tuses and adults. We sought to identify traces of possible 
clinical manifestations of nervous system diseases among 
the registers of hospital admissions recorded in the Brazil-
ian Unified Health System. Time series of several diagno-
ses from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision, were analyzed by using control diagrams, during 
January 2008–February 2016. Beginning in mid-2014, we 
observed an unprecedented and significant rise in the hos-
pitalization rate for congenital malformations of the nervous 
system, Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalitis, myelitis, 
and encephalomyelitis. These conditions are compatible 
with viral infection and inflammation-associated manifesta-
tions and may have been due to the entrance of Zika virus 
into Brazil. These findings show the necessity of adequately 
diagnosing and treating suspected cases of Zika virus infec-
tion and also that health surveillance systems can be im-
proved by using routine data.
T
he recent spread of Zika virus across the globe has 
worried citizens and public health authorities. In late 
February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) de-
clared an international state of emergency because of the 
advance of microcephaly associated with the Zika virus (1). 
Previously considered a minor infection with mild symp-
toms and a low mortality rate, infection with Zika virus was 
seen as less severe than that caused by other arboviruses 
transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes, such as den-
gue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses.
However, recent studies have shown that the infec-
tion has a high potential for causing damage to the cen-
tral nervous system (CNS), leading to certain congenital 
malformations (2) and neuropathies, such as Guillain-Barré 
syndrome (GBS) (3–6). The neurotropic nature of the virus 
and its ability to cross the blood-brain and placental barri-
ers (7) were demonstrated in laboratory experiments, and 
damage to developing brains has been shown by imaging of 
fetuses and newborns (8). Other neuropathies may be asso-
ciated with the Zika virus and could have passed unnoticed 
through health information systems.
Some studies suggest that sporting events in 2013 and 
2014 may have led to the introduction of Zika virus into 
Brazil (9). Further spread to other regions might have oc-
curred by 2014. The first warnings of the epidemic in Bra-
zil came on April 20, 2015 (10), with a report about the 
large number of cases of rash of unknown origin, which 
began at the end of December 2014 in various regions of 
the state of Pernambuco, followed by an alert issued by the 
state of Rio Grande do Norte (11). In May 2015, the spread 
of Zika virus among the local populations was laboratory 
confirmed, first in the Pernambuco and Bahia, then in other 
states of the center-west and southeast regions (12). The 
distribution of Zika virus in Brazil during 2014 and 2015 
is summarized in Figure 1, according to case reports and 
epidemiologic data produced by the Federal Ministry of 
Health and state secretaries of health (13).
One strategy for acquiring morbidity data is to analyze 
hospital admission records. The Hospital Information Sys-
tem (SIH, in Portuguese) is primarily financial and admin-
istrative in nature, but it can be used as a data source for 
epidemiologic studies and surveillance because of advan-
tageous characteristics, such as national coverage, relative 
consistency and standardization in terms of data genera-
tion, and rapid production and dissemination of data. These 
features facilitate its incorporation into epidemiologic alert 
systems, especially those for infectious diseases.
An analysis of hospital admissions data can provide 
a baseline that enables identification of trends in the num-
ber of admissions for neuropathies that affect the nervous 
system, as well as inflection points that depart abruptly 
from these trends. Long-term analyses of diseases poten-
tially associated with Zika virus continue to be nonexis-
tent in Brazil and have become urgently needed to bring

into focus the scope of the problem, as well as delineate 
monitoring strategies for the epidemic in Brazil and other 
affected countries.
The main objective of this study was to analyze tem-
poral patterns in hospitalizations in separate Brazilian re-
gions during January 2008–February 2016, for neuropa-
thies, which could have been associated with Zika virus 
infection in separate Brazilian regions. This period in-
cludes the time before the epidemic and the onset of the 
Zika epidemic in Brazil.
Methods
This is a descriptive study of a time series from a popu-
lation dataset. We sought to evaluate historical trends in 
neurologic conditions potentially related to infection with 
Zika virus, based on the principal diagnosis assigned at dis-
charge as the main reason for hospitalization. Data were 
made available by the Informatics Department of the Na-
tional Health System through the Hospital Information 
System during January 1, 2008–February 29, 2016, accord-
ing to each patient’s state of residence.
We selected the health problems analyzed in this study 
on the basis of monitoring protocols put in place to track 
reports of microcephaly related to infection with Zika virus 
(14) and track neurologic conditions for which the patient 
had a history of previous viral infection (15). We consid-
ered all hospital admissions for the following: 1) congenital 
malformations of the nervous system (International Clas-
sification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] Q00-Q07) 
in children <1 year of age, 2) GBS  (ICD-10 G610; 3) 
other potential and unspecific clinical manifestations such 
as encephalitis, myelitis, and encephalomyelitis (ICD-10 
G040-G049); 4) abortion and related problems (ICD-10 
O03-O07); in particular, 5) spontaneous abortion (ICD-10 
O03). In Brazil, abortion is permitted in cases of risk to the 
mother and fetus, as well as in cases of sexual violence. 
Other cases of induced abortion are attended to in hospitals 
when the woman initiates an abortion, when an incomplete 
abortion leads to complications, or in cases of hemorrhage 
or infection (16).
Time series were assembled by using aggregate data 
tabulated by month and region. Because the Northeast re-
gion was, until the end of 2015, the center of the Zika out-
break and of the surge in microcephaly cases, we analyzed 
this region and compared the results with those from the 
other Brazilian regions in aggregate. We calculated crude 
hospital admission rates for each month of the study using 
population estimates provided by the Brazilian Geogra-
phy and Statistics Institute (Brazil). With respect to con-
genital malformations of the nervous system in children 
<1 year of age, we calculated the rate of hospitalizations 
using the number of live births per month as the denomi-
nator. In the case of abortion, we obtained the rate of hos-
pitalizations using the number of live births per month as 
the denominator with a lag of 7 months, which reduced 
the effect of seasonality so common in data for births as 
well as for abortions.
The total number of hospitalizations can vary greatly 
by state due to variations in staffing at the local level and 
disparities in access to services for utilizers of the public 
health system (17). To control for the effect of the capac-
ity of health services to provide hospital beds, we used the 
same techniques and parameters for the analysis of the gen-
eral causes of hospitalizations, which include admissions 
for malformations among newborns (ICD-10, Chapter 
XVII: Congenital Malformations, Deformities and Chro-
mosomal Anomalies) and all admissions for nervous sys-
tem diseases (ICD-10, Chapter VI).

 Hospitalizations for Neuropathies and Zika Virus Infection
 We compared the monthly hospitalization rates of 
the Northeast region with rates in non-Northeast Brazil-
ian regions, added to a 95% CIs (1.96-fold SDs from the 
mean) as upper limits for detection of peaks in the time 
series. These data were plotted as control charts, which al-
lowed for evaluation of long-term trends, seasonality, and 
anomalies in the series by visual inspection. We tested the 
difference between observed and expected number of hos-
pitalization—assuming the historical baseline as a control 
parameter—by calculating the rate ratio (IRR) and CI using 
Poisson regression.
Results
The rate of hospitalizations for congenital malformations 
of the nervous system (ICD-10 Q00-Q07) presented a sta-
ble mean value of 40/100,000 live births in the Northeast 
region until September 2015. As of November 2015, how-
ever, we observed an increase in this rate, which, in the 
last months of the series, reached a mean value of 170 hos-
pitalizations for congenital malformations of the nervous 
system per 100,000 live births, an increase ≈4 times higher 
than historical rates (IRR 4.2; 95% CI 3.8–4.6). In Febru-
ary 2016, all regions exhibited rates of ≈100 hospitaliza-
tions for congenital malformations of the nervous system 
per 100,000 live births, a 2-fold increase over the national 
historical baseline. From November 2015 through Febru-
ary 2016, a total of 1,027 hospitalizations for congenital 
malformations of the nervous system were recorded nation-
wide; 448 of these occurred in the Northeast region. This 
region is responsible for ≈830,000 (28%) of the overall an-
nual live births in Brazil.
In the Northeast region, the hospitalization rate for 
GBS (ICD-10 G610) was 0.05/100,000 residents until May 
2015, when an outbreak occurred, which peaked in July 
2015. From June 2015 through February 2016, the hos-
pitalization rate was 0.11/100,000 residents, an increase 
by a factor of 2.7 (95% CI 2.5–3.0). During July through 
October 2015, 377 GBS hospitalizations were recorded in 
the Northeast region, an excess of ≈240 hospitalizations in 
the region.
The hospitalization rate for CNS inflammatory diseas-
es, represented by encephalitis, myelitis, and encephalo-
myelitis (ICD-10 G040-G049), increased in the Northeast 
region, principally as of September 2014, from a baseline 
of 0.05 hospitalizations/100 residents to 0.11 hospitaliza-
tions/100,000 residents (IRR 2.0; 95% CI 1.9–2.2). In the 
rest of the country, a stable base line of 0.05 hospitaliza-
tions/100,000 residents was observed. From September 
2014 through February 2016, hospitalizations for encepha-
litis, myelitis, and encephalomyelitis in the Northeast re-
gion reached 1,115, an excess of ≈570 hospitalizations.
Figure 2 shows the evolution during 2008–2016 of the 
rate of congenital malformations of the nervous system in 
children <1 year of age (per 100,000 live births) and of the 
rates of hospitalization (per 100,000 residents) for GBS and 
encephalitis, myelitis, and encephalomyelitis in the North-
east region compared with rates in the rest of the country. 
Figure 2, panel A, shows the abrupt increase in hospital-
ization rates for congenital malformations of the nervous 
system among children <1 year of age as of October 2015 
in the Northeast region. Meanwhile, the rest of the country 
exhibited a slight increase in these same rates. Some peaks 
of hospitalizations can be seen in August 2014 and Febru-
ary 2015, when the rate observed in the Northeast region 
surpasses the CI for the rate in the rest of the country.
With respect to GBS (Figure 2, panel B), hospital-
izations peaked sharply during June–August 2015 in the 
Northeast region. In a more detailed analysis, we identi-
fied the first peak of GBS in Pernambuco State during May 
2015, followed by the states of Ceará, Bahia, and Alagoas 
in the subsequent months. This trajectory is consistent with 
the early reports of Zika and rash epidemic epidemiologic 
alerts (11,12).
A historical series of the rates of hospitalization for 
inflammatory diseases of the CNS, represented by enceph-
alitis, myelitis, and encephalomyelitis, shows a pattern 
change in recent years (Figure 2, panel C). Until 2013, the 
rates of the series in the Northeast region varied within the 
range of the rest of Brazil. By the end of 2014, the North-
east region showed an increase in relation to the rest of the 
country, with values above the CIs for the series for the 
rest of Brazil. In mid-2015, the number of hospitalizations 
peaks again during August–October. This pattern suggests 
a more accentuated annual cycle, showing peaks during the 
second semester of the 2014 and 2015.
We did not observe changes for abortions and related 
problems in the times series, including for spontaneous 
abortions (results not shown). We also did not observe 
changes in the total number of hospitalizations or in hospi-
talizations for nervous system problems (ICD-10, Chapter 
VI) in the regions during the study period. This pattern may 
demonstrate the stability of the health system in terms of 
specialty beds, especially for neurology.
Discussion
In this study, we analyzed time trends for hospitalizations 
for some neuropathies. We found increases in the number 
of hospitalizations for congenital malformations of the 
nervous system, GBS, and some inflammatory diseases of 
the CNS. These complications began to cause more hos-
pitalizations, with strong fluctuations over the course of 
the study period, beginning even before the first warning 
in November 2015 about the possible effects of infection 
with Zika virus on microcephaly and other malformations. 
These shifts from the previous baseline were not, therefore, 
influenced by new procedures and norms that have been

 Hospitalizations for Neuropathies and Zika Virus Infection
incorporated into the health system over the last months. 
As such, the complications that we present here can be 
thought of as early signals of neurologic complications that 
were unperceived through health surveillance systems, but 
that may be related to the entrance and circulation of the 
Zika virus in Brazil, especially in the Northeast region.
Our results show that the rates of hospitalization in 
the Northeast region for some neuropathies were subject 
to abrupt changes beginning in mid-2014, when it is be-
lieved that Zika virus was introduced to the country (9) 
(and later produced outbreaks in 2015). Conversely, the 
onset of hospitalizations for congenital malformations of 
the nervous system observed in November 2015 may be a 
result of the first public health warnings about Zika-related 
 
microcephaly, issued in the same month. Taking into 
consideration the fact that CNS malformations originate, 
typically, in the first 3 months of gestation (18), infection 
may have occurred in mid-2015, which coincides with the 
observed peaks of GBS and CNS inflammatory diseases. 
The hospitalization rates have slightly increased national-
ly during the first months of 2016, probably in reaction to 
warnings about microcephaly and the ensuing necessity to 
keep neonates hospitalized to investigate potential cases.
With respect to problems related to abortion, includ-
ing spontaneous abortion, hospitalizations rates remained 
stable over the study period. We expected an increase in the 
number of abortions and related problems, especially spon-
taneous abortions, which can occur in cases of serious con-
genital abnormalities (19). Equally, public health warnings 
about the surge in microcephaly cases may have provoked 
an increase in the number of induced abortions. In Brazil, 
legislation permits abortion in cases of risk to the mother and 
fetus, or in cases of sexual violence, but studies have shown 
that health information systems substantially underestimate 
abortion, and also document bureaucratic delays of health 
systems in performing legal abortions (16). The possibility 
of an increase in the number abortions and related complica-
tions in the coming months should not be discounted.
The concentration of neuropathies in the Northeast 
states remains a mystery for researchers and health surveil-
lance services. First, we can assume that the virus entered 
Brazil mainly in this region (12,20) and that, with the spread 
of the epidemic to other regions, the number of cases of 
neuropathies will increase in the rest of the country. On the 
other hand, the theory persists that other risk factors, such 
as chronic diseases (21) and co-infections (22,23), might 
interact with and potentiate neurologic manifestations in 
persons infected with Zika virus. The region had one of the 
worst droughts in its history during 2010–2013, resulting 
in contamination of drinking water, food insecurity (24), 
and outbreaks of diarrhea across the region (25), which 
could have affected the immunity status of the population. 
In addition, concomitant outbreaks of Zika virus infection 
and dengue, as was observed in French Polynesia (26) and 
in northeast region of Brazil, could potentiate the neuro-
logic effects of infection with Zika virus. Chikungunya 
virus was also circulating in the region during 2014 and 
2015, although in more restricted areas (Figure 1) and with 
less magnitude, and it can also produce severe neurologic 
complications such as GBS (27).
Another issue is the higher rate of hospitalizations 
during the winter months (June–September), when in gen-
eral the incidence of vector-transmitted diseases, such as 
dengue, is lower because of milder temperatures (28). In 
this case, we can presume a latency period between infec-
tion with the Zika virus and hospitalization for neurologic 
complications. A study carried out in Salvador, a chief

Diseases, 10th Revision, January 2008 through February 2016.

 city in the Northeast region, demonstrated a lag of 5–9 
weeks (mean 2 months) between the Zika virus epidemic 
and cases of GBS (29). Another hypothesis is that trans-
mission of the virus persists beyond seasonal limits, due 
to other means of transmission, such as through sexual 
contact (30).
Our study has certain limitations. First, a detection bias 
could exist (i.e.,  the alerts about the Zika epidemic could 
have led to greater rigor on the part of health services to di-
agnose and register the neuropathies and congenital abnor-
malities we have examined, which would result in overesti-
mation of hospitalization rates). However, because the first 
alerts about microcephaly related to Zika virus infections 
were issued in November 2015, and only in February 2016 
did WHO declare a public health emergency, the previous 
months’ records may have not been affected by health sur-
veillance guidelines, with the exception of microcephaly.
A second limitation concerns the fact that the health 
information system for hospitalizations registers events 
and not individual patients. As such, rehospitalizations can 
be contained within that figure, leading to overestimation 
of hospitalization rates. These 2 limitations likely do not 
substantially affect the results of this study because they 
would have had to occur uniformly across the nation in the 
period studied.
This study can contribute to a greater understanding 
of the Zika epidemic in Brazil and its additional effect on 
certain neuropathies. The data sources and methods we 
used in this study can be used for monitoring and warning 
systems in cases of emergency.  Implementation would re-
quire obtaining and statistically analyzing time series data, 
to establish a baseline of adverse events and identify peaks 
that could represent outbreaks of disease.
To monitor the effects of Zika virus, public health re-
searchers must consider its various clinical manifestations 
that may be registered in different ICD codes, even in dis-
persed chapters, such as viral encephalitis (ICD-10 A83) 
and provisional code (ICD-10 U06), as recommended by 
WHO. The hospital routine may account for the diversity 
of codes used to describe complications derived from Zika 
virus. The admission of a patient to the hospital is first justi-
fied by a preliminary ICD code. Throughout the period of 
hospitalization, new examinations and procedures are car-
ried out, which can alter this classification. At the end of 
hospitalization period, a code for the principal diagnosis is 
assigned to the outpatient, based on procedures performed 
and their costs, which is not necessarily related to the dis-
ease etiology. A wide range of ICD codes should be taken 
into account in this situation, with anticipation of all pos-
sible reasons for hospital admission potentially related to 
Zika complications.
New detection tools for outbreaks and means of com-
municating warnings should be pursued to identify real 
trends and, at the same time, minimize false alarms and 
panic that could be provoked in populations potentially af-
fected by the Zika epidemic. The history of neuropathies 
caused by viruses is about to change, not only because of 
the effects that Zika virus has been found to have on the 
CNS, but also because of the effort of gathering evidence 
that will help construct this history.
