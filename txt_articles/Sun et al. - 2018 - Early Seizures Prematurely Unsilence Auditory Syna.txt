SUMMARY
Heightened neural excitability in infancy and child-
hood results in increased susceptibility to seizures.
Such early-life seizures are associated with language
deficits and autism that can result from aberrant
development of the auditory cortex. Here, we show
that early-life seizures disrupt a critical period (CP)
for tonotopic map plasticity in primary auditory cor-
tex (A1). We show that this CP is characterized by a
prevalence of ‘‘silent,’’ NMDA-receptor (NMDAR)-
only, glutamate receptor synapses in auditory cortex
that become ‘‘unsilenced’’ due to activity-dependent
AMPA receptor (AMPAR) insertion. Induction of sei-
zures prior to this CP occludes tonotopic map
plasticity by prematurely unsilencing NMDAR-only
synapses. Further, brief treatment with the AMPAR
antagonist NBQX following seizures, prior to the
CP, prevents synapse unsilencing and permits sub-
sequent A1 plasticity. These findings reveal that
early-life seizures modify CP regulators and suggest
that therapeutic targets for early post-seizure treat-
ment can rescue CP plasticity.
INTRODUCTION
Up to 40% of children with autism and intellectual disability also
suffer from epilepsy, and approximately 35% of children with
infantile spasms develop long-term intellectual disabilities,
including autism (Spence and Schneider, 2009; Tuchman,
2015). While there are multiple autism-linked genes that asso-
ciate highly with epilepsy, these two disorders may also be
co-acquired as a result of early-life brain injury and seizures
(Froehlich-Santino et al., 2014; Jensen, 2011).
Children with intellectual disorders related to early-life epi-
lepsy and autism often show impaired acoustic temporal and
phonological processing that may contribute to later language
deficits (Amaral et al., 2015; Matsuzaki et al., 2012; Oram Cardy
et al., 2005). Such auditory encoding abnormalities in children
with autism are linked to perturbed development of auditory cor-
tex (Edgar et al., 2015). Mouse models of autism also show
impaired auditory cortical development, particularly during the
critical period (CP) for tonotopic plasticity (Engineer et al.,
2014; Rotschafer and Razak, 2013; Kim et al., 2013).
Early postnatal development is characterized by a series of
CPs for enhanced synaptic plasticity and learning, reflecting dy-
namic changes in excitatory and inhibitory circuits (Takesian and
Hensch, 2013). An untoward result is a heightened susceptibility
to seizures (Rakhade and Jensen, 2009) that can lead to long-
term learning deficits, including autistic-like social behavior (Ber-
nard and Benke, 2015; Lippman-Bell et al., 2013; Talos et al.,
2012). The extreme levels of synaptic activity during early-life
seizures may co-opt plasticity mechanisms (Rakhade et al.,
2008) required for later experience-dependent CP plasticity
modifications of cortical representations (Hensch, 2004). How-
ever, the manner in which early-life seizures may interfere with
cortical development to impact plasticity during CPs, such as
the reorganization of auditory cortical maps, remains largely un-
explored. Understanding the precise synaptic changes following
seizures may allow us to identify treatments to reverse the
sequelae underlying long-term deficits in auditory processing
and learning.
Experience-dependent plasticity during CPs has been well
characterized in sensory areas (Hensch, 2004), such as primary
visual or auditory cortex (A1). During a finite 3-day CP for tono-
topic plasticity, passive tone exposure leads to an expanded
representation of that tone by altering auditory thalamocortical
connectivity (Barkat et al., 2011; de Villers-Sidani et al., 2007;
Insanally et al., 2009). Here, we examined how tonotopic map
plasticity in A1 may be influenced in a rodent model of early-
life seizures to elucidate the common comorbidity of early-life
epilepsy and auditory deficits (Amaral et al., 2015; Riva et al.,
2007).
We show that a postnatal maturational switch from function-
ally ‘‘silent’’ thalamocortical synapses containing only NMDA
receptors (NMDARs) to ‘‘unsilent’’ synapses containing both

 NMDARs and AMPA receptors (AMPARs) underlies CP tono-
topic map plasticity in A1. Early-life seizures occlude this CP
tonotopic plasticity by a premature unsilencing of both thalamo-
cortical and intracortical synapses. Importantly, brief treatment
with the AMPAR antagonist NBQX following seizures prevented
this premature unsilencing of synapses and rescued CP plas-
ticity, providing proof of principle for interventional therapies in
early life.
RESULTS
Early-Life Seizures Disrupt Tonotopic Map Plasticity in
A1 during an Auditory CP
The brief CP for A1 tonotopic map plasticity in mice begins on
postnatal day (P) 12 and ends at P15 (Barkat et al., 2011). We
induced generalized seizures prior to this CP onset with daily in-
jections of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally
[i.p.]) from P9 to P11 (Rakhade et al., 2012). Following this period
of acute seizures, we then exposed these mice to 7 kHz tones
during the expected CP (P12–P15) (Figure 1A; Barkat et al.,
2011).
The impact of seizures on tonotopic plasticity can be screened
rapidly and reliably by mapping topography in peri-horizontal sli-
ces preserving the thalamocortical projection using voltage-sen-
sitive dye (VSD) imaging (Barkat et al., 2011; Hackett et al., 2011).
In slices from naive mice, electrical stimulation along the tono-
topic axis of the auditory thalamus (the ventral division of the
medial geniculate body; MGBv) produces a caudal-to-rostral
shift in maximal VSD activity along the A1 tonotopic axis (Figures
1B and 1C). The degree of orderly topography was quantified as
the linear relationship between the location of the maximal VSD
response (DF/F) within cortical layer IV (L4) along the caudo-
rostral axis of A1 and the MGBv stimulation site (‘‘topographic
slope’’; Figure 1D).
Consistent with previous observations (Barkat et al., 2011),
passive 7 kHz tone exposure during P12–P15 elicited large-scale
shifts in the thalamocortical organization of A1 in saline-injected
mice, reflected by a significant decrease of the topographic slope
compared to saline-injected naive mice (Figures 1D and 1E; naive
saline: 1.26 ± 0.18, n = 15 mice; tone-exposed saline: 0.46 ±
0.13, n = 22 mice; p = 0.0008, unpaired t test, two-tailed, equal
variance). However, in littermate mice that had been injected
with PTZ to induce seizures at P9–P11, this plasticity was signif-
icantly reduced (Figures 1D and 1E; topographic slope for tone-
exposed saline versus tone-exposed PTZ = 0.92 ± 0.18, n = 16
mice; p = 0.04, unpaired t test, two-tailed, equal variance; for
naive PTZ versus tone-exposed PTZ, p = 0.25, unpaired t test,
two-tailed, unequal variance). To rule out an effect of seizures
on thalamocortical topography under baseline acoustic condi-
tions, naive mice were raised in a standard acoustic environment
after PTZ-induced seizures. These mice showed similar thalamo-
cortical topography to naive littermate controls injected with sa-
line (no seizures), as evidenced by no significant difference in the
slope of the topographic curves (Figures 1D and 1E; naive saline
versus naive PTZ = 1.17 ± 0.11, n = 15 mice; unpaired t test, two-
tailed, equal variance, p = 0.66). Taken together, these results
suggest that seizure activity prior to the onset of the CP impairs
subsequent tonotopic map plasticity in A1.

 Maturation of Silent Synapses Corresponds to the CP for
Tonotopy
To determine whether glutamatergic synapses are altered by
early-life seizures, we first examined the normal maturational
changes in NMDARs and AMPARs during the CP. A unique
feature of the immature brain is that many excitatory synapses
contain only NMDARs, which are functionally ‘‘silent’’ due to
Mg2+ blockade at resting membrane potentials (Hanse et al.,
2013; Kerchner and Nicoll, 2008).
The proportion of silent, NMDAR-only synapses to those unsi-
lenced synapses also containing AMPARs can be determined by
the difference of failure rates in thalamus-evoked excitatory
postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) at negative (�60 mV) and
positive (+40 mV) membrane potentials (Figures 2A and 2D–
2G). At �60 mV, EPSCs are mediated only by AMPARs, but
at +40 mV, EPSCs are mediated by both AMPARs and NMDARs.
To calculate the silent synapse ratio for each cell, we first set the
baseline failure rate by initially adjusting the stimulus intensity to
evoke synaptic responses with an �50% failure rate at a holding
potential of �60 mV, and then we raised the holding potential
to +40 mV (Liao et al., 1995).
In thalamocortical slices from normal P12–P15 mice, L4 pyra-
midal neurons in A1 exhibited a failure rate change from 52.39 ±
3.85% at �60 mV to 21.54 ± 3.75% at +40 mV (stimulation inten-
sity, 42.78 ± 7.69 mA; n = 10 cells, 6 slices from 6 mice; p < 0.001,
paired t test; Figures 2B and 2H), yielding a difference of 30.85 ±
4.04%. These data suggest a prevalence of NMDAR-only, silent
synapses. However, in normal mice at P16–P21, a significantly
smaller change in failure rate (2.03 ± 2.48%; p < 0.05, unpaired
t test, two-tailed, equal variance, versus that for P12–P15) was
observed (47.90 ± 3.71% at �60 mV, and 45.87 ± 4.56%
at +40 mV; stimulation intensity, 37.78 ± 6.75 mA; n = 10 cells,
5 slices from 5 mice; p = 0.43, paired t test; Figures 2C and 2I),
suggesting that silent synapses dramatically decrease following
the CP in normal mouse A1. The fraction of silent synapses
showed a significant decline at P16–P21 (3.45 ± 7.70%; n =
10 cells, 5 slices from 5 mice) from the peak tonotopic plastic win-
dow (P12–P15, 57.23 ± 5.15%; n = 10 cells, 6 slices from 6 mice;
p < 0.001, unpaired t test, two-tailed, equal variance; Figures 2J
and 2K). These data reveal that, in normal mice, the availability of
silent synapses is heightened during the auditory CP for A1 tono-
topic map plasticity.
Premature Synapse Unsilencing Underlies the
Disruption of Auditory CP Plasticity
Since there is overlap in the availability of NMDAR-only silent
synapses in L4 and the previously delineated CP timing (Barkat
et al., 2011), we asked whether premature unsilencing could ac-
count for seizure-induced disruption of tonotopic map plasticity
in L4. We induced seizures in mice at P9–P11 with daily injec-
tions of PTZ and then measured excitatory synaptic function
at P12–P15 using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in L4
pyramidal cells. Indeed, following daily PTZ seizures, mice
showed a significant increase in amplitude of AMPAR-mediated

 spontaneous EPSCs (13.62 ± 0.82 pA; n = 10 cells, 6 slices from
6 mice; p < 0.001, unpaired t test, two-tailed, equal variance) as
compared to controls (10.17 ± 0.40 pA; n = 13 cells, 8 slices from
8 mice; Figures 3A–3C), while these events occurred at compa-
rable frequencies (0.49 ± 0.10 Hz and 0.41 ± 0.07 Hz, respec-
tively; p = 0.48, unpaired t test, two-tailed, equal variance; Fig-
ures 3A, 3D). Consistent with the enhanced AMPAR-mediated
sEPSCs, miniature AMPAR-mediated EPSCs also showed a
significantly increased amplitude in slices from post-seizure
mice (12.07 ± 0.34 pA; n = 10 cells, 5 slices from 5 mice) as
compared with controls (10.52 ± 0.39 pA; n = 9 cells, 5 slices
from 5 mice; p = 0.008, unpaired t test, two-tailed, equal vari-
ance; Figure S1).
To further investigate the contribution of postsynaptic recep-
tors in the seizure-induced AMPAR functional enhancement,
we measured minimally evoked AMPAR-mediated EPSCs by
directly stimulating MGBv thalamocortical fibers at P12 (Chan-
drasekaran et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2011). We found that minimal
single-fiber stimulation successfully evoked larger AMPAR-
mediated eEPSCs in post-seizure mice (17.97 ± 1.61 pA,
n = 10 PTZ cells, 6 slices from 6 mice, versus 12.97 ± 1.01 pA,
n = 10 control cells, 6 slices from 6 mice; p = 0.017, unpaired
t test, two-tailed, equal variance; Figures 3E–3G). Thus, early-
life seizures are associated with premature enhancement of
baseline AMPAR function.
We next determined whether the AMPAR enhancement was
associated with changes in the fraction of silent NMDAR-only
synapses following seizures. As described earlier, age-matched
P12–P13 controls were stimulated to produce a failure rate of
51.21 ± 4.35% at �60 mV and exhibited 17.94 ± 2.05% failures

 at +40 mV (stimulation intensity, 43.50 ± 9.12 mA; n = 8 cells, 5 sli-
ces from 5 mice; Figures 3H and 3I), yielding a difference of
33.27 ± 3.62% (Figure 3L). However, in post-seizure mice, L4 py-
ramidal cells exhibited an attenuated change in failure rate at
P12–P13 from an initial level of 52.58 ± 4.14% at �60 mV to
43.66 ± 2.65% at +40 mV (stimulation intensity, 39.25 ±
9.06 mA; n = 8 cells, 5 slices from 5 mice; Figures 3J and 3K),
yielding a difference of 8.92 ± 2.66% that was significantly
smaller than that observed in controls (p = 0.004, unpaired
t test, two-tailed, equal variance) (Figure 3L). Further, a smaller
fraction of silent synapses post-PTZ (21.77 ± 6.61% versus
60.71 ± 4.32% in controls; p < 0.001, unpaired t test, two-tailed,
equal variance) suggests that early seizures unsilence NMDAR-
only thalamocortical synapses (Figure 3M).
In addition to thalamic inputs, L4 pyramidal neurons in A1 also
receive strong intracortical excitatory inputs from L6 (Kratz and
Manis, 2015; Lee and Sherman, 2009). Following seizures, intra-
cortical minimally evoked AMPAR-mediated EPSCs, elicited by
stimulating intracortical L6 to L4 projection fibers, were larger
compared with controls (18.68 ± 1.60 pA, n = 10 PTZ cells,
6 slices from 6 mice, versus 13.07 ± 0.92 pA, n = 9 control cells,
6 slices from 6 mice; p = 0.005, unpaired t test, two-tailed, equal
variance; Figures S2A–S2D). Furthermore, age-matched con-
trols exhibited a failure rate decrease from the initial 51.70 ±
2.66% at �60 mV to 22.18 ± 1.93% at +40 mV (stimulation inten-
sity, 35.11 ± 6.32 mA; n = 9 cells, 6 slices from 6 mice; Figures
S2E and S2G), yielding a difference of 29.52 ± 3.37% (Figure S2I).
However, post-seizure mice exhibited a significantly smaller fail-
ure rate change from 48.90 ± 3.32% at �60 mV to 43.38 ± 2.40%
at +40 mV at P12–P13 (stimulation intensity, 31.20 ± 6.61 mA; n =
10 cells, 6 slices from 6 mice; Figures S2F and S2H), yielding a
difference of only 5.52 ± 2.10% that was significantly smaller
than that observed in controls (p < 0.001, unpaired t test, two-
tailed, equal variance; Figure S2I). This was confirmed by a
smaller fraction of silent synapses post-PTZ (13.62 ± 5.55%
versus 55.02 ± 4.80% in controls; unpaired t test, two-tailed,
equal variance, p < 0.001; Figure S2J).
Taken together, our data reveal that early-life seizures prema-
turely diminish NMDAR-only silent synapses, regardless of input
source. This seizure effect occludes the CP for tonotopic map
plasticity in L4 of A1, which is normally associated with a conver-
sion of silent NMDAR-only synapses to those containing both
NMDARs and AMPARs.
AMPAR Antagonist Treatment Rescues Auditory CP
Plasticity by Preventing Premature Synapse Unsilencing
Transient inactivation of AMPARs has been previously found to
prevent acute and long-term seizure-induced changes in hippo-
campal neurons (Lippman-Bell et al., 2016; Rakhade et al., 2008;
Zhou et al., 2011). Thus, we asked whether post-seizure treat-
ment of the AMPAR antagonist NBQX restores proper CP plas-
ticity by preventing the premature unsilencing of NMDAR-only
synapses.
P9–P11 mouse pups were injected daily with PTZ (50 mg/kg)
to induce seizures, followed 1 hr later by either saline or NBQX
(20 mg/kg, i.p.). The pups were subsequently exposed to
7 kHz tones during the CP for tonotopic plasticity (P12–P15).
The mice injected only with saline following seizures showed
impaired tonotopic plasticity, consistent with our previous
observation (Figure 4A; topographic slope, PTZ + saline =
1.34 ± 0.25, n = 9 mice). Importantly, plasticity was rescued in lit-
termates injected with NBQX following seizures, as evidenced by
a significant decrease in the slope of the topographic curves
(Figure 4A; topographic slope, PTZ + saline versus PTZ +
NBQX = 0.58 ± 0.18, n = 13 mice; p = 0.03, Mann-Whitney U
test, two-tailed).
Consistent with the rescued plasticity, NBQX treatment
reduced seizure-induced AMPAR enhancement and premature
unsilencing of NMDAR-only synapses. NBQX prevented the in-
crease in amplitude of AMPAR-mediated sEPSCs observed in
L4 pyramidal cells at P12–P15 following PTZ (Figures 4B–4E)
(percent change in sEPSC amplitude versus saline control, con-
trol: 100 ± 3.63%, n = 11 cells, 4 slices from 4 mice; PTZ + saline:
138.21 ± 8.41%, n = 14 cells, 5 slices from 5 mice; PTZ + NBQX:
99.49 ± 4.55%, n = 10 cells, 4 slices from 4 mice; p = 0.0015,
one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction, PTZ + saline
versus PTZ + NBQX). Furthermore, calculated fractions of silent
synapses revealed that NBQX treatment reduced the premature
unsilencing of thalamocortical synapses following PTZ-induced
seizures (Figures 4F–4J) (control: 64.63 ± 3.66%, n = 8 cells,
4 slices from 4 mice; PTZ + saline: 17.87 ± 4.91%, n = 12 cells,
5 slices from 5 mice; PTZ + NBQX: 59.27 ± 5.53%, n = 10 cells,
4 slices from 4 mice; p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni correction, PTZ + saline versus PTZ + NBQX). Thus,
NBQX treatment may rescue tonotopic CP plasticity following
seizures by preventing the accelerated maturation of A1 excit-
atory synapses.
DISCUSSION
Neonatal and childhood seizures are often comorbid with autism
and intellectual disability (Spence and Schneider, 2009; Tuch-
man, 2015), yet it is unclear whether the seizures contribute to
these developmental disorders. Early postnatal development is
characterized by an enhanced excitatory neurotransmission
that is necessary for activity-dependent synaptogenesis and
synaptic plasticity (Ebert and Greenberg, 2013; Rakhade and
Jensen, 2009) but can also lead to increased susceptibility to
epileptic seizures (Jensen, 2009). Such seizures impair later syn-
aptic plasticity, learning, and cognition (Bernard and Benke,
2015; Holmes and Ben-Ari, 2007). How seizures may affect
intervening critical period windows of development remains
unknown.
Neural circuit refinement through early life experience is
important for normal sensory processing. A key feature of
many maturing networks during early postnatal brain develop-
ment is the gradual conversion of silent to active synapses
(Hanse et al., 2013). Long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of
synaptic plasticity, involves the trafficking of AMPARs into
NMDAR-only synapses by calcium-dependent post-transla-
tional modifications of AMPAR subunits (Huganir and Nicoll,
2013). We had previously shown that seizure activity in vitro

 NMDAR-only silent synapses and occlude a CP for auditory cir-
cuit refinement, which may contribute to long-term deficits in
auditory function.
PTZ may potentiate 2- to 4-Hz spike-wave discharges that are
thought to reflect oscillations generated from dysfunctional tha-
lamocortical circuits (Marescaux et al., 1984) but can also induce
limbic seizures (Reddy et al., 2018). Importantly, altered activity
of thalamocortical networks may also underlie limbic seizures
and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (Guye et al., 2006; He et al.,
2017). Future studies will determine whether our findings gener-
alize across various forms of epilepsy, including TLE, associated
with neurodevelopmental disorders.
Importantly, we show that early intervention following seizures
with the AMPAR antagonist NBQX preserves the silent synapse
fraction and prevents the subsequent impairment of CP plas-
ticity. A key feature of unsilencing is the insertion of AMPARs
into NMDAR-only synapses. Neonatal seizures robustly increase
PSD-95 expression (Rakhade et al., 2012), and PSD-95 pro-
motes the functional maturation of AMPAR synapses in the vi-
sual cortex linked to the end of a CP for ocular dominance plas-
ticity (Huang et al., 2015). Likewise, accelerated structural
maturation of thalamo-recipient short stubby spines by genetic
disruption of a synaptic cell-adhesion molecule shortens the
CP in A1 (Barkat et al., 2011). The rapid strengthening of excit-
atory synapses following seizures may exacerbate the network
hyperexcitability in response to subsequent epileptic triggers. In-
terventions are thus required to prevent this sequela. The half-life
of NBQX is about 1 hr (Chizh et al., 1994), and we have shown
there is no residual effect of prior NBQX treatment on AMPAR
currents in controls at 24 hr after seizures (Rakhade et al.,
2008). The NBQX treatment may act through both short- and
longer-term mechanisms, preventing acute synaptic changes af-
ter a single seizure episode and protecting against AMPAR-
driven hyperexcitability during subsequent seizures. Thus, our
study identifies the AMPARs as one key therapeutic target to
recover proper excitatory synapse development in A1 in order
to curtail later impairments in auditory plasticity.
The rescue of an auditory CP by the AMPAR antagonist
NBQX is proof-of-principle that plasticity is a dynamic target
for therapeutic manipulation. Transient inactivation of AMPARs
following early-life seizures may be a promising strategy to
attenuate the premature unsilencing of cortical excitatory syn-
apses, allowing for the expression of CP plasticity that under-
lies normal auditory and social development. Indeed, brief
NBQX treatments prevent deficits in social behavior observed
in juvenile rats following neonatal seizures (Lippman-Bell
et al., 2013). Understanding how early-life manipulations of
silent synapses impact developmental plasticity will provide
important insight into the etiology and treatment of neurodeve-
lopmental disorders.
Figure 4. NBQX Rescues Auditory CP Plasticity following Early-Life Seizures by Preventing Premature Synapse Unsilencing
(A) Top: experimental strategy to evaluate the effects of NBQX treatment on seizure-induced impairment of auditory CP plasticity. P9–P11 mice were injected
daily with PTZ (50 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by saline or NBQX (20 mg/kg, i.p.) at 1 hr post-seizures and then were exposed to pulsed 7 kHz tone pips during a CP for
tonotopic plasticity (P12–P15). Tone-evoked changes in thalamocortical topography were assessed using in vitro VSD imaging at P15. Bottom: topographic
slopes (*p < 0.05).

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Male and female C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) at P9–P25 were
used for all experiments. All animal care protocols and procedures were
approved by and in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and
Use Committee at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA), Boston
Children’s Hospital (Boston, MA), and Carleton University (Ottawa, ON). All ef-
forts were made to minimize animal suffering and the number of animals used.
Early-Life Seizure Induction
Early-life seizures were induced by daily PTZ injections (50 mg/kg, i.p.) for
3 days from P9 to P11 prior to CP onset. PTZ acts mostly by blocking
GABAA receptors via the t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) site (Olsen,
1981), while additional action of increasing sodium and calcium influx through
Ca2+ channels has been reported (Papp et al., 1987). PTZ reliably causes spike
and wave epileptic activity (Sierra-Paredes et al., 1989) and acute behavioral
seizures in rodents (Rakhade et al., 2012). Only mice showing typical seizures,
including repeated rearing, myoclonic jerks, forelimb clonus, or loss of posture
and tonic-clonic movements were included for further examination. In some
experiments, behavioral seizures after PTZ injection were videotaped and
characterized. A single episode of seizures induced by one dose of PTZ
(50 mg/kg, i.p.) showed a latency of 6.90 ± 1.10 min and an accumulated dura-
tion of 2.32 ± 0.45 min (n = 22). Age-matched littermates injected with the
same amount of saline were used as controls. We found no significant differ-
ences in the body weights of the PTZ- versus saline-injected mouse pups
when examined at P15 (saline, 7.12 ± 0.16 g, n = 37 mice; PTZ, 7.00 ±
0.15 g, n = 31 mice; p = 0.57).
In Vitro VSD Imaging
The mouse brain was quickly removed and sectioned peri-horizontally
(600 mm, 15�) to preserve the MGBv and its projection to A1 (Cruikshank
et al., 2002). Changes in thalamocortical topography were evaluated in vitro
using VSD imaging as previously described (Barkat et al., 2011; Hackett
et al., 2011). The acquisition and analysis of these experiments were per-
formed blind to the drug condition of the mouse pups. Further details can be
found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recording
Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed in L4 pyramidal neurons
in A1 from P12–P21 mice, as previously described (Sun et al., 2013). Synaptic
responses were evoked by stimulating the MGBv or L6. Stimulation intensity
was adjusted to elicit detectable synaptic responses with about a 50% failure
rate (Zhou et al., 2011). To examine the postsynaptic silent synapses, cells were
first held at �60 mV and then stimulated with the same intensity at +40 mV. The
failure responses of eEPSCs were visually verified blind to the drug condition of
the mice. The fraction of silent synapses was calculated using the established
formula: % silent synapses = (1 � ln(F�60)/ln(F+40)) 3 100%. Further details can
be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analyses
All data are expressed as mean ± SE. For two-group comparisons, statistical
significance was assessed using the two-tailed Student’s unpaired or paired
t test for normally distributed data or the non-parametric two-tailed Mann-
Whitney U test for data not distributed normally. Multi-group comparisons
were performed using one-way ANOVA for normally distributed data or Krus-
kal-Wallis nonparametric tests. For comparison across groups with unequal
variance, the unequal-variance t test using an unpooled SE was performed.
The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality, and Levene’s method
was used to test for equal variance. Statistically significant differences were
established at p < 0.05.
