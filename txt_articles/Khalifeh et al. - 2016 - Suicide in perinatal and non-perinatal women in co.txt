Suicide in perinatal and non-perinatal women in contact with 
psychiatric services: 15 year fi
 ndings from a UK national inquiry
Hind Khalifeh, Isabelle M Hunt, Louis Appleby, Louise M Howard
Summary
Background Suicide in pregnant and postnatal women is an important cause of maternal death, but evidence to guide 
suicide prevention in this group is scarce. We aimed to compare the trend, nature, and correlates of suicide in 
perinatal and non-perinatal women in contact with psychiatric services.
Methods We used 1997–2012 data from the UK National Confi
 dential Inquiry into Suicides and Homicides by People 
with Mental Illness, which includes all suicides by people (age ≥10 years) who had been in contact with psychiatric 
services in the previous year. The study sample comprised all women who died by suicide in pregnancy or the fi
 rst 
postnatal year (perinatal suicides), and all women in the same age range who died by suicide outside this period 
(non-perinatal suicides). We compared suicides among perinatal and non-perinatal women with logistic regression of 
multiply imputed data.
Findings The study sample included 4785 women aged 16–50 years who died by suicide, of whom 98 (2%) died in the 
perinatal period. Of the 1485 women aged 20–35 years, 74 (4%) women died in the perinatal period. Over the course 
of the study, we recorded a modest downward trend in the mean number of women dying by suicide in the 
non-perinatal period (–2·07 per year [SD 0·96]; p=0·026), but not the perinatal period (–0·07 per year [0·37]; p=0·58). 
Compared with non-perinatal women, women who died by suicide in the perinatal period were more likely to have a 
diagnosis of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·19 [95% CI 1·43–3·34]; p<0·001) and less likely to be receiving 
any active treatment (0·46 [0·24–0·89]; p=0·022) at the time of death. Women who died by suicide within versus 
outside the perinatal period were also more likely to be younger (crude OR –6·39 [95% CI –8·15 to –4·62]; p<0·0001) 
and married (4·46 [2·93–6·80]; p<0·0001), with shorter illness duration (2·93 [1·88–4·56]; p<0·001) and no history 
of alcohol misuse (0·47 [0·24–0·92]; p=0·027). There were no diff
 erences in service contact or treatment adherence.
Interpretation In women in contact with UK psychiatric services, suicides in the perinatal period were more likely to 
occur in those with a depression diagnosis and no active treatment at the time of death. Assertive follow-up and 
treatment of perinatal women in contact with psychiatric services are needed to address suicide risk in this group.

Introduction
Suicide is an important cause of death during pregnancy 
and the fi
 rst postnatal year, accounting for about 5–20% 
of maternal deaths in high-income countries,1–7 and 
1–5% in low-income and middle-income countries.8 
National inquiries have repeatedly called for improved 
detection and management of suicide risk in perinatal 
(pregnant and post-partum) women.1,2 Suicide in women 
is rare, with an annual rate of about fi
 ve to ten deaths per 
100 000 population,9 and rarer still in the perinatal 
period, with a rate of one to fi
 ve deaths per 
100 000 livebirths in high-income settings.7,10,11 Prevention 
of such a rare outcome is challenging, and will probably 
require targeted intervention in high-risk women.12
Most women who die by suicide in the perinatal period 
have a known history of mental illness,1,3,7,13 and, in 
Europe, 50–60% receive care from psychiatric services 
during their index pregnancy or postnatal period,1,2,7 
which provides an opportunity for suicide prevention. 
Mental illness in the perinatal period has a distinct 
clinical presentation. For example, women are more 
likely to stop medication in the perinatal period than at 
other times,14–16 and are more likely to have abrupt onset, 
rapidly deteriorating psychosis in the postnatal period.17 
Although most women have increased contact with 
health service during pregnancy, some might avoid 
services because of fear of stigma or child custody loss.13 
These clinical diff
 erences might be refl
 ected in a distinct 
suicide risk profi
 le, but the risk profi
 le of perinatal 
compared 
with 
non-perinatal 
suicides 
is 
poorly 
understood.
Previous studies of suicides in the perinatal period 
have several limitations: many focus on a single 
geographical area3,18–21 and examine a small number of 
correlates.22,23 Studies based on maternal death inquiries 
have a brief reference period, examine only a few 
suicides at a given time, have insuffi
  cient data for 
psychiatric illness and service contact, and focus 
exclusively on the maternal population, and thus do not 
allow direct comparisons with suicides outside the 
perinatal period.1,2,24,25 Women in contact with psychiatric 
services are an important high-risk group,6,7,23,26 but few 
studies have examined their clinical presentation and 
treatment before suicide.

To address some of these evidence gaps, we aimed to 
compare the characteristics of women who died by 
suicide within and outside the perinatal period for women 
who had been in recent contact with UK psychiatric 
services, and to compare suicide trends and methods in 
these two groups. More specifi
 cally, we aimed to test the 
hypotheses that women who died by suicide in the 
perinatal period were more likely to be non-adherent with 
medication and less likely to have been assessed as high 
risk by clinicians (on the basis of clinical diff
 erences 
between perinatal and non-perinatal patients).17,27
Methods
Study design and study sample
We used 1997–2012 data from the UK National 
Confi
 dential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by 
People with Mental Illness (NCISH). NCISH aims to 
identify all UK suicides by people aged 10 years and older 
who had been in contact with psychiatric services (in this 
context, any service provided by a secondary mental 
health-care provider) in the 12 months preceding the 
suicide. This contact can comprise outpatient, day-care, 
inpatient, or crisis home treatment care provided by one 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We aimed to inform suicide prevention strategies in the 
perinatal period (during pregnancy and in the fi
 rst postnatal 
year) by comparing the characteristics of women who died by 
suicide within and outside the perinatal period for women who 
had been in recent contact with UK psychiatric services. We 
searched MEDLINE for reviews and peer-reviewed articles 
published between Jan 1, 1990, and Oct 25, 2015, with 
evidence of the extent or risk factors for perinatal suicide in the 
general population and in psychiatric patients. Our search 
terms were (suicide or Suicide/) and (pregnancy or antenatal or 
postnatal or perinatal or maternal or Pregnancy/ or Perinatal 
Death/ or Perinatal Mortality/ or Maternal Mortality/). We also 
reviewed all available publications from the UK Confi
 dential 
Enquiries into Maternal Deaths. Most studies used general 
population data and reported that suicide rates during 
pregnancy and the postnatal period were about two to three 
times lower than age-adjusted rates in non-perinatal women, 
in both high-income countries and low-income and 
middle-income settings. The proportion of maternal deaths 
attributable to suicide in most studies ranged from roughly less 
than 1% to 5% in low-income and middle-income countries 
(Fuhr DC, et al, 2014) and from 3% to 13% in high-income 
countries (as reported in studies from Europe, North America, 
and Australia). Few studies examined risk factors for maternal 
suicides. Reported risk factors included mental illness (present 
in 30–70% of maternal suicides), substance misuse, intimate 
partner violence, neonatal complications (particularly perinatal 
death), and medical comorbidity. Associations with age and 
socioeconomic status diff
 ered by setting and timing of suicide, 
with teenagers reported to have a higher risk of pregnancy 
suicide than women of other ages, especially in low-income 
and middle-income countries.
We identifi
 ed one study of psychiatric patients, which 
investigated suicide rates in women admitted to a psychiatric 
hospital in the fi
 rst postnatal year in Denmark over a 21 year 
period. This study reported that 0·9% of the women died by 
suicide in the fi
 rst postnatal year (a 70 times higher risk than 
women in the general population) and 3·3% died by suicide 
over the whole study period (a 17 times higher risk). These 
fi
 ndings suggest that the post-partum period, which is 
protective against suicide in the general population, is a 
high-risk period for women with severe post-partum mental 
illness. Qualitative evidence from maternal death inquiries 
suggest that mental illness is often undetected in perinatal 
women who die by suicide and, when detected, is often 
suboptimally managed, but these fi
 ndings have not been 
investigated quantitatively. We did not fi
 nd other evidence of 
the characteristics or risk profi
 le of psychiatric patients who die 
by suicide in the perinatal period.
Added value of this study
This study is one of the largest case series of perinatal suicides 
among women in contact with psychiatric services, and 
uniquely compares sociodemographic and clinical 
characteristic of patients who died by suicide within and 
outside the perinatal period. We reported that women in 
contact with psychiatric services who died by suicide in the 
perinatal period were more likely to be young and married, 
and to have shorter mental illness duration and no history of 
alcohol misuse, than were those who died outside that period. 
Almost half of perinatal women had a diagnosis of depression 
(compared with a third of non-perinatal women) and a fi
 fth 
had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or personality disorder; 
a quarter had a history of self-harm. A substantial minority 
were not receiving any active treatment or follow-up at the 
time of death. About three-quarters of women who died by 
suicide in the perinatal period used a violent suicide method 
(possibly indicating severe illness and serious intent).
Implications of all the available evidence
In the general population, suicide in the perinatal period is less 
common than at other times in a woman’s life, but this 
protective eff
 ect might not apply to women in contact with 
psychiatric services (ie, those with severe mental illness), who 
might have a particularly high suicide risk in the fi
 rst postnatal 
year. Women who die by suicide in the perinatal period are more 
likely to have a brief illness and depression diagnosis, and are 
less likely to be receiving active treatment, than are women 
who die by suicide outside this period. Clinicians should be 
aware that women with severe perinatal depression in 
particular are a group at risk of suicide who need careful 
monitoring and treatment.

or more members of the multidisciplinary team, which 
commonly includes psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, 
mental 
health 
social 
workers, 
and 
occupational 
therapists. Inquiry data collection is done in three steps. 
First, preliminary  data is obtained for all UK suicides (ie, 
deaths that received a suicide or open verdict at a 
coroner’s inquest), by use of the relevant national death 
registers in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern 
Ireland. Second, providers of psychiatric services in each 
deceased person’s district of residence or death (and 
neighbouring districts) are contacted to establish whether 
the person had been in contact with them in the 
12 months preceding suicide. The Inquiry contacts both 
National Health Service (NHS) and private providers. UK 
residents are entitled to free NHS health care in the 
boroughs where they live, and most patients use local 
public (NHS) psychiatric services rather than private 
services. Finally, for individuals with psychiatric contact, 
demographic and clinical data are obtained by sending a 
structured questionnaire to the patient’s consultant 
psychiatrist.28 The questionnaire is completed by the 
consultant psychiatrist or another senior team member, 
with information derived from personal knowledge of 
the patient, all available psychiatric records, and from 
other team members involved in the patient’s care as 
appropriate. The questionnaire includes a question about 
whether the person who died by suicide was a woman 
who was pregnant or less than 1 year postnatal. We used 
the responses to this question to defi
 ne perinatal versus 
non-perinatal suicides in this study.
The study sample comprised all women who died by 
suicide in pregnancy or the fi
 rst postnatal year 
(perinatal suicides), and all women in the same age 
range who died by suicide outside this period 
(non-perinatal suicides). We excluded women with 
missing data for whether suicide was in the perinatal 
period. We compared several characteristics in women 
who died by suicide within and outside the perinatal 
period (as reported by the clinical team in the Inquiry’s 
structured questionnaire): sociodemographics, clinical 
characteristics, treatment at the time of death, 
symptom profi
 le and risk assessment at last contact, 
and suicide method. We also compared the above 
characteristics in women who died by suicide in 
pregnancy with those who died in the postnatal period.
Statistical analysis
We assessed binary associations with χ² tests for 
categorical measures and t tests for continuous measures; 
two-sided p values are reported. We did trend analysis 
with Poisson regression with identity link function.
We investigated the extent and pattern of missing data 
to guide modelling strategy. We used multiple imputation 
to handle missing data. This technique was done with 
sequential regression multivariate imputation (M=20 
imputations), and included all variables used in 
the post-imputation analysis models. Crude and

independent correlates of perinatal versus non-perinatal 
suicides were then assessed using logistic regression of 
imputed data, with adjustment for potential a-priori 
confounding when conceptually appropriate: clinical 
characteristics were adjusted for sociodemographics; and 
treatment, service contact, risk assessment, and suicide 
methods were adjusted for sociodemographics and 
clinical characteristics. We did three sets of sensitivity 
analyses: (1) complete data analyses with standard logistic 
regression, with fi
 ndings compared with imputed data 
analyses; (2) complete data analyses with use of penalised 
maximum likelihood regression to explore and minimise 
small sample-size bias,29,30 with fi
 ndings compared with 
those 
from 
standard 
logistic 
regression; 
and 
(3) comparisons of postnatal suicides only (excluding 
pregnancy suicides) versus non-perinatal suicides. We 
did analyses with STATA (version 13.0).

Results 
The Inquiry case series included 5135 deaths by suicide in 
women aged 16–50 years who were in contact with 
psychiatric services in the year preceding their death. 
After exclusion of 350 (7%) cases with missing data for 
whether suicide was in the perinatal period, the study 
sample included 4785 women who died by suicide, of 
whom 80 (2%) women died in the fi
 rst postnatal year and 
18 (<1%) women died during pregnancy. 98 (2%) of 
4785 suicides in women aged 16–50 years and 74 (4%) of 
1845 suicides in those aged 20–35 years were in the 
perinatal period. Over the course of the study, we recorded 
a signifi
 cant modest downward trend in the mean 
number of women dying by suicide in the non-perinatal 
period (–2·07 per year [SD 0·96]; p=0·026), but not in the 
perinatal period (–0·07 per year [0·36]; p=0·58).
The 98 women who died by suicide in the perinatal 
period had a mean age of 30·5 years; most were married, 
roughly a fi
 fth were employed, and 5% were living in 
temporary or supported accommodation (table 1). The 
most common primary diagnosis was depression, 
followed by schizophrenia and other delusional 
disorders, personality disorder, and bipolar disorder 
(table 1). Other primary diagnoses such as alcohol or 
drug dependence were reported for only a few women. 
More than a third of perinatal women had a mental 
illness duration (since clear onset of the primary 
diagnosis) of less than 1 year, and had no previous 
admissions (table 1). Roughly a tenth of these women 
had recent alcohol or drug misuse, and a quarter had 
self-harmed in the past 3 months (table 1).
At the time of death, 61% of perinatal women were 
prescribed psychotropic medication, 11% were receiving 
psychological treatment, and 29% were receiving other 
non-pharmacological treatment (table 2). At least 13% of

women were reported not to be receiving any of the 
above treatments (table 2). A fi
 fth of women had not 
been seen for more than a month, a quarter had missed 
their last appointment with a mental health professional, 
and a fi
 fth were non-adherent with prescribed medication 
(table 2). Risk was deemed to be moderate or high for 
13% of women in the immediate term and for 30% of 
women in the long-term (table 2). The most common 
symptoms at the patients’ last contact with a mental 
health professional were emotional distress (n=37) and 
depressed mood (n=35), followed by recent self-harm 
(n=16), suicidal ideas (n=12), and hopelessness (n=11; 
fi
 gure). Delusions or hallucinations were relatively rare 
(fi
 gure).
Most women who died by suicide in the perinatal 
period used a violent method, mainly by hanging or 
jumping (table 3). Roughly a quarter died by self-
poisoning, with only 4% dying by overdose of 
psychotropics (table 3). Homicide followed by suicide 
was reported for 2% of the women who died by suicide in 
the perinatal period (in both cases the victims were the 
patients’ children) and in less than 1% of women who 
died by suicide outside the perinatal period (the victims 
were known for only two of 11 cases, and both involved 
the patient’s children).
Women who died by suicide within the perinatal period 
were more likely to be younger, married, and living with a 
partner than were those who died outside that period 
(table 4). After accounting for sociodemographic variables, 
perinatal women were more likely to have a primary 
diagnosis of depression and a mental illness duration of 
less than 1 year, and were less likely to have a history of 
alcohol misuse, than were non-perinatal women (table 4). 
After accounting for sociodemographic and clinical 
diff
 erences, perinatal women were half as likely to 
be receiving medication, or any pharmacological, 
psychological, or other treatment, at the time of death as 
were non-perinatal women (table 4). There were no 
crude diff
 erences in other demographic or clinical 
characteristics, including medication adherence and risk 
assessment (table 4). Perinatal women were more likely to 
use violent suicide methods than non-perinatal women 
(table 4), but this fi
 nding was no longer signifi
 cant after 
adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical diff
 erences 
(table 4). Since most non-violent suicides were attributable 
to overdose (table 3), these fi
 ndings are also refl
 ected in 
the odds of dying after overdose of any substance (table 4). 
However, the odds of dying after overdose of psychotropic 
medication were a third lower in perinatal than 
non-perinatal women (table 4).
We report diff
 erences between suicide during 
pregnancy and suicide during the postnatal period at the 
0·20 signifi
 cance level, because the number of women 
who died by suicide during pregnancy was small, and 
statistical power to detect diff
 erences was low. Women 
who died by suicide during pregnancy (n=18) were less 
likely to have a diagnosis of depression than were women 
who died by suicide in the postnatal period (n=80; 33% vs 
51%; p=0·16) and more likely to have a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia or related disorders (28% vs 10%; p=0·12) 
or bipolar disorder (17% vs 6%; p=0·15; appendix). 
Moreover, women who died by suicide during pregnancy 
were more likely to be non-adherent with prescribed 
medication in the month before their suicide than were 
women who died in the postnatal period (33% vs 15%; 
p=0·11), and were less likely to have self-harmed in the

Discussion
Our fi
 ndings show that roughly one in 50 suicides in 
women aged 16–50 years and one in 25 suicides in 
women aged 20–35 years were in the perinatal period. 
Over the course of the study, we recorded a modest 
downward trend in the number of women dying by 
suicide in the non-perinatal period, but not in the 
perinatal period. Compared with women who died by 
suicide outside the perinatal period, women who died 
by suicide in the perinatal period were more likely to

have a diagnosis of depression with recent illness onset 
and no history of alcohol misuse. Furthermore, women 
who died by suicide in the perinatal period were less 
likely to be receiving active treatment, particularly 
medication, at the time of death than were women who 
died outside that period. There was no diff
 erence in 
recorded treatment adherence, symptoms at last contact 
or risk assessment. Almost three-quarters of women 
who died by suicide in the perinatal period used a 
violent method. Two of the 98 women killed their infant 
before dying by suicide; a fi
 nding that should be 
interpreted with caution in view of the very low absolute 
number.
Fortunately, women who are new or expectant mothers 
rarely die by suicide,6,8,22,23 but, when death by suicide does 
occur, it is a strikingly tragic event. Women in the general 
population are less likely to die by suicide in the perinatal 
period than at other times,19,31,32 but previous studies 
suggest that this protective eff
 ect is lost in women with 
severe post-partum illness.33 One study33 of national Danish

data reported that of women admitted to psychiatric wards 
in the fi
 rst postnatal year, 0·9% died by suicide in that year 
(a risk 70 times higher than in the general population). 
This fi
 nding suggests there is an appreciable risk of suicide 
in the perinatal period in women in contact with psychiatric 
services, but little is known about these women’s risk 
profi
 le or treatment history.
Our study describes the largest case series of perinatal 
suicides among women in contact with psychiatric 
services. Depression was the most common diagnosis 
in all women who died by suicide, occurring in about 
half of postnatal suicides and a third of pregnancy and 
non-perinatal suicides. For all women, the most 
common symptoms at last contact were distress, 
depressed mood, suicidal ideas, and hopelessness; few 
reported hallucinations or delusions. Women who died 
by suicide in the perinatal period were also less likely to 
be receiving active treatment than were women who 
died outside that period. Depression is arguably 
under-recognised as a leading cause of perinatal suicide, 
with much public and clinical attention focused on the 
rare, but very high-risk, presentation of postnatal 
psychosis. The point prevalence of major depressive 
disorder is about 5% in pregnancy and in the fi
 rst 
3 postnatal months.17 Women often discontinue their 
antidepressant medication in the perinatal period,15 
mostly because of fears of potential harm to the unborn 
baby or breastfeeding infant, leaving them vulnerable to 
relapse in pregnancy and beyond.17,34 In practice, these 
fi
 ndings suggest that clinicians need to closely monitor 
perinatal suicide risk not only in women with psychotic 
illnesses, but also in those with depression. Decisions 
about discontinuation of medication need to be made 
after a careful individual risk–benefi
 t analysis.35 For 
women who choose to discontinue medication, adequate 
and timely alternative treatments (eg, psychological 
treatment), and appropriate, proactive follow-up, should 
be ensured.35
In general population studies, other reported risk 
factors for dying by suicide in the perinatal period 
include a history of suicide attempts (found in a quarter 
of patients in this study and a fi
 fth in a recent Swedish 
general population study7), being a victim of intimate 
partner violence,6,7,11,36,37 teenage pregnancy,8,23 older age 
in some high-income settings,1,7 being an immigrant 
from a low-income country,7 obstetric or neonatal 
complications7 (especially perinatal deaths),3 and medical 
comorbidity.3 Women with severe mental illness are 
known to have a high prevalence of intimate partner 
violence, medical comorbidity, and obstetric or neonatal 
complications,16,27 which might contribute to their 
increased suicide risk.
Our study confi
 rms previous fi
 ndings that maternal 
suicides are often violent.3,7,13,22,31 This fi
 nding might 
refl
 ect greater illness severity or higher suicidal intent in 
this group than in the general population.38 In our study, 
in which most women had a depressive illness, the use of 
violent suicide methods suggests severe depression, 
possibly with psychotic symptoms. Although psychotic 
symptoms at last contact were scarcely reported in this 
study, early post-partum psychosis tends to have an 
abrupt onset with rapid deterioration,27 so symptoms 
might not have been detected by professionals.
Our fi
 nding that rates of perinatal suicides did not 
decrease over the study time period is supported by a 
static rate of perinatal suicides in the Swedish general 
population over a 27 year period.7 Maternal death inquiries 
have made specifi
 c recommendations to decrease suicide 
risk in perinatal women, including a focus on women 
with a history of severe mental illness and the provision 
of specialist perinatal mental health care;25,39 however, the 
real-life eff
 ect of such recommendations on suicide 
incidence remains unknown.
Overall, there are some similarities between our fi
 ndings 
of the characteristics of women who died by suicide in the 
perinatal period and those from other studies (such as 
the high prevalence of violent suicide), but also some 
diff
 erences (such as the higher proportion of women with 
a diagnosis of depression, age, marital status, and 
substance misuse history).7 Notably, we included only 
women who had been in contact with psychiatric services 
in the 12 months preceding their deaths. The diff
 erences 
between this and other studies are likely to be related to 
diff
 erences in study design and inclusion criteria, study 
setting, and health service provision. Therefore, some of 
our fi
 ndings might be specifi
 c to the women in contact 
with psychiatric services in the UK. We are unable to 
comment on the characteristics of women who die by 
suicide in the perinatal period without contact with 
psychiatric services in the previous year.
The key strength of this study is that it is a large, 
nationally representative case series of suicides in women 
in contact with psychiatric services, allowing a detailed 
quantitative analysis of the characteristics and correlates 
of perinatal versus non-perinatal suicides in this 
population. A further strength is that the analysis was 
carefully designed to account for potential confounding. 
Our study has three key limitations. First, the data are 
limited to women in contact with psychiatric services in 
the year before their death, and are therefore unlikely to 
be generalisable to all perinatal suicides. Nevertheless, at 
least in the UK setting, roughly 60% of women who die by 
suicide in the perinatal period have contact with 
psychiatric services, and the fi
 ndings will be generalisable 
to this large subgroup. Second, we used data from a case 
series rather than an epidemiological sample of women at 
risk; as such, we were unable to estimate suicide rate or to 
investigate suicide risk factors. The correlates of perinatal 
suicides reported in this study could refl
 ect a diff
 erence in 
the baseline prevalence of examined characteristics, or a 
diff
 erence in the nature or strength of the association 
between a given factor and suicide timing. Clarifi
 cation of 
the above requires large epidemiological studies, which 
are diffi
  cult to do because of the rarity of perinatal suicides

www.thelancet.com/psychiatry   Vol 3   March 2016 
241
and the limitations of routinely available data. Our 
fi
 ndings should be interpreted with caution, in the 
absence of denominator data for the population at risk of 
suicide within and outside the perinatal period. Third, all 
data were reported by a clinician (most often the consultant 
psychiatrist) on the basis of their knowledge of the patient 
and clinical records. Although investigation of suicides 
through seeking of information from treating clinicians 
and medical records is a well-established method, this 
technique has limitations, including staff
  changes, recall 
biases, and varied quality of documentation. Information 
might be particularly insuffi
  cient when the patient has 
had only short-term contact with psychiatric services, 
which could lead to data errors or to reporting bias. 
However, this limitation is unlikely to diff
 er by whether 
suicide was perinatal or not, so is unlikely to materially 
aff
 ect study conclusions.
Other limitations include missing data for some 
covariates (eg, medication treatment at time of death), 
although fi
 ndings from complete case and imputed data 
analyses were very similar; the fact that the inquiry was 
not designed to specifi
 cally investigate perinatal deaths, so 
did not address risk factors that are specifi
 c to this 
population (eg, obstetric or neonatal complications); and 
restricted measures of social adversity (important potential 
correlates of perinatal suicide, such as a history of partner 
violence and socioeconomic position, were not measured).
In conclusion, our fi
 ndings show that roughly one in 
50 female suicides were in new or expectant mothers. 
Suicide in this group was often violent and more likely to 
occur in women with a depression diagnosis and recent 
illness onset, with a substantial minority not receiving 
follow-up or treatment at the time of death. Assertive 
follow-up and treatment of women who are under the 
care of mental health services in the perinatal period is 
needed to address suicide risk in this group.
