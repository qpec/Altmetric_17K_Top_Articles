Abstract
Encapsulation of human embryonic stem-cell-differentiated beta cell clusters (hES-βC) holds great

thin film cell encapsulation device that can exclude immune molecules while allowing exchange of 
oxygen and nutrients necessary for in vitro and in vivo stem cell viability and function.

 body response in vivo. The device also successfully prevented teratoma escape into the peritoneal 
cavity of mice. Long-term animal studies demonstrate evidence of engraftment, viability, and 
function of cells encapsulated in the device after 6 months. Finally, in vivo study confirms that the

Diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by autoimmune-mediated β-cell destruction in 
type 1 diabetes and progressive β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes, leading to insulin 
insufficiency. The current standard of care for diabetics relies on closely monitoring blood 
glucose levels and administration of exogenous insulin by injections to simulate natural 
insulin secretion kinetics of pancreatic β cells. However, exogenous insulin delivery often 
fails to adequately modulate blood glucose levels within a tight physiological range. 
Resulting complications include life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes and hyperglycemia-
induced long-term micro- and macroangiopathies, leading to cardiovascular pathologies, 
kidney failure, retinopathy, and neuropathy.1 Pancreas and pancreatic islet transplantation 
has been proven to be an effective treatment modality for T1D patients to achieve insulin 
independence;2−4 however, its use has been limited due to islet donor shortages and the need 
for chronic systemic immune suppression.5
The development of human embryonic stem cell (hES) or induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSC)-derived insulin-producing cells promises to address the challenge of islet donor 
shortage.6 Although several groups have successfully produced insulin-secreting cells from 
hES and iPSC,7−14 clinical translation requires new engineering solutions to address safety 
concerns of teratoma formation and protection against immune rejection.15 Cell 
encapsulation has emerged as a promising strategy by providing a physical barrier between 
transplanted hES-derived beta cell clusters (hES-βC) and the transplant recipient, thereby 
achieving immunoprotection from the host immune response.16,17 The optimal cell 
encapsulation device should allow sufficient oxygen and nutrient exchange in order to 
support the viability of encapsulated cells. It should also allow for efficient transport of 
glucose and insulin so that blood glucose can be properly controlled. At the same time, 
immunoprotective cell encapsulation devices need to exclude penetration of immune cells,

 antibodies, and proinflammatory cytokines. The devices must also be biocompatible and 
should confine any potentially tumorigenic cells.
Over the years, there have been several reports of macro- or microencapsulation strategies 
for islet transplantation that have achieved varying degrees of success.18−22 A 
microencapsulation approach uses a polymer to individually contain a single cell or islet 
cluster within a microscale capsule, in order to maximize the surface area to volume ratio for 
improved nutrient exchange.23 However, there is limited control over the thickness and pore 
size of microcapsules, and retrieval after injection is difficult. On the other hand, 
macroencapsulation devices that contain many cells or islet clusters allow for much greater 
control over membrane thickness and pore size and can be readily retrieved after 
transplantation. However, these devices are suboptimal in nutrient exchange owing to thicker 
membranes and larger reservoir volume.24 One of the most challenging constraints is 
straddling the encapsulation device diffusional barrier between the limits of cell viability and 
adequate immune protection. It is useful to characterize the diffusional properties of cell 
encapsulation barriers by their ability to transport immunoglobulins, proinflammatory 
cytokines, insulin, and glucose as a way of instructing future encapsulation device designs. 
In our previous work, we demonstrated the initial proof of concept of these thin film devices 
to encapsulate and protect the immortalized MIN6 cell line.25,26
In this report, we incorporate hES-βC into an immunoprotective macroencapsulation device. 
We specifically show that the membranes are able to exclude proinflammatory cytokines 
while allowing sufficient glucose and insulin exchange. Furthermore, we also demonstrate 
favorable long-term in vivo biocompatibility of the device as characterized by low foreign 
body response, robust neovasculature formation, and the ability to prevent cellular escape 
leading to teratomas. Encapsulated hES-derived insulin-producing cells were shown to be 
viable and have measurable glucose-sensitive C-peptide response in mice 6 months after 
transplantation. Finally, the immunoprotective devices successfully prevented the priming of 
antigen-specific T cells in vivo.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Immunoprotective Cell Encapsulation Device Design and Fabrication
The immunoprotective cell encapsulation device should allow for exchange of insulin, 
glucose, and oxygen while excluding immune cells, immunoglobulins, and proinflammatory 
cytokines across the membrane barrier (Figure 1A). A bilaminar nanoporous thin film 
macroencapsulation device is a favorable design due to its ability to minimize inward 
transport of immune species through tightly controlled pore structures, whereas the thin film 
barrier reduces the diffusional distance for optimal exchange of oxygen and nutrients. 
Proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interferon-gamma (IFNγ), and tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) have hydrodynamic radii of 2.18, 3.67, and 3.80 nm, 
respectively;27−29 therefore, immunoprotective membranes require pore diameters on the 
order to 10 to 100 nm. Polycaprolactone, a synthetic polymer, was selected as the preferred 
material owing to its favorable physical and biocompatibility properties.30 Unlike natural 
polymers such as sodium alginate that have batch-to-batch variations and are often 
contaminated with endotoxins,31 synthetic polymer can be synthesized under reproducible

 and endotoxin-free conditions.32 Polycaprolactone has also been used in a variety of FDA-
approved medical products.30 Furthermore, the low melting temperature of polycaprolactone 
allows for precise templating of stringently controlled pore sizes as well as tailored design of 
device geometry and thickness.
We fabricated nanoporous immunoprotective membranes (NIM) using a substrate templating 
technique (Figure 1B).25 Briefly, zinc oxide nanorods were grown hydrothermally onto 
silicon wafers to yield structures measuring 20 nm in diameter and 500 nm in height (Figure 
1C). Polycaprolactone (PCL) solution was spin-cast onto zinc oxide nanotemplated silicon 
substrates (Figure 1D), followed by sulfuric acid etching of zinc oxide. The resulting 
polymer membrane is a 10 µm thick, consisting of a 500 nm thick nanoporous layer backed 
by a supporting porous layer (Figure 1E). These membranes are highly flexible and 
mechanically stable to permit the assembly of the nanoporous immunoprotective device 
(NID) for cell encapsulation. Two NIMs are cut to desired shapes and heat-sealed at 70 °C 
along the edges to form a bilaminar flexible and nonbrittle device with mechanical integrity 
that can be easily handled with forceps (Figure 1F and Supplementary Figure 1A,B).
In Vitro Characterization of Nanoporous Immunoprotective Membranes
Immunoprotective barriers designed for cell encapsulation must selectively inhibit diffusion 
of key immunogenic molecules including immunoglobulins and proinflammatory cytokines 
while permitting exchange of glucose and insulin. Human IgG has a molecular weight of 
153 kDa33 whereas the TNFα homotrimer, IFNγ, and IL-1β proinflammatory cytokines 
have molecular weights of 52, 17, and 30 kDa, respectively.27−29 Twenty nanometers and 
200 nm pore size NIMs (NIM-20 and NIM-200, respectively) were fabricated and 
characterized for their robust ability to prevent diffusion of immunoglobulins and 
proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, we included 400 nm PTFE membranes (PTFE-400) 
with pore size comparable to that of the Theracyte device,34 the first macroencapsulation 
device to be tested in clinical studies, as a control. We studied the molecular weight 
diffusion cutoff limit of NIMs and PTFE-400 by evaluating the diffusion rate of 4, 10, and 
40 kDa dextran molecules over a course of 7 days at physiological 37 °C. Both NIM-20 and 
NIM-200, but not PTEF-400, were successful in preventing transport of 4, 10, and 40 kDa 
dextran molecules (Figure 2A). Whereas NIMs are able to inhibit diffusion of high 
molecular weight cytokines, it is critical that they do not hinder the transport of smaller 
molecules such as glucose. We measured the amount of glucose diffusion across NIM-20, 
NIM-200, and PTFE-400 over 5 min at 37 °C incubation. There was no significant 
difference between the amount of glucose transported across the three groups (Figure 2B). 
These membrane characterization studies suggest that NIMs preferentially exclude larger 
molecular weight species such as immunoglobulin and proinflammatory cytokines while 
permitting the diffusion of smaller molecules, including glucose.
To determine if NIMs can selectively block immune molecules, we first investigated the 
ability of NIMs to inhibit diffusion of human IgG over 1 week of 37 °C incubation. In this 
study, PTFE-400 failed to prevent transport of IgG while both NIM-20 and NIM-200 
significantly reduced IgG transport (Figure 2C). We furthered investigated which cytokines 
were preferentially excluded from diffusing into the cell-containing compartment using a

 mouse proinflammatory cytokine Luminex panel.35 We observed reduced cytokine diffusion 
across NIM-20 relative to NIM-200 or PTFE-400 barriers following a 7 day diffusion study 
(Figure 2D). Interestingly, certain cytokines were excluded more effectively than others. For 
instance, only 10% of IL-1β was transported across NIM-20 while 25 and 80% of TNFα 
and IFNγ were transported across the same NIM-20, respectively. One may expect a size-
dependent relationship that can explain the diffusion profile of our panel of proinflammatory 
cytokines. Cytokine diffusion rates were compared against their respective protein molecular 
weights (Figure 2E). Although there was a general trend toward reduced diffusion with 
larger molecular weight cytokines, there exists a population of small molecular weight 
cytokines with poor transport kinetics. One of the properties explaining this phenomenon 
could be differences in protein charges as the negatively charged polycaprolactone NIMs30 
can preferentially cause adhesion of positively charged cytokines. Indeed, the isoelectric 
point of cytokines had a significant effect on the protein’s ability to transport across NIMs. 
Specifically, cytokines with isoelectric points above 7 that are positively charged at neutral 
pH transported poorly across NIMs regardless of their molecular weight, while negatively 
charged cytokines exhibited size-dependent transport kinetics (Figure 2E). Electrostatic 
repulsion between the cytokines and the surface of the polymer nanopores potentially allows 
negatively charged cytokines to traverse through the nanoporous structures of NIMs more 
effectively.
Because cytokine diffusion is attenuated, we then further determined if NIMs offer 
pancreatic islets protection against cytokine exposure. In a transwell coculture system, 
mouse islets were placed in the top compartment, and syngeneic mouse splenocytes 
activated by surface-immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 were placed in the bottom 
compartment as a source of cytokines. The top and bottom compartments were separated by 
NIM-20 and NIM-200 or a 8 µm PTFE barrier (PTFE-8000). The viability of mouse islets 
was quantified 48 h later using flow cytometry of dissociated islets after propidum iodine 
staining. Results of this study demonstrate significantly reduced apoptosis in mouse islets 
protected by NIM-20 and NIM-200 when compared to islets protected by PTFE-8000 
(Figure 2F). Consistent with our results shown in Figure 2D, we confirmed that NIM-20 
reduced proinflammatory cytokine diffusion into the islet compartment (Supplementary 
Figure 2A).
In Vitro Evaluation of Cell Viability and Function in Nanoporous Immunoprotective Devices
Once establishing that the exclusion of cytokines and immunoglobulins is important for 
preservation of primary mouse islet viability, we evaluated the ability of NIDs to support the 
viability and function of encapsulated human stem-cell-derived beta cell clusters as a more 
relevant system for cell therapy approaches. hES-βC cells were generated by a direct 
differentiation approach previously described8 with modifications of the last stage based on 
published work.14,36 To facilitate the detection of hES-βC, we generated them from Mel1 
human embryonic stem cells that contain a GFP reporter driven under the endogenous 
insulin promoter.37 Using this cell line, endogenous insulin expression, and thus β-cell 
viability, can be followed live by measuring the GFP fluorescence signal. Differentiated 
clusters consist of approximately 35% hES-βC cells as identified by intracellular flow 
analysis for human C-peptide as a readout of endogenous insulin production (Figure 3A). In

 addition, virtually all hES-βC cells coexpress key β-cell transcription factors PDX1 and 
NKX6.1 (Figure 3A), shown to be critical for β-cell function and maintenance.38,39 To 
further characterize our NIMs, we delivered hES-βC 300 clusters to the luminal cavity of a 
partially sealed NID where they are then fully encapsulated by localized heat sealing (Figure 
3B). The heat is well localized during the sealing procedure, and cells remain viable and 
well distributed within the bilaminar NID device following encapsulation (Supplementary 
Figures 1A and 3B). Importantly, fluorescence intensity from NID-encapsulated hES-βC 
was stable in both NID-20 and NID-200 over a course of 5 weeks in vitro (Figure 3C and 
Supplementary Figure 3A). This result demonstrates that insulin expression and thus 
viability of hES-βC encapsulated in NID can be maintained in culture over prolonged 
periods of time. We further studied the ability of NID-encapsulated hES-βC to secrete 
insulin in response to glucose stimulations. Interestingly, both NID-20- and NID-200-
encapsulated hES-βC exhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with comparable 
glucose stimulation indices (GSI) of approximately 1.5 (Figure 3D,E). While these data are 
within the range of GSI reported previously,8,14,36 it is likely that insulin diffusion was 
somewhat restricted as we observed reduced C-peptide concentration in both high and low 
glucose buffers in the smaller pore size NID-20 compared to that of NID-200. Based on 
these results, we continued our studies with NID-200 as it represents a more ideal 
encapsulation device for further animal studies because it protected islets against 
immunological challenges and allowed better diffusion of small molecules, including insulin 
and glucose.
In Vivo NID Biocompatibility and Prevention of Teratoma Escape
Biocompatibility of biomaterials has been shown to be critical for the safety and integrity of 
long-term cell encapsulation devices.40 In particular, foreign body responses and fibrous 
capsule development following implantation of medical devices need to be carefully studied 
for NIDs. Protein adsorption on material surfaces can promote macrophage recruitment to 
the tissue−material implant site, which may become activated through the alternative 
pathway and enhance fibrogenesis by fibroblasts, leading to fibrous capsule formation 
around the implant.41,42 To study this property, we incubated PCL and PTFE surfaces in 
fetal bovine serum for 24 h and demonstrate similar levels of protein adsorption on both 
material surfaces (Supplementary Figure 4A). An ideal biomaterial for cell encapsulation 
implant devices should exhibit low macrophage recruitment and fibrosis at the material
−tissue interface while also permitting the formation of neovasculature along the surface of 
the material to provide oxygen and nutrient support for the encapsulated cells. To this end, 
polycaprolactone and polypropylene (PP) films were implanted subcutaneously into 
immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice as part of a long-term in vivo biocompatibility study. 
Implanted PCL films along with surrounding tissue were explanted at 1 month followed by 
tissue sectioning and H&E staining. In addition, a 4 month in vivo biocompatibility study 
was performed in the same manner, and skin tissues were sectioned and immunostained for 
collagen 1, a macrophage marker (F4/80), and von Willibrand Factor to elucidate fibrosis, 
macrophage recruitment, and angiogenesis, respectively. H&E stainings demonstrate the 
robust deposition of fibrotic tissue and infiltration of immune cells in tissue with 
polypropylene implant. On the contrary, whereas there is some infiltration of immune cells 
in the polycaprolactone implant, there is no deposition of fibrotic tissue along the graft

 (Figure 4A). Immunostainings show increased blood vessel formation and reduced fibrosis 
and macrophage recruitment in PCL film grafts compared to PP implants (Figure 4B). These 
data are in agreement with H&E staining (Supplementary Figure 5A,B) that showed 
minimal fibrosis following 4 month subcutaneous transplant in immunocompetent mice and 
suggest that PCL thin films exhibit favorable biocompatibility, leading to robust 
neovasculature formation in the absence of chronic foreign body response.
The use of cell encapsulation devices for the transplantation of human stem cell products is 
important due to regulatory safety considerations in the event of cell escape, 
dedifferentiation, and/or teratoma formation. Macroencapsulation devices are advantageous 
over microencapsulation strategies because they prevent the distribution of stem cells 
throughout the body and allow for easier retrieval of explant. This is particularly important 
for the prevention of teratomas which can arise from hES cells that are not fully 
differentiated.43 We modeled the formation of teratomas in vivo by transplanting either 
encapsulated or naked undifferentiated hES into immune-deficient NOD scid gamma (NSG) 
mice. Encapsulated hES cells were transplanted between the caudate lobe and left hepatic 
lobe, and naked cells were delivered under the kidney capsule in order to confine their 
location within the animal.44 To be able to efficiently monitor hES cells after transplantation 
into animals, we engineered a constitutively expressed firefly luciferase gene into the 
insulated human AAVS1 loci of Mel1INS-GFP using TALENS as previously described45 
(Supplementary Figure 6, henceforth referred to as Mel1INS-GFP;AAVS1-Luc). Six weeks 
following transplantation, we observed pervasive teratomas in the animals that were 
transplanted with naked hES under the kidney capsule and an increase in body weight 
indicative of increased tumor mass in these animals (Figures 4C,D). In addition, imaging of 
luciferase signal demonstrates the confinement of encapsulated cells, whereas naked 
Mel1INS-GFP;AAVS1-Luc escaped the kidney capsule and were detected throughout the 
peritoneal body cavity (Figure 4D,F). Furthermore, H&E staining and immunostainings of 
tissue section grafts show that human teratoma cells are well confined within the device 
margins (Supplementary Figure 7A,B). Taken together, these data demonstrate the ability of 
our PCL NID encapsulation approach to contain proliferative cell populations within the 
device and prevent them from spreading throughout the body.
In Vivo Viability and Function of hES-βC Encapsulated in NID
To study viability and function of encapsulated Mel1INS-GFP;AAVS1-Luc derived hES-βC into 
NID, we transplanted them between the caudate lobe and left hepatic lobe of NSG mice, as 
this site was determined to be the most optimal transplant site for cell survival 
(Supplementary Figure 8A,B). The liver is one of the main sites of action of insulin and has 
been explored as an attractive site for islet transplantations due to its large surface area and 
ample vascularization.46 We measured graft persistence using bioluminescence imaging of 
the constitutively expressed luciferase gene. Luciferase bioluminescence in mice 
transplanted with NID-encapsulated hES-βC was detected on day of transplantation as well 
as 30 days and 6 months after transplantation (Figure 5A,E). These results are in agreement 
with our in vitro data showing that NIDs allow the long-term survival of hES-βC cells. To 
assess the functional properties of encapsulated hES-βC 1 week post-transplantation, mice 
were fasted overnight, followed by a challenge consisting of a bolus of glucose via

 intraperitoneal injection. Glucose-stimulated C-peptide production can be seen 1 week after 
transplantation into NSG mice and remained constant at 6 months (Figure 5B). The long-
term function of NID-encapsulated grafts was similarly assessed. Mouse serum was 
collected following overnight fast and 1 h after intraperitoneal glucose challenge and 
measured for human C-peptide concentration. Glucose-stimulated C-peptide secretion can 
be demonstrated in all mice, and glucose stimulation index ranged from 2 to 7 (Figure 
5C,D). Quantification of bioluminescence intensity at day 0 and 6 months following 
transplantation of NID-encapsulated cells shows approximately 75% graft loss (Figure 5F). 
This degree of graft loss is expected and comparable with graft loss observed when 
unencapsulated hES-βCs are transplanted in the subcutaneous space (data not shown). 
Explantation of NID devices containing hES-βC cells after 6 months followed by 
immunostaining for human C-peptide shows islet-like clusters within the device (Figure 
5G). Collectively, these studies show that NIDs are capable of supporting the viability and 
function of hES-βC in vivo for at least 6 months.
In Vivo Evaluation of Immunoisolation by NID Encapsulation
Because T cells are the principal drivers of alloimmune rejection of grafts, 
immunoprotective cell encapsulation devices must be able to prevent their activation. To 
maximally assess the immunoisolation capability of NIDs in vivo, we measured activation of 
antigen-specific T cells in response to mice challenged with ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing 
B16 cells encapsulated in NIDs. OVA-specific CD8+ T cells were collected from lymph 
nodes of OT-1 T cell receptor transgenic mice,47 stained with VPD-450, and adoptively 
transferred into wild-type C57BL/6J mice. The mice then received an intraperitoneal 
challenge of 2 × 107 free or NID-encapsulated OVA-expressing B16 melanoma cells. Six 
days following the challenge, draining lymph nodes and spleen were harvested and analyzed 
for the proliferation of OT1 OVA-specific T cells (Figure 6A). Flow cytometric analysis 
revealed loss of VPD-450 dye in mice with an unprotected B16-OVA challenge transplant, 
indicating extensive proliferation of OT1 cells; however, proliferation of OT1 T cells was 
minimal in mice that have been challenged with encapsulated B16-OVA cells (Figure 6B). 
Animals transplanted with encapsulated B16-OVA cells had significantly reduced OVA-
specific T cell proliferation in both the spleen and draining lymph nodes (Figure 6C,D). 
Moreover, there was no significant difference between the median fluorescent intensity of 
OVA-specific T cell populations in animals that received NID-encapsulated B16-OVA cells 
when compared to animals that did not receive any B16-OVA cells (Figure 6E,F). These 
results definitively demonstrate the absence of allogeneic antigen-specific T cell priming in 
hosts that received encapsulated cell transplants.
CONCLUSIONS
Stem cell replacement therapy has the potential to fundamentally change the way we treat 
and manage diabetes by achieving insulin independence in patients. Significant progress has 
been made in developing human stem-cell-derived insulin-producing cells,7–14 but 
ultimately stem cell products benefit from integration with device strategies in order to 
overcome translational challenges in cell delivery, engraftment, immunoprotection, and 
safety.17 Although there have been several encouraging reports of encapsulation strategies

 achieving glucose correction in animal models, we still have much to learn about the 
engineering specifications necessary for successful cell engraftment and immunoprotection.
In this report, we systematically evaluate a bilaminar synthetic polymer nanoporous 
immunoprotective cell encapsulation device (NID) for its ability to immunoprotect and 
sustain the function and viability of human stem-cell-derived β-cells both in vitro and in 
vivo. The use of stem-cell-derived β-cell products in this study mitigates existing islet donor 
shortages and potentially enables more diabetic patients to receive cell replacement therapy. 
Macroencapsulation devices offer distinct translational advantages of teratoma confinement 
and retrievability compared to microencapsulation alternatives. Microencapsulation 
approaches using sodium alginate typically experience thick fibrous capsule formation, 
whereas macroencapsulation NIDs in our study show robust neovascularization with 
minimal foreign body response after long-term implantation. Immunoisolation studies 
demonstrate NIDs can robustly prevent antigen-specific T cell priming. Most importantly, 6 
month animal studies demonstrate that hSC-βC in NID are both glucose-responsive and 
viable with a GSI index that exceeds the minimum standard for islet transplantation 
currently performed clinically. A better understanding of the parameters necessary for 
efficient engraftment and immunoprotection of cells in encapsulation devices will greatly 
improve the chances of successfully bringing β-cell replacement therapies into the clinic.
METHODS
Nanoporous Immunoprotective Device Fabrication
Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless noted. All films were spun-cast onto 
silicon wafers at 1000 rpm for 30 s, followed by 2000 rpm for 30 s. Nanoporous 
polycaprolactone (80 kDa Mn) films were fabricated using an established template-based 
approach reported elsewhere.25 In brief, a 0.5 M solution of zinc acetate dihydrate and 
ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol was spun-cast onto silicon wafers and annealed at 300 °C 
on a hot plate to generate a zinc oxide (ZnO) seed layer. From this seed layer, ZnO nanorods 
were hydrothermally grown in a 5 mM zinc acetate solution at 85 to 90 °C for 2 h. A 150 
mg/mL PCL solution was then spun-cast onto the nanorods, followed by a 150 mg/mL 
PEG:PCL solution to provide a microporous support, creating a nanoporous film with a 
microporous backing support layer. The film was soaked in a dilute sulfuric acid solution to 
etch away the ZnO nanorods and also dissolve the PEG, resulting in a nanoporous 
membrane with pores ranging from 30 to 100 nm supported by a microporous backing. 
Membrane characterizations and ZnO nanorod morphology were previously measured.25 To 
assemble the device, two PCL thin films were heat-sealed together using resistive heating of 
a nichrome wire. A two-step heat-sealing method was used where a 1.2 A current ran 
through a nichrome wire outlining the regions to be sealed. For the first sealing step, two 
films were placed over a U-shaped nichrome wire embedded in PDMS (Sylgard 184), 1 cm 
in diameter. To secure the membranes, a PDMS weight was placed over the films holding 
them flat. A 1.2 A current ran through the wire for 15 s and sealed the devices in the shape 
of a U, defining the device lumen shape and leaving an open side for cell injection. hSC-βC 
in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) were injected into the

 devices through the remaining open side and sealed by placing the open edge over a straight 
nichrome wire embedded in PDMS and heat-sealed with a 1.2 A current for 10 s.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Nanoporous PCL thin films were mounted on a flat SEM mount with colloidal graphite (Ted 
Pella). Cross sections were flash-dipped in isopropyl alcohol, followed by liquid nitrogen 
freeze fracture and then mounted. Samples were imaged by Carl Zeiss Ultra 55 field 
emission scanning electron microscope using an in-lens secondary electron detector at San

Standard Falcon brand 24-well 400 nm pore size PTFE transwell insert barriers were kept 
intact (PTFE-400) or removed and replaced with 20 nm pore size or 200 nm pore size 
immunoprotective films (NIM-20, NIM-200). The inserts were then placed into respective 
wells on a 24-well plate. For transport studies, 0.3 mL of 100 µg/mL FITC-conjugated 
dextran at 4, 10, and 40 kDa, 0.3 mL of 100 µg/mL human IgG, or 10 mM glucose solution 
in PBS was placed in the top compartment. One milliliter of PBS was placed in the bottom 
compartment. The transwell culture plate was placed in a 37 °C incubator and left for 7 days 
or 5 min (glucose transport). Solution from the top and bottom compartments was sampled, 
and concentration was quantified by a fluorimeter. Glucose detection kit (ab102617) was 
used to determine the glucose concentrations. For cytokine diffusion studies, media from 48 
h cultured anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-activated splenocytes were collected and placed in the 
top compartment, and fresh medium was placed in the bottom compartment. After 7 day 
incubation at 37 °C, samples from both compartments were collected and quantified using 
mouse 31-plex cytokine Luminex kit.
Cell Culture
Isolation of mouse islets was performed as described.48 Islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Splenocytes were isolated from C57BL/6J 
mice by passing crushed spleen through a filter mesh and cultured in DMEM supplemented 
with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum.
Undifferentiated Mel1INS-GFP cells37 were maintained on mouse embryo fibroblast feeder 
layers (Millipore) in hESC media as described.13 Suspension-based direct differentiations to 
generate hES-βC were carried out as described8 with improvements to the last stage based 
on published reports.36,49
Gene Targeting of Mel1INS-GFP Cells
To generate a cell line that expresses a constitutive firefly luciferase gene, we employed a 
recently published gene-targeting approach of the insulated human AAVS1 loci employing 
TALENs.45 Briefly, we amplified a 6332 bp DNA piece containing all bacterial components, 
both homologies to the human AAVS1 loci, as well as the puromycin resistance gene from 
the Puro-Cas9 donor plasmid (Addgene #58409) and cloned a fragment consisting of a 
peptide cleavage site T2A, followed by the firefly luciferase gene and a poly-A sequence in, 
to recirculate the DNA piece. The resulting plasmid, termed Puro-T2A-Luc donor, was

 sequence verified by sanger sequencing. Confluent Mel1INS-GFP were dissociated to single 
cells, and approximately 8.0 × 106 cells were mixed with 5 µg of each of the TALEN 
plasmids and 20 µg of the Puro-T2A-Luc donor in a 0.4 cm gap electro-cuvette (Biorad). 
Cells were electroporated using a GenePulser (Biorad) using an exponential decay with 250 
V and 500 µF settings. Targeted cells were plated on DR4-resistant MEFs, and clones were 
selected with 0.5 µg/mL puromycin for 4 days. After 11–12 days, individual clones were 
manually picked and expanded before freeze down and genomic DNA analysis. gDNA was 
analyzed with primers for WT and correct Puro integration. WT/Puro forward: CCG GAA 
CTC TGC CCT CTA AC, WT reverse: AGA TGG CTC CAG GAA ATG GG, Puro reverse: 
GTG GGC TTG TAC TCG GTC AT. Mel1INS-GFP,AAVS1-Luc line #3 was used for direct 
differentiation experiments.
Mice
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (NSG) and C57BL/6J mice were obtained from 
Jackson Laboratories. Mice use in this study were maintained according to protocols 
approved by the University of California, San Francisco, Committee on Laboratory Animal 
Resource Center. For kidney capsule grafts, approximately 2.0 × 106 hESC-differentiated 
cells in clusters were transplanted as described.44 For encapsulated grafts, approximately 2.0 
× 106 hESC-differentiated cell clusters encapsulated in a bilaminar nanoporous 
immunoprotective device were transplanted between the caudate and left hepatic lobe. For 
glucose-induced insulin secretion, mice were fasted overnight and serum was collected 
before and 1 h after intraperitoneal administration of 3 g/kg D-glucose solution. Serum C-
peptide levels were quantified by ELISA using a commercially available kit (Alpco).
Flow Cytometric Analysis
Briefly, spheres were collected and allowed to settle by gravity. Clusters were washed once 
in PBS and dissociated by gentle pipetting after 12–15 min incubation in Accumax 
(Innovative Cell Technologies). For flow-based analysis, dissociated cells were fixed with 
4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science) for 15 min at room temperature, 
followed by two washes in PBS. Samples were either stored at 4 °C or immediately stained 
with directly conjugated antibodies. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software. 
NKX6.1-Alexa 647, PDX1-PE were obtained from BD Bioscience, and a human C-peptide 
antibody (Millipore, CHU-09) was in-house conjugated to Alexa 488 fluorophore using a 
commercially available kit (Invitrogen).
Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion
Free and encapsulated hESC-derived spheres were transferred into tubes and washed twice 
with Krebs–Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) containing 2 mM glucose. Samples were 
incubated for 1 h in 2 mM glucose containing KRB to allow equilibration of cells. Two 
millimoles of buffer was removed and replaced with fresh KRB containing 2 mM glucose 
for 30 min followed by incubation for another 30 min in KRB containing 20 mM glucose. 
After the incubation period, buffers were collected for human C-peptide-specific ELISA 
analysis using a commercially available kit (Alpco).

 Immunostaining
Mouse tissue samples were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and 
washed with phosphate buffered saline at 4 °C for 48 h then 30% sucrose for 24 h. Tissue 
samples were embedded in optimal cutting temperature and sectioned for staining. COL1A1, 
F4/80, and vWF antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Antimitochondria 
antibodies were purchased from Millipore.
In Vivo Bioluminescence Imaging
Nanoporous immunoprotective devices encapsulated with luciferase-expressing human 
embryonic cell-derived pancreatic β-like cell clusters (hSC-βC) were implanted between the 
caudate and left hepatic lobes of the liver of NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid IIl2rgtm1Wjl/SxJ (NSG) 
mice. Survival of the encapsulated cells in vivo was assessed by monitoring luciferase 
activity using a Xenogene IVIS 200 imaging system (PerkinElmer). The animals 
transplanted with hSC-βC cells were injected IP with D-luciferin solution (Goldbio, St. 
Louis, MO) at the dose of 150 mg/kg 5 min before imaging to capture the peak in 
bioluminescent intensity. The mice were anesthetized with an isoflurane mixture (2% in 
98% O2) and imaged using a Xenogen IVIS 200 imaging system. Bioluminescence images 
were acquired for 3 min and then analyzed using the Living Image analysis software 
(Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Regions of interest (ROI) were centered over the bioluminescence 
regions. Photons were counted within the ROI over the acquisition time. Adherence to the 
same imaging protocol ensured consistent signal detection on different days of in vivo 
imaging.
Cell Transfer
One day before cell transplantation, mice received violet proliferation dye (VPD-450)-
labeled lymph node (LN) cells from Ub-GFP-OT-1 Tg mice via retro-orbital injection as 
previously described.50 Six days after the transplant, pancreatic draining lymph node and the 
spleen were harvested, and the proliferation of transferred T cells was determined using flow 
cytometry by measuring the dilution of CFSE. A Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, 
San Jose, CA) and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) were used for flow cytometric 
analysis. For sensitization of B57CL/6J mice, OVA-expressing B16 melanoma cells were 
cultured overnight in DMEM with serum washed twice in PBS. Cells were irradiated at 10 
gy, and 20 × 106 cells were injected IP or encapsulated into devices and transplanted into 
each recipient animal.

hESINS-GFP;AAVS1-LUC-βC between liver lobes at day 0 and day 30. (b) Human C-peptide 
concentration in mouse sera after 60 min IP glucose challenge of overnight fasted mice 1 
week and 6 months post-transplantation of NID-encapsulated (NID) or untransplanted mice 
(CTRL) (n = 4 per group). (c) Guman C-peptide concentration in mouse sera after 60 min IP 
glucose challenge of overnight fasted mice 6 months post-transplantation of NID-
encapsulated hESINS-GFP;AAVS1-LUC-βCs (n = 4 per group). (d) Glucose stimulation index 
(GSI) of NID-encapsulated or naked hESINS-GFP;AAVS1-LUC-βCs (CTRL) 6 months post-
transplantation (n = 4 per group). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. (e) Representative 
bioluminescence image of NSG mice transplanted with NID encapsulated 
hESINS-GFP;AAVS1-LUC-βCs after 6 months. (f) Quantification of luciferase bioluminescent 
intensity measured from animals on day 0 and 6 months after encapsulated 
hESINS-GFP;AAVS1-LUC-βCs transplantation. (g) Representative immunofluorescence 
staining of NID-encapsulated hESINS-GFP;AAVS1-LUC-βCs for human C-peptide (C-PEP) 6 
months post-transplantation. Nuclei are visualized by DAPI staining.

In vivo evaluation of immune-isolation by NID encapsulation. (a–f) Wild-type C57BL/6J 
mice were adoptively transferred with 4 × 106 OT1-expressing CD8+ T cells. The following 
day, mice received transplants of either NID-encapsulated or naked B16-OVA cells in the 
peritoneum. Spleen and draining lymph node were harvested 6 days later for analysis. (a) 
Schematic outlining the experimental approach. (b) Representative cell proliferation dye 
dilution graphs of GFP+/CD8+ T cells isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes of control 
mice (CTRL) or naked (IP) or NID-encapsulated (DEV) B16-OVA cells (n = 3 per group). 
(c) Quantification of proliferating antigen-specific T cells isolated from spleens of mice 
from CTRL, IP, and DEV conditions (n = 3 per group). (d) Quantification of proliferating 
antigen-specific T cells isolated from draining lymph nodes of mice from CTRL, IP, and 
DEV conditions (n = 3 per group). (e) Median fluorescence intensity measurement of 
GFP+/CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens of mice from CTRL, IP, and DEV conditions (n = 
3). (f) Median fluorescence intensity measurement of GFP+/CD8+ T cells isolated from 
draining lymph nodes of mice from CTRL, IP, and DEV conditions (n = 3 per group). *P < 
0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.
