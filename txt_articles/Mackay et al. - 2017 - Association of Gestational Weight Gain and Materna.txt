Association of Gestational Weight Gain
and Maternal Body Mass Index in Early Pregnancy
With Risk for Nonaffective Psychosis in Offspring
Euan Mackay, MSc; Christina Dalman, MD, PhD; Håkan Karlsson, PhD; Renee M. Gardner, PhD
IMPORTANCE Prenatal exposure to famine is associated with a 2-fold risk for nonaffective
psychoses. Less is known about whether maternal nutrition states during pregnancy modify
offspring risk for nonaffective psychoses in offspring in well-fed populations.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether gestational weight gain (GWG) during pregnancy and
maternal body mass index (BMI) in early pregnancy are associated with risk for nonaffective
psychoses in offspring.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study used data from
Swedish health and population registers to follow up 526 042 individuals born from January
1, 1982, through December 31, 1989, from 13 years of age until December 31, 2011. Cox
proportional hazards regression models adjusted for socioeconomic status and potential risk
factors were used to examine the risk for developing nonaffective psychoses. Family-based
study designs were used to further test causality. Data were analyzed from February 1 to May
14, 2016.
EXPOSURES Gestational weight gain during pregnancy, maternal body mass index at the first
antenatal visit, and paternal body mass index at the time of conscription into the Swedish
military (at 18 years of age).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hazard ratios (HRs) for the diagnosis of nonaffective
psychoses (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes F20 to F29 and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision [ICD-9] codes 295, 297 and 298, except 298A and 298B) and narrowly defined
schizophrenia (ICD-9 code 295 and ICD-10 code F20).
RESULTS The 526 042 individuals in the cohort (48.52% female and 51.47% male; mean [SD]
age, 26 [2.3] years) included 2910 persons with nonaffective psychoses at the end of
follow-up, of whom 704 had narrowly defined schizophrenia. Among the persons with
nonaffective psychosis, 184 (6.32%) had mothers with extremely inadequate GWG (<8 kg for
mothers with normal baseline BMI), compared with 23 627 (4.52%) of unaffected individuals.
Extremely inadequate GWG was associated with an increased risk for nonaffective psychoses
among offspring in adjusted models (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54) and in matched-sibling
analysis (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.02-2.56). Similar patterns were observed when considering
narrowly defined schizophrenia as the outcome. Maternal mild thinness in early pregnancy
was weakly associated with an increased risk for nonaffective psychosis in offspring (HR for
BMI�17.0 and <18.5, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01-1.45), as was paternal severe thinness (HR for
BMI<16.0, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.26-5.07) in mutually adjusted models. In matched-sibling analysis,
no association was observed between maternal underweight (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.90-2.35),
overweight (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.73-1.68), or obesity (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.23-1.38) and risk for
nonaffective psychosis in offspring.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Inadequate GWG was associated with an increased risk for
nonaffective psychosis in offspring, consistent with historical studies on maternal starvation.
These findings support the role of maternal undernutrition in nonaffective psychosis
pathogenesis.

N
onaffective psychoses, or schizophrenia spectrum dis-
orders, are increasingly considered neurodevelop-
mental disorders.1-5 Prenatal exposure to famine dur-
ing the Dutch Hunger Winter (1944-1945) was associated with
a 2-fold increase in the risk for nonaffective psychosis in
offspring.6-8 Similarly, exposure to prenatal famine during the
Chinese Great Leap Forward (1959-1961) led to a 2-fold in-
creased relative risk for schizophrenia.9,10 Results from such
disparatesettingsdemonstratethatmaternalmalnutritiondur-
ing pregnancy may increase the risk for psychosis among
offspring.11,12
Deficits in maternal nutrition during pregnancy, includ-
ing micronutrient deficiencies (eg, folate, vitamin D, iron) and
protein-caloric malnutrition, have been associated with ab-
normalities in offspring neurodevelopment.11,13 Obesity, para-
doxically, has been associated with deficiencies in nutrients
vital to neurodevelopment, such as vitamin A, folate, vita-
min D, and essential fatty acids,14,15 and offspring risk for neu-
ral tube defects.16 A range of maternal nutritional states dur-
ing pregnancy may contribute to the risk for psychoses in
offspring. Khandaker et al17 reviewed several studies that used
maternal body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in ki-
lograms divided by height in meters squared) as a proxy for
maternalnutrition,buttheseproducedconflictingresultsham-
pered by low numbers of cases.
This study’
s aim was to investigate the association
among maternal baseline BMI, gestational weight gain
(GWG), and offspring risk for nonaffective psychosis in the
largest cohort studied to date. We hypothesize that extremes
in baseline maternal BMI or GWG, signifying suboptimal pre-
natal nutrition, would contribute to an increased risk for non-
affective psychosis in offspring. We posit that extremely low
GWG is analogous to early gestational exposure to starvation
seen in the famine studies. We used 2 family-based study de-
signs—paternal-offspring comparisons and matched-sibling
comparisons18-20—to evaluate the weight of evidence for any
observed associations.
Methods
Study Design
This national, population-based cohort study used data from
Psychiatry Sweden, a linkage of Swedish health and popula-
tion registers.21 Ethical approval was granted by the Regional
Ethical Committee of Stockholm. No informed consent was re-
quired for the analysis of anonymized register data.
Study Population
Thestudypopulationincludedallnonadoptedindividualsborn
in Sweden from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 1989
(n = 798 934), who were followed up from 13 years of age un-
tilDecember31,2011,fordiagnosesofnonaffectivepsychoses.21
Childrenwereexcludedwhodiedoremigratedbeforetheir13th
birthday (2.7%), had incomplete Medical Birth Register data
(0.4%), were missing information on their biological father
(0.5%), or were part of multiple births (1.9%) (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). In addition, 30.2% of eligible mother-child pairs
lacked maternal BMI or GWG data. Those individuals ex-
cluded from the final study population were demographi-
cally similar to those included (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Variables
Diagnoses of Nonaffective Psychoses
Data on psychiatric history were taken from the National Pa-
tient Register, which has been collecting diagnoses for inpa-
tientcaresince1973andpsychiatricoutpatientcaresince2001.
Nonaffective psychosis status was defined as receipt of 1 of the
following diagnoses from International Statistical Classifica-
tion of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision
(ICD-10), or International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-
vision (ICD-9): ICD-10 codes F20 to F29 and ICD-9 codes 295,
297, and 298 (except 298A and 298B) (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment) before December 31, 2011.21 Narrowly defined schizo-
phrenia (ICD-9 code 295 and ICD-10 code F20) was also con-
sidered as an outcome.
Exposure: Maternal BMI and GWG
Maternal weight and height at the first antenatal visit were
used to approximate baseline maternal BMI. Such data were
recorded by midwives in the Medical Birth Register begin-
ning in 1982. The timing of the first antenatal visit was
unavailable. However, first trimester weight gain was on
average low, and 90% of initial antenatal visits in Sweden
occurred before 12 weeks’ gestation.22,23 Weights of less
than 40 kg or greater than 140 kg were censored as unrealis-
tic or indicating an existing medical condition, as were
heights of less than 140 cm or greater than 210 cm. Maternal
baseline BMI values were categorized according to World
Health Organization guidelines24 into standard and
extended BMI classifications.
Maternal weight was also recorded before delivery. Ges-
tational weight gain was calculated as the difference in
maternal weight between the first antenatal visit and deliv-
ery. Based on Institute of Medicine guidelines,25 GWG was cat-
egorized as ideal, inadequate, or excessive according to the
maternalbaselineBMIcategoriesofunderweight (12.5-18.0kg),
normal weight (11.5-16.0 kg), overweight (7.0-11.5 kg), and
Key Points
Question Are gestational weight gain during pregnancy and
maternal body mass index in early pregnancy associated with a
risk for nonaffective psychosis in offspring?
Findings In this population-based cohort study of 526 042
individuals born in Sweden from 1982 through 1989, extremely
inadequate gestational weight gain was associated with a
significantly increased risk for nonaffective psychosis in offspring
in adjusted and sibling comparison models. A weak, U-shaped
association was found between maternal body mass index at the
beginning of pregnancy and risk for nonaffective psychosis in
offspring in adjusted models.
Meaning Insufficient weight gain during pregnancy may increase
the risk for nonaffective disorders in offspring, even in an affluent
and well-nourished population.

obese (5.0-9.0 kg). The GWG categories of inadequate and
excessive were divided at their respective medians (by BMI
category) to create the following 5 extended GWG
categories (eTable 3 in the Supplement): ideal, extremely
inadequate, inadequate, excessive, and extremely excessive.
Exposure: Paternal BMI
Paternal BMI was calculated from Swedish conscription reg-
ister data, collected since 1969. Weight and height were mea-
sured objectively at the time of conscription into the Swedish
military (at 18 years of age). Measurements were censored
and categorized as with maternal BMI. Of the offspring with
maternal BMI data, 64.74% also had paternal BMI data and
are considered as the paternal BMI subcohort (eFigure 1 in
the Supplement).
Covariates
Covariates were considered as potential confounders based
on current literature. The following covariates were in-
cluded in the study and classified as in Blomström et al21:
birth year, offspring sex,3 household income at birth (in
quintiles, with highest quintile as the reference category),26
highest level of parental education achieved, single-parent
household status,26 urban birth (child born in a municipal-
ity with ≥200 000 inhabitants in 1980),27 parental immi-
gration status (categorized as 0-2 parents born outside
Sweden),28 parent older than 35 years at the time of birth
(0-2 parents),29 parental nonaffective psychosis diagnosis
(0-2 parents), and parental history of psychiatric care (0-2
parents).30
Statistical Analysis
BMI and Nonaffective Psychoses
Data were analyzed from February 1 to May 14, 2016. Statis-
tical analyses were performed using STATA/IC software
(version 14.1; StataCorp). We analyzed BMI as a categorical
variable, then a continuous variable, using Cox proportional
hazards regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
CIs for nonaffective psychosis (or schizophrenia) in off-
spring with robust SEs to account for clustering of observa-
tions with mothers. Offspring were followed up from 13
years of age until the diagnosis of nonaffective psychosis,
emigration, death, or December 31, 2011, whichever came
first. Basic HRs were adjusted for birth year and sex of off-
spring. The final model for BMI was adjusted for birth year,
offspring sex, family income quintile, parent older than 35
years, parental history of nonaffective psychosis, and parent
born outside Sweden. Parental educational level was not
included in the model owing to colinearity with income
quintile. Normal BMI was the reference category in categori-
cal analyses. Categorical analyses were repeated with
extended BMI categories.
For continuous analyses, we fit Cox proportional hazards
regression models using restricted cubic splines with 5 knots.
Restricted cubic spline models allow for the flexible fitting of
nonmonotonic associations between variables.31 Postestima-
tion xbrcspline31 was used, with the reference category set as
BMI of 21.0, denoting minimal risk.22
GWG and Nonaffective Psychoses
Similar to BMI, GWG was also analyzed as a categorical (ref-
erence category, ideal GWG) and continuous (reference cat-
egory, 11kg)variable.Modelswereadjustedasdescribedabove
for BMI. Additional models considered maternal baseline BMI
and gestational age as covariates. Continuous analysis was re-
peated with stratification by maternal BMI category.
Sibling Analyses
Matched-sibling analyses comparing affected individuals with
their unaffected full siblings were performed to investigate
whether observed associations among maternal BMI and GWG
andoffspringnonaffectivepsychosiscouldbetheresultofcon-
founding by shared familial factors. Narrowly defined schizo-
phrenia was not considered as an outcome in sibling analyses
owing to lack of power. Cox proportional hazards regression,
stratified by family identity, was performed for matched full
siblings, discordant on outcome, adjusted for birth order and
sex. We considered BMI and GWG as categorical and continu-
ous exposures as above.
Sensitivity Analyses
Analyses of maternal and paternal BMI were repeated among
those individuals with a paternal BMI observation (paternal
BMI subcohort) and were analyzed individually as above and
in a mutually adjusted model. Finally, the main analyses were
repeated stratified by sex.
Results
Study Cohorts
The 526 042 individuals in the study cohort (48.52% female
and 51.47% male; mean [SD] age, 26 [2.3] years) included 2910
cases of nonaffective psychoses at the end of follow-up. As ex-
pected,offspringwhodevelopednonaffectivepsychosisornar-
rowly defined schizophrenia were more likely to be male and
to be born in an urban center or to a single parent, an immi-
grant, or a parent with a history of psychiatric care compared
with unaffected offspring (Table 1 and eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment). In the paternal BMI subcohort, offspring were less likely
to have a foreign-born parent compared with the full cohort
and were less likely to have a parent 35 years or older, be-
cause the conscription register began in 1969 (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Covariates by maternal BMI and GWG catego-
ries are presented in eTables 5 and 6 in the Supplement.
Maternal BMI and Nonaffective Psychosis Risk
In the categorical analysis (Table 2), offspring of underweight
mothers displayed a somewhat increased risk for nonaffec-
tive psychosis (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30). In the
analysis of extended BMI categories, offspring of mothers with
mild thinness (BMI≥17.0 and <18.5) had an increased risk for
nonaffective psychosis (adjusted HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.39),
as did offspring of mothers with class 2 obesity (BMI≥35.0 and
<40.0; adjusted HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.00-3.71).

nonaffective psychosis among offspring in crude or adjusted
models, although with wide CIs. Maternal underweight was
usually associated with schizophrenia; no association was ap-
parent between elevated maternal BMI and schizophrenia risk
(Figure 1). In matched-sibling analyses, we found little appar-
ent association between maternal BMI and offspring nonaf-
fective psychosis in categorical (Table 2) or continuous analy-
sis (Figure 1).
GWG and Nonaffective Psychosis Risk
Normal-weight and underweight mothers were more likely to
gain weight within their recommended ranges (44.59% and
56.52%,respectively),comparedwithoverweight(26.91%)and
obese (34.20%) mothers (eTable 7 in the Supplement). Broad
GWG categories were not associated with offspring nonaffec-
tive psychosis (Table 3). For extended GWG categories, the off-
spring of mothers with extremely inadequate weight gain had

for the normal-weight and overweight or obese groups
(BMI≥25.0), but not for the underweight group.
In the matched-sibling analysis, the risk for nonaffected
psychosis increased for offspring born to mothers with ex-
tremelyinadequateGWG(HR,1.61;95%CI,1.02-2.56)(Table3).
In continuous analysis, a similar finding was observed, al-
though the CIs were wide and included 1 (Figure 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
In the analysis of paternal BMI, we observed an increased risk
fornonaffectivepsychosisamongtheoffspringofseverelythin
fathers (BMI<16.0; adjusted HR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.26-5.04)
(eTable 8 in the Supplement) and a weak, U-shaped associa-
tion between paternal BMI and nonaffective psychosis in off-
spring in continuous analysis, a pattern comparable with that
of maternal BMI (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). The associa-
tionbetweenmaternalobesityandtheriskfornonaffectivepsy-
chosis in offspring was strengthened by adjusting for pater-
nal BMI, although the CIs remained wide (eFigure 4 and eTable
8 in the Supplement). In mutually adjusted models, maternal
mild thinness in early pregnancy was weakly associated with
an increased risk for nonaffective psychosis in offspring (HR
for BMI≥17.0 and <18.5, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01-1.45), as was pater-
nal severe thinness (HR for BMI<16.0, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.26-
5.07).
After stratification by sex (eTables 9 and 10 in the
Supplement), maternal mild thinness was associated with
nonaffective psychosis in male (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10-1.55)
but not female (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.91-1.43) offspring.
Extremely inadequate GWG was associated with risk for
psychosis in male (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.07-1.63) and female
(HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.01) offspring but was more pro-
nounced in the latter.
Discussion
Key Results
Extremely inadequate GWG was associated with an in-
creased risk for nonaffective psychosis in offspring in categori-
cal and continuous analyses, even after adjustment for poten-
tial confounders. The sibling analysis suggests that this result
is unlikely to be attributable to unmeasured familial confound-
ing.Togethertheseresultsindicate,similarlytotheDutchHun-
ger Winter and Great Leap Forward studies,7-9 that inad-
equate maternal nutrition during pregnancy increases the risk
for nonaffective psychosis in offspring, even in the context of
an affluent and well-nourished population.
This study also demonstrated a weak U-shaped associa-
tion between maternal BMI at the beginning of pregnancy and

as a combined proxy for prepregnancy BMI and GWG, obscur-
ing the contribution of each.
Highmaternalprepregnancy33,34andlatepregnancy35BMI
have also been linked to psychosis in offspring. We observed
a 2-fold increased risk associated with maternal obesity (class
2) and an elevated risk for obesity and its subclasses. The re-
sults of our family comparison studies indicate that the asso-
ciations between maternal BMI and the risk for nonaffective
psychosis in offspring are at least partly confounded by ge-
netic or other shared familial factors. The only study to date
considering a potential correlation between genetic determi-
nants of BMI and the risk for schizophrenia reported an in-
verse association: evidence of genetic correlation between low
BMI and risk for schizophrenia.36
We observed a greater effect for female offspring of moth-
ers with extremely inadequate GWG compared with male off-
spring, but effect estimates overlapped between the sexes. The
initial Dutch famine study reported a similar sex effect,8 but
this difference was not apparent in a later, more rigorous
analysis.6 Our result merits cautious interpretation owing to
the relative youth of our cohort and the differential age at on-
set for male and female offspring.37

result from inadequate GWG, although other factors also con-
tribute. Small size for gestational age has also been linked to
an increased risk for nonaffective psychosis.41,42
Severely inadequate GWG may otherwise be indicative of
an existing maternal medical condition, such as endrocrino-
logic disorders, malabsorption, anorexia nervosa, bulimia ner-
vosa, or hyperemesis gravidarum. Further research is neces-
sarytounderstandtheassociationbetweenconditionsthatlead
to insufficient maternal weight gain and the risk for nonaffec-
tive psychosis in offspring. Insufficient weight gain can also
occur in otherwise healthy individuals owing to insufficient
medical guidance or by a drive to conform to societal (but not
medical) standards of appropriate weight gain.43
Strengths
This study is, to our knowledge, the largest to date to exam-
ine the association of maternal BMI and the risk for psychosis
in offspring and the first to examine the role of GWG. The large
sample size facilitated the use of family-based study designs
for more rigorous inference of causation.20,44 We calculated
BMI and GWG from objectively measured, prospectively re-
corded register data. Swedish registry data on nonaffective
diagnoses have high validity.45
We were able to adjust GWG for gestational age. Gesta-
tional weight gain and gestational age are highly correlated,
with inadequate GWG associated with preterm births and low
birth weights.23,46 Accounting for parental psychosis like-
wise strengthened our results. Nonaffective psychoses are
highly heritable,47,48 and traditional antipsychotics can lead
to pronounced weight gain.49
Limitations
One issue is the limited follow-up time: ages of offspring at the
end of follow-up varied from 22 to 29 years. Nonaffective psy-
choses manifest typically from the third decade of life
onward.50 As such, our sample is considerably right cen-
sored. Although we statistically accounted for this, we may
have captured more early-onset, possibly phenotypically dis-
tinct cases, which limits generalizability.17 Future studies will
allow for reanalysis as the cohort continues to age. Another
limitation is the rate of missing BMI and GWG in the eligible
study population, although these data seem to be missing at
random from the Medical Birth Register.22
Paternal BMI at conscription was used to examine the in-
dependence of any observable effect of maternal BMI on non-
affective psychosis among offspring.18-20 Paternal BMI was un-
available for any later time points. Using paternal BMI at 18
years of age allowed for exploration of the contribution of pa-
ternal factors to nonaffective psychosis in offspring while re-
moving the effects of the shared parental environment at the
time of pregnancy. Increasing paternal age is related to in-
creased BMI and increased risk for nonaffective psychosis in
offspring. By capturing BMI at the same age for all fathers, we
avoided potential confounding owing to these associations.22
Sibling comparisons were used to test for unmeasured fa-
milial confounding. Using sibling analysis in extended catego-
ries for a rare outcome reduced power, possibly obscuring true
associations. Also, in discordant sibling design, only mothers
who varied in BMI or GWG between their 2 index pregnancies
contribute to effect estimates; such designs are susceptible to
confounding by nonshared factors that might lead to such
changes in the same mother.44
We improve on the Dutch and Chinese famine studies by
using individual measures of parental BMI and GWG as prox-
ies for nutrition in place of population-level measures of star-
vation. However, BMI and GWG are incomplete representa-
tions of metabolic health and nutritional intake and cannot
discount other mechanisms of action. We were also limited by
the small number of mothers at the extremes of BMI catego-
ries.
Last, we recognize the dissonance of applying Institute of
Medicine 2009 GWG guidelines to mothers in the 1980s. Using
the rationale of Holowko et al,51 we believe the guidelines rep-
resent optimal maternal and child health outcomes, regard-
less of advice at the time. Our study seemingly validates the
2009 guidelines for mothers with BMI in the normal range, be-
cause ideal GWG conferred the lowest risk. However, off-
spring of overweight and obese women showed an elevated
risk for nonaffective psychosis, even at the lower end of the
Institute of Medicine ideal GWG range, potentially raising the
question of the adequacy of weight gain guidelines for popu-
lations outside the normal BMI range, specifically for nonob-
stetric outcomes.46,52-54
Conclusions
Our results corroborate evidence from previous research and
indicate that inadequate weight gain during pregnancy con-
tributes to the risk for nonaffective psychosis in offspring.
Weight gain outside Institute of Medicine guidelines may have
deleterious effects on offspring neurodevelopment.

Invited Commentary
Prenatal Nutritional Deficiency and Psychosis
Where Do We Go From Here?
Ezra Susser, MD, DrPH; Katherine M. Keyes, PhD
In this issue of JAMA Psychiatry, Mackay et al1 report that ex-
tremely inadequate gestational weight gain is linked to non-
affective psychosis in offspring. This result is concordant with
several previous studies2 designed as natural experiments that
linkedprenatalmaternalfam-
ine to offspring nonaffective
psychosis. The present study,
based on Swedish national
registries, represents a substantial advance by providing evi-
dence that a similar association is detectable among individu-
als in a generally well-fed population in more ordinary cir-
cumstances. Also notable, the study included strengths of
design not possible in the natural experiments, such as rigor-
ous control for parental psychiatric conditions and compari-
son of affected and unaffected siblings. Thus, it contributes to
an increasingly robust body of convergent evidence for a role
of prenatal nutritional deficiency in the early origins of psy-
chosis and strengthens the argument for examining prenatal
nutritional supplements and dietary patterns as a means of
prevention.
Anotherstrengthisthatthestudyhighlightspuzzlingques-
tionsthathaveyettoberesolved.Whywastheassociationwith
psychosis robust only at the extreme of low weight gain? Why
did the investigators find no association of high or low early
prenatal body mass index with psychosis, contrary to prevail-
ing views and some prior reports on schizophrenia and other
neurodevelopmental disorders?
Inevitably, the study also had limitations. For example, the
timing of nutritional deficiency could not be specified using
registrydata,resultswereinconclusiveattheextremesofbody
mass index, and the potential role of maternal stress as a co-
factor could not be examined. These limitations should be
noted but without losing sight of the authors’substantial
achievements.
In this commentary, we focus henceforth on how we could
build on the convergent evidence to identify mechanisms and
preventive interventions for nonaffective psychoses and other
neurodevelopmental disorders that fall within the domain of
psychiatry. Studies of extreme prenatal exposures remain use-
ful but not sufficient to reach these goals. We propose that the
endeavor requires a guiding framework that embraces mutu-
ally informative lines of investigation being conducted in tan-
dem. Given limited space, we hope to spark discussion of this
framework by focusing on 2 of the central challenges and how
they might be overcome.
The first challenge is that translational science is gener-
ally presented as a linear progression, with knowledge trans-
ferredfrombasicsciencetoclinicalresearch(step1),fromclini-
cal research to clinical care (step 2), and from clinical care to
implementation of public health interventions (step 3). For
more than 50 years, however, studies of prenatal nutritional
deficiencies and neurodevelopmental disorders have
followed a more circuitous route and holistic bridging of
disciplines.2 Studies have been performed in tandem at many
levels and have informed one another, including natural ex-
periments based on tragic historical famines, discoveries in ba-
sic sciences such as genomics and epigenetics, trials of prena-
talmicronutrients,clinicalresearch,andepidemiologicstudies
of risk factors. The interplay has generated hypotheses about
mechanisms, such as epigenetic effects and de novo muta-
tions, and supported studies of preventive effects of micro-
nutrients. At present, evidence is being sought for preventive
effects of periconceptional folic acid, prenatal choline supple-
mentation, and prenatal vitamin D, and all these efforts are
grounded in basic science, animal studies, epidemiologic stud-
ies, and clinical research. We propose that translational sci-
ence as a linear progression is not an appropriate framework
forresearchonprenatalnutritionandneurodevelopmentaldis-
orders. Instead, this field should adhere to a conceptual frame-
work that explicitly promotes multiple levels of inquiry pro-
ceeding in parallel and not in isolation from one another. We
should also encourage cross-level research, exemplified by an
investigation by Roffman et al3 that compares neuroimaging
data for children and adolescents born before, during, and af-
tertherolloutoffolatefortificationoffoodintheUnitedStates.
Such multileveled and cross-disciplinary efforts fit concep-
tual frameworks of ecoepidemiology and population health
science,4,5 in which there is an interplay between macro and
