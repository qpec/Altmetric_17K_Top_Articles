ABSTRACT
Antibiotic resistance is a growing crisis and a grave threat to human
health. It is projected that antibiotic-resistant infections will lead to 10 million annual
deaths worldwide by the year 2050. Among the most significant threats are
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), including carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae (CRKP), which lead to mortality rates as high as 40 to 50%. Few treatment
options are available to treat CRKP, and the polymyxin antibiotic colistin is often the
“
last-line” therapy. However, resistance to colistin is increasing. Here, we identify
multidrug-resistant, carbapenemase-positive CRKP isolates that were classified as suscep-
tible to colistin by clinical diagnostics yet harbored a minor subpopulation of phenotypi-
cally resistant cells. Within these isolates, the resistant subpopulation became predomi-
nant after growth in the presence of colistin but returned to baseline levels after
subsequent culture in antibiotic-free media. This indicates that the resistance was phe-
notypic, rather than due to a genetic mutation, consistent with heteroresistance. Impor-
tantly, colistin therapy was unable to rescue mice infected with the heteroresistant
strains. These findings demonstrate that colistin heteroresistance may cause in vivo treat-
ment failure during K. pneumoniae infection, threatening the use of colistin as a last-line
treatment for CRKP. Furthermore, these data sound the alarm for use of caution in inter-
preting colistin susceptibility test results, as isolates identified as susceptible may in fact
resist antibiotic therapy and lead to unexplained treatment failures.
IMPORTANCE
This is the first report of colistin-heteroresistant K. pneumoniae in the
United States. Two distinct isolates each led to colistin treatment failure in an in vivo
model of infection. The data are worrisome, especially since the colistin heteroresis-
tance was not detected by current diagnostic tests. As these isolates were carbap-
enem resistant, clinicians might turn to colistin as a last-line therapy for infections
caused by such strains, not knowing that they in fact harbor a resistant subpopula-
tion of cells, potentially leading to treatment failure. Our findings warn that colistin
susceptibility testing results may be unreliable due to undetected heteroresistance
and highlight the need for more accurate and sensitive diagnostics.

 including urinary tract, bloodstream, and soft tissue infections (3). Carbapenem-
resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is one of the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacte-
riaceae (CRE), an emerging cause of antibiotic-resistant, health care-associated infec-
tions. CRE were listed as one of the most urgent antibiotic resistance threats by the CDC
and WHO (4, 5). In part due to the difficulty of effectively treating infections with CRE,
mortality rates can be as high as 40 to 50% (6). These infections are a worldwide
problem, with recent reports indicating that CRE are widespread in the United States
(7), Europe (8), and China (9). Unfortunately, resistance to “last-line” drugs, such as
colistin, is emerging in CRKP strains, and in some cases, isolates are resistant to all
antibiotics tested (10). Here, we describe the identification of two multidrug-resistant
CRKP isolates exhibiting colistin heteroresistance, a phenomenon in which only a minor
subpopulation of genetically identical cells is phenotypically resistant. Since the fre-
quency of the resistant subpopulation is exceedingly low in these isolates, they are not
detected as being colistin resistant by clinical diagnostic tests.
Two CRKP urine isolates (Mu9 and Mu156) were collected from different patients in
Atlanta, GA, area hospitals as part of the Multi-site Gram-Negative Surveillance Initiative
(MuGSI), a nationwide surveillance network for CRE hospital isolates. Isolates were
grown from single colonies and frozen at �80°
C prior to the study. Mu9 and Mu156
were confirmed as being genetically distinct by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (using
XbaI-digested total DNA and separated by electrophoresis on a Chef-DR III apparatus
[Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA] at 200 V [6 V/cm] with a 90-s switch time for 23 h)
(data not shown). Both isolates were resistant to nearly all antibiotics tested, including
all carbapenems and some aminoglycosides (see Table S1 in the supplemental mate-
rial). PCR for various resistance genes revealed several beta-lactamases in each isolate,
including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) in both strains (Table S2). Colistin
susceptibility testing by broth microdilution (11) in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton
(MH) broth (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using colistin sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) (MIC of 0.5 �g/ml) and the colistin Etest (BioMérieux, Marcy-l’
Étoile, France),
performed on MH agar (Remel, San Diego, CA) (MIC � 0.125), classified both strains as
susceptible to colistin (Fig. 1A). Subsequent examination for susceptibility was per-
formed via population analysis profile (PAP) by plating serial dilutions of bacteria on MH
agar (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) containing various concentrations of colistin.
PAP revealed the presence of a minor colistin-resistant subpopulation in each isolate
that actively grew on antibiotic up to a concentration of 100 �g/ml. The colistin-
resistant subpopulation was present at between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 1,000,000 CFU at
doses of colistin ranging from 2 to 100 �g/ml (Fig. 1B). In contrast, PAP demonstrated
that all the cells of a colistin-susceptible control isolate, GA65146, were killed by
2 �g/ml of colistin (Fig. 1B).
It was concerning that broth microdilution and the Etest were unable to detect the
colistin-resistant subpopulations in these isolates. The recommended incubation time
for both tests is 24 h (11, 12). Extension of the incubation time to 48 h resulted in the
accurate identification of resistance by broth microdilution (Fig. S1A), likely because the
minor resistant subpopulation had more time to grow out. In contrast, the increased
incubation time had no effect on Etest results, which remained negative (Fig. S1B).
We next studied the dynamics of the resistant subpopulation following colistin
treatment. After treatment with 100 �g/ml colistin, the frequency of the resistant
subpopulation was significantly increased in each isolate. Subsequent passage in an
antibiotic-free medium greatly decreased the frequency of the resistant subpopulation
(Fig. S2), suggesting that this population was phenotypically resistant and not the result
of a stable genetic mutation. Additionally, this suggests that there is some disadvan-
tage to maintaining a majority colistin-resistant subpopulation. Indeed, it has been
previously shown that colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae confers a fitness defect (13).
To directly assess whether the resistant and susceptible subpopulations were geneti-
cally homogenous, we isolated cultures with majority resistant or susceptible subpopu-
lations by subculturing them in medium containing 16 �g/ml colistin or drug-free
medium, respectively (Fig. 1C). This resulted in cultures containing �95% colistin-

 resistant cells or �95% colistin-susceptible cells (Fig. 1C). We then performed genomic
sequencing on both populations using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer for a depth
of coverage of �1,000�, revealing that the resistant and susceptible subpopulations
were indeed genetically identical, consistent with heteroresistance.
To investigate the phenotypic differences between the resistant and susceptible
subpopulations, we quantified the expression of two genes in the PhoPQ two-
component system pathway, which is known to mediate colistin resistance in K. pneu-
moniae. MgrB is a negative regulator of PhoPQ signaling (14), and mgrB expression was
lower in resistant cells cultured in colistin than in susceptible cells grown in drug-free
medium (Fig. 1D). Additionally, expression of phoP, which is autoinduced when the
PhoPQ system is active (15), was increased in colistin-resistant cells of Mu9 compared
to its expression in susceptible cells, although this was not observed in Mu156 (Fig. 1E).
Taken together, these data are consistent with involvement of the PhoPQ pathway in
the resistant subpopulations of both Mu9 and Mu156.
It was unclear whether the minor colistin-resistant subpopulations present in these
isolates would have an effect on the outcome of colistin treatment during an in vivo
infection. To assess the in vivo relevance of the colistin-resistant subpopulations, we
used a mouse model of peritonitis (done in accordance with IACUC protocol #4000046).
We infected mice (C57BL/6J; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) intraperitoneally with
a lethal dose (3 � 108 CFU) of either of the heteroresistant K. pneumoniae isolates and
subsequently left the mice untreated or treated them with colistin after 12 h (20 mg
colistin methanesulfonate/kg of body weight [Chem Impex, Wood Dale, IL], given
intraperitoneally every 6 h) to simulate infection and subsequent treatment upon
clinical presentation. Interestingly, even in the absence of colistin, the frequency of the
resistant subpopulations of both heteroresistant isolates increased following 24 h of
in vivo infection compared to the frequency produced by the inoculum (Fig. 2A). This
may be due to cross-resistance of these cells to host innate immune antimicrobials,
such as antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, as has previously been
demonstrated (16). We next assessed the impact of heteroresistance on colistin treat-
ment outcome. Mice infected with the colistin-susceptible strain (GA65146) succumbed
to infection in the absence of antibiotic but were rescued by colistin treatment (Fig. 2B).
In contrast, mice infected with either of the heteroresistant isolates (Mu9 or Mu156)
were unable to survive the infection, even in the presence of colistin (Fig. 2C and D).
These data strikingly demonstrate that colistin heteroresistance can lead to in vivo
colistin treatment failure for CRKP.
Concluding remarks. This is the first report of colistin-heteroresistant K. pneu-
moniae in the United States. In highly resistant CRE isolates, colistin is a vital last-line
treatment option. We show here that in a mouse model of infection, colistin-
heteroresistant CRKP isolates fail colistin therapy. This stresses the need to assess the
relevance of colistin heteroresistance on the outcome of colistin therapy in human
infection, which has yet to be determined.
When highly resistant CRKP strains are isolated in the clinic, testing of last-line
antibiotics identifies crucial treatment options. Colistin-heteroresistant isolates, such as
the ones reported here, can be misclassified as colistin susceptible, a “very major
discrepancy”according to FDA susceptibility testing guidelines (17). Subsequent treat-
ment of these isolates with colistin may then lead to unexplained treatment failure, as
was demonstrated in our in vivo mouse model. Thus, the misclassification of colistin
susceptibility status wastes critical time and resources and may lead to further infection
complications and patient mortality. Clinical laboratories should consider testing for
heteroresistance to colistin if this last-line antibiotic is required for treatment. Unfor-
tunately, the current standard test for heteroresistance, the population analysis profile,
is time- and labor-intensive, and it is cumbersome for most clinical laboratories to
implement. Our findings suggest that broth microdilution with an increased incubation
time (48 h) may detect colistin heteroresistance. However, the increased incubation
time is a downside in itself, and there is also an increased chance that a culture of

 susceptible bacteria will become contaminated or that de novo mutant cells will have
the time necessary to grow out, leading to an inaccurate identification as resistant.
Therefore, novel diagnostics that rapidly and accurately detect colistin heteroresistance
are needed.
Taken together, these findings serve to sound the alarm about a worrisome and
underappreciated phenomenon in CRKP infections and highlight the need for more
sensitive and accurate diagnostics. We suggest that clinical microbiologists and clini-
cians alike use caution when treating CRKP infections with colistin.
