IMPORTANCE The natural history and the management of patients with asymptomatic aortic
stenosis (AS) have not been fully examined in the current era.
OBJECTIVE To determine the clinical outcomes of patients with asymptomatic AS using data
from the Heart Valve Clinic International Database.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This registry was assembled by merging data from
prospectively gathered institutional databases from 10 heart valve clinics in Europe, Canada,
and the United States. Asymptomatic patients with an aortic valve area of 1.5 cm2 or less and
preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 50% at entry were considered
for the present analysis. Data were collected from January 2001 to December 2014, and data
were analyzed from January 2017 to July 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Natural history, need for aortic valve replacement (AVR),
and survival of asymptomatic patients with moderate or severe AS at entry followed up in a
heart valve clinic. Indications for AVR were based on current guideline recommendations.
RESULTS Of the 1375 patients included in this analysis, 834 (60.7%) were male, and the mean
(SD) age was 71 (13) years. A total of 861 patients (62.6%) had severe AS (aortic valve area
less than 1.0 cm2). The mean (SD) overall survival during medical management (mean [SD]
follow up, 27 [24] months) was 93% (1%), 86% (2%), and 75% (4%) at 2, 4, and 8 years,
respectively. A total of 104 patients (7.6%) died under observation, including 57 patients
(54.8%) from cardiovascular causes. The crude rate of sudden death was 0.65% over the
duration of the study. A total of 542 patients (39.4%) underwent AVR, including 388 patients
(71.6%) with severe AS at study entry and 154 (28.4%) with moderate AS at entry who
progressed to severe AS. Those with severe AS at entry who underwent AVR did so at a mean
(SD) of 14.4 (16.6) months and a median of 8.7 months. The mean (SD) 2-year and 4-year
AVR-free survival rates for asymptomatic patients with severe AS at baseline were 54% (2%)
and 32% (3%), respectively. In those undergoing AVR, the 30-day postprocedural mortality
was 0.9%. In patients with severe AS at entry, peak aortic jet velocity (greater than 5 m/s) and
LVEF (less than 60%) were associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality without
AVR; these factors were also associated with postprocedural mortality in those patients with
severe AS at baseline who underwent AVR (surgical AVR in 310 patients; transcatheter AVR in
78 patients).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with asymptomatic AS followed up in heart valve
centers, the risk of sudden death is low, and rates of overall survival are similar to those
reported from previous series. Patients with severe AS at baseline and peak aortic jet velocity
of 5.0 m/s or greater or LVEF less than 60% have increased risks of all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality even after AVR. The potential benefit of early intervention should be
considered in these high-risk patients.

 I
n the western world, calcific aortic stenosis (AS), the most
common valvular heart disease, represents a major public
healthburden.1Currently,thereisnopharmacologicaltreat-
ment that prevents or slows the progression of AS.2 Surgical
aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve
replacement (TAVR) are the only therapies to significantly im-
prove both survival and symptoms3,4 and are recommended
in symptomatic patients with severe AS.5,6 The management
of patients with asymptomatic severe AS, particularly the
choice between early intervention vs watchful waiting, con-
tinues to be a matter of debate.7,8 Current guidelines advo-
cate delaying AVR until symptoms or left ventricular (LV) sys-
tolic dysfunction develop.5,6 However, observational studies
in 20109 and 201510 have suggested that early elective AVR
might improve outcomes in patients with severe asymptom-
atic AS. This approach has been reinforced by continued ad-
vances in surgical techniques and aortic valve prostheses, the
advent of TAVR, and the low perioperative mortality and mor-
bidity rates achieved in valve centers of reference.11,12 How-
ever, preemptive surgery before onset of symptoms or LV sys-
tolic dysfunction is considered in only a selected group of
patients after careful risk stratification. This is at least in part
because the evidence for intervention in asymptomatic se-
vere AS is derived from small, heterogeneous, retrospective,
single-center studies, which have generally included the need
for AVR (not always motivated by the development of symp-
toms or LV dysfunction) in the composite study end point.13-20
Moreover, decision making for AVR remains particularly dif-
ficult in older patients in whom it is sometimes unclear if the
benefits of intervention outweigh the risk.5,6
In recent years, the establishment of multidisciplinary
services delivered by experts in valvular heart disease has
become the basis for the implementation of heart valve
clinics.21 These clinics provide standardized care based on
international evidence-based norms and facilitate large
clinical registries, which may be used to further refine
guideline recommendations and quality improvement. The
Heart Valve Clinic International Database (HAVEC) is a mul-
ticenter registry created for prospective data collection of
patients with echocardiographic confirmation of AS and
other valve diseases.22 The objective of the present study
was to determine the natural history and outcomes of
patients with moderate or severe AS who are followed up in
a heart valve clinic.
Methods
The data, analytic methods, and study materials can be
made available to other researchers for purposes of repro-
ducing the results or replicating the procedure after
approval of the HAVEC group. Data are centrally collected at
the Department of Cardiology, Centre Hospitalier Universi-
taire du Sart Tilman, Liège, Belgium. This retrospective
analysis of clinically acquired data was approved by the
respective institutional review boards of each participating
center, and informed consent was waived because collected
data were deidentified and retrospective.
Study Population
The HAVEC registry was assembled by merging data from pro-
spectively gathered electronic institutional databases of
10 heart valve clinics, as defined by the European Society
of Cardiology Working Group in Valvular Heart Diseases,13 col-
lected between 2001 and 2014. The analyses were then per-
formed retrospectively. Patients were eligible for this registry
if they had AS diagnosed with the use of 2-dimension echo-
cardiography at 1 of the participating centers and were fol-
lowed-up according to available guidelines on a regular basis.
Exclusion criteria included aortic valve area (AVA) greater than
1.5 cm2; class I indications for AVR (rest AS–related or exer-
cise AS–related symptoms [ie, angina, syncope, and dysp-
nea] or LV ejection fraction [EF] less than 50%); concomitant
congenital heart valve disease more than mild mitral, tricus-
pid,orpulmonicvalvedisease;orpriorvalvesurgery.Thestudy
was conducted in accordance with the respective institu-
tional guidelines, national legal requirements, and the re-
vised Helsinki declaration.23
Doppler Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed as part of rou-
tineclinicalpracticeusingcommerciallyavailablesystems.The
severity of AS was evaluated according to standard methods.
Peak aortic jet velocity was derived from transaortic flow, re-
corded with continuous wave Doppler using a multiwindow
approach. Peak and mean gradients were calculated using the
simplified Bernoulli equation. The continuity equation was
used to calculate AVA. Moderate and severe AS were defined
as an AVA between 1.0 and 1.5 cm2 and less than 1.0 cm2, re-
spectively. Left ventricular EF was estimated by the Simpson
biplane method.
Follow-up
Follow-up was organized within each participating center ac-
cording to available guidelines (every 6-12 months in patients
with severe AS) (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Data collection
started after baseline evaluation until last available contact or
death. Follow-up data were obtained by direct patient inter-
view and clinical examination; telephone calls with physi-
cians, patients, or next of kin; or review of autopsy records and
Key Points
Question What is the outcome of patients with asymptomatic
aortic stenosis (AS) followed up in a specialized heart valve clinic?
Findings In this study using data from the Heart Valve Clinic
International Database including 1375 patients from 10 heart valve
clinics, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 60% and peak
aortic jet velocity greater than 5 m/s were independent factors
associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients
with asymptomatic severe AS. The adverse association of these
factors with survival remains significant following aortic valve
replacement, suggesting the need for earlier intervention.
Meaning Taking into consideration the low procedural risk
associated with aortic valve replacement, the potential benefit of
earlier intervention should be considered in high-risk patients with
asymptomatic severe AS.

 death certificates. Information was collected regarding devel-
opment of cardiac symptoms, subsequent AVR (performed for
development of guideline indications: symptom onset, ab-
normal exercise test, peak aortic velocity greater than 5.5 m/s,
or rapid progression of AS severity), and death.24 Exercise test-
ing was performed in selected patients (572 of 1375 patients
[41.6%]), especially when the symptomatic status was un-
clear. Cardiac deaths were classified as directly related to AS
(ie, sudden death or heart failure) or to other cardiac pathol-
ogy (ie, fatal myocardial infarction). All-cause mortality was
theprimaryendpointofthestudy;cardiovascular-relatedmor-
tality was the secondary end point. Follow-up echocardiog-
raphy data were obtained in all patients who underwent AVR
to confirm the progression of moderate to severe AS (ie, AVA
less than 1 cm2).
Statistical Analysis
Data are reported as means with standard deviations for con-
tinuous variables or numbers and percentages of individuals
for categorical variables. Group comparisons for categorical
variables were obtained with χ2 test and for continuous vari-
ables with Mann-Whitney U test if the normality of data was
violated based on a Shapiro-Wilk test. Analyses of overall and
cardiovascular mortality were performed by censoring data at
the time of AVR. Multivariable analysis was then performed
by including covariates selected on the basis of their known
link to outcome in patients with AS (ie, age, sex, comorbidi-
ties, AS severity, and LVEF) into a Cox proportional hazard
model. Peak aortic jet velocity (greater than or equal to 5 m/s)
and LVEF (less than 60%) were also expressed as categorical
variables.6,25 Survival curves were computed based on the Ka-
plan-Meier method. Regarding the prediction of all-cause and
cardiovascular death, receiver operating characteristic curve
analyses were performed, and areas under the curve (AUCs)
were reported. The most accurate cutoff values (ie, best com-
promise between sensitivity and specificity) were obtained
using Youden index. A P value less than .05 was considered
statistically significant, and all P values were 2-tailed. Statis-
tical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23 (IBM).
Results
A total of 1763 patients were included in the present regis-
try, of whom 388 (22.0%) were excluded because of missing
data regarding LVEF or AS severity. The characteristics of
the remaining 1375 patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria
are described in Table 1. The mean (SD; range) AVA was 0.94
(0.3; 0.30-1.50) cm2 and was less than 1 cm2 in 861 patients
(62.6%) (Table 1).

 Outcome During Medical Management
Clinical follow-up information for patients in the 10 centers is
shown in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. Echocardiographic data re-
garding the rate of progression of initially moderate to severe
AS were not routinely available, although severe AS was docu-
mented in all patients with moderate AS at baseline who un-
derwent AVR during follow-up. The mean (SD; range) fol-
low-up time was 27 (24; 2-224) months. A total of 542 patients
(39.4%) required AVR (SAVR, 429 [79.2%]; TAVR, 113 [20.8%]).
The 2-year, 4-year, and 8-year overall survival rates for the en-
tire cohort during medical management were 93% (1%), 86%
(2%), and 75% (4%), respectively. The cardiovascular
death–free survival rates were 96% (1%) at 2 years, 90% (1%)
at 4 years, and 83% (3%) at 8 years. Of the 104 deaths during
medical management, 57 (54.8%) were from a cardiovascular
cause, including 38 from heart failure and 7 from sudden car-
diac death. The incidence rate of sudden death was 2.5 cases
per 1000 patient-years.
Patients With Severe AS at Entry
Among the 861 patients with severe AS at entry, the 2-year,
4-year, and 8-year overall survival rates were 92% (1%), 80%
(3%), and 65% (8%), respectively (Figure 1A); the cardiovas-
cular death–free survival rates at 2 years, 4 years, and 8 years
were 96% (1%), 87% (3%), and 71% (9%), respectively
(Figure 1B); and the 2-year, 4-year, and 8-year AVR-free sur-
vival rates were 54% (2%), 32% (3%), and 12% (3%), respec-
tively (Figure 1C). Of the 64 deaths during medical manage-
ment in patients with severe AS, 32 (50%) were from a
cardiovascular cause, including 23 from heart failure, 4 from
sudden cardiac death, 2 from myocardial infarction, 2 from
stroke, and 1 from pulmonary embolism.
Aortic valve replacement was performed in 388 of 861 pa-
tientswithsevereAS(45.1%),withSAVRperformedin310(79.9%)
(Table 2). Indications for AVR were development of a class I in-
dicationin366patients(94.3%),aclassIIaindicationin18(4.6%),
andaclassIIbindicationin4(1.0%).Inthesepatients,themean
(SD)timebetweeninclusionandAVRwas14.4(16.6)months,and
themedian(range)timewas8.7(0-133)months.Combinedcoro-
nary artery revascularization was performed in 82 patients
(26.5%) at the time of SAVR.
Patients With Moderate AS at Entry
Among the 514 patients with moderate AS at baseline, 154
(30.0%)underwentAVR(SAVR,110[71.4%];TAVR,44[28.6%]);
128patients(83.1%)developedclassIindications,22(14.3%)de-
veloped class IIa indications, and 4 (2.6%) developed class IIb
indications. Echocardiography preceding AVR confirmed that
the stenosis had progressed to the severe stage (AVA less than
1.0 cm2) in all patients. Combined coronary artery revascular-
ization was performed in 34 patients at the time of AVR. The
mean (SD) time between inclusion and AVR was 29.9 (24.4)
months, and the median (range) time was 22.6 (0-98) months.
Themean(SD)overallsurvivalratewas94%(1%)at2years,89%
(2%) at 4 years, and 78% (4%) at 8 years follow-up (eFigure 1 in
Supplement 1). In these patients with moderate AS at baseline,

 were taken as continuous variables, both were independently
associated with cardiovascular mortality (Table 3). Using
receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the best cut-
off values regarding the prediction of overall death were
59.6% for LVEF (AUC, 0.73; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 56%)
and 4.7 m/s for peak aortic jet velocity (AUC, 0.50; sensitivity,
30%; specificity, 80%). The AUCs for LVEF and peak aortic jet
velocity were 0.68 and 0.59, respectively, for the prediction
of cardiovascular death. Of note, there was a graded associa-
tion of reduced survival with increased peak aortic jet veloc-
ity and with decreased LVEF (Figure 2). No EF threshold
higher than 65% further affected survival. For peak aortic jet
velocity, no additional prognostic information was obtained
for velocities between 4 and 5 m/s. Similar data were
obtained for AVA (eTable 3 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 1) for
both total and cardiovascular mortality. In patients with ini-
tially moderate AS, the best cutoffs associated with the out-
comes were 64% for LVEF and 3.0 m/s for peak aortic jet
velocity (eTable 4 in Supplement 1).
Post-AVR Outcomes
Thirty-daymortalityfollowingAVRwasverylow(n = 13[0.9%];
SAVR, 7; TAVR, 6). During follow-up, a total of 69 patients who
underwent AVR died (SAVR, 49; TAVR, 20), including 22 from
a cardiovascular cause, of which 17 were from heart failure and
2 were from sudden death. The mean (SD) 2-year, 4-year, and
6-year postprocedural overall survival rates were 83% (2%),
75% (4%), and 68% (6%), respectively. Patients with severe AS
at baseline and peak aortic velocity greater than 5 m/s had sig-
nificantly lower mean (SD) postoperative survival rates than
those with peak aortic velocity less than 5 m/s (2 years: 73%
[8%] vs 84% [2%]; 4 years: 65% [10%] vs 78% [4%]; 6 years:
54% [13%] vs 70% [6%]; P = .03). Similarly, patients with se-
vere AS at entry with reduced baseline LVEF less than 60% also
had lower mean (SD) postoperative survival rates than those
withbaselineLVEFof60%orgreater(2years:67%[7%]vs87%
[5%]; 4 years: 63% [8%] vs 78% [4%]; 6 years: 63% [8%] vs 69%
[7%];P = .02).Inmultivariableanalysis,age(hazardratio[HR],
1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; P = .003), diabetes (HR, 2.62; 95% CI,
1.90-4.95; P = .003), dyslipidemia (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.10-
0.37; P < .001), and peak aortic velocity greater than 5 m/s (HR,
2.20; 95% CI, 1.16-4.18; P = .02) were independently associ-
ated with postoperative survival. Of note, LVEF less than 60%

Discussion
The management of patients with asymptomatic AS has con-
tinued to challenge clinicians.6,21 A randomized clinical trial
(Evaluation of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
Compared to Surveillance for Patients With Asymptomatic Se-
vere Aortic Stenosis; NCT03042104) has been initiated to com-
pare outcomes of asymptomatic patients with severe AS who
are randomized to transfemoral TAVR vs clinical and echocar-
diographic follow-up (ie, active surveillance). To our knowl-
edge, a randomized surgical trial has not been performed, and
current practice patterns vary widely. In the present registry,
forpatientswithasymptomaticmoderateorsevereASandpre-
served LVEF greater than 50% at baseline followed up in heart
valve clinics over the intermediate term, the mean 2-year and
4-year overall survival rates under medical management were
93%and86%,respectively.Thecruderateofsuddendeathover
the follow-up interval was low (0.65%) and represented ap-
proximately one-tenth of all cardiovascular deaths.
In patients with severe AS at entry, age, systolic blood
pressure level, comorbidities (eg, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease), peak aortic jet velocity greater than 5 m/s, and
LVEF less than 60% were associated with all-cause mortality.

 Age, peak aortic jet velocity of 5 m/s or greater, and LVEF less
than 60% were also independently associated with cardio-
vascular death.
Duringfollow-up,34%ofpatientsrequiredAVR,andthisrate
rose to 59% at 4 years. Most AVRs were dictated by a class I in-
dication (ie, symptom development), and most cardiovascular
deathswererelatedtoheartfailure.The30-daymortalityfollow-
ing AVR in this series was very low (0.9%). After AVR, the nega-

and timely referral to intervention are critical.3,4 It has been
shownthatwhenpatientsareregularlyfollowedupwithinaheart

and less severe stage, thus optimizing timing of AVR.12,26 Com-

good overall midterm survival rates, and the very low rate of

likelyreflectappropriatemonitoring,planning,andhighadher-
encetoguidelines.13-18However,ourdatahighlighttheneedfor
additionaleffortswithprobablycloserfollow-upinthesepatients,
since the occurrence of overt heart failure remains a significant
problem even in heart valve centers of excellence.
Comorbidities are frequent in elderly individuals with AS,
and AS increases the mortality from myocardial infarction,
stroke, trauma, or emergency noncardiac surgery.27-31 The
HAVEC registry data highlighted that age and chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease significantly worsen patients’prog-
nosis. Age has not been consistently reported as an outcome
predictor in the literature. However, many older adults with
severe AS are not candidates for surgical AVR because of high
surgical risk, advanced age, frailty, or comorbid conditions.32
Some complications after transcatheter AVR (eg, vascular in-
juries) are more common in very elderly patients.3,4
Although supportive data are limited, an LVEF less than
50% is considered the appropriate threshold for defining LV
systolic dysfunction in AS.5,6,33 In the HAVEC registry, pa-
tients with EF between 50% and 59% had less favorable out-
comes and experienced more heart failure–related deaths
than those with EF greater than 60%. These data reinforce
observations from previous retrospective studies33,34 and
providesupportforadjustingthecutoffforLVEF(lessthan60%
instead of less than 50%) to define dysfunction and consider
AVR in asymptomatic severe AS.
DespitelimitedevidencewithaclassIIaindication,asymp-
tomatic patients with very severe AS (peak aortic jet velocity
greater than 5 to 5.5 m/s) are often referred for AVR.5,6,14 Peak
aortic jet velocity is recorded directly with the use of continu-
ous Doppler interrogation and, unlike AVA, does not require
calculations and has high reproducibility. Peak aortic jet ve-
locity is a robust prognostic parameter in AS, with increas-
ingly worse outcome from patients with mild to very severe
(greater than 5 m/s) stenosis.14,15,19 This gradual effect of ste-
nosis severity was challenged in a 2015 large multicenter ret-
rospective Japanese study.10 However, the main limitations of
this study were the inclusion of patients with LVEF less than
50% and the absence of standardized follow-up and treat-
ment strategy. By contrast, the HAVEC registry confirmed pre-
vious observations regarding stenosis severity in a very large
population of patients with asymptomatic AS evaluated and
monitored in heart valve clinics. In fact, very severe obstruc-
tion (peak aortic jet velocity of 5 m/s or greater) was predic-
tive of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death regard-
less of treatment strategy in asymptomatic patients with AS.14
Although AVA encompassed a broad range of values from 0.3
to 1.50 cm2, it was also associated with outcomes in these pa-
tients (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). An AVA less than 0.8 cm2
was associated with markedly increased risk of all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality.
Limitations
Ourstudyhadlimitations.Datafromacentralizeddatabase(clini-
cal and echocardiographic data at baseline and clinical data at
follow-up) were obtained from each center. However, because
ofincompleteechocardiographicdataatbaselineand/orduring
follow-up, a total of 22% of the initially included patients were
not included in the final study analysis. Follow-up echocardio-
graphicdatawerealsocollectedfromallpatientswhounderwent
AVRtoconfirmtheprogressionfrommoderatetosevereAS(ie,
AVA greater than 1 cm2). However, in the context of this study,
we did not collect the echocardiographic parameters of AS se-
verity and LV function at follow-up visits. This precluded the
analysis of the rate of progression from moderate to severe AS.
Although exercise testing was commonly performed (572 pa-
tients), some patients were considered asymptomatic based
solely on questionnaire on symptom status (not available in all
centers).Theassessmentofmyocardialstrain,whichcouldiden-

Conclusions

AS followed up in heart valve clinics have a low risk of sud-
den death and good midterm survival. Asymptomatic

cause and cardiovascular mortality even after successful
AVR. These findings provide support for consideration of
early elective AVR in these patients. Closer and more
frequent (every 6 to 12 months) clinical and echocardio-
graphic follow-up might be implemented in patients with
moderate AS and a peak aortic jet velocity of 3.0 m/s or
greater or LVEF less than 60%.
