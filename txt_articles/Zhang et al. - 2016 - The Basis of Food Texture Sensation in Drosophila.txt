SUMMARY
Food texture has enormous effects on food prefer-
ences. However, the mechanosensory cells and
key molecules responsible for sensing the physical
properties of food are unknown. Here, we show
that akin to mammals, the fruit fly, Drosophila mela-
nogaster, prefers food with a specific hardness or
viscosity. This food texture discrimination depends
upon a previously unknown multidendritic (md-L)
neuron, which extends elaborate dendritic arbors
innervating the bases of taste hairs. The md-L
neurons exhibit directional selectivity in response
to mechanical stimuli. Moreover, these neurons
orchestrate different feeding behaviors depending
on the magnitude of the stimulus. We demonstrate
that the single Drosophila transmembrane chan-
nel-like (TMC) protein is expressed in md-L neu-
rons, where it is required for sensing two key
textural features of food—hardness and viscosity.
We propose that md-L neurons are long sought
after mechanoreceptor cells through which food
mechanics are perceived and encoded by a taste
organ, and that this sensation depends on TMC.
INTRODUCTION
Food preferences are affected greatly by the qualities of food,
including nutrient value, texture, and the taste valence of sweet,
bitter, salty, and sour qualities (Foster et al., 2011; Freeman and
Dahanukar, 2015; Galindo et al., 2012; Joseph and Carlson,
2015; Koc
¸ et al., 2013;Limanet al., 2014). During the last15 years,
many of the gustatory receptor proteins that participate in the
discrimination of the chemical composition of food have been
defined (Liman et al., 2014). In sharp contrast, the basis through
which food texture is detected is enigmatic, despite the universal
appreciation that the physical properties of food greatly influence
decisions to consume a prospective offering (Rolls, 2005).
There are specific tactile features associated with liquid or
solid food. Viscosity and creaminess are typical textural features
of liquid food, whereas hardness, crispiness, and softness are
the main physical characteristics of solid food (Koc
¸ et al.,
2013). Similar to food tastes, food texture provides important in-
formation concerning food quality, including freshness and
wholesomeness. For instance, people prefer freshly baked
bread with relatively soft texture, and tend to reject older bread
with a harder texture, even though the chemical composition
has not changed significantly over the course of a couple of
days. Furthermore, while exploring the food landscape, an ani-
mal must make assessments of food hardness and viscosity in
order to exert the appropriate force to chew or ingest (Foster
et al., 2011; Koc
¸ et al., 2013). Insufficient chewing force results
in poor food processing, while excessive force can cause injury
to the tongue or teeth.
Food texture in mammals is predominantly detected through
poorly understood mechanisms in taste organs. In rodents and
humans, a subset of trigeminal nerves such as the lingual nerve
provides somatosensitive afferents to the tongue (Westberg and
Kolta, 2011; Whitehead et al., 1985). Due to the intrinsic mechan-
ical properties of food, mastication produces compression and
shearing forces, which in turn activate mechanosensory neurons
in taste organs. However, the molecular identities of mechano-
sensory neurons and signaling proteins that enable animals to
detect food texture are unknown.
To address the fundamental issue concerning the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that function in the sensation of food
texture, we turned to the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as
an animal model. In flies, food quality is evaluated largely through
external sensory hairs (sensilla), which decorate the fly tongue
(the labellum) and several other body parts (Liman et al., 2014).
These sensilla, which house several sensory neurons, allow the
chemical composition of foods, such as sugars and bitter com-
pounds, to be detected prior to entering the mouthparts.
Here, we found that Drosophila can discriminate between
foods on the basis of hardness and viscosity. We identify a pre-
viously unknown type of mechanosensory neuron in the fly
tongue that is dedicated to detecting food mechanics. These
multidendritic neurons in the labellum (md-L) extend their projec-
tions into the bases of most of the external sensilla and are
activated by deflections induced by hard and viscous food.
The ability of md-L neurons to sense food mechanics is virtually
lost due to elimination of the only Drosophila member of the
transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family. Mice and humans
each encode eight TMC proteins (Keresztes et al., 2003), and
mutations in the founding member of this family, TMC1, cause
deafness in mammals (Kurima et al., 2002; Vreugde et al.,
2002). We found that tmc is broadly tuned to detect both soft
and hard food textures. Remarkably, optogenetic stimulation
of the md-L neurons with different light intensities yields
opposing behavioral outcomes—weak light promotes feeding,
while strong light represses feeding. We conclude that md-L

that enable external sensory bristles on the fly tongue to com-
municate textural features to the brain, and do so through a
pre-ingestive mechanism.
RESULTS
Fruit Flies Prefer Food with a Specific Hardness and
Viscosity
We chose the fruit fly as a potential animal model to uncover
mechanisms through which basic food textures, such as viscos-
ity for liquid food and hardness for solid food, affect taste prefer-
ence (Liman et al., 2014). To explore how the viscosity of liquid
food influences feeding behavior, we used a colorless, odorless,
and tasteless chemical, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), since
low levels of HPC dissolved in water (0.5%–1.5%) give rise to
a wide range of viscosities (Figure 1A). Moreover, using tip re-
cordings to assay action potentials in fly gustatory receptor neu-
rons (GRNs), we established that 0.5%–1.5% of HPC did not
elicit gustatory activity (Figures 1B and 1C). However, when
HPC was mixed with 100 mM sucrose, it had little effect on
sugar-induced action potentials (Figures 1B and 1C). Taken
together, HPC is an ideal chemical compound to assess the
impact of viscosity on feeding in that it causes a striking change
in food viscosity without modifying intrinsic food taste.
Next, we used HPC to examine how wild-type flies respond to
liquid foods of different viscosities. Toward this end, we con-
ducted proboscis extension reflex (PER) assays. We constrained
the legs and wings of the flies within a small pipet tip, which
left the proboscis and head exposed (Figure 1D). We then
touched the proboscis using a drop of sucrose solution
(100 mM) mixed with different concentrations of HPC (0%–
1.5%). Pre-starved flies readily accepted sucrose solutions by
extending their proboscis (Figure 1E). However, as the sucrose
solution became more viscous, the animals showed a significant
decline in receptivity to the liquid food (Figures 1F and 1G).
We then asked whether the hardness of solid food impacted
feeding behavior in fruit flies. To test this idea, we chose agarose
as a food-gelling ingredient because food viscoelasticity could
be changed readily by varying the concentration of agarose.
Furthermore, since agarose is nontoxic, tasteless, and odorless,
it serves as an excellent food-supporting material that allows us
to investigate the sole contribution of food hardness to feeding
behavior. The minimal agarose concentration that can form solid
food is �0.5%. To quantitatively characterize food texture, we
performed rheological measurements (Ve
´ lez-Ruiz and Barbosa
Ca
´ novas, 1997) using 2 mM sucrose combined with a spectrum
of agarose concentrations. According to our rheometric assays,
the stiffness, or hardness, of food increased exponentially as the
agarose concentration rose (Figure 1H).
To analyze the impact of food hardness on feeding behavior,
we conducted two-way choice assays using a Petri dish (Fig-
ure S1, available online) (Zhang et al., 2013a, 2013b). One half
of the dish contained 2 mM sucrose and 1% agarose, while
the other half contained 2 mM sucrose and a series of agarose
concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 4%. With this instrument,
we subjected the control flies to two-way feeding behavioral as-
says and assessed food preference by inspecting the color of
their abdomens due to the food dyes. We found that flies
preferred consuming food with 1% agarose over softer food
(0.5% agarose) and harder foods with decreasing preference
as stiffness increases (2%–4% agarose; Figure 1I). Furthermore,
to ascertain that the food hardness was directly sensed through
the primary taste organ, the proboscis, we performed PER as-
says using 0.5%–4% agarose gelled with 100 mM sucrose.
Consistent with the two-way feeding assays, the PER assays
showed that as the agarose concentration rose from 0.5% to
1%, the wild-type flies exhibited enhanced food preferences,
while the animals showed a gradual decrease in food preference
as the agarose concentration increased above 1% (Figure 1J).
Taken together, flies show bi-directional food preferences for
foods with varying agarose concentrations, and they prefer
food with 1% agarose.
Our data indicate that fruit flies elicit gustatory preferences
based on viscosity and hardness. Moreover, flies discriminate
these fundamental textural properties of liquid and solid foods
pre-ingestively, similar to the discrimination of sugars and aver-
sive compounds, which is sensed through GRNs in sensory
sensilla external to the mouth parts (Liman et al., 2014).
Requirement for tmc in Discriminating the Hardness
of Food
To identify candidate molecules that contribute to the detection
of a physical property of food, we screened mutants and RNAi
lines disrupting a number of different classes of receptors and
ion channels that are known to be expressed in the labellum or
function in taste and other sensory modalities. These include
gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs) and tran-
sient receptor potential (TRP) channels, several of which are
known mechanosensors involved in touch, proprioception, and
hearing (Akitake et al., 2015; Benton et al., 2009; Effertz et al.,
2012; Koh et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2000; Yan et al., 2013).
None of these candidates were required for sensing food me-
chanics (Figure 2A). Flies lacking the Piezo channel (Kim et al.,
2012) also showed normal discrimination of food hardness
(Figure 2A).
We also tested a role for Drosophila TMC, since mammalian
TMC1 and TMC2 affect hearing (Kurima et al., 2002; Pan et al.,
2013; Vreugde et al., 2002) and therefore may have sensory roles
in flies. As opposed to mice and humans, each of which encodes
eight TMC family members, fruit flies encode only a single TMC
homolog (Kurima et al., 2003). To address whether Drosophila
tmc was required for sensing food texture, we obtained a fly
line with a transposon (PiggyBac; tmcPB), which inserted in the

(0.5%–4%) as indicated. Approximately 70 adult flies/assay. n = 5 trials.

 DNA sequence encoding residue 1,365 of the 1,932 amino acid
TMC protein. We then compared the control and tmcPB prefer-
ences between sucrose embedded in either 1% agarose or
3% agarose. Most wild-type animals chose food containing
1% agarose. However, tmcPB mutant animals exhibited a mod-
erate deficit in choosing 1% agarose food (Figure 2A).
Given the mild abnormality displayed by the tmcPB mutant, we
generated a null allele (tmc1) by homologous recombination. The
500 base pair deletion included the genomic fragment encoding
the 120 amino acid TMC domain (Figures 2B, S2A, and S2B),
which is highly conserved among human, mouse, fly, and
worm TMCs (>50% identity) (Kurima et al., 2003), suggesting

 that this region plays an evolutionally indispensable role. In addi-
tion, the deletion changed the reading frame and deleted several
donor and acceptor sites used for mRNA splicing. As a conse-
quence, the mRNA transcript is no longer properly processed
and is therefore undetectable in tmc1 flies (Figure S2C). The
tmc1 flies were viable and healthy, and appeared morphologi-
cally normal.
Next, we tested the capability of null tmc1 flies to discriminate
foods of different stiffness by varying the agarose concentration
from 0.5% to 4%. Based on two-way choice assays, tmc1 flies
showed severe impairments in discriminating 1% agarose-con-
taining food from softer or harder agarose foods (Figure 2C).
Moreover, wild-type flies preferred slightly hard food (2%
agarose) over moderately hard (3% agarose) or very hard food
(4% agarose; Figures S3A–S3C). In contrast, tmc1 animals
showed impairments in discriminating between different hard
foods (Figures S3A–S3C). The deficits in avoiding hard foods ex-
hibited by tmc1 were more severe than displayed by tmcPB (Fig-
ure S3D). Strikingly, using the PER assays, tmc1 flies had similar
preferences for sucrose-containing soft food (1% agarose) and
hard food (4% agarose; Figure 2D). Consequently, the mutant
flies showed a lower PER relative to controls in response to the
soft food and much higher responses to hard food (Figure 2D),
indicating that tmc is required to sense both soft and hard foods.
The tmc1 mutant also showed severe deficits in discriminating
liquid foods with different levels of viscosity (Figure 2E). The de-
fects in discriminating food texture were not secondary to a gen-
eral feeding abnormality, as tmc1 mutants exhibited normal
avoidance of bitter tastants such as quinine, denatonium, strych-
nine, and berberine (Figure S3E). Taken together, tmc1 mutant
flies did not display a general deficit in food consumption or taste
preferences. Rather, tmc was selectively required to discrimi-
nate among foods with a broad range of hardness or viscosity.
To examine whether the deficit in food texture perception was
due to the loss of tmc, we conducted genetic rescue experi-
ments with the tmc cDNA. To clone the full-length cDNA from
the proboscis, the primary taste organ analogous to the human
tongue, we performed RT-PCR (Figure S2C). The tmc cDNA en-
coded a predicted protein of 1,932 amino acids, which was
much larger than its counterparts in worms, mice, and humans
(757 to 1,285 amino acids) (Kurima et al., 2003). We found that
the abnormality exhibited by tmc1 animals in sensing food
hardness and viscosity was fully reversed by expressing the
tmc cDNA (UAS-tmc) under control of the tmc promoter (tmc-
Gal4; Figures 2C–2E and S3A–S3C).
tmc Localized to a Previously Unknown Multidendritic
Neuron in the Labellum
To characterize the expression pattern of TMC, we generated
TMC antibodies. As revealed by immunocytochemical assays,
TMC was localized to md-L neurons (Figure 3A). TMC was pre-
sent in the dendritic terminals, implying a sensory role (Figure 3A).
In contrast, we did not observe anti-TMC immunoreactivity in
tmc1 animals, confirming the specificity of the TMC antibodies
(Figure 3B). In order to acquire higher-resolution images of the
processes of the md-L neuron, we generated a tmc-Gal4 re-
porter transgene that included a 3 kb promoter region upstream
of the tmc transcriptional start site. In combination with the
UAS-mCD8::GFP reporter, we found that the tmc-Gal4 specif-
ically stained one multidendritic neuron in each of the two bilat-
erally symmetrical labella (Figure 3C). Based on double-labeling
experiments with TMC antibodies, the neuron was identical to
md-L (Figures S4A–S4C). The cell body of the md-L neuron
was positioned next to one of the I-type sensilla (I6) at the prox-
imal part of the labella (Figure 3D). Remarkably, md-L neurons
extended fine and elaborate dendritic branches innervating the
bases of many sensilla, the majority of which (�70%) were
L-type sensilla (Figure 3D). Other than md-L neurons, the tmc-
Gal4 reporter labeled a few multidendritic neurons in the ventral
cibarial sensory organ (VCSO) (Figure 3E), an accessory taste or-
gan analogous to the human pharynx. The multiple elaborate
dendritic branches assembled into a brush-like structure that
faced the luminal side of the food-passing tunnel (Figure 3E),
implying that they may sense the shearing force during food flow.
To examine the relative expression of md-L neurons and
GRNs, we generated a QF line (Potter et al., 2010) using the
same tmc promoter as for the tmc-Gal4 line. We then performed
double-labeling experiments with the Gr5a-Gal4 reporter, which
labels sugar-sensitive GRNs (Thorne et al., 2004; Wang et al.,
2004). The tmc and Gr5a reporters labeled two morphologically
different types of neurons in the labellum: the tmc reporter
marked md-L neurons, while the Gr5a reporter stained bipolar
GRNs (Figure 3F). The dendritic branches of md-L neurons en-
tangled closely with the GRNs underneath the cuticle (Figure 3F).
Furthermore, confocal imaging analysis revealed that many
dendritic arbors of md-L neurons are closely associated with
the cell bodies of GRNs (Figure 3G).
We also examined the projection pattern of the md-L axon in
the central brain. The axonal terminals projected to subesopha-
geal zone (SEZ) (Figure 3H), a brain region dedicated to process-
ing taste input from the peripheral system. The particular region
targeted by md-L neurons was different from that innervated by
GRNs, such as those marked by the Gr5a-Gal4 (Figure 3I). Other
than the SEZ, the tmc-Gal4 stained at least two other brain re-
gions: ventral projection neurons of the antennal lobe and a
subset of mushroom-body neurons (Figure 3H). We also de-
tected tmc-Gal4 expression in a few neurons located at the
wing hinge (Figure S4D) and the leg joint, indicating a potential
role in proprioception (Figure S4E). However, we did not detect
tmc-Gal4 expression in the tarsal leg segment, a peripheral
taste organ (Figure S4E). In summary, tmc molecularly defines
a previously unrecognized sensory neuron in the fruit fly probos-
cis. The unique dendritic arborization pattern of md-L neurons
at the bases of many sensilla suggests that these multidendritic
neurons may detect compression forces arising from the
bending of taste sensilla.
Activation of md-L Neurons by Mechanical Deflection of
Taste Sensilla
To investigate whether md-L neurons might be responsible for
detecting mechanical stimuli applied to gustatory sensilla, we
performed electrophysiological analysis. We deflected taste bris-
tles using the tip of a fine glass pipet controlled by a piezoelectric
activator system. Bending of taste sensilla produced stress at the
base of sensilla, and may mechanically activate the underlying
dendrites of md-L neurons. We identified the cell body of the

 md-L neuron using the I6 sensillum as a landmark. We also ex-
pressed a GPF reporter (UAS-mCD8::GFP) under the control of
the tmc-Gal4 and pinpointed the md-L cell body by fluorescent
microscopy. We then recorded the electrophysiological re-
sponses of the md-L neuron with a recording electrode impaled
in the vicinity of its cell body. This recording configuration allowed
for single-unit recordings of md-L neuronal activity.
In Drosophila, sensory bristles extend from many body parts,
such as the thorax, and exhibit planar cell polarity (Klein and
Mlodzik, 2005). Similarly, most of the L-type taste bristles, which
are associated with md-L dendrites, point from the dorsal side
down to the ventral side. To determine if md-L neurons are sen-
sitive to forces applied in a particular direction, we deflected
wild-type L-type sensilla in four different directions: dorsal,
ventral, anterior, and posterior. Strikingly, when we bent the
sensilla with a displacement of 20 mm in the dorsal direction,
the md-L neurons fired rapidly adapting action potentials (Fig-
ures 4A and 4B; 8.0 ± 1.0 spikes/500 ms). In contrast, deflecting
the sensilla in the ventral direction triggered 60% fewer spikes
(Figures 4A and 4B; 3.2 ± 0.7 spikes/500 ms). When we bent
the taste bristles the same distance in either the anterior or the
posterior direction, the md-L neurons produced %25% of the
spikes generated by a dorsal deflection (Figures 4A and 4B;
spikes/500 ms were as follows: anterior, 2.0 ± 0.5; posterior,
1.8 ± 0.4). Furthermore, when we deflected the bristles in four di-
rections over a range of distances (10–30 mm), the md-L neurons
were still most sensitive to bending in the dorsal direction (Fig-
ures S5A–S5D). Taken together, these results demonstrated
that md-L neurons were more sensitive to mechanical stimuli in
the dorsal direction than any other direction.
Control of Mechanosensory Responses of md-L
Neurons by tmc
To determine whether the force-induced action potentials eli-
cited by md-L neurons were dependent on tmc, we performed
extracellular single-unit recordings. We found that there was a
significant reduction in the mechanosensory responses of tmc1
flies regardless of the direction of sensilla deflection (Figures
4A and 4B; spikes/500 ms were as follows: dorsal, 1.3 ± 0.4;
ventral, 0.5 ± 0.2; anterior, 0.4 ± 0.2; posterior, 0.3 ± 0.2). We
rescued the electrophysiological defects by restoring expression
of wild-type tmc (UAS-tmc) under control of the tmc-Gal4 (Fig-
ures 4A and 4B; spikes/500 ms were as follows: dorsal, 8.5 ±
1.2; ventral, 3.5 ± 0.4; anterior, 2.2 ± 0.4; posterior, 2.1 ± 0.4).
The dramatic reduction in force-induced action potentials in
tmc1 was not due to a secondary consequence of a general
impairment in labellar function since the mutant animals showed
normal responses to salt, sucrose, and caffeine (Figures 4C–4E).
To further explore a requirement for md-L neurons and TMC
for force-induced neuronal activity, we tested Ca2+ dynamics
in the axonal terminals of md-L neurons in response to mechan-
ical deflection. To visualize changes in Ca2+ levels in live animals,
we expressed a transgene encoding the Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6f
(UAS-GCaMP6f) (Chen et al., 2013) in md-L neurons under the
control of the tmc-Gal4. We surgically exposed the SEZ region
in the brain and monitored fluorescent changes as we pushed
the taste sensilla toward the dorsal side with a polished glass
probe. We found that mechanical stimuli led to robust Ca2+ influx
in the axonal terminals of md-L neurons (Figures 5A, 5C, and 5D).
In contrast, no significant Ca2+ transients occurred in tmc1
mutant animals (Figures 5B–5D).
md-L Neurons Are Required for Food Texture Sensation
To provide additional evidence that md-L neurons were critical
for discriminating foods based on texture, we performed cell-
type-specific genetic manipulations. In addition to md-L, the
tmc-Gal4 was also expressed in a few central brain regions
such as the mushroom bodies and the antennal lobes (Figure 3H).
However, staining of these central brain regions may represent
ectopic expression of the reporter since anti-TMC did not stain
the mushroom bodies and antennal lobes. Nevertheless, to
test whether food texture sensation was solely mediated by
md-L, we first performed intersectional genetic labeling using
the tmc-Gal4 line in combination with promoter-Gal80 lines (Sus-
ter et al., 2004). We screened for promoter-Gal80 lines that
selectively repressed expression of the tmc-Gal4 in the central
brain. We successfully identified one Gal80 line, vGluT-Gal80
(Bussell et al., 2014), which specifically erased expression of
the tmc-Gal4 reporter in central brain regions, such as the mush-
room bodies and antennal lobes, while leaving intact staining
of the md-L projections into the SEZ (Figures 6A and 6B). In
addition, given that the motor neurons controlling muscle move-
ments in Drosophila are glutaminergic (Daniels et al., 2008),
vGluT-Gal80 serves to repress any potential Gal4 mis-expres-
sion in motor neurons.
To test the requirement of md-L neurons for sensation of food
mechanics, we used tetanus toxin (TNT) to shut down synaptic
transmission between md-L and its synaptic partners. As we ex-
pected, tmc-Gal4/UAS-TNT animals exhibited a severe defect in
sensing the hardness of agarose foods (0.5%–4% agarose) (Fig-
ures 6C, S6A, and S6B), as well as the viscosity of HPC/sucrose
solutions (0%–1.5% HPC) (Figures 6C and S6C). To determine if
the behavioral abnormality was due to the md-L neurons, we
combined the vGlut-Gal80 transgene with the tmc-Gal4 and
UAS-TNT to abolish synaptic transmission exclusively in md-L
neurons. We found that these animals showed the same extent
of defects as tmc-Gal4/UAS-TNT animals (Figures 6C and
S6A–S6C). These results provide strong evidence that the single
md-L neuron in each bilaterally symmetrical labellum governs
the behavioral responses to food mechanics.
To reinforce the conclusion that the md-L neuron was indis-
pensable for controlling food texture sensation, we used a laser
(405 nm) to selectively compromise the md-L cell body. This
neuron is positioned underneath a thin layer of cuticle on the sur-
face of the labellum, making laser treatments feasible (Figures
6D and 6E). We found that animals with ablated md-L somas dis-
played significant defects in sensing the hardness of solid food
and the viscosity of liquid food (Figures 6F, S6D, and S6E). In
summary, the intersectional genetic and laser treatment experi-
ments demonstrate that md-L neurons play a critical role in
orchestrating the sensation of food mechanics.
Optogenetic Stimulation of md-L Caused Intensity-
Dependent Effects on Proboscis Extension

sufficient to produce behavioral responses, we employed a

behavioral artifacts caused by activation of the visual system
(Klapoetke et al., 2014). We expressed UAS-CsChrimson
under control of the tmc-Gal4. In addition to md-L, the tmc-
Gal4 was expressed only in a small number of local neurons
in the adult ventral nerve cord (VNC), and projections ex-
tending from a few neurons in the legs or wing hinges (Fig-
ure S7A). To erase expression in the VNC, we employed a

(vGlut-Gal80).

allowing the proboscis to remain exposed and unrestrained
(Figure 7A). We then surgically removed the forelegs to
exclude potential interference with the proboscis extension
response (Figure 7A).
To gain a quantitative view of the correlation between md-L
activation and motivation to feed, we monitored the PER
assay following stimulation of md-L neurons with red light
(620 nm) of various intensities ranging from weak to strong

(0.05–1
mW/mm2).
Remarkably,
we
found
that
the
animals
immediately
stretched their proboscises upon expo-
sure to low or moderate levels of light
(0.05–0.4 mW/mm2; Figure 7B; Movie
S1). Once the light was turned off, the
animal contracted its proboscis to the
resting state (Figure 7C; Movie S1),
indicative of a reversible behavioral pro-
cess. Furthermore, to minimize potential
light activation of tmc neurons in other
body parts such as the wing hinge and
the leg joint, we shielded the fly body
with aluminum foil (Figures 7D–7G). As
with the preceding results, control ani-
mals displayed few PERs upon stimu-
lation with either weak or strong light stimuli (Figures 7D, 7E,
7H, and 7I). However, the tmc-Gal4,UAS-CsChrimson animal
showed
prominent
PERs
under
weak
light
conditions
(0.1 mW/mm2; Figures 7F, 7H, and 7I). In contrast, under
more intense light (0.6–1 mW/mm2), the PER was suppressed
(Figures 7G, 7H, and 7I). At the highest light intensity tested
(1 mW/mm2), the animals contracted their proboscises (Movie
S2). Thus, weak and moderate light promoted proboscis
extension, which is associated with attraction to soft food,
whereas strong light inhibited proboscis extension—a be-
havior associated with aversion to hard food.
To determine if the light-induced PER was due solely to ac-
tivation of the md-L neuron, we subjected tmc-Gal4,UAS-
CsChrimson;vGlut-Gal80 animals to optogenetic analysis. We
found
that
tmc-Gal4,UAS-CsChrimson;vGlut-Gal80
animals
showed proboscis extensions to weak light, as well as
contraction of the proboscis by strong light, similar to the tmc-
Gal4,UAS-CsChrimson animals (Figures 7I, S8A, and S8B).
Controls expressing UAS-CsChrimson alone did not respond
to light of either intensity (Figure 7I). Therefore, we conclude
Neuron 91, 863–877, August 17, 2016
871
 that the different levels of stimulation of md-L neurons lead to
distinct behavioral outputs in the proboscis.
To test how the stimulation of md-L neurons with light of
various intensities affects feeding, we presented a high concen-
tration of sucrose solution (500 mM) while the animal was
exposed to weak or strong light. Control animals that did not
express UAS-CsChrimson showed similar PERs to 500 mM
sucrose solutions regardless of light intensity (Figures 8A,
8B, and 8E). In sharp contrast, as the light intensity rose, tmc-
Gal4,UAS-CsChrimson animals showed a profound decline in
the preference for the otherwise highly attractive sucrose
(Figures 8C–8E), suggesting attraction to sucrose was signifi-
cantly repressed by strong light. Similarly, tmc-Gal4,UAS-
CsChrimson;vGlut-Gal80 animals exhibited strong preferences
for 500 mM sucrose under weak light (Figures 8F and S8C), while
they lost attraction to the same food under strong light (Figures
8F and S8D). Taken together, stimulations of md-L neurons
with varying light intensities differentially modulated sucrose
feeding.
DISCUSSION
We demonstrate that the attraction of wild-type flies to the same
concentration of sucrose is altered by the viscosity or hardness
of the food. If the sucrose-containing substrate is too sticky, soft,
or hard, the appeal of the food declines. These observations
establish the Drosophila taste system as a model to explore
the cellular and molecular underpinnings that allow an animal
to sense food texture. Moreover, similar to the chemosensory
evaluation of food by external sensilla decorating the labellum,
the textural assessment of foods is pre-ingestive in flies.
Requirement for md-L Neurons for Food Texture
Sensation
We identified md-L, a previously undefined neuron in each of
the two bilateral symmetrical labella, which extend a complex
array of dendrites to the bases of many sensilla. Several ob-
servations demonstrate that md-L neurons play an indispens-
able role in food texture sensation. First, selective abolition of

 neurotransmission from md-L caused significant impairments in
food texture discrimination. Second, laser ablation of md-L re-
sulted in severe defects in perceiving the viscosity or hardness
of foods. Third, low or moderate artificial activation of md-L neu-
rons was sufficient to trigger proboscis extension. Thus, the
loss-of-function and gain-of-function analyses of md-L neurons
lead us to conclude that md-L neurons are key mechanoreceptor
cells controlling sensation of food mechanics.
Unexpectedly, while low-intensity optogenetic stimulation of
md-L provoked proboscis extension, high-intensity light induced
contraction of the proboscis. Thus, md-L neurons are tuned to
different levels of mechanical stimuli that give rise to drastically
different feeding behaviors. We propose that weak or moderate
light mimics the response to softer foods that simulates feeding,
while strong light induces a higher level of activity that mimics
hard foods and discourages feeding. When we offered a fly

 sucrose in combination with optogenetic stimulation of md-L
neurons with strong light, this caused the animal to reject the
otherwise appetitive food. We propose this rejection occurred
because the animal perceived the texture of the sucrose as too
hard. Thus, we suggest that texture sensation is mediated by
md-L neurons through an intensity-dependent rather than a
labeled-line mechanism. While md-L are required, we do not
exclude that other neurons in the labella contribute to food
texture sensation. Ultrastructural studies of taste sensilla led to
the proposal that a neuron positioned at the base of each taste
sensillum is a mechanosensory neuron (Falk et al., 1976). How-
ever, it currently remains unclear as to whether these neurons
contribute to some aspect of food texture detection.
Directional Sensitivity of md-L Neurons
In Drosophila, most taste sensilla point toward the ventral direc-
tion. The md-L neuron produced much stronger neuronal activity
in response to forces applied to taste hairs that were deflected

dorsally than those deflected in other di-
rections. Thus, taste sensilla are most
sensitive to force applied opposite to the
direction in which they point. Notably,
this direction-dependent feature of taste
sensilla is reminiscent of the directional
sensitivity of hair in mammals (Brown
and Iggo, 1967; Gottschaldt and Vahle-
Hinz, 1981; Lichtenstein et al., 1990; Mar-
uhashi et al., 1952; Rutlin et al., 2014),
suggesting that it is a widely used neural
coding strategy for sensation in the ani-
mal kingdom.
The
directional
sensitivity
of
taste
sensilla differs from the macrochaete
bristles in the thorax, since these latter
bristles
are
most
sensitive
to
force
applied in the same direction in which
they point (Walker et al., 2000). The profound differences in
force-directional sensitivity reflect the functional divergence be-
tween these two types of mechanosensory bristles. The direc-
tion-tuning feature of md-L neurons might be an evolutionary
adaptation to help fruit flies sample food. While exploring the
food landscape, a fruit fly normally extends its proboscis in the
ventral direction. As a consequence, the forces arising from
the food will bend taste sensilla in the opposite dorsal direction.
Thus, we suggest that md-L neurons evolved to become most
sensitive to forces emanating from the dorsal direction.
TMC Is Essential for Food Texture Sensation
We conclude that Drosophila TMC is required for detecting food
hardness. TMC is expressed and required in md-L neurons.
Furthermore, loss of tmc greatly reduced the ability to beha-
viorally discriminate the preferred softness (1% agarose) or
smoothness (sucrose solution only) from harder or stickier food
options, respectively. However, the responses to tastants,
874
Neuron 91, 863–877, August 17, 2016
 such as sucrose, salt, or caffeine, were unaffected in tmc1, indi-
cating that TMC was specifically required for sensing food
texture rather than the chemical composition of food.
An important question concerns the mechanism through which
TMC enables md-L neurons to sense food hardness. We propose
that deflection ofgustatory sensilla byfood hardness imposes me-
chanical force on these neurons. The harder the food, the greater
the stimulation of md-L neurons, which sense force through the
dendritesinnervatingthebasesofmanysensilla.Giventheexpres-
sion of TMC in dendrites, an appealing possibility is that TMC is a
key component of a mechanically activated channel that endows
the fly tongue with the ability to sense food hardness. A TMC
protein (TMC-1) is expressed in worms and is proposed to be
required for salt sensation (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2013). Further-
more, TMC-1 plays a critical role in alkali sensation in vivo (Wang
et al., 2016). As such, it appears that the worm TMC-1 controls
multiple aspects of chemosensation. Mammalian TMC1 and
TMC2 are required for hearing and expressed in the inner ear
(Kawashima et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2013). Currently, it is
not known if mammalian TMCs are subunits of a channel, or
whether they are mechanically activated, since problems with
cell-surface expression of these proteins in heterologous expres-
sion systems have precluded biophysical characterizations (Ka-
washima et al., 2011). It is possible that TMCs may depend on
additional subunits for trafficking or to form functional ion chan-
nels. Drosophila TMC may also be one subunit of a mechanically
activated channel, and we propose that this feature might allow
md-L neurons to be stimulated in response to bending of taste
sensilla by hard foods.
Conclusions and Future Perspective
In conclusion, we elucidated a cellular mechanism through
which food mechanics influence the taste preference of an an-
imal. The md-L neurons define a novel class of mechanosen-
sory neurons that enable flies to detect food hardness and
viscosity. A future question concerns the mapping of the
brain region where mechanical and chemosensory pathways
converge to dictate gustatory decisions. An appealing possibil-
ity is that md-L and GRN axons coordinately signal to a pair of
command interneurons (Fdg neurons) that have extensive ar-
borizations in the SEZ and control feeding behavior (Flood
et al., 2013). Finally, our results demonstrate that TMC is essen-
tial for food texture sensation. These results raise the possibility
that homologs of fly TMC may be dedicated to the gustatory
discrimination of texture in many other animals, including
mammals.

The control flies were either w1118 or Canton-S flies that were outcrossed to
w1118. All the mutants used were outcrossed to w1118 flies for five generations.
Null tmc1 Mutant
To generate the tmc1 knockout animals, we used ends-out homologous
recombination (Gong and Golic, 2003) to create a 500 base pair deletion
that removed the tmc genomic regions encompassing exons 14–16. This dele-
tion eliminated 123 amino acid residues (1,133–1,255) encoding the TMC
domain (Kurima et al., 2003) and altered the reading frame.
tmc Transgenic Lines
The tmc-Gal4 and tmc-QF transgenes included a 3.0 kb genomic DNA frag-
ment flanking the 50 end of the predicted transcriptional start site of tmc.
The UAS-tmc transgene included a 5,799 bp tmc cDNA.
TMC Antibodies
The TMC polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits in response to GST fused
to a 72 amino acid C-terminal segment of TMC (residues 1,861–1,932).
Imaging Immunostaining Patterns
All immunostaining was performed using whole mounts of the indicated tis-
sues, and the images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal
microscope.
Two-Way Choice Feeding Assays
To conduct the two-way choice assays, we used a Petri dish as previously
described (Zhang et al., 2013a, 2013b). One half contained 2 mM sucrose
and a particular concentration of agarose (0.5%–5%), and the other half
contained 2 mM sucrose and another concentration of agarose (1% agarose,
unless indicated otherwise). The agarose foods were mixed with blue or red
food dye. Approximately 70 flies were starved for 24 hr and allowed to choose
between the two options for 90 min in the dark. We assessed the colors of the
abdomens and calculated the preference index (PI). A PI = 0 indicates no pref-
erence, while PIs of 1.0 and �1.0 indicate complete preferences for one or the
other food option. If the 1% agarose food was mixed with red dye, the PI =
(Nred + 0.5Npurple) � (Nblue + 0.5Npurple)/(Nred + Nblue + Npurple). If we mixed
the blue dye with the 1% agarose, we calculated the PI as follows: PI = (Nblue +
0.5Npurple) � (Nred + 0.5Npurple)/(Nred + Nblue + Npurple).
PER
To perform the PER assays, we inserted a fly in a 200 mL pipet tip and touched
the labellum with either an �2 mL drop of sucrose solution or a small agarose
ball formed at the end of the pipet tip.
Mechanical Response Recordings
We immobilized flies by impaling them with a glass pipet. We deflected the
sensilla 10–30 mm using a glass pipet mounted onto the tip of the piezoelectric
actuator.
Tip Recordings
We measured chemical-induced action potentials by performing tip record-
ings as described (Zhang et al., 2013a, 2013b). We used L4 or L6 sensilla to
record the responses to HPC, NaCl, and sucrose, and S6 sensilla to record
the responses to caffeine.
Ca2+ Imaging
To perform the Ca2+ imaging in live animals, we expressed UAS-GCaMP6f
(Chen et al., 2013) under the control of the tmc-Gal4. To determine the
effect of force on Ca2+ dynamics, we applied force by pushing the labellum
with a glass probe under the control of a piezoelectric system. To assess
the responses to tastants, we applied a drop of liquid to the surface of the
proboscis.
Laser Treatments
We performed the laser treatments by placing the head of tmc-Gal4/UAS-
DsRed flies in a pipet tip. We localized the md-L neuron using the red
568 nm laser line and directed a 405 nm laser line at nearly 100% power using
a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope.
Optogenetic Assays
We performed optogenetic experiments using tmc-Gal4/UAS-CsChrimson
flies that were prefed all-trans-retinal. We immobilized each animal in a pipet
tip so that the proboscis was exposed to the outside and stimulated the pro-
boscis with red (620 nm, AmScope) or white light. In some experiments, the
flies were offered a sucrose solution in the presence of varying intensities of
light.

 Statistical Analysis
Unpaired Student’s t test was used to determine the statistical significance of
two samples. To test the statistical significance of multiple samples, we used
one-way ANOVA with Scheffe
´ ’s post hoc analysis.
