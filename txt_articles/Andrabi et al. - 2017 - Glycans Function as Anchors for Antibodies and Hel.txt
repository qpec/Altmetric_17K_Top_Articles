The authors inadvertently omitted some text from the legend for Figure 4B, making it 
difficult to interpret the figure. The full and complete legend appears here and online. The 
authors regret this omission.
(B) Octet binding curves (association: 120 s [180–300] and dissociation: 240 s [300–540]) 
of CAP256.21 and CAP256.25 Abs with CRF250 trimer, its individual glycan site-
eliminated variants and their corresponding a2,6 desialylated versions. The binding curves 
for the WT CRF250 trimer and each of the glycan variants are depicted in different colors, 
whereas the responses for the desialylated trimer forms are all shown in red. The binding 
response of CAP256.25 bnAb with the CRF250 N156A variant is fixed to 0.2 nanometer 
(nm) for clarity.
