Abstract
Background: Internal eyelid spacer graft is routinely placed during lower eyelid retraction surgery, which may be unnecessary.
Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of lower eyelid retraction surgery without internal graft in select cases.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing reconstructive lower eyelid retraction surgery without internal graft, by one surgeon from 2013 to 2015.
Surgical technique included transconjunctival lower eyelid retractor lysis, canthoplasty, and temporary tarsorrhaphy, with or without subperiosteal midface-sub
oribularis oculi fat (SOOF) lifting and scar lysis. Eyelids with true lower eyelid middle-lamella shortage were excluded. Analysis included 17 surgeries (11 patients).
Eight of 11 patients had undergone at least one previous lower eyelid surgery with resultant lower eyelid retraction and sclera show. Preoperative and postoperative
photographs at longest follow-up visit were analyzed with standardized measurements. Patient satisfaction was recorded using questionnaire.
Results: Etiologies of lower eyelid retraction included prior lower blepharoplasty, thyroid eye disease, and chronic facial palsy. All 11 patients (17 procedures)
demonstrated improvement of lower eyelid position. The mean improvement of marginal reflex distance was 2.2 mm (range, 1.6-2.8 mm). There was one case of
mild overcorrection. The average follow-up was 7 months (range, 6 months-2 years). Midface lift was performed for 14 of 17 eyelids.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates improvement of lower lid position after lower eyelid retraction surgery without internal eyelid spacer graft in select pa-
tients. Most patients in our study had undergone previous lower eyelid blepharoplasty and required midface-SOOF lifting. The author proposes that “routine” place-
ment of lower eyelid internal spacer/graft may not be necessary during lower eyelid retraction surgery.

Lower eyelid retraction is defined as the inferior malposi-
tion of the lower eyelid margin with or without eyelid mal-
rotation. It presents clinically with scleral show; round,
sad-looking eyes; possible lateral canthal tendon laxity;
which can result in symptoms of ocular irritation, including
photophobia, excessive tearing, and nocturnal lagophthal-
mos. These patients may require frequent ocular lubricants
which provide only minimal alleviation of these symptoms.1
Patients are often unhappy about the eye appearance.
Severe eyelid malposition can occur following transcuta-
neous lower eyelid blepharoplasty in up to 15 to 20 percent
of patients.2,3 However, lower eyelid malposition can occur
after any procedure which violates the lower eyelid including
midface lifting procedures, fat re-draping, composite rhyti-
dectomy, or fracture repair.1 Other etiologies of lower eyelid
retraction include thyroid eye disease with or without propto-
sis, chronic proptosis or prominent globes, chronic facial
palsy, poor maxillary support, and congenital variants.
The lower eyelid is supported by the lateral and medial
canthal tendons, the capsulopalpebral fascia (or lower lid
retractors), the tarsus, and the orbicularis oculi muscle.1,4
The lower eyelid includes 3 lamella: anterior lamella (skin),
middle lamella (orbicularis oculi muscle and septum and
eyelid retractors), posterior lamella (tarsus and conjuncti-
va). Cicatricial lower eyelid ectropion occurs from anterior
lamella contraction whereas lower eyelid retraction results
from contracture or relative shortage of primarily the
middle lamella, although other lamella layers could also be
involved. Additional factors involved in lower eyelid malpo-
sition include midface descent, poor maxillary support, and
prominent globe. Midface or sub oribularis oculi fat
(SOOF) descent in conjunction with cicatricial lower eyelid

changes and large eye morphology cause severe lower
eyelid malposition.5,6
Once the pathophysiology and anatomic cause of lower
eyelid retraction is understood, it is much easier to under-
stand how to correct it. Although a combined midface lift
with lower eyelid spacer graft is required in the most chal-
lenging cases of lower eyelid retraction,7-11 routine place-
ment of spacer graft may not be necessary in all cases. The
purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of lower
eyelid retraction surgery without the use of any internal
graft in select cases.
METHODS
In this retrospective study, charts of patients undergoing
lower eyelid retraction surgery without placement of inter-
nal eyelid spacer graft by one surgeon (M.R.T.) in private
practice from January 2013 to December 2015, were re-
viewed. Informed consent was obtained for each proce-
dure, and the review adhered to the standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki and was compliant with the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, adherent to
IRB approval standards. Surgical technique included trans-
conjunctival lower eyelid retractors lysis (complete release
of lower eyelid retractors attachment to the tarsus), cantho-
plasty, and temporary frost tarsorrhaphy, with or without
middle lamellae scar lysis and sub-periosteal midface-SOOF
lift. The technique is similar to previously published
techniques,5,8-11 except no spacer graft was placed. The
latter step was performed in patients who had additional
anterior lamella (skin) cicatrix (as determined by lower
eyelid forced upward traction test), requiring recruitment
of skin through midface/SOOF lifting. Eyelids with true
middle lamella shortage (as evidenced by preoperative
forced upward traction test), requiring internal spacer graft,
were excluded from the study. (Preoperative lower eyelid
forced upward traction test not only determines if there is
cicatrix in the lower eyelid preventing it from elevating, it
also determines what layer(s) of the lower eyelid the cicatrix
exists. Initial step of this test involves manually pushing the
lower eyelid up; normally the lower eyelid is able to be
pushed up close to the upper limbus; if there is cicatrix,
there is limitation of its elevation. Secondary step involves
manually elevating the midface in addition to the lower
eyelid with release of any skin cicatrix tension, thereby re-
vealing presence of any true middle lamella cicatrix.)
Analysis included 17 surgeries in 11 patients. 8 out of 11
patients had undergone at least one previous lower eyelid
surgery with resultant lower eyelid retraction and sclera
show. Patients with <6-months follow-up were excluded.
Patient satisfaction was recorded using questionnaire. In
addition to customary questions/examination between the
patient and the surgeon, a phone call was placed by the sur-
gical coordinator to the patient after the latest postoperative
follow up appointment.
Preoperative and postoperative photographs at longest
follow-up visit were used for analysis. All photographs were
obtained by the surgeon in standardized fashion with head
in straight position and eyes looking directly into the
camera. Measurements of the corneal diameter and distance
from pupil center to lower lid margin were obtained, stan-
dardized, and compared, per previous protocol (Figure 1).11
RESULTS
Etiologies of lower eyelid retraction included prior lower
blepharoplasty (8 patients), thyroid eye disease (2 patients),
and chronic facial palsy (1 patient). The mean patient age
was 45 years (range, 25-85 years). There were 10 females
and 1 male. Midface-SOOF lifting was performed in 14 of 17
eyelids. All 11 patients (17 procedures) demonstrated im-
provement of lower eyelid position. There was one case of
mild over-correction. Subjective patient satisfaction was
high in all cases except the case of mild over-correction.
Representative examples are shown in Figure 2 and
Supplementary Figures 1-3 (available as Supplementary
Material at www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com). The mean
preoperative MRD2 was 6.6 mm (range, 6.1-8 mm) and the
mean postoperative MRD2 was 4.4 (range, 4.0-5.2 mm). The
mean improvement or change in eyelid height was 2.2 mm
(range, 1.6-2.8 mm). The average follow-up after surgery
was 7 months (range, 6 months-2 years).
DISCUSSION
Despite advances and knowledge in lower blepharoplasty
techniques,1,10-17 postoperative lower eyelid retraction still
occurs, with functional and cosmetic problems, which is
especially bothersome for the patient and surgeon as these
patients had underwent lower blepharoplasty for cosmetic
reasons. In addition to post-blepharoplasty lower eyelid re-
traction, other lower eyelid retraction etiologies include
thyroid eye disease with or without proptosis, long-term
Figure 1. The distances used in our calculations were the
corneal diameter of respective sides along with the center of
pupil to lower lid margin (central LD) and lateral limbus to
lower lid margin (lateral LD), as demonstrated on this
25-year-old woman.

proptosis or prominent globes, long-term facial palsy, poor
maxillary support, and congenital variants.
There have been many studies and different procedures
proposed to correct lower eyelid retraction, with the use of
variable internal eyelid spacer grafts, including hard
palate, ear cartilage, fascia, Alloderm, Enduragen, donor
sclera, among others.4,16,18-26 Eyelid spacer grafts have a
definite role in cases with true lower eyelid middle lamella
cicatrix/shortage to provide additional augmentation by
lengthening the lower-lid retractors and giving vertical
height and stiffness to support the lower eyelid following
release of the cicatrix.11 However the benefits of recon-
structive cosmetic eyelid surgery must always be weighed
against many other factors. Use of spacer grafts is associat-
ed with increased surgical time, increased surgical cost,
possible donor site morbidity, graft complication, and in-
creased recovery time. Therefore, their use should be
limited to cases that truly need middle lamella support.
Previous studies have shown spacer graft may not be neces-
sary in mild cases of eyelid retraction due to orbicularis
oculi weakness.27-29 However, no previous study has been
done to analyze the effect of eyelid retraction surgery
without spacer in moderate to severe cases of eyelid retrac-
tion, specifically due to previous eyelid operations (ie, lower
blepharoplasty) with resultant anterior lamella +/− middle
lamella cicatrix, with required midface/SOOF lifting. Similar
cicatricial process is responsible for lower eyelid retraction
in thyroid eye disease patients and in some patients with
chronic facial palsy.
In the current study of lower eyelid retraction surgery
without internal spacer graft, the lower eyelid was elevated
to normal position in nearly all cases. There are important
limitations to our study that must be taken into account
when considering the implications of the data. The patients
were not randomized. There were also various decisions
made that can be confusing. First, the decision to perform
midface lifting was based on need for anterior lamella
which can be difficult to standardize. Second, the decision
to not place internal spacer graft was based on lack of need
for middle lamella support (as determined using forced
upward traction test during preoperative examination),
which is again difficult to standardize. Furthermore, al-
though good quality photographic documentation was
available at regular intervals for all patients, allowing quan-
titative and unbiased evaluation, measurements taken from
photographs have inherent inaccuracy. Lastly, longer-term
follow ups are lacking than those already included.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates improvement of lower lid position
after lower eyelid retraction surgery without the use of in-
ternal eyelid spacer graft during lower eyelid reconstruction
in select patients of cicatricial lower eyelid retraction. Our

results are comparable to previous studies that have used
internal spacer grafts in all cases.11 Most patients in our
study who had undergone previous lower eyelid blepharo-
plasty with resultant midface/middle lamellae tethering did
require subperiosteal midface lifting with scar release. The
author believes lower eyelid spacer grafts are overused. He
proposes that “routine” placement of lower eyelid internal
spacer graft may not be necessary during lower eyelid re-
traction surgery, thereby reducing surgical time, reducing
surgical cost, reducing graft complications and morbidity,
and speeding up recovery time.
