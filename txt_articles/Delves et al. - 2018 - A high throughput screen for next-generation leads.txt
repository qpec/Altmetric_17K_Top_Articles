Spread of parasite resistance to artemisinin threatens current frontline antimalarial therapies,
highlighting the need for new drugs with alternative modes of action. Since only 0.2–1% of
asexual parasites differentiate into sexual, transmission-competent forms, targeting this
natural bottleneck provides a tangible route to interrupt disease transmission and mitigate
resistance selection. Here we present a high-throughput screen of gametogenesis against a
~70,000 compound diversity library, identifying seventeen drug-like molecules that target
transmission. Hit molecules possess varied activity profiles including male-specific, dual
acting male–female and dual-asexual-sexual, with one promising N-((4-hydroxychroman-4-
yl)methyl)-sulphonamide scaffold found to have sub-micromolar activity in vitro and in vivo
efficacy. Development of leads with modes of action focussed on the sexual stages of malaria
parasite development provide a previously unexplored base from which future therapeutics
can be developed, capable of preventing parasite transmission through the population.

uccess in reducing the burden of malaria disease since the
turn of the millennium has seen the paradigm shift from
control to one of regional elimination and eventual global
eradication1,2. The coordinated roll-out of established measures
has yielded substantial reductions in mortality and morbidity and
helped to achieve elimination of malaria in 10 countries3. How-
ever, to ensure that these gains are maintained and accelerated,
and in light of worrying emergence of multidrug-resistant malaria
in Southeast Asia4, new and innovative therapeutics are needed to
prevent a potential reversal in numbers in the coming years.
At the heart of malaria disease incidence is spread of the
Plasmodium parasite in the population via an infected Anopheles
mosquito bite. Fundamental to this process is a switch in parasite
biology
from
asexual
replication
to
sexual
development.
Approximately 0.2–1% of asexual parasites undergo this alter-
native
sexual
developmental
pathway
to
form
mosquito-
infectious male and female gametocytes5. Gametocytogenesis in
Plasmodium falciparum, the species most deadly to humans, takes
place over 10–12 days with the developing gametocytes, initially
sequestered in the bone marrow, re-entering peripheral blood
upon reaching maturity6. Mature gametocytes then maintain an
arrested state awaiting uptake into the mosquito upon blood
feeding. The consequence of this comparatively quiescent state is
an insensitivity to most current antimalarials7 leading to a
situation whereby a patient can be readily cured of malarial
symptoms (killing asexuals) but remain infectious to mosquitoes
and as such able to perpetuate disease spread. Successful trans-
mission itself requires uptake of both male and female gameto-
cytes into the mosquito midgut, which immediately sense a
change in local environment and rapidly differentiate into male
and female gametes. Male gametogenesis involves three rapid
rounds of endomitosis and assembly of eight motile, flagellated
sperm-like gametes8. Female gametogenesis involves expression
of translationally repressed mRNA stored at the gametocyte
stage9. Fertilisation ensues in the midgut forming a motile zygote
that migrates to and through the midgut epithelium before
forming an oocyst, establishing an infected mosquito state.
Transmission is a huge population bottleneck in the parasite life
cycle with natural mosquito infections usually having only ~2–5
oocysts (compared to 1011 asexual parasites in an infected host)10.
The concept of targeting sexual stages specifically, as a strategy
to reduce malaria incidence, has received increased interest
recently11. This follows emerging (re)appreciation that targeting
the malaria parasite at the acute population bottleneck of trans-
mission has potential benefits over asexually targeted therapeutics
both as a means to break the cycle of infection but critically also
as a barrier to the spread of drug-resistance alleles11,12. Con-
ceptually, evolution of resistance to drugs specifically targeting
the transmission stages will take far longer to develop than for
conventional antimalarials, as selective pressure is only applied to
the relatively small (non-replicating) gametocyte population
compared to drugs targeting the ~1011 asexual parasites con-
stantly replicating within a malarial host. Whilst quiescent in the
human host, stage V gametocytes are poised for rapid onward
development immediately upon mosquito blood-feeding, utilising
distinct pathways to achieve their sex-specific roles during
gametogenesis and fertilisation. Despite these observations, most
current gametocyte assays utilise only an indicator of the meta-
bolic viability of the gametocyte to determine compound activity
and/or do not distinguish between male or female gametocytes
e.g. mitotracker7,13, luminescence14,15, metabolic activity16,17 or
are limited to female gametogenesis18. In contrast, the P. falci-
parum Dual Gamete Formation Assay (Pf DGFA) uses male and
female gamete formation as sensitive reporters of the functional
viability (i.e. their ability to undergo further development) of both
gametocytes individually and is highly predictive of transmission-
blocking activity in the current laboratory gold standard trans-
mission assay—the standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA)19.
Finally, whilst high-throughput screening (HTS) of millions of
compounds in pharmaceutical libraries has populated the anti-
malarial development pipeline in the past decade, with promising
new chemotypes targeting the disease-causing asexual stages20–22,
drug activity against other parasite stages have primarily only
been considered when this property added extra value to existing
identified molecules rather than essential properties in their own
right. As such, very few studies have screened for sexual stage-
specific activity without pre-filtering on asexual activity first7.
Here we have undertaken HTS of a large unbiased chemical
diversity library where the primary filter for hit identification is
specifically the ability to target transmission itself, using the Pf
DGFA. Profiling of selected hits revealed a diverse range of
activities both dependent and independent of asexual activity and
some showing gametocyte sex-specific activity. We show that
exemplar molecules from each activity class appear to inhibit
transmission by different mechanisms and that this directly
translates into a blockade of mosquito transmission. In particular,
we identify a novel N-((4-hydroxychroman-4-yl) methyl) sul-
phonamide (N-4HCS) scaffold that rapidly inhibits the process of
male gamete formation in vitro and blocks transmission in vivo in
a mouse model of malaria. The N-4HCS scaffold shows excellent
chemical tractability, favourable physicochemical properties and
promise for further development as a transmission-specific
therapeutic that could be used in new antimalarial combination
therapies.

Gametocyte
and
asexual-targeted
compounds
within
the
GHCDL.
The
Global
Health
Chemical
Diversity
Library
(GHCDL) comprises 68,689 compounds dissimilar to molecules
already known to have antimalarial properties. All molecules
possess lead-like physicochemical properties and are arranged
into structurally similar clusters of between 3 and 14 compounds.
The Pf DGFA measures the functional viability of Stage V male
and female gametocytes as reported by their ability to form male
and female gametes23. The GHCDL was screened in the Pf DGFA
at 2 µM with a 48 h incubation prior to triggering gamete for-
mation, yielding 24 hits with an IC50 < 10 µM (19 male-specific, 3
female-specific, 2 dual-active) (Fig. 1). Of these, 22 hits showed
<50% inhibition at 10 µM against human HepG2 cells (i.e. are
non-toxic) (Supplementary Data 1). Of note, six of the male-
specific compounds possessed a similar N-4HCS core structure.
In parallel the GHCDL was screened against asexual blood
stages at 2 µM over a 72 h incubation using lactate dehydrogenase
activity as a surrogate readout for parasite growth. Screening
yielded 146 hits with an IC50 < 10 µM; 132 of which showed <50%
inhibition at 10 µM against human HepG2 cells (chemically
classified in 16 clusters and 97 singletons) (Supplementary
Data 2). For prioritisation, only asexual-active compounds with
an IC50 < 2 µM were progressed for downstream characterisation
(48 in total).
Multistage biological profiling of hit compounds. Independent
stocks of 26 of the most potent commercially available hit com-
pounds from both gametocyte and asexual screens, were studied
in detail in seven profiling assays (Fig. 2a and Supplementary
Data 3) to assess whether they targeted asexual parasite stages,
mature gametocytes, male or female gametocytes, male or female
gametes or, alternatively, interfered with early mosquito stage
development in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei
(or any combination of above). Combining data gave several
different activity profiles: gamete-targeted (7 compounds that

 showed a male-specific gamete-targeted profile), transmission-
specific (4 compounds male gametocyte-specific and irreversible),
dual asexual-gametocyte targeted (6 compounds, all active against
asexual, male and female gametocytes, and were irreversible) and
asexual-specific (9 compounds) (Fig. 2b).
The gamete-targeted compounds all specifically inhibited
exflagellation (male gamete formation). Moreover, the six N-
4HCS compounds comprising most of this category also inhibited
P.
berghei
ookinete
development
(consistent
with
having
prevented exflagellation). The remaining gamete-targeted com-
pound, DDD01062645, was inactive in the ookinete assay
possibly
indicating
specificity
for
P.
falciparum.
Most
of
the transmission-specific compounds targeted the male gameto-
cyte specifically, the exception being DDD01254473 that was
more potent against female gametocytes than males. It showed
reproducible
submicromolar
activity
in
the
GC-ATP
and
mitotracker assays, suggesting that DDD01254473 may inhibit a
fundamental
metabolic
pathway
more
essential
to
female
gametocyte viability than males. Additionally, DDD01255968
also affected male gamete formation, suggesting it may either
show polypharmacology or target a biological process common to
both stages but absent in asexuals. Five compounds identified in
the Pf DGFA primary screen were found to have weak
micromolar asexual activity (thus did not meet hit potency
criteria in the asexual screen) and so were re-classified as dual
asexual/transmission
active
compounds.
Similarly,
asexual-
specific DDD01027599 showed activity against gametocytes and
was also reclassified. Interestingly all but one (DDD01246628)
dual asexual/transmission active compounds affected both male
and female gametocytes in the Pf DGFA. Coupled to their asexual
activity, it is therefore likely that they target biological pathways
fundamental for survival in the human host. Supporting this
hypothesis, five of the six compounds in the category were also
active in one or both of the gametocyte viability assays.
We investigated whether hit compounds could inhibit liver
stage invasion and growth in an established P. berghei luciferase
sporozoite HepG2 invasion
assay24. Only one compound,
DDD01243506, showed submicromolar activity against P. berghei
liver stage invasion at a similar level to its activity against asexuals
(Pb liver IC50 = 0.52 µM; HepG2 TOX50 ≥ 50 µM; Recombinant
luciferase IC50 ≥ 50 µM; Pf asexual IC50 = 0.66 µM, Supplemen-
tary Data 3). Indeed, no Pf DGFA-active compounds showed
specific activity against liver stages, presumably either due to
fundamental differences in cell biology between different parasite
stages or species-specific differences between P. falciparum and P.
berghei.
To fully evaluate the power of the screening pipeline and to
understand how the profiling categories could translate into
transmission-blocking therapeutics, five compounds were selected
for further study based upon potency and profile (Fig. 3):
DDD01027599 (DDD599/BPCA) and DDD01245291 (DDD291)
representing asexual and Pf DGFA dual-stage actives, respec-
tively; DDD01249504 (DDD504) and DDD01255968 (DDD968)
representing
male-specific
and
gametocyte-specific
actives,
respectively; and finally, DDD01035881 (DDD881), one of the
N-4HCS cluster representing male gamete-specific actives. In
summary, our screening efforts identified 17 confirmed transmis-
sion
blocking
and
9
asexual
targeting
leads
for
further
development.
Phenotypic impact of compounds on male gametogenesis. In
vitro evolution followed by whole-genome analysis is the primary
approach currently used for understanding how compounds act
in malaria parasites25. As it is not currently feasible to generate
resistant mutants to compounds that are only active in the
gametocyte stage (resistance generation requires extensive rounds
of replication in the presence of compound), phenotypic immu-
nofluorescence assays were performed to evaluate compound
activity on male gamete formation. Gametocytes treated with
10 µM of each compound were sampled at 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and
20 min post induction of gamete formation before imaging
(Fig. 4). Individual male cells were then extracted from the images
and analysed for shape and haploid chromosome number/DNA
content to quantitatively measure the progression of DNA
replication (n = 198–668 cells) (Fig. 5a).

asexual stage and male and female gametocyte. Actives were reconfirmed
and cytotoxic compounds removed. Asexual hits were further filtered based
upon potency and 26 compounds selected for further profiling based upon
potency and commercial availability. Five compounds with different
transmission-blocking properties were further investigated for activity
phenotype against male gametogenesis and their physiochemical
properties (DMPK) investigated. Activity of three molecules was confirmed
by standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA)

had commenced DNA replication, possessing microtubule fibres
resembling the initial round of endomitosis of the DMSO control
and an increase in DNA content (Fig. 5b). Most DDD291-treated

 Microtubule staining showed some cells formed spindle fibres
however these appeared disordered in the absence of DNA
replication (Fig. 4f). Contrastingly, the first round of DNA
replication of DDD504-treated male gametocytes appeared with
similar kinetics to the DMSO control (Fig. 5b). However, the
second
and
third
divisions
were
delayed
with
a
smaller
proportion of cells reaching 8n. Interestingly, microtubule
staining appeared to show that during DNA replication, the
spindle poles do not separate and rotate into opposition, but
cluster at one location rather than being evenly spaced out around
the cell periphery. The few cells that do attempt exflagellation did
not have properly segregated genomes and no organised flagellar
structure (Fig. 4d). Most DDD968-treated male gametocytes did
not replicate their DNA and remained with 1n genome copies
(Fig. 5b). However, some cells successfully progressed to 8n with
disordered appearing spindle fibres and resulted in an irregular-
shaped cell possessing a large DNA-rich mass and intense large
foci of tubulin-rich cytoplasm that distorted the overlying
erythrocyte membrane (Figs. 4e and 5b, g). Finally, the gamete-
targeted DDD881, like DDD291, permitted induced gametocytes
to round up but only a few cells replicated their DNA and none
exflagellated (Fig. 5b, h). In activated cells, the usually diffuse
DNA of the gametocyte frequently appeared somewhat con-
densed
with
tubulin-rich
accumulations
at
various
points
surrounding it (Fig. 4g). Although phenotypes do not define a
precise mode of action, the distinct nature of each suggests very
different cellular targets during male gametogenesis.
Preliminary chemical profiling, SAR and DMPK analysis.
Having explored their effects on cell development, each com-
pound was resynthesized either ‘in house’ or re-sourced com-
mercially and their activity re-confirmed in the Pf DGFA
(Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1-4). Sur-
prisingly
freshly
resynthesized
DDD0504,
DDD968
and
DDD599 were all inactive in the Pf DGFA. DDD504 and
DDD968 were hypothesised to be prone to oxidation and
potency of both could be restored by aging the molecules
(Supplementary
Fig.
5).
By
1H-NMR,
aged
compounds
appeared to be a mixture of different products and so the
identity of the active metabolite(s) could not be resolved.
However, preliminary analysis of DDD504 suggests that the
most likely position for its oxidation is the 4-unsubstituted
position in the pyrazole ring, as seen by the loss of the signal
for that proton in the 1H-NMR spectra upon aging (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5). Consequently, study of both DDD504 and
DDD968 was paused pending future identification of active
component(s). The GHCDL-derived stock of DDD599 gave
different LCMS and NMR spectra than resynthesized DDD599
and was positively identified as N-(4-bromophenyl)-2-chlor-
oacetamide (BPCA) (Supplementary Fig. 1-2). When adjusted
for correct molecular weight, BPCA was found to be almost
identically active to GHCDL DDD599 (Asexual IC50 = 0.80 vs.
0.80 µM; Pf DGFA male IC50 = 1.46 vs. 1.38 µM; Pf DGFA
female IC50 = 10.98 vs. 3.43 µM, respectively). We hypothesise
that BPCA is a by-product of synthesis. Unsurprisingly, BPCA
was reactive with nucleophiles (evidenced by being trapped by
glutathione, Supplementary Table 1) and analogues lacking the
reactive chlorine were inactive (Fig. 6). However, a broad range
of activities was found amongst analogues containing the
carbon potentially susceptible to nucleophilic attack with anti-
parasite activity not correlated with general cytotoxicity. Sub-
stituting the bromine atom for a hydroxyl or hydroxymethyl
group gave the highest parasite selectivity. No analogues of
DDD291 were commercially available to conduct structure

profiling stage were selected for detailed study. DDD01027599 (found to actually be BPCA—see Supplementary Fig. 1-2) and DDD01245291 are active
against gametocytes and asexuals; DDD01255968 and DDD01249504 are active specifically against male gametocytes; and DDD01035881 specifically
targets male gamete formation

ranges of parasite cell biology (represented by position and length of coloured bars). Ability to prevent asexual replication was tested by asexual growth
assay20. Ability to inhibit the metabolic viability of stage IV/V gametocytes (Pf GCT) was tested by late stage gametocyte ATP depletion assay (ATP)43
and stage V gametocyte by mitotracker assay (MITO)7. By varying compound incubation period, the carry-over/wash-out (WO)/add-in Pf DGFA assays
permit discrimination between gametocyte- and gamete-targeted activity23. The P. berghei ookinete development assay37 tests activity against early
mosquito stage parasites and cross-reactivity to P. berghei. b Table summarising outcome of compound profiling. Compounds fell into four categories:

clearance rate (4.2 ml min−1 g−1 Liver), but poor membrane

to be essential for activity and replacement with an amide
group resulted in loss of function (Fig. 7 and Supplementary
Text). The replacement of the R′-group thiophene ring with
benzene was tolerated, and decoration with a single halogen
atom enhanced activity (Fig. 7). DDD881 showed good aqu-
eous solubility (>250 µM), with no detectable metabolism in
mouse liver microsomes (<0.5 ml−1 min−1 g Liver) suggesting
a suitably promising profile for in vivo efficacy studies.
Confirmation of transmission-blocking activity in mosquitos.
Compound inhibition in the Pf DGFA accurately predicts inhi-
bition of parasite transmission to the mosquito in the SMFA23.
To directly measure the transmission-blocking efficacy of our
identified hits, we used an established P. falciparum SMFA with a
luciferase oocyst readout26. DDD599/BPCA and DDD291 were
tested at 10 µM in indirect mode in which test compounds were
incubated with gametocytes for 24 h before being fed to
mosquitoes in the absence of compound and presence of oocysts
assessed 8 days later (Fig. 8a and Supplementary Data 4).
DDD291 and DDD599/BPCA blocked transmission strongly and
gave mean normalised luciferase intensities similar to uninfected,
unfed mosquitoes (1.37 and 5.27 arbitrary units, respectively;
unfed = 1.12; DMSO-treated control = 88.77). Furthermore, the
same pattern was observed with prevalence of infection (Fig. 8b),
with no infected mosquitoes observed following DDD291 treat-
ment and BPCA treatment reduced infection prevalence to
25.12% of the DMSO control. As DDD881 was found to exclu-
sively target male gamete formation in the Pf DGFA and potency
was lost if washed out, it was evaluated in the Pf SMFA at 10 µM
in direct mode and consequently was added directly to the blood
meal in the membrane feeder without any pre-exposure to
gametocytes.

Fig. 4 Monitoring the effect of compound treatment on male gamete formation by IFA. Gametocytes were treated for 24 h with DMSO or 10 µM test
compound and then gamete formation triggered by the addition of ookinete medium and reduction to room temperature. Aliquots were sampled at
different time points and immediately fixed before being stained directly for α-tubulin (green), glycophorin A (red) and DNA via DAPI labelling (blue).
Images show representative non-induced cells (0 min), representative cells during gamete formation progression (2–10 min), and representative cells
showing the most advanced phenotype at 20 min. a Upon activation, male gametocytes initially round up before undergoing three endomitotic genome
replications, egressing from the surrounding erythrocyte membrane and releasing up to eight flagellated gametes. b Images from left to right show DMSO-
treated cells undergoing normal male gamete formation over 20 min. Male gametocytes initially have an elongated morphology with a faint nucleus,
relatively homogenous tubulin distribution and are surrounded by an erythrocyte membrane. Upon induction of gametogenesis, cells round up and begin
three rounds of endomitosis, with ordered microtubule spindle fibres and increasingly intense DNA staining. Towards the end of gametogenesis, the
surrounding erythrocyte membrane is shed and up to eight microgametes emerge from the cell possessing a microtubule-rich flagellum and one replicated
genome. c DDD599/BPCA-treated cells; d DDD504-treated cells; e DDD968-treated cells; f DDD291-treated cells; g DDD881-treated cells. Bars = 5 µm

Fig. 5 Computer-aided quantification of male gamete formation from IFA images. Individual cells were extracted from IFA images stained for α-tubulin,
glycophorin A and DNA from samples fixed between 0 and 20 min post induction of gamete formation (n = 195–668 cells per compound treatment). Cell
shape (elongated/irregular vs. round) and haploid chromosome number (1nto 8n) were estimated from α-tubulin and DAPI staining (DNA content)
respectively (arbitrary units). a Schematic diagram illustrating how cell shape and DNA content parameters vary over the course of male gamete formation.
Initially gametocytes are elongated with 1n haploid chromosome number. Upon induction, they round up then undergo three rounds of DNA replication
whilst maintaining a round shape. Finally, male gamete release (exflagellation) changes the shape of the cell whilst maintaining a high DNA content.
b Genome copy number during gamete formation was estimated by benchmarking mean DAPI intensity with respect to the non-activated gametocytes at
t = 0 min (1n) and exflagellating cells at t = 10–20 min (8n). DNA replication was compared between the DMSO control and five test compounds.

 DDD0881 on day 3 of infection, 24 h prior to mosquito feed.
DDD881 was also administered similarly on day 4 of infection
only 30 min prior to mosquito feed in a separate cohort of mice
(Supplementary Data 5). Twenty-four-hour exposure to DDD291
did not affect asexual parasitaemia but suppressed gametocytae-
mia ~6-fold in both mice compared to vehicle-only controls
(Fig. 9a, b), however due to the very high baseline gametocytae-
mia saturating mosquitoes (vehicle control groups had mean
oocyst intensities of 246.3 and 281.0 oocysts per mosquito), it was
not possible to measure a reduction in transmission at the oocyst
level (Fig. 9c). DDD881 specifically targets male gametes
therefore it was unsurprising that asexual parasitaemia and
gametocytaemia were not impacted by treatment. If administered
24 h before mosquito feeding, DDD881 showed no transmission
blocking efficacy at the oocyst level. However, if administered 30
min before the feed, a 99.6% blockade on oocyst intensity was
observed. Supporting these observations, pharmacokinetic analy-
sis of naïve mice dosed similarly with DDD881 showed that after
an initial distribution phase, plasma concentrations remained
stable at ~1000 ng ml−1 up to 120 min after dosing before being
eliminated, with an approximate half-life of 90 min (Fig. 9d).
Combined, these data suggest that, with improved stability or
slow release, the N-4HCS scaffold could provide a potent starting
point for future transmission-blocking antimalarials.
Discussion
Using transmission as the first screening filter yielded novel
chemical scaffolds that were not identified in the parallel asexual

 screen and showed inhibition in mosquito transmission assays.
This suggests that within the ~7 million compounds already
screened by the research community for asexual activity and
discarded, there are transmission-blocking molecules still waiting
to be discovered. Male gametocytes are much more sensitive to
antimalarial compounds than females23,27. Likely this is due to
the rapid and complex nature of male gamete formation which
provides more opportunities for intervention. This is further
evidenced by the five distinct inhibition phenotypes of the five
compounds studied here (Fig. 4), and also highlights the utility of
phenotypic immunofluorescence to shed light on drug targets for
which resistance selection is impractical. DDD599/BPCA is a
small reactive molecule with poor parasite selectivity. Interest-
ingly however, varying the bromophenyl group greatly affected
both
activity
and

and
analogues therefore may make promising tool molecules for
covalent ligand discovery of essential proteins in the parasite
genome28. DDD504 and DDD968 showed gametocyte-specific
activity. Conceptually this class of sexual stage specific anti-
malarial would be partnered with a schizonticidal combination
therapy to both cure malarial symptoms and prevent onward
transmission to mosquitoes, effectively protecting both infected
persons and the much larger population at risk of infection11.
Both compounds showed striking phenotypes against male
gamete formation (Fig. 4d) and work is now ongoing to identify
the active component(s) within these unstable compounds to
determine their suitability for further progression. In vitro,
DDD291 showed low micromolar activity against asexuals, and
both male and female gametocytes (Supplementary Data 3).

Of all hits, the N-4HCS scaffold shows the greatest promise as a
new chemotype
for
transmission-specific
antimalarial
drug
development. It is fast-acting, non-toxic and amenable to further
medicinal chemistry. Its precise mode of action is unknown;
however, it specifically targets early male gamete formation and
arrests development before DNA replication. Several other
molecules targeting male gamete formation are under develop-
ment as potential therapeutics29–31. Clinical patients treated with
current artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) even supple-
mented with a low dose of the only licenced transmission-
blocking therapeutic, primaquine, are still infectious to mosqui-
toes for several days after treatment32,33. To immediately halt and
maintain a block in transmission, administration of a DDD881-
like molecule either with a longer half-life, reformulated for slow
release, or administered over multiple doses, could close this
transmission window between treatment and complete cure
during which drug resistance is being selected for and could
escape. Given the low toxicity to human cells and coupled to
future improvements in bioavailability/longevity, N-4HCS could
be used as a chemical vaccine in mass drug administration
campaigns. We envision that in targeted malaria endemic areas,
the entire population could be treated with intermittent curative
doses of a conventional schizonticidal therapy during the dry
season to disrupt the residual parasite reservoir in humans and
then use maintenance dose(s) of a DDD881-like molecule to
protect the mosquito population from being re-infected as the
rainy season begins to suppress new incidences of malarial
infection. Based on these findings, we believe further investigation
of similar transmission-specific blocking antimalarials is clearly
warranted.
Methods
Provision of the GHCDL and screening conditions. The Global Health Chemical
Diversity Library (GHCDL) was compiled by Dundee University Drug Discovery
Unit (DDU) comprising 68,689 compounds with lead-like properties enriched for
chemotypes not known to have been previously screened against malaria parasites.
The library was provided by DDU dissolved in 100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in
screening-ready 384-well plates (781091, Greiner). Plates arrived frozen and were
stored at −20 °C and only thawed immediately prior to use. Chemical structures
for the GHCDL can be accessed via the ChEMBL Database34. The library was
screened in the Pf DGFA with a single replicate at 2 µM with a 48 h pre-incubation
of test compounds with stage V gametocytes prior to triggering the gamete for-
mation readout. The initial hit rate was low and so a generous cut-off of >30%
inhibition was used yielding 251 hits. Upon re-test in dose response, 24 compounds
showed an IC50 < 10 µM. The GHCDL was also screened against asexual parasites
with a single replicate at 2 µM over 72 h yielding 412 hits with a cut-off of >50%
inhibition. Upon retest in dose response, 416 showed an IC50 < 10 µM. Compounds
were clustered using the OSIRIS DataWarrior using the FragFP algorithm with a
0.8 cut-off.
Culture of P. falciparum asexual and sexual blood stages. P. falciparum
NF54 strain (originally isolated from an imported malaria case in the Netherlands in
the 1980s; BEI Resources, cat. no. MRA-1000) asexual and sexual stages culture was
performed as previously described35. Gametocyte cultures were initiated at 1% asexual
ring stage parasitaemia and 4% haematocrit in 40 ml final volume. To induce
gametocyte production, complete culture medium (CM) (RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 25 mM HEPES, 50 µg ml−1 hypoxanthine, 2 g l−1 NaHCO3 and 10% pooled
human male type A+ serum) was replaced daily for 14 days without fresh erythrocyte
addition. Human serum was obtained from Interstate Blood Bank, A+ serotype; no
aspirin 2 h before drawing and no antimalarials 2 weeks before drawing. On day 14
after culture induction, gametocyte production was assessed by thin smear and
Giemsa staining, and exflagellation accurately counted in a haemocytometer35.
Gametocyte cultures with >0.2% exflagellation (compared to total erythrocyte cell
number) were deemed acceptable for use in the Pf DGFA. Note, all human biological
samples were sourced ethically and their research use was in accord with the terms of
the informed consents under an IRB/EC approved protocol.

 P. falciparum dual gamete formation assay (Pf DGFA). In screening mode, the
assay was performed as described in Delves et al.35 with a mean Z′ factor of 0.56 ±
0.14 (SD) (male) and 0.71 ± 0.17 (SD) (female). Pooled mature gametocyte cultures
with the capacity to yield >0.2% exflagellation (of total cells) were diluted in CM to
14 million cells per ml and so that 700,000 cells were dispensed in 50 µl into each
well of the warmed 384-well screening plates. Parasites were incubated in the plates
with compounds for 48 h in a humidified chamber under 92%N2/5% CO2/3% O2
gas mix before gamete formation was triggered by addition of 10 µl per well
ookinete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 50 µg ml−1
hypoxanthine, 2 g l−1 NaHCO3, 100 µM xanthurenic acid) containing 0.5 µg ml−1
anti-Pfs25 clone 4B7 (BEI Resources, cat. no. MRA-315) conjugated to the fluor-
ophore Cy3 (GE Healthcare), and also by cooling the plate at 4 °C for 4 min and
then a further 5 min at 28 °C. Exflagellation was recorded immediately by
brightfield microscopy using a Nikon Ti-E widefield microscope at ×4 objective,
×1.5 zoom, recording a 10-frame video time-lapse over 2 s for each well. After-
wards, plates were incubated in the dark at 28 °C for a further 24 h to allow female
gametes to maximally express Pfs25 on their surface. Female gamete formation was
recorded by single-image fluorescence microscopy using the same microscope and
magnification as above. Exflagellation and female gamete formation were quanti-
fied by specific algorithms designed with the open-source ICY Image Analysis
software36. Data were normalised to the percentage of inhibition of the biological
response by using positive (12 µM Gentian Violet, Ctrl2) or negative (0.5% DMSO,

Assay performance statistics, such as signal to background ratio, Z′ and robust
3×SD activity cut-off were calculated using templates in ActivityBase XE (IDBS,
Guilford, Surrey, UK). Hit population analysis and visualisation were conducted
using Spotfire DecisionSite (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, Massachusetts). The pIC50
(−log IC50) values were obtained using the ActivityBase XE nonlinear regression
function in the full curve analysis bundle. In screening mode, the Pf DGFA
achieved a mean Z′ factor of 0.56 ± 0.14 (SD) (male) and 0.71 ± 0.17 (SD) (female).
In profiling mode, the Pf DGFA was performed in 96-well plates23 in wash-out
and add-in formats to aid manual manipulation steps. In the wash-out format,
gametocytes were incubated for 24 h with test compounds in round-bottomed 96
well plates and then culture medium replaced three times over 6 h, to remove as
much of the compound as possible from the well. Gametocytes were then rapidly
transferred to a flat bottomed 96-well plate containing ookinete medium and anti-
Pfs25 to trigger gametogenesis and then imaged and quantified as above (in the
absence of test compound), hence gametogenesis was assayed in the absence of
compound. In add-in format, gametocytes were added directly to flat-bottomed 96-
well plates containing test compounds, ookinete medium and anti-Pfs25.
Gametogenesis was triggered simultaneously with compound treatment hence only
the process of gametogenesis was exposed to compound.
Whole-cell time extended asexual growth assay. Asexual activity was assayed
via Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase activity (pLDH), a surrogate of asexual
parasite growth20. Cultures of 3D7 strain (BEI Resources, cat. no. MRA-102)
asexual blood stages at 0.25% parasitaemia and 2% haematocrit, in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 5% Albumax and 150 µM hypoxanthine, were dispensed into
384-well plates (25 µl per well) containing the test compounds. 2 µM artesunate
and DMSO were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Parasites
were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, under 5% CO2/5% O2/90% N2 and then frozen at
−70 °C. Plates were warmed at RT and 70 µl per well of reaction solution (100 mM
sodium L-lactate, 100 mM 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (APAD), 125 µM
NitroBlue tetrazolium (NBT), 200 µl ml−1 diaphorase, 0.5% tween 20, 100 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8) were added. After plate mixing, NBT reduction was measured by
absorbance at 650 nm using Envision (Perkin Elmer).
Gametocytocidal ATP-based bioluminescence assay (GC-ATP). The metabolic
viability of late stage gametocytes was determined using a gametocyte ATP bio-
luminescence assay16. Stage IV–V 3D7 gametocyte cultures were double-purified
by density gradient sedimentation over NycoPrep® followed by magnetic isolation.
Then, parasites (50 µl per well containing 12,500 gametocytes) were added to
compound pre-dispensed 384-well plates (781091, Greiner) and incubated at 37 °C
for 48 h under 5% CO2/3% O2/92% N2. BacTiter-Glo® kit (G8231, Promega) was
used to determine the ATP levels of viable parasites according to manufacturer’s
instructions. After reagent addition (50 µl per well), luminescence of the plates was
measured using a microplate reader (HTS counter Victor, Wallac).
Gametocytocidal MitoTracker-based viability assay. As another independent
assessment of the metabolic viability of compound-treated stage V gametocytes, the
Saponin-lysis Sexual Stage Assay (SaLSSA) was employed7. A volume of 100 nl of
test compounds were pre-dispensed in 384-well plates (781091-2B, Greiner) in 12-
point dose response (25 µM to 1.41 × 10−4 µM), prior to the addition of syn-
chronous NF54 stage V gametocytes (40 µl at 0.70% gametocytaemia). Assay plates
were then incubated for 72 h in a low oxygen environment (92% N2, 5% CO2, 3%
O2) before a 10 µl MitoTracker Red CMXRos (2.5 µM) and saponin solution
(0.13%w/v) was added. Plates were returned to 37 °C for 1 h to allow for complete
red blood cell lysis, after which viable gametocytes were detected using an Operetta
high-content imaging system. Analysis was performed using the Harmony package
software, with potency calculated relative to puromycin (positive control) and
DMSO (negative control).
P. berghei ookinete development assay (Pb ODA). All mouse procedures were
performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (PPL
70/7185) and approved by the Imperial College Animal Welfare and Ethical Review
Body (AWERB). The ability of test compounds to inhibit P. berghei early mosquito
stage development was tested in the Ookinete Development Assay37 with a few
exceptions. Anaesthetised 6- to 8-week-old female Tucks Ordinary (TO) mice
infected with P. berghei strain CTRPpGFP38 were rapidly exsanguinated by cardiac
puncture and 500 µl of blood diluted in 25 ml of ookinete medium supplemented
with 20% foetal bovine serum. Immediately the blood/medium mixture was dis-
pensed by multichannel pipette into 384 well plates containing pre-plated test
compounds. 10 µM cycloheximide and DMSO were used as the positive and
negative controls, respectively. Plates were stored in the dark in a humidified
incubator at 18 °C for 24 h. Ookinete production was imaged by fluorescence
microscopy of GFP expression under the ookinete-specific CTRP promoter using a
Nikon Ti-E widefield microscope and ×10 objective. Ookinete production was
quantified using ICY and percentage inhibition calculated as above with reference
to positive and negative controls.
Determination of compound activity profile. Compounds were classified as
asexual-specific if they showed IC50s < 12.5 µM in the asexual assay but no activity
in any other profiling assay. Compounds were classified as dual asexual-gametocyte
targeted if they possessed asexual activity as above but also an IC50 < 12.5 µM
against male or female gametocytes in the 48 h Pf DGFA carry-over format and
maintained potency after washing out in the wash-out format and had no activity
in the add-in format. Compounds were classified as transmission-specific if they
were inactive up to 20 µM against asexual parasites but showed IC50s < 12.5 µM
against male or female gametocytes in the 48 h Pf DGFA carry-over format and
maintained potency after washing out in the wash-out format and had no activity
in the add-in format (with the exception of DDD968 which was also active in the
add-in format). Compounds were classified as gamete-targeted if they were inactive
against asexuals up to 20 µM but showed IC50s < 12.5 µM against male or female
gametocytes in the 48 h Pf DGFA carry-over format and also activity >12.5 µM in
the add-in format but became inactive if washed-out.
P. falciparum SMFA. SMFAs were performed commercially by TropiQ Health
Sciences (Nijmegen, The Netherlands)26. Cultures of mature stage V gametocytes
of P. falciparum expressing a GFP-Luciferase fusion protein under the control of
the hsp70 promoter were treated with DMSO or 10 µM of test compound for 24 h
(indirect mode). They were then mixed with uninfected erythrocytes and pelleted.
The cell pellet was resuspended in human serum to form the blood meal and fed to
Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. For direct feeding, gametocytes did not receive
pre-exposure to test compounds and test compound was added directly to the
blood meal immediately prior to mosquito feeding. Eight days after infection,
mosquitoes were individually processed and their lysate assessed for luciferase
activity in comparison to uninfected mosquitoes.
P. berghei mosquito feeding assays. Six- to eight-week female T0 mice were
treated with phenylhydrazine 3 days prior to intraperitoneal (IP) inoculation with
100 µl of mouse blood infected with the constitutively GFP expressing P. berghei
507 strain39. On day 3 after infection, thin blood smears were taken from tail blood
to quantify parasitaemia and gametocytaemia. Mice were divided randomly into
groups of two, received IP injections of 50 mg kg−1 of test compounds or vehicle
control (33% DMSO in dH2O) and fed to Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes 24 h
later. The exception was two mice that were dosed with DDD01035881 on day 4 of
infection only 30 min prior to mosquito feeding. Twenty-four hours after feeding,
unfed mosquitoes were removed and remaining mosquitoes maintained for a
further 9 days on sucrose solution. Mosquito midguts were then dissected, imaged
and oocysts quantified by semi-automated computer analysis40.
Hep G2 cytotoxicity assay. Actively growing HepG2 human cells (85011430,
European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures) were detached from the
culture surface with trypsin and counted using a Cellometer (Nexcelom). Then, 12
ml of culture per plate required were prepared at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells per ml
using Minimum Essential Medium (41090, GIBCO) supplemented with 10% foetal
bovine serum (10106–169, GIBCO) and 1% NEAA solution (11140–035, GIBCO).
Cells were seeded (25 µl per well) in 384-well plates (781098, Greiner) with pre-
stamped compounds and controls (DMSO and Doxorubicin 50 µM) (125 nl per
well) using a WellMate dispenser (Thermo Scientific). Cells were incubated at 37 °C
and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 48 h. After incubation, 5 µl of Resazurin
(R7017, Sigma) per well (45 µM final concentration) were added and plates were
kept at 37 °C for 3.5–4 h. Plates were then read on Pherastar LS plate reader (BMG)

TOX50s were calculated using ActivityBase templates.
P. berghei liver stage assay. Compound inhibition of P. berghei sporozoite liver
infection was assessed in a high-throughput luciferase assay24. 1536-well plates
(789173-F, Greiner Bio-One) were pre-seeded with 5 µl HepG2-A16-CD81EGFP
cells grown in DMEM (11965–092, Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (35–011-CV,
Corning) and 1× Pen Strep Glutamine (10378–016, Invitrogen). Then, 50 nl of
compound in DMSO was dispensed in 12-point serial dilution dose-response
format (50 µM to 2.82 × 10−4 µM), and incubated overnight.A. stephensi mosqui-
toes infected with P. berghei-ANKA-GFP-Luc-SMCON (Pb-Luc)41 sporozoites
bearing the antifolate-resistance-conferring Toxoplasma gondii dihydrofolate
reductase-thymidylate synthase selectable marker, pyR2. After dissection,
~1000 sporozoites in 5 µl screening media (DMEM, 11965–092, Invitrogen; 5%
FBS, 35–011-CV, Corning; 5x Pen Strep Glutamine, 10378–016, Invitrogen) were
added per well and incubated for 48 h (37 °C, 5% CO2). Bioluminescence was
measured using an EnVision microplate reader (Perkin Elmer), following the
addition of 2 µl per well of Bright-Glo™ (Promega). Compound toxicity against
HepG2 cells was determined in parallel by measuring cellular ATP levels reported
by luciferase activity. Methods were similar to the P. berghei liver stage assay,
except for the addition of CellTiter-Glo® (Promega) as a detection reagent. DMSO
(0.5%) was used as a negative control in both assays, with Atovaquone (5 µM) and
Puromycin (10 µM) acting as positive controls in the P. berghei and toxicity assays,
respectively.
Recombinant luciferase inhibition assay. A counter-screen to the P. berghei liver
stage assay was run against recombinant luciferase (Photinus pyralis) to measure
the intrinsic bioluminescence inhibition from select compounds. Briefly, com-
pounds were plated in 12-point serial dose response (50–2.82 × 10−4 µM) in 1536-
well opaque-bottom plates (789173-F, Greiner Bio-One). A 20 pM QuantiLum®
Recombinant Luciferase (E1701, Promega) containing solution was made in
screening media (DMEM, 11965–092, Invitrogen; 5% FBS, 35–011-CV, Corning;
5x Pen Strep Glutamine, 10378–016, Invitrogen), and 8 µl were added to each well.
After 1 h incubation at room temperature, 2 µl of Bright-Glo™ (E2610, Promega)
were dispensed per well, and bioluminescence was immediately measured using the
EnVision microplate reader (PerkinElmer). DMSO (0.5%) and Luciferase
Inhibitor-2 (9.8 µM) (119114, MilliporeSigma) served as negative and positive
controls, respectively.
Immunofluorescence staining and modelling of exflagellation. Day 14 game-
tocyte culture was divided into 4 ml aliquots and treated either with DMSO or
10 µM test compound. After 24 h, 500 µl aliquots of the non-activated gametocytes
were fixed in an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) warmed to 37 °C to
generate Time = 0 min (t = 0) samples. Gamete formation was induced in the
remainder of the cultures by cooling to RT and addition of 500 µl ookinete med-
ium. At t = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 20 min 500 µl of culture was removed and
immediately fixed in equal volume of 8% PFA at room temperature for 15 min.
Fixed cells were diluted in PBS and allowed to settle onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass
coverslips overnight. The next day, cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized in
0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked in PBS + 10% FBS. Cells were stained with mouse
anti-alpha tubulin (Sigma) clone DM1A (1:500 dilution) and rabbit anti-Glyco-
phorin A (Abcam) clone EPR8200 (1:1000 dilution). Staining was visualised with
anti-mouse Alexa448 and anti-rabbit Alexa555 (Thermo-Fisher) both at 1:1000
dilution. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with VectaShield mountant
(Vector Laboratories) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to visua-
lise cellular DNA. Cells were imaged at random (n = 195–668 cells per test
compound) using a Nikon Ti-E widefield microscope using a × 100 objective lens
and taken in 0.2 µm slice z-stack images to capture the whole cell. All images were
converted to maximum intensity projections in NIS Elements v4.20 and all further
image processing performed in ICY. Individual cells were manually selected and
automatically extracted from each image using the Active Contours plugin gated to
the tubulin staining. Using the ROI Statistics plugin, the following parameters were
calculated for each cell and exported to MS Excel: Cell area, Cell roundness, Cell
elongation, and Average intensity of blue channel (DNA). In the DMSO control
image collection, it was found that Cell roundness and Cell elongation were pro-
portional and excellent discriminators of falciform-shaped non-activated gameto-
cytes and round activated gametocytes. Outlier cells from the curve were all
exflagellating (Supplementary Fig. 6). These two parameters were combined as a
ratio of roundness:elongation to produce the parameter Cell shape. Cellular DNA
content was estimated by multiplying the average pixel intensity of the blue
channel (after subtracting the background intensity of an empty area in the same
parent image) with the total cell area.
Generation of active DDD504 and DDD698 by aging. Freshly synthesised
powder was dissolved to 30 mM in DMSO and aged for 10 days at room tem-
perature in the light or 10 days at 37 °C in the dark with tube caps opened every
2 days to allow air to circulate. In the light, potency of DDD504 was restored giving
an IC50 of 381 nM (compared to the untreated compound and compound incu-
bated in the dark at 37 °C that were inactive). Contrastingly, light did not affect
DDD986, however restoration of activity appeared to be linked to temperature as
prolonged incubation at 37 °C yielded greater activity than when incubated at room
temperature (IC50 = 5.85 and 15.9 µM, respectively).
DMPK and compound stability analysis. DMPK analyses were performed by the
Dundee University Drug Discovery Unit and BPCA/DDD599 stability analysis
were undertaken by chemists at GlaxoSmithKline using in-house, standardised
approaches42.
