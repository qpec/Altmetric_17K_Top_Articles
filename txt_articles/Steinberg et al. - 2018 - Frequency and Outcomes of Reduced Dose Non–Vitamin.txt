Background-—Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are indicated for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF)
but require lower doses in certain patients. We sought to describe the frequency, appropriateness (according to Food and Drug
Administration labeling), and outcomes of patients prescribed reduced doses of NOACs in community practice.
Methods and Results-—We analyzed data from the ORBIT-AF II (The Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial
Fibrillation II) registry, a prospective, national, observational registry of AF patients. Among 7925 AF patients receiving NOACs, we
assessed patterns of use of reduced NOAC doses and associated cardiovascular and bleeding outcomes at median follow-up of 1 year.
Overall,6636 patients (84%) received a NOAC at standard dose, which was consistent withUSFoodand Drug Administration labeling in
6376 (96%). Reduced NOAC dose was prescribed to 1289 (16% overall), which was consistent with Food and Drug Administration
labelinginonly555patients(43%).ComparedwiththosewhoseNOACdosewasappropriatelyreduced,patientsreceivinginappropriate
dose reductions were younger (median age 79 versus 84, P<0.0001) and had lower ORBIT bleeding risk scores (26% ≥4 versus 45%,
P<0.0001).Comparedwiththoseappropriatelyreceivingstandarddosing,patientsreceivinginappropriatelyreduced-doseNOACshad
higher unadjusted rates of thromboembolic events (2.11 versus 1.35 events per 100 patient years, hazard ratio 1.56, 95% confidence
interval 0.92-2.67) and death (6.77 versus 2.60, hazard ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval 1.86-3.67). After adjustment, outcomes
were not significantly different but tended to favor patients dosed appropriately.
Conclusions-—The majority of dose reductions of NOACs in AF are inconsistent with US Food and Drug Administration
recommendations. There appear to be opportunities to improve current NOAC dosing in community practice.

 T
he development of non–vitamin K antagonist oral
anticoagulants (NOACs) for the prevention of stroke in
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) provided an alternative to
vitamin K antagonists, and these NOACs do not require as
frequent dose adjustment. However, NOAC dose does need to
be modified based on certain clinical features such as renal
function, weight, age, and concomitant medications.1-4 The
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved prescribing
guidance includes dose recommendations based on the
clinical trial results and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
data.5-8
Previously we described the frequency and outcomes
associated with off-label dosing of these agents in AF.9 Yet a
significant proportion of patients are on reduced doses of
NOACs, and prescribers often underdose medications in
an effort to “do no harm.” The FDA previously expressed
concerns regarding off-label underdosing of anticoagulants.9,10
In the present analysis we sought to describe the contem-
porary practice of NOAC dose reductions in the community
and subsequent outcomes. The primary objectives of our
study were (1) to describe the proportion and characteristics
of AF patients who received reduced NOAC dosing; (2) to
identify what proportion of dose reductions was appropriate
based on FDA-approved dosing recommendations; and (3) to
describe clinical events in patients receiving appropriate
dosing versus those inappropriately prescribed reduced doses
of NOACs.
Methods
Patient Cohort and Data Collection
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be
made
available
to
other
researchers
for
purposes
of
reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. We used
data from ORBIT-AF II (The Outcomes Registry for Better
Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation II), a nationwide AF
registry conducted from 2013 to 2016. Patients with AF treated
by primary care physicians, cardiologists, neurologists, and/or
electrophysiologists were enrolled from a nationally represen-
tative sample of sites. Enrollment was geared toward capturing
a contemporary cohort of AF patients treated with NOACs: only
patients with either (1) new-onset AF within the previous
6 months and/or (2) AF patients recently switched to a NOAC
within 3 months were eligible. Additionally, patients had to be
21 years or older and have electrocardiographically docu-
mented AF that was not due to a reversible cause (eg,
hyperthyroidism,
cardiac
surgery).
Consecutive
eligible
patients were enrolled at each site and followed clinically every
6 months out to at least 2 years. Baseline data are collected at
enrollment, which is by inclusion criteria within 6 months of AF
diagnosis or 3 months of NOAC initiation.
Data elements were entered in a web-based case report
form and were derived primarily from the patients’ medical
records and the treating physicians. They included demo-
graphics, medical history, vital signs, electrocardiography,
laboratory and imaging data, and AF history (including
symptoms). Incident procedures, medications, and adverse
events were captured during follow-up. Outcomes included
stroke or systemic embolism, which was adjudicated using
primary source documentation (deidentified medical records).
Major bleeding was defined according to the International
Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition, which
include ≥1 of the following criteria11: (1) fall in hemoglobin
≥2 g/dL, (2) transfusion of ≥2 units of packed red blood cells
or whole blood, (3) any bleeding in a critical site (intracranial,
intraspinal, intraocular, intra-articular, pericardial, retroperi-
toneal, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome), or
(4) fatal bleeding. Additional outcomes included cause-
specific hospitalization (cardiovascular, bleeding, or noncar-
diovascular, nonbleeding), and mortality. Full details of the
design and methods of the ORBIT-AF II registry have been
published previously.12
Study Population
The current study included patients treated with NOACs who
had follow-up data available. Patients without NOAC dosing
available, those with dosing other than standard or reduced
dose (eg, NOAC every other day), and patients on warfarin
were excluded. The group was then stratified by NOAC dosing
—standard or reduced (Table S1): for dabigatran, 150 mg
(standard) and 75 mg (reduced) twice daily; rivaroxaban
20 mg (standard) and 15 mg (reduced) daily; apixaban 5 mg
(standard) and 2.5 mg (reduced) twice daily; and edoxaban
60 mg (standard) and 30 mg (reduced) daily.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• More than 1 in 10 non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoag-
ulant patients receives reduced doses of the drugs.
• The majority of dose reductions of non–vitamin K antagonist
oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation are inconsistent with
US Food and Drug Administration recommendations.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Inappropriate dose reductions of non–vitamin K antagonist
oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation
may impact clinical outcomes in these patients.
• There appear to be opportunities to improve current non–
vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant dosing in community
practice.

Reduced NOAC Doses in AF

 In addition, dosing at the patient level (for standard and
reduced groups) was categorized as appropriate or inappro-
priate based on the approved FDA labeling for each agent
(Table S1).1-4,9 This included assessments of renal function,
as well as weight, age, and chronic concomitant medications
(where applicable). Patients for whom the selected NOAC was
contraindicated were classified as off-label (eg, patients with
end-stage renal disease on dialysis or those with preserved
renal function receiving edoxaban [contraindicated in patients
with creatinine clearance >95 mL/min]).1
Raw and adjusted clinical event rates were calculated and
compared across dosing strata. These included thromboem-
bolic events (stroke, non–central nervous system embolism,
transient ischemic attack), myocardial infarction, major bleed-
ing, bleeding hospitalization, death, and the composite of major
adverse cardiovascular and neurological events (ie, transient
ischemic attack, stroke, non–central nervous system embo-
lism, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death).
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics are presented as frequencies and
percentages for categorical variables and medians (interquar-
tile range) or means (standard deviation) for continuous
variables. Univariate comparisons between groups were made
using the chi-squared test for categorical variables and the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables.
Raw frequencies are presented for dosing categories,
appropriate versus inappropriate, as defined by US labeling.
The dosing categorization was calculated using all relevant
data (creatinine, creatinine clearance using the Cockroft-Gault
estimation,13 weight, age, and/or concomitant medications),
as previously reported.9 This included both doses prescribed
that were higher than recommended (or contraindicated) and
those that were lower than recommended.
The incidence rate of outcomes per 100 patient-years of
follow-up and corresponding 95% confidence intervals are
presented first for those treated with reduced NOAC doses
and those on the standard NOAC dose. All available follow-up
was used in the calculation of these rates. These incidence
rates were calculated only among those who were receiving
NOAC doses consistent with US labeling (on-label).
Last, unadjusted and adjusted analyses of all patients
recommended to receive standard dose, stratified by what
they
actually
received
(standard
versus
inappropriately
reduced) were performed for patients on rivaroxaban and
apixaban. Only these 2 drugs were considered because of
limited power in patients receiving other agents. Overlap
propensity weighting was performed for adjustment of these
outcomes.14 Overlap weights produce exact covariate balance
and greater precision by more heavily weighting those with a
reasonable chance of receiving either treatment compared
with those with extreme propensities who are very likely to
receive a particular treatment. A list of covariates included in
the logistic regression model to determine appropriate
propensity weights can be found in Table S2. Missing data
were accounted for using the first imputed data set from
multiply imputed data. Linearity was assessed for all contin-
uous
covariates,
and
any
nonlinear
associations
were
accounted for using linear splines.
Analyses of dosing were then performed using Cox
proportional hazards models, applying the propensity weights
for the adjusted results. Both the unadjusted and propensity-
weighted hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence
interval (CI) are presented.
Sensitivity Analyses
Due to the dynamic nature of renal function, reevaluation of
dosing distributions was performed after dosing categoriza-
tion had been liberalized to allow patients with borderline
renal function (ie, within 5 mL/min [�10%] of the dosing
cutoff) to be recategorized as “appropriately” dose reduced.
An additional, propensity-matched adjustment was per-
formed to further assess outcomes between patients receiving
standard dosing and those inappropriately dose reduced.
Propensity score matching was performed in order to match
subjects receiving the reduced dosage inappropriately with
those appropriately receiving the standard dosage. Matching
was performed separately among those on rivaroxaban and
those on apixaban, with a 1-to-1 match obtained for each drug.
A table comparing the standardized differences of covariates
after matching can be found in Table S3. The HRs of those
inappropriately receiving the reduced dosage relative to those
appropriately receiving the standard dosage are presented. The
corresponding 95% CIs and P-values are also included.
Study Management
The study was performed and coordinated by the Duke
Clinical Research Institute. The ORBIT-AF II registry was
approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board as
well as all local authorities pursuant to local site regulations.
All patients provided written, informed consent. All analyses
of the aggregate, deidentified data were performed by the
Duke Clinical Research Institute using SAS software (version
9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
The overall ORBIT-AF II population included 13 375 patients
from 244 sites enrolled from February 2013 to July 2016.

 missing or nonstandard NOAC dosing (n=82), patients in
whom appropriateness of recommended dosing could not be
determined (n=425), and patients without follow-up yet
available (n=1578), the analysis population was 7925 from
244 sites—6636 patients (84%) receiving standard-dosed
NOACs and 1289 (16%) receiving reduced doses, with median
follow-up of 1 year.
Appropriateness of dose adjustments, stratified by dose
level (standard and reduced), for the overall population and by
agent is shown in Figure 1. Overall, 96% of patients receiving
standard NOAC doses were consistent with the package
insert, whereas only 43% of patients receiving reduced-dose
NOACs fulfilled FDA-recommended criteria for this dose.
Patterns of dose reduction appeared to vary across agents.
Patient characteristics, stratified by dose level and dose
appropriateness, are shown in Table 1. Compared with
appropriately dose-reduced patients, those receiving reduced
NOAC doses inappropriately were younger (median age 79
versus 84, P<0.0001), more likely male (51% versus 36%,
P<0.0001), and had lower ORBIT bleeding scores (26% ≥4
versus 45%, P<0.0001). Distribution of dose reduction,
stratified by ORBIT bleeding score, is shown in Figure 2.
Use of inappropriate dose reductions appeared to be highest
among patients with the lowest bleeding risk (64% for ORBIT
bleeding score 0-2 versus 43% for ≥4).
Crude event numbers, rates, and 95% CIs for patients on
standard and reduced NOAC doses are shown in Table 2
(only among patients receiving doses according to the FDA
package
labeling).
Across
event
types,
including
thromboembolic,
bleeding,
and
mortality
end
points,
patients treated with reduced NOAC doses were observed
to have higher event rates than those receiving standard
doses.
Among 6584 patients treated with rivaroxaban and
apixaban, who were recommended to receive standard
NOAC doses by FDA labeling, outcomes stratified by actual
dose received are shown in Table 3. Patients who were
inappropriately dose reduced had numerically higher unad-
justed rates of thromboembolic events (HR 1.56, 95% CI
0.92-2.67), major bleeding events (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.02-
2.18), and mortality (HR 2.61, 95% CI 1.86-3.67). Following
adjustment, there were no significant differences in out-
comes, although HRs consistently trended toward higher
risk in patients inappropriately dose reduced (adjusted HR
for mortality 1.40, 95% CI 0.97-2.00, P=0.07).

were no statistically significant differences in outcomes

Reduced NOAC Doses in AF
Steinberg et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 3, 2019
 Discussion
Our analysis of nearly 8000 AF patients in community practice
is the first to report exclusively on the use of NOAC dose
reductions in US community practice. We found that �1 in 7
patients treated with a NOAC were treated with a reduced
NOAC dose. Notably, more than half of NOAC reductions were
inconsistent with FDA labeling and appeared to be paradox-
ically in patients of lower bleeding risk. In unadjusted
analyses, patients receiving reduced NOAC doses had high
crude adverse event rates, particularly among those who
should have received standard NOAC dosing. Although these
trends were consistent in adjusted analyses, the differences
were not statistically significant.
We have previously reported on the frequency and
outcomes of off-label NOAC dosing in this cohort and found
relatively high rates of overdosing and underdosing, relative to
the doses recommended by the package inserts.9 Those data
also suggested an overall high rate of prescriptions for the
lower doses of these medications, and the present analysis
explores that phenomenon in depth. The only previous studies
of reduced NOAC dosing have been described across 3
centers in Australia and in a single-center report from the
United States.15,16 Both studies suggested a high rate of
inappropriate dosing for patients with AF receiving NOACs but
were limited to fewer than 300 patients and not specifically
designed
to
address
inappropriate
dose
reductions.
A
Medicare analysis of dabigatran use found that among
patients receiving reduced-dose dabigatran, only a minority
carried a diagnosis of significant kidney disease.17 However,
the prescribers did not have detailed data on renal function
and therefore could not determine true expected versus
observed rates of dose reductions.
Our nationwide data among all approved regimens of
NOACs extended the findings of these earlier studies and
found that 16% of patients taking NOACs received a reduced
dose but that only 43% of these patients fulfilled FDA dosing
recommendations for such dosing. Among those patients
inappropriately receiving lower NOAC doses, few objective
patient characteristics appeared to drive the practice. These
patients were not dramatically older, had paradoxically lower
bleeding risk scores, and were not frequently receiving
concomitant antiplatelet therapy. Together these data sug-
gest that a sizable proportion of patients are receiving
reduced-dose NOACs based on other characteristics (includ-
ing prescriber preference) and not based on either FDA-
recommended labeling or classic markers of bleeding risk.
Physician judgment may be a strong influence for reduced
NOAC dosing; however, there may also be drug-specific
factors. For example, dosing guidelines for apixaban are

 dramatically different from those of other agents and include
weight and age as well as serum creatinine (versus creatinine
clearance). In contrast to the single assessment of creatinine
clearance, multiple parameters may represent a barrier to
determining the appropriate dose. For other agents, dosing is
guided primarily by estimated creatinine clearance, as calcu-
lated by the Cockroft-Gault formula; however, electronic
medical records and lab reports routinely report renal function
according to the MDRD (Modification of Diet for Renal
Disease) estimation. Although these methods are similar,
there are well-described differences between them, and they
could lead to inappropriate dosing in some circumstances.
In the largest study of NOAC dosing and outcomes, a
nationwide Danish analysis suggested differential outcomes
among different reduced-dose NOACs compared with war-
farin, but none of the comparisons was statistically signifi-
cant.18 Furthermore, it is not clear from that analysis what
proportion of patients in each drug group qualified for the
reduced dose based on regulatory recommendations—our US
data suggest that more than half of these patients may be
inappropriately underdosed, and this could certainly account
for a difference in clinical outcomes across very large
populations.
In our analysis of outcomes, patients receiving lower doses
of NOACs were observed to have a notably increased risk of
adverse events, including thromboembolic events, bleeding
events, and death. When we accounted for differences in
patient characteristics with adjustment, these increased rates

 were not significant. However, we caution that our analysis
had limited power to detect significant differences. Biologic
plausibility suggests that lower doses could lead to worse
thromboembolic outcomes (including death). The numerically
higher rate of bleeding in these patients is more likely a
marker of underlying risk—prior data from this program would
not support the idea that providers’ assessment of bleeding
risk superseded that of objective bleeding scores (which were
lower in the dose-reduced cohort).19,20 Finally, the random-
ized controlled trials testing these agents for stroke preven-
tion in AF tested the reduced doses in only a minority of
patients, if at all.
Limitations
This analysis is observational, and neither NOAC drug nor dose
was randomized. Although ORBIT-AF II was designed to capture
a broad selection of sites and patients, selection bias cannot
be excluded. Comparisons between these data and the clinical
trial populations, or other cohorts, are limited by differences in
underlying cohorts. Last, the categorization of appropriate
versus inappropriate dosing may be dynamic and influenced by
the intermittent use of interacting medications (eg, antibiotics,
antifungals, antiarrhythmics). However, our sensitivity analysis
suggested that patients with borderline renal dysfunction do
not account for the substantial use of reduced doses.
Conclusions
A significant proportion of AF patients receiving NOACs are
receiving the reduced dose; however, the majority of reduced-
dose NOAC use is not consistent with FDA recommendations.
Moreover, selection of reduced-dose NOAC therapy does not
appear to be associated with bleeding risk. Patients receiving
lower NOAC doses are an at-risk group and have high rates of
adverse events. These data support the need for ongoing
education of clinicians in community practice on the appro-
priate dosing of NOACs for AF and further study of the
outcomes associated with reduced NOAC doses.

Table S1. Dosing Criteria 
The appropriate NOAC dosing is defined as follows, according to which NOAC agent is 
prescribed: 
•
Dabigatran1
o
150 mg twice daily is standard dose.
o
CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min: No dosage adjustment necessary unless patient
receiving concomitant dronedarone, then consider reducing dabigatran to 75
mg twice daily.
o
CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min: 75 mg twice daily unless patient receiving concomitant
dronedarone, then avoid concurrent use.
o
CrCl <15 mL/min or on dialysis: not recommended.
•
Rivaroxaban2
o
20 mg once daily is standard dose.
o
CrCl 15 to 50 mL/min: 15 mg once daily.
o
CrCl <15 mL/min or on dialysis: Avoid use.
•
Apixaban3
o
5 mg twice daily unless patient has any 2 of the following: Age ≥80 years,
body weight ≤60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL, then reduce dose to 2.5
mg twice daily.
o
On dialysis: 5 mg twice daily; reduce to 2.5 mg twice daily if age ≥80 years or
body weight ≤60 kg.
•
Edoxaban4
o
60 mg daily is standard dose, used when 50 < CrCl ≤ 95 mL/min
o
CrCl 15-50: 30 mg daily
o
CrCl >95 mL/min: Contraindicated
o
CrCl <15 mL/min: Contraindicated
