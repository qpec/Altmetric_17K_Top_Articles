Abstract
Background People
with
myalgic
encephalomyelitis/
chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) continue to struggle to
have their condition recognised as disabling in the face of
public and professional prejudice and discrimination.
Objective The aim of this study was to compare the
functional status and well-being of people with well-char-
acterised ME/CFS with people with multiple sclerosis
(PWMS), as well as healthy controls (HCs).
Methods In this cross-sectional study, we used data col-
lected as part of the UK ME/CFS Biobank to compare
actual participant scores from the Medical Outcomes Sur-
vey Short Form-36 v2TM (SF-36v2TM) between groups, as
a proxy for impact of disability, and from a bespoke
questionnaire seeking data on employment and income.
Results People with ME/CFS scored significantly lower
than PWMS or HCs in almost all SF-36v2TM areas.
Prominent were lower scores for people with ME/CFS in
the Physical Component Summary and Role Physical and
Social Function domains, while the smallest differences
were seen in the Mental Health domain. Responses to the
bespoke questionnaire indicated that people with ME/CFS
in this study work fewer hours and have lower incomes
compared with people in the other two groups.
Conclusions Using SF-36v2TM scores as a proxy, people
with ME/CFS were measurably more disabled than PWMS
or HCs in this study population. Furthermore, employment
and income data are consistent with loss of functional
status. These findings should encourage the health com-
munity to recognise the disabling effects of ME/CFS, to
advocate for the needs of people with ME/CFS, and to
investigate strategies to address the cost of the disease to
both individuals and society.
Key Points for Decision Makers
This study suggests that at a group level people with
myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome
(ME/CFS) are more disabled than people affected by
multiple sclerosis (MS), as measured by the SF-
36v2TM.
ME/CFS is associated with a reduction in time spent
at work and lower income, compared with people
affected by MS.
Further efforts should be made to identify and
address the impact of ME/CFS to individuals and
society.

 fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) continue to campaign to have
their
disease
recognised
as
disabling
[2].
However,
research into disability in ME/CFS has been hampered by a
lack of consensus, both around the definition of the disease
and appropriate measurement tools [3, 4].
ME/CFS is a poorly understood disease. Its measured
population prevalence varies between 0.1 and 2.5% [5–8]
according to the definition used, the place and context in
which the definition is used, and user perceptions. There is
currently no validated test available that can distinguish
people with the disease from those without, and, in the
absence of a diagnostic marker [9], definitions continue to
challenge the medical and research communities [10]. The
definitions most widely used by researchers are the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 1994
case definition [11], the Canadian Consensus Criteria
(CCC) [12] and the International Consensus Criteria (ICC)
for ME [13], all of which require the exclusion of other
illnesses, except for certain comorbidities.
In adults, ME/CFS is characterised by unexplained
persistent or recurrent incapacitating fatigue of more than
6 months’ duration accompanied by a range of symptoms
that vary within and between individuals. All definitions
include a restricted ability to maintain the level of occu-
pational, educational, social and personal activities previ-
ously enjoyed [14–16].
The diversity and fluctuating nature of symptoms, the
absence of a diagnostic test and the lack of a universally
accepted definition have combined to make ME/CFS a
disease stigmatised by both the medical community and the
public [17–21]. This has likely contributed to limited uni-
ted efforts by the research community and very restricted
funding from government and other mainstream research
funders compared with other similarly debilitating ill-
nesses, despite its prevalence and impact [22, 23].
There is little research to quantify health-related quality
of life (HRQoL) in people with ME/CFS. Previous research
using the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 v2TM
(SF-36v2TM) published in 2011 [24] indicated that ME/
CFS impacted the status and well-being of people with
well-characterised ME/CFS to a greater extent than 10
other chronic diseases, including cancer. A Danish study
published soon thereafter showed that the HRQoL of
people in the study with ME/CFS was the lowest of all
conditions compared [25], including cancer, diabetes, long-
and short-term mental illness, stroke, osteoarthritis and
rheumatoid arthritis. Both studies relied on general popu-
lation and disease-specific norms for the comparison
groups to show the disabling effects of ME/CFS; a com-
parison with healthy and diseased groups from the same
geographical area from where the cases were provided
would likely be more accurate. Furthermore, participants in
the Danish study self-reported their diagnosis of ME/CFS,
which may have led to selection bias.
In this study, the SF-36v2TM questionnaire was used to
compare functional status and well-being in people with
ME/CFS and two matched comparison groups—people
with MS (PWMS) and healthy controls (HCs).
2 Methods
This cross-sectional study compared SF-36v2TM scores
[26] collected from participants in the recently established
UK ME/CFS Biobank [27]. The Biobank cohort included
people with ME/CFS, PWMS and HCs who had provided
data and samples for future research. The data were col-
lected between December 2013 and February 2015 from a
population resident in the same geographic area. Partici-
pants in the UK ME/CFS Biobank with ME/CFS and MS
needed a medically confirmed diagnosis, and people with
ME/CFS were required to meet the CDC 1994 [11] or
Canadian criteria [12].
PWMS were chosen as a suitable comparison group
because (1) both ME and MS are classified as a neuro-
logical disease in the World Health Organization’s Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-
10; G93.3) [28]; and (2) MS (ICD-10; G35) also presents
with fluctuating chronic fatigue and a number of other
similar symptoms, including orthostatic intolerance and
cognitive impairment [29].
2.1 Recruitment for the UK Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
(ME/CFS) Biobank
Between 2012 and 2015, the UK ME/CFS Biobank col-
lected data and samples from participants in London and
East Anglia; details of the UK ME/CFS Biobank protocol
have been previously published [27]. Participants were
recruited through National Health Service general practices
and specialist services with support from the National
Institute for Health Research (NIHR) clinical and research
networks. Staff from the local NIHR Clinical Research
Network (formerly the Primary Care Research Network)
approached general practices in Norfolk and Suffolk to
seek willingness to recruit participants. Once local ethical
approval was in place, participating practices sent letters to
registered patients with a diagnosis of ME/CFS, people
with a diagnosis of MS, and potential HCs, inviting them to
participate in the study. Three HCs were invited for each
person with ME/CFS to be recruited. A higher response
and recruitment rate was anticipated from people with the
disease because people with ME/CFS are underrepresented
in
research
studies
and
are
therefore
motivated
to
382
C. C.Kingdon et al.
 participate [34]. At the same time, specialty clinics in
London, Norfolk and Suffolk approached their patients
with ME/CFS and MS. Posters seeking HC volunteers were
placed in general practice surgeries and institutes of higher
education in the same regions. A full description of
recruitment procedures can be found in the paper describ-
ing the establishment of the UK ME/CFS Biobank [27].
All participants conformed to the inclusion/exclusion
criteria described in Table 1. The study protocol was
identical for all participants, regardless of category of
recruitment, although questions related to MS and ME/CFS
were omitted for HCs.
A clinical researcher assessed all potential Biobank
participants at the recruitment stage using a bespoke
‘Symptoms Assessment’ form to confirm eligibility to
participate in the study. All participants donated blood
(some of which was used for clinical tests to exclude
alternative diagnoses), completed a clinical assessment,
and filled out study questionnaires, including the SF-
36v2TM and the ‘Participant Questionnaire’. Together,
these tools enabled the characterisation of participants with
ME/CFS and MS according to clinical phenotype and
disease severity.
2.2 Sample Size for the Proposed Analysis
A subsample of 156 individuals (52 with ME/CFS, 52 with
MS, and 52 HCs) was drawn from the Biobank cohort. The
participants with ME/CFS were randomly drawn from the
list of recruited participants and matched by sex and age
group with individuals from the control groups. This
sample size was considered sufficient to detect differences
in SF-36v2TM mean/median scores C 5 between people
with ME/CFS and each of the two comparison subgroups,
with a power of 90% and at a significance level of 0.05
using norm-based scores. We used a conservative 5-point
difference in norm-based scores as the minimally important
difference (MID), even though the recommended MID
varies among the summary measures and each specific
domain. For example, an MID of 2–3 points is considered
reasonable for the Physical Component Summary (PCS)
domain [26], based on clinical trials with patients with
peripheral arterial disease. Using a similar approach in
different trials, Ware et al. suggested different MIDs for the
SF-36v2TM scales, ranging from 3.1 to 5.7, the higher MID
being recommended for the General Health (GH) domain
(5.7), Vitality (VT) domain (5.5) and the Mental Health
(MH) domain (5.5). The MIDs recommended for the
summary measures were 3.1 (PCS) and 3.8 (Mental
Component Summary; MCS) [26].
2.3 Data Collection
The SF-36v2TM is a health survey that uses 36 questions to
collect information about functional status and well-being
from respondents. These questions evolved from medical
outcome studies carried out in the 1980s and 1990s, and
were developed with psychometric rigour to ensure that the
information captured was reliable [26]. The answers to
these unambiguous questions form eight different scales,
known as domains. Reports from studies using this
instrument evidenced an increase in reliability and validity
of scores in a diverse range of populations and settings
when compared with other outcome measure instruments

Functional Status and Well-Being in People with ME/CFS
383
 [30]. The SF-36v2TM is recognised as a reliable tool that
uses generic health measures that are not age-, disease- or
treatment-specific; it has been used and validated across
different populations [31]. The version used employs lan-
guage familiar to people living in the UK [32]. A full report
on the development of this research instrument, and a
detailed description of its ability to access functional status
and well-being, has been published elsewhere [26].
The SF-36v2TM considers physical and mental functions
resulting in eight distinct domains, which are summarised
into the PCS and the MCS [26]. The PCS comprises four
domains and is used to profile functional health: Physical
Function (PF) measures the ability to undertake everyday
activities; Role Physical (RP) measures limitations in the
ability to work; Bodily Pain (BP) measures the impact of
pain on activity; and GH looks at the general health per-
ceptions of the respondent. Low scores in the PCS indicate
reduced functional status.
The four domains making up the MCS are measures of
VT, with questions about energy and tiredness; Social
Function (SF); MH, which asks about psychological well-
being, anxiety and depression; and Role Emotional (RE),
which considers role limitations due to emotional prob-
lems. Since the VT domain is included in the MCS, the
physical symptoms of ME/CFS and MS, especially fatigue,
are likely to reduce that score, which should be borne in
mind when interpreting results.
In this study, the SF-36v2TM instrument was used to
compare disability (measuring functional status and well-
being) and served to assess HRQoL. In addition to the SF-
36v2TM questionnaire, all Biobank participants also com-
pleted the Participant Questionnaire, which was developed
by the UK ME/CFS Biobank team to capture information
on socioeconomic, demographic, clinical and family his-
tory, and which was piloted prior to its use. Most of its
questions about symptoms were taken from validated
questionnaires [27, 33–35]. Examples of the questions on
employment and income used in the Participant Ques-
tionnaire can be seen in Online Appendix 1.
The time lag between disease onset and the response to
the questionnaires varied between participants. For the
analyses carried out for this study, we used the resultant
demographic (sex and age), clinical (functional status and
well-being), and socioeconomic (education, accommoda-
tion, employment, and income) data. Income data refers to
income at the time of recruitment and, when relevant, to
6 months before the disease showed symptoms.
2.4 Data Analysis
Answers to the SF-36v2TM questions were scored in
health domains grouped into the PCS and the MCS using
the SF Health OutcomesTM Scoring Software 4.5 [36].
Although actual scores for individual questions may vary
within
the
general
population,
these
average
scores
become 50 out of a possible 100 across all questions
when they are norm-based with an SD (r) of 10 [26].
Therefore, norm-based scores compare results with others
who have completed the SF-36v2TM rather than against
fixed criteria.
Data were analysed using Stata 14.0 software [37].
Bivariate analyses were used to compare people with ME
against PWMS or HCs using the Chi-square test and Chi-
square for trend to assess the association between cate-
gorical variables; the t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were
used for continuous variables.
In addition to using the SF-36v2TM scores, we also
looked at the effect of ME/CFS on some socioeconomic
variables, which could also impact HRQoL. For these
analyses, we used the variables ‘current income’, ‘em-
ployment’, ‘hours of work’ and ‘benefits’, using condi-
tional logistic regression as recommended for paired design
[38].
3 Results
3.1 Description of the Study Population
The study population came from South East England, was
predominantly female (73%), of working age (mean age
was 49.4 years), and most had completed higher education.
Social demographic characteristics are shown in Table 2.
The SF-36v2TM responses were analysed from the sub-
sample of participants matched by age and sex, i.e. 52
people with ME/CFS (as per study), 52 PWMS, and 52
HCs, and most participants came from greater London or
East Anglia. Of the 52 participants with ME/CFS, 75% had
mild–moderate symptoms and 25% had severe symptoms,
reflecting an intentional recruitment ratio. Of those with
MS who responded to the question (n = 42), 71% had
remitting-relapsing MS and 29% had primary- or sec-
ondary-progressive MS.
3.2 SF-36v2TM Comparison Scores
The SF-36v2TM median scores, compared by groups, are
shown in Fig. 1, which presents median scores for indi-
vidual scales as well as the PCS and MCS. This figure is a
spider chart, where axes radiate outwards from a central
point (0), with each axis representing an SF-36v2TM scale
or component summary. The median scores found for the
scales and component summaries in each group were
plotted on the axes in the spider chart. By joining the points
on the axes by group, the resulting polygons clearly dis-
played the differences in scores from people with ME/CFS
384
C. C.Kingdon et al.
 (smaller polygon reflects lower scores), PWMS and HCs
(higher scores); apart from RE, these differences were all
statistically significant. Median SF-36v2TM scores from
people with ME/CFS were consistently below those for
both HCs (p\0.001 for all domains and summary mea-
sures) and PWMS (p\0.03 for MH scores, and p\0.001
for the remaining domains, except for RE, which was
0.12). SF scores, at 27 and 57 for people with ME/CFS and
HCs,
respectively,
showed
the
largest
difference
(p\0.001).
3.3 Socioeconomic Impact
3.3.1 Work and Study Hours
Six months before illness onset, the profiles of hours of
study and work (including unpaid and voluntary work, and
looking after the home) for people with ME/CFS and
PWMS were similar, suggesting that prior to disease onset
people in both disease groups were equally active in work
and study. Moreover, the pre-illness profiles were similar to
those of the HCs.
At recruitment (Fig. 2), 74% of people with ME/CFS
were working and/or studying for 16 or fewer hours/week
compared with 26% of PWMS and 12% of HCs. Com-
paring people with ME/CFS pre- and post disease onset, we
found that the number of those spending fewer than 17 h
per week at work or study increased more than fourfold
(from 17.6% to 76.4%). In this study population, almost
60% of HCs reported working and/or studying more than
40 h/week, compared with 10% of people with ME/CFS
(p\0.05).
3.3.2 Employment
Disease onset had a greater impact on employment among
people with ME/CFS than among PWMS (Fig. 3), in both
working status and number of hours worked. While over
89% (n = 45) of people with ME/CFS had been employed
before disease onset, this reduced to 35% (n = 18) after
illness onset, which compares with 93% of PWMS before
(n = 48) and 60% of PWMS (n = 52) after disease onset.
Only 13% of people with ME/CFS and 37% of PWMS
worked full time at the time of recruitment, with 52% of
people with ME/CFS and 27% of PWMS self-identifying
as ‘sick or disabled’, although the differences between the
groups did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07).
3.3.3 Income
The income of people with ME/CFS and PWMS prior to
disease onset followed a normal distribution and there was
no
statistical
difference
between
the
two
categories
(p = 0.63). Free-text data showed that all people with ME/
CFS and PWMS who had not been receiving any income
were in full-time education.
The annual income of people with ME/CFS after disease
onset was lower than it had been 6 months before disease

 onset (Fig. 4). The percentage of people with ME/CFS
earning more than £30,000 more than halved following
disease onset.
Post disease onset, 83% of people with ME/CFS earned
below £20,000, compared with 59% of PWMS and 54% of
HCs (Fig. 5), although these differences were not statisti-
cally significant (p = 0.24). Some participants did not
provide information on income (8% of people with ME/
CFS and 12% of PWMS).
Despite the degenerative component that is often part of
the natural history of MS, changes in income for PWMS
were smaller, at 7.6%, following illness onset. In contrast,
the number of people with ME/CFS who earned below
£10,000 increased by 82%.
3.4 Conditional Logistic Regression Bivariate
Analysis
The bivariate conditional logistic regression analysis
results are shown in Table 3, with matching accounting for
the potential effect of age group and sex. The odds of
people with ME/CFS reporting being unemployed or
working part-time were 13.5-fold those of HCs (p\0.001)
and 3.4-fold those of PWMS (p = 0.016). These findings

 are consistent with the working hours/week from people
with ME in relation to HCs and PWMS [odds ratio (OR)
17, p = 0.000; OR 4.6, p = 0.002, respectively]. Addi-
tionally, we found odds of 8.5 for an annual income lower
than £19,999 for people with ME/CFS when compared
with HCs (p = 0.004), and 3.0 when compared with
PWMS (p = 0.033). Furthermore, the odds of people with
ME being on benefits was 3.8 of the HCs (p = 0.008) and
2.4 those of PWMS (0.048).
4 Discussion
Analysis of SF-36v2TM data from this study suggests that
in almost all areas measured, people with ME/CFS expe-
rience greater impact of their disease on life functioning
than PWMS. Lower scores in the PCS, RP and SF domains
for people with ME/CFS were consistent, corroborating the
requirement for a 50% reduction in activity stipulated in
the 2011 ICC [13]. Markedly lower were the PF and SF
scores, in line with findings from the National Outcomes

 Database in 2010 [39] and supporting the earlier work of
Nacul et al. [24].
The study showed statistically significant differences in
the number of work and study hours that people with ME/
CFS were able to undertake compared with PWMS and
HCs. There were also statistically significant differences in
income received by people with ME/CFS, PWMS and
HCs. People with ME/CFS were more likely to be unem-
ployed or only able to work part-time than participants in
the other two groups. There were noticeable decreases in
income in both disease groups, however this was more
pronounced in people with ME/CFS.
Study participants with ME/CFS or MS were asked
about their income 6 months prior to disease onset and at
the time of questionnaire completion; the time between
these dates could be as short as 6 months, or as long as
many years, depending on disease duration. Such reduc-
tions in income actually underestimate actual losses since
inflation was not taken into account.
The above associations merit further exploration using
longitudinal studies.
4.1 ME/CFS and the Role of Public Health
This study provides evidence of the disabling effects of
ME/CFS, which negatively impact the HRQoL of people
with the disease. Demonstrating that people with ME/CFS
can be similarly, or, as suggested in this cohort, more
disabled than PWMS, helps to validate ME/CFS as a
debilitating illness. Such evidence could energise the
public health community to coalesce with health services
and various stakeholders to act on behalf of people with
ME/CFS by informing policy and aiding advocacy. In turn,
this could represent a further argument for increased
funding for ME/CFS research and improvements in the
planning of care and provision of rehabilitation services for
people with ME/CFS. It could also advance the improved
education of healthcare workers, many of whom are prej-
udiced towards ME/CFS and still do not recognise the
disease [40].
4.2 People with ME/CFS: Access to Employment
These study findings suggest that people with ME/CFS are
less able to continue employment after disease onset than
PWMS, which may reflect the poorer physical functioning
of people with ME/CFS and a lack of appropriate and
effective treatments, and which could result from having a
disease that is underrecognised and undersupported by
employers [41]. Some people with ME/CFS who are able
to continue working do so by sacrificing all or much of the
social life they would otherwise enjoy [42]. Employers
have been shown to be less accommodating to people
without a visible disease or infirmity, such as occurs with
back pain or depression [43, 44], and their behaviours
towards people with ME/CFS are not always positive [41],
despite the requirements of the UK Equality Act 2010 [45].
Public health authorities could play a major role in raising
awareness of ME/CFS and educating employers around
workplace support and modifications. Simple measures
such as facilitating rest periods and adjusting light and
sound exposure have been shown to be effective [46].
4.3 The Impact of ME/CFS on Income
These data demonstrate that in this sample, the income of
people with ME/CFS decreased markedly following dis-
ease onset and was significantly lower than that of HCs. In
this study, raw figures were used, unadjusted for inflation.
If inflation were factored into these figures, the decrease in
income would be even greater. In the conditional regres-
sion analysis, the dependent variables were likely to be

Functional Status and Well-Being in People with ME/CFS

 interacting with each other; a multivariate model analysis
would require a larger sample size to account for potential
interaction. Repeating these analyses in a larger sample is
recommended to further examine the associations between
functional status of people with ME and income. These
findings suggest that future analyses on HRQoL, using
multivariate models for functional and socioeconomic
variables, are worth pursuing.
Loss of employment for people with ME/CFS not only
affects the self-worth and economic status of the individ-
ual, greatly impacting wellbeing and HRQoL, but also adds
to the economic burden on government [47]. Findings from
this study are in line with 2012 data from specialist service
centres [39], which indicated that slightly more than half of
2000 people with ME/CFS had discontinued employment
due to their symptoms. This also aligns with the more than
50% unemployment found in a systematic literature review
of 37 studies in 2004 [9]. Loss of productivity within the
UK group was estimated then at over £22,000 per patient
per annum [39]. A recent report estimated the total cost to
the UK economy at a minimum of £3.3 billion anually [48].
Similar studies in the US have estimated that lost produc-
tivity for people with ME/CFS could be from $9 billion to
$37 billion per annum [49]. While investment may be
essential
to
support
employment
opportunities,
the
decreased need for benefits and increased tax revenue from
an employed population may help to address such costs
[50], and robust economic analysis should inform public
health thinking.
4.4 Study Limitations
It is difficult to generalise these results. Data were collected
from mainly White participants in South East England,
therefore the results may not be applicable to minority
populations, although there is no obvious indication that
results would differ significantly in other population
groups.
All HC SF-36v2TM scores were [50, i.e. above a gen-
eral population average, which might be due to selection
bias because of the nature of recruitment [51]. People with
major illnesses were excluded and HCs agreeing to par-
ticipate in a study of this kind are likely to be healthier than
the average person.
All data were self-reported and some were retrospective,
and therefore could have been subject to reporting and
recall bias, particularly data on employment and income.
A multivariate analysis to account for potential con-
founding was not possible due to the likely degree of
interaction between the outcome variables and potential
confounding variables. Analysis with a larger sample size
is planned for the future as the UK ME/CFS Biobank
expands.
ME/CFS and MS can fluctuate in severity both day-to-
day and over longer periods. Since symptoms can be quite
disabling, participants with ME/CFS in particular were
only able to participate during a time in which they were
feeling able to do so, and many appointments had to be
rescheduled. This presents a challenge for a cross-sectional
analysis such as this since the answers provided may not be
fully representative of the experience of participants with
ME/CFS on a typical day insofar as the results may
underrepresent the impact and/or severity of ME/CFS
symptoms.
5 Conclusions
This study provides evidence for the reality of disability for
many people with ME/CFS and the disease’s effect on
HRQoL and wellbeing. In this study population, the loss of
functional status, as a proxy for disability, was greater in
people with ME/CFS than PWMS. The disease conspicu-
ously reduced SF in people with ME/CFS, and HRQoL
may have been impacted by the subsequent social isolation
[52]. More people with ME/CFS than PWMS lost their jobs
after becoming ill, and the income of people with ME/CFS
decreased markedly more than for PWMS. Unemployment
costs are borne by both the individual and society. The
prevalence of ME/CFS, the evident reduction in HRQoL of
those affected, and the economic cost of the illness to
society should be powerful motivators for policy makers to
encourage better funding of research to discover the cause
of, and establish effective treatments for, this disease [53].
Validating these findings will require further research
with a larger sample size and in other population-based
samples.
