 A healthy gastrointestinal microbiome is
dependent on dietary diversity
Mark L. Heiman 1,*, Frank L. Greenway 2
ABSTRACT
Background: Like all healthy ecosystems, richness of microbiota species characterizes the GI microbiome in healthy individuals. Conversely, a
loss in species diversity is a common finding in several disease states. This biome is flooded with energy in the form of undigested and partially
digested foods, and in some cases drugs and dietary supplements. Each microbiotic species in the biome transforms that energy into new
molecules, which may signal messages to physiological systems of the host.
Scope of review: Dietary choices select substrates for species, providing a competitive advantage over other GI microbiota. The more diverse
the diet, the more diverse the microbiome and the more adaptable it will be to perturbations. Unfortunately, dietary diversity has been lost during
the past 50 years and dietary choices that exclude food products from animals or plants will narrow the GI microbiome further.
Major conclusion: Additional research into expanding gut microbial richness by dietary diversity is likely to expand concepts in healthy nutrition,
stimulate discovery of new diagnostics, and open up novel therapeutic possibilities.

Twenty-five years ago, Epstein et al. described treating a group of 25
children between the ages of 6e12 years of age who were 45%
overweight in conjunction with one of their parents who was also
overweight. The treatment period lasted for 8 months and consisted of
diet instruction, behavioral management training, exercise and con-
tingency contracting in which money was deposited and $5 returned at
visits if weight had been lost. The parents and children both lost weight
during the treatment period, but ten years after the treatment the
children were still maintaining a 7.5% reduction in their percent
overweight below baseline. In contrast, the parent that was treated at
the same time with the child increased their percent overweight from
baseline by 9.1% [1]. The reason for the ability of pre-pubertal subjects
to maintain weight loss but not their parents who were treated with
them in the same program remains a medical mystery.
That study was performed before there was an appreciation of the
interactions between the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome and physi-
ological systems regulating metabolism. At the end of 2007, the US
National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Human Microbiome
Project (HMP) and, in early 2008, the European Commission and China
initiated the Metagenomics project of the Human Intestinal Tract
(MetaHIT). These large efforts apply advanced sequencing and bio-
informatic tools to characterize the microbes living in and on our
bodies. Each community of microbiota is studied as an ecosystem,
utilizing the science and language of ecology [2]. Biodiversity is a
critical aspect of ecosystem function and has been the intense focus of
the HMP and MetaHIT projects [3,4]. Like all healthy ecosystems, some
level of species richness characterizes the GI microbiome in healthy
individuals [5]. Additions or losses of species with similar roles tend to
only have small effects on microbiome function. However, domination
by few species or lack of species diversity may impact function
significantly.
The pre-adolescent children that were capable of maintaining weight
loss may have a much greater level of species richness than their
parent. Indeed, biodiversity of the GI microbiome of healthy pre-
adolescent children aged 6e12 years of age is much greater than
that of healthy adults living in the same city [6]. A greater the biodi-
versity renders a greater resilience of the ecosystem to recover from or
adjust to perturbations. Conversely, a loss in species richness in the GI
microbiome is a common finding in several disease states.
During the past 50 years, prevalence of obesity [7], type 2 diabetes [8],
and inflammatory bowel diseases [9] sharply increased. A shared
discovery for each of these pathologies is a reduction of the GI
microbiome biodiversity [10,11,12; respectively]. This biome is flooded
with energy in the form of undigested and partially digested foods, and
in some cases drugs and dietary supplements. Each microbiotic spe-
cies in the biome transforms that energy into new molecules, which

 may signal messages about energy intake and the state of digestion to
physiological systems of the host. Thus, by our dietary choices, we are
selecting substrates for some species and providing a competitive
advantage over other GI microbiota. The more diverse the diet, the more
diverse the microbiome and the more adaptable it will be to pertur-
bations. Pre-adolescent children may have a more diverse GI micro-
biome than their parents because the diet is transitioning from the
simple infant liquid diet to the foods of an adult, testing and selecting
new foods along the way. By adulthood, habitual diets have been
established based on lifestyle, palate and unwillingness to explore new
foods. Adults, therefore, adopt a personalized GI microbiome [13,14]
making comparisons of GI microbiotal communities difficult unless
one contrasts populations from different cultures [15]. Regardless,
richness of the GI microbiome is well correlated with health [5].
Unfortunately, dietary diversity has been lost during the past 50 years
because of economic pressures for greater food production to support
a growing world population. This decreased agrobiodiversity, or the
decline in rearing varied edible plant varieties and animal breeds, is
occurring at an incredible rate. According to the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations [16], 75 percent of plant genetic
diversity has been lost, as farmers worldwide have left their multiple
local varieties for genetically uniform, high-yielding varieties. Of the
250,000 to 300,000 known edible plant species, humans use only 150
to 200. Six livestock breeds are lost each month in favor of high
production practices. Today, 75 percent of the world’s food is
generated from only 12 plants and five animal species.
Agricultural practices of using antibiotics as growth promoters for
poultry, swine and cattle further narrow the GI microbiome. The FDA
approves use of antibiotics for growth of livestock because such low
levels in the carcass do not produce significant blood levels in humans
after ingestion. However, the GI microbiome is exposed to the antibi-
otics, which was not appreciated when the drugs were approved as
growth promoters. Indeed, such exposure may produce substantial
taxonomic and functional changes in the GI microbiome [17]. Crop
agricultural practices rely on use of pesticides to protect the plants
from damaging influences such as weeds, fungi, and insects. Like use
of antibiotics as growth promoters, residual pesticide in food crops
may be sufficient to modulate the GI microbiome when consumed. This
practice could also handicap the plant’s own defense system by
eliminating the need for the plant to produce phytoalexins [18]. Phy-
toalexins may provide key micronutrients that expand the GI micro-
biome
when
ingested
[19].
Thus,
economic
pressures
force
agricultural practices that have limited the richness of the GI micro-
biome over the past century.
Diet will facilitate taxonomic shifts in as little as 3 days after dietary
modification [20,21]. Dietary choices that exclude products from ani-
mals or from plants will eliminate crucial microbiota by purging the
principal nutrients needed to supply the necessary energy for survival
in their habitat. Although temporarily excluding an essential nutrient
will only briefly reduce diversity, such losses of microbiota cannot be
reversed after prolonged elimination of nutrients such as fermentable
fiber [22]. It follows that fad diets also reduce microbiota richness if the
dietary plan strategizes to eliminate one or more dietary macronutri-
ents such as carbohydrates. Although, the first line of treatment for
diabetes includes reduction of sugar and starch intake, those carbo-
hydrates could be replaced by indigestible carbohydrates like oligo-
saccharides which the microbiota could still metabolize. Diets that
advocate intermittent fasting may inadvertently establish occasional
harvesting of the intestinal mucosal barrier by microbiota species that
are capable of foraging on mucin glycans for fuel [23,24]. Even the use
of dietary emulsifiers, which are commonly used in the manufacture of
prepared foods, reduce microbial richness, and may contribute to
colitis and metabolic syndrome [25].
Because energy of micro- and macro-nutrients can be converted by
inhabitants of the GI microbiome into novel molecules that interact with
the host, the greater the repertoire of signals, the more likely is the
ability to maintain homeostasis when dietary intake is perturbed. This
is illustrated well by Wang et al. [26,27]. Phosphatidylcholine, rich in
foods such as shellfish, eggs, milk, red meat and poultry, are con-
verted by intestinal microbes to trimethylamine (TMA), which is effi-
ciently absorbed by the host and oxidized to the atherosclerotic
associated trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) [26]. However, including
dietary foods common to Mediterranean diets such as balsamic vin-
egar, red wine, cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil or grapeseed oil
contains an inhibitor of TMA production [27].
After excessive consumption of sugars and starches, the facilitated
transporters (GLUTs) and the active transporter gene family (SGLTs)
responsible for sugar absorption in the upper gut become saturated
[28], and as a result, carbohydrates are presented to the lower gut
where they are converted to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which
are produced in mole quantities by GI microbiota [29]. These SCFA’s
serve as secretagogues for release of PYY and GLP-I [30], which in
turn, act to reduce further food intake, slow gastric emptying and GI
transit, and increase insulin secretion. These actions limit further
food ingestion and allow ingested glucose to enter cells for storage.
In addition, SCFAs compete with medium chain fatty acids (MCFA)
for binding the enzyme ghrelin O-acyltransferase and thereby block
activation of ghrelin by MCFA [31,32]. Active ghrelin stimulates
appetite [33]. Fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols
(sugar alcohols) (FODMAPs) may trigger GI symptoms in patients
with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease.
Therefore, a low FODMAP diet is often prescribed as part of the
therapy for these patients. While it may help with postprandial
symptoms, such a diet may have long lasting consequences by
eliminating the signaling described with possible long-term shifts in
the GI microbiome [22].
Stable, diverse and healthy GI microbial ecosystems are an important
component to consider when using diet to perturb physiological
systems in animal models of disease, and it is an aspect often
overlooked. A common model to study obesity and insulin resistance is
one in which the diet is switched from a basic chow diet to a
“Western” or “high fat” diet with a predominance of fat and sugar.
Conclusions are typically based on the shift to the calorie dense diet.
However, chow diets are classically more diverse. They contain
macronutrients from many sources such as whole wheat, dehulled
soybean meal, ground corn, animal fat and condensed whey (for
example, Purina 5015 Mouse Diet). A common diet used to induce
obesity in a mouse is much less diverse such as Research Diets
D12492 that contains casein as the source of protein, cornstarch and
sucrose as the carbohydrate, and lard as the fat source. The loss of
dietary biodiversity may be an important component for the devel-
opment of obesity that is associated with a narrowing of GI micro-
biome diversity [34].
Assuming study diets are similar, based only on macronutrient con-
stituents, may hinder comparison of studies with diets made from
components of differing diversity within the macronutrient composi-
tion. As stated above, SCFA production by microbiota could inhibit
activation of ghrelin. Thus, diets rich in plant polysaccharides could
blunt ghrelin actions [35] while a more diverse diet may be less
inhibitory. Zhao and colleagues [36] demonstrated that ghrelin plays an
important role as a counter regulatory hormone to prevent hypogly-
cemia during calorie restriction, an action observed in wild type mice

 but not in mice incapable of activating ghrelin. Yi and colleagues [37]
were unable to validate those findings using 4 different mouse mutants
with loss of ghrelin function. The 2 groups used different diets,
although seemingly similar when based on macronutrient content. The
diet used by Zhao et al. (Teklad diet 7002) contained 18% calories
from fat, 33% calories from protein and 49% calories from carbohy-
drates. Yi et al. used the Teklad LM-485 diet containing 17% calories
from fat, 25% calories from protein and 58% calories from carbohy-
drates. But a closer look at the diversity of dietary components reveals
that the LM-485 diet is a vegetarian diet comprised primarily of ground
corn, dehulled soybean meal, ground oats, wheat middlings, dehy-
drated alfalfa meal, soybean oil and corn gluten meal. The 7002 diet is
more diverse containing animal products and less fermentable car-
bohydrate (ground corn, porcine meat and bone meal, dehulled soy-
bean meal, wheat middlings, ground wheat, ground oats, dehydrated
alfalfa meal, brewers dried yeast, cane molasses, porcine fat, dried
whey and casein). Thus, it is possible that LM-485 diet drives a mi-
crobial community supporting higher levels of SCFAs than does the
7002 diet and wild type mice consuming LM-485 would have lower
levels of circulating ghrelin than wild type mice consuming 7002.
Clues to solve another medical mystery are derived from secondary
bile acids that are a result of GI microbiota processing. Bariatric pro-
cedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve
gastrectomy (VSG) are associated with considerable improvements in
co-morbidities of obesity rapidly after the procedure and prior to sig-
nificant weight loss. Outcomes from RYGB [38] and VSG [39] appear to
be related to bile acid signaling through the farnesoid X receptor (FXR)
e to regulate physiological systems and also to increase gut perme-
ability by reducing the mucosal barrier. It is now clear that bile acid
diversity is dependent on the gut microbial diversity [40,41]. Expanding
dietary fat diversity (for example, saturated-, monosaturated and
polyunsaturated fatty acids) can shift microbiome diversity [42] and
thus regulate the bile acid diversity.
Additional research into expanding gut microbial richness by dietary
diversity is likely to expand concepts in healthy nutrition, stimulate
discovery of new diagnostics, and open up novel therapeutic possi-
bilities. In the future, an adult seeking treatment for obesity may be
surveyed about dietary preferences and present a stool specimen.
Weight loss therapy may begin with a specific dietary plan to widen
that person’s GI microbiome richness as a prelude to obesity treat-
ments to maintain a weight loss over a long period, as is the case for
preadolescent children with obesity and obesity surgery. Indeed, short-
term personalized dietary interventions based on a personalized GI
microbiome, can improve postprandial glucose regulation in pre-
diabetics and T2D [14]. Already a GI microbiome modulator (GIMM) has
been developed and tested to treat prediabetes [43], which opens new
avenues for drug discovery.
