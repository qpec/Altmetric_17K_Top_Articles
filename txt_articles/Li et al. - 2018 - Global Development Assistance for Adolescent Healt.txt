Abstract
IMPORTANCE Growth in financing has underpinned progress in most areas of health. Adolescent
health has recently become a global priority, with inclusion in the Global Strategy for Women’
s,
Children’
s and Adolescents’Health, but little is known about patterns of financing and development
assistance for adolescent health (DAAH).
OBJECTIVE To provide estimates of DAAH at global, regional, and country levels.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this quality improvement study, data from the Creditor
Reporting System were used to estimate flows of total DAAH and per-adolescent DAAH and to assess
its distribution by donors, regions, and countries and the leading causes of burden of disease (ie,
disability-adjusted life-years) in 132 developing countries between January 1, 2003, and December
31, 2015. Through use of a key word search and various funding allocation methods, 2 sets of
estimates were produced: adolescent-targeted DAAH that included disbursements to projects with
a primary adolescent health target and adolescent-inclusive DAAH that included disbursements to
projects with either a primary or partial adolescent health target, as well as projects that could
benefit adolescent health but did not include age-related key words.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimates of DAAH distinguishing between adolescent-
targeted and adolescent-inclusive DAAH.
RESULTS There were 19 921 projects in 132 countries in the adolescent-targeted estimation
between 2003 and 2015, with a total funding amount of $3634.6 million, accounting for 1.6% of total
development assistance for health. The top 5 donors (Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria, $806.8 million; United Nations Population Fund, $401.3 million; United States, $389.9
million; United Kingdom, $251.8 million; and International Development Association, $218.6 million)
together provided 56.9% of all adolescent-targeted DAAH. Sub-Saharan Africa received the largest
cumulative DAAH per adolescent ($5.37) during the period. In 2015, among the 10 leading causes of
disability-adjusted life-years, HIV and AIDS received the largest DAAH, followed by interpersonal
violence, tuberculosis, and diarrheal diseases. Other leading causes, including road injuries and
depressive disorders, received few disbursements, especially among the low-income countries.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite an increasing rate, DAAH composed a small proportion
of total development assistance for health, suggesting that adolescent health has gained little donor
attention. Moreover, recent allocations of DAAH have not aligned well with either the burden of
disease or the areas where the benefits of investment are likely to be high.

Key Points
Questions What have been the trends
in worldwide development assistance
for adolescent health between 2003
and 2015, and how well has it aligned
with disease burden?
Findings This quality improvement
study found that development
assistance for adolescent health in 132
countries cumulatively accounted for
only 1.6% of development health
assistance. The largest amount of
development assistance for adolescent
health went to HIV and AIDS, while
other leading causes of disease burden
among adolescents, including anemia,
road injuries, and depressive disorders,
have been largely overlooked by donors.
Meaning Taking adolescent health to
scale in the Global Strategy for Women’
s,
Children’
s and Adolescents’Health will
require greater allocation of
development funds and better targeting
toward major causes of disease burden.

 Introduction
Adolescence is a phase of rapid physical, cognitive, and emotional growth, in which future patterns
of adult health are established.1,2 Today, 1.8 billion 10- to 24-year-olds, one-fourth of the world’
s
population, are central to major agendas in global health and international development, including
noncommunicable diseases, injury, infectious diseases (including HIV), and mental health. Given that
adolescents are the next generation to become parents, they are increasingly seen as central to the
early life development of the next generation.1-5
Policy and research interest in adolescent health has been comparatively recent.6 However, the
growing recognition of the significance of growth health and development during adolescence has
now been recognized with the inclusion of adolescents in the Every Woman Every Child agenda
through the Global Strategy for Women’
s, Children’
s and Adolescents’Health.7 Development
assistance for health (DAH) plays a major role in financing health care in developing countries where
service systems and human capacity is generally limited.8-15
We assessed development assistance for adolescent health (DAAH) with adolescent-targeted
and adolescent-inclusive estimates for 132 developing countries between 2003 and 2015. We
provide an analysis of total DAAH and per-adolescent DAAH flows by donors, recipient regions, and
countries, as well as the leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in adolescents.
Methods
Data Sources
The aid data used in this study were extracted in July 2017 from the publicly accessible Creditor
Reporting System (CRS) database for January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2015. Following the CRS
recommendation, we did not use the disbursements data before 2003 owing to the large proportion
of missing data.16 The CRS provides detailed aid activities, at the project level, reported directly by
the following 4 types of donors: 30 members of the Development Assistance Committee, 32
multilateral organizations (eg, United Nations and World Bank), 20 non–Development Assistance
Committee countries (eg, United Arab Emirates), and 1 private donor (Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation).16 The donors included in the CRS report are listed in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Our
DAH estimate in 2015, derived from the CRS, is about 66% of the DAH estimate produced by
Dieleman et al,12 which used data from 35 sources, including the CRS. The DAH derived from the CRS
is presented in eTable 16 in the Supplement. This study used publicly accessible and secondary aid
data at the aggregate level and therefore qualified for exemption of institutional review board
approval from Harvard University. This study followed the Standards for Quality Improvement
Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) reporting guideline.
The projects are implemented in 147 low-income countries (LICs) and middle-income countries.
All disbursement data were converted to constant 2015 US dollars with the donor-specific
development assistance committee deflators.17 We excluded 15 recipient countries that either are
high-income countries or do not have available data on adolescent populations because we cannot
calculate DAAH per adolescent for these countries. We finally kept 132 countries in the analysis
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Annual data on the adolescent population were derived from data
provided by the United Nations Population Division.18 Because the United Nations Population
Division data by age group are reported every 5 years, we imputed the years between, assuming that
the population was growing at the same rate each year.
Defining and Identifying Projects for Adolescent Health
Adolescence is defined by the World Health Organization as the ages between 10 and 19 years.19 We
extended this definition to all youths aged 10 to 24 years because our data examination shows that
many aid projects (6132 of 19 921 [30.8%]) specify that they target populations between the ages 15
and 24 years, which cover those aged 15 to 19 years. The definition of adolescents as those aged 10

 to 24 years has also been adopted in previous studies on adolescent health; this wider age group has
sometimes been referred to as young people.1
The CRS data have no variable indicating projects targeting adolescent health. To identify
relevant projects, we followed previous practices8,9,11,20 and identified DAAH projects with the
combination of 2 strategies. The first strategy identified projects using a key word search.11,21 We
generated key words for the related age groups (eg, “
adolescent,”“teen,”“youth,”“
aged 10-14”
[eTable 3 in the Supplement]) and conducted key word searches on 3 variables in the CRS that
provide descriptions of a project’
s main objectives and targets: project title and short and long
description of a project. The key word search was performed in the sectors listed in Table 1 (eg,
health, education, government and civil society, and humanitarian aid).22 This strategy allowed us to
obtain the projects that either exclusively or partially target adolescent health or well-being, as stated
in their project descriptions.
The second strategy took into account the fact that projects that do not have age-related key
words in their description, such as those for health system strengthening, could also benefit
adolescents. To allocate part of the funds of these projects to adolescent health, we followed
previous practices used by the Countdown group10,11 and the SQUIRE reporting guideline for quality
improvement studies,23 and conducted the imputation for the projects with primary purpose listed
in eTable 4 in the Supplement (eg, general budget support, family planning, health education, or

 infectious diseases control). The imputation was processed in the following ways: For general budget
support, the allocation factor was generated by multiplying the country-specific proportion of
government spending on health by the proportion of population between 10 and 24 years of age in
that year in the country.18,24 For the projects related to family planning and reproductive health, we
allocated the funds for adolescent health using the proportion of the population between 15 and 24
years of age in that year within the population between 15 and 49 years of age to reflect women’
s
active reproductive age.25 For other funding categories, we allocated the funds for adolescent health
according to the country-specific proportion of the population between 10 and 24 years of age in
that year in the total population (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
We translated all key words into 8 major languages: Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch,
German, Norwegian, and Swedish. After conducting a key word search, we investigated how many
projects that were not related to DAAH were falsely coded as DAAH projects when using the key
word search. We manually reviewed the 3 variables for the selected projects and corrected for
misspecification. For example, we excluded projects on “
environmental health”that were captured
with the key words of “mental health.”We excluded 22 103 projects that were falsely coded as DAAH
and kept 276 002 projects.
Previous studies observed that a key word search strategy could lead to missing some projects
for DAAH owing to imperfect sensitivity of the strategy.20,26-28 We investigated the percentage of
projects for DAAH that were not captured by a key word search. To do so, we randomly selected
10.0% of all projects from the health sector (3268 of 32 680 projects) and 2.0% from other sectors
(3871 of 193 541 projects) in 2015, and we applied the key word search and manually coded the
selected projects separately. We then compared the results from the 2 methods and found that the
key word searches missed about 11 of 7139 DAAH projects (0.15%).
Projects identified by the 2 strategies were allocated to adolescent-targeted and adolescent-
inclusive categories. We defined the adolescent-targeted DAAH as the aid for projects with the
primary objective (19 921 projects) of preventing diseases and maintaining, restoring, and improving
the health of those aged 10 to 24 years. The adolescent-inclusive DAAH was the sum of the following
3 components: adolescent-targeted DAAH; projects that partially targeted adolescent health but
also benefited members of other age groups, such as children; and projects that benefited
adolescent health but did not specifically mention that they either exclusively or partially targeted
adolescent health, such as family planning projects. Following earlier studies,10-12,14,20 we used actual
disbursements to estimate donors’contributions to DAAH because disbursements reflect the actual
amount of resources delivered.
Analyzing the Projects for DAAH
Using both the adolescent-targeted and adolescent-inclusive estimates, we tracked levels and trends
of DAAH spending between 2003 and 2015 in total and per adolescent. We also identified the top
10 donors during the study period and disaggregated DAAH by recipient regions and countries. When
estimating at regional or country levels, we excluded projects not allocable to a specific region
or country.
We tracked the DAAH and specifically targeted the top 10 DALYs of adolescents estimated by
the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, including skin and subcutaneous diseases, road
injuries, HIV and AIDS, iron-deficiency anemia, self-harm, interpersonal violence, depressive
disorders, low back and neck pain, diarrheal diseases, and tuberculosis.29 The definitions and the
level of leading DALYs are presented in eTable 5 in the Supplement.
To identify the projects targeting the 10 leading DALYs, we used a combination of age-related
key words (eTable 3 in the Supplement) and target-specific key words for searching. The target-
specific key words for the 10 leading DALYs of adolescent health were derived from previous
studies9-11,20 and our review of scientific journals and reports. The key words for each of these areas
are presented in eTables 6 to 15 in the Supplement. For projects with multiple purposes (eg, both

 HIV and AIDS and tuberculosis), we followed previous studies8,20 and included projects and
estimations of both health focuses.
Results
Number of Adolescent-Targeted DAAH Projects in Each Sector
There were 19 921 projects targeting adolescent health in the adolescent-targeted estimation. Table 1
shows that 11 576 projects (58.1%) were allocated to the health service sector (including general
health, basic health, and population and reproductive health) and that the remaining 8345 projects
(41.9%) were allocated to nonhealth sectors. Population and reproductive health received the largest
number of projects (9964 [50.0%]), with the most common themes being adolescent sexual and
reproductive health, as well as HIV prevention. The education sector received 3138 projects (15.8%),
with health education and school-based health interventions (eg, nutrition or behavioral
intervention) the most common themes. Government and civil society received 2322 projects
(11.7%), with the most common themes being empowering young women and improving the health
of young people affected by armed conflict. The social infrastructure and services sector received
1385 projects (7.0%), with the most common themes addressing youth HIV and AIDS and prevention
of youth violence. All other sectors together, including water and sanitation, economic infrastructure
and services, multisector and cross-cutting, humanitarian aid, and unallocated or unspecified, had
1500 projects (7.5%).
Estimates of Total Aid Disbursed to Adolescent-Targeted DAAH
Between 2003 and 2015, $3634.6 million was disbursed to DAAH, accounting for 1.6% of the total
DAH of $222 974 million. Figure 1 shows that DAAH increased approximately 5-fold, from $109.7
million in 2003 to $528.5 million in 2015. Disbursement for sexual and reproductive health and HIV
and AIDS increased more than 3.6 times, from $87.4 million in 2003 to $315.4 million in 2015. Sexual
and reproductive health and HIV and AIDS accounted for 59.0% ($271.3 million of $461.2 million) to
81.5% ($224.8 million of $276.0 million) of total DAAH in each year studied and cumulatively
accounted for 68.0% ($2473.0 million of $3634.6 million) of total DAAH disbursed between 2003
and 2015. As a percentage of total DAH, DAAH increased from 1.3% ($109.7 million of $8566.5
million) in 2003 to 2.2% ($528.5 million of $24 008.5 million) in 2015 (eFigure 1 and eTable 16 in the
Supplement). Estimates of adolescent-inclusive DAAH disbursements show a similar increasing trend
during the study period (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).

 Estimates of Total Aid Disbursements to Adolescent-Targeted DAAH by Donors
The top 10 donors providing the largest cumulative funding between 2003 and 2015 are presented
in eFigure 3 in the Supplement. The top 5 donors (Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
Malaria, $806.8 million; United Nations Population Fund, $401.3 million; United States, $389.9
million; United Kingdom, $251.8 million; International Development Association, $218.6 million)
together provided 56.9% of total DAAH across the study period (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Sexual and reproductive health and HIV and AIDS have been the major focuses of all top 5 donors; for
example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria donated $748.7 million to these 2
areas, accounting for 92.8% of its total DAAH disbursement. When using adolescent-inclusive
estimates, the United States was the largest donor (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Similarly, most of
the investment made by the United States went to HIV and AIDS prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment, as well as to reproductive health.
Estimates of Per-Adolescent Aid Disbursed to Adolescent-Targeted DAAH
by Recipient Region and Recipient Country
Table 2 presents trends of DAAH per adolescent by recipient region and income between 2003 and
2015. The annual DAAH per adolescent in a region and income group is calculated as the total DAAH
for all included countries in that region and income group divided by the total adolescent population
of those countries in a year. Overall, DAAH per adolescent increased steadily over time by 4-fold,
from $0.06 in 2003 to $0.24 in 2015. The annual growth rate reached 12.3%. Among the 50
countries in Africa, 49 of them belong to sub-Saharan Africa, except for Algeria. The cumulative
DAAH per adolescent in sub-Saharan Africa was the highest among all regions ($5.37). Except for
Europe and Southeast Asia, LICs have received higher cumulative DAAH per adolescent than lower-
middle–income countries (LMCs) and upper-middle–income countries in each region. The Americas
(North America, Central America, and South America) were the only regions with LMCs receiving
more DAAH per adolescent than LICs for most years, but Haiti was the only LIC in the Americas, and,
in 1 year (2009), its DAAH per capita reached as high as $8.93, with major efforts to control HIV and
AIDS and improve reproductive health. The Western Pacific region received the least amount of
DAAH per adolescent in almost all the years studied. However, its LICs received $1.00 DAAH per
adolescent in 2015, the second-highest amount among all regions and income groups in that year.
The adolescent-inclusive estimates show similar results (eTable 17 in the Supplement).
In terms of cumulative DAAH per adolescent at the country level (eTable 18 in the Supplement),
countries with small adolescent populations, such as Vanuatu ($111.6, the highest), Guyana ($85.9,
the second highest), Cabo Verde ($82.7, the third highest), Kiribati ($69.7, the fourth highest), and
Belize ($66.1, the fifth highest), received the highest cumulative DAAH per adolescent. Of countries
ranked in the top 10 of cumulative DAAH per adolescent between 2003 and 2015, two were LICs
(Sierra Leone and Malawi), 6 were LMCs (Vanuatu, Guyana, Cabo Verde, Kiribati, Belize, and São
Tomé and Principe), and 2 were upper-middle–income countries (Grenada and Bosnia and
Herzegovina). Most of the top 10 countries belong to the middle-income group with small
populations. Adolescent-inclusive estimates showed a similar trend (eTable 19 in the Supplement).
Figure 2 summarizes the annual growth rates of DAAH per adolescent at the country level. We
established 5 groups based on the compound annual growth rate. Three countries had growth rates
of 50% or more, including 1 LIC (Eritrea) and 2 LMCs (São Tomé and Principe and Tonga). São Tomé
and Principe had the highest annual growth rate (149.4%), largely owing to the extremely low DAAH
per adolescent in the early years of coverage. A total of 26 countries had annual growth rates of
DAAH per adolescent above 20% and below 50%, including 20 LICs or LMCs (eg, Burundi, Malawi,
and Zambia). A total of 28 countries had moderate annual growth rates above 10% and below 20%,
including 22 LICs or LMCs (eg, Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Mali). The DAAH per adolescent in another
39 countries increased above 0% but was below 10%, including 28 LICs or LMCs (eg, Uganda, Chad,
and Benin). There were 34 countries with negative annual growth rates, including 5 LICs (eg, Gambia,
Mozambique, and Tajikistan), 9 LMCs (eg, Yemen, Kiribati, and Senegal), and 20 upper-middle–

Adolescent-Targeted DAAH Disbursements Targeting the Leading DALYs
of Adolescents
Table 3 presents the top 10 DALYs for the 132 countries involved in our study in 2015 and the
corresponding DAAH they received targeting these DALYs. In the overall setting, skin and
subcutaneous diseases accounted for the largest amount of DALYs (7.6% of total DALYs for
adolescents [17 561 626.05 of 231 030 476.65]) and were the leading cause of DALYs in 2015. Overall,
HIV and AIDS received the largest amount of adolescent-targeted DAAH in all settings, followed by
interpersonal violence, tuberculosis, and diarrheal diseases. Other leading causes of DALYs, such as
skin and subcutaneous diseases, low back and neck pain, road injury, iron-deficiency anemia, and

a Unallocable or regional DAAH projects were not included. All disbursement data were
converted to constant 2015 US dollars. We calculated DAAH per adolescent for each
category with the formula: total DAAH disbursements to all countries in that category/
total population of all countries in that category. For example, DAAH per adolescent in
Africa equals the sum of DAAH to each African country divided by the sum of
adolescent population in each African country. If a country was missing data on
adolescent population or DAAH disbursement, we excluded the country from our
analysis.

 depressive disorders, received either no DAAH or a very small amount of DAAH. The results
presented by adolescent-inclusive estimates are similar.
Discussion
Using data from the CRS, we tracked DAAH disbursements to 132 recipient countries. We found that,
despite the volume of adolescent-targeted DAAH increasing 5-fold between 2003 and 2015, it
accounted for only a small share of total DAH (2.2% in 2015). Considering that one-fourth of the
world’
s population are adolescents (10-24 years of age), it is clear that adolescent health has not been
a priority of donors.18 The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the United Nations
Population Fund; the United States; the United Kingdom; and the International Development
Association were the top 5 leading donors of adolescent-targeted DAAH, and together they
contributed $2.1 billion DAAH (56.9% of total adolescent-targeted DAAH). Between 2014 and 2015,
the United Kingdom was the driving force for the increase in DAAH, and its disbursements to DAAH
increased by $77.5 million. Consequently, the total DAAH increased by $67.3 million, from $461.2
million in 2014 to $528.5 million in 2015. Sexual and reproductive health and HIV and AIDS have been
the major focus of DAAH, which received 68.0% of total adolescent-targeted DAAH between 2003
and 2015.
Among all regions, Africa received the highest cumulative DAAH per adolescent, and the
Western Pacific received the least. However, the DAAH per adolescent of LICs in the Western Pacific
is close to that in Africa ($1.00 vs $1.18 in 2015). At the country level, countries that received the
highest amount of DAAH per adolescent were mostly less populous, with small populations of
adolescents. This finding was consistent with previous studies showing a negative association
between development assistance per capita and population size.30-32
Among the top 10 leading DALYs in 2015, HIV and AIDS had the largest amount of DAAH per
adolescent in all income groups. Other leading causes of DALYs, such as road injuries, depressive
disorder, and iron-deficiency anemia, received either no DAAH or very small amounts of DAAH,
suggesting that the allocation of DAAH does not match well with the burden of diseases. Our results

Unallocable or regional development assistance for adolescent health projects were not
included. All disbursement data were converted to constant 2015 US dollars. Annual
growth rate = (end value/start value)1/period − 1. For example, development assistance for
adolescent health per adolescent in Bangladesh was $0.035 in 2003 (start value) and
$0.312 in 2015 (end value). The period is 2015 − 2003 = 12 years. The compound annual
growth rate for Bangladesh is (0.312/0.035)1/12 − 1 = 19.94%.

 align with those of Skirbekk et al33 that demonstrate a mismatch between causes of disease burden
and allocation of DAH.
Limitations
There are some limitations in these analyses. First, the key word searching strategy was unable to
capture all DAAH projects; our validation study determined that roughly 0.15% of DAAH projects

 were not captured. Second, the quality of project descriptions from donors is a further potential
limitation, even though there was no evidence to show that the current reporting system would
introduce systematic bias in the estimates of DAAH relative to DAH. Third, the adolescent-targeted
estimates excluded projects in which adolescents were a partial target and may have underestimated
DAAH. In contrast, the adolescent-inclusive estimates included projects with purposes unrelated to
adolescent health and may have overestimated DAAH. Fourth, we used the proportion of
adolescents in the total population or population of reproductive age to allocate projects that could
benefit adolescents but that did not explicitly refer to adolescents. We found that, although
adolescents (10-24 years of age) accounted for one-fourth of the world’
s population in 2015, their
DALYs accounted for 11% of the total DALYs.18,29 Our allocation method may therefore lead to an
overestimation of adolescent-inclusive DAAH. Further limits include the missingness in CRS
disbursements before 2007 (eg, missingness rates in the health sector between 2003 and 2006
ranging from 7% to 16%)16,20 and the unavailability of aid data from new donors (eg, China) and
private foundations apart from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Conclusions
This study suggests a need to reconsider patterns and levels of international investment in
adolescent health. Although DALYs of adolescents accounted for 11% of global DALYs in 2015, the aid
disbursed to adolescent-targeted DAAH was only 2.2% of total DAH. This finding suggests that levels
of DAAH fall well short of that disbursed to projects targeted at other age groups. This inequity is
perhaps not surprising given that adolescent health has not been a priority during the era of the
United Nations Millennium Development Goals. However, with the introduction of the Global
Strategy for Women’
s, Children’
s and Adolescents’Health, much larger investments in adolescent
health are likely to be needed. The need for investment in adolescent health in LICs and middle
income countries is further heightened by the very large generation of adolescents currently growing
up in these countries.
The recent major focal areas for DAAH have been on sexual and reproductive health and HIV
and AIDS, with other leading treatable or preventable causes of disease burden, including anemia,
mental disorders, or road traffic injuries, largely overlooked. Interventions targeting several of these
areas have been found to have high benefit to cost ratios, even without considering the
intergenerational benefits.2 For example, the benefit to cost ratio for mental health care was recently
estimated to be 5.3, and the cost to benefit ratio for injury prevention was recently estimated to be
5.9.2 Although investments in sexual and reproductive health and HIV and AIDS should undoubtedly
be maintained and arguably extended, donors should consider investments in other causes of health
risk and disease burden with effective interventions and a strong economic case. Last, there is a need
for greater investment in evaluations of the effect of action in areas where cost-effectiveness data
are still limited, particularly in a local regional context. Such evidence would be invaluable in guiding
future resource allocations for adolescent health in comparison with other areas of need.
