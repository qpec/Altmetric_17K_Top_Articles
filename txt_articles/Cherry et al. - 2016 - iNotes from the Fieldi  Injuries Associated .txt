Injuries Associated with Bison Encounters — 
Yellowstone National Park, 2015

Since 1980, bison have injured more pedestrian visitors to 
Yellowstone National Park (Yellowstone) than any other animal 
(1). After the occurrence of 33 bison-related injuries during 
1983–1985 (range = 10–13/year), the park implemented suc-
cessful outreach campaigns (1) to reduce the average number 
of injuries to 0.8/year (range = 0–2/year) during 2010–2014 
(unpublished data, National Park Service, September 2015). 
During May–July 2015, five injuries associated with bison 
encounters occurred (Table). Case reports were reviewed to 
evaluate circumstances surrounding these injuries to inform 
prevention.
American bison (Bison bison) are the largest terrestrial mam-
mals in the Western Hemisphere (2). Yellowstone is home 
to the largest U.S. bison population on public land, with an 
estimated 4,900 bison in July 2015 (3). Mating season occurs 
during July–September, coinciding with Yellowstone’s peak 
tourism season. Mature bull aggressiveness increases during 
mating season (2). Yellowstone promulgates regulations that 
prohibit visitors from “willfully approaching, remaining, view-
ing, or engaging in any activity within 300 ft (91 m) of bears or 
wolves, or within 75 ft (23 m) of any other wildlife, including 
nesting birds, or within any distance that disturbs, displaces 
or otherwise interferes with the free unimpeded movement of 
wildlife, or creates or contributes to a potentially hazardous 
condition or situation” (4,5). Yellowstone conducts exten-
sive education campaigns to warn visitors of the dangers of 
approaching wildlife and inform visitors on the required view-
ing distances. A graphic flyer is distributed at park entrances, 
and signs are present throughout campgrounds, developed 
areas, along roadsides, and in the visitor centers.
The five persons injured during 2015 (four Yellowstone 
visitors and one employee) ranged in age from 16 to 68 years 
(median = 43 years); four were female. Every incident occurred 
in developed areas, such as hiking trails or geyser basins. Two 
persons were gored, and three were tossed into the air. Four 
persons required hospitalization, three of whom were trans-
ported by helicopter ambulance. There were no deaths.
All encounters resulted from failure to maintain the required 
distance of 75 ft (23 m) from bison. Four injuries occurred 
when three or more persons approached the bison. Two persons 
were injured while walking on hiking trails. Three persons 
sustained injuries while taking photographs at a distance of 
approximately 3–6 ft (1–2 m) from bison, including two who 
turned their back on the bison to take the photograph; one 
person reported taking a cell phone self-portrait (selfie), which 
necessitated getting close to the animal.
During 1980–1999, a total of 10 of 35 bison encounters 
(29%) involved photography (1); the majority of persons were 
≥10 ft (3 m) from the bison, unlike the 3–6 ft (1–2 m) reported 
with recent photography-related injuries. Smart phones now 
meet the needs of most casual photographers. Smart phones 
are owned by 64% of American adults, and 67% of smart 
phone owners report using their phone to share pictures and 
videos (6). The popularity of smart phone photography with 
its limited zoom capacity and social media sharing of selfies 
might explain why visitors disregard park regulations and 
approach wildlife more closely than when traditional camera 
technology was used. Educating visitors about wildlife behavior 
and the need to maintain distances of 75–300 ft (23–91 m) 
from wildlife for safety of persons and wildlife is critical. Injury 
prevention campaigns that identify and target the underlying 
motivations of visitors to not comply with viewing distances 
might prevent future injuries.
