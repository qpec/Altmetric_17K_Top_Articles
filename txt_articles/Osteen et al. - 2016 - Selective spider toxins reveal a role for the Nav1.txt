 actions at all Nav channels, but the discovery of selective modulators would facilitate the analysis 
of individual subtypes and their contributions to chemical, mechanical, or thermal pain. Here, we 
identify and characterize spider toxins that selectively activate the Nav1.1 subtype, whose role in 
nociception and pain has not been explored. We exploit these probes to demonstrate that Nav1.1-
expressing fibers are modality-specific nociceptors: their activation elicits robust pain behaviors 
without neurogenic inflammation and produces profound hypersensitivity to mechanical, but not 
thermal, stimuli. In the gut, high-threshold mechanosensitive fibers also express Nav1.1 and show 
enhanced toxin sensitivity in a model of irritable bowel syndrome. Altogether, these findings 
establish an unexpected role for Nav1.1 in regulating the excitability of sensory nerve fibers that 
underlie mechanical pain.
Pain is a multimodal system in which activation of functionally distinct sensory nerve fibers 
elicits acute, protective reflexes, as well as maladaptive responses that contribute to 
persistent pain1. In these nociceptive neurons, three voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels – 
Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 – have garnered particular attention because mutations affecting 
these subtypes are associated with insensitivity to pain or persistent pain syndromes2–6. 
Nav1.1 is also expressed by somatosensory neurons7–10, but no link has been established 
between this subtype and nociception11. Mutations affecting Nav1.1 are associated with 
central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as epilepsy12,13, autism14, and Alzheimer’s15, 
and these clinically dominant phenotypes may have masked roles for this subtype in 
peripheral neurons. For example, gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.1 underlie familial 
hemiplegic migraine type 3 (ref. 16), and while this phenotype has been ascribed to a CNS-
initiated mechanism17, dysfunction in sensory neurons may also contribute to this pain 
syndrome.
Another challenge to parsing out roles for Nav1.1 in pain is that of developing subtype-
selective drugs for any member of this highly conserved family of ion channels18. Natural 
products can be exploited as a source of evolutionarily honed agents that target receptors 
with exquisite specificity. Such agents may be found in complex venoms from spiders, 
scorpions, cone snails, and snakes, including toxins that excite sensory nociceptors to elicit 
pain or discomfort in offending predators19,20. Here we describe two algogenic tarantula 
toxins that selectively activate Nav1.1 to elicit acute pain and mechanical allodynia, 
providing new insights into specific roles for this channel and Nav1.1-expressing sensory 
nerve fibers in nociception and pain hypersensitivity.
 Selective Nav1.1 activating toxins
To identify novel toxins that target nociceptors, we used calcium imaging to screen through 
>100 spider, scorpion and centipede venoms for the ability to activate cultured 
somatosensory neurons. Venom from the tarantula Heteroscodra maculata (Fig. 1a) robustly 
excited a subset of neurons from trigeminal (TG) or dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from mice or 
rats. Venom fractionation yielded two active peptides, which were identified by MALDI-MS 
and Edman sequencing as inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) peptides of related sequence 
(Extended Data Fig. 1a). We named these toxins δ-theraphotoxin-Hm1a (Hm1a) and δ-
theraphotoxin-Hm1b (Hm1b). Application of synthetic Hm1a to rat DRG neurons likewise

 triggered calcium responses (Fig. 1b), validating Hm1a as an active venom component. All 
subsequent experiments were performed with synthetic Hm1a peptide unless otherwise 
stated.
Tetrodotoxin (TTX) blocked Hm1a-evoked calcium responses (Fig. 1b), suggesting 
involvement of Nav channels. Indeed, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from TG neurons 
showed that Hm1a robustly inhibited Nav current inactivation (Fig. 1c). Among Nav 
subtypes expressed by these neurons, only Nav1.1, 1.6 and 1.7 are sensitive to TTX21, 
narrowing our search. We next tested ICA-121431, a small molecule inhibitor with 
selectivity for Nav1.1 and 1.3 subtypes22 (Extended Data Fig. 1b), and found that it greatly 
diminished Hm1a-evoked calcium responses in both embryonic DRG and P0 mouse TG 
cultures (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1c–d), suggesting that Nav1.1 is the main target of 
Hm1a in somatosensory neurons. In contrast, ICA-121431 only partially blocked responses 
to SGTx1, an Hm1a-related peptide that shows little selectivity among Nav subtypes23 and 
excites a larger cohort of sensory neurons compared to Hm1a (Extended Data Fig. 1c–d). To 
confirm toxin selectivity for Nav1.1, we heterologously expressed Nav1.1–1.8 α subunits in 
Xenopus oocytes. Indeed, Hm1a potently inhibited hNav1.1 inactivation (EC50 = 38 ± 6 
nM), with substantially weaker effects on hNav1.2 and hNav1.3, and no effect on hNav1.4–
1.8 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1e). Similar results were obtained with native Hm1b 
(Extended Data Fig. 1f). Nav1.9 is not efficiently expressed in recombinant systems, but 
surrogate chimeras (rKv2.1 channels containing the S3b-S4 toxin-binding region from each 
of the four hNav1.9 domains) were also toxin insensitive (Extended Data Fig. 1g)24.
Hm1b is a novel toxin, but Hm1a was previously described as κ-theraphotoxin-Hm1a, a 
moderate-affinity blocker of Kv4.1 voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels25. We found, 
however, that high concentrations (up to 5 μM) of synthetic Hm1a blocked ≤20% of mKv4.1 
current (Extended Data Fig. 1h), and 1 μM native Hm1a displayed a saturating effect on 
Nav1.1, but failed to block mKv4.1 (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Moreover, in cultured sensory 
neurons, outward K+ currents were unaffected by 500 nM Hm1a, suggesting that its main 
physiologic target is Nav1.1. This may explain why injection of Hm1a into the mouse brain 
elicits convulsions and rapid death25. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Hm1a 
activates a subset of sensory neurons by selectively targeting Nav1.1.
Analysis of Hm1a-responsive TG neurons in whole-cell current clamp configuration showed 
toxin-evoked hyperexcitability (Fig. 1f). Hm1a did not alter resting membrane potential 
(before Hm1a, Vm = −55 ± 6 mV; after Hm1a, Vm = −56 ± 6 mV), however, it robustly 
enhanced spike frequency during a 20 pA current injection. Hm1a also significantly 
prolonged the action potential width (by 28.3 ± 8.4%; from 6.5 to 8.6 msec), consistent with 
introduction of non-inactivating sodium current (Fig. 1f). We found that toxin responses 
were most robust in sensory neuron cultures derived from young (embryonic or newborn) 
mice or rats, likely reflecting a lower threshold for action potential firing in these cells or 
culture conditions. Indeed, we found that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) sensitization26 of adult 
neurons prior to toxin exposure greatly enhanced the percentage of toxin sensitive cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 1i), consistent with this hypothesis.

  Selectivity depends on DIV S1-S2 loop
Our data suggest that Hm1a inhibits both the speed and extent of fast inactivation (Fig. 2a), 
similar to the mechanism described for less selective peptide toxins that bind to the S3b-S4 
voltage sensor region of domain IV (DIV)23. To determine whether Hm1a targets the same 
locale, we transferred each of four S3b-S4 regions from hNav1.1 into the cognate location of 
the homo-tetrameric rKv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel, which is normally insensitive 
to the toxin (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Indeed, transfer of just the DIV S3b-S4 region rendered 
rKv2.1 sensitive to Hm1a, demonstrating that this segment is a primary determinant of toxin 
action (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2b). However, this region is identical or highly 
conserved in hNav1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, and thus cannot fully account for toxin selectivity. To 
identify other functionally important regions, we constructed chimeras between Nav1.1 and 
Nav1.4, the latter being completely insensitive to Hm1a. Replacement of the S3b-S4 region 
of hNav1.4 with that from hNav1.1 did not confer toxin sensitivity, whereas transfer of both 
S3b-S4 and the S1-S2 loop resulted in full toxin sensitivity (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 
2c–e). These results indicate that both domains together determine toxin sensitivity and 
subtype selectivity, consistent with previous suggestions that S1-S2 contributes to toxin 
recognition sites on voltage sensors27,28.
 Nav1.1 is found on myelinated Aδ fibers
Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, we found that Nav1.1 transcripts are expressed 
primarily by medium-diameter sensory neurons constituting 35% of all cells, most of which 
(>75%) belong to the myelinated (NF200-positive) cohort (Fig. 3). In contrast, we observed 
limited (5–11%) overlap of Nav1.1-positive cells with markers of small diameter, 
unmyelinated neurons, including TRPV1, CGRP, tyrosine hydroxylase, and the lectin IB4. 
However, we did see substantial co-expression with the 5-HT3 receptor (43% of Nav1.1-
positive cells express 5-HT3), a marker of lightly myelinated Aδ neurons29. Finally, 22% of 
Nav1.1-positive cells also expressed the cold/menthol receptor, TRPM8, which is found in 
both C and Aδ fibers30. Taken together, we conclude that Nav1.1 is expressed primarily by 
myelinated neurons, including Aδ fibers, consistent with previous histological and 
transcriptome profiling data 7,31. We also characterized Hm1a-sensitive neurons for 
responses to other receptor-selective agonists (Extended Data Fig. 3b), further confirming 
this assignment. Interestingly, most (>85%) Nav1.1-positive cells also expressed Nav1.7, 
suggesting that this population of myelinated neurons contributes to nociception (see below).
We next explored the effect of Hm1a on mechanonociceptive Aδ fibers (AMs) using the ex 
vivo skin-nerve preparation. We found that application of 1μM Hm1a to cutaneous receptive 
fields significantly increased firing rate in these AM fibers in response to mechanical stimuli 
(Fig. 3d), confirming expression of functional Nav1.1 in this afferent population. Previous 
studies found limited expression of TRPV1 in AM fibers33, consistent with our findings of 
limited overlap between Nav1.1 and TRPV1. Taken together, these functional data confirm 
our histological assignment of Nav1.1 expression to myelinated Aδ fibers, and further 
suggest that Nav1.1 participates in mechanical nociception.

  Hm1a elicits pain and touch sensitivity
Does activation of Nav1.1-expressing fibers produces pain behaviors? Indeed, injection of 
Hm1a (5μM in 10μl) into the mouse hind paw elicited immediate and robust nocifensive 
responses (bouts of licking or biting of the injected paw) throughout the observation period 
(Fig. 4a). Toxin injection also significantly increased Fos immunoreactivity in dorsal horn 
neurons of the superficial lamina ipsilateral to the injection, signifying functional 
engagement of nociceptors and their central connections (Fig. 4b). To exclude the possibility 
that this depends on the small population of fibers co-expressing TRPV1 and Nav1.1, we 
ablated TRPV1-positive terminals by intrathecal (spinal) injection of capsaicin34, in which 
case Hm1a-evoked nocifensive behavior persisted (Fig. 4a). Remarkably, Hm1a did not 
produce swelling or plasma extravasation of the injected paw, a neurogenic inflammatory 
response readily provoked by activation of peptidergic C-fiber nociceptors that include most 
TRPV1-expressing neurons (Fig. 4c). These results further suggest that Hm1a elicits pain by 
activating a non-peptidergic subset of myelinated sensory fibers.
Genetic or pharmacologic elimination of TRPV1-expressing fibers greatly diminishes 
sensitivity to noxious heat, but does not perturb sensitivity to mechanical stimuli34–36. In 
light of the anatomical and physiological results described above, we asked whether Hm1a 
has differential effects on these modalities by monitoring responses to thermal and 
mechanical stimuli following intraplantar injection of toxin at a dose (500nM in 10μl) 
insufficient to elicit acute behavior. Indeed, intraplantar injection of Hm1a did not alter 
sensitivity to heat, but produced robust sensitization to mechanical stimulation that was not 
dependent on TRPV1-expressing fibers (Fig. 4d, e). Equivalent mechanical sensitization was 
also observed following injection of native Hm1b peptide (Fig. 4e). In agreement with these 
behavioral observations, we found that all Hm1a-responsive adult DRG neurons displayed 
mechanically activated currents, except for those neurons that were also capsaicin sensitive 
(Fig. 4f).
To confirm the requirement of Nav1.1 in toxin-evoked behaviors, we crossed mice bearing a 
floxed Nav1.1 allele13 to a line expressing Cre recombinase under control of the peripherin 
promoter, which is active in a large percentage of unmyelinated and myelinated sensory 
neurons during development37. Indeed, analysis of a peripherin-Cre x YFP reporter line 
showed that these animals express Cre recombinase in 46% of Nav1.1-positive cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). Strikingly, elimination of Nav1.1 from this subset of fibers 
significantly attenuated toxin-evoked behaviors, including both acute nocifensive responses 
and mechanical sensitization (Fig. 4a, e).
Robust activation of nociceptive pathways by nerve injury or inflammation can trigger both 
primary and secondary sensitization, the latter of which can manifest as mechanical or heat 
hypersensitivity contralateral to the insult38,39. In fact, we found that unilateral injection of 
Hm1a produced robust and equivalent mechanical sensitization of both the injected and 
contralateral paw (Fig. 4e). This contralateral sensitization was also modality specific as no 
change in heat sensitivity was observed (Fig. 4d). Importantly, Hm1a-mediated mechanical 
sensitivity was equivalently reduced in ipsilateral and contralateral paws of Nav1.1-
peripherin Cre animals, demonstrating that contralateral effects depend on Nav1.1 (Fig. 4e).

 Since we did not observe signs of neurogenic inflammation, we asked whether this 
phenotype results from Hm1a-mediated nerve injury. However, this seems unlikely since 
toxin injection failed to induce expression of ATF3, a marker of nerve damage40 (Extended 
Data Fig. 4c). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that direct activation of 
Nav1.1-expressing fibers is sufficient to produce robust and modality-specific bilateral 
sensitization.
 Nav1.1 and irritable bowel syndrome
Chronic mechanical hypersensitivity underlies the development of abdominal pain in 
patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)41. Given the apparent role of Nav1.1 in 
mechano-nociception, we asked if this channel is expressed by mechanically sensitive fibers 
of the gut, and if so, whether it contributes to neuronal sensitization in a model of chronic 
visceral mechanical hypersensitivity (CVH)42. We therefore examined mechanical responses 
in an ex vivo gut-nerve preparation from healthy or CVH mice. In preparations from healthy 
animals, Hm1a increased mechanically-evoked spiking in a sub-population (40%) of high-
threshold colonic afferents that constitute presumptive mechano-nociceptors (Fig. 5a and 
Extended Data Fig. 5a). Correspondingly, ICA-121431 reduced mechanical responses in 
50% of fibers examined and blocked Hm1a sensitization (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 
5a). Moreover, Hm1a significantly reduced the threshold for action potential firing in a 
subset (45%) of retrogradely traced colonic DRG neurons as measured by whole-cell current 
clamp analysis (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 5b). These results demonstrate that a subset 
of high-threshold mechanosensitive colonic fibers express functional Nav1.1 channels.
In colonic afferents from CVH mice, baseline mechanosensory responses were elevated 
compared to healthy controls (compare Figs. 5a and 5c). Application of Hm1a enhanced 
mechanically-evoked spiking in a subset (36%) of CVH fibers beyond this already elevated 
level (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, in the context of CVH (and in contrast to normal controls), 
toxin application dramatically increased the electrical excitability of most (64%) 
retrogradely traced colonic DRG neurons (Fig. 5d), suggesting functional upregulation of 
Nav1.1. Furthermore, ICA-121431 reduced mechanosensory responses in most (70%) CVH 
sensitized fibers to levels resembling those of baseline controls (compare Figs. 5a and 5c), 
and blocked the sensitizing effects of Hm1a (Fig. 5c). Taken together, these results support a 
role for Nav1.1 in mechanical hypersensitivity in IBS.
 Concluding remarks
Development of Nav channel subtype-selective ligands is an important, but challenging goal. 
Our results identify a site within the DIV S1-S2 loop that enhances subtype selectivity, 
providing a potential strategy for designing other subtype-specific gating modifiers. 
Moreover, toxins such as Hm1a/b that alter inactivation may be of particular utility in 
boosting Nav channel activity where partial loss-of-function has been linked to 
developmental or neurodegenerative disorders, such as autism, Alzheimer’s or Dravet 
syndrome14,15,43. Analysis of toxin-channel interactions, including the multi-site nature of 
this pharmacophore, may shed new light on strategies for developing a broader class of 
molecules having a similar selectivity and functional profile.

 The critical role of Nav1.1 in the brain may have prevented its prior recognition as a 
contributor to peripheral pain signaling. Our results now unambiguously implicate Nav1.1 
and Nav1.1-expressing myelinated afferents in nociception. Activation or sensitization of 
these fibers is sufficient to elicit robust acute pain, as well as mechanical allodynia, without 
triggering neurogenic inflammation, distinguishing these fibers from well-characterized C-
nociceptors. Previous studies have implicated myelinated Aδ fibers in mechano-
nociception44,45, and Nav1.1 now provides an important new marker with which to more 
precisely identify the contribution of these fibers to acute and chronic pain.
Our findings with the CVH model suggest that pharmacological blockade of Nav1.1 
represents a novel therapeutic strategy for diminishing chronic pain associated with IBS, and 
perhaps other pain conditions associated with mechanical sensitization, including migraine 
headache. While Nav1.1 activity in the brain may underlie aura in FHM3 patients17, our 
results suggest that these gain-of-function mutations may also produce migraine pain 
through actions of Nav1.1 in mechanical nociceptors. In fact, anticonvulsants that target Nav 
channels, including Nav1.1, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing migraine attacks in 
some individuals46,47. Moreover, rufinamide, an anticonvulsant that was recently shown to 
inhibit Nav1.1 (ref. 48), has also been reported to diminish nerve-injury evoked mechanical 
allodynia49. Our findings therefore provide a mechanistic rationale for these actions, and 
motivate further analysis of Nav1.1 and Nav1.1-expressing nociceptors in acute and 
persistent pain.
 Methods
 Venom collection and screening
Venoms from spiders, scorpions and centipedes were collected by mild electrical stimulation 
of the chelicerae, telson or forcipules, respectively. Venoms were then lyophilized and kept 
frozen until use. Approximately 100 venoms were tested by ratiometric calcium imaging 
using a standard inverted microscope setup. Responses to high extracellular potassium 
(150mM), capsaicin (1 μM), or previously characterized venoms or purified toxins19 were 
used to validate the health and robustness of sensory neuron cultures used in screening 
assays. Responses were digitized and analyzed using MetaMorph software (Molecular 
Devices). Venom-evoked responses that were stimulus-locked, visually detectable above 
background, and restricted to neurons (i.e. did not cause calcium entry into glia or 
fibroblasts) were selected for further analysis. Pharmacological analysis was used to narrow 
down potential targets and crude venoms or purified fractions were subsequently tested on 
cloned candidate channels. Candidates were taken forward based on the robustness of the 
response and evidence for selectivity at novel targets. See Supplementary Information for a 
summary of venoms that produced no detectible or specific response in our hands.

 (MeCN), 0.1% formic acid in water) in solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) was used at a 
flow rate of 1 ml/min: 5% B for 5 min, then 5–20% B for 5 min followed by 20–40% B over 
40 min. Absorbance was measured at 214 nm and 280 nm and collected fractions were 
lyophilized before storage at −20°C.
 Mass Spectrometry
Peptide masses were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) 
time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) using a 4700 Proteomics Bioanalyzer model 
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Peptides were dissolved in water and mixed 1:1 (v/v) 
with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (7 mg/ml in 50% MeCN, 5% formic acid) and 
mass spectra acquired in positive reflector mode. All reported masses are for the 
monoisotopic M+H+ ions.
 Sequence determination
N-terminal sequencing was performed by the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility 
(Sydney, NSW, Australia). In brief, Hm1a (600 pmol) and Hm1b (250 pmol) were 
reconstituted and reduced by addition DTT (25 mM) followed by incubation at 56°C for 0.5 
h. The samples were then alkylated using iodoacetamide (55 mM) at room temperature for 
0.5 h and purified by RP-HPLC using a Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (3 × 150 mm). The 
target peaks of interest were identified, collected then reduced to minimal volume under 
vacuum. The entire sample was loaded onto a precycled, Biobrene-treated disc and subjected 
to 37 (Hm1a) or 42 (Hm1b) cycles of Edman N-terminal sequencing, respectively. 
Automated Edman degradation was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 494 Procise 
Protein Sequencing System.
Edman degradation of Hm1a yielded 
ECRYLFGGCSSTSDCCKHLSCRSDWKYCAWDGTF as the sequence, which has a 
calculated monoisotopic mass (for the M+H+ ion) of 3908.58 Da. This is 86.97 Da short of 
the monoisotopic mass of Hm1a of 3995.55 Da. Hence, we conclude that a serine residue 
(87 Da) is missing on the C-terminal end of Hm1a to give a complete sequence of 
ECRYLFGGCSSTSDCCKHLSCRSDWKYCAWDGTFS. The complete sequence has a 
calculated monoisotopic mass (for the M+H+ ion) of 3995.61 Da, which is only 0.06 Da 
different to the mass that was measured for the native Hm1a.
Edman degradation of Hm1b yielded 
ECRYLFGGCKTTADCCKHLGCRTDLYYCAWDGT as the sequence, which has a 
calculated monoisotopic mass (for the M+H+ ion) of 3745.6 Da. This is 147 Da short of the 
monoisotopic mass of Hm1a of 3892.60 Da. We therefore conclude that an amidated 
phenylalanine is missing on the C-terminal end of Hm1b to give a complete sequence of 
ECRYLFGGCKTTADCCKHLGCRTDLYYCAWDGTF-NH2. To confirm that the C-
terminus of Hm1b is amidated, we digested native Hm1b with carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) 
and monitored the reaction by MALDI-TOF to identify the mass of the C-terminal residue as 
described previously51. 5 μL of 800 ng/μL native Hm1b in 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 
5.5, was incubated with 2 ng/μL CPY at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was monitored by 
removing 0.4 μL at 0, 1, 5, 10 and 20 min and spotting it on a MALDI plate with equal

 volume of 7 mg/mL α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile, 5% formic 
acid (FA). Dried spots were washed with 10 μL 1% FA and allowed to dry before they were 
analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS on a 4700 Proteomics Bioanalyser (Applied Biosciences, 
Foster City, CA, USA), acquiring spectra in reflector positive mode. The first CPY-mediated 
cleavage yielded a mass difference of 146 Da, which corresponds to an amidated 
phenylanine residue. Thus, the complete sequence has a calculated monoisotopic mass (for 
the M+H+ ion) of 3892.64 Da, matching the native Hm1b.
 Hm1a synthesis
Solvents for reversed-phase HPLC consisted of 0.05% TFA/H2O (solvent A) and 90% 
MeCN/0.043% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/H2O (solvent B). Analytical HPLC was performed 
on a Shimadzu LC20AT system using a Thermo Hypersil GOLD 2.1 × 100 mm C18 column 
heated at 40°C with flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. A gradient of 10 to 55% B over 30 min was 
used, with detection at 214 nm. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Vydac 218TP1022 
column running at a flow rate of 16 mL/min using a gradient of 10 to 50% solvent B over 40 
min. Mass spectrometry was performed on an API2000 (ABI Sciex) mass spectrometer in 
positive ion mode. All reagents were obtained commercially and were used without further 
purification.
Hm1a was synthesized using regioselective disulfide-bond formation52–54. The peptide was 
assembled on a 0.1 mmol scale using a Symphony (Protein Technologies Inc.) automated 
peptide synthesiser and a H-Ser(tBu)-2-ClTrt (loading 0.69 mmol/g) polystyrene resin. 
Couplings were performed in dimethylformamide (DMF) using 5 equivalents of Fmoc-
amino acid/(2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate 
(HBTU)/N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) (1:1:1) relative to resin loading for 2 × 20 min. 
Fmoc deprotection was achieved using 30% piperidine/DMF (1 × 1.5 min, then 1 × 4 min). 
Non-cysteine amino acid side-chains were protected as Asp(OtBu), Arg(Pbf), Glu(OtBu), 
His(Trt), Lys(Boc), Ser(tBu), Thr(tBu), Trp(Boc) and Tyr(tBu). The cysteine side chains 
were protected as Cys2,Cys16(Meb), Cys9,Cys21(Dpm), and Cys15,Cys28(Trt). Cleavage 
from the resin was achieved by treatment with 10% acetic acid (AcOH)/10% 
trifluoroethanol (TFE)/dichloromethane (DCM) at room temperature for 1 h. The product 
was precipitated and washed with n-hexane then lyophilized from 1,4-dioxane/MeCN/H2O.
The first disulfide bond (Cys15–Cys28) was formed by dissolving the crude product in in 
HFIP (5 mL) and adding dropwise to a stirred solution of I2 (4 equiv) in 10% 1,1,1,3,3,3-
hexafluoropropan-2-ol (HFIP)/DCM (20 mL) over 5 min. Stirring was continued for a 
further 5 min then the solution was poured into a solution of ascorbic acid/sodium acetate in 
H2O. The aqueous phase was extracted with DCM, and the combined organic layers washed 
with water. Following removal of solvent under reduced pressure, the product was 
lyophilized from 1,4-dioxane/MeCN/H2O. ESI-MS (m/z): calc. (avg) 2159.4 [M+3H]3+, 
found 2159.7.
The remaining side chain protecting groups [except Cys(Meb)] were removed by treatment 
with 95% TFA/2.5% triisopropylsilane (TIPS)/2.5% H2O at room temperature for 2 h. After 
most of the cleavage solution was evaporated under a stream of N2, the product was 
precipitated and washed with cold Et2O and lyophilized from 50% MeCN/0.1% TFA/H2O to

 give Cys2,Cys16(Meb), Cys9,Cys21(SH), Cys15–Cys28(SS) Hm1a (280 mg). ESI-MS 
(m/z): calc. (avg) 1404.3 [M+3H]3+, found 1404.1.
The second disulfide bond (Cys9–Cys21) was formed by dissolving the crude product from 
the previous step in 30% DMSO/0.1 M HCl (0.5 mg/mL) and stirring at room temperature 
for 24 h. Cys2,16(Meb), Cys9–Cys21(SS), Cys15–Cys28(SS) Hm1a was then isolated by 
preparative HPLC (30 mg). ESI-MS (m/z): calc. (avg) 1403.6 [M+3H]3+, found 1403.3.
Formation of the third disulfide bond (Cys2–Cys16) was then achieved by first removing the 
Cys(Meb) groups by treatment with HF/p-cresol (9:1) at 0°C for 1 h. The product was 
precipitated and washed with cold Et2O and lyophilized from 50% MeCN/0.1% TFA/H2O 
yielding Cys2,16(SH), Cys9–Cys21(SS), Cys15–Cys28(SS) Hm1a (24 mg). ESI-MS (m/z): 
calc. (avg) 1334.1 [M+3H]3+, found 1333.7. Oxidation of the liberated thiols was performed 
using 30% DMSO/0.1 M HCl as described for the second disulfide bond to yield fully 
oxidised Hm1a (3 mg) that was indistinguishable by analytical HPLC from an authentic 
sample. ESI-MS (m/z): calc. (avg) 1333.5 [M+3H]3+, found 1333.1.
 Nav and Kv channel constructs
Human (h)Nav1.4, hNav1.5, and rat (r)Kv2.1 were generously provided by P. Ruben (Simon 
Fraser University, Canada), C. Ahern (University of Iowa, USA), and K. Swartz (NINDS, 
NIH, USA), respectively. hNav1.1–1.3, hNav1.6–1.8 were obtained from Origene 
Technologies, Inc. (MD, USA). Accession numbers are NM_001165963.1 (hNav1.1), 
NM_021007.2 (hNav1.2), NM_006922.3 (hNav1.3), NM_000334 (hNav1.4), NM_198056 
(hNav1.5), NM_014191.2 (hNav1.6), NM_002977.2 (hNav1.7), and NM_006514.3 
(hNav1.8). Channel chimeras were generated using sequential PCR with rNav1.4 (generous 
gift from B. Chanda, University of Wisconsin, USA), Kv2.1Δ755,56, hNav1.1, and hNav1.924 
(Origene Technologies: NM_014139.2) as templates. Mouse Kv4.1 was obtained from 
Addgene and originated in the laboratory of L. Salkoff. The Kv2.1Δ7 construct contains 
seven point mutations in the outer vestibule that render the channel sensitive to agitoxin-2, a 
pore-blocking scorpion toxin57. cRNA of all constructs was synthesized using T3 or T7 
polymerase (mMessage mMachine kit, Life Technologies, USA) after linearizing the fully-
sequenced DNA with appropriate restriction enzymes.
 Electrophysiology
 Xenopus Oocytes— Channels and chimeras were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes 
(animals acquired from Xenopus one®, USA) that were incubated at 17 °C in Barth’s 
medium (88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 0.33 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mM CaCl2, 0.82 mM MgSO4, 
2.4 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM HEPES, and 0.1 mg/mL gentamycin; pH 7.6 with NaOH) for 1–4 
days after cRNA injection, and then were studied using two-electrode voltage-clamp 
recording techniques (OC-725C; Warner Instruments or GeneClamp 500B; Axon 
Instruments) with a 150-μl recording chamber or a small volume (<20μl) oocyte perfusion 
chamber (AutoMate Scientific). Data were filtered at 4 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz using 
pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices, USA). Microelectrode resistances were 0.5–1 MΩ 
when filled with 3 M KCl. For Kv channel experiments, the external recording solution 
contained (in mM): 50 KCl, 50 NaCl, 5 HEPES, 1 MgCl2 and 0.3 CaCl2, pH 7.6 with

 NaOH. For Nav channel experiments, the external recording solution contained (in mM): 
100 NaCl, 5 HEPES, 1 MgCl2 and 1.8 CaCl2, pH 7.6 with NaOH. All experiments were 
performed at room temperature (~22 °C) and toxin samples were diluted in recording 
solution with 0.1% BSA. Leak and background conductance, identified by blocking the 
channel with agitoxin-2 or TTX, were subtracted for Kv or Nav channel currents, 
respectively. Voltage–activation relationships were obtained by measuring tail currents for 
Kv channels, or by monitoring steady-state currents and calculating conductance for Nav 
channels. Occupancy of closed or resting channels by toxins was examined using negative 
holding voltages where open probability was low, and the fraction of unbound channels was 
estimated using depolarizations that are too weak to open toxin-bound channels. After 
addition of toxin to the recording chamber, equilibration between toxin and channel was 
monitored using weak depolarizations elicited at 5–10 s intervals. For all channels, voltage–
activation relationships were recorded in the absence and presence of toxin. Off-line data 
analysis was performed using Clampfit 10 (Molecular Devices, USA) and Origin 7.5 
(Originlab, USA).
Multiple protocols were used to probe the biophysical characteristics of the Nav channels 
and chimeras studied. To determine conductance-voltage and steady-state inactivation 
relationships, oocytes expressing Nav channels were held at −90 mV and depolarized in 5 
mV steps from −90 mV to 5 mV for 50 ms, immediately followed by a step to −15 mV to 
elicit the maximum available current and after 50 ms, returned to the −90 mV holding 
potential. Peak current generated during the incremental portion of the protocol was used to 
calculate the conductance-voltage relationship while the peak current during the −15 mV 
step as a function of the earlier voltage step was used to determine the steady-state 
inactivation relationship. The time constant of fast inactivation was determined by fitting 
single exponential curves to the −15 mV step of the aforementioned protocol. Boltzmann 
curves were fitted in Clampfit 10 (Molecular Devices, USA) and statistics calculated with 
Excel or the R statistical package (Student’s t-test).
 Cultured neurons— Whole-cell patch clamp of cultured mouse TG neurons was 
performed as described58. Buffer solution contained (in mM) 150 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 
10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH) and was perfused with or without toxins/drugs using a 
SmartSquirt Micro-Perfusion system (AutoMate). For colonic DRG, whole-cell recordings 
were made from fluorescently labeled thoracolumbar (T10-L1) colonic DRG neurons 20–
48h after plating, using fire-polished glass electrodes with a resistance of 2–5 MΩ. All 
recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22°C). Signals were amplified by using 
an Axopatch 200A amplifier, digitized with a Digidata 1322A and recorded using pCLAMP 
9 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). For all DRG neurons the holding 
potential was −70 mV. In current clamp mode a series of depolarizing pulses (500 ms, 10 pA 
step) were applied from holding potential (−70mV) and the rheobase (amount of current 
(pA) required for action potential generation) determined. The number of action potentials at 
2x rheobase was also determined. Depolarizing pulses were tested in normal external bath 
solution and following the addition of Hm1a (100 nM). Control solutions and Hm1a were 
applied with a gravity driven multi-barrel perfusion system positioned within 1 mm of the 
neuron under investigation. Intracellular solutions contained (mM): 135 KCl; 2 MgCl2; 2

 MgATP; 5 EGTA-Na; 10 HEPES-Na; adjusted to pH 7.4. Extracellular solutions contained 
(mM): 140 NaCl; 4 KCl; 2 MgCl2; 2 CaCl2; 10 HEPES-Na; 5 glucose; adjusted to pH 7.4.
 Skin-nerve recordings— To assess primary afferent activity in response to the Hm1a 
spider toxin, we used the ex vivo skin-nerve preparation, as previously described59. Briefly, 
animals were lightly anesthetized via inhaled isoflurane and then killed via cervical 
dislocation. The hair on the lower extremities was shaved, and the hairy skin of the hindpaw 
was then quickly dissected along with its innervating saphenous nerve. The skin and nerve 
were then placed in a recording chamber filled with warmed (32° C), oxygenated buffer 
consisting of (in mM): 123 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2.0 CaCl2, 1.7 NaH2PO4, 0.7 MgSO4, 9.5 
sodium gluconate, 5.5 glucose, 7.5 sucrose and 10 HEPES titrated to a pH of 7.45 ± 0.05.
The saphenous nerve was then threaded into a mineral oil-filled chamber, teased apart atop 
an elevated mirror plate, and placed on an extracellular recording electrode. Single unit 
receptive fields were then identified via a mechanical search stimulus using a blunt glass 
probe. Aδ afferents were identified based on a conduction velocity between 1.2 and 10 m/s, 
and were subtyped into A-mechanonociceptors (AMs) based on their slow adaptation to a 
mechanical stimulus60.
After locating an AM fiber, to determine the threshold force for action potential generation, 
the receptive field was stimulated with calibrated Von Frey filaments. A metal moat (inner 
diameter: 4.7 mm) was then placed over the center of the receptive field to isolate it from the 
surrounding buffer. Buffer within the moat was then evacuated and replaced with a buffer 
containing either 1 μM Hm1a or vehicle (buffer). Receptive fields were incubated with toxin 
or buffer for 2–5 min. A custom-built, feedback-controlled mechanical stimulator was then 
placed within the moat and the receptive field was mechanically stimulated with a series of 
increasing forces (15 mN, 50 mN and 100 mN) for 10 seconds each. To avoid sensitization/
desensitization, a rest period of 1 min was introduced between stimulations.
Data were digitized using a PowerLab A/D converter and recorded using LabChart software 
and Spike Histogram extension (AD Instruments, USA). All skin-nerve data were recorded 
and analyzed with the experimenter blinded to whether toxin or vehicle was used. 
Recordings were only included in the final data set if the firing of the fiber was clearly 
distinguishable from both background noise and any other fibers firing during stimulation.
 Gut-nerve recordings— Ex vivo single-unit extracellular recordings of action 
potential discharge were made from splanchnic colonic afferents. Recordings were made 
from healthy or CVH mice using standard protocols 61–63. Baseline mechanosensitivity was 
determined in response to application of a 2 g Von Frey hair (vfh) probe to the afferent 
receptive field for 3 seconds. This process was repeated 3–4 times, separated each time by 
10 seconds. Mechanosensitivity was then re-tested after the application of Hm1a (100 nM) 
or the Nav1.1 blocker ICA-121432 (500 nM) or a combination of both ICA-121432 (500 
nM) and Hm1a (100 nM). Instantaneous frequency is defined as the inverse of the time 
interval between an action potential and the previous action potential. After application of 
Hm1a, significant increases (p < 0.05) in mechanically-evoked firing were seen overall in 
both healthy and CVH fibers. However, in both conditions we clearly recorded Hm1a-

 responsive and Hm1a-non-responsive neurons. We therefore binned fibers by responsiveness 
and present these data separately for clarity (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 5). Group data 
are presented as spikes/s and are expressed as mean ± SEM.
 Animal use, husbandry and genotyping
Mice were bred and housed in accordance with UCSF Institutional Animal Care Committee 
(IACUC) guidelines. 2–5 animals were housed together with constant access to food and 
water. Floxed SCN1A mice13 were generously provided by Dr. William Catterall 
(Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington). Floxed mice were bred to 
Peripherin–Cre (Per–Cre) mice37 to produce SCN1AF/F x Per-Cre conditional knockout 
mice. Nav1.1 floxed alleles were detected using primers previously described (Cheah) and 
Per-Cre expression was detected using the following primers to Cre recombinase: Cre_F: 
TAGCGTTCGAACGCACTGATTTCG; Cre_R: CGCCGTAAATCAATCGATGAGTTG.
Somatic behavioral experiments were approved by UCSF IACUC and were in accordance 
with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide of the Care and Use of Laboratory 
Animals and the recommendation of the International Association for the Study of Pain. 
Animals used in skin-nerve recordings were naïve C57bl/6 male mice (n = 10), aged 6–16. 
Mice were housed on a 14:10 light:dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water in a 
climate-controlled room. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Animals used in colonic afferent and 
colonic DRG neuron studies were male C57BL/6J mice. The Animal Ethics Committees of 
The University of Adelaide and the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute 
(SAHMRI) approved experiments involving animals.
 Sensory neuron culture and calcium imaging
Trigeminal ganglia were dissected from newborn (P0–P3) Sprague-Dawley rats or C57BL/6 
mice and cultured for >12 hours before calcium imaging or electrophysiological recording. 
Embryonic DRG cultures were generously provided by Jonah Chan64. Embryonic cultures 
were maintained as described and calcium imaging experiments were performed 1–10d after 
primary cultures were established. Primary cells were plated onto cover slips coated with 
poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and laminin (Invitrogen – 10μg/ml). Cells were loaded for calcium 
imaging with Fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes) for >1 h. Buffer solution – (in mM) 150 NaCl, 
2.8 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH) – was perfused with or without toxins/drugs 
using a SmartSquirt Micro-Perfusion system (AutoMate).
 In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry
In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using the ViewRNA ISH Tissue 2-plex or 1-plex 
Assay Kits (Affymetrix). Target mRNA signals appear as puncta in bright field or 
fluorescent microscopy. Eight to twelve week old mice were deeply anesthetized with 
pentobarbital then transcardially perfused with 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 
followed by 10 ml of 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). DRGs were dissected, post-
fixed in 10% NBF at 4°C O/N, cryoprotected in PBS with 30% w/v sucrose O/N at 4°C, 
then embedded in OCT Compound at −20°C. Tissue was sectioned at 12 μm, thaw-captured

 on Diamond White Glass slides (Globe Scientific), and stored at −20°C until use. Slides 
were used within two weeks of processing to produce optimal signals.
ViewRNA ISH Tissue 2-plex assay was performed with frozen tissue modifications as 
indicated by manufacturer including the endogenous alkaline phosphatase inactivation by 
incubation in H2O with 0.1M HCl and 300 mM NaCl. H&E counterstaining procedure was 
omitted. Images were acquired with a Leica DMRB microscope and DFC500 digital camera 
using Leica Application Suite v3.5.0 then further analyzed using ImageJ software.
To co-label neuronal subpopulations markers (NF200, IB4, CGRP, TH) and Nav1.1 mRNA, 
ViewRNA ISH Tissue 1-plex Assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed 
sequentially using a protocol modified from Ref. 65. ISH/IHC was not found to be 
compatible with all primary antibodies. Animals, tissue, and slides were prepared as 
described in the preceding paragraph. Frozen slides with tissue sections were warmed in a 
vacuum oven for 10 min at 60°C, fixed in PBS with 4% v/v formaldehyde for 10 min at 
room temperature (RT) then processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol with frozen 
tissue modifications in a ThermoBrite Slide Processing System (Abbott Molecular). 
Washing steps were performed as indicated, in a deliberate and vigorous manner. Optimal 
protease and probe incubation times were determined to be 12 min and 2 h, respectively. 
Following development in Fast Red Substrate, slides were rinsed briefly in PBS then 
immediately processed for IHC. Slides were incubated for 1 h at RT in a blocking solution 
consisting of PBS with 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 10% normal goat serum (NGS). 
Slides were then incubated in primary antibody solution (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 
2.5% NGS) overnight at 4°C, vigorously agitated for 2 min in fresh PBS 3X, then incubated 
in secondary antibody solution (PBS with 0.1% v/v Triton X-100) for 2 h at RT in the dark. 
Sections were then washed by vigorous agitation for 2 min in fresh PBS 3X prior to 
mounting with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies) and 
coverslipping. Images were acquired with a Leica DMRB microscope and DFC500 digital 
camera using Leica Application Suite v3.5.0 then further analyzed using ImageJ software.
Affymetrix was commissioned to design a Type 1 probe set to mouse Nav1.1 (SCN1A, 
NM_018733.2) and Type 6 probe sets to mouse TRPV1 (TRPV1, NM_001001445.2), 
mouse Nav1.7 (SCN9A, NM_001290674.1), mouse 5HT3 (HTR3A, NM_001099644.1), and 
mouse TRPM8 (TRPM8, NM_134252.3) coding regions. We used the following primary 
antibodies: mouse anti-NF200 (1:10,000, Sigma), rabbit anti-CGRP (1:10,000, Peninsula 
Labs), and rabbit anti-TH (1:5,000, AbCam). We used fluorophore-conjugated secondary 
antibodies raised in goat against mouse or rabbit, as appropriate (1:1,000, Alexa Fluor 488, 
Life Technologies). To identify IB4-binding cells, biotinylated IB4 (1:1,000, Vector Labs) 
and fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin (1:1,000, Alexa Fluor 488, Life Technologies) were 
used in place of primary and secondary antibodies. Fos staining was performed 90 min after 
hindpaw injection of Hm1a or PBS. Spinal cord sections were prepared from lumbar L4/L5 
and stained with rabbit anti-Fos (1:5,000, CalBiochem). ATF3 antibody (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology) was used at 1:2000.

  Statistics and experimental design
Sample sizes for cellular physiology, histology and animal behavior were chosen based on 
previous experience with these assays as the minimum number of independent observation 
required for statistically significant results. For histology, at least three sections from each of 
at least three animals were counted. For oocyte and mouse neuron experiments, multiple 
batches/litters were used for all experiments. For behavioral experiments, animals were 
randomly chosen for different experimental cohorts by a blinded experimenter. Experimental 
and control conditions were compared within the same experimental time-course using 
randomly selected animals from one or multiple cages. Responses were then scored by an 
experimenter blinded to injection condition and experimental cohort. Animal genotype was 
tracked by ear tags and genotype unblinding occurred after analysis was complete.
Data were analyzed using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and 
significance testing used either Student’s t-tests or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
followed by Bonferroni or Tukey’s post-hoc tests, as noted in figure legends. All 
significance tests are two-sided. Significance levels are *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, 
and ****p < 0.0001. The number of experiments (n) and significance are reported in the 
figure legends. All significance tests were justified as appropriate given the experimental 
design and nature of the comparisons. We assume equal variance and normally distributed 
data within experimental paradigms where comparisons are made. These are common 
assumptions relied upon for significance testing within these experimental paradigms as 
previously published by our group and others.
 Behavior
For behavioral experiments in Fig. 4, adult mice (6–12 weeks) were used. Male and female 
mice were first considered separately in hindpaw nocifensive response experiments. Both 
sexes showed significantly greater responses to toxin in WT littermate versus Nav1.1F/F x 
Per-Cre CKO mice (one-sided unpaired Student’s t test, p < 0.05, WT female: n = 5, CKO 
female: n = 6, WT male: n = 5, CKO male: n = 5). Therefore, male and female behavioral 
responses were pooled and subsequent experiments were performed on both male and 
female mice for CKO and WT littermate experiments, or only male mice for other 
conditions (e.g. Cap ablation). Nocifensive responses were recorded during a 20 min 
observation period immediately following intraplantar injections (10 μl PBS with or without 
5 μM Hm1a). Licking/biting behavior was scored as seconds of behavior with the 
experimenter blinded to injection condition and experimental cohort (WT, CKO or Cap 
Ablated mice). Hargreaves and Von Frey tests were performed 30 min after intraplantar 
injection of 500 nM Hm1a or Hm1b to measure heat or mechanical sensitivity, respectively. 
Intrathecal (i.t.) cap ablation was performed as previously described34, and i.t. cap treated 
mice were tested on a hot plate to ensure ablation of TRPV1+ afferents. Ablation was also 
confirmed by histology.
 Model of chronic visceral hypersensitivity
Colitis was induced by administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) as 
described previously62,63. Briefly, 13 week old anaesthetized mice were administered an 
intra-colonic enema of 0.1 mL TNBS (130 μg/mL in 30% ethanol) via a polyethylene

 catheter62,63,66. Histological examination of mucosal architecture, cellular infiltrate, crypt 
abscesses, and goblet cell depletion confirmed significant TNBS-induced damage by day 3 
post-treatment, which largely recovered by day 7, and fully recovered by 28 days. High-
threshold nociceptors from mice at the 28-day time point displayed significant mechanical 
hypersensitivity, lower mechanical activation thresholds, and hyperalgesia and allodynia67. 
As such, they are termed ‘chronic visceral hypersensitivity’ (CVH) mice62,63,66,68.
 Retrograde tracing and cell culture of colonic DRG neurons
Healthy and CVH mice of 16 weeks of age were anesthetized with halothane and following 
midline laparotomy, three 10 μL injections of the fluorescent retrograde neuronal tracer 
cholera toxin subunit B conjugated to AlexaFluor-488 were made sub-serosally within the 
wall of the descending colon. Four days after injection mice were sacrificed by CO2 
inhalation and DRGs from T10–L1 were surgically removed. DRGs were digested with 4 
mg/mL collagenase II (GIBCO, Invitrogen) and 4 mg/mL dispase (GIBCO) for 30 min at 
37°C, followed by 4 mg/mL collagenase II for 10 min at 37°C. Neurons were mechanically 
dissociated into a single-cell suspension via trituration through fire-polished Pasteur 
pipettes. Neurons were resuspended in DMEM (GIBCO) containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen), 
2 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO), 100 μM MEM non-essential amino acids (GIBCO) and 100 
mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Neurons were spot-plated on 8 mm HCl treated 
coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine (800 μg/ml) and laminin (20 μg/ml) and maintained in 
an incubator at 37°C in 5% CO2.

untreated controls (black). Filled circles denote G-V relationships, where oocytes were 
depolarized for 50 ms in 5mV steps from a holding potential of −90mV. Open circles denote 
steady-state inactivation (I/Imax) relationships, where oocytes were depolarized from 
−90mV to +5mV in 5mV increments for 50 ms preceeding a 50 ms step to −15mV. (Middle) 
Dot plot detailing percent increase in peak conductance of each point mutant in response to 
100 nM Hm1a treatment. Each point represents a single oocyte; red bars indicate 95% 
confidence interval. Mutations highlighted in orange (D1376T and Y1379S) are statistically 
different from S3b-S4/S5-S6 control (*p < 0.01). The Q1372E mutant did not generate 
currents. (Bottom) Alignment of DIV S1-S4 regions from relevant mouse and human Nav 
isoforms. Orange highlights location of residues in the S1-S2 loop that putatively contribute 
to the toxin effect. d, (Left) Stylized DIV with transmembrane segments represented as 
circles and extracellular loops as bars (black for native rNav1.4 channel and green for 
portions transplanted from hNav1.1). (Middle) Traces displaying effect of Hm1a on each 
chimera depolarized to −15 mV from a holding potential of −90 mV. (Right) Conductance-
voltage (G/Gmax) and steady-state inactivation (I/Imax) relationships of each channel and 
chimera before and after toxin (black and red, respectively) across a voltage range spanning 
−90 mV to 0 mV from a holding potential of −90 mV in 5 mV increments. Scale bars as in 
Fig. 2. e, Dot plots displaying the effect of 100 nM Hm1a on peak current (left) and 
persistent current (right). Data in the left plot were generated by dividing peak conductance 
after Hm1a application by the peak conductance before. Right plot shows persistent current 
divided by peak current before (black) or after (red) toxin addition. Persistent current was 
determined by averaging current from the final millisecond of depolarization to 0 mV from a 
holding potential of −90 mV. Vertical bars indicate 95% confidence interval.

 Figure 1. Hm1a selectively targets Nav1.1 in sensory neurons
a, Togo Starburst tarantula, H. maculata (image courtesy of B. Rast, ArachnoServer 50). b, 
Average ratiometric calcium responses from Hm1a (500nM)-sensitive embryonic rat DRG 
neurons with or without TTX (500 nM). Note persistence of toxin responses in the absence 
of TTX (top images). c, Representative whole-cell patch clamp recording from Hm1a-
sensitive P0 mouse TG neuron. All (15/15) Hm1a responsive neurons displayed similar 
effect of toxin on sodium current inactivation. Currents elicited during repeated steps to −30 
mV (Vh = −90 mV, scale bar = 1nA, 5ms). d, (Left) Average Hm1a-evoked calcium 
response in the presence of ICA-121431 (500nM) and after washout (n = 11; responses to 
Hm1a alone are shown in grey). (Right) Quantification of maximum Hm1a-evoked 
responses with or without ICA-121431 (n = 25). e, Currents from oocytes expressing hNav 
channels in the absence (black) or presence (red, 100nM) of Hm1a elicited by repeated 
pulses (0.2–1Hz) to −30mV (Nav1.1–1.7) or 0 mV (Nav1.8) for 100ms (Vh = −90mV). Scale

neuron in the absence (black) or presence (red) of Hm1a (500nM). (Bottom) Quantification 
of action potentials (APs) elicited by a 1s, 20pA current injection before or after exposure to 
Hm1a (500nM, n = 4) with representative APs shown at right. Average AP width increased 
in the presence of Hm1a by 28.3% ± 8.4% (p < 0.05, n = 4). *p < 0.05 and ***p < 0.001, 
Student’s t-test. Error bars represent mean ± SEM.

 Figure 2. Hm1a targets S3b-S4 and S1-S2 loops in DIV to inhibit fast inactivation
a, Representative traces from oocytes expressing hNav1.1 without (black) or with (red) 
Hm1a (100nM). Single exponential fits to inactivation time course (broken lines) and tau 
values (right) show toxin-induced slowing (**p < 0.01 at each voltage, 2-way ANOVA with 
post-hoc Tukey’s). b, Kv2.1 (far left) and chimeras containing S3b-S4 motif from each 
hNav1.1 domain repeat (DI-DIV, as indicated) were tested for sensitivity to Hm1a (100nM). 
Currents are shown during 50ms depolarization to −30mV. Scale bar = 200nA; 10ms. c, 
rNav1.4, hNav1.1 and chimeric channels containing S1-S2, S3b-S4, and/or S5-S6 were 
tested for Hm1a sensitivity. See Extended Data Figure 2 for quantitation and details of 
chimera design.

 Figure 3. Nav1.1 is expressed by myelinated, non-C fiber neurons in sensory ganglia
a, Representative DRG sections showing immunoreactivity for neurofilament 200 (NF200), 
binding of isolectin B4 (IB4), and in situ histochemistry for TRPV1, Nav1.7, or Nav1.1 
transcripts, as indicated. Arrows and asterisks indicate cells with overlapping and non-
overlapping signals, respectively. b, Size distribution for all DRG neurons (grey bars, 514 
cells counted) or Nav1.1-expressing cells (black bars, 324 cells counted). c, Quantification of 
overlap between histological markers (≥164 cells counted for each condition; 9–12 
independent sections from ≥3 mice). d, Representative traces from AM fibers recorded in 
skin-nerve preparation show increased firing following application of Hm1a (1μM) with 
quantification at right. Hm1a significantly increased firing during all forces tested, achieving 
statistical significance at 50 and 100mN (*** p < 0.001 with 2-way ANOVA, # p < 0.05 with 
Bonferonni post-hoc, n = 23, 23 and 18 fibers for vehicle and 13, 13 and 10 fibers for Hm1a 
at 15, 50 and 100 mN forces, respectively).

 Figure 4. Hm1a elicits non-inflammatory pain and bilateral mechanical allodynia
a, Comparison of licking/biting behavior following intraplantar injection (10μl) of vehicle 
(PBS) (n = 6) versus Hm1a (5μM) (n = 10, **p < 0.01). Behavior was unaffected by ablation 
of TRPV1 fibers (V1abl, n = 5) but significantly reduced in peripherin-Cre x Floxed-Nav1.1 
(CKO) mice (*p < 0.05, n = 11). b, (Top) Representative histological sections and 
quantification of c-Fos immunoreactivity in spinal cord dorsal horn following intraplantar 
vehicle or Hm1a (5 μM) injection (n = 27 sections from 3 mice, ***p < 0.001). c, Capsaicin- 
or Hm1a-injected paws (right) next to uninjected contralateral controls (left). (Top right) 
Relative thickness of injected versus uninjected paws. (Bottom right) Evans blue dye (EBD) 
extravasation following capsaicin or Hm1a injection (*p < 0.05). (d) Latency of paw 
withdrawal from noxious heat stimulus measured after intraplantar injection of vehicle or 
Hm1a (500nM). e, Mechanical response thresholds measured in paws ipsilateral (light grey) 
or contralateral (dark grey) to vehicle or toxin (500nM) injection (n = 5 for WT Veh, V1abl 
Hm1a and WT Hm1b; n = 7 for WT Hm1a; n = 9 for CKO Hm1a; **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, 
****p < 0.0001). f, Mechanically-evoked currents were observed from all adult mouse DRG 
neurons exhibiting sensitivity to Hm1a but not capsaicin (bottom), and not from those 
sensitive to both (top) (stimulus range from 1–9 micron displacement). Kinetic properties of 
mechanically-evoked currents in Hm1a responders were variable. Error bars represent mean 
± SEM. P values based on unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test (panels b and c) or one-way 
ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey’s test (panels a, d and e).

 Figure 5. Colonic afferents display increased sensitivity to Hm1a in a model of IBS
a, (Left) Representative ex vivo single fiber recording from an Hm1a (100nM)-responsive 
high-threshold mechanoreceptive fiber from a healthy control mouse (arrows indicate 
application and removal of 2g Von Frey hair stimulus). (Middle) Group data from Hm1a-
sensitive fibers (6/15, defined as ≥15% increase over baseline; **p < 0.01; see Extended 
Data Fig. 5 for examples and group data from Hm1a-nonresponsive fibers. (Right) Group 
data from a population (5/10) of ICA-121432 (500nM)-sensitive afferents (****p < 0.0001). 
b, (Left) Representative whole–cell current clamp recording of a retrogradely traced colonic 
DRG neuron in response to 500ms current injection at rheobase (the minimum current 
injection required to elicit action potential firing). Recordings were from the same neuron of 
a healthy control mouse before and after incubation with Hm1a (10nM). Scale bars = 250 
ms, 20 mV. (Middle) Group data show significant reduction in rheobase following Hm1a 
application in a sub-population (5/11) of neurons (*p < 0.05). Hm1a-responsive neuron 
defined as exhibiting ≥10% change in rheobase from baseline control. (Right) Hm1a 
increased the number of action potentials observed at 2x rheobase in these neurons, but not 
to a level that reached statistical significance. c, (Left) Responses from high-threshold 
colonic fibers from CVH mice before and after application of Hm1a (100nM). (Middle)

ICA-121432-sensitive fibers (7/10, **p < 0.01). d, (Left) Representative Hm1a-responsive 
colonic DRG neuron in whole-cell current clamp. Addition of Hm1a reduced rheobase (top 
traces) and increased action potential firing at 2x rheobase (bottom traces). (Middle and 
right) Group data from Hm1a-responsive CVH neurons (7/11) showing toxin-mediated 
decrease in rheobase (middle, ***p < 0.001) or increase in action potential firing at 2x 
rheobase (right, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
