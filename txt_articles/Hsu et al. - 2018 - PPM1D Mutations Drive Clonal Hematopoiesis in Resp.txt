In Brief
Cytotoxic chemotherapies put patients at
risk for future hematopoietic
malignancies. Goodell and colleagues
show that PPM1D mutations confer a
survival advantage onto hematopoietic
clones by rendering them resistant to
DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin.
Selective pressures will be specific to
different mutations and should be
considered in choice of chemotherapy.

SUMMARY
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), in which stem cell clones
dominate blood production, becomes increasingly
common with age and can presage malignancy
development. The conditions that promote ascen-
dancy of particular clones are unclear. We found
that mutations in PPM1D (protein phosphatase
Mn2+/Mg2+-dependent 1D), a DNA damage response
regulator that is frequently mutated in CH, were pre-
sent in one-fifth of patients with therapy-related
acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syn-
drome and strongly correlated with cisplatin expo-
sure. Cell lines with hyperactive PPM1D mutations
expand to outcompete normal cells after exposure
to
cytotoxic
DNA
damaging
agents
including
cisplatin, and this effect was predominantly medi-
ated by increased resistance to apoptosis. More-
over, heterozygous mutant Ppm1d hematopoietic
cells
outcompeted
their
wild-type
counterparts
in vivo after exposure to cisplatin and doxorubicin,
but not during recovery from bone marrow transplan-
tation. These findings establish the clinical relevance
of PPM1D mutations in CH and the importance of
studying mutation-treatment interactions.
INTRODUCTION
One of the most serious risks of cytotoxic chemotherapies for
cancer is the development of secondary, hematopoietic malig-
nancies some years in the future. In theory, chemotherapy and
radiation might directly inflict the DNA damage that, when inap-
propriately repaired, produces the subsequent cancer-driving
mutation. It is also possible, however, that cancer therapies
might exert selective pressures on hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) such that certain mutant populations (known as clones)
have a selective advantage under cytotoxic conditions. If the
mutant clones survive longer, they may accumulate more muta-
tions with time. This could be why the expansion of mutant
clones, known as clonal hematopoiesis (CH), is associated with
an increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies
(Genovese et al., 2014; Jaiswal et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2014):
certain mutant clones could serve as premalignant cells with
some sort of growth advantage, which then acquire cancer-
driving mutations. This is a compelling model. Indeed, deep
sequencing before and after chemotherapy has shown that
TP53 mutant cells can pre-exist at low frequencies in the bone
marrow prior to chemotherapy and then rise in proportional
contribution afterward, likely due to a selective advantage
(Wong et al., 2015). Yet, not all CH mutations detected in the
blood prior to therapy subsequently evolve into a malignant clone
(Berger et al., 2018; Gillis et al., 2017; Takahashi et al., 2017). In
fact, CH can be detected in 95% of healthy adults (Young et al.,
2016), yet most expanded clones do not evolve into leukemia (re-
viewed in Bowman et al., 2018). At this point, the nature of the as-
sociation between CH and malignancy is not clear.
CH has recently been associated with mutations in PPM1D
(protein phosphatase Mn2+/Mg2+-dependent 1D), which is part
of the DNA damage response pathway. PPM1D is part of a
regulatory feedback loop with p53: activated p53 induces
expression of PPM1D, which then both directly and indirectly de-
phosphorylates p53, leading to downregulation of p53-mediated
apoptosis (Dudgeon et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2008). PPM1D has
been found to be amplified and overexpressed in a significant
fraction of medulloblastoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer
(Castellino et al., 2008; Lambros et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2009).
Interestingly, truncated forms—the same mutations identified

 in CH—have been identified in various cancers (The Cancer
Genome Atlas Research, 2014; Kleiblova et al., 2013; Zajkowicz
et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014), and these mutations have been
observed in patients previously exposed to chemotherapy for
solid tumors (Coombs et al., 2017; Gibson et al., 2017; Pharoah
et al., 2016; Swisher et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2018). Mutations in
PPM1D are typically nonsense or frameshift mutations in the
sixth exon, which produce a C-terminal truncated protein. Only
recently have PPM1D mutations been noted in patients with
hematologic conditions, specifically therapy-related myelodys-
plastic syndrome (Lindsley et al., 2017). These findings promp-
ted us to explore the relationship between PPM1D, CH, and
hematologic malignancies.
Given that PPM1D mutations have been associated with CH in
patients with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy (Coombs et al.,
2017; Wong et al., 2018), we began our investigation with the
therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) and therapy-
related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) that arise in some
individuals years after chemotherapy for solid tumors or non-
myeloid hematologic malignancies.
RESULTS
PPM1D Mutations Are Relatively Common in Therapy-
Related AML and MDS
We performed targeted-capture sequencing of 295 cancer genes
combined with amplicon sequencing on diagnostic bone marrow
samples from 156 patients with t-MDS (n = 79) or t-AML (n = 77)

(A) The twenty most frequently mutated genes de-
tected by targeted gene sequencing in the t-AML/
t-MDS study cohort (n = 156) are shown. The red
bars represent the mutation frequency in the t-MN
(t-AML/t-MDS) cohort and the blue bars represent
the mutation frequency in a matched de novo MN
(AML/MDS) control cohort (n = 228).

compared to de novo AML/MDS. The horizontal
dotted line corresponds to a p value of 0.05.
(C) Pairwise association plot of overall mutation co-
occurrence or mutual exclusivity, adjusted for
multiple comparisons. Blue represents a negative
association (mutual exclusivity) while red repre-
sents a positive association (co-occurrence). The
magnitude of association is represented by both
the size of the square and color gradient, which
corresponds to a range of log odds ratio values.
The statistical significance of associations is rep-
resented by the false discovery rate (FDR). The
asterisks indicate the level of significance (FDR 0.1,
0.5, and 0.01). ‘‘PPM1D clonal’’ refers to the subset
of PPM1D mutated cases with VAF > 0.2.

(Table S1). PPM1D mutations were found
in 20% of these cases (31/156) and at
similar
frequencies
in
both
groups
(t-AML: 15/77, 19.5%; t-MDS 16/79, 20.2%). Only TP53 muta-
tions appeared more frequently (45/156, 28.8%). In contrast,
PPM1D was mutated in only 1 out of 228 patients in a matched
de novo AML/MDS cohort (AML n = 121 and MDS n = 107, Table
S2), confirming that PPM1D mutations are enriched in t-AML/
t-MDS arising from prior therapy (odds ratio, 56; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 7.6–417.3; p = 0.0001) (Figures 1A and 1B).
Unlike TP53, PPM1D was not significantly associated with
complex cytogenetics or deletions in chromosomes 5 or 7 (Fig-
ure 1C) (Christiansen et al., 2001; Godley and Larson, 2008;
Lindsley et al., 2017). While the cohort had typical t-AML/
t-MDS-associated genetic alterations, we did not observe signif-
icant co-mutation or mutual exclusivity of PPM1D with other
genes nor impact on overall survival (Figures 1C, S1A, and
S1B). Notably, PPM1D was the sole detected somatic mutation
from the panel in seven of the 31 cases, two of which had no
detectable co-occurring chromosomal alterations (Figure 1D).
PPM1D exon 6 mutations in our t-AML/t-MDS cohort were all
truncating mutations with no particular hotspot, consistent with
the distribution of exon 6 mutations found in CH and solid tumors
(Figure 2A) (Dudgeon et al., 2013; Genovese et al., 2014; Ruark
et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2009). The variant allele frequency (VAF)
of these mutations ranged from 0.02 to 0.47, with a mean of
0.11 and median of 0.05 (Figure 2B). In three patients with
PPM1D mutations for whom different lineage fractions were
available, we detected the mutation in both lymphoid (CD3+
CD19+) and non-lymphoid (CD3� CD19�) fractions, consistent
with an HSC or progenitor origin for the PPM1D mutation

 (Figure 2C). We next established a patient-derived xenograft
(PDX) model using one of the PPM1D mutated t-AML samples
and observed that the engrafted leukemic cells indeed carried
a clonal PPM1D mutation (VAF >0.4). This provides evidence
that at least in select cases, PPM1D mutant cells can constitute
a significant portion of the leukemic clone (Figure S1C).
We also screened for copy number alterations in PPM1D with
a genome-wide SNP array in the same t-AML/t-MDS cohort
(n = 120, as DNA was insufficient for 36 patients). We found
two cases (1.7%) with PPM1D copy number gain (both t-AML,
Figure 2D) and no co-occurring PPM1D mutations. Copy number
gain of PPM1D was also found in 2.4% of de novo AML cases
analyzed as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project
(TCGA, 2013), (four out of 162 cases, Figure 2E). PPM1D copy
number gain thus appears to be rare but detectable in both ther-
apy-related and de novo AML/MDS and should be screened for
along with PPM1D mutations to fully characterize PPM1D alter-
ations in hematologic malignancies.
PPM1D Mutations Are Associated with Prior Exposure to
Specific DNA-Damaging Agents
To determine whether specific conditions are associated with
expansion of PPM1D mutant clones, we reviewed clinical charts
for patient exposures (available for 140 of the 156 patients; 25
PPM1D and 115 non-PPM1D mutated cases). We identified a
significant association between prior exposure to platinum
agents (cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin) and PPM1D-
mutated t-AML/t-MDS (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2–7.1;
p = 0.004; false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.056). PPM1D mutations
were also associated with prior exposure to the topoisomerase
inhibitor,
etoposide
(odds
ratio,
2.98;
95%
CI,
1.2–7.6;
p = 0.02; FDR = 0.148) (Figure 2F). There was no association be-
tween PPM1D mutations and prior radiation therapy or smoking
(p = 0.223 and 0.128, respectively), the latter of which is consis-
tent with prior observations (Coombs et al., 2017). We also found
no significant association between PPM1D mutations and the
nature of the primary malignancy (Table S3).
To explore how platinum agents might confer selective advan-
tage on PPM1D mutant cells, we generated isogenic PPM1D
mutant and wild-type (WT) human cell lines using CRISPR-
Cas9 in both MOLM13 and HEK293 cells (Figures S2A and
S2E). We first needed to confirm that cisplatin treatment would
activate the DNA damage response and induce PPM1D protein
expression in our cell lines, because cisplatin interferes with
DNA replication via DNA adduct formation. In unedited cells,
PPM1D
levels
increased,
along
with
phospho-p53
and
g-H2AX. In the PPM1D mutant cells, PPM1D increased by 16-
fold even in the absence of DNA damage (Figure S2B), strongly
suppressing phospho-p53 and g-H2AX (Figure 3A). As ex-
pected, the elevated protein levels reflect the increased stability
of the truncated protein, rather than changes in the intrinsic
phosphatase activity of PPM1D, as demonstrated by treatment
with proteasome inhibitors and an in vitro phosphatase assay
(Figures S2C and S2D) (Kleiblova et al., 2013).
We next performed dose-response experiments with our
isogenic PPM1D WT and mutant cell lines, testing their relative
survival following exposure to cisplatin and other chemothera-
peutic agents. We performed these experiments with CRISPR-
generated isogenic clones derived from three different leukemic
cell lines (MOLM13, OCI-AML2, and OCI-AML3), with technical
triplicates for each. The PPM1D truncating mutation conferred
significant chemoresistance to cisplatin (p < 0.0001) (Fig-
ure 3B). We then tested whether a specific PPM1D inhibitor,
GSK2830371, which targets both the phosphatase activity and
degradation of PPM1D (Gilmartin et al., 2014), could render the
cells more sensitive to cisplatin. PPM1D mutant cells were
more sensitive to GSK2830371 than WT cells, and combination
treatment with cisplatin and GSK2830371 sensitized the mutants
to cisplatin (Figure 3B).
PPM1D Mutations Confer Resistance to Apoptosis
To better understand the relative fitness conferred by PPM1D
mutation, we studied mixed populations of cells in culture at a ra-
tio of 80:20 (GFP-positive WT to GFP-negative mutant PPM1D
cells). We tracked population growth by flow cytometry, with
and without continuous cisplatin treatment (Figures 3C and
S3A–S3C). In the absence of cisplatin, the mutant cells exhibited
a minor growth advantage. With cisplatin, however, the mutant
cells expanded from 20% to over 80% of the population over
15 days. Concurrent administration of cisplatin and the PPM1D
inhibitor GSK2830371 attenuated the growth of the PPM1D mu-
tants, confirming that high expression of PPM1D confers the se-
lective advantage (Figure 3D). An independent experiment
revealed similar findings (Figure S3B), as did an additional exper-
iment with reciprocally labeled cells (GFP-positive mutant
PPM1D cells mixed with GFP-negative WT cells), which we per-
formed to confirm that the advantage of the mutants was not due
to silencing of the GFP transgene. Consistent with earlier find-
ings, GFP-positive PPM1D mutants expanded from 10% to
45% over 15 days of cisplatin treatment (Figure S3C). Together,
these findings clearly demonstrate that PPM1D mutations confer
a selective advantage in the context of cisplatin.
Selection for the mutant cells could occur via multiple cellular
mechanisms. Given that PPM1D mutants strongly suppress
p53, we hypothesized that the mutant cells would be resistant
to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. This appeared to be the case:
following one dose of cisplatin, we observed 49% apoptotic
mutant cells compared to 65% apoptotic WT cells. The PPM1D
inhibitor GSK2830371 restored normal levels of apoptosis to
the mutant cells (Figures 3E and S4A).
An altered proliferation rate by PPM1D mutant cells could
also contribute to a fitness advantage. To examine this possi-
bility, we performed bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cell-cycle anal-
ysis in isogenic WT and PPM1D mutant cells (MOLM13) at
baseline and after 24 hr of 750 nM cisplatin treatment. The re-
sults showed that prior to cisplatin treatment, there were no dif-
ferences between WT and mutant cells (Figures 3F and S4B).
Importantly, cisplatin treatment induced cell-cycle arrest in
both mutant and WT cells, as evidenced by accumulation of
cells in S phase and G2/M phase. However, the proportions
of cells in these phases were not different between PPM1D mu-
tants and WT cells, indicating that they were similarly arrested
with no significant proliferation differences. While we cannot
exclude some advantage contributed by proliferation differ-
ences that could be revealed under different conditions, our
data strongly suggest that resistance to apoptosis is likely the
primary contributor to the competitive outgrowth of PPM1D
mutants.

 PPM1D Mutations Confer Chemoresistance to Specific
Agents
To extend the characterization of PPM1D mutant chemoresist-
ance, we first assessed the relative sensitivity of PPM1D mutant
and WT cells to additional chemotherapeutics with distinct
mechanisms of action. We performed dose-response assays in
isogenic PPM1D WT and mutant lines across three different
leukemic cell lines. Compared to WT cells, PPM1D mutants
showed greater resistance to doxorubicin and etoposide, the
latter of which is consistent with the clinical findings mentioned
above (Figure 4). In contrast, PPM1D mutants showed no signif-
icant differences in sensitivity to vincristine or to 5-FU relative to
WT cells.
To determine whether the drug sensitivity profiles translated
to a competitive advantage, we modeled cell competition
in vitro with PPM1D mutant (GFP–) and WT (GFP+) MOLM13
cells, with multiple chemotherapy exposures over 14 days, de-
signed to mimic treatment cycles received by patients. In the
context of doxorubicin and etoposide, GFP– cells went from
an average proportion below 20% to around 80% over the
treatment period, while vincristine provided no selective advan-
tage (Figure 5). These data clearly indicate that PPM1D mu-
tants are positively selected with some, but not all classes of
agents.
PPM1D Mutations Confer a Selective Advantage In Vivo
under Cisplatin Exposure
To examine the effect of truncated PPM1D on hematopoiesis
and the variables that drive PPM1D-mutant clonal expansion
in vivo, we generated a mouse model with a Ppm1d truncation
at R451 (R451X), which is equivalent to the R458X human
PPM1D mutation commonly found in CH (Genovese et al.,
2014) (Figures 6A and S5A). The heterozygous Ppm1d R451X
mice (Ppm1dm/+) were viable and fertile, with no apparent
phenotypic abnormalities. We generated primary mouse embry-
onic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Ppm1d mutant and WT littermates
and confirmed abundant truncated protein and dephosphory-
lated p53 even in the absence of DNA damage (Figure S5B).
R451X mutant MEFs also demonstrated resistance to apoptosis
upon cisplatin treatment (Figure S5C). Because PPM1D muta-
tions are consistently found in a heterozygous state in both CH
and t-AML/MDS patients, we used the heterozygous mice for
downstream hematopoietic studies.
Previous work suggests that PPM1D mutations arise in he-
matopoietic stem cells rather than later myeloid and lymphoid
cells (Wong et al., 2018), so we began by analyzing the lineage
composition of the peripheral blood in 8-week-old Ppm1d
mutant and WT mice. There were no appreciable differences in
proportions of long-term or short-term HSCs, multipotent pro-
genitors, megakaryocyte erythrocyte progenitors, or common
myeloid progenitors (Figures 5B and S6A–S6C).
To better understand the parameters of PPM1D mutant cell
fitness, we performed whole bone marrow transplantation with
the donor marrow consisting of 20% Ppm1dm/+ (mutant) or
20% Ppm1d+/+ (control) cells mixed with 80% WT cells (n = 8
per group) (Figure 6C), using CD45 allelic differences to track
the test and WT cell populations. Following engraftment at
4 weeks, cisplatin was administered over 5 cycles via weekly
intraperitoneal injection to mimic the cycles of chemotherapy
received by patients for their primary cancers. When control cells
were mixed with WT cells in a 20/80 ratio and exposed to
cisplatin, we observed minimal changes in peripheral blood
chimerism over time (Figure 6D). In contrast, when 20%
Ppm1d R451X cells were mixed with 80% WT cells, the mutants
outgrew the WT cells as early as 1 week after the first cisplatin
injection. Even after cisplatin treatment was stopped 8 weeks
post-transplantation, the mutant cells continued to outgrow the
WT, from an average blood contribution of 13.9% (range of
8.2%–20.4%) at 4 weeks to an average of 42% (range of
31.0%–59.8%) at 13 weeks (Figures 6D and S7A). (Even though
the bone marrow transplant contained 20% mutant cells, appar-
ently fewer than 20% of the mutant progenitors/HSCs success-
fully engrafted in the recipient mice. Thus, their initial contribution
measured at 4 weeks is <20%.) Analysis of the bone marrow of
recipients 16 weeks after transplantation revealed that the
contribution of Ppm1d-mutant cells increased at every level of
the hematopoietic hierarchy, from long-term (LT-) HSCs to
mature cells, following cisplatin treatment (Figure 6E). We vali-
dated these results in a repeat transplant (n = 15), after which
we observed two waves of Ppm1d mutant expansion spaced
by 8 weeks (Figure S7B). These waves suggest an immediate
survival advantage for mature Ppm1d mutant blood cells fol-
lowed by the emergence of differentiated progeny derived
from mutant stem and progenitor cells that were selected for
during cisplatin treatment.
As our in vitro data suggested that PPM1D mutations confer
an advantage in the context of some drugs, but not others, we
further examined the competitive cellular dynamics with addi-
tional agents in our mouse model. Utilizing the same strategy
described above (20% Ppm1d mutant or WT cells mixed with
80% WT cell in a bone marrow transplant), we treated mice
with doxorubicin or vincristine following previously published
treatment regimens for mice (Chao et al., 2015; Zuber et al.,
2009) starting 8 weeks after transplant. Over three rounds of
doxorubicin administration (n = 8 per group), we observed a sig-
nificant difference in average Ppm1d mutant chimerism at the
final time point, compared to that of WT cells in the control trans-
plant (36.5% versus 16.0%, respectively, p = 0.005). In contrast,

Various classes of chemotherapy agents were screened in the isogenic CRISPR-generated WT and PPM1D mutant cell lines (MOLM13, OCI-AML2, and OCI-
AML3). The chemotherapy agents selected include key agents utilized in the treatment of primary tumors that t-AML/t-MDS patients in our cohort were previously
exposed to. Dose response curves are shown, with red representing PPM1D mutants and gray representing WT. The data points represent mean ± SD of

 after eight weekly administrations of vincristine (n = 5 per group),
Ppm1d mutant chimerism was not significantly different from
that of WT cells (15.4% versus 20.5%, respectively, p = 0.37)
(Figure S7C). Together, these data establish that Ppm1d muta-
tions confer a selective advantage on hematopoietic cells in vivo
in the context of some chemotherapeutic agents but not others.
Not All Stressors Favor Expansion of PPM1D Mutant
Clones
To determine whether Ppm1d mutant clones resist cellular stress
in general, we tested their response to the severe stress of serial
bone marrow transplantation, which requires multiple rounds of
rapid HSC expansion (Sun et al., 2014). We established a trans-
plant cohort with donor whole marrow consisting of 20%
Ppm1d-mutant or control cells mixed with 80% WT cells, and
monitored peripheral blood chimerism longitudinally following
transplant, in the absence of chemotherapy. There was no signif-
icant expansion of either the control cells or Ppm1d mutant cells
over 13 weeks, as determined from the peripheral blood chime-
rism (Figures 7A and S7A). We then performed serial transplan-
tation with whole bone marrow from the primary transplanted
mice (n = 8 recipients for each group, 3 3 106 whole bone
marrow cells transplanted into each recipient mouse) (Figure 7B).
Ppm1d mutant cells engrafted and reconstituted the peripheral
blood less effectively than WT cells, as reflected in their chime-
rism at 5 weeks and 14 weeks after serial transplantation (Fig-
ure 7C). At 20 weeks, the average LT-HSC chimerism was lower
with Ppm1d mutants than with WT (2.5% versus 15.8%; n = 4;
p = 0.19), confirming that Ppm1d mutant LT-HSCs lack a self-
renewal advantage (Figure S7D). A tertiary serial transplantation
revealed similar findings, where Ppm1d mutant cells demon-
strated significantly lower contribution to the peripheral blood
than WT cells, even when normalized to donor bone marrow
chimerism (Figure S7D).
Figure 5. PPM1D Mutants Demonstrate a Selective Advantage In Vitro with Certain Classes of Chemotherapeutics
In vitro competition was performed with GFP-negative PPM1D mutant cells to GFP-positive control cells at a starting ratio of 15:85. The competing cells
were treated with doxorubicin (20 nM), etoposide (250 nM), or vincristine (1 nM) every 4 days, and flow cytometry was performed every 2 days over 14 days
to assess the change in percentage of PPM1D mutants. Representative flow plots are depicted at three time points: day 2, day 8, and day 14. The red gate
denotes the GFP-negative PPM1D mutant population, and the gray gate denotes the GFP-positive control population. Mean ± SD are shown in the summary
graphs (n = 3).

 These results suggest that the stress of hematopoietic trans-
plantation and HSC engraftment has a neutral, and perhaps
negative, impact on selection for Ppm1d mutants. Bone marrow
transplantation imposes distinct stress on HSCs compared to
cytotoxic agents, and we cannot distinguish what aspects of
HSC function are impaired; possibly the engraftment capacity

assessed lineage composition of the peripheral blood and examined the frequency of different progenitor compartments in the bone marrow by flow cytometry
(n = 10 mice/group for peripheral blood, n = 6 mice/group for bone marrow). Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) were identified by c-kit+ lineage�
Sca-1+ (KLS), with either CD150+ CD48� (‘‘SLAM’’) gating (n = 6 mice) or CD34� Flk2� gating (n = 3 mice). Mean +/� SD is shown.

80% WT CD45.1 bone marrow cells. A total of 3 3 106 whole bone marrow cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated 8-week-old recipient mice (n = 8 per
group). Engraftment was assessed 4 weeks following transplant, and the recipient mice were treated with weekly doses of 4 mg/kg cisplatin (intraperitoneally
[i.p.]) for 5 consecutive weeks.
(D) Average peripheral blood chimerism 4 weeks following transplant was 22.8% (range 18.3%–27%) in the control cohort (Ppm1d+/+) and 13.9% (range 8.2%–
20.4%) in the mutant cohort (Ppm1dm/+). Chimerism was monitored weekly by flow cytometry. The graph depicts the average of the fold change in chimerism for
each mouse relative to the initial chimerism at 4 weeks post-transplant (n = 8 for each group, mean ± SD shown). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and
****p < 0.0001.
(E) Bone marrow was harvested from the Ppm1dm/+ competitively transplanted mice to assess chimerism on multiple levels of the hematopoietic hierarchy,

and-whisker plots, with the quartiles, minimum, and maximum values shown.

 of Ppm1d mutant cells is reduced. This is suggested by the
defect seen as early as 5 weeks after transplantation. These
data are consistent with clinical findings showing a decrease in
the variant allele frequency (VAF) of PPM1D-mutant clones
following autologous transplantation in patients (Wong et al.,
2018). Interestingly, the poor engraftment capability of Ppm1d
mutant HSCs has some parallels with phenotypes seen in
Ppm1d knockout (KO) HSCs (Chen et al., 2015). In these KO
mice however, the reconstitution defect is attributed to defects
in HSC differentiation. Clearly, Ppm1d loss (as in the KO mice)
versus hyperactivity (as in the CH-associated mutations) have
very distinct effects on HSC function, and suggest that WT
PPM1D levels may be optimal for HSC homeostasis.
DISCUSSION
Cancer therapies create a variety of conditions that favor the
death of malignant cells. Necessarily, these various conditions
will also favor the survival of other cells —usually not WT. Pre-ex-
isting somatic mutations may contribute to the outcome for indi-
vidual stem cells. While many somatic mutations will have a
neutral effect, others may confer upon an HSC clone a greater
fitness through enhanced self-renewal capacity, an augmented
rate of proliferation, or a diminution in susceptibility to cell death.
Expansion of HSCs with mutations in TET2 and DNMT3A, for
example, appears to be driven by increased self-renewal
(Challen et al., 2011; Kunimoto et al., 2012; Moran-Crusio
Figure 7. Ppm1d Mutant Cells Lose Their Survival Advantage in the Context of Bone Marrow Transplantation
(A) Competitive whole bone marrow transplant was performed, with 20% of either R451X (Ppm1dm/+) or control (Ppm1d+/+) bone marrow cells mixed with 80%
WT bone marrow cells. The recipient mice (n = 8 per group) were not treated with chemotherapy following transplant. Chimerism was monitored weekly by flow
cytometry. Normalized values are shown using the initial chimerism at 4 weeks as the baseline for calculation of fold change (mean ± SD shown). *p < 0.05,
**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001.
(B) Schematic of the serial bone marrow transplantation performed 13 weeks after the initial competitive transplant shown in (A). 3 3 106 whole bone marrow
(WBM) cells from the primary recipients of the transplant were serially transplanted into lethally irradiated secondary recipient mice (n = 8 per group). Peripheral
blood chimerism was assessed in the secondary recipients 5 and 14 weeks following serial transplantation.
(C) Graphs depicting the chimerism of the donor bone marrow (BM) at the time of serial transplantation, the chimerism in the peripheral blood (PB) of the
secondary recipients at 5 and 14 weeks after transplantation (n = 8 per group), and the chimerism in LT-HSCs (n = 4 per group) at 18 weeks. The summary bar
graph below shows chimerism at each time-point, normalized to the initial chimerism of transplanted bone marrow (red, Ppm1d mutant; gray, WT control). Mean ±
SD is shown.
(D) Model of clonal hematopoiesis, emphasizing that different genes have different fitness effects in different contexts. Intrinsic factors such as self-renewal have
been shown to drive clonal expansion of DNMT3A and TET2 mutants, whereas aberrant differentiation and proliferation drive expansion of JAK2 mutations. With
PPM1D, extrinsic stressors such as cisplatin promote expansion of the mutants.

 et al., 2011). Other genes such as JAK2 skew normal proliferation
and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, resulting in
strong expansion (James et al., 2005). The mechanism of expan-
sion of cells with PPM1D mutations is unusual in that its selective
advantage arises specifically in the context of chemotherapy
with agents that induce apoptosis (Figure 7D).
In the context of cisplatin, our results demonstrate that resis-
tance to apoptosis plays a significant role in the competitive
advantage of PPM1D mutant cells. Even though their resistance
to apoptosis seems modest initially (49% apoptosis in mutant
versus 65% in WT cells) (Figure 3), after multiple rounds of expo-
sure, this �16% difference is compounded. For example, after
one exposure to cisplatin, the ratio of live mutant:WT cells is
51:35 (1.46). Over four rounds of treatment, with a starting pro-
portion of PPM1D mutant cells at 20% and assuming no prolifer-
ation differences, the theoretical ratio of mutant:WT cells would
go to 90% (20%*1.46^4). This is remarkably close to our obser-
vations (85% mutant cells in Figure 3 and 45% mutant cells from
a starting portion of 10% in Figure S3C).
A competitive advantage could also be conferred by diminished
cell-cycle arrest after chemotherapeutic treatment. PPM1D-
mutant and WT cells both appeared to experience cell-cycle arrest
to a similar extent following cisplatin treatment, again suggesting
that differences in response to apoptosis may be the primary
mechanism through which PPM1D mutant cells predominate.
This is consistent with prior observations in ovarian cancer cells,
where the PPM1D mutant protein was found to play a role in
cisplatin resistance via attenuation of p53-dependent apoptosis
(Ali et al., 2012). However, we cannot exclude some effect of
PPM1D mutations on cellular proliferation in some contexts, as
recently suggested for cytarabine treatment (Kahn et al., 2018).
Furthermore, the starting proportion of Ppm1d mutant cells in the
donor bone marrow prior to chemotherapy exposure could also
affectthepotencyofselectionaspreviouslyseenwithTp53mutant
cells in mice (Bondar and Medzhitov, 2010). Taken together, our
findings suggest that PPM1D mutant clones are present in a small
proportionoftheHSCpopulationpriortochemotherapy.Cytotoxic
drug treatments then create a fitness landscape in which PPM1D
mutant cells are better adapted for survival than WT cells.
This scenario is similar to what has been shown with TP53 in the
context of chemotherapy (Wong et al., 2015), but the specific
context of selection appears to be critical. In the case of PPM1D
mutations, PPM1D mutants are more ‘‘fit’’ only in the context of
specific classes of chemotherapy, particularly those associated
withDNA cross-links(e.g.,cisplatin),DNA intercalation(e.g.,doxo-
rubicin), or topoisomerase-mediated DNA repair/replication (e.g.,
etoposide). PPM1D mutants have also been shown to demon-
strate selective outgrowth in the context of cytarabine (Kahn
et al., 2018). In contrast, microtubule inhibitors, such as vincristine,
donotappeartoconferafitnessadvantagetoPPM1Dmutants.An
alternative possibility is that specific agents directly induce muta-
genesis, and cells that acquire the appropriate mutations in the
PPM1D locus then persist. In this study, we did not have pre
t-AML/t-MDS samples available and thus were unable to defini-
tively address this distinction. Yet, the PPM1D VAF range of
0.02–0.47 in our patient cohort suggests that after acquisition of
the PPM1D mutation in a single cell, there is likely some form of se-
lection that results in expansion of the mutant into a detectable
clone. Furthermore, other studies have found PPM1D mutations
prior to, or in absence of, chemotherapy (Genovese et al., 2014;
Gillis et al., 2017; Takahashi et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2018).
A key question that arises is whether PPM1D mutations
contribute to leukemia development. PPM1D mutations are
seen with much higher frequency in therapy-related AML and
MDS than in de novo diseases (Figure 1). However, the VAF
of mutant PPM1D in our t-AML/t-MDS cohort is low in the major-
ity of cases, with a median of 0.05 and mean of 0.1, consistent
with prior reports (Lindsley et al., 2017). This raises the question
of whether PPM1D mutations can be leukemia-founding muta-
tions or if they represent a co-existing sub-clone, or even a
bystander clone, and whether PPM1D mutations mechanisti-
cally
contribute
to
driving
leukemia
development.
Future
experiments will be necessary to address this thoroughly. Never-
theless, in a subset of cases in our cohort, PPM1D mutations
consisted of a substantial portion of marrow cells (VAF >0.2); in
six of those instances, we calculated the cancer cell fraction
(CCF) of the mutation and observed that five out of six cases
had a CCF of 1.0, indicating that many tumor cells carried the
PPM1D mutation. Moreover, our PDX model with engrafted
leukemic cells from a PPM1D-mutated t-AML sample provides
further supportive evidence that PPM1D mutants can comprise
a significant portion of diseased cells and may play a role in pro-
gression to leukemogenesis at least in some cases.
The fact that PPM1D mutations cause a gain-of-function and
thus constitutively inhibit DNA damage activation of p53 is inter-
esting given the role of p53 as a tumor suppressor. It is not clear
from our data whether PPM1D is acting primarily through sup-
pression of p53; however, PPM1D is also known to suppress
numerous other components of the DNA damage response (re-
viewed Lu et al., 2008). The fact that PPM1D mutants do not
completely phenocopy TP53 mutations—for example, PPM1D-
mutated t-AML/t-MDS patients do not appear to have the num-
ber of chromosomal abnormalities that TP53 mutant t-MDS
patients do (Lindsley et al., 2017)—suggests the mechanism
may be more complex. We also note that PPM1D mutations
have been observed in individuals with CH that are not reported
to have been exposed to chemotherapy (Genovese et al., 2014).
As more data on CH in the general population is accumulated, it
will be important to determine whether PPM1D mutant clones
can also rise via neutral drift or whether there are as-yet-uniden-
tified environmental exposures that promote their relative sur-
vival. Nevertheless, it is important to note that TP53 mutations
provide stem cells an advantage in other contexts. Hematopoi-
etic stem cells from mice with reduced levels of p53 were able
to outcompete WT cells, particularly with age (Bondar and Medz-
hitov, 2010; Dumble et al., 2007).
Another study looking at cooperation among cells during em-
bryonic development found that embryonic stem cells with p53
or Top1 knockdown completely supersede their WT neighbors
without, remarkably enough, disrupting embryonic development
(Dejosez et al., 2013). In that study, too, the success of p53-defi-
cient cells was dependent on context: homogeneous popula-
tions of these cells show normal growth, and only in mixed
populations do they expand disproportionately. Dejosez et al.
(2013) proposed that these genes allow cells to cooperate with
other cells in response to changes in the microenvironment.
Once again, when considering evolutionary fitness, context is
everything. It will be important to understand the very different
710
Cell Stem Cell 23, 700–713, November 1, 2018
 environmental factors (fitness landscapes) that promote expan-
sion of cells with distinct CH-associated mutations. The recent
report of pre-leukemic expansion of Tet2-deficient cells driven
by inflammatory cytokines after bacterial infection (Meisel
et al., 2018) indicates there may be myriad relevant but as yet un-
identified stressors.
In conclusion, PPM1D is clearly relevant to, although not suf-
ficient for, the development of future hematological malig-
nancies. Rising PPM1D-mutant clones were clearly associated
with prior exposure to platinum agents and the topoisomerase
inhibitor etoposide. This suggests that increased expression of
PPM1D, either through the stabilizing truncating mutations or
copy number gain, confers a selective advantage in the context
of these cytotoxic therapies by causing the mutant cells to resist
apoptosis. In the broader context of CH, we posit that mutations
that differentially improve HSC survival, even without a particular
impact on self-renewal, differentiation or proliferation, will in-
crease the likelihood of that cell appearing as a CH clone, and
also in its chance to accumulate further mutations that could
be oncogenic. These studies underscore the importance of un-
derstanding specific treatment-mutation interactions in order
to inform the choice of intervention for cancer patients and
deriving prognostic implications when CH is detected.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human subjects
The study population included patients diagnosed with therapy-related AML and therapy-related MDS, who were treated at MD An-
derson Leukemia Clinic between 2010-2015. The patients were identified through the institutional medical records database. Inclu-
sion criteria included prior diagnosis and treatment for at least one primary malignancy, with subsequent development of a therapy
related myeloid neoplasm. Patients were excluded from analysis if they had a primary malignancy that was not treated with chemo-
therapy, radiation therapy, or systemic agents. In total, 156 patients met criteria for the t-AML/t-MDS cohort. See Tables S1 and S2
for patient characteristics (in brief, the cohort included 84 males and 72 females, with a median age of 67 (range 58-72)). All bone
marrow and peripheral blood samples were obtained at the time of or shortly after t-AML or t-MDS diagnosis, with written consent
from patients and approval for research use by the MDACC Institutional Review Board. The control cohort (for comparison of
genomic landscape) consists of 228 patients diagnosed with de novo AML or MDS, with no prior exposure to chemotherapy and
radiation therapy, at MD Anderson within the same time period. Targeted-capture sequencing and PPM1D re-sequencing by the
same protocol described below had been previously performed on these de novo cases, and the results were utilized for comparison
with our t-MN cohort. Clinical characteristics such as blood counts were obtained at the time of t-AML/t-MDS diagnosis. Clinical
data, including prior primary malignancy, exposure to cytotoxic and radiation therapy, treatment protocols received for t-MN,
response rates and overall survival were curated from clinical chart review of each patient’s medical history. Smoking history was
self-reported. In some categories, the total number reported in tables or graphs may be less than 156, if there was insufficient or
missing data. Lastly, it was noted that the association between sex and PPM1D mutational status was not statistically significant
(PPM1D mutated cases included 17 males and 14 females, p = 0.90). Thus, we did not pursue further analyses on the influence
of sex on findings from this patient cohort.
Cell Lines
MOLM13 cells were cultured in RPMI (GIBCO), OCI-AML2 and OCI-AML3 cells in MEM alpha (GIBCO), and HEK293 cells in DMEM
(GIBCO), all supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning) and 1% Pen/Strep (GIBCO). Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere con-
taining 5% CO2 at 37�C. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma using a PCR-based method. The HEK293 line was purchased
directly from ATCC, where authentication has been performed. The OCI-AML2, OCI-AML3, and MOLM13 lines were not authenti-
cated; however, all experiments involve comparisons between isogenic control and mutant lines derived from the same parent
line. The sex of the cell lines is as follows: HEK293 – female, MOLM13 – male, OCI-AML2 – male, OCI-AML3 – male.
Mice
All mice were housed in AAALAC-accredited, specific-pathogen-free animal care facilities at Baylor College of Medicine, and all pro-
cedures were approved by the BCM Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice of both sexes were used, and experimental
mice were separated by sex and housed with 5 mice per cage. All mice were immune-competent and healthy prior to the experiments
described. Tail snips were performed to obtain tissue for genotyping at the time of weaning. Otherwise, no experimental procedures,
tests, or drugs were administered prior to the studies described.
Generation of the Ppm1d R451X mouse model
The Ppm1d1 R451X knock-in mouse model was generated with CRISPR-Cas9 in collaboration with the Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell
Core and Genetically Engineered Mouse Core at Baylor College of Medicine. A sgRNA (sequence GTCCCAGCTGAGATAGCTAG)
was used to induce a double stranded break in the endogenous allele close to amino acid 451. The single-stranded oligo template
for homology-directed repair was designed to introduce a premature stop codon after amino acid 450 (via a point mutation), with a
GGGGS linker and 3x FLAG tag preceding the stop codon. This construct was flanked by proximal and distal homology arms. The full
sequence of the synthesized ssoligo was: AGAAGTTTTTAGAGGTCCCAGCTGAGATAGCTGGTGGTGGCGGTTCAGACTACAAAGA
CCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGTGAGGGAATATCCAGACTGTAGTGATGACCT
CAAAAGACTCAGAGACACTTGAAGAAAATTGCCCCAAAGCCCTGACTTTAAGG.
A total of 200 C57BL/6 embryos were cytoplasmically injected with the following in 60uL of 1X sterile PBS: Cas9 (wild-type),
100ng/ul; 1 sgRNA, 20ng/ul; 1 ssOligo, 100 ng/ul. The injected embryos were transferred into the oviducts of ICR recipient mice.
Twenty-three founder pups were born, and 3 correctly incorporated the 3xFLAG tag and stop codon, as determined by PCR geno-
typing and verified by Sanger Sequencing. The sequence was visualized with the sequence alignment function in the Snapgene soft-
ware. These mosaic R451X founder mice were crossed with wild-type C57BL/6 to obtain heterozygous F1 mice. This Ppm1d R451X/+
line was subsequently maintained by further backcrosses with wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Hematopoiesis in both male and female
PPM1DR451X/+ 8-week old mice was characterized, and no significant differences were observed in peripheral blood composition,
or proportions of progenitors and stem cells between the two sexes.
Mouse genotyping
Mouse DNA was extracted from mouse tail by using DirectPCR Lysis Reagent (Viagen). Extracted DNA was used for PCR genotyp-
ing. The specific PCR primers for the Ppm1d R451X mouse were: AGGCTGAGCTCTAAGGACCA (forward) and ATTGGCTGGA
GGGGTTCTTT (reverse). The PCR product was 396 bp for the flag-tagged Ppm1d truncated allele, and 315 bp for the wild-type allele.

 Patient Derived Xenograft model
The t-AML PDX model was generated using NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid IL2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice, in accordance with The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center IACUC guidelines (protocol #00000884-RN02) and NIH guidelines.
Frozen primary t-AML cells were thawed, and cells were intravenously transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated NSG mice (250cGy).
5x105 total cells were transplanted into each mouse, and peripheral blood analysis was performed every two weeks following trans-
plantation, to monitor the disease burden. Briefly, peripheral blood samples were treated with red cell lysis buffer, and the cells were
washed prior to staining with PE-conjugated anti-human CD45 antibody (BioLegend #304008) or APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD45
antibody (BD Bioscience #559864), and DAPI (ThermoScientific #62248). Flow-cytometry was performed to assess the relative per-
centages of murine and human CD45+ cells and to track human CD45 (hCD45) engraftment in the peripheral blood over time. Animals
were sacrificed and bone marrow was harvested when the percentage of hCD45+ cells reached 20%–30% of the peripheral blood.
Serial transplantation was performed with the harvested bone marrow, which was determined to have greater than 90% hCD45+
cells. 1x106 bone marrow cells were serially transplanted into sub-lethally irradiated recipient NSG mice (250cGy). An aliquot of
bone marrow cells was analyzed by next-generation sequencing to determine PPM1D variant allele frequency (VAF). The secondary
recipient mice were monitored for clinical signs of illness, and peripheral blood was routinely analyzed for expansion of leukemic
hCD45-expressing cells. When the percentage of hCD45+ cells exceeded 30% of peripheral blood cells, the mice were sacrificed.
Bone marrow and splenic cells from these secondary recipient mice were harvested, and analyzed by next-generation sequencing to
determine PPM1D VAF.
METHOD DETAILS
DNA sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from the diagnostic t-MN bone marrow samples using the Autopure extractor (QIAGEN/Gentra, Valen-
cia, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A customized 295-gene panel was utilized for targeted sequencing, as pre-
viously described (Morita et al., 2018). As PPM1D was not included on the first gene panel, we re-visited all 156 t-MN samples and
performed targeted PCR amplification of exon 6 of PPM1D, utilizing 2 sets of PCR primers designed to yield overlapping amplicons
that cover the entirety of the exon. The 2 sets of PCR primers used were (50 to 30): Set 1 Fwd = TGCATAGATTTGTTGAGTTCTGG, Set1
Rev = AGGCCAATTGGAAGGCTATT, and Set 2 Fwd = ATTGCGCTAAAGCCCTGAC and Set 2 Rev = TCTTCTGGCCCCTAAGTCTG).
The PCR amplicons were purified with QIAGEN MinElute columns, and 300ng was submitted for library preparation and next gen-
eration sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform. As previously described (Takahashi et al., 2017), raw sequencing data from
the Illumina platform were converted to a fastq format and aligned to the reference genome (hg19) using the Burroughs-Wheeler
Aligner (BWA). The aligned BAM files were subjected to mark duplication, re-alignment, and re-calibration using Picard and
GATK. Preprocessed BAM files were then analyzed to detect single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertions and deletions
(indels) using MuTect and Pindel algorithms, respectively, against virtual normal sequence developed in-house. Variants with VAF
equal to or greater than 0.02 were retained.
SNP array for PPM1D copy number alteration
We used Illumina Infinium Omni 5-4 (N = 91) and Omni 2.5-8 (N = 29) bead chips to assess DNA copy number profiles of 120 t-AML/
t-MDS marrow samples. Genomic DNA was processed by whole genome amplification, enzymatic fragmentation and sequence-
specific hybridization to the bead chips at 48 degree for 16-24 hr. After target hybridization to the bead arrays, primers hybridized
to the template were extended by enzymatic allele-specific primers, stained with two-color single base extension biochemistry
and the chips were scanned on the iScan (Illumina Inc.) IDAT files generated from the scanner were uploaded onto GenomeStudio
2.0 software. Copy number profiles were generated using Conumee R package in Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/
release/bioc/html/conumee.html). Raw intensity values from two alleles (A and B allele) were combined and used as a raw input. Sub-
sequent fitting, binning and segmentation were performed with the program’s default setting.
Generation of PPM1D mutant cell lines
We generated the PPM1D mutant cell lines in MOLM13, HEK293, OCI-AML2, and OCI-AML3 using the RNP-based CRISPR/Cas9
delivery method, and sgRNAs were synthesized as previously described (Brunetti et al., 2018; Gundry et al., 2016). In brief, the
CRISPRscan algorithm was used to identify proto-spacer sequences in exon 6 of PPM1D. We selected a pair of sgRNAs that creates
an out-of-frame deletion in exon 6 (guide sequences from 50 to 30 are GGGTCCTTAGAATTCACCCT and GGAAGGCATTGCTAC
GAACC). For synthesis of sgRNAs, full-length DNA templates were produced by overlap PCR, and the PCR products were purified
with the MinElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN), followed by in vitro transcription with the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit
(NEB) per manufacturer’s protocol. The in vitro transcription products were purified using the RNA Clean & Concentrator-25 and
eluted in nuclease-free water, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cas9-sgRNA RNPs were then generated by incubating
1ug of Cas9 protein (IDT) with 1ug of the sgRNA pair for 15 minutes at room temperature, prior to electroporation with 2 x105 cells
in Buffer R using the Neon Transfection System (ThermoFisher). Electroporation conditions used were 1500V, 30ms, 1 pulse for
HEK293 and 1350V, 35ms, 1 pulse for MOLM13, OCI-AMl2, and OCI-AML3. Single cell clones were isolated and screened for the
deletion created by the sgRNA pair by PCR (forward primer = TGCATAGATTTGTTGAGTTCTGG, reverse primer = TGGTTCTGG
ATCTTTTGAGGGT). Positive clones were Sanger-sequenced for verification of an exon 6 truncation. Sequencing results revealed

 that the HEK293 mutant clone had a truncation at amino acid 431 and the MOLM13 mutant clone had a truncation at amino acid 440.
For the isogenic control cell line for MOLM13, we electroporated cells with a pair of in-frame sgRNAs targeting the last exon of ENAM,
a gene that encodes enamel in the teeth (sgRNA sequences are GGATGATGTGTCCACGCTG and GGGAACTGGCTTCAGGAAA).
Immunoblotting
Cells or minced mouse tissue were lysed with 1x RIPA buffer supplemented with the Halt Protease and Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(ThermoFisher) for 30 minutes at 4�C. Protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher),
and lysates were then boiled at 95C in 1x Laemmli (Bio-Rad) for 5 mins. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4%–15%
gradient gels (Bio-Rad), and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). For the blot in Figure 3A, duplicate sets of samples
were run for parallel blotting. After 1 hour of blocking, membranes were incubated overnight at 4�C with the following primary anti-
bodies: mouse anti-PPM1D (F-10, Santa Cruz, 1:1000, for detection of human PPM1D), rabbit anti-p53 ser15 (#9284, Cell Signaling,
1:1000), rabbit anti-total p53 (#9282, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), rabbit anti-gH2AX ser139 (#2577, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), rabbit anti-
total H2AX (#2595, Cell Signaling, 1:1000), mouse anti-GAPDH (MAB374, Millipore, 1:2000), rabbit anti-PPM1D (D4F7, Cell Signaling,
1:1000, for detection of mouse PPM1D). This was followed by secondary antibody incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horse-
radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz), and imaging on the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc platform.
In vitro phosphatase assay
The wild-type PPM1D-Flag vector (PPM1D-Flag-CMV-Neo-Bam) was a gift from Dr. Ettore Appella. Phosphatase dead D314A (PD),
C478X, E525X, R458X, and R552X mutants were created using a site directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) and the wild-
type PPM1D-Flag construct as the backbone. The individual constructs were transfected into 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000
(Thermo Fisher) and PPM1D proteins were immunoprecipitated 48 hours later using anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma Aldrich). Immu-
noprecipitates were washed once in TBS and 3 times in PP2C buffer (50mM Trish-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 0.02% b-mercap-
toethanol). Proteins were released from the beads using 3x Flag peptide (Sigma Aldrich) diluted in PP2C buffer. Equal volumes of
immunoprecipitated PPM1D were incubated with 30mM MgCl2 and 100uM p53 serine15 phosphopeptide (Ac-VEPPL(pS)QETFS-
Amide). Reactions were incubated at 25�C for 1 hour. Free phosphate was measured with the addition of Biomol Green (ENZO Life-
sciences). Absorbance was read at 630nm in a Victor 2 multilabel 96-well plate reader (Perkin Elmer). The results were normalized to
enzyme input based on densitometric analysis of western results for the immunoprecipitated proteins.
Chemotherapy dose-response experiments
The stock solutions of cisplatin (Sigma, C2210000) and GSK2730371 (Sigma, SML1048) were prepared in water, and etoposide
(Sigma, E1383) and doxorubicin (Sigma, D1515) were prepared in DMSO. Isogenic PPM1D WT and mutant clones generated
from MOLM13, OCI-AML2, and OCI-AML3 were seeded at 5000 cells per well in 96-well flat-bottom plates. An 8-point, 3-fold serial
dilution of the drugs was added to the plates, to a final volume of 100uL per well (n = 3 replicates for each concentration). Cell viability
was measured after 48 hours by the addition of Cell Counting Kit-8 (WST-8) reagent (Dojindo), 10uL per well, followed by incubation at
37�C for 4 h. Absorbance values of the wells were recorded with microplate reader (Perkin Elmer) at 450 nm. The viability readings
were normalized to that of cells treated with vehicle alone. The resulting data were analyzed by using the dose-response function in
Prism 6 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). Dose-response curves were created and the concentration corresponding to the IC50
was determined.
Detection of apoptosis
Annexin V-APC and 7-AAD staining was used for the quantitation of early and late apoptotic cells. MOLM13 cells were treated with
1uM cisplatin (+/� 24nM GSK2830371) for 72 hours, washed and resuspended in 100uL of 1x annexin binding buffer (BD Biosci-
ences) with annexin V-APC (BioLegend, 3:100 concentration) and 7-AAD (BioLegend, 3:100 concentration) for 20 minutes. Cells
were analyzed by flow cytometry (LSRII, Becton Dickinson) with the FACSdiva software (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 cells
was analyzed per sample, and data was visualized using the FlowJo software.
Cell cycle analysis
PPM1D wild-type and mutant cells were treated with 750nM cisplatin (or vehicle) for 24 hours. Prior to harvest, the cells were pulsed
with BrdU for 1 hr at a 10uM concentration in the media. The cells were then washed, pelleted, and fixed with 70% ethanol in HBSS
overnight for BrdU cell cycle analysis. The next day, fixed cells were spun down and the fixative liquid was aspirated. Cells were re-
suspended in denaturation solution (2N HCl with 0.5% Triton X in PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature, then pelleted and resus-
pended in neutralization solution (0.1M Na2B4O7 in water, pH = 8.5). The cells were pelleted again, and incubated with FITC Anti-BrdU
antibody (10uL in 50uL of 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X antibody solution) for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were then washed with 1%
BSA in PBS, spun down, and resuspended in 50ug/mL propidium iodide (+10ug/mL RNase) in PBS. Cells were then analyzed by flow
cytometry (LSRII, Becton Dickinson). 3 independent experiments were performed, in triplicate.
In vitro cell competition
Isogenic MOLM13 and GFP-expressing MOLM13 cells were a gift from Dr. Karen Rabin. PPM1D mutant MOLM13 cells (clonal line
generated as described earlier) were mixed with control (ENAM-edited) GFP-expressing MOLM13 cells. Specifically, 200k PPM1D
e5
Cell Stem Cell 23, 700–713.e1–e6, November 1, 2018
 mutant cells were mixed with 800k control cells, for a total of 1 million cells per 6-well (in triplicates). Cells were either resuspended in
2mL of media with 1uM cisplatin, 1uM cisplatin with 18nM of GSK2830371, or vehicle (water). Every 4 days, cells were split 1:2, and
the resuspended in media with fresh drug (or vehicle). Split cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to track the percentage of PPM1D
mutant GFP-negative cells. Three independent experiments were performed, with technical triplicates. In the reciprocal experiment,
clonal lines of CRISPR-generated PPM1D-mutant GFP-expressing MOLM13 cells were mixed with control GFP-negative MOLM13
cells in a 10:90 ratio and treated as above. The dosage used for the other chemotherapy agents (also refreshed every 4 days as
above) are as follows: doxorubicin - 20nM, etoposide - 250nM, and vincristine - 1nM.
Murine bone marrow transplantation
The Ppm1d R451X mice (bearing the CD45.2 surface alloantigen) were crossed to wild-type mice (bearing the CD45.1 surface allo-
antigen) (B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ) for one generation to yield offspring (expressing both CD45.1 and CD45.2 alloantigens) that
were either Ppm1d R451X heterozygotes or wild-type. For the competitive bone marrow transplantations, donor bone marrow
from age and sex-matched 6 to 8-week old R451X or wild-type control littermates (CD45.1/CD45.2) were mixed with bone marrow
from wild-type mice (CD45.1) in a 20:80 ratio, with a total of 3x106 cells transplanted into each recipient mouse. Specifically, 6x105
Ppm1d R451X or control cells (CD45.1/CD45.2) were mixed with 2.4x106 wild-type cells (CD45.1), and retro-orbitally injected into 6-
to 10-week old lethally irradiated CD45.1 recipient mice (split-dose of 1100cGy total, separated by 4 hours). Secondary transplan-
tation was performed by transplanting 3 3 106 bone marrow cells from the recipients of the first competitive transplant into lethally
irradiated (1100cGy) secondary recipients.
Peripheral blood was collected at 4 weeks following transplant to determine engraftment and to establish the baseline chimerism.
In the whole bone marrow competitive transplants, recipient mice were randomly allocated into treatment groups, and treated with
either cisplatin (4mg/kg, intraperitoneal) or vehicle (water) once a week starting at 4 weeks post-transplant, for 5 consecutive weeks.
Chimerism in the peripheral blood was monitored weekly by flow cytometry (LSRII, Becton Dickinson) in the first 8 weeks, and bi-
weekly thereafter. The following antibodies were used for peripheral blood staining: APC-conjugated CD45.2, FITC-conjugated
CD45.1, PeCy7-conjugated Gr-1, CD11b, B220, and PB-conjugated CD4, CD8, B220 (eBioscience). At 13 weeks post-transplant,
several recipients from the competitive transplant cohort were sacrificed for analysis of the bone marrow and for serial
transplantation.
Briefly, whole bone marrow cells were obtained by crushing the long bones (tibias and femurs) with a mortar and pestle in Hank’s
buffered salt solution (HBSS), supplemented with 10mM HEPES (GIBCO) and 2% heat-inactivated bovine serum (Corning). Cells
were filtered through a 40 mm cell strainer (ThermoFisher Scientific) to obtain a single-cell suspension. For analysis of populations
in the bone marrow, the following antibodies were used: CD4-eFluor450 (1:100), CD8-PB (1:100), CD3-eFluor450 (1:100), Ter-
119-eFluor450 (1:100), CD11b-eFluor450 (1:100), Gr-1-eFluor450 (1:100), B220-eFluor450 (1:100), CD19-eFluor450 (1:100), Sca1-
APC Cy7 (1:100), cKit-PeCy7 (1:100), FcR II/III-PE (1:100), CD34-FITC (1:100), CD48-FITC (1:200), CD150-PE (1:100), CD45.2-
APC (1:100), and CD45.1-BUV395 (1:100). All monoclonal antibodies were from BD Biosciences or eBioscience.
The LSRII/Fortessa cell analyzer was used for data acquisition, and data analysis was performed using the FlowJo software.
The treatment regimens for the additional chemotherapy agents are as follows: doxorubicin (3 rounds of 2mg/kg IP x 3 days, with
21 days between each round) and vincristine (8 rounds of 0.1mg/kg IP, once weekly).
The mouse studies were performed without blinding of the investigator and no animals were excluded from the analysis, with the
exception of recipient mice that did not successfully engraft following transplant, or mice that were not used due to human-errors
during the experiment. These numbers were minimal. With mouse bone marrow transplant experiments, 5-10 recipient mice per
experimental group is a well-accepted sample size that is used by numerous studies in the field and in this study. This cohort size
is typically sufficient for statistical power.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical analyses of the clinical data were performed with the SPSS software. Associations between pairs of categorical variables
were assessed using Fisher’s exact test or Pearson’s Chi square test. Survival following t-MN diagnosis was assessed by Kaplan-
Meier survival analysis, and Mantel Cox log rank test was performed to determine statistical significance. P values were interpreted
as statistically significant if less than 0.05, unless otherwise stated. See also Figure Legends and the Results section for more details.
In the rest of the manuscript, all data are expressed as the mean ± SD, unless otherwise stated. Statistics were calculated and
figures were generated with Graphpad Prism 6. The statistical significance of the differences between two groups was calculated
using unpaired Student’s t test (two-sided), without assuming equal standard deviations. Statistical details are described in the Fig-
ure Legends, including the number of replicates or animals per group (denoted by ‘‘n’’), as well as p values where relevant. *p < 0.05,
**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.
