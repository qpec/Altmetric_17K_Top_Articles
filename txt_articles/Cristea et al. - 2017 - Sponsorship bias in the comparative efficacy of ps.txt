 Sponsorship or industry bias refers to the notion that industry
financing of drug studies is strongly associated with findings that
favour the industry or the sponsor’s product.1–3 Conflict of
interest (COI), and specifically the financial type, is defined as
‘a set of conditions in which professional judgment concerning
a primary interest (such as a patient’s welfare or the validity of
research) tends to be unduly influenced by a secondary interest
(such as financial gain)’.4 For the treatment of depression, industry
bias has been clearly documented in comparisons between anti-
depressants and placebo,5,6 where it seems to pivot around
selective publication. However, the issues of detecting and
quantifying the effects of sponsorship bias are more complicated
in head-to-head trials, looking at the comparative effectiveness
or safety of two interventions. These trials are usually conducted
after a drug has been approved and consequently do not have
to be registered with a regulatory body. Hence, identifying
unpublished trials becomes infinitely more difficult, as it hinges
entirely on the willingness of investigators to share their data. This
significant problem also implies that other methods have to be
used for quantifying sponsorship bias than just scavenging for
unpublished trials. Moreover, most head-to-head trials do not
attempt to prove superiority of interventions, but non-inferiority
or equivalence and so even when they do find significant
differences, these are usually small in magnitude. Consequently,
we can expect the effects of sponsorship bias to be smaller and
subtler. For treatment for depression, some systematic reviews
have looked at the effects of sponsorship bias in head-to-head
comparisons between pharmacological treatments,7,8 but not for
the contrast between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Recent
meta-analyses indicate these treatment options have comparable
efficiency for depressive symptoms.9,10 Furthermore, a meta-
analysis11 of direct comparisons between psychotherapy and placebo
pill found that the comparative effect size for psychotherapy was
in the range of what had been reported for antidepressants.6
Current treatment guidelines, such as those from the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),12 recommend
both for depression. Nevertheless, if the effects of sponsorship bias
and financial COI are indeed that pervasive, we can conjecture
that they may also affect the contrast between a pharmacological
and a psychological intervention. To the best of our knowledge,
this question has not yet been considered for any mental
disorder. Thus, we decided to examine the effects of sponsorship
bias and financial COI in randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
directly comparing psychotherapy and medication in depression.
Specifically, we predicted that each of these factors would be
associated with finding more positive effects for pharmacological
than psychological interventions.
Method
Identification and selection of studies
We used a database of papers on the psychological treatment
of depression described in detail elsewhere13 and that has
been used in a series of earlier published meta-analyses (www.
evidencebasedpsychotherapies.org).
This
database
has
been
continuously updated through comprehensive literature searches
(covering studies published between 1966 and January 2015). In
these searches, we examined abstracts from PubMed, PsycINFO,
Embase and the Cochrane Register of Trials. These abstracts
were identified by combining terms indicative of psychological
treatment and depression (both MeSH terms and text words, see
online Supplement DS1). For this database, we also checked the
primary studies from earlier meta-analyses of psychological
treatments for depression to ensure that no published studies were
missed.
We included randomised trials in which the effects of a
psychological treatment were directly compared with the effects

Sponsorship bias in the comparative efficacy
of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for adult
depression: meta-analysis
Ioana A. Cristea, Claudio Gentili, Pietro Pietrini and Pim Cuijpers
Background
Sponsorship bias has never been investigated for non-
pharmacological treatments like psychotherapy.
Aims
We examined industry funding and author financial conflict
of interest (COI) in randomised controlled trials directly
comparing psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in
depression.
Method
We conducted a meta-analysis with subgroup comparisons
for industry v. non-industry-funded trials, and respectively for
trial reports with author financial COI v. those without.
Results
In total, 45 studies were included. In most analyses,
pharmacotherapy consistently showed significant
effectiveness over psychotherapy, g = 70.11 (95% CI 70.21
to 70.02) in industry-funded trials. Differences between
industry and non-industry-funded trials were significant,
a result only partly confirmed in sensitivity analyses.
We identified five instances where authors of the original
article had not reported financial COI.
Conclusions
Industry-funded trials for depression appear to subtly favour
pharmacotherapy over psychotherapy. Disclosure of all
financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry should be
encouraged.

Review article
 of antidepressant medication in adults with a depressive disorder.
Augmentation studies in which medication or psychotherapy were
combined and compared with one of them were excluded, as it
was impossible to disentangle the effects of psychotherapy and
pharmacotherapy in these trials. Studies of in-patients were also
excluded. We further excluded maintenance or continuation
studies, aimed at people who had already recovered or partly
recovered after an earlier treatment, again due to the lack of a
direct
comparison
between
psychotherapy
and
medication.
Comorbid mental or somatic disorders were not used as exclusion
criteria, and neither was language.
Risk of bias assessment and data extraction
Trial risk of bias was assessed using four criteria of the Cochrane
Collaboration14 assessment tool: adequate generation of allocation
sequence; concealment of allocation to conditions; the prevention
of knowledge of the allocated intervention (masking of assessors);
and dealing with incomplete outcome data (assessed as positive
when intent-to-treat analyses, including all randomised patients,
were conducted). We also computed a ‘risk of bias’ score for each
study, by giving one point to each criterion for which a study
could be rated as low risk of bias.
We extracted information about study financing from the
article. Study financing was first coded into specific categories:
government only; government and pharmaceutical industry;
government and other sources; pharmaceutical industry only;
pharmaceutical industry and other sources; other sources only;
not reported. Industry support was defined as funding for the trial
or provision of free medication, as in previous reviews.2 Other
sources referred to non-governmental organisations or private
foundations, which did not benefit from any industry support.
This information was then recoded dichotomously into studies
with and without pharmaceutical industry funding.
Financial COI was defined as the receipt of financial support
or benefits of any type from the industry (employees, direct
compensation, revenues from the industry, speaker fees, consultancy,
serving on boards, etc). To extract this information, we first perused
what was reported in the article and extracted information about
the authors declaring receipt of benefits. For each study, the
number of authors with financial COI was calculated. If no COI
disclosure was reported in the article, we proceeded to checking
other papers by the same author from the ones included in the
meta-analysis. If there were none, or we still did not find any
information about financial COI in these either, we searched
PubMed for other publications by that author published 3 years
before or no more than 2 years after the included paper. This
period was chosen given that frequently there is a long interval
between the submission and acceptance of a paper. From these
papers, we favoured those published in journals requiring authors
to declare COI (such as JAMA, BMJ), and in them checked whether
any of the authors of interest had reported financial COI.
We also coded additional aspects of the included studies, such as
baseline severity (computed as a weighted mean on the Hamilton
Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) of the psychotherapy and
pharmacotherapy arms), publication year, target group, type of
depressive disorder, type of psychotherapy, class of medication.
Meta-analyses
We calculated and pooled the individual effect sizes with the
program Comprehensive Meta-analysis (CMA; version 2.2.064),
using a random-effects meta-analysis. For each comparison
between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, we calculated the
effect size indicating the difference between the two groups at
post-test (Hedges’ g). These were calculated by subtracting the
mean of the pharmacotherapy group from the mean of the
psychotherapy group, dividing the result by the pooled standard
deviation, and correcting for small sample bias.15 If a study
included
more
than
one
comparison
between
a
type
of
psychotherapy and a drug, these were averaged at the study level.
Sensitivity
analyses
were
also
conducted
using
only
the
comparisons with effect size most favourable to psychotherapy
and pharmacotherapy, respectively. We only used instruments that
explicitly measured depressive symptoms, such as HRSD or the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). If means and standard
deviations were not reported and could not be obtained from
the authors, we used the procedures recommended by Borenstein
et al16 to transform dichotomous data into the standardised
mean difference or used other statistics, such as t-values or exact
P-values to calculate the standardised mean difference. We
calculated the I 2-statistic as an indicator of heterogeneity in
percentages. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity,
whereas larger values indicate increasing heterogeneity, with
25% as low, 50% as moderate and 75% as high heterogeneity.17
We calculated 95% confidence intervals around I 2,18 using the
non-central w2-based approach with the heterogi module for
Stata.19 We tested for publication bias by inspecting the funnel
plot on primary outcome measures and by Duval & Tweedie’s trim
and fill procedure,20 which yields an estimate of the effect size after
the publication bias has been taken into account. We also conducted
Egger’s test of the intercept to quantify the bias captured by the
funnel plot and to test whether it was significant. Outliers were
defined as effect sizes for which the 95% confidence interval was
outside the 95% confidence interval of the pooled studies.
We used a mixed-effects model to test whether the effect sizes
of the studies with industry funding differed from those of the
studies without it, and whether studies authored by individuals
with financial COI differed from those where this was not
reported. In this model, studies within subgroups are pooled using
the random-effects model, but tests for significant differences
between subgroups are conducted using a fixed-effects model.21
We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to examine the
robustness of our findings. In them, we looked at the following
subgroups of studies: studies with low risk of bias on three or four
criteria; published from 2000 onwards (information about
financial COI is more rare and harder to find for older studies);
with
a
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
(SSRI)
as
pharmacotherapy; with cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) as
psychotherapy; conducted on patients with a diagnosis of major
depressive disorder (MDD, excluding patients with dysthymia or
other diagnosis); on adults only (excluding specific target groups).
Results
Selection and inclusion of studies
After examining a total of 17 061 abstracts (12 196 after removal
of duplicates), we retrieved 1756 full-text papers for further
consideration. Figure 1 presents a flow chart describing the
inclusion process. We excluded 1711 of the retrieved papers
(reasons given in the flow chart). A total of 45 studies,22–66
9 of which included two comparisons between a form of
psychotherapy and medication, met the inclusion criteria.
Characteristics of the included studies
Selected characteristics of the 45 included studies are presented in
online Table DS1. Most studies were targeted at adults in general
(n = 37), with a diagnosis of MDD (n = 37), and used CBT (n = 24
comparisons) or interpersonal therapy (n = 12 comparisons) as
psychotherapy, and SSRIs (n = 20) or tricyclics (n = 12) as
17

medication. Six studies had low risk of bias on all four criteria
considered, 9 studies on three criteria, 25 studies had low risk of
bias on one or two criteria, and 5 studies on none.
Regarding
study
funding,
11
studies
reported
funding
exclusively from the government, 13 from both the government
and pharmaceutical industry, 6 from both government and
other sources (such as philanthropic foundations, universities,
non-governmental organisations), 4 exclusively from the industry,
3 were financed by the industry and other sources and 4 by other
sources exclusively. Four studies did not report any funding.
Recoding study financing dichotomously resulted into 20 studies
(44%) with pharmaceutical industry support (for 11 of these
support involved just providing free medication) and 21 (47%)
without (the 4 studies with no funding reported were not
considered).
For financial COI, ten studies included authors who reported
a financial COI. We additionally uncovered five other studies. The
percentage of authors with financial COI of the total number of
authors in each study ranged from 8 to 92%. For the remaining
30 studies no financial COI was reported and we did not find
any further information.
Overall effect size
The overall effect size for the comparison between psychotherapy
and pharmacotherapy was non-significant, g= 70.01 (95% CI
70.12 to 0.09), I 2 = 61% (95% CI 42 to 71), in line with previous
meta-analyses.9,67 Duval & Tweedie’s trim and fill procedure
imputed four missing studies, leading to a non-significant
g = 70.09, 95% CI 70.20 to 0.02. However, Egger’s test did not
indicate any significant asymmetry of the funnel plot (P = 0.19).
Industry funding
For the 20 studies with industry funding, pharmacotherapy was
significantly more effective than psychotherapy, g= 70.11 (95%
CI 70.21 to 70.02), with low heterogeneity (I 2 = 19%) (Table
1, Fig. 2). For the 21 trials with no industry support, there were
no differences between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy,
g = 0.10 (95% CI 70.09 to 0.29), and heterogeneity was moderate
(I 2 = 73%). The difference between studies with and without
industry funding was significant (P = 0.05). In the 11 trials where
industry support was solely free medication, the difference
between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy was not significant,
g = 70.07 (95% CI 70.20 to 0.05). With their exclusion, the
pattern of results remained the same and differences between
industry
and
non-industry-funded
studies
were
significant
(P = 0.028). In analysis with outliers excluded, or including only
one comparison per study, pharmacotherapy was more effective
than psychotherapy in industry-funded trials, but the difference
between these and non-industry-funded ones was significant only
when the analyses included the comparison most favourable to
psychotherapy.
There was no indication of publication bias (online Fig. DS1)
for the studies with industry funding, neither with Duval &
Tweedie’s trim and fill procedure, nor with Egger’s test. For the
studies without industry funding, Duval & Tweedie’s trim and fill
procedure imputed four studies, leading to a non-significant
g = 70.06 (95% CI 70.27 to 0.15), but Egger’s test did not
indicate any significant asymmetry of the funnel plot.
Sensitivity analyses
These analyses partially replicated the pattern found in the main
analyses (Table 1). For the studies with industry support, there
was a small but significant difference between psychotherapy
and pharmacotherapy favouring the latter for studies with low
risk of bias on three or four of the criteria considered, studies
published from 2000 onwards, using SSRIs as medication, or
aimed at adults in general (effect sizes ranged from 70.16 to
70.07). There were no differences for studies employing CBT or
for participants with MDD. For the trials with no industry
support, there were no differences between psychotherapy and
pharmacotherapy in any of the analyses. Differences between
industry
and
non-industry-funded
studies
were
statistically
significant for studies aimed at adults in general (P = 0.033) and
for trials using SSRIs (P = 0.036).
Author financial COI
For the 15 trials where we identified at least one author as having
received financial benefits from the pharmaceutical industry, the
difference between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, favouring
pharmacotherapy,
closely
approached
statistical
significance,
g = 70.13 (95% CI 70.27 to 0.003, P= 0.054), with moderate
heterogeneity (I 2 = 51%) (Table 2, Fig. 3). In the 30 trials where
no financial COI was reported and we were unable to find any
information about it, there were no significant differences between
the two treatments, g= 0.05 (95% CI 70.08 to 0.19), and hetero-
geneity was moderate (I 2 = 60%). The difference between trials
where author financial COIs were documented and those where
they were not was close to statistical significance (P = 0.057).
Exclusion of outliers rendered differences within the trials
with authors financial COI, and between these and trials where
there was no reported COI not significant. Analyses including
only the comparison favouring psychotherapy in studies with
two comparisons showed significant differences between trials
with author COI and those with no information on this
(P = 0.037). When analyses were restricted to self-report measures,
there was a more sizable significant advantage of pharmacotherapy
over psychotherapy, g= 70.26 (95% CI 70.42 to 70.11) within

the studies with financial COI, and differences between the two
subgroups were significant (P = 0.002). We also examined COI
separately when financial support was given to the first or last
author. In studies where the first author had financial COI, the
difference
between
psychotherapy
and
pharmacotherapy,
favouring the latter, was near statistical significance (P = 0.056).
There were no significant differences for last author financial COI.
There was no indication of publication bias (online Fig. DS2)
for the studies whose authors had financial COI, neither with
Duval & Tweedie’s trim and fill procedure, nor with Egger’s test.
For the studies with no information about financial COI, the
Duval & Tweedie trim and fill procedure imputed 9 studies, leading
to a non-significant g = 70.13 (95% CI 70.28 to 0.02) and Egger’s
test indicated an asymmetrical funnel plot (P = 0.018).
Sensitivity analyses
We did not replicate the pattern found in the main analyses,
except for the trials published after 2000, where studies with
author financial COI showed a difference favouring pharmaco-
therapy over psychotherapy that was close to statistical significance
(P = 0.054). Differences between the trials with author COI and
without were borderline significant for studies on patients with
MDD (P = 0.061).
Discussion
Summary of main findings
In this meta-analysis, we included published reports of RCTs
directly comparing a psychological and a pharmacological treatment
for the acute treatment of depression and examined the potential
effects of sponsorship bias and author financial COI on these
comparisons. We focused on two types of analyses: whether one
treatment option was more effective than the other within the
subgroup of studies with industry support or where authors had
financial COI, and whether the estimations of the comparative
effectiveness of these treatments differed between studies with
industry support v. studies without, and studies where authors
had financial COI v. studies for which we did not have information
on this. Our results showed that in studies with industry support
pharmacological treatments were more effective than psychological
ones, whereas differences between the two were non-significant
for studies with no industry support. Moreover, there was a
significant difference between industry-funded v. non-industry-
funded studies. Additional analyses excluding outliers, excluding
studies where the financial support was solely as free medication,
and most sensitivity analyses looking at specific subgroups of
studies confirmed the pattern of industry-funded studies finding
pharmacotherapy more effective than psychotherapy. We also
noted that heterogeneity estimates in almost all analyses on the
industry-funded studies were small, which increases confidence
in
the robustness of
the
effect size estimation.
However,
differences between the estimates of industry sponsored and
non-industry sponsored trials were only significant in some of
the analyses and consequently the clinical relevance of the
difference we found in the industry-sponsored subgroup could
be limited and most likely does not reach the standard for a
clinically relevant effect.68
This was to be expected since both pharmacotherapy and
psychotherapy were consistently shown to be effective in the
treatment of depression9,69,70 so it would have been disconcerting
to find something other than subtle, small magnitude differences.
Still, our results corroborate previous reports71 about the
deleterious effects of sponsorship bias on treatment outcome
research, as they show a potential additional trend of industry-
funded research to favour pharmacotherapy over psychological
treatments. It is worth noting that this pattern was present even
if most studies benefited from only partial industry sponsorship.
Conversely, author financial COI, involving authors’ personal,
economic ties with the industry, may not be connected to the
financing of the trial at all, hence its relationship to outcomes

 Sponsorship bias meta-analysis
could be more complex. The most noteworthy result is that we
identified five instances where one or more of the authors of the
original article had a financial COI and had not reported it. We
were able to verify this information by looking at other published
trials involving the same authors in the same period. Studies in
which one or more of the authors had financial ties with the
industry resulted in a small and close to statistical significance
advantage of pharmacotherapy over psychotherapy. Differences
between this subgroup of trials and those for which we did not
have information about author financial COI also closely
approached statistical significance. This pattern was preserved in
some of the additional sensitivity analyses (most notably when
the financial COI was connected to the first author and when
we restricted outcomes to self-report measures), but not in
others. Clearly, the difference is small and unstable, so it is unlikely
to be clinically relevant. We underscore that we considered any
type of industry compensation, regardless of the particular
pharmaceutical company and of the type of compensation (e.g.
employment with the company, author grants, speaker fees).
Implications
Several possible mechanisms have been proposed2,8,71 and it is
likely that a constellation of factors could explain these effects,
both for industry support and for author financial COI.
Our results certainly do not establish a clear implication, of
solid clinical significance, that the presence of industry support
or that of authors with financial COI are responsible for more
favourable outcomes for an industry option (pharmacotherapy)
over a non-industry one (psychotherapy). Nonetheless, they do
raise doubt that there might be such bias at play, thus adding to
an ever-growing literature painfully pointing to the pervasiveness
of industry influences on treatment outcome research. Also, and
even more alarmingly, for financial COI, our results point to the
fact that the necessary information for evaluating such a bias
could be missing from a non-negligible portion of published trials.
A possible remedy could involve journal editorial boards taking
transparency one step further to full disclosure and asking authors
of trials involving medication as one of the treatments to declare
any and indeed all financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry,

regardless of whether they deem these relevant or not to the trial
or paper in question. The policy seems to be already effectively
enforced by some flagship journals such as the American Journal
of Psychiatry and JAMA. This measure would allow a reliable
assessment of potentially biasing effects of author financial
support from the industry.
Limitations
There are a number of limitations to this meta-analysis. As
expected, most analyses were affected by a moderate or high
degree of heterogeneity, particularly for studies without industry
funding or for those without information about author financial
COI. Moreover, whilefew, the outliers identifiedprovided estimations
very far from the pooled effect size. Higher heterogeneity and the
presence of most outliers in the no industry support/no
information about financial COI trials could have acted as a
confounding
factor
for
between-subgroup
comparisons,
particularly since the differences we found were small. We only
looked at published trials and did not attempt to identify
‘abandoned’ trials from trial registries or from investigators. We
also did not distrust what investigators declared as study funding.
A significant portion of the included studies had high or uncertain
risk of bias but, interestingly, trials with low risk of bias were still
more likely to find pharmacotherapy to be more effective than
psychotherapy.
We cannot exclude that there might be additional instances of
undisclosed financial COI that we did not uncover that could have
had an impact on the pattern of results, since an exhaustive search
of all papers published by all authors was impossible to ensure
and, particularly for older papers, our search options were more
limited. Finally, we only looked at financial COI related to the
pharmaceutical industry, but similar concerns have been recently
raised about psychotherapy. We did not examine financial COI
related to psychotherapy, such as royalties from treatment
manuals, benefits from psychotherapy training, courses or work-
shops. Whereas assessing financial COI from the pharmaceutical
industry is rather straightforward and several previous reviews
have examined it, there are no proposed or established tools or
guidelines for assessing direct financial payback from psycho-
therapy. As such, not only is there no consensus as to what should
be tallied as financial COI related to psychotherapy, but this
information is missing in most published articles,72 rendering its
possible estimates uncertain.
