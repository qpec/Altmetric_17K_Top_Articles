Background. Low and deficient levels of vitamin A are common in low- and middle-income countries where tuberculosis bur-
den is high. We assessed the impact of baseline levels of vitamin A and carotenoids on tuberculosis disease risk.
Methods. We conducted a case-control study nested within a longitudinal cohort of household contacts (HHCs) of pulmonary 
tuberculosis case patients in Lima, Peru. We defined case patients as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–negative HHCs with 
blood samples in whom tuberculosis disease developed ≥15 days after enrollment of the index patient. For each case patient, we 
randomly selected 4 controls from among contacts in whom tuberculosis disease did not develop, matching for sex and year of age. 
We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for incident tuberculosis disease by vitamin A and carotenoids levels, 
controlling for other nutritional and socioeconomic factors.
Results. Among 6751 HIV-negative HHCs with baseline blood samples, 192 had secondary tuberculosis disease during fol-
low-up. We analyzed 180 case patients with viable samples and 709 matched controls. After controlling for possible confounders, we 
found that baseline vitamin A deficiency was associated with a 10-fold increase in risk of tuberculosis disease among HHCs (adjusted 
odds ratio, 10.53; 95% confidence interval, 3.73–29.70; P < .001). This association was dose dependent, with stepwise increases in 
tuberculosis disease risk with each decreasing quartile of vitamin A level.
Conclusions. Vitamin A deficiency strongly predicted the risk of incident tuberculosis disease among HHCs of patients with 
tuberculosis. Vitamin A supplementation among individuals at high risk of tuberculosis may provide an effective means of prevent-
ing tuberculosis disease.

Although tuberculosis incidence and mortality have fallen 
steadily over the past 150 years in Europe and North America, 
tuberculosis remains one of the top global causes of death from 
infectious disease. The World Health Organization reported 
10.4 million incident tuberculosis cases and 1.8 million asso-
ciated deaths in 2015, the vast majority occurring in low- and 
middle-income countries [1]. In high-income countries, tuber-
culosis declined before the availability of either BCG vaccine 
or effective chemotherapy, a trend attributed to improvements 
in socioeconomic status [2]. Country-level data also show an 
inverse linear association between per capita gross domestic 
product and tuberculosis incidence [3] and show that a nation’s 
human development index strongly predicts changes in tuber-
culosis incidence over time [4].
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the association 
between socioeconomic status and tuberculosis may be medi-
ated through nutritional status. Studies in both humans and 
animals demonstrate a link between undernutrition and tuber-
culosis [5]. In vitro studies also provide insight into specific 
antimycobacterial mechanisms mediated by micronutrients [6, 
7]. Although multiple studies document micronutrient defi-
ciencies in persons with tuberculosis disease [8–10], few pro-
spective studies have assessed preexisting nutritional status as 
a determinant of progression from tuberculosis infection to 
disease [11–15]. Notably, studies of vitamin A and tuberculosis 
have generally been conducted in populations at low risk for 
both nutritional deficits and tuberculosis, and their results have 
been inconclusive [14, 15].
Despite the lack of data on tuberculosis risk, multiple previ-
ous studies support the role of vitamin A in immune responses

 Vitamin A and Risk of Tuberculosis Disease • CID 2017:65 (15 September) • 901
to infection. Based on studies conducted in both animals and 
humans, Green, Mellanby, and colleagues [16–18] first pro-
posed in the 1920s that vitamin A is an “anti-infective” agent. 
Subsequently, in one of the earliest reported clinical trials, 
Ellison [19] showed that vitamin A supplementation reduced 
mortality in children with measles by 58%. Current evidence 
demonstrates that vitamin A deficiency (VAD) contributes to 
deaths from diarrheal diseases and measles, accounting for 1.7% 
of all deaths in children <5 years old in low- and middle-income 
countries [20]. In the current study, we assessed the association 
between baseline levels of vitamin A and carotenoids and the 
risk of tuberculosis disease among household contacts (HHCs) 
of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Lima, Peru.
METHODS
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of Harvard School of Public Health and the Research Ethics 
Committee of the National Institute of Health of Peru. All par-
ticipants or guardians provided written informed consent.
Setting and Study Design
We conducted a case-control study nested within a prospective 
longitudinal cohort of HHCs of tuberculosis case patients in 
Lima, Peru. The study area includes approximately 3.3 million 
residents in urban areas and periurban, informal shantytown 
settlements. Between September 2009 and August 2012, we 
identified index patients aged ≥15 years with a diagnosis of pul-
monary tuberculosis at 106 participating health centers. Within 
2 weeks of enrolling an index patient, we enrolled his or her 
HHCs and screened them for tuberculosis disease. HHCs with 
symptoms were referred for sputum smear microscopy and 
mycobacteriology culture and treatment, according to Peru’s 
national guidelines [21]. HHCs aged ≤19 years and individuals 
with specified comorbid conditions were offered isoniazid pre-
ventive therapy (IPT).
On enrollment of HHCs, we collected the following data: age, 
sex, height, weight, BCG vaccination scars, IPT use, alcohol and 
tobacco use, self-reported diabetes mellitus, comorbid condi-
tions (heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma, kidney disease, 
use of steroids or chemotherapy or immunosuppressant, and any 
other self-reported chronic illness), tuberculosis disease history, 
and housing asset information. In HHCs without prior history 
of tuberculosis infection or disease, we performed a tuberculin 
skin test (TST). We offered human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) testing and invited all HHCs to provide a venous blood 
sample; 60% of those ≥10 years old provided this sample.
All HHCs were evaluated for signs and symptoms of pul-
monary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis disease at 2, 6, and 
12 months after enrollment. We considered HHCs to have inci-
dent secondary tuberculosis disease if the diagnosis was con-
firmed by a health center physician >14 days after enrollment 
of the index patient and to have coprevalent disease if the diag-
nosis was earlier. We defined secondary tuberculosis disease in 
HHCs <18 years old according to consensus guidelines for diag-
nosis of tuberculosis disease in children [22].
We defined case patients as HIV-negative HHCs in whom 
incident secondary tuberculosis disease developed during 
1 year of follow-up. We randomly selected 4 controls for each 
case patients from among HHCs in whom tuberculosis disease 
did not develop within 1 year, matching for sex and age by year.
Laboratory Methods
We stored serum samples at –80oC after collection until analysis 
at end of study follow-up. Laboratory personnel were unaware 
of the specimens’ case-control status. All samples were handled 
identically and assayed randomly. Levels of retinol and carot-
enoids (lutein + zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, total lycopene, 
α-carotene, and total β-carotene) were measured using high- 
performance liquid chromatography [23]. The interassay coef-
ficients of variation for retinol and carotenoids were <5%. We 
measured levels of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D with a commer-
cial competitive enzyme immunoassay kit (Immunodiagnostic 
Systems). The coefficient of variation at different levels of 
25-hydroxyvitamin D ranged from 4.6% to 8.7%.
Statistical Analysis
We defined VAD as a serum retinol level <200 µg/L (<0.70 
µmol/L) [24] and vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and suf-
ficiency as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of <50, 50–75, 
and >75 nmol/L, respectively [11, 25]. We calculated body mass 
index (BMI) as weight in kilograms divided by square of height 
in meters. For children and adolescent HHCs (<20 years old), 
we used World Health Organization age- and sex-specific BMI 
z-score tables to classify those with BMI z scores below –2 as 
underweight and those with z score above 2 as overweight [26]. 
For adults (≥20 years old), we classified nutritional status as: 
underweight (BMI, <18.5 kg/m2), normal (18.5 to <25 kg/m2), 
or overweight (≥25 kg/m2). We classified HHCs as heavy drink-
ers if they drank ≥40 g or ≥3 alcoholic drinks daily. We derived 
a socioeconomic status score using principal components ana-
lysis of housing asset weighted by household size [27]. We con-
sidered HHCs to be infected with tuberculosis at baseline if they 
reported previous tuberculosis disease or a positive TST or had 
a TST result ≥10 mm at enrollment.
We constructed conditional logistic regression models to 
evaluate the association between quartiles of vitamin A and 
carotenoids levels and risk of tuberculosis disease. We per-
formed tests for linear trend across quartiles. Multivariable-
adjusted models included baseline covariates identified a 
priori as potential confounders and predictors of tuberculosis 
disease (BMI, socioeconomic status, alcohol and tobacco use, 
receipt of IPT, tuberculosis disease history, comorbid disease, 
self-reported diabetes mellitus, index patient smear status, and

presence of >1 case patient in household). We also assessed the 
impact of VAD on incident tuberculosis disease and examined 
the interaction between VAD and vitamin D deficiency on 
tuberculosis disease risk. We stratified the final adjusted mod-
els by age. Under our method of control selection, odds ratios 
(ORs) approximate risk ratios because secondary tuberculosis 
disease was rare in this cohort [28].
In sensitivity analyses, we stratified by baseline tuberculosis 
infection status and separately restricted the analysis to case 
patients (and their matched controls) with diagnosis ≥90 days 
after index patient enrollment. Finally, we repeated our analyses 
for case patients (and their matched controls) with microbio-
logically confirmed tuberculosis.
RESULTS
Among 6751 HIV-negative HHCs with blood samples, tubercu-
losis disease developed in 258; disease was coprevalent in 66 and 
secondary in 192. Pulmonary disease accounted for 236 cases 
(91.5%), and extrapulmonary for 16 (6.2%). Of 180 secondary 
tuberculosis cases with viable blood samples, 147 (81.7%) were 
microbiologically confirmed (Figure 1). Table 1 shows baseline 
characteristics of case patients and controls. Case patients had 
lower baseline median levels of vitamin A and carotenoids than 
controls (Table 2). Although the pro–vitamin A carotenoids, 
β-cryptoxanthin, α-carotene, and β-carotene contribute to reti-
nol levels, we found that they were not correlated with meas-
ured retinol levels (R = 0.04–0.10). 
Table 3 demonstrates significant univariate associations 
between incident tuberculosis disease and baseline quartiles 
of vitamin A, lutein + zeaxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, total lyco-
pene, and α-carotene levels. After multivariable adjustment for 
matching factors and confounders, HHCs in the lowest quartile 
of vitamin A levels had 6 times the risk of tuberculosis disease of 
those in the highest quartile (OR, 6.38; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 2.82–14.46; P for trend < .001) [Table 3]. Lower levels of 
β-cryptoxanthin (OR for lowest vs highest quartile, 2.75; 95% 
CI, 1.42–5.33; P for trend = .003) were also associated with 
increased risk of tuberculosis disease.

 Vitamin A and Risk of Tuberculosis Disease • CID 2017:65 (15 September) • 903
Table 4 provides univariate and adjusted ORs for VAD. HHCs 
with baseline VAD had 10.53-fold increased risk of incident 
tuberculosis disease (95% CI, 3.73–29.70; P < .001). Results of 
a statistical test for interaction between vitamins A and D defi-
ciencies were not significant (P for interaction = .24; Table 5).
Stratification by age showed that VAD increased the risk 
of tuberculosis disease nearly 20-fold in 10–19-year-olds 
(adjusted OR, 18.58; 95% CI, 3.54–97.60; P = .001) and 10-fold 
in those aged ≥20 years (10.21; 2.43–42.91; P = .002) [Table 6]. 
Adolescents (aged 10–19 years) in the lowest quartile of carot-
enoid levels were at higher risk for tuberculosis disease, but 
there was no effect in older HHCs.
To rule out the possibility that VAD in case patients may 
have resulted from metabolic derangements due to early active 
tuberculosis disease that was not clinically apparent, we strati-
fied by baseline infection status and found that vitamin A levels 
remained strongly associated with tuberculosis disease in both 
groups (Table 7). In a second sensitivity analysis excluding case 
patients (and their matched controls) with disease diagnosed 
within 90 days of index patient enrollment, multivariable anal-
ysis also showed a strong inverse association between quartiles 
of vitamin A and tuberculosis disease, although the association 
with VAD was no longer statistically significant (Table 7).
Restricting the analysis to microbiologically confirmed cases 
further strengthened the association between vitamin A levels 
and tuberculosis disease (Table 8). We were unable to stratify by 
IPT use because few HHCs had received IPT.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we found that vitamin A levels strongly pre-
dict progression to tuberculosis disease in a cohort of Peruvians 
with household exposure to an index patient with tuberculosis. 
This relationship remained strong after adjustment for socioec-
onomic status, BMI, and other comorbid conditions that might 
be associated with increased tuberculosis disease risk and lower 
vitamin A levels. Although the association is most extreme

at levels consistent with a diagnosis of VAD, we observed a 
dose-response relationship with significantly increased risk of 
tuberculosis disease, even at vitamin A levels usually classified 
as normal. Carotenoids were also inversely associated with risk 
of tuberculosis progression among adolescents, although the 
effect of individual carotenoids was less extreme than for vita-
min A.
Although multiple previous studies have documented low 
vitamin A levels among patients with an active tuberculosis 
diagnosis [8, 9, 29, 30], the causal direction of this association 
has been difficult to determine. Active tuberculosis disease can 
lead to profound weight loss and metabolic disturbances, and the 
micronutrient deficiencies observed in patients often improve 
or resolve with successful tuberculosis treatment [30]. To date, 
to our knowledge, no published studies have reported on the 
impact of vitamin A supplementation on incident tuberculosis 
disease, and clinical trials have demonstrated little impact of 
supplementation on tuberculosis treatment outcomes [30].
In contrast to the plethora of work on micronutrients and 
tuberculosis treatment outcomes [30], few studies have pro-
spectively investigated the role of preexisting vitamin A sta-
tus in the development of tuberculosis disease. Cegielski et al 
[14] observed that <2% of the US-based National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey 1 cohort had baseline vitamin A 
levels <300 µg/L (<1.05 µmol/L), and tuberculosis disease devel-
oped in only 61 persons during 20 years of follow-up. Although 
tuberculosis incidence was nearly 3-fold higher among those 
with low vitamin A levels, CIs for the hazard ratio ranged from 
.70 to 11.4. These results are consistent with findings from a 
study conducted in Philadelphia between 1942 and 1949, in 
which African American men with low baseline vitamin A levels 
were 3 times more likely to develop tuberculosis disease than 
those with higher levels [15]. Interestingly, the mean vitamin A 
level was 300 µg/L (1.05 µmol/L), suggesting that the compari-
son was between men with low and very low levels, rather than 
among persons with the spectrum of levels we observed in Lima.

 Vitamin A and Risk of Tuberculosis Disease • CID 2017:65 (15 September) • 905
This study also found a very strong effect of vitamin C defi-
ciency; all in whom tuberculosis disease developed had base-
line vitamin C levels <6 mg/L (<34.07 µmol/L). Our findings are 
also consistent with those of a recent study that evaluated role 
of vitamin A in tuberculosis disease progression among HIV-
infected patients. In a cohort of HIV-infected patients from 
low- and middle-income countries, Tenforde et al [31] found 
that VAD, before initiation of antiretroviral therapy, conferred a 
5-fold increase in the risk of incident tuberculosis disease.
Multiple other lines of evidence suggest an association 
between vitamin A levels and tuberculosis risk. In vitro stud-
ies have demonstrated that vitamin A and its metabolites cause 
dose-dependent inhibition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
growth in culture [32, 33]. Experimental studies in animal and 
cell models of tuberculosis infection also provide support for 
the protective role of retinol. Although early studies in various 
models gave conflicting results [34–36], more recent studies 
in mice [37], rats [38], THP-1 cells [39], and cultured human 
macrophages [40] have shown reduced M. tuberculosis bacillary 
loads after treatment with retinoic acid. Interestingly, the dose 
of retinoic acid required to produce a protective effect in human 
macrophages is lower when it was added before infection than 
when it was added afterward [40].
Vitamin A also affects the immune system in various ways 
relevant to the pathogenesis of tuberculosis [41–43]. Most of its 
effects are exerted by retinoic acid, which binds to the nuclear 
receptors RAR and RXR to control transcriptional expression 
of numerous target genes. Among its recently recognized effects 
on immunity, retinol modulates the maturation, antigen pres-
entation, migration, and T-cell priming functions of dendritic 
cells [44–46], as well as the generation of T-regulatory cells and 
suppression of T-helper 17 cells [47]. Retinoic acid has also 
been shown to be crucial to the maintenance of the T-helper 
1 lineage [48], an essential component of an effective immune 
response to tuberculosis.
In addition to its impact on acquired immunity, vitamin 
A may also play a role in innate immune responses to M. tuber-
culosis. Wheelwright et al [6] found that all-trans-retinoic acid 
exerts an antimicrobial effect on M. tuberculosis in human 
monocytes through its effect on cellular cholesterol efflux medi-
ated through the NPC2 gene. Stimulation of primary human 
monocytes with all-trans-retinoic acid increased expression of 
NPC2 and reduced cellular cholesterol through a mechanism 
distinct from the antimicrobial activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvita-
min D3 [7]. M. tuberculosis has been shown to use host lipids 
as a nutrient source, and host cholesterol mediates M. tubercu-
losis persistence and survival within macrophages [49]. Taken

together, these findings suggest that low vitamin A levels may 
impair the host’s ability to control tuberculosis infection after 
exposure.
Carotenoids are naturally occurring pigments in fruits and 
vegetables, and 2 studies previously reported decreased tuber-
culosis risk among children and adult smokers with high intake 
of fruits and vegetables [50, 51]. To our knowledge, only 1 prior 
study has evaluated the association between carotenoid levels 
and incident tuberculosis; in that study, baseline total carote-
noid levels in HIV-positive patients receiving antiretroviral 
therapy were not associated with an increased risk of tubercu-
losis disease [31].
Our study had notable limitations. Participants were fol-
lowed up for 1 year, a relatively short period of time, given 
the slow pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Because we had rela-
tively few blood samples from children aged <10 years, we 
were unable to assess the impact of VAD in that age group. 
Almost all our study participants had been vaccinated with 
BCG, so we are unable to distinguish between the possi-
bilities that vitamin A enhanced BCG-induced adaptive

immunity or provided direct protection against tuberculo-
sis progression. Although we found no evidence of an inter-
action between vitamin A and vitamin D on tuberculosis 
disease risk, our study may not have been powered to detect 
such an interaction.
Prior studies have found that acute infections, such as pneu-
monia and rotavirus, temporarily reduce serum vitamin A levels 
[52, 53]. It is possible that HHCs recently infected with tuber-
culosis also experienced a reduction in retinol levels, and that 
process may explain our findings. A reduction in serum retinol 
levels during tuberculosis infection has not been observed in 
human studies to date, but this may be because it is challenging 
to determine exactly when individuals become infected with 
tuberculosis and to measure physiological changes occurring 
with that process.
Despite our efforts to ensure that nutritional assessments 
occurred before the development of tuberculosis disease, we could 
not rule out the possibility that participants had unrecognized 
tuberculosis disease at baseline, which may have led to the low 
retinol levels we observed. We addressed this issue by conduct-
ing 2 sensitivity analyses, the first stratified on baseline infection 
status and the second excluded cases diagnosed within 90 days of 
index patient enrollment. In both analyses, the risk of tuberculo-
sis disease remained inversely associated with vitamin A quartiles 
regardless of baseline tuberculosis infection status or timing of 
diagnosis. Because active tuberculosis may remain clinically unde-
tected for months, especially in children, there is no way to rule 
out reverse causality without conducting a clinical trial of vitamin 
A supplementation in persons at high risk for tuberculosis.
In conclusion, we find that vitamin A levels among per-
sons exposed at home to a patient with tuberculosis strongly 
predicted incident tuberculosis disease within 12 months of 
follow-up, in a dose-dependent manner. Our data raise the 
possibility that screening for vitamin A levels among persons 
at high risk for tuberculosis could help identify those in whom 
disease is likely to develop in the near future so they could be 
targeted for early intervention. In the event that the association 
between VAD and tuberculosis progression proves to be causal, 
routine vitamin A supplementation among persons at high risk
