Background and Purpose—The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 (interleukin-1) has a deleterious role in cerebral ischemia, 
which is attenuated by IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). IL-1 induces peripheral inflammatory mediators, such as 
interleukin-6, which are associated with worse prognosis after ischemic stroke. We investigated whether subcutaneous 
IL-1Ra reduces the peripheral inflammatory response in acute ischemic stroke.
Methods—SCIL-STROKE (Subcutaneous Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist in Ischemic Stroke) was a single-center, 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of subcutaneous IL-1Ra (100 mg administered twice daily 
for 3 days) in patients presenting within 5 hours of ischemic stroke onset. Randomization was stratified for baseline 
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and thrombolysis. Measurement of plasma interleukin-6 and other 
peripheral inflammatory markers was undertaken at 5 time points. The primary outcome was difference in concentration 
of log(interleukin-6) as area under the curve to day 3. Secondary outcomes included exploratory effect of IL-1Ra on 
3-month outcome with the modified Rankin Scale.
Results—We recruited 80 patients (mean age, 72 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 12) of whom 
73% received intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase. IL-1Ra significantly reduced plasma interleukin-6 (P<0.001) and 
plasma C-reactive protein (P<0.001). IL-1Ra was well tolerated with no safety concerns. Allocation to IL-1Ra was not 
associated with a favorable outcome on modified Rankin Scale: odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=0.67 (0.29–1.52), 
P=0.34. Exploratory mediation analysis suggested that IL-1Ra improved clinical outcome by reducing inflammation, but 
there was a statistically significant, alternative mechanism countering this benefit.
Conclusions—IL-1Ra reduced plasma inflammatory markers which are known to be associated with worse clinical outcome 
in ischemic stroke. Subcutaneous IL-1Ra is safe and well tolerated. Further experimental studies are required to investigate 
efficacy and possible interactions of IL-1Ra with thrombolysis.

nflammation is a major contributor to the pathophysiol-
ogy and outcome of cerebral ischemia. The proinflam-
matory cytokine IL-1 (interleukin-1) is upregulated rapidly 
in experimental stroke and worsens ischemic injury in pre-
clinical models of cerebral ischemia.1 IL-1 induces peripheral 
inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), which 
are associated with worse prognosis after ischemic stroke.2 
The endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) blocks all 
known actions of IL-1 by competitively inhibiting the IL-1 
receptor 1, without any reported agonist activity.3 IL-1Ra 
markedly attenuates experimental brain injury in experimen-
tal cerebral ischemia, showing efficacy in aged and comorbid 
animals, when administered peripherally by subcutaneous or 
intravenous routes and with delayed administration.1 The effi-
cacy of IL-1Ra in experimental middle cerebral artery occlu-
sion has been reproduced in a cross-laboratory study using a 
SCIL-STROKE (Subcutaneous Interleukin-1 Receptor 
Antagonist in Ischemic Stroke)

range of outcome measures, including longer-term functional 
recovery.4 A recently updated meta-analysis of preclinical 
stroke studies showed that IL-1Ra treatment reduced infarct 
volume by 36% in pooled data from 1283 animals.5
We have reported previously that intravenous IL-1Ra admin-
istered for 72 hours in a placebo-controlled phase 2 study of 
patients with acute stroke was safe and significantly reduced 
plasma inflammatory markers.6 Intravenous IL-1Ra penetrated 
cerebrospinal fluid at experimentally therapeutic concentrations 
in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage 
(aSAH)7,8 and reduced cerebrospinal fluid and plasma IL-6 con-
centrations.9 IL-1Ra is now available as a commercial subcu-
taneous formulation used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, which 
is cheaper and more practical to administer. After pharmacoki-
netic modeling of subcutaneous treatment, based on therapeutic 
concentrations of intravenous IL-Ra, we recently undertook a 
phase 2 trial of subcutaneous IL-1Ra in acute aSAH in which 
subcutaneous IL-1Ra was safe and significantly reduced plasma 
IL-6 and CRP (C-reactive protein) concentrations.10
Our previous trial of intravenous IL-1Ra in ischemic stroke 
was undertaken before the UK license and therefore wide-
spread clinical use of alteplase in the United Kingdom. In the 
present study, we investigated whether subcutaneous IL-1Ra 
reduces the peripheral inflammatory response in acute isch-
emic stroke, alongside standard of care thrombolysis when 
clinically indicated. Our primary objective was to determine 
the effect of subcutaneous IL-1Ra on plasma IL-6 to day 3. 
Secondary objectives included obtaining exploratory clinical 
outcome data to inform subsequent phase 3 trial design.
Methods
In line with American Heart Association Journals’ implementation of 
the Transparency and Openness Promotion, the data that support the 
findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on 
reasonable request.
Design and Setting
SCIL-STROKE (Subcutaneous Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist 
in Ischemic Stroke) was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial undertaken at the Greater 
Manchester Comprehensive Stroke Centre at Salford Royal National 
Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust. Approvals were obtained 
from Greater Manchester South NHS Research Ethics Committee, 
the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and 
Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust Research and Development.
Participants
Full eligibility criteria are presented in Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Patients presenting with confirmed ischemic stroke, 
aged ≥18 years, with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
score between 4 and 26, and within 5 hours of symptom onset were 
eligible. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, drug his-
tory, routine blood tests, and computed tomography head were under-
taken as part of urgent clinical assessment and informed eligibility 
screening. Hyperacute research practitioners recruited participants 
between 0700 and 2100 7 days a week although a screening log was 
kept of all potentially eligible patients. If capacity to consent to par-
ticipation was absent, consent was sought from a personal consultee 
if available or a professional consultee (a senior clinician indepen-
dent of the study). Baseline assessment was then completed, includ-
ing past medical history, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) in the month 
preceding ictus, vascular risk factors, and vital signs.
Intervention
Participants received 6 doses of either 100 mg subcutaneous recombi-
nant human IL-1Ra (anakinra) or placebo. The first dose was started 
within 6 hours of symptom onset. Five further doses were adminis-
tered starting at the next administration time point (0700 or 1900±2 
hours), at least 6 hours after the first dose and continued every 12 
hours until completion of the 6 doses. This regimen was derived from 
pharmacokinetic model and tolerability data from Amgen, Inc, subse-
quently validated in our subcutaneous IL-1Ra trial in aSAH.10
Randomization and Blinding
Randomization (1:1) was undertaken using an independent third-
party, web-based service, stratified for stroke severity (National 
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale <13 or ≥13) and intravenous 
thrombolysis.
Venous Blood for Plasma Inflammatory Markers
Venous blood was drawn before consent in potentially eligible 
patients, supported by our regulatory approvals, to avoid delays in 
obtaining the baseline prerandomization sample (day 0). This sample 
was discarded if patients were not included. Blood was also drawn on 
days 1, 2, 3, and between days 5 to 7. The day 5 to 7 sample was dis-
continued after blinded review by the Trial Steering Committee after 
recruitment of the first 58 participants as it had only been obtained 
in 51% of participants (largely because of participant repatriation to 
their base hospital after day 3).
Processing and Analyses of Blood Samples
Venous blood was processed and analyzed at Salford Royal NHS 
Foundation Trust. Blood was collected in EDTA, centrifuged at 2000g 
at 4°C for 15 minutes, and the plasma frozen at −70°C. Plasma IL-6 
and IL-1Ra were measured using ELISA, and CRP and von-Wille-
brand Factor (vWF) were measured in a duplex assay using Luminex 
bead technology (see online-only Data Supplement). Laboratory staff 
were blinded to treatment allocation, except for the individual mea-
suring plasma IL-1Ra. The concentrations of IL-6, CRP, and vWF 
were transformed using the natural logarithm before analysis.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the area under the curve for the 
log-transformed concentration of plasma IL-6 between day 1 and day 
3. Only participants with a prerandomization sample (day 0) and at 
least 2 of the 3 subsequent blood samples (day 1, 2, or 3) were eligible 
for the primary analysis. Laboratory secondary outcomes were the 
area under the curve for plasma log(CRP) and log(vWF). Clinical 
blood tests and other investigations were undertaken at the discre-
tion of the clinical team and reviewed by the research team. Serious 
adverse events and adverse events were recorded daily to day 3 and 
also at day 30 (±7 days). All brain imaging was reported by neuro-
radiologists independent of the study, who were blinded to test treat-
ment allocation. Hemorrhagic transformation was classified using the 
European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study criteria,11 that is, hemor-
rhagic infarction 1 or 2 and parenchymal hemorrhage 1 or 2. The 
clinical secondary outcome was the mRS at 3 months, undertaken by 
a single, trained rater blinded to treatment allocation, either face-to-
face or by telephone.
Sample Size
Our previous phase 2 trial of intravenous IL-1Ra in patients with 
acute ischemic stroke showed a difference (SD) in log(CRP) of 0.8 
(1.0) at 3 days.6 Based on these data, 30 patients were required per 
group for 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect a differ-
ence of 0.75 SD in the primary outcome. We, therefore, aimed to 
recruit up to 80 patients in total to allow for loss to follow-up. We 
also considered that complete 3-month mRS data on 50 participants 
would be adequate for estimation of parameters to inform a phase 3 
sample size calculation.

Statistical Methods
All analyses were prespecified in a statistical analysis plan before study 
completion and unblinding of the data set. Demographic and clinical 
data at baseline were tabulated by allocated test treatment. The pri-
mary analysis used linear regression to control for the randomization 
stratification criteria and for the baseline value of log(IL-6). Where 
one of the day 1 to day 3 blood samples was unavailable, imputation 
was undertaken. The fitted value from linear regression of log(IL-6) 
on “day” was substituted for the missing value. The assumption of 
linearity for this time period was assessed graphically but was antici-
pated to be reasonable based on our previous aSAH study data. These 
linear regression analyses were repeated for plasma CRP and vWF but 
adjusting each for its own baseline value. Ordinal logistic regression 
was used to analyze mRS, adjusting for the stratification variables. We 
also undertook mediation analysis to explore the hypothesized causal 
pathway from treatment (IL-1Ra) through mediator (area under the 
curve log[IL-6]) to outcome (mRS).12 As this method is not yet devel-
oped for ordinal outcomes, we first dichotomized the mRS as 0 to 2 
versus 3 to 6. All analyses were undertaken in Stata version 14.
Results
Of 742 patients screened between March 22, 2014, and 
October 31, 2016, 207 met the eligibility criteria. Of these, 
118 were approached and 80 (68%) were recruited (Figure 1). 
One patient deteriorated rapidly after randomization (to 
IL-1Ra) and was withdrawn before receiving any test treat-
ment. Baseline characteristics of the recruited patients are 
shown in the Table. Although the majority of participants 
(73%) received intravenous alteplase, the onset to needle time 
was shorter in the placebo group. The interval from stroke 
onset to initiation of test treatment was not different between 
the 2 allocation groups.
Sixty-three participants (n=35 placebo; n=28 IL-1Ra) had 
sufficient blood samples for the primary analysis (Figure 1), 
thereby meeting our planned sample size. IL-1Ra prevented 
the rise in plasma IL-6 concentrations observed in the placebo 
group (Figure 2A) and significantly reduced the area under 
the curve plasma log(IL-6; Figure 3A) in the adjusted linear 
regression analyses (P<0.001; Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Post hoc sensitivity analyses taking into account 
imputation, and its potential interaction with the treatment 
effect, made no substantive difference to these findings (Table 
III in the online-only Data Supplement). A similar effect of 
IL-1Ra treatment was observed for plasma CRP concentra-
tions (Figures 2B and 3B; Table IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement), but there was no observed difference in plasma 
vWF concentrations (Figures 2C and 3C).
There were 16 serious adverse events in 14 patients (11 
serious adverse events in 9 allocated placebo and 5 serious 
adverse events in 5 allocated IL-1Ra) and 22 adverse events 
in 19 patients (14 adverse events in 12 allocated placebo and 
8 adverse events in 7 allocated IL-1Ra; Table V in the online-
only Data Supplement). Hemorrhagic transformation occurred 
in 6 patients allocated IL-1Ra (hemorrhagic infarction 1 in 1; 
parenchymal hemorrhage 1 in 2; parenchymal hemorrhage 
2 in 3) and 4 allocated placebo (hemorrhagic infarction 1 in 
2; parenchymal hemorrhage 1 in 2). There were 9 systemic 
infections in the placebo group compared with 3 in the IL-1Ra 
group (for pneumonia or chest infection, 7 versus 1). There 
were no reported injection-site reactions.
Final 3-month mRS was available in 75 participants 
(94%). Mortality was similar between the allocation groups 
(Figure 1). More participants achieved a 3-month mRS of 0 
to 2 in the placebo group (51%) compared with the IL-1Ra 
group (42%; Figure IA in the online-only Data Supplement). 
In the adjusted ordinal logistic regression analyses, allocation 
to IL-1Ra was not associated with a favorable outcome on the 
mRS: odds ratio (95% confidence interval)=0.67 (0.29–1.52), 
P=0.34. Further adjustment for prestroke mRS and throm-
bolysis onset to needle time in the regression model did not 
materially alter these findings (data not shown).
The mediation analysis (Figure 4) suggested that while tak-
ing baseline plasma IL-6 concentrations into account, IL-1Ra

reduced the odds of a poor mRS outcome via the expected 
mechanism of reducing plasma IL-6 (odds ratio [95% con-
fidence interval]=0.42 [0.19–0.94]; P=0.04). By contrast, 
there was a negative residual effect, in that IL-1Ra increased 
the odds of a poor mRS score (odds ratio [95% confidence 
interval]=4.58 [1.19–17.71]; P=0.03) by some other pathway 
or mechanism. Given that the majority of patients received 
thrombolysis, we undertook further post hoc analyses adjust-
ing the mediation approach for additional covariates, including 
baseline severity and thrombolysis in various categorizations 
(eg, early versus late). None of these exploratory analyses 
substantively affected the findings.
Discussion
IL-1 mediates inflammatory and immune responses in both 
the central nervous system and periphery which are strongly 
implicated in cerebral ischemic injury and clinical outcome.1 
As downstream biomarkers of IL-1 induction, elevated 
plasma IL-6 and CRP concentrations are consistently predic-
tive of poor clinical outcome in the acute phase of ischemic 
stroke.2,13,14 Here, we have shown that treatment with subcu-
taneous IL-1Ra in hyperacute ischemic stroke significantly 
reduced plasma concentrations of IL-6 and CRP for the first 
3 days. These findings are consistent with reduced concentra-
tions of these plasma inflammatory markers observed in our 
previous studies of subcutaneous IL-1Ra in aSAH10 and intra-
venous IL-1Ra in acute stroke and aSAH.6,9 To our knowledge, 
such robust and consistent reduction of downstream peripheral 
inflammatory markers has not been demonstrated with other 
candidate anti-inflammatory drugs for acute stroke.15
The mechanisms by which peripherally administered 
IL-1Ra reduces plasma IL-6 concentrations are yet to be 
fully characterized. IL-1 and IL-6 are upregulated rapidly in 
the ischemic hemisphere after middle cerebral artery occlu-
sion,16–18 and their concentrations are elevated acutely in the 
cerebrospinal fluid of patients with ischemic stroke.19 Elevated 
plasma IL-6 concentrations precede those in the ischemic 
hemisphere in experimental middle cerebral artery occlu-
sion,20 yet production of IL-1 and IL-6 by peripheral blood 
leucocytes within hours of stroke onset is negligible.21 Hence, 
as yet undetermined, peripheral cellular sources may produce 
IL-6 in response to cerebral ischemia. Peripherally admin-
istered IL-1Ra crosses the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier 
and blood–brain barrier after SAH,22 and it is, therefore, likely 
that subcutaneous IL-1Ra reduces plasma IL-6 by inhibiting 
its induction by IL-1 both in the ischemic brain and in the 
peripheral circulation.
We were surprised to observe a 95% confidence interval for 
clinical outcome that excluded a major benefit of treatment 
with IL-1Ra. This contrasts with our previous studies both 
of subcutaneous IL-1Ra in aSAH and intravenous IL-1Ra in 
stroke. Indeed, IL-1Ra in aSAH has now progressed to a mul-
ticenter phase 3 trial (NCT03249207). A post hoc individual 
participant data meta-analysis combining our present data in 
ischemic stroke patients with our previous phase 2 trial inves-
tigating intravenous IL-1Ra in a similar population (Figure II 
in the online-only Data Supplement) did not alter this conclu-
sion. Although differences in the distribution of mRS scores 
between IL-1Ra and placebo were observed when comparing 
the previous intravenous trial and present subcutaneous trial 
(Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement), these should 
be interpreted cautiously as secondary analyses in relatively 
small sample sizes.
We used mediation analysis, which to our knowledge is a 
novel approach in acute stroke trials. The mediation analy-
sis suggested that IL-1Ra improved the odds of a favorable 
clinical outcome by reducing plasma IL-6 concentrations 
(the mediator variable), indicative of upstream IL-1 block-
ade, as expected. However, the mediation analysis revealed 
an additional, residual negative pathway with IL-1Ra treat-
ment, contributing to overall clinical outcome. Although these 
exploratory secondary analyses need to be interpreted with 
caution, they are useful in hypothesis generation when con-
sidering future studies of IL-1Ra in ischemic stroke. Similar 
mediation analyses in our recent aSAH trial also confirmed a 
favorable effect of IL-1Ra on clinical outcome through lower-
ing plasma IL-6 concentrations but with no residual negative 
effect. Similarly, reanalysis of our intravenous IL-1Ra in stroke 
study (data not published) did not suggest any residual effect. 
One clear difference is that this is the first of our IL-1Ra studies 
in which thrombolysis has been administered. The importance 
of potential interactions between candidate treatments and 
thrombolysis in acute stroke trials has previously been high-
lighted.23 Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) has a range

of deleterious effects in cerebral ischemia, several of which 
are independent of its fibrinolytic activity.24 There are few data 
on combined treatment with IL-1Ra plus tPA in preclinical 
studies of ischemic stroke,4 but there is no suggestion of any 
adverse interaction. IL-1Ra might be expected to augment the 
beneficial effects of tPA treatment by reducing the deleterious 
effects of reperfusion injury, tPA-induced neurotoxicity, and 
neuroinflammation.25,26 Conversely, IL-1 increases levels of 
endogenous plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,27 the principal 
physiological inhibitor of tPA. IL-1 blockade combined with 
tPA in ischemic stroke could, therefore, potentiate excessive 
fibrinolysis or other deleterious effects. We observed no dif-
ferences in hemorrhagic transformation, but as this is a rela-
tively small sample size, a difference cannot be excluded from 
our present data. Finally, the transcription factor high mobil-
ity group box-1, which is upregulated rapidly after cerebral 
ischemia,28 augments tPA-induced fibrinolysis and protects 
against tPA-induced neurotoxicity and blood–brain barrier 
damage in experimental stroke.29 As IL-1 upregulates high 
mobility group box-1 in mononuclear cells,30 IL-1 blockade 
might impact negatively on these apparent protective effects 
of high mobility group box-1 in the setting of thrombolysis 
with tPA.
Our study has several strengths. It was designed in line with 
consensus recommendations for phase 2 clinical trials of can-
didate drugs for acute ischemic stroke.31,32 Our dosing regimen 
was based on robust pharmacokinetic modeling and known 
preclinical therapeutic concentrations. A relevant surrogate 
outcome measure was selected for the primary outcome, mea-
sured using well-established methods and confirming proof 
of concept. Our design allowed us to test IL-1Ra alongside 
thrombolysis with intravenous alteplase to explore combi-
nation therapy.23,32 We achieved our planned sample size for 
the primary analyses and used ordinal analysis of the mRS 
secondary outcome. Mediation analysis enabled hypothesis 
generation to inform future experimental and clinical studies.

We also acknowledge several limitations of our trial. 
Recruitment was limited to a single center which may have 
implications for generalizability. Inclusion of patients receiv-
ing intravenous thrombolysis as part of urgent clinical care 
is likely to have introduced inevitable delays in administra-
tion of test treatment. However, although onset to test treat-
ment was on average 4.4 hours, we still observed significant 
reductions in plasma IL-6. Our study design did not include 
evaluation of pre- and post-treatment angiography to deter-
mine site of arterial occlusion and whether spontaneous or 
fibrinolytic reperfusion occurred in the context of allocation 
to IL-1Ra or placebo. Likewise, we did not undertake pre- 
and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate 
infarct expansion, edema, or infarct volume. These may have 
provided useful insights in secondary analyses although 
interpretation is likely to have been limited given our rela-
tively small sample size. Our regional clinical service model 
meant that some participating patients were repatriated to 
their local hospital before completion of blood sampling, 
which limited availability of the day 5 to 7 sample. Finally, 
the mediation analyses were necessarily restricted to those 
patients with sufficient plasma IL-6, which limited sample 
size further.
Summary
We have demonstrated that subcutaneous IL-1Ra signifi-
cantly reduced plasma inflammatory markers that are known 
to be associated with a worse outcome after ischemic stroke. 
In hypothesis-generating mediation analyses, subcutaneous 
IL-1Ra positively influenced outcome by the expected mech-
anism of reducing plasma concentrations of IL-6, but there 
was a residual negative effect that may represent an interac-
tion with alteplase. Further experimental stroke studies are 
required to fully investigate efficacy and mechanisms of 
IL-1Ra in the presence of thrombolytic agents.
