ABSTRACT
Aims
To test whether reducing the standard serving size of alcoholic beverages would reduce voluntary alcohol con-
sumption in a laboratory (study 1) and a real-world drinking environment (study 2). Additionally, we modelled the poten-
tial public health benefit of reducing the standard serving size of on-trade alcoholic beverages in the United Kingdom.
Design
Studies 1 and 2 were cluster-randomized experiments. In the additional study, we used the Sheffield Alcohol Pol-
icy Model to estimate the number of deaths and hospital admissions that would be averted per year in the United Kingdom
if a policy that reduces alcohol serving sizes in the on-trade was introduced. Setting
A semi-naturalistic laboratory
(study 1), a bar in Liverpool, UK (study 2). Participants
Students and university staff members (study 1: n = 114, mean
age = 24.8 years, 74.6% female), residents from local community (study 2: n = 164, mean age = 34.9 years, 57.3% fe-
male). Interventions and comparators
In study 1, participants were assigned randomly to receive standard or reduced
serving sizes (by 25%) of alcohol during a laboratory drinking session. In study 2, customers at a bar were served alcohol in
either standard or reduced serving sizes (by 28.6–33.3%). Measurements
Outcome measures were units of alcohol
consumed within 1 hour (study 1) and up to 3 hours (study 2). Serving size condition was the primary predictor.
Findings
In study 1, a 25% reduction in alcohol serving size led to a 20.7–22.3% reduction in alcohol consumption.
In study 2, a 28.6–33.3% reduction in alcohol serving size led to a 32.4–39.6% reduction in alcohol consumption. Model-
ling results indicated that decreasing the serving size of on-trade alcoholic beverages by 25% could reduce the number of
alcohol-related hospital admissions and deaths per year in the United Kingdom by 4.4–10.5% and 5.6–13.2%, respec-
tively. Conclusions
Reducing the serving size of alcoholic beverages in the United Kingdom appears to lead to a reduction
in alcohol consumption within a single drinking occasion.

INTRODUCTION
Alcohol consumption contributes to premature death
and ill health [1], and alcohol-related harm places a
substantial burden on society [2]. Approximately 25%
of alcohol consumers in England drink at higher-risk
levels, and 20% of high-risk drinkers attempt to reduce
their alcohol consumption [3]. However, attempts to
cut down do not lead often to actual reductions in
alcohol consumption [4,5]. Therefore, changes to the
environment
that
make
it
easier
for
people
to
drink less could have a substantial impact on public
health [6,7].
One potential environmental influence on alcohol
consumption that is yet to be examined is serving size. Nu-
trition research shows consistently that portion sizes affect
how much a person eats [8,9]. People eat more if they are
given a relatively large portion of food compared to smaller
portions, but they do not fully compensate for this byeating
less afterwards [10]. Similarly, people drink more if they are
served a large non-alcoholic beverage with their meal
compared to a smaller serving of that beverage [11,12].
There is a small amount of evidence indicating that
the way that alcohol is served may affect drinking be-
haviour. A field study showed that the size of glass that
people drink from may affect wine consumption [13],

 although this finding was not replicated fully at another
venue [14]. However, the effect that alcoholic beverage
serving size has on alcohol consumption has not been
examined. Given that serving size has a robust effect on
food intake, and consumers do not appear to compensate
later for changes in food serving size, we hypothesized that
the serving size of alcohol beverages may have a causal
effect on voluntary alcohol consumption. If alcoholic
beverage serving size does indeed have a causal influence
on alcohol consumption, then reductions to standard
serving sizes could be an effective way of decreasing
population-level alcohol consumption and harm.
We aimed to investigate if reducing the serving size of
alcoholic beverages would reduce alcohol consumption.
In study 1, participants consumed alcohol from standard
versus reduced serving sizes in a laboratory setting. The
aims were to (1) compare total alcohol consumption from
reduced servings and standard servings and (2) test
whether there were any differences in the perceived ‘nor-
mality’ of the provided serving size between conditions. In
study 2, participants consumed alcohol from standard ver-
sus reduced serving sizes in a local bar and subsequently
reported any alcohol consumption that occurred after the
study finished in order to examine whether participants
compensated for the reduced serving sizes at later drinking
occasions. The aims were to (1) compare total alcohol con-
sumption from reduced servings with standard servings
and (2) test whether there were any group differences in
self-reported alcohol consumption after the intervention
period. We then used the findings from studies 1 and 2 to
inform modelling of the effect of reductions in the serving
size of on-trade alcoholic beverages on alcohol-related
harm using the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model (SAPM)
[15]. The aim was to estimate reductions in alcohol-
attributable deaths and hospital admissions as a result of
serving size reductions.
STUDY 1
METHODS
Design
Pairs of participants attended a laboratory session, and
both members of the pairs were randomized to receive
alcoholic beverages in standard versus reduced serving
sizes. Ad libitum alcohol consumption was measured dur-
ing the course of 1 hour. We used cluster-randomization
to ensure that participants were blind to the experimental
manipulation. We aimed to recruit a minimum of 50 par-
ticipants per condition to have sufficient power to detect a
medium to large effect size (d = 0.57) in a two-tailed t-test
(α = 0.05) at 80% power, based on the effect sizes re-
ported by Zlatevska et al. [8]. We did not account formally
for potential clustering in our sample size calculation,
but we recruited slightly over the required minimum to
increase power.
Participants
One hundred and fourteen participants were recruited in
pairs (57 pairs) from students and staff of the University
of Liverpool. Participant pairs knew each other and were
eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, consumed alco-
hol regularly (at least 10 UKunits per week; 1 UKunit = 8 g
of ethanol) and had a breath alcohol content (BAC) of zero
upon arrival in the laboratory
. Pairs were not constrained
with regard to their gender composition. However, after
testing 102 participants, there appeared to be a gender
imbalance throughout conditions. We then stratified
randomization by the pairs’ gender composition for the re-
maining participants to attenuate the gender imbalance.
The study received ethical approval from the University of
Liverpool ethics committee. Testing took place between
July 2015 and March 2016.
Serving size
Pairs of participants were assigned randomly to a stan-
dard serving size condition or a reduced serving size
condition (between-subjects). Participants had access to
three types of alcoholic beverage: Magners cider [4.5%
alcohol by volume (ABV)], Sol lager (4.5% ABV) and Isla
Negra Sauvignon Blanc white wine (12.5% ABV). The
beverages
in
the
standard
serving
size
condition
contained 2.07 units per serving, which is equivalent to
a typical UK serving of beer or wine. Beverages in the re-
duced serving size condition contained 1.55 units (a 25%
reduction). See Table 1 for volume served and glassware
capacity for the different drink types. The glasses used in
the two conditions were of the same shape and width
(Fig. 1), which resulted in glasses looking comparably full
in both conditions.

 Procedure and measures
The experiment took place on weekdays between 12:00
and 17:30 hours in a semi-naturalistic laboratory de-
signed to mimic a home environment that included a
sofa, soft furnishings and a television. Participants were
told that they were taking part in a study examining
how social drinking affects opinions. After providing in-
formed consent, participants’ blood alcohol content
(BAC) and body weight were measured. Pairs of partic-
ipants were allocated randomly to the serving size con-
dition. The researcher was not blind to allocation.
Participants were asked to order one alcoholic beverage
at the start of the study and consume at least some of
it. After this, they could order more beverages at any
time during the study by pressing a serving button to
notify the experimenter. To prevent adverse events, the
experimenter monitored participants’ alcohol consump-
tion via webcam to ensure that participants consumed
no more than 0.8 g of alcohol per kg of body weight.
After
participants
ordered
their
first
beverage,
to
corroborate the cover story they completed an attitudes
questionnaire
on
religion
and
human
rights.
The
experimenter then began showing a 1-hour TV pro-
gramme on religion and human rights [16]. Thirty
minutes
into
the
programme,
the
experimenter
returned
with
another
attitudes
questionnaire
and
asked whether participants would like another beverage.
After 1 hour, the experimenter returned with a final
attitudes questionnaire. Participants then completed a
questionnaire battery with (1) an open-ended question
to assess what participants thought the aims of the
study were; (2) two 5-point Likert items to investigate
whether participants considered their own alcohol con-
sumption during the study and the provided serving
size to be ‘normal’ (anchors ‘strongly disagree’ and
‘strongly agree’); (3) the Restrict subscale of the Temp-
tation and Restraint Inventory (TRI [17]) as a measure
of motivation to reduce drinking; (4) the Alcohol Use Disor-
ders Identification Test (AUDIT [18]) as a measure of
hazardous drinking; and (5) a single item to assess weekly
alcohol consumption in UKunits. Finally, participants were
thanked and debriefed. Each session lasted approximately
1.5 hours and participants received shopping vouchers
for £10 or course credit as reimbursement for their time.
All participants completed the study
.
Data analysis
We calculated how much beer, cider and wine partici-
pants consumed by subtracting the volume of any left-
over beverage from the amount of beverages that were
ordered. The total alcohol consumption in UK units
was calculated by multiplying the volume consumed of
each beverage type (in litres) with the beverages’ ABV
.
Alcohol consumption was distributed normally. We used
multi-level regression modelling to evaluate the amount
of alcohol consumed across conditions, while controlling
for data clustering within participant pairs. To investi-
gate whether the effect of serving size on alcohol
consumption was robust, we also controlled for gender
(between-subjects factor), AUDIT scores and TRI Restrict
scores (covariates), because these covariates are likely to
influence alcohol consumption. Finally, we used multi-
level regression modelling to evaluate perceived normal-
ity of the serving size and the amount of alcohol that
participants consumed across conditions. All analyses
were conducted in SPSS version 24 [19]. Analyses not
accounting for clustering are reported in the Supporting
information, Tables S1 and S2.

 modelling showed a non-significant reduction in alco-
hol consumption attributed to the reduced serving size
condition [B = �0.80 (�1.69, 0.09), standard error
(SE) = 0.44, t(57) = 1.80, P = 0.08]. However, this

show
that
participants
in
the reduced serving size
condition drank 20.7–22.3% less alcohol than participants
in the standard serving size condition (Supporting informa-
tion, Table S3, Fig. 2).
Perceived normality of serving size
On average, participants considered the provided serving
sizes and the amount of alcohol that they consumed to be
relatively ‘normal’ (average score greater than 3 out of 5).
There was a trend for participants to perceive the smaller
servings as less normal [B = �0.35 (�0.77, 0.06),
SE = 0.21, t(57) = 1.70, P = 0.10], but participants in both
conditions perceived their own alcohol consumption
during the study as comparably normal [B = �0.11
(�0.53, 0.30), SE = 0.21, t(57) = 0.54, P = 0.59]. See
Table 4 for estimated means.

 STUDY 2
We conducted study 2 to investigate the effect of serving
size over a longer drinking period in a real-world drinking
environment.
METHODS
Design
Participants attended one of four quiz nights in a bar in
the centre of Liverpool. We allocated nights randomly so
that
standard-sized
beverages
would
be
served
on
2 nights and reduced-sized beverages on 2 nights. The
unadjusted analysis in study 1 showed a medium effect
size (d = 0.45, Supporting information, Table S1). Based
on this, we needed a sample size of n = 128 to detect a
medium
effect
(d
=
0.50)
in
a
two-tailed
t-test
(α = 0.05) with 80% power. To allow for dropouts
and no-shows, we recruited up to the bar’s capacity
(n = 50 per night, total n = 200). We used a cluster-
randomized design to ensure that participants were
blind to the experimental manipulation. We measured
how much alcohol participants consumed during the
quiz (up to 3 hours) and participants later self-reported
any further alcohol consumption during the same
evening. This permitted us to examine whether any
reduction in alcohol consumption was subsequently
compensated for.
Participants
One hundred and sixty-six participants attended one of
the quiz nights. Participants were recruited in teams of
two to five participants from the Liverpool area (e.g. on
local social media pages, local radio, mailing lists from
local organizations). Participants were eligible to take
part if they were aged 18 years or older. The study
received ethical approval from the University of Liverpool
ethics committee. Testing took place in April and
May 2017.
Serving size manipulation
Quiz nights were assigned to a standard serving size
condition or a reduced serving size condition in a
counterbalanced order. Four types of beer/cider (average
4.85% ABV) and three types of wine (average 12% ABV)
were available to purchase each night. On nights allocated
to the standard serving size condition, beer and cider were
served in non-branded pint glasses (568 ml; 2.75 UK
units/serving) and wine was served in 175-ml servings
in medium wine glasses (2.19 UK units/serving). On
nights allocated to the reduced serving size condition, beer
and cider were served in non-branded ⅔ pint glasses
(379 ml; 1.84 UK units/serving) and wine in 125-ml
servings in small wine glasses (1.50 UK units/serving).
Participants could also order a variety of soft drinks, which
were served in the same type of glass as beer and cider.
The cost of each beverage was proportional to serving size
and displayed near the bar.
Observing alcohol consumption
Researchers recorded individual participants’ alcohol con-
sumption covertly during the quiz. Additionally, one mem-
ber of staff serving at the bar and one researcher recorded
the total number of beverages that were sold on each night
and the amount of wastage. All observers were aware of
the study hypotheses. See Supporting information for a de-
tailed description of observation methods.
Procedure
The study and analysis protocol was registered at http://
osf.io/2tmu6 prior to data collection. Testing took place
in the function room of a local bar on Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings between 19:30 and 22:30 hours.
To obscure the real aims of the study, participants were
informed that they would be taking part in a study
investigating how personality characteristics affected
group performance in a quiz. Upon arrival, participants
gave verbal consent, provided their age and gender and
completed
a
short
bogus
personality
questionnaire.

 Participants were asked to purchase beverages only from
the private bar in the function room and not from the bar’s
main area.1 The quiz lasted approximately 1 hour and 40 -
minutes (see Supporting information). Participants could
arrive up to 30 minutes prior to the quiz and were asked
to leave 45 minutes after the quiz ended (a minimum of
1 hour and 40 minutes and a maximum of 3 hours to
order and consume beverages).
The following day, participants completed an online
questionnaire that included the AUDIT-C [20] as a mea-
sure of typical alcohol consumption. Participants also re-
ported the brand/type and serving size of any alcoholic
beverages they consumed before, during and after the quiz.
We used the brand and serving size information to calcu-
late the number of UK units in each beverage. If partici-
pants were not able to remember the exact brand they
consumed, we calculated the number of UK units based
on the average ABV for each beverage type [21]. To corrob-
orate the cover story, these measures were embedded in
questionnaires about participants’ contribution to their
quiz team. Responses to the follow-up questionnaire that
were submitted more than 7 days after the quiz were ex-
cluded from analysis due to concerns about reduced recall
accuracy [22]. All participants were debriefed and
informed about the real aims of the study 7 days after the
final quiz night took place.
Data analysis
Observed alcohol consumption during the quiz
We used multi-level regression modelling to evaluate the
amount of alcohol consumed across conditions, while
controlling for data clustering within teams and quiz
nights. In an adjusted analysis, we also controlled for
gender (between-subjects factor), AUDIT-C scores and
self-reported alcohol consumption prior to the quiz (covar-
iates). Because observed alcohol consumption was not dis-
tributed normally, we created 1000 bootstrap samples to
estimate bias-corrected and accelerated 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for the model parameters [bias-corrected
and accelerated (BCa) 95% CIs]. Analyses not accounting
for clustering are reported in the Supporting information,
Table S5.
Self-reported alcohol consumption after the quiz
To examine whether participants would compensate for
the reduced servings by consuming more alcohol after
the study, we analysed the effect of serving size condition
on self-reported alcohol consumption after the quiz using
a Bayesian t-test for independent samples. We also
analysed the effect of serving size condition on self-reported
alcohol consumption after the quiz, while controlling
for gender, AUDIT-C scores and self-reported alcohol
consumption prior to the quiz using a Bayesian analysis
of covariance (ANCOV
A). We used Bayesian analysis be-
cause we hypothesized that the serving size manipulation
would not affect consumption significantly after the study
[23]. Bayesian analyses were conducted in JASP version
0.8.1.1 [24]. All other analyses were conducted in SPSS
version 24 [19].
RESULTS
Participant characteristics
As per study protocol, two participants were excluded from
all analyses because they guessed that their alcohol con-
sumption was being observed during the study
. The final
sample consisted of 164 participants (see Table 5). One par-
ticipant did not complete the questionnaire during the
study
. Sixteen participants did not complete the follow-up
questionnaire. These participants were excluded where
applicable using listwise exclusion.
Observed alcohol sales
The bar sold on average 28.07% less alcohol on nights
with reduced servings (mean = 77.9 UK units, SD = 14.3)
than on nights with standard servings (mean = 108.3 UK
units, SD = 6.1; means weighted for number of attendees).
Observed alcohol consumption
The results of the multi-level modelling showed a signifi-
cant reduction in alcohol consumption attributed to the re-
duced serving size condition [B = �1.14 (�1.68, �0.60),
standard error (SE) = 0.28, P = 0.001]. However, this re-
duction [B = �0.73 (�1.78, 0.27), SE = 0.52, P = 0.14]
became non-significant when controlling for gender,
AUDIT-C scores and self-reported alcohol consumption
prior to the quiz (Table 6). Inspection of the estimated
means shows that participants in the reduced serving size
condition drank 32.4–39.6% less alcohol than participants
in the standard serving size condition (Supporting informa-
tion, Table S4, Fig. 2).
1The main bar served different beverage types than the private bar for the experiment, and beverages from the main bar were not included in the serving size
manipulation. Unexpectedly, 18 participants (all in the reduced serving size condition) purchased beverages from the main bar in the pub during the pub quiz
(which was not subject to the serving size manipulation). Beverages purchased from the main bar were not included in the observed alcohol consumption
score used in the primary analyses (per pre-registration protocol). We conducted two exploratory sensitivity analyses to investigate how this affected our main
results. The results followed the same pattern as the primary analyses (see Supporting information, Tables S6–S9). Unadjusted analyses showed that partic-
ipants consumed 23.2–31.9% less alcohol in the reduced serving size versus standard size condition. Adjusted analyses controlling for gender, AUDIT-C scores
and self-reported alcohol consumption prior to the quiz were not significant.

 Self-reported alcohol consumption after the study
The Bayesian analysis was inconclusive in an unadjusted
analysis [Bayes factor (BF)10 = 0.36]. However, after con-
trolling for gender, AUDIT-C scores and self-reported
consumption before the study, there was sufficient evi-
dence that serving size condition did not affect self-reported
alcohol consumption after the study (BF10 = 0.29). See
Table 7 for (un)adjusted means.
POLICY MODEL
We used the SAPM version 3.1 [15] to estimate the
potential effect of systematic reductions in the serving
size of all beverages served in the on-trade on alcohol-
related harm. As the effect size in study 2 was substan-
tially larger than in study 1, we based the policy
model
on
the
more
conservative
effect
size
from
study 1.

 SAPM is a deterministic mathematical simulation
model that models how alcohol policies such as pricing
and taxation changes [25] affect alcohol consumption
and the resulting changes in alcohol-attributable mortality
and morbidity. The model methodology is described exten-
sively elsewhere [15,26]. SAPM uses alcohol consumption
data from the2014Health Survey for England(HSE)torep-
resent baseline consumption in the model. These data are
combined with alcohol purchasing data from the 2010–
14 Living Costs and Food Surveys to estimate the propor-
tion of each HSE respondent’s consumption, which falls
into 10 categories: on- and off-trade beer, cider, wine, spirits
and Ready-to-Drinks (RTDs) (pre-mixed beverages often re-
ferred to as ‘alcopops’)—see Brennan et al. [27] for full de-
tails of this apportionment process. Based on the results of
study 1 we estimated that a 25% reduction in serving size
could lead to an approximate reduction in alcohol con-
sumption of 20.7%. We modelled the effect of thisreduction
in on-trade alcohol consumption, as well as a more conser-
vative estimate (a 10.3% decrease—half the effect size in
study 1), to account for the possibility that the population
effect size is substantially smaller. See Supporting informa-
tion for full details. For each scenario we modelled the
long-term (20-year [27]) impact on alcohol-attributable
deaths and hospital admissions from 43 different alcohol-
related health conditions and compared these to a counter-
factual scenario where alcohol consumption remained
unchanged. The modelled scenarios resulted in an esti-
mated 5.6–13.2% reduction in deaths per year and an esti-
mated 4.4–10.5% reduction in hospital admissions per
year compared to the baseline scenario (see Table 8).
DISCUSSION
We investigated the effect of alcoholic beverage serving size
on alcohol consumption. In study 1, we demonstrated that
reduced serving sizes led to a 20.7–22.3% decrease in alco-
hol consumption in the laboratory during a 1-hour drink-
ing period. In study 2, we showed that reduced serving
sizes led to a 32.4–39.6% decrease in alcohol consumption
in a real-world drinking environment during a longer
drinking period (up to 3 hours). Additional sensitivity anal-
yses indicated a reduction of 17.4–31.9% attributed to the
reduced serving size. People did not compensate for the
serving size reductions by consuming more alcohol after
the study. These findings support our hypothesis that serv-
ing size has a causal effect on alcohol consumption.
The exact magnitude of the reduction in alcohol con-
sumption was dependent upon the analysis used. The anal-
ysis adjusting for clustering of alcohol consumption within
participant pairs/teams showed a 20.7 and 39.6% reduc-
tion in alcohol consumption in studies 1 and 2, respec-
tively. Because clustering occurred in both studies, we
believe this to be the best approximation of the effect of
serving size on alcohol consumption in the present studies.
While the reduction in serving size led to a reduction in
alcohol consumption in both studies, the reduction in alco-
hol consumption was somewhat larger in study 2 (where
standard serving sizes of 2.8 units for beer/cider and
2.2 units for wine were reduced by 28.7–33.3%) than in
study 1 (where standard serving sizes of 2.1 units were re-
duced by 25%). One explanation is that greater serving size
reductions will prompt greater reductions in alcohol con-
sumption. However, given the differences between the two
studydesigns, other factors may partiallyexplain this differ-
ence. A further difference between the two studies is that in
study1participants were requiredtoconsumeatleast some
alcoholandhadaccessonlytoalcoholicbeverages,whereas
participants in study 2 were able to consume non-alcoholic
beverages and were not required to drink any alcohol at all.
These studies are the first, to our knowledge, to demon-
strate that reducing the serving size of alcoholic beverages
prompts reductions in alcohol consumption. This is consis-
tent with research demonstrating that food portion size
has a causal effect on energy intake [28] and consumers
do not fully compensate for the effect that portion size
has on total energy intake [10,29]. In the present studies
we examined alcohol consumption during relatively short
periods. However, in study 2 we found that reduced serving
sizes led to decreased alcohol consumption during 3 hours;
a length of time that is comparable to most drinking occa-
sions in the UK population [30]. In study 2 we also found

 no evidence that participants consumed more alcohol dur-
ing the remainder of the night if they had been provided
earlier with reduced serving size alcoholic beverages. It
would now be informative for future research to investigate
the long-term effect of reducing the standard serving sizes
of alcoholic beverages on alcohol consumption.
As the aim of the present research was to examine the
causal influence of serving size on alcohol consumption,
we did not make participants explicitly aware of the serving
size reductions made. Instead, we used cover stories in both
experiments, limiting the likelihood that our findings can
be explained by demand characteristics [31]. We cannot
completely rule out demand characteristics in either study,
because participants in the reduced serving size conditions
may have been conscious of the fact that they were receiv-
ing a smaller than usual serving of alcohol. If serving size
reductions to on-trade alcoholic beverages were to be im-
plemented as a policy, this would require transparency. It
is possible that unfavourable opinions towards systematic
alcohol serving size reductions would lead to psychological
reactance to the policy [32], limiting its effectiveness. It
would therefore be informative to examine public accept-
ability of serving size reductions to alcoholic beverages
and whether awareness of serving size reductions affects
their influence on alcohol consumption.
Our methodology had some limitations. First, observers
in study 2 were aware of the study aims. This could have
influenced the way they coded alcohol consumption. How-
ever, in line with recommendations [33], the observers
were well trained and each participant was observed by
two independent observers. Secondly, glass size varied be-
tween serving size conditions to ensure that glasses ap-
peared similarly full. People may consume more alcohol
from larger glasses [14,34]. Therefore, future work may
benefit from controlling for glass size when examining
the effect of serving size. Thirdly, participants in study 1
were primarily university students and despite recruiting
from the local community for study 2, the sample may
not be representative of the UK population. Future re-
search should investigate the effect of serving size reduc-
tion in more diverse populations and examine whether
the effect is moderated by demographic characteristics.
The typical serving size of beer in the United Kingdom
(568 ml) is larger than serving sizes used in many other
countries [35], and the size of on-trade wine servings in
the United Kingdom has increased during recent decades
[36]. It is therefore feasible that existing serving size legisla-
tion [37] could be adapted to introduce a cap on available
serving sizes and accommodate the sales of smaller serv-
ings. We used the SAPM to estimate the potential public
health benefit of reducing the default serving sizes of alco-
holic beverages in the on-trade. Our most conservative es-
timates suggest that serving size reductions might reduce
alcohol-related deaths and hospital admissions to a similar
extent as a £0.50 minimum unit price [15]. However, it is
important to acknowledge that these estimates are subject
to limitations of our studies outlined above. Additionally,
while the aggregate effects of serving size reductions and
minimum unit pricing may be similar, the cheap alcohol
that would be affected by minimum unit pricing is con-
sumed by different demographics than the on-trade alcohol
that would be affected by serving size reductions. There-
fore, the distribution of effects would probably be very
different for both policies. Nevertheless, our findings high-
light alcoholic beverage serving size as a potential target
for public health interventions.
To conclude, this research is the first to demonstrate
that the serving size of alcoholic beverages affects alcohol
consumption. Reducing the standard serving sizes of alco-
holic beverages may be an effective way to reduce alcohol
consumption at the population level.
