The joint impact of pregnancy, environmental, and sociocultural exposures on early life gut microbiome 
is not yet well-characterized, especially in racially and socioeconomically diverse populations. Gut 
microbiota of 298 children from a Detroit-based birth cohort were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing: 
130 neonates (median age = 1.2 months) and 168 infants (median age = 6.6 months). Multiple factors 
were associated with neonatal gut microbiome composition in both single- and multi-factor models, 
with independent contributions of maternal race-ethnicity, breastfeeding, mode of delivery, marital 
status, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and indoor pets. These findings were consistent in 
the infants, and networks demonstrating the shared impact of factors on gut microbial composition 
also showed notable topological similarity between neonates and infants. Further, latent groups 
defined by these factors explained additional variation, highlighting the importance of combinatorial 
effects. Our findings also have implications for studies investigating the impact of the early life gut 
microbiota on disease.
The human gut microbiome, the mixed-species community of microbes that reside in the gastrointestinal tract, 
plays a critical role in physiological and immunological maturation and homeostasis1. Perturbations to gut 
bacterial community composition in neonatancy have been associated with a variety of pediatric disorders1–6, 
underscoring the relationship between early life gut microbiota development and childhood health status. Many 
environmental and social risk factors associated with disease or health may also influence early life gut microbial 
development. However, only a few studies have examined relationships between early life exposures and the gut 
microbiota7–9. While these studies may have examined multiple pregnancy, sociocultural, and environmental 
factors, none have taken a multi-factor approach to studying their joint effects on gut microbiota composition, 
and none have been conducted in a racially and socioeconomically diverse birth cohort.
To date, the most comprehensive study associating pregnancy and environmental exposures the with early life 
gut microbiome was conducted by Bäckhed et al.7, where longitudinal samples from 98 Swedish mother-infant 
dyads were examined. This study and others have confirmed that early feeding patterns have a dramatic effect 
on the infant’s developing gut microbial community composition10,11, as have delivery mode and antibiotic 
exposure12–14. If the influence of these and potentially other early life exposures on disease risk is thought to be

partially explained by their impact on gut microbiome development over the first year of life, a broader under-
standing of such factors and their influence on bacterial community composition is critical.
In the current study, we used 16S rRNA sequencing to profile the bacterial gut microbiota present in stool 
specimens gathered during the first year of life in a racially and socioeconomically diverse population-based birth 
cohort from the metropolitan Detroit area. Associations between a broad survey of pre- and post-natal environ-
mental and sociocultural factors and early life gut microbiome composition were evaluated both individually and 
in multivariable models to identify factors that influence this critical period of microbial assemblage. Networks of 
associated factors were constructed to visualize the relationships between these factors based on shared composi-
tional impact. We also explored how groupings of mothers based on these factors may identify possible combined 
effects that further explain the early life gut microbiota composition of their offspring.
Results
Early life gut microbiome structure in the Microbes, Asthma, Allergy, and Pets (MAAP) study. 
 
The MAAP study is derived from the Wayne County Health Environment Asthma and Allergy Longitudinal 
Study (WHEALS) birth cohort according to study inclusion and exclusion criteria (Supplementary Fig. S1). Of 
the 298 independent MAAP study subjects with stool specimens available for analysis following sequence quality 
control filtering, 130 were collected at the study visit targeted for 1-month (actual visit date in months: min = 0.5; 
25th percentile = 0.9; median = 1.2; 75th percentile = 1.5; max = 4.6), collectively referred to as “neonates”
, and 168 
were collected at the study visit targeted for 6-months (actual visit date in months: min = 5.6; 25th percentile = 6.1; 
median = 6.6; 75th percentile = 7.4; max = 10.6), collectively referred to as “infants”
. As expected from previous 
studies15, the gut microbiota exhibited substantial age-related taxonomic variation. In neonatal specimens, bacte-
rial communities were typically dominated by Bifidobacteriaceae or Enterobacteriaceae taxa (Fig. 1). In compar-
ison, infants were characteristically dominated either by Bifidobacteriaceae or Lachnospiraceae (Fig. 1), the latter 
representing a common dominant family in adult gut microbiomes16.
In addition, 21 specific families exhibited taxonomic expansion (i.e. increased richness) with age 
(false discovery rate [FDR] adjusted p < 0.05, Fig. 2). These included Lachnospiraceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, 
Peptostreptococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae. In contrast, 8 families exhibited reciprocal trends (i.e. decreased rich-
ness) with age, which included Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Streptococcaceae. These results are con-
sistent with data indicating that the pioneering species that initially colonize the nascent gastrointestinal tract 
are facultative anaerobes, which are replaced by strict anaerobic taxa as the microbial burden increases, oxygen 
availability becomes limiting17, and the consortium shifts to fermentative metabolism15.
Single-factor associations with early life gut microbiota composition. 
Permutational multivar-
iate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA)18 was used to test for compositional differences by early life factors, 
using both unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance metrics. Among the factors tested, 19 of 49 (39%) were 
significantly associated with gut microbiome composition in the neonates, while 28 of 72 (39%) were significant 
in the infants (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S3); 17 of the 19 factors (90%) associated with neonatal gut bacterial 
communities were also significant in the infants. For the majority of associated factors, unweighted UniFrac was 
significant but weighted UniFrac was not, indicating that phylogeny alone was capable of distinguishing com-
position. However, a select few factors were distinguished by both phylogeny and abundance (i.e. by weighted

specimens collected at the study visit targeted for 6-months (age range: 5.6–10.6 months, median: 6.6 months). 
For each group, subjects are displayed in decreasing order of relative abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae.

UniFrac). For both age groups, individual associated factors explained approximately 1–4% of the variation in 
bacterial microbiome composition. Consistent with the differences in composition between neonates and infants 
(Fig. 1), the age in days at which the specimen was obtained within each group was significantly associated with 
composition (unweighted UniFrac p < 0.001 for both neonates and infants).
As anticipated, early life feeding and mode of delivery were associated with gut microbiota composition in 
both neonates and infants. Besides compositional differences by mode of delivery overall (vaginal vs. C-section), 
significant differences were observed by type of C-section (planned vs. unplanned) among the infants (weighted 
UniFrac p = 0.022), indicating that even partial labor may alter microbial composition. Multiple other maternal 
and pre- and post-natal environmental factors were found to be associated with early life gut microbiota compo-
sition. Included among the maternal factors were body mass index (BMI) during pregnancy (unweighted UniFrac 
in neonates p = 0.004 and in infants p = 0.001) as well as the number of previous pregnancies (unweighted Unifrac 
in neonates p = 0.004 and in infants p = 0.022). Among the environmental exposures, environmental tobacco 
smoke (ETS) during pregnancy (unweighted UniFrac p = 0.007) and at the neonatal visit (unweighted UniFrac 
p = 0.021) were also associated with compositional differences in neonates; community richness and phylogenetic 
diversity were increased in ETS-exposed relative to unexposed participants (Supplementary Table S4).
Interestingly, maternal reported race-ethnicity was associated with gut bacterial community composition 
in neonates (unweighted UniFrac p = 0.002) and infants (unweighted UniFrac p < 0.001). African American 
race-ethnicity was associated with a more rich, even, and phylogenetically diverse gastrointestinal microbiota in 
both neonates and infants (Supplementary Table S4). In the WHEALS cohort, African American race-ethnicity 
was positively associated with both urban residence and never married (African American mothers were 47.7%

13.1% never married and 22.9% from an urban residence, both p < 0.001). Consistently, these two factors were 
also associated with composition, with similar increases in the alpha diversity measures associated with urban 
residence and never married (Supplementary Table S4).

Multi-factor models of neonatal and infant gut microbiome composition. 
As many of the 
single factors may explain an overlapping portion of the early life gut microbiome composition, multi-factor 
PERMANOVA models of microbiome composition were subsequently constructed using a backward variable 
selection procedure to assess which factors had significant independent effects. The resulting four models by 
study visit (neonates and infants) and distance metric (weighted and unweighted UniFrac) are presented in Fig. 4. 
For the neonates, using an unweighted UniFrac distance-based model, seven factors were retained in the model, 
which included six factors that were univariately associated with bacterial composition (age at stool collection 
in days (p < 0.001), current breastfeeding at the neonatal visit (p < 0.001), mode of delivery (p < 0.001), ETS 
exposure at the neonatal visit (p = 0.012), marital status (p = 0.013), and maternal race-ethnicity (p = 0.036)), as 
well as the presence of an indoor pet(s) (p = 0.022). This model explained 13.9% (adjusted 8.9%) of the variation 
in the neonatal gut microbiome. The comparable model for the infants similarly retained current breastfeed-
ing (p < 0.001), exclusive breastfeeding (p = 0.006), parity (p = 0.008), mode of delivery (p = 0.009), household

income (p = 0.011), age at stool collection in days (p = 0.013), marital status (p = 0.013), and current maternal 
smoking (p = 0.022). The complete eight factor model explained 12.1% (adjusted 7.7%) of the gut microbiome 
composition. Taken together, the multi-factor models reflected the remarkable consistency of the single factor 
analyses, validating the independent and additive effects of these factors on the developing infant microbiome. 
Further, they reflect that current report of breastfeeding and exposure to tobacco smoke are more influential than 
past exposure.
Taxonomic differences associated with factors retained in the multi-factor models. 
We next 
identified how the factors retained in the final multi-factor models associated with differences in taxonomic 
relative abundances with zero-inflated negative binomial models, adjusting for multiple comparisons using FDR. 
Discriminant taxa were categorized by genus for both neonates (Fig. 5) and infants (Fig. 6). Among neonates, 
both current and exclusive breastfeeding were associated with decreased abundance of Roseburia taxa; current 
breastfeeding was associated with an increased abundance of Staphylococcus and Prevotella taxa, while exclusive 
breastfeeding was associated with an increased abundance of Streptococcus taxa. Collectively, these results are 
consistent with recent findings from exclusively breastfed 4 month old Swedish infants7. Delivery via C-section 
was primarily characterized by the decreased abundance of specific Bacteroides, Collinsella, and Coprococus taxa, 
also consistent with the findings of Bäckhed and colleagues7. Compared to all other races, neonates of African 
American mothers exhibited significantly higher abundances of Lactobacillus and Megasphaera taxa, while 
those of married mothers had lower abundances of Lactobacillus and Faecalibacterium taxa. Neonates currently 
exposed to ETS had higher abundances of Ruminococcus and Akkermansia taxa, and those living in a household 
with an indoor pet(s) were enriched for Clostridium taxa and exhibited lower abundances of Roseburia taxa.
Among infants (Fig. 6), exclusive breastfeeding was characterized by increased relative abundance of several 
Lactobacillus taxa and decreased abundance of a multitude of taxa from various genera, including Clostridia, 
Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus. Members of these three depleted genera have recently been identified as

enriched in older (16–30 month old) Malawian children that (together with 22 other taxa) predict early life 
chronological age19, which is consistent with recent reports indicating that sustained breastfeeding in early life 
retards the development of an adult-like gut microbiota7. A similar trend was observed for current breastfeeding, 
but the abundance of several Bifidobacterium taxa was also increased in addition to Lactobacillus. When compar-
ing bacteria impacted by mode of delivery, Bacteroides taxa were no longer as clearly enriched in vaginally born 
children as found with the neonates, which may explain the reduced percentage of variation captured by mode of 
delivery in these older babies. Infants of married mothers and of high-income households had lower abundances 
of Bacteroides taxa and higher abundances of Bifidobacterium taxa. Infants of mothers who smoked either during 
pregnancy or currently had higher abundances of Bacteroides and Staphylococcus taxa.
Networks of factors demonstrating shared impact on gut microbial composition. 
To more con-

of these factors were constructed in neonates (Fig. 7) and infants (Fig. 8), where the distance between pairs of 
factors was based on the proportion of taxa significantly associated with both (Supplementary Table S5). To

duration of breastfeeding. Both mode of delivery and exclusive breastfeeding were not connected to each other or 
the broader network, indicating their distinct contributions to bacterial composition in the neonatal gut.
The infant network (Fig. 8) was notably similar in topology to the neonatal network. Maternal race-ethnicity 
was also part of a highly interconnected module that contained socioeconomic, early feeding, and prior preg-
nancy factors. This module additionally included housing characteristics (central air conditioner in residence 
and regular use of air filters). A dissimilarity with the neonatal network was this module’s connection with mode 
of delivery, indicating a less distinct contribution of mode of delivery in infants compared to neonates. Tobacco 
smoke exposure and BMI during pregnancy again defined two distinct modules, with BMI during pregnancy 
again being closely connected to age at stool specimen collection.
In addition to showing the relationships between these factors based on shared compositional impact, these 
networks also provide insight into the factors selected in the multi-factor models. In general, the modules 
described were represented in the multi-factor models by one or more of their component factors, the num-
ber of which depended upon the complexity of the module. These results also demonstrate that significantly 
correlated factors may still have distinct effects on composition. For example, among the neonates, maternal 
race-ethnicity and marital status were significantly correlated with one another, but both were included in the 
neonatal unweighted UniFrac multi-factor model, indicating significant independent composition contributions.
While the networks demonstrated similarity in topology, differences in the factors selected in the respective 
multi-factor models were present. In particular, maternal race-ethnicity was part of a module that also contained 
household income in both neonatal and infant networks; at the same time, maternal race-ethnicity was included 
in the unweighted UniFrac neonatal model but income was not, while income was included in the unweighted 
UniFrac infant model but maternal race-ethnicity was not. The consistent grouping of these factors in both early 
life networks and their mutually exclusive occurrence in multi-factor models—where retained factors exhibit 
independent effects—suggests that that the race-ethnicity association with composition is closely related to a 
broader socioeconomic profile in both neonates and infants, and that this relationship is better captured by dif-
ferent factors at different ages.
Maternal profiles of early life factors associated with microbiome composition. 
In addition to 
determining the individual factors contributing to gut microbiome composition, it is also important to assess 
whether combinations of these factors cluster to identify distinct profiles of mothers and whether such combina-
tions synergistically explain additional variation in composition, beyond the individual factor effects alone. We 
therefore used a latent class analysis (LCA) to determine if there was evidence for different underlying profiles of 
mothers. We specifically focused on the earliest period of gut microbiome development captured in our study (the 
neonatal period), as our results show that these drivers shape composition in both neonates and infants (Fig. 3). 
The LCA results from the entire WHEALS cohort (n = 1,258 mothers; Supplementary Table S1) suggested that 
the three group maternal profile solution was the best fit to the data (bootstrap likelihood ratio p-value < 0.001).
The frequencies of the component factors for each of the three maternal profiles are presented in Table 1. 
Microbiome-associated maternal profile 1 (MMP1) was composed exclusively of African American mothers and 
had the lowest level of pet-keeping (11% had pets in the home at the neonatal visit). MMP2 had the least African 
American women (84% Caucasian/Other), and were most likely to be married at the pre-delivery visit (94%) 
and breastfeed at the neonatal visit (78% mixed or exclusive breastfeeding). MMP3 was the least frequent group-
ing, comprising 14% (n = 175) of mothers; notably, MMP3 was also the most racially diverse, with nearly equal

percentages of African American (53%) and non-African American mothers (47%). MMP3 mothers were least 
likely to be married at pre-delivery (20%), least likely to breastfeed at the neonatal visit (3%), and most likely to 
report infant ETS exposure at the neonatal visit (87%).
As would be expected, there were compositional differences in the neonate gut microbiome between the three 
groups (unweighted UniFrac p-value < 0.001). Interestingly, when MMP grouping was included in the neonatal 
unweighted UniFrac multi-factor composition model, there was suggestive evidence that the groups explained an 
additional 1.7% of the total microbiome variation (p = 0.062), indicating that the MMPs capture additional con-
textual information between the factors that exceed their independent contributions. These results demonstrate 
the complexity and synergy of the combined effects of pregnancy, sociocultural, and environmental factors in 
distinguishing gut bacterial communities.
Discussion
Our study has taken a comprehensive approach to the identification of pregnancy, sociocultural, and environ-
mental factors related to early life gastrointestinal bacterial microbiota in a racially and socioeconomically diverse 
birth cohort. Unique among similar studies, we have not only applied single factor (i.e. univariate) analyses but 
also multi-factor (i.e. multivariate) approaches to identify parsimonious sets of factors influencing early life 
microbiome composition and identify maternal groupings that exhibit specific patterns of these factors. In doing 
so, we have introduced a novel approach that may be useful for capturing the joint effects of multiple exposures 
in early life and subsequent health and disease outcomes mediated by specific patterns of early life bacterial 
colonization.
The current study did not have longitudinal microbiome measures to assess the within-child impact of factors 
on changes in microbiome composition over time. However, the two age groups studied did allow for independ-
ent validation that 17 of the 19 individual factors associated with gut bacterial compositional differences in the 
neonatal subjects remained significantly associated in the infant subjects. The two factors that did not remain 
associated were ETS exposure during pregnancy and ETS exposure at the neonatal visit. However, in our infant 
multi-factor models, maternal smoking was identified as a significant factor associated with microbiome compo-
sition, suggesting that tobacco smoke in general is an important determinant of the developing gut microbiome 
composition across the first year of life.
Our findings were not only internally consistent, but they also largely agreed with previous studies. 
Breastfeeding, mode of delivery, gestational age, age of the child, number of previous pregnancies, and parity 
have all been previously associated with early life gut microbiome composition8,10,13,20,21. Additionally, we did not 
detect an effect of solid food introduction, consistent with the recent findings of Bäckhed et al.7, which suggested 
that cessation of breastfeeding rather than introduction of solid foods strongly influences developing microbial 
communities.
In contrast, we notably failed to detect compositional differences by antibiotic exposure both prenatally and 
in early life, which have previously been reported in the literature as important determinants of gut microbiome 
development12,22. However, our findings may be a reflection of the granularity of the definitions used (i.e. not 
classified by specific medication type or reason(s) for medication use), which were limited due to the low fre-
quency of early life antibiotic use (3% among neonates; 22% among infants). Further, the definition of prenatal 
antibiotic use encompassed the entire pregnancy through date of delivery; future work in our and other cohorts 
is needed to determine if timing of antibiotic exposure during pregnancy is associated with offspring gut micro-
biome development.
A novel aspect of the present study is the representation of multiple race-ethnicities. In particular, we found 
that self-report of African American race-ethnicity is associated with gut microbiome compositional differences 
compared with non-African Americans in both neonates and infants. The constructed networks identified demo-
graphic factors that may be closely related. For example, household income, marital status, and maternal educa-
tion were closely related to African American race-ethnicity in terms of commonly associated taxa. These factors 
are also significantly correlated with one another, and they may collectively be representative of an underlying 
sociocultural construct affecting gut microbiome composition. However, other unmeasured factors associated 
with African American race-ethnicity, including heritable genetic variation, cannot be ruled out as possibly con-
tributing to this effect. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated host germline genetic variation contributes 
to the differential abundance of certain taxa, suggesting that microbial composition may be partially heritable. 
Goodrich et al. recently demonstrated that Christensenella, a bacterial member of the gut microbiome, is herita-
ble, with 40% of its variance in abundance attributable to additive genetic factors23. As African Americans are an 
admixed population composed of genetic ancestry from both Africa and Europe24, future studies should evaluate 
whether percent genome-wide African ancestry in African Americans is associated with early life gut bacterial 
composition to determine whether differences in ancestral genetic variation partially accounts for the effect of 
self-identified African American race-ethnicity.
Many of the differences in bacterial abundance by early life factors are consistent with previous studies. For 
example, we found that babies born via C-section had lower abundances of Bacteroides compared to babies 
born vaginally7,9,25. Additionally, we found that breastfeeding was associated with increased abundance of 
Staphylococcus taxa among neonates and Bifidobacerium and Lactobacillus taxa among infants, each of which 
have been associated with breastfeeding in previous studies26–28. In addition to these early life exposures that have 
been frequently examined in studies of infant gut microbiome composition, we also identified taxa-specific differ-
ences by several factors that have not been well characterized in terms of associations with infant gut microbiota. 
Many of these factors relate to socioeconomic status, which is an important determinant of human health29 and 
may indirectly impact early life gut microbiota through a variety of mechanisms, including environmental expo-
sures (housing conditions, pollution, etc.), chronic stress, diet, and physical activity. These findings as well as the

potential context-dependent effects suggested by the MMP groups will need to be validated by additional studies 
of socioeconomically and racially diverse populations, which are currently under-represented in the microbiome 
literature.
Our multi-factor approach also allowed us to identify the presence of indoor pets as significantly and inde-
pendently associated with gut microbiome composition in neonates. We and others have shown that exposure to 
pets in early life protects children against the development of allergic disease30 and that indoor pets significantly 
alter the diversity of the microbiome of the home, as measured in dust samples31–33. Further, a recent publication 
from our group demonstrated that murine exposure to house dust from dog-keeping homes affected the gut 
microbiome34. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that the associations between pet exposure 
and allergic outcomes may be mediated by the effect of gut microbial composition changes due to pet exposure in 
the first few months following birth.
In addition to our multi-factor composition models, the latent class analysis identified maternal profiles asso-
ciated with early life gut microbiome composition that would not have been hypothesized based solely on pair-
wise correlations between the factors. In particular, MMP3 mothers reported the highest rates of ETS exposure 
(87%) and the lowest rates of both breastfeeding (3%) and being married at delivery (20%). This non-racially 
disparate group reflects a susceptibility profile with potentially detrimental health effects that may be mediated by 
early life gut microbiome composition. Further studies are needed to understand potential associations between 
MMP groups and early childhood conditions, such as allergic disease.
In aggregate, the factors in the age-group specific unweighted UniFrac multi-factor models explained 12–14% 
of the variability in the microbiome. While not a majority, there are numerous explanations for these modest 
effects. First, there are limitations to the granularity of information that can be derived from questionnaire data. 
For example, the assessment of breastfeeding fails to capture the complexity of breast milk content (oligosac-
charides, lipids, metabolites, cytokines, etc.), which is known to be highly variable between mothers35. These 
bioactive components could be profiled by modern molecular techniques to provide a finer-grained assessment 
of breast milk content that may explain more of the variability in gut microbiome composition. Further, breast-
feeding status was coarsely classified as exclusive, any, or none. While this is standard in the literature, it does not 
recognize the heterogeneity that exists within each of these categories, such as the other dietary factors to which 
the baby is exposed. Food frequency questionnaires are an epidemiological tool that could be used for both the 
mother and her baby to better capture this heterogeneity. Finally, it is known that interpersonal microbiome var-
iability is high, with a majority of rare taxa present36. As a result, the proportion of gut compositional variability 
that can be explained by common exposures is effectively limited.
A growing body of literature has identified gut microbiome perturbations as associated with a range of dis-
eases37. Our findings have particular relevance to epidemiologic studies on the developmental origins of diseases, 
where mounting evidence suggests that alterations in early life bacterial composition are related to subsequent 
disease development2–6. A broad understanding of the environmental and sociocultural factors that may influence 
the early life gut microbiome is necessary for the proper design and analysis of such studies. Inappropriate control 
for such factors in either the design (e.g. matching) or analysis (e.g. adjustment as a covariate) may produce mis-
leading results, as the portion of microbiome variation explained by these factors may lie directly on the causal 
pathway between exposure and outcome. Further, our study has identified that complex interactions between 
these factors are associated with microbiome composition alteration. While these suggestive findings need to be 
confirmed by additional studies, they indicate that not accounting for such context-dependent effects may lead to 
inconsistent results when the microbiome is a complete or partial mediator of the exposure-disease relationship.
In summary, our approach to characterizing pregnancy, sociocultural, and environmental factors associated 
with gut microbiome moves this field of study beyond single factor analyses to provide multi-factor insights 
into compositional differences between children in early life. Our study also has identified African American 
race-ethnicity as having important independent and context-dependent effects on early life gut bacterial compo-
sition and underscores the need for more studies of under-represented minorities38. This is especially true for the 
study of disease outcomes that are racially disparate in terms of risk, and where the microbiome is hypothesized 
to have a causal effect.
Methods
Study population. 
Analyses were performed on data and samples collected from the WHEALS birth 
cohort based in and around Detroit, Michigan, USA. WHEALS recruited pregnant women with due dates from 
September 2003 through December 2007, and who were seeing a Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) practitioner 
at one of five clinics to establish an unselected birth cohort. All women were in their second trimester or later, 
were aged 21–49 years, and were living in a predefined contiguous geographic area in Wayne and Oakland coun-
ties that included the city of Detroit as well as the suburban areas immediately surrounding the city. Post-partum 
interviewer-administered questionnaires and in-person evaluations were completed periodically, including sur-
vey and home visits targeted for ages 1 and 6 months. Delivery records for WHEALS women were abstracted 
to obtain delivery type (vaginal or C-section), birth weight, and gestational age at delivery. All participants 
provided written, informed consent, and study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board at 
HFHS. Further, the study was performed in accordance with the protocol guidelines approved by the Institutional 
Review Board at HFHS.
The WHEALS cohort included 1,258 babies; 255 were dropped for non-compliance. Of the remaining 1,003 
eligible, 763 children (76.1%) either completed a 2 year follow-up visit in the clinic or had blood drawn for meas-
urement of immunoglobulin E (primary outcome of parent study). Of these children, we determined those who 
had an available stored paired house dust and stool sample collected at the same 6-month, or if not available, 
1-month visit. Stool samples from 308 children underwent microbial sequencing; of these, 298 (n = 130 from

the 1-month visit [age range 0.5–4.6 months], referred to as “neonates”
, and n = 168 from the 6-month visit [age 
range 5.6–10.6 months], referred to as “infants”) were successfully sequenced and comprise the analytic sample 
(Supplementary Figure S1).
We assessed numerous population characteristics of the selected sample versus the entire birth cohort and 
found few statistically significant differences between the two (Supplementary Table S1). Of particular note, race 
(61% African American), marital status (63.6% married), mode of delivery (38.3% C-section), and environmen-
tal tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure (26.0% during pregnancy) were similar (all p-values > 0.20). Report of ever 
breastfed was also similar between the analytic sample and parent sample (78.1% vs. 77.9%, respectively; p = 0.95). 
However, rate of current breastfeeding at the 1-month visit was higher in the analytic sample (56.1% vs 48.6%, 
respectively; p = 0.028). A larger percentage of the analytic sample came from households with higher income 
(30.8% vs. 19.8% reported greater than $80,000 household income, respectively; p < 0.001). We also evaluated 
differences between the neonates (n = 130) and infants (n = 168) used in the current analysis (Supplementary 
Table S1). The two groups were similar, with the following exceptions (all p < 0.05): infants tended to have fewer 
siblings, were more likely to be delivered via C-section, less likely to be born in the winter, less likely to have 
detectable Der f in the household, and more likely to reside in a home built before 1950.
Environmental and lifestyle measurements. 
Unless described differently, the pre- and post-natal inter-
views with the mother were the sources for most of the factors included in this manuscript. A complete descrip-
tion of each of the factors used is presented in Supplementary Table S2. The child’s mode of delivery, birth weight, 
and gestational age, along with the mother’s medication (antibiotic/antifungal) use was abstracted from maternal 
and delivery medical records. Mother’s BMI during the first trimester was also abstracted from medical records. 
Though maternal BMI was not typically available prior to pregnancy, BMI in the first trimester is a reasonable 
marker of pre-pregnancy BMI39. Early life medication use was abstracted from infant medical records. Gender- 
and gestational-age adjusted birthweight z-scores were calculated using the United States population as a ref. 40.
Dust samples were collected and analyzed using methods we have previously published41. Samples were col-
lected from five locations within the residence (mother and child’s bedroom floors and mattresses along with the 
most used common area, which was typically the living room floor) at the 1- and 6-month home visits. All sam-
ples were analyzed for endotoxin, while the specific allergens of cat (Fel d 1), dog (Can f 1), and dust mite allergen 
(Der f) were only measured in the dust from the child’s bedroom floor. For these analyses, as done previously41, 
pet-keeping was defined as having a cat or dog or both indoors at least 1 hour of the day.
Stool samples. 
Infant stool was collected by field staff during home visits targeting 1 and/or 6 months of age. 
Stool was placed into cryovials, transported to the laboratory and stored at −80 °C. DNA was extracted from stool 
samples using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer based protocol42. Briefly, modified 
CTAB extraction buffer (0.5 ml) were added to 25 mg of stool in a 2 ml Lysing Matrix E tube (MP Biomedicals, 
Santa Ana, CA) prior to incubation at 65 °C for 15 min. After samples were bead-beaten at 5.5 m s−1 for 30 sec in a 
Fastprep-24 (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), 0.5 ml of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added. 
Samples were then centrifuged (16,000 × g, 5 min) and the resulting supernatant was transferred to 2 ml heavy 
phase-lock gel tube (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD) to which chloroform (v/v) was added. Following a second cen-
trifugation (12,000 × g, 5 min), the supernatants were placed in fresh 1.5 ml tubes where 1 μl of linear acrylamide 
and PEG/NaCl (2v/v) were added. Following a 2 h incubation at room temperature, samples were then centri-
fuged (16,000 × g, 10 min), washed with ice cold 70% EtOH and resuspended in 300 μl of 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5.
PCR conditions and library preparation for bacterial sequencing. 
Primer pair F515 (5′-GTGCCAGCM 
GCCGCGGTAA-3′) and R806 (5′-TAATCTWTGGGVHCATCAGG -3′), which included the Illumina flowcell 
adapter sequence and pad region43 were used to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene44. Each reverse 
primer encoded a 12-base error correction Golay barcode unique for individual samples44. PCR reactions were 
performed in triplicate using 0.025 U Takara Hot Start ExTaq (Takara Mirus Bio Inc, Madison, WI), 1X Takara 
buffer with MgCl2, 0.4 pmol μl−1 of F515 and R806 primers, 0.56 mg ml−1 of bovine serum albumin (BSA; Roche 
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), 200 μM of dNTPs, and 10 ng of gDNA in 25 μl reactions. Thermocylcer con-
ditions were as followed: initial denaturation (98 °C for 2 min) followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C (20 sec), annealing 
at 50 °C (30 sec), extension at 72 °C (45 sec) and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Agarose e-gels (2% TBE; Life 
Technologies, Grand Island, NY) were used to verify successful amplification of pooled PCR amplicons, followed 
by purification using AMPure SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Quality of the amplicons was verified 
with the Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and quantification by done using the Qubit 2.0 
Fluorometer and the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Libraries were made by pooling 
samples in equal moles at concentrations of 50 ng. Libraries then denatured and diluted to 2 nM, and 5 pM were 
loaded onto the Illumina MiSeq cartridge with 15% (v/v) of denatured 12.5 pM PhiX spike-in control.
Sequence data processing and quality control. Paired-end sequences were assembled using FLASH v 1.2.745, 
de-multiplexed by barcode, and low quality reads (Q-score < 30) were discarded in QIIME 1.846. Reads were 
truncated if three consecutive bases were < Q30, and the resulting read retained in the data set only if it was at 
least 75% of the original length. UCHIME47 was used to check for chimeras, which were filtered from the dataset 
prior to operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking at 97% sequence identification using UCLUST48 against the 
Greengenes database version 13_549; sequence reads that failed to cluster with a reference sequence were clustered 
de novo. Sequences were then aligned using PyNAST50, and taxonomy was assigned using the RDP classifier51 and 
Greengenes reference database version 13_549. FastTree52 was then used to build a phylogenetic tree.

As rarefying the data once may result in an unrepresentative and outlying sample, particularly when many 
rare taxa are present, read depths were rarefied multiple times and the most “representative” rarefied dataset was 
selected. This representative approach to rarefying was defined for each subject as follows: for 100 subject-specific 
rarefied OTU vectors, the most representative one is selected, defined as the one that is the minimum average 
Euclidean distance from itself to all other OTU vectors, the idea being that upon repeated sampling, extreme 
subsamples are avoided by choosing one central to all others. Hence, the resulting representative rarefied 
OTU table was a concatenation of various subject-specific subsamples. The resulting OTU count table was 
representative-rarefied to the minimum depth of 202,367 total sequences per sample, and was the basis for all 
subsequent analyses involving the microbiome. As RDP classification resolves the sequences at different levels 
of taxonomy, we use the commonly accepted term “taxa” in the Results and Discussion rather than the technical 
term “OTU” for readability.
Statistical analysis. 
Except where otherwise noted, all analyses were performed in R version 3.2.153. Gross 
community measures of bacterial richness (number of unique OTUs present), Pielou’s evenness (relative dis-
tribution of OTUs in a community), and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity were estimated using QIIME and the R 
vegan package54, with tests of association between these measures and baseline characteristics conducted using 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum/Kruskal-Wallis tests (categorical variables) or Spearman’s correlations (continuous vari-
ables). As implemented using the adonis function in the R vegan package, permutational multivariate analysis 
of variance (PERMANOVA)18 was used to assess the relationship of baseline characteristics with microbiome 
composition, using unweighted and weighted UniFrac metrics55. We used both weighted and unweighted UniFrac 
metrics to capture different aspects of bacterial community composition as they relate to environmental and soci-
ocultural factors, with the weighted version detecting shifts in the taxa relative abundances and the unweighted 
capturing the contribution of rarer taxa to these relationships56. In each univariate PERMANOVA model, 10,000 
Monte Carlo permutations were utilized.
To determine the specific OTUs driving compositional differences, tests of differential OTU abundance were 
performed using zero-inflated negative binomial regression; in cases where zero-inflated models failed to con-
verge, the standard negative binomial was implemented as a secondary modeling strategy. To avoid testing overly 
sparse taxa, only OTUs with at least 5 total sequence reads across all samples were tested. Some modifications had 
to be made for OTU testing on multi-category predictors due to sparsity. Specifically, income was dichotomized 
to ≥$80,000, education was dichotomized to ≥bachelor’s degree, marital status was tested using an indicator for 
married, maternal race and baby race was tested as African American vs. other, and indoor pets was tested using 
an indicator for any indoor pets. Statistical significance was assessed after accounting for multiple OTU testing 
using the Benjamini & Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment, with FDR adjusted p-values < 0.05 con-
sidered significant57.
Multi-factor models of infant gut microbiota composition. In order to determine the early life factors inde-
pendently associated with microbiome composition at both 1 and 6 months, we performed backward elimination 
on PERMANOVA models, where predictors with type III p-values < 0.05 were retained in the model (1,000 
permutations). Because PERMANOVA is not equipped to handle missing values and large multivariate models 
would result in sparse sample sizes, the data was first imputed such that missing values of continuous predictors 
were replaced with the mean, and missing values of categorical predictors were made into a missing category 
(contrary to single-factor tests in which missing values were omitted). Given the low rates of missingness across 
the factors (all <8% except for household income and baby antibiotic use; missing counts and percentages for all 
of the factors are included in Supplementary Table S2), the bias due to missingness is expected to be minimal58. 
Additionally, because several predictors had multiple measurements taken at different time points (pregnancy, 1 
month, and 6 months), we removed redundant variables from the model selection procedure to avoid multicol-
linearity issues. Specifically, we calculated the variance inflation factors (VIFs) between these multiple measure-
ments and used the following rule: if two measurements were available with VIF > 2.5, the closest measurement 
to stool collection time was retained; otherwise, both measurements were retained. If three measurements were 
available with at least one VIF > 2.5, the two measurements furthest apart were retained, and the pairwise VIF 
was recalculated to potentially capture a wider range of exposure. If the remaining pairwise VIF > 2.5, then only 
the closest measurement to stool collection time was retained. Additionally, all final multivariate models were 
examined for large VIFs; the largest VIF detected was 2.5, indicating stability in these models.
Networks of factors demonstrating shared impact on gut microbial composition. For both the 1- and 6-month 
study visit, network plots were created to demonstrate the relationship between the factors based on shared 
microbial composition impact, which were constructed using the ggnet2 function of the GGally package in 
R59. Factors were considered the nodes and similarity in terms of association with specific taxa were considered 
the edges between the nodes. Factors were only included in the network plots if either significant single- or 
multi-factor compositional differences were found. In order to define compositional similarity for each pair of 
factors, we calculated the percentage of overlapping significant OTUs among all significant OTUs between the 
two factors. Intuitively, this provides a measure of how similar the specific OTUs associated with two factors were. 
A threshold of at least the 80th percentile in these proportions was used to define the network adjacency matrix, 
meaning 20% of all possible between-variable connections were made in each network. For the neonatal network, 
this meant that two factors had to have at least 15% overlap in shared associated taxa to be connected. In the 
infant network, at least 12% overlap had to be achieved. To help evaluate the extent to which similarity in compo-
sition is due to similarity between the factors, we also calculated between-factor correlations using either Pearson 
correlation (when both variables were continuous), point-biserial correlation (when there was one continuous 
and one binary variable), or the Phi coefficient (when both variables were binary). Connections in the network

plots were highlighted to indicate those with significant (p < 0.05) correlations; correlation matrix heatmaps of all 
factors included in the network plots (for both neonates and infants) were also constructed.
Determination of microbiome-associated maternal profiles. Latent class analysis (LCA) is a statistical method for 
identifying underlying groups of similar individuals. Briefly, LCA tests the hypothesis that subjects come from a 
heterogeneous population, i.e. that there is more than one underlying (latent) homogeneous sub-population that 
the subjects have been drawn from. The size and number of the underlying groups are unknown a priori and thus 
are data driven. By employing LCA solely on the maternal variables included in the final neonatal multi-factor 
PERMANOVA models, we are able to test for the existence of microbiome-associated maternal profiles (MMPs).
LCA was performed using a set of six maternal categorical variables (maternal race, marital status, mode of 
delivery, breastfeeding practices at 1-month interview (exclusive, current but not exclusive and none), pet(s) at 
1-month, and ETS at the 1-month interview). Age of stool was excluded as a non-maternal factor. Models with 
increasing number of groups (n = 1 to 5) were tested and compared for goodness-of-fit. The three-group solution 
was selected based on a statistically significant bootstrapped likelihood ratio test (indicated that 3 profiles were 
necessary (p < 0.001), but 4 were not (p = 0.27)) and the minimum sample size adjusted Bayesian Information 
Criteria (BIC). Analyses were performed using PROC LCA and %LCABootstrap in SAS 9.460.
LCA was performed on the entire WHEALS cohort (n = 1,258 Mothers). We tested for measurement invar-
iance between the 130 that comprised the 1-month visit sample dataset and the remaining 1,128. No evidence 
was found to reject the null hypotheses that the underlying groups were different between those with and without 
microbiome data at the 1 month visit (p = 0.83), suggesting a valid result that is not unique to those subjects with 
neonatal microbiome data. This was consistent with our overall findings of only minimal demographic differences 
between cohort members included and excluded from MAAP (Supplementary Table S1).
Each subject was assigned to the MMP group with the highest posterior probability to provide descriptive 
characteristics to assist in interpretations and to test for the additional percent variation explained by MMP 
groups in the neonatal multi-factor adonis model. The mean maximum posterior probabilities for the 130 group 
were 0.74, 0.94 and 0.82, respectively for groups 1–3, indicating low classification error.
