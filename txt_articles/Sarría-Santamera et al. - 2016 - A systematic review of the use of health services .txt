Abstract
Background: Changes in migration patterns that have occurred in recent decades,
both quantitative, with an increase in the number of immigrants, and qualitative, due
to different causes of migration (work, family reunification, asylum seekers and
refugees) require constant u pdating of the analysis of how immigrants access health
services. Understanding of the existence of changes in use patterns is necessary to
adapt health services to the new socio-demographic reality. The aim of this study is
to describe the scientific evidence that assess the differences in the use of health
services between immigrant and native populations.
Methods: A systematic review of the electronic database MEDLINE (PubMed) was
conducted with a search of studies published between June 2013 and February 2016
that addressed the use of health services and compared immigrants with native
populations. MeSH terms and key words comprised Health Services Needs and
Demands/Accessibility/Disparities/Emigrants and Immigrants/Native/Ethnic Groups.
The electronic search was supplemented by a manual search of grey literature. The
following information was extracted from each publication: context of the study
(place and year), characteristics of the included population (definition of immigrants
and their sub-groups), methodological domains (design of the study, source of
information, statistical analysis, variables of health care use assessed, measures of
need, socio-economic indicators) and main results.
Results: Thirty-six publications were included, 28 from Europe and 8 from other
countries. Twenty-four papers analysed the use of primary care, 17 the use of
specialist services (including hospitalizations or emergency care), 18 considered
several levels of care and 11 assessed mental health services. The characteristics of
immigrants included country of origin, legal status, reasons for migration, length of
stay, different generations and socio-demographic variables and need. In general, use
of health services by the immigrants was less than or equal to the native population,
although some differences between immigrants were also identified.
Conclusions: This review has identified that immigrants show a general tendency
towards a lower use of health services than native populations and that there are
significant differences within immigrant sub-groups in terms of their patterns of
utilization. Further studies should include information categorizing and evaluating
the diversity within the immigrant population.

 Background
The number of international migrants continues to grow each year. According to the
United Nations Migration Report, the number of migrants has reached 244 million in
2015 up from 191 million in 2005, representing an increase of 28% over the decade in
comparison with an increase of 13% during the period 1990–2000 [1, 2].
Between 2000 and 2015, Europe has absorbed the second largest number of inter-
national migrants following Asia [1, 3]. Despite the global economic crisis which started
in 2007–2008, Europe and Northern America have recorded an annual growth rate in
the international migrant stock of 2% per year [1].
These transformations have both quantitative (i.e. an increasing number of migrants) and
qualitative (i.e. evolving reasons for migration) aspects. There is a trend towards permanent
migration and reunification of families with immigrant setting in the host country in a more
definitive way [4]. And most recently, we have seen an increasing number of asylum seekers
and refugees, which is reaching the highest levels seen since World War II [1].
This situation has generated various responses in the host countries, as immigration
is acquiring a significant social and political dimension. Immigration is influencing pub-
lic opinion and triggering a debate, often improperly informed, regarding the pressure
on public services—including health services [3]. This has even led to the adoption of
new legislation [5–7] limiting access to health care for migrants, that may pose, as a re-
sult, a risk to public health.
The dramatic changes in demographics, socio-economics and politics require an update
of the analysis of health service utilization by immigrants in order to properly determine
the breadth and scope of the current situation. Consequently, research on migrant access
and utilization of health services has proliferated in recent decades [8, 9]. Results from a
previous review point to a lower utilization rate of general and specialist medical services
by immigrants compared to native-born populations [10]. However, and since patterns of
healthcare utilization depend on factors that may have evolved in recent years, such as
age, sex, socio-economic level, time of stay in the host country or origin of the
immigrants, and the specific features of healthcare services of the host countries, it seems
necessary to revisit the state of knowledge on this subject.
The objective of this study is to describe the available scientific evidence that has in-
vestigated the differences in healthcare service utilization between immigrant and
native populations in the last 3 years (June 2013 through February 2016), and to ex-
plore the possible effect on the differential use of variables associated with health
needs, socio-economic status or other factors.
Methods
A systematic literature review was performed to identity the available empirical evi-
dence comparing immigrant’s healthcare utilization with native populations using a
predefined protocol [10]. Inclusion criteria for articles to be considered were original
studies with quantitative data that compared the use of healthcare services between na-
tive and immigrant populations. Service use was defined as the interaction between
health professionals and patients [11]. Only studies with both population groups prop-
erly defined, i.e. immigrant and native, were included. For the purposes of this review,
we used the European Union definition of immigrant status based on foreign country
of birth including up to the second generation [12].

 Papers that considered undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers and/or refugees
were also included. The indigenous majority population served as the native reference
group. No limitation in gender or ethnic characteristics was stipulated.
Articles were excluded if they (1) exclusively evaluated healthcare utilization for chil-
dren or adolescents younger than 18 years of age, (2) were editorials, letters or reviews
and (3) were qualitative studies.
Search strategy and study selection
Two strategies were utilized in the search for relevant articles on this review.
Firstly, in February 2016, a librarian conducted a systematic review of the electronic
database MEDLINE (PubMed) in search of the literature published between June 2013
and February 2016. No language restrictions were applied; no authors were contacted
for additional information. MeSH terms and key words used, as well as search strat-
egies performed, are shown in Table 1.
The initial screening of the articles was based on abstracts. Two researchers reviewed
all abstracts independently. Selection of relevant articles was based on the information ob-
tained from the abstracts and was agreed upon in discussion. If the abstract was not avail-
able, the full text was examined. In the case of discrepancies between the two researchers,
the original paper was obtained and an agreement was achieved after it was read.
Secondly, a researcher (AIHG) conducted a manual search of grey literature through
Google Scholar, including published papers from 2013 through February 2016 taking into
account the terms (Health care use; Comparison; Immigrants; Natives) and (Needs, demands
and barriers; Coverage; Primary care; Emergency services; Utilization patterns; Native; For-
eign; Autochthonous; Immigrant). Both English and Spanish web pages were included in the
search results. Appropriateness for inclusion was based on titles; in the event of doubt,
abstracts were retrieved. Studies without electronic abstracts were not included.
Subsequently, two researchers examined the full text of all papers that satisfied the
inclusion criteria (AIHG, ASS).
Data extraction
The following information were extracted from each publication: context of the study
(country and year), characteristics of the included population (definition of native and im-
migrants groups, sample size for each group), methodological components (design of the
study, statistical analysis, source of information), area of healthcare services assessed, con-
founders affecting healthcare utilization (individual determinants, measures of need,
socio-economic indicators, cultural factors), objective of the study and main results.
Results
Characteristics of the studies
Thirty-six papers met the inclusion criteria in this study. The process followed to in-
clude those papers is shown in Fig. 1. Table 2 shows the information extracted from
the included publications. Of the 36 studies included, 8 were duplicated in both the
manual and electronic search [13–20], 12 were included after the manual search [21–32]
and 16 through the electronic search [33–48]. Among them, at least 9 partly describe the

 same dataset [13–16, 19, 20, 25, 47, 48]. Nevertheless, as these articles focused on differ-
ent aspects of healthcare use or outcome measures, all were included in this review.
Distribution of studies regarding publication year was as follows: 8 studies published in
2013 [17, 22–24, 27, 28, 41, 42], 15 in 2014 [14–16, 19, 21, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, 43,
44, 47], 10 in 2015 [13, 18, 25, 26, 29, 31, 34, 45, 46, 48] and 3 in 2016 [20, 37, 39]. The
majority of the publications analysed data from European countries (28; 78%), both North
and Central (12) (Norway [13–15, 19, 20], Denmark [45], Sweden [35], the Netherlands
[17, 32, 34, 40] and Austria [41]) and South Europe (15) (France [22, 36], Italy [18, 24, 29,
37, 43], Spain [23, 27, 28, 31, 38, 39, 46] and Portugal [33]) and 1 from the UK [26]. Seven
papers (19%) explored this issue in North America (2 from USA [30, 34] and 5 from
Canada [16, 21, 25, 47, 48]); and 1 (3%) in Asia (Singapore) [42] (see Fig. 2).
Geographical coverage of the studies has some variation: 21 performed at the national
level [13–15, 17, 19–22, 28, 30, 32, 34–36, 38, 40, 41, 45–48], 10 at a regional level
[16, 18, 23, 25–27, 29, 31, 37, 44], 3 at a local level [28, 33, 42] and 1 multi-country study
[39] with data from a regional level of 1 country and the national level of the other. There
were only 4 longitudinal studies (2 prospective [18, 42] and 2 retrospective [27, 43]) and 1
case-control study [35]. Sample sizes ranged from 74 [35] to 7,856,348 [43]. Multivariable
regression (Poisson or logistic) was the most frequent analysis. Only 9 studies conducted
univariate analysis [29, 32, 33, 35, 38, 43, 48].
Sources of information
Service utilization could be assessed from two perspectives: the physician’s perspective,
based on recorded databases and volume of medical services, and the patient’s perspec-
tive, based on patient-reported use of services through healthcare surveys [49].
The largest number of papers (18) used information from administrative [13–16, 18–20,
23, 25, 29, 33, 35, 37, 39, 43] or insurance system databases [32, 34] and specific hospital

 registries [28] as source of information. Among the 16 papers (44.4%) that analysed
healthcare surveys, where people report their individual healthcare use, 14 studies used
population-based surveys which were elaborated for other purposes [17, 21, 22, 24, 26, 30,
36, 38, 40, 44, 46–48] while 3 of the surveys were specifically designed to explore immi-
grants healthcare use [31, 41, 42]. Only 2 studies [33, 45] (5.6%) combined health survey
and administrative information and 1 study also used a national survey for general practi-
tioners (GPs) [17].
Subjects
There were diverse definitions of immigrants. Country of birth was the most common
criteria used to define immigrants (18), or country of birth of the subject and their par-
ents (10). In addition, name recognition (2) [32, 34], citizenship (3) [18, 24, 28] or a
combination of citizenship and country of birth (3) [30, 42, 45] were also used.
The majority of papers classified the immigrant population in sub-groups usually
based on country of birth (13). However, some studies considered geographic area of
origin (8) or World Bank categories of income level (5). Other less frequent categories
considered were legal status (3), reason of migration (1), length of stay in the country
(3) and being first of second generation (1). Only 2 studies (5.6%) [18, 22] compared
the use of services considering the immigrant populations as a whole, without defining
specific sub-groups in those populations.
Findings
The outcome “healthcare service utilization” could be organized in seven focus areas:
primary care, specialist’s services, hospitalizations, emergency services, mental health,
dental care and medication prescription. Some studies reported on more than one out-
come. In total, 8 papers analysed the use of primary care (including GP visits, dental
care and physiotherapy) [13–15, 21, 27, 36, 44, 48], 6 evaluated the use of specialist ser-
vices (including hospitalizations or emergency care) [23, 28, 30, 33, 35, 42], 5 assessed
mental health services [17, 18, 20, 29, 45], 10 evaluated the use of both primary care
and specialists [22, 24, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 43, 46, 47], 2 evaluated primary care and men-
tal health [19, 40], 4 evaluated both primary care, mental health and hospitalizations
[16, 25, 26, 41] and 1 studied pharmaceutical use and prescriptions [39]. In addition, 6
studies also reported medication consumption [20, 31, 32, 37, 42, 43].
The measurement of healthcare utilization was either continuous (number of con-
tacts) or dichotomic (having had any contact). The period of time used to determine
utilization ranged from 4 weeks through 1 year.
The more frequent outcome was that immigrants have lower [17–20, 22, 25, 27, 28,
30, 33, 35, 40, 43, 44, 48] or similar [13, 21, 34, 36, 41, 42] healthcare utilization. How-
ever, studies that included analysis by sub-groups of immigrants identified some differ-
ences across groups [14–16, 23, 26, 31, 37, 39, 40, 45, 46] as well as with the type of
service assessed [14, 24, 29, 31, 32, 38, 40, 46, 47].
The immigrant population showed a similar [23, 24, 29, 31, 32, 34, 36–40, 46] or
lower [17, 18, 22, 27, 28, 33, 43] use of primary care and specialized care in countries
with universal access to health care—even for undocumented migrants [50]. This find-
ing was consistent regardless of the source of information used. In other countries,
Sarría-Santamera et al. Public Health Reviews  (2016) 37:28 
Page 24 of 29
 some differences were identified associated with the source of information: immi-
grants showed higher use of health services when estimates were based on surveys
[26, 41, 45], while their rates were lower [19, 20, 35] or similar [13–15] when
registries or administrative data were used.
Discussion
The main result of this review is that migrant populations appear to have a lower use of
health services than native populations, with a similar level of use of primary care services.
This result appears to be independent from differences in need of access. Nevertheless, the
great heterogeneity of the studies included in this review, considering both the sources of
information, as well as factors used for controlling health need and to classify immigrants in
sub-groups, requires caution when making an overall estimation valid for all immigrants.
Different sources of heterogeneity should be mentioned. First, and probably the factor with
the highest relevance, was the definition of immigrant and their characterization. This review
has identified several factors that could be involved with differences in healthcare utilization
among immigrants: income of the original native countries [13–15, 28, 38], the specific
reasons motivating migration [15, 16, 19, 25, 26], fluency in the host country language
[16, 17, 21, 25, 44, 45, 47] and length of time of stay [13, 15, 19–21, 26, 38, 45, 47, 48].
There were also differences in how medical need was determined and how to esti-
mate factors that predispose to healthcare use. The majority of studies assessed health
needs from the point of view of self-perceived health, and through commonly used
socio-demographic variables, such as education, income or working status, following
the model of Aday and Anderson [51, 52]. Multivariable models were adjusted by these
variables to eliminate the effect they could have on utilization, but whether they had a
differential influence on immigrants or native populations remains inconclusive.
Variables which could have a significant effect on healthcare service use and in par-
ticular for mental health care [53], such as health beliefs and cultural concepts on the
part of the immigrants, fear of stigmatization, taboos, perceived efficacy of health inter-
ventions or use of alternative services, were usually not considered. The effect of these
variables is most commonly explored through qualitative techniques, and papers that
used those methods were not included in this report.
Variation in countries’ healthcare systems limits direct cross-country comparisons, al-
though immigrants showed similar patterns of utilization in countries with significant dif-
ferences in their healthcare services. Nevertheless, studies reviewed pay little attention to
the structural and organizational dimensions of healthcare systems, other than reporting
the specific conditions for accessing health services. One paper explored the influence of
attitudes of professionals regarding immigrants [54], 2 studies assessed the reasons for un-
met healthcare need [31, 38] while 2 underscored the patient workload of healthcare pro-
fessionals [22, 23]. In addition, the effect that new legislation enacted in different
countries could have had on access to healthcare services by immigrants has not yet been
evaluated and published and therefore cannot be assessed in this review.
Attempting to expanding the scope of previous reviews, we tried not to constrain the
inclusion criteria regarding areas of healthcare services assessed [10, 55, 56], context of
the study (country) [54, 55], or characteristics of immigrants [54, 55].
This work adds also new information regarding the use of mental health services, both
in terms of primary [19, 26] and specialized mental services [16–18, 20, 25, 29, 41, 45].
Sarría-Santamera et al. Public Health Reviews  (2016) 37:28 
Page 25 of 29
 Nevertheless, and although immigrants have shown a higher susceptibility to emotional
and mental health problems that could be linked to the stressors of adapting to the host
country [57], those studies reported similar findings as for other health services: an overall
lower use by migrants, also with differences across sub-groups and with an occasional
higher use of emergency care.
This review also provides the opportunity to have an insight of the healthcare use of
certain vulnerable sub-groups, as the handicapped [13], the elderly [13, 15, 32, 37] or
patients with chronic conditions [21, 34, 36], but the pattern of use of those sub-groups
is similar to that of the general population, even when immigrants seem to have less
health problems than natives [13, 34], or a poorer health status [36]. Immigrants also
showed a higher use associated with longer periods of stay in the host countries [15, 21]
as well as significant differences of use among migrant sub-groups [32, 37].
The effect of gender differences was assessed most notably in papers evaluating the
use of mental health services [16, 19, 20, 25, 41, 45]. Nevertheless, no conclusive
evidence could be established: compared to their native counterparts, Straiton et al [19, 20]
and Durbin et al [16, 25] found a lower use of mental health services for immigrant
women, while Kerkenaar et al [41] and Smith-Nielsen et al. [45] found a higher use.
The possibility to analyse the use of different levels of care may help to determine the
existence of gaps in utilization (less use in one area could explain an increased use in
another area) or highlight the existence of different referral criteria (primary care spe-
cialists) [23]. De Luca et al. found [24] an over-utilization of emergency services associ-
ated with an under-utilization of preventive care services among the immigrant
population. Tormo et al. [31] and Díaz et al. [14] obtained similar results, although they
concluded that the higher use of emergency services did not compensate the lower use
of GPs. The identification of differences in pharmaceutical consumption could also lead
to identify particular health problems or economic barriers accentuated by the develop-
ment of restrictive health policies.
Lastly, the large number of European studies, particularly from western and central Eur-
ope, has to be highlighted, probably depicting the interest about the migratory pressure
these countries have faced in the last years—migration from Eastern Europe after the fall
of the Iron Curtain; from Latin America, North and sub-Saharan Africa; from internal
migration flows south-north after the economic crisis; or most recently, the refugee crisis.
Study limitations
The literature search was conducted only in one database (MEDLINE), although the
electronic search was manually completed using Google Scholar. There were implied
limitations in the manual search, since it was not systematized and was susceptible to
errors as it relied on title appropriateness (particularly for articles with ambiguous ti-
tles). Furthermore, no backward citation of the papers included in the systematic re-
view was performed. Additionally, the systematic search only identified 50% of the
papers accepted for inclusion, which raises some doubts regarding the intrinsic limita-
tions of the system to classify and assign terms to papers that compare the use of
healthcare services between native and migrants.
Finally, qualitative papers that explored the use of healthcare services were not
included, as it would be difficult to draw comparisons from these studies.

 Conclusions
Overall, and regardless of the changes in the immigration process, data here analysed is
coincident with results obtained in previous reviews [10, 54, 56], confirming that immi-
grants show a general tendency to a lower use of health services than native populations.
But these data also indicate the existence of differences within the immigrant populations,
reinforcing the conclusion that further studies intended to compare the rate of healthcare
use between native and immigrant populations should incorporate information that allows
for better identification and characterization of the immigrant population. The immigrant
population cannot be considered as a uniform whole. Their diversity has to be taking into
account when describing and analysing their healthcare utilization. This will also require
improvement and standardization of the information collected [55, 58].
In this sense, the limitations of health surveys have to be emphasized. Surveys are not
just subjected to memory bias, but they are less suited to be representative of all relevant
sub-groups of the immigrant population, as their samples usually do not include enough
participants to reflect the wide variability of the diverse immigrant population to estimate
their differential use. For instance, only one paper includes immigrants in irregular status
[44]. Therefore, the use of data that overcome these limitations has to be encouraged. Fur-
ther studies should be based on other information, such as registers, administrative or in-
surance data, or data from non-governmental organizations [59].
