The Cannabis sativa Versus Cannabis indica Debate:
An Interview with Ethan Russo, MD
Daniele Piomelli1,2,* and Ethan B. Russo3
Dr. Ethan Russo, MD, is a board-certified neurologist, psychopharmacology researcher, and Medical Director of
PHYTECS, a biotechnology company researching and developing innovative approaches targeting the human
endocannabinoid system. Previously, from 2003 to 2014, he served as Senior Medical Advisor and study physician
to GW Pharmaceuticals for three Phase III clinical trials of Sativex� for alleviation of cancer pain unresponsive to
optimized opioid treatment and studies of Epidiolex� for intractable epilepsy. He has held faculty appointments
in Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Montana, in Medicine at the University of Washington, and as
visiting Professor, Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is a past President of the International Cannabinoid Research
Society and former Chairman of the International Association for Cannabinoid Medicines. He serves on the Sci-
entific Advisory Board for the American Botanical Council. He is the author of numerous books, book chapters,
and articles on Cannabis, ethnobotany, and herbal medicine. His research interests have included correlations of
historical uses of Cannabis with modern pharmacological mechanisms, phytopharmaceutical treatment of mi-
graine and chronic pain, and phytocannabinoid/terpenoid/serotonergic/vanilloid interactions.
Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research (Dr. Daniele
Piomelli: CCR): I would like to start with a few
questions that should not be too contentious.
First off, what is the geographic origin of the Can-
nabis plant?
Dr. Russo: Cannabis originated in Central Asia and
perhaps the Himalayan foothills. There are converging
lines of evidence, including a center of biological diver-
sity there, and biochemical data that support this.
There is no trace of its presence in the Western Hemi-
sphere before the 16th century.
CCR: What chemical(s) are the major contributors
to
the
psychoactive
effects
of
Cannabis?
D9-
tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, or others?
Dr. Russo: D9-tetrahydrocannabinol is, of course, the
pre-eminent psychoactive component of Cannabis.
D8-tetrahydrocannabinol, a more heat-stable compo-
nent, is probably slightly less psychoactive, but is pres-
ent only in trace amounts or as an artifact of laboratory
analysis. Cannabinol is the nonenzymatic oxidative
breakdown product of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
seen in aged Cannabis, and is about 25% of the potency
of THC. Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) is a neutral
antagonist at CB1 at low doses, but an agonist at high
doses, and is certainly psychoactive, but rarely seen
in high titer in commonly available Cannabis strains.
Finally, although cannabidiol (CBD) is nonintoxicat-
ing, it certainly has antianxiety, antipsychotic, and
even antidepressant effects, so properly they must be
considered psychoactive with these qualifications.

 CCR: What about other medicinal properties of the
plant? For example, the local anti-inflammatory ac-
tions extolled by some ancient writers?
Dr. Russo: CBD is a versatile anti-inflammatory anal-
gesic through numerous distinct mechanisms, and var-
ious other minor cannabinoids and terpenoids in
Cannabis certainly may contribute notably to the ther-
apeutic profile of Cannabis. Numerous basic science
and even clinical trial data support the concept of
herbal synergy in Cannabis beyond the effects of single
components.1–3 We are only seeing the very beginnings
of the therapeutic potential of this plant!
CCR: Can you explain what is meant by entourage ef-
fect as it pertains to Cannabis?
Dr. Russo: This concept was first espoused by Drs.
Mechoulam and Ben-Shabat more than 15 years ago to
explain how certain components of the endocannabinoid
system boost the therapeutic effects of its main play-
ers, anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol.4,5 Thus, it
is akin to a symphony, in which many musicians support
and harmonize the melody provided by the soloists. The
same analogy fits well the synergistic phenomena ob-
served in Cannabis, whose various components boost
and compliment those of its better known ones, THC
and CBD.
CCR: People have been selecting Cannabis strains for
quite some time now. One would expect human se-
lection to have substantial effects on Cannabis’ psy-
choactive and medicinal properties. Is this true?
Dr. Russo: Absolutely! While there have always been
very potent Cannabis strains to be found, they are cer-
tainly more commonly available today due to selective
breeding and culture techniques that produce ganja, or
sinsemilla, that is, unfertilized female flowers. The plant
puts all its energy into production of cannabinoids and
Cannabis
terpenoids
instead
of
producing
seeds.
Unfortunately, until recently, almost all the effort in
breeding has been toward higher potency THC strains
rather than on the safer and arguably much more thera-
peutically versatile mixed or CBD predominant strains.
Selective breeding for medicinal efficacy is a relatively
new phenomenon that is now accelerating.
CCR: Now, moving onto something more controver-
sial. Here is a statement one can find on the Web: ‘‘It
is widely accepted that marijuana has two different
species: Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa.’’ This
was of course also the opinion of the great 18th cen-
tury naturalist, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, but would ac-
ademic botanists today agree with this statement?
Dr. Russo: Botanical taxonomists never agree on any-
thing for very long! To paraphrase and expropriate an
old Yiddish expression: 12 botanical taxonomists, 25
different opinions. Many classical botanists would
argue for Cannabis as one polymorphic species based
on the ability of all its types to interbreed. However,
if this were true, hundreds of neotropical gesneriads
(Gesneriaceae, members of the African violet family)
would all be one species since they readily hybridize
and produce fertile offspring. It is clear that there are
many chemotypes of Cannabis: THC predominant,
CBD predominant, and mixed types. This is a good
basic classification, but it has also been possible to se-
lectively breed for other chemotypes expressing high ti-
ters of THCV, cannabidivarin, cannabichromene, and
even ones producing 100% of its cannabinoids as can-
nabigerol, or others with no cannabinoids at all. The
debate continues. Some espouse Cannabis as a single
species, while others describe up to four: Cannabis sat-
iva, Cannabis indica, Cannabis ruderalis, and Cannabis
afghanica (or kafiristanica).6,7
CCR: Some users describe the psychoactive effects of
Cannabis indica and sativa as being distinctive, even
opposite. But are they really? Beyond self-reports
from users, is there any hard evidence for pharmaco-
logically different species of Cannabis?
Dr. Russo: There are biochemically distinct strains of
Cannabis, but the sativa/indica distinction as commonly
applied in the lay literature is total nonsense and an ex-
ercise in futility. One cannot in any way currently guess
the biochemical content of a given Cannabis plant based
on its height, branching, or leaf morphology. The degree
of interbreeding/hybridization is such that only a bio-
chemical assay tells a potential consumer or scientist
what is really in the plant. It is essential that future com-
merce allows complete and accurate cannabinoid and
terpenoid profiles to be available.
CCR: Sativa is often described as being uplifting and
energetic, whereas indica as being relaxing and calm-
ing. Can you speculate on what could be the basis for
these perceived differences?

 Dr. Russo: We would all prefer simple nostrums to
explain complex systems, but this is futile and even
potentially dangerous in the context of a psychoactive
drug such as Cannabis. Once again, it is necessary to
quantify the biochemical components of a given Can-
nabis strain and correlate these with the observed ef-
fects in real patients. Beyond the increasing number
of CBD predominant strains in recent years, almost
all Cannabis on the market has been from high-
THC strains. The differences in observed effects in
Cannabis are then due to their terpenoid content,
which is rarely assayed, let alone reported to potential
consumers. The sedation of the so-called indica
strains is falsely attributed to CBD content when, in
fact, CBD is stimulating in low and moderate doses!
Rather, sedation in most common Cannabis strains
is attributable to their myrcene content, a monoter-
pene with a strongly sedative couch-lock effect that
resembles a narcotic. In contrast, a high limonene
content (common to citrus peels) will be uplifting
on mood, while the presence of the relatively rare
terpene in Cannabis, alpha-pinene, can effectively re-
duce or eliminate the short-term memory impair-
ment classically induced by THC.2,8
CCR: How do you think one could address the sativa/
indica dichotomy in a scientifically sound manner?
Dr. Russo: Since the taxonomists cannot agree, I would
strongly encourage the scientific community, the press,
and the public to abandon the sativa/indica nomencla-
ture and rather insist that accurate biochemical assays
on cannabinoid and terpenoid profiles be available
for Cannabis in both the medical and recreational mar-
kets. Scientific accuracy and the public health demand
no less than this.
CCR: Thank you, Dr. Russo. We all appreciate your in-
sight into this controversial, complex, and very impor-
tant topic.
