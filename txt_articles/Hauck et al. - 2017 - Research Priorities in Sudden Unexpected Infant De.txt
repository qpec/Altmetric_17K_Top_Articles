Despite the success of safe sleep campaigns and the progress in 
understanding risk factors, the rate of reduction in the cases of sudden 
infant death syndrome has now slowed and it remains a leading cause 
of postneonatal mortality in many developed countries. Strategic action 
is needed to tackle this problem and it is now vital to identify how the 
sudden infant death research community may best target its efforts. The 
Global Action and Prioritization of Sudden Infant Death Project was an 
international consensus process that aimed to define and direct future 
research by investigating the priorities of expert and lay members of the 
sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) community across countries. 
The aim was to identify which areas of research should be prioritized 
to reduce the number of SUID deaths globally. Scientific researchers, 
clinicians, counselors, educators, and SUID parents from 25 countries 
took part across 2 online surveys to identify potential research priorities. 
Workshops subsequently took place in the United Kingdom, United States, 
and Australia to reach consensus and 10 priority areas for research were 
established. Three main themes among the priorities emerged: (1) a better 
understanding of mechanisms underlying SUID, (2) ensuring best practice 
in data collection, management and sharing, and (3) a better understanding 
of target populations and more effective communication of risk. SUID is a 
global problem and this project provides the international SUID community 
with a list of shared research priorities to more effectively work toward 
explaining and reducing the number of sudden infant deaths.

Twenty-five years ago, research into 
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS, 
also known as crib death or cot death) 
led to a breakthrough that has since 
saved thousands of lives globally.  
A series of case-control studies 
identified that, among other factors, 
infants who slept on their stomachs 
were significantly more likely to die of 
SIDS than infants who slept on their 
backs.1 This research led to the Back to 
Sleep campaign, which was launched 
in the 1990s in many countries around 
the world, reducing the number of 
deaths from SIDS almost immediately 
by at least 50% in the United States, 
United Kingdom, and Australia among 
other countries targeted.2 Subsequent 
findings of other risk factors in the 
infant sleeping environment has led 
to a slower but additional fall in SIDS 
rates.
There is now a well-established 
evidence base for risk factors both 
intrinsic and extrinsic to the infant. 
These have been integrated in a triple 
risk model, which provides a useful 
framework for understanding how

a critical developmental period, 
underlying predisposition, and 
environmental factors together 
produce an acute vulnerability.3 
SIDS is a subset of the broader 
classification of sudden unexpected 
infant death (SUID, or sudden 
unexpected death in infancy). SUID 
is described as the sudden and 
unexpected death of an infant <1 
year of age, usually during sleep. The 
cause of death is usually assigned 
after a thorough case investigation, 
including scene investigation, 
autopsy, and a review of the clinical 
history. Death may be explained or 
unexplained. When a cause can be 
found, the most common diagnoses 
are infection, cardiovascular 
disorders, metabolic or genetic 
disorders, and asphyxia, 
4  
although this last diagnosis is often 
based on circumstantial evidence.5 
The International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code 
for SIDS is assigned as the cause 
of death when the death remains 
unexplained, although increasing 
knowledge of associated risk factors 
has led to a reluctance among some 
pathologists to use the classification 
code for SIDS in exchange 
for alternative codes such as 
“unascertained, 
” “undetermined, 
” or 
because of associated sleep-related 
unintentional injuries.2, 
6, 
 
7 This 
diagnostic shift is unhelpful for both 
monitoring and research purposes, 
especially as the strength of evidence 
of a causal relationship on a case-by-
case basis is often limited. Matters 
are complicated further as the 
umbrella term SUID does not have an 
ICD-10 code and thus cannot be used 
as a proxy to resolve this debate. 
Despite the obvious success of the 
safe sleep campaigns, and progress 
in understanding risk factors, the 
rate of reduction in the numbers 
of SIDS cases has now slowed, 
2 
and SIDS remains a leading cause 
of postneonatal mortality in many 
developed countries (the leading 
cause in some).8 In 2015, provisional 
estimated rates of SUID not yet 
published by the Office of National 
Statistics were 0.255 out of 1000 live 
births in England and Wales, 0.4 out 
of 1000 live births in Australia, 
9  
and 0.926 out of 1000 live births in 
the United States.10 These statistics 
include SIDS cases (ICD-10 code 
R95), deaths that are ill-defined or of 
unknown cause (ICD-10 code R99) 
and cases of accidental strangulation 
and suffocation in bed (ICD-10 code 
W75).
Ongoing research aims to better 
understand both underlying and 
proximate causes of SUID with 
the ultimate aim of explaining and 
reducing the number of deaths across 
different countries. However, partly 
as a result of the perceived success 
of the risk reduction campaigns, 
research into SUID has become less 
well-funded and the international 
SUID research community is 
relatively small. There are also 
differences of opinion, between 
and within national research 
communities, on the implementation 
of certain risk reduction advice, 
such as bed-sharing.11, 
 
12 
Furthermore, classification and 
formal investigation procedures also 
vary widely between and within 
countries.5, 
 
6, 
13 This lack of consensus, 
although an inevitable part of 
research and data collection, impedes 
the prioritization and coordination of 
clear, culturally-appropriate public 
health campaigns that are needed 
to ultimately reduce deaths and the 
means to monitor such reduction.
Given limited resources 
internationally, it is vital to 
identify how the SUID research 
community should best direct its 
efforts. To better inform these 
efforts, we report on the Global 
Action and Prioritization of Sudden 
infant death (GAPS) project, an 
international consensus process 
that aimed to define and direct 
future SUID research, specifically 
by systematically determining the 
priorities of both expert and lay 
members of the SUID community 
across countries.
The aim of the GAPS project was 
to identify which areas of research 
should be prioritized by the 
international research community 
and policy makers to reduce the 
number of SIDS and other SUID 
deaths globally. The objectives of the 
project were to: (1) decide where 
research efforts should be focused to 
have the greatest impact on reducing 
the number of SUID, and (2) establish 
consensus on the top research 
priorities across different countries, 
and between expert and lay members 
of the SUID community.
MeThODs
The GAPS project was coordinated 
by The Lullaby Trust, a UK-based 
charity that provides support for 
bereaved families, raises awareness 
on sudden infant death, and provides 
evidence-based advice on safe infant 
sleep. The project was overseen by 
a multidisciplinary steering group 
from the United Kingdom, United 
States, and Australia, composed of 
Ms Bates, Dr Hauck, Dr Blair, Dr 
McEntire, and Adjunct Associate Prof 
Raven, whose expertise spans SUID 
research, clinical care, public health, 
epidemiology, health education, 
advocacy, and bereavement support. 
The steering group members are all 
board members of the International 
Society for the Prevention of 
Perinatal and Infant Death (ISPID), 
who endorsed and supported the 
project from its beginning. UK-based 
physicians with expertise in SUID 
provided additional support on 
survey content and structure. 
Pediatric pathologist Dr Steve Gould 
assisted the preliminary screening 
of survey 1 results and Dr Alexis 
Willett and Dr Jennifer Barnett, 
independent research and medical 
communications consultants, 
provided guidance throughout the 
project.

The project followed an expanded 
methodology of a priority-setting 
partnership model of the James 
Lind Alliance (JLA), as described 
in the JLA Handbook.14 As GAPS 
was an international project, the 
expansion of the model enabled the 
inclusion of multiple workshops 
and their findings, rather than 1 
workshop typically undertaken 
in the model (Fig 1). The priority-
setting partnership model is a type 
of nominal group process in which 
the use of a facilitator to lead group 
discussions has been shown to be 
effective in enabling all participants 
to express their views without 1 
group or perspective dominating.15 
The method has been successfully 
applied in contentious areas of health 
care to identify shared research 
priorities, such as in sight loss, 
16 
palliative care, 
17 and stillbirth.18
survey 1: Gathering Initial Research 
Priorities
Initial research suggestions were 
captured in an online survey. Over 
100 members of ISPID (scientific 
researchers, clinicians, counselors, 
educators, and SUID family 
members) as well as other parents 
and professionals affiliated with 
ISPID were invited to take part 
during the spring of 2015. Five 
open-ended questions were asked to 
identify potential research topics (see 
Supplemental Table 5).
The potential research topics 
generated from Survey 1 were 
reviewed and grouped into categories 
by an independent research 
consultant and a consultant pediatric 
pathologist with SUID expertise (as 
listed in the Acknowledgments). 
They excluded duplicates and 
reviewed the remainder by using 
PubMed and recent reviews8, 
 
19 to 
ascertain whether each suggestion 
was likely to be feasible in the next 
10 years and ensuring that it had not 
already been adequately addressed 
by previous research. The steering 
group assessed the resulting list with 
respect to each statement’s potential 
to impact SUID prevention based on 
current evidence. Those considered 
to have limited potential were 
excluded. The remaining suggestions 
were refined into a list of statements 
for ranking by participants in a 
second survey. The statements were 
grouped into 2 main categories: 
(1) those relating to specific areas 
of research (research priorities), 
comprising the majority of the 
statements, and (2) those relating to 
broader research principles (working 
principles), considered secondary 
to the research priorities, although 
of importance for underpinning 
high quality research. The 2 groups 
of statements were subsequently 
evaluated separately, with the 
emphasis placed on the research 
priorities.
survey 2: Rating Research Priorities
A second online survey (see 
Supplemental Table 6) was 
implemented to prioritize the 
statements brought forward from 
survey 1. The target recipients of 
the survey were family members 
bereaved by the sudden and 
unexpected loss of an infant and 
professionals working in an area 
related to SUID. The survey link 
was emailed to all professionals 
and parents who had consented to 
receiving the participating charities’ 
communications, and was also 
publicized on the participating 
charities’ Web sites, social media, 
and newsletters. A paper copy of the 
survey was available to participants 
reporting difficulty completing the 
survey online. Responses were 
gathered over a 4-week period from 
October 2015 to November 2015.
The survey asked participants to 
state which country they were based 
in, their experience or expertise 
in relation to SUID, and to rate a 
series of statements on research 
priorities based on how important

they thought they were for reducing 
the rate of SUID in the next 10 
years. Participants were asked 
to rate each statement on a scale 
from 1 (not important) to 5 (very 
important), allowing for don’t know 
(0). Participants were asked to take 
into account achievability, timescale, 
cost, and number of lives potentially 
saved.
A mean score was calculated for each 
statement and they were ranked 
in order from highest to lowest 
score. The 30 top-ranking research 
priorities were taken forward for 
discussion at the prioritization 
workshops, the maximum number 
advised by the JLA for manageability.
survey 2: Rating Working Principles
In addition to rating research 
priorities in survey 2, participants 
also rated the extent to which they 
agreed with each of the working 
principles (1 = do not agree, 5 = 
strongly agree, 0 = don’t know). 
The working principles were also 
ranked based on their scores and the 
steering group agreed to take the 
top 10 forward to the workshops for 
additional ranking.
Workshops: Research Priorities
Three workshops were held, 
one each in the United Kingdom, 
United States, and Australia, to 
bring together invited SUID family 
members and professionals to decide 
which of the 30 research priorities 
should comprise the final top 10 
research priorities. Participants 
were invited by the charities 
involved in the GAPS project, based 
on their high level of expertise in 
their field, or capacity to share their 
personal experience of SUID. For 
each workshop, the participants 
included a balanced representation 
of stakeholders including SUID family 
members and professionals working 
in wide-ranging areas related to 
SUID. The workshops, as outlined in 
 
Fig 2, were led by facilitators trained 
in the JLA process.
To produce a final list of 10 research 
priorities from the outcomes of all 3 
workshops, an aggregate score was 
applied. The score for each research 
priority was based on the sum of 
its final rank at each workshop. 
For example, if a statement ranked 
first, second and fourth across the 
3 workshops, the aggregate score 
was 7. The aggregate scores were 
subsequently ordered from lowest 
to highest, with the lowest score 
indicating the highest priority.
Workshops: Working Principles
The 10 working principles were 
not included in the discussion 
process but participants at the 
workshops were asked to indicate 
those that they felt were most 
important by marking sheets with 
the principles printed on them. The 
5 principles with the most votes at 
each workshop were considered the 
priorities.
ResUlTs
survey 1
Survey 1 generated 79 complete 
responses. This equated to 48% of 
the original target list. However, 
people who received the survey 
also shared the link with others 
and, therefore, the exact number 
of people who received the survey, 
and the corresponding response 
rate, is unknown. People from 19 
different countries participated 
(Table 1). Twenty-eight percent of 
responses came from the United 
States, with significant numbers also 
from the United Kingdom (15%) 
and the Netherlands (14%). SUID 
family members accounted for 11% 
of respondents and the remainder 
were professionals with expertise 
in SUID. There were 516 proposed 
suggestions, of which 144 remained 
after grouping. After the literature 
review, 41 research priorities and 
15 working principles were taken 
forward to the second survey to

confirm feasibility and potential for 
future impact on SUID.
survey 2
Survey 2 received 612 completed 
responses. As this survey was 
also advertised via Web sites and 
social media, it was not possible to 
calculate the response rate. People 
from 18 different countries took 
part (Table 1). Almost half of the 
responses came from the United 
Kingdom (49%), with a strong 
representation from Australia 
(27%) and the United States (17%). 
Responses were split almost equally 
between researchers and health 
care professionals (40% in total) 
and SUID family members (38%), 
with non-health care professionals 
(people working in social work, 
education, child care, bereavement 
support, lactation support, and the 
charity sector) and other interested 
members of the public providing the 
remainder. Health care professionals 
who were also SUID family members 
were counted as professional if 
their specialty was related to SUID 
(eg, pediatrics, SUID surveillance). 
There was some variation among the 
stakeholder groups in their ranking 
of the research priorities (see 
Supplemental Information). In many 
cases, non-health care professionals 
ranked priorities differently than 
other stakeholder groups. Despite 
some variation in thinking, all of 
the top 10 highest ranked research 
priorities of both the health care 
professionals and the SUID family 
members ended up in the final top 
20. The workshop process provided 
the opportunity to talk through 
differences and achieve consensus.
Workshops
The number and proportion of SUID 
family members to professionals 
varied between each workshop. 
SUID family members comprised 
between 16% and 24% of each 
workshop, with the remainder 
mainly health care professionals 
(Table 2). Distinct themes emerged 
during discussions for the 2 main 
stakeholder groups: SUID family 
members tended to prioritize 
identifying physiologic mechanisms 
involved in SUID, although health 
care professionals also had a focus 
on improving education around 
safe sleep. Consensus within each 
workshop was achieved for the top 
10 research priorities. There was also 
considerable consensus across the 
3 workshops. Taking into account 
minor wording alterations requested 
at the workshops, the research 
priorities (Table 3) included 3 broad 
themes.
Better Understanding of Mechanisms 
Underlying SUID
Over half of the research priorities 
emphasize the need to better 
understand what biological 
mechanisms are in play in SUID,

how environmental factors interact 
with such mechanisms, and the 
subsequent need to identify 
associated biomarkers to assist 
pathologists in determining the 
cause of death. Understanding how 
mechanisms that underlie SUID may 
differ at different ages and levels of 
maturation is also seen as important. 
Some of the other mechanistic 
research priorities from the original 
list of 30 were determined to easily 
be subsumed within these priority 
areas. A few of the priorities within 
this theme are as follows:
 
• Priority 1: Studying mechanisms 
leading to death and how they 
interact with environmental risk 
factors;
 
• Priority 5: Identifying specific 
biomarkers to assist pathologists in 
determining the cause of death;
 
• Priority 6: Understanding the role 
of genetic factors in SUID risk;
 
• Priority 7: Understanding what 
mechanisms underlie SUID risk at 
different ages;
 
• Priority 8: Conducting additional 
research on the role of abnormal 
or immature brain anatomy and 
physiology; and
 
• Priority 10: Identifying what 
factors are associated with SUID in 
which all aspects of recommended 
risk reduction have been followed.
Ensuring Best Practice Data Collection, 
Management, and Sharing
Differences in the classification 
of SUID across the world, as well 
as varying quality in the practice 
of data collection and sharing, 
was considered to be a significant 
hindrance to our understanding 
of SUID and to research progress. 
Addressing these issues was agreed 
to be a matter of great importance. 
The priority within this theme is as 
follows:
 
• Priority 2: Enabling best practice 
processes and systematic 
data collection for accurate 
classification of SUID deaths to 
inform research and prevention.

Better Understanding of Target 
Populations and More Effective 
Communication of Risk
To further decrease SUID rates, 
participants stressed that more 
research is required to better 
understand the behavior and needs 
of target populations. As we learn 
more about potential causes of SUID 
and how to reduce risk and the 
requirements of target populations, 
it was stressed that a priority should 
be to communicate these effectively 
and develop impactful, evidence-
based behavior change campaigns. 
Priorities within this theme are as 
follows:
 
• Priority 3: Developing and 
evaluating new ways to make safe 
sleep campaigns more effective;
 
• Priority 4: Understanding to what 
extent social and cultural factors 
affect parental choice in sleep 
practices and responses to risk 
reduction campaigns; and
 
• Priority 9: Better understanding of 
the practice of sharing any sleep 
surface with an infant, notably how 
it interacts with other factors to 
make it more or less risky.
Working Principles
There was significant variation in 
the ranking of the top 5 working 
principles among the workshops. 
The working principles are therefore 
summarized by indicating the 
number of workshops that scored 
each in its top 5, and therefore were 
considered a priority (Table 4). Only 
1 principle was prioritized by all 
3 workshops: “There should be a 
standardized and common approach 
to postmortems in all SUID cases.” 
Five other principles were ranked as 
important by 2 out of 3 workshops.
DIscUssIOn
The rate of decline in sudden infant 
death has slowed in the last decade 
in many developed countries and 
strategic action needs to be taken 
if SUID rates are to be significantly 
reduced further. The GAPS project 
achieved international consensus 
from the SUID community on the top 
10 priorities for research to inform 
researchers, funders, and policy 
makers in the shared aim of reducing 
SUID rates. Three main themes 
among the priorities emerged: (1) a 
better understanding of mechanisms 
underlying SUID, (2) ensuring best 
practice data collection, management 
and sharing, and (3) a better 
understanding of target populations 
and more effective communication of 
risk. These themes reflect the future 
goal of the entire SUID community 
to prevent SUID deaths: (a) by 
identifying underlying mechanisms 
that can be prevented, (b) by sharing 
high-quality data to inform best 
practice and accurate classification 
of SUID deaths, and (c) by effectively 
partnering with communities most 
vulnerable to SUID through culturally 
sensitive methods. Collaboration 
among countries is imperative to 
share best practice, monitor progress, 
and achieve statistical power for 
future investigations.
The top 10 research priorities 
(Table 3) represent areas that are 
considered by our participating 
international community of informed 
stakeholders to have the most 
potential to reduce the rate of SUID. 
Rather than form narrow research 
questions, they allow researchers 
room to interpret and refine them 
into a particular focus, thus enabling 
investigators with different expertise 
to add knowledge to the same 
topic from different perspectives. 
Although every priority topic 
originally proposed was felt to have 
potential at an earlier stage in the 
consensus process, the GAPS project 
has identified research priorities 
with the most support from the SUID 
community.
Although the working principles 
were not a primary focus of this 
project, they revealed the need to 
also improve processes to enable 
better SUID research. No clear order 
of priority in the working principles 
was achieved among countries. 
Although the discussion process in 
the workshops enabled participants 
to reach consensus on the research 
priorities, the working principles 
were not discussed as a group, which

There should be a standardized and common approach to postmortems in all SUID cases.

We need to move from single factor prevention approaches to addressing multidimensional risks such as smoking, poverty, 
and unsafe sleeping acting together.
All SUID should be studied, not just SIDS or unexplained deaths.
We need up-to-date data. We should carry out large-scale studies equivalent to those conducted before risk reduction 
campaigns to discover how vulnerability factors have changed. This may require an international collaborative study.
We should embed SUID research in larger programs of infant safety or wellbeing research to attract more funding.
We should improve the evidence base for the interpretation of post mortem findings.

We should prioritize evaluation of health service delivery programs for vulnerable families.
SUID awareness and prevention should be mandatory in the training of all health care and early-years professionals.

We should lobby government to fund SUID awareness/prevention strategies.
Developed countries should collaborate with lower-resourced countries so that they can learn from each other about 
successful prevention strategies.

may account for the variability in 
their ranking. Regardless, the final 
list of working principles, prioritized 
by stakeholders through the survey 
process, provides fundamental 
guidance as to the key approaches 
required to achieve meaningful 
progress in SUID research.
The GAPS project was the first of its 
kind to bring together the expertise 
of both professionals and the lay 
community to identify which areas 
of research should be prioritized 
to reduce the number of sudden 
unexpected deaths in infancy. The 
importance of lay participation in 
setting the research agenda in health 
care is becoming well-established 
and offers the benefit of ensuring 
that future research is grounded 
in day-to-day reality20 as well as a 
way of democratically legitimizing 
decision-making.21 The involvement 
of SUID family members has always 
been important in the history of 
SUID, indeed parent groups have 
been a driving force behind the Back 
to Sleep campaign and subsequent 
initiatives. However, little has been 
known about what kind of research 
they would like to see. Many of 
our advances in research would 
not have been possible without 
the efforts of families and so it is 
important that they have been 
included in this project. In addition, 
although the GAPS project followed 
a nominal groups approach based 
on the JLA model, it was unique 
in that it gathered opinions from 
around the world. No project has 
conducted priority setting workshops 
in multiple countries to achieve 
international consensus on a topic, 
utilizing a global opinion survey as a 
base. This approach aimed to secure 
greater buy-in to the results from 
the multistakeholder global SUID 
community and lends additional 
weight to the results.
Within the workshops, it was 
informative to observe the pattern 
of differing priorities between 
SUID family members and health 
care professionals, which was also 
supported by survey 2 data. Perhaps 
this is reflective of the need for 
SUID family members to obtain 
specific answers for why their infant 
died, whereas for professionals the 
experience of dealing with cases in 
which infants died in unsafe sleep 
surroundings may inform their 
priorities. Despite these influences, 
it is encouraging that there was 
much overlap in viewpoints and all 
participants were able to share their 
perspectives and mutually agree on 
the final research priorities.
There were a number of limitations 
to this project. Language (both 
scientific language as well as the 
English language) might have proven 
a barrier for some people in taking 
part in the surveys, regardless of 
category of expertise. The wording of 
each research statement attempted 
to be as accessible as possible, but 
it may have prevented some people 
from taking part. The findings of this 
project can only be representative 
of the people who took part. 
Although people from 25 different 
countries participated, reflecting 
the widespread nature of the SUID 
research community and the global 
importance of SUID, the workshops 
only took place in 3 countries where 
the final priorities were established. 
Furthermore, although a number 
of individuals from developing 
countries participated in the surveys, 
the large majority of the project 
participants were from developed 
countries. As such, the findings may 
not reflect the priorities of those in 
developing countries. In addition, 
it is not known how representative 
the survey was of different racial or 
socioeconomic groups, which are 
affected differently by SUID. SUID 
family members were significantly 
better represented in survey 2 than 
survey 1, so a different range of 
priorities might have been identified 
if more families had been included 
at an earlier stage. Furthermore, 
this exercise only included research 
that could potentially reduce the 
rate of SUID and did not look at 
how to best to help families who 
have experienced SUID. This is an 
important area currently limited 
by a dearth of evidence, and one 
that might benefit from a future 
prioritization effort.

SUID is a global problem and the 
international SUID community 
now has a list of shared research 
priorities to make targeted progress 
in ultimately preventing more SUID 
cases. These priorities offer a unique 
opportunity for global action and 
for pooling limited resources and 
capitalizing on the expertise of 
colleagues in many countries. All 
researchers, funders, and policy 
makers working in the field of infant 
mortality are urged to implement 
the research priorities, supported by 
the working principles, at both the 
individual country and international 
organizational levels to maximize 
impact globally.
Beyond the areas of international 
agreement, 3 countries also achieved 
consensus on their own research 
priorities. The United Kingdom, 
United States, and Australia are 
now equipped with their own top 
10 research priorities reflective of 
their own particular interests and 
needs. These countries have an 
important opportunity to use these 
resources to strategically guide 
policies and processes that will most 
effectively address SUID in their own 
populations and circumstances.
To aid the international SUID 
community in maintaining a shared 
vision over the long-term, progress 
on the identified research priorities 
should be reviewed in 5 years. The 
review should reflect upon lessons 
learned over the 5 years and use the 
new evidence base to inform whether 
future priorities need to be revised or 
expanded.
