ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To study the effectiveness and safety of the non-
vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (novel oral 
anticoagulants, NOACs) dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and 
apixaban compared with warfarin in anticoagulant 
naïve patients with atrial fibrillation.
Design
Observational nationwide cohort study.
setting
Three Danish nationwide databases, August 2011 to 
October 2015.
PartiCiPants
61 678 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who 
were naïve to oral anticoagulants and had no previous 
indication for valvular atrial fibrillation or venous 
thromboembolism. The study population was 
distributed according to treatment type: warfarin 
(n=35 436, 57%), dabigatran 150 mg (n=12 701, 21%), 
rivaroxaban 20 mg (n=7192, 12%), and apixaban 5 mg 
(n=6349, 10%).
Main OutCOMe Measures
Effectiveness outcomes defined a priori were 
ischaemic stroke; a composite of ischaemic stroke or 
systemic embolism; death; and a composite of 
ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism, or death. Safety 
outcomes were any bleeding, intracranial bleeding, 
and major bleeding.
results
When the analysis was restricted to ischaemic stroke, 
NOACs were not significantly different from warfarin. 
During one year follow-up, rivaroxaban was associated 
with lower annual rates of ischaemic stroke or systemic 
embolism (3.0% v 3.3%, respectively) compared with 
warfarin: hazard ratio 0.83 (95% confidence interval 
0.69 to 0.99). The hazard ratios for dabigatran and 
apixaban (2.8% and 4.9% annually, respectively) were 
non-significant compared with warfarin. The annual 
risk of death was significantly lower with apixaban 
(5.2%) and dabigatran (2.7%) (0.65, 0.56 to 0.75 and 
0.63, 0.48 to 0.82, respectively) compared with 
warfarin (8.5%), but not with rivaroxaban (7.7%). For 
the combined endpoint of any bleeding, annual rates 
for apixaban (3.3%) and dabigatran (2.4%) were 
significantly lower than for warfarin (5.0%) (0.62, 0.51 
to 0.74). Warfarin and rivaroxaban had comparable 
annual bleeding rates (5.3%).
COnClusiOn
All NOACs seem to be safe and effective alternatives to 
warfarin in a routine care setting. No significant 
difference was found between NOACs and warfarin for 
ischaemic stroke. The risks of death, any bleeding, or 
major bleeding were significantly lower for apixaban 
and dabigatran compared with warfarin.
Introduction
Oral anticoagulant treatment with either vitamin K 
antagonists or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoag-
ulants (novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs) is essential 
for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism and 
all cause mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation 
and one or more risk factors for stroke. The four cur-
rently available NOACs are dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 
apixaban, and edoxaban.1-4  In clinical studies these 
drugs show similar efficacy and safety to warfarin, but 
with more convenience such as no requirement of 
meticulous dose adjustment to achieve optimal treat-
ment. NOACs are therefore the preferred treatment 
option in some guidelines, especially where anticoagu-
lation control with warfarin is suboptimal.5
A meta-analysis showed that NOACs at standard dose 
have a favourable risk-benefit profile compared with 
warfarin, with significant reductions in stroke or sys-
temic embolism, intracranial haemorrhage, and mor-
tality, but a similar major bleeding profile to warfarin, 
apart from increased gastrointestinal bleeding.6 The 
relative efficacy and safety of NOACs were consistent 
across a wide range of patients.
Thus the use of NOACs in daily clinical practice has 
been increasing since their introduction.7 Only large 
scale real world comparisons of a single NOAC versus 
warfarin have been published or presented. Evidence 
relating to the comparative effectiveness and safety of 
all oral anticoagulant drugs used in clinical practice is 
currently lacking.

We assessed and compared the effectiveness and 
safety of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban com-
pared with warfarin in clinical practice using a nation-
wide Danish cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation 
who were naïve to oral anticoagulants.
Methods
This study is based on data from three Danish nation-
wide databases: the Danish national prescription 
 
registry,8  which holds information on purchase date, 
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification 
code, and package size for every prescription claimed 
since 1994; the Danish national patient register9 
 
 
established in 1977
, which includes admission and dis-
charge dates, and discharge diagnoses (international 
classification of diseases) for more than 99% of hospital 
admissions; and the Danish civil registration system,10 
with information on sex, date of birth, and vital and 
emigration status. Any individual in Denmark has a 
unique identification number, allowing linkage at indi-
vidual level between databases.
study population
We identified people with a first time purchase of a 
NOAC: apixaban (introduced 10 December 2012), dabig-
atran (1 August 2011), rivaroxaban (1 February 2012), as 
well as patients who started warfarin treatment (from 1 
August 2011) up to 30 November 2015. All prescribed 
drugs in Denmark are partially reimbursed, based on a 
patient’s level of drug expenses.
To study a cohort of patients treated for atrial fibril-
lation, we applied several criteria. We restricted the 
 
consumption of NOACs to standard doses (apixaban 5 
mg twice daily, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, and 
rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily). Warfarin is only avail-
able in 2.5 mg dose tablets in Denmark. We decided to 
focus our analyses on patients receiving standard dos-
ages of apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, 
because patients who receive reduced dosage regimens 
have more comorbidities and are of more advanced age 
(>80 years). Thus, comparisons across various dosing 
regimens and choices of antithrombotic agent could 
result in comparisons on mixed cohorts in terms of 
comorbidities, age, and concomitant treatment. Con-
fining the analysis to patients receiving standard dos-
ages only will thus allow for easier interpretation and a 
more robust comparison of cohorts. To establish a 
cohort of patients who were naïve to oral anticoagulant 
treatment, we excluded those who had used any oral 
anticoagulant within one year. We also excluded 
patients with hospital diagnoses indicating valvular 
atrial fibrillation (mitral stenosis or mechanical heart 
valves) or venous thromboembolism (pulmonary 
embolism or deep vein thrombosis) to narrow the 
included patients to only those who were likely to have 
been prescribed oral anticoagulants because of a diag-
nosis of atrial fibrillation in either hospital or general 
practice. The entire cohort comprised patients with 
atrial fibrillation. We also analysed a subgroup of 
patients who had been admitted to hospital with a 
diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
endpoints and variable definitions
Participants were followed until 30 November 2015 in 
the Danish national patient register for the occurrence 
of ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism and for isch-
aemic stroke separately (see supplementary table 1 for 
specific international classification of diseases, 10th 
revision codes). The outcome of ischaemic stroke has 
been validated, with a positive predictive value of more 
than 97%.11  Because oral anticoagulants reduce the risk 
of both stroke and death, we included all cause mortal-
ity as a lone endpoint and as a combined endpoint with 
stroke.12
We recorded bleeding events as intracranial, major, 
gastrointestinal, and traumatic intracranial, reported in 
total as “any bleeding” and specific for intracranial and 
extracranial major bleeding. Extracranial major bleed-
ing was defined as bleeding with anaemia, haemotho-
rax, haematuria, epistaxis, and bleeding in the eye (see 
supplementary material for details).
Demographic data were obtained from the Danish 
civil registration system. Comorbidities and co-treat-
ments (listed in table 1) were ascertained from the Dan-
ish national patient registry and the Danish national 
prescription registry (see supplementary table 1 for defi-
nitions of codes). We combined covariate information 
into the CHA2DS2VASc score13  for assessing stroke risk, 
and a HAS-BLED score14 as a measure of bleeding risk 
(see supplementary table 2 for definitions of scores).
statistical analysis
To compare the risk of an endpoint between treatment 
groups we used time to event analysis, measuring risk 
time from initial prescription and until the relevant 
event, emigration, death, or end of follow-up, which-
ever came first. An intention to treat approach was 
applied for the analyses of all endpoints. The supple-
mentary material shows the results of a continuous 
treatment analysis, by censoring follow-up if the patient 
was prescribed another treatment than that initiated.
We calculated crude incidence as the number of 
events divided by person time. Cox regression was used 
to compare event rates between the treatment groups, 
with warfarin as the primary reference. To deal with 
confounding by indication of treatment, we applied an 
inverse probability of treatment weighted analysis. 
Such an approach is suitable in situations with several 
treatment alternatives.15 
16  We used generalised boosted 
models, based on 10 000 regression trees, to calculate 
weights for optimal balance between the treatment 
populations.17 The weights were derived to obtain esti-
mates representing population average treatment 
effects. The underlying propensity models included the 
treatment predictors of age (continuous); binary 
 
indicators for sex; ischaemic stroke or systemic embo-
lism or transient ischaemic attack; vascular disease; 
hypertension; diabetes; cancer; recent prescription of 
aspirin, β blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, or statins; and CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED 
scores.
The treatments should be contrasted on comparable 
populations, and any patient must have a positive

probability for any treatment, hence substantial over-
lap between the scores for each treatment should be 
present. This was assessed by graphical inspection of 
the weight distributions.16  We evaluated the balance 
between treatment populations by standardised differ-
ences of all baseline covariates, using a threshold of 0.1 
to indicate imbalance.18 Ordinary logistic regression 
was used to evaluate the association of baseline 
 
characteristics on treatment choice versus any of the 
alternatives.
We assessed the sensitivity of inclusion criteria and 
analytical method. The analyses were repeated by 
restricting to the cohort of patients with a hospital dis-
charge diagnosis of atrial fibrillation either before or 
within 30 days of the first prescription of a NOAC. Selec-
tion bias could be suspected at introduction of dabiga-
tran as this initial group may have had an excess of 
patients with special conditions making warfarin 
intractable. To avoid this potential bias we carried out 
an analysis where inclusion of patients using dabiga-
tran was postponed to February 2012. We compared the 
results of the inverse probability of treatment weighted 
analysis with an ordinary crude and adjusted analysis 
as well as a standardised morbidity ratio weighted anal-
ysis, weighting the warfarin stratum with the expected 
odds of receiving treatment with a NOAC. To account for 
baseline differences and potential confounding we 
used the same covariates as for the propensity models 
to adjust the standardised morbidity ratio and the ordi-
nary analyses. The results are provided in the supple-
mentary material.
The analyses on the entire population were supple-
mented by stratified analyses on the populations 
younger and older than 65, as well as stratified accord-
ing to previous experience of stroke, systemic embolism, 
or transient ischaemic attack. These two classifications 
represented primary and secondary prevention treat-
ment groups, respectively.
Stata/MP version 14 and R version 3.1.1 was used for 
the statistical analysis. We considered a two sided 
P value of less than 0.05 to be significant.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion, the outcome measures, or the study design; there 
are no plans to actively involve patients in dissemina-
tion of the results. Ethical approval for observational 
studies using Danish nationwide registries is not 
required in Denmark.
Results
We identified 122 068 patients as new users of oral anti-
coagulant treatment, including 35 035 patients  
receiving 
one of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants 
(novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs) with reduced doses, 
who were excluded. Overall, we excluded 25 355 patients 
with an indication for valvular atrial fibrillation or 
venous thromboembolism (see  
supplementary figure 1). 
The study population (n=61 678) was distributed accord-
ing to treatment type: warfarin (n=35 436, 57%), dabiga-
tran (n=12 701, 21%),  
rivaroxaban (n=7192, 12%), and 
apixaban (n=6349, 10%). Supplementary figure 2 shows

the progress of patients new to oral anticoagulants. The 
average follow-up was 1.9 years, with the shortest in the 
apixaban group (average 0.9 years), owing to its later 
introduction to the market.
Table 1 presents the baseline information of the ini-
tial study population before weighting. Patients who 
started dabigatran were slightly younger (<14% aged 
≥75) and had fewer risk factors for stroke, as sum-
marised by a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2.2, than other 
groups (older, with >33% aged ≥75 and a CHA2DS2-VASc 
score of 2.8). More patients in the apixaban (69%) and 
dabigatran (70%) groups had a diagnosis of atrial fibril-
lation before (or in connection with) the initiation of 
treatment, compared with patients in the rivaroxaban 
and warfarin groups (60% and 52%, respectively). 
Patients treated with apixaban had a higher prevalence 
of previous ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism, or 
transient ischaemic attack (21%), whereas previous vas-
cular disease was most prevalent among patients who 
started with warfarin. Patients treated with dabigatran 
had the lowest proportion of renal impairment (1.1%) in 
contrast with warfarin users (6.6%).
After the study populations had been weighted using 
the inverse probability of treatment weighted method, 
all baseline differences were less than 0.04 stan-
dardised differences at maximum. Inspection of indi-
vidual propensity score distributions showed sufficient 
overlap between treatment populations to obtain valid 
comparisons (data not shown).
baseline characteristics and treatment choices
Supplementary table 3 shows the odds ratios for treat-
ment compared with any of the alternatives. The likeli-
hood of apixaban use (contrasted to the three other 
alternatives) was increased (odds ratio >1.1) in the pres-
ence of previous ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism, 
or transient ischaemic attack; vascular disease; bleed-
ing; and hospital confirmed atrial fibrillation, but it was 
reduced (odds ratio <0.9) by renal impairment and aspi-
rin use. Choice of dabigatran was increased with a hos-
pital diagnosis of atrial fibrillation but reduced if the 
patient was female, and had vascular disease, renal 
impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), heart failure, or cancer. The probability for 
selecting rivaroxaban was increased by female sex, pre-
vious ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism, or transient 
ischaemic attack, or bleeding but reduced by vascular 
disease, renal impairment, heart failure, or use of 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Treatment with 
warfarin was more likely if the patient was female, had 
vascular disease, hypertension, renal impairment, 
COPD, heart failure, or cancer, or used aspirin but less 
likely in patients with a confirmed hospital diagnosis of 
atrial fibrillation.

showed no distinct differences between the four 
 
treatments after applying weights. Weighted rates for 
ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism ranged from 2.9 
to 3.9 per 100 person years among the NOACs and 3.3 
specifically for warfarin (table 2).
When restricting the analysis to ischaemic stroke 
only, no significant differences were evident for the 
NOACs compared with warfarin across strata (fig 2 , 
table 2 ). Rivaroxaban was associated with lower rates of 
ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism compared with 
warfarin: the hazard ratio at one year was 0.83 (95% 
confidence interval 0.69 to 0.99) and after 2.5 years was 
0.80 (0.69 to 0.94, see supplementary fig 4a). When we 
restricted the analysis to patients with hospital diag-
nosed atrial fibrillation only or stratified according to 
age or primary or secondary stroke protection, the asso-
ciations were similar, with hazard ratios between 0.79 
and 0.86; statistical significance was not reached (fig 2).
The differences in rates of ischaemic stroke or sys-
temic embolism were non-significant for apixaban and 
dabigatran compared with warfarin in the first year of 
treatment (fig 2).

The cumulative incidence curves for the combined end-
point of any bleeding (fig 1 ) displayed comparable 
bleeding rates for warfarin and rivaroxaban, which 
were higher than for both apixaban and dabigatran. 
The incidence curves for the last two treatments over-
lapped. The weighted one year incidence rates were 
around five events per 100 person years for warfarin 
and rivaroxaban and three per 100 person years for 
apixaban and dabigatran (table 2).
Weighted Cox regressions yielded significantly lower 
hazard ratios with reference to warfarin for apixaban 
(0.63, 0.53 to 0.76) and dabigatran (0.61, 0.51 to 0.74, 
fig 3 ). After 2.5 years’ follow-up these significant 
 
reductions remained (see supplementary figure 4b). 
The subgroup analyses (fig 3) showed consistency of 
these results, although the differences where less pro-
nounced and non-significant for the secondary stroke 
prevention group.
The effect sizes for major bleeding were comparable 
to those for the overall combined bleeding endpoint (fig 
3). The rate for dabigatran was significantly lower than 
for warfarin (0.50, 0.33 to 0.75) for the secondary stroke 
prevention group.
Intracranial bleeding was observed, with a one year 
weighted rate of 0.6 per 100 person years for warfarin; 
all NOACs had lower rates than warfarin. The main anal-
ysis showed lower rates for dabigatran (0.40, 0.25 to 
0.65) and for rivaroxaban (0.56, 0.34 to 0.90) at one year 
follow-up (fig 2). The corresponding hazard ratios after 
2.5 years’ follow-up were 0.39 (0.27 to 0.56) and 0.66 
(0.45 to 0.98, see supplementary figure 4b). The hazard 
ratios for apixaban ranged between 0.60 and 0.85 for all 
strata, with confidence intervals crossing unity.
Death
The cumulative incidence curves for warfarin and rivar-
oxaban overlapped and were higher than the overlap-
ping curves for apixaban and dabigatran (fig 2 ). Table 2 
 
shows the rates for death and the combined endpoint of 
ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism, or death. Death 
rates at one year follow-up were significantly lower for 
apixaban (0.65, 0.56 to 0.75) and for dabigatran (0.63, 
0.48 to 0.82) compared with warfarin (fig 2). These dif-
ferences remained consistent when stratified on sub-
groups.
The combined endpoint of ischaemic stroke, sys-
temic embolism, or death displayed lower relative risks 
for all NOACs compared with warfarin, with general 
consistency in the entire cohort and the cohort of 
patients admitted to hospital (fig 2). After 2.5 years’ fol-
low-up, these differences were maintained (see supple-
mentary figure 4a).

sensitivity analyses
The adjusted analyses, the standardised morbidity ratio 
weighted analysis, and the subgroup analyses on 
patients with confirmed atrial fibrillation agreed with 
the weighted analyses (see supplementary figures 5a 
and 5b). The results were not altered when the analyses 
were repeated under a continuous treatment approach 
(see supplementary figures 6a, 6b, 7a, and 7b). The 
exclusion of patients who started dabigatran during the 
first five months after its introduction in Denmark did 
not materially change the effect estimates and conclu-
sions (results not shown).
Discussion
In this large comparative effectiveness and safety analy-
sis of NOAC drugs and warfarin from routine care setting, 
we found that non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagu-
lants (novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs) are overall safe 
and effective alternatives to warfarin treatment. 
We observed differential prescribing of different 
non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (novel 
oral anticoagulants, NOACs) in relation to patient char-
acteristics was evident. For example, dabigatran was 
preferentially prescribed in younger patients with a 
lower risk of stroke and less renal impairment. For isch-
aemic stroke only, no significant differences were evi-
dent (hazard ratios) between NOACs and warfarin; 
however, for the combined endpoint of ischaemic 
stroke or systemic embolism, rivaroxaban was associ-
ated with a lower risk than warfarin, with dabigatran 
and apixaban showing no significant differences. Apix-
aban and dabigatran were associated with a signifi-
cantly lower risk of death compared with rivaroxaban or 
warfarin. The endpoints of any bleeding or major bleed-
ing were significantly lower for apixaban and dabiga-
tran than for rivaroxaban or warfarin; the last two drugs 
had similar profiles for bleeding risk.
Comparison with other studies
Some selective prescribing, as seen in this study, is 
perhaps unsurprising and consistent with other 
reports from small cohorts, often single centre stud-
ies.19  With the availability of various NOACs, there is 
an opportunity to fit the particular NOAC to the 
patient’s clinical profile.20-22  Thus, dabigatran users 
were slightly younger than users of the other NOACs,

but this may reflect our study focus on standard dose 
dabigatran (150 mg twice daily), which is not recom-
mended for elderly patients (>80 years). NOACs were 
generally less used in patients with vascular disease, 
whereas warfarin was more commonly prescribed. 
This could reflect previous concerns of a numerical 
increase in cardiac ischaemic events with dabigatran 
treatment compared with warfarin, and the cardiopro-
tective effect of warfarin.23  The lower use of dabiga-
tran in patients with renal impairment pertains to the 
caution with this NOAC, given its relative high renal 
excretion.24  The higher use of rivaroxaban and apix-
aban in patients with previous ischaemic stroke or sys-
temic embolism may possibly reflect the high 
proportion of such patients in their respective clinical 
trials.2 3 In addition, throughout the past three to five 
years, NOACs have gained increasing attention, as 
healthcare authorities and caregivers learn the bene-
fits and limitations of these new drugs. These include, 
for example, ease of being administered, continuous 
monitoring of renal function, and patient preferences. 
However, our analysis was not designed to take into 
account these facts and thus should be viewed in this 
perspective.
Our methodological approach accounted for such 
‘”real world” selective prescribing through propensity 
weights.
In our analysis, mortality risks were similar in 
patients treated with warfarin and rivaroxaban, and 
higher than with apixaban or dabigatran. Mortality is a 
relevant endpoint in stroke prevention studies, and 
even in the historical trials, warfarin significantly 
reduced all cause mortality (by 26%) compared with 
placebo or control.12  A meta-analysis of NOAC trials 
found a 10% reduction in all cause mortality with stan-
dard dose NOACs compared with warfarin.25  Our analy-
sis extends these observations, showing a differential 
effect of NOACs with a similar all cause mortality with 
rivaroxaban compared with warfarin, whereas dabiga-
tran and apixaban had similar mortality that were sig-
nificantly lower than warfarin. Indeed, mortality was 
not significantly different between rivaroxaban and 
warfarin in ROCKET-AF (the Rivaroxaban Once Daily 
Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin 
K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism 
Trial in Atrial Fibrillation), whereas the mortality reduc-
tion was significant for apixaban (11% reduction) and 
borderline significant for dabigatran 150 mg twice daily

(10% reduction, P=0.05), compared with warfarin in 
their respective phase 3 trials.2 
26 
27
We found comparable bleeding rates for warfarin and 
rivaroxaban that were noticeably higher than for both 
apixaban and dabigatran. Apixaban and dabigatran 
both yielded statistically significantly lower risks for 
any bleeding or major bleeding with reference to warfa-
rin, even after 2.5 years of follow-up. These associations 
remained present in most subgroups. Again, these data 
are consistent with the results of the NOAC phase 3 clin-
ical trial. In ROCKET-AF, for example, the rates of major 
and clinically relevant non-major bleeding were similar 
for rivaroxaban and warfarin. Nevertheless, the validity 
of the data from the ROCKET-AF trial has recently been 
questioned owing to use of an inaccurate point-of-care 
device (Hemosense INratio; HemoSense, San Jose, 
CA).28  A US Food and Drug Administration mandated 
post hoc analysis of the trial data examined bleeding 
outcomes in patients with chronic inflammation, acute 
inflammation, or hematocrit levels out of range.29 
 
 
Specifically for the outcome of major bleeding, treat-
ment with rivaroxaban was favoured compared with 
warfarin (hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 
0.70 to 1.08) in the subgroup of patients with none of 
the conditions; whereas the hazard ratio in patients 
with any of the conditions was 1.18 (0.98 to 1.42). As dis-
cussed elsewhere,28 these results are counterintuitive, 
as the patients with the mentioned conditions could 
have received a higher dose of warfarin due to the inac-
curate point-of-care devices resulting in an increased 
risk of bleeding. Notwithstanding the trial results, 
biased or not, rivaroxaban displayed similar bleeding 
risks to warfarin. Our comparisons on relative bleeding 
risks contrasting rivaroxaban with warfarin using data 
from clinical practice support this observation. For dab-
igatran, the endpoint “all bleeding” was significantly 
lower with both doses of dabigatran versus warfarin, 
whereas dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was associated 
with a non-significant reduction in major bleeding com-
pared with warfarin. For apixaban, all bleeding and 
major bleeding were significantly lower compared with 
warfarin in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in 
Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial 
Fibrillation) trial.3 In their respective trials, all NOACs 
were associated with significantly decreased intracra-
nial bleeding compared with warfarin, but our data did 
only yield significant results for dabigatran and rivarox-
aban. This, however, might reflect the smaller number 
of events and the shorter follow-up for (especially) 
patients treated with apixaban.
limitations of this study
The present study has several limitations, which mainly 
relate to the observational nature of the data. Some 
unmeasured and residual confounding is likely to per-
sist. For example, the differences in stroke and bleeding 
could potentially be related to selective prescribing. 
Although we applied propensity weighting to account 
for baseline differences, we are unlikely to have cap-
tured the full extent and effect of different prescribing 
behaviour. We did not have access to information on 
time in therapeutic range among warfarin users; nor 
did we have information on laboratory, anthropometric, 
or socioeconomic factors. However, our sensitivity anal-
yses did not change the conclusions from the main 
analyses, suggesting a limited potential for further 
adjustment for confounding within the setting of 
 
Danish administrative registry data. Our data also apply 
to a predominantly white European population, and 
differential efficacy and safety benefits are seen 
between people of Asian and non-Asian origin, which 
we were unable to investigate.30 31  Finally, there is the 
risk of misclassification, and various limitations of 
comparative effectiveness studies of newly marketed 
drugs have been noted previously32 that would also 
apply to the present study. Our analyses were not 
focused on direct comparisons of one NOAC agent 
against another; further research is warranted to estab-
lish comparative effectiveness and safety within the 
NOAC agent group. Moreover, in accordance with the 
described methods we chose to exclude patients treated 
with a non-standard (that is, reduced) dose of NOAC. It 
remains to be established whether each of the NOACs 
provide comparative effectiveness and safety compared 
with warfarin when prescribing a reduced dose of a spe-
cific NOAC drug.
Conclusions
All NOACs are generally safe and effective alternatives 
to warfarin in a clinical care setting. For ischaemic 
stroke, our weighted analysis suggests no significant 
differences between the NOACs and warfarin. The risks 
for death, any bleeding, or major bleeding were signifi-
cantly lower for apixaban and dabigatran, compared 
with warfarin.
