Cognitive changes occurring throughout the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases are directly linked to synaptic loss. We
used in-depth proteomics to compare 32 post-mortem human brains in the prefrontal cortex of prospectively followed patients
with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and older adults without dementia. In
total, we identified 10 325 proteins, 851 of which were synaptic proteins. Levels of 25 synaptic proteins were significantly altered in
the various dementia groups. Significant loss of SNAP47, GAP43, SYBU (syntabulin), LRFN2, SV2C, SYT2 (synaptotagmin 2),
GRIA3 and GRIA4 were further validated on a larger cohort comprised of 92 brain samples using ELISA or western blot.
Cognitive impairment before death and rate of cognitive decline significantly correlated with loss of SNAP47, SYBU, LRFN2,
SV2C and GRIA3 proteins. Besides differentiating Parkinson’s disease dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer’s
disease from controls with high sensitivity and specificity, synaptic proteins also reliably discriminated Parkinson’s disease dementia
from Alzheimer’s disease patients. Our results suggest that these particular synaptic proteins have an important predictive and
discriminative molecular fingerprint in neurodegenerative diseases and could be a potential target for early disease intervention.

 Introduction
The pandemic increase of dementia, hampering daily living
of many millions, carries serious implications for society
(Wimo et al., 2017). Alzheimer’s disease and the Lewy
body dementias, i.e. dementia with Lewy bodies and
Parkinson’s
disease
dementia,
are
the
most
common
forms of neurodegenerative dementias (Campbell et al.,
2001; McKeith et al., 2005).
Cognition gradually declines in Alzheimer’s disease, de-
mentia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia
leading to loss of function in everyday life, reduced quality
of life, and increased mortality (Aarsland et al., 2003;
McKeith et al., 2005; Maalouf et al., 2011). Synapse and
synaptic protein loss seems to be a universal element in the
pathologic changes associated with dementia (DeKosky and
Scheff, 1990) as it is directly linked to cognitive deficits
from early stages of dementia and it is believed that syn-
aptic changes precede neuronal degeneration (DeKosky and
Scheff, 1990). It has been shown that synaptic loss is a
better correlate of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s dis-
ease than the hallmark tau and amyloid-b pathologies
(Blennow et al., 1996; Masliah et al., 2001). Several studies
have shown that changes in synaptic function are asso-
ciated with alterations in the concentration of synaptic pro-
teins (Gottschall et al., 2010), a characteristic feature in
Alzheimer’s disease (Terry et al., 1991; Honer, 2003) and
increasing attention is now being devoted to their role in
synucleinopathies (Aarsland et al., 2005; Compta et al.,
2011; Howlett et al., 2015; Bereczki et al., 2016). In a
recent study, we reported changes in the concentration of
presynaptic proteins SNAP25 and Rab3A as well as a post-
synaptic protein, neurogranin, in post-mortem neocortical
regions in Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies
and Alzheimer’s disease patients. These changes correlated
with the rate of cognitive decline in dementia with Lewy
bodies and Alzheimer’s disease as well as with neuropatho-
logical markers (Bereczki et al., 2016). The development of
biomarkers aiding early differential diagnosis and predict-
ing disease progression from its earliest stage is of major
importance both for research and therapeutic development.
The complex structural and functional organization of the
brain regarding its morphology, connectivity and function
warrants the application of systematic approaches. Recent
advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics offer a
reliable molecular phenotype comparison between diseased
and control cases allowing in-depth coverage of quantita-
tive changes (Kim et al., 2014). These methods permit the
identification of alterations in the cellular proteome and
provide insight into disease aetiology and mechanisms. In
addition, they aid the discovery of biomarkers for monitor-
ing disease progression as well as assessment of drug effects
(Portelius et al., 2015; Moya-Alvarado et al., 2016).
Whereas some explorative proteomic studies have already
been performed in Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s dis-
ease (Abdi et al., 2006; Blennow and Zetterberg, 2013;
Brinkmalm et al., 2014; Halbgebauer et al., 2016), only
few studies have been conducted in dementia with Lewy
bodies
(Abdi
et
al.,
2006;
Barthelemy
et
al.,
2016;
Biemans et al., 2016).
Our study is among the first in-depth quantitative prote-
ome studies on prefrontal post-mortem tissues where,
beside the whole proteome comparison, we also aimed to
profile
the entire
synaptic
proteome of
patients with
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease dementia and de-
mentia with Lewy bodies and compared them to non-de-
mented control cases. Our in-depth analysis of the synaptic
proteome identified key synaptic proteins underlying synap-
tic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease
dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies suggesting shared
mechanisms, with major implications for prognostic and
diagnostic
marker
development
as
well
as
advancing
future therapeutic interventions for improving the disease
course.
Materials and methods
Brain tissue
Post-mortem human brain tissues from prefrontal cortex,
Brodmann area 9 (from 92 cases in total) were provided by
the Brains for Dementia Research network. The prefrontal
cortex was selected due to its role in cognition and executive
functions involved across the three diseases (Fuster, 2001). The
cohort
included
cases
from
the
Newcastle
Brain
Tissue
Resource (three cases), the Thomas Willis Oxford Brain
Collections
(seven
cases),
the
London
Neurodegenerative
Diseases Brain Bank (56 cases) and the University Hospital
Stavanger (26 cases). Autopsy protocols and sample collection
was harmonized between centres. Detailed description of the
diagnostic criteria has been previously published (Howlett
et al., 2015). Final diagnoses for patients are clinic-pathological
consensus diagnoses. In total, 24 Parkinson’s disease dementia
patients (age 72–89 years), 26 dementia with Lewy bodies pa-
tients (age 65–91 years), 18 patients with Alzheimer’s disease
(age 72–103 years) and 24 elderly non-neurological controls
(age 65–96 years) were included. Controls did not have signifi-
cant neurological or psychiatric diseases and presented only
mild age-associated neuropathological changes (e.g. neurofibril-
lary tangle Braak stage II). Semi-quantitative assessments of
senile amyloid-b plaques, phosphor-tau and a-synuclein path-
ology were conducted by experienced neuropathologists blind
to clinical diagnosis, using a four-tiered scale of 0 (none), 1
(sparse), 2 (moderate) and 3 (severe/frequent) to score sections
from each brain area, as described previously (Howlett et al.,
2015). Hoehn and Yahr scale was available for 23 of 24
Parkinson’s disease with dementia patients, and assessment
from the last OFF phase was used. Alzheimer’s disease patients
with low a-synuclein pathology were chosen to ensure distinc-
tion between Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy
bodies patients. Lewy body dementia cases selected were of
pathologically ‘diffuse neocortical’ stage, with a cortical Lewy
body score of 13.2 (�3.6), incorporating the 1-year rule to
differentiate
between
dementia
with
Lewy
bodies
and
Parkinson’s disease with dementia (McKeith et al., 2005).

 Neuropathological assessment was performed according to
standardized neuropathological scoring/grading systems; assess-
ment and diagnostic criteria have been previously described
(Howlett et al., 2015). Cognitive data were available for most
patients
and
consisted
of
the
last
Mini-Mental
State
Examination (MMSE) scores, assessed in most cases within
1–2 years before death (Folstein et al., 1975) and MMSE de-
cline calculated as average decline over a period of clinical ob-
servation of 8–10 years. All participants gave informed consent
for their tissue to be used in research and the study was
approved by the UK National Research Ethics Service (08/
H1010/4), the Norwegian committee for medical and health
research ethics (2010/633) and the Regional Ethical Review
Board of Stockholm (2012/920-31/4).
Sample preparation for HiRIEF
LC-MS proteomics
The tissues were lysed in SDS-lysis buffer [4% (w/v) SDS,
25mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT]. Lysates were then
heated at 95�C for 5 min in a thermomixer, and were sonicated
with a sonicator probe to shear DNA. Samples were centrifuged
at 14 000g to remove cell debris, the supernatant was collected
and protein concentration estimated by the DC-protein assay
(BioRad). From each sample, 250 mg of total protein were
taken and processed according to the FASP (Filter Aided
Sample Preparation) protocol (Wisniewski et al., 2009) with
one modification, i.e. the samples were digested on the filter
with Lys-C for 3 h prior to trypsin digestion (16 h). Peptide
concentration was estimated by the DC-protein assay (Bio-
Rad), and 100mg of peptides from each sample were labelled
with the respective TMT10plexTM reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
HiRIEF separation
Peptide pre-fractionation was done using HiRIEF (high reso-
lution isoelectric focusing) (Branca et al., 2014). Briefly, after
pooling the samples that belong together in each TMTTM
(Tandem Mass TagTM) set, each TMT set was cleaned by
strong
cation
exchange
solid
phase
extraction
(SCX-SPE,
Phenomenex Strata-X-C, P/N 8B-S029-TAK). After drying in a
SpeedVacTM (Thermo SPD111V with refrigerated vapor trap
RVT400), the equivalent to 400 mg of peptides of each sample
were dissolved in 250 ml of 8 M urea, 1% pharmalyte (broad
range pH 3–10, GE Healthcare, P/N 17-0456-01), and this so-
lution was used to rehydrate the IPG drystrip (pH 3–10, 24 cm,
GE Healthcare, P/N 17-6002-44) overnight. Focusing was done
on an Ettan IPGphor 3 system (GE Healthcare), ramping up the
voltage to 500 V in 1h, then to 2000 V in two more hours, and
finally to 8000V in six more hours, after which voltage was
held at 8000 V for additional 20h or until 150 kVh were
reached. After focusing was complete, a well-former with 72
wells was applied onto each strip, and liquid-handling robotics
(GE Healthcare prototype modified from a Gilson liquid handler
215), using three rounds of different solvents: (i) milliQ water;
(ii) 35% acetonitrile; and (iii) 35% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic
acid, added 50ml of solvent to each well, waited 30min incubat-
ing, and finally transferred the 72 fractions into a microtitre
plate
(96
wells,
polypropylene,
V-bottom,
Greiner
P/N
651201), which was then dried in a SpeedVac.
LC-MS analysis
For each liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
run of a HiRIEF fraction, the autosampler (Ultimate 3000
RSLC nanoUPLC system, Thermo Scientific Dionex) dispensed
15 ml of mobile phase A [95% water, 5% dimethylsulphoxide
(DMSO), 0.1% formic acid] into the corresponding well of the
microtitre plate, mixed by aspirating/dispensing 10 ml 10 times,
and finally injected 7 ml into a C18 guard desalting column
(Acclaim pepmap 100, 75 mm � 2 cm, nanoViper, Thermo).
After 5 min of flow at 5 ml/min with the loading pump, the
10-port valve switched to analysis mode in which the NC
pump provided a flow of 250 nl/min through the guard
column. The curved gradient (curve 6 in the Chromeleon soft-
ware) then proceeded from 3% mobile phase B (90% aceto-
nitrile, 5% DMSO, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid) to 45% B in
50 min followed by wash at 99% B and re-equilibration. Total
LC-MS run time was 74 min. We used a nano EASY-SprayTM
column (pepmap RSLC, C18, 2 mm bead size, 100 A
˚ , 75 mm
internal diameter, 50 cm long, Thermo) on the nano-electro-
spray ionization (NSI) EASY-Spray source (Thermo) at 60�C.
Online LC-MS was performed using a hybrid Q-Exactive mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). FTMS master scans with
70 000 resolution (and mass range 300–1600 m/z) were fol-
lowed by data-dependent MS/MS (35 000 resolution) on the
top five ions using higher energy collision dissociation (HCD)
at 30% normalized collision energy. Precursors were isolated
with a 2 m/z window. Automatic gain control (AGC) targets
were 1 � 106 for MS1 and 1 � 105 for MS2. Maximum injec-
tion times were 100 ms for MS1 and 150 ms for MS2. The
entire duty cycle lasted �1.5 s. Dynamic exclusion was used
with 60 s duration. Precursors with unassigned charge state or
charge state 1 were excluded. An underfill ratio of 1% was
used.
Proteomics database search
All MS/MS spectra were searched by MSGF + /Percolator using
a target-decoy strategy. Raw MS/MS files were converted to
mzML format using msconvert from the ProteoWizard tool
suite (Kessner et al., 2008). Spectra were then searched using
MSGF + (Kim and Pevzner, 2014) (v10072) and Percolator
(Kall et al., 2007) (v2.08), where eight subsequent search re-
sults were grouped for Percolator target/decoy analysis. The
reference database that was used was the human subset of
the Swiss-Prot database (version 2015_08, with 42 122 canon-
ical and isoform protein entries, downloaded from unipro-
t.org). MSGF + settings included precursor mass tolerance of
10 ppm, fully-tryptic peptides, maximum peptide length of 50
amino acids and a maximum charge of 6. Fixed modifications
were TMT10plex on lysine residues and N -termini, and car-
bamidomethylation on cysteine residues; a variable modifica-
tion was used for oxidation on methionine residues. Peptide
and
peptide-spectrum
match
(PSM)
false
discovery
rates
(FDRs) were recalculated after merging the percolator groups
of
eight
search
results
into
one
result
per
TMT
set.
Quantification of TMT10plex reporter ions was done using
OpenMS project’s IsobaricAnalyzer (Rost et al., 2016) (v2.0).
PSMs found at 1% PSM- and peptide-level FDR were used to
infer gene identities, whose respective protein products were
quantified using the medians of PSM quantification ratios,
which were subsequently normalized to the median protein

 value of each TMT channel ratio. Only one unique peptide
was required to identify a protein, but a protein level FDR cut-
off of 1% (calculated using the picked-FDR method) (Savitski
et al., 2015) was applied to the list of gene-centred proteins.
Thus, all PSMs, peptides and proteins included in the final
results were filtered through both a 1% peptide level FDR
and a 1% protein level FDR. The mass spectrometry prote-
omics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange
Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset
identifier PXD006122.
Gene ontology and pathway
enrichment analyses
Gene ontology (GO) terms were retrieved from uniprot.org for
all proteins identified. Proteins with GO terms (in all ontolo-
gies: biological processes, molecular function, cellular compo-
nent)
containing
the
word
‘synapse’
or
‘synaptic’
were
considered synaptic proteins and used for further enrichment
analysis. T-tests comparing the sample groups using log2-
transformed ratios were used to determine whether proteins
were differentially accumulated (requirements: P 5 0.05 and
fold change 50.83 or 41.20, which is based on the 95%
confidence interval of the variance between the two replicate
internal pooled standard TMT channels). The proteins deemed
significant were then assigned to Kyoto Encyclopaedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis
using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources version 6.8 (Huang
da et al., 2009). An EASE score (a modified Fisher’s exact
test) 50.1 and P-value 50.05 were the criteria for signifi-
cantly enriched biological pathways. The GOrilla (gene ontol-
ogy enrichment analysis and visualization) tool (Eden et al.,
2009) was used for detailed data analyses with two unranked
lists of genes, a target list and a background list (composed by
all genes identified at protein level in the MS experiment), with
a GO database from 2017-01-21. Results were categorized
into the functional groups of cellular component, biological
process or molecular function. FDR q-values of 50.5, repre-
senting the correction of P-values for multiple testing, were
considered significant.
Preparation of tissue samples for
western blotting and ELISA
Preparation of tissue for western blotting and ELISA analyses
was performed as previously described (Kirvell et al., 2006).
Briefly, 500 mg of frozen tissue was homogenized in ice-cold
buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM
EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche, one tablet
per 50 ml of buffer), and 2 mg/ml pepstatin A dissolved in
ethanol:DMSO 2:1 (Sigma). The buffer was used at a ratio
of 2 ml to every 100 mg of tissue, and homogenization was
performed
using
an
IKA
Ultra-Turrax
mechanical
probe
(IKA Werke) until the liquid appeared homogenous. Protein
concentration of each sample was measured by using BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples
for ELISA measurements were further diluted to 0.5 mg/ml total
protein in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). Parts of Figs 1 and
4 were crafted using the Mind the Graph platform.
Sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays
Commercial sandwich ELISA kits for each of the selected syn-
aptic proteins were purchased from Mybiosource. Assay pro-
cedures
were
followed
according
to
the
manufacturer’s
protocol. Standard samples for SV2C (synaptic vesicle 2C)
and SNAP47 (synaptosomal associated protein 47, 50 ml) and
100 ml for glutamate receptor (GRIA)3, GRIA4 and GAP43
(neuromodulin) were incubated with the corresponding HRP-
conjugate reagent for 1 h at 37�C, followed by thorough wash-
ing steps. Chromogen solution was then applied and after
stopping the reaction, absorbance measured immediately at
450 nm
on
a
SpektraMax�
Plus
384
microplate
reader
(Molecular Devices). The sigmoidal standard was evaluated
with non-linear four-parameter fit using SoftMax� Pro 5.2
software and sample amounts were obtained using the fitted
standard curve. Standards and samples were measured in du-
plicates. Samples of human brain were added in dilutions of
0.5 mg/ml of total protein and standards were diluted so that
the sample absorbance values would fall near 50% binding
(the linear range) of the standard curve. Concentrations were
calculated after the mean blank value had been subtracted.
Immunoblotting
To minimize inter-blot variability, 20mg of total protein per
sample was loaded in each lane on 7.5–10% SDS-polyacryl-
amide gels (Criterion) for protein separation and then trans-
ferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore).
Each gel contained a control lane of pooled brain homogenates
used as an internal standard. After blocking non-specific bind-
ing,
membranes
were
incubated
with
primary
antibodies
(Supplementary Table 1) followed by HRP conjugated second-
ary antibody. GAPDH was used as a reference protein assessing
equal loading. Bands were visualized using Chemiluminescent
substrate (Millipore) in a LAS-3000 luminescent image reader
(Fujifilm). Western blot data were evaluated and quantified
using Multi Gauge Image Analyzer (version 3.0).
Statistical analysis
To compare synaptic protein levels between groups, Student’s
t-tests were applied on log2-transformed data using SAM
(Significance Analysis of Microarrays) under R (version 3.2.2,
The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). SAM performs
t-tests using permutation-based corrections for multiple com-
parisons. Although originally designed for array data, SAM
has been shown to be valid also for LC-MS/MS data (Roxas
and Li, 2008; Sandberg et al., 2012). Additional univariate ana-
lyses were carried out using non-parametric statistical tests due
to the irregular non-Gaussian distribution of the samples in
SPSS (IBM Statistics 22). To assess the relationship between
synaptic proteins, and neuropathological and MMSE scores,
Spearman correlations were performed. To compare protein
levels between controls and the different patient groups we
used Kruskal-Wallis tests, followed by Dunn’s post hoc test.
In all cases, differences were considered statistically significant
at
P 4 0.05.
Chi-squared
tests
(with

Correction) were used to explore differences in gender across
diagnostic groups. A linear regression for the correlation studies

 was applied to synaptic proteins to regress out the effects of age.
Prior to linear regression, logarithmic normalization was applied
to synaptic proteins to achieve normality.
Multivariate data analyses were performed to discriminate
controls from the different patient groups using orthogonal par-
tial least square analyses (OPLS in the program SIMCA, version
13.0; Umetrics AB, Sweden). Detailed description of the multi-
variate statistical analysis can be found in the Supplementary
material. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive pre-
dictive values and negative predictive values of the group sep-
arations from the Q2(Y) values obtained in each model.
Results
Demographic characteristics of the
samples
Key cohort characteristics are shown in Table 1. In the mass
spectrometry studies, we included 32 (eight non-demented,
eight
Parkinson’s
disease
dementia,
seven
dementia
with
Lewy
bodies,
nine
Alzheimer’s
disease)
patients,
while in the validation studies 92 (24 non-demented, 24
Parkinson’s
disease
dementia,
26
dementia
with
Lewy
bodies, 18 Alzheimer’s disease) patients were included.
There were no significant differences in the pH (�2 = 6.147,
df = 3, P = 0.105) or in the post-mortem delay between the
groups (�2 = 5.037, df = 3, P = 0.169). In the larger cohort,
Alzheimer’s disease patients were significantly older than all
the other three groups (P = 0.001 versus controls; P = 0.019
versus Parkinson’s disease dementia; P = 0.005 versus de-
mentia with Lewy bodies) while patients with Parkinson’s
disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies did not
differ significantly in age. Dementia with Lewy body and
Alzheimer’s disease had longer dementia duration than
Parkinson’s disease dementia (P = 0.006 Parkinson’s disease
dementia versus dementia with Lewy bodies; P 4 0.001
Parkinson’s disease dementia versus Alzheimer’s disease;
P = 0.002 versus Alzheimer’s disease). Correlations between

analysis. (B) Schematic representation of the number of differentially regulated proteins across disease groups. Differentially regulated proteins in

synaptic proteins GRIA3, SNAP47, LRFN2, SYBU, SYT2, GAP43, GRIA4 and SV2C were chosen for further validation with ELISA or western blot
analyses in a larger cohort (E) (two synaptic proteins neurogranin, and CAMK2 were previously found to be altered by us within the same
cohort). AD = Alzheimer’s disease; C = non-demented controls; DLB = dementia with Lewy bodies; LC-MS = liquid chromatography-mass

 age and MMSE decline scores were observed in Parkinson’s
disease dementia (rho = 0.553, P = 0.008, n = 22). The last
MMSE scores before death were lower and the rate of
MMSE decline was higher in Alzheimer’s disease compared
to Parkinson’s disease dementia or dementia with Lewy
bodies. No significant association was observed between
diagnosis and gender.
Proteome analyses
To avoid large interindividual variation, a confounding
factor in previous comparative proteomic studies on clin-
ical material, we included a large number of cases per
disease type (n = 7–9). The 32 prefrontal cortex samples
were processed by Filter Aided Sample Prep (FASP)
(Wisniewski et al., 2009) and cases were individually
labelled at peptide level with four sets of isobaric tags
(TMT10plex). Each TMT set contained eight channels
with randomized samples (Supplementary Table 2) and
two channels with the internal reference sample (made
by pooling aliquots from all 32 samples). Each TMT set
was fractionated into 72 fractions by HiRIEF (Branca
et al., 2014) with the broad range IPG 3-10 strip prior
to LC-MS analysis (Fig. 1A).
A total of 10 325 proteins (gene-centric) were identified
(1% FDR, protein level FDR) (of which 7033 were
common to all 32 samples) as a result of the proteomic
database search (Fig. 1A). The DAVID (The Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) plat-
form as well as the GOrilla tool were used for detailed
data analyses. Across the disease groups, 102 proteins
were commonly differentially regulated (Fig. 1B). In the
dementia with Lewy bodies group, 1010 differentially
expressed proteins (of which 448 were upregulated and
562 were downregulated in dementia with Lewy bodies
compared to non-demented controls) were introduced in
the DAVID platform. Of these, 392 were assigned to 22
predicted KEGG pathways, with the identified differentially
accumulated proteins found to be enriched in pathways
related to human diseases (40%), organismal systems
(30.3%), cellular processes (10.6%), genetic information
processing (9.2%), metabolism (8.3%) and environmental
information processing (1.9%) (Fig. 1C and Supplementary
Table 3). Interestingly, pathways such as Parkinson’s dis-
ease (n = 22), Alzheimer’s disease (n = 24) and Huntington’s
disease (n = 27), dopaminergic synapses (n = 17), protein
processing in endoplasmic reticulum (n = 27) and oxidative
phosphorylation (n = 23) were significantly enriched with
the
highest
number
of
alterations
(Fig.
1C
and
Supplementary Table 3). In Parkinson’s disease dementia,
485 proteins (286 upregulated and 199 downregulated
compared to non-demented controls) were introduced in
the DAVID platform, of which 182 were assigned to
eight KEGG pathways. In Alzheimer’s disease, of the 593
(255 upregulated and 338 downregulated compared to
non-demented controls) proteins introduced, 241 were as-
signed to 12 KEGG pathways. Since there were generally
fewer than 10 hits for the pathways, neither Parkinson’s
disease dementia nor Alzheimer’s disease KEGG pathway
enrichment was further scrutinized (data not shown). For
the GO analyses, in the case of dementia with Lewy bodies,
1003 proteins with GO terms were assigned to the anno-
tated 1010 proteins using the GOrilla tool and classified
into three groups (biological process, molecular function
and cellular component) (Fig. 1D). Within the three main
categories, only significant classifications were found in the

 cellular compartment (FDR, q 5 0.05), and these were
related to organelles and mitochondria (Fig. 1D and
Supplementary Table 4). In Alzheimer’s disease, the only
significant hits were found for the molecular function cat-
egory related to translation initiation and RNA binding,
while in Parkinson’s disease dementia no significant classi-
fication was found (Supplementary Table 4).
Synaptic dysfunction in Parkinson’s
disease dementia, dementia with
Lewy bodies and Alzheimer’s disease
Using GO terminology, we identified 851 proteins related
to synaptic transmission (Supplementary Table 5), of which
25 synaptic proteins were significantly altered in the vari-
ous dementias as shown by the SAM analyses with low
FDR (q 5 3.5%) (Table 2). As the levels of CAMK2 and
neurogranin have already been assessed in this cohort
(Vallortigara et al., 2014; Bereczki et al., 2016), we selected
eight additional differentially regulated synaptic proteins
based on their function, fold change, and antibody avail-
ability, for further validation on a larger cohort (containing
the mass spectrometry cohort) using ELISA or western blot
analyses. The synaptic protein with the most conspicuous
drop in concentration (29–33%) was LRFN2 (leucine-rich
repeat and fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein
2) in all three dementias (Table 3 and Fig. 2A). In
Parkinson’s disease dementia, SNAP47 and SYT2 concen-
trations (Supplementary Fig. 1) also decreased compared to
controls while GAP43 concentration decreased in compari-
son to the Alzheimer’s disease group. Five of eight mea-
sured synaptic proteins were decreased in dementia with
Lewy bodies compared to non-demented controls. In add-
ition to concentrations of LRFN2, SNAP47 and SV2C,
levels of SYBU and SYT2 were also decreased (Table 3,
Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 1). In Alzheimer’s disease,
apart from LRFN2, only GRIA3 concentration was signifi-
cantly decreased (Table 3 and Fig. 2A). Proteomic profiling
revealed no significant differences in a-synuclein levels
(Supplementary Table 5).

 Panel of synaptic proteins
discriminate between control and
dementia diagnoses
Multivariate analyses showed that synaptic protein levels
were able to provide a clear separation between controls
and the different patient groups; however, no synaptic
protein alone was able to achieve clear discrimination
between groups. In addition, a clear discrimination be-
tween patients with Parkinson’s disease dementia and
Alzheimer’s disease was also observed (77.8% sensitiv-
ity with 80% specificity, Table 4). All models were
statistically

and
showed

multiple comparison test. Multivariate analyses show the contribution of synaptic proteins to discriminate controls from the different patient
groups. Plots showing the variables of importance and their corresponding jack-knifed confidence intervals for the separation between controls

likely to have an impact on group separation than a variable with low covariance. Measures with confidence intervals that include zero have low
reliability.

 with

dementia
versus
controls
(Table 4).
The model comparing control with Parkinson’s disease
dementia cases showed a modest predictive power of
Q2(Y) = 0.173 in discriminating controls from patients
with Parkinson’s disease dementia. With the exception of
GRIA4 and SYBU, all variables contributed to the separ-
ation between these groups (Fig. 2B). The dementia with
Lewy bodies model showed a good predictive power of
Q2(Y) = 0.471 in discriminating controls from patients
with dementia with Lewy bodies. All synaptic proteins sig-
nificantly contributed to the separation between groups,
with the exception of GRIA4 and GAP43 (Fig. 2C). The
Alzheimer’s disease model showed a good predictive power
of Q2(Y) = 0.427 in the discrimination of controls from
Alzheimer’s disease patients. The synaptic proteins that sig-
nificantly contributed to the separation were LRFN2,
GRIA3, SV2C and SYT2 (Fig. 2D). A good predictive
power of Q2(Y) = 0.438 reflected the capacity to distin-
guish Parkinson’s disease dementia and Alzheimer’s disease
pathology based on the contribution of both GAP43 and
SNAP47 (Fig. 2E). These results were still significant after
correcting for the effects of age. Patients with Parkinson’s
disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies could not
be reliably discriminated from one another, supporting that
they are part of the same disease spectrum. No significant
differences were found between dementia with Lewy bodies
and Alzheimer’s disease, most likely attributed to the
common amyloid-related pathology.
Associations between synaptic
proteins and neuropathological
scores
Correlations between the eight synaptic proteins validated
on the larger cohort and Alzheimer’s disease and dementia
with Lewy bodies regional pathologies were analysed
(Supplementary Table 6). In Parkinson’s disease dementia
there were significant correlations between a-synuclein and
SNAP47 (rho = �0.539, P = 0.008) and GRIA3 (rho =
�0.449,
P = 0.047)
whereas
in
dementia
with
Lewy
bodies, a-synuclein correlated with SV2C (rho = �0.441,
P = 0.035).
Amyloid-b
scores
correlated
significantly
with
GRIA4
both
in
Parkinson’s
disease
dementia
(rho = �0.471, P = 0.031) and in dementia with Lewy
bodies (rho = �0.444, P = 0.05). The only significant asso-
ciation we found between synaptic proteins and tangle
scores was in the case of GRIA3 in Parkinson’s disease
dementia (rho = �0.460, P = 0.041). No neuropathological
associations were found in Alzheimer’s disease.
Correlations between synaptic
proteins and cognitive impairment
We explored whether synaptic protein changes were asso-
ciated with cognitive impairment. Due to the exploratory
nature of these analyses and small number of patients per
group, these correlations are presented without adjusting
for multiple comparisons. Our calculations revealed that
only results at P 5 0.0087 would be considered statistically
significant with FDR corrections, which is quite a stringent
threshold. Significant associations between synaptic pro-
teins and cognitive decline were found in Parkinson’s dis-
ease
dementia,
dementia
with
Lewy
bodies
and
in
Alzheimer’s disease (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 7).
Synaptic vesicle protein SV2C was strongly associated
with the rate of cognitive decline, i.e. reduced levels corre-
lated with faster cognitive decline in Parkinson’s disease
dementia (rho = �0.486, P = 0.022) and dementia with
Lewy bodies (rho = �0.889, P = 0.0001) and low last
MMSE score in dementia with Lewy bodies (rho = 0.759,
P = 0.0001) (Fig. 3A and B). Decrease in SNAP47 concen-
tration was associated with worsening cognition reflected
both by last MMSE scores (rho = 0.480, P = 0.027) and the
rate
of
MMSE
decline
(rho = �0.559,
P = 0.008)
in
Parkinson’s disease dementia. GRIA3 also presented asso-
ciations
both
with
cognitive
decline
(rho = �0.726,
P = 0.0001)
and
last
MMSE
scores
(rho = 0.479,
P = 0.033) in dementia with Lewy bodies. Furthermore, in
dementia with Lewy bodies lowered SYBU levels correlated
with lower MMSE scores (rho = 0.493, P = 0.023). In
Alzheimer’s disease only LRFN2 presented strong associ-
ations with worsening cognition (rho = �0.613, P = 0.012)
and
the
last
MMSE
scores
(rho = 0.730,
P = 0.001)
(Fig. 3C). No significant associations were found between
MMSE scores and GRIA4, SYT2 or GAP43 proteins, how-
ever GAP43 was found to be associated to the total years
of dementia in Alzheimer’s disease (rho = 0.499, P = 0.035).
No associations were found between motor symptoms and
synaptic proteins in patients with Parkinson’s disease with

Discussion
Both Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body diseases are char-
acterized by substantial synaptic loss, which to date serves
as the best correlate with cognitive impairment (Terry
et al., 1991; Scheff et al., 2007; Pienaar et al., 2012).
More than 1000 proteins participate in the finely tuned
process of synaptic transmission, a process that comprises
interactions between synaptic vesicle membrane proteins as
well as presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane proteins
(Sudhof and Rothman, 2009). While general synaptic loss
is a common feature of dementia, specific pre- and postsyn-
aptic proteins such as Rab3A, SNAP25, synaptophysin
crucial for vesicle trafficking, exo- and endocytosis have
been found specifically altered in neurodegenerative dis-
eases (Whitfield et al., 2014; Bereczki et al., 2016) along
with NMDA and AMPA receptors, PSD95 and neurogra-
nin (Lipton and Rosenberg, 1994; Lee et al., 2008;
Whitfield et al., 2014; Bereczki et al., 2016) playing a
role in long-term potentiation (Fig. 4). Of note, in our cur-
rent proteomics study we have not identified significant
changes neither for SNAP25 nor for Rab3a, which could
be due to the relative vulnerability of Rab3a to post-
mortem delay time (Ferrer et al., 2007). The potential
use of key synaptic proteins as biomarkers has recently
come in the spotlight of discussions in various dementias
(Bereczki et al., 2016; Wellington et al., 2016). Note that
the regional specific post-mortem synaptic protein profile
might differ from the synaptic protein profile of CSF
(Bereczki et al., 2016, 2017; Remnestal et al., 2016).
Figure 3 Correlations between synaptic proteins and cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease dementia (A), dementia
with Lewy bodies (B) and Alzheimer’s disease (C). Decreased SNAP47, SV2C and GRIA3 concentrations (A) correlated with cognitive
impairment in Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD). SV2C and GRIA3 concentrations are negatively correlated with the rate of MMSE decline in
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, B) showing, along with SYBU levels, positive correlations with the last MMSE scores (B). Negative correlations
between LRFN2 concentrations and the rate of MMSE decline as well as positive correlations with the last MMSE scores were observed in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD, C). Associations were analysed using Spearman correlations.

 Although CSF biomarkers are most informative in portray-
ing the biochemical picture of the brain, blood-based bio-
markers
are
more
desired
for
large-scale
screening
(Mattsson et al., 2015). Of note, even if a biomarker has
shown high specificity and sensitivity, its utility as a ther-
agnostic biomarker is not guaranteed (Mattsson et al.,
2015).
The technological advance in proteomics analyses has
provided high-throughput screening methods in the quest
for biomarkers of neurodegenerative disorders in post-
mortem as well as in CSF or blood-based samples. To
our knowledge, we are the first to provide a systematic
proteome

ease, i.e. 32 samples in total) from the prefrontal cortex
(Brodmann area 9), revealing a pattern of synaptic protein
loss across different neurodegenerative diseases.
We have adopted a proteomics-driven discovery approach
and after identifying roughly half of the human proteome, we
validated lead synaptic candidates in a larger post-mortem
brain cohort of 92 cases. Comparative proteomics highlighted
significant loss of several synaptic proteins across dementias
including presynaptic proteins (GRIK2, CAMK2A, BDNF,
PDYN), synaptic vesicle priming proteins (SNAP47) synaptic
vesicle proteins (SV2C, SYT2), proteins found in both pre-
and postsynaptic terminus (GAP43, LRFN2) and postsynaptic
proteins (GRIA3, GRIA4, ARC, CNIH2, PVRL3, NRGN).
Among these proteins, SNAP47, SV2C, GRIA3, SYBU and
LRFN2 in the prefrontal cortex correlated with cognitive de-
cline in demented cases. The levels of apocalmodulin-binding
proteins, NRGN and GAP43 diminished, which in turn might
further contribute to the altered CAMK2 and AMPA receptor
(GRIA3, GRIA4) mediated synaptic transmission. Their re-
duction reflects a selective alteration in a subset of synaptic
proteins, suggesting that a decline in synaptic function rather
than synaptic loss plays a more relevant role in contributing
to dementia progression.
However, the mechanisms leading to synapse destabiliza-
tion and neuronal death remain elusive. There is evidence
showing that synaptic plasticity underlying learning and
memory often involves activity-dependent recruitment of
synaptic AMPA receptors (GRIA) (Nicoll and Malenka,
1999;
Kandel,
2001).
During
long-term
potentiation,
GRIA exocytosis is mediated by Q-SNARE proteins syn-
taxin-3 and SNAP47 (Jurado et al., 2013). Dysregulation
of AMPA receptors has also been implicated in numerous
neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders (Lipton and
Rosenberg, 1994). Likewise, deletion of LRFN2 localized
both to the presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane has
been linked to selective working memory and executive
deficits, impaired intellectual functioning and auditory-
verbal problems (Thevenon et al., 2016). Additional pro-
teins with a potential role in cognitive impairment such as
the members of the SNARE family, synaptotagmins (SYT),
PSD95 and synaptic vesicle 2 (SV2) proteins have also been
incriminated in this captivatingly complicated process of
synaptic plasticity (Bajjalieh et al., 1994; Xu et al., 2007;
Dun et al., 2010; Whitfield et al., 2014) (Fig. 4).
In line with this, SYT2 levels have also been shown to be
decreased in plasma neuronal-derived exosomes (Goetzl
et al., 2016). Likewise, CSF levels of GAP43 were found
to be altered in separate studies in Parkinson’s disease
(Sjogren et al., 2000) and in Alzheimer’s disease (Sjogren
et al., 2001; Goetzl et al., 2016). Our observation of
GRIA3 and its correlation with cognitive impairment sup-
ports previous observations of reductions of AMPA recep-
tors trafficking, or anchoring into dendritic spines with
synaptic
and
cognitive
disturbances
(Henley
and
Wilkinson, 2013). Interestingly, significant cognitive associ-
ations with GRIA3 were present only in dementia with
Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia with no ap-
parent
association
found
in
Alzheimer’s
disease.
The
marked reductions of synaptic proteins in patients with de-
mentia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia
could reflect a greater frontal degeneration in Lewy body
dementia in comparison with Alzheimer’s disease, which
usually affects the prefrontal cortex less than other medial
and lateral temporal areas (Burton et al., 2012). Together
with previous findings showing alterations in levels of stra-
tegic synaptic proteins such as Rab3A, PSD95 and SNARE
proteins,
and
their
correlation
to
cognitive
domains
Figure 4 Schematic overview of synaptic proteins with
altered levels in dementia. The diagram depicts the proteins
involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle focusing on the docking and
priming proteins (VAMP2, Syntaxin-1, SNAP, Munc18a), along with
proteins involved in the recycling of synaptic vesicles (Rab3A, SV2C)
as well as postsynaptic proteins (NRGN, PSD95, LRFN2) and re-
ceptor proteins (GRIA3, 4) found to be differentially regulated in
the various dementias. AMPAR = AMPA receptor/GRIA;
GAP43 = neuromodulin; NMDAR = N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
receptor; NRGN = neurogranin; VDCC = voltage-dependent cal-
cium channel.

E. Bereczki et al.
 (Gottschall et al., 2010; Mukaetova-Ladinska et al., 2013;
Howlett et al., 2015; Vallortigara et al., 2014; Whitfield
et al., 2014), our results provide support to the link be-
tween cognitive performance and synaptic protein loss in
Lewy body dementia. In line with our previous study, the
current work confirms the power of synaptic proteins
(Bereczki et al., 2016) in discriminating patients with neu-
rodegenerative diseases from controls with good sensitivity
and specificity (480%). In addition, we also found that
GAP43, together with SNAP47, contributed to a clear sep-
aration between patients with Parkinson’s disease dementia
and Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting the potential role of
these proteins in disease discrimination.
a-Synuclein is deeply involved in the synaptic vesicle traf-
ficking required for a proper neurotransmitter release
(Sidhu et al., 2004). Although we selected Alzheimer’s
disease cases with low a-synuclein pathology, we did not
observe any difference in the overall levels of monomeric
a-synuclein protein, neither between Parkinson’s disease de-
mentia and Alzheimer’s disease nor between dementia with
Lewy bodies and Alzheimer’s disease, which could be partly
due to the relative vulnerability of a-synuclein to post-
mortem delay and storage temperature (Ferrer et al.,
2007). This finding is in agreement with a previous prote-
omics study (Shi et al., 2009) carried out in Parkinson’s
disease patients while another proteomics study in patients
with Parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam reported
accumulation of a-synuclein levels (Yang et al., 2007).
The occasional correlations observed between synaptic pro-
teins and a-synuclein scores in Parkinson’s disease dementia
and dementia with Lewy bodies indicate that there is a
potential association but more evidence is needed.
There are some limitations related to the current study.
Although we were able to validate our findings from the
proteomic comparison study, it is possible that some im-
portant synaptic protein level changes may have been
missed due to the relatively small number of patients in
the LC-MS analyses, or due to post-mortem delay times.
Due to the exploratory nature and the small sample size of
the study, correlations with cognitive impairment are pre-
sented without adjustments for multiple comparisons; thus
these findings should be interpreted with caution and re-
quire confirmation in larger samples. The Alzheimer’s dis-
ease group presented more severe cognitive impairment,
with longer dementia duration time compared to dementia
with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia, which
may have influenced the findings. Another caveat to con-
sider is that most patients had advanced disease and the
levels of synaptic proteins may differ in the earlier stages of
disease progression however, these changes are likely to
start early on, which is supported by the association with
cognitive impairment.
In spite of these limitations, our results suggest that syn-
aptic proteins have an important predictive and discrimina-
tive value in neurodegenerative disorders, which needs to
be explored further. Moreover, the independent validation
by antibodies of the level alterations of several synaptic
proteins revealed by proteomics highlights the robustness
of this method. In vivo studies using imaging and CSF
are needed to explore synaptic protein changes at early
disease stages. We believe that pinpointing overall alter-
ations of synaptic proteins occurring in dementia patients
brings us one step closer to a disease-specific biological
target for prevention and therapeutic strategies. We antici-
pate their importance as a treatment target and potential as
a future biomarker of disease progression for clinical trials
as the therapeutic intervention window based on synaptic
repair and regeneration is considerably longer than the cur-
rently used toxin-clearance approaches.
