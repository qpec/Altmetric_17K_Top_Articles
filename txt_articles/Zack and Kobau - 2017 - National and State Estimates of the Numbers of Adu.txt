National and State Estimates of the Numbers of Adults and Children with 
Active Epilepsy — United States, 2015
Matthew M. Zack, MD1; Rosemarie Kobau, MPH1
Epilepsy, a brain disorder leading to recurring seizures, has 
garnered increased public health focus because persons with 
epilepsy experience pronounced and persistent health and 
socioeconomic disparities despite treatment advances, public 
awareness programs, and expanded rights for persons with 
disabilities (1,2). For almost all states, epilepsy prevalence 
estimates do not exist. CDC used national data sources includ-
ing the 2015 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for 
adults (aged ≥18 years), the 2011–2012 National Survey of 
Children’s Health (NSCH), and the 2015 Current Population 
Survey data, describing 2014 income levels, to estimate preva-
lent cases of active epilepsy, overall and by state, to provide 
information for state public health planning. In 2015, 1.2% 
of the U.S. population (3.4 million persons: 3 million adults 
and 470,000 children) reported active epilepsy (self-reported 
doctor-diagnosed epilepsy and under treatment or with recent 
seizures within 12 months of interview) or current epilepsy 
(parent-reported doctor-diagnosed epilepsy and current epi-
lepsy). Estimated numbers of persons with active epilepsy, after 
accounting for income and age differences by state, ranged 
from 5,900 in Wyoming to 427,700 in California. NHIS 
data from 2010–2015 indicate increases in the number of 
persons with active epilepsy, probably because of population 
growth. This study provides updated national and modeled 
state-specific numbers of active epilepsy cases. Public health 
practitioners, health care providers, policy makers, epilepsy 
researchers, and other epilepsy stakeholders, including family 
members and people with epilepsy, can use these findings to 
ensure that evidence-based programs meet the complex needs 
of adults and children with epilepsy and reduce the disparities 
resulting from it.
Epilepsy has been assessed only intermittently in population 
surveys (1,2). Before 2010, the last U.S. national estimate 
of epilepsy prevalence was based on 1986–1990 data using 
one question assessing the occurrence of epilepsy or repeated 
seizures, convulsions, or blackouts in any household family 
members (3). Other recent estimates based on limited U.S. 
and international geographic regions, clinical samples, and 
decades-old data are not representative of the current U.S. 
population (2,4). Data from the 2010 and 2013 NHIS using 
a validated case definition indicate approximately 1% of the 
U.S. population had active epilepsy (5). A study using 2005

similar epilepsy case-ascertainment questions* provided state-
level estimates of a history of epilepsy for 19 states (1.65%) 
and active epilepsy for 13 states (0.84%) (6). No substantial 
differences among states in the prevalence of a history of 
epilepsy or active epilepsy were detected (6). A third study, 
which extrapolated 2007–2011 administrative claims data 
from multiple states to the overall U.S. population found an 
epilepsy prevalence estimate of 0.84% (4). For almost all states, 
epilepsy prevalence estimates do not exist. Groups interested 
in reducing epilepsy prevalence need updated estimates of the 
numbers of persons living with epilepsy nationally and within 
their states. This study aims to provide updated national and 
modeled state-specific estimates of active epilepsy prevalence 
* In 2005, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System included the following 
five epilepsy questions: 1) “Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have 
a seizure disorder or epilepsy?” (response options: “yes,” “no,” “don’t know,” 
and “refused”). Participants who answered “yes” to this question were asked 
some or all of the following questions: 2) “Are you currently taking any medicine 
to control your seizure disorder or epilepsy?” (response options: “yes,” “no,” 
“don’t know,” and “refused”); 3) “How many seizures have you had in the last 
3 months?” (response options: “none,” “one,” “more than one,” “no longer have 
epilepsy or seizure disorder,” “don’t know,” and “refused”); 4) “In the past year, 
have you seen a neurologist or epilepsy specialist for your epilepsy or seizure 
disorder?” (response options: “yes,” “no,” “don’t know,” and “refused”); and 
5) “During the past 30 days, to what extent has epilepsy or its treatment 
interfered with your normal activities like working, school, or socializing with 
family or friends?” (response options: “not at all,” “slightly,” “moderately,” “quite 
a bit,” “extremely,” “don’t know,” and “refused”). The only change between the 
earlier BRFSS and the later NHIS case-ascertainment is that BRFSS includes 
a 3-month recall for any seizure occurrence and NHIS, a 12-month recall for 
any seizure occurrence. This change reflected updated consensus guidance on 
case-ascertainment for community-based epilepsy surveillance.
based on the latest data available to provide information for 
public health action to reduce epilepsy burden.
To estimate the number of prevalent cases of active epilepsy 
among adults aged ≥18 years, CDC analyzed three questions 
on epilepsy from the 2015 Sample Adult component of NHIS, 
an annual, cross-sectional household survey of the civilian, 
noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Adults classified as hav-
ing “active epilepsy” reported a history of doctor-diagnosed 
epilepsy and were taking medication to control it, had had 
one or more seizures in the past year, or both (Table 1) (5,6). 
Validation of survey questions for surveillance of active epilepsy 
yielded sensitivity and specificity exceeding 80% and 99%, 
respectively, with a positive predictive value of 74% similar 
to validation estimates seen in surveillance of other chronic 
disorders (5). Only 0.07% of adults in 2015 refused to answer 
or did not know if they had doctor-diagnosed active epilepsy. 
To estimate prevalent cases of active epilepsy among children 
aged 0–17 years, CDC analyzed data from the 2011–2012 
NSCH,† a cross-sectional telephone survey of households 
with at least one resident child aged 0–17 years at interview. 
NSCH asks parents or guardians if a doctor or health care 
provider ever told them that their child had epilepsy or sei-
zure disorder, and if so, if their child currently has epilepsy or 
seizure disorder (current epilepsy) (Table 1). Only 0.03% of 
parents or guardians refused to answer or did not know if a

doctor had ever told them their child had epilepsy or a seizure 
disorder. Prevalence of current epilepsy among children based 
on NSCH data was estimated to be 6.3 per 1,000, similar to 
estimates from administrative data (7,8).
Obtaining state-level estimates required using the best avail-
able data to confirm that epilepsy prevalence did not differ 
significantly across states (6). Epilepsy prevalence and state 
populations do differ by age and income distribution. NHIS 
and NSCH data was used to calculate the prevalence (pro-
portion) of active epilepsy for three age groups (0–17 years, 
18–64 years, and ≥65 years) stratified by three family income 
groups (0%–99%, 100%–199%, ≥200% of poverty thresh-
olds). Data for 2014 was obtained for the three age groups 
and three family income groups among civilian and military 
noninstitutionalized populations for each state from the U.S. 
Census’s Current Population Survey 2015 Annual Social and 
Economic Supplement.§ Multiplying the age- and income-
specific active epilepsy prevalence estimates by the population 
estimates for each of the three age and income groups yielded 
state-level estimates of active epilepsy, indirectly standardized for 
age and income.¶ Adding these standardized estimates for both 
groups from each data set produced total estimated numbers of 
cases with active epilepsy. Combining the variance estimates of 
both adults and children with epilepsy from each survey and 
of these age- and income-specific population estimates as the 
variance of the product of these two random variables yielded 
95% confidence intervals for these total estimates.**

 ¶ The estimated numbers of active epilepsy cases are calculated in the same way 
as the expected numbers in indirect standardization are calculated to account 
for confounding (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406211).
 
** The formula to calculate the variances for the 95% confidence intervals of 
the expected numbers of active epilepsy cases is found in http://www.jstor.
org/stable/2281592.
In 2015, 1.2% (95% confidence interval = 1.1–1.4) of the 
U.S. population was classified as having active epilepsy (3.4 mil-
lion; 3 million adults and 470,000 children). Among adults, the 
estimated number of cases of active epilepsy ranged from 5,100 
in Wyoming to 367,900 in California (Table 2). Among chil-
dren, the estimated number of cases of current epilepsy ranged 
from 800 in Wyoming to 59,800 in California. The number of 
persons estimated to have active epilepsy was <14,000 in nine 
states and the District of Columbia, 14,000–32,799 in 11 states, 
32,800–56,799 in nine states, 56,800–92,699 in 10 states, and 
≥92,700 persons in 11 states. (Table 2).
Discussion
This study provides updated national and estimated 
state-specific numbers of the active epilepsy cases. Affecting 
3.4 million U.S. residents, epilepsy is not a rare condition. 
Epilepsy poses substantial individual and societal burdens that 
require heightened public health action (1,2). As a complex 
condition varying in severity and impact, it affects persons 
of all ages and racial and ethnic groups, especially those with 
the lowest incomes (2,5,9). Persons with epilepsy often have 
multiple co-occurring conditions (e.g., stroke, heart disease, 
depression, or developmental delay) that complicate their 
epilepsy management, impair life goals, and contribute to 
early mortality (1,2). Among five chronic conditions in chil-
dren and adolescents selected because of their adverse impact 
on academic and health outcomes, epilepsy is the costliest 
and the second most common  (8). Children with seizures 
are more likely to live in poverty, and their parents more 
frequently report food insecurity (9). Direct yearly health 
care costs per person with epilepsy ranged from $10,192 to 
$47,862 (2013 U.S. dollars) and were higher for persons with 
uncontrolled seizures (10).
Medicaid recipients have a higher prevalence of epilepsy, 
especially among adults aged 20–64 years (3.4%) (4); this 
study adjusted for income to account for this confounder.

* Active epilepsy cases in children are estimated from the current epilepsy prevalence in children (2011–2012 National Survey of Children’s Health) and the population 
of children, accounting for the ratios of family income to poverty thresholds.
† Active epilepsy cases in adults are estimated from the prevalence of active epilepsy (taking medication, having had a seizure in the past year, or both) in adults (2015 
National Health Interview Survey) and the population of adults, accounting for the ratios of family income to poverty thresholds. The total population estimates 
come from the 2014 weighted person counts of the Current Population Survey, 2015 Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the civilian noninstitutionalized 
population living in houses and military population living in houses.
§ Confidence interval represents only sampling uncertainty from the sampling uncertainties in the prevalence estimates and in the state-specific and age-specific 
ratios of family income to poverty thresholds.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Epilepsy is a common neurologic disorder resulting in substan-
tial health, social, and mortality disparities.
What is added by this report?
In 2015, approximately 3 million U.S. adults and 470,000 
children had active epilepsy. For almost all states, epilepsy 
prevalence estimates do not exist. Estimated numbers of active 
epilepsy ranged from 5,900 persons with epilepsy in Wyoming 
to more than 427,000 in California. The number of persons with 
active epilepsy increased compared with earlier years, likely 
because of population growth.
What are the implications for public health practice?
This study provides updated national estimates and the first 
modeled estimates of active epilepsy cases for all States. Public 
health practitioners, health care providers, policy makers, 
epilepsy researchers, and other epilepsy stakeholders including 
family members and people with epilepsy, can use these 
findings to ensure that evidence-based programs meet the 
complex needs of adults and children with epilepsy and reduce 
the disparities resulting from it.
The estimated 3 million U.S. adults with active epilepsy and 
470,000 U.S. children with current epilepsy in 2015 exceed 
the estimated 2.3 million U.S. adults in 2010 (5) and the 
450,000 U.S. children with current epilepsy in 2007 (7). The 
estimated increase in numbers of persons with epilepsy is not 
explained by age or income, because this study controlled for 
these known confounders. The increase is likely because of 
population growth over the past decade, or other unknown 
factors (e.g., an increased willingness to disclose one has epi-
lepsy).  The number of prevalent cases of active epilepsy by 
state generally mirrors the states’ population distributions. The 
2015 NHIS epilepsy prevalence estimate (1.2%) in this study 
is roughly consistent with the BRFSS estimate from 13 states 
(0.84% [95% confidence interval = 0.74–0.96]) that used a 
slightly more conservative approach assessing a 3-month seizure 
recall period versus 12 months (6).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi-
tations. First, because these estimates depend on self-report, 
they might be subject to reporting bias. Second, these state 
estimates do not account for possible differences in seizure 
type, severity, or etiology. Third, underreporting associated 
with perceived repercussions in disclosing epilepsy (e.g., 
stigma or driver’s license restrictions) (2) and the exclusion of 
institutionalized adults from the NHIS and the Census might 
underestimate epilepsy prevalence. Fourth, the assumption of 
applying national estimates to states is based on findings from 
13 geographically disparate states indicating no differences in 
epilepsy prevalence, after accounting for multiple comparisons 
and sample size limitations (6). Although adjusting for age and 
income might account for some of the variation in prevalence 
across all states in this study, without available direct surveil-
lance data on epilepsy, these estimates of active epilepsy cases 
in states need empirical confirmation.
Public health practitioners, health care providers, policy 
makers, epilepsy researchers, and other epilepsy stakeholders, 
including family members and people with epilepsy, can use 
these findings to ensure that evidence-based programs meet 
the complex needs of adults and children with epilepsy and 
reduce the disparities resulting from it.
