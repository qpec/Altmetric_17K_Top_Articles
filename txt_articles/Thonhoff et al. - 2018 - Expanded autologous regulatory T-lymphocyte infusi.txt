Abstract
Objective
To determine whether autologous infusions of expanded regulatory T lymphoctyes (Tregs)
into patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are safe and tolerable during early and
later stages of disease.
Methods
Three patients with ALS, with no family history of ALS, were selected based on their differing
sites of disease onset and rates of progression. Patients underwent leukapheresis, and Tregs
were subsequently isolated and expanded ex vivo. Tregs (1 × 106 cells/kg) were administered
IV at early stages (4 doses over 2 months) and later stages (4 doses over 4 months) of disease.
Concomitant interleukin-2 (2 × 105 IU/m2/injection) was administered subcutaneously 3
times weekly over the entire study period. Patients were closely monitored for adverse effects
and changes in disease progression rates. Treg numbers and suppressive function were assayed
during and following each round of Treg infusions.
Results
Infusions of Tregs were safe and well tolerated in all patients. Treg numbers and suppressive
function increased after each infusion. The infusions slowed progression rates during early and
later stages of disease. Spearman correlation analyses showed that increased Treg suppressive
function correlated with slowing of disease progression per the Appel ALS scale for each
patient: patient 1: ρ (rho) = −0.60, p = 0.003; patient 2: ρ = −0.71, p = 0.0026; and patient 3: ρ =
−0.54, p = 0.016. Measures of maximal inspiratory pressure also stabilized, particularly in 2
patients, during Treg infusions.
Conclusions
These results demonstrate the safety and potential benefit of expanded autologous Treg
infusions, warranting further clinical trials in patients with ALS. The correlation between Treg
suppressive function and disease progression underscores the significance of using Treg sup-
pressive function as an indicator of clinical status.

 CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) are
a subpopulation of T lymphocytes that are immunosuppres-
sive and maintain tolerance to self-antigens, with their dys-
function playing a pivotal role in the development of
autoimmune disorders.1–4 In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) mice, infusions of Tregs slow disease progression and
prolong survival, and Tregs suppress the proliferation of re-
sponder T lymphocytes and the activation of microglia.5,6 In
patients with ALS, the expression of the Treg master tran-
scription factor FOXP3 is reduced in rapidly progressing
patients,7 with subsequent impairment of Treg suppressive
functions; FOXP3 expression and Treg suppressive functions
correlate with the extent and rapidity of disease progression.8
When expanded ex vivo in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2
and rapamycin, Treg suppressive function is restored.8,9
These data suggest that infusions of expanded autologous
Tregs will improve Treg suppressive function in vivo and
slow rates of disease progression in patients with ALS. To
test these hypotheses, a first-in-human phase 1 study was
initiated to determine whether infusions of expanded autol-
ogous Tregs into patients with ALS were safe and tolerable
during early and later stages of disease. IL-2 was administered
concomitantly in the patients in an effort to stabilize and
possibly enhance the suppressive functions of the infused
Tregs. Furthermore, the relationship between ex vivo Treg
suppressive functions and patients’ clinical statuses was
explored.
Methods
Primary research question
Are infusions of expanded autologous Tregs safe and tolerable
in patients with ALS during both early and later stages of
disease? This study is a phase 1 trial with no controls and
provides Class IV evidence that infusions of expanded au-
tologous Tregs are safe and tolerable during early and later
stages of disease.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents
Approval from the Food and Drug Administration and In-
stitutional Review Board at Houston Methodist Hospital was
obtained before study initiation. Written informed consent
was obtained before enrollment. The study was registered on
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03241784).
Study design and patient selection criteria
This study was conducted at the Houston Methodist
Neurological Institute. Patients with no family history of
ALS, and with differing sites of symptom onset and rates of
disease progression, were recruited from Houston Meth-
odist Hospital’s Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA)/
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association (ALSA) ALS
clinic. Three patients with arm, bulbar, and leg-onset ALS,
respectively, were enrolled in the trial (table). Patients were
recruited, treated, and followed up between January 2016
and February 2018.
The patients underwent a total of 8 infusions of expanded
autologous Tregs with concomitant subcutaneous IL-2
injections. Four Treg infusions were administered every 2
weeks at an early stage of the disease, followed by 4 Treg
infusions administered every 4 weeks at a later stage. Each
Treg dose was 1 × 106 cells/kg. The Treg dose was empirically
determined but was selected within the range of what has
been shown to be safe and tolerable in patients with type 1
diabetes.4 IL-2 was administered subcutaneously 3 times
weekly at a dose of 2 × 105 IU/m2/injection beginning the day
after the first Treg infusion and continued throughout the
study period.
Infusions of expanded autologous Tregs
Leukapheresis was performed 1 month before the first Treg
infusion. Tregs were isolated and expanded ex vivo in the
Good Manufacturing Practice–compliant facility at M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center according to a previously described
protocol.8,9 Each Treg infusion was administered IV through
a peripheral line, and patients were closely monitored for any
infusion-related adverse responses for 4 hours after the
infusion.
Clinical evaluations
The revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), Appel
ALS Rating Scale (AALS),10 and maximal inspiratory pressure
(MIP) measurements were performed immediately before
each Treg infusion, every 2 weeks during each round of
infusions, and monthly after each round. Forced vital capacity
(FVC) was monitored at each evaluation as a component of
the AALS. Patients were asked about adverse events at each
encounter.
Assessing Treg percentage and suppressive
function in the peripheral blood
Peripheral blood was drawn 1 month before the first Treg
infusion, immediately before each infusion, the day after
each infusion, every 2 weeks during each round of infusions,
and monthly after each round. The percentage of CD4+CD25+
FOXP3+ Tregs within the total CD4+ population was assessed
by flow cytometry.8 Treg suppressive function on the

 proliferation of autologous responder T lymphocytes was

Statistical analysis
Correlation between changes in the AALS and Treg sup-
pressive function was determined by Spearman correlation
using GraphPad Prism 7 software and depicted by Spearman
rho (ρ). Two-tailed p values <0.05 were considered statisti-
cally significant. Data collected between the first and fifth Treg
infusions were compared with values from the day of the first
infusion. Data collected after the fifth Treg infusion were
compared with the values from the day of the fifth infusion.

Results
Safety
No infusion-related adverse events or clinically significant
changes in safety laboratories or electrocardiogram findings
were observed. All patients noted dramatic increases in the
frequency, intensity, and distribution of fasciculations during
each round of infusions. Fasciculations were noted within
a few minutes to a few days after each Treg infusion and
lasting from days to more than 1 month after the completion
of each round of infusions. Patient 1 experienced increased
muscle cramps in his legs from weeks 2–6, 2 falls on weeks 17
and 23, and an episode of pharyngitis on week 10. Patient 2
underwent placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gas-
trostomy tube on week 9. He developed aspiration pneu-
monia on week 19, and his IL-2 injections were temporarily
suspended until week 23. His progressive dysphagia and
episode of aspiration pneumonia were likely due to his
bulbar ALS. Patient 2 dropped out of the study on week 50
because of his progressive disease and was placed in hospice
care. He died on week 51 because of respiratory failure
secondary to ALS. Patient 3 developed 2 suspected gastro-
intestinal infections and an upper respiratory infection be-
tween weeks 24 and 29. She reported mild dyspnea on
exertion beginning on week 48.
Treg percentage and suppressive function
increased during infusions
In all patients, Treg percentage (figure 1, A–C) and sup-
pressive function (figure 1, D–F) increased during the first
round of infusions, declined between each round of infusions,
and increased again during the second round.
Enhanced Treg suppressive function correlated
with slowing of functional decline
In all patients, the rate of decline of the ALSFRS-R and AALS
slowed for 2 months during the first round of infusions, ac-
celerated between each round of infusions, and slowed again
over 4 months during the second round (figure 2, A–C).
Spearman correlation showed that increased Treg suppressive
function correlated with slowing of disease progression per
the AALS for each patient (figure 2, D–F; ρ = −0.60, p = 0.003
in patient 1; ρ = −0.71, p = 0.0026 in patient 2; and ρ = −0.54,
p = 0.016 in patient 3). The larger the increase in Treg

the next clinical evaluation.
MIPs stabilized during infusions
In all patients, the FVC remained relatively unchanged during
the Treg infusions and between each round (figure 3, A–C).
In patients 1 and 3, the MIPs were stable during the first
round of infusions and deteriorated between each round. The
MIPs again stabilized during the second round. Patient 2 was
treated with noninvasive ventilation before enrollment and
continued treatment throughout the study. In patient 2, MIPs
were low, but remained relatively stable during each round of
infusions and between each round (figure 3, D–F).
Discussion
Three patients with ALS were infused with autologous ex-
panded Tregs with concomitant subcutaneous IL-2 injec-
tions at early and later stages of disease. Tregs were also
infused at a later stage of disease to determine whether the
infusions remained safe and the beneficial effects on disease
progression could be extended by increasing the dosing in-
terval. Treg infusions were safe and well tolerated regardless
of the burden of disease. Treg suppressive function corre-
lated with changes in the AALS; the greater the improve-
ment in Treg suppressive function, the slower the rate of
clinical progression. This correlation supports the value
of Treg suppressive function as a meaningful indicator of
clinical status. In addition, Treg infusions did not adversely
affect respiratory function and appeared to stabilize the de-
cline in MIPs in the 2 patients who were not being treated
with noninvasive ventilation.
In a previous pilot study, low-dose IL-2 administered sub-
cutaneously for 1 year in 5 patients with ALS was safe and
tolerable, but did not appear to alter the clinical course or
increase endogenous Treg numbers, likely related to impaired
endogenous Treg responsiveness to IL-2 (unpublished
results). In the present study, subcutaneous injections of low-
dose IL-2 were administered to stabilize the infused expanded
Tregs. During infusions in all patients, several data points
were observed in which IL-2 could have enhanced the pro-
liferation and function of infused Tregs. However, IL-2 was

Arrows and vertical dotted lines represent Treg infusions. The 1st Treg infusion was administered on week 0 and then every 2 weeks for a total of 4
infusions. The 5th Treg infusion was administered in each patient on weeks 48, 27, and 33, respectively, and then every 4 weeks for a total of 4 infusions.
The percentage of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs within the total CD4+ cell population is shown for patient 1 (A), patient 2 (B), and patient 3 (C). Treg
percentages are shown at baseline (weeks 4.6, 3.0, and 4.9 in each patient, respectively), the days of the 1st and 5th Treg infusions, the day after each Treg
infusion, every 2 weeks during each round of infusions, and 1 month after each round. The data point collected the day after the 4th Treg infusion (week 6)
in patient 3 was not determined because of a flow staining error. Treg suppressive function is shown on the same time points as the Treg percentages for
patient 1 (D), patient 2 (E), and patient 3 (F).

 not of critical value in the interim between each round when
Treg percentage and suppressive function and clinical status
deteriorated.
Common to all patients was the perceived increase in fas-
ciculations. The rapid onset of fasciculations suggests a pe-

 immune modulation of ectopic axonal firing. In the earlier IL-
2–alone pilot study, increased fasciculations were not observed,
suggesting that the infused Tregs directly or indirectly caused
the fasciculations in this study. In addition, common to all
patients was the occurrence of infections during the study:
pharyngitis in patient 1, aspiration pneumonia in patient 2, and
gastrointestinal and upper respiratory infections in patient 3. A
potential increased risk of infections with Treg and IL-2
treatment is concerning and requires further study in a larger
number of patients with ALS.
Although this study lacked blinding and placebo controls,
slowing of disease progression was observed during the initial
infusions at an early stage of disease and the subsequent 4
monthly infusions at a later stage of disease. Administering the
ALSFRS-R to the patients during the initial infusions every 2
weeks enhances the likelihood of a placebo effect. However,
we have not observed stabilization of the AALS in previous
studies of subcutaneous IL-2 injections (unpublished) or
infusions of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells.11 Further-
more, the increased Treg suppressive function, which corre-
lated with the clinical state, and the observed stabilization of
MIPs were not likely to have been influenced by a placebo
effect. Increased clinical progression rates were observed
between each round of infusions, but it was not clear whether
the progression was related to the cessation of Treg infusions
or would have occurred spontaneously. More pertinent is the
observation that subsequent Treg infusions were beneficial at
later stages of disease with increased disease burden and rate
of progression. Circulating functional Tregs may slow disease
progression by suppressing peripheral proinflammatory
monocytes/macrophages and responder T lymphocytes, as
well as entering the CNS and suppressing activated microglia.
Defining peripheral and central actions of Tregs merits further
investigation.
The results from this study support the need for a phase 2,
randomized, placebo-controlled trial over a longer period to
test the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of different
doses of Tregs in a larger number of patients with ALS. The
goal of future studies is to determine whether optimized doses
of Tregs infused at regular intervals prolong slowed pro-
gression and minimize the more rapid progression associated
with cessation of Treg infusions.
