The association between paternal and adolescent depressive 
symptoms: evidence from two population-based cohorts
Gemma Lewis, Martha Neary, Ela Polek, Eirini Flouri, Glyn Lewis
Summary
Background Incidence of depression increases markedly around age 13 years, and nearly three-quarters of adults 
report that their mental health problems started in adolescence. Although maternal depression is a risk factor for 
adolescent depression, evidence about the association between paternal and adolescent depression is inconclusive, 
and many studies have methodological limitations. We aimed to assess the association between paternal and 
adolescent depressive symptoms in two large population-based cohort studies. 
Methods We used data for two-parent families from two representative prospective cohorts in Ireland (Growing up in 
Ireland [GUI]) and the UK (Millennium Cohort Study [MCS]). Parental depressive symptoms were measured with the 
Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale in the GUI cohort when children were 9 years old, and the 
Kessler six-item psychological distress scale in the MCS cohort when children were 7 years old. Adolescent depressive 
symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) at age 13 years in the GUI 
cohort and age 14 years in the MCS cohort. We analysed data using linear regression models, before and after 
adjustment for confounders, in both multiply imputed and complete case samples.
Findings There were 6070 families in GUI and 7768 in MCS. After all adjustments, a 1 SD (three-point) increase in 
paternal depressive symptoms was associated with an increase of 0·24 SMFQ points (95% CI 0·03–0·45; p=0·023) in 
the GUI cohort and 0·18 SMFQ points (0·01–0·36; p=0·041) in the MCS cohort. This association was independent 
of, and not different in magnitude to, the association between maternal and adolescent depressive symptoms 
(Wald test p=0·435 in the GUI cohort and 0·470 in the MCS cohort).
Interpretation Our results show an association between depressive symptoms in fathers and depressive symptoms in 
their adolescent offspring. These findings support the involvement of fathers as well as mothers in early interventions 
to reduce the prevalence of adolescent depression, and highlight the importance of treating depression in both parents.

Introduction
Incidence of depression increases markedly around age 
13 years, and almost 75% of adults with depression report 
mental health problems that started in adolescence.1,2 
Early adolescence is therefore important for the primary 
prevention of adult depression—a leading public health 
problem worldwide. One of the most important risk 
factors for adolescent depression is maternal depression;3 
however, there are fewer studies of the association 
between paternal and adolescent depression. This 
association is important given that paternal depression is 
fairly common,4 and that fathers are increasingly involved 
in the care of their children in many countries.5
Few studies of paternal and adolescent depression take 
account of maternal depression, an important possible 
confounder.6 Studies that do account for maternal 
depression 
have 
various 
limitations. 
Many 
are 
small, containing few fathers, and their findings are 
inconsistent.7–12 Some larger studies exist, but they either 
assess depression retrospectively13 or use routine clinical 
data,14 so are susceptible to recall and ascertainment bias. 
The only large prospective study that adjusted for 
maternal depression and did not rely on clinical data 
found no association between antenatal depression in 
fathers and adolescent depression at age 18 years.15 
However, antenatal maternal depression might act via 
the intrauterine environment,3 in which case one would 
not expect an association between paternal antenatal 
depression and adolescent depression. Fathers might 
also take on a larger role in childcare, and become more 
influential, later in childhood.16
In this study, we used two large prospective 
population-based cohorts to investigate the association 
between paternal depression in childhood and offspring 
depression in adolescence, and whether it was independent 
of maternal depression.
Methods
Study design and participants
Growing up in Ireland (GUI)17 is an ongoing representative 
study of two cohorts of children living in Ireland in 
2006: a child cohort recruited at 9 years old, and an infant 
cohort recruited at 9 months old. The present study is 
a secondary analysis of the child cohort (n=8568).

1105 primary schools were invited to participate, and 910 
(82%) agreed, from which children were recruited. 17 054 
families (households) were then randomly selected and 
invited to participate, 9645 (57%) consented, and 8568 
(50%) provided usable data. Two waves of data collection 
have taken place in the child cohort. Wave one occurred 
between August, 2007, and May, 2008 (n=8568), when 
children were a mean age of 9 years (SD 0·13), and wave 
two occurred between August, 2011, and March, 2012 
(n=7525), when children were a mean age of 13 years 
(SD 0·13; 88% response rate).
One adult was asked to identify as the primary 
caregiver, providing most day-to-day care. Resident 
partners were automatically nominated as secondary 
caregivers. Caregivers did not have to be biologically 
related to the child and did not include non-resident 
fathers (attempts were made to contact non-resident 
secondary caregivers, but response rates were low). Of 
primary caregivers (n=8568), 8465 (99%) were mothers 
(female primary caregivers), 8358 (99%) were biological 
parents, and 107 (1%) were another parent or guardian. 
Of families with a primary caregiver, 7118 (83%) were 
two-parent families with data from a secondary caregiver. 
Of the 7118 secondary caregivers, 7072 (99%) were fathers 
(male secondary caregivers). Of these fathers, 6775 (96%) 
were a biological parent, 216 (3%) a step-parent, and 
81 (1%) another parent or guardian.
The Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) 18 is an ongoing 
representative study of 18 552 families and 18 818 children 
born in England and Wales between Sept 1, 2000, and 
Aug 31, 2001, and in Scotland and Northern Ireland 
between Nov 24, 2000, and Jan 11, 2002. Children were 
identified through government child benefit records and 
recruited when they were 9–11 months old. Socially 
deprived areas and ethnic minority groups were 
oversampled to increase representation. Six waves of data 
collection have taken place: when children were aged 
about 9 months (MCS1), 3 years (MCS2), 5 years (MCS3), 
7 years (MCS4), 11 years (MCS5), and 14 years (MCS6). 
We used data from MCS4 and MCS6 to provide the 
closest possible replication of the timepoints used in the 
GUI cohort. At MCS4, 13 857 (72%) of 19 244 families 
participated and at MCS6, 11 726 (76%) of 15 415 families 
participated. 
At 
MCS4, 
data 
were 
provided 
by 
13410 mothers (female main respondents identifying 
themselves as the parent). Of these mothers, 13 392 (99%) 
were biological parents. Interviews were done with 
9429 partners, 9036 of whom were fathers (male partners 
identifying as parents). Of these fathers, 8477 (94%) were 
biological parents. Because of the household survey 
structure of MCS, there were 246 sets of twins and ten 
sets of triplets. We included only singleton children 
(n=13 681 for MCS, n=8568 for GUI).
In each sample we included two-parent families only 
because of our focus on the independence of paternal and 
maternal depressive symptoms. All fathers lived with the 
child. Because of evidence that the association between 
parent and offspring depression does not differ according 
to genetic relatedness,19 we included biological and non-
biological mothers and fathers, but adjusted for whether 
fathers were biologically related. We did not adjust for 
whether mothers were biologically related because of the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Studies of the influence of paternal depression on offspring 
have focused on outcomes in early childhood. There are fewer 
studies of the link between paternal and adolescent 
depression—a major public health problem. We searched 
PubMed for studies published in English before May 31, 2017, 
that investigated paternal and adolescent depression. We used 
the search terms (“paternal” or “father”) and (“depress*”). We 
then manually searched reference lists from these studies. 
Evidence of the association between paternal and adolescent 
depression was inconsistent and few studies had taken account 
of maternal depression, an important possible confounder. 
Studies that had taken account of maternal depression had 
various limitations, including small samples that contained few 
fathers. Some large studies had accounted for maternal 
depression, but they either reported no evidence of an 
association, assessed depression retrospectively, or used clinical 
data, and were therefore susceptible to recall or ascertainment 
bias.
Added value of this study
We found evidence of an association between paternal and 
adolescent depressive symptoms and the effect size was 
independent of, and not different in magnitude to, maternal 
depression. To our knowledge, this is the first time this 
association has been reported in prospective population-based 
cohorts that do not rely on clinical data.
Implications of all the available evidence
Current interventions for preventing adolescent depression 
focus largely on mothers. Our results suggest that when the 
mother is depressed, clinicians should also consider the 
associated yet independent influence of depression in the 
father, particularly since men are less likely to seek treatment 
for depression. Our results are inconsistent with the idea that 
mothers are responsible, or even to blame, for children’s mental 
health, whereas paternal influences are negligible. They suggest 
that the mental health of both fathers and mothers is 
important for the mental health of their children. Interventions 
to improve adolescent mental health should therefore target 
both parents, irrespective of their sex.

Procedures
In both samples, adolescents completed the Short Mood 
and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) at follow-up 
timepoints only (wave two for GUI and MCS6 for MCS). 
The SMFQ is a 13-item self-report measure of DSM-IV 
depressive symptom severity in the past 2 weeks.20 
Possible scores range from 0 to 26, with higher scores 
indicating more severe depressive symptoms. Reliability 
was high (Cronbach’s α was 0·87 for the GUI cohort and 
0·97 for MCS6). We analysed a continuous score to 
maximise statistical power.
In GUI, parents completed the short eight-item version 
of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
Scale (CES-D) at waves one and two.21 The CES-D 
assesses DSM-IV depressive symptoms in the past week 
using a four-point Likert scale, which ranges from “none 
or almost none of the time” to “all or almost all of the 
time”. Possible scores range from 0 to 24, with higher 
scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. 
At wave one, reliability was high for mothers 
(Cronbach’s α 0·87) and fathers (0·80). We analysed a 
continuous score to maximise statistical power.
In MCS, parents completed the Kessler six-item 
psychological distress scale (K6) at waves two to six.22 The 
K6 assesses general distress in the past month, using 
items such as “How often did you feel so depressed that 
nothing could cheer you up?” and “How often did you 
feel hopeless?”. Participants respond using a five-point 
Likert scale, ranging from “none” to “all of the time”. 
Possible scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores 
indicating more severe symptoms. The scale has good 
psychometric properties and an estimated area under the 
curve of 0·83 (range 0·76–0·89, IQR 0·81–0·85) against 
a standard diagnostic assessment of depression 
(the World Mental Health Composite International 
Diagnostic Interview module for major depression).22 
At MCS4, K6 had high reliability for mothers 
(Cronbach’s α 0·97) and fathers (0·99). We analysed 
continuous scores to maximise statistical power.
We identified variables previously associated with 
exposure and outcome that could be common causes of 
depression: family income, parent’s education, parent’s 
and child’s ages, ethnicity, parental substance abuse, 
child’s emotional symptoms, and interparental conflict. 
Measures were similar in each sample. Family income 
was the total income adjusted for household size and 
composition, in quintiles. Parental education ranged 
from 
one 
(none 
or 
compulsory 
education) 
to 
six (postgraduate), classified into compulsory and 
non-compulsory. We adjusted for the child’s ethnicity in 
MCS and father’s ethnicity in GUI (either white or 
ethnic minority, because of small numbers). Childrens’ 
ethnicities were unavailable in GUI. We also adjusted 
for the sex of the child and whether the father was the 
biological parent. In both cohorts, we adjusted for 
paternal and maternal frequency of alcohol use, ranging 
from one (never) to seven (every day), classified into 
tertiles (at MCS4 and baseline in GUI). We adjusted for 
parent’s reports on the emotional symptoms scale of the 
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, a widely used 
measure of internalising and externalising symptoms (at 
MCS4 and at baseline in GUI).23 In GUI, we adjusted for 
baseline paternal and maternal reports on the short 
seven-item version of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, a 
widely used measure of relationship conflict and 
satisfaction.24 In MCS, we adjusted for paternal and 
maternal reports on a short four-item version of the 
Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State, which were 
available at MCS3.25
Statistical analysis
All analyses were done with Stata (version 14), and were 
weighted to account for sampling design. Our primary 
analysis was of the multiply imputed sample with complete 
data for paternal and maternal depressive symptoms.
First, we tested univariable associations between 
paternal and adolescent depressive symptoms using 
linear regressions. We also tested the correlation between 
paternal and maternal depressive symptoms. Second, we 
adjusted for maternal depressive symptoms in a bivariable 
model to test independent associations. Finally, we 
adjusted for potential confounders in a set of multivariable 
models: we adjusted the bivariable model for family 
income; paternal and maternal education; paternal, 
maternal, and child age at time of exposure; sex of the 
child; ethnicity; whether the father was a biological parent; 
and paternal and maternal alcohol use at time of exposure. 
We then adjusted this model for child emotional 
symptoms at the time of the exposure. We assumed that 
parental depressive symptoms were a potential cause of 
interparental conflict, which could be on the causal 
pathway. However, interparental conflict could also be a 
cause of both parental depressive symptoms and later 
adolescent depressive symptoms. We therefore present 
our multivariable model before and after further 
adjustment for interparental conflict.
We tested whether the magnitude of the association 
between paternal and adolescent depressive symptoms 
differed from maternal symptoms using the test 
command in Stata, which performs a Wald test to 
compare coefficients. We also tested an interaction 
between paternal depressive symptoms and sex of 
offspring to investigate whether associations differed

923
between female and male adolescents. Finally, we tested 
an interaction between paternal depressive symptoms 
and whether the father was biologically related to the 
child, to investigate whether associations differed 
according to biological relatedness. Given that we used 
additive rather than multiplicative models, and because 
these interaction tests could be underpowered, all 
interactions were exploratory.26
We used multiple imputation by chained equations to 
account for missing data because complete-case analyses 
can introduce bias when data are not missing completely 
at random.27 We assumed that missingness was 
dependent on observed data (missing at random) and 
imputed 50 datasets. To predict missing data, we used all 
variables selected for analysis models and several 
auxiliary variables. We imputed up to the sample with 
complete data for paternal and maternal depressive 
symptoms. As sensitivity analyses, we also report results 
based on the complete-case samples.

Results
In the GUI cohort, data for depressive symptoms were 
available for 7789 mothers and 6400 fathers, and data 
for both were available for 6070 participants (table 1). 
In this sample, the mean CES-D score for fathers was 
1·4 (SD 3·1) and for mothers was 1·9 (4·4). Paternal and 
maternal CES-D scores were correlated (r=0·15, 95% CI 
0·11–0·19). Data for adolescent depressive symptoms 
were available for 5424 of these families. The mean 
offspring SMFQ score was 3·7 (SD 5·3). When all 
confounders were included, data for a complete-case 
sample were available for 4397 families.
In the MCS cohort, data for depressive symptoms were 
available for 12 270 mothers and 8169 fathers, and data for 
both were available for 7768 participants (table 1). In this 
sample, the mean K6 score for fathers was 2·9 (SD 3·8) 
and for mothers was 2·6 (4·3). Paternal and maternal 
K6 scores were correlated (r=0·18, 95% CI 0·15–0·21). Data 
for adolescent depressive symptoms were available for 6087 
of these families. The mean offspring SMFQ score was 5·4 
(SD 8·3). When all confounders were included, data for a 
complete case sample were available for 4864 families.
In GUI, 4397 participants were in the complete case 
sample and 4171 were not (N=8568). In MCS, 
4864 singleton children were in the complete case sample 
and 8817 were not (N=13681).
Families not included in complete-case samples had 
higher parental depressive symptom scores. In GUI, the 
mean difference for mothers was 0·71 (95% CI 0·57–0·86; 
p<0·0001) and for fathers it was 0·12 (0·00–0·24; p=0·049). 
In MCS, the mean difference for mothers was 1·10 
(0·97–1·24; p<0·0001) and for fathers was 0·34 (0·19–
0·49; p<0·0001). Adolescent depressive symptom scores 
were higher in participants with missing data in GUI 
(mean difference 0·16, 95% CI 0·04–0·36; p=0·11) and in 
MCS (0·37, 0·14–0·60; p=0·0016). Families with missing 
data were also more likely to be in lower family income 
categories. In GUI, 747 (unweighted 21%) families with 
missing data were in the lowest income category versus 
308 (unweighted 7%) with complete data. Of the 
participants 
with 
missing 
data 
in 
MCS, 
2537 (unweighted 29%) were in the lowest income category 
compared with 283 (unweighted 6%) with complete data. 
Families with missing data were also more likely to have 
compulsory education only. Of the participants with 
missing data in GUI, 2308 (unweighted 55%) were in lower 
maternal 
education 
categories 
versus 
1900 
(unweighted 
43%) 
of those with complete data. A similar pattern emerged for 
level of paternal education (1712 [unweighted 63%] 
participants with missing data were in lower education 
categories versus 2225 [51%] with complete data).

in lower education categories versus 2330 (unweighted 48%) 
of those with complete data. For paternal education, 
4060 (unweighted 72%) with missing data were in lower 
education categories versus 2605 (unweighted 54%) with 
complete data.
In univariable models, we found evidence of a positive 
association between paternal and adolescent depressive 
symptoms (table 2). In GUI, for each three-point (1 SD) 
increase in paternal depressive symptoms, adolescent 
depressive symptoms increased by 0·35 of an SMFQ point, 
and in MCS by 0·28 of a point (table 2). Associations 
between paternal and adolescent depressive symptoms 
remained after adjustment for maternal depressive 
symptoms and all other confounders (table 2). Results 
from the complete-case sample were similar (table 3).
We found no evidence that regression coefficients for 
maternal and paternal depressive symptoms differed 
(Wald test p=0·435 for the GUI cohort and 0·470 for the 
MCS cohort). In the GUI cohort, the association between 
paternal and adolescent depressive symptoms was 
stronger for female than for male adolescents 
(pinteraction=0·016). In the MCS cohort, we found no 
evidence that associations differed according to the sex of 
the child (pinteraction=0·769). There was no evidence of an 
interaction between paternal depressive symptoms and 
whether the father was biologically related (pinteraction=0·720 
for the GUI cohort; pinteraction=0·660 for the MCS cohort).
Discussion
In two large, contemporary, population-based cohorts 
from the UK and Ireland, we found evidence that paternal 
depressive symptoms during childhood were associated 
with offspring depressive symptoms in adolescence. This 
association was independent of, and not different in 
magnitude to, the association between maternal and 
adolescent depressive symptoms.
Our study has several strengths. Our cohorts were 
representative and measures and age ranges were similar, 
allowing for replication in independent settings. These 
population-based samples also provided information 
about the many parents with depression who do not 
present to clinical services. Missing data are a potential 
weakness of all cohort studies and attrition was high in 
both samples. However, we used multiple imputation to 
address any bias that might have arisen through attrition.
Our study also has several limitations. We used brief 
self-administered assessments of depressive symptoms 
instead of clinical interviews. This approach might have 
produced less precise estimates, but these errors are 
probably random with respect to our hypothesis, and 
such random measurement error could not have led to 
our results. There are also advantages of symptom 
measures. Depressive symptoms exist as a continuum in 
the general population and symptom measures capture 
this variation in severity, as well as increasing statistical 
power. Furthermore, our measures show high sensitivity 
and specificity with diagnoses of depression in similar 
community samples. The K6 scale, used to assess parent 
depressive symptoms in the MCS cohort, was designed as 
a general measure of psychopathology. However, this 
measure has also shown excellent specificity and 
sensitivity for depressive diagnoses. Therefore, our 
findings should be relevant to depression diagnoses.
We adjusted for children’s emotional symptoms rather 
than for depressive symptoms. The emotional symptoms 
subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire 
was reported by parents rather than offspring, and 
describes a concept broader than depression, although it 
does include items such as “I am often unhappy, 
down-hearted or tearful”. Depression is relatively 
uncommon before puberty, so adjustment for a wider 
range of emotional symptoms at this age could be a better 
way to account for differences in future depression risk, 
though residual confounding by childhood depression is 
still possible.28 Our study did not include single-parent 
families 
because 
we 
investigated 
the 
potential 
independence of paternal and maternal depression. 
Research into the role of fathers in single-parent families 
is scarce. Of course, residual confounding is always a 
possibility in observational studies—eg, we did not have 
detailed information about comorbid health problems in 
parents. Further research that acknowledges the 
complexity of these associations in both parents, and 
their implications for offspring, would be beneficial.

Finally, for both maternal and paternal depressive 
symptoms, it is difficult to judge the potential 
clinical importance of the observed associations. An 
increase of 1 SD in paternal depressive symptoms was 
associated with an increase in adolescent depressive 
symptoms of 0·04 of an SD in GUI and 0·03 in MCS. 
Though small, these findings were observed after 
follow-up of 4 years for GUI and 7 years for MCS, and 
several factors could have led to an underestimation of 
the association, including error in the paternal depression 
measure and outcome. We also used brief measures of 
depressive symptoms before the main period of 
depression incidence in offspring. There is good evidence 
that treatment of maternal depression in clinical 
populations leads to meaningful improvements in 
offspring outcomes.29 Our evidence suggests that similar 
improvements in offspring outcomes would be expected 
if paternal depression were treated, although future 
research to test this possibility is required.
Several studies of adolescent depression report no 
influence of paternal depression, or that the influence of 
maternal depression is stronger.12,30–32 However, many of 
these studies were small, contained few fathers, or did not 
examine adolescent depression as an outcome. In studies 
from previous decades, fathers possibly had less 
involvement with children than in our more contemporary 
samples. In the MCS cohort, the magnitude of the 
maternal depression association appeared stronger than 
that of paternal depression, but there was no statistical 
evidence to support a difference. In the GUI cohort, there 
was no evidence of any difference. Our results also suggest 
that a child with two parents with depression is at greater 
risk than a a child with one parent with depression.
There 
is 
evidence 
that 
the 
intergenerational 
transmission of depression occurs predominantly 
through environmental mechanisms, although genetic 
influences 
are 
also 
important.19 
Environmental 
mechanisms could include social modelling of depressive 
thinking styles.33 There is also good evidence that 
mothers and fathers with depression experience 
difficulties in parenting and parent–child relationships, 
which partly account for the influence of depression on 
their children.34 Most of the work on mechanisms has 
been done with mothers, and less is known about 
possible mechanisms in relation to fathers.35
Our exposure variables were measured before puberty, 
when the prevalence of depression is low, and our 
outcomes in early adolescence, when incidence is only 
just beginning to rise. Adolescent depressive symptom 
scores were higher in MCS than in GUI, possibly 
because adolescents were, on average, 14 years old in 
MCS and 13 years old in GUI. This is an important 
difference in age for the adolescent increase in 
depressive symptoms, which only begins at around the 
age of 13 years.1 Our findings, if they reflect a causal 
relationship, are therefore important for the primary 
prevention of depressive disorder.
Current 
interventions 
for 
preventing 
adolescent 
depression focus largely on mothers. Depressive 
symptoms in parents are associated, and depression in 
one parent is a risk factor for depression in the other.36 
When the mother is depressed, clinicians should therefore 
also consider the associated yet independent influence of 
depression in the father, especially since men are less 
likely to seek treatment for depression.37 This is particularly 
important given that children are at even higher risk when 
both parents have depressive symptoms. Our findings, if 
they reflect a causal relationship, suggest that the priority 
should be treatment of depression in both parents. Our 
results are inconsistent with the idea that mothers are 
responsible, or even to blame for children’s mental health, 
whereas paternal influences are negligible. Rather, they 
suggest that the mental health of both parents is important 
for the mental health of their children. Interventions to 
improve adolescent mental health should therefore target 
both parents, irrespective of their sex.
