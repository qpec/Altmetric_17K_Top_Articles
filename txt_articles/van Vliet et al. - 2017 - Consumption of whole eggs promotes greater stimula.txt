ABSTRACT
Background: Protein in the diet is commonly ingested from whole
foods that contain various macro- and micronutrients. However, the
effect of consuming protein within its natural whole-food matrix on
postprandial protein metabolism remains understudied in humans.
Objective: We aimed to compare the whole-body and muscle pro-
tein metabolic responses after the consumption of whole eggs with
egg whites during exercise recovery in young men.
Design: In crossover trials, 10 resistance-trained men [aged 21 6 1 y;
88 6 3 kg; body fat: 16% 6 1% (means 6 SEMs)] received primed
continuous L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]leucine infusions and
performed a single bout of resistance exercise. After exercise, participants
consumed intrinsically L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine-labeled whole eggs (18 g
protein, 17 g fat) or egg whites (18 g protein, 0 g fat). Repeated blood
and muscle biopsy samples were collected to assess whole-body leucine
kinetics, intramuscular signaling, and myofibrillar protein synthesis.
Results: Plasma appearance rates of protein-derived leucine were
more rapid after the consumption of egg whites than after whole eggs
(P = 0.01). Total plasma availability of leucine over the 300-min post-
prandial period was similar (P = 0.75) between the ingestion of whole
eggs (68% 6 1%) and egg whites (66% 6 2%), with no difference in
whole-body net leucine balance (P = 0.27). Both whole-egg and egg
white conditions increased the phosphorylation of mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1, and eu-
karyotic translation initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1 during
postexercise recovery (all P , 0.05). However, whole-egg ingestion
increased the postexercise myofibrillar protein synthetic response
to a greater extent than did the ingestion of egg whites (P = 0.04).
Conclusions: We show that the ingestion of whole eggs immediately
after resistance exercise resulted in greater stimulation of myofibrillar
protein synthesis than did the ingestion of egg whites, despite being
matched for protein content in young men. Our data indicate that the
ingestion of nutrient- and protein-dense foods differentially stimulates
muscle anabolism compared with protein-dense foods. This trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03117127.

INTRODUCTION
Dietary patterns that include the regular ingestion of high-quality,
protein-dense foods are important to optimize the stimulation of
postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates to improve skeletal
muscle remodeling. Protein quality in human nutrition can be at least
partly determined from the bioavailability of dietary protein–derived
amino acids in the circulation to support whole-body and muscle
protein metabolic needs. Studies have shown that various meal
characteristics, such as protein source (1, 2) and ingested protein
quantity (3), can influence the amount of dietary protein–derived
amino acids available in the circulation to stimulate postprandial
muscle protein synthesis rates. However, most work has focused on
the effects of consuming isolated protein fractions dissolved in liquid
beverages (1, 2, 4–12). There is far less information available about
the effects of ingesting nutrient- and protein-dense whole foods on
the regulation of postprandial protein metabolism. This is notewor-
thy because nutrient-dense whole foods, compared with supple-
mental isolated protein sources, are more commonly consumed
within a normal eating pattern to achieve daily protein recom-
mendations and concomitant improvements in diet quality.

 To better define whole-food protein quality in human nutrition,
we developed intrinsically L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine–labeled eggs to
allow for the detailed assessment of postprandial whole-body
and skeletal muscle protein metabolism in vivo in humans
(13). Eggs are a nutrient-rich food source and are commonly
consumed at breakfast by US adults (14). However, the removal
of the yolk is often promoted for improved health when multiple
eggs are consumed. This an unsubstantiated belief related to the
cholesterol and fat content of the egg yolk (15). The yolk is
nutrient dense and contains w40% of the total protein contained
in the egg, and its removal seems counterproductive for meeting
protein recommendations. Because nutrient-dense protein foods
are often recommended to achieve protein recommendations
(16), it is important to define how the ingestion of more nutrient-
and protein-dense foods modulates protein metabolism under a
setting that includes other components of a healthy lifestyle,
such as the incorporation of regular exercise.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare whole-
body leucine kinetics and postprandial myofibrillar protein
synthesis rates after the ingestion of whole eggs and isonitro-
genous amounts of egg whites during recovery from resistance
exercise in young men. In addition, we examined skeletal muscle
amino acid transporter protein content and the phosphorylation
status of protein signaling molecules that may regulate changes in
myofibrillar protein synthesis rates (17). We hypothesized that
whole-egg ingestion, due to its fat content, would delay the
appearance rates of postprandial protein-derived amino acids in
circulation but would not modulate plasma dietary amino acid
availability or myofibrillar protein synthesis rates throughout a 0-
to 300-min recovery period when compared with egg white
ingestion in healthy young men.
METHODS
Participants and ethical approval
Ten healthy young men (mean 6 SEM age: 21 6 1 y) who
were regularly engaged in structured resistance exercise training
(mean 6 SEM training years: 5 6 1 y) volunteered for the study.
Participant characteristics are presented in Table 1. All of the
participants were deemed to be healthy on the basis of responses
to a routine medical screening questionnaire and had no pre-
vious history of participating in stable-isotope amino acid tracer
experiments. All of the participants were informed about the
experimental procedures to be used, the purpose of the study,
and all potential risks before giving written consent. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Univer-
sity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and conformed to stan-
dards for the use of human participants in research as outlined in
the seventh revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03117127.
Experimental design
A within-subject crossover design was used for this study. At
least 1 wk before the first infusion trial, participants reported to
the laboratory for familiarization with the exercise equipment and
for maximum strength testing as determined by their 10–repetition
maximum (10-RM) for the leg press and leg extension. In ad-
dition, body weight and height were measured, as was body
composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic
QDR 4500A). On a separate occasion, $3 d after initial maxi-
mum strength testing and $3 d before the first infusion trial,
participants re-visited the laboratory to confirm their 10-RM for
the leg press and leg extension. The highest obtained 10-RMs
for the leg press and leg extension (mean 6 SEM: 233 6 32 and
112 6 10 kg, respectively) were used to set the workload for
the infusion trials. Participants were instructed to refrain from
vigorous physical activity for 3 d before each trial and to re-
cord their dietary intake by using an online food tracker
(MyFitnessPal) for 2 d before each trial. Participants were
subsequently instructed to follow their food diary as closely as
possible during the 2 d leading into the second infusion trial
while again recording their dietary intake. The average 2-d
macronutrient intake was similar between the whole-egg and
egg white trials (P = 0.16) (Supplemental Table 1). Partici-
pants were counterbalanced in random fashion so that half of
the participants would consume whole eggs or egg whites for
their first infusion trial. The time between crossover trials was
7–14 d (8 6 1 d). A CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials) flowchart of the study is presented in Sup-
plemental Figure 1.
Infusion protocol
A schematic overview of the infusion protocol is shown in
Figure 1. For both infusion trials, participants reported to the
laboratory at 0700 after an overnight fast. After collecting a
baseline breath sample, a polytetrafluorethylene catheter
was inserted into an antecubital vein for baseline blood
sample collection (t = 2210 min) and participants received
priming doses of NaH13CO2 (2.35 mmol/kg), L-[1-13C]leucine
(7.6 mmol/kg), and L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine (2.0 mmol/kg).
Subsequently, a continuous intravenous infusion of L-[1-13C]
leucine (0.10 mmol $ kg21 $ min21) and L-[ring-2H5]phenylal-
anine (0.05 mmol $ kg21 $ min21) was initiated (t = 2210 min)
and maintained over the infusion trials. A second Teflon catheter
was inserted into a heated dorsal hand vein for repeated arte-
rialized blood sampling and remained patent by a 0.9% saline
drip. In the postabsorptive state of infusion trial 1, muscle biopsy
samples were collected at t = 2150 and 230 min of infusion to
determine fasted myofibrillar protein synthesis rates, relative
skeletal muscle amino acid transporter content, and anabolic-
related signaling. In the subsequent crossover trial, only one
muscle biopsy was collected at t = 230 min for anabolic-related

 signaling analysis and fasted myofibrillar protein–bound tracer
enrichment. After collection of the resting muscle biopsy sample
at t = 230 for both trials, the participants performed resistance
exercise that consisted of 4 sets of 10 repetitions at 80% of
10-RM for both the leg press and leg extension exercises. The
exercise external work (repetitions 3 load) was matched between
the whole-egg (9896 6 52 kg) and egg white (9893 6 52 kg)
trials (P = 0.34). Immediately after completion of the exercise
bout, participants consumed 3 whole eggs or an equivalent
amount of protein from egg whites (t = 25 min). Participants also
finished 300 mL water with each meal. The completion of the
meal marked the start of the postprandial phase (t = 0 min), and
additional muscle biopsy samples were collected at t = 120 and
300 min. To reduce the number of muscle biopsy samples col-
lected and to minimize participant discomfort during the in-
fusions, biopsy samples were not collected immediately after the
completion of exercise for both the whole-egg and egg white
treatments (t = 25 min). As such, it is assumed that the brief
resistance exercise period (w25 min) did not significantly affect
muscle protein synthesis rates expressed over 2 and 5 h of post-
exercise recovery, as we explained in detail in previous work (18).
Biopsy samples were collected from the middle region of the
vastus lateralis (15 cm above the patella) with a Bergstro
¨m needle
modified for suction under local anesthesia (2% Lidocaine;
Hospira Worldwide). The postabsorptive muscle biopsy samples
in trial 1 were collected from the same incision with the needle
pointed to distal and proximal directions, respectively. The
muscle biopsy samples obtained at t = 120 and 300 min of
postexercise recovery were collected from the contralateral leg
through separate incisions (2–3 cm apart) for both trials. All of
the muscle biopsy samples were freed from any visible blood,
adipose, and connective tissue; immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen; and stored at 2808C until subsequent analysis. Breath
samples and arterialized blood samples were collected every 30 or
60 min during the postabsorptive and postprandial states. Total
carbon dioxide production rates were measured with a metabolic
cart (TrueOne 2400; ParvoMedics) at regular intervals throughout
the infusion trials. The blood samples were immediately analyzed
for whole-blood glucose concentrations (2300 Stat Plus; YSI Life
Sciences) and subsequently centrifuged at 3000 3 g for 10 min at
48C. Aliquots of plasma were frozen and stored at 2808C until
subsequent analysis. The breath samples were collected in 10-mL
evacuated tubes and stored at 208C until subsequent determination
of 13CO2 enrichment by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IDmicro
Breath; Compact Science Systems Ltd.).
Meal composition
The intrinsically
L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine–labeled
eggs were
produced by supplementing the diet of laying hens (Lohmann
LSL Whites) with 0.3% L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine as described pre-
viously (13). A portion of the collected eggs had the yolks re-
moved before storage at 2208C in aliquots of 18 g protein. The
other portion of eggs had the yolks and whites completely mixed
before storage at 2208C in aliquots of isonitrogenous amounts.
The L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine enrichments of the whole-egg and egg
white aliquots were determined by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) and averaged 28.6 and 26.1 mole percent
excess, respectively. Proximate analyses for protein, lipid, and
carbohydrate concentrations were determined by using the
combustion method (method 990.03; AOAC International, 2000;
TruMac; LECO Corporation) (13). Leucine contents of the
whole-egg and egg white aliquots were determined by GC-MS
with integration of amino acid peak areas compared with an
internal standard (DL-p-chlorophenylalanine) by using the AM-
DIS software package (version 2.71; National Institute of
Standards and Technology) (19). Before the infusions, the egg
aliquots were thawed overnight in a refrigerator at 48C. On the
morning of the experiment, the whole eggs or egg whites were
scrambled in a skillet until solid with no visible liquid remain-
ing. The macronutrient composition and energy content were
18 g protein (1.57 g leucine), 17 g fat, and 226 kcal for the
whole eggs and 18 g protein (1.60 g leucine), 0 g fat, and 73 kcal
for the egg white treatments.
Plasma analyses
Plasma insulin concentrations were determined by using a
commercially available ELISA (Alpco Diagnostics). Plasma
triglyceride concentrations were determined by using a point-of-
care chemistry analyzer (Piccolo Xpress Chemistry Analyzer;
Abaxis). Plasma amino acid concentrations and enrichments
were determined by GC-MS analysis (Agilent 7890A GC/5975C;
MSD) as described in our previous work (13). Briefly, plasma
samples were prepared for amino acid analysis with the use of a
mixture of isopropanol:acetonitrile:water (3:3:2, vol:vol:vol) and
centrifuged at 20,000 3 g for 10 min at 48C. Subsequently, the
supernatant was dried and the amino acids converted into tert-
butyldimethylsilyl
derivatives
before
GC-MS
analysis.
Plasma L-[1-13C]leucine and L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine enrichments
were determined by ion monitoring at m/z 302 (m + 0), 303
(m + 1), and 305 (m + 3), with m + 0 representing the lowest
FIGURE 1
Schematic of the experimental infusion protocol. Participants consumed whole eggs or egg whites in a randomly assigned order (n = 10 for
both trials as a crossover design). Two pre-exercise muscle biopsy samples were collected at the first trial only. In trial 2, one pre-exercise muscle biopsy
sample was collected at t = 230 min. Exercise consisted of 4 sets of 10 repetitions for the leg press and leg extension exercises. Asterisks indicate blood and
breath sampling; filled circles indicate muscle biopsies.

 molecular weight of the ion or unlabeled leucine. For
L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine, m/z 336 (m + 0) and 341 (m + 5) were
monitored for unlabeled and labeled phenylalanine, respectively.
Plasma enrichments of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivative of
a-[13C]-ketoisocaproate were measured by GC-MS analysis by
ion monitoring at m/z 232 and 233. The plasma leucine concen-
trations were determined by integrating amino acid peak areas in
comparison to U-[13C6]leucine as an internal standard with the
use of the AMDIS software package (version 2.71; National In-
stitute of Standards and Technology) (19).
Muscle analysis
Myofibrillar protein–enriched fractions were isolated from
w50 mg wet tissue as described previously (13). Myofibrillar-
enriched protein pellets were hydrolyzed overnight in 6 M HCl
at 1108C. The resultant free amino acids were purified by using
cation exchange chromatography (Dowex 50W-X8-200 resin;
Acros Organics) and dried under vacuum. Free amino acids
were resuspended in 60% methanol and centrifuged before the
myofibrillar protein–bound enrichments were determined by
5500 QTRAP liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrome-
try (Sciex). The myofibrillar protein–bound
L-[ring-2H5]phe-
nylalanine enrichments were determined by multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) at m/z 166.0/103.0 and 171.0/106.0
for unlabeled and labeled
L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine, respec-
tively. Muscle intracellular free amino acids were extracted
from a separate piece of wet muscle (w30 mg) by using a
polytetrafluorethylene-coated pestle and ice-cold 2% perchloric
acid and then centrifuged at 10,000 3 g at 48C for 10 min. The
supernatant was then collected, and this process was repeated
2 more times. The supernatant was taken as the muscle in-
tracellular free amino acids and subsequently purified by using
cation exchange chromatography (Dowex 50W-X8-200 resin;
Acros Organics) before analysis by liquid chromatography–
tandem mass spectrometry. Muscle intracellular free L-[1-13C]
leucine and L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine enrichments were measured by
MRM at m/z 132.0/86.0, 133.0/87.0, and 135.0/89.0 for
unlabeled and labeled leucine. For L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine
enrichments, MRM at171.0/106.0 for unlabeled and labeled
phenylalanine was measured. Sciex Software Analyst 1.6.2 was
used for data acquisition and analysis.
Western blotting
A portion of whole-muscle homogenates isolated during the
myofibrillar protein extractions was used for Western blotting
analysis. The protein concentrations of the homogenates were
determined by bicinchoninic acid assay protein assay (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and then used to prepare working samples of
equal concentrations in Laemmli buffer. Working samples were
heated to 958C for 5 min, and equal amounts of protein (10 mg)
were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane (wet transfer, 100 V for 60 min) for
antibody incubation. Membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free
milk at room temperature for 60 min, washed in Tris-buffered
saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and incubated in primary
antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 48C
to determine phosphorylation status of adenosine monophosphate–
activated protein kinase a (AMPKa) at Thr172 (catalog no. 2535),
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) at
Ser2448 (catalog no. 2971), extracellular signal–regulated
kinase (Erk1/2) at Thr202/Tyr204 (catalog no. 4377), eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) at
Thr37/46 (catalog no. 9459), and eukaryotic translation elon-
gation factor 2 (eEF2) at Thr56 (catalog no. 2331). The anti-
bodies (1:1000; Abcam) used to determine the relative protein
content of skeletal muscle amino acid transporters were solute
carrier family 7 member 5/large neutral amino acid transporter
small sub unit 1 (SLC7A5/LAT1), solute carrier family 3
member 2/CD98 (SLC3A2/CD98), and solute carrier family
38 member 2/sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter
2 (SLC38A2/SNAT2). After overnight incubation of the primary
antibody (48C), membranes were then washed (3 3 5 min
TBST), incubated in secondary antibody for 60 min at room
temperature (1:20,000 in 3% fat-free milk), and washed (3 3
5 min TBST) before detection with chemiluminescence (catalog
no. WBKLS0500; Millipore). To determine the phosphorylation
status of 70-kDa S6 protein kinase (p70S6K1) at Thr389
(catalog no. 9205), 25 mg protein was loaded followed by
incubation in primary (overnight, 1:1000 in 5% bovine serum
albumin) and secondary antibody (1:5000 in 5% fat-free milk).
Bands were imaged by using FluorChem E Imaging System
(Protein Simple; Alpha Innotech). Bands were quantified by
using AlphaView SA software (Protein Simple) and normalized
to Ponc
¸eau S staining; this approach has been validated as an
alternative loading control (e.g., a-actin) for Western blot
analysis (20, 21).
Calculations
Whole-body leucine kinetics were assessed under non–steady
state conditions by the ingestion of L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine eggs
combined with intravenous infusion of
L-[1-13C]leucine.
Leucine oxidation was calculated from the appearance of
the
13C-label in the expired carbon dioxide by using the
a-[13C]ketoisocaproate reciprocal pool model with fractional bi-
carbonate retention factors of 0.7 and 0.83 for postabsorptive and
postprandial states, respectively (22). For the other leucine fluxes,
calculations were performed by using the plasma L-[5,5,5-2H3]
leucine and L-[1-13C]leucine enrichments and leucine concentra-
tions. Total, exogenous, and endogenous leucine rates of appear-
ance (Ra) and total leucine rates of disappearance (Rd) were
calculated with the use of modified Steele equations (23, 24).
Furthermore, plasma protein-derived leucine availability, total
leucine oxidation, nonoxidative leucine disposal (NOLD),
whole-body leucine net balance, and whole-body leucine re-
tention were calculated (see Supplemental Methods for
more details on calculations) (23, 24). Myofibrillar protein frac-
tional synthesis rates (FSRs) were calculated by using the stan-
dard precursor-product equation by dividing the increment in
L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine enrichment in the myofibrillar protein
pool by the weighted average of L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine en-
richment in the plasma or intracellular muscle free precursor pool
over time.
Statistical analysis
A within-subject crossover design was used for this study. A
power analysis based on previous research (2, 12) showed that

 n = 8/condition was sufficient to detect differences in post-
prandial muscle protein synthesis between conditions when
using a 2-sided statistical test (P , 0.05, 80% power, f = 1.2;
G*power version 3.1.9.2). Considering a potential dropout rate
of 20% during the protocol, the final number of participants
recruited was 10/condition. Differences in time-dependent blood
and muscle measurements were tested by 2-factor (time 3 con-
dition) repeated-measures ANOVA. Differences in self-reported
dietary intakes, exercise external loads, and the fraction of dietary
protein–derived leucine that appeared into plasma were tested by
paired t test. When significant interaction effects were identified
in the ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc tests were performed to
determine the differences between means for all significant main
effects and interactions. For all analysis, differences were con-
sidered significant at P , 0.05. All of the calculations were
performed by using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 24) unless
otherwise designated. All data are expressed as means 6 SEMs.
RESULTS
Plasma metabolites and enrichments
Plasma leucine concentrations increased after egg inges-
tion (time: P , 0.001) with no differences between conditions
(time 3 condition: P = 0.76). Peak plasma leucine concen-
trations were observed at 150 min (210 6 14 mmol/L) and
240 min (200 6 11 mmol/L) after the ingestion of egg whites
and whole eggs, respectively (Figure 2A). Plasma glucose
concentrations tended to decrease transiently at 60 min of the
postprandial period (P = 0.06) with no differences between
conditions (time 3 condition: P = 0.73) (Figure 2B). Plasma
insulin concentrations rapidly increased after egg ingestion
(time: P , 0.001) with no differences between conditions
(time 3 condition: P = 0.48) (Figure 2C). Plasma triglyceride
concentrations increased at 180 min after the ingestion of
whole eggs but not egg whites (time effect: P = 0.007; time 3
condition: P = 0.03) (Figure 2D).
Plasma
L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine enrichment rapidly increased
after egg ingestion (P , 0.001) with no differences between

white ingestion (time effect: P , 0.001) with no differences
between conditions (time 3 condition: P = 0.86) (Figure 3B).
Plasma a-[13C]ketoisocaproate enrichments increased after egg
ingestion (time effect: P , 0.001) with no differences between
conditions (time 3 condition: P = 0.68) (Figure 3C). Plasma

(time 3 condition: P = 0.78) (Figure 3D).
Whole-body leucine kinetics
Exogenous leucine rates of appearance (representing the ap-
pearance of dietary protein–derived leucine into circulation) in-
creased after whole-egg and egg white ingestion (time effect:
P , 0.001) (Figure 4A). Exogenous leucine appearance rates were
higher between 15 and 75 min after the ingestion of egg whites than
after whole eggs, whereas exogenous leucine rates of appearance
were higher between 150 and 300 min after whole-egg ingestion
than after egg whites (time 3 condition: P = 0.001). Thus, more
rapid peak exogenous leucine appearance rates were observed at
75 min (529 6 56 nmol $ kg21 $ min21) than after 120 min (496 6
38 nmol $ kg21 $ min21) of the postprandial period after the in-
gestion of egg whites and whole eggs, respectively. The fraction of
dietary protein–derived leucine that appeared in the circulation
during the first 120 min of the postprandial period was greater after
egg white (34% 6 2%) than after whole-egg (25% 6 3%) ingestion
(P = 0.02). However, the cumulative fraction of dietary protein–
derived leucine that appeared in the circulation throughout the
300-min postprandial period was similar between the egg white
(68% 6 1%) and whole-egg (66% 6 2%) conditions (P = 0.75).
Endogenous leucine rates of appearance (representing the appear-
ance of leucine derived from whole-body protein breakdown into
the circulation) decreased after egg ingestion (time effect:
P , 0.001) with no differences between conditions (time 3
condition: P = 0.17) (Figure 4B). Total leucine rates of appearance
increased after egg ingestion (time effect: P , 0.001) with no
differences between conditions (time 3 condition: P = 0.83)
(Figure 4C). Total leucine rates of disappearance increased after
egg ingestion (time effect: P , 0.001) with no differences between
conditions (time 3 condition: P = 0.84) (Figure 4D).
AUCs of fasted and fed rates of whole-body protein breakdown
[Endo (endogenous) Ra], synthesis (NOLD), oxidation (Total
Ox), and net balance (NOLD 2 Endo Ra) are presented in
Figure 5. Regardless of condition, egg ingestion decreased
whole-body protein breakdown rates (time effect: P , 0.001;
time 3 condition: P = 0.31) and increased whole-body synthesis
rates (P = 0.031; time 3 condition: P = 0.87), thereby resulting
in an improved net protein balance when compared with fasted
conditions (time effect: P , 0.001; time 3 condition: P = 0.27).
Whole-body leucine oxidation rates decreased (time effect:
P = 0.008) after egg ingestion with no differences between
conditions (time 3 condition: P = 0.74).

between conditions (time 3 condition: P = 0.49) (Figure 7D).
4E-BP1 phosphorylation was elevated throughout postexercise
recovery (time effect: P , 0.001) with no differences between
conditions (time 3 condition: P = 0.23) (Figure 7E). There was
no change in the phosphorylated state of eEF2 phosphorylation,
regardless of egg condition, during recovery from exercise (time

 no differences between conditions (P = 0.63) or other time
points (all P . 0.05).
Myofibrillar protein synthesis rates
With the use of plasma L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine enrichments
as the precursor, myofibrillar FSRs increased above fasted
values (0.015% 6 0.002%/h) after egg white and whole-egg
ingestion (time effect: P = 0.015), with a greater cumulative
response (0–300 min) after whole-egg ingestion (0.034% 6
0.004%/h; 2.7- 6 0.5-fold above fasted) when compared with
egg white ingestion (0.024% 6 0.002%/h; 1.9- 6 0.4-fold above
fasted) (time 3 condition: P = 0.04) (Figure 8). The temporal
pattern of change in the early (0–120 min) and late (120–300 min)
myofibrillar protein FSR after egg ingestion was not different
between thewhole-egg and egg white conditions (time 3 condition:
P = 0.54); however, both egg conditions were elevated above the
fasted state during the early and late recovery phases (all P , 0.05)
(Figure 8, inset).
Similarly, by using the intracellular L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine
enrichment as the precursor, the cumulative (0–300 min) myo-
fibrillar protein FSR increased above fasted values (0.07% 6
0.011%/h) to a greater extent after whole-egg ingestion (0.13% 6
0.017%/h; 2.1- 6 0.3-fold above fasted) than after egg white
ingestion (0.086% 6 0.006%/h; 1.6- 6 0.3-fold above fasted)
(time effect: P = 0.001; time 3 condition: P = 0.05). However,
by using intracellular L-[ring-2H5]phenylalanine enrichments as
the precursor, the temporal pattern of increase in myofibrillar
protein FSR did not show time- or condition-dependent differ-
ences in the response (time effect: P = 0.12; time 3 condition:
P = 0.53). Specifically, postexercise myofibrillar protein FSRs
between 0 and 120 min were 0.140% 6 0.035%/h (2.5- 6 0.8-
fold above fasted) and 0.098% 6 0.017%/h (1.8- 6 0.6-fold
above fasted) after whole-egg and egg white ingestion, re-
spectively. Between 120 and 300 min, myofibrillar protein FSRs
were 0.123% 6 0.027%/h (1.8- 6 0.3-fold above fasted) and

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, we report for the first time the potentiation
of exercise-mediated stimulation of postprandial myofibrillar
protein synthesis rates in response to the ingestion of whole eggs
compared with isonitrogenous amounts of egg whites in healthy
young men. Our work points to the concept that dietary protein
may show differential anabolic properties on skeletal muscle
tissue when consumed within its natural whole-food matrix.
Similar to isolated protein sources (e.g., whey and casein) (5,
24), we also showed that the consumption of protein-dense foods
in the form of whole eggs and egg whites improves whole-body
net protein balance (Figure 5). Although insight into whole-body
protein kinetics can provide valuable information on whole-body
protein remodeling and net anabolism, it is not uncommon that
whole-body protein kinetics may “mask” important changes
within specific tissues such as skeletal muscle (2). In particular,
the observed potentiation of postexercise myofibrillar protein
synthesis rates in response to whole-egg compared with egg
white ingestion was not observed on a whole-body level in
which there was a similar stimulation of whole-body protein
synthesis rates in both conditions.
We studied various upstream factors that are often assumed to
be regulatory for postprandial muscle anabolism in an attempt to
underpin how the ingestion of whole eggs supported a greater
postexercise myofibrillar protein synthetic response. In particu-
lar, we showed more rapid appearance rates of protein-derived
leucine into the circulation and higher peak leucinemia after
egg white than after whole-egg ingestion (Figure 4). The plasma

 leucine profiles were similar in pattern to previous studies that
used either isolated egg protein (25) or whole eggs (26). However,
there were no differences between the total amount of dietary
protein–derived leucine that became available in circulation
throughout the 5-h postprandial period between the egg white
(68% 6 1%) and whole-egg (66% 6 2%) conditions. Similarly,
there were no differences in the relative protein content of
skeletal muscle amino acid transporters (e.g., SLC7A5/LAT1,
SLC3A/CD98, and SLC38A2/SNAT2) (Figure 6) or muscle free
L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine enrichments during recovery from exercise
between the egg conditions (Table 2). Collectively, these data
indicate that muscle amino acid sensing, amino acid uptake, or
both likely did not contribute to the differential stimulation of
postexercise myofibrillar protein synthesis rates between the egg
conditions.
In addition, the temporal assessment of various metabolic and
molecular readouts often associated with the control of trans-
lation initiation and elongation, such as mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK)–related and mTORC1-related signaling path-
ways, did not show significant differences in phosphorylation
between the egg conditions (Figure 7). The lack of differences in
the phosphorylated state of mTORC1-mediated signaling be-
tween the egg conditions could imply that this anabolic pathway
was maximized from the previous performance of resistance
exercise and food ingestion (2, 9, 10, 25), thereby obscuring any
subtle nonprotein nutritive influences of whole-egg consumption
on mTORC1 phosphorylation and its downstream targets. We
also examined metabolic regulatory pathways and energy-
sensing protein phosphorylation. Similar to the other assessed
molecular readouts, there were no observed differences in the
phosphorylated states of AMPK or Erk1/2.
The essential amino acid compositions, and leucine in par-
ticular, were nearly identical between the egg conditions (27).
Thus, differences in the amino acid composition of the ingested
egg sources likely did not have an influential role in the muscle
anabolic response. In addition, the greater overall energy content,
and subsequent insulinemia, within the whole-egg (256 kcal) and
egg white (73 kcal) conditions likely did not influence the dif-
ferential stimulation of the postprandial myofibrillar protein
synthetic response. For example, it has been shown that only
relatively low plasma insulin concentrations (5 mU/mL) are
required to maximize the muscle anabolic potential of elevated
plasma amino acid availability in humans (28, 29). Moreover,
the additional substrate (i.e., fat) for energy production with
whole-egg ingestion did not spare the use of amino acids for
oxidative “fuel” (Figure 5). Also, previous reports have shown
that providing additional energy with isolated protein sources
does not amplify the anabolic properties of dietary amino acids
to stimulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates when
compared with the ingestion of protein or amino acids alone
(6–8, 30, 31).
Interestingly, research has shown that other food components,
beyond dietary amino acids, may have a supporting role in
modulating postprandial muscle anabolism during recovery from
exercise. For example, Elliot et al. (32) previously showed that
whole-milk ingestion immediately after resistance exercise
resulted in greater amino acid uptake across the leg than after the
consumption of isonitrogenous or isoenergetic amounts of skim
milk in healthy young adults. In the present study, we showed a
greater early (0–120 min) postprandial dietary-derived leucine
availability after the ingestion of egg whites (34% 6 2%) than
after whole eggs (25% 6 3%). The greater postprandial plasma
leucine availability after egg white than after whole-egg in-
gestion, however, did not result in a greater early stimulation of
the postprandial (0–120 min) myofibrillar protein synthetic re-
sponse after the ingestion of egg whites when compared with
whole eggs. Hence, it seems that “extra” nutritional food con-
stituents, and not simply a rapid aminoacidemia or leucinemia

 (1, 5, 11, 12), may also have a role in modulating the postprandial
muscle protein synthetic response in healthy adults. For example,
as part of its whole-food matrix, the egg yolk contains various
nonprotein food components that may have anabolic properties,
such microRNAs (33), vitamins (34, 35), minerals (36), and lipids
[e.g., phosphatidic acid (37), palmitic acid (38), and DHA (39)] by
modifying pathways related to transcriptional or protein trans-
lational control. However, more work is required to systematically
assess the role of such food components on modulating post-
prandial muscle protein synthesis rates in vivo in humans.
It is important to note that despite recent modifications of
dietary guidelines to reflect that total dietary cholesterol intake is
often misrepresented as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease
(40, 41), popular practice may still dictate the discarding of the
yolk when multiple eggs are consumed in a meal. However, the
yolk is nutrient dense and may contain a variety of important
bioactive compounds such as lipids, micronutrients, antioxidant
carotenoids, and microRNAs (42, 43). The removal of the yolk
and its associated nutrients from eggs may limit the stimulation of
muscle protein synthesis rates as well as overall human health
(42, 44, 45). Overall, this work supports recommendations that
nutrient- and protein-dense foods are cornerstones to meeting
daily protein requirements to optimize muscle protein synthesis
rates with exercise.
In conclusion, we show that postexercise myofibrillar protein
synthesis rates are stimulated to a greater extent after the con-
sumption of whole eggs than after the consumption of egg whites
in healthy young men, despite being matched for protein content.
We observed no differences between egg conditions in the com-
monly assumed regulators of postexercise muscle protein synthesis
rates, such as total postprandial plasma leucine availability, whole-
body leucine oxidation rates, skeletal muscle amino acid transport
protein content, or molecular readouts associated with metabolic
and anabolic protein signaling. Future work is required to identify
the potential role of nonprotein food components to contribute to
the stimulation of postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates in
humans. This information is important because other nutritional
components may contribute to food protein requirements and
particularly when dietary protein is consumed in moderate
amounts (w15–20 g protein/meal).
