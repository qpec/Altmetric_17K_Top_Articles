Summary
Background Infected necrotising pancreatitis is a potentially lethal disease and an indication for invasive intervention. 
The surgical step-up approach is the standard treatment. A promising alternative is the endoscopic step-up approach. 
We compared both approaches to see whether the endoscopic step-up approach was superior to the surgical step-up 
approach in terms of clinical and economic outcomes.
Methods In this multicentre, randomised, superiority trial, we recruited adult patients with infected necrotising 
pancreatitis and an indication for invasive intervention from 19 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients were randomly 
assigned to either the endoscopic or the surgical step-up approach. The endoscopic approach consisted of endoscopic 
ultrasound-guided transluminal drainage followed, if necessary, by endoscopic necrosectomy. The surgical approach 
consisted of percutaneous catheter drainage followed, if necessary, by video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement. 
The primary endpoint was a composite of major complications or death during 6-month follow-up. Analyses were by 
intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN09186711.
Findings Between Sept 20, 2011, and Jan 29, 2015, we screened 418 patients with pancreatic or extrapancreatic 
necrosis, of which 98 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the endoscopic step-up approach (n=51) or 
the surgical step-up approach (n=47). The primary endpoint occurred in 22 (43%) of 51 patients in the endoscopy 
group and in 21 (45%) of 47 patients in the surgery group (risk ratio [RR] 0·97, 95% CI 0·62–1·51; p=0·88). 
Mortality did not differ between groups (nine [18%] patients in the endoscopy group vs six [13%] patients in the 
surgery group; RR 1·38, 95% CI 0·53–3·59, p=0·50), nor did any of the major complications included in the 
primary endpoint.
Interpretation In patients with infected necrotising pancreatitis, the endoscopic step-up approach was not superior to the 
surgical step-up approach in reducing major complications or death. The rate of pancreatic fistulas and length of 
hospital stay were lower in the endoscopy group. The outcome of this trial will probably result in a shift to the endoscopic 
step-up approach as treatment preference.

Introduction
Acute pancreatitis is a potentially lethal disease with 
increasing incidence. Approximately 10–20% of patients 
develop necrosis of pancreatic parenchyma or extra­
pancreatic tissues.1,2 Moreover, about one third of these 
patients develop infection of the necrotic tissue, which 
generally requires an invasive intervention.3
In the past 10 years, the surgical step­up approach, 
consisting of percutaneous catheter drainage followed, if 
necessary, by minimally invasive necrosectomy, has 
replaced open surgery as the standard treatment.4,5 A 
randomised trial of the surgical step­up approach versus 
primary open necrosectomy showed that catheter drain­
age as a first step obviates the need for necrosectomy in 
35–50% of patients.4,6
An endoscopic step­up approach is a potentially 
less invasive alternative. Endoscopic necrosectomy has 
shown promising results in reducing complications in 
several observational studies and one small pilot random­
ised trial.7,8 These favourable results were explained by 
the absence of general anaesthesia and surgical ex­
ploration with a reduction of surgical stress and surgery­
associated complications such as pancreatic fistulas. 
The endoscopic approach can also be per 
formed in 
a step­up fashion, starting with endoscopic trans­
luminal drainage, only to be followed by endoscopic 
necrosectomy if drainage does not result in clinical 
improvement.
We did a multicentre randomised trial to investigate 
whether the endoscopic step­up approach is superior to

the surgical step­up approach in patients with infected 
necrotising pancreatitis.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this multicentre, randomised, superiority trial, we 
recruited adult (≥18 years of age) patients from seven 
university medical centres and 12 teaching hospitals of the 
Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group with a high suspicion or 
evidence of infection of pancreatic or extrapancreatic 
necrotic tissues (ie, infected necrosis) with an indication 
for invasive intervention, for whom both the endoscopic 
and surgical step­up approach were deemed feasible by a 
multidisciplinary expert panel. We defined infected 
necrosis as a positive culture obtained by fine­needle 
aspiration or the presence of gas within necrotic collections 
on contrast­enhanced CT. Infected necrosis was suspected 
in necrotising pancreatitis patients with clinical signs of 
persistent sepsis or progressive clinical deterioration 
despite maximal support on the intensive care unit (ICU) 
without other causes for infection. Key exclusion criteria 
were previous invasive interventions for necrotising 
pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, and recurrent acute 
pancreatitis. Further exclusion criteria are given in the 
 
appendix (p 4).
All patients or their legal representatives provided 
written informed consent before randomisation. The 
study protocol9 was approved by the institutional review 
board of the Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam and 
all other participating centres, and the study was 
conducted according to this protocol. All authors 
vouched for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and analyses.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the 
endoscopic step­up approach or the surgical step­up 
approach. Block randomisation with a concealed, fixed 
block size and stratified by treatment centres was per­
formed centrally by the study coordinators (SvB and JvG) 
using a web­based randomisation program. Owing to the 
un 
feasibility of masking, all participants and physicians 
were aware of treatment allocation.
Procedures
An expert panel consisting of 17 experts (nine gastro­
intestinal surgeons, four gastrointestinal endoscopists, 
and four radiologists [including MAB, TLB, MJB, VCC, 
CHD, CHvE, HvG, J­WH, SHH, JSL, KPvL, VBN, 
J­WP, RT, HGG, and PF]) assessed the indication, timing, 
and feasibility of both the endoscopic and surgical step­ 
up 
approaches for all patients.4 Whenever possible, random­
isation and intervention were postponed until 4 weeks 
after onset of pancreatitis in line with international 
guidelines.5
Treatment strategies were standardised across sites. 
Patients assigned to the endoscopy group underwent 
endoscopic ultrasound­guided transluminal (ie, trans­
gastric or transduodenal) drainage with placement of 
two 7 Fr (2·3 mm diameter) double pigtail stents and

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Before the start of our trial, we did an extensive literature 
search using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library 
database for studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and 
Dec 31, 2010. We used the search terms “necrosectomy” and 
“pancreatitis”. We included only studies with patients with 
infected necrosis or symptomatic sterile necrosis, published in 
English. Studies needed to report the results of patients with 
infected necrosis separately, as well as mortality and 
complications. We excluded cohorts with fewer than five 
patients and studies of patients with chronic pancreatitis. 
We identified one small pilot trial, 13 cohort studies, and two 
systematic reviews. The pilot trial of 20 patients compared an 
endoscopic necrosectomy with a surgical necrosectomy in 
patients with infected necrosis. This trial was not designed or 
powered for differences in clinically relevant outcomes but the 
results suggested a reduced pro-inflammatory response and 
development of new-onset organ failure after endoscopic 
necrosectomy. Furthermore, this pilot trial did not incorporate 
the step-up approaches because it only included patients in 
whom catheter drainage had failed and subsequently required 
necrosectomy. The other studies had numerous limitations 
(ie, small number of patients, retrospective study design, no 
fixed treatment algorithms, and included patients with sterile 
necrosis) but they all showed promising results in favour of 
endoscopic necrosectomy by indirect comparison with surgical 
necrosectomy. The pilot trial showed significant results by 
direct comparison.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, our study is the first high-quality trial to 
compare an endoscopic step-up approach with the current 
reference standard of a surgical step-up approach in patients 
with infected necrosis. Our results are the first to provide level 1 
evidence for a reduction in hospital stay and pancreatic fistulas 
in favour of the endoscopic step-up approach.
Implications of all the available evidence
On the basis of the results of this study, we expect that 
guidelines will shift from minimally invasive surgery towards 
endoscopic treatment. Furthermore, treatment of infected 
necrosis should always take a step-up approach, with 
endoscopic drainage as the first step. In conclusion, an 
endoscopic step-up approach reduces pancreatic fistula, length 
of hospital stay, and costs without any evidence for impaired 
safety; therefore, this approach should be considered the 
strategy of choice in patients with infected necrosis.

one 8·5 Fr (2·8 mm) nasocystic catheter as the first step. 
If drainage alone did not lead to considerable clinical 
improvement, endoscopic transluminal necrosectomy 
was performed.9
Patients assigned to the surgery group underwent 
radiological CT­guided or ultrasound­guided percutaneous 
catheter drainage as first step. The preferred route was 
through the left retroperitoneum with the catheter as 
guidance for video­assisted retroperitoneal debridement 
(VARD), if needed. For most collections, this route is the 
shortest and thereby often the safest. Furthermore, the 
drain remains retroperitoneal and does not infect the intra­
abdominal space.4,10 If drainage was clinically unsuccessful 
a VARD procedure was performed.11
In both treatment groups, additional endoscopic as well 
as percutaneous drainage and endoscopic or surgical 
necrosectomies were allowed. All interventions were done 
by experienced endoscopists, surgeons, and interventional 
radiologists. Details on both treatment groups, inter­
ventions, postoperative management, and criteria for 
clinical improvement are in the appendix (pp 4–6).
Routine laboratory tests were done at randomisation and 
for the 7 consecutive days after, as per daily clinical practice. 
Follow­up visits were 3 and 6 months after randomisation. 
Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire, a CT 
was performed, and exocrine and endocrine pancreatic 
function were measured (appendix p 6). 
Data were collected by local physicians using a 
standardised case record form (CRF). An independent 
monitor, unaware of the treatment assignments, checked 
all endpoints and CRFs with on­site source data. 
Discrepancies were resolved through consensus among 
two investigators who were unaware of treatment 
allocation and not involved in patient care. All CTs were 
reviewed by an experienced abdominal radiologist (TLB) 
unaware of the treatment group and outcomes.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was a composite of major 
complications or death within 6 months after random­
isation. Major complications were defined as new­onset 
organ failure (ie, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or renal), 
bleeding requiring intervention, perforation of a visceral 
organ requiring intervention (except for the intentionally 
made perforation during endopscopic treatment), 
enterocutaneous fistula requiring inter 
vention, and 
incisional hernia (including burst abdomen). Predefined 
secondary endpoints included the individual components 
of the primary endpoint, pancreatic fistula, exocrine and 
endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, biliary strictures, 
wound infections, need for necrosectomy, total number 
of interventions, length of hospital and ICU stay, costs 
(eg, costs per patient with poor outcome, costs per quality­
adjusted life­year [QALY], and total direct and indirect 
medical costs), quality of life, and the total number of 
crossovers between groups (for definitions of these 
primary and secondary endpoints see appendix pp 9–10).
An adjudication committee composed of five surgeons, 
three endoscopists, and one radiologist performed a 
blinded outcome assessment. They individually evaluated 
each patient for the occurrence of the primary endpoint. 
Disagreements were resolved during a plenary consensus 
meeting before data analysis started.
After enrolment of each consecutive group of 
25 patients, an independent data safety and monitoring 
committee evaluated the progress of inclusion and safety 
endpoints for each patient with unblinded data. Patient 
reports and a list of potential adverse events were 
presented to the data safety and monitoring committee 
(see appendix p 7).
Statistical analysis
Based on an expected absolute reduction in the primary 
composite endpoint of 26% (from 43% to 17%) with a two­
sided α of 5%, power of 80%, and 2% loss to follow­up, we

calculated a total sample size of 98 patients. The expected 
reduction in the primary endpoint in favour of the 
endoscopic step­up approach was based on the results of 
various cohort studies, systematic reviews, and a small 
randomised controlled pilot trial.7,12–23
We present results as relative risks with corresponding 
95% CIs. We compared dichotomous data with Fisher’s 
exact test, continuous data with the Mann­Whitney U test, 
and categorical data with the linear­by­linear association 
test.
All primary analyses were by intention to treat. We also 
did per­protocol analyses. We did a formal test of 
interaction using logistic regression to assess whether 
treatment effects differed significantly between predefined 
subgroups (ie, patients with singular or multiple organ 
failure at randomisation, academic or non­academic 
institutions, and time between onset of symptoms and 
randomisation [<28 vs ≥28 days]).
We did no interim analyses. We considered a two­sided 
p value of less than 0·05 to be statistically significant, and 
did not adjust p values for multiple testing. Additional 
details on the statistical analyses are in the appendix 
(pp 7–8).
We calculated costs as the product sum of the number of 
resources used and their respective unit costs. Quality­
adjusted life­years (QALYs) were calculated as the product 
sum of EQ­5D­3L­based health utilities at successive 
measurements during follow­up (3 and 6 months after 
randomisation) and the lengths of times in between 
measurements and baseline. We calculated confidence 
intervals for between­group differences using bias­
corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrapping, stratified by 
treatment group and drawing 1000 samples of the same 
size as the original sample separately for each group and 
with replacement. Lastly, we did several non­specified post­
hoc analyses of the primary endpoints, which are presented 
in the appendix (p 11).
This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, 
number ISRCTN09186711.

Results
Between Sept 20, 2011, and Jan 29, 2015, 418 patients with 
pancreatic or extrapancreatic necrosis in 19 Dutch 
hospitals were screened, of which 98 were eligible 
(figure). 51 patients were randomly assigned to the 
endoscopic step­up approach and 47 to the surgical step­
up approach. In each treatment group, one patient did 
not undergo any intervention because of spontaneous 
clinical improvement shortly after randomisation. In 
two other patients in the endoscopy group, owing to the 
technical difficulty of the drainage procedure, the 
endoscopist was not able to successfully puncture the 
collection. These two patients underwent treatment 
within the surgical step­up approach and were analysed

endoscopy group. Baseline characteristics were equally 
distributed between groups (table 1).
The primary composite endpoint occurred in 22 (43%) 
patients in the endoscopy group and in 21 (45%) in the 
surgery group (relative risk 0·97, 95% CI 0·62–1·51; 
p=0·88; table 2). We observed no significant difference 
in new­onset single organ failure between groups 
(table 2); however, new­onset cardiovascular organ 
failure and persistent cardio 
vascular organ failure 
occurred more frequently in the surgery group (table 2). 
We observed no differences in major complications 
including bleeding, perforation of a visceral organ, 
entero 
cutaneous fistula, and incisional hernia. Mort 
ality 
was similar in both groups (table 2). The causes of death 
between both groups did not differ, with most patients 
dying because of progressive sepsis (two [22%] of nine 
patients in the endoscopy group, two [33%] of six in the 
surgery group) and multiple organ failure (four [44%] in 
the endoscopy group, two [33%] in the surgery group).
The incidence of pancreatic fistulas was lower in the 
endoscopy group than in the surgery group (table 2). All 
patients with pancreatic fistulas required persistent 
drainage during follow­up and nine (60%) of these 
patients (one patient in the endoscopy group and eight in 
the surgery group) underwent an additional endoscopic 
retrograde cholangiopancreatography with pancreatic 
sphincterotomy or stent placement. At 6­month follow­
up, we observed no differences regarding exocrine and 
endocrine insufficiency, biliary strictures, and wound 
infections (table 2).
Mean length of hospital stay was 16 days shorter in the 
endoscopy group compared with the surgery group 
(table 2). 22 (43%) patients in the endoscopy group and 
24 (51%) patients in the surgery group were treated with 
catheter drainage only (table 2). The remaining patients 
underwent necrosectomy, occurring sooner in the endo­
scopy group compared with the surgery group (table 2). 
More necrosectomy procedures were done in the 
endoscopy group compared with the surgery group. We 
observed no difference in the median number of 
interventions (drainage or necrosectomy) between 
groups (table 2).
The most common adverse events were pneumonia 
(16 [31%] patients in the endoscopy group vs nine [19%] 
in the surgery group), bacteraemia (11 [22%] vs six [13%]), 
ascites (seven [14%] vs eight [17%]), urinary tract infection 
(six [12%] vs four [9%]), cholecystitis or cholangitis 
(four [8%] vs three [6%]), and atrial fibrillation (three [6%] 
vs two [4%]). All adverse events are listed in the appendix 
(pp 21–22). 
Correction for trends in baseline characteristics 
(ie, chronic renal insufficiency, systemic inflammatory 
res 
ponse syndrome, and modified multiple organ dys­
function syndrome) with multivariable regression 
analyses did not affect the results (appendix p 26). 
Predefined subgroup analyses for time of randomisation 
and institution showed no significant differences in the 
primary endpoint (appendix p 12). We found no 
differences in outcome in the subgroup of patients with 
organ failure at randomisation or after correction for 
imbalances in baseline in this subgroup. Additional per­
protocol analyses did not affect the results, except that 
persistent cardio 
vascular organ failure no longer differed 
between groups (appendix pp 13–14).
The mean costs of the index interventions (ie, all 
drainage and necrosectomy procedures) were €3785 in the 
endoscopy group and €2851 in the surgery group, with a 
mean difference of €934 (BCa 95% CI −€82 to €2097). The 
mean total costs per patient from randomisation until 
6­month follow­up were €60 228 for the endoscopic 
step­up approach and €73 883 for the surgical step­up 
approach. The resulting mean difference of −€13 655 
(−€35 782 to €10 836) per patient was not significant.
The number of QALYs gained for the endoscopy group 
was 0·2788 (BCa 95% CI 0·2458 to 0·3110) compared 
with 0·2988 (0·2524 to 0·3398) for the surgery group. 
The mean difference was −0·0199 (−0·0732 to 0·0395). 
The savings per loss of a single QALY were €684 455. The 
probability of the endoscopic step­up approach being 
cost­effective is 0·896 at a societal willingness­to­pay 
level of €50 000 per QALY (see appendix pp 15–20 for 
details of the cost analysis).
Discussion
This randomised superiority trial showed that the 
endoscopic step­up approach was not superior to the 
surgical step­up approach in reduction of major compli­
cations or death in patients with infected necrosis. 
However, our results showed a benefit in secondary 
endpoints of endoscopic treatment.
Our results are not in line with a previous small 
randomised controlled trial,7 a systematic review,8 and

observational studies24,25 suggesting clinical superiority 
of endoscopy. Several possible explanations exist for the 
differing outcome. First, observational studies have a 
risk of confounding by indication and most of these 
studies did not have a well defined study protocol or 
clearly described treatment algorithms. Furthermore, 
patients with sterile collections were also included in 
some of these studies, which could have led to 
comparisons of less severe cases with patients with 
infected necrosis. In our trial, inclusion criteria were 
strict and were confirmed by an expert panel.
Second, in line with a previously proposed hypothesis, 
the previous small trial7 showed that endoscopic 
treatment led to a less severe pro­inflammatory response 
and, subsequently, fewer occurrences of new organ 
failure compared with surgery. These results were also 
not confirmed in our trial. Although we did not measure 
the pro­inflammatory response, new­onset single organ 
failure as a clinical manifestation of immune response 
did not differ between groups. However, both cardio­
vascular and persistent cardiovascular organ failure 
were lower in the endoscopy group. This difference 
could be the result of the differing designs of both 
studies. The previous trial7 compared an endoscopic 
necrosectomy with a surgical necrosectomy instead of 
two step­up approaches as in our trial. This trial design 
also explains the inclusion of more severely ill patients 
(ie, patients in whom percutaneous drainage failed) in 
the previous trial.7 Moreover, 40% of the surgical patients 
in the previous study7 received open necrosectomy as 
opposed to VARD, whereas in our trial no patients 
underwent an open necrosectomy. This difference is 
important because open necrosectomy is thought to be 
associated with more complications than is VARD.
Third, patients in our trial were more severely ill than 
those included in the previous trial7 in terms of ICU stay, 
presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, 
single or multiple organ failure at randomisation, and the 
high percentage of patients with confirmed infected 
necrosis compared with the patients included in previous 
observational studies. 
Finally, our sample size could still have been too small. 
The number of patients needed was based on the results 
of small, mostly observational studies. A small sample 
size might therefore have overestimated the effect of 
endoscopic treatment.
51% of surgical patients were successfully treated with 
catheter drainage only. This result is higher than the 
35% successfully treated in a previous randomised trial,4 
but comparable with a published systematic review.6 We 
found that more than 40% of patients in the endoscopy 
group were also successfully treated with endoscopic 
drainage only without additional necrosectomy. Previous 
research has identified male sex, multiple organ 
failure, increasing percentage of pancreatic necrosis, and 
heterogeneity of the collection as negative predictors 
for success of percutaneous catheter drainage in 
infected necrotising pancreatitis.26 The total number of 
necrosectomy procedures in both treatment groups are 
in line with published data.4,7
During the inclusion period, 37 (14%) of 260 patients 
were excluded because either the endoscopic or surgical 
approach was deemed not possible. As with percutaneous 
drainage, endoscopic drainage was feasible in almost all 
patients included (96%). 14 (27%) of 51 patients in the 
endoscopy group needed additional percutaneous 
catheter drainage mostly when necrosis was extending 
down retroperitoneally into the pelvis. Despite the need 
for additional percutaneous drainage, the incidence 
of pancreatic fistulas was significantly lower in the 
endoscopy group. All recorded pancreatic fistulas were 
external (ie, pancreaticocutaneous fistulas). These 
fistulas might account for serious morbidity (ie, pain, 
loss of pancreatic juices), additional interventions, 
extended hospital stay, and intensified follow­up. So­
called internal pancreatic fistulas probably also occurred 
in the endoscopy group. These internal fistulas, how

ever, are deemed less clinically relevant than external 
pancreatic fistulas.
The interval between the first drainage and first necro­
sectomy was notably shorter in the endoscopy group 
than in the surgery group. This result could be due to a 
potentially higher threshold in the surgery group to 
proceed to VARD after catheter drainage compared with 
the threshold in the endoscopy group to proceed to 
endoscopic necrosectomy. Additional necrosectomy after 
endocopic drainage is a relatively small step, done by the 
same specialist via the same route. The step from 
catheter drainage to VARD in the surgery group was 
larger, with the surgeon performing the minimally 
invasive surgical necrosectomy after previous drainage 
done by the radio 
logist. Furthermore, compared with the 
endoscopy group, drains in the surgery group were more 
often repositioned and upsized, and multiple drains were 
placed more often.27 This argument is supported by the 
difference in patients treated with solely catheter 
drainage in the surgery group between a previous 
trial4 (35%) and our current study (50%), indicating more 
extensive and better drainage in our study. Moreover, 
percutaneous drains have a larger diameter and 
potentially clog less frequently than do endoscopic 
catheters. These aspects of the surgical step­up approach 
might have resulted in a prolonged effect of percutaneous 
drainage, delay of necrosectomy, and, subsequently, 
prolonged hospital stay.
During the course of the trial, short lumen­apposing 
fully­covered metal stents were introduced into the 
medical armatorium, which are gaining popularity in 
endoscopic treatment. The larger diameter compared 
with the plastic pigtail stents that were used in this trial 
potentially leads to better drainage and, hypothetically, 
fewer 
necrosectomies. 
Disadvantages 
might 
be 
migration of the stent, bleeding, perforation, and stent 
overgrowth.28–31 In view of insufficient evidence of 
significant benefit of metal stents over plastic pigtail 
stents, we decided to use the well studied pigtail stents 
during the entire study.
Our study has some limitations. First, as mentioned, 
our sample size was still relatively small. However, 
because no trends for differences in mortality were seen, a 
larger trial is unlikely to find a significant difference in 
mortality. Second, almost one third of patients in the 
endoscopy group underwent additional percutaneous 
drainage. Because this was a pragmatic trial, percutaneous 
drainage was allowed, as would be done in clinical practice 
in these patients. Third, follow­up was 6 months after 
randomisation. This length could be too short to detect 
further benefits or complications of the endoscopic step­
up approach on the long term.
Treatment of infected necrosis is complex and mortality 
remains high despite treatment techniques becoming 
progressively less invasive and more tailored. In clinical 
practice, the endoscopic step­up approach is gaining 
popularity alongside the surgical step­up approach. Our 
study has shown that both approaches are valid treatment 
options, although an important clinical advantage of the 
endoscopic approach is the reduction in external pan­
creatic fistulas and hospital stay. In our view, patients 
with infected necrosis should be treated in tertiary 
referral centres by multidisciplinary teams where both 
the endo 
scopic and surgical step­up approach are 
available, because a combined approach might be 
required in some patients. Based on current findings, the 
first step of step­up treatment will most likely be 
endoscopic, if several options are available. In the future, 
a tailored approach based on patient characteristics, 
location of collections, and degree of encapsulation will 
probably become the new standard.

In conclusion, this multicentre randomised trial did not 
show the hypothesised superiority of the endoscopic step­
up approach in reducing major complications or death in 
patients with infected necrosis, although the number of 
pancreatic fistulas and total hospital stay were lower in the 
endoscopy group.
