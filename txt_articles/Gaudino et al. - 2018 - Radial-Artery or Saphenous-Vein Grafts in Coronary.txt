Abstract
Abstract 
Background:
Background: Use of radial-artery grafts for coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) may improve 
postoperative outcomes as compared with use of saphenous-vein grafts. However, randomized 
controlled trials comparing radial-artery grafts and saphenous-vein grafts have been individually 
underpowered to detect differences in clinical outcome. We performed a patient-level meta-
combined-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing radial-artery grafts and saphenous-
vein grafts for CABG. 
Methods:
Methods: Six trials were identified. The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial 
infarction and repeat revascularization. The secondary outcome was graft patency at follow-up 
angiography. Mixed-effect Cox regression models were used to estimate the treatment effect on 
outcomes. 
Results:
Results: A total of 1036 patients were included in the analysis (534 patients with radial-artery 
grafts and 502 patients with saphenous-vein grafts). After a mean follow-up time of 60±30 
months, use of radial-artery grafts was associated with a significantly lower incidence of adverse 
cardiac events (HR 0.67; 95%CI 0.49-0.90; P=0.01). At follow-up angiography (mean follow-up 
50±30 months), use of radial-artery grafts was associated with a significantly lower risk of 
occlusion (HR 0.44; 95%CI 0.28-0.70; P<0.001). Use of radial-artery grafts was associated with a 
nominally lower incidence of myocardial infarction (HR 0.72; 95%CI 0.53-0.99; P=0.04) and a lower 
incidence of repeat revascularization (HR 0.50; 95%CI 0.40-0.63; P<0.001) but not a lower 
incidence of all-cause death (HR 0.90; 95%CI 0.59-1.41; P=0.68). 
Conclusions:
Conclusions: In comparison to use of saphenous-vein grafts, use of radial-artery grafts for CABG 
resulted in a lower rate of adverse cardiac events and a higher patency rate at 5-year follow-up.

Introduct
Introduction
ion 
Despite the recommendations of the current guidelines, the use of multiple arterial grafts for 
coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) has not been widely adopted by the surgical community, 
and the great majority of patients in North America and Europe currently receive saphenous-vein 
grafts in addition to an internal-thoracic-artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary 
artery.1 Surgical resistance to the use of multiple arterial grafts can be explained, at least in part, 
by the fact that the clinical benefit of additional arterial grafts reported in observational studies 
has not been confirmed in randomized clinical trials.2 While several trials have demonstrated 
superior angiographic patency rates with radial-artery grafts over saphenous-vein grafts,2 these 
studies were individually underpowered to detect differences in clinical events. Therefore, 
whether use of radial-artery grafts can improve clinical outcomes remains unknown. To overcome 
the limitations of individual studies in detecting differences in clinical outcomes, a patient-level 
meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing radial-artery grafts vs saphenous-vein grafts for 
CABG was performed.

Methods
Methods 
The RADIAL (Radial Artery Database International Alliance) project was initiated in March 2015 by 
a group of clinical investigators conducting trials and research related to radial-artery grafting. One 
key aim of RADIAL was to combine individual patient-level data from individual trials comparing 
use of the radial artery and other conduits for CABG to provide the basis for meta-analytic studies. 
The full list of the RADIAL investigators and the list of the detailed individual contributions to this 
study can be found in the Supplementary Appendix. The project was funded by the Department 
of Cardiothoracic Surgery of Weill Cornell Medicine. The funder had no role in the design or 
conduct of the study; in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or in the writing of 
the manuscript or the decision to submit it for publication. 
 
Search strategy and study selection 
The present analysis includes only randomized trials comparing the long-term (≥2 years) outcomes 
for patients randomized to receive either radial-artery grafting or saphenous-vein grafting to 
supplement left internal-thoracic-artery grafting during isolated CABG surgery. The full search 
strategy is listed in the Supplementary Appendix. 
 
After identification of trials for inclusion, the RADIAL investigators compared trial protocols and 
publications from each trial and then provided a detailed specification of core minimum data 
requirements to each trial team to prepare the data for pooling. After receipt, data were checked 
for missing values and for consistency. Data queries were resolved through direct consultation 
with each trial team before analysis. The most up-to-date follow-up information was also 
  
 
 
5 
requested from the trial investigators. Renal insufficiency was defined as preoperative serum 
creatinine >1.5 mg/dl.3 
 
The design of this analysis was published a priori on the International Prospective Register of 
Systematic Reviews (CRD42017077562) and the present report was conducted in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
recommendations. 
 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiac events during follow-up, including 
death, myocardial infarction or repeat revascularization. Each item of the composite outcome was 
also analyzed individually. Pre-specified subgroup analyses for the primary outcome were 
performed by age, gender, presence of diabetes, prior myocardial infarction, left ventricular 
ejection fraction <35%, preoperative renal insufficiency, and radial-artery graft target vessel. The 
secondary outcome was graft patency at protocol-defined follow-up angiography. Patency rate 
was graded according to the Fitzgibbon classification,4 which grades graft patency as A (widely 
patent), B (flow limited), or O (occluded). For the purposes of our analysis, Grades A and B were 
considered patent and grade O occluded.   
 
Statistical analysis 
Baseline categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages and compared with a 
conditional regression analysis stratified by trial. Baseline continuous variables were reported as 
  
 
 
6 
mean and standard deviation and compared with a 2-way analysis of variance stratified by trial. 
Outcomes were reported as raw numbers and linearized event rates per 1,000 patient-years to 
account for different follow-up durations across trials. Cumulative incidences were determined 
and graphically presented.  
 
The primary analysis for clinical and angiographic end points was performed based on the 
intention-to-treat principle using a 1-stage approach. Patient data were combined in a single 
dataset and fitted in a Cox regression model stratified by trial, using trial identifiers as random 
effects. A competing-risk framework was used to compute pseudo hazard ratios (HR) for 
myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization.5 Treatment effect was presented as HR and 
95% confidence interval (CI). The proportional-hazard assumptions were verified using Schoenfeld 
residuals. Multivariable Cox models were implemented to investigate independent risk factors for 
graft occlusion including baseline characteristics and the chronic use of agents to prevent arterial-
graft spasm.   
 
For the primary end point, subgroup and interaction term analyses were used to investigate the 
pre-specified possible effect modifiers. A non-linear relationship between age and treatment 
effect was investigated by comparing model fitting using age as a linear term vs. as a spline 
function with an increasing number of knots. A potential age cut-off for the loss of benefit with 
the radial artery was evaluated with nonparametric bootstrap pointwise confidence limits 
computation across a range of ages.  
  
 
 
7 
 
As a sensitivity analysis, the treatment effect for the primary end point was re-estimated using an 
as-treated analysis and a 2-step approach. The as-treated analysis was implemented using the 
conduit received as the treatment indicator, thus accounting for crossovers. For the 2-stage 
approach, individual participant data were first analyzed in each separate study independently 
with Cox regression. This step produced aggregate data for each study with a mean treatment 
effect estimate and its standard error. Aggregate data were then synthesized in the second step 
using the generic inverse variance method and a fixed or random effects model in the case where 
I2 was lower or higher than 50%, respectively. An influence analysis was used to assess the 
influence of individual studies on the final estimate. Publication bias was evaluated by means of 
funnel plot and linear regression test for asymmetry.  
 
In a supplementary analysis, a generalized mixed-effect logistic regression using the original trials 
as a random effect was performed to assess the effect of conduit selection on the risk of 
perioperative stroke. A mixed-effect Cox regression was used to investigate potential risk factors 
for radial-artery graft occlusion and saphenous-vein graft occlusion (Supplementary Appendix). 
The saphenous-vein graft group was used as the reference in all analyses. All P values are two-
sided. P values <0.05 were considered significant, without correction for multiple testing. 
Statistical analyses were performed using R 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria).

Study selection 
From 612 titles, 38 pertinent studies were included for full-text review. After review, 32 studies 
were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of six randomized trials 
were selected for the present analysis6–11 including a total of 1305 patients with 5266 patient-years 
of follow-up. Further details and the PRISMA flowchart and checklist are shown in Supplementary 
Appendix Figure S1 and Table S1. An overview of the included studies is reported in Table 1. The 
principal investigators of the six individual studies were contacted and all agreed to provide 
individual patient data. The principal investigators of the Stand-in-Y trial also provided updated 
follow-up data. 
 
Some of the individual trials had important study design issues that were addressed before pooling 
the data. The Stand-in-Y trial compared saphenous-vein grafts with either radial-artery grafts or 
right internal-thoracic-artery grafts in different arms of the trial.7 The Radial Artery Patency and 
Clinical Outcomes (RAPCO) trial consisted of two separate trials, one of radial-artery grafts versus 
right internal-thoracic-artery grafts and one of radial-artery grafts versus saphenous-vein grafts.9 
For the present analysis, only patients included in the radial-artery graft vs. saphenous-vein graft 
comparison from Stand-in-Y and RAPCO were included. The trial of Petrovic et al. had no per-
protocol angiography and patients underwent repeat angiography only for clinical indications.10 
The angiographic results of this trial were therefore not used for the analyses of graft occlusion. 
In the Radial Artery Patency Study (RAPS), each patient received both a radial-artery graft and a 
  
 
 
9 
saphenous-vein graft, and randomization was performed for the target coronary territory (within-
patient randomization).11 Due to the difficulty of attributing clinical events to the radial-artery graft 
or the saphenous-vein graft for any given patient, this study was used only for the sensitivity 
analysis of graft occlusion (Supplementary Appendix). 
 
Meta-analysis  
Overall, 534 and 502 patients receiving radial-artery grafts and saphenous-vein grafts, 
respectively, were compared for clinical outcomes. Baseline characteristics for these patients are 
summarized in Table 2. Age, sex, diabetes prevalence, severe left ventricular dysfunction (left 
ventricular ejection fraction <35%) and renal insufficiency were comparable between the two 
groups. Endoscopic harvesting of either the saphenous vein or the radial artery was not used in 
any study. The total number of grafts performed was similar in the radial-artery graft and the 
saphenous-vein graft groups. The target vessel was the left circumflex coronary artery and the 
right coronary artery in about 75% and 25% of cases respectively. 
 
The main study outcomes are reported in Table 3. The mean follow-up time was 60±30 months 
(median 60; 1st-3rd quartile 39-83; range 0-146). There was a significant reduction in the incidence 
of the composite primary end point of death, myocardial infarction or repeat revascularization in 
the radial-artery graft group compared with the saphenous-vein graft group (25 vs 39 events per 
1000 patient-years; HR=0.67 [95% CI 0.49-0.90], P=0.01; Figure 1 Panel A). Radial-artery grafts 
  
 
 
10 
were associated with a nominally lower incidence of myocardial infarction (6 vs 9 per 1000 patient-
years; HR=0.72 [95% CI 0.53-0.99], P=0.04) and a lower incidence of repeat revascularization (9 vs 
17 per 1000 patient-years; HR=0.50 [95% CI 0.40-0.63], P<0.001) but not of all-cause death (15 vs 
17 per 1000 patient-years; HR=0.90 [95% CI 0.59-1.41], P=0.68; Supplementary Appendix Figure 
S2). 
 
Protocol-defined follow-up angiography was performed in 345 of 434 (79%) patients in the radial-
artery graft group and in 307 of 402 (76%) patients in the saphenous-vein graft group. A 
comparison of baseline characteristics for patients with and without follow-up angiographic data 
is presented in Supplementary Appendix Table S2. The mean follow-up time to protocol 
angiography was 50±30 months (median 51; 1st-3rd quartile 29-68; range 1-143 months). The 
incidence rates for graft occlusion were 19 vs 46 events per 1000 patient-year in the radial-artery 
graft and the saphenous-vein graft groups, respectively; radial-artery grafts were associated with 
a significantly lower risk of occlusion (HR=0.44 [95% CI 0.28-0.70], P<0.001; Figure 1 Panel B).  
 
The results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main analysis (Supplementary 
Appendix, Figures S3, S4 and S5, and Table S3). A funnel plot of the included trials, shown in 
Supplementary Appendix Figure S6, did not suggest evidence of publication bias (P=0.32). No 
significant difference in perioperative stroke was found between the two groups (radial-artery 
grafts 0.7% vs saphenous-vein grafts 1.4%, odds ratio=0.71 [95% CI 0.23-2.11], P=0.53). 
  
 
 
11 
 
Subgroup analyses  
A nominally significant interaction between age and treatment effect on major adverse cardiac 
events was found (P=0.04), and an age of 75 was identified as the cut-off for the loss of benefit 
from the radial artery. Interaction term analysis (Figure 2) showed a larger reduction in major 
adverse cardiac events with radial-artery grafts compared to saphenous-vein grafts in patients 
younger than 75 (P=0.008), in females (P=0.01) and, nominally, in those without renal insufficiency 
(P=0.02). Diabetes (P=0.35), left ventricular ejection fraction <35% (P=0.37) and prior myocardial 
infarction (P=0.45) did not modify the treatment effect. The radial-artery graft target vessel did 
not significantly influence the treatment effect (P=0.42).  
 
The risk factors for occlusion of radial-artery grafts and saphenous-vein grafts are reported in 
Supplementary Appendix Table S4. Age was found to be an independent predictor of radial-artery- 
but not saphenous-vein-graft occlusion. Female sex was found to be associated with a lower risk 
of radial-artery-graft occlusion and higher risk of saphenous-vein-graft occlusion. The use of 
chronic calcium channel antagonist therapy was found to be associated with a nominally 
significant lower risk of radial-artery-graft occlusion (details of the agents used to prevent arterial-
graft spasm are given in Supplementary Appendix Table S5).

Discussion
Discussion 
In this patient-level meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the radial artery and 
the saphenous vein as a second conduit for CABG, the use of radial-artery grafts was associated 
with a significantly lower risk of the composite of death, myocardial infarction or repeat 
revascularization and of the individual risk of myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization at 
a mean follow-up of 5 years. The use of radial-artery grafts was also associated with superior 
angiographic patency rates at protocol-defined angiography, which offers a biologically 
mechanistic explanation of the observed improvement in clinical outcomes.  
 
The clinical benefit associated with the use of radial-artery grafts seemed more evident in patients 
younger than 75 years, in females and in those without renal insufficiency. The radial-artery graft 
target vessel was not found to be a significant effect modifier. As the attrition rate of saphenous-
vein grafts but not of radial-artery grafts increases almost exponentially with time,12 it is as yet 
unknown if the clinical difference in outcome apparent between the groups at 5 years could 
increase with a longer follow-up period. 
 
The use of multiple arterial grafts is recommended by current guidelines and professional 
societies’ position papers predominantly on the basis of large observational studies that have 
reported improved patient outcomes after CABG.13–15 Despite these recommendations, arterial 
grafts have not been widely adopted; in the United States currently fewer than 10% of elective 
  
 
 
13 
CABG patients receive more than one arterial graft and in less than 7% a radial-artery graft is used.1 
One of the reasons for their low use is that the superior clinical outcomes with multiple arterial 
grafts reported in registries have not been replicated in the randomized controlled trials. Concerns 
exist that observational studies can be biased in favor of arterial conduits by unmatched 
confounders based on the unmeasurable (and unmatchable) judgment of the operating 
surgeons.16 None of the randomized controlled trials which compared radial-artery grafts with 
saphenous-vein grafts have individually found a difference in clinical outcome.6–11 The present 
patient-level meta-analysis aimed to overcome limitations from individual studies by pooling those 
trials.  
 
Our analysis also revealed that superior patency of radial-artery grafts did not translate into a 
significant difference in survival at 5 years. The traditional concept of a direct relationship between 
coronary graft patency and survival is both intuitive and biologically plausible and is indirectly 
supported by studies demonstrating better survival for patients receiving a conduit with higher 
long-term patency when placed to the left anterior descending coronary artery.17,18 However, 
while there is clear evidence that failure of grafts to the left anterior descending artery adversely 
affects survival, failure of grafts to other target vessels is more likely to result in non-fatal cardiac 
events.19,20 
 
The present analysis has several limitations. Even using a meta-analytic approach, the overall 
number of patients is relatively small for a procedure as common as CABG. Also, patients enrolled 
  
 
 
14 
in the six trials were highly selected. These aspects clearly limit the external validity of our work. 
The different trials used various surgical techniques, harvesting protocols and postoperative 
secondary prevention regimens. Also, different trials used various methods to evaluate the 
morbidity related to radial-artery harvesting and a pooled analysis of data for this outcome was 
not possible. However, in all the individual studies radial-artery harvesting was associated with 
only minor clinical symptoms and no overt hand complications.  
 
There are also several limitations of the patency analysis in our study. In the main analysis, 
protocol-directed angiography was performed in only about three-quarters of trial participants, 
and the patients with and without follow-up angiography differed in clinical characteristics and 
risk. Also, two trials accounted for more than two thirds of all the angiographic data. However, we 
found no heterogeneity across included trials. The use of protocol-directed angiography renders 
the estimation of graft occlusion according to clinically directed angiography difficult. Finally, the 
estimates of repeat revascularization rates in angiographic trials may be inflated compared to 
results in clinical outcome studies, as repeat revascularization may be driven based on the 
angiographic rather than clinical findings.  
 
In summary, in a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing radial-artery grafts 
versus saphenous-vein grafts as the second conduit for CABG, the use of radial-artery grafts 
resulted in a significantly lower rate of major adverse cardiac events and a better patency rate at 
a postoperative follow-up of 5 years.
