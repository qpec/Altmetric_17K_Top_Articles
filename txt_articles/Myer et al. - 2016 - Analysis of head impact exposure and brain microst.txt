ABSTRACT
Background Historical approaches to protect the brain
from outside the skull (eg, helmets and mouthpieces)
have been ineffective in reducing internal injury to the
brain that arises from energy absorption during sports-
related collisions. We aimed to evaluate the effects of a
neck collar, which applies gentle bilateral jugular vein
compression, resulting in cerebral venous engorgement
to reduce head impact energy absorption during
collision. Specifically, we investigated the effect of collar
wearing during head impact exposure on brain
microstructure integrity following a competitive high
school American football season.
Methods A prospective longitudinal controlled trial was
employed to evaluate the effects of collar wearing (n=32)
relative to controls (CTRL; n=30) during one competitive
football season (age: 17.04±0.67 years). Impact exposure
was collected using helmet sensors and white matter
(WM) integrity was quantified based on diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) serving as the primary outcome.
Results With similar overall g-forces and total head
impact exposure experienced in the two study groups
during the season (p>0.05), significant preseason to
postseason changes in mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity
and radial diffusivity in the WM integrity were noted in
the CTRL group (corrected p<0.05) but not in the collar
group (p>0.05). The CTRL group demonstrated
significantly larger preseason to postseason DTI change
in multiple WM regions compared with the collar group
(corrected p<0.05).
Discussion Reduced WM diffusivity alteration was
noted in participants wearing a neck collar after a
season of competitive football. Collar wearing may have
provided a protective effect against brain microstructural
changes after repetitive head impacts.

INTRODUCTION
Sports-related
traumatic
brain
injury
(TBI)
is
common in competitive sports and recreational
activities, with 1.6–3.8 million cases reported annu-
ally in the USA.1 Children, adolescents and young
adults are at the highest risk for sustaining mild
TBI (mTBI).2 A recent review of personal protect-
ive equipment concluded that, while some items
might confer a preventative effect from superficial
head injury, they all failed to significantly prevent
sports-related TBI in athletes.3 In American football
specifically,
prospective
studies
of
mouthguards
(both specialised and custom-fitted models) indicate
that they may have minimal, if any, effect on sports-
related TBI incidence.4–8 There is also limited high-
level prospective, objective evidence indicating that
any recent helmet design can prevent sports-related
TBI. Helmets were developed for, and are effective
in, preventing skull fractures and intracranial hema-
tomas—9they do not however protect the brain
inside the cranium. This lack of measureable pro-
tection may be due to the limited ability of helmets
to minimise the collision of the brain against the
inside of the skull (ie, slosh) and from differential
acceleration between the skull and its contents.10
W
e evaluated physiological-based slosh mitiga-
tion (ie, reduced movement of fluids within moving
containers) with increased elevation found to be
associated with reduced sports-related TBI rates at
higher altitudes.11 12 W
e postulated that acclima-
tisation
to
altitude
may
have
influenced
an
increased intracranial blood volume, resulting in a
tighter fit of the brain within the cranium. The pro-
posed physiological response to decreased relative
ambient oxygen (thus increasing intracranial flow
and volume) was speculated to have protected the
athletes at higher elevations against sports-related
TBI.11 12
W
e also investigated mechanical-based slosh miti-
gation, in the form of a jugular vein compression
collar fashioned off of the diagnostic Queckenstedt
manoeuvre.13 This approach demonstrated an 83%
reduction in amyloid precursor protein-positive
axons—a widely accepted biomarker of TBI—
during a 900 g impact protocol studied in animals.14
Further, an associated preclinical TBI model, which
also used the same impact protocol, demonstrated a
>45% reduction in degenerative neurons, reactive
astrocytes and microglial activation with the applica-
tion of jugular vein impedance.15 The proposed
mechanism of protection was achieved via the mech-
anical impedance of the internal jugular vein (IJV)
which is proposed to result in increased cerebral
venous sinus engorgement to promote a ‘tighter fit’
of the brain inside the cranium.14 15
Drawing from these studies, a lightweight neck
collaring compressive device was developed for
humans (figure 1). Much like the effect of collar in

 animal experiment, jugular vein compression in humans results
in increased volume of the venous capacitance vessels of the
cranium.16 Filling the compensatory reserve volume17 of the
brain and spinal column appears to increase brain stiffness
during jugular compression, as assessed by magnetic resonance
elastography.18
Based
on
prior
physiological
models,
we
hypothesised that this would create a cradling effect to increase
the brain’s resistance to movement or inertia, (ie, slosh mitiga-
tion of the brain inside the skull), potentially protecting the
brain from external head impacts.11 A preliminary prospective
longitudinal investigation showed that alterations in white
matter (WM) microstructure and electrophysiological measures
were ameliorated by application of jugular compression during
head impact exposure in hockey.19 Therefore, the purpose of
the current investigation was to examine the effects of a jugular
vein compression collar worn during a competitive American
football season to determine the potential effect on neuroima-
ging biomarkers associated with brain injury. Changes in brain
diffusivity (a measure of WM brain injury20 that has been
reported in neuroimaging studies of sports-related TBI)21 were
evaluated in relation to the cumulative effects of repetitive head
impacts accrued throughout the season.22
METHOD
Study participants
The Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Institutional
Review Board (IRB) approved the data collection procedures
and consent forms. The IRB approval number is IRB #
2015-2205 (ClinicalTrials.gov #: NCT02696200). Sixty-two
healthy male varsity high school football players were enrolled
from Southwest Ohio, USA. Parents, guardians and athletes pro-
vided informed consent prior to participation in the study.
Primary exclusion criteria included history of neurological defi-
cits, previous cerebral infarction, previous severe head trauma,
known increased intracranial pressure, metabolic acidosis or
alkalosis, glaucoma (narrow angle or normal tension), hydro-
cephalus, penetrating brain trauma (within 6 months), known
carotid hypersensitivity, central vein thrombosis, known airway
obstruction or seizure disorder. T
eams were assigned to either
the collar group or the control (CTRL) group prior to the start
of the season. Of the 62 participants enrolled, 1 participant had
contraindications for MRI (dental braces); 1 athlete had test
anxiety with MR testing; 2 participants did not complete all
testing due to medical issues that arose during the season unre-
lated to football participation; and 2 participants suffered a
season-ending injury. T
welve participants had unusable MRI
data on either preseason or postseason testing due to motion
artefact during the scan and were excluded from all imaging
analysis leaving 42 (21 collar and 21 CTRL) study participants
(age 17.13±0.66 years; figure 2). In addition, one athlete in the
collar group did not have accelerometer covariate information
and, therefore, was not included in the correlation analysis. No
significant difference was found between the athletes excluded
for imaging reason and those who remained for analysis in age
and all the impact-related variables (number of hits, cumulative

hits, and g-force >20, 50, 100 or 150 g).
Instrumentation and procedures
T
esting was completed at preseason and postseason. Each testing
session consisted of a preimaging screening questionnaire to
assess for safety of brain MRI. Preseason (baseline) testing took
place prior to the start of the first practice, while postseason
testing took place after the completion of competitive play
(including postseason play, when applicable). The average time
between testing was 129.7±14.9 days (range 95–154 days).
During the study period, 60 practices, 10 regular season games
and 2 playoff games for the collar group and 50 practices, 10
regular season games and no playoff games for the CTRL group
were completed. The postseason imaging data were acquired at
7.05±4.61 and 5.83±6.70 days (p=0.50) after the last com-
petitive event in the CTRL group and the collar group, respect-
ively (figure 2).
MRI data acquisition
All MRI data were acquired on the same 3 T Philips Achieva
MRI scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands)
using a 32-channel head coil. The diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) data were acquired with a spin echo-planar imaging
sequence with the following specifications: repetition time/echo
time (TR/TE)=9000/83 ms; field of view (FOV)=256×256 mm;
matrix=128×128;
in-plane
resolution=2×2 mm;
slice
thickness=2 mm; 72 slices. Diffusion-weighted images were
acquired along 61 non-collinear directions with 7 non-diffusion-
weighted images (b0=1000 s/mm2). A high-resolution, three-
dimensional (3D) T1-weighted anatomical dataset was acquired
in the sagittal direction with the following specifications: TR/
TE=8.1/3.7 ms; TI=1070 ms; FOV=256×256 mm; matrix=
256×256; in-plane resolution=1×1 mm; slice thickness=1 mm;
180 slices. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) was also per-
formed (venous blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD), TR/
TE=14.7/20.7 ms,
FOV=220×220 mm,
flip
angle=10°,
matrix=220×221, slice thickness=2 mm). One board-certified
neuroradiologist ( JLL), blinded to treatment group assignment,
evaluated all anatomical images (3D T1-weighted and SWI
images). Clinically significant findings were reported to the study
investigators, participants and parents as per study protocol. On
subjective
evaluation
of
any
of
the
anatomical
images
(T1-weighted and SWI images), there were no traumatic abnor-
malities identified. There were no changes between the preseason
and postseason anatomical images in any participant, and there
was no evidence of any intracranial complication (eg, brain
haemorrhage or lesion) from collar use.
DTI data were processed with the Functional MRI of the
Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) software package (http://
www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). In FSL, skull stripping was performed
using the brain extraction tool (BET) function. Eddy current
and head motion artefact were corrected in FSL by aligning
diffusion-weighted images to the first b0 image with an affine
transformation with 12 degrees of freedom. The following four
commonly used DTI measures were calculated using standard
methods: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD),
axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD).23 The tract-
based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach was used in the image
analysis in the present study.24 This is a method developed to
ameliorate the registration error at the boundary of narrow WM
fibre bundles, a common source of error in voxel-based style
analysis. Studies have shown that TBSS can effectively reduce
the granularity and improve accuracy during normalisation. W
e
followed standard TBSS analysis steps that have been sum-
marised in many previous studies.25–27 A skeleton threshold of
0.2 was used in the present study.
Neck ultrasound evaluation and collar fitting
The neck collar device was made up of the following: an outer
collar that consists of a thermoplastic elastomer (durometer 80
Shore A), an inner collar that consists of a thermoplastic elasto-
mer (durometer 50 Shore A) and a stainless memory steel com-
posite insert. Figure 1 shows the positioning of a collar
compressing the jugular vein. The collar size for each individual
was determined from the measured neck circumference, vali-
dated via spacing of the collar tips (1.25–2.500) and from visual
evidence of ultrasound IJV dilation. At the initial fitting of the
collar, a registered vascular technologist ( JA) used ultrasound to
ensure that the proper collar and IJV responses (eg, visual evi-
dence of IJV dilation superior to collar) occurred as prescribed
(figure 3).
A single sonographer performed all ultrasonography proce-
dures and measurements, and the images and video clips were
acquired using a LOGIQ e-unit (General Electric Inc, Fairfield,
Connecticut, USA) with an ultrahigh frequency L8-18i-RS linear
transducer. The study participants sat upright, facing forward
during testing. IJV was identified in the transverse plane to verify
normal anatomy. Each athlete was scanned for baseline, Valsalva
(ie, bearing down against a closed glottis) and with the assigned
collar on/off/on in sequence. A collar was then placed in proper
position around the participant’s neck. A 15 s video clip of the
collar in proper position, opening away from the neck, and
returning to its proper position, was obtained. The IJV metrics
were measured at their largest transverse dimensions upon initial
placement of the collar, when the collar pressure was removed,
and again after replacing the collar back on the neck.
Head impact surveillance
Head impact was recorded using the GForce Tracker (GFT;
GForce Tracker, Markham, Ontario, Canada) accelerometer
device affixed to the inside of each football helmet. The acceler-
ometers recorded linear acceleration and rotational velocity of
the head (ie, 6 degrees of freedom) by directly measuring three
axes of linear acceleration and three axes of angular acceler-
ation. Prior to the initial exposure (ie, first practice), each accel-
erometer was calibrated according to device specifications and
relative to the placement of the sensor in each helmet. Prior

 evaluation of GForce Tracker accelerometers indicates that they
provide a suitable impact-monitoring device across multiple
helmet styles with coefficients of determination reported at
r2=0.82 for peak linear acceleration.28 The accelerometers were
programmed to record data above 10 g, but only accelerations
above 20 g threshold were used in the current investigation.
Acceleration data were collected at 3000 Hz. A more detailed
description of accelerometer methods can be found in the
online supplementary appendix 1.
Compliance of collar use
Following the initial fitting, each athlete in the collar group
received daily instruction on the proper usage of the collar. The
collar usage was monitored by a study coordinator during
routine visits, and recorded by the medical training staff in a
daily log via custom software that tracked protocol compliance,
attendance and any injury that occurred. These compliance logs
were cross-referenced with accelerometer data daily to ensure
data integrity for reported athlete exposures and collar compli-
ance. Overall, the collar study participants (included in the
reported per-protocol analysis) demonstrated 95.7% daily com-
pliance (days of wear during impact practice or competition/
days possible) to collar usage as prescribed by the study proto-
col. It should be noted that the daily compliance collar usage
was only 90.6% when evaluated by the intention-to-treat (ITT)
methodology (see detailed results of ITT in the online supple-
mentary appendix 1).
Statistical analysis
In the analysis of jugular vein dilation, a 4×2 repeated-measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed to examine the per
cent change difference in the dilation that occurred superior to
the collar on the right and left sides for four different pairs of
time points: (1) baseline to Valsalva, (2) baseline to collar on
(time 1), (3) baseline to collar off and (4) baseline to collar on
(time 2). The Bonferroni correction was used to correct for mul-
tiple follow-up tests.
The data indexing the total number of impacts were subjected
to a Box-Cox natural log (Ln) transformation to alleviate
extreme positive skewness observed in the data,29 while the
total experienced g-forces were subjected to a simple Ln trans-
formation due to moderate positive skewness. Separate inde-
pendent t-tests were then conducted to compare the collar and
CTRL groups for total number of impacts with various g-force
cut-offs
(>20,
>50,
>100 g),
total
g-forces
experienced
(>20 g) and g-force per impact (>20 g). The frequency of
impacts >150 and >200 g-force cut-off was too infrequent to
conduct inferential analyses. All reported mean and SDs are the
actual, non-transformed values.
In the neuroimaging analysis, the DTI measures (FA, RD, AD
and MD) at a given voxel were first compared for group differ-
ences at baseline using an independent t-test. This was followed
by a within-group, longitudinal change analysis between the two
time points. For each participant, a difference map between the
two time points was calculated for each DTI measure and used
in a one-sample t-test to assess the longitudinal change for each
group. Next, independent t-tests were used to determine
whether the interaction between group and time was different
by comparing the longitudinal change between the two groups.
In each analysis step, the randomised function from FSL was
used to generate a null distribution for comparison of the result-
ing t-test statistic for statistical significance. Permutations of
5000 and 2000 were used in each one-sample t-test and inde-
pendent t-test, respectively. A multiple-comparison correction
was achieved through the threshold-free cluster enhancement
method30 incorporated into the randomised software in FSL.
W
e tested several variables, including time between last practice/
game to postseason MRI, the total number of impacts, the total
g-force and the average g-force per impact, as covariates in the
voxel-wise analysis of group differences of longitudinal DTI
change. Each of these factors was initially tested individually for
its
potential
confounding
effect.
W
e
also
tested
the
impact-related variables at several different g-force cut-off
levels: >20, >50 and >100g as potential confounders. Our
initial testing showed that none of these potential confounding
variables had a significant effect in changing the contrast
between the two groups in their preseason versus postseason
DTI difference. Therefore, the final analyses of group differ-
ences presented in this study were conducted without including
any of these variables. Based on the results from the WM areas
with significant group differences of longitudinal change, we
further explored whether the DTI change within these seem-
ingly more vulnerable areas was associated with impact within
the CTRL group. Before the correlation analysis was performed,
the anatomical locations of the WM structures with significant
group differences were determined by comparing with the John
Hopkins University ICBM-DTI-81 WM labels atlas.31 32 For
each of the areas, the longitudinal change of DTI values was
extracted for each participant in the CTRL group. A Pearson
correlation analysis was performed between the change in DTI
and each of the three impact-related variables.
Initially, all participants were assigned to either the collar or
CTRL group (with 19 athletes in the CTRL group and 25 ath-
letes in the collar group). However, two of the participants
assigned to the treatment (collar) group refused to comply from
the outset, and two were partially compliant with collar use
during the competitive season. Therefore, all the neuroimaging
analyses reported in the present study were performed based on
the per-protocol design. This involved 21 athletes from the
CTRL group and 21 athletes from the collar group. W
e also
conducted analyses based on the ITT principle using the original
allocation regardless of compliance status. As expected, similar
but reduced effects were observed when the ITT analyses were
used. The ITT analyses and results are described briefly below
with the details included in the online supplementary appendix
1 for comparison.
RESULTS
Responsiveness to collar
Ultrasound evaluation confirmed that jugular vein size increased
significantly above the level of the collar following collar place-
ment, implying a backfill into the venous capacitance vessels of
the cranium. While significant, the magnitude of change was
less than that related to a quotidian physiologic Valsalva man-
oeuvre. A significant effect of time was indicated, independent

side,
F(3,48)=12.88,

(figure

Follow-up comparisons revealed that the per cent change for
time point pair 1 (baseline to Valsalva) was significantly greater
than all other time points (p<0.02). Time points 2 (baseline to
collar on, time 1) and 4 (baseline to collar on, time 2) did not
differ from each other, but both were significantly greater than
time point 3 (baseline to collar off; p<0.006).
Head impact surveillance
There were no significant differences between the collar group
and the CTRL group for any head impact measures (all
p>0.05; table 1). As presented in figure 5, the distribution of
number of impacts at different g-force indices was similar

 between the two study groups (figure 6A, B). Table 1 presents
descriptive values relative to each impact variable.
Cross-sectional comparison of preseason DTI metrics
between the CTRL group and the collar group
At preseason, no significant differences were found in any of the
four DTI measures in any WM region between the two groups.
Longitudinal change and group difference in preseason to
postseason DTI metrics
Significant preseason to postseason decreases in MD, AD and
RD (corrected p<0.05) were found in extensive WM areas in
the CTRL group (details below). No statistically significant pre-
season to postseason FA change was found in the CTRL group.
No statistically significant longitudinal changes were found in
any DTI measure in any WM region in the collar group
(p>0.05).
Derived from the above within-group analyses, there is a con-
sistent reduction of the diffusivity measures in the CTRL group,
while the direction of change is more variable in the collar group
(figure 7). For example, at an individual level, all 21 athletes in
the CTRL group exhibited decreases in AD (percentage of reduc-
tion=2.43±1.02%; figure 8A). Within the same areas, 11 out of
the 21 athletes in the collar group exhibited decreases in AD
(0.95±0.77%), 8 out of the 21 athletes exhibited increases in AD
(1.22±0.68%) and 2 did not exhibit any change, with an overall
average reduction of AD at the level of 0.03±1.27% or absolute
change of AD (0.96±0.67%; figure 8B).
Between-group analysis showed significantly larger preseason
to postseason DTI changes in the CTRL group within the
corpus callosum, the internal and external capsule, and a series
of other WM regions (figure 9; corrected p<0.05, see table 2
for location and volume of specific WM regions involved based
on the AD measurement) when compared with the collar group
(figure 10).
Correlation between preseason to postseason DTI change in
the no-collar (CTRL) group and head impacts
Among the WM regions with significant group difference of
AD, the superior longitudinal fasciculus in the CTRL group was
found to present significant correlation between the preseason
and postseason decreases in diffusivity and impact burden. As
shown in table 3, the AD reduction in the superior longitudinal
fasciculus in the CTRL group was significantly correlated with
the number of hits and cumulative g-force (all hits or hits
≥20 g) and marginally correlated with number of hits at the
≥50 g threshold. The MD reduction in superior longitudinal
fasciculus in the CTRL group was mildly correlated with the
number of hits and cumulative g-force (all hits or cut-off
>20 g). In addition, we also found that the change of FA in pos-
terior thalamic radiation was significantly correlated with the
number of hits and with cumulative g-force (all hits or cut-off
>20 g). No other WM region was found to have significant cor-
relation between change in DTI measures and impact measures.
Neuroimaging findings based on ITT protocol
The results based on the ITT protocol are similar to the above-
reported findings based on the per-protocol design. Briefly,
based on the ITT design, we found significant preseason to post-
season reduction in MD, AD and RD in the CTRL group but

 not in the collar group (see online supplementary figure S2).
The group difference of preseason to postseason reduction in
MD, AD and RD remained statistically significant after using the
collar group as the CTRL (see online supplementary figure S4).
The WM regions with significant group difference of longitu-
dinal diffusivity change were similar to the findings based on
the per-protocol design (see online supplementary table S1).
In the correlation analysis, the superior longitudinal fasciculus
was found to present significant correlation between the AD
reduction and the total number of hits. It should be noted that
the number of WM regions with significant group difference
and the number of WM regions with significant correlations in
the ITT analysis were both smaller than that in the per-protocol
design. This difference may be attributed to the lower compli-
ance in the ITT design (90.6% for ITT vs 95.7% for per proto-
col as reported in Method-Compliance of collar use). The
ITT analysis which included two non-compliant athletes and the
two partially compliant in the collar group weakened the
homogeneity of the group analysis and, as expected, led to
less significant findings. When compared to the formally pre-
sented per-protocol design, these data provide further support
that the effect of collar wear to reduce changes in DTI was a
valid outcome.
DISCUSSION
W
e examined the effect of a bilateral jugular vein compression
collar
device
on
the
mitigation
of
brain
microstructure
changes as assessed by WM integrity in response to a season-
long head impact exposure. The collar is a novel approach
for the potential internal protection of the brain against
repetitive head impact. As hypothesised, the wearing of the
device was effective to prevent diffusion changes after a full
season of repetitive head impacts in high school football ath-
letes. Specifically, the CTRL group showed consistent and stat-
istically
significant
reduction
in
diffusion
coefficients—a
change that has been reported frequently in mTBI33–37 and
sports-related
TBI22
38–44
literature—contrasting
with
the
absence of change in the football players who wore the
collar. Combined with the association found between the
decrease of diffusivity in the CTRL group and their impact
burden, our study has generated initial evidence for a poten-
tial protective effect of the collar device. It supports the
notion that the approach of protecting the brain internally via
jugular vein compression may be a promising alternative, or
at least a complementary tool, that helps to prevent and miti-
gate potential injury from repetitive head impact in competi-
tive contact sports.

 Brain slosh and increased intracranial blood volume
Slosh mechanisms have been primarily studied in their relation to
fluid-filled containers.15 When an impact is sustained to a con-
tainer filled with fluids (by extrapolation of the skull and brain),
maximising volume within the container (ie, by reducing compli-
ance of the venous sinuses and maximising intracranial blood
and brain volume) reduces energy absorption.14 15 It is likely that
only a very small amount of intracranial blood volume change is
necessary for this effect to occur. Accordingly, previous work has
demonstrated that cerebral volume needs to rise only by 3–4 mL
before concomitant pressure increases occur.45 Since the cerebral
blood space is ∼150 mL, we speculate that a 3% rise in intracra-
nial volume will take up excess compliance and may provide pro-
tection from shear stress, cavitation and impact on the interior
cranium.11 12 The degree of venous dilatation documented in
this study with neck collar placement would not be expected to
be dangerous and is likely less than the normal physiologic range
noted with sneeze, cough and the Valsalva manoeuvre (ie, forced
exhale against closed glottis; figures 3 and 4).
Objectifying brain injury biomarkers in response to head
impacts
In contrast to the relatively subjective end point of concussion,
DTI has been used as an objective imaging biomarker in quantify-
ing WM structural changes in patients with mTBI and collision
sport athletes during acute, semiacute and chronic stages
after discrete head trauma or a season of repetitive head
impacts.22 38–44 WM integrity changes based on DTI have been
correlated
with
postconcussive
symptoms
and
cumulative
risk-weighted exposure.40 Prior analyses of DTI in mTBI and
sports-related TBI have shown changes of varying severity and
direction, including abnormally lower FA and/or higher diffusiv-
ity (MD, AD, RD) in patients, concussed athletes, athletes with a
history of concussion,25 27 43 46 or decreased FA and/or increased
diffusivity measures in athletes when tested for preseason to post-
season changes.39 42 47 48 However, other studies have shown
changes in the opposite direction (ie, higher FA and/or lower dif-
fusivity for MD, AD and RD) in acute mTBI33–37 and in collision
sport
athletes
with
either
concussive
or
subconcussive

 impacts.22
38–44 The inconsistency of these findings may be
explained by the differences in timing of imaging, as well as
differing severity and chronicity of brain injury.
In general, lower FA and higher MD, AD and/or RD are often
interpreted as damage to the myelin sheath and axonal mem-
brane. Conversely, higher FA and lower MD, AD and/or RD are
often attributed to extracellular space compression, cytotoxic
oedema (axonal swelling) or inflammation.49 50 In the present
study, no significant change in FA was noted: the primary findings
were significant decreases in WM diffusivity at postseason in the
CTRL group. The areas affected included the corpus callosum,
anterior and posterior internal capsule, corona radiata, posterior
thalamic radiation, external capsule, cingulum and superior lon-
gitudinal fasciculus, which are consistent with previous studies of
TBI and head impacts.22 25 27 33–44 46–50 Previously, a prospective
randomised controlled trial was performed in hockey players to
evaluate the effects of external jugular compression applied
during head impact exposure on longitudinal changes in brain
neuroanatomical and neurophysiological biomarkers.19 Similar
to the current results, athletes not wearing the collar and exposed
to head impacts showed a disruption of WM microstructure,
including mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity. Hockey players
who wore the compressive collar did not show a significant
change in either MD or RD despite similar accumulated linear
accelerations from head impacts. In addition to these anatomical
findings, electrophysiological network analysis demonstrated
concomitant changes in brain network dynamics in the no-collar

 (CTRL) group only. Interestingly, the changes in DTI outcome
(RD) were directly correlated with altered brain network dynam-
ics (r=0.76) in this cohort.19
Repetitive, subconcussive brain injury may result in a mix of
acute, subacute and chronic cellular changes over a season of
contact sports that can produce complex changes in the brain’s
water diffusion.20 Assessing DTI metrics at a single time point
evaluates the cumulative effects of brain injury and repair
present at that time point.22 The findings in the present study
lend support to this notion. Specifically, in a longitudinal study
of DTI changes in response to repetitive subconcussive impacts
over a season, postseason imaging should be considered as a
reflection of the changes in brain microstructure that resulted
from repetitive subconcussive hits accumulated over the entire
season.
Head impact exposure in American football
In the present study, the number of sessions in which impacts
were recorded was slightly higher for the collar group than was
reported in the CTRL group (72 vs 60). Other studies of
football-related impacts have evaluated seasons of similar dur-
ation (60–68 practices and games).51 The average g-force per
impact reported over the course of the season in the present
study (36.6–37.7 g) was higher than has been reported in
most prior studies of contact sports (ranging from 20.9 to
32.0 g),51–56 which may be attributed to the higher threshold
for recording valid impacts in the current study (>20 g) than
the other reports (>10–15 g).51–56 The number of average hits
per player reported in the current investigation (ranging from
794 to 901) was also higher than has been reported in most pre-
vious reports as well.51–56 For example, Broglio et al51 reported
an average of ∼549 impacts per player (>15 g) in a season and
an average of 774 impacts per player (>14.4 g) in the same
team in another season.52 Similarly, Schnebel et al57 reported an
average of 520 impacts per player (>10 g). Comparably, at the
Division I Football Bowl Subdivision collegiate level, the average
number of impacts per player over the course of a season has
varied widely, ranging from 171 to 1354.53–57 Our results
showed no significant effect of impact per player or any other
impact-related variable in any of the covariate analyses on the
potential collar effects on reduced change in DTI. The current
data are generalisable in relative head impact exposure (magni-
tude and quantity) to high school and collegiate football players
over a single season.
Limitations
In the present study, the similar impact exposure between the
two study groups strengthens the conclusion that the signifi-
cantly lower levels of DTI alterations in the collar group are
attributed to the intervention. However, despite best efforts for
control, the changes reported could be potentially explained by
other factors such as physiologic responses to other stresses in
addition to trauma, developmental changes of the immature
brain, genetics and/or other susceptibilities. The utilisation of a
controlled longitudinal study design can mitigate, but does not
eliminate, the risk of these potential confounding variables.
Regardless, the cumulative results of the current investigation
represent a substantive and important finding in the field of
sports injury prevention. The exact pathologic substrate and
clinical significance of the diffusion changes identified in this
study are unknown. The diffusion changes and locations identi-
fied in the CTRL group are consistent with those identified in
prior studies of severe TBI (sTBI), lending support to the
premise that they are traumatic in origin. In addition, the
current investigation was focused on the assessment of objective
biomarkers that are associated with brain injury, and the study
design was not appropriate to evaluate the subjective and often
nebulous outcome of clinically diagnosed concussion. The
authors acknowledge future large-scale epidemiological clinical
trials are needed to determine the potential of the investigated

 collar device for mitigating concussion incidence. Finally, future
research is warranted to understand and document the intracra-
nial effects of jugular venous compression, to assess for any
long-term effects of playing sport with jugular venous compres-
sion and presumably increased cerebral blood volume, as well as
to validate its mitigating effects on brain injury from head
impact exposure.
CONCLUSION
The current investigation tested a neck collar device that pro-
duces physiologic distension of the superior jugular veins to
encourage cerebral venous engorgement to ameliorate the
changes in brain microstructure associated with a season of
contact sport. These prospective longitudinal data using an
internal in vivo approach indicate that it may be possible to
protect the brain from ‘inside the skull’ from sports-related head
impacts.
What are the findings?
▸ Analyses of brain injury biomarkers and head impacts in
response to the season-long application of a jugular
compression collar indicate a consistent reduction in altered
white matter diffusivity parameters.
▸ These results represent prospective, longitudinal and
objective data demonstrating a potential approach to protect
the brain from changes sustained within a competitive
football season, as evidenced by brain microstructure
integrity.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ These prospective longitudinal data using an internal in vivo
approach indicate that it may be possible to protect the
brain from ‘inside the skull’ from sports-related head
impacts.
▸ The novelty of this device, as well as the tolerance and
general compliance, may help drive future efforts to prevent
sports-related brain injury.
