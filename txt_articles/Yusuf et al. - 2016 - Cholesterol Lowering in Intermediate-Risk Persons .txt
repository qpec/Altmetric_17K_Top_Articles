BACKGROUND
Previous trials have shown that the use of statins to lower cholesterol reduces the risk 
of cardiovascular events among persons without cardiovascular disease. Those trials 
have involved persons with elevated lipid levels or inflammatory markers and involved 
mainly white persons. It is unclear whether the benefits of statins can be extended to 
an intermediate-risk, ethnically diverse population without cardiovascular disease.
METHODS
In one comparison from a 2-by-2 factorial trial, we randomly assigned 12,705 partici-
pants in 21 countries who did not have cardiovascular disease and were at intermedi-
ate risk to receive rosuvastatin at a dose of 10 mg per day or placebo. The first 
coprimary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal 
myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, and the second coprimary outcome addi-
tionally included revascularization, heart failure, and resuscitated cardiac arrest. The 
median follow-up was 5.6 years.
RESULTS
The overall mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was 26.5% lower in the 
rosuvastatin group than in the placebo group. The first coprimary outcome occurred 
in 235 participants (3.7%) in the rosuvastatin group and in 304 participants (4.8%) in 
the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.91; 
P 
= 
0.002). The results for the second coprimary outcome were consistent with the re-
sults for the first (occurring in 277 participants [4.4%] in the rosuvastatin group and 
in 363 participants [5.7%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.64 to 
0.88; P<0.001). The results were also consistent in subgroups defined according to 
cardiovascular risk at baseline, lipid level, C-reactive protein level, blood pressure, and 
race or ethnic group. In the rosuvastatin group, there was no excess of diabetes or 
cancers, but there was an excess of cataract surgery (in 3.8% of the participants, vs. 
3.1% in the placebo group; P 
= 
0.02) and muscle symptoms (in 5.8% of the participants, 
vs. 4.7% in the placebo group; P 
= 
0.005).
CONCLUSIONS
Treatment with rosuvastatin at a dose of 10 mg per day resulted in a significantly 
lower risk of cardiovascular events than placebo in an intermediate-risk, ethnically 
diverse population without cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes

ardiovascular diseases cause 18 
million deaths per year globally and a 
similar number of nonfatal cardiovascular 
events.1 Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol levels account for approximately half 
the population-attributable risk of myocardial 
infarction2 and approximately one quarter of the 
risk of ischemic stroke.3 In previous trials, lower-
ing LDL cholesterol levels with statins has been 
shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular dis-
eases, but most of the patients enrolled in those 
trials had vascular disease, elevated lipid levels, 
elevated inflammatory markers, hypertension, or 
diabetes.4,5 The association between LDL choles-
terol level and cardiovascular disease is graded 
and has no documented threshold.2,3 Yet the role 
of lowering LDL cholesterol levels with statins in 
the primary prevention of cardiovascular events 
among persons without cardiovascular disease, 
regardless of lipid levels, inflammatory markers, 
hypertension status, or diabetes status, has not 
been established.
Although 80% of the global burden of car-
diovascular disease occurs in low- and middle-
income countries, the majority of trials have been 
conducted in North America or Europe and in-
volve mainly white persons.4 The pattern of dys-
lipidemia can vary among different races or 
ethnic groups,6 and Asian persons are thought 
to be at higher risk for the adverse effects of 
statin use than are white persons.7 We therefore 
conducted the Heart Outcomes Prevention Eval-
uation (HOPE)–3 trial, which was a large trial 
evaluating the long-term effects of rosuvastatin 
at a dose of 10 mg per day (without dose adjust-
ment or lipid targets) among persons of various 
ethnic backgrounds on six continents who did 
not have cardiovascular disease and were at inter-
mediate risk.
Methods
Trial Design
We conducted this pragmatic, multicenter, long-
term, international, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial at 228 centers in 21 
countries. The trial had a 2-by-2 factorial design. 
The trial evaluated cholesterol lowering with 
rosuvastatin at a dose of 10 mg per day, blood-
pressure lowering with candesartan at a dose of 
16 mg per day plus hydrochlorothiazide at a 
dose of 12.5 mg per day, and the combination of 
both interventions for the prevention of cardio-
vascular events among persons who did not have 
cardiovascular disease and were at intermediate 
risk (defined as an annual risk of major cardio-
vascular events of approximately 1%)8 (Table S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The 
results of the analysis of blood-pressure lower-
ing and the analysis of the combination of blood-
pressure lowering and cholesterol lowering are 
reported in accompanying articles in the Jour-
nal.9,10 A detailed description of the trial methods 
is provided in the article that focuses on the ef-
fects of blood-pressure lowering.9
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed by the steering committee 
who, along with staff at the Population Health 
Research Institute, oversaw the conduct of the 
trial, the collection and analysis of the data, and 
the interpretation of the results. The first author 
along with three other authors from the Popula-
tion Health Research Institute had full access to 
the data and vouch for the accuracy of the data 
and analysis and for the fidelity of this report to 
the protocol. The first author drafted the manu-
script, and all the authors made the decision to 
submit the manuscript for publication. Funding 
was provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca provid-
ed the trial drug, served as a single voting mem-
ber on the 24-member steering committee, and 
had no other role in the trial. The trial was 
conducted after regulatory and ethical approvals 
were obtained for each participating site or from 
a central board that provided approval for multi-
ple sites. All participants provided written in-
formed consent.
Eligibility
The trial included men 55 years of age or older 
and women 65 years of age or older who had at 
least one of the following cardiovascular risk 
factors: elevated waist-to-hip ratio, history of a 
low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
current or recent tobacco use, dysglycemia, fam-
ily history of premature coronary disease, and 
mild renal dysfunction (details of the eligibility 
criteria are provided in Table S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). We also included women 
60 years of age or older who had at least two 
such risk factors. Participants with cardiovascular

disease and those with an indication for or contra-
indication to statins, angiotensin-receptor block-
ers, angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, 
or thiazide diuretics were excluded. The trial did 
not mandate specific lipid or blood-pressure 
levels for entry. Fasting lipid and glucose levels 
were measured to inform physicians about par-
ticipants’ risks, but trial eligibility was based on 
the uncertainty principle, which asserts that only 
persons with clear indications for or contraindi-
cations to trial drugs were excluded from partici-
pation, and those persons were identified on the 
basis of the clinical judgment of local physicians, 
usual practice, and guidelines.11
Trial Procedures
Eligible participants entered a single-blind run-in 
phase, during which they received active treat-
ments (both for blood-pressure lowering and for 
cholesterol lowering) for 4 weeks. Participants 
who adhered to the assigned regimen and who 
did not have an unacceptable level of adverse 
events were randomly assigned to receive a fixed 
combination of candesartan at a dose of 16 mg 
per day and hydrochlorothiazide at a dose of 
12.5 mg per day or placebo; participants were 
also randomly assigned to receive rosuvastatin 
at a dose of 10 mg per day or placebo (Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Follow-up visits occurred at 6 weeks and 
6 months after randomization and every 6 months 
thereafter. Individualized structured lifestyle ad-
vice was provided to the participants, according 
to identified needs. The blood pressure was re-
corded at each visit during the first year and 
annually thereafter. Lipid levels were measured at 
baseline in all participants and at 1 year, 3 years, 
and the end of the trial in a subsample of 10 to 
20% of the participants (with representation 
across geographic regions and races or ethnic 
groups) (see the Supplementary Appendix for 
further information). Open-label statins could be 
prescribed at the physicians’ discretion, but in 
those cases, the assigned regimen was discon-
tinued.
Efficacy and Safety Outcomes
All cardiovascular events and cases of new-onset 
diabetes were documented and adjudicated. The 
first coprimary outcome was the composite of 
death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, and the 
second coprimary outcome additionally included 
resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart failure, and 
revascularization. The secondary outcome was 
the second coprimary outcome plus angina with 
evidence of ischemia. This outcome was adopted 
by the steering committee in July 2015 without a 
protocol amendment before unblinding of the 
data on November 3, 2015. At the same time, a 
prespecified renal outcome was removed because 
of limitations of statistical power. Additional 
outcomes include death from any cause, the com-
ponents of the coprimary and secondary out-
comes, new-onset diabetes, cognitive function 
(in participants ≥70 years of age), and erectile 
dysfunction (in men). The latter two outcomes 
are not reported here. Definitions of all events 
and the approach to safety reporting are de-
scribed in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
With an expected event rate of 1% per year for 
the first coprimary outcome in the dual-placebo 
group (i.e., persons assigned to receive placebo in 
both the blood-pressure and cholesterol compari-
sons), a mean follow-up of 5.5 years, cumulative 
nonadherence rates of 23% in the groups receiv-
ing active treatment, and drop-in rates of 11% 
over a 5-year period, we estimated that a sample 
of 12,700 participants would provide the trial 
with more than 80% power to detect a risk with 
rosuvastatin that was 22.5% lower than the risk 
with placebo. To preserve the overall type I error 
rate of 5% for the testing of both coprimary out-
comes in both factorial comparisons, the first 
coprimary outcome was tested at a P value of 0.04 
and the second at a P value of 0.02. A nominal 
P value of less than 0.05 was used for all other 
analyses (further details are provided in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
The analyses were performed with the use of 
an intention-to-treat approach. Survival curves are 
shown as Kaplan–Meier curves. A Cox propor-
tional-hazards model, stratified according to the 
opposite group of the factorial design, was used 
to estimate treatment effects and to evaluate ef-
fects in subgroups. No significant interaction 
between the two treatments was observed. Pre-
specified, hypothesis-based subgroup analyses 
were conducted according to thirds of baseline 
cardiovascular risk, of LDL cholesterol level, and 
of systolic blood pressure. A post hoc recurrent-
events analysis12 was performed to assess the

Results
Participants and Adherence to the Trial 
Regimen
From April 2007 through November 2010, a total 
of 12,705 persons who adhered to the assigned 
regimen during the run-in period and did not 
have an unacceptable level of adverse events were 
randomly assigned to rosuvastatin (6361 persons) 
or to placebo (6344 persons) (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The mean age of the 
participants was 65.7 years, the mean body-mass 
index (the weight in kilograms divided by the 
square of the height in meters) was 27.1, the mean 
systolic blood pressure was 138.1 mm Hg, and 
the median fasting plasma glucose level was 
95.4 mg per deciliter (5.3 mmol per liter) (Table 1). 
A total of 46.2% of the participants were women. 
Only 5.8% had diabetes (with 44% of those par-
ticipants receiving diabetes medications). A total 
of 20% of the participants were white, 49.1% 
were Asian, 27.5% were Hispanic, and 3.3% 
were black or belonged to another ethnic group. 
The median follow-up was 5.6 years. At the end 
of the trial, vital status was available for 99.1% 
of the participants (12,587).
In the rosuvastatin group, 88.0% were taking 
the assigned regimen at 1 year, 83.5% at 3 years, 
and 75.5% at 5 years; the corresponding rates in 
the placebo group were 87.8%, 83.0%, and 73.2% 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
percentages of participants in the rosuvastatin 
group who were taking open-label statins were 
0.6% at 1 year, 1.7% at 3 years, and 2.5% at 
5 years; the corresponding percentages in the 
placebo group were 1.2%, 3.3%, and 5.6%. Rosu-
vastatin was permanently discontinued in fewer 
participants than was placebo (1510 [23.7%] vs. 
1664 [26.2%], P 
= 
0.001).

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. There were no significant between‑group differences. Definitions for the cardio‑
vascular risk factors are provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix. Data on blood pressure were missing for 
2 participants in the placebo group, and data on low‑density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level for 656 in the rosuvas‑
tatin group and for 651 in the placebo group. Data on age and sex were complete. Data on other characteristics were 
available for 99.7% or more of the trial participants, except that some laboratory variables measured at the central core 
laboratory had rates of missing data similar to that for LDL cholesterol level. To convert values for cholesterol to milli‑
moles per liter, multiply by 0.0259. To convert values for triglycerides to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.01129. To 
convert values for glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.05551. To convert values for creatinine to micromoles 
per liter, multiply by 88.4. HDL denotes high‑density lipoprotein.
†  
The body‑mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.
‡  
The measurements were made at the central core laboratory.
§  
The scale for the INTERHEART Risk Score13 ranges from 0 to 49; low cardiovascular risk corresponds to a score of 9 or 
less, medium risk to a score of 10 to 15, and high risk to a score of 16 higher.

Lipid and High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein 
Levels
At baseline, the mean total cholesterol level was 
201.4 mg per deciliter (5.22 mmol per liter), the 
mean LDL cholesterol level was 127.8 mg per 
deciliter (3.31 mmol per liter), and the mean 
apolipoprotein B level was 1.02 g per liter (Ta-
ble 1). The LDL cholesterol level (measured in the 
subsample of participants described in the Meth-
ods section) was 39.6 mg per deciliter (1.02 mmol 
per liter) lower in the rosuvastatin group than in 
the placebo group at 1 year, 34.7 mg per deciliter 
(0.90 mmol per liter) lower at 3 years, and 29.5 mg 
per deciliter (0.76 mmol per liter) lower at the 
end of the trial (overall mean difference, 34.6 mg 
per deciliter [0.90 mmol per liter] or 26.5%; 
P<0.001) (Fig. 1). The overall mean triglyceride 
level was 21.2 mg per deciliter (0.24 mmol per 
liter) lower and the overall mean apolipoprotein B 
level was 0.23 g per liter lower in the rosuvastatin 
group than in the placebo group (P<0.001 for 
both comparisons). The median high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein level at baseline was 2.0 mg 
per liter; the overall C-reactive protein level was 
significantly lower in the rosuvastatin group than 
in the placebo group (log-transformed mean dif-
ference, 0.19 mg per liter; P<0.001).
Outcomes
The first coprimary outcome occurred in 235 
participants (3.7%) in the rosuvastatin group and 
in 304 participants (4.8%) in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.64 to 0.91; P 
= 
0.002; number needed to treat 
with rosuvastatin to prevent one coprimary out-
come event, 91) (Table 2, and Fig. S7 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The second coprimary 
outcome occurred in 277 participants (4.4%) in 
the rosuvastatin group and in 363 participants 
(5.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 
95% CI, 0.64 to 0.88; P<0.001; number need to 
treat, 73) (Table 2 and Fig. 2).
In a post hoc analysis, the total number of 
events of the second coprimary outcome was 
substantially lower in the rosuvastatin group than 
in the placebo group (353 vs. 473; difference, 120; 
hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89; P 
= 
0.001) 
(Table 2). The secondary outcome occurred in 
306 participants (4.8%) in the rosuvastatin group 
and in 393 participants (6.2%) in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.89; 
P<0.001) (Table 2, and Fig. S8 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Significantly fewer participants in the rosuv-
astatin group than in the placebo group had 
strokes (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Fewer ischemic 
strokes occurred in the rosuvastatin group than 
in the placebo group (41 vs. 77), but slightly 
more hemorrhagic strokes occurred (11 vs. 8), 
and the same number of cases of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage occurred in both groups (4). (The 
type of stroke was unclassified for 15 cases of 
stroke in the rosuvastatin group and 11 cases in 
the placebo group.) Significantly fewer myocar-
dial infarctions and coronary revascularizations 
occurred in the rosuvastatin group than in the 
placebo group (Table 2 and Fig. 2). There was no 
significant difference between the two groups in 
the number of participants who had new-onset 
diabetes (Table 2). Death from cardiovascular 
causes occurred in 154 participants (2.4%) in the 
rosuvastatin group and in 171 (2.7%) in the pla-
cebo group, and death from noncardiovascular 
causes occurred in 180 participants (2.8%) in 
the rosuvastatin group and in 186 (2.9%) in the 
placebo group. The total number of deaths was 
334 in the rosuvastatin group and 357 in the 
placebo group (Table 2, and Table S12 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
A significantly smaller number of participants 
in the rosuvastatin group than in the placebo 
group were hospitalized for cardiovascular causes 
(281 [4.4%] vs. 369 [5.8%], P<0.001) (Table 2,

pants in the rosuvastatin group than in the pla-
cebo group had deep-vein thrombosis or pulmo-
nary embolism (14 vs. 31; hazard ratio, 0.45; 
95% CI, 0.24 to 0.84; P

Subgroups
The benefits of rosuvastatin, as compared with 
placebo, were consistent in subgroups defined 
according to cardiovascular risk at baseline, LDL 
cholesterol level, blood pressure, and C-reactive 
protein level (Fig. S14 and S15 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix; additional subgroup data are not 
reported here). There was also no evidence of 
heterogeneity of effect in subgroups defined ac-
cording to sex, age, and race or ethnic group.
Discussion
In the HOPE-3 trial, treatment with rosuvastatin at 
a dose of 10 mg per day for a period of 5.6 years 
in intermediate-risk persons who did not have 
cardiovascular disease and who had baseline 
lipid levels within the normal range resulted in 
a lower risk of cardiovascular events than that 
with placebo, including the risk of a composite 
of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal 
myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resusci-
tated cardiac arrest, revascularization, and heart 
failure. Treatment with rosuvastatin also result-
ed in significantly lower risks of strokes and 
myocardial infarctions than those with placebo.
The HOPE-3 trial included persons of diverse 
ethnic backgrounds in 21 countries on six con-
tinents. Approximately half the participants were 
women and 80% were nonwhite. Therefore, the 
results are broadly applicable. The benefits of 
rosuvastatin were consistent across subgroups 
defined according to LDL cholesterol level, blood 
pressure, C-reactive protein level, cardiovascular 
risk at baseline, age, sex, and race or ethnic 
group. HOPE-3 thus provides new evidence of a 
benefit of statin therapy in Chinese and other 
Asian populations and in Hispanic populations, 
in addition to white populations.
JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins 
in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating 
Rosuvastatin),5 which included only patients with 
elevated levels of C-reactive protein (>2.0 mg per 
liter) and with LDL cholesterol levels of 130 mg 
per deciliter (3.37 mmol per liter) or less, showed 
a substantially lower risk of cardiovascular events 
with the use of rosuvastatin at a dose of 20 mg 
Figure 1. Levels of LDL Cholesterol, Apolipoprotein B, and C-Reactive Protein, According to Trial Group.
The overall mean differences between the rosuvastatin group and the placebo group were as follows: 34.6 mg per 
deciliter (26.5%) in the low‑density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, 0.23 g per liter (22.0%) in the apolipoprotein B 
level, and 0.19 mg per liter in the log‑transformed C‑reactive protein level. All differences are significant (P<0.001). 
Only data from participants for whom lipid levels were available at all four time points were used in the analyses.

per day than with placebo. The LDL cholesterol 
level was 46.3 mg per deciliter (1.20 mmol per 
liter) lower at 12 months in the rosuvastatin 
group than in the placebo group; this difference 
is larger than the difference observed in HOPE-3 
(39.6 mg per deciliter) at the same time point. 
The reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events 
in JUPITER was also larger (relative risk reduc-
tion, 44%, vs. 24% in HOPE-3), but the confi-
dence intervals of the two estimates overlap, and 
the early termination of JUPITER may have in-
flated the apparent benefits. In HOPE-3, similar 
benefits were observed with rosuvastatin regard-
less of C-reactive protein level.
The results of our trial in an intermediate-
risk, primary-prevention population are consis-
tent with those of a Japanese trial14 in a primary-
prevention population with elevated lipid levels

Coronary heart disease was a post hoc outcome that included fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascu‑
larization, and angina with evidence of ischemia.

The analysis of the recurrent events of the second coprimary outcome was a post hoc analysis that used a proportional‑

Cholesterol Lowering in Intermediate-Risk Persons
and also consistent with the Cholesterol Treat-
ment Trialists’ Collaboration trial in a higher-
risk population.4 The degree of reduction of 
cardiovascular risk in HOPE-3 is consistent with 
the degree of reduction of LDL cholesterol levels 
in previous statin trials4,15 (Fig. S18 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
HOPE-3 and other statin trials, which typically 
have a relatively short mean duration of treat-
ment, may underestimate the real benefits of 
longer-term treatment. Furthermore, the absolute 
benefits of treatment are underestimated in a 
time-to-first-event analysis, as compared with an 
analysis that also considers the effect of treat-
ment on recurrent events (e.g., for the second co-
primary outcome in HOPE-3, there was a between-
group difference of 86 first events vs. 120 total 
events). Also, in HOPE-3, the difference in statin 
use between the rosuvastatin group and the pla-
cebo group was approximately 82% (in the 
middle of the trial), and thus the benefits in 
patients who actually took the statins is most 
likely larger. The differences between the rosuva-
statin group and the placebo group in LDL cho-

lesterol level and apolipoprotein B level were 
approximately one quarter smaller by the end of 
the trial than they were at 1 year, which may be 
explained largely by the moderate reductions in 
adherence to the assigned regimen in the rosuva-
statin group and by the use of statins in the 
placebo group. Despite these factors, the reduc-
tion in the risk of cardiovascular disease contin-
ued to increase over time.
The rate of discontinuation for adverse events 
was lower among the participants who received 
rosuvastatin (at a dose of 10 mg daily) than 
among those who received placebo, and there 
was no excess in diabetes or functional abnor-
malities of the liver in the rosuvastatin group. 
There was a higher rate of muscle weakness or 
pain in the rosuvastatin group than in the pla-
cebo group, but these conditions were generally 
reversible with temporary discontinuation. There 
was only one case of rhabdomyolysis (in the rosu-
vastatin group) and two episodes of myopathy 
(one each in the rosuvastatin group and the 
placebo group). There were more cases of cata-
ract surgery in the rosuvastatin group than in the 
placebo group. This effect has not been reported 
in trials but has been seen in observational stud-
ies.16 However, one trial of ezetimibe plus statins 
reported fewer cases of cataracts in the active-
treatment group than in the placebo group.17 
Determining whether the excess in cataracts is 
related to the treatment requires a systematic 
analysis of all statin trials.
The results of HOPE-3 and other trials of 
statins collectively provide an extensive body of 
evidence of a significant clinical benefit in a 
broad group of persons of diverse ethnic back-
grounds. In particular, trials of low-dose statins, 
such as HOPE-3, suggest that the risks associated 
with such therapy are low. Given that generic 
statins are now widely available and affordable 
in high-income and upper-middle-income coun-
tries,18 a case may be made for their broader use 
in these countries. Efforts to make them more 
widely available and affordable in poorer coun-
tries should facilitate wider use for both primary 
and secondary prevention. Our trial of a fixed 
dose of rosuvastatin indicates that a simple ap-
proach to treatment, without routine blood tests 
to initiate or monitor statin therapy, is effective. 
This approach avoids the costs of frequent clinic 
visits, thereby facilitating the use of rosuvastatin 
in primary care, and may have the potential to 
substantially reduce the rates of premature car-
diovascular events globally.
In summary, HOPE-3 evaluated cholesterol 
lowering with the use of a low dose of rosuvas-
tatin in a diverse population of persons who did 
not have cardiovascular disease and who were at 
intermediate risk. There was a significant reduc-
tion in the risk of cardiovascular events with the 
use of rosuvastatin.
