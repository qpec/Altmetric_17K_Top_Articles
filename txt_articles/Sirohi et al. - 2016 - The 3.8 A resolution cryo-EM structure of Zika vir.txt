The recent rapid spread of Zika virus and its unexpected linkage to birth defects and an
autoimmune neurological syndrome have generated worldwide concern. Zika virus is a
flavivirus like the dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. We present the 3.8 angstrom
resolution structure of mature Zika virus, determined by cryo–electron microscopy
(cryo-EM).The structure of Zika virus is similar to other known flavivirus structures, except
for the ~10 amino acids that surround the Asn154 glycosylation site in each of the 180
envelope glycoproteins that make up the icosahedral shell. The carbohydrate moiety
associated with this residue, which is recognizable in the cryo-EM electron density, may
function as an attachment site of the virus to host cells. This region varies not only among
Zika virus strains but also in other flaviviruses, which suggests that differences in this
region may influence virus transmission and disease.
T
he current Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in
the Americas is linked to a sudden increase
in reported cases of congenital microceph-
aly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. This led
the World Health Organization in February
2016 to declare “a public health emergency of
international concern” (1). ZIKV was first dis-
covered in a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika
valley of Uganda in 1947 (2). It was subsequently
isolated from mosquitos in 1948 (2) and from
humans in 1952 (3). It is a reemerging mosquito-
transmitted virus that was relatively unknown
until 2007, when it caused a major epidemic on
Yap Island in Micronesia (4), which was followed
by outbreaks in Oceania in 2013 and 2014 (5).
Since its introduction into Brazil in 2015 (6), the
virus has spread rapidly across the Americas (7).
ZIKV belongs to the Flaviviridae family of
positive-strand RNA viruses that includes human
pathogens such as the mosquito-transmitted den-
gue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japa-
nese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus
(YFV), and tick-borne encephalitic virus (8). ZIKV
causes a rash and a febrile flulike illness in the
majority of symptomatic individuals, but increas-
ing evidence suggests a possibility of neurologi-
cal abnormalities in developing fetuses (9, 10)
and paralysis in infected adults (11). In addition
to transmission by mosquitoes, ZIKV may be
sexually (12, 13) and vertically transmitted (9, 10).
The structure, tropism, and pathogenesis of ZIKV
are largely unknown and are the focus of current
investigations in an effort to address the need for
rapid development of vaccines and therapeutics.

 Flaviviruses are enveloped viruses containing
an RNA genome of about 11,000 bases complexed
with multiple copies of the capsid protein, sur-
rounded by an icosahedral shell consisting of 180
copies each of the envelope (E) glycoprotein (~500
amino acids) and the membrane (M) protein
(~75 amino acids) or precursor membrane (prM)
protein (~165 amino acids), all anchored in a lipid
membrane. The genome also codes for seven non-
structural proteins that are involved in replica-
tion, assembly, and antagonizing the host innate
response to infection. During their life cycle,
flavivirus virions exist in three major states—
immature, mature, and fusogenic—which are non-
infectious, infectious, andhost membrane–binding
states, respectively (8). The virus is initially as-
sembled in the endoplasmic reticulum as a non-
infectious “spiky” immature particle, consisting
of 60 trimeric E:prM heterodimer spikes (14).
Maturation into a “smooth” virus, consisting of
90 dimeric E:M heterodimers (15, 16), occurs in
the low-pH environment of the trans-Golgi net-
work through conformational changes of the
surface glycoproteins and cleavage of prM into
the pr peptide and M protein by the host pro-
tease furin. In the immature virus, the pr peptide
protects the ~12–amino acid fusion loop on the E
protein. Removal of the pr peptide during the
maturation process exposes the fusion loop,
priming the virus for low pH–mediated endo-
somal fusion (17). In addition to the aforemen-
tioned states, the structure of flavivirus virions
can be influenced by temperature (18) and the
efficiency of prM cleavage, resulting in a heter-
ogeneous population of particles (19).
We report here the cryo–electron microcopy
(cryo-EM) structure of the mature ZIKV at near-
atomic resolution (3.8 Å) and compare it with
the structure of other flaviviruses to provide a
foundation for detailed analyses of the virology,
antigenicity, and pathogenesis of this emerging
threat to public health. ZIKV strain H/PF/2013,
which was isolated from an infected patient dur-
ing the 2013–2014 French Polynesia epidemic
(20), was grown and purified from mammalian
cells at 37°C. It was shown recently that the
coding region of this strain has >99.9% amino
acid identity to the strain that is currently cir-
culating in Latin America (21). Low-passage Vero
cells, derived from African green monkey kidney
cells, were chosen for propagating the virus. To
ensure a homogeneous population of virions suit-
able for single-particle reconstruction, virus was
purified from Vero cells that overexpressed the host
protease furin (Vero-furin). Vero-furin cells (109)
were infected with ZIKV at a multiplicity of in-
fection of 0.1. The virus was harvested under con-
ditions of low cytopathic effect and purified using
polyethylene glycol 8000, 24% sucrose cushion
ultracentrifugation, and a potassium tartrate (10
to 35%)–glycerol (7.5 to 26%) gradient, as previous-
ly described (17). The identity of the virus was veri-
fied by reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR (22);
the primer sequences are shown in table S1.
The ZIKV preparation was frozen onto lacey
carbon EM grids and examined with an FEI
Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with
a Gatan K2 Summit detector; a magnification of
14,000 in the “super-resolution” mode was used,
resulting in a pixel size of 1.04 Å (Fig. 1A). The
total exposure time for producing one image com-
posed of 70 frames was 14 s and required a dose
rate of 2 electrons Å–2 s–1. A total of 2974 images
were collected, and 64,518 particles were boxed
using the automated Appion method (23). Non-
reference two-dimensional (2D) classification was
performed using the Relion program (24) to select
20,151 particles. The data set was split into two
subsets according to the “gold standard” conven-
tion (25). The jspr program (26) was used for initial
model generation, refinement of the orientation,
and centering of the selected particles. After two
rounds of 3D classification, 11,842 particles were
used to generate a cryo-EM map at an average
resolution of 4.2 Å. Application of soft masks
improved the overall resolution to 3.8 Å, calcu-
lated using the 0.143 Fourier shell correlation
criterion (25) (Fig. 1D). The structure of DENV2
serotype (16) was used as a starting point for
model building. The atomic model was built
manually using the program Coot (27) and re-
fined with Phenix (28) and CNS (29). The final
cryo-EM density was Fourier-analyzed. The re-
sultant Fourier coefficients were used as targets
for a crystallographic refinement. The final Rwork
and Rfree were 34 and 34%, respectively (table
S2). The map shows continuous density for the
E and M polypeptide chains, and large side-
chain densities are also visible in many cases,
which was useful for sequence assignment. Ex-
cept for the last three residues of E at its C
terminus, all residues in both the E (residues 1 to
501) and M (residues 1 to 75) proteins were fit-
ted into the density (Fig. 1E). A representative
volume of density is shown in Fig. 1F. Similar to
other flaviviruses, the E protein of ZIKV consists
of four domains: the stem-transmembrane do-
main that anchors the protein into the mem-
brane and domains I, II, and III that constitute
the predominantly b-strand surface portion of
the protein (Fig. 2). The M protein consists of a
loop at the N terminus (M loop or soluble M)
and stem and transmembrane regions contain-
ing one and two helices, respectively, which an-
chor the M protein to the lipid bilayer (figs. S1
and S2).
The cryo-EM map shows that the mature ZIKV
structure is similar to mature DENV (15, 16) and
WNV structures (30) (Fig. 1). The radial distances
of the core lipid bilayer and envelope ectodomains
are similar to those of DENV2 (16) (Fig. 1C). A
noticeable feature is the protruding density on
the surface of the virus (red in Fig. 1, B and C),
which is the glycan on the E protein. The E
proteins exhibit the characteristic herringbone
structure in the virion, in which there is one (E-M)2
dimeric heterodimer located on each of 30 two-
fold vertices and 60 (E-M)2 dimeric heterodimers
in general positions within the icosahedral pro-
tein shell (Fig. 1E). The root mean square devia-
tion between equivalent Ca atoms of the E and
M proteins of mature ZIKV and DENV is 1.8 Å.
However, by far the biggest difference (up to 6 Å)
between equivalent Ca atoms of these viruses is
the region around the glycosylation sites (Asn154
in ZIKV and Asn153 in DENV) (Fig. 3). ZIKV has a
single glycosylation site in the E protein (Asn154),
whereas DENV is glycosylated at two sites with-
in the E protein (Asn67 and Asn153) (fig. S2). Den-
dritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule
3–grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and the man-
nose receptor are putative DENV receptors that

 bind to the glycans (31, 32). DC-SIGN was shown
by cryo-EM to bind to the glycans at Asn67 on two
neighboring E proteins of the mature virion (31).
The structures of various flaviviruses alone and
in complex with neutralizing antibodies (33) or
cellular receptors (31) have been reported previ-
ously. These structures have demonstrated multi-
ple mechanisms of antibody neutralization and
receptor interactions. Carbohydrate moieties on
the virus may be used for cell attachment and
probably play a role in disease severity. For DENV,
glycosylation at Asn67 on the E protein is an at-
tachment site for several cell types that have been
shown to be relevant targets of infection in vivo
(31, 32). Similarly, glycosylation at Asn154 in WNV
has been linked to neurotropism (34). These ob-
servations demonstrate the importance of glyco-
sylation for the attachment of flaviviruses to cells.
The carbohydrate densities for ZIKV and DENV2
are not coincident, and the conformation of their
surrounding residues is different (Fig. 3). This
region varies not only among ZIKV strains (35)
but also in other flaviviruses, which suggests that
differences in this region influence local virus
structure and possibly dynamics (Fig. 3D). In part,
this difference is because of an insertion of five
residues in ZIKV relative to DENV (Fig. 3A), re-
flecting a highly variable region of the E protein.
The glycan at E residue 154 is located on a loop
that is adjacent to the fusion peptide in the
neighboring E protein and may control solvent
access to the fusion loop. The conserved fusion
loop and the neighboring region is an epitope for
numerous cross-reactive antibodies that vary con-
siderably in potency and sensitivity to the pres-
ence of uncleaved prM on the virion (36). The
differences discussed here may modulate the sen-
sitivity of ZIKV to antibodies that bind the fusion
loop epitopes. Furthermore, this region may also
be important for attachment to cellular lectin re-
ceptors. The differences shown here in E protein
structure among ZIKV and other flaviviruses may
govern cellular tropism and contribute to disease
outcomes.

yellow) and other ZIKV strains is aligned to that of representative mosquito-
transmitted flaviviruses. About 40 residues of domain I, centered on the Asn154
glycosylation site, are compared.The conserved glycosylation site at Asn153–154
is highlighted in blue. Red arrows represent secondary structures of ZIKV

EVOLUTIONARY GENETICS
A beak size locus in Darwin’s finches
facilitated character displacement
during a drought

Ecological character displacement is a process of morphological divergence that reduces
competition for limited resources. We used genomic analysis to investigate the genetic
basis of a documented character displacement event in Darwin’s finches on Daphne Major
in the Galápagos Islands: The medium ground finch diverged from its competitor, the large
ground finch, during a severe drought. We discovered a genomic region containing the
HMGA2 gene that varies systematically among Darwin’s finch species with different beak
sizes. Two haplotypes that diverged early in the radiation were involved in the character
displacement event: Genotypes associated with large beak size were at a strong selective
disadvantage in medium ground finches (selection coefficient s = 0.59). Thus, a major
locus has apparently facilitated a rapid ecological diversification in the adaptive radiation
of Darwin’s finches.
S
imilar species potentially compete for lim-
ited resources when they encounter each
other through a change in geographical
ranges. As a result of resource competi-
tion, they may diverge in traits associated
with exploiting these resources (1, 2). Darwin
proposed this as the principle of character di-
vergence [now known as ecological character
displacement (3, 4)], a process invoked as an
important mechanism in the assembly of com-
plex ecological communities (5, 6). It is also an
important component of models of speciation
(6, 7). However, it has been difficult to obtain un-
equivocal evidence for ecological character dis-
placement in nature (8, 9). The medium ground
finch (Geospiza fortis) and large ground finch
(G. magnirostris) on the small island of Daphne
Major provide one example where rigorous crite-
ria have been met (10). Beak sizes diverged as a
result of a selective disadvantage to medium
ground finches with large beaks when food avail-
ability declined through competition with large
ground finches during a severe drought in
2004–2005 (11).
Size-related traits can pose problems for the
analysis of selection, and Darwin’s finch beaks
are no exception, as beak size and body size are
strongly correlated (r = 0.7 to 0.8) (11). We used
a combination of multiple regression and se-
lection differential analysis to investigate the
2004–2005 selection event. Statistically, these
produced much stronger associations between
survival and beak size (S = –1.02, P < 0.0001)
than between survival and body size (S = –0.67,
P < 0.05). Thus, body size was possibly subject
to selection, but beak size was a more impor-
tant factor affecting the probability of survival
independent of body size (11, 12). However, the
genetic basis of the selected traits remains un-
known. Beak dimensions and overall body size of
the medium ground finch are highly heritable
(13), but no gene(s) regulating body size have
been identified. Furthermore, although some
signaling molecules affecting beak dimensions
in Darwin’s finches have been identified (14),
only one regulatory gene, ALX1, is known and
it regulates variation in beak shape (15), which
was not associated with survival in 2004–2005.
We performed a genome-wide screen for
loci affecting overall body size in six species of
Darwin’s finches that primarily differ in size
and size-related traits: the small, medium, and
large ground finches, and the small, medium,
and large tree finches (Fig. 1, A and B, and table
S1). Ground finches and tree finches diverged
about 400,000 years ago and exhibit ongoing
gene flow within and between the two groups
(15). By combining species of similar size in dif-
ferent taxa, we minimized phylogenetic effects
when contrasting the genomes of species dif-
fering in size. We then genotyped individuals
of the Daphne population of medium ground
finches that succumbed or survived during the
drought of 2004–2005. This approach allowed
us to identify a locus with major effect on beak
size variation that played a key role in the char-
acter displacement episode.
We sequenced 10 birds from each of the six
species (total 60 birds) to ~10× coverage per
individual, using 2 × 125–base pair paired-end
reads. The sequences were aligned to the refer-
ence genome from a female medium ground
