A growing number of empirical studies have revealed that diaphragmatic breathing may
trigger body relaxation responses and benefit both physical and mental health. However,
the specific benefits of diaphragmatic breathing on mental health remain largely
unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of diaphragmatic breathing
on cognition, affect, and cortisol responses to stress. Forty participants were randomly
assigned to either a breathing intervention group (BIG) or a control group (CG). The BIG
received intensive training for 20 sessions, implemented over 8 weeks, employing a real-
time feedback device, and an average respiratory rate of 4 breaths/min, while the CG did
not receive this treatment. All participants completed pre- and post-tests of sustained
attention and affect. Additionally, pre-test and post-test salivary cortisol concentrations
were determined in both groups. The findings suggested that the BIG showed a
significant decrease in negative affect after intervention, compared to baseline. In the
diaphragmatic breathing condition, there was a significant interaction effect of group by
time on sustained attention, whereby the BIG showed significantly increased sustained
attention after training, compared to baseline. There was a significant interaction effect
of group and time in the diaphragmatic breathing condition on cortisol levels, whereby
the BIG had a significantly lower cortisol level after training, while the CG showed
no significant change in cortisol levels. In conclusion, diaphragmatic breathing could
improve sustained attention, affect, and cortisol levels. This study provided evidence
demonstrating the effect of diaphragmatic breathing, a mind−body practice, on mental
function, from a health psychology approach, which has important implications for health
promotion in healthy individuals.

INTRODUCTION
Breathing practice, also known as “
diaphragmatic breathing”or “
deep breathing,”is defined as
an efficient integrative body–
mind training for dealing with stress and psychosomatic conditions.
Diaphragmatic breathing involves contraction of the diaphragm, expansion of the belly, and
deepening of inhalation and exhalation, which consequently decreases the respiration frequency

and maximizes the amount of blood gases. Benefits of
diaphragmatic breathing have been investigated in association
with meditation and ancient eastern religions (such as Buddhism)
and martial arts (Lehrer et al., 2010). It is considered to be a core
component of yoga and Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) and contributes
to emotional balance and social adaptation (Sargunaraj et al.,
1996; Beauchaine, 2001; Porges, 2001), as well as special rhythmic
movements and positions.
Psychological studies have revealed breathing practice to
be an effective non-pharmacological intervention for emotion
enhancement (Stromberg et al., 2015), including a reduction in
anxiety, depression, and stress (Brown and Gerbarg, 2005a,b;
Anju et al., 2015). A 1-day breathing exercise was found to
relieve the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization induced
by job burnout (Salyers et al., 2011). A 30-session intervention
with a daily duration of 5 min can significantly decrease the
anxiety of pregnant women experiencing preterm labor (Chang
et al., 2009). In addition, similar effects on anxiety was observed
in a 3-days intervention study, where breathing practices were
performed 3 times per day (Yu and Song, 2010). Further
evidence from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested
that a 7-days intensive residential yoga program that included
pranayama (breathing exercises) reduced anxiety and depression
in patients with chronic low back pain (Tekur et al., 2012).
Supportive evidence has also come from a line of RCTs of TCC
and yoga (Benson, 1996; Telles et al., 2000; Oakley and Evans,
2014). Currently, breathing practice is widely applied in clinical
treatments for mental conditions, such as post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) (Sahar et al., 2001; Descilo et al., 2010; Goldin
and Gross, 2010), motion disorders (Russell et al., 2014), phobias
(Friedman and Thayer, 1998), and other stress-related emotional
disorders.
Earlier
studies
have
observed
an
attention/vigilance
impairment related to breathing dysfunction in dementia and
sleep-disordered breathing in individuals across all ages (Chervin
et al., 2006). More recent studies have suggested that there is
a bidirectional association between breathing and attention.
A growing number of clinical studies have demonstrated that
breathing-including meditation may represent a new non-
pharmacological approach for improving specific aspects of
attention. Mindfulness, for instance, contributes to alerting and
orienting, but conflicts with monitoring. In addition, an 8-weeks
mindfulness-based stress reduction yielded a larger effect than a
1-month intensive mindfulness retreat, on the attention altering
component (Jha et al., 2007). Focused attention meditation is a
Buddhist practice, whereby selective attention and the sensation
of respiration must be sustained (Gunaratana, 1993/2002; Gyatso
and Jinpa, 1995). Three months of intensive focused attention
meditation have been found to reduce variability in attentional
processing of target tones and to enhance attentional task
performance (Lutz et al., 2009). Some studies have investigated
cognitive and emotional improvement simultaneously, and have
indicated that a brief mental training could enhance sustained
attention as well as reduce fatigue and anxiety (Zeidan et al.,
2010). Some researchers believe that the relaxation generated
by peaceful breathing helped to manage inattention symptoms
among children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) (Amon and Campbell, 2008). These results led to the
development of a breath-controlled biofeedback game called
ChillFish, which improved children’
s sustained attention and
relaxation levels (Sonne and Jensen, 2016).
Studies orientated toward the physiological mechanism
of breathing intervention effects have indicated a shared
physiological
basis
underlying
breathing,
emotion,
and
cognition,
involving
the
autonomic
nervous
system.
Physiological evidence has indicated that even a single breathing
practice significantly reduces blood pressure, increases heart
rate variability (HRV) (Wang et al., 2010; Lehrer and Gevirtz,
2014; Wei et al., 2016) and oxygenation (Bernardi et al., 1998),
enhances pulmonary function (Shaw et al., 2010), and improves
cardiorespiratory fitness and respiratory muscle strength (Shaw
et al., 2010). A daily 15-min breathing training for 2 weeks
significantly promoted mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s
and peak expiratory flow rate (Bernardi et al., 1998). Breathing
with a certain frequency and amplitude was found to relieve
clinical symptoms in patients of all ages with sleep-disordered
breathing (Chervin et al., 2006). Evidence from yoga practice
also confirms a reduction of sympathetic and an increase of
parasympathetic nervous system activity (Vempati and Telles,
2002; Raghuraj and Telles, 2003). Cardiac vagal tone is assumed
to form part of the shared physiological basis of breathing and
emotion. It is influenced by breathing and is also integral to vagal
nerve stimulation that is closely associated with the physiological
basis of emotion, including emotional regulation, psychological
adaptation (Sargunaraj et al., 1996; Beauchaine, 2001), emotional
reactivity and expression, empathic responses, and attachment
(Porges, 2001). Moreover, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous
system is observed in adults with anxiety (Kawachi et al., 1995;
Thayer et al., 1996; Friedman and Thayer, 1998), depression
(Carney et al., 1995; Lehofer et al., 1997), PTSD (Sahar et al.,
2001), panic disorder (Friedman and Thayer, 1998), and other
stress-related mental and physical disorders (Benson, 1996;
Becker, 2000; Bazhenova et al., 2001; Jacobs, 2001).
The shared physiological basis of attention and breathing
can be detected in part in the autonomic nervous system of
patients with ADHD (Beauchaine, 2001), but more evidence
is provided by electroencephalographic (EEG) studies and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (Lutz
et al., 2004). For instance, EEG studies have suggested that regular
breathing practice during yoga and meditation can increase
β-activity in the left frontal, midline, and occipital brain regions
(Bhatia et al., 2003; Snayder et al., 2006), which has been
associated with enhanced cognitive performance, such as during
attention, memory, and executive functions (Freeman et al.,
1999). In addition, fMRI studies have also detected a significant
increase in activation in the bilateral inferior frontal and temporal
regions under meditation, as compared to a relaxation condition.
Such studies implicated the right inferior frontal cortex/right
insula and right middle/superior temporal cortex as the regions
involved in meditation (Hernández et al., 2015).
Cortisol, a steroid hormone of the glucocorticoid class, is
released in response to stress. Cortisol release is associated
with depression, anxiety, and other negative emotions. The
underlying mechanism may be grounded in its sensitivity for the

Breathing Practice Promotes Mental Health
activity of the hypothalamic–
pituitary–
adrenal (HPA) axis (Clow
et al., 2010), which regulates metabolism, immunity, and some
mental processing, including memories and emotional appraisal
(Pariante and Lightman, 2008). Plasma cortisol levels reflect
changes in the activation of the HPA axis with changes in CO2
inhalation (Argyropoulos et al., 2002), while salivary cortisol
levels have been associated with fast withdrawal of attention in
response to angry faces (van Honk et al., 1998). However, the
associations between breathing, emotion, attention, and cortisol
have not been tested together.
Although breathing practice offers an integrated benefit for
mental and physical health, the results of studies on this
topic are inconsistent, because of methodological limitations
in the experimental design, a lack of measurable breathing
feedback, and limited sample sizes. Most cross-sectional and
longitudinal studies have focused on how breathing treatment
benefits individuals with particular conditions, such as women
during pregnancy (Schmidt et al., 2000; Booth et al., 2014) and
clerks experiencing job burnout (Salyers et al., 2011), rather
than on its health promotion function in a healthy population.
Most importantly, most studies have investigated physiological
effects, emotional benefits, and cognitive benefits separately,
which prevents an understanding of the possible mental and
physiological mechanisms of breathing in terms of its potential
benefit for both mental and physical health.
The present study was a pilot RCT with visible feedback
breathing recordings used to monitor the breathing performance
overall and to evaluate the outcomes of breathing practice. The
aims of this study were to investigate the mental benefits and
the hormone levels in healthy volunteers who completed an 8-
weeks breathing training scheme. An emotional self-reporting
scale and cognitive tests were used to measure mental benefits.
Additionally, cortisol a major HPA-axis-related stress hormone
in humans (Matousek et al., 2010), was also measured to examine
whether the breathing practice could be a buffer for modulating
stress levels in the working population. We hypothesized that an
8-weeks breathing training course would significantly improve
cognitive performance, and reduce negative affect (NA) and
physiological stress.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Participants were recruited from a local IT company in Beijing,
China. The Institute Review Board of Beijing Normal University
approved this study. This study was performed in accordance
with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of
Helsinki and its later amendments. The procedure of the study
was fully explained to the participants, and informed written
consent was obtained from each participant before the study.
All participants completed the following screening forms: (1)
a health approval from a recent physical check-up at a medical
center and (2) a demographic questionnaire that included basic
demographic information and mind–
body training experience.
Participants who had a history of physical health problems,
such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory
diseases, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, neuropathy, and drug
or alcohol abuse, were excluded from the study. In addition,
participants who had yoga, TCC, or Qigong experience, as well
as other mind–
body training, were excluded.
Experimental Protocol
All interventions and tests were performed in a sunny,
soundproof, open-air conference room at the IT company rather
than in our laboratory. We reasoned that this would avoid any
potential anxiety that could be brought on by rushing from
the workplace to the laboratory. Participants sat comfortably in
leather armchairs throughout the study.
A final total of 40 participants were included in this study.
They were assigned to a breathing intervention group (BIG, 10
females and 10 males) or a control group (CG, 10 females and
10 males) by alternating the order of their registration. Gender
balance was also taken into consideration during this sampling
procedure.
The BIG learnt basic knowledge and essential skills about
diaphragmatic breathing, and became familiar with experiencing
breathing in as deeply as possible and then exhaling almost
all the air from the lungs, slowly, in a self-controlled, slow
rhythm, under the guide of a coach. All participants were
instructed to focus on their breathing and the sensations
produced in the body, while sitting comfortably in chairs with
their eyes closed. Participants were considered as performing
diaphragmatic breathing if their respiratory rate decreased while
their respiratory amplitude increased in waveform.
After this learning phase, both groups completed the
baseline tests. These included the Positive and Negative Affect
Schedule (PANAS), the Number Cancellation Test (NCT), and a
cortisol test. Thereafter, the BIG received 20-sessions of breath-
controlling intervention. Each intervention involved a 15-min
resting breathing session and a 15-min diaphragmatic breathing
session consequently. The diaphragmatic breathing session began
with general verbal guidance from the breathing coach, who
spoke at a slow speed to help participants to become more
easily involved. A final test, similar to the baseline test, was
implemented at the end of the 20th intervention. In contrast, the
CG received only an introduction of breathing and rest, a baseline
test, and a final test, without any other intervention.
The experimental training procedure consisted of 20 sessions
over a period of 8 weeks. Each session was conducted every
other day on weekdays. Both groups were informed of the
purpose and the procedures of this study after training. In the
BIG, 20 participants were required to conduct resting breathing
for 15 min and diaphragmatic breathing for 15 min in each
session (Figure 1). During resting breathing, participants were
instructed to breathe in a normal state. With closed eyes
while sitting comfortably. During diaphragmatic breathing, they
were instructed to inhale as deeply as they could while their
abdomen expanded, and to exhale as slowly as they could while
their abdomen contracted, in a self-paced rhythm, under the
instruction of a breathing training coach and with feedback
via a recording device. The two breathing conditions were
recorded during the entire 30-min training. Therefore, each
participant’
s breathing waves were visible and monitored by

the experimenter to ensure that participants were following the
instructions completely. For the CG, data of resting breathing and
diaphragmatic breathing from 20 participants were collected on
the first day of training and on the last day of training. Before and
after the entire training, the two groups completed the PANAS,
NCT, and cortisol level test (Figure 1).
Breath Recording
Synchronous breathing signals were recorded using breathing
monitors (Dongtuo Science and Technology Ltd., Beijing,
China) that recorded participants’respiration with a high
temporal resolution. All data were collected by inductive sensors
(JD/PW-5; Boda Electron Co., Beijing, China), which were kept
against the chest of each participant during the rest condition,
or alternatively against the abdomen during diaphragmatic
breathing. Data were transferred to the host computer (Lenovo,
M4600 P3.0HT 25640VN) via Bluetooth and expressed on-
screen as continuous visual waveforms. The height of the
wave crest represented the amplitude of a single breath, while
the wavelength indicated the duration. Each computer was
connected to two inductive sensors; 10 recordings were made
simultaneously.
All five research assistants were postgraduate students in
psychology. They attended a meeting in which training was given
and breath recording was practiced for approximately 1 week
prior to the formal experiment, in order to standardize the
data collection procedure. Each of them monitored breathing
processes for two participants concurrently and ensured that data
input and output proceeded smoothly.
Throughout the breathing process, all participants kept their
eyes closed and breathed through the nose. The assistants
supervised their recordings and obtained the help of the coach
if the recording vibrated or if the breathing frequency remained
higher than 6 breaths/min by 2 min after the intervention began.
The coach offered special guidance to help these participants
attain diaphragmatic breathing.
Psychological Measurements
All participants were asked to complete behavioral measurements
before training and after training. The behavioral measurements
included the PANAS and the NCT. The PANAS (Watson et al.,
1988) is a 5-point Likert scale that measures participants’
feelings during the past week. It includes 20 self-reported items
that are equally divided into a positive affect (PA) subscale
and a NA subscale. Items are scored on a scale of 1–
5,
indicating very slightly or not at all, a little, moderately, quite
a bit, and very much, respectively. The PANAS scale is highly
internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, stable, and reliable
across cultures, and can distinctively estimate PA and NA at the
same time (Thompson, 2007).

The NCT includes one short practice sheet and four test sheets
for evaluate attention sustainability, which is reflected by the
scores generated according to the accuracy in the test. Each sheet
contains 200 single digits with special symbols below or above
them. The targets are “
9”digits with two symbols below, above,
or on either side. Participants were asked to cross out targets with
a slash and ignore targets placed subsequent to a “
5”as quickly
as possible, within 1 min for each sheet. Participants had a 10-
to 20-s interval break between two sheets. The final scores were
yielded by the sum of the correct number of target digits for each
sheet.
Neuroendocrine Test
Salivary cortisol was collected four times with the Salivette
R
�
Cortisol (Art. No. 51.1534) (Sarstedt AG and Co., Nümbrecht,
Germany) at two time points: before and after diaphragmatic
breathing at baseline, and before and after the diaphragmatic
breathing at the final test. All salivary cortisol samples were
processed according to the manufacturer’
s instructions. Before
collection, all participants were required to take a 5-min break.
Each participant was asked to refrain from eating or drinking
(except water) within 20 min before saliva collection. In both
the BIG and CG, the saliva sample was collected between 11:00
and 12:00 to control for the variation in cortisol levels over the
circadian rhythm.
Salivary cortisol was analyzed using a competitive enzyme
immunoassay (ELISA, DiaMetra
R
�, Perugia, Italy), which had
a 3–
10 g/mL limit of cortisol, for collections before lunch,
according to specifications provided by the manufacturer
DiaMetra
R
�. An intra-assay coefficient variation (9.8%) and an
inter-assay coefficient variation (15%) were calculated according
to Jaedicke et al. (2012) (Validation and quality control of
ELISAs for the use with human saliva samples) (Kirschbaum and
Hellhammer, 1994; Ogbureke and Ogbureke, 2015).
RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics
Demographic characteristics of all the participants in each group
are summarized in Table 1. The paired t-tests showed that there
were no between-group differences in terms of age [t(38) = 1.31;
p = 0.56, Cohen’
s d = 0.420], years of education [t(38) =
1.47; p = 0.56, Cohen’
s d = 0.465], or work experience
[t(38) = 1.05; p = 0.22, Cohen’
s d = 0.331]. These results
indicate that the BIG and CG were well balanced in age, years
of education, and work experience.

and
17
times/min
in the
resting breathing condition (M ± SD = 17.51 ± 5.02)
(Table 2).
A 2 × 20 within-subject repeated measures analysis was
conducted to analyze the change in respiratory rate between
the resting and diaphragmatic breathing conditions across all
time-points, after each of the 20 sessions, in the BIG. The
within-group factors were breathing conditions (diaphragmatic
vs. resting) and intervention times (20 assessments). This
analysis revealed a significant effect of time, F(19,133) = 2.09,
p = 0.008, η2
p = 0.23, and a significant effect of breathing
condition, F(1,7) = 99.60, p < 0.000, η2
p = 0.93. There
was also a significant interaction between time and condition,
F(19,133) = 5.28, p < 0.000, η2
p = 0.43. The simple effect
revealed that there were significant frequency drops (compared
to time point 1) at time point 8, MD = 2.36, p = 0.027, time
point 11, MD = 1.77, p = 0.018, time point 13, MD = 2.38,

p = 0.033, and time point 20, MD = 2.23, p = 0.023. The
simple effects on breathing shows that the respiratory frequencies
in diaphragmatic breathing were significantly below that in
resting breathing at every intervention time point, with the
MDs ranging from 5.63 to 15.93, all ps < 0.002. These results
indicated that the breathing intervention successfully reduced the

Breathing Practice Promotes Mental Health
breathing frequency in the diaphragmatic breathing condition in
the BIG.
A 2 × 2 mixed repeated measures analysis was conducted
to analyze the change in the respiratory rate between the
resting and diaphragmatic breathing conditions across time
points and groups (see Figure 2). The within-group factor
was the intervention session (baseline test and final line
test), while the between factor was group (BIG vs. CG). The
reduction of breathing frequency between diaphragmatic and
resting conditions was employed as the measure. This analysis
revealed a significant main effect of condition, F(1,36) = 23.36,
p = 0.000, η2
p = 0.39, and an interaction between condition
and groups, F(1,36) = 7.66, p = 0.009, η2
p = 0.175. A simple
effect measurement was conducted and revealed that there
was no significant between-group difference during resting
breathing, MD = 0.43, p = 0.861, but diaphragmatic breathing
frequency was significant lower than that during resting
breathing, MD = 7.12, p = 0.000. The respiration frequency
in diaphragmatic breathing was significantly less than that
in resting breathing in the BIG, MD = 9.19, p = 0.000,
but no similar result was detected in the CG, MD = 2.50,
p = 0.153. These results indicated that the diaphragmatic
breathing intervention was effective in both the BIG and the CG,
but a significant breathing frequency decrease was only observed
in the BIG.

was significantly lower than that in the resting breathing condition in BIG.

A 2 × 2 mixed repeated measures analysis was conducted
to analyze the change in NA across the intervention (see
Figure 3). The between-group factor was group (BIG vs. CG),
while the within-group factor was test time (baseline test vs.
final test). Time and group revealed a marginally significant
interaction, F(1,37) = 3.43, p = 0.07, η2
p = 0.09. A simple
effect measurement was conducted and revealed that the BIG
demonstrated a significant reduction in NA score after the
intervention, MD = 2.55, p = 0.02, while no similar results
were detected in the CG, MD = −0.15, p = 0.88. There was no
significant main effect of time, F(1,37) = 2.72, p = 0.11, η2
p = 0.07,
or of group, F(1,37) = 0.9, p = 0.34, η2
p = 0.02.
A 2 × 2 mixed repeated measures analysis was conducted to
analyze the change in PA across the intervention. We measured
the between-group differences (BIG vs. CG) in PA at the baseline
test and final test and detected an insignificant interaction
between group and test times, F(1,37) = 0.17, p = 0.68,
η2
p = 0.005, a non-significant main effect of time, F(1,37) = 0.96,
p = 0.33, η2
p = 0.03, and a non-significant main effect of group,
F(1,37) = 0.29, p = 0.60, η2
p = 0.008.
Sustained Attention
A 2 × 2 mixed repeated measures analysis was conducted to
analyze the change in the NCT score across the intervention
(see Figure 4). We measured between-group differences (BIG vs.
CG) in the NCT score change at the baseline and final tests. The
NCT result revealed a significant interaction between time and
group, F(1,37) = 9.68, p = 0.004, η2
p = 0.21. A simple effect
measurement was conducted and revealed that the BIG showed
a significant increase in the NCT score after the intervention,
MD = 6.728, p = 0.000), and similar results were detected in
the CG, MD = 4.19, p = 0.000. The main effect of time was
significant, F(1,37) = 191.48, p = 0.00, η2
p = 0.84, so was the main
effect of group, F(1,37) = 0.01, p = 0.93, η2
p = 0.00.

Salivary Cortisol
A 2 × 4 mixed repeated measures analysis was conducted
to analyze the change in salivary cortisol concentration across
the intervention (see Figure 5). The between-group factor was
group (BIG vs. CG), while the within-group factor was test
time (test 1, test 2, test 3, and test 4). The salivary cortisol
samples were collected before and after diaphragmatic breathing
for both baseline and final tests. The concentration result revealed
a significant interaction of time and group, F(3,111) = 9.06,
p = 0.000, η2
p = 0.20. A simple effect measurement revealed
that the BIG showed a significant decrease in salivary cortisol
concentration after the intervention, whereby the concentration
was significantly lower in test 3 and test 4 as compared to test 1
and test 2, MD1−3 = 1.32, p = 0.003, MD1−4 = 1.39, p = 0.002,
MD2,3 = 1.59, p = 0.00, MD1−3 = 1.66, p = 0.00. However, no
similar result was found in the CG, p > 0.05. The main effect of
time was significant, F(1,37) = 4.17, p = 0.008, η2
p = 0.10, but
there was no significant main effect of group, F(1,37) = 0.01,
p = 0.92, η2
p = 0.00.
DISCUSSION
Using a randomized controlled design, the present study
examined whether 8 weeks of intensive diaphragmatic breathing
training, a core component of mind–
body practices, could
influence cognition, emotion, and physiological responses.
As
expected,
the
lowered
frequency
of
respiration
after
the intervention suggested that the diaphragmatic breathing
intervention had been inculcated. The NA score decreased
after the intervention, but the PA did not change. Sustained
attention scores increased after the intervention. Moreover, a
significant time effect of diaphragmatic breathing on cortisol
levels was observed (before training vs. after training tests),
although no group differentially influence cortisol. We interpret
the findings as illustrating the potential benefits of diaphragmatic
breathing practice for improving cognitive function and reducing
negative affect and physiological responses to stress in healthy
adults.

were significantly decreased after training in BIG, but no significant changes
were detected in the CG.
The Effectiveness of Breathing Practice
Numerous studies in health psychology and clinical treatment
have demonstrated that diaphragmatic breathing is an effective
relaxation technique in complementary and alternative medicine,
with beneficial effects on physical and mental health (Cahalin
et al., 2002; Tsang et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016). However, in most
studies of mind–
body intervention, diaphragmatic breathing
worked as a latent component or an essential preparation for
the core intervention regime, such as meditation, TCC, or yoga
(Telles et al., 2000; Oakley and Evans, 2014). In the present
study, we monitored the breathing as an independent mind–
body intervention form to discuss the health contribution to
cognition, emotion, and stress response when respiration slowed.
In order to achieve this aim, we adopted a unique breathing
control method, which combined a monitoring device and coach
supervision simultaneously.
In previous studies, practice duration and times were key
characters for depicting an intervention protocol, but these
seldom reported the final breathing rate and the manner in
which respiration frequency decreased. In a study of slow-
breathing training on chronic heart failure (Drozdz et al., 2016)
reported its protocol as a 10–
12 weeks’(15 min per day)
slow-breathing training with a breathing rate at 6 breaths/min,
which meets the key requirements of diaphragmatic breathing.
A clear respiration frequency provides a reliable and reproducible
operation standard for estimating whether the intervention
successfully decreased the respiration frequency. In the present
study, the significant difference in respiration rate between
the diaphragmatic breathing and resting breathing conditions
confirmed that participants correctly followed the protocol for
diaphragmatic breathing. The non-significant between-group
difference in the respiration frequency in the resting breathing
condition confirmed the distinction between the two breathing
conditions. In addition, the continuous decrease in respiration
rate observed in the BIG represented the process of learning and
practice. All these results indicate that the change in respiratory
rate could be attributed to the effectiveness of the diaphragmatic
breathing practice over the 8 weeks. They also indirectly implied
that the positive effects in this study were induced by intensive
diaphragmatic breathing practice, rather than any confounding
variables.
The present study employed a breathing monitor with results
visualized on a screen and with a senior yoga coach providing
professional guidance and instruction. Previous studies have
demonstrated that most participants could follow self-paced
breathing instructions via audio or video cues. Clinical studies
usually adopt a breathing device with quantitative feedback
parameters, such as respiratory rate or HRV (Sherlin et al.,
2010). Respiratory sinus arrhythmia biofeedback has also been
used to examine the effect of breathing practice on HRV
and symptoms of PTSD, which revealed a significantly greater
reduction in depressive symptoms and increases in HRV indices
for individuals with respiratory sinus arrhythmia (Zucker et al.,
2009). These breathing devices with feedback parameters have
an advantage over visual or auditory instructions, without
feedback (Brown et al., 2013), and have been widely applied
in treatment for physical and mental disorders. Inviting a

senior breathing coach is an alternative solution for breathing
practice and control (Drozdz et al., 2016). In the present
study, the coach strictly guided and monitored the entire
process of diaphragmatic breathing during 20 sessions in
a previous study. These two methods guaranteed that the
participants breathed properly under two conditions under
specific supervision during training. Having an appropriate
monitor was another problem that was encountered in breathing
practice studies.
Breathing Practice to Decrease Negative
Affect
Emotional improvements have been reported to be the most
obvious benefit of mind–
body interventions (Stromberg et al.,
2015). It has been suggested that the detrimental effects of
stress and negative emotions could be counteracted by different
forms of breathing techniques, meditation, and relaxation (Jerath
et al., 2015), as well as by yoga and TCC (Benson, 1996;
Telles et al., 2000; Oakley and Evans, 2014). A non-randomized
study suggested that a 1-week breathing practice decreased the
mean of Post-traumatic Checklist-17 (PCL-17), Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI-21), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)
in survivors of the 2004 South-East Asia tsunami. Their results
indicated an equivalent effect of breathing practice with a
traumatic incident reduction exposure therapy. Moreover, the
effects persisted for at least 24 weeks after the intervention
had finished (Descilo et al., 2010). As a non-pharmaceutical
treatment, breathing control therapy is now wildly used in
dealing with depression (Tsang et al., 2006), PTSD (Descilo et al.,
2010), insomnia (Manjunath and Telles, 2005), and other relevant
mental disorders (Brown and Gerbarg, 2005a). It is also applied
as an adjuvant treatment for patients with physical disorders,
including stroke (Marshall et al., 2014) and cancer (Hayama and
Inoue, 2012). All these lines of evidence confirmed the efficacy
of diaphragmatic breathing in clinical conditions, but we have
shown its benefit for healthy individuals. A previous study has
also reported that a better breathing technique was associated
with greater reductions in anxiety (Sherlin et al., 2010). A 6-
weeks’breathing training course was long enough to cause a
significant decrease in anxiety levels in healthy adults (Chandla
et al., 2013). Evidence from diaphragmatic breathing studies
suggested a significant reduction in the state anxiety after an 8-
weeks’
intervention measured using the Beck Anxiety Inventory
Assessment in adults (Chen et al., 2016), and a decrease in self-
reported feelings of state anxiety and test performance in primary
school students, by a pre-test/post-test, training-versus-control
experiment (Khng, 2016). In the present study, our 20 sessions
of diaphragmatic breathing practice significantly decreased the
NA scores in the BIG. This is consistent with previous results
and suggested a relief of basic NA in individuals’daily lives.
Although we did not detect the time point at which the emotional
benefit occurred, previous studies suggested that even a one-time
intervention could reduce stress, disengaged coping (Arsenio and
Loria, 2014), and could provide certain curative alleviation of
job burnout, as well as other emotional disorders. In that case,
it remains unknown whether the reduction of NA occurs after
the first intervention or after a significant reduction in respiration
frequency. This could indicate that diaphragmatic breathing can
provide an emotional improvement as a potential health care
effect in healthy volunteers.
Breathing Practice to Enhance Sustained
Attention
Sustained attention is critical for maintaining performance over
a period of time. Deficits in sustained attention are major
symptoms for several mental disorders (Winterer et al., 2000).
In normal healthy participants, fatigue, work burnout, and task
difficulty usually lead to poor performance in sustained attention
(Aston-Jones et al., 1999). In the present study, we investigated
the diaphragmatic breathing as a single intervention method
for sustained attention improvement. The results suggested that
20 session’
s intervention provided an improvement in the NCT
score. Indirect evidence supported these results, obtained from
studies about breathing involving meditation (Lutz et al., 2009)
and yoga training (Velikonja et al., 2010). In previous studies,
both long-term intervention (MacLean et al., 2010), lasting
for weeks, and short-term (Tang et al., 2007) intervention, for
a few days, were effective. Consistent with previous studies,
we have detected both long-term benefits after completing
the intervention as a whole in the BIG and an immediate
improvement in the CG. Notably, attention improvement was
gained after 15 min of diaphragmatic breathing, which was
markedly shorter than the 5 days’
training reported in a previous
study (Tang et al., 2007).
Previous
studies
have
hypothesized
that
perceptual
improvements (MacLean et al., 2010) and stress reduction
(Jensen et al., 2012) are the mechanisms by which attentional
improvement is gained. Combining the increase in the NCT
score and the decrease in the NA observed in the present
study, we propose that relaxation gained from diaphragmatic
breathing improved the attention test performance (Amon and
Campbell, 2008; Sonne and Jensen, 2016). From the point of
view of neuroscience, adjusting the imbalances in the autonomic
nervous system is the unique contribution provided by breathing
intervention, and was directly supported by TCC research. It
indicated that the HRV increased when diaphragmatic breathing
was performed, which indicated an activity balance between the
sympathetic and parasympathetic systems (Wei et al., 2016).
Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that diaphragmatic breathing
might modulate cognitive performance by predominantly
exerting its influence on the autonomic nervous system.
Although the neuro-mechanism remains to be clarified, it is
likely that deep breathing could link mind and body together to
regulate the information processing related to attention.
Breathing Practice and Physiological
Responses
Cortisol is a reliable indicator of stress (Feder et al., 2009),
because its concentration increases when having to cope with
stressful events. We employed salivary cortisol as a measure
of physiological response in the present study to estimate
the neurophysiological benefit of diaphragmatic breathing. Its

concentration decreased significantly after the 20 sessions’
intervention, which was consistent with previous results from
parents of children and adolescents with diabetes type 1 (Tsiouli
et al., 2014). This result was consistent with previous studies
and indicated that breathing practice reduced the stress-related
physiological response level in healthy volunteers.
Cortisol is also closely associated with the HPA axis (Clow
et al., 2010), which can involuntarily control metabolism,
immunity, and some mental processing, including memory and
emotional appraisal (Pariante and Lightman, 2008), and can
easily be affected by breathing (Argyropoulos et al., 2002). Its
association with attention (van Honk et al., 1998), as well as
breathing practice, cognitive processing, and emotional arousal
is strong. It has been suggested that the sympatho-vagal stress
response returns to an optimal balance at 4.5–
5.5 bpm breathing
in most adults (Lehrer et al., 2010), but no direct evidence
has illuminated the potential mechanism of this physiological
effect.
A hypothesis provided by Jerath et al. (2015) suggested that
breathing stimulates vagal activation of GABA pathways from
the prefrontal cortex and insula, to inhibit amygdala over-
activity (Brown et al., 2013). A tuning function of the brain
toward a parasympathetically driven mode and positive states
was observed in the left insula and left orbitofrontal cortex with
increasing yoga experience (Villemure et al., 2015). Evidence
from brain imaging studies has supported this hypothesis. These
results suggested that long and regular breathing-involving
meditation practice significantly deactivated the limbic system
(Kalyani et al., 2011) and rostral prefrontal cortex (Tomasino
and Fabbro, 2016), and increased the activation of the right
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) while performing an
attention-focused task. Moreover, specific changes, such as
an increased cortical thickness (Wei et al., 2013), prefrontal-
hippocampus functional connectivity (Tao et al., 2016), and
a decreased regional homogeneity in the DLPFC (Wei et al.,
2014), were also detected during the resting state among TCC
senior practitioners. A structural change was proposed according
to the autonomic nervous evidence, and was supported by
an absence of age-related gray matter decline in senior yoga
practitioners, as seen on structural MRI (Villemure et al., 2015).
All these results suggested that the prefrontal cortex served as
the predominant commander, supervising the activity from the
limbic system, and modulating the activity of the autonomic
nervous system.
Limitations
In the present study, we employed healthy volunteers as our
target population. In that case, we estimated the improvement
in mood and cognition and the physiological response of stress,
rather than clinical symptoms, such as anxiety, depression,
attentional impairment, or other stress-related pathological
symptoms. In comparison to a previous study, our results
investigated the application of diaphragmatic breathing as a daily
health care for health population. Some of the limitations of
the present study should be acknowledged. First, we discussed
the diaphragmatic breathing benefits from the points of view
of emotion, cognition, and physiology, respectively, rather than
by combining these three aspects together to obtain further
mechanism-related results. Therefore, we have deduced a limited
contribution to elucidating the underlying associations between
cognitive progressing, affective improvement, and physiological
change. Moreover, in terms of the neuroendocrine response,
the cortisol levels were reduced after a 20 interventions, but no
reference criteria were provided to demonstrate whether this
decrease resulted in a real physiological benefit or was only
statistically significant.
In future studies, it would be interesting to investigate the
time-course between NA reduction and a sustained attention
score increase. We expect that a time-course would elucidate
the association between emotional and cognitive benefit, and
allow testing of the hypothesis that the relaxation induced by
diaphragmatic breathing relieves stress and thereby benefits
cognitive possessing.
CONCLUSION
The present study illustrates the potential for diaphragmatic
breathing practice to improve cognitive performance and reduce
negative subjective and physiological consequences of stress in
healthy adults. Despite the promise of diaphragmatic breathing
practice in supporting function and health, further investigation
is needed to delineate mechanisms that underlie these benefits.
