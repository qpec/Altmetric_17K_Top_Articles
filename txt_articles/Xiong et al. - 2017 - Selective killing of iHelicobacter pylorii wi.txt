Current clinical treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, the main
etiological factor in the development of gastritis, gastric ulcers, and
gastric carcinoma, requires a combination of at least two antibiotics
and one proton pump inhibitor. However, such triple therapy suffers
from progressively decreased therapeutic efficacy due to the drug
resistance and undesired killing of the commensal bacteria due to
poor selectivity. Here, we report the development of antimicrobial
polypeptide-based monotherapy, which can specifically kill H. pylori
under acidic pH in the stomach while inducing minimal toxicity to
commensal bacteria under physiological pH. Specifically, we designed
a class of pH-sensitive, helix–coil conformation transitionable antimi-
crobial polypeptides (HCT-AMPs) (PGA)m-r-(PHLG-MHH)n, bearing
randomly distributed negatively charged glutamic acid and posi-
tively charged poly(γ-6-N-(methyldihexylammonium)hexyl-L-glutamate)
(PHLG-MHH) residues. The HCT-AMPs showed unappreciable toxicity at
physiological pH when they adopted random coiled conformation. Un-
der acidic condition in the stomach, they transformed to the helical
structure and exhibited potent antibacterial activity against H. pylori,
including clinically isolated drug-resistant strains. After oral gavage, the
HCT-AMPs afforded comparable H. pylori killing efficacy to the triple-
therapy approach while inducing minimal toxicity against normal tis-
sues and commensal bacteria, in comparison with the remarkable kill-
ing of commensal bacteria by 65% and 86% in the ileal contents and
feces, respectively, following triple therapy. This strategy renders an
effective approach to specifically target and kill H. pylori in the stomach
while not harming the commensal bacteria/normal tissues.

I
t is widely accepted that Helicobacter pylori, with 50% of the
population worldwide infected, is the main etiological factor
for the development of gastritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric car-
cinoma (1–4). To eradicate H. pylori, triple therapy is recom-
mended as first-line therapy in the clinical setting, which involves
the use of a combination of two antibiotics for optimal bacterial
killing and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for increasing the gastric
pH to enhance the antimicrobial activity and stability of antibiotics
in the gastric fluid (5–8). However, the combination therapy is often
associated with various side effects (9, 10). In particular, it leads to
undesired elimination of commensal bacteria which are closely re-
lated to various physiological and metabolic processes (11–13), the
development of the immune system (13–15), and a range of diseases,
such as inflammatory bowel disease (16, 17), colon cancer (18, 19),
Parkinson’s disease (20), obesity (21–23), diabetes (24), atheroscle-
rosis (25, 26), and allergy (27, 28). For example, gut microbiota
play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis, and colorectal
cancer patients show significantly reduced microbial diversity in
feces (18, 19). In addition, the efficacy of triple therapy is hurdled
by the constant increment of drug resistance, and the resistance to
any of the three drugs will make the treatment end with failure
(29–31). The antimicrobial activity of antibiotics could also be
insufficient to eradicate bacteria for the patients that are acid
hypersecretors or extensive metabolizers, wherein PPI fails to in-
crease the gastric pH (32, 33). To address these critical issues,
anti-H. pylori therapy should be designed to feature selective
killing of H. pylori with potentially diminished resistance.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have recently emerged as
promising antimicrobial candidates, which are capable of disrupting
bacterial membrane structure to combat multidrug-resistant microbes
(34–39). It is shown that AMPs can kill H. pylori in vivo as a single
agent (40–42). However, these antimicrobial agents often suffer from
high cytotoxicity (e.g., hemolysis), poor proteolytic stability, and low
selectivity (37, 43). We recently developed a class of radially am-
phiphilic (RA) antimicrobial polypeptides with a hydrophobic helical
core and a charged exterior shell, affording potent antimicrobial
Significance
Clinical treatment of Helicobacter pylori using combination
therapy is greatly challenged by the undesired killing of com-
mensal bacteria and progressive development of drug re-
sistance. To address these issues, we developed pH-sensitive,
helix–coil conformation transitionable, antimicrobial polypep-
tides as a single therapeutic agent to selectively kill H. pylori
under acidic condition in the stomach with minimal toxicity to
commensal bacteria and diminished drug resistance. Through
the control of the secondary structure transition, the poly-
peptides showed unappreciable toxicity to commensal bacteria
and tissues at physiological pH when they adopted random
coiled conformation, while the restoration of helical structure
in the acidic stomach allowed the polypeptide to regain
membrane disruptive capability to effectively and selectively
kill H. pylori, including drug-resistant strains.

 activity that are associated with their helical structure (44, 45). While
these RA polypeptides afford several advantages over conventional
AMPs, such as simplicity in design and stability against proteases
(44), they lack the capability of differentiating pathogenic bacteria
from commensal bacteria, which will cause nonspecific killing of
commensal bacteria when applied for anti-H. pylori therapy.
Considering that H. pylori thrive in the stomach under unique
acidic condition (with a mean gastric pH of ∼2 in human) while
commensal bacteria reside in the intestine with relatively neutral pH
(6–8) (46–48), we herein developed a class of pH-sensitive, helix–
coil conformation transitionable antimicrobial polypeptides (HCT-
AMPs) (PGA)m-r-(PHLG-MHH)n, with both anionic groups (glu-
tamic acid) and cationic groups (tertiary amine) in the polypeptide
side chains (Fig. 1A). The HCT-AMPs display distorted helix at
physiological pH due to the intramolecular electrostatic interactions
between the anionic carboxylate and cationic amine groups, ulti-
mately leading to minimal toxicity to intestinal commensal bacteria,
while under the acidic condition in the stomach, the HCT-AMPs
transform to the helical conformation due to the protonation of the
carboxylate groups and the depletion of the side-chain electrostatic
interaction, which result in potent antimicrobial efficacy against
H. pylori in the stomach. These HCT-AMPs showed compara-
ble H. pylori killing efficacy as clinically used triple therapy in a
mouse model, with inhibited toxicity against normal tissues and
commensal bacteria. Triple therapy killed 65% and 86% of com-
mensal bacteria in the ileal contents and feces, respectively.
Results
HCT-AMPs Display pH-Sensitive Helix–Coil Transition. Random copo-
lypeptides PL2, (PGA)18-r-(PHLG-MHH)20, with anionic glutamic
acid (Glu) and cationic poly(γ-6-N-(methyldihexylammonium)hexyl-
L-glutamate) (PHLG-MHH) residues (Fig. 1A) were developed via
the ring-opening polymerization of L-γ-(6-chlorohexyl)-Glu–based
N-carboxyanhydrides (NCA) and L-tert-butyl-Glu-NCA (tBLG-NCA)
(i), followed by amination (ii) and trifluoroacetic acid-assisted dees-
terification (iii) (44, 49) (SI Appendix, Scheme S2). pH-independent
helical polypeptide and nonhelical polypeptides [prepared with
D,L-γ-(6-chlorohexyl)-Glu-NCA) and DL-tert-butyl-Glu-NCA as
monomers] were synthesized as control polypeptides, named as
PL1 = (PHLG-MHH)20, PDL2 = (PDLGA)20-r-(PHDLG-MHH)25
(SI Appendix, Table S1 and Scheme S2). The structure of the poly-
peptides was confirmed by 1H-NMR spectra (SI Appendix, Figs.
S1 and S2).
The secondary structure of the polypeptides at different pH
value was then investigated by circular dichroism (CD). As shown in
Fig. 1B, the secondary structure of PL2 was related to the charge
status of PGA (pKa ∼ 4.5) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Particularly, at
pH ≥ 5.1, when the carboxyl groups exhibited negative charge,
PL2 adopted random coiled conformation due to the intermolecular
electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged carboxyl
groups and the positively charged amine groups of PHLG-MHH. In
contrast, at pH ≤ 4.2 when the carboxyl groups were protonated,
PL2 restored typical helical conformation as evidenced by the double
minima at 208 and 222 nm, which was attributed to the depletion of
side-chain charge interactions. Distortion of helical conformation was
noted when the pH was adjusted back to neutral (Fig. 1C). In con-
sistence with such findings, PL1 containing only the cationic PHLG-
MHH segment displayed stable helical conformation independent of
pH change (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). PDL2, a racemic analog of PL2,
also demonstrated pH-independent nonhelical conformation.
HCT-AMPs Selectively Kill H. pylori in Vitro. With respect to its pH-
responsive secondary structure, the HCT-AMP is expected to
show low toxicity at neutral pH while showing high antibacterial
activity against H. pylori in the acidic gastric environment. To test
this hypothesis, we first evaluated the hemolytic activity of the
polypeptides at pH 7.4. PL2 and PDL2, affording random coiled
structure at pH 7.4, which showed no hemolytic activity at a high
concentration up to 70 μM, while PL1 with stable helical struc-
ture caused remarkable hemolysis at 10 μM, which further sub-
stantiated the helical conformation-dependent membrane toxicity
against erythrocytes (Fig. 2A). Additionally, PL2 showed low an-
tibacterial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α and MG1655 at
pH 7.4, affording the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
higher than 70 μM. Such results suggest that PL2 would not kill
commensal bacteria in the intestine with relatively neutral pH.
We then determined the bactericidal activity of HCT-AMPs
against H. pylori SS1 strain under various pH conditions. Upon
incubation of SS1 with PL2 at pH 7.4 for 1 h, no bactericidal
activity was noted. However, notable bacterial killing was achieved
by PL2 at pH 4.0, and further decreased pH value correlated to
higher bactericidal activity (Fig. 2B). As a comparison, the non-
helical PDL2 exhibited unappreciable bactericidal activity at both
pH 7.4 and 3.0 and the helical PL1 killed H. pylori SS1 at both
conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 B and C). These results collectively
indicate that the restoration of helical structure is essential for PL2
to selectively kill H. pylori under the gastric acidic condition, and the
loss of helical conformation under intestinal neutral condition may
contribute to the low toxicity against commensal bacteria.
A combination of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin
(OAC) is used for the treatment of H. pylori infection in clinic
(8). We further explored the bactericidal activity of these anti-
biotics under the same condition to allow direct comparison with
PL2. Although the MIC of amoxicillin and clarithromycin against
SS1 was as low as 0.13 and 0.07 μM, respectively, amoxicillin and
clarithromycin only killed ∼40% and ∼60% of the bacteria at
pH 7.4 after 1 h incubation at high concentrations of 273.7 and
133.7 μM, respectively, indicating the slow function of antibiotics
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). Moreover, these two antibiotics showed
no bactericidal activity against SS1 at pH 3.0, rationalizing why
PPI is demanded to raise the pH of the stomach to potentiate the
antibiotic-mediated treatment of H. pylori infection in vivo. A
combination of OAC effectively killed SS1 in 1 h at both pH 7.4 and
3.0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B). The antibacterial activity of OAC at
pH 3.0 was attributed to the bacterial killing effect of omeprazole,
while a combination of amoxicillin and clarithromycin (AC) showed
no antibacterial activity at pH 3.0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C). It should

 be noted that omeprazole performs differently in vitro and in vivo.
Omeprazole is used for the increase of the gastric pH to enhance
the antimicrobial activity and stability of antibiotics in the gastric
fluid in vivo (5–8). It suppresses stomach acid secretion via specific
inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase system found at the secretory
surface of gastric parietal cells. Because of such unique mechanism,
omeprazole cannot increase the pH value of the acidic medium
during the bacterial killing study in vitro. Instead, omeprazole
readily converts to the active sulfenamide form and causes a sub-
stantial decrease in survival of H. pylori under acidic condition
in vitro (50).
The bactericidal mechanism of HCT-AMPs was further ex-
plored by the vesicle leakage assessment as well as bacterial
morphology observation. PL2 was labeled with Cy5 (Cy5-PL2),
and its binding with bacteria membranes was observed using
fluorescence microscopy. More Cy5-PL2 bound to SS1 bacterial
cells at pH 4.0 than at pH 7.4 (SI Appendix, Fig. S6), which was
attributed to the formation of cationcally helical structure at acidic
pH that promoted binding of polypeptides to phospholipid bilayers.
The membrane activity of the polypeptides was studied at both
pH 7.4 and 4.0 by assessing dye leakage from anionic liposomes, a
commonly used model to simulate the phosphatidylethanolamine-
rich bacterial cell membrane (44). After incubation, PL2 induced
great dye leakage from the liposome at pH 4.0 while inducing
minimal dye leakage at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate
that the acid-triggered helix formation of HCT-AMPs allows them
to directly disrupt the bacteria membranes, a mechanism that most
AMPs utilize to kill bacteria. Comparatively, control polypeptide
PL1 induced notable dye leakage at both pH 7.4 and 4.0, while
PDL2 induced unappreciable dye leakage under both conditions,
which well correlated to the helical and nonhelical conformation of
PL1 and PDL2, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig. S4D). In support
of the acid-activated membrane disruption, we further observed
dramatic damage of the bacterial membranes by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) after incubation with PL2 at pH 4.0
(Fig. 2D). At pH 7.4, PL2 minimally affected the bacterial
morphology, consistent with its minimal membrane activity at
the nonhelical state. Control polypeptide PL1 showed mem-
brane disruption toward SS1 at both pH 7.4 and 4.0, while
PDL2 did not affect the morphology of bacteria under both
conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S4E). Taken together, these re-
sults indicate that HCT-AMPs are able to selectively kill bac-
teria under acidic condition via acid-triggered helix formation
and helix-assisted bacterial membrane disruption.
The emergence of drug-resistant H. pylori is the main reason
for clinical treatment failure (29, 30, 33). The resistance to
clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, as
well as rifamycin, has become a serious issue (29, 30, 33). As
such, we further tested the antibacterial activity of HCT-AMPs
against
clinically
isolated
strains,
including
clarithromycin-
resistant J99A-7, J99A-11, J99C-8, and J99D-1 (51, 52) (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S5 D and E). PL2 effectively killed over 90% of these
bacterial strains at pH 3.0 after 1 h incubation at a concentration
of 4.4 μM (Fig. 3A), which further substantiated its potency in
overcoming the drug resistance toward effective anti-H. pylori
therapy. OAC could not effectively kill drug-resistant bacteria
J99A-11 and J99D-1 at pH 7.4. It instead killed bacteria at pH 3.0
in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix,
Fig. S5F), which was also attributed to the bacterial killing effect of
omeprazole (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig. S5G).
The application of AMPs often hurdles by the short durations
of antimicrobial activity due to their rapid digestion by endoge-
nous proteases (37). The RA polypeptide, with densely packed
hydrophobic side chains forming a hydrophobic cortex to protect
the polypeptide backbone amide bonds, was shown to be more

 stable against proteolysis compared with typical AMPs (44). We
herein also tested the proteolytic stability of HCT-AMPs against
pepsin, the main digestive protease in the stomach. After in-
cubation with pepsin at pH 4.0 for up to 24 h, HPLC analysis
showed that PL2 was resistant to pepsin-mediated degradation
(SI Appendix, Fig. S7).
HCT-AMPs Selectively Kill H. pylori in Vivo. We then evaluated the
therapeutic efficacy of HCT-AMPs against H. pylori SS1 in vivo.
We first studied the biodistribution of HCT-AMPs after oral gavage
of Cy5-labeled polypeptides. PL2 and PDL2 showed similar bio-
distribution profiles, with the majority of the polypeptides retained
in the stomach and intestines within 4 h and gradually excreted
within 24 h (Fig. 4A). By collecting major organs 4 h post-oral
gavage, we further observed strong fluorescence in the gastric tissue
(Fig. 4 B and C). Such observation was further supported by the
quantification of the gastric retention of PL2, which reached ∼40%
ID/g 4 h postgavage and notably decreased to ∼6% 24 h postgavage
(Fig. 4D). It should be mentioned that 4 h is a relatively long time
compared with the reported gastric emptying time of mice (3). As
such, these results indicate that HCT-AMPs could be effectively
retained in the stomach against gastric emptying, likely due to the
electrostatic interactions between the anionic mucus and the poly-
peptides that possess positive charges under acidic condition. We
further studied the penetration of Cy5-PL2 into gastric mucosa by
observing the cryosections of mouse stomach collected 4 h after
oral gavage. The confocal image revealed a thin layer of Cy5-
PL2 on the luminal side of the gastric mucosa, confirming the
diffusion of PL2 toward the gastric epithelium and its retention in
the mucus layer (Fig. 4E).
We then infected mice with H. pylori SS1 (1 × 108 cfu per
animal) by oral gavage every other day for four times (Fig. 5A).
Two weeks after inoculation, infected mice were divided into four
groups and treated with PBS (control), triple-therapy OAC,
PDL2, or PL2. PL2 showed similar bacteria killing ability as the
OAC treatment, with a decrease of bacterial burden by ∼100×
compared with the control group. PDL2, although displaying
similar biodistribution profiles as PL2, showed no significant de-
crease of bacterial burden (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that the
formation of membrane-active helical structure is essential for
killing H. pylori. Because the pH in the mouse stomach (∼3.0 when
fed and ∼4.0 when fasted) is higher than that in the human
stomach (53), it is expected that the HCT-AMPs may show even
higher H. pylori killing efficiency in the human stomach.
The toxicity of PL2 was further explored. No obvious change
of animal body weight was noticed following treatment with
PL2 as described above, indicating the low toxicity of PL2 in vivo
(Fig. 5C). To analyze the toxicity of PL2 toward the stomach, we
performed H&E-staining assay, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and de-
tected caspase 3/8 activity of mouse stomach after treatments.
No significant inflammation of stomach or injury of mucosa layer
was observed after gavage of PL2 according to the H&E-staining
assay (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 A–C). PL2 administration did not
induce apoptosis in stomach cells, as measured by the TUNEL
assay and the activities of caspase 3 and 8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8

 D–G). The plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate
aminotransferase, creatinine, urea nitrogen, sodium ion, and po-
tassium ion showed no significant change after the PL2 treatment
(SI Appendix, Table S2), verifying the lack of significant acute
damage toward the liver and kidney as well as the balance of
electrolytes in the blood. The low toxicity of PL2 was further
confirmed by H&E staining of intestines, liver, and kidney, with
barely detectable histological abnormality (SI Appendix, Fig. S9).
More importantly, PL2 did not cause undesired killing of the
commensal bacteria in the ileal contents and feces of mice, while
OAC treatment killed commensal bacteria in the ileal contents
and feces by 65% and 86%, respectively (Fig. 5D). These
results collectively indicate the low side effect of HCT-AMPs
toward normal cells or commensal bacteria.

In this study, we designed a class of pH-responsive HCT-AMPs
as a single bactericidal agent that can specifically target H. pylori
under the acid condition in the stomach. Random polypeptide
copolymers (PGA)m-r-(PHLG-MHH)n were developed with
randomly distributed negatively charged Glu residues and posi-
tively charged PHLG-MHH residues. The conformation and
membrane activity of the polypeptides depend on the charge
state of Glu residues. At physiological pH, the polypeptides
adopt random coiled conformation with low toxicity, while in the
stomach under acidic condition they are converted to the helical
conformation with potent membrane disruption capability to
effectively kill H. pylori. With such design, HCT-AMPs showed
minimal toxicity against normal tissues/commensal bacteria but
in vivo H. pylori killing efficacy comparable to the triple therapy,
with remarkably improved selectivity of anti-H. pylori therapy.
Commensal bacteria have gained increased attention due to
their important functions during the physiological and metabolic
processes as well as the development of the immune system (11,
13, 14). Undesired alteration of the microbiome can disturb the
symbiotic relationship between resident microorganisms and the
digestive tract, and thus induce the occurrence as well as pro-
gression of various diseases, including but not limited to in-
flammatory bowel disease (16, 17), colon cancer (18, 19),
Parkinson’s disease (20), obesity (21–23), diabetes (24), athero-
sclerosis (25, 26), and allergy (27, 28). Recent research has also
shown that the elimination of commensal bacteria significantly
alleviates the efficacy of anticancer therapeutics, including
CTLA-4 and PD-L1 blockade-mediated cancer immunotherapy
(54–56). Therefore, development of therapeutics that can se-
lectively kill H. pylori without harming commensal bacteria is
highly attractive and important. The triple therapy, used in
clinical H. pylori treatment, killed 65% and 86% of the com-
mensal bacteria in the ileal contents and feces, respectively,
while the pH-sensitive HCT-AMPs showed unappreciable tox-
icity against commensal bacteria (Fig. 5D). This strategy there-
fore represents an ideal and promising approach to target and
selectively kill H. pylori in the stomach without provoking dam-
age to commensal bacteria.
Apart from the undesired toxicity, the triple therapy also
suffers from the progressive increase of drug resistance that
undermines its therapeutic efficacy against H. pylori-induced
gastric diseases (29–31, 33, 57). High resistance rates are noted
for clinically used antibiotics, such as 60–70% for metronidazole,
20–38% for clarithromycin, and 30–38% for levofloxacin (57). In
the current study, HCT-AMPs kill bacteria mainly by disrupting
the membrane integrity (Fig. 2D), a highly destructive mechanism
for bacterial killing with low susceptibility for resistance develop-
ment (34–37, 58, 59). As such, we demonstrated that HCT-AMPs
could effectively kill clinically isolated drug-resistant bacterial
strains (Fig. 3A). The clinical success of triple therapy also faces
great hurdles by the resistance to PPI, because in many patients,
PPI cannot effectively increase their gastric pH, thus leading to
low antimicrobial activity of antibiotics in the gastric fluid (32, 33).
The HCT-AMPs developed herein kill H. pylori under acidic con-
dition as a single agent, and they exhibited increased anti-H. pylori
efficacy with the decrease of pH (Fig. 2B), effectively bypassing the
problem of PPI resistance. Based on these understandings, it is
expected that the HCT-AMPs would outperform the classical triple
therapy toward anti-H. pylori therapy.
In conclusion, we developed a class of pH-sensitive HCT-
AMPs as a single therapeutic agent to target and selectively treat
H. pylori infection in the stomach. The HCT-AMPs can specifically
kill H. pylori, including drug-resistant strains, under acidic conditions,
and showed minimal toxicity against normal tissues/commensal
bacteria. The pH-sensitive HCT-AMPs greatly outperform the tri-
ple therapy that suffers from undesired toxicity as well as drug re-
sistance. This strategy therefore provides a safe and effective
approach to overcome the critical challenges in the treatment of

Anti-H. pylori efficacy of HCT-AMPs in vivo. (A) The study protocol of H. pylori inoculation, infection development, and treatments in C57BL/6J mice.
Each mouse was administered with SS1 (OD600 = 2, 0.2 mL) intragastrically through oral gavage every other day for four times (on days 1, 3, 5, and 7, re-
spectively), and the infection was allowed to develop for 2 wk. Mice were then treated with control (PBS), triple therapy (OAC, omeprazole 400 μmol/kg,
amoxicillin 68 μmol/kg, and clarithromycin 19.1 μmol/kg), PDL2, and PL2 (2.6 μmol/kg) once daily for a consecutive 3 d. (B) Bacterial burden in the stomach of

 H. pylori-induced gastric diseases, and would render promising
utilities toward anti-H. pylori therapy.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Labs (Bar
Harbor, ME) for the efficacy studies and biodistribution studies. Feed and
water were available ad Librium. Artificial light was provided in a 12 h/12 h
cycle. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Illinois In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University of Illinois
at Urbana–Champaign. For the toxicity studies, male ICR mice (6–8 weeks,
18–22 g) were obtained from Shanghai Slaccas Experimental Animal Co.,
Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and were housed in a specific-pathogen–free room.
The animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee, Soochow University.
PL2 was synthesized via the reaction of PCHLG20-r-PtBLG18 with N-
methyldihexylamine followed by removal of the tert-butyl group by trifluor-
acetic acid. Details describing preparation and characterization of HCT-AMPs,
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial assays, and hemolytic assay can be found in
SI Appendix.
