Abstract
Objectives The aim of this study was to assess patients’ views
and expectations with regard to neovascular age-related macular
degeneration (nAMD) and intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (IVT).
Methods We conducted a multicenter, non-interventional,
prospective cohort study including nAMD patients treated
with IVT in Germany. Patients with at least one IVT before
study enrollment and aged ≥50 years were included. Three
telephone interviews were conducted during a 12-month ob-
servational period. Here, patient’s beliefs/expectations with
regard to the nAMD disease and the IVT treatment were
discussed. Only patients who completed all three phone inter-
views were included in the analyses. We used a two-step clus-
ter analysis to identify patient clusters regarding specific pa-
tient attitudes towards nAMD and its treatment.
Results Three hundred and thirty-two patients completed all
interviews (mean age of 76.4 ± 7.2 years, 59.0% women). Out
of these, 57.8% acknowledged that they needed general assis-
tance in daily life, while 77.4% stated being able to attend
general medical appointments on their own. However,
64.7% needed a driver or an accompanying person to attend
their IVT appointments.
In addition, 3.9% of the patients were afraid of IVT side
effects. Also, 87.3% and 43.1% of the patients could name their
disease or the anti-VEGF drug administered, respectively. More
than three-quarters of the patients (83.1%) were aware of possible
consequences of nAMD by stating vision loss or blindness, but
only 16.6% knew that nAMD is a chronic disease.
Generally, patients were optimistic: 70.2%, 5.1% and
13.0% of them expected stable visual acuity (VA), a signifi-
cant improvement or expected worsening of VA in the next
year, respectively. Almost two thirds of patients who provided
their therapy expectations (47.0%) anticipated fewer
injections/discontinuation of IVT.
We identified five patient clusters differing significantly from
each other with regard to four variables: being afraid of IVT,
nAMD disease awareness, optimism with regard to effectiveness
of IVT, and nAMD disease and treatment knowledge.
Conclusions Only a minority of patients is aware of the
chronic nature of nAMD. To motivate patients to accept a
life-long IVT treatment, physicians and caregivers must know
that there exist different patient types with significant differ-
ences in communication needs.

Introduction
Recent evidence shows that anti-VEGF treatment of neovascular
age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) with ranibizumab and
bevacizumab is not as effective in the everyday clinical setting as
in clinical trials [1–7]. Observational studies with ranibizumab

 have shown that a treatment regimen with monthly eye exami-
nations has not been established in everyday clinical practice [1,
6, 8–10]. Also, fewer injections are given in the everyday clinical
setting than in prospective clinical studies [8]. It can be assumed
that treatment-related causes, such as the logistics of arranging
monthly follow-ups and regular injections, and healthcare
system-related causes, such as reimbursement for injections and
co-payments, may be underlying factors in this. Long-term
courses of injections and regular follow-ups are not easy to ad-
here to, especially for the elderly [11], and therefore patient-
related causes such as non-adherence or immobility may also
contribute to the lower effectiveness of intravitreal treatment
(IVT) in the everyday clinical setting, especially if the patients
are to be followed up on a monthly basis.
Generally, every treatment should be tailored to the needs of
the patient and their disease. Treatments that are effective in
clinical trials, but have low patient acceptance, are likely to be
less effective in everyday clinical practice because of inadequate
patient adherence [12, 13]. It is obvious that this is specifically
the case if, as in nAMD, life-long treatment is required.
Acceptance by patients depends on several factors, such as pa-
tient treatment expectations and experiences, but also effective-
ness of communication between physicians and patients [14].
The collection of reliable and valid data on nAMD patient
perceptions and preferences is therefore important [15]. This is
independent of the specific IVT regimen used (fixed injections,
pro re nata (PRN), treat-and-extend, observe-and-plan) as all of
them only work in real life if patients are willing and able to adhere
to them [16].
Recent preference analyses have shown that nAMD patients
are not willing to accept suboptimal visual acuity (V
A) develop-
ment, even if associated with a lower treatment burden [11, 15].
Little research has so far been done into general patient attitudes
to nAMD, treatment expectations and fears, and the subjective
evaluation of previous IVT. Specifically, nAMD patients have
not been investigated to establish whether they have uniform
views in this respect or whether there are distinct nAMD patient
groups in need of different communication strategies.
The main purpose of this analysis in treatment-experienced
nAMD patients in Germany was to assess patients’ views on
having nAMD (including disease knowledge) and to evaluate
intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (IVT) from the patient per-
spective (including treatment expectations). We also assessed
whether specific patient groups with regard to patient views
on disease and treatment could be identified.
Methods
Setting
We conducted a multicenter, non-interventional, prospective co-
hort study observing nAMD patients in Germany treated with
IVT. The study protocol was examined and approved by the
ethics committees of the Universities of Greifswald, Rostock
and Freiburg. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Patients with nAMD were enrolled at twenty-three randomly
selected treatment centers of different sizes (hospitals, office
practices, outpatient clinics). Patients with at least one IVT before
study inclusion (regardless of the administered agent), aged
50 years or older, and willing and able to conduct three 30-min
telephone interviews in the German language were eligible.
Participation in clinical studies for AMD was not allowed. To
ensure that the real-life treatment of nAMD patients is observed,
no further restrictions regarding the treatment course in the pro-
spective observation period of the study were defined. Thus,
patients who decided to discontinue the therapy or for whom
the physician decided to stop the IVT during the following 12-
months study period were also included in the sample.
Data collection
The attending physicians documented basic sociodemographic
and clinical characteristics of patients including time of first
nAMD diagnosis, time of first IVT, development of VA and
central retinal thickness (CRT), measured by optical coherence
tomography (OCT), ophthalmological and other comorbidities
as well as the data of examination and injection visits (retrospec-
tive documentation referring to the last 24 months). All eye-
specific parameters were documented for the study eye (first
eye treated with IVT, in case of bilateral therapy start, the eye
with the worse VAwas defined as study eye) and the fellow eye.
Patients were expected to remain in the study for an observation
period of 12 months, during which three structured telephone
interviews using pre-defined questionnaires were conducted be-
tween September 2011 and October 2013 (mean prospective
observation time: 344.9 days). The decision for conducting three
different interviews was made to minimize the risk of
overstraining of patients and consequently to ensure that the
maximum duration of an interview did not extend 30 min.
Furthermore, the content of the interviews was divided regarding
the sensitivity of the questions; to minimize potential effects on
patients’ behavior during the study period, questions with a more
general nature were asked in the first interview, whereas the
treatment-related and patient behavior-related questions,which
might have had an influence on patients’ views or behavior, were
included in the last interview. The first interview took place ap-
proximately two months after study inclusion, and consisted
mainly of questions dealing with the well-being at the time of
the interview and quality of life of the patient, the living environ-
ment, and the need for assistance with everyday life activities and
health-related activities. The second interview five to six months
after study inclusion covered topics such as the patients’ fears
with regard to the disease and its treatment, and their disease
knowledge and awareness. Patients were asked for a subjective
assessment of vision. This was done for both eyes using a 6-point
2238

 Likert scale (excellent, good, moderate, bad, very bad, blind).
The third interview was conducted at the end of the observational
period. It covered the patients’ beliefs, expectations, a subjective
assessment of vision, and their preferences for different treatment
regimens. This interview also included a discrete choice analysis
of patient preferences; respective results were published separate-
ly [15]. Supplemental Table A shows all used questionnaires.
The interviews were conducted by trained interviewers
who had previously conducted three to five test interviews
under supervision. The data were collected in real time using
an online tool developed for this purpose, which included
predefined data entry fields to reduce the risk of data entry
errors and missing data.
Analyses
We included only patients in our analyses who participated in
all three phone interviews. Missing data were not imputed.
The patients’ responses were analyzed using descriptive sta-
tistics including means and standard deviations (SD) for con-
tinuous variables and patient counts and percentages for cate-
gorical variables. Potential differences of variables between
patient groups were evaluated with the Pearson’s chi-squared
test for categorical variables and with the Mann-Whitney U-
test for continuous variables.
We used a two-step cluster analysis to identify patient clusters
with regard to specific patient attitudes towards the nAMD dis-
ease and its treatment. This approach is the appropriate method
for cluster identification if categorical data and data sets contain-
ing more than 200 subjects are available [17]. The similarity
between two clusters was analyzed using the distance measure
Log-likelihood. The ‘best fitted’ number of clusters was deter-
mined by using the clustering algorithm Bayesian Information
Criterion. After having identified patient attitude clusters, we
described these in terms of size (patient numbers),
sociodemographic characteristics of patients, VA as measured
in study sites, and attitudes to nAMD treatment. Differences
between the clusters were analyzed using Pearson’s chi-squared
test for nominal variables and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney
U-test for independent samples for continuous variables. The
statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software (v. 19.0,
IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Study sample
Of the 480 patients enrolled with nAMD, 332 were willing
and able to conduct all three phone interviews. The patients
interviewed had a mean age of 76.4 ± 7.2 years at baseline and
59.0% were women (Table 1). The nAMD had been diag-
nosed a mean of 1.7 ± 1.9 years (range 0.0–9.3 years) before

 study inclusion, and the first IVT had been given a mean of
1.4 ± 1.5 years (range: 0.0–6.4 years) before study inclusion.
Before study inclusion, the patients received on average
5.3 ± 3.8 intravitreal injections (based on a 24-months retro-
spective documentation period). During the observational pe-
riod, 73.2% of the patients were treated with ranibizumab,
51.2% with bevacizumab, 4.5% with aflibercept and 1.2%
received pegaptanib (double-counting possible). The mean
VA of the study/fellow eye was 0.6 ± 0.5 logMAR/0.7 ± 0.6
logMAR at baseline, and the median VAwas 0.5 logMAR/0.5
logMAR.
The 148 patients who were not willing or able to conduct
phone interviews were statistically significantly older than the
332 patients included in this analysis (mean of 3 years;
p < 0.001) and had a worse mean VA of the study eye (0.76
logMAR versus 0.64 logMAR; p < 0.050) (Table 1).
Home environment and patient well-being
About two-thirds of the patients lived together with their
spouse (62.3%), and about one third lived alone (28.0%). In
addition, 8.1% of the patients lived together with their children
or other relatives, and 1.5% lived in care homes or an assisted
living environment.
The majority of patients (first interview: 71.7%; second inter-
view: 69.9%; third interview: 78.3%) described their well-being
at the respective interview as moderate, and this was relatively
stable over the 12-month observation period (Fig. 1). Only a few
patients (6.6% and 2.7% of patients across interviews) stated that
they felt very well, and approximately one fifth stated feeling less
well. The subjective assessment of vision did not change be-
tween the second and the third interview (interval of about six
months) in 31.9% of the patients. In 32.2% of the patients, the

 subjective assessment of vision deteriorated, and in 19.6% of the
patients it improved. The percentage of patients who assessed
their vision as at least good decreased from 30.7% to 25.0%, and
the proportion that assessed it as bad or very bad increased from
22.6% to 29.5% (Fig. 2).
Independence and need for assistance
Overall, 57.8% of the 332 patients stated that they are gener-
ally in need of help (Fig. 3). Of these, 52.1% needed assistance
in everyday life, 68.8% stated they needed help in dealing
with authorities, and 37.0% needed mental and moral support.
In 14.2% of the patients, healthcare decisions were made
by a third party. About three quarters of patients stated that
they were able to attend general medical appointments on their
own. In contrast, about two thirds needed a driver or an ac-
companying person to attend their appointments for IVT, as
car driving is not recommended for patients after treatment. In
most cases, a relative accompanied the patient. Also, 32.2% of
patients reported that attending IVT appointments were asso-
ciated with difficulties (Fig. 3).
Fear of IVT, nAMD disease and treatment knowledge,
and disease awareness
Moreover, 9.6% of the patients professed to be afraid of injec-
tions in general. Only 3.9% were afraid of the side effects of
IVT. Nevertheless, 66.3% of the patients would prefer tablets

 or eye drops instead of intravitreal injections (IVIs), if equally
effective. The percentage of patients with only one IVT in the
time before study inclusion was slightly higher in the group of
patients who stated to be not afraid (14.7% vs. 10.3%); this
difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.626).
Several disease- and treatment-specific questions assessed the
patients’ knowledge of their disease and treatment (Fig. 4).
Furthermore, 87.3% of the patients named their eye disease cor-
rectly, and 43.1% were able to name the anti-VEGF drug admin-
istered. Then 31.1% reported paying particular attention to their
diet because of their eye disease (e.g., eating broccoli, cabbage,
carrots), and 30.4% were taking special vitamin supplements.
More than three quarters were aware that nAMD may result
in vision loss or blindness (83.1%), and a similar proportion
(86.4%) was aware that regular monitoring of VA is essential
for successful therapy, and 61.2% of patients reported using
self-tests for the subjective assessment of their VA. However,
only 16.6% of the patients were aware of the chronic nature of
the nAMD disease, and most of the patients hoped or believed
that the IVT was necessary only temporarily.
Patients’ beliefs and expectations
The 332 patients were asked how their treatment expectations
had changed since the start of IVT. About half (53.0%) professed
to be as optimistic as at the beginning of therapy; 15.4% stated
that they were more optimistic than at the time of the first anti-
VEGF injection (Table 2). Only 13.6% stated that they were less
optimistic than at the beginning. In line with this, 86.1% of the
patients stated that they would start therapy again.
The patients’ general optimism was also reflected in their
expectations with regard to the development of VA: 70.2%
expected that their VAwould remain the same during the next
year, and 5.1% expected a significant improvement. Also,
13.0% believed that their VA would significantly worsen,
and two patients expected blindness.
About half of the patients (53.0%) were not able to express
any expectations regarding future injection therapy; the most
frequent reason (39.8%) was that the attending physician de-
cided on the course of therapy, and; thus, the patient did not
have any treatment-related expectations.
Based on the patients who stated expectations at the time of
the interview, 37.2% expected significantly more injections and
25.6% expected significantly fewer injections in the next
12 months. In addition, 9.0% believed that the therapy would
cure them in the next year so that no more injections would be
needed, 9.6% expected to discontinue therapy in the next
12 months; and 18.6% expected that the physician would decide
to discontinue the therapy in the next 12 months (Table 2).
Patient clusters identified
Based on our statistical analysis, we were able to identify the
following predictors as dichotomous independent parameters
for assignment of patients to a specific cluster:
–
Presence of fear: patients who stated that they were afraid
of injections or side effects, or both, versus those who were
not afraid.

 –
Awareness: patients who applied regular VA self-tests and
paid attention to their diet, including taking vitamin sup-
plements, because of their eye disease, versus those who
did not apply self-tests and did not care about their diet.
–
Optimism with regard to treatment: patients who stated
that they were more optimistic or at least as optimistic as
at the time of treatment initiation, versus those who pro-
fessed to be pessimistic.
–
Knowledge of disease and treatment: patients who cor-
rectly answered at least four out of the five questions
about nAMD disease and treatment, as shown in Fig. 4.
Considering these predictors, five different patient clusters
were identified (Table 3). The clusters identified showed an
average silhouette of cohesion and separation of 0.7 and thus a
good cluster quality. The first cluster contained 94 (28.3%)
optimistic patients with good disease awareness, without fear
of injections or side effects, and a below average knowledge
of their disease and treatment knowledge. The second cluster
contained 74 (22.3%) patients who differed from the patients
in the first cluster only with regard to their better knowledge of
their disease and treatment. The 65 patients (19.6%) allocated
to the third cluster were patients not afraid of injections or side
effects, had good disease awareness and an average knowl-
edge of their disease and treatment, but were pessimistic with
regard to their expectations of therapy. Assignment to the
fourth cluster was mainly driven by the predictor ‘(non)-
awareness’ of disease and comprised 60 patients (18.1%)
who did not use self-tests and did not pay attention to their
diet. The fifth cluster contained the 39 patients (11.7%) afraid
of injections or side effects or both. Table 3 shows the age and
gender as well as main treatment-related characteristics of the
patients in the different clusters.
Patients in the first cluster showed both a better mean V
A at
the beginning and at end of the observation period than all other
patients. The difference was, however, not statistically significant.
Furthermore, optical coherence tomography was applied more
frequently in these patients (3.5 versus 2.8, p = 0.045), while
VA measures were less frequently conducted (8.0 versus 9.3,
p = 0.009). Patients in the second cluster who had – in contrast
to the other patients – an above-average knowledge of their dis-
ease and treatment were significantly younger (74.9 versus
76.8 years, p = 0.016) and had a longer disease history (time from
first diagnosis to study inclusion 1.59 versus 1.6 years, p = 0.047).
In these patients, significantly more V
A assessments were applied
during the 12-month observation period (10.4 versus 8.5,
p = 0.002). The pessimistic patients (cluster 3) differed from all
the other patients mainly with regard to V
A. Their V
Awas worse
at the beginning (0.73 versus 0.62 logMAR, p = 0.015) and end
of the observation period (0.77 versus 0.60 logMAR, p = 0.009).
The fourth cluster, which consisted of patients with a lack of
awareness, comprised significantly more male patients (56.7%
versus 37.6%, p = 0.007). In this group, fewer optical coherence
tomography investigations were made during the 12-month

Discussion
The main purpose of this paper, based on a survey of IVT-
experienced nAMD patients in Germany, was to assess their
views on nAMD disease, including disease knowledge, and to
evaluate an IVT treatment from the patient perspective. We
also investigated whether specific patient groups could be
identified with regard to their views on and attitudes towards
disease and treatment.
In line with existing publications [18], we observed that the
majority of our treatment-experienced nAMD patients are in
need of some form of assistance. About two thirds of our patients
needed a driver or an accompanying person to attend their ap-
pointments for IVT – in most cases, a relative. Despite existing
treatment experience, about 10% stated that they were afraid of
IVT. About nine out of ten patients confirmed that regular mon-
itoring of VA is essential for successful therapy, and six in ten
patients reported using self-tests (mostly the Amsler grid) for the
subjective assessment of their vision. This generally high accep-
tance rate was met by a high degree of optimism with regard to
IVT, such that about nine out of ten nAMD patients would start
the IVTagain. A cross-sectional survey in a hospital eye clinic in
France (including 58 patients lost to follow-up) showed that pa-
tients’ acceptance is an important predictor of therapy continua-
tion and identified, that in approximately one-fourth of the pa-
tients, who discontinued the therapy, the excessive burden of
periodic follow-up visits and, in nearly 35% of the patients a
subjective dissatisfaction with the benefits of intravitreal injec-
tions, led to therapy discontinuation [8].
It is interesting to note that, whereas about eight out of ten
patients were aware of the possible consequence of nAMD dis-
ease, namely vision loss or blindness, only two out of ten patients
were aware of the chronic nature of the disease. In addition to
this, only one out of ten patients believed that the VA would
significantly worsen in future, and about six out of ten expected
either significantly fewer injections or discontinuation of IVT in
the next 12 months. Contrary to this existing lack of patient
knowledge, a study in Switzerland conducting phone interviews
with AMD patients showed that the patients seem to be willing to
get more information about their specific disease situation [19].
We identified different patient clusters based on their re-
sponses to our questionnaires. To our knowledge, no scientific
analysis has so far attempted to identify differences between
nAMD patients’ opinions and expectations, and to form different
patient clusters in this respect. Comparison of our segmentation
results with the literature is therefore not possible.
A review from 2012 analyzing qualitative studies related to
the perspective and needs of AMD patients concluded, that a
holistic approach to service provision and support for AMD is
needed which considers individuals’ needs and experiences
when coping with AMD [20]. In this context, we believe that
our results are important for the development of future nAMD
patient communication strategies for the following reasons: (1)
Patient acceptance of IVT and patient understanding and accep-
tance of the long-term nature of the disease and therapy are
necessary to maintain long-term IVT. As a result of our investi-
gation, obviously, the majority of patients believe that nAMD is a
temporary disease, which can be either cured by an IVT or pro-
gression can be stopped by such a therapy. (2) Patients differ in
terms of treatment optimism, disease awareness and knowledge,
and fear of injections or side effects. To achieve the high degree
of patient acceptance required, we recommend the development
of separate patient communication strategies for the five patient
clusters we identified. For example, improving nAMD knowl-
edge should be the focus of communication in cluster 1 patients,
whereas communication with cluster 3 patients should target the
generally pessimistic view of IVT.
We acknowledge some limitations of our study. First, despite
random selection of study centers with consecutive patient
inclusion, there may still have been selection bias on the part of
the physicians involved. Second, we were able to conduct all
three telephone interviews in only 332 out of 480 patients
resulting in a possible response bias. A further limitation is that
we included only IVT-experienced nAMD patients. At the
time of the interviews, patients were almost exclusively being
treated with ranibizumab or bevacizumab (96%), mostly
PRN (73%). This might have biased the patients’ opinions
expressed in the interviews. The patients’ opinions could
also be influenced by the different length of intervals between
the last or the next IVT and the interview or by the treatment
experience of the patient. However, no significant differences in
the duration of treatment intervals or number of previous
administrated intravitreal injections were found within the
different patient groups. Nevertheless, it needs to be
acknowledged that we included a general sample of
treatment-experienced patients who could have recently
started their IVT therapy, but could have also started their therapy
before our (retrospective 24 month) observation
began.Therefore, we could not access whether previous treat-
ment experience influenced patients’ opinions, as patients’ views
were not assessed from the start of the therapy onwards.
Furthermore, we did not investigate recently introduced treat-
ment regimens such as the treat-and-extend strategy, which is
widely used, particularly in the USA [21], or the observe-and-
plan scheme. We also acknowledge that we were unable to assess
whether the poor VA and a less-effective treatment in patient
cluster 3 led to a pessimistic view of the IVT or whether the
pessimistic view itself was a contributory factor in the subsequent
poor treatment results.

 Conclusions and implications for practice
Only a minority of nAMD patients are aware of the chronic
nature of their disease. To motivate nAMD patients in
accepting the necessary long-term treatment, physicians and
caregivers must be aware of the differences between the de-
grees of disease knowledge and the opinions and expectations
of nAMD patients. The communication strategy should be
suited to the individual patient. Adapted communication strat-
egies should be investigated to establish whether they result in
enhanced patient persistence.
