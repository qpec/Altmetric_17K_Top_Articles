Virtual reality improves embodiment and
neuropathic pain caused by spinal cord
injury
ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate changes in body ownership and chronic neuropathic pain in patients with
spinal cord injury (SCI) using multisensory own body illusions and virtual reality (VR).
Methods: Twenty patients with SCI with paraplegia and 20 healthy control participants (HC) par-
ticipated in 2 factorial, randomized, repeated-measures design studies. In the virtual leg illusion
(VLI), we applied asynchronous or synchronous visuotactile stimulation to the participant’s back
(either immediately above the lesion level or at the shoulder) and to the virtual legs as seen on a VR
head-mounted display. We tested the effect of the VLI on the sense of leg ownership (question-
naires) and on perceived neuropathic pain (visual analogue scale pain ratings). We compared
illusory leg ownership with illusory global body ownership (induced in the full body illusion [FBI]),
by applying asynchronous or synchronous visuotactile stimulation to the participant’s back and
the back of a virtual body as seen on a head-mounted display.
Results: Our data show that patients with SCI are less sensitive to multisensory stimulations
inducing illusory leg ownership (as compared to HC) and that leg ownership decreased with time
since SCI. In contrast, we found no differences between groups in global body ownership as
tested in the FBI. VLI and FBI were both associated with mild analgesia that was only during
the VLI specific for synchronous visuotactile stimulation and the lower back position.
Conclusions: The present findings show that VR exposure using multisensory stimulation differ-
ently affected leg vs body ownership, and is associated with mild analgesia with potential for
SCI neurorehabilitation protocols. Neurology® 2017;89:1894–1903

Spinal cord damage can cause permanent loss of sensorimotor functions and persistent neuro-
pathic pain,1–4 leading to structural and functional changes in somatotopic regions of the
CNS.1,5 Recently, several studies showed that multisensory processing and the related sense
of body ownership6–8 are also impaired in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI),9–11 suggesting
that sensory impairments in SCI extend beyond unimodal deficits in the sensorimotor system.
Although pain perception and leg and global body ownership can be experimentally manipu-
lated through body illusions using multisensory stimulation,12–21 previous SCI research only
investigated ownership for the upper extremity.9,11,22 Although virtual reality (VR) is becoming
increasingly used in neurorehabilitation23,24 (see appendix e-1 at Neurology.org), it has only
rarely been integrated with multisensory stimulation, in particular for the legs and in SCI.

 We investigated leg and global body owner-
ship in patients with SCI employing VR technol-
ogy, using adapted virtual leg illusion (VLI)12
and full body illusion (FBI),13 respectively, and
tested their potential analgesic effects. In the
VLI, we simultaneously stroked virtual legs and
the patient’s nearest body site with preserved
tactile perception (lower back), investigating
whether such multisensory VR exposure induces
leg ownership and illusory tactile leg percepts.
Based on the findings on cortical reorganization
after denervation,1,17 we predicted that synchro-
nous stimulation of the lower back would result
in a stronger illusion and analgesia than stimula-
tion of a more distant site (upper back). We
further predicted finding differences between pa-
tients with SCI and healthy control participants
(HCs) for leg ownership (VLI), but not for
the global sense of body ownership (FBI), as
tested separately with distinct multisensory
stimulations.
METHODS Participants. A total of 20 patients (2 female; 23–
71 years, mean 47.3 6 12.0 years) with SCI participated in the study.
SCI was traumatic in 18 cases and nontraumatic in 2 cases. The time
since injury varied between 3.5 months and 71 years (17.1 6 18.1
years). According to the International Standards for Neurologic Clas-
sification of Spinal Cord Injury by the American Spinal Cord Injury
Association (ASIA),25 their lesions ranged from high thoracal (T2) to
lumbar (L2); 15 participants had complete lesions (ASIA Impairment
Scale [AIS] A), 3 sensory incomplete (AIS B), and 2 sensory and motor
incomplete (AIS C) lesions. All participants with SCI had impaired
tactile perception of the upper dorsal legs. None of the participants
with SCI had a history of other neurologic or psychiatric disease.
Eleven participants with SCI had chronic neuropathic pain at or below
the SCI level (SCI-pain),26 as defined by a prior clinical assessment.
Demographic and clinical data of the SCI group are summarized in
table e-1. Twenty healthy age-matched participants (2 female; 23–70
years, mean 43.0 6 11.8 years; p 5 0.975) were recruited as a control
sample (HCs).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The local ethics committees approved the study
protocol, which was conducted in accordance with the ethical
standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants were
informed about the experimental procedure and gave their written
informed consent prior to the study (for an example, see e-consent).
Experimental paradigms and design. Virtual leg illusion.
We adapted the VLI protocol12 to the present investigation of pa-
tients with SCI. Due to the impaired tactile perception in legs of the
patients with SCI, we applied the visuotactile conflict between the
seen virtual legs and the participant’s back (tactile stimulation). The
participants sat in a wheelchair and wore a head-mounted display
(HMD; figure 1A). Fake legs were placed on another chair, mim-
icking a sitting posture. A camera was mounted above, corre-
sponding to the participant’s first-person viewpoint. The real-time
video recording of virtual legs was fed to the HMD, appearing as
superimposed over participants’ physical legs, while the experimenter
simultaneously stroked the participant’s lateral back and the
corresponding upper dorsal part of the ipsilateral virtual leg. Thus,
the participants observed the virtual legs being touched simulta-
neously while they received touches on their back (figure 1A). Based
on the findings on cortical reorganization after SCI (i.e., shift of
neighboring cortical areas towards the denervated region5), we
applied tactile stimulation to the lower back (immediately above SCI
level) or to the upper back (distant, control site).
In a 2 3 2 repeated measures design, we manipulated the
synchrony between the stroking of the virtual legs (synchronous,
asynchronous) and the participant’s back location (lower, upper
back). In the synchronous condition, the stroking of the virtual
legs was synchronized with the stroking of the participant’s back.
In the asynchronous condition, the visuotactile stimulation was
delayed (approximately 1 second of delay). Each condition lasted
for 60 seconds.
Full body illusion. We manipulated global body ownership
through an adapted FBI protocol.13 The participants sat in
a wheelchair and wore an HMD. A camera, positioned 2 meters
behind, filmed the participant’s back, which the experimenter
stroked. The real-time video was projected onto the HMD.
The participants thus viewed their own body projected in front
(virtual body) and were simultaneously stimulated on their back
(figure 1B). This visuotactile stimulation (60 seconds) was syn-
chronous or asynchronous (800 ms of the video delay).
Assessments. The VLI was assessed with a 9-item questionnaire,
adapted from body illusions studies,13–15 with items referring to
the experienced ownership for the virtual legs, illusory touch, and
referred touch. The FBI was assessed with a 7-item question-
naire,13 referring to the experienced ownership for the virtual
body and illusory touch on the virtual body. Both questionnaires
contained control items. All items are shown in table e-2. Par-
ticipants rated the questionnaires on a 7-point Likert scale (23,
completely disagree; 13, completely agree). We assessed the
intensity of actual neuropathic pain with a visual analogue scale
(VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst pain imagined).27
We assessed the presence of unusual body experiences with the
Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS).28
Procedure. We first conducted a short semi-structured interview
with the SCI participants about their SCI, related pain, and bodily
sensations, followed by the CDS administration. Before the
experiment started, the experimenter carefully defined the level
above which each patient had intact tactile perception on the back
to ascertain the detectability of tactile stimulations. All patients with
SCI with neuropathic pain rated the intensity of current pain on the
VAS (baseline). The VLI and FBI protocol were then carried out in
a counterbalanced order across participants. After each experi-
mental condition, the participants rated the current neuropathic
pain (only SCI-pain), the VLI, or FBI questionnaire (all partic-
ipants). The order of the VLI conditions was randomized across
patients, and the order of the FBI conditions counterbalanced.
Statistical analyses. The FBI and VLI illusion questionnaire
ratings were first ipsatized using individual mean rating29 (appen-
dix e-1) and then averaged based on the measured component
(tables e-2 and e-3). The VLI questionnaire scores were analyzed
with a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA), with synchrony
(synchronous, asynchronous) and back location (lower back,
upper back) as within-subjects factors and group (SCI, HC) as
a between-subjects factor. The FBI questionnaire scores were
analyzed with a mixed design ANOVA, with synchrony (syn-
chronous, asynchronous) as a within-subjects factor and group
(SCI, HC) as a between-subjects factor.
Linear and exponential curve estimations were performed for
the relationship between the illusion ratings and the time since

 lesion or the SCI level; this was done for the synchronous–lower
back and synchronous–upper back conditions in the VLI and the
synchronous condition in the FBI. The questionnaire data were
linearly transformed to non-zero positive values. To quantify the
level of injury, we considered the SCI level as an integer ascribed
to the ASIA-defined lesion level, ranging from 1 (lesion at T2) to
13 (lesion at L2).10 If the lesion was defined between 2 neurologic
levels, the score was calculated as the average of 2 integers (e.g.,
a T6/T7 lesion was scored with 5.5).
For the subgroup of patients with SCI with neuropathic pain
(n 5 11), the baseline pain rating was first subtracted from the
postcondition pain ratings to obtain measures of pain modulation
(pain change), which were then analyzed with repeated-measures
ANOVA (VLI; 2 [synchrony] 3 2 [back location] factorial
design) and paired sample t test (FBI). The significance (a) level
used was 0.05. One-tailed one-sample t tests were used to infer
whether the pain change is significantly lower than zero (using
Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons correction: FBI:
acorr 5 a/2 5 0.025; VLI: acorr 5 a/4 5 0.0125).
In addition, we analyzed differences between SCI subgroups
in their experience of VLI and FBI: between SCI with and with-
out any preserved tactile sensation, between SCI with and with-
out neuropathic pain, and between SCI with complete and
incomplete SCI. We used mixed ANOVA with synchrony and
back location (in VLI) as within-subjects and respective sub-
groups as between-subjects factors (appendix e-1).
We scored the CDS ratings according to Sierra and Berrios.28
Based on a previous study showing increased occurrence of
altered body perception in SCI,9 we focused the analyses on the
items in the Anomalous Body Experience (ABE) subscale,30 using
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U.
RESULTS Virtual leg illusion. We found significant
main effects of synchrony, where synchronous visuotac-
tile stimulation induced a stronger experience of illusory
ownership for the virtual legs (p 5 0.037), stronger
sensations of illusory touch (p 5 0.008), and stronger
referred touch (p , 0.001), without significantly affect-
ing the ratings of the control items (p 5 0.112). We
found a significant main effect of group on the ratings
of illusory ownership (p 5 0.028), showing that pa-
tients with SCI experienced weaker illusory leg owner-
ship than HC, independently of the synchrony of
stroking (interaction: p 5 0.263). No such group dif-
ferences were found in the ratings of illusory touch,
referred touch, or control items (all p $ 0.153). These
findings suggest that SCI experienced weaker leg own-
ership, but equally strong illusory touch sensations as
HC. We did not find any significant main effect of back
location or interaction effects (all p $ 0.063). We did
not find any significant differences in the illusion or
control ratings between the patients with SCI with
and without preserved tactile leg sensations (all p $
0.096; table e-4), between the participants with SCI
with and without neuropathic pain (all p $ 0.075; table
e-5), or between the participants with SCI with com-
plete and incomplete lesions (all p $ 0.103; table e-6).
A significant exponentially decaying relationship
was found between duration of SCI and the magni-
tude of illusory leg ownership (p 5 0.016) and
between duration of SCI and the magnitude of illu-
sory referred touch (p 5 0.036). Importantly, both
findings were only observed in the condition in which
the lower back was stroked synchronously (other con-
ditions: all p $ 0.081). No significant correlations
were found between the illusory ratings and the level

Experimental setups
(A) In the virtual leg illusion (VLI) paradigm, the participant sits in a wheelchair and wears a head-mounted display (HMD) and headphones. The experimenter simul-
taneously strokes the lower or upper part of the participant’s back and the corresponding part of the dummy leg. The camera films dummy legs from the distance
and angle that corresponds to the participant’s first-person viewpoint, and the real-time video recording is projected onto the HMD. Thus, the participant sees
touch cues applied to the virtual legs while being touched on the back. (B) In the full body illusion (FBI) paradigm, the participant sits in a wheelchair and wears
headphones and an HMD. A video camera, standing 2 meters behind, films the participant’s back, while the experimenter is applying tactile stimulation to the
participant’s back with a wooden stick. The real-time (delayed for 800 ms in asynchronous condition) video is projected onto the HMD. The participant thus sees
his or her own virtual body projected in front and being touched with the stick, while at the same time feels being touched on the back.

 of SCI (all p $ 0.125). Statistical results are shown in
table e-3.
We did not find any significant main effects
of synchrony, back location, or interactions on the
pain change ratings between the postillusion and
the baseline ratings (all p $ 0.147). However, when
comparing the pain change against zero, we found
a significant pain reduction when the lower back
was stimulated synchronously with the virtual legs
(p 5 0.04), but not in any of the other conditions
(all p $ 0.188). However, this comparison did not
survive correction for multiple comparisons: acorr 5
0.0125. See table 1 for statistical reports and figure 2
for a graphic presentation of results.
Full body illusion. We found significant main effects of
synchrony, where synchronous visuotactile stimulation
induced stronger illusory body ownership (p , 0.001)
and stronger illusory touch (p , 0.001) as compared to
asynchronous stimulation, but it did not significantly
modulate the ratings of control items (p 5 0.823). In
contrast to the VLI, we did not find significant main
effects of group (all p $ 0.558) or interaction effects
(all p $ 0.146) on any of the FBI questionnaire items.
No differences in the illusion or control ratings were
found between participants with SCI with and without
preserved tactile leg sensations (all p $ 0.481; table
e-4), between participants with SCI with and without
neuropathic pain (all p $ 0.332; table e-5), or between
participants with SCI with complete and incomplete
lesions (all p $ 0.173; table e-6). No significant corre-
lations were found between ratings on body ownership
and illusory touch with SCI duration or with SCI level
(all p $ 0.052; table e-3).
Concerning pain ratings, the synchrony of visuo-
tactile stimulation did not modulate the pain change
(p 5 0.920). However, the FBI significantly reduced
the pain compared to baseline measurements in both
the synchronous (p 5 0.020) and asynchronous (p 5
0.020) visuotactile stimulation conditions (table 2
and figure 3).
Cambridge Depersonalization Scale. No significant dif-
ferences between the participants with SCI and HC
were found for the total CDS or ABE subscale scores
(all p $ 0.260). However, the participants with SCI
rated significantly higher 2 individual items that are
related to leg/body ownership: “Parts of my body feel
as if they didn’t belong to me” (p 5 0.028) and “I
have to touch myself to make sure that I have a body
or a real existence” (p 5 0.009) (see table e-7 for
statistical results).
DISCUSSION We investigated SCI-related alterations
of bodily self-consciousness through multisensory
body illusion paradigms using VR. In particular, we
tested whether the sensitivity to experimental manip-
ulations of leg and body ownership is affected by SCI,
and whether such multisensory stimulation has anal-
gesic effects.
In the VLI paradigm, participants received tactile
stimulation on their back while viewing, through
an HMD, the virtual legs being touched. This manip-
ulation, when temporally synchronous, is generally
associated with stronger integration (as compared to
asynchronous) of visual, proprioceptive, and tactile
information12; here we show for the first time that it
results in the illusory sensation that touching the virtual
legs is causing the touch on the back (referred touch)
and to a lesser extent in illusory touch on the legs in
both SCI and HC groups. Important for understanding
the effect of SCI on central leg representations, the SCI
group showed a general reduction across conditions in
proneness to experience virtual legs as one’s own, indi-
cating that individuals with paraplegia less readily inte-
grate the available visual and tactile information to

 experience illusory leg ownership. Moreover, time since
injury negatively correlated with illusory leg ownership
and referred touch, suggesting that with prolonged sen-
sorimotor deficits, patients with SCI become even more
resistant in their decreased sensitivity to the VLI. This
may potentially be associated with alterations in central
multisensory leg representations, and stronger reliance
on off-line leg representations, as previously reported
for upper limb amputees and the strength of the rubber
hand illusion (RHI).31
We did not find any differences in the VLI
between the lower and upper back stimulation condi-
tions. Differences would have been compatible with
SCI-induced changes in cortical reorganization in
primary somatosensory cortex (S1), as shown for
hand-face remapping effects in patients with tetraple-
gia during the RHI.11 This negative finding thus
indirectly suggests that other, multisensory leg repre-
sentations (for example, in posterior parietal cortex8)
and not S1 are involved in mediating the effects of the
VLI, also supported by the negative correlation
between the time since SCI and VLI ratings. Alter-
natively, the absence of the stimulation site effect
could also be due to the relatively larger receptive
fields on the back in S1 (as compared to hand or
face), with both stimulations activating closely similar
locations in S1 and in higher-tier areas.32
In contrast to these VLI findings, we found no dif-
ferences between SCI and HC in the FBI, which in
comparison to paradigms where the focus of the

 visuotactile stimulation is a body part (RHI15 or
VLI12) enables experimental manipulation of more
global aspects of bodily self-consciousness, affecting
ownership for the entire body.13,33 In the current
study we extended earlier findings13,34 showing that
synchronous (as compared to asynchronous) visuo-
tactile stimulation induces stronger illusory owner-
ship not just in HC but also in patients with SCI,
suggesting that the chronic denervation of the lower
trunk and legs in SCI does not alter the multisensory
mechanisms important for global aspects of bodily self-
consciousness.13,34,35 We note that visuotactile stimula-
tion in the FBI was applied at a body site with fully
preserved sensory functionality (upper trunk, above
the lesion level), which, however, was also the case
during all conditions of the VLI, suggesting differential
recruitment of multisensory bodily integration pro-
cesses in patients with SCI in both VR illusion
paradigms.
We also investigated whether the present multi-
sensory VR paradigms modulate neuropathic pain.
Despite the overall mild analgesic effects in the
VLI, we observed that only synchronous visuotactile
stimulation in the back condition (associated with
the strongest experience of the VLI) resulted in a near
significant reduction of neuropathic pain. This
somatotopy-related analgesia (and VLI induction)
suggests that this particular experimental manipula-
tion might activate otherwise silent cortical regions
representing the lower limbs, arguing for a potential
central co-representation of pain and the multisen-
sory VLI. We speculate that the stimulation may have
transiently interfered with abnormally altered leg rep-
resentations in SCI, arguably involved in the central
origins of neuropathic pain18,36 and previously
explored using the RHI for alleviating neuropathic
pain in upper limb amputees.18 We found a condi-
tion-nonspecific mild analgesic effect of the FBI,
which is potentially related to so-called visual analge-
sia (i.e., seeing one’s own body already has analgesic
effects in healthy participants)21,37–39 or previously
reported distraction effects of VR.40 Future work is
needed to investigate these differences.
Our results need to be interpreted with caution;
the SCI sample with neuropathic pain was relatively
small and clinically heterogeneous. Although exclud-
ing 2 patients with nontraumatic SCI from our anal-
yses showed only slight deviations in our results (see
appendix e-1), future studies should focus on larger
cohorts of different SCI subgroups with uniform

 clinical presentations and etiology to replicate the
present findings. These studies should preferably
use prolonged and repeated stimulation and test
different multisensory stimulation patterns includ-
ing different body locations. These changes may
boost the currently observed pain reduction and
enable us to draw firmer conclusions about the
paradigm’s analgesic effects. Nevertheless, the
present findings are relevant for the design of non-
invasive SCI neurorehabilitation and pain manage-
ment protocols, suggesting the importance of early
interventions to strengthen multisensory body rep-
resentation in the SCI population. Further work
may also consider testing the current VR method-
ology and its analgesic effects in other acute and
chronic pain conditions (see appendix e-1), such as
complex regional pain syndrome, diabetic neurop-
athy, or multiple sclerosis.

Comment:
Is virtual reality a useful adjunct to rehabilitation after spinal cord
injury?
Spinal cord injury (SCI) has devastating effects on the CNS, leading to dis-
ruption of various neuromuscular, sensory, and autonomic pathways. However,
the changes induced in the nervous system extend well beyond the tracts and neu-
rons directly disrupted starting soon after the injury.1 There is substantial neural
plasticity that takes place throughout the CNS, including the cortex.2 Trying to
improve function and pain after a peripheral injury by intervening at the cortical
level has been explored since the mid-1990s with classic mirror box therapy for
phantom limb pain.3
Pozeg et al.4 have assessed and tried to intervene in spinal cord injury pa-
tients’ perception of body ownership and pain with a more complex approach,
combining virtual visual and tactile input. Their paradigms are clear and the
design is meticulous. They identified decreased leg ownership in the SCI group
compared to healthy controls. Although the numbers were small and the patients
were heterogeneous, the sense of ownership was lower the more remote the spinal
cord injury. Data are not presented to compare patients with SCI with and without
pain.
With virtual reality paradigms addressing both leg and body stimulation,
illusions can produce modest improvements in neuropathic pain. Thus, this article
offers a potentially useful way to address cortical representation in patients with
spinal cord injury. It remains to be seen whether implementing these findings into
a therapy will lead to decreased pain, improved function, or decreased likelihood
to develop deafferentation pain.
