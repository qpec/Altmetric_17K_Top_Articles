Caloric restriction (CR) without malnutrition extends lifespan and delays the onset of
age-related disorders in most species but its impact in nonhuman primates has been
controversial. In the late 1980s two parallel studies were initiated to determine the effect of
CR in rhesus monkeys. The University of Wisconsin study reported a significant positive
impact of CR on survival, but the National Institute on Aging study detected no significant
survival effect. Here we present a direct comparison of longitudinal data from both studies
including survival, bodyweight, food intake, fasting glucose levels and age-related morbidity.
We describe differences in study design that could contribute to differences in outcomes, and
we report species specificity in the impact of CR in terms of optimal onset and diet. Taken
together these data confirm that health benefits of CR are conserved in monkeys and suggest
that CR mechanisms are likely translatable to human health.

 T
he rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) is an excellent model
for human ageing. The rhesus monkey genome shares
B93% sequence identity with the human genome1,2, and
numerous aspects of their anatomy, physiology, neurology,
endocrinology
and
immunology
directly
parallel
those
of
humans3,4. Rhesus monkeys have a lifespan measured in
decades, and develop, mature and age in similar ways to
humans. In terms of ageing this includes greying and thinning
of hair, redistribution of body fat, loss of skin tone, loss of vigour
and loss of muscle tone4–7. With age there are increases in clinical
manifestations of diseases and disorders that also increase in
prevalence with advancing age in humans, including diabetes,
neoplasia, sarcopenia, bone loss, altered immune function and
cognitive decline3,4,8. Like humans, nonhuman primates are
genetically heterogeneous so that phenotypes of ageing are
non-uniformly manifested among individual animals. Variance
can be somewhat offset through comprehensive life-long physical
and medical health records, where age-related changes are viewed
from the perspective of each animal individually. Nonhuman
primates exhibit feeding patterns and sleeping behaviour similar
to those of humans, and a key advantage of nonhuman primate
studies over human studies is that all variables including the
environment and dietary intake can be fully defined. In short,
nonhuman primates are vital models for translating basic
research into clinical application.
A clear understanding of the biology of ageing, as opposed to
the biology of individual age-related diseases, could be the critical
turning point for novel approaches in preventative strategies to
facilitate healthy human ageing. Caloric restriction (CR) offers a
powerful paradigm to uncover the cellular and molecular basis for
the age-related increase in overall disease vulnerability that is
shared by all mammalian species. CR extends median and
maximum lifespan in most strains of laboratory rodents and also
delays the onset of age-related diseases and disorders9–12.
Lifespan is also extended by CR in most short-lived species,
including the unicellular yeast, nematodes and invertebrates.
There
has
been
rapid
progress
in
identifying
potential
mechanisms
of
CR
utilizing
these
models13–17.
These
short-lived species are well suited for the investigation of the
underlying mechanisms of CR due to the relative ease in their
genetic
manipulation, extensive
genetic
and
developmental
characterization, low cost, and significantly reduced timeframe
for completion of longevity studies. A key question underpinning
this body of work is whether the biology of CR, and its ability to
delay ageing and the onset of disease, applies to humans and
human health.
To date three independent studies of rhesus monkeys (Macaca
mulatta) have tackled the question of translatability of CR to
primate species. The University of Maryland rhesus monkey
study was the first to report a positive association of CR with
survival with a 2.6-fold increased risk of death in control animals
compared to restricted18. The primary focus of the study was not
CR however, and analysis was based on comparing 109 ad libitum
fed males and females from colony records at that facility,
including insulin resistant and diabetic animals, to only eight
male CR monkeys. Two other studies focused specifically on the
impact of CR in healthy male and female rhesus monkeys: one at
the National Institute on Aging (NIA) involving 121 monkeys;
and the other at the University of Wisconsin Madison (UW) with
76 monkeys. The same University of Alabama at Birmingham
based statistical team was engaged for analysis of data from
both studies. The UW study has reported beneficial effects of CR,
including significant improvements in health and age-related
survival19, and all-cause survival20. In contrast, the NIA study
reported no significant impact of CR on survival, although
improvements in health were close to statistical significance21.
The basis for the contrasting outcomes from these two parallel
studies has not been established. Analysis of limited published
bodyweight data indicated that the controls were not equivalent
between the two studies20, pointing to fundamental differences in
study design and implementation. Therefore, to more fully assess
possible explanations for the discrepant findings between the two
studies, we have conducted a comprehensive assessment of
longitudinal data from both sites highlighting differences that
may have contributed to the dissimilar outcomes.
Results
Intrinsic differences in study design. Most of the early rodent
CR studies involved very young onset life-long CR initiated post-
weaning, usually in inbred genetic backgrounds. In the 1980s it
became clear that adult onset CR (12-month-old mice) was also
effective in delaying ageing and extending lifespan in rodents,
albeit to a lesser extent than the young onset model22. Many
rodent CR studies opt to feed control animals ad libitum amounts
of food while others provide less than ad libitum amounts arguing
that this strategy avoids the confounding effects of obesity
and reduces variability in food intake among individuals.
With the launch of the NIA rhesus monkey study in 1987, the
implementation of CR was such that the control monkeys were
not free-fed. Food allotments were determined in accordance with
data published by the National Research Council to provide
approximate ad libitum intake based on their age and bodyweight
for the maturing control monkeys without overfeeding23. Rations
were increased to maintain growth and development until full
stature was attained. CR monkeys received 30% less food than
height-, age- and sex-matched control monkeys. The intervention
was initiated as young-onset and old-onset groups of males, and
young, adult, and old-onset groups of females24 (Table 1).
Launched in 1989, the UW study initiated the CR diet in adult
animals only, after full stature was achieved (B8 years of age for
rhesus monkeys)25. Food was provided at levels approximating
ad libitum to control animals. To accommodate heterogeneity in
the feeding behaviours within the cohort, the ad libitum reference

 for each individual was established using baseline food intake
measured over 3–6 months, and CR was implemented on a
per-individual basis. The rationale for these design features at
UW was to implement a study as it might have been conducted in
humans.
The source of the monkeys in each cohort and the population
type represented is also a point of difference for the two studies.
The UW monkeys were born and raised at the Wisconsin
National Primate Research Center and were all of Indian origin.
The NIA monkeys were sourced from several locations and
included monkeys of both Indian and Chinese origin. Chinese
male rhesus monkeys are generally heavier and longer than their
Indian counter parts with the reverse being the case for females,
and Chinese rhesus monkeys are also thought to exhibit greater
sexual dimorphism26. Monkeys of different origin are sufficiently
genetically different that they can be distinguished using a panel
of single nucleotide polymorphisms27. Apart from population
differences, rhesus monkeys share a similar degree of inter-
individual genetic variation as humans28. In this way, the
contribution of population type to differences in outcomes of
the two studies as opposed to the contribution of individual
genetic heterogeneity is difficult to ascertain.
The diet compositions were another important difference
between the two studies. First, the source of diet components was
different. A naturally sourced diet was employed at the NIA
facility to ensure that micronutrients such as phytochemicals and
trace minerals were provided, acknowledging that there was
potential for seasonal variation. In contrast, a semi-purified diet
was employed at UW to ensure that intake could be fully defined
and consistent throughout the course of the study. Second,
although diets at both locations had a similar caloric density, the
relative
macronutrient
composition
of
the
diets
was
not
equivalent (Table 2). Compared to the UW diet, the NIA diet
was lower in fat, higher in protein and higher in fibre. Finally, the
nutrient content of the diets was also different. At both locations
diets containedB60% carbohydrates by weight, but sucrose
comprised less than 7% of total carbohydrates at NIA and 45%
of total carbohydrates at UW. Diets at both locations were replete
for vitamins that were provided at or above the recommended
daily allowance.
Feeding practices also differed between studies. At NIA, the
monkeys were fed two meals at B6:30 and 13:00 each day. Any
food remaining after the morning meal was removed after about
3 h, and a low calorie treat was provided, typically in the form of a
small piece of fruit. The afternoon meal was not removed so that
monkeys had access to food at night. At UW, all monkeys were
fed in the morning atB8:00 and any remaining food was
removed at B16:00 when a treat of fresh fruit or vegetable, which
was quickly and completely eaten, was provided. Food allotment
for control animals was adjusted to ensure that there was always
some uneaten food to be removed at the end of the day. In this
way UW animals were ad libitum fed during the day but food
deprived overnight. While there were considerable differences in
study design as outlined above, it should be noted that animal
housing and routine animal care were equivalent at NIA and UW
primate facilities. This included identical housing conditions,
temperature and humidity range, light cycles, and the use of tap
water, which was continuously available. Both studies included
animal monitoring several times per day, and a designated
veterinary staff that inspected the animals routinely and provided
outstanding care as needed.
Impact of CR on survival. The initial goal of both NIA and UW
studies was to determine the impact of CR on the health of rhesus
monkeys, as it was not a foregone conclusion that CR would be
an appropriate intervention in long-lived species. The investiga-
tion of the impact of CR on longevity was not considered a
primary outcome at either study location. Even though 121
monkeys were enrolled in the NIA study, the differences in age of
onset (from 1 to 23 years) precluded the animals from being
grouped together for data analyses. Although the age range for
time of onset is smaller for the UW study (ages 7–15), with only
38 outbred genetically distinct monkeys per group (including
both sexes), it seemed unlikely that the study would have the
statistical power required to test CR’s effect on longevity. While
neither study reports longevity data, both studies have yielded
survival data. For rhesus monkeys in captivity, the previously
reported median survival was B26 years of age, 10% survival was
B35 years of age and maximal survival was B40 years of age29.
Mortality curves were generated separately for UW and NIA
(Fig. 1). Survival estimates for monkeys at both sites were
calculated based on data captured up to July 2015 using the three
most common statistical methods: Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method; Cox proportional hazard regression and parametric
survival analysis assuming a Weibull distribution (Table 3).
Because the Weibull distribution is a special case of the
generalized extreme value distribution, it can accommodate
estimation of the upper quantiles of a survival distribution and
maximal lifespan, especially when there are censored data due to
animals that remain alive30.
In the UW adult-onset study, the estimated survival of UW
control animals was close to that of the average recorded for
monkeys in captivity (B26 years of age). Considering both males
and females together, a statistically significant effect of CR in
increasing survival was observed (Cox regression P ¼ 0.017;
Supplementary Table 1). The hazard ratio (HR) of 1.865 (95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.119–3.108) indicated that at any time-
point the control monkeys had almost twice the rate of death
when compared to CR animals. The effect of sex on the response
to CR was not statistically significant. Kaplan-Meier analysis
showed that median survival estimates were greater for CR
animals for both males and females (Table 3). In the NIA study

 study (Table 1) prompted a separation of data from the early and
late onset groups. Here and throughout this report, NIA male
juveniles and adolescents (J/A) were grouped and female juveniles
and adults were grouped (J/A). The Kaplan-Meier median
estimated survival was not different between NIA control and
CR animals for the J/A onset groups of males or females (Fig. 1).
Although Cox proportional hazard regression indicated that the
differences in survival between J/A control and CR were not
statistically significant (Supplementary Table 1), CR monkeys
reached 80% mortality before the controls for both sexes. With
38% of the NIA J/A cohort still alive, the survival curves are
incomplete and the impact on survival remains to be determined;

 however, the early mortality suggests that for some individuals
implementation of CR in the very young may confer a survival
risk. For old-onset CR, Kaplan-Meier estimated survival was not
different between control and CR groups for either males or
females (Table 3), but survival estimates were higher than those of
J/A monkeys and UW controls. For both males and females,
survival estimates for the NIA old-onset cohort were comparable
to or exceeded those for UW CR.
Although there were slight discrepancies in the estimated
median survival between the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier and
parametric Weibull estimation methods, the survival comparisons
between study sites using either analysis were consistent.
A certain degree of sexual dimorphism was observed in survival
outcomes where incidence of early death appeared to be greater
for females. This observation might be explained in part by
endometriosis, which is the proliferation of endometrial tissue
outside of the uterus. Endometriosis can occur at relative
high incidence in monkeys in captivity (B25%), and risk is
considerably greater for nulliparous females31,32. Incidence of
endometriosis was equivalent for control and CR groups. For the
J/A cohorts in the NIA study, 12 of the 44 females died of
complications due to endometriosis, and of these the juvenile
onset females were confirmed nulliparous. Females recruited to
the UW study, in contrast, had at least one but no more than
three healthy infants33, and only 2 of 30 females died of
complications due to endometriosis. A further contributing factor
relates to the policy on treatment of clinical conditions. At UW
the policy to treat clinical conditions was implemented from the
outset. At NIA, although acute pain and suffering were always
treated, chronic medical conditions, including endometriosis,
were monitored but not medically treated. A policy change was
implemented in 2010 due to the high incidence of endometriosis.
The power to assess the impact of CR on survival for NIA J/A
females has been compromised somewhat by this one condition.
Biometric and food intake measures from both studies. For
over a quarter of a century during these studies, bodyweight, body
composition and food intake were measured for all 197 monkeys.
Bodyweight was determined in fasted and anesthetized monkeys
2–4 times per year during routine procedures. Longitudinal data
for all monkeys were averaged by age of the animal (Fig. 2a). As is
the case for humans, monkeys often experience cachexia or
end-of-life rapid weight loss. To avoid confounding effects of
weight change that is not related to food intake or diet, data from
the last year of life for each monkey were excluded. To facilitate
comparisons among the cohorts, data were grouped into three age
categories representing young adult (11–13 years of age), late
mid-age (18–20 years of age) and advanced age (25–27 years of
age) (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).

 Considering first the female monkeys, bodyweight for the NIA
J/A was not significantly different between control and CR
monkeys for any age categories. UW CR females weighed
significantly less (17–26%) than controls throughout the study
period, and UW female controls weighed significantly more than
NIA J/A female controls throughout (Supplementary Table 2).
For NIA old-onset females, bodyweight was not significantly
different between controls and CR, and was significantly lower
than bodyweight of UW female controls. In summary, for NIA
J/A and old-onset female cohorts, bodyweight for control and CR
monkeys was not different from each other and all were
significantly lower than the UW controls. Considering next the
male monkeys, NIA J/A CR males weighed significantly less
(19–22%) than their control counterparts throughout the study.
The difference between UW control and CR was slightly greater
(24–35%), with CR males weighing significantly less than
controls. The average peak weight for NIA J/A control males
was B15% lower than that of UW control males, but differences
in bodyweight were significant for the young age category only
(Supplementary Table 3). Bodyweight of the old-onset NIA
control and CR males were not significantly different at either
mid-age or advanced ages, and old-onset NIA male controls
weighed significantly less than UW controls. In summary, NIA
J/A and UW male cohorts showed a clear bodyweight response to
CR, but old-onset NIA control and CR males were not different
from each other and were significantly lower than the UW
controls.
The internet Primate Aging Database (iPAD; http://ipad.
primate.wisc.edu) is a repository of clinical and biometric data
from healthy, non-experimental, captive nonhuman primates
housed at research facilities across the USA. Using data from over
1,200 individual rhesus monkeys of Indian origin, mean body-
weights were calculated for the above age categories for males
(11.6, 12.1, 11.5 kg respectively) and females (7.4, 8.4, 7.8 kg
respectively). UW control and CR monkeys fell on either side of
these averages; control monkeys were heavier than the iPAD
average (B18% for males; B19% for females), and CR monkeys
had lower bodyweight than the iPAD average (B12% for males;
B11% for females) (Fig. 2b). For NIA J/A, control males were the
same to slightly heavier (5–10%) than the iPAD average and CR
weighed less than the iPAD average (B20%), while control and
CR female monkeys both weighed less than the iPAD average
throughout the study (B10% and B20% respectively). All NIA
old-onset monkeys weighed less than the iPAD average for both
control (B15% for females; B10% for males) and CR (B22% for
females; B21% for males) monkeys. In summary, bodyweights of
UW and NIA control monkeys were not equivalent to each other,
and apart from J/A males, were respectively higher and lower of
the iPAD average.
To gain insight into differences in the effect of age and diet on
body composition, dual X-ray absorptiometry measures were
conducted at intervals throughout the course of the two studies
(Fig. 3). Since each animal had multiple measures taken over
time, estimates of the average percent adiposity (fat/bodyweight
expressed as percent) were adjusted for age (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Within groups a main effect of age on adiposity was
detected for NIA J/A and UW cohorts. A main effect of diet was
detected for NIA J/A males and for both males and females from
the UW study, where CR was associated with significantly lower
adiposity. The NIA J/A control and CR females did not differ
from each other in adiposity and neither of the NIA old-onset
monkey groups had a main effect of CR on adiposity. Combining
the data from NIA J/A and UW, a difference in adiposity was
detected between controls on the two studies for both males and
females, where NIA monkeys had significantly lower percent
body fat. Control monkeys from NIA J/A were not statistically
different from UW CR in percent body fat for both sexes. These
data show an impact of age on adiposity in all three groups and
reveal that the impact of CR on adiposity was observed for both
groups of UW monkeys and at NIA for J/A males only.
Food intake was monitored daily at both sites. At UW daily
measures of food intake were used to calculate means. At NIA

 food intake means were calculated based on measures conducted
during a single week per year as representative of typical intake.
Longitudinal data for all monkeys were averaged by age of the
animal (Fig. 4). Data from the last year of life of each monkey
were excluded to avoid confounding effects of end-of-life feeding
behaviours that usually include loss of appetite. Considering first
the females and using the age categories defined above for both
UW and NIA J/A, the controls consumed significantly more
calories than CR at both young and mid-age, but the difference
persisted only for UW female monkeys at advanced age. For the
old-onset NIA, caloric intake was not different between control
and CR. Among control monkeys, UW females consumed
significantly more calories than NIA J/A at mid-age and advanced
age and more than old-onset at advanced age. Considering next
the males, the NIA J/A controls consumed significantly more
calories than CR at young and mid-age and the difference
between control and CR was significant for UW at mid-age only.
Old-onset males at NIA differed significantly in their caloric
intake between control and CR only at advanced age. Among
controls, caloric intake was not different for NIA J/A and UW
males at any point in the study, but old-onset males consumed
significantly less than UW males and NIA J/A males at mid-age.
In summary, significant differences in caloric intake were
identified between control and CR monkeys for male and female
NIA J/A and UW cohorts, but not for old-onset cohorts until
advanced age and then for males only. Comparing between sites,
caloric intake for NIA female controls of both J/A and old-onset
was lower than that of UW controls, and for males, caloric intake
of NIA J/A and UW controls were not different from each other
but old-onset NIA controls were lower than both.
Impact of CR on incidence of disease. The concept of health-
span is a fairly recent development in ageing research, where a
distinction is drawn between chronological age and health
status34. Traditionally, an increase in both median and maximum
lifespan was considered the hallmark of delayed ageing, and
improvements in health were deemed to be a necessary and
obvious component of longevity. The perspective has shifted
somewhat towards greater emphasis on health and morbidity, so
an intervention that imparts improved health even in the absence
of increased longevity, is viewed as a highly favourable and
legitimate example of an ageing intervention. With advancing
age, rhesus monkeys are vulnerable to many of the same
conditions observed in humans. Among the most prevalent are
cancer, cardiac disease, and conditions related to immune
dysfunction and inflammation, and examples of each were
identified in monkeys on the ageing and CR studies at both
NIA and UW (Supplementary Table 4).
Fasting glucose measures were common to both studies and the
longitudinal data are shown (Fig. 5). In healthy adult rhesus
monkeys fasting glucose levels are 64–68 mg dl � 1 (refs 18,35).
For NIA J/A, fasting glucose levels were equivalent for controls
and CR up to B23 years of age, after which the control and CR
males, but not females, began to diverge. Both control and CR
females showed an age-related increase in fasting glucose levels
after B21 years of age. For UW monkeys, the control males had
higher fasting glucose levels than CR from 15 years of age with a
further divergence of the curves after B23 years of age, while a
noticeable difference between control and CR females emerged
after only B21 years. For the NIA old-onset cohorts, fasting
glucose was consistently low for the duration of the study period.
These data point to an age-related increase in fasting glucose
for rhesus monkeys and single out the UW control males as
being predisposed to elevated circulating glucose in the fasted
state. Using multilevel modelling to investigate the relationship
between adiposity and fasting glucose levels a significant
relationship was identified for UW males only (P ¼ 0.005).
A significant age by diet interaction was also detected (P ¼ 0.014),
suggesting that the impact of age on the relationship between
adiposity and glucoregulatory parameters is distinct for control
and CR monkeys.
Veterinarians documented body condition and overall health
of monkeys biannually at both study locations and indicators of
diseases or disorders identified. The age at which a monkey
was first diagnosed with an age-related condition was used
to generate morbidity curves (Fig. 6). Age-related conditions
included
sarcopenia,
osteoporosis,
arthritis,
diverticulosis,
cataracts and persistent heart murmurs, in addition to age-
related diseases including cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular

 disease. Cox proportional hazard regression modelling indicated
that age-related conditions occurred at B2.7 times the rate in
control animals compared to CR for UW monkeys (HR: 2.665;
CI: 1.527–4.653; P ¼ 0.0006). In the NIA J/A cohort, age-related
conditions occurred at twice the rate in control monkeys
compared to CR (HR: 2.091; CI: 1.169–3.641; P ¼ 0.0125)
(Supplementary Table 5; Supplementary Fig. 2). The advanced
age of the old-onset NIA monkeys precluded detection of the first
occurrence of an age-related condition.
The
incidence
of
age-related
conditions
prevalent
in
human populations, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and
glucoregulatory
dysfunction/diabetes,
was
determined
for
monkeys at UW and NIA, with J/A and old-onset combined.
Diagnoses
were
made
clinically
by
veterinary
staff
upon
presentation, and disease-related pathology was subsequently
confirmed upon necropsy by a board-certified pathologist.
Clinically silent pathologies were identified at necropsy. To
compare studies, cancer and cardiovascular disorders are reported
as incidence upon necropsy. Adenocarcinoma was the leading
cause of death at both study sites, consistent with previous reports
on cancer incidence in rhesus monkeys36,37. The incidence of
adenocarcinoma or other less common neoplasms was lower in
CR monkeys at both locations (Fig. 6). The most common
diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in live animals was mitral
valve dysfunction, while valvular endocardiosis, cardiomyopathy
and myocardial fibrosis were detected at necropsy. Incidence of
cardiovascular disorders was lower in CR monkeys than controls
at UW. There was no apparent impact of diet on incidence of
cardiovascular disease for monkeys at NIA; however, incidence
for both control and CR monkeys was lower than UW controls.
Assessment of glucoregulatory function was part of routine
clinical care at both locations, although clinical definitions
representing different disease stages were employed at the two
sites. Similar to humans38,39, insulin resistance occurs in advance
of impaired fasting glucose in rhesus monkeys35,40, which occurs
before transition to full diabetes. At UW loss of insulin sensitivity
was used to diagnose glucoregulatory impairment and was
defined as fasting insulin levels (470 mU ml � 1) and an insulin
sensitivity index (Si)o2(E � 04) as determined by a frequently
sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. At NIA, fasting
glucose
(4100 mg dl � 1),
glucosuria
and
HbA1c
(46.5%)
measures were used to define diabetes. CR animals had lower
incidence of glucoregulatory dysfunction than controls at both
UW and NIA study sites. Multilevel modelling was used to
investigate
possible
relationships
between
adiposity
and
morbidity but no significant effects were detected for any group
from either study. Similarly, for all NIA groups and for UW
males, no relationship between adiposity and mortality was
detected. For UW females, adiposity was associated with a modest
reduction in risk for death (HR: 0.927; P ¼ 0.01) but only after
correcting for age and diet. These data suggest that the influence
of adiposity on survival risk is sexually dimorphic and changes
with age.
Discussion
Data from both study locations suggest that the CR paradigm is
effective in delaying the effects of ageing in nonhuman primates
but that the age of onset is an important factor in determining the
extent to which beneficial effects of CR might be induced. In the
UW study, reduced bodyweight, reduced adiposity and reduced
food intake of the CR monkeys were associated with improved

 survival, with CR monkeys of both sexes surviving longer than
controls, B28 and B30 years of age for males and females
respectively, and longer than the median age for monkeys in
captivity (B26 years of age). Although an impact of CR on
survival was not detected within the NIA old-onset cohort,
comparison to the UW study shows that bodyweight was
significantly lower in both control and CR groups of males and
females than in their UW control counterparts, and was largely
equivalent to that of UW CR. All males and females from the NIA
old-onset groups consumed fewer calories than their counterpart
controls from UW, instead both control and CR were closely
aligned with food intake values of UW CR. Importantly, the
median survival estimates for old-onset males were very high,
similar to what has been reported previously as the 90th
percentile for this species (B35 years of age). Six of the original
20 monkeys have lived beyond 40 years of age, the previous
maximal lifespan recorded, and one old-onset CR male monkey is
currently 43 years old, which is a longevity record for this species.
Median survival estimates for old-onset females, B27 and B28
for controls and CR respectively, were also greater than national
median lifespan estimates, with one remaining female currently
38 years of age. The clear benefit in survival estimates for
monkeys within the old-onset cohort compared to UW controls
suggests that food intake can and does influence survival. The
lack of difference between control and CR old-onset monkeys
suggests that a reduction in food intake beyond that of the
controls brings no further advantage. The minimum degree of
restriction that confers maximal benefit in rhesus monkeys has
not yet been identified but is an active topic of investigation.
Taken together, data from both UW and NIA studies support the
concept that lower food intake in adult or advanced age is
associated with improved survival in nonhuman primates.
The interpretation of the outcomes from NIA J/A cohorts is
more complicated. The J/A cohorts reveal a sex-dependence in
the relationship between bodyweight and food intake that was not
observed in the UW cohorts. The NIA J/A CR males consumed
significantly fewer calories than controls for most of the study,
and this was reflected in a significantly lower bodyweight and a
modest reduction in adiposity. Bodyweight of the NIA J/A
control males was in between that of UW controls and CR
monkeys even though caloric intake was equivalent between UW
and NIA control animals, and age-adjusted average adiposity of
NIA J/A males was equivalent to that of UW CR males. Median
survival estimates for the NIA J/A male controls and CR were not
statistically different at B29 and B26 years, respectively, but
estimates for the J/A controls were numerically equivalent to UW
CR. These data suggest that in the J/A male cohort, the NIA diet
is associated with lower bodyweight, lower adiposity and
improved survival in the absence of CR, and that no further
advantage is gained by lowering food intake or bodyweight below
that of controls. A different picture emerges from the data from
NIA J/A females. The CR monkeys consumed significantly less
food than controls for much of the study, but there was no
apparent difference in bodyweight or adiposity between them.
Median survival estimates for control and CR J/A females were
not statistically different from each other at B26 and B23 years
respectively, and each were lower than that observed for UW CR.
The lack of response in bodyweight to differences in food intake
in the female monkeys suggests that there is sexual dimorphism
in the relationship between food intake and bodyweight in young
animals and in how these parameters relate to median survival.
Finally, there is a suggestion that nonhuman primates differ from
rodents in the suitability of early onset CR. In rodents, early onset
CR is more effective in extending longevity than adult onset CR.
For nonhuman primates it appears that CR, while beneficial when
implemented in adulthood, does not improve survival when

 implemented in juveniles. Furthermore, it appears that CR is not
uniformly tolerated in young animals, where the NIA J/A CR
males and females reached 80% mortality earlier than controls.
Although the numerical values for estimated survival were lower
in CR groups than in controls, the impact of juvenile onset CR on
survival remains undetermined, as the mortality curves for both
NIA J/A cohorts are incomplete.
Data from both NIA and UW studies highlight sex-dependent
differences in nutritional modulation of body composition and
glucoregulatory function, and prompt further investigation of
sex-specificity in the connection between nutrition and disease
risk. In rodent studies sexual dimorphism in the response to
diet-induced metabolic dysfunction has been reported where
males were more vulnerable than females to increased adiposity
and glucoregulatory dysfunction41. It is perhaps not surprising
then that the separation in fasting glucose curves between UW
controls and CR was observed in males but not females, and that
females, despite being on the same diet as males, were not
different in glucose levels between control and CR until after
20 years of age. Although both NIA and UW diets contain
equivalent relative amounts of carbohydrate, the sucrose content
of the purified UW diet is six times higher than the naturally
sourced NIA diet, and the fat content of the UW diet is twice that
of the NIA diet. The implication is that elevated sucrose and
increased fat content could lead to increased adiposity, negatively
impacting glucoregulatory function. All the NIA J/A monkeys
maintained adiposity at less than 25% and were in large part
euglycemic through middle age. As might be predicted, the UW
control males and females had significantly greater adiposity
compared to NIA controls. In the case of UW males, increased
adiposity was significantly associated with higher fasting glucose
levels; however, the association did not hold for the UW female
monkeys where despite differences in adiposity between control
and CR, fasting glucose levels were equivalent through middle
age, and multilevel analysis failed to identify a significant
association between adiposity and fasting glucose. Furthermore,
there is the suggestion that the effect of diet composition is
dependent on intake levels. The UW CR male monkeys, on the
same diet as controls but under food limiting conditions, had low
adiposity and normal fasting glucose. These data demonstrate
that the relationship between adiposity and glucoregulatory
impairment is sex-specific, and the relationship between dietary
composition and glucoregulatory impairment is dependent on the
level of food intake. The significant relationship between
adiposity and survival detected in the UW female cohort also
points to sex-dimorphism in the impact of age and the influence
of body composition on mortality risk. This relationship was
identified for UW females only, presumably because there was a
greater range in levels of adiposity among controls and CR for the
UW females than for NIA females where adiposity of monkeys
from either diet at either age of onset did not differ. The positive
relationship between adiposity and survival in UW females was
identified only after correcting for age and diet, suggesting that
the interactions among health, body composition and morbidity
are sensitive to age and, given the lack of association in the male
cohort, sex-dependent.
The catalogue of pathologies identified in aged monkeys is
shared with aged humans. The definitions used to identify
morbidity
were
determined
by
veterinary
staff
and
were
essentially equivalent at both sites. A shared feature of both
studies is the beneficial effect of CR in lowering the risk for age-
related morbidity by more than two-fold. Factors contributing to
these analyses include a range of conditions that are highly
prevalent in human geriatric populations, such as sarcopenia,
osteoporosis and arthritis. The beneficial effects extended to
diseases that are among the most prevalent in human clinical care
including
cancer,
cardiovascular
disease
and
parameters
associated with diabetes. A lower incidence of cancer was one
of the first health benefits of CR documented and is considered to
be a hallmark of CR in rodents11. The incidence of cancer was
lower in CR monkeys at both locations indicating that tumour
suppression is a conserved feature of mammalian CR. CR also
lowered the incidence of cardiovascular disorders at UW, and
NIA monkeys from either diet group appear to have been
protected compared to UW Control monkeys. The data shown
are based on pathologies identified at necropsy so that final
incidence of both disorders at NIA has yet to be determined. The
impact of CR to sustain glucoregulatory function during ageing
was a further commonality between the studies. Monkeys
presenting with insulin resistance at UW were clinically treated
to prevent transition to diabetes, prohibiting a direct comparison
between the studies. Although the diagnosis employed at the
two study locations represent different time frames in disease
progression, the outcome of lower incidence of insulin resistance
at UW and lower incidence of diabetes at NIA are very much
in agreement. Given the obvious parallels between human
and rhesus monkey, it seems highly likely that the beneficial
effects of CR would also be observed in humans. Reports from
the
multicenter
CALERIE
study
of
short-term
CR
in
humans document changes in bodyweight, body composition,
glucoregulatory
function
and
serum
risk
factors
for
cardiovascular disease in response to CR (refs 42–47). These
outcomes in humans align well with reports on rhesus monkey
CR (refs 48–51), confirming that the primary response to CR is
conserved between these two species, and suggesting that the
underlying mechanisms may also be conserved.
In conclusion, the NIA and UW nonhuman primate ageing
and CR studies address a central concept of relevance to human
ageing and human health: that the age-related increase in disease
vulnerability in primates is malleable and that ageing itself
presents a reasonable target for intervention. The last two decades
have seen considerable advances in ageing research in short-lived
species and investigations of the mechanisms of CR have been
prominent in this work. It will be particularly informative to
determine the degree to which consensus hallmarks of ageing
described in recent publications52,53 also manifest in primate
ageing. The tissues and longitudinal data stored over the course of
these two highly controlled monkey studies present a unique
resource that can be used to identify key pathways responsive
to CR in primates, to uncover primate-specific aspects of
the basic biology of ageing, and to determine molecular basis
for nutritional modulation of health and ageing. Processes
impacted by CR would be prime targets for the development of
clinical
interventions
to
offset
age-related
morbidity,
and
identification of factors involved in the mechanisms of CR will
be pivotal in bringing these ideas to clinical research and human
health care.
Methods
Animal care. Specifics of housing and animal care have been described in detail
elsewhere20,21. Briefly, all animals are maintained according to the provisions
of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (Public Law 89–544), plus its subsequent
amendments, as well as the standards set forth in the document entitled ‘The Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’ (NIH Publication No. 85–23).
Animals rooms are maintained atB21 �C and 50–65% humidity. Room lighting is
automatically controlled on a 12-h light, 12-h dark schedule. Animals are
monitored daily for general health by dedicated animal care and research staff and
routinely by veterinary staff. Studies at UW and NIA were conducted in accordance
with protocols approved respectively by the University of Wisconsin–Madison
Graduate School and National Institute on Aging Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committees.
Statistical analysis. The mortality analysis included all animals with known
diagnoses or cause of death prior to July 2015. For time-to-event outcomes, the

 three most common methods were used: Kaplan-Meier product-limit method;
Cox proportional hazard regression and parametric survival analysis assuming
Weibull distributions30. Analyses were separated by site (UW; NIA), age-of-onset
and sex. For both Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression,
diet group (CR or control) was used as a predictor to test the effect of CR on
mortality and morbidity (the onset of age-associated disease). Cox models were
also used to estimate the HRs and 95% CIs. For the mortality analyses, age at death
or current age for censored values was used as the time variable. Estimated median
and mean lifespans were calculated using both Kaplan-Meier analysis and
parametric survival analysis assuming a Weibull distribution. Bodyweight and food
intake data were analysed using mixed linear models to account for dependency in
the observations due to repeatedly measuring each animal over time. In the
morbidity analyses, the age at which the animal experienced its first age-associated
diagnosis was used as the time variable. Animals that had had not experienced an
age-associated disease but died of an age-related cause were not censored and their
age at death was used as the time variable. For the censored cases where the
monkeys were alive and had not experienced an age-associated disease, current age
was used as the time variable. For censored cases where monkeys had died but had
not experienced an age-associated disease, age at death was used as the time
variable. For all Cox models, the PH assumption was tested by first fitting a
non-PH Cox regression with a CR by time interaction. The CR by time interactions
were not significant in any model; thus, PH models were considered valid. All
analyses were performed in SAS 9.3. The statistical significance level was set at
a ¼ 0.05 for all analyses with no adjustments54. Multilevel modelling was
conducted to explore relationships among parameters.
