Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease in which depigmented skin results from destruction of 
skin melanocytes, with strong epidemiologic association with several other autoimmune 
diseases. In previous linkage and genome-wide association studies (GWAS1, GWAS2), 
we identified 27 vitiligo susceptibility loci in patients of European (EUR) ancestry. We 
carried out a third GWAS (GWAS3) of vitiligo in EUR subjects, with augmentation of 
GWAS1 and GWAS2 controls, genome-wide imputation, and meta-analysis of all three 
vitiligo GWAS, followed by an independent replication study. The combined analyses, 
with 4,680 vitiligo cases and 39,586 controls, identified 23 novel replicated loci, as well as 
7 new suggestive loci, most encoding immune regulators, apoptotic regulators, and 
melanocyte regulators, several of which are also associated with other autoimmune 
diseases. Functional analyses indicate a predominance of causal regulatory variation, in 
some cases corresponding to eQTL at these loci. Together, the identified genes provide 
a framework for vitiligo genetic architecture and pathobiology, highlight genetic 
relationships to other autoimmune diseases and melanoma, and offer potential targets 
for vitiligo treatment. 
 
Vitiligo is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by white patches of skin due to 
destruction of melanocytes in involved regions1. Vitiligo is epidemiologically associated with 
several other autoimmune diseases, both in vitiligo patients and their close relatives2. In 
previous genomewide linkage and association studies we identified 27 vitiligo susceptibility loci3-
6 in EUR subjects, principally encoding immunoregulatory proteins, many of which are also 
associated with other autoimmune diseases7. Several other vitiligo genes encode melanocyte 
components that regulate normal pigmentary variation8 and in some cases are major vitiligo 
autoimmune antigens, with an inverse association of variation at these loci with vitiligo versus 
malignant melanoma4,6.

To detect additional vitiligo loci with lower odds ratios (ORs), as well as uncommon risk 
alleles with higher ORs, we carried out a third GWAS (GWAS3) of EUR subjects. We 
additionally augmented the number of population controls in our previous GWAS1 and GWAS2 
and performed genome-wide imputation of all three EUR vitiligo GWAS. After quality control 
procedures, the augmented GWAS1 included 1,381 cases and 14,518 controls, GWAS2 
included 413 cases and 5,209 controls, and GWAS3 included 1,059 cases and 17,678 controls, 
with genomic inflation factors 1.068, 1.059, and 1.013, respectively. We then carried out a fixed-
effects meta-analysis of the three GWAS datasets for 8,966,411 shared markers (Online 
Methods). Replication was undertaken using an additional 1,827 EUR vitiligo cases and 2,181 
controls.  
Twenty-three new loci achieved genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) for association 
with vitiligo and demonstrated subsequent replication (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 1); 21 are 
completely novel (FASLG, PTPRC, PPP4R3B, BCL2L11, FARP2, UBE2E2, NRROS, PPP3CA, 
IRF4, SERPINB9, CPVL, NEK6, ARID5B, BAD, TTBK2, RAB5C, TNFRSF11A, IRF3-BCL2L12, 
ASIP, PTPN1, and IL1RAPL1), while two, CTLA4 and TICAM1, were suggestive in our previous 
studies. One previously significant locus, CLNK, was no longer significant (Supplementary 
Table 1). Another potential new locus, PVT1, exceeded genome-wide significance in the 
discovery meta-analysis (P = 7.74 x 10-9), but could not be successfully genotyped in the 
replication study and so remains uncertain. Two other loci, FLI1 and LOC101060498, exceeded 
genome-wide significance in the discovery meta-analysis (P = 3.76 x 10-8 and P = 3.60 x 10-11, 
respectively), but did not demonstrate replication. Seven additional novel loci achieved 
suggestive significance (P < 10-5) in the discovery meta-analysis (STAT4, PPARGC1B, c7orf72, 
PARP12, FADS2, CBFA2T3, and a chr17 locus in the vicinity of AFMID) and gave evidence of 
replication, but failed to achieve overall genome-wide significance (Supplementary Table 1). 
Genome-wide conditional and joint analysis9 provided evidence for multiple independent 
 5 
 
association signals at six loci (LPP, MHC class I, MHC class II, TG-SLA, IL2RA, MC1R; 
Supplementary Table 2). 
 
Together, the loci identified by meta-analyses of the three GWAS account for 
approximately 18% of vitiligo heritability (h2 ~ 0.75) (Table 1). The ORs for the 23 new 
confirmed loci were generally lower than those for loci detected previously6, 1.15 to 1.27, 
excepting CPVL (OR = 1.84), ASIP (OR = 1.64), and IL1RAPL1 (OR = 1.77), for which the 
associated alleles are uncommon (minor allele frequencies 0.03, 0.07, and 0.01, respectively) 
and thus were not detected in the previous GWAS due to power limitations. 
To screen for functional relationships among the confirmed vitiligo genes, we carried out 
pathway analysis using g:PROFILER10, PANTHER11, and STRING12. PANTHER and 
gPROFILER identified a significantly enriched network of BioGRID interactions, most significant 
for the GO categories immune response, immune system process, positive regulation of 
response to stimulus, positive regulation of biological process, and regulation of response to 
stimulus. STRING identified a large interaction network (Fig. 1), with obvious juxtaposition of 
proteins involved in immunoregulation, T-cell receptor repertoire, apoptosis, antigen processing 
and presentation, and melanocyte function. 
Considering the 23 newly confirmed vitiligo candidate genes, at least ten (CTLA4, 
TICAM1, PTPRC, FARP2, UBE2E2, NRROS, CPVL, ARID5B, PTPN1, TNFRSF11A, and 
perhaps also IL1RAPL1) play roles in immune regulation. Six (FASLG, BCL2L11, BCL2L12, 
SERPINB9, NEK6, BAD) are regulators of apoptosis, particularly involving immune cells. ASIP 
encodes a regulator of melanocyte gene expression, and IRF4 encodes a transcription factor for 
both immune cells and melanocytes. Four (PPP3CA, PPP4R3B, TTBK2, RAB5C) have 
functions that are not obviously relevant to vitiligo or autoimmunity, though PPP3CA may 
regulate FOXP3 via NFATC2 and is associated with canine lupus13.  
Strikingly, several vitiligo genes encode proteins that interact physically and functionally. 
BCL2L11 and BAD are binding partners that promote apoptosis14. CTLA4 is liganded by CD80 
 6 
 
to inhibit T cell activation15. BCL2L12 binds to and neutralizes caspase 7 (CASP7)16. SERPINB9 
binds to and specifically inhibits granzyme B (GZMB)17. Eos (IKZF4) binds and is an obligatory 
co-repressor of FOXP3 in regulatory T cells18. Agouti signaling protein (ASIP) binds to the 
melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) to down-regulate production of brown-black eumelanin19. IRF4 
cooperates with MITF to activate transcription of TYR20. And the vitiligo-associated HLA-
A*02:01:01:01 subtype presents peptide antigens derived from several different melanocyte 
proteins, including tyrosinase (TYR), OCA2, and MC1R4,6,21. Together, these functional 
relationships among the identified vitiligo genes appear to highlight key pathways of vitiligo 
pathogenesis that are beginning to coalesce.  
An unexpected finding from vitiligo GWAS has been an inverse genetic relationship 
between vitiligo and malignant melanoma risk for genes that encode melanocyte structural and 
regulatory proteins. TYR, OCA2, and MC1R, encode functional components of the melanocyte 
and are key vitiligo autoantigens. IRF4 encodes a transcription factor for melanocytes as well as 
lymphoid, myeloid, and dendritic cells22, controlled by alternative tissue-specific enhancers23. 
ASIP and PPARGC1B encode paracrine regulators of melanocyte gene expression. All six of 
these loci play important roles in normal pigmentary variation8,24, and for all six the specific 
SNPs that are associated with vitiligo risk are also associated with melanoma protection, and 
vice-versa25,26. The inverse genetic relationship of susceptibility to vitiligo versus melanoma 
suggests that that vitiligo may represent dysregulated immune surveillance against 
melanoma27,28, consistent with the threefold reduction in melanoma incidence among vitiligo 
patients29,30.   
Vitiligo is epidemiologically associated with several other autoimmune diseases, 
including autoimmune thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, adult-onset type 
1 diabetes, Addison’s disease, and lupus31,32. We searched the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) and PubMed for the 48 genome-wide significant and 7 suggestive 
vitiligo susceptibility loci for associations with other autoimmune, inflammatory, and immune-
 7 
 
related disorders. As shown in Fig. 2, of the 23 novel genome-wide significant vitiligo loci, 
FASLG has been associated with celiac disease33 and Crohn’s disease34; PTPRC with 
ulcerative colitis35; BCL2L11 with primary sclerosing cholangitis36; CTLA4 with alopecia areata37, 
rheumatoid arthritis38, autoimmune thyroid disease39,40, and type 1 diabetes autoantibody 
production41; and ARID5B with systemic lupus erythematosus42. Of the seven suggestive loci, 
STAT4 has been associated with Beh�et’s disease43, Sjögren’s syndrome44, and lupus45; and 
c7orf72 with lupus46. These concordant associations for vitiligo and other autoimmune and 
inflammatory diseases add to those involving previously identified vitiligo susceptibility loci, 
which include RERE, PTPN22, IFIH1, CD80, LPP, BACH2, CCR6, SLA, IL2RA, CD44, a chr11q 
gene desert, IKZF4, SH2B3, UBASH3A, and C1QTNF64,6. 
A majority of loci associated with complex traits involve causal variants that are 
regulatory in nature47-51, often corresponding to apparent expression quantitative trait loci 
(eQTLs)51. For TYR21, GZMB52, and MC1R7, principal vitiligo risk derives from missense 
substitutions, whereas for OCA26 and the MHC class I53 and class II54 loci principal vitiligo risk is 
associated with causal variation in nearby transcriptional regulatory elements. Overall, at 52% of 
vitiligo loci, the most significant SNPs are within or near a transcriptional regulatory element 
predicted by ENCODE data55,56. At 16% of loci, the most significant SNPs are within an intron, 
another 16% are in intergenic regions without known regulatory significance, and only 16% are 
in coding regions, several resulting in missense substitutions. To assess the general functional 
categories of apparent causal variants for vitiligo, we applied the stratified LD score regression 
method50 to the GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics. As shown in Fig. 3, greatest 
enrichment of heritability was observed for markers in regulatory functional categories, with 
considerably less enrichment of markers in protein coding regions. 
We utilized two approaches to assess correspondence of vitiligo association signals with 
expression of genes in the vicinity. We used PrediXcan57 to predict expression of 11,553 genes 
in whole blood for each study subject, and then test association of expression of each gene with 
 8 
 
vitiligo affection status. We used a Bayesian method to assess co-localization of cis eQTL 
signals in purified blood monocytes with the confirmed vitiligo association signals. The 
PrediXcan analysis found 83 genes with significant differential expression in vitiligo cases 
versus controls after Bonferroni correction (Supplementary Table 3); of these, 75 were located 
within 1 Mb of a confirmed vitiligo susceptibility locus, demonstrating highly significant 
enrichment compared to non-significant PrediXcan results (P < 0.00001). The eQTL analysis 
found that 10 of the confirmed vitiligo association signals showed significant or suggestive co-
localization with eQTL identified in purified monocytes (Supplementary Table 4). Of the 
confirmed vitiligo genes that could be tested using both methods, 6 were significant in both 
analyses (CASP7, HERC2-OCA2, TEF, TICAM1, RERE, RNASET2). For all of these except 
CASP7, the lead SNP was located within or very close to an ENCODE element likely to regulate 
gene expression.  
Like a jigsaw puzzle, the pieces of the vitiligo pathogenome are thus beginning to fit 
together, revealing a complex network of immunoregulatory proteins, apoptotic regulators, and 
melanocyte components that mediate both autoimmune targeting of melanocytes in vitiligo and 
susceptibility to melanoma. For vitiligo as for other complex diseases, there is enrichment of 
causal variation in regions that regulate gene expression. This may bode well for identifying 
potential therapeutic targets, as pharmacologic modulation of dysregulated biological pathways 
may prove more tractable than attempting to target proteins impacted by amino acid 
substitutions.

Figure 1 Bioinformatic functional interaction network analysis of proteins encoded by all 
confirmed and suggestive vitiligo candidate genes. Unsupervised functional interaction network 
analysis was carried out using STRING v1015, considering each of the corresponding proteins 
as a node and permitting a small number of second-order interactions. No first- or second-order 
edges were shared with other nodes by ARID5B, CCR6, CPVL, GPR137, IL1RAPL1, LPP, 
NEK6, RAB5C, RERE, TEF, TTBK2, and UBE2E2. Green, neighborhood; blue, databases; red, 
experimental evidence. Note that SMEK2 is an alternative name for PPP4R3B. 
 
Figure 2 Concordant associations for vitiligo and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 
We searched the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) and PubMed for 
associations of the 48 genome-wide significant and 7 suggestive vitiligo susceptibility loci with 
other autoimmune, inflammatory, and immune-related disorders (blue), and for association with 
normal human pigmentation variation (red). RA, rheumatoid arthritis; T1D, type 1 diabetes 
mellitus; AITD, autoimmune thyroid disease; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; IBD, 
inflammatory bowel disease; MS, multiple sclerosis; MG, myasthenia gravis; AI hepatitis, 
autoimmune hepatitis.  
 
Figure 3 Enrichment estimates for functional annotations. The combined CMH GWAS123 
summary statistics were analyzed using the stratified LD score regression method utilizing the 
full baseline model50. Regulatory, yellow; protein coding, blue; intron, green. Annotations are 
ordered by enrichment magnitude. Error bars represent jackknife standard error around the 
enrichment. For each category, percentage of the total markers in the category is in 
parentheses. Dashed line represents ratio of 1 (no enrichment). Asterisks indicate enrichment 
significant at P < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction for the 20 categories tested (the categories 
conserved, repressed, transcribed, and promoter flanking were removed as insufficiently 
 17 
 
specific). CTCF, CCCTC-binding factor; DGF, digital genomic footprint; DHS, DNase 
hypersensitivity site; TFBS, transcription factor binding site; TSS, transcriptional start site; 5’ 
UTR, 5’ untranslated region. H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac are regulatory 
chromatin marks55.

Supplementary Figure 1 Genome-wide meta-analysis results. The genome-wide distribution of 
–log10 P values from the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis for 8,966,411 genotyped and 
imputed markers from GWAS1, GWAS2, and GWAS3 is shown across the chromosomes. The 
dotted line indicates the threshold for genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8).
