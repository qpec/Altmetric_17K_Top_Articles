abstract
The use of donor human milk is increasing for high-risk infants, primarily 
for infants born weighing <1500 g or those who have severe intestinal 
disorders. Pasteurized donor milk may be considered in situations in which 
the supply of maternal milk is insuffi
 cient. The use of pasteurized donor milk 
is safe when appropriate measures are used to screen donors and collect, 
store, and pasteurize the milk and then distribute it through established 
human milk banks. The use of nonpasteurized donor milk and other forms 
of direct, Internet-based, or informal human milk sharing does not involve 
this level of safety and is not recommended. It is important that health 
care providers counsel families considering milk sharing about the risks of 
bacterial or viral contamination of nonpasteurized human milk and about 
the possibilities of exposure to medications, drugs, or herbs in human milk. 
Currently, the use of pasteurized donor milk is limited by its availability 
and affordability. The development of public policy to improve and expand 
access to pasteurized donor milk, including policies that support improved 
governmental and private fi
 nancial support for donor milk banks and the 
use of donor milk, is important.
INTRODUCTION
Human milk provides health benefits for all newborn infants but is of 
particular importance for high-risk infants, especially those born with 
very low birth weight (<1500 g). Donor human milk also can be beneficial 
to supplement the mother’s own milk when necessary. The evidence to 
support the use of donor human milk has been reviewed,

–

studies

–

<1500 g, especially in decreasing rates of necrotizing enterocolitis.
Donor milk banks represent a safe and effective approach to obtaining, 
pasteurizing, and dispensing human milk for use in NICUs and other 
settings. However, accessibility to donor milk in the United States

continues to be substantially 
limited in terms of supply, cost, 
and distribution. Because of these 
limitations, some parents have 
chosen to exchange human milk that 
is not pasteurized or handled by 
an established milk bank with each 
other (milk sharing). This report 
reviews the preparation, safety, and 
usage options for donor human milk 
in the United States.
PREPARATION OF DONOR HUMAN MILK, 
PASTEURIZATION, AND DISTRIBUTION
The number of human milk banks 
in the United States is increasing. 
Currently, there are 20 donor milk 
banks in the United States and 4 in 
Canada that pasteurize milk as part 
of a professional organization for 
supporters of nonprofit human milk 
banking, the Human Milk Banking 
Association of North America 
(HMBANA); 7 others are in various 
stages of planning and development 
(www. 
hmbana. 
org). In addition, 
several commercial (for-profit) 
human milk banks collect, pasteurize, 
and distribute donor human milk but 
are not part of HMBANA.
Donor Human Milk Collection
HMBANA has established policies 
for donor human milk collection, as 
do commercial human milk banks. 
10 
These have been described in the 
literature 
1, 
 
2 and in the policies 
usually found on the Web sites of the 
individual milk banks. Guidelines for 
donors include completion of a health 
screen, blood serologic testing, and 
detailed instructions on collecting, 
storing, and shipping milk. 
10 In 
contrast, direct milk sharing or 
other forms of milk collection and 
distribution are extremely variable 
in the screening of donors and 
the methods of milk storage and 
transportation.
Pasteurization
Several methods may be used to 
pasteurize donor human milk, 
and these have been reviewed 
extensively. 
1, 
 
3, 
 
11 The Holder 
pasteurization method uses heating 
at 62.5°C for 30 minutes and is the 
primary method used by HMBANA 
milk banks. One commercial milk 
bank, Medolac Laboratories (Lake 
Oswego, OR), uses a different thermal 
pasteurization system.
Distribution
In the United States and Canada, 
most donor milk is distributed by 
established milk banks to NICUs. 
Each milk bank and/or processing 
center has policies, including 
cost-related guidelines, for this 
distribution. The distribution of 
donor milk may be subject to federal 
or state guidelines in some situations, 
but at the time of this publication, 
there are no restrictions on the use of 
pasteurized donor human milk in any 
state in the United States.
Frozen donor human milk is 
distributed by using shipping 
guidelines established by the 
milk banks. Receiving hospitals 
are provided guidance related to 
temperature and other storage 
conditions for the milk, and these 
may be subject to state and local 
regulations. Hospitals that use 
frozen donor human milk must have 
properly regulated freezers and other 
methods for handling and tracking 
donor milk.
SAFETY
Human milk is a biological product; 
therefore, whether from an infant’s 
own mother or a donor mother, 
there will always be concerns 
about contamination. Possible 
contaminants are infectious agents, 
including both bacteria and viruses, 
and contamination with other 
substances, most notably toxic 
components in the environment (eg, 
pesticides, mercury, medications, 
drugs, or herbs).
Although a detailed description of 
each of these is beyond the scope of 
this statement, the processes used in 
pasteurization of donor human milk 
are highly effective in removing viral 
infectious contaminants. 
10 
 
 
–14 Human 
milk banks vary in their approach to 
bacterial screening of incoming milk, 
but postpasteurization bacteriologic 
cultures are performed routinely. 
Published data 
10, 
 
11 have revealed a 
very low or unmeasurable level of 
infectious contaminants. Families 
and caregivers may be reassured 
that, at the time of this publication, 
there are no reported cases of 
pasteurized donor human milk 
causing an infection with hepatitis 
viruses or HIV and that the likelihood 
of this type of infection occurring in 
a neonate given donor human milk is 
extremely small.
With regard to noninfectious 
contaminants, although these can 
be difficult to completely eliminate, 
the pooling process with donor milk 
makes it very unlikely that these 
will represent a significant exposure 
risk. An exception to this is cow milk 
protein, which is present in the milk 
of mothers who include dairy in their 
diet. The contamination of human 
milk purchased via the Internet with 
cow milk (up to a 10% dilution of 
the human milk) has recently been 
reported. 
15
In contrast, informal direct milk 
sharing without pasteurization 
exposes infants to a range 
of possible risks, including 
bacterial contamination 
16 and 
viral transmission, including 
cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, 
and HIV. 
17 Individual screening 
is performed by some Internet-
based groups that organize 
direct milk sharing, but these are 
neither consistently applied nor 
documented. Furthermore, even with 
serologic blood testing, infectious 
complications remain a significant 
risk in unpasteurized milk.
Because direct milk sharing is often 
arranged by using milk from a single 
donor mother, other contaminants, 
such as medications or drugs, may be

a higher risk than with pooled milk 
products. It is unknown what effects 
paying women for milk might have 
on these risks.
Growth Issues
Early studies in the use of donor 
human milk for small preterm infants 
showed relatively slow growth. 
More recent studies 
18 
– 
20 showed 
improved growth outcomes, which 
may be attributable both to a greater 
availability of donor milk with higher 
nutrient content and to widely used 
strategies for fortifying donor milk. 
However, these are retrospective 
cohort studies, and further studies 
are needed. Strategies for fortifying 
donor human milk include both 
commercial human milk–based and 
cow milk protein–based fortifiers. 
Both types of fortifiers have been 
shown to lead to appropriate growth, 
and the use of donor human milk 
does not need to be limited on the 
basis of growth concerns in most 
high-risk infants. Growth monitoring 
is always paramount for infants, and 
human milk fortification is needed 
for all infants with very low birth 
weight.
Loss of Nutrients and 
Antiinfl
 ammatory Properties
The process of pasteurization 
destroys cells, such neutrophils and 
stem cells, and affects macronutrients 
and antiinflammatory factors. 
In addition, pasteurization can 
eliminate bacterial strains with 
probiotic properties. Substantial 
evidence describing these losses 
is available. 
21 
 
 
–25 Bioactive 
components of human milk, including 
lactoferrin and immunoglobulins, 
are substantially decreased by 
pasteurization, but there is much less 
effect on macro- or micronutrients, 
including vitamins. 
22, 
 
23 Overall, 
the benefits of improved feeding 
tolerance and clinical outcomes 
support the concept that some 
nutrient losses of bioactive 
components should not limit the use 
of donor human milk or preclude 
its pasteurization before use. Donor 
human milk may have a lower 
protein and energy content than the 
milk of mothers of preterm infants, in 
addition to lost bile salt–dependent 
lipase activity, which may affect 
fortification strategies and growth. 
Alternative sterilization methods to 
preserve innate bioactive properties 
and to decrease the cost of preparing 
donor milk need investigation.
The principal goal for infants with 
very low birth weight is the provision 
of the mother’s own milk, with donor 
human milk as a bridge or support 
while the mother’s milk is made 
available or increasing in volume. It 
is important to encourage and assist 
mothers to pump or express and 
provide their own milk whenever 
possible and at the maximum volume 
possible. Although the use of donor 
human milk has not been shown to 
decrease the frequency or volume 
of mother’s own milk to NICU 
patients, 
 
9, 
 
23, 
 
26, 
 
27 vigilance and 
education are needed regarding the 
superiority of mother’s own milk 
relative to donor human milk.
USAGE
Infants <1500 g Birth Weight
The supply of donor human milk 
currently available in the United 
States and Canada is less than 
optimal. Although a goal of providing 
donor milk to supplement the 
mother’s milk for all preterm infants 
has been described, 
 
5 this goal may 
not be achievable for a period of time; 
thus, prioritization may be needed 
for infants weighing <1500 g. 
Relatively few data are available on 
whether this would include small 
for gestational age infants, such as 
those who are >32 to 33 weeks’ 
postmenstrual age at birth who also 
weigh <1500 g; but, in general, the 
primary guide for use is birth weight, 
not gestational age, in prioritizing 
donor milk use.
There are no clear guidelines for 
discontinuing the use of donor 
human milk in an infant <1500 g 
birth weight when the volume of 
mother’s milk is not adequate. A 
range of postmenstrual ages from 
32 to 36 weeks is commonly used 
in the United States, because this 
range covers the highest risk period 
for necrotizing enterocolitis. Further 
research is needed to clarify the 
optimal timing of discontinuing 
donor human milk. Breastfeeding 
should be encouraged during 
hospitalization for these infants to 
enhance the likelihood of successful 
breastfeeding after hospital 
discharge. 
28
Other Intestinal Diseases
Fewer data are available regarding 
the use of donor human milk in other 
high-risk infants, including infants 
with abdominal wall defects, such 
as gastroschisis or omphalocele, and 
other conditions, such as congenital 
heart disease. Nonetheless, some 
infants with these conditions or other 
neonatal disorders may benefit from 
donor human milk either because of 
a direct effect on intestinal growth 
or improved feeding tolerance. 
29 
In these cases, payers may expect 
documentation of intolerance to 
specialized infant formulas and the 
medical necessity for donor human 
milk before providing payment 
for human milk at home or in the 
hospital.
Outpatient (Home) Versus Hospital 
Distribution
The vast majority of donor human 
milk distributed from HMBANA milk 
banks is distributed to hospitals 
for internal use in NICU patients. 
However, in some cases, donor 
human milk may be provided for 
home use from HMBANA milk banks. 
1 
In cases of limited supply, health 
care providers, such as community 
pediatricians and neonatologists, 
can work together to establish 
priority for such use relative to 
local NICU needs. A pediatrician/

neonatal clinician generally will 
need to be involved in ordering 
and supervising the use of donor 
milk in any outpatient setting. Clear 
documentation as to the reason for 
the use of donor human milk at home 
is recommended.
OTHER POLICY ISSUES
Cost Reimbursement
A major limitation in the use of donor 
human milk is the cost of providing 
this milk to hospitals or to families. 
Reimbursement for donor milk is 
inconsistent between states and 
often between sources of payment. 
Health care providers can advocate 
for the development of public and 
local hospital policies to enhance 
the availability and affordability 
of donor human milk on the basis 
of evidence. Resources from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics and 
other groups can also assist those 
involved in the care of neonates in 
this discussion.
The use of donor human milk in 
appropriate high-risk infants is 
consistent with good health care for 
these infants. 
30, 
 
31 Policies are needed 
to provide high-risk infants access 
to donor human milk on the basis of 
documented medical necessity, not 
financial status.
Federal and State Regulation of Milk 
Banks and Donor Milk Sharing
Legal issues exist regarding the 
regulation of donor human milk 
banks on both a state and national 
level. Federal or state guidelines are 
needed regarding the preparation, 
handling, and transfer of human 
milk as well as the operation of 
donor human milk banks and would 
be best accomplished via formal 
regulation by the US Food and Drug 
Administration with oversight by 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.
Families of high-risk infants should 
be fully informed about the current 
state of research regarding the 
benefits of using human milk to 
decrease the risks of complications 
such as necrotizing enterocolitis. This 
discussion may include appropriate 
warnings about risks related to 
infectious complications when 
human milk is shared or distributed 
outside of established milk banks. 
Neonatologists and other health 
care providers should advocate 
for policies of full disclosure of 
the risks and benefits related to 
direct or informal milk sharing 
without pasteurization. Hospitals 
should develop standards such 
that all human milk given to infants 
meets appropriate standards for 
preparation and distribution and that 
pasteurization of all donor human 
milk occurs.
SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS
1. Although a mother’s own milk is 
always preferred, donor human 
milk may be used for high-risk 
infants when the mother’s milk is 
not available or the mother cannot 
provide milk. Priority should be 
given to providing donor human 
milk to infants <1500 g birth 
weight.
2. Human milk donors should be 
identified and screened by using 
methods such as those currently 
used by HMBANA milk banks or 
other established commercial milk 
banks.
3. Donor milk should be pasteurized 
according to accepted standards. 
Postpasteurization testing should 
be performed according to 
internal quality-control guidelines.
4. Health care providers should 
discourage families from direct 
human milk sharing or purchasing 
human milk from the Internet 
because of the increased risks of 
bacterial or viral contamination 
of nonpasteurized milk and 
the possibility of exposure to 
medications, drugs, or other 
substances, including cow milk 
protein.
5. The use of donor human milk 
in appropriate high-risk infants 
should not be limited by an 
individual’s ability to pay. Policies 
are needed to provide high-risk 
infants access to donor human 
milk on the basis of documented 
medical necessity, not financial 
status.
