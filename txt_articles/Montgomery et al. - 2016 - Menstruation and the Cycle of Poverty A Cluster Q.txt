Abstract
Background
Poor menstrual knowledge and access to sanitary products have been proposed as barriers
to menstrual health and school attendance. In response, interventions targeting these
needs have seen increasing implementation in public and private sectors. However, there
has been limited assessment of their effectiveness.
Objectives
Assess the impact of providing reusable sanitary pads and puberty education on girls’
school attendance and psychosocial wellbeing outcomes.
Methods
A cluster quasi-randomised controlled trial was conducted across 8 schools, including 1124
girls, in rural Uganda. Schools were allocated to one of four conditions: the provision of
puberty education alone; reusable sanitary pads alone; puberty education and reusable
sanitary pads; and a control (no intervention). The primary outcome was school attendance.
Secondary outcomes reflected psychosocial wellbeing.
Results
At follow-up, school attendance had worsened for girls across all conditions. Per-protocol
analysis revealed that this decline was significantly greater for those in the control condition
d = 0.52 (95%CI 0.26–0.77), with those in control schools having a 17.1% (95%CI: 8.7–
25.5) greater drop in attendance than those in any intervention school. There were no differ-
ences between the intervention conditions. High rates of school drop-out and transfer meant
the trial suffered from substantial participant drop-out. Intention-to-treat analyses using two

 different imputation strategies were consistent with the main results, with mean differences
of 5.2% attendance in best-case and 24.5% in worst-case imputations. Results were robust
to adjustments for clustering. There was no impact of the interventions on girls’ self-reported
shame or insecurity during menstruation.
Conclusion
Results of the trial support the hypothesised positive impact of providing sanitary pads or
puberty education for girls’ school attendance in a developing country context. Findings
must be interpreted with caution in light of poor participant retention, intervention fidelity,
and the attendance measures used.

Background
Educating girls has been proposed as the world’s highest yielding investment for developing
countries. [1] Improved educational attainment has been consistently linked to economic
growth and productivity.[2, 3] For women and girls, increased education has been associated
with benefits including: health for women and their children, literacy, delayed sexual debut
and marriage, self-efficacy, improvements in labour force participation, and involvement with
household decision making.[1, 4–8] These benefits rise substantially with increasing years of
schooling.[1]
Global improvements in gender parity in school enrolment have been considerable.
UNESCO [9] has reported that at the end of 2015, 69% of countries with data had achieved or
were likely to reach gender parity in primary education. Disparities are greater in secondary
education where less than 50% of countries are projected to reach gender parity.[9] Poverty
deepens disparities, with poor girls the least likely to enter or complete primary and secondary
schooling.[9] In Uganda, the context of the present study, high levels of enrolment in primary
school drop off sharply in secondary school.[10–12] In 2013, figures suggested only 22% of
school-aged girls were enrolled in secondary school in comparison to a 91% enrolment rate in
primary school.[9, 12, 13] Gender parity in school enrolment differed by area, with disparity
increasing with rurality.[12] While enrolment figures represent easily available and compara-
ble statistics, it is the quality of education as well as attendance and engagement at school
which contribute to girls’ ability to learn effectively when enrolled, and thus garner the benefits
of education.[1, 9, 14]
Many barriers to girls’ school attendance, participation, and retention have been identified.
[6, 15] Cultural expectations, household responsibilities, early pregnancy and marriage, and
prioritisation of boys’ education have all been discussed.[9, 16] Further, school environment
barriers to education for girls include a lack of female teachers, sanitation and hygiene facili-
ties, and gender-based violence.[6, 17] Menstruation has emerged as an additional gender-spe-
cific barrier to school participation amongst adolescent girls.[18] Particularly for poorer girls,
the most disadvantaged in access to education, the management of menses presents a signifi-
cant obstacle to health, comfort, and engagement with school.
Qualitative studies have revealed the construction of menstruation as embarrassing, shame-
ful, and dirty across many contexts.[19–21] Taboos around the topic mean many adolescent

 girls are unprepared for menarche, and that management practices are not discussed openly.
[19, 20, 22] In the confined school environment, with a lack of access to adequate latrines or
separate latrines for males and females, menstrual management presents a significant chal-
lenge. Absorbents such as cloth are used and can often leak, soiling uniforms or outer gar-
ments. In addition, cleaning and changing absorbents pose significant challenges. Girls
interviewed have described feelings of shame, fear and distraction associated with menstrua-
tion. Both girls and teachers have expressed the view that menstruation is a barrier to school
attendance and engagement.[19, 21]
Quantitative work has begun to support these assertions, although estimates have varied. A
study of 595 school girls in northeast Ethiopia found that after adjustment for residence,
household income and parental education, girls who did not use disposable sanitary pads had
5.37 times higher odds of school absenteeism during menses than those using disposable pads.
[23] In contrast, a survey study in rural Malawi of 717 girls aged 14–16 reported that after
adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and other reasons for school absenteeism,
menstruation did not predict absence.[24] Intervention studies have also provided mixed sup-
port for the association between menstruation and absenteeism.[25–27]
Studies have hypothesised that both physical barriers and a lack of menstrual knowledge to
support hygienic management of menses contribute to disengagement and absenteeism.[28–
30] Thus the provision of clean menstrual absorbents, and information about the effective and
hygienic management of menstruation, have been proposed as simple and efficient interven-
tions to improve the comfort, dignity, and school participation of adolescent girls. Increasingly
governments, charities, and development organisations have sought to target menstruation as
a barrier to school attendance.[31–33] However, there is sparse evidence for the effectiveness
of such interventions.[34] The first randomised controlled trial, conducted in Nepal, used
girls’ menstrual calendars (self-kept) and attendance records to estimate that only 0.4 days in
180 were missed due to menstruation.[25] The study found no improvement in attendance
after providing menstrual cups. Conversely, two pilot non-randomised trials in Ghana and
Kenya respectively found interventions providing sanitary pads and education, or materials
and education for girls to make their own pads improved school attendance.[26, 27] There is a
need for larger, randomised trials to provide causal evidence for the link between menstrua-
tion and education, as well as the effectiveness of proposed interventions.[34]
In 2009 this research group undertook a pilot trial of sanitary pad provision and puberty
education in peri-urban and rural Ghana. The non-randomised cluster-control trial of 120
schoolgirls (aged 12–18) across four schools tested the effectiveness of the provision of dispos-
able sanitary pads and/or a puberty education class on school attendance over a 5-month
period. Results were promising with a 9% increase in attendance found for those receiving
pads and education (see [26]). Qualitative work indicated improvements in shame and self-
confidence.[22] Whilst findings of the pilot were positive, they were limited by a lack of rando-
misation, small sample size, comparison of single clusters, and short study duration. In addi-
tion, the trial raised questions with regard to the effectiveness of providing sanitary pads in
contrast (or addition to) education, and the need to identify the individual impact of these
interventions.[26]
The present study represents a scale-up from the initial pilot to a cluster quasi-randomised
control trial of reusable sanitary pad and puberty education provision. A Latin-square design
meant four different conditions were compared to isolate the individual and combined effect
of pad provision and puberty education. Clusters received one of the following interventions:
reusable pads alone, education alone, reusable pads and education, or a no-intervention
control.

 Objectives
This trial aimed to assess the impacts of providing reusable sanitary pads and puberty educa-
tion on school attendance and psychosocial outcomes for girls in Uganda. In addition, the
study seeks to isolate the impact of resource provision (pads) and education as potential inter-
ventions to reduce menstrual-related absence and consequences for psychosocial wellbeing.
Methods
The trial was registered with the Pan African Trials Registry (PACTR201503001044408) (S1
File). Administrative challenges meant the trial was not registered until after follow-up. The
trial was registered prior to the analyst receiving any data, and details were recorded consistent
with the protocol prior to the start of the trial to ensure transparency around deviations, noted
below. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are regis-
tered. Outcomes reported in the paper are the same as those registered in the protocol. The
trial is reported in accordance with CONSORT (cluster RCT) guidance [35] (for checklist see
S1 Table).
Context
The intervention took place in Kamuli district, located in the eastern-central region of Uganda,
where the partner NGO (Plan International) operates several health and education pro-
grammes. The district was selected due to its poor performance across a range of key educa-
tion, health and welfare indicators, with the district characterised by “high school dropouts,
high illiteracy rates, high levels of morbidity and mortality, early marriages, high fertility rates,
intermittent food shortages and malnutrition, and poor housing”.[36] The district’s literacy
rate continues to lag behind the national average (61.8% vs 70%, respectively), with significant
disparities between the literacy of girls (54.6%) and boys (69.7%).[36] Poor literacy rates are
particularly pronounced among children; the District has the 3rd lowest rates of primacy
school literacy in the country (14% compared to 28% nationally).[37] Approximately a third of
students never complete primary school, and the majority of those who do, do not progress to
secondary school.[38]
Design
The trial was conducted between January 2012 and December 2014. The initial sample size
included in the protocol (n = 560) was calculated based on the effect size (partial-eta
squared = 0.094) and drop-out (15%) from the Ghana pilot [26] to achieve 80% power at a 5%
α-level, but clustering was not accounted for. Eight rural primary schools were recruited into
the study through the partner NGO. Budget limitations precluded the enrolment of additional
schools. Schools were purposively selected from the Kamuli district as described above.
Schools were required to be within reasonable distance from the partner NGO, and to be com-
parable in major characteristics such as degree of rural location and distance from services,
size, educational provision, toilet facilities, and education quality based on the extensive local
knowledge of the partner NGO. Additional summary of school facilities is provided in S2
Table. School clusters were selected to have sufficient geographical separation so as to reduce
risks of contamination. In each school, girls in primary grades 3 to 5 (ages approx. 10–13, but
extending above this) were enrolled in the study. Girls were not excluded based on menstrual
status as the trial aimed to capture both menstruating girls and those who were likely to com-
mence menstruating during the study (a very early protocol deviation). Written consent for

 participation was sought from girls and a parent/caregiver; none declined to participate. A
total of 1124 girls were recruited into the trial prior to baseline.
The study was a four-armed cluster quasi-randomised control trial. After baseline atten-
dance data collection and the baseline survey had been completed (see below), schools were
grouped into pairs maximising the distance between the clusters. The four clusters were then
quasi-randomised to conditions (two schools per condition). Clustered schools were allocated
sequentially in alphabetical order of the first school in the pair to one of the four conditions:
1. The provision of puberty education
2. The provision of reusable sanitary pads (AFRIpads)
3. The provision of puberty education and reusable sanitary pad (AFRIpads)
4. A control condition (receiving no pads or education).
After allocation, neither the intervention delivery team nor participants were blind to inter-
vention condition. The clustered design prevented contamination of education or pad distri-
bution, and prevented social and ethical issues which may have arisen by unequally
distributing resources to some girls and not others in a single community. Cluster sizes varied
depending on the number of pupils in each school, as all girls in primary grades 3–5 were
included.
Intervention
Development.
The trial followed a pilot in Ghana, however, many modifications were
made. In particular, the change from commercial disposable sanitary pads, to a locally-made,
reusable AFRIpad. Among the key limitations of the pilot work were the environmental conse-
quences of pad disposal.[22, 26] Further, the cost of monthly provision of disposable pads was
substantial. A reusable product was believed to be more sustainable, both from a cost and envi-
ronmental perspective. Prior to selecting AFRIpads, an acceptability study was conducted
comparing three different types of reusable pads, the results of which have been reported else-
where.[39] Girls in the study reported that the reusable pads were more reliable and stable
than their previous methods of menstrual absorption (e.g., cloth, underwear alone), and AFRI-
pads were thus selected as the product of choice for the trial.
AFRIpads.
Girls in the conditions receiving pads were provided with a pack of AFRIpads,
3 pairs of underwear, and a small quantity (one sachet, 45grams) of Omo (soap) with which to
wash the pads. Pads were distributed in October 2012, and again in March 2014. When distrib-
uting the pads, girls were also taught about their correct use and cleaning by locally trained
NGO research assistants. AFRIpads are a washable, reusable cloth pad produced in Uganda.
They are manufactured by a social business in Uganda that specializes in locally-produced,
eco-friendly sanitary pads. Pads are made of quick-drying fleece and sold in a kit that includes
two soil-resistant plastic-lined ‘base’ pads that fasten securely to underwear, three attachable
winged liners, three straight liners and two small bags for carrying. AFRIpads can be reused
for 12 months ([39]; http://www.afripads.com/).
Puberty education.
Locally trained community health nurses from the partner NGO
administered the education intervention in October 2012. Education sessions were conducted
in each school and lasted approximately 1.25hrs. Education followed the Straight Talk training
guide developed by the Straight Talk Foundation Uganda (http://straighttalkfoundation.org/).
Education covered puberty changes, menstruation, early pregnancy, life skills, prevention of
HIV, strategies for avoiding sexual assault, healthy relationships, and friendship formation and
goal setting. This education programme was selected for its high face-validity concerning the

 topics of puberty in the study. It has a small but promising evidence base, and available com-
munity health nurses had familiarity with the program. It was deemed contextually appropri-
ate and endorsed by project stakeholder groups. The manual from the program can be
downloaded from the intervention program page (http://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/
documents/PDF/Straight_Talk_Plan.pdf).
Intervention delivery and protocol deviations
The sample size recruited was larger than reported in the original protocol. Based on the
results of the pilot study, power analysis calculated the total sample size requirement to be 560
girls across the eight schools. However, attendance was taken for all girls in the assigned classes
(primary grades 3 to 5). As there was a much higher rate of drop-out over the 2-year study
period than in the pilot (only 5 months), this additional data collection meant sufficient num-
bers were still available at the 24-month follow-up to detect an effect. Far fewer girls were
reached for survey at the final time-point than intended, despite the administration of a drop-
out survey and attempt to follow up girls who were no longer in the study schools. Resource
restrictions limited the amount of time that could be dedicated to finding girls who had
dropped out of the study schools, thus assessments of those who did and did not drop-out are
limited to baseline measures. There was a very early change to the protocol to include menstru-
ating and non-menstruating girls, as noted above, in an attempt to reach girls before their first
menses.
Significant errors in intervention delivery occurred across the trial. The intended protocol
was for all girls in education conditions to receive the education, and all girls in pads condi-
tions, regardless of menstrual status, to receive the two deliveries of AFRIpads. Interventions
were delivered by the partner NGO. AFRIpad delivery was problematic. After the conclusion
of the trial it was revealed that pads may only have been delivered to girls who reported that
they had reached menarche; a very small proportion at baseline. The second pad delivery was
found to be delayed from the initial intended mid-point (12 months after the first delivery), to
March 2014. The names of girls receiving pads were recorded. These lists were manually
matched to participants to estimate which girls in the trial received pads. This number was
very low. Reports from local research assistants, however, suggested pads were left with head
teachers at the schools for additional distribution. Additionally, many more pads were
reported to be distributed than the number of girls listed as having received them. Thus it is
highly likely that more girls received pads than those listed.
The education sessions were only run once in each school, meaning girls absent on the day
of the sessions missed them. Attendance was taken and, on average, only half of all girls
included in the trial were present. It is possible some names were missed, recorded incorrectly,
or had been changed as part of religious practices, and so were unable to be matched to study
participants. Thus, the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis are likely to capture more
girls who did receive the interventions than displayed in the study flowchart. Nevertheless,
poor fidelity was a significant issue in the trial.
Measures
School attendance.
As in the pilot study [26] and similar studies of menstrual hygiene
management interventions,[25, 27] attendance was selected as the primary outcome. In con-
trast to measures such as performance, attendance is comparable across sites and other trials.
Baseline attendance: Baseline school attendance was collected prior to quasi-randomisation
by copying school attendance records for two full school terms (Term 1 and 2 of 2012).

 Teachers received training from the partner NGO to improve the accuracy of school records.
Local research assistants from the partner NGO took copies of these records each fortnight.
Follow-up attendance: The attendance data collection strategy was modified for follow-up
in light of budget considerations and to further improve accuracy. Research assistants from
the partner NGO conducted attendance data collection for a single week (week 4) across the
three follow-up terms, with research assistants calling attendance rather than copying school
registers. This was collapsed across terms 1, 2 and 3 of 2014 to form a continuous follow-up
measure. Due to the change in procedure, only corresponding weeks in the baseline data
(weeks 3–6 of Terms 1 and 2) were used to be comparable to the week 4 attendance collected
at follow-up. Site visits and reports from local research assistants noted that school attendance
varies greatly over the term due to school-fee demands and agricultural practices.
Drop-out: Throughout baseline and follow-up, if girls were absent for a full weeks’ record-
ings, research assistants asked other students and teachers to report if girls were simply absent
from school that week or if they had dropped out of school or transferred to a new school. Stu-
dent and teacher reports were checked again at subsequent data collection weeks and notes on
girls’ whereabouts recorded. In instances of drop-out or transfer, research assistants recorded
the name of the school the student had transferred to, or the reason a girl had dropped out of
school (e.g., death in the family, pregnancy, marriage). Girls’ whereabouts were corroborated
by those reached at the time of the drop-out survey, and were markedly consistent across
repeated collections. Further, extensive efforts were undertaken in data cleaning phases to
ensure only girls that had truly left the study schools, rather than those absent on the days
assessed, were considered drop-outs.
Survey.
Surveys captured socio-demographics, menstrual practices, and psychosocial
outcomes.
Surveys were administered at baseline, mid-point, and conclusion of the study. Trained
local research assistants from the partner NGO verbally administered the surveys in the local
language (Lusoga) and recorded answers on iPads (using the program SurveyDeck) into an
English copy of the questionnaire. Each question was required to be answered (or marked as
‘no answer’) by research assistants before it was possible to proceed to the next question,
ensuring there was no accidental missing data. Survey responses were then uploaded from Sur-
veyDeck to online collection tool, SurveyGizmo. For the final round of surveys, SurveyGizmo
was available for offline use so answers were recorded on iPads directly into SurveyGizmo.
The trial employed a Solomon 4-group design, surveying only a computer randomised 25%
subset (n = 281) of participants at baseline. This design was employed to reduce the bias intro-
duced to trials by researcher interference and repeated measurement.[40, 41] In the context of
the present study, there was significant concern that repeated questioning on menstrual issues
would lead to additional education being provided, causing contamination. The mid-point
assessment sought to follow-up only the subset of girls surveyed at baseline. However, response
rates were poor and outcomes at mid-point are not reported. Survey of the full sample was
attempted at the conclusion of the trial, including girls who had dropped out of school.
Menstrual practices. Girls self-reported if they had reached menarche. To assess knowledge
of menstruation, interviewers asked girls to describe to them what menstruation was. Girls
were considered to have passed if they revealed knowledge that menstruation was a biological
process linked to reproduction, with blood lost through the vagina. Interviewers asked girls to
elaborate when necessary to judge their knowledge. Additional questions captured menstrual
practices. These included questions about current absorbent use, disposal, changing and wash-
ing absorbents, as well as bathing practices and girls’ access to water, soap and underwear. The
survey also included items capturing how girls obtained menstrual absorbents (e.g., from
parents, purchased themselves).

 Psychosocial outcomes. The self-report version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
(SDQ; [42]) was used to assess overall psychosocial wellbeing. This questionnaire is a brief screen-
ing tool typically used to identify child mental health problems. The questionnaire consists of 25
items scored on a 3-point Likert scale from 0 ‘not true’ to 2 ‘true’, with a midpoint of 1 ‘somewhat
true’. Questions form five subscales; hyperactivity, conduct problems, emotional problems, peer
problems and prosocial behaviour, with the summative total difficulties score used in the present
study. The total difficulties score includes the hyperactivity, conduct, emotional and peer prob-
lems scales summed and has a range of 0–40. For 4-17-year-olds, current 4-band categorisation
based on a UK survey population are; average (0–14), slightly raised (15–17), high (18–19), very
high (20–40) (see http://www.sdqinfo.com/d0.html). The SDQ has been well validated and
broadly used in both high-income contexts as well as in low and middle income countries (e.g.,
[43]). The questionnaire has been translated into more than 75 languages.
Wellbeing in relation to menstruation was assessed through a series of single-item questions
seeking to capture shame and insecurity associated with menstruation (e.g., “During your MP, do
you feel ashamed? Or do you feel about the same as when you are not on your MP?”). Girls indi-
cated if they felt more ashamed or insecure during menstruation or if they felt the same as usual.
Analysis
Analyses were conducted using SPSS 22 [44] and Stata 14.0 [45].
Participant characteristics. Descriptive statistics were used to assess demographic character-
istics. Differences in baseline demographics, psychosocial functioning, and menstrual practices
across conditions were examined using the appropriate tests (see results reported). Chi-square
comparisons and one-way analysis of variance were used to assess the proportion of girls who
dropped out of the study for differing reasons.
Primary outcome at baseline: school attendance. Baseline school attendance was compared
across conditions using a one-way analysis of variance. Attendance varied significantly, thus,
subsequent analyses needed to account for baseline attendance and attendance change scores
were used as the primary outcome.
Primary outcome: effect of drop-out. Variation in drop-out and reasons for drop-out across
intervention conditions were assessed through one-way analysis of variance and independent
samples t-tests. In addition, differences in attendance at baseline between those who dropped
out of the study and those who were retained were assessed using one-way analysis of variance
and independent samples t-tests.
There was considerable, and unanticipated, drop-out over the study. Due to the high pro-
portion and reasons for drop-out, imputation would be highly unreliable and open to bias. It
would have been inaccurate to assume data were missing-at-random, further it would not be
theoretically justifiable to use multiple imputation for attendance scores for girls who had
dropped out of school. Thus, per-protocol analysis is presented as the main analysis for the
paper. Intention-to-treat analysis, described below, using two different imputation strategies is
also provided.
Intervention effectiveness: primary outcome. The main study analysis was a per-protocol
analysis conducted on the sample of all girls who were quasi-randomised to conditions and
were still in school at the start of the attendance follow-up period. This excluded girls who had
dropped out of the study schools between baseline and follow-up as there were no attendance
data for these participants. Independent-samples t-tests were used to compare girls in any
intervention condition to those in the control condition. One-way analysis of variance assessed
differences between all four conditions, with follow-up t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment for
familywise error assessing differences between the conditions.

 Robustness checks. The analytic strategies outlined above did not take account of the clus-
tered nature of the data. Whilst the preferred method of analysis would have been a multilevel
model, capturing both the data clusters and individual participant variation, the very small
number of clusters meant this analysis would have been inappropriate. Intra-cluster correla-
tion coefficients were calculated to estimate the impact of clustering. In addition, the robust-
ness of findings to adjustment for clustering was assessed through analysis of variance
conducted at the cluster level (n = 8). Secondly, linear regressions with cluster-adjusted stan-
dard errors were estimated. However, these standard methods for bias correction from cluster-
ing are problematic in the context of small numbers of clusters [46] and the results were re-
estimated accounting for small cluster numbers [47] as a robustness check.
Intention-to-treat analyses. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted on the full sample
of 1008 participants allocated to a condition. The large amount and nature of the missing data
meant multiple imputation methods, which assume data is missing-at-random, were inappro-
priate. Instead, data were imputed using a realistic best case and a worst case scenario for girls’
school attendance. In the best-case, baseline observations were carried forward for missing fol-
low-up data. In the worst-case imputation, it was assumed that girls with missing data attended
school 0 days (0%). The high proportion (42.5%) and non-random nature of the missing data
means these estimates are likely to be more biased than the per-protocol analysis. Nevertheless,
the best-case and worst-case imputation provides a measure of the impact of missingness on
the paper’s conclusions. After imputation, one-way analysis of variance was used to compare
change scores between those who received any intervention and controls, and across all four
conditions. Further, regressions with adjustment for the small number of clusters were under-
taken as a further check of the robustness of these results to clustering.
Intervention effects for menstruating, compared to non-menstruating girls. At the conclu-
sion of the trial, the follow-up survey indicated that less than half of the sample had reached
menarche. The provision of sanitary products and education about menstruation should only
benefit the school attendance of those who had started menstruating. Thus, follow-up analyses
were conducted to test the impact of the intervention on girls who self-reported that they had
started menstruating, and those who had not. One-way analysis of variance and independent
samples t-tests were conducted on menstruating and non-menstruating sub-groups. These
analyses could only be conducted for the smaller sub-sample of girls who completed the final
survey (see study flow chart).
Intervention effectiveness: secondary outcomes. Psychosocial outcomes were compared
between the conditions using chi-squared tests and one-way analyses of variance. These were
compared between the groups at follow-up as there were no differences identified at baseline,
and only a 25% sub-set of the sample was surveyed at baseline.
Ethics
Ethical approval for the study was received from the Social Science & Humanities Inter-Divi-
sional Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (Ref No.: SSD/CUREC1/11-
056), the AIDS Support Organisation (TASO) Institutional Review Committee Uganda
(TASOIRC/022/14-UG-IRC-009), and the University of Illinois (#12236).
Results
Participant flow chart
A total of 1124 girls were recruited into the study. By the conclusion of the two-term baseline
attendance data collection, 116 girls had dropped out of the schools (reasons included drop-
ping out of school, transferring to another school, or leaving the school for an unknown

 reason), leaving a sample of 1008 girls across the eight schools when quasi-randomisation
occurred. The participant flow chart is displayed in Fig 1. As noted in methods, the reported
number of participants receiving the intervention are conservative.
Participant drop-out over the study period was substantial. Consistent with low secondary
school enrolment, many girls dropped out of school over the trial. Additionally, the population
of girls in rural Uganda was highly mobile and many girls transferred to other schools during
the trial period. At follow-up, 580 girls remained in school and 428 had dropped out of the
study, a retention rate of 57.5%. Based on the reports of students and teachers, of participants
lost to follow-up; 91 had dropped out of school, 223 had transferred to a new school, and 114
had unknown school enrolment status (95 were stated to have moved to a new town with
unclear school enrolment, and 19 girls were no longer in school but no more information was
available). A breakdown of girls’ school status across conditions at follow-up is displayed in
Table 1 and Fig 2.
Sites differed significantly in retention rates χ2(3) = 43.26, p < .001, with girls in the control
condition far less likely to be retained in the study (36.6%) than in any intervention condition
(62.4%), χ2(1) = 41.05, p < .001. This difference was driven by the number of transfers out of
the control schools, with girls in the control condition significantly more likely to transfer
(38.7%) than those in intervention schools (18.2%), χ2(1) = 36.60, p < .001. Girls in the control

 completed the baseline survey reported being between 7 and 18 years of age (M = 11.44, SD =
1.71). Girls in the pads only schools were, on average, older than those in the control condition
(p = .012). There were no significant differences according to school grade, repeating the cur-
rent school grade, or being at the same school the preceding year. There was significant varia-
tion in the amount of time girls estimated it took to walk from home to school across the
conditions χ(6) = 17.45, p = .008. With over half the girls in the pads only and control condi-
tions reporting it took them less than 30 minutes, in contrast to education only and education
and pads conditions where almost one third of girls reported that it took longer than one hour.
The mean SDQ total difficulties score was high for girls across all conditions (M = 19.50, SD =
5.84), but did not differ significantly between conditions. Scores were in the high categorisa-
tion range based on children (aged 4–17) in the UK.[42] Although it should be noted that
scores on the pro-social scale were also very high, but in the positive direction (M = 9.26, SD =
1.13).
Of girls surveyed, 61.4% knew what menstruation was, and 20.6% had started menstruating.
These proportions did not differ significantly by condition. Of girls who were menstruating
(n = 58), 55.2% reported knowing about menstruation before it happened to them. 87.9% used
cloth as menstrual absorbent with only 3 girls reporting using sanitary pads, and 4 reporting
using just underwear. Almost all girls (96.6%) had access to water at home, and 86.2% of girls
reported having access to soap at home. In contrast, only 15.5% reported having access to soap
at school. When asked how much of a problem it was to change their sanitary protection at
school 43.9% of menstruating girls stated that it was ‘not a problem at all’, 26.3% that it was ‘a

 little bit of a problem’, and 29.8% reported it was ‘a big problem’. Most girls (70.7%) felt more
ashamed and insecure whilst menstruating than when they were not. In the sample of 58 men-
struating girls, no responses significantly differed between conditions.
55.2% of girls reported that their menstruation caused them to miss school. This did not
differ significantly according to condition, although proportions did vary substantially (see
Table 2), in the small sample. In a similar pattern, the number of days girls reported missing
from school during their menses varied across conditions, F(3,54) = 3.05, p = .036. Girls in the
education only condition reported missing significantly fewer days of school than those in the
control condition (p = .026), with no other significant differences between conditions. For the
58 menstruating girls, the self-reported mean days of school missed per menses was 1.43 days
(SD = 1.61).
Primary outcome at baseline: school attendance
Attendance across the baseline period varied significantly by intervention condition F(3,1004) =
9.923, p < .001. Education alone (M = 78.02, SD = 23.51) and control conditions (M = 76.09,
SD = 21.50) did not significantly differ in mean attendance, but both had significantly higher
attendance than pads alone (M = 68.36, SD = 26.30) or education and pads conditions (M =
69.35, SD = 25.65),(p < .05). Education and pads, and pads alone conditions did not significantly
differ in baseline attendance. Some impact of clustering was identified. Intra-cluster correlation
coefficient (ICC) was calculated to be 0.026 which represents a small impact of clustering.[35]
Primary outcome: effect of drop-out
Baseline attendance significantly differed between those who were retained or dropped out of
the study F(3,1004) = 2.82, p = .038. However post-hoc tests revealed only those who had an
unknown school enrolment status at follow-up had significantly lower baseline attendance
(M = 67.00, SD = 24.79) than those who were retained at follow-up (M = 74.29; SD = 24.43),
p = .025, with no other significant differences amongst the groups. However, these results var-
ied when drop-outs were assessed within each condition. For those in the control schools, girls
who dropped out of the study (for any reason) had significantly lower baseline attendance
(M = 72.23, SD = 23.26) than those who were retained at follow-up (M = 82.78, SD = 16.12),
t(182.83) = -3.69, p < .001. Similarly for girls in the education schools drop-outs had signifi-
cantly lower attendance at baseline (M = 73.94, SD = 24.44) than those who were retained in
the study (M = 80.24, SD = 22.76), t(191.36) = -2.12,p = .035. In contrast, for the pads only
schools drop-outs did not have significantly lower attendance (M = 71.13, SD = 25.62) than
those who were retained (M = 66.53, SD = 26.68), t(185.09) = 1.26, p = .208. The same was
true in the education & pads schools where there was no difference in baseline attendance
between drop-outs (M = 67.05, SD = 27.00) and those remaining the study (M = 70.77,
SD = 24.74), t(239.28) = -1.24, p = 217. When compared across all reasons for drop-out only
those in the control condition were found to vary in their baseline attendance F(3,187) = 4.75,
p = .003, with post-hoc comparisons revealing both those who transferred from the control
school, and those with unknown school status at the start of the follow-up period had signifi-
cantly lower baseline attendance, (p = .006 and p = .039, respectively).
The above findings have some implications for interpreting the trial findings. The main
trial analyses (per-protocol) were conducted including girls who were still attending the study
schools at follow-up. Since girls with lower attendance girls were significantly more likely to
drop-out of the control and education only conditions, it is likely that drop-outs would have
reduced the average attendance in the control group, increasing the disparity between the

 intervention and control conditions. Thus the results of the per-protocol analysis may be
conservative.
Intervention effectiveness: school attendance
Per-protocol analysis of girls retained in the sample at follow-up was undertaken as the pri-
mary assessment of interventions’ effectiveness on school attendance (n = 580). Table 3 reports
the mean percentage attendance at baseline, follow-up, and the percentage change between
baseline and follow up for girls in the control condition, intervention conditions, and a pooled
total for those in any intervention condition.
Change scores differed significantly between those in the control (-21.16%) and those in an
intervention condition (-4.06%), t(87.25) = -4.04, p < .001. This represented a moderate effect
of any intervention in comparison to control d = 0.52 (95%CI 0.26–0.77). Attendance wors-
ened across all conditions, however, in the intervention groups this effect was mitigated by
17.1% (95%CI: 8.7–25.5) (see Fig 3). This represents an extra 2.5 days in school in the 15-day
(3 week) follow-up assessment period that would have otherwise been lost.
Intervention effectiveness was then compared between the four conditions. There was a sig-
nificant difference amongst the groups, F(3,576) = 6.63, p < .001, η2 = .033. Follow-up com-
parisons with Bonferroni adjustment for familywise error revealed no significant differences
between any of the intervention groups (p>.05). However, comparing the control group to
each intervention, there was a significantly greater drop in attendance for the control com-
pared to the education only (p = .001), pads only (p < .001) and education and pads (p = .006)
conditions. This effect is presented in Fig 3.
As noted in Methods, this comparison does not take account of the clustered nature of the
data. The intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for follow-up attendance data was 0.058,
which represents a small impact of clustering.[48]
Robustness checks.
While above analyses provide easily interpretable estimates of inter-
vention effects, they do not adjust for clustering. Additional analyses were undertaken with
adjustment for clustering, bearing in mind the small number of clusters.
Ordinary least squares regression with adjustment for clustering compared the three inter-
vention conditions to the control. Again there was an overall effect of condition F(3,7) = 14.00,
p = .002, R2 = 0.03. Each intervention condition; education alone (b = 17.48, SE = 4.69, 95%
CI = 6.40–28.56), pads alone (b = 20.26, SE = 3.18, 95%CI = 12.75–27.78), and education and
pads (b = 14.70, SE = 3.58, 95%CI = 6.23–23.17) significantly differed from the control. With
adjustment for clustering, considering the small number of clusters, there was also an overall
effect of the intervention. Each intervention condition; education alone (b = 17.48, SE = 4.69,
95%CI = 8.29–26.67), pads alone (b = 20.26, SE = 3.18, 95%CI = 14.02–26.49), and education
and pads (b = 14.70, SE = 3.58, 95%CI = 7.68–21.73) differed significantly from the control.
Similarly, adjustment for clustering demonstrated the robustness of results where any

 intervention was compared to the control. Results were corroborated with ordinary least
squares regression with cluster adjustment, where there remained an effect of any intervention
(b = 17.10, SE = 3.45, 95%CI = 8.95–25.25) compared to the control F(1,7) = 24.64, p = .002,
R2 = 0.03, and in regression with adjustment for clustering accounting for the small number of
clusters (b = 17.10, SE = 3.45, 95%CI = 10.34–23.86).
One-way analysis of variance at the school/cluster level (n = 8) found an overall significant
difference between conditions, F(3,4) = 6.80, p = .048, however, follow-up tests with Bonfer-
roni adjustment were not significant. This is to be expected in light of the lack of power to
detect effects at the cluster level only (n = 8). All intervention conditions, education alone (p =
.164), pads alone (p = .080) and pads and education (p = .246), trended toward a significant dif-
ference from the control condition.
Intention-to-treat analyses
Worst case imputation. When 0% attendance was imputed for all girls who had dropped out
of the study the mean percentage attendance at follow-up decreased dramatically (Table 4).
Consistent with per-protocol analyses there was a significantly greater drop in attendance for
girls in the control condition than those in the intervention condition t(328.52) = -7.98, p <
.001. This was a moderate effect d = 0.62 (95%CI 0.46–0.78). Similarly, a one-way ANOVA

 identified a significant difference between group change scores when individual interventions
were considered F(3,1004) = 17.09, p < .001, η2 = 0.05. Post hoc tests found no significant dif-
ferences amongst the intervention conditions, but all intervention conditions had a signifi-
cantly smaller drop in attendance than those in the control condition (p < .001 for all
analyses). Regression with adjustment for the small number of clusters demonstrated the
robustness of results to clustering, finding when compared to the control, the change in atten-
dance percent was mitigated by 5.2% in the intervention conditions (b = 5.22, SE = 1.83, 95%
CI = 1.63–8.81).
Best case imputation. An intention to treat analysis with last observations (baseline at-
tendance) carried forward was also conducted. Consistent with main analyses, there was a
significantly greater drop in attendance for girls in the control condition than those in the
intervention condition t(311.80) = -2.81, p = .005, d = 0.21 (95%CI 0.05–0.37). When interven-
tion groups were compared separately there remained a significant difference in change scores
amongst the groups F(3,1004) = 3.13, p = .025, η2 = 0.01, however, post hoc tests found only
the pads alone schools had a significantly smaller drop in attendance than those in the control
schools (p = .021). These results were also robust to the impact of clustering with any interven-
tion mitigating the drop in percent attendance by 24.5% (b = 24.51, SE = 2.25, 95%CI = 20.10–
28.91).
Both scenarios indicate a more pronounced decrease in the control group attendance com-
pared to the intervention groups, consistent with the pattern of results for the per-protocol
analysis. This suggests the positive effect of the interventions represents a real difference, but
that the precise amount of attendance saved by the interventions may vary. Whilst per-proto-
col analysis observed a difference of 17.1% (95%CI: 8.7–25.5) between interventions and con-
trol, conservative imputation estimated 5.2%, and worst-case imputation estimated 24.5%.
These results were robust to adjustment for clustering.
Outcomes according to menstrual status
As noted in methods, the trial included girls both pre- and post-menarche with the aim of
delivering the intervention before menstruation commenced. However, fewer girls had
reached menarche than anticipated in the final survey (although those who had dropped out of
school and were not reached for survey are likely to be older and to have reached menarche so
figures in the final survey may be an underestimate). Thus, additional comparisons were
undertaken for girls who completed the final survey (n = 356) and reported that they had
reached menarche (n = 164), and those who had not (n = 192). These analyses also served as
an additional check in light of the small number of clusters in the trial. If the same pattern of
results was observed for girls pre- and post-menarche it may have suggested that unidentified
cluster-level factors may have been driving identified effects. Table 5 displays the percentage
attendance and change scores for girls in each condition, or who received any intervention,
according to whether they self-reported that they had or had not reached menarche at the time
of the final survey.
For girls who had commenced menstruation by the time of the final survey, receiving any
intervention was associated with a significant difference in attendance change score, t(14.35) =
-2.59, p = .021, d = 0.93 (95%CI 0.37–1.49), a mean difference of 24.7% (95%CI 10.07–39.38).
When distinguishing between the interventions there was an overall difference in change
scores, F(3,160) = 4.19, p = .007, η2 = 0.07, and follow-up comparisons revealed no significant
differences between the intervention groups. But that education (p = .045), pads (p = .003) and
education and pads (p = .017) conditions all experienced a significantly smaller drop in atten-
dance than the control condition. For girls who had not yet reached menarche at the time of

 the final survey, receiving any intervention was not associated with a significant difference in
the changed attendance percentage between baseline and follow-up, t(41.06) = -1.55, p = .128,
d = 0.25 (95%CI -0.17–0.67). There was also no significant difference in change scores when
distinguishing between the intervention types F(3,188) = 1.92, p = .128, η2 = 0.03. Interestingly,
change scores revealed a slight increase in attendance for these girls. Results are also shown in
Fig 4.
Intervention effectiveness: psychosocial wellbeing
A total of 356 girls from the trial completed a final survey. Of these, 328 completed the full fol-
low-up survey, and 28 girls who had dropped out of school completed a shorter ‘drop-out’ ver-
sion of the survey. The mean self-reported age of this sample was 13.23 (SD = 1.43). 46.1% of
girls surveyed at the end of the study had started menstruating. Since psychosocial wellbeing
constructs were balanced across the groups at baseline, follow-up scores were compared.
Table 6 displays the self-reported SDQ total score, and feelings of shame and insecurity during
menstruation across the four conditions. Of girls who completed the follow-up surveys, a
higher proportion were menstruating in the pads only and education and pads schools, com-
pared to the education only and control schools χ(1) = 14.57, p < .001. For girls who were
menstruating, there were no differences across the conditions on any outcome, including feel-
ings of shame or insecurity during menstruation.
Discussion
Main study findings
This trial assessed the effectiveness of providing reusable sanitary pads or puberty education
for improving girls’ school attendance in rural Uganda. Consistent with the pilot study in
Ghana, the trial found both education and reusable sanitary pads to be equally effective in
improving school attendance compared to no-intervention. For all girls still in the study
schools at follow-up, attendance had dropped substantially from the baseline. However, those
in the control schools had a 17.1% (95%CI: 8.7–25.5) greater drop in attendance than those
who received the interventions in per-protocol analyses. This represents an extra 2.5 days in
school in the 15-day (3 week) follow-up assessment period that would have otherwise been

 lost. The moderate effect size found in this study (d = 0.52 95%CI 0.26–0.77) was comparable
to the pooled standardised mean difference revealed by meta-analysis of the two pilot trials of
sanitary pad and education provision to date (d = 0.49; [26, 27, 34]). In this trial, the provision
of education or reusable pads alone, and these interventions combined, were found to have
similar effectiveness in improving attendance. For policy makers, this suggests that even in
absence of resources to provide sanitary pads, the inclusion of adequate and gender-sensitive
puberty education in school curriculum could improve attendance and target gender inequali-
ties. Regressions with adjustment for clustering demonstrated the robustness of the findings.
The trial suffered from significant drop-out (42.5%). Only a sub-set of girls were surveyed at
baseline, precluding multiple imputation based on this survey. Further, the nature of the par-
ticipant drop-out meant that imputed attendance scores would be misrepresentative. Thus two
intention-to-treat analyses with different imputation strategies were undertaken. The first, or
worst-case scenario, assumed all drop-outs had 0% school attendance, while the second, best-
case scenario, presented a highly conservative estimate where baseline attendance scores were
carried forward for all drop-outs. In both scenarios, the pattern of results observed in the per-
protocol analyses were replicated and the interventions were found to have a significant posi-
tive effect on attendance (5.2% in the best-case, and 24.5% in the worst-case estimates).

 The frequency at which girls dropped out of school or transferred to another school was
unanticipated. While school absences attributable to menstrual management may be an addi-
tional factor involved in drop-out, menstruation alone was not hypothesised to lead to drop-
out and drop-out was not considered as an outcome variable in the study. The distribution of
participant drop-out for various reasons was similar across sites. There were no differences in
the rate dropping out of school or moving away, however the proportion of girls transferring
to another school during the study was substantially higher in the control condition. Follow-
up assessment revealed this was spread across both control schools. There were no patterns in
the recorded destination schools for transfer. Interventions may have been protective against
school transfer, as improved attendance may have meant girls were better equipped to pass
school exams and to progress through the school at the expected rate, reducing motivation to
transfer. It is also possible that the presence of the partner NGO in those schools delivering
pads or education provided extra incentive to stay, although the additional attention should
only have occurred very early in the study and should not have been sufficient to influence
school choice. Given the small number of clusters it is also possible an unmeasured factor
influenced the substantial transfer from the control schools.
The study included girls in upper primary school (ages 10–18, with a mean of 11.44 at base-
line) and sought to intervene before menarche. Only 20% of the sample had commenced men-
struating at the time of intervention. Despite age at menarche estimates of 12–14,[49, 50] only
46% of girls self-reported having commenced menstruation at the conclusion of the trial. This
may reflect the variability of menarche with environmental factors such as nutrition, and
means the intervention was well-timed to educate girls and provide products prior to menar-
che, but that the follow-up period was not long enough for most girls to have started menstru-
ating. It is also likely that girls who had been lost to follow-up were older and more likely to
have reached menarche, thus the survey figure is an underestimate. The measured effect of the
intervention is therefore likely to be conservative as the provision of pads or education should
make little difference to girls prior to menarche.
To provide an estimate of the intervention effectiveness amongst girls who had reached
menarche, additional analyses were undertaken separately for menstruating and non-

 menstruating girls. These analyses were restricted to the smaller sample of girls who had com-
pleted the follow-up surveys. In addition to estimating the effectiveness of the interventions
for those who had reported reaching menarche in the follow-up surveys, these analyses served
to check for variations in attendance which may have been caused by individual school level
factors. Moreover, to assess the consistency of the school attendance measures which were
changed between baseline (teacher-recorded attendance) and follow-up (partner-NGO
recorded attendance) and could have introduced bias. Analysis according to menstrual status
supported the interpretation of the per-protocol analysis, finding a significant, 24.7% (95%CI
10.07–39.38) drop in attendance in the control conditions for girls’ post-menarche compared
to the intervention conditions, which did not differ from one another. In contrast, there was
no effect of the interventions, and no drop in attendance amongst girls who reported not yet
menstruating. Findings support the interpretation of the study results that intervening in men-
strual management was responsible for observed differences in school attendance. Further,
findings support the hypothesised link between menstruation and school absence,[18, 23]
although these differences may also reflect other age-related absences, such as increased obliga-
tions to paid work or household chores.
Secondary outcomes
There were no significant differences in the psychosocial outcomes assessed across conditions
at follow-up. Reductions in shame and insecurity in the conditions providing sanitary pads in
the pilot study were not replicated.[22] It should be noted that only a small proportion of girls
in the study completed the follow-up survey, and single item measures of shame and insecurity
may have been influenced by social-desirability, particularly as the survey was administered ver-
bally by research assistants. Similarly, the SDQ total difficulties score[42] did not differ across
groups. Very high total difficulties scores were noted. These high scores may reflect the study
population. Recent systematic review, including studies using the SDQ, concluded that consid-
erable levels of mental health problems exist among children and adolescence in sub-Saharan
Africa.[51] Higher scores on subscales of the SDQ have been noted in studies in the Democratic
Republic of Congo [52] and refugee children in the UK,[53] although these were both in youn-
ger populations of children then the present study. Interestingly, in this study scores on the pro-
social scale were also very high, but in the positive direction. This may reflect some bias towards
affirmative responses, perhaps again reflective of the verbal administration of the survey. There
was no difference in girls’ knowledge of menstruation at follow-up, however, the measurement
of this construct was poor. During the survey girls were asked to describe menstruation and
research assistants provided a pass/fail rating based on criteria that girls reported menstruation
to be a biological process associated with reproduction. This menstrual knowledge measure fails
to capture many important aspects of menstrual management, and may be biased based on
girls’ confidence to describe the process or research assistants’ subjective assessment of the
response adequacy. Improved measurement is needed in future trials.
The trial failed to assess potential harms of the interventions. The identification of menstruat-
ing girls through education and the provision of sanitary products has the potential to expose
these girls’ menstrual status, leading to increased stigmatisation, teasing, or unwanted attention.
To date, no studies of menstrual management interventions have assessed potential harms (see
[34]), and there is an urgent need for future work to more thoroughly investigate this possibility.
Implications for menstrual hygiene intervention and research
Results of the study support the assertion that the management of menstruation presents a
gender specific barrier to education.[33] They also support the provision of menstrual

 absorbents and information about menstruation as effective avenues for intervention. It
should be noted, however, that the effective and hygienic management of menstruation
requires more than knowledge or reusable absorbents.[54] The interventions assessed in this
trial did not address needs for adequate latrines, access to water for washing the body and
absorbents, access to soap (beyond a small quantity provided initially with reusable pads in
some conditions), access to privacy or methods for disposal. Each of these factors contributes
to dignity and enables adequate menstrual management.[54, 55] As access to these other
requirements for menstrual management were comparable across schools. Follow-up qualita-
tive work to be detailed elsewhere, and reports from the field revealed that girls cleaned absor-
bents at home rather than at school, and that changing practices were associated with
individual school cultures around latrine use rather than any variation in facilities. In taking a
holistic view of girls’ needs, it is important to consider the way access to other requirements
for management may further contribute to school attendance, and to psychosocial wellbeing,
which was not improved by the tested interventions. Furthermore, as a reusable sanitary pad
was provided in this intervention, the effectiveness of this product is contingent on the
resources to wash and dry it appropriately.
Girls’ psychosocial wellbeing, dignity, comfort, and ability to manage menstruation without
shame are all essential considerations in seeking to provide girls with their full right to men-
strual health in low income contexts. Whilst there was only limited measurement of these out-
comes in the present trial, the lack of an effect is disappointing and means that there is more
work to be done for the development and evaluation of interventions to address this challenge.
Increased primary epidemiological research capturing girls’ behaviours, attitudes, and barrier
to menstrual hygiene, as well as improved measurement of negative effects on wellbeing or
comfort would provide much needed knowledge and tools for intervention research.
Limitations of the current trial should be addressed in future studies. A-priori analytic strat-
egies for high levels of participant drop-out are needed where this is expected. For girls who
have dropped out of school, no attendance can be expected. These cases may zero-inflate data
and fail to capture the true nature of effects. Trials with a larger number of clusters are needed
to enable adequate samples for multi-level models. Full baseline survey may be necessary to
adequately compare lost and retained participants, however the risks of bias associated with
multiple testing or the impromptu education provided through asking questions about men-
struation in studies of the effectiveness of puberty education must be considered. Menstrual
diaries may allow for more specific menstrual-attendance measures but may also represent an
intervention if girls had not previously recorded their cycles, and risk greater quantities of
missing data where diaries are not returned.
Contextual considerations and implementation
This paper reports on the primary quantitative outcomes of the menstruation and the cycle of
poverty trial. The study took place in a complex environment and many factors should be con-
sidered to maximise understanding of the barriers and facilitators of girls’ schooling in rural
Uganda, and lessons for future trials of sanitary pad provision or puberty education. Forth-
coming qualitative and quantitative work will seek to elucidate further complexities of improv-
ing girls’ menstrual management and access to schooling. In brief, these include the role of
teachers, whether or not girls used the provided pads or if they were sold to combat other bar-
riers to schooling such as school fees, the acceptability of a reusable absorbent, and girls clean-
ing practices. The interaction of the intervention with the other considerations for menstrual
management noted above, including how girls managed menstruation when only education
was provided, disposal or the adequacy of cleaning methods for the reusable pads provided,

 and the role of access to water, sanitation and hygiene and privacy with regard to school
latrines, are all important considerations in understanding how the interventions worked and
what adaptations to the interventions may be needed if relocated to different contexts. Current
results do not have sufficient explanatory power for why education alone, pads alone, and edu-
cation in addition to pads did not differ in their effectiveness for improving school attendance
or psychosocial outcomes.
Broader contextual considerations for this study include the roll-out of the partner NGO,
Plan International’s well-known ‘Because I am a girl’ campaign (https://plan-international.org/
what-we-do/because-i-am-girl) may have influenced community attitudes regarding girls’
education. The effect of the campaign should have been comparable across conditions, how-
ever, an increased emphasis on girls’ education may have impacted the self-reported psychoso-
cial and menstrual practice findings. Girls’ reports must be interpreted in light of this
program. An unanticipated contextual issue was the practice of labial elongation in the trial
population. This will be discussed further in forthcoming qualitative work, however, reports
from girls in the study suggested that uptake of the reusable sanitary pads may have been lim-
ited by discomfort, perhaps associated with this practice.
Study strengths and limitations
This trial was the largest to date assessing the impact of menstrual management interventions
on girls’ school attendance. The use of a clustered design prevented contamination, while allo-
cation to the four conditions provided a contrast between the different intervention compo-
nents of education and sanitary pad provision, compared to a no-intervention control. The
sequential allocation of clusters to conditions alphabetically represented quasi-randomisation,
potentially resulting in a higher risk of selection bias.[56] However, despite this sub-optimal
randomisation in comparison to more rigorous methods such as computer randomisation, the
school names in alphabetical order is unlikely to have biased allocation. There were few differ-
ences in participant characteristics between the conditions measured at baseline. The study
did not adjust for slight differences in mean age and the distance walked from school as only
a portion of the participants were surveyed at baseline, age is highly collinear with menstrual
status, and there was no evidence to suggest the distance walked to school would have any sig-
nificant interaction with the intervention. The small number of clusters limits the generalisa-
bility of findings and meant the trial was vulnerable to external factors which may have
influenced any of the small number of sites. The high rate of drop-out, and inability to follow-
up girls who dropped or transferred out of study schools also restricted the validity of the
intention-to-treat analysis and ability to capture the pattern of attendance for the full sample.
The change in attendance data collection methods was a significant limitation of the study.
Despite receiving training and repeated checks to try and ensure the accuracy of teacher-
recorded attendance, changing the follow-up measure to three, single-week attendance data
collections by research assistants may have introduced bias. The drop in attendance between
baseline and follow-up may be a true effect, but may also reflect this change in method. The
impact of the change should be the same across schools, and should not limit the interpretation
of the effect sizes as demonstrated in sub-group analyses of girls pre- and post-menarche. The
use of only two time points (1 week of attendance data per term for the follow-up year), means
more nuanced changes in attendance over time could not be investigated (for example, if there
was an initial increase in attendance following intervention delivery or if education took longer
to achieve a change as was found in the pilot study). Similarly, restriction of school attendance
records to weeks in the middle of the term means results may not be representative of other
times when attendance may vary more substantially. It should be noted that this study assessed

 attendance across all days, not only attendance during menstruation. Poor follow-up survey
coverage limits the study from being able to test mediating effects such as the role of changed
menstrual practices which may have resulted from education interventions as sample sizes of
menstruating girls who completed the follow-up survey were highly limited.
Weaknesses in intervention delivery also severely limit the reliability of results found.
Although estimated, it is unclear what proportion of girls received the assigned interventions.
Intervention implementation through a local NGO brought strengths to the study, providing
access to the local language, age appropriate research assistants to administer surveys and rap-
port with local communities and schools. However, issues with delivery and long-armed man-
agement from the UK resulted in poor intervention implementation and inadequacies in
participant follow-up.
Conclusions
This cluster quasi-randomised controlled trial provides initial evidence for the effectiveness of
providing reusable sanitary pads or puberty education for improving girls’ school attendance in
rural Uganda. Given the limitations of the trial, and need to assess potential harms of menstrual
management interventions, more research and replication is needed. Challenges identified in
this trial represent important considerations for future work. The study adds to an emergent
body of evidence suggesting that interventions to assist girls in better managing their menses
may be effective in improving girls’ access to education and reducing gender inequality.
