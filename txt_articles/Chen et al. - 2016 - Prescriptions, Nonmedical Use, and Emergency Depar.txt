Abstract
Objective—Little is known regarding the temporal trends in prescription, nonmedical use and 
emergency department (ED) visits involving prescription stimulants in the United States. We 
aimed to examine the three national trends involving dextroamphetamine-amphetamin (Adderall) 
and methylphenidate in adults and adolescents.
Method—Three national surveys conducted between 2006-2011 were used: National Disease and 
Therapeutic Index (NDTI), a survey of office-based practices, National Survey on Drug Use and

 Health (NSDUH), a population survey of substance use, and Drug Abuse Warning Network 
(DAWN), a survey of ED visits. Ordinary least square regression was used to examine temporal 
changes over time and the associations between these three trends.
Results—In adolescents, treatment visits involving dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and 
methylphenidate decreased over time; nonmedical dextroamphetamine-amphetamine use remained 
stable while nonmedical methylphenidate use declined by 54.4% in 6 years. ED visits involving 
either medication remained stable. In adults, treatment visits involving dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine remained unchanged while nonmedical use went up by 67% and ED visits went up 
by 156%. These three trends involving methylphenidate remained unchanged. The major source 
for both medications was a friend or relative across age groups; two-thirds of these friends/
relatives had obtained the medication from a physician.
Conclusions—Trends of prescriptions for stimulants do not correspond to trends in reports of 
nonmedical use and ED visits. Increased nonmedical stimulant use may not be simply attributed to 
increased prescribing trends. Future studies should focus on deeper understanding of the 
proportion, risk factors and motivations for drug diversions.

Introduction
The past two decades have witnessed increased public concerns regarding nonmedical use of 
prescription stimulants,1 particularly those commonly prescribed for attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Prescription stimulants mainly refer to methylphenidates 
and dextroamphetamine-amphetamines, classified as schedule II substances in the 
Controlled Substances Act (CSA) due to their high abuse potential.2 Nonmedical use of 
these medications has increased in recent years,3–7 particularly among young adults and 
adolescents.8–10 In 2011, 1.1 million Americans aged 12 or older used prescription 
stimulants nonmedically in the past year.11 According to a Treatment Episode Data Set 
(TEDS) report, which defined stimulant admissions as treatment episodes primarily resulting 
from stimulant use (prescription stimulant misuse as well as other stimulants, such as 
cocaine), the proportion of stimulant admissions that were due to prescription stimulant use, 
increased from 3.6% to 9.2% between 2006 and 2011.12 Several clinical and social 
consequences of nonmedical use of these stimulants have been noted, including substance 
and psychiatric comorbidities, crime, addiction, and cardiovascular adverse outcomes.
3,5,13–16
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) put a black box warning on 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine in 2006 due to cardiovascular risks.17 There is some 
evidence that dextroamphetamine-amphetamine prescriptions declined after the FDA 
warning. In one study, treatment visits for dextroamphetamine-amphetamine declined from 
36% in 2004 to 24% in 2008.18 Nevertheless, Emergency Department (ED) visits involving 
ADHD medications tripled from 2005 to 2010.19 Similarly, calls related to ADHD 
medication misuse in teenagers rose by 76% based on data from Poison Control Centers.20

 Whether prescription trends for specific stimulants are consistent with trends for nonmedical 
use and associated adverse outcomes (e.g. ED visits) remains unknown.
Prescription trends and trends in nonmedical use may vary for different population groups. 
Although the majority of ADHD medications are prescribed for children and adolescents, 
most nonmedical prescription stimulant users are young adults.3,5–7,21–22 Also, ED visits for 
nonmedical use of prescription stimulants have showed distinct patterns for adolescents and 
adults.19 An improved understanding of nonmedical use of prescription stimulants for these 
two populations would be a valuable step in the development of prevention programs.
This study aimed to elucidate these trends and their associations by examining temporal 
trends in prescriptions, nonmedical use, and ED visits involving dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine and methylphenidate among adults and adolescents between 2006 and 2011. 
We assessed the associations of these trends using three nationally representative datasets: 
National Disease and Therapeutic Index (NDTI), a survey of office-based practices, National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a population survey of substance use, and Drug 
Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), a survey of emergency department (ED) visits. 
Additionally, we examined the reported sources of nonmedically used dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine and methylphenidate, and the reasons for ED visits involving these 
medications.
Method
Samples
Data on prescriptions were obtained from NDTI, a nationally representative audit of office-
based physicians conducted by IMS Health. The NDTI uses a two-stage sampling procedure 
and collects data on patient contacts from approximately 4,300 physicians randomly selected 
within strata, generating approximately 350,000 annual contact records. We limited our 
analyses to the approximately 85% of contacts generated through office visits. Our primary 
unit of analysis was a treatment visit during which dextroamphetamine-amphetamine or 
methylphenidate was prescribed or continued. There were 26,469 contacts involving ADHD 
medications for patients aged 12 years and older, including 18,143 for dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine and 8,654 for methylphenidate.
Data on nonmedical use of medications were obtained from NSDUH public data for 2006 to 
2011 (N=338,495). The NSDUH is an annual cross-sectional survey sponsored by the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and provides 
estimates of the prevalence of alcohol and drug use in the household population of the 
United States. The response rate for household screening ranged from 87% to 91% and for 
completed participant interviews from 74% to 76% across the 6 years. Detailed information 
about the sampling and survey methodology of NSDUH are found elsewhere.11,23–27 
Among the NSDUH 2006–2011 respondents, there were 7,151 nonmedical 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine users and 3,197 nonmedical methylphenidate users.
Data on ED visits involving dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate were 
obtained from DAWN for 2006 to 2011 (N= 1,648,992). DAWN consists of a network of

 over 250 hospitals that monitor drug-related visits to hospital EDs. The DAWN data are 
collected directly from the medical records of patients treated in the EDs. Detailed 
information about the sampling and survey methodology of DAWN can be found elsewhere.
28 Between 2006 and 2011, a total of 9,181 visits involved dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine and 2,483 involved methylphenidate.
Assessments
Prescriptions in NDTI were assessed by a treatment visit during which prescription 
stimulants were prescribed or continued. We focused on two groups of medications: 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (including Adderall and Adderall XR) and 
methylphenidate (including Ritalin, Ritalin SR, Ritalin LA, Concerta, Methylin, Methylin 
ER, Metadate). NDTI links each drug therapy to a specific six-digit taxonomic code 
capturing diagnostic information similar to the International Classification of Diseases 9th 
Revision (ICD-9).
Nonmedical use of dextroamphetamine-amphetamine or methylphenidate in NSDUH was 
assessed using the following question: “Have you ever, even once, use [Drug name] that was 
not prescribed for you or that you took only for the experience or feeling it caused?” Each 
question was followed by a question about the time of the most recent use. Those who 
indicated the last use within 12 months were defined as past-year nonmedical prescription 
stimulant users.
NSDUH respondents who reported using prescription stimulants nonmedically in the past 30 
days were asked a series of questions on how they had obtained these drugs. The sources 
ascertained included friend/relative source (getting for free, buying from them or taking 
without asking), direct physician source (getting from one doctor or doctor shopping), illegal 
source (buying from a drug dealer, via internet, faking prescription, or stealing from 
pharmacy, clinic or hospital), other source (some other way), and multiple sources (have 
more than two of the above-mentioned sources). We combined the source variables into five 
larger categories as some of the specific sources were endorsed by very few respondents. 
Respondents who reported obtaining the stimulant from a friend or relative for free were 
asked how that friend or relative had obtained the drug (secondary source). Those who 
reported obtaining drug either primarily or secondarily from a physician were recorded as 
having obtained the drug from a physician source.
Information on ED visits in DAWN included medication or substances of abuse that might 
directly or indirectly have contributed to the visit based upon the medical record. We 
focused on ED visits involving methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine-amphetamine. 
DAWN also assessed the reasons for the ED visits. We categorized the reasons for ED visits 
into five categories based on a previous DAWN report19: suicidal attempt, adverse reaction, 
accidental ingestion, nonmedical use, and other. Nonmedical use in DAWN includes cases 
who used higher doses, used another person’s medication, or had drug abuse or dependence 
problems; thus, it included overmedication and malicious poisoning. We also examined the 
use of alcohol and other drugs in combination with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine.

 Statistical analyses
We restricted the samples from all three datasets to participants aged 12 years and older in 
order to have consistent age ranges for the three data sources. Treatment visits, nonmedical 
use and ED visits involving methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine-amphetamine were 
examined quarterly from 2006 to 2011 for adults (aged 18 or above) and adolescents (aged 
12-17). Ordinary linear square (OLS) regression was used to assess the temporal trend in 
frequency of prescription, nonmedical use and ED visits across quarters and their 
associations. Time (quarter) was the independent variable of interest in these models. We 
tested OLS models for autocorrelation across time using Durbin-Watson tests,29 and we 
further reported results adjusting for autocorrelations using Newey-West standard errors if 
the Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation produced inconclusive results.
Next, we examined the distribution in sources of methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine used in the past 30 days including primary and secondary sources. To examine 
whether time modifies the relationship between nonmedical prescription stimulant use and 
source of the misused drug, we divided these users into three mutually exclusive groups: 1) 
nonmedical dextroamphetamine-amphetamine users only, 2) nonmedical methylphenidate 
users only and 3) nonmedical dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate users. 
Reasons for ER visits were analyzed separately for dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and 
methylphenidate among adolescents (age 12-17) and adults (aged 18 and above).
To obtain nationally representative quarterly frequency estimates, data were weighted to 
reflect the complex design of the NSDUH and DAWN samples and were analyzed by Stata 
13.0 software.30 We used Taylor series estimation methods as implemented in STATA svy 
commands to obtain proper standard error estimates for the cross-tabulations and logistic 
regressions.
Results
Demographics characteristics (Table 1)
Based on the NDTI data, stimulants were more commonly prescribed for males 
(dextroamphetamine-amphetamine: 58.5%, methylphenidate: 53.7%), non-Hispanic whites 
(dextroamphetamine-amphetamine: 85.4%, methylphenidate: 87.0%), and 12-17 year olds 
(dextroamphetamine-amphetamine: 43.0%, methylphenidate: 30.9%). Notably, while 26% 
of methylphenidate visits included adults age 50 years and older, only 8.1% of 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine visits fell in this age range.
Based upon the NSDUH data, past-year nonmedical users of both dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine and methylphenidate were commonly found in males (dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine: 55.6%, methylphenidate: 53.7%), age group of 18-25 years 
(dextroamphetamine-amphetamine: 59.7%, methylphenidate: 50.8%), and white 
(dextroamphetamine-amphetamine: 86.4%, methylphenidate: 86.8%).
ED visits resulting from dextroamphetamine-amphetamine use, as reported in DAWN (Table 
1) were more frequent among females (54.9%), those aged 35-54 years (26.4%), and whites 
(86.8%). ED visits involving methylphenidate use were equally common in both sexes

 (50.0%), more frequent in those aged 12-17 years (26.8%), and in whites (91.1%). There 
was an increasing trend over 6 years for ED visits involving dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine and methylphenidate use.
Temporal trends among adolescents
Dextroamphetamine-amphetamine treatment visits among adolescents decreased from 
479,000 in the first quarter of 2006 to 223,000 visits in the last quarter of 2011. The Durbin-
Watson test showed an inconclusive result so an adjusted regression was performed 
(regression coefficient [B]=−9.24, standard error [SE]=1.57, p<0.001). Nonmedical 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine use and ED visits, however, did not change appreciably 
during this period (Figure 1A). Methylphenidate treatment visits in adolescents also 
decreased from 191,000 in the first quarter of 2006 to 113,000 visits in the last quarter of 
2011(B=−3.47, SE=0.68, p<0.001). Nonmedical use of methylphenidate decreased 
significantly from 2.06% in the first quarter of 2006 to 0.94% in the last quarter of 2011 (B=
−0.04, SE=0.01, p<0.001). The prevalence of ED visits involving methylphenidate in 
adolescents did not change significantly over time (Figure 1A). There was a statistically 
significant association between methylphenidate visits and nonmedical use of 
methylphenidate (B=0.01, SE=0.002, p=0.001), other associations between the temporal 
trends were all non-significant.
Temporal trends among adults
Dextroamphetamine-amphetamine treatment visits among adults changed little, from 
379,000 in the first quarter of 2006 to 364,000 visits in the last quarter of 2011 (Figure 1B). 
However, the prevalence of nonmedical dextroamphetamine-amphetamine use increased 
from 0.73% in the first quarter of 2006 to 1.22% in the last quarter of 2011 (B=0.10, 
SE=0.01, p<0.001). ED visits involving dextroamphetamine-amphetamine in adults 
similarly increased from 0.34% in the first quarter of 2006 to 0.87% in the last quarter of 
2011 (B=0.02, SE=0.003, p<0.001) (Figure 1B). A statistically significant association 
between nonmedical dextroamphetamine-amphetamine use and ED visits involving 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine was found in adults (B=0.68, SE=0.13, p <0.001). 
Treatment visits, nonmedical use and ED visits involving methylphenidate did not change 
appreciably during the study period. We conducted a post-hoc analysis among young adults 
aged 18-25, and results from this analysis were similar to those for the full adult population.
Reasons for ED visits (Table 2)
In adolescents, 14.1% of ED visits involved dextroamphetamine-amphetamine use, and 
16.4% involved methylphenidate; while in adults ED visits involving these medications were 
slightly higher (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine: 21.0%, methylphenidate: 18.2%). It is 
noteworthy that adverse reactions due to medical use of methylphenidate constituted about 
half of the ED visits among adolescents.
Only 45% of dextroamphetamine-amphetamine-related ED visits and 53.6% 
methylphenidate-related ED visits were single use. Alcohol was present in 16.1%, illicit 
drugs in 18.3%, and nonmedical use of other medications in 47.6% of dextroamphetamine-

 amphetamine-related ED visits. Alcohol was present in 13.1%, illicit drugs in 11.2%, and 
nonmedical use of other medications in 39.7 % of methylphenidate-related ED visits.
Sources of nonmedically used stimulants (Table 3)
Friends or relatives were the major primary source of nonmedically used stimulants, 
contributing 56.1% to 68.3% of nonmedically used stimulants. A physician’s prescription 
was the main secondary source for both drugs across age groups, ranging from 69.3% to 
83.2%. We created three mutually exclusive groups of nonmedical prescription stimulant 
users in order to examine the effect modification of time. The analyses showed that 
participants who used both dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate 
nonmedically were more likely to obtain the drug from physician sources (OR=1.57, 95% 
CI=1.11, 2.21, P=0.009), compared to those using dextroamphetamine-amphetamine alone. 
This effect did not change over time (P=0.087).
Discussion
This study had three principal findings. First, prescription visits did not show coincident 
changes with prevalence of nonmedical use. For instance, the prevalence of nonmedical use 
of dextroamphetamine-amphetamine in adults increased markedly while prescription trends 
for this drug remained stable. Second, nonmedical use of dextroamphetamine-amphetamine 
increased by 67% and associated ED visits went up by 156% in adults, while both trends 
remained unchanged in adolescents, suggesting different patterns for different age groups. 
Third, physicians were the major source for the misused stimulants regardless of types of 
stimulants or age group.
There was a sharp increase in the rate of ADHD treatment for children in the U.S. in the late 
1990s9 and this increase continued until recent years.31,32 Yet, our study showed that 
treatment visits for dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate among 
adolescents aged 12-17 declined from 2006 to 2011. One explanation for this discrepancy is 
that the role of stimulants in ADHD treatment has changed in recent years. Stimulants were 
used in 96% of visits in 2000, but only 87% of visits in 2010.33 Another explanation is the 
introduction of new stimulants such as Vyvanse, which has supplanted use of 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate.
Our study further showed that the reduction in methylphenidate treatment visits for 
adolescents was associated with decreased nonmedical use (although a causal association 
cannot be inferred). In contrast, nonmedical use of dextroamphetamine-amphetamine in 
adults increased, while prescription visits did not grow. The former finding is consistent with 
the theory that decreased availability of these medications through physician prescriptions 
may reduce nonmedical use of the drug.34 This conclusion, however, is not supported by the 
contrasting trends in dextroamphetamine-amphetamine prescriptions and nonmedical use in 
adults.
There are several potential explanations for the differences in the temporal trends of 
nonmedical use of dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate, including 
differences in pharmacological properties and in social factors. The extended-release

 formulation of dextroamphetamine-amphetamine has a longer duration of action than 
methylphenidate, producing a more steady effect.35 Furthermore, dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine increases both dopamine and norepinephrine level, which is associated with 
improved cognitive function.36 Since cognitive enhancement is the most commonly reported 
reason for nonmedical use of prescription stimulants,6–8 differences between 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate with regard to cognitive 
enhancement properties could partially explain dextroamphetamine-amphetamine’s 
increased popularity, especially among college students.7
Social context in which the stimulant is used may provide an explanation for nonmedical use 
trends. A qualitative study of college students found that nonmedical stimulant users had 
limited knowledge of the side effects of the drugs.37 Also, about 36% of the stimulant users 
believed using dextroamphetamine-amphetamine could help them to be “smarter”. The 
reputation of dextroamphetamine-amphetamine on college campuses as “not harmful” and 
as means of “getting smart” may contribute to the increased rate of nonmedical use among 
adults.
Our study also found that adult ED visits involving dextroamphetamine-amphetamine 
showed a strong correlation with increased nonmedical use in adults, consistent with a 
previous DAWN report.30 Our study further revealed that this trend is limited to 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine use in the adult population. In addition, almost half of the 
ADHD medication-related ED visits involved use in combination with alcohol and other 
drugs, suggesting that the combination of other substance may heighten health risks.
Consistent with past research, our study found that a friend or relative was the major source 
for nonmedically used prescription stimulants.7,22,37–39 Our study further found that among 
those who obtained the drug from a friend or relative, more than 70% of them obtained their 
drug legitimately through a doctor’s prescription. This finding suggests that drug diversion 
plays a crucial role in nonmedical prescription stimulant use. A study found that 61.7% of 
college students diagnosed with ADHD reported diverting their prescription stimulants.40 
Additionally, those who used both dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate 
nonmedically were more likely than those with nonmedical dextroamphetamine-
amphetamine use only to report obtaining the drug from physician sources, implying a 
heavier role for doctor shopping among this population.
The limitations of this study should be considered. A major limitation was that the three 
datasets (NDTI, NSDUH, and DAWN) were not linked, which limited our capability to 
make further conclusion about the associations we found. For instance, we were not able to 
assess whether nonmedical use and ED visits happened among the same individuals who 
were prescribed these medications. Second, treatment visits for methylphenidate and 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine are indirect measures of medication availability. 
Information on dosage or duration of treatment were not available in NDTI. Third, we 
examined only linear temporal trends. Stimulant prescriptions, nonmedical use and ED visits 
may have followed non-linear trends. Furthermore, we were unable to examine lagged 
associations between trends due to the short study period. Fourth, NSDUH used responses 
regarding the source of nonmedically used stimulants in general to ascertain the source of

 specific stimulants. Fifth, the NSDUH relies on self-reports, which may be vulnerable to 
recall bias. Finally, effects of the shifts in drug market share may not be fully captured by 
these data (e.g.,Vyvanse entering the market – although we performed analyses for Vyvanse, 
and its nonmedical use is very limited).
In the context of these limitations, the findings highlight the urgent need for public health 
campaigns to target drug diversion from legitimately prescribed users. This study showed 
that physician prescriptions constitute the main source of nonmedically used prescription 
stimulants and trends of nonmedical use of these stimulants did not correspond to their 
prescription trends. Future studies should focus on deeper understanding of the proportion, 
risk factors and motivations for drug diversions for a more tailored preventive program for 
stimulant misuse.

 Clinical Points
•
Treatment visits for dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate 
decreased over time in adolescents, as did nonmedical use of 
methylphenidate. In adults, however, both nonmedical use of 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and ED visits involving this drug 
increased.
•
In both age groups, the major source of nonmedically used 
dextroamphetamine-amphetamine and methylphenidate was a friend or 
relative who obtained the drug through prescriptions from a physician.
