SUMMARY
Regular exercise reduces the risk of cancer and dis-
ease recurrence. Yet the mechanisms behind this
protection remain to be elucidated. In this study, tu-
mor-bearing mice randomized to voluntary wheel
running showed over 60% reduction in tumor inci-
dence and growth across five different tumor models.
Microarray analysis revealed training-induced upre-
gulation of pathways associated with immune func-
tion. NK cell infiltration was significantly increased
in tumors from running mice, whereas depletion of
NK cells enhanced tumor growth and blunted the
beneficial effects of exercise. Mechanistic analyses
showed that NK cells were mobilized by epinephrine,
and blockade of b-adrenergic signaling blunted
training-dependent
tumor
inhibition.
Moreover,
epinephrine induced a selective mobilization of IL-6-
sensitive NK cells, and IL-6-blocking antibodies
blunted training-induced tumor suppression, intratu-
moral NK cell infiltration, and NK cell activation.
Together, these results link exercise, epinephrine,
and IL-6 to NK cell mobilization and redistribution,
and ultimately to control of tumor growth.
INTRODUCTION
Epidemiological data document that regular exercise protects
against the development of certain cancers and lowers the risk
of disease recurrence (Brown et al., 2012; Christensen et al.,
2014), prompting extensive research into exercise interventions
in cancer patients (Jones and Alfano, 2013). Across a range of
cancer diagnoses, exercise has been shown to improve func-
tional capacity and patient-reported outcomes (Mishra et al.,
2012). However, exercise may also directly suppress tumor
growth, as suggested by decreased risk of disease recurrence
in physically active cancer patients (Ballard-Barbash et al.,
2012). Little is known about the mechanisms behind this protec-
tion, but exercise-mediated changes in body composition, sex
hormone levels, systemic inflammation, and immune cell function
have been suggested as possible mediators (McTiernan, 2008).
Exercise training comprises of acute bouts of physical exer-
tion, followed by periods of recovery. During these acute bouts
of exercise, plasma levels of stress hormones and muscle-
derived myokines increase dramatically (Catoire and Kersten,
2015). Myokines may have direct anti-proliferative effects on
cancer cells, as shown for oncostatin M on hormone-sensitive
breast cancer cells (Hojman et al., 2011) and SPARC in colon
cancer (Aoi et al., 2013). Yet during exercise, an acute mobiliza-
tion of immune cells to the circulation is also seen (Pedersen and
Hoffman-Goetz, 2000; Bigley et al., 2014). Cells of the immune
system play dual roles in cancer. The immune system has a
powerful capacity to combat cancer, but chronic inflammation
has also been linked to tumorigenesis in several conditions (Viv-
ier et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2000; Grivennikov et al., 2010). On the
protective side, infiltrating cytotoxic immune cells have been
demonstrated
as
positive
prognostic
factors
for
disease
outcome and overall survival in several cancers (Fridman et al.,
2012; Remark et al., 2013). Thus, mobilization of cytotoxic im-
mune cells during exercise might represent an indirect defense
mechanism against cancer growth.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Voluntary Wheel Running Significantly Reduces Tumor
Incidence and Growth

ing tumor challenge in a subcutaneous B16F10 melanoma
model in female mice (Figure 1A). Four weeks of wheel running

 prior to tumor cell inoculation reduced tumor growth by 61% (p <
0.01, Figure 1B). Similar reductions in tumor volume of 67% and
53% with running were verified in female adult (3 months, p <
0.05, Figure 1C) and old mice (18 months, p < 0.001, Figure S1A).
Wheel running also dramatically reduced lung metastases after
intravenous (i.v.) injection of B16F10 melanoma cells (p <
0.001, Figures 1D and 1E). Next, the impact of wheel running
on tumor growth was evaluated in three additional models.
Male Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice were in-
jected with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) at 4 weeks of age, which
is known to cause liver tumors within 10 months. Here, wheel
running reduced tumor incidence as only 31% of the running
mice developed tumors, compared with 75% of the control
mice (Figure 1F). Moreover, wheel running reduced tumor
burden per mouse (p < 0.05, Figure 1G). In a Lewis Lung carci-
noma model (LLC) in female mice, running decreased tumor
volume by 58% (p < 0.01, Figure S1B) and tumor weight by
56% (p < 0.05, Figure S1C), and in Tg(Grm1)EPv transgenic
male mice, which spontaneously develops melanoma, wheel
running tended to delay formation of malignant lesions (p =
0.08, Figure S1D).
The average wheel running distance was 4.1 km/mouse/day
for the B16-inoculated female mice and 6.8 km/mouse/day for
the male DEN-injected mice. The presence of B16 tumors did
not induce weight loss or cachexia (Figure S1E). In contrast,
the presence of LLC tumors induced an average weight loss of
�1.27 ± 1.74 g in the tumor-bearing control group. This weight
loss was completely prevented in the running tumor-bearing
mice (p < 0.05, Figures S1E and S1G).
Taken together, we find marked reductions in tumor incidence
and growth with voluntary wheel running across 5 different tumor
models. The delay in B16 melanoma progression required a
4-week pre-training period prior to tumor inoculation. During
this period, the mice were habituated to wheel running, and the
immune system was primed for the tumor challenge, suggesting
that when using fast-growing transplantable tumor models, part
of the exercise effect could potentially be killing of cancer cells
at the inoculation site. In contrast, initiating running after tumor
challenge in our slow-growing DEN-induced and Tg(Grm1)Epv
models
was
sufficient
to
control
tumor
incidence
and
progression.
Training-Dependent Reduction in Tumor Growth Is
Associated with Induction of Immune-Related Pathways
To identify differentially regulated pathways in tumors from
running mice, we performed microarray analysis on B16 tumors
from Figure 1C (Table S1). Of the 92 upregulated gene ontology
(GO) pathways, the majority (52%) was related to immunological
and
inflammatory
pathways
(Figure
2A).
qPCR
analysis
confirmed the increased expression of both pro- and anti-inflam-
matory cytokines (Figure 2B), as well as markers of the cellular
innate and adaptive immune systems in B16 tumors from running
mice (Figure 2C). Also in LLC tumors, pro-inflammatory cyto-
kines (IL-1a and iNOS) and markers for NK and T cells were up-
regulated with running (Figures 2D and 2E).
To exclude that these differences in immune pathways were
merely related to tumor size, we repeated the evaluation now
based on B16 tumors of identical volume (approx. 150 mm3, Fig-
ure 2F). Thus, the tumors were on average excised 2 days earlier
in the control group (Figure 2G). In these similar sized tumors, up-
regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1a and iNOS)
and immune cell markers with exercise was verified (Figures
2H and 2I).
Training Regulates Tumor Growth through Intratumoral
NK Cell Infiltration
Next, we measured frequencies of immune cells in tumors by
flow cytometry after 6 weeks of wheel running. In the subcutane-
ous B16 model, tumors from running mice showed markedly
increased infiltration of NK cells (p < 0.001, Figures 3A, 3C,
and 3D), as well as CD3 T cells and dendritic cells (p < 0.05, Fig-
ure 3A). Of note, the CD3 gate includes CD3+ CD4� CD8� cells,
and thus also includes cells such as gamma delta and NKT cells.
In the i.v. B16 model, wheel running also increased NK cell infil-
tration in lung tumors (p < 0.05, Figure 3B), but without enhance-
ment of other immune cell subtypes. The level of NK cell infiltra-
tion correlated inversely with tumor burden (p < 0.01, Figures
S2A and S2B). Histological evaluation showed that exercise
increased both NK1.1+, CD8+ and CD4+cells with the absolute
numbers of CD8+ and CD4+ cells being higher than that for NK
cells (Figures 3E and S2C). In control mice, NK cells were rarely
detectable. Infiltration of B cells did not change significantly with
exercise (Figure S2D). In non-tumor-bearing mice, 6 weeks of
running increased the frequencies of NK cells in bone marrow
(p < 0.05), spleen (p < 0.01), and to a lesser extent peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (p = 0.17, Figure 3F), indi-
cating an overall increase in the basal pool of NK cells with exer-
cise. In tumor-bearing mice, running did not alter the frequency
of NK cells in these organs (Figure 3G), yet these mice showed
pronounced accumulation of NK cells in their tumors (Figure 3C).
The numbers of T cells did not increase in blood, bone marrow,
or spleen with 6 weeks of running in neither tumor-bearing nor
non-tumor-bearing mice (Figures S3A and S3B).
We then evaluated the response to running in athymic mice,
which lack functional T cells but retain NK cells. In these mice,
a 66% reduction in B16 tumor volume persisted with 6 weeks
of running (p < 0.05, Figure 3H), showing that T cells were not
responsible for the suppressive effect of running on tumor
growth. However, the athymic nude mice in general had larger
tumors than wild-type immune-competent mice (WT) (Figures
S3C and S3D), indicating that T cells aside from the exercise sit-
uation play a role in control of tumor growth. To further document
the role of NK cells, circulating NK cells were depleted by admin-
istration of anti-asialo-GM1 antibodies (Figures S3E and S3F).
Depletion of NK cells completely abolished the suppressive
effect of running on tumor volume, and both anti-asialo-GM1-
treated groups (control and exercise, respectively) showed
enhanced tumor growth compared with isotype IgG-treated
mice (p < 0.001, Figure 3I).
Next, we investigated if running affected NK cell cytotoxicity,
but determined per cell basis, NK cells from control and running
mice were equally effective in killing NK-sensitive YAC-1 and
B16 cells (Figure 3J). To exclude that cancer cell killing was
mediated by T cell contamination, the NK-depleted fraction
(NK cell content of 2%) was used as a negative control and
showed no YAC-1 or B16 cell killing. In contrast, within the tu-
mors from the running mice, we found increased mRNA expres-
sion of NK-cell-activating receptor ligands (H60a, MULT1, Clr-b),
556

 as well as cytokines (IL-2, IL-15, IFNg) and chemokines (CCL3,
CXCL10, CX3CL1, Chemerin) related to NK cell activation and
chemotaxis (Figure 3K). No changes in the expression of markers
of angiogenesis (i.e., CD31 and VEGF-A) were observed
(Figure 3K).
Taken together, these data point to a predominant role of NK
cells in the training-dependent control of tumor growth. NK
cells represent a critical component of the innate immune de-
fense, recognizing transformed cells independently of anti-
bodies or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction
(Vivier et al., 2012; Brodin et al., 2012), while T cells are cyto-
toxic effector cells of the adaptive immune response. Both im-
mune cell types are known to be regulated by exercise. During
exercise, circulating lymphocytes increase in number and fre-
quency and then fall below pre-exercise levels (Pedersen and
Hoffman-Goetz, 2000). Of these lymphocytes, NK cells are
the most responsive cells to the exercise-dependent mobiliza-
tion, followed by CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and lastly B cells,
which respond poorly to exercise (Walsh et al., 2011). Thus,
the importance of NK cells in the training-dependent control
of tumor growth follow
their superior responsiveness
to
exercise.

 In addition to the mobilization of the NK cells during exercise,
we found increased expression levels of NK cell-related acti-
vating receptor ligands, stimulatory cytokines, and chemoattrac-
tant chemokines in the tumors of running mice, suggesting that
exercise works both on the mobilization of NK cells, and on the
tumor microenvironment to generate a NK cell activating milieu.
NK cells are regulated by a multitude of activating and inhibitory
receptor-ligand interactions. Here, we show that ligands for the
activating receptor NKG2D, MULT1 and H60a, as well as Clr-
b, a ligand for NKR-P1B, which has proven important in the ed-
ucation of NK cells, were upregulated in the tumors from running
mice (Chen et al., 2015; Rahim et al., 2015). Previously, it has
been shown that B16F10 cells do not express Clr-b (Carlyle
et al., 2004). The methodology employed in this study did not
allow for precise identification of whether Clr-b expression was
attributable to tumor cells, infiltrating immune cells, or other cells
in
the
tumor
microenvironment.
Furthermore,
we
found
increased expression of the activating receptor NKp46 with
wheel running. NKp46 has been shown to mediate control of
B16 metastasis, which correlates well with our results (Glasner
et al., 2012).
IL-6-Sensitive NK Cells Are Recruited by Exercise
through b-Adrenergic Signaling
Exercise has been shown to mobilize NK cells through epineph-
rine (EPI) (Bigley et al., 2014; Dimitrov et al., 2010). Five hours into
the dark period, when wheel running was at its highest, serum
EPI levels were 561.2 ± 157.4 pg/ml in the CON group and
1,169.3 ± 340.2 pg/ml in the EX group (p < 0.001, Figure 4A).
To mimic this acute running response, we injected low and
high doses of EPI (0.5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, respectively) and
found a reduction in both spleen volume (Figure 4B) and the

 number of NK cells in the spleen (Figure 4C). Blocking of the
EPI-dependent mobilization of NK cells by propranolol during
wheel running completely blunted the effect of running on tumor
volume (Figure 4D) and abolished the increased NK cell infiltra-
tion in tumors from running mice (Figure 4E). Propranolol admin-
istration did not alter training-dependent changes in body weight
and muscular expression of the exercise-responsive factor,
PGC-1a (Figures S4A and S4B). To confirm the role of EPI, we
mimicked the exercise-related EPI surge by daily injections of
low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) EPI in non-running mice. This resulted in
a 61% reduction in tumor volume (p < 0.01, Figure 4F) and
tended to increase tumor infiltration of NK cells compared with
non-treated controls (p = 0.059, Figure 4G). This increased infil-
tration did, however, not match the effect seen by running alone.
In addition to the blockade of NK cell infiltration, propranolol
administration tended to block the infiltration of CD3+, CD4+,
and CD8+ cells, while EPI injection tended to mimic the exer-
cise-induced mobilization of these cells (Figures S4C and S4D).
Plasma IL-6 increases dramatically during exercise due to
release from contracting muscles and might be the additional ex-
ercise factor, involved in tumor homing (Pedersen and Febbraio,
2012). In our model, serum IL-6 increased from 4.3 ± 3.5 pg/ml
(range: 1.6–12.4 pg/ml, n = 12) in the CON group to 29.3 ±
32.6 pg/ml (range: 5.7–106.5 pg/ml, n = 10, p < 0.05) during
wheel running. In the spleen, 24.8% ± 8.4% of the NK cells ex-
pressed IL-6Ra and 63.4% ± 7.9% gp130 (Figures 4H and 4I). Af-
ter EPI injection, the fraction of IL-6Ra-positive splenic NK cells
decreased to 12.4% ± 5.3%, suggesting an EPI-dependent
mobilization of IL-6-sensitive NK cells. Blocking of training-
induced IL-6 by anti-IL-6 antibodies diminished the exercise-
induced inhibition of tumor growth (Figure 4J) and inhibited the
infiltration of NK cells into tumors (Figure 4K). In contrast, daily
injections of 100 ng IL-6, which increased serum IL-6 from
2.7 ± 0.9 pg/ml to 301.1 ± 130.3 pg/ml and 263.8 ± 950 pg/ml
at 30 and 60 min, respectively, did not mimic the training-
induced reduction in tumor growth (Figure S4E) or enhanced
NK cell infiltration (Figure S4E). Thus, with this IL-6 concentra-
tion, the redistribution of NK cells seen during running could
not be mimicked, suggesting that the increment in NK cell infiltra-
tion is dependent on concurrent exercise-induced mobilization
of immune cells. Both running and IL-6 injections decreased
the frequency of immature (CD11b�, CD27�) NK cells (p <
0.05, Figure S4E) and tended to increase the frequency of cyto-
toxic (CD11b�, CD27+) NK cells (p = 0.11). In contrast, anti-IL-6
antibody treatment blocked the training-induced increase in
cytotoxic (CD11b�, CD27+, p < 0.05) NK cells but increased
the frequency of cytokine producing (CD11b+, CD27�, p <
0.05) NK cells (Figure S4H).
The epinephrine surge during exercise can mobilize NK cells
to the blood stream through activation of their b-adrenergic re-
ceptors, increasing the NK cell frequency but not their cytotox-
icity (Dimitrov et al., 2010). Early studies suggest that a rela-
tively small increase in epinephrine level is sufficient to
mobilize NK cells. Thus, to obtain the physiological changes,
which we observe within the tumors, additional stimuli must
be present. To this end, we observed a selective mobilization
of IL-6Ra-positive NK cells after epinephrine injection. In
further support of the role of IL-6 in NK cell redistribution
and activation, recombinant human IL-6 infusion has been
shown to mimic the acute and transient lymphopenia seen dur-
ing the recovery from exercise (Steensberg et al., 2003), and
stimulation of human NK cells with IL-6 has been shown to in-
crease their expression of adhesion molecules (Rabinowich
et al., 1993).
Yet, the role of IL-6 in cancer is complex. Chronic elevated
plasma levels of IL-6 have been associated with poor disease
outcome across a number of cancer diagnoses, whereas
increased IL-6 expression within tumors is a positive prognostic
marker for overall and disease-free survival (Dethlefsen et al.,
2013; Mauer et al., 2015). In particular for the DEN-induced liver
model, used in this study, Naugler and colleagues showed that
IL-6 KO mice were resistant to DEN-induced tumor formation
(Naugler et al., 2007). In contrast to these models, plasma IL-6
displays a dynamic response during exercise. The exercise-
induced surge in plasma IL-6 may signal directly to IL-6Ra-ex-
pressing
cells
or
through
its
alternative
pathway,
IL-6
trans-signaling (Kraakman et al., 2015; Scheller et al., 2014).
We show that about 25% of the splenic NK cells express IL-
6Ra and are thus directly sensitive to classical IL-6 signaling.
Regarding IL-6 trans-signaling, IL-6 binds the soluble IL-6 recep-
tor and then this complex binds to membrane-bound gp130. The
concentration of the soluble IL-6 receptor is about 40 ng/ml, thus
there is a large buffer capacity for IL-6 binding, when IL-6 in-
creases as seen during wheel running. Thus, the systemic IL-6
increase during wheel running can signal either directly through
the classical IL-6 signaling or through trans-signaling to NK cells.
In Figure 2, we showed a 2.3- to 3.0-fold increase in IL-6 expres-
sion in the tumors of running mice, yet following on the impor-
tance of classical IL-6 signaling and IL-6 trans-signaling, this
suggests that the exercise-induced increase in systemic IL-6
levels play a greater role than the intratumoral concentration of
IL-6 in NK cell redistribution and activation.
In further support of the beneficial role of IL-6 exclusively in the
exercise setting, we found no protective beneficial effect of IL-6
injection alone on tumor growth or intratumoral NK cell infiltra-
tion, stressing the dependence on prior training-dependent
mobilization of NK cells. IL-6 and exercise have previously
been shown to increase tumor vascularization (Taniguchi and
Karin, 2014), yet we did not find any effect of IL-6 or running
on CD31 and VEGF-A mRNA expression levels, nor did we
detect any marked increases in capillarization in our histological
analyses (data not shown).
In conclusion, voluntary wheel running inhibits tumor onset
and progression across a range of tumor models and anatomical
locations. This occurs through a direct regulation of NK cell traf-
ficking, involving an epinephrine-dependent mobilization of NK
cells to the circulation and an IL-6-dependent redistribution to
tumors. The clinical relevance of infiltrating T cells is evident
(Fridman et al., 2012), while the potential of tumor-infiltrating
NK cells is still being unraveled (Remark et al., 2013). NK cells
are part of the early innate immune response and can activate
other immune cells through secretion of IFNg (Gross et al.,
2013). Thus, a key action of NK cells is to deliver the initial
‘‘spark’’ that activates other cell types of the immune system.
Currently, clinical attention is on generating an inflammatory
intratumoral
environment
through
among
others
immune
checkpoint blockade therapy (Topalian et al., 2015). The present
study indicates that exercise might deliver such therapeutic

 intratumoral adaptations with increased immune cell infiltration
and generation of an inflammatory intratumoral environment.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All methods and interventions are described in details in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Animal Studies and Interventions
Studies were compliant with the ARRIVE guidelines and approved by the
Danish Inspectorate for Research Animals. Exercise were provided by running
wheels (diameter 12 cm). The mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 2 3
105 B16F10 melanoma or Lewis Lung cells (cells obtained from ATCC) or i.v.
through the tail vein with 1 3 105 B16F10 cells. For DEN-induced liver tumors,
23-day-old NMRI male mice obtained from Harlan, were injected intraperito-
neally (i.p.) with DEN (25 mg/kg body weight). The Tg(Grm1)EPv mice were ob-
tained from the University of Graz, after 2 weeks of acclimatization, running
wheels were placed in the home cages.
Anti-Asialo Treatment
To deplete NK cells, mice received anti- Asialo GM1 antibodies (1 mg/ml, EBio-
Science) or isotype antibodies as control (Rabbit IgG, 0.5 mg/ml, Southern
Biotech) every second day from 1 week before B16 inoculation. Five days after
tumor cell inoculation, NK cells content was evaluated.
Propranolol/Epinephrine Study
Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized to drinking water containing
0.5 g/l propranolol or nothing. Propranolol administration started 1 week
before B16 inoculation. An additional group received daily (Monday to Friday)
injections of epinephrine (0.5 mg/kg, 200 ml i.p.) from 1 week before B16 inoc-
ulation. For the acute effect of epinephrine, mice were injected with 0.5 mg/kg
or 2 mg/kg epinephrine, and sacrified after 30 min, where blood, spleen, and
muscle tissue were collected.
Anti-IL-6/IL-6 Study
Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomized to groups, receiving i.p. injec-
tions of anti-IL-6 antibodies (100 mg/mouse, R&D systems, #AB-406-NA) or
vehicle injections twice a week from 1 week before B16 inoculation. An addi-
tional group received daily (Monday to Friday) injections of IL-6 (100 ng/mouse,
R&D systems, #406-ML-025/CF) from 1 week before B16 inoculation.
Statistics
For comparisons of exercise and other interventions, two-way ANOVA fol-
lowed by post hoc tests with Bonferroni corrections were performed. Two-
way ANOVA with repeated-measures was used when the effects of experi-
mental factors was analyzed at different timepoints. In the injection studies,
one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test was performed. The statistical sig-
nificance of mRNA and protein expression levels in CON and EX groups was
obtained from two-tailed multiple t tests. Results are depicted as means ±
SEM. The criterion for significance was p < 0.05.
