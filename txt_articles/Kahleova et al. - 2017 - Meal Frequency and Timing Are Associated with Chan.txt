Abstract
Background: Scientific evidence for the optimal number, timing, and size of meals is lacking.
Objective: We investigated the relation between meal frequency and timing and changes in body mass index (BMI) in the
Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2), a relatively healthy North American cohort.
Methods: The analysis used data from 50,660 adult members aged $30 y of Seventh-day Adventist churches in the
United States and Canada (mean 6 SD follow-up: 7.42 6 1.23 y). The number of meals per day, length of overnight fast,
consumption of breakfast, and timing of the largest meal were exposure variables. The primary outcome was change in
BMI per year. Linear regression analyses (stratified on baseline BMI) were adjusted for important demographic and
lifestyle factors.
Results: Subjects who ate 1 or 2 meals/d had a reduction in BMI per year (in kg � m22 � y21) (20.035; 95% CI: 20.065,
20.004 and 20.029; 95% CI: 20.041, 20.017, respectively) compared with those who ate 3 meals/d. On the other hand,
eating >3 meals/d (snacking) was associated with a relative increase in BMI (P < 0.001). Correspondingly, the BMI of
subjects who had a long overnight fast ($18 h) decreased compared with those who had a medium overnight fast (12–17 h)
(P < 0.001). Breakfast eaters (20.029; 95% CI: 20.047, 20.012; P < 0.001) experienced a decreased BMI compared with
breakfast skippers. Relative to subjects who ate their largest meal at dinner, those who consumed breakfast as the largest
meal experienced a significant decrease in BMI (20.038; 95% CI: 20.048, 20.028), and those who consumed a big lunch
experienced a smaller but still significant decrease in BMI than did those who ate their largest meal at dinner.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that in relatively healthy adults, eating less frequently, no snacking, consuming
breakfast, and eating the largest meal in the morning may be effective methods for preventing long-term weight gain.
Eating breakfast and lunch 5–6 h apart and making the overnight fast last 18–19 h may be a useful practical
strategy.

Introduction
Like macronutrient composition and quality, meal frequency
and timing are important aspects of nutrition. Excessive energy
intake increases the risk of obesity and chronic disease, and
obesity is a leading cause of disability and death in Western
countries (1). A large proportion of the increased risk of obesity
and chronic disease is related to aging (2, 3). Eating more
frequently (snacking) is often recommended as a strategy for
weight loss. It is presumed to reduce hunger (4) and thus energy
intake and body weight.
However, the widely held opinion that eating more frequently
is better for weight control than eating larger meals less frequently
is not as scientifically well established as many believe. Some
observational studies have suggested that people who consumed
more snacks were less likely to be obese (5), but other large
prospective studies seemed to have shown that frequent snacking
leads to weight gain (6, 7), increased abdominal and liver fat (8),
and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (9, 10) not only
because of the higher energy intake mainly from added sugars

 (11) but also because of increased food stimuli (12), hunger, and
the desire to eat (13).
In keeping with this, reduced meal frequency can prevent the
development of obesity and chronic diseases and extend life
spans in laboratory animals (14, 15). Mice under time-restricted
feeding consumed equivalent calories from a high-fat diet as
those with ad libitum access yet were protected against obesity
and diabetes (16, 17). Intermittent fasting leads to a prolonged
life span and positively affects glucose tolerance, insulin sensi-
tivity, and incidence of type 2 diabetes in mice (14, 15, 18–21).
The effect of meal frequency on body weight in humans has
been studied in only a small number of randomized clinical
trials. These trials typically included small numbers of partic-
ipants (maximum: 40), were only short term (maximum: 8.5 wk),
and varied greatly in meal frequency manipulations (range:
1–12 meals/d). A thorough summary and overview of these trials
has been published recently (22). An important consideration rel-
evant to meal frequency is macronutrient quality. Some research
suggests that the higher consumption of protein more frequently
may be beneficial in overweight subjects (23). The Dietary Guide-
lines Advisory Committee stated in 2010 that there was a lack of
research on meal frequency and body-weight management in
humans and that research on this topic was greatly needed (24).
Data on meal timing have been better established than those
on meal frequency. Some studies have suggested that eating meals
later in the evening may adversely influence the success of a
weight-loss therapy (25, 26). It has also been observed that eating
breakfast regularly may protect against weight gain (27, 28) by
reducing absolute energy intake within the day (29). Based on the
existing data, the 2010 US dietary guidelines included a specific
recommendation for breakfast consumption (30).
In this study, we sought to investigate the relation between
meal frequency and timing and changes in BMI (in kg/m2)
among subjects in the Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2), a
relatively healthy population in the United States and Canada,
and longitudinally assess weight change over a mean of >7 y. We
hypothesized that increased meal frequency, together with a
shorter overnight fast, would be associated with increases in
BMI and that skipping breakfast and having dinner as the largest
meal of the day would also be associated with an increase in
BMI. We tested these hypotheses in a large number of free-living
subjects who had a wide variety of baseline body sizes and were
studied over a period of several years.
Methods
Study design and subject selection. Recruitment and selection
methods of the cohort have been described previously (31). Briefly, adult
members of Seventh-day Adventist churches throughout the United
States and Canada aged $30 y were enrolled and completed the baseline
AHS-2 ‘‘Connecting Lifestyle to Disease and Longevity’’ questionnaire,
which included medical history, dietary habits, physical activity, and
demographic information. Follow-up through the biennial Hospital
History Form (HHF) recorded hospitalizations, major health events, and
some lifestyle and demographic factors. In the fourth biennial HHF
(HHF4), the questions about meal frequency and timing were asked.
Approximately 27% of the cohort was black with US and Caribbean
origin, and the remaining participants were primarily white, with a minor
proportion from other races. The Loma Linda University Institutional
Review Board approved the study protocol, and all study participants
provided written consent at the time of enrollment.
The following exclusions were implemented: age <30 y, invalid
responses corresponding to unanswered pages or sections of the question-
naire, missing values for main exposure variables, BMI out of range (<14 or
>60) at baseline or HHF4, weight changes >100 kg between baseline and
HHF4, <4 or >11 h of sleep, and the last meal of the day before 1100. The
numbers of participants excluded are shown in Supplemental Figure 1.
Outcome data. The primary outcome of interest was change in BMI per
year comparing BMI at baseline with that ascertained later from HHF4.
The change per year accounted for variable follow-up time. BMI was
calculated from self-reported height and weight ascertained in both
questionnaires. A high validity of self-reported BMI has been demon-
strated previously in this population, in which the correlation coefficient
with measured values was 0.97 (32).
Exposure variables. In HHF4, study participants were also asked to
give the exact times of the largest and smallest meals and of all other
meals and snacks consumed per day. The number of meals and snacks
consumed per day, length of overnight fast, consumption of breakfast,
and timing of the largest meal were the exposure variables. Breakfast was
defined as a meal eaten between 0500 and 1100, lunch between 1200
and 1600, and dinner between 1700 and 2300.
Dietary assessment and dietary covariates. Dietary intake was
assessed with the use of a self-administered FFQ at baseline. The FFQ
was calibrated against multiple 24-h dietary recalls. In general, validity
correlations were moderate to high for macronutrients, FAs, vitamins,
minerals, and fiber (33). Dietary patterns were derived from the reported
consumption of foods. We used total energy intake, protein consump-
tion, and dietary pattern as the dietary covariates.
Lifestyle and sociodemographic covariate data. Sociodemographic
and lifestyle factors were assessed with the use of a questionnaire at
baseline and included age, sex, marital status, minutes of exercise per
week, hours of daily sleep, hours of television watching per day, and high
blood pressure medication use. Ethnicity was categorized as black and
nonblack. Education was categorized as high school or less, some college,
and a bachelor�s degree or higher. Personal income was categorized as
<$20,000, $$20,000–50,000, and >$50,000/y.
Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed with the use of SAS/STAT
version 9.4 (SAS Institute). Linear regression analyses stratified on
baseline BMI (4 categories) included adjustments for age, sex, ethnicity,
marital status, education, personal income, dietary pattern, exercise,
sleep, television watching, energy intake, and use of high blood pressure
medications. The dependent variable was BMI at HHF4 – BMI at
baseline O years to provide a rate of change.
Moderate- to large-valued correlations between some exposure vari-
ables of interest (collinearity) necessitated 2 separate analyses. The time of
the largest meal and all covariates were used in both models, with the
length of overnight fast in the first model and number of meals and snacks
and eating breakfast in the second model. The one significant interaction
with larger estimates was retained and was present in both models
(interaction between race and lunch as the largest meal). All covariates
were set at the reference or mean values (for categorical and continuous
variables, respectively) to capture the effect of the main exposure variables.
A total of 8909 subjects were excluded from the analysis because
of missing data (Supplemental Figure 1). All tests were of the null
hypothesis that the b coefficient estimating the effect of interest was zero
(Wald test). Significance was defined as a = 0.05.
Results
The baseline characteristics of this nonsmoking Adventist study
population are shown in Table 1. We analyzed data from 50,660
subjects, and the mean 6 SD follow-up time was 7 6 1 y. The
mean 6 SD change in BMI per year was 0 6 0.4, but it was
dependent on age: participants aged #60 y experienced increases
in BMI on average in contrast to those of an older age, whose BMI
decreased over time (Figure 1). Thus, the term relative increase or
decrease in BMI per year was necessary because of the striking

 underlying age trends. For instance, a relatively decreased BMI
compared with some reference situation may still be an absolute
increase (but less so) in younger subjects.
As shown in Figure 2, eating 1 (prevalence: 1.7%) or 2
(prevalence: 10.3%) meals/d was associated with a relative de-
crease in BMI (20.05; 95% CI: 20.07, 20.02 and 20.03; 95% CI:
20.04, 20.02, respectively) compared with eating 3 meals/d
(prevalence: 44.8%). On the other hand, eating >3 meals (snacking)
compared with 3 meals/d was associated with a relative increase in
BMI per year [0.02 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.03); 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01,
0.03); and 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.06)] for 4 (prevalence: 26.5%), 5
(prevalence: 13%), and $6 (prevalence: 3.8%) meals/d, respec-
tively. We observed a linear association between the number of
meals eaten per day and changes in BMI: more meals per day were
associated with a greater increase in BMI, even within the
snacking range (>3 meals/d; P-trend <0.001) (Figure 2A).
Corresponding to the meal frequency results, subjects who
had a long overnight fast (prevalence: 8.1%) experienced a relative
decrease in BMI per year (20.02; 95% CI: 20.03, 20.004) in
contrast to those with a short overnight fast (prevalence: 14.2%)
whose BMI was relatively increased (0.02; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.03),
both compared with a medium overnight fast (prevalence: 77.7%)
of 12–17 h (P-trend <0.001) (Figure 2B).
Breakfast eaters (prevalence: 93.4%) experienced a relative
decrease in their BMI compared with breakfast skippers (prev-
alence: 6.6%) (20.03; 95% CI: 20.04, 20.01; P < 0.001) (Figure
2C). Those whose largest meal was breakfast (prevalence: 21.1%)
experienced the largest relative decrease in BMI (20.04;
95% CI: 20.05, 20.03) compared with those who ate their
largest meal at dinner (prevalence: 37.3%), and those who ate
lunch as the largest meal (prevalence: 41.6%) experienced a smaller
relative decrease in BMI (20.02; 95% CI: 20.03, 20.01; P-trend
<0.001) (Figure 2D).
A borderline significant interaction was observed between
eating the largest meal at lunch and race on the change in BMI
(P = 0.07) (Figure 3). Eating lunch as the largest meal of the day
was associated with a relative decrease in BMI only in nonblack
subjects (Figure 3). There was little evidence of interactions with
age and no significant differences.

 Discussion
Principal findings. This study investigated the relation between
meal frequency, timing, and changes in BMI in the AHS-2 cohort.
In accordance with our hypotheses, we demonstrated that eating
1 or 2 meals/d was associated with a relative decrease in BMI
compared with 3 meals/d. Furthermore, participants who ate
>3 meals/d experienced a relative increase in BMI: the more
meals and snacks per day, the greater the increase in BMI.
Correspondingly, the change in BMI among those with a long
overnight fast was relatively decreased compared with those
with a medium overnight fast, but both had a relatively
decreased change in BMI compared with those with a short
overnight fast. Breakfast eaters experienced a relative decrease
in their BMI compared with breakfast skippers. Those eating
their largest meal at breakfast experienced a relatively large
decrease in BMI compared with those eating their largest meal
at lunch or dinner.
A striking feature of these analyses is that there were
underlying powerful age-dependent trends in BMI that the meal
patterns could nevertheless modify. BMI increased in subjects
aged <60 y and decreased on average thereafter (Figure 1). Thus,
meal patterns that favor relative decreases in BMI may not always
be healthful in subjects already experiencing substantial decreases
for other reasons such as chronic disease.
Findings in relation to other research. The finding that
eating less frequently (and eating no snacks) may prevent or
reduce increases in BMI is consistent with 2 previous large
prospective studies that found that frequent eating (and
snacking) is associated with a greater risk of a 5-kg weight
gain or risk of developing overweight and obesity (6, 7), mainly
because of unhealthy food choices (34) and uncontrolled energy
balance (35). These studies were limited to a fixed 5-kg weight
change or exceeding particular BMI values rather than treating
weight change as a continuous variable as we did.
The positive linear response with meal frequency observed in
our study even within the snacking range (>3 meals/d) highlights
the potential importance of these findings from a public health
perspective, although macronutrient quality must also be
considered. We performed analyses with the exposure being the
number of eating episodes to give more power when reflecting
changes in BMI. The snacks-alone analyses added no more
information than those scored as >3 eating episodes.
The association that we describe between a long overnight
fast and a relative decrease in BMI provides further support for
the benefits of less frequent eating. Our results are in strong
agreement with animal studies that have demonstrated protec-
tive effects of intermittent fasting regimens against the develop-
ment of obesity (14, 15). Thus, a consideration of this variable
views meal frequency and changes in body size from a different
perspective.
The observed relation between breakfast consumption and a
relative decrease in BMI is also in line with previous studies (27,
28). It has been shown that people who usually skip breakfast
have an increased risk of obesity and obesity-related chronic
diseases (28, 36, 37). Our study adds to this evidence.
This study has a relatively precise timing for the largest meal.
Two other studies have also suggested that consuming a large
meal in the morning may be an effective weight-loss strategy (38,
39). The ability to examine the timing of the largest meal
provides information about the distribution of total energy
intake during the day. Eating 2 large meals/d, breakfast and
lunch, and having a longer overnight fast every day, is a
historically recommended Adventist meal pattern. Its benefits
and potential risks and its effects on protein synthesis and energy
balance need to be further studied in large-scale long-term
studies as well as in randomized clinical trials.
The relatively small estimated effects on BMI per year of each
meal frequency and timing exposure variable were similar in size
to a study that evaluated effects of dietary differences on BMI over
time in another population containing many vegetarians (40).
However, from a public health perspective, having a population of
young adults avoid a weight gain of 12–15 pounds, which is often
very difficult to lose in a healthy fashion, would be a great
advantage. It is also likely that by following a change in meal
pattern there may be a period of more rapid relative change in BMI
for several months.
Our results also differ from most other reports in that they
describe the outcome of change in BMI as a continuous variable
over time in relation to meal frequency and timing. Thus, all
subjects provided an endpoint, not just those who achieved a
fixed BMI or BMI change endpoint. The striking underlying
dependency of the direction of the BMI change variable on age
($60 y) complicates the interpretation of the meaning of such
trends, particularly seeing that as distinct from the underlying
trend the directions of the effects of meal frequency and timing
on changes in BMI seem to be the similar at all ages. Similar
trends in changes in BMI with age have been reported from
Australia (41), Norway (42), and Sweden (43), although the
oldest age groups were not represented in these studies. We
performed separate analyses for those aged #60 and >60 y, and
the effects of meal frequency and timing on changes in BMI
seemed very similar in magnitude and direction.
Potential mechanisms. Although the exact mechanisms linking
meal frequency and timing and the regulation of body weight
are, to our knowledge, unknown, we suggest several potential
pathways. First, satiety hormones, such as leptin or ghrelin, may
be involved. Ghrelin is a fast-acting orexigenic hormone, and its
FIGURE 1

variables, and k the K covariates. Data are the predicted values of change

Meal frequency, timing, and changes in BMI
1725

 concentrations increase preprandially and especially at night (44).
Correspondingly, hunger has its intrinsic circadian peak in the
evening, promoting the tendency to eat the largest meals late in
the day (45). However, eating a large breakfast reduces hunger,
cravings (especially for sweets and fats), and postprandial ghrelin
concentrations, thus counteracting weight gain (46). Postprandial
ghrelin suppression depends on insulin release, and frequent
eating seems to disrupt this relation similar to other insulin-
resistant states (47). It is possible that some with shorter overnight
fasts who snack at night have a sleep disorder. Sleep disorders
have inconsistently been associated with weight gain in adults (48,
49). Thus, it may be that these changes in meal patterns affect
energy intake and hence body weight in several ways.
Second, meal frequency and timing can reset and amplify the
peripheral circadian clocks and the clock genes that control
downstream metabolic pathways, which are perturbed in obesity
and metabolic disease (50). It has been shown in experimental
models and in humans that both feeding and fasting change
transcription rates and the circadian phase of these genes (51,
52). Time-restricted feeding seems to improve the circadian
oscillations of the key metabolic regulators such as cAMP re-
sponse element-binding protein, mammalian target of rapamycin,
and AMP-activated protein kinase (16).
Third, experimental data have also suggested that reduced meal
frequency (and intermittent fasting) can prevent the development of
obesity and is associated with less oxidative damage as well as higher
stress resistance through the production of protein chaperones
(e.g., heat-shock proteins) and growth factors (such as brain-derived
neurotrophic factor) (14, 15), possibly because of improved adipose
tissue signaling and subsequent less increase of fat depots (53).
Finally, regular breakfast consumption seems to increase satiety,
reduce total energy intake, improve overall dietary quality (increas-
ing especially consumption of fiber- and nutrient-rich foods com-
monly consumed at breakfast), reduce blood lipids, and improve
insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance at a subsequent meal (28,
37, 54). There is also evidence of an increase in physical-activity
thermogenesis, increase in adipose tissue insulin sensitivity, and
more stable plasma glucose concentrations (lower glucose variabil-
ity) during the day as a result of daily breakfast consumption (54).
On the other hand, eating meals in the evening generally has the

 opposite effects (55), all of which adversely affect body weight
regulation.
Strengths and weaknesses. This study has several strengths,
including a long-term longitudinal (although nonprospective)
study design with a large number of participants and relatively
high percentage of participants eating breakfast as their largest
meal. The population was diverse in terms of age, sex, race,
geographic location, and socioeconomic status, enhancing the
relevance of its findings to the North American population. We
used clearly specified measurements of dietary practices and
extensive data on covariates with which to explore confounders
and mediators of the associations under investigation. There were
no major differences between the analytical sample and the
excluded participants in BMI, age, sex, or meal frequency. One
unique feature of our study lies in the more precise meal timing,
which enabled us to assess the impact of the duration of the
overnight fast and the timing of the largest meal more accurately.
Another distinction of this study is the fact that we followed
people with a wide range of age and BMI and observed significant
changes in BMI in relation to meal frequency and timing across all
ages, even in seniors who had lost weight during the follow-up.
Potential weaknesses include the nonprospective nature of
our analyses because the meal pattern exposure variables were
not gathered at the beginning of the follow-up. Thus, reverse
causation must be considered. If those experiencing increasing
weight were motivated to start consuming calories earlier in the
day (i.e., breakfast), this would be inconsistent with our results.
If such persons for some reason were instead motivated to
consume calories later in the day, this could be consistent with
our results. Stratifying on baseline BMI constrains the analyses
to be within subjects having similar BMI starting points, which
would be expected to partially compensate for such hypothe-
sized cognitive effects. Furthermore, because of the strong age-
related trends in BMI after the age of 60 y, even those with
relative weight gains will actually usually be losing weight. This
makes a reverse cause motivated by cognitive consequences of
weight changes less plausible (although not impossible) because
the changes observed by subjects, although relatively higher or
lower, will often not reflect those descriptors in absolute terms.
However, similar effects remain across the age spectrum.
The response rate at HHF4 was ;55% of the cohort at
baseline, so some response bias was possible. Probable errors in
self-reported measures of meal frequency and timing (which were
not validated) and other lifestyle-related data are acknowledged.
Another potential weakness is the lack of information on the
amount of food consumed per eating episode when seeking to
explain observed associations. Although appropriate adjustments
for confounders were made, there is still a possibility of some
residual confounding. We were not able to differentiate between
intentional and unintentional weight loss. Our subjects were
health-conscious, nonsmokers, mostly nondrinkers, and those who
eat less meat than the general population. However, there is no
reason to believe that others subscribing to similar habits would
not experience the same results. As with all observational studies,
caution must be exercised in inferring causation from the results.
In conclusion, our results suggest that eating less frequently (and
eating no snacks), consuming breakfast, and eating the largest
meal in the morning may be effective long-term preventive tools
against weight gain for those in whom this would be unhealthy.
Eating only 2 meals/d, breakfast and lunch 5–6 h apart, may also
be an interesting strategy for weight control. Although the
annual effects of these meal patterns on BMI are small, they may
be very important across a lifetime. The practical implication
may be different for younger subjects who are prone to gain
weight than for seniors who in contrast tend to lose weight and
in whom the suggested meal pattern changes may further
increase weight loss. Novel preventive and therapeutic strate-
gies should incorporate not only the energy and macronutrient
content but also meal frequency and timing. Future research on
mechanisms might also include validated data on total energy
intake and expenditure and include them as covariants in the
model. Large-scale long-term prospective studies studying BMI
change as a continuous variable would also be valuable for
exploring these ideas further.
