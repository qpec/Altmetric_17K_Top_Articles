Background. For most classes of drugs, rapid development of therapeutics to treat emerging infections is challenged by the 
timelines needed to identify compounds with the desired efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Fully human monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) provide an attractive method to overcome many of these hurdles to rapidly produce therapeutics for emerging 
diseases.
Methods. In this study, we deployed a platform to generate, test, and develop fully human antibodies to Zaire ebolavirus. We 
obtained specific anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) antibodies by immunizing VelocImmune mice that use human immunoglobulin variable 
regions in their humoral responses.
Results. Of the antibody clones isolated, 3 were selected as best at neutralizing EBOV and triggering FcγRIIIa. Binding studies 
and negative-stain electron microscopy revealed that the 3 selected antibodies bind to non-overlapping epitopes, including a poten-
tially new protective epitope not targeted by other antibody-based treatments. When combined, a single dose of a cocktail of the 3 
antibodies protected nonhuman primates (NHPs) from EBOV disease even after disease symptoms were apparent.
Conclusions. This antibody cocktail provides complementary mechanisms of actions, incorporates novel specificities, and 
demonstrates high-level postexposure protection from lethal EBOV disease in NHPs. It is now undergoing testing in normal healthy 
volunteers in preparation for potential use in future Ebola epidemics.
Keywords. EBOV; filovirus; monoclonal antibodies; treatment.
 
The 2013–2016 Ebola virus pandemic in West Africa resulted 
in more than 28 000 cases and ~11 000 deaths throughout 
Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia (http://www.who.int/csr/
disease/ebola/en/). Despite being ultimately controlled, Zaire 
ebolavirus (EBOV) and other single-stranded ribonucleic acid 
viruses in the Filoviridae family, continue to pose a high risk 
for causing epidemics with high mortality rates [1]. In addition 
to the mortality associated with acute infections and disease, 
sequelae of EBOV infections include neurological and ocular 
complications, joint and muscle pain, and virus persistence for 
many months [2, 3]. This persistence is particularly concerning 
from the public health perspective given that most of the pop-
ulation is still immune naive. Currently, there are no approved 
therapies or vaccines to treat or prevent infections by EBOV or 
other filoviruses, necessitating development of clinical-grade 
therapeutics.
The main target of EBOV vaccines and therapeutic antibod-
ies is the virus glycoprotein (GP), which is currently the only 
validated therapeutic target on the virion surface. Glycoprotein 
is produced from an alternative transcript of the GP gene, with 
soluble GP (sGP) being the main product [4]. Glycoprotein is a 
class I fusion protein that is posttranslationally cleaved by furin 
into 2 disulphide-linked subunits (GP1 and GP2) that form a 
trimer of heterodimers on the surface of the virion and infected 
cells [5, 6]. Once host cell-bound virions are internalized into 
endosomes, the viruses are exposed to low pH, and further pro-
teolytic cleavage of GP reveals GP1 surfaces that bind the endo-
somal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), which is required 
for penetration of the nucleocapsid into the cell cytoplasm [7] 
and initiation of replication. The sGPs can be readily detected

in the sera of infected animals, and patients and plays a role in 
pathogenesis [8].
Multiple lines of evidence support GP as an effective thera-
peutic target. Live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis 
virus (rVSV) vaccine decorated with EBOV GP protects non-
human primates (NHPs) from EBOV challenge [9]. Protection 
induced by this rVSV vaccine correlated with development of 
GP-targeting antibodies [10]. The vaccine was used in a ring 
vaccination, open-label, cluster-randomized trial during the 
2013–2016 pandemic and showed evidence of efficacy and safety 
in preventing EBOV disease when administered to primary and 
secondary contacts of infected patients during an outbreak [11]. 
In addition, GP-specific antibodies isolated from survivors of 
EBOV infection or immunized animals have been shown 
to effectively treat EBOV disease in infected NHPs [12–14]. 
 
However, efficacious therapeutic antibody preparations are 
likely to require the combination of neutralizing and non-
neutralizing antibodies with multiple mechanisms of action, 
including antibody effector functions [15].
The risk of new filovirus epidemics calls for development 
and production of therapeutics that can be rapidly deployed. 
To date, EBOV antibody therapies have been developed either 
by humanization of rodent-generated antibodies or by isola-
tion of antibody genes from infected patients. Each method has 
significant drawbacks: antibody therapeutics have also faced 
supply constraints due to challenges with production methods 
[16], requirements for sequence reverse engineering [17], and/
or lack of manufacturing-ready cell lines, thereby preventing 
large-scale production and controlled testing for treatment 
of EBOV disease. In this study, we describe the use of a plat-
form to generate, select, test, and manufacture a panel of fully 
human, noncross-competing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to 
treat EBOV disease. Mice encoding fully human antibody vari-
able region gene segments (VelocImmune mice) [18, 19] were 
immunized, and 3 EBOV GP-binding antibodies with comple-
mentary biological properties were identified. Chinese hamster 
ovary (CHO) isogenic cell banks expressing each of these mAbs 
individually were made, and mAbs were immediately manu-
factured. When used as a cocktail, the 3 mAbs reversed severe 
disease symptoms and greatly promoted survival of rhesus 
macaques when administered at 5 days post-EBOV challenge, 
late in the disease course in this animal model. In this study, we 
describe the biological properties of the antibodies, where they 
bind to GP, and the outcomes of testing in the NHP model of 
disease.
METHODS
Viruses and Cell Lines
293T cells (human embryonic kidney [HEK] cell line, obtained 
from American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]) and Huh-7 
cells (human hepatocarcinoma cell line, obtained from JCRB 
Cell Bank) were grown in high glucose Dulbecco’s modified 
Eagle’s media ([DMEM] Gibco) containing 10% v/v fetal bovine 
serum ([FBS] Gibco), 1% l-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicil-
lin/streptomycin; Gibco) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Vero 
E6 (monkey kidney epithelial cells, obtained from ATCC) were 
grown in minimal essential media (Corning) supplemented 
with 10% v/v FBS (Sigma Aldrich), 1% l-glutamine (Gibco), 
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bio Products) at 37°C 
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The EESYR CHO cell line is derived 
from CHO cells (CHO cell line, obtained from ATCC) and has 
been previously described (US Patent 7 771 997). Transfections 
were performed using Lipofectamine LTX and Plus Reagent 
(Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The Makona strain of EBOV was originally isolated by 
Dr. Stephan Gunther [20] and was obtained with permis-
sion through Dr. Gary Kobinger (Special Pathogens Program, 
National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of 
Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba). The Mayinga strain of EBOV 
was obtained from Dr. Heinrich Feldmann (Laboratory of 
Virology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
[NIAID], National Institutes of Health, Rocky Mountain 
Laboratories, Hamilton, MT).
The EBOV kikwit-9510621 was used for animal challenges 
at Texas Biomedical Research Institute. A second cell-culture 
passage (P2) of EBOV kikwit-9510621 was obtained from Dr. 
Tom Ksiazek (at NIAID’s World Reference Center for Emerging 
Viruses and Arboviruses at University of Texas Medical Branch’s 
Health Galveston National Laboratory) in 2012 and propagated 
at Texas Biomedical Research Institute. The stock virus was pas-
saged for a third time in Vero E6 cells and had a titer of 2.1 × 105 
plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL. The challenge stock has been 
confirmed to be wild-type EBOV by deep sequencing and was 
attributed the lot no. 201209171. Sequencing showed that the 
abundance of the genomes possess 7U at the editing site locus 
is 94.3%
Guinea pig-adapted EBOV master originated from human 
serum specimen (057931) that was passaged as previously 
described [21]. A stock of the virus was kindly provided by Dr. 
Heinrich Feldman. Stocks were used to infect Vero E6 cells and 
incubated until a 3+ cytopathic effect was observed, and then 
the supernatant was removed, clarified, and frozen in aliquots. 
Virus stocks were counted by conventional plaque titration.
Nucleic Acids
Codon-optimized 
complementary 
deoxyribonucleic 
acid 
(DNA) sequence encoding for EBOV GP (Makona strain; 
GenBank no. KJ660346) was synthesized and cloned into 
expression vectors using standard methods. psPAX2 and 
pWPXLd-GFP encoding for human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) gag pol and green fluorescent protein in the context 
of an HIV genome were obtained from the Tronolab (Ecole 
Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland). pCK-retro-
luc was described before [22].

Proteins
Soluble EBOV GP (Makona strain) was purchased from Sino 
Biological.
Generation and Expression of Anti-Ebola Virus Glycoprotein Antibodies
VelocImmune mice [18, 19] comprising DNA encoding human 
immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and kappa light chain variable 
regions and mouse constant regions were immunized with 
DNA expression EBOV GP and purified EBOV GP protein 
as immunogens using standard techniques. When the desired 
immune response was achieved, splenocytes were harvested.
Splenocytes fusion and isolation of EBOV GP-reactive B 
cells were performed using previously described methods [22]. 
The most potent antibodies for binding, neutralization, and 
FcγRIIIa signaling were selected for subsequent analysis.
Recombinant anti-EBOV GP antibodies were produced in 
CHO cells after stable transfection with paired expression plas-
mids containing heavy chain and light chain derived from the 
same B cell. Antibodies were purified from culture supernatants 
by Protein A affinity chromatography. Clinical-grade antibody 
was further processed via nonaffinity column chromatography 
and dedicated virus removal/inactivation steps.
Binding of Antibodies to Purified EBOV-GP Protein
Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD values) for the interac-
tion of anti-EBOV GP antibodies and recombinant EBOV GP 
protein were determined via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 
using a Biacore 4000 instrument (GE Healthcare). Specific 
Biacore kinetic sensorgrams were obtained by the standard 
double-referencing procedure. The kinetic parameters were 
obtained by globally fitting the data to a 1:1 binding model 
using Biacore 4000 Evaluation curve-fitting software. The disso-
ciation rate constant (kd) was determined by fitting the change 
in the binding response during the dissociation phase, and the 
association rate constant (ka) was determined by fitting EBOV 
GP binding at different concentrations. The KD was calculated 
from the ratio of the kd and ka. The dissociative half-life (t1/2) 
was calculated as ln2/kd.
Binding of Antibodies to Purified Soluble EBOV-sGP Protein
Binding of anti-EBOV GP antibodies to soluble EBOV-sGP 
was determined using a real-time, label-free biolayer inter-
ferometry assay (BLI) Octet HTX system at 25°C in HBS-EP 
Octet buffer (10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM ethylene-
diaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], and 0.05% [vol/vol] surfactant 
Tween-20, pH 7.4, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin [BSA]) with 
the plate shaking at 1000 rpm. Data analysis was performed by 
using ForteBio Data Analysis software version 9.0.
Binding Competition Assay
Epitope binning between anti-EBOV GP antibodies was deter-
mined using the Octet HTX system equipped with anti-His 
sensors (Pall ForteBio). Experiments were performed at 25°C in 
HBS-EP Octet buffer with the plate shaking at 1000 rpm. Data 
analysis was performed by using ForteBio Data Analysis soft-
ware, version 9.0.
Sequential Binding of REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 to EBOV 
GP.10xhis by Surface Plasmon Resonance-Biacore
The EBOV GP.10xhis was captured onto Biacore amine coupled 
anti-His CM5 sensor surfaces. Next, 50 μg/mL of the first mAb 
was injected for 5 minutes to reach binding saturation followed 
by injection of the second mAb and third mAb under the same 
conditions. The binding sensorgrams were referenced to a flow 
cell with no EBOV GP protein captured. All curves were zeroed 
before each injection, and the relative binding levels were deter-
mined after binding saturation was achieved. This was repeated 
for anti-EBOV GP antibodies and the isotype control antibody 
(REGN1932) at all sequence permutations. The real-time bind-
ing response was monitored during the course of the experi-
ment, and the binding response at the end of every step was 
measured. Data were analyzed using T200 evaluation software, 
version 2.0.
Negative Stain Electron Microscopy
Antibodies were digested using 4% w/w papain for 5 hours. The 
fragment antigen-binding agents (Fab) were purified using a 
Protein A column (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion 
chromatography with an S200 Increase (S200I) column (GE 
Healthcare). The Fabs were added to mucin-like, domain-con-
taining, transmembrane-deleted Ebola GP (EBOV GPΔTM) 
in 10 molar excess and allowed to incubate overnight at 4°C. 
Complexes were subsequently purified using an S200I col-
umn. Ebola GP and Fab complexes were deposited on thin 
carbon-coated, 400-mesh Cu grids and stained with 2% (w/v) 
uranyl formate. Images were collected automatically using 
Leginon [23] with Tietz TemCam-F416 CMOS camera on a 
Tecnai T12 Spirit electron microscope operating at 120 keV. 
The magnification was 52 000 at the specimen plane, and a con-
stant 1.5-micron defocus was applied. Images were processed 
in Appion [24]. Particles were selected using DogPicker [25], 
placed in stacks [26], and sorted into reference-free 2-dimen-
sional (2D) classes averages by multivariate statistical analysis/
multireference alignment [27]. After removing abhorrent par-
ticles, resulting particle substacks were submitted to iterative 
stable alignment and clustering to generate a final set of 2D 
class averages [28]. Individual class averages were used to gen-
erate an initial 3D model using EMAN2 [29], which were then 
refined against raw particles, enforcing C3 symmetry, to general 
the final 3D model. Model images and manipulation were per-
formed in UCSF Chimera [30]. Maps were segmented into Fab 
and core GP components using Segger. All maps were aligned 
to a single GP density generated from the c13C6/c4G7 GPΔTM 
map [31] to generate the 3 Fab models of REGN3470, 3471, and 
3479.

Generation of Pseudotyped Viruses
Retrovirus particles pseudotyped with EBOV GP protein were 
generated by cotransfecting 293T cells with a mix of plasmids 
encoding EBOV GP, psPAX2 encoding virus capside proteins, 
and pCK-retro-luc encoding a packageable firefly luciferase 
reporter gene under control of the retrovirus long terminal 
repeat promoter. Supernatants were harvested 48 hours post-
transfection, clarified using centrifugation, concentrated using 
Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech), aliquoted, and frozen at 
−80°C. Control pseudoparticles were generated by substituting 
the plasmid expressing EBOV GP with a plasmid encoding for 
vesicular stomatitis virus GP (VSV-G).
Neutralization Assays
Pseudoparticle-Based Assay
The EBOV Zaire 2014 virus-like particles were tested in neutral-
ization assays with Huh7 cells. Serial dilutions of antibody (67 
nM–1 pM) were incubated with EBOV GP-pseudotyped virus 
for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) and added to Huh7 cells. 
In brief, Huh7 cells were detached using 0.02 M EDTA, washed, 
and incubated with the antibody/pseudotyped virus mixtures 
for 72 hours. Infection efficiency was quantitated by luciferase 
detection with the BrightGlo luciferase assay (Promega, San 
Luis Obispo, CA), and luminescence (relative luminescence 
units) was quantified in a Victor X3 plate reader (PerkinElmer, 
Waltham, MA).
Virus-Based Assay
REGN3470, REGN3471, REGN3479, and KZ52 antibodies 
were analyzed for the ability to neutralize infectious EBOV in 
Vero cells. Vero cells were plated on 384-well plates in DMEM-
10% FBS and allowed to grow to approximately 75% confluence 
at 37°C. The concentration of each antibody ranged from 25 to 
0.006 µg/mL. Plates were transferred to a biosafety level 4 (BSL-
4) laboratory to complete the infection assay. The EBOV strains 
(Mayinga, Kikwit, Makona, and guinea pig-adapted Mayinga) 
were thawed and diluted. An equivalent volume of infectious 
EBOV was added to wells (multiplicity of infection between 
0.01 and 0.1), and plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. 
After the incubation period, plates were removed from incuba-
tor and inactivated by immersing in 10% neutral-buffered for-
malin, placed in a heat-sealed bag, and stored at 4°C overnight 
in the BSL-4 laboratory. Plates were washed 3 times in 1× phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS), and cells were permeabilized at RT 
with 25 µL 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 15–20 minutes. The 
detergent containing buffer was discarded, and the plates were 
blocked with 3.5% BSA in PBS for 1 hour at RT. Plates were 
treated overnight at 4°C with anti-EBOV GP primary antibody 
(4F3 anti-EBOV GP Antibody; IBT Biosciences) diluted 1:1500 
in PBS. Plates were washed twice in PBS for 10–15 minutes. 
Cells were incubated for 1 hour with Alexa-fluor-488 conju-
gated antimouse secondary antibody. Secondary antibody was 
discarded, and plates were again washed twice in PBS for 10–15 
minutes. Plates were incubated with 25 µL/well of Hoechst dye 
(1:50 000 in 1× PBS) for 30 minutes at RT. Plates were imaged by 
fluorescence microscopy. Images were analyzed by Cell Profiler 
using a HTS pipeline (available upon request). The rate of infec-
tion was determined by dividing the number of infected cells 
with the total number of cells. Infection rates were normalized 
to the average untreated cell infection rate, and normalized 
infection rates (relative infectivity) were expressed as percent-
age of infectivity versus antibody concentration and analyzed 
in GraphPad Prism software by nonlinear regression analy-
sis. Plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) 50 and PRNT 80 
were determined manually from the graph for each antibody 
with a sigmoidal curve that showed 50% and 80% inhibition, 
respectively.
FcγRIIIa Signaling Assay
The potential of each antibody to induce antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was assessed by activation of 
FcγRIIIa-mediated nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) 
signaling in the presence of EBOV GP expressing target cells. 
Each anti-EBOV GP mAb or isotype control antibody was 
incubated with Jurkat effector cells (obtained from ATCC) 
engineered to express NFAT-Luc and FcγRIIIa 176Val (Jurkat/
NFAT-Luc/FcγRIIIa 176Val) in the presence of HEK293 cells 
engineered with tetracycline-inducible EBOV GP expression 
(HEK293/Tet-on/EBOV GP) or, as a negative control, HEK293 
cells engineered with the tetracycline transactivator protein 
alone (HEK293/Tet-on). Jurkat/NFAT-Luc/FcγRIIIa 
176Val 
effector cells and HEK293/Tet-on/EBOV GP or HEK293/
Tet-on target cells were plated at a 1:1 ratio (30 000 cells each) 
in a 96-well plate. To generate a dose-response curve, individual 
anti-EBOV GP mAbs, mAb cocktail, or IgG1 isotype control 
antibody were added to the cells at a concentration range from 
0.78 pM to 40 nM, except for REGN3471, which was evaluated 
at a concentration range of 8.5 pM–500 nM. Plates were incu-
bated at 37°C, 5.0% CO2 for 5.5 hours, followed by equilibration 
at RT for 20 minutes. An equal volume of ONE-Glo luciferase 
substrate was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 
RT for 5 minutes. Relative luminescence units were measured 
on a Victor X5 multilabel plate reader, and the values were ana-
lyzed by a 4-parameter logistic model with an 11-point dose-re-
sponse curve (GraphPad Prism).
Ethics Statement
All animal studies were conducted under the protocols 
approved by the appropriate institutional animal care and use 
committees (IACUCs) (US Army Medical Research Institute of 
Infectious Diseases IACUC committee and Texas Biomedical 
Research Institute [TBRI] IACUC committee). Animal research 
at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious 
Diseases (USAMRIID) was conducted in compliance with the

Federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and exper-
iments involving animals. The TBRI protocols adhere to the 
US Department of Agriculture Animal Welfare regulations, 
the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals, the National Research Council Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the policies estab-
lished by TBRI.
Nonhuman Primate Welfare
Routine feeding occurred and environment enrichment pro-
vided as per established standard operation procedures. Animals 
were singly housed to properly assess signs of disease, and this 
allowed for more accurate determination of food consumption, 
water intake, and fecal and urine output, which are necessary 
in determining morbidity. No analgesics for clinical signs of 
disease were used because the use of analgesics may have a sec-
ondary effect of masking clinical signs of infection that would 
prevent evaluation of disease severity. In addition, other analge-
sics may exacerbate clotting issues. There may also be secondary 
unintended consequences with interactions between the can-
didate drug and the analgesic. Euthanasia criteria was created 
to help minimize the pain and distress the animals experience 
while still allowing time to collect sufficient data to validate the 
treatment regimen. Euthanasia was humanely performed when 
animals met established moribund criteria and was in accord-
ance with approved methods under the American Veterinary 
Medical Association Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. 
The USAMRIID Protocols for housing, feeding, and environ-
mental enrichment and steps to minimize suffering of NHPs 
adhere to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of 
Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2011.
In Vivo Studies
All animal studies were performed in a BSL-4 laboratory at 
TBRI or USAMRIID. Veterinary staff were blinded to treatment 
status of all animals until the end of studies.
Guinea Pig Study (T
exas Biomedical Research Institute)  
For the efficacy study of single antibody treatment, male 
guinea pigs (Hartley strain, 5 to 6 weeks old) were obtained 
from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and ran-
domly assigned to treatment groups with 6 animals per group. 
They were placed in the BSL-4 laboratory 1 week before virus 
challenge and fed and cared for daily. All of the animals were 
challenged intraperitoneally with a target dose of 1000 pfu of 
guinea pig-adapted EBOV (originally provided by Dr. Heinrich 
Feldman, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institutes of 
Health, Hamilton, MT). After 1 day, each group was treated by 
intraperitoneal dosing with 5 mg of antibody per animal or an 
equivalent volume of saline for the placebo control. All animals 
were observed at least twice daily for weight loss and clinical 
signs, and surviving animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after virus 
challenge. Blood samples were collected 4 days after virus chal-
lenge, and sera were isolated and stored at −80oC.
Nonhuman Primate Study (US Army Medical Research 
Institute of Infectious Diseases) 
Research was conducted under an IACUC-approved protocol in 
compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, Public Health Service 
Policy, and other Federal statutes and regulations relating to 
animals and experiments involving animals. The facility where 
this research was conducted is accredited by the Association 
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, 
International and adheres to principles stated in the Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research 
Council, 2011. Research-naive, adult rhesus macaques (Macaca 
mulatta) of Asian origin, mixed male and female, were obtained 
from the USAMRIID colony. Each animal was screened and 
found negative for filovirus antibodies. Macaques were equally 
balanced by sex and weight then randomized and coded for 
blinding. All animals were challenged intramuscularly in the 
caudal thigh with a target dose of 1000 pfu EBOV (Kikwit, 7U). 
Phlebotomies were conducted via saphenous venipuncture on 
the following days: prechallenge, 0; day of challenge, 3, 5, 8, 11, 
14, 21, 28, and terminal. Antibody treatments (50 mg/kg) were 
administered in a single bolus of less than 30 mL over approxi-
mately 60 seconds through a 7F Groshong central venous cath-
eter (Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, UT) or via 21- to 
25-gauge winged infusion needle (Terumo Medical Products, 
Somerset, NJ). At each phlebotomy and/or treatment, animals 
were lightly anesthetized with ketamine (Vedco, St. Joseph, 
MO). Nonhuman primates were observed approximately every 
4–8 hours when showing signs of disease.
Telemetry
Real-time telemetry analysis was performed as detailed previ-
ous [32]. In brief, NHPs were implanted with radio telemetry 
devices (T2J; Konigsberg Instruments, Pasadena, CA) to mon-
itor their temperature and activity throughout the experiment. 
Data were acquired and analyzed via Notocord-hem Evolution 
software (version 4.3.0.43; Notocord Inc., Newark, NJ).
Viral Titration
Challenge doses were determined via plaque assay on the day 
of challenge. Vero E6 cells were plated in 6-well plates the day 
before challenge, and serial dilutions of the challenge material 
were incubated atop the monolayer for 1 hour at 37°C. After 
this incubation, the monolayer was overlain with a 0.5% agarose 
(SeaKem ME Agarose; Lonza, Rockland, ME) solution. After 
1 week at 37°C, the cells were again overlain with neutral red 
and incubated overnight at 37°C. Plaques were counted over a 
light box the following day. This same process was repeated to 
enumerate each animal’s viremia; however, instead of challenge 
material, serum was serially diluted and the plaque assay per-
formed as described above.

Serum Chemistry
Serum separator tubes (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) were 
inverted after each phlebotomy and left to clot for approxi-
mately 30 minutes, at which time they were centrifuged at 1800 
relative centrifugal force (rcf) for 10 minutes at RT. Serum was 
then pipetted into a Piccolo General Chemistry 13 disk and run 
on a Piccolo Point of Care Analyzer (Abaxis, Union City, CA).
Hematology
K3EDTA tubes were inverted by hand and applied to the sam-
pling port of an Advia 120 (Siemens Healthcare, Palvern, PA) to 
achieve complete blood counts. After running the whole blood 
on the Advia 120, the sample was centrifuged at 2500 rcf for 10 
minutes and the plasma was removed from the cell pellet.
Quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction
The EDTA plasma was mixed with TriReagent LS (Sigma-
Aldrich), 100 to 300 µL, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) was performed as described previously [32].
Nonhuman Primate Study (Texas Biomedical Research 
Institute)
Eighteen male rhesus macaques (M mulatta, 3–6 years old) were 
obtained from Covance (Alice, TX), ranging from 4 to 8 kg, and 
randomly assigned to treatment groups. They were placed in the 
BSL-4 laboratory 8 days before virus challenge for acclimation 
and fed and cared for daily. All of the animals were challenged 
intramuscularly with a target dose of 1000 pfu of EBOV Kikwit. 
After 5, 8, and 11 days, each group was treated intravenously 
with 50 or 150 mg/kg of an antibody cocktail or an equivalent 
volume of PBS. All animals were observed at least twice daily 
for weight loss and clinical signs, and surviving animals were 
euthanized 4 weeks after virus challenge. Blood samples were 
collected on day 0, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 21, and 28 days after virus 
challenge. Plasma and serum was prepared for biochemistry 
and viremia analysis and stored at −80oC. For quantification 
of virus loads in animal sera, plaque assays were performed. 
Vero E6 cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates were inocu-
lated with dilutions of animal serum. After 1-hour incubation, 
the supernatant was replaced with Eagle’s minimum essential 
medium containing 0.5% agarose and 2% FBS and incubated at 
37oC. After 1 week, the same media with addition of 2% neutral 
red was added to each well. After additional 1-day incubation at 
37oC, plaques were manually counted.
RESULTS
Isolation of Three Antibodies That Simultaneously Bind to Ebola Virus-
Glycoprotein With High Affinity
Our goal was to rapidly select a cocktail of 3 noncompeting 
EBOV GP-specific fully human mAbs that possess diverse 
biological properties/mechanisms of action. To obtain these, 
VelocImmune mice were immunized with DNA constructs 
encoding the GP protein and/or recombinant purified GP 
protein (Makona strain). To select the best therapeutic antibod-
ies from the pool of GP-specific antibodies obtained from these 
immunized mice, several in vitro screening assays were used to 
identify antibodies that collectively provide the following prop-
erties: (1) blocking entry of EBOV GP-pseudotyped particles 
into susceptible cells, (2) ability to remain bound to GP at endo-
somal pH to prevent interaction with intracellular receptors and 
membrane fusion [33], (3) lack of cross-competition to ensure 
that antibodies simultaneously bind to GP, (4) binding to sGP to 
block its potential role in EBOV pathogenesis, and (5) Fc effector 
function to mediate killing of EBOV-infected cells by immune 
cells, which was previously suggested as important for protec-
tion [16]. To facilitate discovery of antibodies that mediated this 
latter activity, our screening was undertaken with antibodies 
produced in a CHO cell line that had been selected for its abil-
ity to produce antibodies with very low levels of terminal fuco-
sylation (data not shown), because low fucosylation has been 
reported to enhance antibody effector function [34] and con-
tribute to anti-EBOV activity [35]. Using the above screening 
criteria, 3 mAbs (REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479—
all produced in low-fucose cell lines) were selected within 10 
weeks of initiating our immunization campaign.
The selected lead antibodies were stably expressed in EESYR 
CHO cell lines by recombination-mediated cassette exchange 
into the EESYR locus. Genes recombined into the EESYR locus 
are exceptionally stable, and precise recombination is monitored 
by the exchange of fluorescent protein genes in the chromo-
some and the in-coming targeting vector (US Patent 7 771 997). 
Using these cells, isogenic CHO cell banks were established that 
yielded several grams per liter of mAb in single use bioreac-
tors (data not shown). The purified proteins were available for 
in vitro testing approximately 2 months after immunization, 
larger-scale purified lots used for NHP studies were available 
approximately 2 months later, and good manufacturing practices 
(GMP)-quality antibodies that were used for some of the in vivo 
studies and testing for safety in human volunteers were available 
less than 1 year after initiation of the immunization campaign.
REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 bind to EBOV 
GP with high affinity, retain binding at low pH, and do not 
cross-compete. Surface plasma resonance was used to deter-
mine the kinetic binding parameters for the interaction of 
REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 with recombinant, 
histidine-tagged Makona strain EBOV GP ectodomain protein 
(EBOV GP.10xhis) at 25°C and pH 7.4. Each test antibody was 
captured onto the sensor chip surface via its Fc region, followed 
by injection of recombinant EBOV GP. The KD ranged from 3 
to 8.4 nM, reflecting high-affinity binding for each of the 3 anti-
bodies (Table 1). Additional studies examined whether the anti-
bodies retained binding over the normal range of endosomal 
pH (5–7.4). As shown in Table 2, the mAbs displayed a less than 
2-fold (REGN3470 and REGN3471) or 3-fold (REGN3479) 
increase in kd values at pH 5.0, indicating that at this pH, binding

to GP was still tight. In addition, binding to sGP was measured. 
Each antibody was captured onto Octet HQX sensors (Fortebio) 
and immersed in 300 nM solutions of EBOV sGP, EBOV GP, or 
irrelevant negative control ligand. Whereas all 3 mAbs bound 
EBOV GP, only REGN3471 demonstrated specific binding to 
sGP (Table 3), suggesting that it binds within the first 295 amino 
acids of the common region of both GP and sGP.
Two methods were used to demonstrate that the 3 mAbs bind 
to non-overlapping epitopes on EBOV GP. First, cross-compe-
tition between paired mAbs was assessed by using the Octet 
HTX system. After the capture of EBOV GP protein onto Octet 
sensors, the first test antibody was allowed to bind to satura-
tion, followed by exposure to the second test antibody. All 
possible paired combinations of EBOV-specific mAbs and an 
isotype control were tested (Table 4). This assay format showed 
that REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 do not compete 
for binding to EBOV GP. To substantiate whether these anti-
bodies are able to bind the EBOV GP simultaneously, a 3-step 
sequential-binding study was performed using SPR. Saturating 
amounts of each mAb were applied in separate, sequential steps 
over an EBOV GP sensor chip surface, using all permutations 
for the order of antibody addition. Figure 1A shows a sensor-
gram displaying sequential increases in binding signal result-
ing from injection of EBOV GP to the sensor chip, followed 
by the injection of REGN3479, REGN3471, and REGN3470. 
Control experiments demonstrated that repeated injections of 
the same antibody did not result in additional binding signal, 
indicating that the binding sites for each antibody were satu-
rated by the first injection (data not shown). Similar results were 
obtained for all permutations in the order of antibody injections 
(Figure 1B), demonstrating that REGN3470, REGN3471, and 
REGN3479 can bind simultaneously to EBOV GP.
To further define the antibody binding sites, we used sin-
gle-particle, negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) of EBOV 
GP bound to Fabs prepared from each mAb. The images were 
used to create the reconstructions are shown in Figure 1C. 
Consistent with the SPR findings, comparison of these recon-
structions indicates that each antibody binds to a different site 
on the GP molecule. Antibody REGN3471 (Figure 1C, purple) 
has the steepest angle of approach on GP, binding nearly per-
pendicular to the viral surface. The antibody binds within the 
chalice structure at or near the head of GP and may partially 
contact the glycan cap. This placement allows the GP trimer to 
accommodate 3 REGN3471 Fabs, despite the very tight cluster-
ing of the epitope. REGN3470 (Figure 1C, green) binds paral-
lel to the viral surface on the outside of the glycan cap. Finally, 
REGN3479 (Figure 1C, orange) binds at the base of GP, between 
protomers of GP1/GP2.
Functional Characterization of REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 In 
Vitro and in Guinea Pigs
The functional properties of each mAb were characterized by 
determining their in vitro neutralization ability, their in vitro 
capacity to elicit FcγRIIIa signaling in effector cells, and their 
ability to block lethal EBOV disease in guinea pigs.
The ability of REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 to 
neutralize lentiviral particles pseudotyped with Makona strain 
EBOV GP is shown in Figure 2A. REGN3470 and REGN3479 
neutralized pseudovirus particles with half maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) values of 0.27 and 0.17 nM, respectively, 
although neutralization with REGN3470 never exceeded 90%. 
In contrast, REGN3471 displayed weak neutralization (<50%) 
and only at high antibody concentrations. As a cocktail, the 3 
antibodies demonstrated potent neutralization with an IC50 of 
0.39 nM. None of the antibodies blocked the entry of VSV-G-
pseudotyped control particles, indicating that their activity is 
specific for EBOV GP (Figure 2A). In addition, we tested the 
antibodies in a live virus PRNT assay using Makona, Mayinga, 
guinea pig-adapted Mayinga, and Kikwit EBOV strains 
(Table 5). REGN3479 was a potent neutralizer of virus infec-
tivity across all strains tested (PRNT-50 value = 0.1–0.2 nM for 
all strains), whereas REGN3470 and REGN3471 did not display 
significant neutralization in this assay. The difference in neu-
tralizing potency is consistent with other published data show-
ing that pseudotyped viruses are more easily neutralized than

wild-type viruses and probably reflects the lesser amount of GP 
present on pseudovirions [36].
Effector functions of antibodies are recognized as import-
ant in clearance of many virus types by cell-mediated cytotox-
icity. Its importance in clearance of EBOV disease is presently 
unclear, but previous reports indicated that ADCC is elicited by 
an antibody isolated from a human survivor [13], and studies 
have suggested that reduced fucose forms of nonneutralizing 
mAbs are more efficacious in animal models of EBOV infection 
than the same mAbs with normal levels of fucose [16]. The abil-
ity of REGN3470, REGN3471, REGN3479, or a cocktail of the 
3 antibodies to mediate FcγRIIIa signaling in engineered Jurkat 
cells was evaluated in the presence of HEK293 cells expressing 
Makona strain EBOV GP (to mimic infected cell targets) or 
HEK293 parental control cells (Figures 2B). In the presence of 
EBOV GP-expressing cells, REGN3470 and REGN3471 induced 
a dose-dependent activation of FcγRIIIa signaling in effector 
cells with half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values of 
2.9 and 1.6 nM, respectively. The REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail 
(1:1:1 equimolar ratio) also induced FcγRIIIa signaling with an 
EC50 of 1.7 nM. No activation was observed in the presence of 
control cells. These results indicate that binding of REGN3470 
and REGN3471 to EBOV GP-expressing target cells induced 
avidity-driven Fc binding to FcγRIIIa on effector cells, resulting 
in activation of signaling. REGN3479 had no activity, indicating 
that this antibody, although strongly neutralizing, does not acti-
vate FcγRIIIa signaling in engineered Jurkat cells, even though it 
bound to the target cell surface (results not shown).
To determine whether the in vitro properties of each anti-
body translated into in vivo activity, they were evaluated for 
their postexposure therapeutic efficacy against a lethal EBOV 
challenge in the guinea pig model of infection. Guinea pigs 
were chosen because they have been used to predict therapeu-
tic benefit for antibody-cocktails eventually tested in NHPs 
[12]. Groups of 6 animals (approximately 400 grams each) 
were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of guinea pig-
adapted EBOV, followed 24 hours later by a single 5-mg dose 
of antibody or placebo control. Guinea pigs were monitored 
twice daily for 21 days. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each 
cohort and the clinical scores of each animal in each treatment 
group are shown in Figure 2C. All of the guinea pigs in the pla-
cebo group succumbed to EBOV disease by day 7. In contrast, 
postchallenge administration of each antibody was shown to 
delay EBOV disease symptom onset and prevent or delay death 
during the observation period. REGN3479, the most potent 
neutralizer in vitro, displayed the greatest individual efficacy, 
with 66% of treated animals surviving. REGN3471 protected 
approximately 33% of infected animals, whereas, REGN3470 
improved median survival by 4 days, but all animals eventu-
ally succumbed to disease. The clinical scores indicated delayed 
onset of disease signs for all mAb-treated animals compared 
with placebo treatment. In addition, surviving animals in the 
REGN3471- and REGN3479-treated groups displayed limited 
clinical signs of infection. This study shows that in this disease 
model antibodies that only block infection by neutralization 
(REGN3479), only have effector functions via signaling through 
FcγRIIIa (REGN3471), or combine both activities (REGN3470) 
show benefit in vivo when administered as a monotherapy. 
Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that 
each of the 3 mAbs selected has a different binding and func-
tional activity profile that confers protection from disease and 
lethality in an in vivo model of EBOV disease.
Therapeutic Efficacy of the REGN3470-3471-3479 Cocktail in Three 
Nonhuman Primate Studies
The rhesus macaque model of EBOV infection recapitulates 
key features of human disease [37] and was used to demon-
strate the therapeutic potential of REGN3470, REGN3471, 
and REGN3479 in 3 independent studies designed to assess 
the effects of antibody dose and regimen on efficacy. The first 
study showed that 3 postinfection doses of the REGN3470-
3471-3479 cocktail administered 1:1:1 (50 mg/kg total anti-
body) resulted in 100% protection from lethal disease. Rhesus 
macaques were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of the 
Kikwit strain of EBOV by intramuscular injection and were 
randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 (control arm) contained 
6 animals that were each administered an intravenous placebo 
control. Group 2 (treatment arm) contained 9 animals that were 
administered the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail intravenously 
at 50 mg/kg (1:1:1) on days 5, 8, and 11 postinfection. Animals

were monitored daily for signs of EBOV disease. As shown in 
Figure 3A, all 6 placebo-treated animals succumbed to EBOV 
disease by day 9 postinfection. In contrast, despite showing 
disease symptoms on day 5, when treatment began, none of 
the 9 animals that received the antibody cocktail succumbed 
to disease. Clinical scores (Figure 3B) indicated that disease 
symptoms in the treated animals were also abrogated and that 
all treated animals showed no obvious signs of disease before

temperatures recorded by telemetry (Supplemental Figure 1) 
indicated that all animals in the placebo group had sustained 
fever (Supplemental Figure 1A–F, red and purple dots) that 
persisted until succumbing to disease. Likewise, the antibody 
cocktail-treated animals exhibited fever beginning on day 3–4 
postinfection. However, in contrast to the placebo group, the 
fever had ended, for most animals, by day 9, providing an addi-
tional clinical measure indicating that animals were recovering 
4 days after initiation of treatment, before the third dose of the 
cocktail was administered.
To evaluate whether single-dose or 2-dose regimens were 
similarly protective, a second independent postexposure treat-
ment study was performed at a different BSL-4 facility. Eighteen 
rhesus macaques were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu 
of the Kikwit strain of EBOV and divided into 4 groups that 
received placebo control (4 animals), 3 doses of 50 mg/kg of 
the antibody mixture (1:1:1) on days 5, 8, and 11 postinfection 
(4 animals), 2 doses of 50 mg/kg of the antibody mixture on 
days 5 and 8 postinfection (5 animals), or 1 dose of 150 mg/
kg of the antibody mixture on day 5 postvirus challenge.

Animals were monitored daily for mortality and clinical symp-
toms (Figure 4A and B). As in the previous study, all placebo 
control-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease by day 
9. In contrast, treatment resulted in survival of most animals 
in each treatment group, despite the finding that all animals 
showed multiple clinical signs of disease before treatment ini-
tiation (Figure 4B). Only 1 animal succumbed to the infection 
in the 3 × 50 mg/kg and 1 × 150 mg/kg groups, and all animals 
survived in the 2 × 50 mg/kg group. There were no significant 
differences between the treatment arms, indicating that fewer 
doses (and less total administered antibody) or a single admin-
istration of the antibody cocktail provide a similar therapeu-
tic result to what was previously observed with 3 × 50 mg/kg 
doses of cocktail. Similar to what was observed in the first study, 
combined clinical scores of placebo and antibody-treated ani-
mals (Figure 4B) indicated that all animals had advanced dis-
ease that was controlled by the treatment, and the majority of 
these infected animals displayed no symptoms after approxi-
mately day 10 postinfection. Finally, virus load was measured 
in the sera of infected control and treated animals by 2 differ-
ent assays: a plaque assay to detect infectious virus (Figure 4C) 
and quantitative PCR to detect the presence of virus genomes 
(Figure 4D). These viral load studies confirmed that antibody 
treatment (but not placebo treatment) controlled EBOV infec-
tion, reducing virus loads by >106-fold, and showed that the 2 
animals that succumbed to EBOV disease in the treated groups 
displayed viral genome copy numbers higher than the other 
members of their treated cohorts. In addition, these data show 
similar levels of virus load control in all treated animals regard-
less of treatment regimen.
A third study was designed to test a single treatment dose 
(for clinical ease of use in an outbreak setting) and evaluate the 
minimal efficacious dose of the REGN3470-3471-3479 cock-
tail. Forty rhesus macaques were challenged and divided into 
5 groups that received placebo control (4 animals), 150 mg/
kg (9 animals), 100 mg/kg (9 animals), 50 mg/kg (9 animals), 
and 10 mg/kg (9 animals) of the antibody cocktail (1:1:1) on 
day 5 postinfection. As shown in Figure 5A, all 4 placebo con-
trol-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease. As seen in the 
second study, despite clear disease signs being present, admin-
istration of 150 mg/kg antibody cocktail resulted in almost 
complete survival of infected animals (8 of 9 animals). In addi-
tion, a single treatment of 100 mg/kg resulted in a similar high 
survival (8 of 9 animals), and a single treatment of the 50 mg/
kg led to survival of 7 of 9 animals (nonsignificant difference 
compared with higher-dose groups), whereas 10 mg/kg had a 
partial effect, because 5 of 9 succumbed to the infection despite 
treatment. Duration of fever (Figure 5B) and the extent of

temperature increase (Figure 5C) were identical for the 150 mg/kg 
 
and 100 mg/kg groups, indicating that these 2 doses of the cock-
tail had similar effect on controlling fever. In comparison, ani-
mals that received the 50 mg/kg dose were slightly impaired at 
controlling their fever, whereas the 10 mg/kg group displayed 
temperature readings similar to the placebo-treated group, even 
though a significant number of animals survived in this cohort. 
Thus, a single-dose treatment with the REGN3470-3471-3479 
cocktail afforded high-level, dose-dependent, postexposure 
protection against lethal EBOV disease and that 100 mg/kg was 
the lowest dose tested that gave best control of symptoms.
DISCUSSION
The catastrophic outbreak of EBOV in West Africa in 2013–2016 
and the current outbreak in Congo have emphasized the need 
to develop rapid, systematic approaches for development of 
therapeutics for treatment of disease. Multiple classes of EBOV 
disease therapeutics, ranging from small molecule inhibitors 
that act on viral replication to mAbs that recognize viral pro-
teins, have been described [38]. Human mAbs are particularly 
appealing because they display predictable pharmacokinetics 
and tolerability, and their antipathogen activities can be rapidly 
evaluated in vitro based on established mechanisms of action. 
Fully human mAbs with potent antiviral activity can be gen-
erated rapidly and reliably using a platform based on human-
ized mice as demonstrated in the present report and previously 
for development of mAbs to treat infections with Middle East 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [22].
In the work described here, we developed a cocktail of anti-
bodies to (1) combine biological activities and improve efficacy/

outcomes, (2) reduce potential for escape and resistance, and 
(3) increase the potential utility for future outbreaks as virus 
sequences evolve. To this end, we selected candidate mAbs 
based on in vitro antibody properties suggested as predictive 
of in vivo efficacy in previous studies. Both neutralizing and 
nonneutralizing antibodies have previously been suggested to 
be efficacious in guinea pig and NHP models, so assays were 
established to measure neutralization of EBOV pseudotypes, 
as well as assays to evaluate ability to trigger FcγRIIIa signal-
ing, and binding to sGP (which likely plays a role in EBOV 
pathogenesis).
Using this approach, we generated a pool of antibodies to 
EBOV GP and selected 3 leads that had the following activi-
ties: (1) REGN3470 neutralizes EBOV GP pseudotypes, triggers 
FcγRIIIa signaling, but does not bind sGP; (2) REGN3471 has 
no neutralizing activity, triggers high levels of FcγRIIIa signal-
ing, but does bind sGP; and (3) REGN3479 potently neutralizes 
EBOV GP pseudotypes and live EBOV, but does not trigger 
FcγRIIIa signaling or bind sGP. The 3 antibodies were purposely 
chosen to bind distinct epitopes in the GP to hinder develop-
ment of viral resistance. After the rapid screening and selec-
tion of these mAbs, the guinea pig model was used to validate 
them. An antibody with FcγRIIIa signaling but no neutralizing 
activity (REGN3471), a novel single mAb that displayed both 
neutralizing and FcγRIIIa signaling activity (REGN3470), or a 
mAb with high levels of neutralizing activity (REGN3479) can 
delay or prevent death in this model. In this case, the strongly 
neutralizing antibody appeared more protective than the other 
2 antibodies. However, the human Fc may not properly trigger 
guinea pig Fcγ receptors, so it is hard to interpret the contribu-
tion of effector activity in this model.
Analyses performed using single-particle, negative-stain EM 
provided a wealth of information on the binding sites for the 
3 mAbs. These studies revealed that REGN3471 has the steep-
est angle of approach on EBOV GP, binding perpendicular to 
the viral surface at an angle of approximately 90 degrees. The 
EBOV GP trimer was able to accommodate 3 REGN3471 Fabs, 
despite the tight clustering of the epitope within the chalice 
structure of the trimer at or near the head of GP, in an area that 
likely overlaps with the glycan cap. REGN3471 appears to bind 
even closer to the center of the chalice than does mAb c13C6 
(that forms part of the ZMapp cocktail) [31]. Compared with 
mAb114, a neutralizing human mAb obtained from a long-
term human survivor of EBOV disease [39], REGN3471 binds 
further away from the NPC1 Loop C binding site, which may 
explain why this antibody is not neutralizing [39]. REGN3470 
binds the EBOV GP parallel to the viral surface on the outside 
of the glycan cap, a position that could help to explain neutral-
ization and its ability to trigger FcγRIIIa. Finally, REGN3479 
binds at the base of GP, between protomers of GP1/GP2. The 
epitope lies near the internal fusion loop and cathepsin cleavage 
site, similar to the neutralizing antibodies derived from a long-
term survivor, which were recently crystalized [39]. The angle of 
REGN3479 is rotated 90 degrees compared with mAb100, and 
the angle of approach is slightly upward from the viral surface. 
Based on its binding site, the potent neutralization activity of 
REGN3479 may be due to blockade of cathepsin cleavage or 
release of the fusion loop upon receptor binding, similar to the 
mechanism proposed for mAb100 [39].
More importantly, the functional characterization and struc-
tural data also demonstrate that the REGN3470-3471-3479 
cocktail of VelocImmune mAbs reflects the diversity of mAbs 
produced in wild-type mice (such as 13C6, 2G4, 4G7) [40, 41] 
and mAbs obtained from survivors of EBOV disease (such as 
KZ52, mAb114, and mAb100) [39, 42].
To further assess whether REGN3470, REGN3471, and 
REGN3479 are appropriate candidates for treatment of EBOV 
disease in humans, they were evaluated in the rhesus macaque 
model of disease. This work was performed using a clinical

(nonadapted) EBOV isolate that replicates many of the key 
pathophysiological aspects to EBOV infection in man [37]. 
Furthermore, the antibody mixture used was the same lot of 
clinical-grade material that is undergoing human testing (clin-
icaltrials.gov number NCT02777151). Using this model, 3 dif-
ferent studies were performed and confirmed the therapeutic 
benefit of the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail. More impor-
tantly, in postexposure studies where treatment was initiated 
after the appearance of clinical signs of disease, in 2 separate 
studies conducted at 2 different BSL-4 laboratories, 2 doses of 
50 mg/kg and a single infusion of 100 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg of 
REGN3770-3471-3479 prevented death in >88% of the animals.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we used VelocImmune mice to generate a cocktail 
of 3 fully human antibodies to EBOV GP that provide comple-
mentary mechanisms of actions, reflect the diversity of anti-
bodies isolated by conventional methods, incorporate novel 
specificities, and demonstrate high-level postexposure protec-
tion from lethal EBOV disease in NHPs. The entire process of 
antibody generation, selection, preclinical evaluation, and read-
iness for human testing was completed in <1 year, and the cock-
tail is currently being tested in healthy volunteers in preparation 
for future EBOV outbreaks. More importantly, this rapid isola-
tion of fully human mAbs previously reported for MERS-CoV 
[22] and here for EBOV demonstrate the usefulness of a com-
bined platform of technologies, which is currently being applied 
to Zika virus, and it may also be applicable to future emerging 
viral threats.
