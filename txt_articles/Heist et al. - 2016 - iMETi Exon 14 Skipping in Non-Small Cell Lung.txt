ABSTRACT
Background. Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring
specific geneticalterationscanbehighlysensitivetotargeted
therapies.
MaterialsandMethods.Weperformedatargetedrearrange-
ment assay on 54 NSCLCs across all stages that were from
patients who were never smokers and did not have driver
mutations. Because MET exon 14 skipping was the most
frequent alteration found, we surveyed the results for MET
exon 14 skipping at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)
since the inclusion of this alteration into our current
molecular profiling panel.
Results. In a cohort of 54 never-smokers with lung cancers that
were wild-type for known driver mutations, MET exon 14 skipping
wasthemostfrequentlyrecurringalteration,occurringin10cancers
(19%). Clinical testing at MGH via our next-generation sequencing
(NGS) and NGS-rearrangement panels showed an additional 16

with the MET inhibitor crizotinib is also described.
Conclusion. METexon14skippingisatargetablegenealteration
found in NSCLC. Patients with these alterations may respond
well to MET inhibition. The Oncologist 2016;21:481–486
ImplicationsforPractice:METexon14skippingoccurswithanapproximately5%frequencyinNSCLCandisseeninbothsquamous
and adenocarcinoma histology. Patients whose cancers have MET exon 14 skipping can respond well to MET inhibitors. Molecular
testing for MET exon 14 skipping should be performed on all lung cancers because this is a targetable alteration.
INTRODUCTION
The discovery ofoncogenic driver mutations and translocations
hastransformedthetreatmentoflungcancer,andpatientswith
sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK or ROS1 translocations can
have remarkable responses to targeted inhibition, leading to
significantclinicalbenefit[1–8].Theadventofnewtechnologies
has spurred more comprehensive molecular profiling of lung
cancers, and the mutational spectrum of lung cancers, both
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, is becoming
better defined [9–12].
Molecular testing of tumors for genomic changes has been
integrated into the oncology clinic as a part of standard care at
Massachusetts General Hospital since 2009 with the SNaPshot
platform (LifeTechnologies/Applied Biosystem, ThermoFisher
Scientific,Foster,CA,https://www.thermofisher.com),avalidated,
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved, multi-
plexedtumorgenotypingassaythatisusedforreal-timetesting
of tumors. More than 50 commonly mutated loci in 14 key
oncogenes were tested in the original SNaPshot panel, and
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assays forothergenetic
changes of interest, such as ALK and ROS1 translocation, were
performed separately [13, 14]. However, a substantial number
of cancers (∼40%–50%) have no mutations identified by this
platform.
Gene rearrangements and fusions can lead to constitutive
activation of a kinase and are a key mechanism by which some
cancersbecome“oncogeneaddicted.”Theabilitytotargetthese
oncogenic fusions is exemplified by the examples of ALK and
ROS1 rearranged lung cancer. We performed targeted re-
arrangementsequencingusingtherecentlydescribedanchored
multiplexpolymerasechainreactionPCR(AMP)method[15]on
a cohort of 54 never-smokers with lung cancer whose tumors
were known to be wild-type on SNaPshot testing. We
hypothesized that such a cohort would be enriched for driver
genetic alterations. The overall goal was to identify fusion

 Targeted DNA sequencing using intronic primers was then

Harvard Cancer Center.
RESULTS
MET Exon 14 Skipping Is Frequent Among Never-
Smokers With Tumors Wild-Type for Other Drivers
Figure 1 shows the rearrangement events that were found in
this cohort of 54 never-smokers with lung cancers that were
wild-type on SNaPshot testing for known drivers. Specifically,
we excluded patients known to have EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, or
ERBB2 mutations or ALK or ROS1 rearrangements. MET exon
14 skipping was the most frequently recurring alteration,
occurring in 10 patients (19%). MET exon 14 skipping
occurred with both adenocarcinoma and squamous histol-
ogy. One patient had coexisting PI3KCA E545K and CTNNB1
mutations.We confirmed genomic DNA alterations in MET in
9cases; 1casehad no furtheravailable tumornucleic acid. Six
of these had deletions in the 39 splice site of intron 13; the
length of the intronic deletions ranged from 10 to 32 base
pairs.Three had point mutations in the 59 splice site of intron
14 (Table 1).
Rearrangements in RET and NRG1 were also recurring
events in this cohort of patients (Fig. 1). Interestingly, two
patientswhowerethoughttobeALK-negativetestedpositive
for an ALK translocation on the AMP panel; one of these
patients had tested ALK FISH-negative at our institution, and
the other had ALK testing outside, results of which were
negative. One patient who had tested ROS1 negative by FISH
at our institution tested positive for ROS1 rearrangement on
the AMP panel.
Clinical Testing of MET
Clinical testing for MET exon 14 skipping has since been
incorporated into the current standard tumor molecular
profiling at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The
current tumor molecular profiling at MGH uses anchored
multiplex PCR technology [15] to provide targeted NGS for
single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and insertions/deletions of
interest (SNapShot-NGS), as well as rearrangements (NGS-
rearrangement panel). Both tests are ordered on all lung
cancer patients seen at MGH to provide comprehensive
profiling of tumor tissue.
Detection ofMETexon 14skipping has been incorporated
in a phased manner: Since May 2014, the SNaPshot-NGS
panel has provided targeted next-generation DNA sequenc-
ing of specific exons in MET; this allowed us to identify MET
exon 14 skipping events that result from specific SNVs (e.g., a
common point mutation affecting position 1010 that leads to
exon 14 skipping). However, this method does not identify all
thegenomiceventsthatcanlead toexon14skipping,manyof
whichmayoccurinintronicsegments.Therefore,sinceMarch
2015, the NGS-rearrangement panel has been tailored to
identify MET exon 14 skipping events, thus allowing broad
capture of this event regardless of the specific genomic
changethatproducedit.Specifically,theNGS-rearrangement
panelusestargetedRNAsequencingtodetect generearrange-
ments from clinical formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ma-
terial, by using exonic anchor primers in MET exon 15. This
allows detection of MET exon 14 skipping (which always
appears as the same sequence at the RNA level) regardless of
the specific DNA change (which varies from case to case) that
produced it.
Because we perform tumor genomic profiling using both
SNaPshot-NGS and NGS-rearrangement panel on all cases of
non-small cell lung cancer seen in our thoracic oncology clinic,
regardless of smoking status or histology, we are able to
determinethefrequencyoftheMETexon14skippingmutations
in a cohort that is not selected for any specific histology or
smoking status. Among 89 NGS-rearrangement panel cases run
since March 2015, 5 have been identified to have MET exon 14
skipping (∼5.6%). In addition, another 11 cases of MET exon 14

details the additional cases of MET exon 14 skipping that have
been identified at our institution, and Table 3 summarizes
clinical characteristics of all cases. Notably, none of the cancers
with MET exon 14 skipping mutations harbored bona fide
activating mutations in EGFR, KRAS, or BRAF, and they did not
harbor concurrent ALK, ROS1, or RET translocations.
Of note, although MET exon 14 skipping appears enriched
among wild-type never-smokers, we have found this alteration
acrossallsmokinghistoriesandhistologictypes.Indeed,among
the additional cases of MET exon 14 skipping found with the
newer clinical SNaPshot-NGS testing, most former smokers had

DISCUSSION
We report here our experience with MET exon 14 skipping in
NSCLC. We found 10 cases of MET exon 14 skipping among a
group of 54 never-smokers whose cancers were wild-type for
other drivers. Since incorporating MET exon 14 skipping into
ourstandardclinicaltesting,wehavefoundmultipleadditional
cases and estimate a frequency of approximately 5%. Most of
these occurred in the absence of other key driver alterations,
supporting the notion that this is a driver event. MET exon 14
skipping events occurred in both adenocarcinoma and
squamous cell carcinoma histology. Although enriched among
wild-typenever-smokers,METexon14skippingisfoundacross
all smoking histories and histologic types. As noted in other
published reports further described in this section, we saw a
dramatic clinical response in a patient with widespread
metastatic lung squamous cell cancer with MET exon 14
skipping who was treated with crizotinib.
MET exon 14 skipping results from somatic mutations in
the introns of MET; these mutations lead to an alternatively
spliced transcript of MET in which deletion of the juxtamem-
brane domain results in the loss of Cbl E3-ligase binding [16,
17]. The alternatively spliced MET receptor exhibits decreased
ubiquitination and delayed downregulation, leading to pro-
longed activation of MET and MAP kinase, which is thought to
be transforming [16]. Overall, reports of MET exon 14 skipping
have ranged from 1.5% to 6% of NSCLC [10, 11, 16, 18–20], and a
recent report noted 22% of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas
had MET exon 14 skipping [21]. Among 38,028 patients with
advanced cancers who underwent comprehensive genomic
profiling using the Foundation platform (Foundation Medicine,
Cambridge, MA, http://www.foundationmedicine.com), the
highestratesofMETexon14skippingoccurredinlungcancers,
with rates of 3% (131 of 4,402) in lung adenocarcinoma and
2.3% (62 of 2,669) in other lung neoplasms [18]. Eight patients
with lung adenocarcinoma and MET exon 14 skipping were
identified with comprehensive profiling at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center; although a denominator is not
reported, the authors estimate a frequency of 4% [22]. Three
cases of MET exon skipping were identified among 87 lung
adenocarcinomas from Korea [10]. In The Cancer Genome
Atlas, 10 of 230 lung adenocarcinomas had MET exon 14
skipping. In 9 of these, a 59 or 39 splice site mutation or deletion
wasfound;1caseofMETexon14skippingoccurredinthesetting
of METY1003* stopcodon [11]. Across allthe studies,METexon
14 skipping occurred in the absence of other known drivers.
PreclinicaldatahaveshownthatcelllineswithMETexon14
skipping may respond welltoMETinhibition [16,18],although
data are mixed [23, 24]. Kong-Beltran showed prolonged
phosphorylation of MET and MAPK with stimulation by HGF in
a cell line with MET exon 14 skipping, and increased cell
proliferation, which was inhibited by treatment with a MET
inhibitor [16]. Frampton et al. showed that human MET exon
14 skipping and the homologous mouse MET exon 15 skipping
alteration are transforming in cell lines, at least partly through
activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. A mouse model of the

 homologous exon 15 deletion in MET showed sensitivity to
MET inhibition with the oral MET inhibitor INC280 [18].
Interestingly, Liu et al. reported that combined MET and PI3K
inhibition was required for maximal inhibition of a cell line
harboring MET exon 14 skipping and concurrent PI3K E545K
mutation [21].
Clinically, several reports have shown promising signals of
clinical activity among patients with MET exon 14 skipping
treated with MET inhibitors, including crizotinib, cabozantinib,
and INC280 [18, 21, 22, 25–27]. Paik et al. identified eight
patients with MET exon 14 skipping, among whom four were
treatedwithMETinhibitors(threewithcrizotinibandonewith
cabozantinib). These four patients all experienced significant
regression of their tumor burden on the MET inhibitor therapy
[22]. Frampton et al. described one patient who responded to
crizotinib and two patientswho weretreatedinaphase I study
of INC280 who also demonstrated a partial response to
therapy [18]. Liu etal.reported an increased frequencyof MET
exon 14 skippingamong patientswith pulmonary sarcomatoid
carcinoma and noted one case that showed a response to
crizotinib [21]. Other case reports have shown similar marked
responses [25–27]. MET amplification is seen in some, but not
all, of these cases, and the interplay among MET exon 14
skipping, MET amplification, and response to MET inhibitor
therapy remains to be further clarified.
Similartotheseotherreports,thisarticledescribesapatient
newly diagnosed with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
and MET exon 14 skipping with extensive disease, including
bilateral pulmonary tumor thrombi and bony, adrenal, and liver
metastases, with the MET inhibitor crizotinib. A dramatic treat-
ment response was seen at 4 weeks and has been maintained
for at least 6 months. Table 4 shows a summary of the reported
cases in the literature that have shown response to MET therapy.
Reported durations on therapy are preliminary but range from
approximately 3 months to 13 months. Multiple MET inhibitors
are in clinical testing, and studies will be needed to determine
clinical activity in patients with MET exon 14 skipping.
CONCLUSION
We estimate that MET exon 14 skipping occurs at a frequency
of approximately 5.6% in NSCLC. This is a single-institution
experience, and it is possible that referral biases in terms of
who is seen at our institution may skew this percentage;
however, we perform tumor molecular profiling on all
NSCLC cases regardless of any predefined selection criteria,
such as smoking status or histology. Preliminary reports
suggest significant activity of MET inhibitors against these
cancers. Further studies are needed to determine the true
response rate and best targeted therapies for this subset of
lung cancer.
