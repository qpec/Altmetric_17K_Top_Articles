Abstract
Objective—Gallstone disease has been related to cardiovascular risk factors; however, whether 
presence of gallstones predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) is not well established.
Approach and Results—We followed 269,142 participants who were free of cancer and 
cardiovascular disease at baseline from 3 U.S. cohorts: the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS; 112,520 
women; 1980–2010), NHS II (112,919 women; 1989–2011) and the Health Professionals Follow-
up Study (HPFS; 43,703 men; 1986–2010), and documented 21,265 incident CHD cases. After 
adjustment for potential confounders, the hazard ratio for the participants with a history of 
gallstone disease compared with those without was 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–1.21) 
in NHS, 1.33 (1.17–1.51) in NHS II, and 1.11 (1.04–1.20) in HPFS. The associations appeared to 
be stronger in individuals who were not obese, not diabetic, or were normotensive, compared to 
their counterparts. We identified 4 published prospective studies by searching PUBMED and 
EMBASE up to October 2015, coupled with our 3 cohorts, involving 842,553 participants and

INTRODUCTION
Gallstones are crystalline deposits in the gallbladder, principally formed by abnormal bile 
constituents (e.g., cholesterol, phospholipids, and bile salts). Gallstone disease is one of the 
most common and costly gastrointestinal disorders requiring hospitalization in the U.S.,1 
affecting 5–25% adults in the Western world.2 Gallstone disease has been linked to diverse 
cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity,3 diabetes4, 5 and metabolic syndrome.6, 7 In 
addition, patients with gallstones are characterized by distorted secretion of bile acids,8 
which play a key role in regulating gut microbiota composition and activity.9, 10 Gut 
microbiota may influence a range of host functions related to cardiovascular risk,11–13 and 
metabolites produced by gut microbiota such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and L-
carnitine, have been directly linked with cardiovascular risk.11, 13–15
Several previous studies have related a history of gallstone disease to cardiovascular 
risk.16–18 However, some studies had short-term follow-up, did not confirm gallstone cases, 
or did not account for important covariates such as lifestyle and dietary habits. Notably, most 
of the previous studies were not conducted in the U.S population; and data from the US 
cohorts are lacking.
In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between a history of gallstone disease and 
risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in 3 large prospective U.S. cohorts, followed 
for up to 30 years, and accounting for a wide spectrum of traditional risk factors. We 
performed several sensitive analyses to minimize the influence from potential reverse 
causation and confounding. We also conducted a systematic review of previously published 
studies, and meta-analyzed our results with the published data from other prospective 
cohorts.

RESULTS
At cohort-specific baselines, 14,023 participants out of 225,439 (6.2%) women (NHS and 
NHS II) and 1,449 out of 43,703 (3.3%) men (HPFS) reported a history of gallstone disease. 
Table 1 shows the characteristics of participants by cohort and gallstone status at cohort-
specific baselines. Consistently across the 3 cohorts, participants who reported a history of 
gallstone disease were more likely to be older, current smokers, regular aspirin users, to be

 less physically active, to consume less alcohol, to have a higher BMI, and to have a history 
of hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia (Table 1).
Across up to 30 years of follow-up, we confirmed 21,265 incident CHD cases. In general, 
the crude incidence rates of total CHD were nearly double among participants who had 
reported gallstone disease compared with those who had never reported gallstone disease 
(Table 2). There was a significant age-adjusted association between a history of gallstone 
disease and CHD risk in each cohort. After multivariable adjustment, the associations 
between history of gallstones and CHD were largely attenuated but remained significant in 
each cohort: NHS (HR [95%CI]: 1.15 [1.10–1.21]), NHS II (1.33 [1.17–1.51]), and HPFS 
(1.11 [1.04–1.20]). An interim meta-analysis of these 3 cohorts revealed that the results in 
women (NHS and NHS II pooled HR [95%CI] 1.22 [1.06–1.41]) were not different from 
those in men (HPFS alone) (P for heterogeneity=0.23).
When we limited the exposure to a history of cholecystectomy only, its association with total 
CHD risk was similar to when our definition of gallstone disease included both history of 
gallstones and cholecystectomy (data not shown). In secondary analyses of the total CHD 
subgroup definitions (fatal or nonfatal MI, and revascularization), multivariable-adjusted 
analyses of the individual outcomes revealed significant associations between a history of 
gallstone disease and MI in older women from NHS, but not in younger women from NHSII 
or men from HPFS (HR [95%CI] in NHS, 1.14 [1.05–1.22]; in NHS II, 1.15 [0.95–1.40]; 
and in HPFS, 1.08 [0.98–1.19]) (Table 2). Further exploratory analysis showed an attenuated 
and insignificant association (maybe due to a smaller sample size of the cases) between 
gallstone disease and fatal MI only (pooled HR [95%CI], 1.03 [0.93–1.15]). There were 
significant associations between a history of gallstone disease and revascularization in both 
women and men (HR [95%CI] in NHS, 1.20 [1.13–1.26]; in NHS II, 1.35 [1.18–1.56]; and 
in HPFS, 1.14 [1.05–1.24]) (Table 2).
The direct associations between gallstone disease and risk of CHD remained (HR [95% CI] 
for lagged analyses and baseline gallstone disease only, respectively, in NHS, 1.17 [1.12–
1.23] and 1.17 [1.10–1.24]; in NHS II, 1.28 [1.11–1.47] and 1.24 [1.05–1.47]; and in HPFS, 
1.15 [1.06–1.24] and 1.16[1.07–1.25]).
The results did not change materially when we evaluated the associations separately among 
participants not taking lipid-lowering medication (interim 3-cohort meta-analyzed HR 
[95%CI], 1.18 [1.10–1.27]), in those who were not obese (1.19 [1.13–1.24]), in those who 
were non-smokers (1.15 [1.10–1.20]), in those without diabetes (1.16 [1.11–1.21]), or in 
those with normal blood cholesterol levels (1.15 [1.08–1.22]). However, obesity status and 
disease status of diabetes and hypertension significantly modified the association between 
gallstone disease and CHD risk (all P for interaction <0.05, in the interim meta-analyses of 
our 3 cohorts; Figure 1). Participants with a history of gallstone disease who were not obese, 
or did not have diabetes or hypertension, seemed to have a greater increased risk of CHD 
compared to those participants who were obese, did have diabetes, or hypertension. Age, 
smoking, dietary quality, physical activity, or hyperlipidemia did not modify the association 
between history of gallstone disease and CHD. Although the pooled modification effect 
from physical activity is statistically significant, the direction differed across three cohorts.

 Therefore, we did not conclude physical activity modified the association between gallstone 
disease and CHD risk.
Results of Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
We also conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to incorporate the results of our 3 
cohorts with previously published reports from prospective cohort studies. Our search of 
English-language articles resulted in 1,243 citations from PUBMED and 73 from EMBASE, 
with 16 duplicates. We screened the titles and abstracts using general inclusion criteria as 
described in the Detailed Methods (see Supplemental Material). We identified 52 abstracts 
for further full-text review, and eventually included four prospective cohorts for final meta-
analysis. Together with the current study, a total of seven cohort studies were included in our 
meta-analysis. Characteristics of the seven prospective cohorts included in the meta-analysis 
are shown in Supplemental Table 1 (see Supplemental Material). We detected significant 
heterogeneity among these study results (I2=72%, P for homogeneity <0.01), which could be 
from a wide variation in study characteristics, such as study population, follow-up period, 
and measurements of gallstone disease and CHD. However, we were unable to detect the 
sources of heterogeneity because of a relatively small number of studies. Nevertheless, most 
studies showed directionally consistent associations between gallstone disease and CHD 
risk. Based on data from all cohort studies combined, including 842,553 participants and 
51,123 incident cases of CHD, the pooled risk ratio from the random-effects model was 1.23 
(95% CI, 1.15–1.33) for those with gallstone disease compared with those without gallstone 
disease (Figure 2). In meta-analysis, participants from our three internal cohorts with a 
history of gallstone disease had a 17% increased risk of CHD (HR, 1.17 [95%CI, 1.09–
1.26]), while participants from external cohorts with a history of gallstone disease had a 30% 
increased risk of CHD (HR, 1.30 [95%CI, 1.15–1.47]). We also conducted sensitivity 
analyses excluding the only study that presented an odds ratio estimate,16 and the pooled 
risk ratio was 1.23 (95% CI, 1.15–1.33), indicating that the overall results were not 
influenced by this study. Neither visual inspection of the funnel plot (Supplemental Figure 1, 
see Supplemental Material) nor the Egger’s test (P=0.52) suggested publication bias.
DISCUSSION
In our three prospective studies of 269,142 women and men, we found that a history of 
gallstone disease was associated with a 17% increased risk of CHD, independent of 
traditional risk factors. The associations were consistent in both men and women, and 
modified by obesity, and hypertension and diabetes status. Results from the meta-analysis 
incorporating previously published data from four additional prospective cohort studies 
further confirmed our findings.
One of the first reports on the relationship between gallstone disease and incident 
cardiovascular disease was by Bortnichak and colleagues in 1984,16 who found male 
gallstone patients were at an increased risk of incident CHD, while there was no such 
association in women. Significant associations between gallstone disease and CHD risk were 
also observed in cross-sectional studies,19, 20 and other prospective cohort studies in 
Asian21, 22 and German17 populations. The most recent and largest prospective study so far

 emerged from the China Kadoorie Biobank study,22 which involved 199,292 men and 
288,081 women, followed for a median 7.2 years. Authors reported 23% higher risk of 
ischemic heart disease for participants with gallstone disease at baseline, as compared with 
those without the disease, which is an estimated risk consistent with our present results in 
the U.S. cohorts. As to other cardiovascular outcomes, both ultrasound-diagnosed gallstones 
and cholecystectomy were related to a 30% higher risk in overall mortality as well as 49% 
higher risk in cardiovascular mortality in a large U.S. population,23 and participants who had 
gallstone disease had a 28% higher risk in developing ischemic stroke and 33% higher risk 
in hemorrhagic stroke in a nation-wide study in Taiwan.24
Gallstone disease and CHD share many common risk factors, and it has been challenging to 
disentangle these shared risk factors from potentially causally-linked pathogenesis. Both 
diseases share multiple common traditional risk factors, including obesity,3 diabetes,4, 5 
metabolic syndrome,6, 7 hypercholesterolemia,25 hypertension,25 and an unhealthy diet.26 In 
our analyses, the increased risk of incident CHD among gallstone patients was attenuated to 
a large degree but remained significant after we adjusted for these risk factors, and when we 
repeated main analyses among populations free of obesity, diabetes and hypertension, and 
among those with healthier lifestyle and dietary habits after stratifying by these factors. Our 
results were similar when we limited the disease to cholecystectomy, and it might suggest 
that cholecystectomy might not ameliorate the deleterious influence of gallstone diseases on 
CHD risk. Our observed associations were modified by obesity, diabetes, and hypertension 
status, with perhaps counter-intuitively stronger associations observed among the 
presumably healthier subsets of the population, i.e., those without obesity, diabetes, and 
hypertension. In addition, since cholesterol is the main component of most gallstones and 
atherosclerotic plaques, and the use of statins appears to prevent gallstone formation,27 we 
included hypercholesterolemia as a covariate in our statistical models and also conducted 
sensitivity analyses among the participants who had normal blood cholesterol levels, as well 
as among those not taking lipid-lowering medications, and yet the association of gallstone 
disease and CHD risk remained significant. Taken together, these observations may point to 
pathways independent of these important risk factors that link gallstone disease to CHD. 
Further research is warranted to explore potential mechanisms.
The potential mechanisms for the association of gallstone diseases with CHD may, at least, 
include the primary metabolic pathway and the bacterial pathway. Take an example in the 
metabolic pathway, among patients with gallstones, especially those with cholesterol 
gallstones, their bile acid and lecithin secretion rates tend to be depressed and cholesterol 
secretion rates elevated,28 which could indicate enhanced cholesterol synthesis and therefore 
increase CVD risk. In the bacterial pathway, gut microbiota dysbiosis may directly link 
gallstone disease to CHD risk. The presence of gallstones is related to microbiota dysbiosis 
in gut and biliary tract (maybe via biotransformation of secondary bile acids),10, 29 e.g., an 
overgrowth of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria.10 At the same time, gut microbiota 
dysbiosis is found to be linked to a wide range of metabolic disturbances, including an 
increased risk of obesity and CVD.11–13, 28–30 Of note, the bacterial link may be a targeted 
pathway through which diets influence both diseases. For example, circulating TMAO, 
which is a gut flora-generated metabolite of red meat intakes, inhibits bile acid transporters 
in mouse liver and at the same time promotes atherosclerosis.31

 Our results indicate the gallstone patients who were not affected by obesity, diabetes, or 
hypertension had a greater increased CHD risk compared to those who were affected by 
these diseases. The underlying mechanisms remained to be further explored. Patients with 
obesity, diabetes, or hypertension had a higher absolute risk of CHD; therefore, the increased 
risk attributable to gallstone disease might be relative less than those without these diseases. 
In addition, patients with obesity, diabetes and hypertension might modify their lifestyle to 
be healthier after disease diagnosis, and such modifications might also attenuate the relation 
between gallstone and CHD.
Although the present study may not be able to prove a causal relationship between gallstone 
disease and CHD, the long-term implications of gallstone disease on heart health are 
important in clinical practice.30 Patients with gallstone disease should be recommended a 
multidisciplinary program based on a careful assessment of coexisting cardiometabolic risk 
factors. Statins have been shown to dissolve cholesterol gallstones, suggesting their potential 
for a pharmacological therapy for gallstones beyond their well-known benefits on CHD 
prevention.27 However, randomized clinical trials are warrant to test the effect of statins on 
gallstone disease to more clearly address this issue.30
Strengths and limitations
The major strengths of the present study included the large sample size and well-
characterized study populations. Results of the four-year lag sensitivity analysis and analysis 
minimize the possibility of reverse causality. We also incorporated previously published 
prospective cohort studies in a meta-analysis to explore the repeatability and generalizability 
of our results. Nevertheless, our results need to be interpreted in the context of several 
potential limitations. First, the assessment of gallstone disease in our cohorts was self-
reported. However, validation studies in our populations have confirmed that gallstones and 
history of cholecystectomy were reported with high accuracy (99%) according to validation 
of medical records. 32,33 Second, we did not measure in our cohorts insulin resistance or 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which could be important mediators of the reported 
associations. This limited our ability to explore underlying molecular mechanisms or 
pathways. However, our results were similar among participants reporting normal blood 
lipid levels.
Conclusions
In summary, we observed that gallstone disease is significantly and consistently associated 
with an increased risk of incident CHD independent of traditional risk factors in both women 
and men in the U.S. The combined, meta-analyzed observations from our cohorts and 
previous prospective cohorts support our results. Our findings highlight the potentially 
implication of gastrointestinal disorders on prevention of cardiovascular disease.

 Highlights
•
Gallstone disease and cardiovascular disease share a few risk factors; 
however, prospective data in the U.S. regarding the association of 
gallstone disease and cardiovascular risk are limited.
•
In our three prospective studies of 270,067 women and men, we found 
that a history of gallstone disease was associated with an 18% 
increased risk of CHD, independent of traditional risk factors.
•
Results from the meta-analysis incorporating previously published data 
from four additional prospective cohort studies further confirmed our 
findings.
•
Our findings highlight the potentially implication of gastrointestinal 
disorders on prevention of cardiovascular disease.

 Figure 1. 
Associations between history of gallstone disease and coronary heart disease risk stratified 
by age, obesity status, smoking status, diet, and physical activity. Red circles indicate the 
respective stratum with the lower risk values (age <55 years, BMI <30kg/m2, non-smoker, 
and Alternative Healthy Eating Index and physical activity less than the cohort-specific 
median value, with normal blood cholesterol levels, without diabetes, without hypertension). 
Blue circles indicate the respective stratum with the higher (presumably riskier) values (i.e., 
age ≥55 years, BMI ≥30kg/m2, smoker, AHEI and physical activity greater than or equal to 
the cohort-specific median value, with high blood cholesterol levels, with diabetes, with 
hypertension). Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for include age (months);

quintiles). In NHS and NHS II, menopausal status (yes/no), postmenopausal hormone uses (yes/no), and uses of oral contraceptive pills (yes/no) were also considered as covariates.
The number of cases and incidence rates for the secondary outcomes (fatal and nonfatal MI, and revascularization) does not equal the number of cases for the primary outcome (total CHD), because some 
participants experienced both MI and revascularization in the same period. For total CHD, the first of these events is considered the incident event at which follow-up ends.
