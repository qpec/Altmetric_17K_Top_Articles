Introduction
Despite concerted preventive efforts, cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of mortality 
globally.1 Sixty-six percent of these deaths can be attributed 
to atherosclerotic CVD (ischemic heart disease, ischemic 
stroke, and peripheral vascular disease).1,2 As a response to 
the significant burden of CVD, there has been increased 
focus on traditional CVD risk factor identification and risk 
stratification, with the hope of identifying persons that are 
most likely to benefit from prevention therapy.
Subclinical CVD independently predicts CVD events, 
and its absence is associated with minimal CVD risk, even in 
the presence of other traditional risk factors.3–8 Thus, sub-
clinical CVD assessment is often used as an adjunct to tradi-
tional CVD risk stratification. Several non-invasive methods 
of assessing subclinical CVD have been developed, with the 
most popular being the coronary artery calcium (CAC) 
score,9 a marker of coronary atherosclerosis, and carotid

Abstract
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD mortality. However, the relationship 
between ED and subclinical CVD is less clear. We synthesized the available data on the association of ED and measures 
of subclinical CVD. We searched multiple databases for published literature on studies examining the association of ED 
and measures of subclinical CVD across four domains: endothelial dysfunction measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD), 
carotid intima–media thickness (cIMT), coronary artery calcification (CAC), and other measures of vascular function such 
as the ankle–brachial index, toe–brachial index, and pulse wave velocity. We conducted random effects meta-analysis 
and meta-regression on studies that examined an ED relationship with FMD (15 studies; 2025 participants) and cIMT 
(12 studies; 1264 participants). ED was associated with a 2.64 percentage-point reduction in FMD compared to those 
without ED (95% CI: –3.12, –2.15). Persons with ED also had a 0.09-mm (95% CI: 0.06, 0.12) higher cIMT than those 
without ED. In subgroup meta-analyses, the mean age of the study population, study quality, ED assessment questionnaire 
(IIEF-5 or IIEF-15), or the publication date did not significantly affect the relationship between ED and cIMT or between 
ED and FMD. The results for the association of ED and CAC were inconclusive. In conclusion, this study confirms an 
association between ED and subclinical CVD and may shed additional light on the shared mechanisms between ED and 
CVD, underscoring the importance of aggressive CVD risk assessment and management in persons with ED.

intima–media thickness (cIMT), a marker of the arterioscle-
rosis and atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries.10 Markers 
of endothelial function, such as brachial artery flow-medi-
ated dilation (FMD) and the reactive hyperemia index 
(RHI),11,12 as well as other markers of vascular function, are 
also used to assess subclinical CVD in research settings.13 
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common disorder with an 
overall prevalence of around 18% in men aged 20 or more 
years.14 The proportion of ED by cause has not been well 
described in the literature. However, a small series with 69 
participants indicated that a vascular disorder (evaluated by 
penile color Doppler ultrasound) was associated with ED in 
about 34% of non-hypogonadal, non-neuropsychiatric 
patients.15 In multiple studies including systematic reviews, 
ED has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of 
CVD.16–18
ED and subclinical CVD have similar risk factors (age, 
obesity, smoking),19 and it is thought that both conditions 
have shared mechanisms. However, the relationship 
between ED and subclinical CVD is not as clear as that for 
established CVD as the studies examining this association 
are limited by less than ideal sample sizes, and have had 
conflicting results. Particularly, it is unknown which mark-
ers of subclinical CVD have the greatest or most consistent 
association with ED.
Delineating a consistent, strong association of ED with 
subclinical CVD will help in establishing ED as a simple 
and effective marker of underlying subclinical CVD. In 
such an instance, measures of ED could be a simple effec-
tive CVD risk stratification tool, particularly in young men 
who are less likely to undergo aggressive CVD risk assess-
ment and management. This systematic review and meta-
analysis is aimed at examining and synthesizing the current 
evidence describing the relationship between ED and meas-
ures of subclinical CVD with a view to highlighting the 
strength of the associations where possible and to identify 
gaps in knowledge for future research.
Methods
We systematically searched PubMed, Excerpta Medica 
Database (EMBASE), Web of Science, Cumulative Index 
to Nursing, Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the 
Cochrane Library of Trials, and Scopus for published stud-
ies assessing the association of ED and markers of subclini-
cal CVD between 1964 and 2016. As part of our search 
strategy, we divided vascular markers into four domains: 
endothelial function, carotid atherosclerosis, coronary ath-
erosclerosis, and other markers of vascular function (ankle–
brachial index (ABI), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and 
toe–brachial index (TBI)). In addition to ED, search terms 
were generated to represent each domain and include vari-
ations of the following: coronary artery calcification, 
carotid intima–media thickness, flow-mediated dilatation, 
brachial reactivity, reactive hyperemia index, ankle–brachial 
index, toe–brachial index, and pulse wave velocity. We 
excluded studies with non-standardized assessments of ED, 
those whose participants had known CVD, and studies 
without comparison groups for ED. We also excluded case 
reports and case-series, studies without full text and those 
whose full text were not in English. One reviewer con-
ducted the search (BV) and two reviewers assessed studies 
for eligibility (BV and EA). Only studies that were agreed 
upon by both reviewers as meeting the specified eligibility 
criteria were included in the review.
Erectile dysfunction assessment
To be included in the review, the study had to have a stand-
ardized measurement of ED (a validated questionnaire or 
other clinically acceptable measure) and a subclinical 
marker of CVD in at least one of the earlier mentioned 
domains. ED and its severity are most frequently assessed 
using the International Index of Erectile Function question-
naires. The IIEF-15 is a 15-item questionnaire that assesses 
four domains of male sexual function. The IIEF-5 is an 
abridged version of the original 15-item questionnaire. 
Both of these questionnaires are validated, have a high 
degree of sensitivity and specificity for detecting ED, and 
are widely used in research studies.20,21
Description of outcome measures
Endothelial dysfunction is most commonly assessed by 
flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. FMD, 
most often assessed in the brachial artery, is captured by 
ultrasonographic measure of changes in vessel diameter 
over a period of time (often 60 seconds) after deflation of a 
cuff placed around the vessel. These changes are measured 
as percentage difference from baseline.11 The cIMT is 
measured by ultrasound assessment of either the common 
carotid artery or the internal carotid arteries, or both,22 and 
is expressed in millimeters (mm). CAC is measured by a 
computed tomography (CT) scan assessment of the coro-
naries and algorithms are used to determine its standardized 
Agatston score.9 PWV is a measure of arterial stiffness; the 
aortic PWV is more of a measure of central arterial stiffness 
while the brachial–ankle measures peripheral arterial stiff-
ness. ABI and TBI, both measured by Doppler assessment 
of systolic pressures in the lower and upper extremities, are 
often used to determine peripheral artery disease and can be 
used as markers of subclinical CVD in persons who have 
no clinical symptoms of CVD.23
Assessment of study quality
We formally assessed all studies for quality using the 
‘Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and 
Cross-Sectional Studies’ developed by the National 
Institutes of Health and freely available on the Internet.24 
This 14-item scoring tool was developed for longitudinal, 
cross-sectional and case–control studies (Supplementary 
Table 1). Each item was scored ‘1’ for ‘Yes’ or met criteria 
or ‘0’ for ‘No’ or did not meet criteria. For questions 
whose answers could not be deciphered from the pub-
lished study, ‘UA’ (unable to assess) was given, while 
‘N/A’ was given for questions that were not applicable 
(such as questions asking about loss to follow-up in 
 Osondu et al. 
11
studies that are cross-sectional or case–control). Two 
reviewers (CUO and EA) independently assessed quality 
for each study and disagreements on scoring were settled 
by discussion. A numeric score was assigned to each study 
based on the total number of items scored ‘1’. We decided 
that studies with scores of 10 or more were of high quality, 
those with 7–10 were intermediate quality, while those 
with less than 7 were deemed to be of lower quality. A 
summary of the assessment of included studies can be 
found in the Supplementary Table 2.
Meta-analysis
We decided a priori to conduct a meta-analysis if there were 
three or more studies with comparable outcomes. We con-
sidered outcomes comparable if the measures of subclinical 
CVD were the same, had similar categorizations if and 
where applicable, and had similar units of measurements. 
Only FMD and cIMT met these criteria. The data from each 
study included in the meta-analysis were manually extracted 
and copied into an Excel sheet. All statistical analyses were 
performed using the software package R (Version 3.1.1; R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The 
R function metacont and metareg in package meta25 was 
used for the meta-analysis of the continuous outcomes (i.e. 
FMD (measured as percentage change in brachial arterial 
dilation) and cIMT (measured in mm)). Inverse variance 
weighting was used for pooling, absolute mean differences 
(referred to as mean difference from on) were generated and 
the results from random effects models26 are presented with 
their corresponding forest plots. Measures of heterogeneity 
(I2) and between study variance (τ2; tau-squared) are also 
reported. Owing to the presence of significant heterogeneity 
encountered with the meta-analysis, we sought to determine 
the source(s) of this heterogeneity. Therefore, subgroup 
meta-analyses were conducted to assess the influences of 
age, ED assessment type (short vs standard form of the 
IIEF), study publication date and study quality on the results 
of the meta-analysis. We also conducted a sensitivity analy-
sis sequentially excluding the three studies that deviated the 
most from the absolute mean difference (and seen as outliers 
in the forest plot) in each meta-analysis. To assess for the 
risk of publication bias, a funnel plot of the studies was gen-
erated and a formal test of asymmetry, the weighted linear 
regression of the treatment effect on its standard error,27 was 
conducted.
Results
Figure 1 describes the results of the search. A total of 28 
studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Many of 
the included studies measured multiple subclinical CVD 
outcomes. In all, 15 studies examined endothelial dysfunc-
tion as an outcome, with all these measuring FMD and 
 
none measuring RHI.28–42 Twelve studies examined cIMT 
outcomes,28,34,35,38,40,42–48 five studies measured CAC28,29,37,49,50 
 
and six studies had various measures of vascular stiffness 
and peripheral vascular disease such as PWV, Augmentation 
Index (AIx), ABI, and TBI.28,51–55 All the studies with FMD 
(n=15) and cIMT (n=12) outcomes were included in the 
meta-analysis regardless of their quality. None of the other 
outcome measures met our a priori meta-analysis criteria. 
Among the CAC studies, two compared continuous meas-
ures of CAC (mean and median) between ED groups, while

the others were binary but had inconsistent cut-offs for 
abnormal CAC values. Among the other measures of vascu-
lar function, three studies measured ABI: two were continu-
ous outcomes and one was binary. No other measure of 
vascular function was assessed in three or more studies. All 
studies included in this review were either case–control or 
cross-sectional studies; no longitudinal studies met the 
inclusion criteria. The description of the studies, grouped by 
their subclinical CVD outcomes, can be found in Table 1.
Erectile dysfunction and flow-mediated dilation
As shown in Figure 2, the meta-analysis of the association 
between ED and FMD demonstrates a significant relation-
ship between ED and FMD. A total of 15 studies with 2025 
participants examined the relationship between ED and 
FMD.28–42 They all measured brachial FMD; however, the 
methods of FMD assessment were not universal among the 
studies. Seven of the 15 studies had the cuff placed on the 
forearm (including one which described the wrist),28–32,37,39 
while the others either had the cuff inflated over the 
arm36,38,40,42 or did not specify.33–35,41 In addition, the inflat-
ing pressures were inconsistent as studies reported pres-
sures between 250 mmHg and 300 mmHg,28,30–32,38,40,42 
while others had cuff pressures 50 mmHg above the sys-
tolic BP.29,33–36,39 One study had cuff pressures at least 100 
mmHg above the systolic BP.37 Cuff occlusion lasted for 
4–5 minutes in most of the studies and the brachial artery 
diameter was measured at baseline and at 30–90 seconds 
post cuff occlusion in most studies. ED was assessed using 
the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire 
(IIEF-15, five studies) or its short form (IIEF-5, ten 
 
studies). Using a random-effects model (REM), the meta-
analysis of the pooled studies showed that persons with 
ED had FMD 2.6 percentage points less than those without 
ED (mean difference –2.64; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
–3.12, –2.15). There was significant between-study varia-
bility, with an I2 of 97% (Figure 2). In sensitivity analysis, 
sequential exclusion of the three most deviated studies 
resulted in a minimal change in the overall heterogeneity 
(I2 = 97.0%; p-value ≤ 0.001) (Supplementary Table 3). In 
subgroup meta-analyses, the mean difference was signifi-
cantly different in age and study quality groups. However, 
none of the subgroups within any of the groups had a dif-
ferent direction of association, making them unlikely to 
have accounted in entirety for the significant heterogeneity 
between studies (see Table 2). More details on the results 
of the subgroup meta-analyses are shown in Supplementary 
Figures 1–4.
Erectile dysfuntion and carotid intima-media 
thickness
Figure 3 shows a forest plot for the meta-analysis of the 
association between ED and cIMT. Overall, a significant 
association is demonstrated. Twelve studies with 1264 
participants assessed the relationship between ED and 
cIMT.28,34,35,38,40,42–48 Eight of these studies assessed IMT 
in the common carotid arteries,28,34,35,42–44,46,48 one study 
measured IMT at the common carotid, carotid bifurcation 
and the proximal internal carotid artery on each side,43 
while no location was specified in three studies.38,40,45,47 
The methods of assessing ED were also the IIEF-15 
(seven studies) and the IIEF-5 (five studies). Persons with 
ED had significantly greater cIMT (0.09 mm) than those 
without ED (mean difference: 0.09 mm; 95% CI: 0.06 
mm, 0.12 mm). There was also substantial heterogeneity 
between cIMT studies (I2 = 73%). In a subgroup meta-
analysis, neither age, ED questionnaire type, study qual-
ity, nor publication year was a source of heterogeneity, as 
there was statistical similarity in the mean difference 
within these groups. Details of the subgroup meta-analy-
sis results can be seen in Table 2. More details on the 
subgroup meta-analysis are shown in Supplementary 
Figures 5–8. In sensitivity analysis, exclusion of the three 
most influential studies revealed an attenuation of hetero-
geneity among studies that was statistically non-signifi-
cant (I2 = 0%; p-value = 0.75) (Supplementary Table 3). 
The study by Kaiser et al.28 appears to be most responsible 
for the heterogeneity observed in this meta-analysis, as 
exclusion of this study alone resulted in more than a 25% 
drop in I2 (71% to 21%, see Supplementary Table 3).
Erectile dysfunction and coronary artery 
calicification
Five studies examined the association between ED and 
CAC28,29,37,49,50 (Table 3). Two of the five studies showed a 
significant association between ED and CAC.29,49 Both of 
these studies demonstrated greater CAC burden among 
those with ED compared to those without ED. In general, 
all the CAC studies had sample sizes less than 200.
Erectile dysfunction and other measures of 
vascular function
Six studies assessed the relationship between ED and other 
various measures of vascular function (some studies assessed 
vascular function using more than one measure).28,51–55
Among the three studies that examined the relationship 
between ED and ABI, two of them demonstrated no asso-
ciation with ABI, while one study showed that the preva-
lence of ED was two times higher among persons with an 
ABI ≤0.9 than those with an ABI >0.9. Both studies show-
ing no association between ED and ABI were conducted in 
primarily diabetic populations.
Only two studies examined the association between ED 
and TBI, with both studies showing similar results. One of 
these studies determined that ED was significantly associ-
ated with a lower TBI, while the other showed that lower 
scores on the IIEF-5 (increased likelihood of ED) were 
associated with a lower TBI.
Similar to TBI, two studies assessed the association of 
ED and BAPWV, with both studies showing that ED was 
significantly associated with this marker of vascular 
function. However, the only study that assessed the rela-
tionship with AoPWV did not show any significant 
association.

Assessment of publication bias
For the studies included in the meta-analysis (i.e. those assess-
ing the association of ED with FMD and ED with cIMT) we 
assessed the likelihood of publication bias by creating a fun-
nel plot and conducting formal tests of asymmetry 
(Supplementary Figures 9 and 10). In both FMD and cIMT 
studies, linear regression tests of funnel plot asymmetry were 
not statistically significant, indicating a lower likelihood of 
publication or other bias.
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we demon-
strate that ED is associated with subclinical CVD in most, 
but not all studies. The evidence is strongest for the associa-
tion of ED with poor endothelial function (measured by 
FMD) and carotid disease, both of which demonstrated sig-
nificant association in meta-analyses. These relationships 
remained consistent within age, study quality, methods of 
assessing ED, and publication year subgroups. Importantly, 
ED, when identified by a simple five-item questionnaire 
(IIEF-5), shows similar relationships with endothelial dys-
function and carotid atherosclerosis as the longer form of 
the questionnaire (IIEF-15). This underscores the IIEF-5 
utility for identifying persons at risk of subclinical CVD. 
Although age accounted for some heterogeneity between 
FMD studies, participants in all age groups demonstrated a 
significant association of ED with subclinical CVD. This is 
particularly important in younger men who are less likely 
to be screened for subclinical CVD and who may be pre-
senting to a provider for the first time with symptoms 
related to ED. Our study findings indicate that such men are 
at greater risk of having identifiable subclinical CVD and 
will benefit from an active CVD work-up.
Coronary artery calcium, an assessment that is most pre-
dictive of coronary artery disease, had varying results as 
only two of the five studies showed an association with ED. 
Most of the CAC studies had small sample sizes (most 
studies had less than 200 participants), which may limit a 
study’s ability to detect small differences between groups 
and may account for the lack of association seen. Thus, 
there is inconclusive evidence to either prove or refute an 
association between ED and CAC, and larger studies are 
needed.
Among the measures of vascular stiffness, ABI had 
conflicting associations with ED, while ED was consist-
ently associated with lower TBI and increased BAPWV. 
We note that both studies with no significant associations 
of ED with ABI were conducted among primarily diabetic 
participants. Previous studies among diabetic individuals 
have shown that ABI is a poor marker of cardiovascular 
disease mortality and that TBI has a better predictive 
value.56,57 Thus, among the non-ABI studies, ED appears 
to identify peripheral vascular stiffness (irrespective of 
diabetic status) as all the studies showed a significant rela-
tionship with markers of peripheral vascular function. In 
addition, all three studies in non-diabetic populations 
showed a significant association between ED and periph-
eral vascular function.51–53 Summed together, our findings 
suggest that ED is associated with peripheral vascular dis-
ease and that non-ABI measures may be important tools in 
the assessment of persons with diabetes and ED. We would 
also emphasize that ABI has been demonstrated to be a 
poor measure of vascular stiffness in diabetic partici-
pants.56–58 More studies are required on the measures of 
central arterial function, as we found only one study that 
measured the AoPWV.28
It is thought that endothelial dysfunction, an early marker 
of atherosclerosis, is also one of the earliest abnormalities

endothelial dysfunction may benefit from aggressive CVD 
preventive management, even if there are no other obvious 
CVD risk factors (as may be seen in young persons with 
ED). On the other hand, ED also identifies markers of 
advanced subclinical vascular disease such as ABI and TBI,

especially among men without diabetes. This is particularly 
significant as men without diabetes are probably less likely 
to be assessed for peripheral artery disease, especially if they 
are asymptomatic like those in the studies. Considering the 
significant morbidity and mortality burden associated with 
peripheral vascular disease,59 our results suggest that ED 
may be a marker of subclinical CVD and atherosclerosis, 
even in patients without an overt diagnosis of peripheral vas-
cular disease. ED may be used to identify patients who may 
benefit from early screening for vascular dysfunction.
Both ED and increased cIMT are predictive of stroke.60,61 
Thus, our findings in which there is increased cIMT in per-
sons with ED support earlier findings from prospective 
studies on ED and stroke, and suggest that cIMT assess-
ment in persons with ED may improve stroke risk 
stratification.
ED and CVD are thought to share common mecha-
nisms. Both disorders are associated with increasing age, 
alcohol use, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and sedentary 
lifestyle.19 These risk factors are strongly associated with 
conditions contributing to poor vascular flow, such as 
endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Our finding, 
in which there is a consistent association of ED with three 
of the four domains of subclinical CVD we assessed 
(endothelial dysfunction, carotid atherosclerosis, and 
other markers of vascular function), further supports the 
theory of shared mechanisms between ED and CVD. 
However, longitudinal relationships would need to be 
assessed to further define the pathogenetic role athero-
sclerosis plays in ED.
Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of CVD 
risk reduction (through lifestyle changes and/or statins) in 
improving ED; however, the benefits of CVD risk reduc-
tion on ED improvement are still not widely publicized, 
especially to men who are less likely to participate in life-
style improvement programs.62–64 Our study supports a 
more aggressive CVD risk assessment and management 
of persons with ED, including among young men who 
may otherwise have been categorized as low risk due to 
their young ages. The measures of subclinical disease 
included in this review (with the exception of CAC) can 
be assessed by non-invasive office-based procedures with 
no radiation risk and whose results can be available dur-
ing a clinic visit. Such easy-to-conduct tests coupled with 
the ability to identify ED through the use of a short ques-
tionnaire (IIEF-5) make ED identification and subsequent 
assessment of subclinical CVD feasible in a primary care 
office setting.
Limitations
One of the weaknesses of our review is that all the studies 
in this review are either cross-sectional or case–control in 
design. This is reflected in the relatively low scores in qual-
ity that the studies in this review received. As such, we are 
unable to assess the temporal relationship between ED and 
subclinical CVD. Additionally, we are unable to control for 
many covariates such as hormone levels, diet (which may 
affect hormone levels), disorders resulting in cavernosal 
fibrosis, kidney function, depression status or medication 
use, which were not adjusted for or reported in most of the 
studies. These conditions also cause ED and are not neces-
sarily vascular and may serve as potential confounders. The 
absence of patient-level data on participants who are on 
optimal guideline-directed CVD therapy makes it impossi-
ble to account for the effect of prevention interventions on 
the relationship between ED and CVD. Other weaknesses 
include a significant heterogeneity of values within the 
studies in the meta-analysis. Sensitivity analysis excluding 
the most outlier studies did not significantly change statisti-
cal heterogeneity among the FMD studies. However, 
among the cIMT studies, this analysis showed a decline of 
the I2 to 0 without a significant change in the absolute mean 
difference. We could not determine the source of this het-
erogeneity, even after conducting subgroup analysis. 
Reasons for this may be the very diverse populations 
included across the studies, some assessments being opera-
tor dependent (such as FMD), or differences in how cardio-
vascular disease risk assessments are organized and 
reported. Age and study quality only contributed partly to 
the heterogeneity between studies, as demonstrated in our 
subgroup meta-analyses. We were unable to account for 
intra-study differences in age as the subgroup analyses only 
accounted for age differences across (but not within) stud-
ies. Other unaddressed sources of heterogeneity include 
the inter-operator (and possibly intra-operator) differences 
that were likely to have occurred in these studies. This may 
be more prominent for the brachial artery FMD measure-
ment, which is heavily user dependent and which did not 
have a uniform standard of measurement (as noted in the 
Methods section). Unfortunately, we are unable to assess 
or account for these differences in our meta-analyses. Our 
assessment of funnel plot asymmetry suggests an increased 
likelihood of publication bias among the FMD and cIMT 
studies.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates an association between ED and 
measures of subclinical CVD, shedding more light on the 
relationship between ED and CVD, and suggests that ED 
may be useful in CVD risk stratification. Future research 
should focus on determining the longitudinal relationship 
between ED and subclinical CVD and should involve larger 
sample sizes. As coronary artery calcification testing 
becomes more common, larger studies on its relationship 
with ED should also be conducted.
