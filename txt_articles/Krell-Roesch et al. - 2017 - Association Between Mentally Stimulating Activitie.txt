Abstract
Importance—We and others have reported cross-sectional associations between mentally 
stimulating activities and decreased odds of having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or 
Alzheimer’s disease. However, little is known about the longitudinal outcome of incident MCI as 
predicted by late life (age ≥70 years) mentally stimulating activities.

 Objective—To test our hypothesis on the association between mentally stimulating activities in 
late life and the risk of incident MCI and additionally evaluate the impact of APOE ε4 genotype.
Design—Prospective cohort study.
Setting—Population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota.
Participants—We followed 1929 participants aged ≥ 70 years who were cognitively normal at 
baseline to the outcome of incident MCI.
Main Outcome and Measures—At baseline, participants provided information about mentally 
stimulating activities within a year prior to enrolment into the study. Neurocognitive assessment 
was conducted at baseline and 15 month interval evaluations. Cognitive diagnosis was made by an 
expert consensus panel based on published criteria. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI) using Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for age, sex 
and education.
Results—Over a median follow-up period of 4 years, we observed that playing games (HR [95% 
CI], 0.78 [0.65–0.95]), and engaging in craft activities (0.72 [0.57–0.90]), computer use (0.70 
[0.57–0.85]), and social activities (0.77 [0.63–0.94]) were associated with a decreased risk of 
incident MCI. In a stratified analysis by APOE ε4 status, the data points towards the lowest risk of 
incident MCI for APOE ε4 non-carriers who engage in mentally stimulating activities and towards 
the highest risk of incident MCI for APOE ε4 carriers who do not engage in mentally stimulating 
activities.
Conclusion and Relevance—Cognitively normal elderly individuals who engage in specific 
mentally stimulating activities, even in late life, have a decreased risk of incident MCI. The 
associations may vary by APOE ε4 carrier status.
Dementia has become a global epidemic causing significant burden not only for societies but 
also for caregivers and patient families1. Therefore, it is critical to examine potential 
protective, lifestyle-related factors against cognitive decline and dementia, preferably based 
on cohort studies involving large sample sizes.
Various terms have been used to describe activities that keep the mind active and may 
contribute to healthy aging. Indeed, cognitive, intellectual or mentally stimulating activities 
are associated with a decreased risk of cognitive decline2 and dementia3–10. To date, only 
few studies investigated whether cognitive activities are related to the outcome of mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) which is the intermediate zone between normal cognitive aging 
and dementia11. Our group has reported a cross-sectional association between mentally 
stimulating activities and decreased odds of having mild cognitive impairment (MCI)12. A 
cohort study involving a convenience sample of community-dwelling elderly found an 
association between cognitive activities and a decreased risk of amnestic MCI13 as well as 
vascular cognitive impairment14.
In the current population-based cohort study, we sought to determine whether engaging in 
mentally stimulating activities in late life could be of potential benefit in reducing the risk of 
incident MCI in persons aged 70 years and above. We have made rigorous efforts to ensure 
that our study participants were cognitively normal at baseline and we also had a well-

 established research infrastructure to follow the cohort forward in time to the outcomes of 
incident MCI. Such an undertaking minimizes the potential for reverse causality though 
theoretically it may not completely eliminate it. We hypothesize that elderly persons who 
report engaging in mentally stimulating activities at least 1–2 times per week have a 
significantly decreased risk of developing new onset of MCI as compared to persons that 
report less mentally stimulating activities. Since Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 is a well-
known risk factor for MCI and dementia15–18, we also conducted a stratified analysis by 
APOE genotype. We hypothesize that 1) APOE ε4 carriers have a higher risk of developing 
incident MCI as compared to APOE ε4 non-carriers regardless of engaging in mentally 
stimulating activities; 2) APOE ε4 carriers who report engaging in mentally stimulating 
activities have a decreased risk of developing incident MCI as compared to APOE ε4 
carriers who do not report engaging in mentally stimulating activities.
METHODS
Design and Setting
We conducted a prospective cohort study derived from the population-based Mayo Clinic 
Study of Aging (MCSA). The MCSA is an ongoing study of normal cognitive aging and 
MCI among elderly persons aged 70 years and older. The details of the MCSA study have 
been reported elsewhere19. Briefly, from the target population of 9953 elderly individuals 
residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, on October 1, 2004, we recruited study participants 
by stratified random sampling20. The MCSA study protocols have been approved by the 
institutional review boards of the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center in Rochester, 
Minnesota. All participants provided written informed consent.
Study Sample
We assembled a cohort of 2213 cognitively normal participants who had completed a 
questionnaire on engaging in mentally stimulating activities as well as a valid cognitive 
assessment at baseline. 284 individuals were excluded (242 withdrew prior to follow-up, 3 
had no follow-up visit, and 39 died prior to follow-up). Therefore, the final cohort consisted 
of 1929 cognitively normal persons who were followed to the outcome of incident MCI.
Assessment of Mentally Stimulating Activities
Details of the measurement of mentally stimulating activities in the MCSA have been 
reported elsewhere12,21. Briefly, we modified previously validated instruments to measure 
these activities8,22,23. We defined the following activities as exposures of interest based on 
results from our cross-sectional study12: Reading books, craft activities, computer activities, 
playing games, and social activities (e.g., going out to movies and theaters). A research 
nurse or psychometrist assessed the frequency at which each participant engaged in each 
mentally stimulating activity by using a structured survey with ordinal responses (once a 
month or less, 2–3 times a month, 1–2 times per week, 3–4 times per week, 5–6 times per 
week, and daily). Participants were asked to provide information about engagement in these 
activities in the year prior to study participation (late life mentally stimulating activities).

 Cognitive Evaluation
The cognitive assessment in the MCSA was described in detail elsewhere12,19 and is briefly 
described here. A face-to-face evaluation was completed among all study participants and 
included three assessment components: (1) a neurological evaluation which included a 
neurological history review, the administration of the Short Test of Mental Status24, and a 
neurological examination; (2) a risk factor assessment interview which was conducted by a 
nurse or study coordinator and included the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR); and (3) 
neuropsychological testing which was administered by a psychometrist to assess 
performance in 4 cognitive domains: Memory (delayed recall trials from the Auditory Verbal 
Learning Test25 and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised26, Logical Memory and Visual 
Reproduction subtests); Language (Boston Naming Test27,28 and category fluency29); 
Visuospatial Skills (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised30, Picture Completion and 
Block Design subtests); and Executive Functions (Trail Making Test B31 and Wechsler 
Adult Intelligent Scale-Revised30, Digit Symbol Substitution subtest).
An expert consensus panel made the classifications of normal cognition and MCI after 
reviewing the results acquired from the clinical and neuropsychological evaluation19. 
Individuals were considered as cognitively normal at baseline according to published 
normative data developed on this community32–35. For MCI, the following revised Mayo 
Clinic criteria for MCI36,37 were used: (1) cognitive concern expressed by a physician, 
informant, participant, or nurse; (2) impairment in 1 or more cognitive domains (executive 
functions, memory, language, or visuospatial skills); (3) essentially normal functional 
activities; and (4) absence of dementia. Participants with MCI had a CDR score of 0 or 0.5; 
however, the final diagnosis of MCI was based on all available data.
APOE Genotyping
Blood was drawn from the study participants after receiving informed consent. DNA was 
amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction, and APOE genotyping was determined by 
standard methods38. The genotypes were determined by laboratory technicians who were 
kept unaware of clinical characteristics.
Statistical Analysis
To investigate the association between late life mentally stimulating activities and the 
outcome of incident MCI, we calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals 
(95% CI) by using Cox proportional hazards models with age as a time scale and after 
adjusting for sex, education, medical comorbidity (weighted Charlson index)39, depression 
(Beck Depression Inventory score <13 vs ≥13)40, and APOE genotype status.
Our hypotheses were generated from our previous cross-sectional study. Thus, the analyses 
were conducted separately for five different types of mentally stimulating activities in late 
life (within 1 year of the cognitive assessment): reading books, craft activities, computer 
activities, playing games, and social activities (e.g., going out to movies and theaters). In our 
analyses, we compared mentally stimulating activities carried out at least 1–2 times per 
week vs. mentally stimulating activities carried out 2–3 times a month or less (reference 
group) in predicting the risk of incident MCI. We measured central tendency using medians

 and associated interquartile ranges. Furthermore, we conducted analyses stratified by MCI 
subtype (amnestic vs. non-amnestic) as well as APOE ε4 status to investigate possible 
interactions between this genetic risk factor for AD and mentally stimulating activities in 
late life. Fitting all the data, we also tested for multiplicative interactions on the hazard ratio 
scale as well as for additive interactions. Statistical testing was performed at the 
conventional 2-tailed alpha level of 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS® System, 
version 9.3 software (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
At baseline, we included 1929 cognitively normal persons aged 70 years and older (50.4% 
females) who had completed a valid mentally stimulating activities assessment and cognitive 
evaluation. We followed this cohort forward in time for a median of 4.0 years (interquartile 
range [IQR], 2.3–6.4 years), at which time 456 participants developed new onset MCI 
(Figure 1). The median age at baseline was 77 years (IQR, 74–82 years) and the median 
level of education was 14 years (IQR, 12–16 years). 512 participants (26.7%) were APOE 
ε4 carriers. APOE genotype data were missing for 9 participants. The detailed demographic 
characteristics are displayed in Table 1.
After adjusting for age, sex, and years of education, we observed that playing games (HR 
[95% CI], 0.78 [0.65 to 0.95]), engaging in craft activities (HR [95% CI], 0.72 [0.57 to 
0.90]), computer activities (HR [95% CI], 0.70 [0.57 to 0.85]), and social activities (HR 
[95% CI], 0.77 [0.63 to 0.94]) were associated with a decreased risk of incident MCI. The 
association between reading books (HR [95% CI], 0.83 [0.68 to 1.01]) and a decreased risk 
of incident MCI was marginally significant. Additional adjustment for medical comorbidity, 
depression and APOE genotype did not significantly alter the results (Model 2). Please refer 
to Table 2 for a summary of results.
We also conducted stratified analyses by MCI subtype (amnestic vs. non-amnestic). We 
observed significant associations between craft activities (HR [95% CI], 0.76 [0.58 to 1.00]), 
computer activities (HR [95% CI], 0.75 [0.59 to 0.95]), social activities (HR [95% CI], 0.75 
[0.58 to 0.95]) and a decreased risk of incident amnestic MCI; whereas, we only observed a 
significant association between computer activities (HR [95% CI], 0.42 [0.26 to 0.67]) and a 
decreased risk of incident non-amnestic MCI. The results of this analysis are summarized in 
eTable 1.
We conducted the same analyses stratified by APOE ε4 status. We observed that among 
APOE ε4 non-carriers, craft activities (HR [95% CI], 0.65 [0.49 to 0.85]), and computer 
activities (HR [95% CI], 0.73 [0.58 to 0.93]) were significantly associated with a decreased 
risk of incident MCI and the associations were marginally significant for reading books (HR 
[95% CI], 0.81 [0.64 to 1.02] and playing games (HR [95% CI], 0.81 [0.64 to 1.02]. Among 
APOE ε4 carriers, only computer activities (HR [95% CI], 0.65 [0.46 to 0.92]) and social 
activities (HR [95% CI], 0.62 [0.43 to 0.89]) were associated with a decreased risk of 
incident MCI (Table 3).

 We also examined a possible interaction between late life mentally stimulating activities and 
APOE genotype in predicting the risk of incident MCI. We defined the reference group as 
participants who did not engage in late life mentally stimulating activities and were also 
APOE ε4 non-carriers. We consistently observed the lowest risk of incident MCI in 
participants who engaged in any type of mentally stimulating activity and were APOE non-
carriers as compared with the reference group. In contrast, participants who were APOE ε4 
carriers and did not engage in mentally stimulating activities tended to have the highest risk 
for incident MCI with the exception of engaging in craft activities. None of the tests for 
additive interactions between late life mentally stimulating activities and APOE genotype on 
the risk of new-onset MCI were significant. However, the model on additive interaction was 
marginally significant for social activities (p = 0.088). Additional adjustment for medical 
comorbidity and depression did not alter the results. Please refer to eTable 2 for a summary 
of results and to Figure 2 for visual display of data (HR plot).
DISCUSSION
In this population-based, prospective cohort study, we observed that engaging in mentally 
stimulating activities in late life was associated with a decreased risk of incident MCI. More 
specifically, playing games, engaging in craft, computer, and social activities significantly 
reduced the risk of incident MCI. In the past, we have reported decreased odds of MCI for 
engagement in mentally stimulating activities in late life in a population-based, case-control 
study12. However, we considered those findings as preliminary until confirmed by a 
prospective cohort study, which we are now reporting.
When comparing MCI subtypes (amnestic vs. non-amnestic MCI), we observed more 
associations between mentally stimulating activities and a decreased risk of amnestic MCI as 
compared to non-amnestic MCI. This could be explained by a limited power due to smaller 
sample size for the analysis on non-amnestic MCI.
As APOE ε4 is a well-known risk factor for MCI and AD15–18, we also conducted stratified 
analyses by APOE ε4 status in predicting the outcome of incident MCI. As expected, the 
data points towards a reduced risk of incident MCI for APOE ε4 non-carriers who engage in 
mentally stimulating activities. However, we observed fewer associations between mentally 
stimulating activities and a decreased risk of incident MCI for APOE ε4 carriers as 
compared to non-carriers. This finding may in part be explained by a lower sample size of 
APOE ε4 carriers which limits the statistical power of this analysis.
Our study is in line with previous research that reported a potentially protective effect of 
mentally stimulating activities on cognitive decline2, dementia3–10 and MCI13,21. 
Additionally, a recent study involving persons aged 85 years and older reported a list of risk 
and protective factors for advanced aging, one of which was an association between 
cognitive activities and a decreased risk of MCI21. To our knowledge, our study might be 
one of the few if not the first population-based cohort study to examine the risk of incident 
MCI in persons 70 years and older as predicted by engagement in mentally stimulating 
activities in late life.

 Our study could not disentangle why some mentally stimulating activities (e.g., computer 
activities) had a larger effect size on the decreased risk of incident MCI than other activities 
(e.g., reading books). However, we can speculate the following. Perhaps, a particular mental 
activity, for example, the use of a computer requires specific technical and manual skills and 
that these could be the factors that might be associated with a decreased risk of cognitive 
decline. Future studies may need to examine the specific mediation factors between a 
particular mentally stimulating activity and the decreased risk of incident MCI.
However, we did not investigate possible mechanisms that might underlie the association 
between engagement in mentally stimulating activities and the risk of incident MCI. Insights 
on these mechanisms can be derived from animal studies. Studies involving mouse models 
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) showed a protective effect of enriched environments on 
neuropathological changes associated with AD such as prevention of neuronal dysfunction 
and increased synaptic recovery41. So far, only few studies investigated the associations 
between mental or cognitive activities and pathological changes associated with cognitive 
decline and AD in humans. For example, researchers from UC Berkley reported a significant 
association between cognitive activities and a decreased beta amyloid deposition in the 
cortex42. An Australian group reported that complex mental activity across the lifespan was 
associated with decreased hippocampal atrophy43. A recent report indicated that higher 
cognitive reserve was associated with decreased age-related changes in CSF biomarkers44. 
Additionally, one can hypothesize that engagement in mentally stimulating activities may 
also be associated with other protective lifestyle factors such as engagement in physical 
exercise. These activities might in sum lead to a decreased risk of cognitive decline12. Also, 
the cognitive reserve theory states that engagement in mentally stimulating activities or a 
high educational level may buffer the negative effects of abnormal brain pathologies on 
cognitive function45. The reader is referred to our previous manuscript12 for a discussion of 
potential mechanisms of action.
In addition to mentally stimulating activities, several other risk and protective factors for 
MCI have been discussed in the literature. There is evidence that neuropsychiatric 
symptoms46,47 are associated with an increased risk of incident MCI. In contrast, lifestyle-
related factors such as physical exercise48 and low caloric intake49 are associated with a 
lower risk of MCI.
The findings of our study should be interpreted within the context of its strengths and 
limitations. The major strength of our study pertains to its design. We conducted a 
population-based, prospective cohort study with a large sample size of 1929 participants at 
baseline that we followed over several years. In addition, MCI was assessed using face-to-
face evaluations and based on a consensus panel at a center that has a well-known reputation 
in the field. A limitation pertains to potential recall bias that stems from the self-reported 
mentally stimulating activities questionnaire. Also, we did not control for mentally 
stimulating activities carried out in early or midlife. We can assume that individuals who 
engaged in mentally stimulating activities in early and/or midlife are more likely to engage 
in these activities in late life as compared to persons who did not engage in these activities 
during the lifespan. Furthermore, an observational study like ours only allows investigating 
associations and does not allow drawing conclusions about cause and effect. This can only

 be done by interventional (experimental) studies. Therefore, we cannot exclude a ‘reverse 
causality’ explanation, i.e. it is possible that participants who are at higher risk for MCI are 
less likely to engage in mentally stimulating activities. However, given that we conducted a 
rigorous, time intensive, large scale population-based prospective cohort study, and 
considering similar findings from smaller studies in the past, we can conclude that the 
observed associations in our study are real. In addition, it should be noted that the majority 
of the population in Olmsted County, Minnesota is of Caucasian descent. However, it has 
been indicated that the data is generalizable to the population of the United States50.
In conclusion, we observed that engaging in mentally stimulating activities, even in late life, 
may be protective against new onset MCI. Additionally, engaging in certain mentally 
stimulating activities may lower the risk of incident MCI even among APOE ε4 carriers. 
Future research is needed to understand the mechanisms linking mentally stimulating 
activities and cognition in late life.
