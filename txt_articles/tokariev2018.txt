Abstract
Preterm birth is the greatest risk factor for lifelong neurocognitive deficits, globally. The effect of prematurity on early
cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows
reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of
cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age
in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity
organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control
infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that
were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of
prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was
correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that
correlates with neurological performance in human infant.

Introduction
Large-scale correlations are ubiquitous in spontaneous brain
activity. They relate to behavioral states and are believed to
mechanistically support dynamic regulation of neuronal infor-
mation processing and network communication in a wide
range of brain functions (Bressler and Menon 2010; Palva and
Palva 2011; Hipp et al. 2012).
Preterm birth affects about 10% of newborns, globally, and is
considered the most important risk factor for compromised
neurocognitive development (WHO 2012; Johnson and Marlow
2017). The neurocognitive sequelae of preterm birth include a
wide range of brain functions, such as disorders of attention,
visual cognition, or language development. Recent anatomical
studies on children exposed to prematurity reveal widespread
disruptions in white matter connectivity networks (Batalle
et al. 2017) and decreased gray matter volumes (Guo et al.
2017). These findings reinforce the idea that neurocognitive
sequelae of prematurity are mediated by widely distributed
white matter lesions that conceivably affect early neuronal net-
work
communication,
which
could
lead
to
compromised
activity-dependent brain development (Luhmann et al. 2016).
It is well established in experimental animal model studies
that early neuronal networks develop via activity-dependent
mechanisms and that disruptions in network activity influence
the patterning of cortical networks (Luhmann et al. 2016;
Blanquie et al. 2017a; Luhmann and Khazipov 2018). There is,
however, little experimental information about early develop-
ment of neuronal communication in human infants (Omidvarnia
et al. 2014; Tokariev et al. 2016b; Toth et al. 2017) and how net-
work functioning is affected by common medical adversities,
such as prematurity. Prior work has shown that early brain activ-
ity

 synchronized activity alternating with relative quiescence and a
gradual emergence of more continuous neuronal oscillations
that fully replaces the intermittent activity soon after the term-
equivalent
age
in
humans
(Khazipov
and
Luhmann
2006;
Vanhatalo and Kaila 2006). Findings in both animal models
(Brockmann et al. 2011; Colonnese and Khazipov 2012; Luhmann
et al. 2016) and human infants (Omidvarnia et al. 2014; Tokariev
et al. 2016b; Toth et al. 2017) show that temporal correlations
between
these
intermittent
bursts
reflect
early
functional
connectivity networks in the developing cortex. These correla-
tions are also shown to be sensitive to early brain lesions
(Brockmann et al. 2011; Tolner et al. 2012), and may be predictive
of compromised neurodevelopment (Omidvarnia et al. 2015).
Neuronal interactions in large-scale networks give rise to
several kinds of concurrent correlation structures that are
observable in the interareal relationships of cortical phase and
amplitude dynamics in narrow frequency bands. Amplitude–
amplitude correlations (AACs) reflect comodulation of overall
neuronal activity and gross cortical excitability over periods of
seconds (Palva and Palva 2011; Hipp et al. 2012). Phase–phase
correlations (PPCs; a.k.a. phase synchrony), in turn, are thought
to reflect a spatiotemporally accurate mechanism that regu-
lates local neuronal processing and interareal communication.
They indicate consistent subsecond timing relationships in
neuronal spiking (Womelsdorf et al. 2007; Palva and Palva 2011)
and may thus support dynamic integration in neuronal ensem-
bles underlying several cognitive processes (Bressler and Menon
2010; Uhlhaas et al. 2010; Palva and Palva 2011). Neuronal AAC
and PPC networks can be estimated by measuring pairwise AAC
and PPC, respectively, between all brain regions. Overall, several
lines of recent evidence establish a view that brain functions
emerge from multiplex networks shaped by concerted actions of
different coupling mechanisms in several frequency bands (De
Domenico et al. 2016; Siebenhühner et al. 2016).
In the present study, we aimed to assess how preterm birth
changes the AAC and PPC mechanisms in large-scale cortical
networks of human infants. We used a large cohort of newborn
electroencephalographic
(EEG)
recordings
from preterm
and
healthy control infants and developed a novel infant-specific
analysis pipeline to allow noninvasive assessment of functional
networks at cortical source level. These analytical advances
allowed studying effects of early prematurity on multiplex func-
tional cortical networks defined by the 2 coupling mechanisms
in a wide range of frequencies. We hypothesized that prematu-
rity leads to specific changes in the cortical networks of func-
tional connectivity. Based on the recent structural studies
(Batalle et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2017) and prior clinical EEG findings
(André et al. 2010; Hayashi-Kurahashi et al. 2012), we further
hypothesized, that early prematurity would preferentially affect
networks related to anterior brain regions and/or networks
related to lower frequency (≤ 2 Hz) neuronal oscillations.
Methods
The overall scheme of the analysis pipeline can be found in the
Supplemental Figure S1.
Subjects and Recordings
EEG was recorded during daytime sleep from 46 early preterm
(EP) infants and 67 full-term healthy control (HC). All EEG
recordings were performed at term-equivalent age in both
groups (41.3 ± 2 weeks; median ± interquartile range, IQR) in
the Children’s Central Hospital, Helsinki University Central
Hospital. The HC infants were born at a gestational age of 40.4 ±
1.8 weeks, and the EP infants were born at a gestational age of
26.6 ± 1.6 weeks. Neurological assessment was done only for EP
group at the age of 42 ± 3 weeks (Fig. 1a). These infants were
part of larger prospective recruitments in projects on newborn
brain development, and other data pertaining to this cohort has
been published previously (Omidvarnia et al. 2014; Tokariev
et al. 2016b). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the Children’s Hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital,
and informed consent was received from a parent or guardian
before inclusion into the study group.
The EEG signals were collected mainly using NicOne EEG
amplifier (Cardinal Healthcare/Natus, USA). Some of the first EP
infants were recorded using a Cognitrace amplifier (ANT B.V.,
Enschede, The Netherlands). For data collection, we used EEG
caps (sintered Ag/AgCl electrodes; Waveguard, ANT-Neuro,
Germany)
with
28
channels
positioned
according
to
the
International 10–20 standard. More details on the newborn EEG
recording method can be found at http://www.babacenter.fi/en/
methods/eeg and in references Vanhatalo et al. (2008) and
Stjerna et al. (2012).
The recording session was continued until the infant had
been through both sleep (or vigilance) states: active and quiet
sleep (AS and QS, respectively; Fig. 1b), as defined by conven-
tional criteria (André et al. 2010). For sleep state and data quality
assessment, we included the following polygraphic channels:
chin electromyogram, electrocardiogram, eye movements, and
respiratory
sensors.
For
analysis,
we
selected
5-min-long
artefact-free EEG epochs from the most representative epoch of
each vigilance state (AS and QS). EEG during AS consists of con-
tinuous fluctuations, respiration is irregular and eye movements
are occasionally present, whereas EEG during QS is characteristi-
cally discontinuous (trace discontinue; André et al. 2010) and
respiration is regular (see also Grigg-Damberger et al. 2007). We
selected continuous epochs of EEG that were as long as possible,
and if significant movement artefacts contaminated the record-
ings, we generated a 5-min epoch from several shorter EEG
epochs. We used the same 19 EEG derivations from each subject
for further analysis. After rejecting individual EEG data due to
insufficient quality or length, the final study cohort consisted of
4 groups: HC-AS (N = 53), HC-QS (N = 66), EP-AS (N = 46), and EP-
QS (N = 42). To ensure full comparability across the dataset, all
EEG signals were exported into European Data Format.
Analysis Software
Data analysis was performed using custom scripts in Matlab
software (Version R2015b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) as well
as open source toolboxes: FSL (Smith et al. 2004) (http://fsl.
fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki), Brainstorm (Tadel et al. 2011) (http://
neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm),
and
openMEEG
(Gramfort
et al. 2010) (http://openmeeg.github.io). 3D brain networks visu-
alization was done using BrainNet Viewer (Xia et al. 2013)
(http://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv).
Data Preprocessing
All EEG recordings were low-pass filtered using seventh order
Butterworth filter with cut-off frequency 45 Hz, downsampled
to Fs = 100 Hz, and converted to average reference montage.
Signals were then filtered into 12 different frequency bands
with central frequencies Fc = 0.4, 0.7, 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 4, 5.7, 8, 11.3,
16, and 22.6 Hz. The lowest frequency band (around Fc = 0.4 Hz)
was filtered within 0.2–0.6 Hz. All other bands were filtered

 using cut-off frequencies as 0.85·Fc – 1.15·Fc to yield comparable
bandwidths on a logarithmic scale. The band-pass filtering was
implemented using a combination of low-pass and high-pass
Butterworth filters with an attenuation at the stop-band of
40 dB. Nonlinear phase distortions due to Butterworth filters
were avoided by applying filters in both forward and backward
directions.
Infant Head Model
A realistic infant head model was generated from the anatomi-
cal magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the healthy full-term
baby (Fig. 1c). The 3-shell physical model included scalp, skull
and intracranial surfaces downsampled to 2562 equidistant
vertices each. The scalp EEG electrodes (N = 19) were placed in
the model according to the International 10–20 system as in the
actual EEG recordings. We found that an accurate segmentation
of the cortical gyri of an individual infant is not possible due to
contrast and resolution issues relative to tissue geometry;
hence, we opted to use an established gyrated cortical surface
(“Colin 27” in the Brainstorm software) as the source space in
our model (Tokariev et al. 2016a). It was rescaled into the infant
brain size, smoothed to match with the cortical folding at the
age of the analyzed subjects (smoothing with a factor of 20%),
and positioned to the original cortical surface in the indivi-
dual’s MRI. The resulting cortical surface was downsampled to
8014 vertices, each of which corresponded to the location of
dipoles, representing neuronal electric activity, with fixed per-
pendicular orientation.
The forward model (matrix that estimates the contribution
of each cortical dipole to scalp EEG) was computed using sym-
metric boundary element method with the openMEEG package
(Gramfort et al. 2010). Based on recent simulation and empirical
studies on newborn head models, we set the following conduc-
tivity values: scalp 0.43 S/m, intracranial volume 1.79 S/m, and
skull 0.2 S/m (Despotovic et al. 2013; Odabaee et al. 2014;
Tokariev et al. 2016a).
Cortical Parcellation
Parcellation of the cortical sources into clusters was performed
using an inflated cortical surface. First, we applied K-means
clustering to the dipoles positions on one hemisphere. The
coordinates of the closest source to the C3 electrode was taken
as the centroid position of the first parcel, and the number of
parcels was chosen as N = 32. Mirroring the positions of output
cluster centroids from one hemisphere to the other, followed
by the clustering procedure, gave a symmetric parcellation
between 2 hemispheres. After rejection of 3 midline parcels
from each hemisphere, we got a final atlas with N = 58 parcels.
Each resulting parcel was roundish in shape and included 125 ±
26 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) cortical sources. Based on
their anatomical location, parcels were assigned to one of the
following brain areas used in regional comparisons: frontal,
central, occipital, and temporal (Fig. 1c).
We made a deliberate choice for random parcellation as
opposed to the anatomically defined parcellation schemes that
are popular in MRI research. This was motivated by the fact
that a random parcellation would allow the most balanced

the analytical phase of the source signals, followed by estimating stability of
phase difference using debiased weighted phase lag index (dwPLI).

 representation of the global network function recorded by the
scalp EEG electrodes. Recent work in network neuroscience has
suggested that the accurate edge or node localization may be
less important than the global or regional dynamics, which are
readily captured by the random parcels. Moreover, several
physical factors preclude an accurate representation of scalp
EEG data by anatomically defined parcels, such as their uneven
parcel geometry or the inherent variations in scalp electrode
positions (Kabdebon et al. 2014).
Computation of Cortical Signals
To compute cortical source signals, we used dynamical Statistical
Parametric Mapping (Dale et al. 2000), which is an elaborated ver-
sion of the minimum-norm-estimate (MNE) method. For the noise
covariance matrix, we used an identity matrix that considers the
same level of noise at all recording electrodes. As a result, we
obtained 8014 signals (one for each dipole on the cortical surface).
These source signals were collapsed into 58 parcel signals
representing the average electric neuronal activity in the corti-
cal area. Prior to this step, we used extensive simulations to
define how closely each source represents the activity of its
host parcel. For more details, see Supplemental Figure S2 and
Korhonen et al. (2014). In brief, we set unique reference signals
(Sref) to each parcel. Sources within the host parcel had the
same Sref. Then, we applied forward and inverse modeling
using an infant head model. This led to a series of the newly
reconstructed source signals (Srec). By computing Pearson corre-
lation for each source between Sref and Srec we obtained a set of
weights (w) named the Collapse Operator:

Finally, parcel signals (Sp) were computed as a weighted
average activity of all sources within the same parcel:

where N is the number of sources within the same parcel, i is a
source index, and Ssrc is the real source time series.
Measures of Functional Connectivity: AAC and PPC
AAC was computed for signal pairs after their mutual orthogonali-
zation to minimize spurious correlations caused by volume conduc-
tion (Brookes et al. 2012). In this study, we orthogonalized parcel
signals relative to each other in 2-s-long nonoverlapping windows.
Next, we applied Hilbert transform to obtain their complex repre-
sentation and computed amplitude envelopes at each time point
by taking absolute values. Finally, AAC was estimated using
Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between amplitude envelopes.
Because orthogonalization of signal X relative to signal Y and in the
opposite direction (Y relatively to X) are not identical, we computed
r in both directions and used mean of their absolute values.
PPC between parcel signals was computed using debiased
estimator of the squared weighted phase lag index (dwPLI)
(Vinck et al. 2011). This index seeks to minimize potential con-
founding by linear mixing of common sources, which are typi-
cally seen at near zero phase lags.
Reliability Assessment of Connectivity Matrix
It is obvious that even an optimal source reconstruction of
our scalp EEG recordings may not lead to a fully accurate
representation of all 1653 pairwise interactions between 58
reconstructed cortical parcels. We, therefore, carried out a sys-
tematic simulation study to define the accuracy of connectivity
estimates in each source pairs with respect to the underlying
scalp EEG recordings. This allowed constructing a mask that is
specific to a given recording configuration (placement and
number of EEG electrodes), and it allows the selection of only
connections with reliable estimates.
The detailed procedure of this fidelity testing is described in
the Supplemental Figure S3. In brief, we generated unique ref-
erence signals (Sref) for every parcel in a same manner as
described above. Two parcels at a time were set in complete
phase synchrony with a phase lag of 90° (dwPLI = 1) while
others were set to have independent signals. This was repeated
100 times for each parcel pair (every time a new set of Sref was
simulated), and we computed the mean of all tests (
⁎
dwPLI ),
separately for all possible parcel pairs. Next, we ran 500 simula-
tions where all Sref were independent of each other, and com-
puted dwPLI* values between all possible output parcel signals
pairs. This led to a set of 826 500 surrogate values where the
‘threshold of reliability’ for
⁎
dwPLI values was taken at the 99th
percentile.
The
obtained
binary
mask
gave
us
a
Fidelity
Operator that allowed the masking of real adjacency matrices.
With
our
present
recording
constellation,
this
procedure
rejected about 40% of all pairs from further analysis.
Comparison of Connectivity Strengths
Global connectivity strength was computed for each infant as
the global mean of all edges. Three different types of regional
comparisons were assessed: interactions within the parcels of
each area (intrahemispheric), interactions between symmetric
parcels across hemispheres (interhemispheric), as well as other
interareal interactions.
All comparisons of connectivity strength levels were done
separately for all frequency bands and for each vigilance state.
Comparison of vigilance states in HC infants (Fig. 2a) was done
for those subjects where epochs at both states were available (N
= 52). All group comparisons were done using Wilcoxon signed-
rank test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. Alpha level
was taken as 0.05. Post hoc control for multiple comparisons
was done by rejecting the fraction of the weakest significant
observations. This fraction was taken as 5% from the overall
number of tests and corresponds to expected level of false posi-
tives for the defined significance level (Palva et al. 2010).
Reliability of the findings was also tested using “split-
cohort” approach, that is, same tests applied to the first and
the second halves (based on the EEG recording dates) of each
group separately (Supplemental Fig. S4)
Computation of Consistent Networks and Their
Densities
A consistent network refers to set of the strongest edges that is
coherent across a given group. They were computed separately
for each group (EP-AS, EP-QS, HC-AS, and HC-QS), indepen-
dently for PPC and AAC, and for all frequency bands.
First, we detected k percent of the strongest edges in the
corrected adjacency matrices of every subject in the group.
This led to a set of binary arrays that were summed over the
group to indicate the number of subjects with a given edge
among k of the strongest. These values were used to compute
binomial cumulative probabilities (probability of success was k,
number of trials was equal to the number of subjects in the

 group, and alpha level was 0.05). We applied Benjamini–Hochberg
method for false discovery rate (FDR) correction (with alpha level
0.05) of the output. The subset of edges passing this test was
coined as a consistent network (Supplemental Fig. S5). We tested
k = 10%, 20%, and 30% and found the results to be robust to differ-
ent threshold values (see Supplemental Figs S6–8).
We computed density values as a fraction of consistent
edges from the overall number of edges. This was computed for
all frequency bands separately. A higher density is taken to
indicate group-level stability in network spatial organization.
The Matlab code for computing consistent networks and their
features can be found at https://github.com/babyEEG/neoNets.
Testing of Difference in Network Densities
In order to allow testing significance of differences in network
densities between groups, we computed confidence intervals
(SD) for the density values using a bootstrapping approach. We
randomly selected the same number of adjacency matrices
from
the
set
of
original
matrices
at
a
given
frequency.
Consistent networks and density values were computed from
this surrogate set as described above, and the procedure was
repeated 300 times for each case.
To test the significance of density differences, we randomly
shuffled original adjacency matrices across the compared

across all pairs of cortical sources, ordered according to brain regions (Fig. 1c). Comparison of source strengths indicates significant differences between sleep states
across wide range of frequencies. (b) Densities of networks that are consistent across the infant groups are shown for both AAC (left) and PPC (right) connectivity
modes, for both AS and QS, respectively. Comparison of sleep states indicates several frequencies with significant differences. The circle diagrams below the plots
visualize the topographic distribution of networks at each example frequencies (AAC at Fc = 2.8 Hz and PPC at Fc = 1 Hz). Color hues reflect the edge frequency (f)
across the group. Note, that group consistent networks are sparse at the lowest frequencies in both connectivity modes and sleep states. The lines on both plots
show mean (solid) and SEM (standard error of the mean; shaded). Group difference was tested with Wilcoxon sign-rank test in (a) and using randomization test in (b)
followed by post hoc correction. Size of the asterisks relates to the statistical significance level (small: P < 0.05; medium: P < 0.01; big: P < 0.001).

 groups, keeping corresponding numbers of subjects in each
group. The network densities and their difference were then
computed
for
each
surrogate
group.
This
procedure
was
repeated in 500 iterations for each case and the absolute values
of the output differences were used to assess the significance.
We computed the significance thresholds from the surrogate
differences at the 95th, 99th, and 99.9th percentile.
Overlap Between Individual’s Network With the Group
Wise Consistent Network
First, we computed the frequency of appearance (f) for all edges
in the consistent network by masking the group sum array
(sum of binary individual arrays with a fixed k) with the consis-
tent network (binary array showing the significantly repeated
edges across the group). The product was divided by the num-
ber of subjects within the group, and the frequency matrix
(group reference array) was normalized in a way that the sum
of all elements is 1. To assess the overlap of the individual k
strongest edges in each subject with the group reference array,
we computed the products of the corresponding elements.
Finally, we took the sum of the resultant matrix. The overlap of
an individual’s network with the group reference would then
vary between 0 and 1 when the spatial overlap varies from no
overlap to complete overlap, respectively. For more details, see
Supplemental Figure S5.
Neurological Performance Scores
The
infants
were
assessed
using
Hammersmith
Neonatal
Neurological Examination (HNNE) (Dubowitz et al. 1999) at
term-equivalent age. HNNE consists of a large number of semi-
quantitative test items that belong to 6 different domains in
neurology and neurobehaviour (posture tonus, tone patterns,
reflexes, movements, abnormal signs, orientation and behavior).
In order to render the multidimensional HNNE assessment
into a suitable form for studying associations with functional
network measures, we defined 2 combination scores C1 and C2.
Initially, the interitem relations of HNNE and combinations of
individual items within and across the main HNNE domains
were studied in relation to the infants’ later neurodevelopment.
After thorough examination of HNNE item combinations, we
identified 3 individual items for further use: visual alertness
(VA), head raising in prone (HRP) and increased (neck) extensor
tone (IET). These 3 individual items were processed with princi-
pal component analysis (PCA) with Varimax Rotation to yield a
2-component solution (C1 and C2). Post hoc comparison of C1
and C2 with characteristics of later development showed that
C1 was mainly associated with later motor development while
C2 correlated with later cognitive and social development. The
outcome benchmark was taken from the neurodevelopmental
assessment at the age of 2 years using the Bayley Scales of
Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) (Bayley 2006) and/or
the Griffiths scales (GMDS) (Griffiths et al. 1996).
Correlation Between Networks and Neurological
Performance
We computed Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between mea-
sures of functional connectivity strength and network overlap
from each subject in the EP group with the corresponding neu-
rological performance scores C1 and C2. That was done for all
frequency bands, both sleep states (AS and QS), and for both
global and interareal measures. The significance of findings
was assessed by computing Bayes Factor (BF) (Wetzels and
Wagenmakers 2012) for all output r, where cases with BF < 3
were
determined
to
be
unlikely
to
support
the
tested
hypotheses.
Results
EEG data from 46 EP babies and 67 full-term HC were recorded
at term-equivalent age (Fig. 1a). Five-minute EEG epochs of 2
different vigilance states, active and quiet sleep (AS and QS)
that correspond roughly to rapid eye movement (REM) and
non-REM sleep, respectively, were analyzed in 12 frequency
bands ranging from 0.1 to 26 Hz (Fig. 1b). We developed a novel
source analysis for newborn infants and performed a series of
simulations of cortical interactions using forward and inverse
modeling to estimate the reliability of source connectivity
graphs (see Methods and Supplemental Figs S1–3). In the analy-
ses of EEG data, the activity time series of 58 cortical parcels,
that is, cortical areas, were source reconstructed using MNE
based inverse modeling with a realistic neonatal head model
(Fig. 1c). To estimate interareal functional connectivity, we esti-
mated bivariate AAC and PPC between all pairs of cortical par-
cels (Fig. 1d).
Neuronal Networks Change Between Vigilance States
Previous studies using scalp EEG recordings have suggested
that vigilance states may be associated with distinct functional
network states in healthy infants (Tokariev et al. 2016b). We,
therefore, assessed whether and how much the vigilance
states, AS and QS, were reflected in the strength and consis-
tency of functional networks.
To test this, we first compared the AS and QS epochs by
global mean strengths of AAC and PPC networks for all fre-
quencies in HC infants. The group comparisons (Wilcoxon
signed-rank test) disclosed widespread differences that were
distinct for phase and amplitude correlations and dependent
on oscillation frequency (Fig. 2a). The AACs were generally
stronger during AS at the lowest (0.4–0.7 Hz) frequencies (P <
0.05), and stronger during QS at all higher (2.8–22.6 Hz) frequen-
cies (P < 0.001). However, PPCs was significantly stronger during
AS at the mid-frequency range 2.8–4 Hz (P < 0.05), while QS
exhibited significantly stronger PPCs both at the low (0.7–1 Hz,
P < 0.05) and high (16–22.6 Hz, P < 0.001) frequencies. A split-
cohort reliability test indicated these results to be robust
(Supplemental Fig. S4). Visual assessment of the EEG signals
during rapid eye movements in AS suggested that frontal corre-
lations in EEG signals are not explained by eye movement arte-
facts (Supplemental Fig. S9).
We then assessed vigilance state effects on the spatial net-
work organization by identifying consistent networks, which
are subsets of the strongest functional links (edges) that are sig-
nificantly
common
across
the
whole
subject
group
(see
Supplemental Fig. S5). We calculated network density as the
fraction of consistent edges from the number of all possible
pairwise functional interactions. Density measures the degree
of similarity, or consistency, between subjects in the group. We
used a bootstrapping approach to test the significance of differ-
ence in densities between AS and QS. The density of consistent
networks was generally low at the lowest frequencies (Fig. 2b),
but QS was found to exhibit significantly denser networks in
both AAC (1 Hz, P < 0.001; and 2–2.8 Hz, P < 0.05) and PPC
(0.4–1 Hz; P < 0.01) mechanisms. The networks formed by AAC
at the middle frequency 5.7 Hz were denser during AS (P <

 0.001). These results were stable regardless of whether 10%,
20%, or 30% of the strongest edges were included into the esti-
mation of consistent networks (Supplemental Fig. S6).
Taken together, the results show that both AAC and PPC
networks differ between vigilance states and that these differ-
ences
are
seen
at
multiple
frequencies
in
both
network
strength and consistency.
Prematurity is Associated With Stronger but Less
Consistent AAC Networks
We first examined the effects of prematurity on the AAC net-
works. The global strengths of AAC at each frequency were first
compared between HC and EP infants during each vigilance
state separately. We found significantly greater mean global
AAC strengths in the EP infants at the lowest frequencies
(Fig. 3a) in both vigilance states (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum
test). This prompted further assessment of the neuroanatomi-
cal underpinnings of such group differences. We estimated the
mean interareal AAC strengths in intrahemispheric, interhemi-
spheric, and cross-regional interactions, and found several
topologically specific differences between EP and HC infants.
The AAC networks during both vigilance states were stronger
in the EP infants at the lowest (≤ 2.8 Hz) frequencies, and the
significant differences were widespread, connecting the frontal
or central regions (Fig. 3a). The EP infants also showed stronger
AAC
connectivity
during
AS
at
the
highest
frequencies
(11–23 Hz) in the same networks. HC infants, however, showed
a stronger AAC only in the middle frequency range (2.8–8 Hz) in
connections unrelated to frontal areas.
In addition to network strengths, prematurity could also
cause increased heterogeneity in the AAC networks due to indi-
vidually variable and diffuse subcortical insults (Batalle et al.
2017) caused by medical adversities during early preterm care
(Penn et al. 2016). This would be observable as lower density of
consistent networks across the group of EP infants. To test the
idea, we evaluated consistent networks in both infant groups
as above, and tested their statistical difference using a random-
ization test where labels of EP and HC infants were shuffled.
We found that density of middle frequency AAC networks were
significantly sparser in the infants exposed to prematurity, and
that the finding was unrelated to vigilance state (4–8 Hz at AS
and 2–5.7 Hz at QS, P < 0.05; Fig. 3b). The observations were
robust across a range of different thresholds for the group con-
sistent networks (Supplemental Fig. S7). Further visual inspec-
tion of the group-level consistent networks (Fig. 3b) suggested
that EP and HC infants had distinct global architectures of AAC
connectivity. In line with the above findings on AAC network
strengths, these differences were most salient in interhemi-
spheric connections as well as in the connections between fron-
tal and other regions.
These findings together supported the hypothesis that pre-
maturity affects AAC networks in specific oscillatory frequen-
cies and cortical structures. We found prematurity to lead to
stronger
low-frequency

 attenuated posterior middle-frequency AAC networks. In addi-
tion, prematurity resulted in lower network density, that is,
more heterogenous AAC networks in the middle frequencies.
PPC Networks are Widely Dispersed by Prematurity
We first assessed the effects of prematurity on PPC networks
with the mean global strengths of PPC networks. We found
comparable levels of PPC in both infant groups (Fig. 4a), with
only the low frequency (0.7–1 Hz, P < 0.05) being stronger in EP
infants during AS. Further regional comparisons suggested that
those findings are mainly due to significantly stronger low fre-
quency PPC in the frontal and/or central regions of the EP
infants (Fig. 4a).
While the overall strength of PPC networks was not very
much affected by prematurity, it would still be conceivable that
the diffuse structural injuries related to prematurity could
translate into increased heterogeneity in network patterning.
To test this idea, we estimated the densities of group consistent
networks for all frequencies and both vigilance states as above.
We found large differences in PPC network consistencies
between the EP and HC infants (Fig. 4b). The HC infants had
robustly greater network consistency in both vigilance states
and at most frequencies, in particular, at the lower (0.4–0.7 Hz
at AS and 0.4–2 Hz at QS, P < 0.05) and at the highest
(11.3–22.6 Hz at both states, P < 0.01) frequencies. Results were
also robust to the choice of the threshold used in estimating
the
consistent
networks
and
their
density
(Supplemental
Fig. S8). Further visual inspection of the consistent network
graphs (Fig. 4b) suggested salient differences in the interhemi-
spheric connections, as well as in the longitudinal connections
between frontal and other regions (Fig. 4b), both of which
appeared denser in the HC infants.
These observations together indicate that while prematurity
has only minor effects on the strength of phase coupling, it is
associated with large-scale dispersion of PPC networks essen-
tially throughout the studied frequency spectrum and across
widely separated brain regions.
Frontal PPC Networks Correlate With Newborn
Neurological Performance
The findings above showed that prematurity is correlated with
several specific changes in the early PPC and AAC networks. To
see whether these network changes are clinically meaningful
in terms of neurological performance and thus functionally sig-
nificant in brain development, we studied the EP infants using
a standardized neurological assessment by the time of the EEG
recordings. The high dimensionality (6 main dimensions, 34
items) of this clinical assessment was reduced using PCA to
obtain neurological combination scores that were predictive of
motor (C1) and neurocognitive (C2) development, respectively
(see Methods).
We then studied correlations between neurological scores
and the strengths of global as well as interareal AAC and PPC
networks by computing Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and
their corresponding BF. We did not find any significant relation-
ships between the strength of AAC networks and either of the

 neurological performance scores. However, we found multiple
significant correlations in both vigilance states between the
strength of PPC networks and the C2 score, all in the 1.4–4 Hz
frequency range (Fig. 5a) and involving the frontal regions and
frontooccipital connections.
The prior findings in this study showed that prematurity
was associated with greatly reduced consistency of the func-
tional connectivity networks, which was independent of the
prematurity effects on coupling strengths per se. We next
asked whether abnormal individual network architectures were
predictive of the neurological performance. To this end, we
computed for each EP infant their networks’ deviations from
the group-average networks and correlated that to neurological
performance scores. Individual deviation was estimated as the
spatial overlap between the subset of the strongest edges in the
individual network with the corresponding group-level network
(see Methods). We computed this for the whole network (global
overlap) as well as for region-specific connections (local over-
lap). We found that frontally connecting networks were selec-
tively correlated with neurological performance, however, the
frequency range and direction of correlation were opposite
between PPC and AAC. A higher overlap of the low frequency
(1.4–2 Hz) frontocentral PPC networks correlated with better
neurological performance (r = 0.47, BF = 9) in both motor (C1)
and cognitive scores (C2). In contrast, increasing deviance from
group average AAC networks correlated with better neurologi-
cal scores (r ≤ −0.51, BF ≥ 18; Fig. 5b) within frontotemporal
connections at a higher frequency range (11.3–22.6 Hz). The cor-
responding results were robust to different thresholds (k = 10%,
and 20%). Comparison of group-level networks showed that
these frontally connecting subnetworks are highly comparable
between EP and HC infants (Fig. 5b).
These findings together show that frontally connecting PPC
networks, both in terms of coupling strength and consistency
of network structures, are clearly predictive of neurological per-
formance in newborn infants exposed to prematurity.
Discussion
We show that spontaneous human cortical activity at birth is
already organized into multiplex functional connectivity net-
works in several frequency bands, which are reactive to

Figure 5. Relationships between cortical networks and neurological performance in the infants exposed to early prematurity. (a) Correlation analysis between regional
PPC strength and the neurological score C2 showed significant relationships during both active sleep (AS) and quiet sleep (QS). The stronger PPC at connections
involving frontal regions is correlated to better neurological performance at term age. The matrices only depict findings for cases with BF > 3 for Pearson correlation r
that is shown in the cells. Example scatter plots (red frames) are shown for the relationship between PPC strength and C2 across the whole infant group. (b) Overlap
between network topology of EP individuals and their mean group pattern is correlated with neurological performance (for both C1 and C2) in PPC networks at lower
frequencies (1.4–2 Hz) for multiplex connections. For the AAC networks, a deviation from the group-average network in frontotemporal connections at high frequen-
cies (11.3–22.6 Hz) was associated with better neurological output (C1 and C2). The circle diagrams below each scatter plot show comparison of network overlaps
between HC and EP infants for the corresponding interareal subnetwork. Red lines depict edges that are present in both groups while gray lines represent edges only

 changes in vigilance states. Moreover, we show that the most
common clinical risk factor, preterm birth (WHO 2012), leads to
selective dysconnectivity in frontal cortical networks in interar-
eal phase coupling in a manner correlative to individual new-
born neurological performance. Our work employed novel
realistic cortical source reconstruction methods and extensive
computer simulations to carry out reliable network analyses. The
findings are broadly consistent with the recent work on adult
brain where it has become clear that multiple frequency-specific
networks coexist (De Domenico et al. 2016; Siebenhühner et al.
2016; Yu et al. 2017) and correlate with normal and pathological
behavior (Siebenhühner et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2017).
Our findings suggest 2 apparently contrasting network
effects that are associated with prematurity. First, EP infants
showed stronger PPC and AAC connections at low frequencies
in the frontal regions. Strength of frontal low frequency net-
works at term age may reflect immaturity, since prior clinical
studies on extremely preterm infants have reported delayed
occurrence of frontal EEG waveforms, such as “encoches fron-
tales” or anterior slow dysrhythmia (André et al. 2010). Second,
EP infants exhibited lower network density over a wide fre-
quency range in both AAC and PPC networks. This implies
higher interindividual variability in network topology across EP
infants. A recent study demonstrated high overlap in structural
networks patterns between healthy newborn and adult brains
(van den Heuvel et al. 2015), suggesting the early establishment
of consistent structural brain network architecture. We suggest
that the increased network variability in EP infants represents
electrophysiological correlates for the known clinical diversity
of neurodevelopmental trajectories (WHO 2012; Johnson and
Marlow 2017), resulting from a wide range of early and late clin-
ical adversities (Penn et al. 2016).
Our findings are broadly supported by prior human infant
studies using MRI that show diverse microstructural effects of
prematurity on subcortical network maturation (Batalle et al.
2017; Guo et al. 2017) or cortical folding (Lefevre et al. 2016).
Some studies have also evaluated spatial correlations in blood
flow using functional MRI (fMRI) where prematurity may affect
some spatial correlation structures (Karolis et al. 2016; Smyser
et al. 2016). To the best of our knowledge, however, this is the
first study in the newborn human to characterize corticocorti-
cal networks that operate at millisecond (PPC) and multisecond
(AAC) ranges. The rapid temporal dynamics and the multiplex
nature in these neuronal activity networks challenge or pre-
clude direct comparisons to studies that examine much slower
changes in blood flow via neurovascular coupling, such as
those recorded with fMRI or near infrared spectroscopy. Indeed,
recent experimental evidence suggests that the developmen-
tally unique early cortical activity studied in our EEG work
(Vanhatalo and Kaila 2006; Colonnese and Khazipov 2012;
Luhmann et al. 2016) would escape fMRI-based detection as
they have little or no correlates in blood oxygenation/flow fluc-
tuations (Colonnese and Khazipov 2012; Zehendner et al. 2013;
Kozberg and Hillman 2016). Hence, further mechanistic expla-
nation of our present findings need comparison to electrophys-
iological recordings in experimental studies.
Despite the differences in time scales and the conceptual
dichotomy between PPC and AAC coupling (Engel et al. 2013),
networks operating with these 2 mechanisms are not mutually
exclusive, and they may even be mutually correlated (Zhigalov
et al. 2017). This may be particularly the case in the newborn
brain where the observed frequency-specific reductions in net-
work density by EP may find an intriguing resolution from the
structure of early cortical activity. The spontaneous, spatially
coordinated transients of neuronal activity are a characteristic
property of early brain activity, which may give rise to both
coupling mechanisms at the same time.
Recent, extensive work with animal models has provided
detailed insight to the mechanisms and developmental impor-
tance of these early network events. These events are now
implicated in the guidance of early network growth as well as
in supporting neuronal survival (Blankenship and Feller 2010;
Colonnese and Khazipov 2012; Luhmann et al. 2016; Blanquie
et al. 2017a). Their electrical signature in animal models is
intermittent occurrence of neuronal activity that gives rise to
different frequency components within cortical, subplate and
thalamocortical networks (Luhmann et al. 2016; Luhmann and
Khazipov 2018). In the neocortex, these events are often
referred to as spindle bursts, however, different types of inter-
mittent network activities may be recognized in, for example,
the hippocampus or other deep nuclei. Studies on spontaneous
brain activity in the human infant are always limited to nonin-
vasive measures from the scalp, and the recorded EEG activity
is presumably of cortical or subcortical origin. Hence, the vari-
ety of neuronal network events observed in the invasive animal
recordings cannot be observed in the human studies, and the
correlations between species remain at the level of identifying
computational or phenomenological correlates.
It is now widely accepted that the spontaneous activity
transients (SAT; a.k.a. bursts or delta brushes) would be likely
correlates of the neocortical spindle bursts identified in rodents
(Vanhatalo and Kaila 2006; Luhmann et al. 2016). They are mul-
tifrequency events that dominate newborn EEG activity. Our
present findings in human EEG are compatible with the idea
that lower frequency PPC relates to synchrony within the slow
carrier wave generated in the deeper cortical structures during
these
bursts
as
shown
in
rodent
models
(Khazipov
and
Luhmann 2006; Luhmann and Khazipov 2018). Higher frequency
AAC could, in turn, arise from the intracortical activity and relate
to large-scale spatial co-occurrence of these events, which is
recently shown in both animal (Brockmann et al. 2011; Luhmann
et al. 2016) and human studies (Omidvarnia et al. 2014). However,
direct multisite recordings covering multiple neocortical regions
and layers, as well as computational analyses using AAC and PPC
metrics (Brockmann et al. 2011; Reincke and Hanganu-Opatz
2017), are needed to firmly establish the actual cellular correlates
of the coupling metrics used in our present work.
Given the above proposed underlying cellular level mecha-
nisms, our findings suggest an intriguing hypothesis to explain
why EP infants have lower network densities, or more variable
networks. It is now widely accepted that brain networks are
established with guidance of the intermittent neuronal net-
work events (Blankenship and Feller 2010; Hanganu-Opatz
2010; Brockmann et al. 2011; Minlebaev et al. 2011; Luhmann
and Khazipov 2018). Their experimental reduction in animal
models leads to neuronal apoptosis (Blanquie et al. 2017a, b) as
well as network derangements (Tolner et al. 2012). Prior work
in human infants is consistent with this idea, showing that
reduced early activity leads to slower structural brain growth
(Benders et al. 2015). Our work is compatible with the idea that
prematurity compromises this activity-dependent development
by affecting the SATs that would normally function as spatially
coordinating training mechanism for the first neuronal net-
works. This activity-dependent but experience-independent
mechanism is genetically programmed leading to relatively
consistent networks observed in the HC infants (van den
Heuvel et al. 2015), which would then be disturbed by multitude
of pathologies that may face EP infants (Penn et al. 2016). Direct

 experimental testing of this hypothesis may be impossible in
the human newborn, however, experimental animal models
could be used via the proposed translational benchmarks
(Vanhatalo and Kaila 2006; Luhmann et al. 2016; Reincke and
Hanganu-Opatz 2017; Luhmann and Khazipov 2018).
Our spatial analyses suggest that prematurity selectively
affects the functional connections from frontal to other cortical
regions, and, moreover, neurological scores of EP infants were
selectively correlated to the cortical networks involving frontal
regions. The findings are consistent with the broader idea that
brain network development follows different trajectories in
precentral and postcentral areas (Vasung et al. 2011; Fransson
et al. 2013; Kostović et al. 2014; Omidvarnia et al. 2014; Dubois
et al. 2015). Our work provides support from the level of neuro-
nal activity for the many prior works that have shown how pre-
maturity effects frontal subcortical microstructure, including
connections with and within frontal lobes (Batalle et al. 2017;
Guo et al. 2017) as well as development in cognitive functions
assigned to frontal regions (Johnson and Marlow 2017). Early
white matter lesions in the frontal areas are selectively associ-
ated with the neurocognitive development of preterm infants
(Guo et al. 2017). This effect is suggested to arise from deranged
extracellular matrix at the major cross-roads, leading to dis-
turbed development of corticocortical association fibers, glial
cell structures as well as ongoing neuronal migration (Judaš
et al. 2005; Jovanov-Miloševi´
c et al. 2014). More generally,
involvement of frontal regions is not limited to early life
pathologies, as deficits in frontal neuronal synchrony appears
to persist through childhood in ex-EP children (Moiseev et al.
2015), and they also characterize acquired conditions such as
traumatic brain injuries of adults (Vakorin et al. 2016).
The 2 modes of neuronal connectivity, AAC and PPC, exhib-
ited different correlations with clinical performance assessed
by neurological scores. The strength in low frequency PPC net-
works was strongly correlated with performance, while no cor-
relations were observed for AAC networks. Prior work in adults
suggests that AAC networks are related to the structural con-
nectome, while PPC networks are more reflection of functional
constellations that serve more dynamic, complex brain opera-
tions (Palva and Palva 2011; Engel et al. 2013). It has been
shown in both histological and in vivo imaging studies that
long range integrative networks akin to the adult connectome
emerge very early in development (Ball et al. 2014; van den
Heuvel et al. 2015), followed by growth of shorter corticocortical
pathways (Vasung et al. 2011; Kostović et al. 2014; Dubois et al.
2015), the latter of which appear to be more affected by expo-
sure to prematurity (Karolis et al. 2016; Batalle et al. 2017). We
propose that PPC of frontal cortical networks reflects the func-
tional integrity of these local corticocortical pathways, and that
frontal PPC could offer the first functional measure of brain net-
works that correlates with clinical performance in newborn
infants exposed to prematurity. Pending validation with larger
scale cohorts, such early functional biomarkers of neurodevelop-
ment hold promise for improving understanding how early pre-
maturity
leads
to
adverse
developmental
trajectories.
In
addition, functional measures of neuronal network activity might
provide an early benchmark for novel therapeutic interventions,
which would hold promise for significantly expediting therapeu-
tic studies by complementing long-term follow-up protocols.
