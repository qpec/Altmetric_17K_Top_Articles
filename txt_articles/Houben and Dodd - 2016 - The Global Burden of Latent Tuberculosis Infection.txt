Abstract
Background
The existing estimate of the global burden of latent TB infection (LTBI) as “one-third” of the
world population is nearly 20 y old. Given the importance of controlling LTBI as part of the
End TB Strategy for eliminating TB by 2050, changes in demography and scientific under-
standing, and progress in TB control, it is important to re-assess the global burden of LTBI.
Methods and Findings
We constructed trends in annual risk in infection (ARI) for countries between 1934 and
2014 using a combination of direct estimates of ARI from LTBI surveys (131 surveys from
1950 to 2011) and indirect estimates of ARI calculated from World Health Organisation
(WHO) estimates of smear positive TB prevalence from 1990 to 2014. Gaussian process
regression was used to generate ARIs for country-years without data and to represent
uncertainty. Estimated ARI time-series were applied to the demography in each country to
calculate the number and proportions of individuals infected, recently infected (infected
within 2 y), and recently infected with isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains. Resulting estimates
were aggregated by WHO region. We estimated the contribution of existing infections to TB
incidence in 2035 and 2050.
In 2014, the global burden of LTBI was 23.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 20.4%–
26.4%), amounting to approximately 1.7 billion people. WHO South-East Asia, Western-
Pacific, and Africa regions had the highest prevalence and accounted for around 80% of
those with LTBI. Prevalence of recent infection was 0.8% (95% UI: 0.7%–0.9%) of the
global population, amounting to 55.5 (95% UI: 48.2–63.8) million individuals currently at
high risk of TB disease, of which 10.9% (95% UI:10.2%–11.8%) was isoniazid-resistant.
Current LTBI alone, assuming no additional infections from 2015 onwards, would be
expected to generate TB incidences in the region of 16.5 per 100,000 per year in 2035 and
8.3 per 100,000 per year in 2050.

Conclusions
We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion individuals were latently infected with Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis (M.tb) globally in 2014, just under a quarter of the global population.
Investment in new tools to improve diagnosis and treatment of those with LTBI at risk of
progressing to disease is urgently needed to address this latent reservoir if the 2050 target
of eliminating TB is to be reached.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Addressing the latent TB infection reservoir is critical to achieving TB elimination.
• The current estimate that “one-third” of the global population is infected with tuberculo-
sis is widely cited but has not been formally estimated for nearly 20 y.
• Changes in demography, the size and distribution of TB burden, as well as new scientific
insights and the availability of new data mean a re-estimation is needed.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We generated an annual risk of infection between 1934 and 2014 and applied this to a
country-level demographic model, quantifying uncertainty wherever possible.
• We estimated that approximately 1.7 billion individuals were infected with LTBI in
2014; just under a quarter of the global population.
• If left unaddressed, the current LTBI burden alone will likely prevent achieving the
global TB targets for TB elimination.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• For long-term TB control to be successful, an aggressive approach to LTBI is needed.
• Research and development should focus on developing better tools to identify individu-
als who will benefit from LTBI treatment.
• Estimates would be strengthened by additional empirical data from new population-
based studies of LTBI prevalence.

 Introduction
Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is the precursor to TB disease, which is
responsible for 1.5 million deaths each year—more than any other infectious disease [1]. Once
infected, the individual is at highest risk of developing TB disease within the first two years, but
can remain at risk for their lifetime [2]. The population carrying a latent TB infection (LTBI) is
commonly quoted as “one-third” of the global population, a reservoir of approximately 2.3 bil-
lion individuals [3–6].
As the global community looks to meet ambitious targets for reduction (90% reduction in
TB incidence by 2035) and even elimination of TB (less than 1 incident case per 1,000,000 per
year) by 2050 [7], our ability to address the LTBI reservoir will be critical in our chance to
succeed.
Despite its clear importance to global TB control efforts, the most recent attempt to estimate
the global burden of LTBI was in 1998 [3]. Since then, the size and distribution of the global
population [8] and TB burden [1] has changed dramatically, as has our understanding of prev-
alent disease as a driver of infection [9,10]. Global population growth from around 6 billion in
1998 to over 7 billion in 2014 has been mainly driven by areas with the highest TB burden,
such as Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1,8]. The previous estimation method relied
on a fixed relationship between TB burden to the annual risk of acquiring LTBI, the so-called
“Styblo rule” [3]. Since then, two groups have shown this long-held rule of thumb substantially
overestimates infection risk in modern populations [9,10].
Given these changes and the drive towards eliminating TB [7,11], an updated estimate of
the global burden of LTBI that incorporates the available data and applies current scientific
insights is urgently needed [4,12].
An updated estimate of the size and distribution of the LTBI reservoir should also address
questions about the likely contribution of LTBI to TB disease over the coming decades. Specifi-
cally, how many active TB cases would arise from the currently infected individuals alone if all
transmission was halted now? Updated LTBI burden estimates also indicate the population in
need of interventions and new tools, thus catalyzing new research and potential investment
from commercial partners in, for example, vaccines, and tools for the diagnosis and treatment
of LTBI [4].
Critical questions include the number of those with LTBI at highest risk of developing dis-
ease, i.e., those infected within the past 2 y [12]. This population is a focus of proposed “test
and treat” strategies in TB, which would use an RNA expression profile test to identify individ-
uals most likely to develop TB [13], improving on the low predictive value of existing tests for
LTBI [14]. As resistance to TB drugs is rising, an estimate of the proportion of LTBI that
involves isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains is important, since INH remains the cornerstone of
most treatment regimens for LTBI [4]. Finally, as TB becomes rarer, the epidemiologyof LTBI
will have a renewed and increasing importance for monitoring the progress of control efforts.
In this paper, we estimate the global burden of LTBI and its distribution by country, geo-
graphical region, and age group. We also estimate the number of recent infections and the
number of recent infections with INH-resistant strains. Finally, we predict the TB incidence in
2035 and 2050 solely due to the existing LTBI reservoir.
Methods
To estimate the burden of LTBI, we reconstructed country trends in annual risk of M.tb infec-
tion (ARI) and combined these historical projections with demographic data to estimate bur-
den of recent and all-time infection by age. ARI trends were modelled for 168 countries

 (comprising >99.9% of the world population) using a flexible non-parametric regression
framework accounting for measurement uncertainty and applied to two sources of data.
The first source of data was direct estimates of ARI from tuberculin skin test (TST) surveys.
We abstracted data on estimated ARI, survey sample size, and mean age for 100 country-years
in 24 countries from Cauthen et al. [15] and undertook a systematic review of nationally repre-
sentative ARI estimates in the years 1990–2014 (see Methods and Figure A in S1 Text), yielding
further data on 31 country-years in 19 countries, to give a total of 37 unique countries with
TST survey data. Historically, ARIs have been estimated from TST surveys without presenta-
tion of uncertainty. In the Methods section of S1 Text, we show how sample size and mean age
can be used to approximately and conservatively quantify measurement precision. We used
this method for studies not stating ARI estimate precision.
The second source of data was indirect: combining WHO estimates of TB prevalence (5,373
country-years for 218 countries) with an uncertain representation of the revised Styblo ratio
that accounts for uncertainty and relates the prevalence of smear positive disease to ARI
[1,9,10]. A previously published study of childhood tuberculosis [16] characterized this ratio in
the modern era by fitting a log-normal distribution to data from reviews of studies in which
both ARI and prevalence estimates were available [9,10]. To estimate the proportion of preva-
lent TB that is smear positive for each country, we averaged estimates of smear positivity for
0–4, 5–14, and �15 y age groups from a recent systematic review [17] against the proportion of
cases in these age-groups calculated using the model of Dodd et al. [16]. To calculate the
impact of HIV on the proportion of TB in a country that is smear positive, we first calculated
the fraction of prevalent TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV) by adjusting the WHO esti-
mates of HIV prevalence in incident TB for each year using estimates of the duration of preva-
lence in PLHIV and HIV-uninfected individuals [1]. The mean smear positivity of HIV-TB
was then reduced by a fraction reported in Corbett et al. [18]. The uncertainty of each ingredi-
ent in these ARI calculations was propagated using the delta method. More details are
describedin the Methods section of S1 Text.
Gaussian process regression with a linear trend was applied to the data on ARI (on a log
scale), using the measurement precision calculated for each data point. This implicitly com-
bines the data feeding into WHO prevalence estimates (and Styblo ratio) and the TST data
feeding into ARI estimates, with the assumption of a normal approximation to the likelihood.
A sensitivity analysis re-analysed these data with a constant rather than linear trend assump-
tion. To allow a comparison with the 1998 estimate, we assumed a constant ARI before 1934.
For each country, 200 simulated ARI trajectories from 1934 to 2014 were used to compute the
cumulative hazard of infection for individuals by age. The cumulative hazard was converted into a
probability of infection and combined with UN Population Division estimates of country demog-
raphy in 2014 to give our estimates of all-time infection.We computed the probability of infection
for the first time within 2 y, using the cumulative hazard up to 2012 to calculate the fraction at
each age who had escaped infection until then, and the cumulative hazard from 2012 to 2014 to
calculate the fraction of these who were then infected. To calculate the fraction of those at a given
age infected or re-infected during the last 2 y, we introduced a beta distribution characterizing an
uncertain partial protection against re-infection of 79% (70%–86%) from Andrews et al. [19]. See
the Methods section of S1 Text for details. As estimates of protection have varied [20,21], we con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis using a protection of 50% with the same variance. Estimates of infec-
tion prevalence were summarized by region, age, and medians mapped by country.
To calculate the number of infections within the last 2 y with resistance to isoniazid, we
combined our estimates of infection within 2 y in each country with a recent analysis of the
proportion of new infections in each country that are isoniazid-resistance using data from the
Global Project on Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance at WHO [22]. This

 proportion was treated as uncertain and sampled from the output of this analysis. A conceptual
overview diagram for the methods is presented in Figure R in S1 Text.
Finally, we estimated the regional prevalence of latent infection in 2035 and 2050 under the
assumption of no M.tb transmission after 2014, using UN Population Division demographic
projections, and calculated the likely implications of existing M.tb infections for future TB inci-
dence, assuming a 0.15% per year remote activation rate [21,23,24].
Results are reported as medians together with 95% uncertainty intervals (95% UI), calcu-
lated as the 2.5% to 97.5% percentile range. No specific funding was received for this work.
Results
ARI Estimates
The ARI estimates from TST surveys were comparable with the ARI estimates from WHO TB
prevalence estimates via the updated Styblo rule and typically did not exhibit discontinuities
(Figures C–H in S1 Text). Fig 1 shows the results for the WHO Southeast Asia region. Fig 1
also illustrates uncertainty increasing at earlier times, away from data.

 LTBI Prevalence on Global, Regional, and Country Level
We estimate a global prevalence of latent M.tb infection in 2014 of 23.0% (95% UI: 20.4%–
26.4%) (Table 1). This amounts to an estimate for the worldwide prevalence of M.tb infection
of 1.7 billion (95% UI: 1.5 billion–1.9 billion) in 2014 (Table 2). Fig 2 highlights the substantial
regional and sub-regional variation in LTBI prevalence. The WHO Southeast Asia, Western
Pacific, and Africa regions were all estimated to have LTBI prevalence in the general population
of above around 20% (see first column of Table 1), whereas the WHO Eastern-Mediterranean,
Europe, and Americas regions all had general population LTBI prevalence of below 17%. The
large populations and high proportion infected imply that around 80% of the number of people
with latent infection are in the WHO Southeast Asia, Western Pacific, and Africa regions, com-
pared to 65% of the total population. On the country level, China and India had the highest
LTBI burden, approximately 350 million infections, followed by Indonesia at around 120 mil-
lion infections and fewer than 60 million infections in all other countries. The USA had the
20th highest burden, at an estimated 13 million (Figure J in S1 Text).
Age Trends
The proportions of each age group infected by region are shown in Fig 3, and column 2 in
Table 2 shows the percentage of all LTBI in children under 15 y old. While around 6% of M.tb
infections are in children globally, 13% of infections in Africa are in children, compared to 2%
in the Americas. In all regions, the proportion infected rises with age and, with the exception of
the WHO Europe and Americas regions, exceeds 50% in the oldest age groups. The substantial
increases in TB burden in Africa and Southeast Asia are reflected in the shape of Fig 3, with
more rapid increases in the younger age groups compared to other regions. Uncertainty in
these proportions is largest for the Western Pacific region, particularly in older age groups, due
to larger uncertainty in historical ARIs there.
Recent Infection and Isoniazid Resistance
Around 1% of the global population, approximately 56 million individuals, was infected within
the last 2 y and would therefore be at appreciable risk of progressing to active TB (see Tables 1
and 2). Of these recent infections, the vast majority are infections for the first time; however,
this, too, varies by age (Figure J in S1 Text). We estimate that around 11% of these recent

 Current Burden of LTBI and End TB Strategy Targets
If we assume no ongoing transmission from 2015 onwards, our projections of current LTBI
burden imply that in 2035, 961 (95% UI: 870–1,113) million individuals would still be infected
(around 11% of the population). By 2050, these numbers would be 599 (95% UI: 557–668) mil-
lion (around 6%). Assuming a remote LTBI activation rate of 0.15% per year, this implies a TB

 disease incidence from these latent pools of 16.5 (95% UI: 14.9–19.2) per 100,000 per year in
2035, which is above the 10 per 100,000 per year target in the End TB Strategy. In 2050, the
rate would be 8.3 (95% UI: 8.6–10.6) per 100,000 per year; nearly two orders of magnitude
higher than the 2050 elimination target of 1 per million per year.
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analysis assuming constant trends in the Gaussian process regression (Figures L–Q
in S1 Text) led to smaller estimates of LTBI burden due to lower extrapolated ARIs at earlier
times. In general, estimates in prevalence were around 20% lower with this assumption, giving
global estimates of 18.5% (95% UI: 17.0%–20.7%) LTBI prevalence or 1.3 (95%UI: 1.2–1.5) bil-
lion infected individuals. Considering a lower protection against reinfection of 50% made little
difference to overall numbers but resulted in more recent infections at older age groups (see
Tables A–D and Figure Q in S1 Text). Applying our method to estimate the population in 1997
yielded an LTBI prevalence of 26.9% (95% UI: 22.4%–32.7%).
Discussion
The global burden of LTBI is just under a quarter of the population—around 1.7 billion indi-
viduals—with substantial geographical and age variation. We estimate 56 million people are at
high risk of developing TB disease because of a recent (re-)infection, 11% of whom are carrying
an isoniazid-resistant strain. With reasonable assumptions for reactivation risks, incident TB
disease arising from the 2014 LTBI reservoir alone would prohibit reaching the 2035 and 2050
End TB Strategy goals.
Using our method to calculate LTBI prevalence in 1997 yielded 27%, suggesting the differ-
ence between our estimate for 2014 and the 1997 estimate [3] is mainly due to changes in
methodology, including the revised Styblo rule [9,10]. Our results also matched a recent sur-
vey-based estimate of 13 million latent infections for the United States [25].
One limitation of this study was that we were not able to consider the effects due to different
tuberculin strains and cut-off choices for TST tests or the potential impact of BCG vaccination
on these test outcomes. Recent work has suggested that LTBI may be a dynamic and heteroge-
neous state [12] and highlighted the difference between M.tb infection and positive tests for
infection. Our work does not make this distinction but is in line with literature relating TB
prevalence to infection risk and risks of progression to disease. In addition, we assumed lifelong
LTBI in common with previous estimates and consistent with observation [2]. While it may be
biologically plausible that some individuals clear their LTBI in absence of treatment, there is no
published evidence to support a separate model scenario.
Our approach to quantifying the typical infectiousness of prevalent TB cases by country
entailed some necessary simplifications. Notably, we assumed the same TB case-detectionrate
applied independent of HIV status and anti-retroviral treatment status. However, these
assumptions had relatively little influence on ARI estimates and their uncertainty (see S1 Text,
page 8), with the dominant contributions to uncertainty coming from the TB prevalence esti-
mates themselves and uncertainty in the Styblo ratio. We also assumed that the same ARI
applied to all individuals in a country and neglected migration between countries.
A major strength of this study is its treatment of uncertainty. We were able to characterize
and include measurement precision for data on ARI derived from TST surveys as well as indi-
rectly from prevalence estimates. While uncertainty in ARI estimates grew substantially for the
earliest years, the number of people alive today who were alive then was small, limiting the
impact of this uncertainty on our overall estimate. This also limited the impact of our assump-
tion of linear trends extrapolating backward from data; our very conservative assumption of

 flat trends resulted in less than a five-percentage-point difference in our overall prevalence
estimate.
Our estimate of TB incidence in 2035 and 2050 from currently existing LTBI uses a sin-
gle reactivation rate. This parameter has been estimated at widely varying levels, [23,24,26],
and we have not attempted to include potential geographic heterogeneity or anticipate
trends due to changes in population health, for example, through achievements of the Sus-
tainable Development Goals (SDG) [27] or due to cohort aging. However, our estimates of
TB disease incidence in 2035 and 2050 are proportional to this parameter, and even large
reductions do not alter the conclusion that incidence will exceed the 2050 elimination
target.
It is a limitation that there were not more recent direct national estimates of ARI, which
would have strengthened our estimates. More empirical data on the epidemiology of LTBI,
including from the use of modern tests that are less prone to biases of interpretation and cross-
reaction [28], should improve our understanding of these features and generate more data
upon which to base estimates. As active TB becomes rarer, surveys of infection will become an
increasingly appealing option for monitoring trends, but this relies on understanding the rela-
tionship between infection and other burden metrics.
Policies to address the LTBI reservoir have to balance the potential of harm versus the bene-
fit for the individual [29]. In the current landscape of diagnostic tools, WHO recommends
LTBI testing and treatment only in high-risk groups, such as people living with HIV, and close
contacts of TB cases. While these guidelines are sensible, it is clear that a more aggressive
approach is needed to reduce the threat to long-term TB control targets stemming from a LTBI
reservoir of approximately 1.7 billion individuals. Future work with this model could inform
current policies by estimating the burden of LTBI in specific risk groups, such as people living
with HIV or diabetes. A test to more precisely identify those at substantial risk of progressing
to disease could enable targeted LTBI treatment beyond known risk groups [12]. Emerging
tests based on RNA signatures may come to provide a more practicable method of identifying
individuals for LTBI treatment [13]. Among biomedical interventions, a vaccine that prevents
progression to disease from LTBI could make a major contribution, depending on global avail-
ability [30]. Beyond the biomedical perspective, improvements in social and economic condi-
tions globally have been associated with reductions in TB burden in historic and contemporary
contexts [31,32], and could also contribute to reducing the TB burden originating from the
LTBI reservoir.
Treatment for LTBI still relies heavily on isoniazid, either as monotherapy or as part of a
combination regimen [4,11]. We found that just under 11% of all recent M.tb infections are
likely to be isoniazid resistant, with much higher rates in some regions, and this proportion is
likely to increase. While less common, rifampicin resistance also has the potential to threaten
the usefulness of rifampicin-containing prophylactic regimens. New treatments that bypass the
rising resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin are needed to fully operationalise interventions to
test and treat LTBI.
Conclusion
We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion individuals were latently infected with M.tb
globally in 2014, just under a quarter of the global population. Investment in new tools to
improve diagnosis and treatment of those with LTBI at risk of progressing to disease is
urgently needed to address this latent reservoir if the TB community is to reach the 2050
target of eliminating TB.
