ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Genetic variations in dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1 or dysbindin-1) have been implicated
as risk factors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The encoded protein dysbindin-1 functions in the regulation of
synaptic activity and synapse development. Intriguingly, a loss of function mutation in Dtnbp1 in mice disrupted both
glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic transmission in the cerebral cortex; pyramidal neurons displayed
enhanced excitability due to reductions in inhibitory synaptic inputs. However, the mechanism by which reduced
dysbindin-1 activity causes inhibitory synaptic deficits remains unknown.
METHODS: We investigated the role of dysbindin-1 in the exocytosis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
from cortical excitatory neurons, organotypic brain slices, and acute slices from dysbindin-1 mutant mice and
determined how this change in BDNF exocytosis transsynaptically affected the number of inhibitory synapses
formed on excitatory neurons via whole-cell recordings, immunohistochemistry, and live-cell imaging using total
internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: A decrease in dysbindin-1 reduces the exocytosis of BDNF from cortical excitatory neurons, and this
reduction in BDNF exocytosis transsynaptically resulted in reduced inhibitory synapse numbers formed on excitatory
neurons. Furthermore, application of exogenous BDNF rescued the inhibitory synaptic deficits caused by the
reduced dysbindin-1 level in both cultured cortical neurons and slice cultures.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrate that these two genes linked to risk for schizophrenia (BDNF
and dysbindin-1) function together to regulate interneuron development and cortical network activity. This evidence
supports the investigation of the association between dysbindin-1 and BDNF in humans with schizophrenia.

In the mammalian central nervous system, neurons receive
inhibitory synaptic inputs from gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA)ergic interneurons and excitatory inputs from glutama-
tergic neurons (1,2). Converging experimental and clinical
evidence
suggests
that
the
dysfunction
of
appropriate
GABAergic inhibition and the consequent imbalance between
excitation and inhibition in the cerebral cortex underlie the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric
disorder with lifetime morbid risk close to 1% of the general
population (3–5). For example, in the neocortex of schizophre-
nia patients, the activity of the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is reduced (6). This finding
has been repeatedly confirmed and extended in subsequent
studies that showed alterations in several presynaptic and
postsynaptic components of the GABAergic system (7).
Dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1 or dysbindin-1),
which encodes dysbindin-1, has been implicated in several
studies as a potential susceptibility gene for schizophrenia
(8–11). In schizophrenia, dysbindin-1 expression has been
reported to be reduced in cortical and limbic neurons,
suggesting that reduced dysbindin-1 protein levels may be a
disease-related trait (11–15). In mice, a loss-of-function muta-
tion in Dtnbp1 (dys-MT) disrupts both glutamatergic and
GABAergic transmission in the prefrontal cortex, and this
disruption
is
associated
with
working
memory
deficits
(16–21). Most importantly, in dys-MT mice, cortical pyramidal
neurons in the prefrontal cortex display enhanced excitability,
presumably due to a reduction in GABAergic signaling (19–21).
The mechanism underlying the loss of inhibitory activity in dys-
MT mice remains unclear because dysbindin-1 expression is

 largely restricted to excitatory neurons rather than interneur-
ons (13,22).
In this study, we discovered an unexpected role of
dysbindin-1 in the exocytosis of brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), an important trophic factor for the differentia-
tion and survival of inhibitory neurons from excitatory neurons
(23). We further determined that this reduction in BDNF
secretion reduces the number of functional GABAergic syn-
apses that are transneuronally formed on excitatory neurons
(24). Given that interneurons cannot synthesize BDNF by
themselves but require BDNF for the formation and main-
tenance of their synapses (25–27), our results demonstrate
that these two well-known schizophrenia susceptibility gene
products (BDNF and dysbindin-1) function together to regulate
interneuron synapse development. Furthermore, our results
provide considerable insight into the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that regulate the development of the neural
circuitry in the brain and link these abnormalities in BDNF
secretion to cognitive disease.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
A detailed description of the experimental procedures can be
found in the Supplement. All animal experiments in this study
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Duke-National University of Singapore
Graduate Medical School and the Lieber Institute for Brain
Development.
Cell Culture
Cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 rat
embryos and cultured in Neurobasal medium with B27 supple-
ment (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). At day-in-vitro (DIV) 7,
cultures were transfected with a calcium phosphate trans-
fection kit (Clontech, Madison, Wisconsin). Human embryonic
kidney 293 cells and PC12 cells were maintained using
standard protocols and were transfected with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen).
Molecular Biology
Dysbindin-1 and scrambled short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were
generated using pLentilox 3.7 vector. Dysbindin-1 shRNA
target sequences were conserved in both mouse and rat
dysbindin-1A and C isoforms. pCAG-MCS2-myc-dysbindin-1
was generated as reported previously (28), and the shRNA-
resistant mutant of dysbindin-1 was generated by polymerase
chain reaction-based mutagenesis.
Fluorescent Immunocytochemistry
Cultured rat neurons and mouse brain slices (postnatal day [P]
28) were stained with various primary antibodies, followed by
incubation with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secon-
dary antibodies and imaged. Detailed antibody information
can be found in the Supplement.
Imaging
Images were acquired with an LSM 710 (Zeiss, Singapore)
confocal microscope using either 403 or 633 oil objectives
and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy imaging
was conducted as previously reported (29).
Electrophysiology
Cortical neurons were transfected with various constructs as
previously described (29). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings
were performed on DIV14 to DIV15 neurons. For acute slice
recording, wild-type and dys-MT male mice at P15 to P35
were used as previously described (21).
Statistical Analysis
Unless otherwise stated, error bars represent the standard
error of the mean. All statistical analyses are listed in the
Supplement.
RESULTS
Increased Excitatory Synaptic Transmission in Layer
2/3 Pyramidal Neurons in the Prefrontal Cortex of
dys-MT Mice
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a brain structure that is known to
play a critical role in executive function and is prominently
implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (21). In the
PFC, top-down information is transmitted via pathways from
layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons to pyramidal neurons in L5,
which is a major corticofugal output layer of the PFC network.
We characterized the synaptic properties of L2/3 pyramidal
neurons within the prelimbic area (PrL), homologous to the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in primates, by measuring spon-
taneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) using
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (Figure 1A, B) (20). Intrigu-
ingly, we found that dys-MT mice exhibited a dramatic
increase in the frequency of the sEPSCs that were recorded
from L2/3 pyramidal cells, without changing the amplitude
(WT: 2.69 6 .62 Hz, 10.50 6 .29 pA; dys-MT: 6.65 6 1.50 Hz,
10.99 6 1.25 pA; p , .05) (Figure 1C, D). These results
indicate an increase in excitatory synaptic transmission in the
PFC of dys-MT mice.
Previous reports suggested that the decreased excitability of
interneurons and decreased inhibitory transmission onto pyr-
amidal neurons partially account for the increased frequency of
sEPSCs in the PFC of dys-MT mice (20). To test this further, we
monitored spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic cur-
rents (mIPSCs) in L2/3 pyramidal neurons within PrL. In the
presence of glutamatergic antagonists and sodium channel
blockers, we observed significant reduction in the frequency of
mIPSCs (WT: 5.23 6 .30 Hz; dys-MT: 4.29 6 .27 Hz; p , .05)
(Figure 1E, F). However, no change in mIPSC amplitude was
detected in PrL of dys-MT mice (WT: 22.19 6 1.98 pA; dys-MT:
18.31 6 1.32 pA) (Figure 1E, G). Intriguingly, immunocytochem-
istry revealed that the density (WT: 1.52 6 .08 per 10 μm2; dys-
MT: 1.24 6 .04 per 10 μm2; p , .01) and size (WT: 1.46 6 .05
μm2; dys-MT: 1.33 6 .04 μm2; p , .05) of vesicular GABA
transporter (VGAT) (an inhibitory presynaptic marker)-express-
ing boutons, which represent GABAergic inhibitory synaptic
terminals, in the L2/3 within the PrL of dys-MT mice were
reduced significantly, indicating the reduced inhibitory inputs
onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Supplemental Figure S1).

 Reduced Inhibitory Synapse Number in Cultured
Cortical Excitatory Neurons Upon Dysbindin-1
Knockdown
Our results indicated that decreased inhibitory synaptic trans-
mission onto pyramidal neurons in the PrL of dys-MT mice
might result in increased network activity. However, it remains
unclear how the loss of dysbindin-1 results in these changes.
First,
we
investigated
whether
the loss
of
endogenous
dysbindin-1 in either pyramidal neurons or inhibitory neurons
affects inhibitory synaptic input. To that end, we used
dissociated cultured cortical neurons and generated a series
of bicistronic lentiviral constructs expressing shRNAs together
with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). The expres-
sion of a specific shRNA construct targeting rat and mouse
dysbindin-1 (dys-shRNA) reduced the expression of recombi-
nant dysbindin-1 to approximately 52% of control levels in
human embryonic kidney cells and reduced the expression
levels of endogenous dysbindin-1 in cultured cortical neurons
to 48% (Supplemental Figure S2). Cultured cortical neurons
were transfected with either scrambled (scr) shRNA or dys-
shRNA and were subsequently immunostained against VGAT
(Figure 2A). We restricted our analysis to excitatory neurons
identified based on somatic morphology as well as a calcium/
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II reporter-driven, lenti-
viral probe that specifically labels glutamatergic excitatory
neurons (Supplemental Figure S3) (30). The knockdown of
dysbindin-1 significantly reduced the inhibitory synapse den-
sity, as assessed using the number of VGAT-positive clusters
compared with neurons transfected with scrambled shRNA
(scr: .151 6 .018 boutons/μm; dys-shRNA: .081 6 .011
boutons/μm; p , .01) (Figure 2A, B). Moreover, we analyzed
the number of inhibitory synapses using another inhibitory
presynaptic marker, GAD65/67, and we found a similar
reduction in synapses from dys-shRNA transfected neurons
(scr: .145 6 .017 boutons/μm; dys-shRNA: .082 6 .016
boutons/μm; p , .01) (Supplemental Figure S4). To further
confirm the specificity of the shRNA experiments, we per-
formed a rescue experiment using an shRNA-resistant form of

 dysbindin-1 (dys-R) that harbors four silent mutations within
the sequence targeted by the shRNA (Supplemental Figures
S2A and S2B). Western blot analysis confirmed the resistance
of dys-R to dys-shRNA in vitro (Supplemental Figures S2A
and S2B). The effect of dysbindin-1 knockdown on the density
of inhibitory synapses was rescued by the co-expression of
dys-R
(dys-shRNA

(Figure 2A, B). These data indicate that dysbindin-1 knock-
down in excitatory neurons reduces the number of inhibitory
synapses formed.
Given the reduction in the number of inhibitory synapses
due to dysbindin-1 knockdown in the excitatory neurons, we
recorded mIPSCs via whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of
cortical pyramidal neurons that were transfected with either
scr or dys-shRNA. The neurons expressing dys-shRNA dis-
played a significant reduction in the frequency (but not the
amplitude)
of
the
mIPSCs
compared
with
the
neurons
expressing scr (scr: 1.38 6 .25 Hz, 42.6 6 3.9 pA; dys-shRNA:
.78 6 .07 Hz, 45.2 6 2.1 pA; p , .01) (Figure 2C–E). This
reduction in the mIPSC frequency was restored by co-
expressing dys-R (dys-shRNA 1 dys-R: 1.41 6 .13 Hz, 47.1
6 3.8 pA; p 5 .59) (Figure 2C–E). Taken together, our data
strongly indicate that endogenously expressed dysbindin-1 in
excitatory neurons regulates the number of inhibitory synaptic
inputs.
To unequivocally rule out any effect of the endogenously
expressed dybsindin-1 in interneurons, we performed two
additional sets of experiments. First, we used a bicistronic
construct expressing only GFP in the interneurons using the
GAD65 promoter and analyzed the complexity, length, and
branch numbers of the dendrites. We found no significant
difference between the groups (Supplemental Figures S5A
and S5B). Additionally, the loss of dysbindin-1 expression
from interneurons did not affect the density of their presynap-
tic GABA-containing synaptic vesicles as evaluated with
GAD67 immunostaining (Supplemental Figure S5C and S5D).
Together,
these
results
indicate
that
the
reduction
in
dysbindin-1 expression in interneurons did not change mor-
phology or the number of GABA-containing vesicles.
Reduced BDNF Secretion in Neurons Upon
Dysbindin-1 Knockdown
We observed that dysbindin-1 knockdown in excitatory neu-
rons reduced the number of inhibitory synapses on the
excitatory neurons. What mediates this transneuronal modu-
lation? Recent studies have shown that dysbindin-1 interacts
with and regulates the trafficking and exocytosis of secretory
vesicles (31–33). Therefore, we hypothesized that dysbindin-1
knockdown impaired the release from excitatory neurons of a

 trophic factor that is critical for interneuron synapse develop-
ment and/or formation on excitatory neurons. Intriguingly,
BDNF may represent the only trophic factor that is a plausible
candidate for this transneuronal activity (25,34). First, gene
ablation studies have shown that signaling mediated by BDNF
and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), a cognate receptor
of BDNF, regulates inhibitory synapse formation and the
maturation of inhibitory neurons in the cortex. Furthermore,
BDNF knockdown in an individual excitatory neuron in the
cerebral cortex results in a reduction in inhibitory synapses on
that neuron (27). However, inhibitory neurons must rely on the
BDNF that is secreted from excitatory neurons because
inhibitory neurons do not express BDNF messenger RNA
(35). Based on these findings, we sought to determine whether
dysbindin-1 knockdown in cortical pyramidal neurons reduces
BDNF secretion.
First, we monitored the cellular localization of dysbindin-1
with respect to BDNF in neurons. In cortical neurons, GFP-
tagged dysbindin-1 puncta co-localized with TdTomato-tagged
BDNF signals, which were also overlapped with immunoreac-
tivity of chromogranin B, a marker protein for large-dense core
vesicles (LDCVs) (Supplemental Figure S6). We next examined
the temporal and spatial relationship between dysbindin-1 and
BDNF within neurons using confocal live-cell imaging. Live-cell
imaging revealed that punctate spots of GFP-dysbindin-1
traveled together with TdTomato-BDNF-harboring
vesicles
along the dendrite (Movie S1) as well as an axon (Movie S2)
in cortical neurons. These data suggested a potential role of
dysbindin-1 in regulating the trafficking and exocytosis of BDNF
secretory vesicles.
Next, to directly visualize BDNF secretion from neurons, we
took advantage of a pH-sensitive variant of EGFP (super-
ecliptic pHluorin [SEP]), the fluorescence of which is quenched
at low pH, and we fused this SEP to the C-terminal end of
BDNF (BDNF-SEP) (Figure 3A) (36). The distribution of BDNF-
SEP, as revealed via co-immunostaining for EGFP, SMI312 (an
axonal marker), and microtubule-associated protein 2 (a
dendritic marker), was similar to that of endogenous BDNF
stained with a BDNF-specific antibody, displaying punctate
expression patterns in axons, dendrites, and cell bodies
(Supplemental Figure S7). The neuronal processes that were
not stained with the microtubule-associated protein 2 antibody
were further confirmed to be axons; these processes were co-
immunostained with an antibody against the axon-specific
microtubule-associated protein SMI312 (Supplemental Figure
S7). Reconstructed images in the axial plane of an axon, a
dendrite, and a soma further supported the granular nature of
the punctate fluorescent staining (Figure 3B), as is consistent
with previous reports (Supplemental Figure S7).
To detect BDNF secretion via exocytosis, we performed
time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence imaging, which
enables the selective excitation of fluorophores in the evan-
escent field above the cover glass (#100 nm) (29,37). When
expressed in cultured cortical neurons, BDNF-SEP puncta
were sparsely distributed in axons, dendrites, and cell bodies
(Figure 3B). Bath application of ammonium chloride solution
(50 mmol/L, pH 7.4) (38), which deacidifies the vesicular lumen
and thereby unquenches BDNF-SEP, resulted in a marked
increase in the fluorescence intensity of each punctum
and
revealed
many
BDNF-SEP
puncta
in
each
neuron
(Supplemental Figure S8), suggesting that BDNF-SEP was
quenched in a majority of the vesicles.
Next, we monitored the activity-induced exocytosis of BDNF-
SEP-containing vesicles in cultured cortical neurons by applying
a high concentration of potassium ions (K1) (60 mmol/L) to
depolarize the neurons. Before high K1 stimulation, we detected
discrete, randomly appearing puncta of BDNF-SEP fluorescence
(Figure 3B). These randomly appearing BDNF-SEP puncta
indicated spontaneous neuronal BDNF exocytosis (39). After high
K1
treatment,
BDNF-SEP
fluorescence
was
significantly
increased in the control neurons (Figure 3B; Movie S3). Addition-
ally, the high K1 treatment increased the number of BDNF
exocytotic events, as quantified by the appearance of new
fluorescent puncta at the cell surface (Figure 3C). In contrast,
the increase in the number and intensity of BDNF-SEP puncta
induced by high K1 treatment was dramatically reduced in
neurons expressing dys-shRNA (Figure 3C). Additionally, we
monitored the activity-dependent exocytosis of BDNF-SEP in
PC12 cells and found that expressing dys-shRNA markedly
reduced BDNF-SEP exocytosis (Figure 3D, E). Taken together,
these data suggest that dysbindin-1 knockdown reduces activity-
dependent BDNF secretion from neurons.
BDNF Application Rescues Dysbindin-1 shRNA-
Mediated Inhibitory Synapse Defects
The reduction in BDNF secretion from dysbindin-1 knockdown
neurons suggested that BDNF could act as a crucial trophic
factor in regulating the formation and/or maintenance of
interneuron synapses. If this hypothesis were correct, the
application of exogenous BDNF would rescue the reduced
numbers of inhibitory synapses detected in cortical neurons
after dysbindin-1 knockdown.
To test this hypothesis, we exogenously applied recombi-
nant BDNF (100 ng/mL) for 4 days to cortical neurons trans-
fected with either scr or dys-shRNA. Dysbindin-1 knockdown
in excitatory neurons reduced the inhibitory synapse density,
as assessed using the number of VGAT-positive clusters (scr:
.134 6 .024; dys-shRNA: .076 6 .009 boutons/μm) (Figure 4A, B).
Intriguingly, the application of exogenous BDNF rescued this
reduction in the inhibitory synapse density in dys-shRNA-
expressing neurons (BDNF with dys-shRNA: .156 6 .015
boutons/μm; p , .001) (Figure 4A, B). We confirmed this result
using GAD65 immunostaining as an alternative method to
quantify the inhibitory synapse density and found a similar
change (Supplemental Figure S9). To assess the specificity of
this BDNF-mediated effect, we treated dys-shRNA-expressing
neurons with recombinant nerve growth factor (100 ng/mL),
which has multiple synaptic effects (Supplemental Figure S10).
Treatment with nerve growth factor failed to rescue the inhibitory
synapse reduction in dys-shRNA-expressing neurons, indicating
that the rescue of the reduction in inhibitory synapse density in
dysbindin-1 knockdown neurons was specific to BDNF.
To further determine whether exogenous BDNF treatment
rescues the deficits in inhibitory synaptic transmission in dys-
shRNA-expressing neurons, we measured the mIPSCs from
dys-shRNA-expressing neurons treated with either vehicle or
BDNF (100 ng/mL). The application of BDNF (but not of the
vehicle) rescued the reduction in frequency of mIPSCs
recorded
from
dys-shRNA-expressing

that BDNF selectively rescues the reduction in the number of
functional inhibitory synapses in cortical excitatory neurons
induced by dysbindin-1 knockdown.
Rescued Inhibitory Synaptic Transmission Upon
BDNF Application in Ex Vivo Organotypic
Hippocampal Slices
To
investigate
the
effects
of
the
lack
of
endogenous
dysbindin-1 expression on excitatory pyramidal neuron func-
tion ex vivo, we transfected our shRNA constructs into
organotypic hippocampal slices via biolistic gene gun (27).
The transfected neurons were marked with simultaneously
introduced EGFP (Figure 5A). To induce an extremely sparse
distribution of the transfected neurons, steel mesh was
attached to the muzzle of the gene guns (40). Typically, fewer
than 10 EGFP-expressing neurons were detected among the
vast number of neurons within each slice culture (Figure 5A).
Next, we measured the inhibitory synaptic transmission in
hippocampal pyramidal neurons expressing either scr or dys-
shRNA. Analysis of the mIPSCs revealed marked decreases in

DISCUSSION
Since the dysbindin-1 gene was identified, extensive molecular,
cell biological, animal model, and human genotype-phenotype
studies have been conducted to address the multiple functions
and mechanisms of dysbindin-1 activity in the brain. Because
dysbindin-1 is thought to mediate a range of intermediate
phenotypes that underlie schizophrenia (21,41,42), elucidating
the precise biological functions of dysbindin-1 have received
intensive study. Disruption of dysbindin-1 is thought to confer
glutamatergic dysfunction (43). However, in mice, a loss-of-
function mutation in dysbindin-1 (dys-MT) disrupts inhibitory
neurotransmission in both the hippocampus and the prefrontal
cortex (19–21) via an unknown mechanism. In the present
study, we discovered an unexpected role of dysbindin-1 for the
exocytosis of BDNF from excitatory neurons that consequently
transneuronally reduced the number of functional inhibitory
synapses formed on the excitatory neurons.
Dysbindin-1, BDNF, and Their Roles in Inhibitory
Synapse Development
BDNF is a neurotrophic factor that regulates synapse develop-
ment and plasticity in the mammalian brain (44,45). Interestingly,
BDNF regulates the maturation of interneurons, the dysfunction
of which has been associated with schizophrenia (46). For
example, in BDNF knockout mice, the number of interneurons
is significantly reduced compared with that in wild-type mice
(47,48). Conversely, in transgenic mice overexpressing BDNF,
the maturation of interneurons was significantly accelerated; this
effect was accompanied by an increase in spontaneous network
activity (49,50). Similarly, the application of exogenous BDNF to
interneuron cultures resulted in accelerated formation of recip-
rocal connections via enhanced TrkB signaling (51).
Intriguingly, GABAergic interneurons do not express BDNF
messenger RNA and thus cannot produce BDNF themselves
(52). Therefore, from whence do these neurons receive the
BDNF that is necessary for their function? Kohara et al. (26)
reported that in co-cultures of BDNF-KO neurons with GFP-
labeled
wild-type
neurons,
interneurons
receive
BDNF
released from excitatory neurons (26). They later found that
BDNF ablation in a single excitatory neuron induced a local
reduction in the number of inhibitory synapses to that BDNF-
knockout excitatory neuron (27). Likewise, enhanced BDNF
exocytosis in synaptotagmin-IV knockout mice (53,54) and
reduced BDNF exocytosis in calcium-dependent activator
protein for secretion 2 knockout mice have been shown to
result in increased and decreased GABAergic synaptic trans-
mission, respectively (55). These findings suggest that BDNF
(presumably released from excitatory neurons) shapes and

 regulates local inhibitory synapse formation and/or mainte-
nance. Therefore, it is conceivable that any defect in the
cellular and molecular machinery that regulates BDNF traffick-
ing and release from excitatory neurons could affect inhibitory
synapse formation on these excitatory neurons.
Here, we demonstrate that the loss of dysbindin-1 from
cortical excitatory neurons leads to a reduction in functional
inhibitory synapses, as demonstrated previously in the dys-MT
mouse cortex and hippocampus (Figures 1 and 2) (20,21).
However, the loss of dysbindin-1 from inhibitory neurons did
not result in any defects in dendritic morphology or formation of
axonal synaptic boutons (Supplemental Figure S4). This was
potentially due to the lack of expression of dysbindin-1 in
GABAergic neurons (22). Additionally, we show that the impair-
ment in activity-dependent BDNF release from dysbindin-1
knockdown cortical neurons and neuronal cells (Figure 3) and,
intriguingly,
the
inhibitory
synapse
defects
exhibited
by
dysbindin-1 knockdown neurons were rescued by BDNF appli-
cation (Figures 4 and 5). Our data reveal novel transneuronal
signaling between excitatory and inhibitory neurons and provide
new insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that link
these abnormalities in BDNF secretion to psychiatric disorders.
Potential Mechanisms of Reduced BDNF Exocytosis
in Dysbindin-1 Knockdown Neurons
Dysbindin-1A is a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-
related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1) complex, and several
studies have demonstrated that the loss of dysbindin-1 is
accompanied by the loss of all BLOC-1 complex constituents
(11,22,56,57). Although our dysbindin-1 shRNA is designed to
target conserved regions in both dysbindin-1A and dysbindin-
1C isoforms, co-expression of the dysbindin-1A isoform
rescued dysbindin-1 shRNA associated interneuron synaptic
defects, indicating that the dysbindin-1A isoform might affect
BDNF
exocytosis.
Further
rescue
experiments
using
dysbindin-1C isoform or isoform-specific shRNAs may eluci-
date which of the dysbindin-1 isoforms contribute to BDNF
release and transneuronal interneuron synapse maintenance.
In addition, dysbindin-1 and three other subunits of BLOC-1
(pallidin, snapin, and muted) interact with adaptor protein
complex 3 (AP-3) and are also expressed in AP-3-containing
vesicles in neurons (58). AP-3 has generally been considered
to function in endocytic rather than biosynthetic pathways;
however, a recent RNA interference-based screen identified
that AP-3 functions in the formation, trafficking, and regulated
exocytosis of LDCVs, which contain the BDNF that is secreted
from neurons (59). Additionally, the loss of AP-3 affects the
number, morphology, and density of LDCVs in neurons
(59,60). Furthermore, mice lacking the neuronal isoform of
AP-3 (ap-3μ knockout mice) exhibited the reduced inhibitory
neurotransmission and abnormal propagation of neuronal
excitability that were detected in dys-MT mice (61). More
importantly, the BDNF content was reduced in the hippo-
campus of BLOC-1-deficient mice (62). Taken together,

 we speculate that defects in the dysbindin-1 interactome may
impair BDNF release via AP-3-mediated LDCV function, but
this possibility also requires further investigation.
Targeting Interneuron and BDNF/TrkB Signaling for
Treatment of Schizophrenia
Dysbindin-1 protein expression is widely distributed through-
out the brain, but it is concentrated in synapses in brain
regions that are commonly affected in schizophrenia, such as
the hippocampus, the striatum, and the prefrontal cortex (11).
Interestingly, decreases in one or more dysbindin-1 isoforms
have been detected in the cortex and the hippocampus of
schizophrenic patients (11,15,63). Furthermore, dys-MT mice
exhibited behavioral deficits resembling schizophrenia inter-
mediate phenotypes; thus, dys-MT mice represent a good
animal model of schizophrenia.
Impaired synaptic connectivity is a predominant hypothesis
of the pathology of schizophrenia and has been suggested by
the results of human postmortem studies (64). However, there
is insufficient information about the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying this potentially impaired synaptic
connectivity in schizophrenia. It is widely believed that the
impaired synaptic connectivity between GABAergic and glu-
tamatergic neurons may cause network imbalance and the
eventual impairment of brain function that is commonly
observed in schizophrenic patients (4,64–66). Here, we pro-
vide cellular and molecular evidence that interneuron dysfunc-
tion may be the primary cause of the overall synapse deficits
associated with dysfunction of two genes implicated in the
pathophysiology of this illness (67). If these suppositions are
correct, it may be possible to ameliorate the impaired
GABAergic synapse formation and the subsequent synaptic
imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling within
local cortical circuits by enhancing or restoring the levels of
BDNF signaling. Therefore, it will be exciting to evaluate the
ability of BDNF mimetic peptides and small molecules that
enhance BDNF translation (68,69) in an attempt to restore
inhibitory synapse function in dys-MT mice (70).
