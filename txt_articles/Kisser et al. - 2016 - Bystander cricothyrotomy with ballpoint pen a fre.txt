ABSTRACT
Objective In motion pictures and anecdotal reports,
ballpoint pens have been used for life-saving
cricothyroidotomies. The objective of this study was to
examine the widespread belief that ballpoint pens can
perforate the skin and cricothyroid ligament and could
be used as substitute tracheostomy sets in an emergency
setting.
Methods Three different ballpoint pens were examined
regarding their inner diameter, their demountability to
form a cannula and their airflow properties. Ten medical
laypersons were asked to try to puncture the trachea
through the skin and the cricothyroid ligament in 10
fresh cadavers just using the ballpoint pens.
Results Two of three pens had inner diameters of
>3 mm and were both suitable as cannulas in a
tracheotomy. All participants could perforate the skin
with both ballpoint pens. However, almost no one could
penetrate through the cricothyroid ligament or the
ventral wall of the trachea, except for one participant.
He performed the tracheostomy after three attempts in
>5 min with a lot of patience and force.
Conclusions A cricothyroidotomy just with a ballpoint
pen is virtually impossible. First, the airflow resistance in
commercially available ballpoint pens is too high to
produce effective ventilation. Second, the cricothyroid
ligament is too strong to be penetrated by ballpoint
pens.
INTRODUCTION
Acute airway obstruction is a rare but potentially
life-threatening
situation.
In-hospital
techniques
recommended for this situation include tracheos-
tomy, needle cricothyroidotomy and surgical cri-
cothyroidotomy.
In
the
prehospital
setting,
however, none of these techniques may be available
to bystanders, and non-medical objects may need
to be adapted in order to perform cricothyroidot-
omy. There is a lack of literature examining surgical
cricothyroidotomy in the emergency setting,1 2 and
even fewer papers discussing the use of non-
medical equipment.3–5 The ideal substitute must be
readily available, sharp and narrow enough to
puncture the skin and cricoid membrane, wide
enough to allow gas exchange (>3 mm), long
enough to cannulate the cricothyroid membrane
and still allow mouth-to-tube ventilation, rigid
enough not to collapse and it must have low airway
resistance.5
In various motion pictures (ie, SAW6), medical
TV serials (Dr House, Season 4) and internet chat-
rooms, ballpoint pens have been used for a life-
saving cricothyroidotomy. Even some medical text-
books recommend the use of the barrel of a ball-
point pen as a cannula.6 7
However, there is uncertainty about whether it is
possible to perform a cricothyroidotomy and main-
tain gas exchange just with a ballpoint pen.5 The
senior author of this article (KS), an experienced
head and neck surgeon, tried to perform a cri-
cothyroidotomy in a fresh cadaver just with the
MontBlanc pen before the official start of the
study, but could not penetrate the cricothyroid liga-
ment. This study examines a variety of commer-
cially
available
ballpoint
pens
regarding
their
suitability
for cricothyroidotomy
performed
by
bystanders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The primary outcome of the study was to prove
that a bystander cricothyroidotomy just using a
ballpoint pen is possible. In the first step, three dif-
ferent ballpoint pens were chosen and the follow-
ing
parameters
examined:
inner
diameter,
demountability to form a cannula and airflow in
spirometry using the dismantled pen. The follow-
ing three commonly available ballpoint pens were
used (compare figure 1A–C):
▸ Schneider’s K15, made of opaque plastic with
1.3 mm inner diameter
▸ Ritter PEN 01711 Classic, made of opaque
plastic but with a removable metal jacket at the
top
▸ Montblanc Masterpiece Platinum Line Classique
made of black ebony with a removable metal
jacket at the top
The clinical airflow was measured in all three
ballpoint pens by flow spirometry of two healthy
males, 38 years/29 years and two healthy females,
Key messages
What is already known about the subject?
▸ Popular media and even some textbooks have
suggested that a ballpoint pen can be used to
perform a cricothyrotomy. Reports of
improvised cricyothyrotomy in the medical
literature with a pen or other object all involved
the use of a blade first.
What might this study add?
▸ In this study using fresh cadavers, we
demonstrate that a cricothyroidotomy using just
a ballpoint pen is nearly impossible; the pen
cannot penetrate the cricothyroid membrane
without significant damage, and the resistance
to flow in the cannula prevent effective
ventilation.

Body
Plethysmograph (VIASYS Healthcare, Germany). The partici-
pants had to breathe as hard as they could through the
dismantled pen attached to the plethysmograph for 1 min
(figure 2). According to the study of Owens et al,5 a precondi-
tion for the second part of the study was that the ballpoint pen
provided an airflow of >10 L/min. With the remaining ball-
point pens, 10 medical laypersons (lawyers, police men, law
students, preclinical medical students, dentistry students) had
to perform a cricothyroidotomy with one of the pens after ran-
domisation by cards. No cadaver was older than 2 days. All
cadavers were cooled to 8°C (no freezing). Cadavers were
placed supine with their neck exposed. The thyroid cartilage
was palpable in all cadavers by the supervising medical student
(AH), and the researcher of the forensic institute (CB). All par-
ticipants were introduced by the two supervisors to place a cri-
cothyroidotomy under the thyroid cartilage just with the pen
as quickly as they can. Participants were expected to perform
the procedure with no further specific training or advice. Only
the thyroid cartilage was shown to the participants as the
crucial landmark. Procedure time was defined as the time from
when the participant touched the pen until they were happy
with the placement of the pen barrel or the participant aban-
doned the procedure. A methodological workflow diagram is
shown in figure 3.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee (No
336-13). The relatives of the body donors were asked to give
their informed consent. The complete cricothyroidotomy was
recorded on video (a short example is shown in online supple-
mentary video 1). The primary endpoint of the study was a suc-
cessful or failed ventilation at the end. It was determined by the
cadaver’s chest rising in a mouth-to-pen resuscitation with cada-
ver’s closed mouth and nose by the supervisors (figure 4). The

 collateral damage and penetrated tissue were evaluated after-
wards by professional preparation of the larynx by a forensic
medicine specialist.
RESULTS
The Schneider K15 ballpoint pen has a minimum inner diam-
eter of 1.3 mm at the top. The maximum expiratory volume
was 0.58 L/s. The maximum airflow was only 6.8 L/min, which
is not enough for resuscitation. In contrast, the Ritter 01711
Classic Pen and the Montblanc Masterpiece Platinum had
minimum inner diameters of >3 mm and were both suitable as
cannulas in a tracheotomy (table 1).
According to the protocol, the study was continued with the
Ritter Pen and the Montblanc Masterpiece. All participants were
able to perforate the skin with both ballpoint pens; 60% of the
participants performed the cricothyroidotomy too far caudally
and tried to punctuate the trachea through the thyroid gland.
Only 3 out of 10 perforated the skin over the cricoid. However,
none of the participants could penetrate through the cricothyroid
ligament or the ventral wall of the trachea except one, a
25-year-old police man using the Ritter pen. More than 5 min,
three attempts and a lot of patience and force were necessary.
The pen perforated the cricothyroid ligament, damaged the
cricoid cartilage and the tracheal back wall (table 2).
DISCUSSION
In the prehospital setting, standard medical equipment may not
be available immediately. A ballpoint pen might seem suitable to
perform cricothyroidotomy: many people carry one in their
pocket, the extended cartridge inside should be sharp enough to
puncture the skin and cricoid membrane, and the jacket should
be wide enough to allow gas exchange. These theoretical consid-
erations are inspired by motion pictures and legends of heroic
lifesavers. The minimum inner diameter of a pen suitable for
resuscitation should not be <3 mm. This could be confirmed by
the results of our flow spirometric measurements and the study
by Owens et al.5 Sufficient oxygen supply through cannulas of a
smaller inner diameter can only be provided by modern jet ven-
tilation systems, which are not available in the prehospital
bystander situation. In the second part of the study, the ability
of the remaining pens to penetrate the skin and trachea was
tested. In a similar study of Neill and Anderson, nine untrained
doctors and medical students were asked to try performing a
cricothyroidotomy with a scalpel and a dismantled pen in
embalmed cadavers.3 More than 50% were successful without
major vessel injury, but in contrast with our study, the partici-
pants used a blade and the cadavers were embalmed, which
results in an abnormal fixation of the skin and underlying cartil-
age. There is a case report of a ballpoint pen penetrating the
chest of a 7–year-old girl when she fell onto its tip.8 Another

 case report describes a penetrating injury of the cauda equina in
a 10-year-old child who had fallen onto a wooden pencil.9
Jawish and Ponet10 reported on a child with torticollis due to
the retention of a pencil cap that was lodged in the child’s neck
after having pierced the posterior wall of the pharynx. The
Forensic Institute of Adelaide, Australia, could demonstrate the
vulnerability of major neck vessels to ballpoint pens in a pig
model.11 An intentional and targeted penetration of the trachea,
however, does not seem to be comparable to these accidents.
Six of 10 participants tried to puncture the trachea too caudally
via the thyroid gland. Accordingly, the inaccuracy of using land-
mark techniques for reliable cricothyroid membrane identifica-
tion has been shown by Bair and Chima.12 Except for one
participant, no one was able to penetrate the trachea or the
cricothyroid ligament. A police man successfully opened the
trachea, but it took him three attempts and >5 min, which is
too long for a successful resuscitation. Major collateral damage,
like major vessel injury or nerve destruction, could not be
observed.
CONCLUSION
A cricothyroidotomy just with a ballpoint pen is virtually impos-
sible. A skin and ligament incision with another sharp tool (ie,
pocketknife) is necessary first. Then, some ballpoint pens could
be used as a ventilation cannula.
