Aspirin therapy has been shown to be an effective prevention measure to reduce the risk of new or recurring car-
diovascular events. The aim of this study was to provide an epidemiological analysis of low-dose aspirin use for
primary and secondary CVD prevention from 2012 to 2015. Estimates of self-reported low-dose aspirin use for
primary and secondary CVD prevention were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey for the years
2012–2015. Temporal changes in the prevalence of aspirin use for primary and secondary CVD prevention
were assessed using logistic regression. During 2012–2015, 23.3% of respondents self-reported as taking aspirin
for primary CVD prevention, decreasing from 23.7% in 2012 to 21.8% in 2015. Also during this period, 8.4% self-
reported as taking aspirin for secondary CVD prevention, decreasing from 8.9% in 2012 to 8.2% in 2015. Overall,
the prevalence of aspirin use for CVD prevention declined from 32.6% in 2012 to 30.0% in 2015. This study shows
that over 30% of the adult population self-reports as taking low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary CVD pre-
vention. Despite the decline in this prevalence over the previous four years, aspirin therapy remains a highly-uti-
lized means of preventing CVD.

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) produces immense health and eco-
nomic burdens in the United States. CVD is the leading cause of death,
accounting for 30.8% of all deaths in the United States in 2013
(Mozaffarian et al., 2016). For 2011 to 2012, the estimated annual direct
costs for CVD were $193.1 billion. By comparison, cancer, the second
leading cause of death, had an estimated direct cost of $88.7 billion.
CVD also accounted for an additional $123.5 billion in indirect costs
from lost future productivity, bringing the total attributable cost to
$316.6 billion (Mozaffarian et al., 2016).
Aspirin is one of the oldest drugs in use, dating back to the times of
the ancient Greeks when the bark of the willow tree became known
for its anti-inflammatory properties. Acetylsalicylic acid, the modern
version of aspirin, has been in constant use since being introduced to
the public in 1904 (Ittaman et al., 2014; Fuster and Sweeny, 2011).
Later studies demonstrated the anti-thrombotic effects of low-dose as-
pirin regimens (Miner and Hoffhines, 2007).
Aspirin has been shown to be effective as a preventive therapy
among patients at risk of developing CVD (primary prevention) as
well as among patients who suffer from one or more CVD events (sec-
ondary prevention) (Baigent et al., 2009). The United States Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends low-dose aspirin
use for primary CVD prevention (Bibbins-Domingo and US Preventive
Services Task Force, 2016) and the American Heart Association and
American College of Cardiology Foundation jointly recommend low-
dose aspirin use for secondary CVD prevention (Smith et al., 2011).
Previous cross-sectional studies have examined the use of aspirin
use for CVD prevention (Mainous et al., 2014; Fang et al., 2015), though
to our knowledge there are no existing studies that have utilized multi-
ple years of data to examine possible trends in the epidemiology of as-
pirin and CVD prevention. The aim of this study was to provide an
accurate and up-to-date epidemiological analysis of the use of low-
dose aspirin for both primary and secondary CVD prevention from
2012 to 2015.
2. Methods
This study utilized data from the 2012–2015 National Health Inter-
view Survey (NHIS), one of the major data collection programs of the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) which is part of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The NHIS is the principal
source of information on a broad range of health topics for the civilian
noninstitutionalized population and has been conducted continuously
since 1957. The sampling plan follows a multistage area probability de-
sign that permits the representative sampling of households and

 noninstitutional group quarters (National Center for Health Statistics,
2016). The NHIS Core questions remain largely unchanged from year
to year, allowing for trends analysis or for data from more than one
year to be pooled to increase sample size for analytic purposes
(National Center for Health Statistics, 2016). The current study focuses
on adults aged 40 years and older, because no aspirin-use questions
were asked to participants under the age of 40.
All adults over 40 were asked if a doctor or other health professional
had ever recommended that they take low-dose aspirin to prevent or
control heart disease. Those who answered “yes” were asked if they
were currently following this advice. Participants who did not confirm
that a doctor had recommended they take aspirin were asked if they
were taking aspirin on their own to prevent or control heart disease.
Adults with CVD were defined as those who self-reported as having
ever been told that they had at least one of: coronary heart disease, an-
gina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Individuals who self-re-
ported as currently taking aspirin but did not self-report as having any
of the four CVDs were classified as taking aspirin for primary CVD pre-
vention. Those who self-reported as currently taking aspirin as well as
having had at least one of the CVDs were classified as taking aspirin
for secondary CVD prevention.
For trend analyses, age was classified as three groups: 40–49 years,
50–64 years, and 65 years and older. Race/ethnicity was self-reported
and categorized as non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, His-
panics, and other. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated according to
the World Health Organization's definitions: underweight (BMI
b18.50 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI 18.50–24.99 kg/m2), overweight
(BMI 25–29.99 kg/m2), and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) (World Health
Organization, 2016). Modifiable CVD risk factors among primary CVD
prevention patients were current smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol
within the past year, hypertension within the past year, obesity, and
physical inactivity (defined as patients who responded “never” or “un-
able” to three questions asking the frequency of their exercise habits).
All analyses were performed with SPSS Complex Samples module
version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Complex sample data analysis
adjusts for weights, cluster, and stratification of the sampling design
to produce unbiased national estimates of population means and fre-
quencies from the sample after taking into account weights for over-
or undersampling of specific groups (Saylor et al., 2012). The survey de-
sign-based variance estimation method is Taylor linearization (Bieler et
al., 2010). In the case of the NHIS, complex sample analysis can be used
to produce national estimates that are representative of the adult civil-
ian noninstitutionalized US population (Parsons et al., 2014).
Annual trends in the prevalence of aspirin use for primary and sec-
ondary CVD prevention were examined by age (age-specific prevalence),
sex, race/ethnicity, geographic region, household income, health insur-
ance status, BMI, and education (age-adjusted prevalences). Age-adjust-
ed prevalences were calculated using the year 2000 US population as the
standard (direct method) (Klein and Schoenborn, 2001). Age-specific
and age-adjusted prevalences were estimated with corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). The CSLOGISTIC procedure was used to esti-
mate the average rates of change over time, and trends were tested by
evaluating the parameter for years as a continuous variable. Trend signif-
icance was assessed via a Wald F test with α = 0.05.
This study was approved by the Deerfield Institute Research Review
Committee and deemed to be in full compliance of HIPAA (Health Insur-
ance Portability and Accountability Act) guidelines, as it did not collect
protected private health information that could be used to identify par-
ticipants. Survey participation in the NHIS is voluntary and the confi-
dentiality of responses is assured under Section 308(d) of the Public
Health Service Act (National Center for Health Statistics, 2016).
3. Results
The 2012–2015 NHIS included a total of 90,558 adults over the age of
40. Demographic characteristics of the sample are presented in Table 1.
During 2012–2015, 12.3% (95% CI: 12.0%–12.6%) of adults self-reported
as having at least one CVD. Coronary heart disease was the most com-
mon CVD, prevalent among 7.1% (95% CI: 6.9%–7.3%) of adults, followed
by myocardial infarction (5.0%; 95% CI: 4.8%–5.2%), stroke (4.1%; 95% CI:
4.0%–4.3%), and angina pectoris (3.0%; 95% CI: 2.8%–3.1%).
Table 2 describes the prevalence of aspirin use for primary CVD pre-
vention by select demographic characteristics. Aspirin use prevalence
was highest among adults aged 65 years and older; males; non-Hispanic
whites; those living in the Midwest region; those with annual house-
hold income of $100,000 and over; those with health insurance;
obese; those with at least some college education; and those with four
or more modifiable CVD risk factors.
The overall age-adjusted prevalence of aspirin use for primary CVD
prevention was 22.1% (95% CI: 21.9%–22.3%), decreasing from 22.8% in
2012 to 20.4% in 2015. Based on the complex samples logistic regression
model, this corresponds to an average annual rate of change of −2.7%
(p = 0.003). All age groups saw significant decreases in prevalence,
though the 40–49 years age group saw the greatest decline (−7.9% av-
erage annual rate of change; p = 0.001). While the majority of the select
demographics saw a decline in aspirin use for primary CVD prevention,

 there was a significant increasing trend in prevalence among non-His-
panic blacks (5.1% average annual rate of change; p = 0.035) and
those with less than high school education (12.0% average annual rate
of change; p = 0.002).
Table 3 shows the prevalence of aspirin use for secondary CVD pre-
vention. Aspirin use prevalence was highest among adults aged
65 years and older; males; non-Hispanic blacks; those living in the Mid-
west region; those with household annual income b$35,000; those with
health insurance; obese; and those with less than high school education.
The overall age-adjusted prevalence of aspirin use for secondary
CVD prevention was 8.0% (95% CI: 7.9%–8.1%), declining from 8.6% in
2012 to 7.6% in 2015. This corresponds to an average annual rate of
change of −3.6% (p = 0.015). Similar to the primary CVD prevention
population, the prevalence of aspirin use for secondary CVD prevention
declined across the majority of the select demographics. Adults without
health insurance saw the greatest decline in aspirin use prevalence for
secondary CVD prevention (−17.2% average annual rate of change;
p = 0.006). Trends among all demographics with positive average an-
nual rates of change were not statistically significant.
4. Discussion
Low-dose aspirin use for primary CVD prevention is currently rec-
ommended by the USPSTF (Bibbins-Domingo and US Preventive
Services Task Force, 2016), while the American Heart Association and
American College of Cardiology Foundation (AHA/ACCF) jointly recom-
mend low-dose aspirin use for secondary CVD prevention (Smith et al.,
2011). This study shows that N30% of adults over the age of 40 self-re-
port as taking low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary CVD preven-
tion. Extrapolating to the US Census Bureau's 2016 population
estimates (United States Census Bureau, 2016), this results in approxi-
mately 35.8 million primary CVD prevention patients and 12.9 million
secondary CVD prevention patients. However, we found that the preva-
lences of aspirin use for both primary and secondary CVD prevention
have declined over the previous four years, despite the USPSTF and
AHA/ACCF recommendations. The only selected demographics that
saw statistically significant increases in aspirin use were non-Hispanic
Blacks and those with less than high school education, both for primary
CVD prevention.
The aim of this study was to provide an epidemiological analysis of
the use of low-dose aspirin for primary and secondary CVD prevention
based on the most recently available data. However, there are some

 important limitations. The NHIS is designed to be as representative as
possible, yet there are inherent difficulties in extrapolating to national
estimates from relatively small sample sizes. Also, this study was
based on self-report data, which can be subject to inaccuracies due to re-
call bias, social desirability bias, and errors in self-observation
(Hawkshead and Krousel-Wood, 2007; Gagné and Godin, 2005;
Turner, 2002; Farmer, 1999; La Fleur, 2004) especially regarding behav-
iors and risk factors relating to CVD and cancer (Mainous et al., 2014;
Newell et al., 1999). To combat this, the NCHS conducts question evalu-
ation studies in order to test and develop survey questions through the
Questionnaire Design Research Laboratory (QDRL). The QDRL leads
studies to isolate and define patterns of question interpretation, types
of response error, and potential for bias in cross-national or cross-cul-
tural population data (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2016). Other potential limitations include being restricted only to adults
over 40 years of age and not including data on other types of cardiovas-
cular disease such as aortic aneurysms or peripheral arterial disease.
Despite these potential limitations, the results of this study provide
greater detail on the use of aspirin in the general population for both
primary and secondary CVD prevention. Of particular note is the fact
that this study used the most current four years of available data to pro-
vide insight into recent changes in the primary and secondary CVD pre-
vention populations, rather than a cross-sectional snapshot. To our
knowledge this is the first epidemiological study to investigate trends
in aspirin usage. Based on our results, although the prevalence of aspirin
usage remains high, with over 30% of adults over 40 years of age taking
aspirin for primary or secondary CVD prevention, this proportion has
decreased in recent years.
