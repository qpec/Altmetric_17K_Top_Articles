Abstract
Background: A 239-question cross-sectional survey was sent out via email in January 2017 to gather comprehensive
information on cannabis use from Canadian medical cannabis patients registered with a federally authorized licensed
cannabis producer, resulting in 2032 complete surveys.
Methods: The survey gathered detailed demographic data and comprehensive information on patient patterns of
medical cannabis use, including questions assessing the self-reported impact of cannabis on the use of prescription
drugs, illicit substances, alcohol, and tobacco.
Results: Participants were 62.6% male (n = 1271) and 91% Caucasian (n = 1839). The mean age was 40 years old, and
pain and mental health conditions accounted for 83.7% of all respondents (n = 1700). Then, 74.6% of respondents
reported daily cannabis use (n = 1515) and mean amount used per day was 1.5 g. The most commonly cited
substitution was for prescription drugs (69.1%, n = 953), followed by alcohol (44.5%, n = 515), tobacco (31.1%,
n = 406), and illicit substances (26.6%, n = 136). Opioid medications accounted for 35.3% of all prescription drug
substitution (n = 610), followed by antidepressants (21.5%, n = 371). Of the 610 mentions of specific opioid
medications, patients report total cessation of use of 59.3% (n = 362).
Conclusions: This study offers a unique perspective by focusing on the use of a standardized, government-
regulated source of medical cannabis by patients registered in Canada’s federal medical cannabis program. The
findings provide a granular view of patient patterns of medical cannabis use, and the subsequent self-reported
impacts on the use of opioids, alcohol, and other substances, adding to a growing body of academic research
suggesting that increased regulated access to medical and recreational cannabis can result in a reduction in
the use of and subsequent harms associated with opioids, alcohol, tobacco, and other substances.

 Background
Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the
world [1, 2]. Its use has been associated with both per-
sonal and social benefits as well as harms [2, 3]. While
research supports the therapeutic use of cannabis in the
treatment of chronic pain and other conditions [4–8], a
comprehensive examination of the public health and
safety impacts of cannabis needs to consider the growing
body of evidence suggesting its use affects the use of po-
tentially more problematic legal substances like alcohol
and tobacco, and illicit substances like cocaine, heroin,
and other opioids.
Bachhuber et al. (2014) report that US states with med-
ical cannabis laws had a 24.8% lower mean annual opioid
overdose mortality rate compared to states without med-
ical cannabis laws (95% CI − 37.5% to − 9.5%, p = .003),
and this trend strengthened over time. An examination of
opioid positivity in fatally injured drivers in the USA
found that state-based medical cannabis programs were
associated with lower rates among 21 to 40 year olds, with
the authors concluding that regulated access to medical
cannabis may reduce opioid use and associated overdoses
[9]. More recently, a cross-sectional study of state imple-
mentation of medical and adult-use cannabis laws from
2011 to 2016 found that medical cannabis laws were asso-
ciated with a 5.88% lower rate of opioid prescribing [10].
Additional population-level research has explored how
the recent introduction of regimes for legal access to
cannabis (e.g., medical and/or recreational) in some US
states has preceded reductions in homicides and violent
crime [11], suicides [12], and automobile-related fatal-
ities [13, 14], with all theorizing that these public health
and safety benefits are related to subsequent declines in
alcohol use.
However, cannabis use is not without potential harms.
Chronic use has been associated with potential neuro-
cognitive impairments particularly in adolescent use,
and the psychoactive effects of use and associated im-
pairment can lead to increased personal health and pub-
lic safety risks associated with driving [15, 16]. While
evidence suggests that smoking as a route of administra-
tion may increase the risk of bronchial issues [17, 18],
the evidence in regards to associations between cannabis
smoking and cancer is inconclusive. While some re-
search has found a moderate increased risk of lung can-
cer in heavy users [19, 20], other studies have concluded
that no causal association exists [17, 18, 21, 22]. It is
important to note that the literature describing adverse
events of cannabis including cardiovascular or cerebro-
vascular events is based on cannabis use from the black
market without standardized quality control. Thus, these
reports are based on cannabis of unknown quality,
toxins, heavy metals, fungal/bacterial elements, strains,
cannabinoid and terpene profiles, illicit drug use (laced
cannabis or simultaneous use), concurrent prescription
drug use, underlying patient medical history such as vas-
cular risk factors, and many other cofounders which can
influence adverse events.
There may also be some vulnerable populations in which
risks are increased, such as women who may be pregnant,
although the limited literature examining impacts of
cannabis use on pregnancy is clouded by contradictory
findings [23, 24]. Youth may be at greater risk since canna-
bis may have more significant cognitive and psychological
impacts on developing brains [25, 26], and those with a
pre-disposition for psychosis or schizophrenia may be
particularly vulnerable since cannabis may perpetuate and
potentially aggravate these conditions [27–29].
Social harms associated with cannabis include the im-
pacts of impairment on driving [30, 31], and financial
impacts on health care and police, court and incarcer-
ation costs resulting from prohibition [16, 32–34]. Some
of the health-related harms and associated costs may be
increased by the current international prohibition on
cannabis, which leaves control over cannabis production
and distribution to the black market. This criminal just-
ice approach to cannabis regulation results in the
criminalization of end-users, and consumers purchasing
cannabis products of unknown potency, with no quality
controls or age restrictions on access [2, 35, 36], making
it challenging to study the actual impacts of cannabis
use
on
individuals
without
significant
confounders
related to both prohibition and the black-market control
over production and distribution.
Recently, these negative policy-related outcomes have
led many jurisdictions to try alternative regulatory ap-
proaches, including the legalization of medical cannabis
use in Canada and much of Latin American and the
European Union, and the regulation of recreational adult
use in a number of US states, Canada, and Uruguay.
This study provides a unique perspective by focusing on
the use of a standardized, government-regulated source
of medical cannabis by patients registered in Canada’s
federal medical cannabis program. The findings provide
a more granular view of patient patterns of medical can-
nabis use, and the subsequent self-reported impacts on
the use of opioids, alcohol and other substances.
Medical cannabis in Canada
In response to legal recognition of the constitutional rights
of Canadians to access cannabis for medical purposes, in
2001, Canada became one of the first nations in the world to
establish a national medical cannabis program [37, 38]. The
Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (MMAR) allowed
patients with chronic or incurable medical conditions like
cancer, MS, HIV/AIDS, and severe chronic pain to apply to
Health Canada for permission to possess a limited amount
of medical cannabis, and in 2003 Health Canada began to
Lucas et al. Harm Reduction Journal            (2019) 16:9

 provide patients with access to a legal source of flower can-
nabis consisting of a single cultivar produced under a federal
contract and shipped to patients via mail [37].
The program has undergone numerous changes since
its initiation due to shifts in policy and in response to
successful legal challenges by patients who found the
program inadequate in addressing their medical needs
[39, 40]. This culminated in the establishment of the
Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR)
in 2014, and ultimately in the Access to Cannabis for
Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) in August 2016
[37]. One of the primary changes of the MMPR/ACMPR
was the authorization of multiple licensed producers (LPs)
of cannabis. Under the ACMPR, patients get cannabis
recommendations from physicians or nurse practitioners
without the past restrictions on medical conditions found
in the MMAR, and can then grow a limited amount of
their own cannabis and/or access it from LPs, who ship it
directly to patients via mail [38, 41]. As of September
2018, there were over 130 federally authorized licensed
producers providing hundreds of strains of cannabis as
well as cannabis extracts like oils or capsules to approxi-
mately 342,103 patients [42]. Under the ACMPR, health
care providers (HCPs) make a written recommendation of
the amount of cannabis that patients are authorized to use
and ultimately possess in “grams per day”; it is the respon-
sibility of each LP to determine the quantity of cannabis
oil that is equivalent to 1 g of dried cannabis [42]. While
some HCPs provide restrictions in regards to the potency
or type of cannabis patients may order from LPs and sub-
sequently use, no condition-specific clinical guidelines
have been developed yet, and patients are typically free to
order and use whatever type of cannabis (i.e., specific cul-
tivars, potencies, or types of cannabis products) they feel
may work best in addressing their medical conditions or
symptoms [37, 41, 43].
As part of the ACMPR, Health Canada keeps detailed
records of the amount of cannabis produced and distrib-
uted to patients; however, there is very little data on
what conditions or symptoms affect these patients, how
they use cannabis products (i.e., type of product/mode
of use, frequency and dosages), and the impact of that
use on the use of prescription medications, alcohol, to-
bacco, and other substances.
Methods
In the interest of learning more about why/how patients
use medical cannabis and whether this use affects the use
of other substances, a 239-question patient feedback ques-
tionnaire was designed to gather comprehensive informa-
tion on patient demographics, patterns of cannabis use,
access to cannabis, and cannabis substitution effect from
2000 Canadian medical cannabis patients registered with
Tilray, a federally authorized medical cannabis production,
distribution, and research company located in Nanaimo,
BC. This presented a unique cohort of cannabis users to
assess, since they accessed a quality-tested, standardized
cannabis supply under the auspice of a legal, tightly regu-
lated medical cannabis regime.
The primary objectives of the Tilray Patient Survey
2017 were to:
1. Describe the characteristics of the sample, including
patient demographics, use of cannabis, prescription
drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substances.
2. Assess the extent to which cannabis is used as a
substitute for prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco,
and illicit substances, and differences in the extent of
substitution among the most frequently used drugs.
3. Assess the extent to which substitution is mediated
by age, gender, primary medical condition/
symptoms, cannabis strains, and method of use.
This survey was ethics reviewed and approved by
Advarra (formerly Institutional Review Board Services),
and the University of Victoria subsequently approved a
post-survey sub-analysis of the substitution data. Data
gathering was done on REDCap, a HIPAA, and PIPEDA
compliant
electronic
data
capture
system.
HIPAA
(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996) is US legislation that provides data privacy and
security provisions for safeguarding medical information,
and PIPEDA is the Canadian federal privacy law govern-
ing private-sector organizations.
Participants were adult federally authorized medical
cannabis patients registered with Tilray that provided the
company with an email address, were capable of reading
and understanding French or English, and were able to
legally consent to participate in the study.
A password-protected link to an online survey available
in French and English was sent out to 16,675 Tilray pa-
tients. Clicking on the link in the email invitation took pa-
tients to the IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF),
and consent was gathered electronically. All questions were
set to “must provide value”, so all questionnaires were fully
answered with the exclusion of questions not relevant to
individual respondents (i.e., if patients never used tobacco,
then questions re. tobacco substitution were programmed
not to appear via REDCap’s “skip logic” function). To com-
pensate patients for taking the time to respond and share
their experiences, Tilray offered a $10 credit on future can-
nabis purchases to all patients who completed the survey.
The study budget of $20,000 allowed for the gathering of
up to 2000 responses, and the survey deliberately closed
after gathering 2032 complete responses (32 participants
were in the process of completing the survey when this cut
off was met so they were permitted to finish, resulting in
2032 complete surveys).

 Measures
The survey was composed of multiple choice, ranking,
and open-ended questions to gather demographic data,
health-related information, and details on medical can-
nabis use and its impact on the use of other substances.
A question regarding primary condition provided a se-
lection of 21 common medical conditions for which pa-
tients chose to use cannabis, and participants could
only click one box (or click other and provide details in
a text box), but a follow-up question regarding primary
symptoms allowed participants to click multiple boxes
from a selection of 13 common symptoms (or to click
other and provide details in a text box). This allowed
for a broader analysis of why patients specifically use
medical cannabis in the treatment of different condi-
tions; for example a participant citing MS as a primary
condition might report use of cannabis to address in-
somnia, pain, and spasticity under primary symptoms.
A comprehensive assessment of cannabis use included
questions on frequency of use per day and per week; yes-
terday use; amount used per session of use, as well as per
day and per week; methods of ingestion (Vaporizer—can-
nabis flowers/bud; Oral (edibles such as oil drops/extracts,
baked goods, butter, tincture), Joint; Pipe; Waterpipe/bong;
Vaporizer/nail/vape pen—cannabis extracts (shatter, bud-
der, oil, etc.); Topical (on the skin; e.g., lotions/salves, etc.);
Juicing (4, 0.2%); Other (please specify)); preferred canna-
bis flower variety as classified by Tilray (either indica,
sativa, hybrid, 1:1 CBD/THC, 3:1 CBD/THC); and favorite
cultivar/strain with a drop-down menu of all 37 cultivars
or blended milled flower available from Tilray to that
point, and an “other” option with an additional textual
response. Those who acknowledged use of Tilray extract
products (oil-based drops or capsules) were asked about
their preferred type of extract as labeled by the producer
(indica, sativa, hybrid, 1:1 CBD/THC, 3:1 CBD/THC), fre-
quency of use per day, and whether or not they also used
flower, and if so, what percentage of their use was flower
vs. extract in a quintile range from 10% flower/90% extract
to 10% extract/90% flower. Participants were also asked to
rank their current level of cannabis knowledge from 0 to
100, with 1 being no knowledge and experience at all, and
100 being very knowledgeable and experienced.
In order to assess substitution, participants were
asked if they “ever regularly used or currently use” any
of the following four classes of drugs: prescription
drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substances. Those
who responded positively were then asked if they had
ever used cannabis as a substitute for these substances.
Those that responded positively to substitution for ei-
ther prescription drugs or illicit drugs were then asked
to name up to three specific drugs they substituted for,
and then asked at what percent they substituted canna-
bis
for
each
specific
drug by
choosing
from
the
following options in a multiple choice, single-answer:
100% (Stopped using this drug completely); 75% (Re-
duced my use of this drug by 3/4); 50% (Reduced my
use of this drug by half); 25% (Reduced my use of this
drug by ¼).
For both alcohol and tobacco, participants who responded
positively to substitution were then asked at what quartile
percent they substituted via the same multiple choice used
to assess the self-reported rate of substitution for prescrip-
tion and illicit substances highlighted above.
Analysis
Primary analysis for this study was done on SPSS.
Objective 1 was assessed using descriptive statistics (fre-
quencies) to describe the characteristics of the sample.
The distribution of the qualitative responses for other in
both the primary condition and primary symptoms ques-
tions were examined and recoded if they match with the
listed conditions; otherwise, they were left as other.
Amount of flower cannabis was determined by examining
self-reported cannabis use per week in grams, and extract
use by frequency of daily and weekly use (“times per day”
× “days per week” use).
Objective 2 was assessed using descriptive statistics to
quantify the degree of substitution based on quartiles
from 25 to 100%. Several independent frequencies were
conducted
for
the
percent of
substitution
from
0
(recoded to 0, if no other percent is given) to 100, re-
stricted only to those who reported any regular lifetime
use for each substance. Analyses recoded the prescrip-
tion drugs into logical sub-categories (i.e., opioids, ben-
zos, antidepressants, muscle relaxants, etc.), as well as
the illicit substances (i.e., cocaine/crack cocaine, opioids,
stimulants, psychedelics, etc.).
Objective 3 was assessed using bivariate logistic regres-
sion analyses for substitution effect of each major drug
(i.e., opioids, alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substances), which
were recorded as dichotomous variables (DVs). Medical
condition/symptoms (i.e., pain, mental health) were re-
duced into a smaller number of logical groupings—arth-
ritis/musculoskeletal and headache were grouped with
chronic pain to form a broader chronic pain category, and
PTSD was grouped with mental health to create a broader
mental health primary condition category, and stress, anx-
iety, depression were grouped to create a broader primary
symptoms category—and treated as categorical IVs. Simi-
larly, cannabis flower varieties and extracts were grouped
to best reflect THC/CBD ratios ranging from “high THC/
low CBD” to “High CBD/low THC”.
Results
The mean age of the sample was 40 years old, 1271 of
which identified as male (62.6%), 758 female (37.3%),
Lucas et al. Harm Reduction Journal            (2019) 16:9 
Page 4 of 11
 and 3 as Other (non-binary, transmasculine) (0.15%). In
terms of marital status and racial backgrounds, 54.5%
were married or in domestic partnership (n = 1107), and
91% (n = 1839) identified as Caucasian; 6% [122] Metis/
First Nations, 2% [37] South Asian, and 2% [35] Asian.
This was a highly educated population compared to the
Canadian General Population (CGP); 93% (n = 1893) of
participants had a high school degree (compared to 87%
CGP) and 22% (n = 444) had a university degree or higher
(compared to 17% of CGP) [44]. In regards to employ-
ment status, 63% of participants worked full time or part
time (n = 1276), and 19% were disabled/not able to work
(n = 384). In terms of income, participants were nearly
identical to the CGP: 6.6% made less than $10,000 (n = 135;
CGP = 5%), 25.6% made $10,000–$39,999 (n = 521; CGP:
27%), 42% made $40,000–$99,999 (n = 852; CGP: 42%), and
26% made $ > 100,000 (n = 524; CGP: 26%) [44].
Primary condition and symptoms
In terms of primary condition and primary symptoms,
pain and mental health conditions were dominant, as
seen in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. For primary
condition, chronic pain was reported by 29.4% (n = 598),
and mental health condition was reported by 27% (n = 548).
This was followed by insomnia (9.7%, n = 198), arthritis/

 musculoskeletal (9.3%, n = 188), PTSD (4.6%, n = 93), and
headache (3.7%, n = 75). In all, pain and mental health con-
ditions—PTSD, mental health, insomnia, chronic pain,
arthritis, headache—accounted for 83.7% of all respondents
(n = 1700).
In regards to primary symptoms, chronic pain was re-
ported by 58.3% (n = 1184), followed by anxiety (48.8%,
n = 991), insomnia (46.2%, n = 939), stress (45.8%, n =
929), and depression (37.8%, n = 767).
Cannabis use
In regards to cannabis use, 74.6% (n = 1515) reported
daily use, with a median of twice a day use (25.1%, n =
511). Across all primary conditions, the majority of pa-
tients reported using cannabis on a daily basis (7 days/
week), as seen in Table 3. Mean amount used per day
was 1.5 g, with 78.5% (n = 1595) of participants reporting
they use less than 3 g per day, and 9.9% (n = 201) report-
ing they use 4 g or more per day.
In regards to primary method of use, vaporizer (canna-
bis flowers/bud or nail/pen) was cited by 31.1% (n =
632), followed by joint (30.4%; n = 617), oral/edible
(16.3%, n = 332), pipe (11.3%, n = 229), waterpipe/bong
(10.4%, n = 212), topical (0.3%, n = 6), and juicing (0.2%,
n = 4). This means that while inhalation via vaporization
and/or smoking was by far the most popular methods
of use, accounting for 83.2% (n = 1690), non-smoked
methods of use (oral ingestion, topical, and vaporization)
accounted for nearly half (47.6%, n = 968) of the primary
methods of use.
In regards to flower cannabis (“bud”), 32% preferred
hybrids (n = 651), 28% preferred indicas (n = 569), 24.7%
preferred sativas (n = 502), and 14.8% preferred high canna-
bidiol (CBD) strains (1:1 CBD/THC or greater CBD con-
tent) (n = 300), with 0.49% (n = 10) citing no preference.
This suggests that when smoking or vaporizing cannabis—
which is what patients do with cannabis flower—a signifi-
cant majority (84.7%; n = 1722) prefer strains high in THC.
However, this was not the case with orally ingested
oils/extracts. Overall, 38.5% of respondents used orally
ingested cannabis oils/extracts (n = 782), with 49.2% cit-
ing they mostly used high CBD oils/extracts (n = 381).
Oils/extracts were used with a lower frequency than
flower, with only 29.5% reporting daily use (n = 226), and
the median frequency of use per day being once per day
(65.6%; n = 497). Additionally, 66.5%
of those
who
reported using oil/extracts also used flower on the same
day (n = 514), with a breakdown of 10% extract/90%

 flower for 45.1% (n = 230), 25% extract/75% flower for
23.3% (n = 119), 50% extract/50% flower for 16.5% (n = 84),
75% extract/25% flower for 9.6% (n = 49), and 90% extract/
10% flower for 5.5% (n = 28). Therefore, for most partici-
pants, oils/extracts appear to be adjunct treatments to the
smoking or vaporization of cannabis flower.
When participants were asked to rank their current level
of cannabis knowledge from 0 to 100 (with 1 being no
knowledge and experience at all, and 100 being very
knowledgeable and experienced), the mean was 73.65
(SD21.81). Interestingly, neither age nor income were sig-
nificantly associated with different levels of knowledge, but
there was a significant linear correlation (r = 0.29) with
grams consumed per week and self-reported knowledge
level, and higher knowledge levels were more likely to use
vape pens and water bongs, while lower levels of knowledge
were more likely to use oral/extracts (p > .05), suggesting
that naïve or less experienced cannabis users may have had
a greater level of comfort with non-inhaled, orally-ingested
modes of ingestion.
Substitution for other substances
The most commonly cited substitution was for prescrip-
tion drugs (69.1%; n = 953), followed by alcohol (44.5%;
n = 515), tobacco (31.1%; n = 406), and illicit substances
(26.6%; n = 136), as seen in Table 4. Overall, women
were more likely to report substitution than men (p
< .01; 95% CI).
Participants named a total of 1730 specific prescription
drugs they substituted cannabis for, 35.3% (n = 610) of
which were opioids, 21.5% (n = 371) anti-depressants,
10.9% (n = 189) non-opioid pain medications, 8.6% (n =
149) anti-seizure medications, 8.1% (n = 140) muscle re-
laxants/sleep aids, 4.3% (n = 75) benzodiazepines, 3.4%
(n = 59) stimulants, 1.4% (n = 24) anti-emetics, and 1%
(n = 18) anti-psychotics, as seen in Table 5. Of the 610
mentions of opioid medications, participants self-reported
they stopped using 59.3% completely (100% substitution)
(n = 362), and a further 18.4% reduced their use by 75%
(n = 112). Participants who substituted for opioids used

 more cannabis per day (1.71 g vs. 1.46 g by those who did
not cite substitution for opioids) and were also more likely
to report extract/oral use as their primary method of use
(21%; n = 458 vs. 15%; n = 1574; p = 0.01) and to use ex-
tracts on a daily basis (40%; n = 187 vs. 26%; n = 580; p =
0.004). In ranking reasons for substituting cannabis for
prescription drugs, the reason ranked as the “most im-
portant” by the highest number of participants was the be-
lief that cannabis is a safer alternative than prescription
drugs (ranked #1 by 51.2%; n = 419), followed by fewer ad-
verse side-effects (39.7%; n = 207), better symptom manage-
ment (19.5%; n = 124), fewer withdrawal symptoms (11.4%;
n = 61), the ability to obtain cannabis vs. prescription
drugs (3%; n = 18), and social acceptance of cannabis is
greater than prescription drugs (2.4%; n = 17).
Of the 515 respondents who substituted cannabis for al-
cohol, 30.9% suggested they stopped using it completely
(100%) (n = 159), and 36.7% reported reducing by at least
75% (n = 189). Participants who reported mental health
symptoms were more likely to substitute for alcohol (n =
834; p = .0005), whereas participants who reported pain
symptoms were less likely to substitute for alcohol (n =
761; p = .002).
Of the 406 participants who substituted cannabis for
tobacco, 50.7% say they stopped using it completely
(100% substitution) (n = 206), and 13.8% reported redu-
cing their use by 75% (n = 56). Those who substituted
for tobacco were far more likely to smoke cannabis as
their primary method of use (66% vs. 48% of those who
did not substitute for tobacco; p < .0001). A more de-
tailed analysis of the tobacco substitution data from this
study is the subject of a separate publication.
In regards to illicit substances, cocaine/crack was the
most frequently substituted illicit drug (17.4%; n = 89),
followed by psychedelics (11.7%; n = 60), non-prescription
opioids (5.7%; n = 29), stimulants (2.7%; n = 14), and de-
pressants (1.6%; n = 8), as seen in Table 5. Of those who
cited substituting for illicit substances, 72.2% suggested
they substituted at 100% for that specific drug mentioned
(n = 332).
Discussion
This study represents the largest polling of Canadian
medical cannabis patients to date, and the first broad
survey of cannabis patients that we are aware of that has
gathered such a detailed inventory of cannabis substitu-
tion for other drugs, including the specific prescription
and illicit substances being substituted for, and the
self-reported rate of that substitution as identified in
quartile percentages, significantly improving the overall
understanding of medical cannabis use and its impact
on the use of opioids, alcohol, and other substances.
The finding that cannabis was being used for the treat-
ment of chronic pain is in keeping with past research
[45, 46], but the growing use to treat mental health con-
ditions like anxiety, stress, and depression suggests an
emerging trend in medical cannabis use [38, 47]. Despite
ongoing concerns in regards to the impact of cannabis
use by those with a predisposition for psychosis and
schizophrenia [47, 48], the use to address more minor
but widespread mental health conditions represents a
potential broadening of therapeutic applications and a
good target for further research [47, 49, 50].
The high frequency of daily use (74.6%) may suggest an
area of concern in terms of potential long-term impacts
on physical and mental health, but it is likely a reflection
of the high rate of use for pain and mental health condi-
tions, both of which are chronic conditions with daily
traditional pharmacological treatment options. While daily
use may pose a risk of dependence in some patients, re-
search suggests a low risk overall. In a 2015 report titled
State of the Evidence; Cannabis Use and Regulation, the
International Centre for Science in Drug Policy assessed
the state of evidence regarding the potential harms of can-
nabis use. They found the lifetime use of cannabis carried
a low risk of dependence (9%), while the lifetime risk of
dependence to alcohol has been assessed at 22.7%, and the
lifetime risk of heroin dependence is estimated to be be-
tween 23.1 and 35.5% [51].
Additionally, while 52.4% of respondents cited smok-
ing as a primary route of administration, which could re-
sult in bronchial harms [18, 22], this data also suggests
an ongoing trend away from the smoked ingestion of
high THC products and toward vaporization and the
oral ingestion (oils or capsules) of high CBD extracts (oil
or capsules) [37, 38]. This is likely due to an increase in
non-smoked product options available to patients via the
ACMPR, a growing awareness of the potential thera-
peutic benefits of CBD (particularly in regards to the
treatment of mental health conditions), and a more
health-conscious approach to medical cannabis use over-
all. However, with more and more patients around the
world using cannabis for medical purposes, prospective
studies will be necessary to assess the long-term health
implications of chronic daily medical use, inform thera-
peutic considerations by patients and health care pro-
viders, and develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.
This study’s findings on the self-reported reduction of
opioid use are particularly significant to public health
and safety. The past decade has seen the rapid growth of
an opioid epidemic in North America, and currently
drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in
Canada and the US, with many of these deaths resulting
from both prescription and illicit opioids. In 2015, there
were 52,404 drug overdose deaths in the USA, including
33,091 (63.1%) overdose deaths related to opioids [72].
In Canada, it is estimated that 4000 people died of an
opioid overdose in 2017, 1450 of which were in British

 Columbia alone [52], and opioid overdose now results in
an average of 16 hospitalizations per day, a 53% increase
in opioid-related hospitalizations over the last 10 years
[53]. Cannabis may not only reduce the prescription and
use of opioids in medical and non-medical users [45,
54–56], it may also reduce the odds of transitioning to
more
problematic
substances
and
patterns
of
use.
Reddon et al. (2018) found that daily cannabis use was
associated with slower rates of injection drug initiation
among street youth in Vancouver (adjusted relative haz-
ard 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.45–0.98; p = 0.038)
[57]. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that canna-
bis use may reduce opioid withdrawal and improve out-
comes of opioid-replacement therapies (methadone/
Suboxone) for those seeking treatment for opioid use
disorder [57–60], thereby reducing the public health im-
pacts of the current opioid overdose crisis.
Concurrent with the policy trend toward the regula-
tion and legalization of both medical and adult recre-
ational use in many US states, Canada, and around the
world is an urgent need to develop mechanisms to sys-
tematically track both the positive and negative impacts
of cannabis use on individuals and society. However, this
study suggests that regulating access to a standardized,
quality-controlled source of cannabis for authorized pa-
tients may provide an opportunity to both reduce the
harms associated with cannabis use, and to maximize
the potential positive impacts on public health and safety
stemming from cannabis substitution effect. Future stud-
ies involving standardized, quality-controlled cannabis
will also provide more accurate assessments of not only
benefits of cannabis, but potential side effects and ad-
verse events as well.
Strengths and limitations
This study has a number of strengths and limitations.
Budgetary restrictions resulted in deliberately cutting
off the survey at 2032 participants, leaving open the
possibility this could be an unrepresentative sample.
Since this sample is drawn from a patient population
registered with a medical cannabis company, respon-
dents may be more likely to report positive effects
related to the medical use of cannabis—including sub-
stitution effect—because of selection bias. All data in
this study were self-reported retroactive data by patients
and did not benefit from biological drug detection to
confirm use or non-use of a substance, so is subject to
potential recall bias. Since the questionnaire measured
“ever” use of drugs and subsequent substitution, there is
no way to determine whether self-reported substitution
was a temporary or lasting outcome. However, the iden-
tification of specific prescription drugs substituted for
by respondents partially mitigates this issue for this
class of substances, since respondents specifically refer
to substitution of an actual prescription drug, rather
than a drug class like alcohol or tobacco. In light of
these potential biases, the characterization of the thera-
peutic use of cannabis and/or cannabis substitution
effect should be interpreted with caution pending repli-
cation by research that employs a more systematic
recruitment approach, longitudinal monitoring, and bio-
logical drug testing.
These limitations are counterbalanced by several meth-
odological strengths, including the large size of the sample,
assurance that all participants were using a standardized,
high-quality source of cannabis with the support of a health
care practitioner, and adherence to established standards
for reporting Internet-based surveys [61].
