Micronutrient deficiencies such as those of vitamin A and iron
affect a third of the world’s population with consequences such
as night blindness, higher child mortality, anemia, poor preg-
nancy outcomes, and reduced work capacity. Many efforts to
prevent or treat these deficiencies are hampered by the lack
of adequate, accessible, and affordable diagnostic methods that
can enable better targeting of interventions. In this work, we
demonstrate a rapid diagnostic test and mobile enabled platform
for simultaneously quantifying iron (ferritin), vitamin A (retinol-
binding protein), and inflammation (C-reactive protein) status.
Our approach, enabled by combining multiple florescent mark-
ers and immunoassay approaches on a single test, allows us to
provide accurate quantification in 15 min even though the physi-
ological range of the markers of interest varies over five orders of
magnitude. We report sensitivities of 88%, 100%, and 80% and
specificities of 97%, 100%, and 97% for iron deficiency (ferritin
<15 ng/mL or 32 pmol/L), vitamin A deficiency (retinol-binding
protein <14.7 µg/mL or 0.70 µmol/L) and inflammation status
(C-reactive protein >3.0 µg/mL or 120 nmol/L), respectively. This
technology is suitable for point-of-care use in both resource-rich
and resource-limited settings and can be read either by a standard
laptop computer or through our previously developed NutriPhone
technology. If implemented as either a population-level screening
or clinical diagnostic tool, we believe this platform can transform
nutritional status assessment and monitoring globally.

I
ron deficiency (ID) and vitamin A deficiency (VAD) are two
of the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies worldwide.
ID affects 2 billion people and is a common cause of ane-
mia, which may reduce physical work capacity in adults or lead
to impaired brain development in children (1). VAD causes
night blindness, mostly among children and pregnant women,
affecting about 29% of the population in low- and mid-income
countries (2). VAD also negatively affects the immune system
and results in lowered erythropoiesis (3). Moreover, ID and
VAD often coexist (4) and the interaction between ID and
VAD may exacerbate each deficiency (5–7). Therefore, simul-
taneous access to iron and vitamin A status among popula-
tions at risk is important. ID and VAD due to dietary inade-
quacy can be potentially effectively treated at early stages by
changing diet and/or taking supplements (8–10), although it
can be challenging at the population level. Measuring ID and
VAD status represents an important first step in managing these
deficiencies.
Ferritin and retinol-binding protein (RBP) in serum are com-
mon biomarkers used for assessment of iron and vitamin A
status. Ferritin serves to store and transport iron in blood, an
indicator of ID (11). The normal range of ferritin in serum is
between 15 ng/mL (32 pmol/L) and 150 ng/mL (316 pmol/L)
for females or 200 ng/mL (421 pmol/L) for males, while the
cutoff for depleted iron storage in children less than 5 y old is
<12 ng/mL (26 pmol/L) and <30 ng/mL (63 pmol/L) if inflam-
mation presents. Nearly all retinol, the circulating form of vita-
min A in serum, is bound to RBP, so RBP concentrations in
blood can be used as an indicator of vitamin A status (12). How-
ever, different RBP cutoffs such as 14.5 µg/mL (0.69 µmol/L),
14.7 µg/mL (0.70 µmol/L), and 17.4 µg/mL (0.83 µmol/L) for
a diagnostic of VAD have been proposed (13–16), because the
molar ratio between retinol and RBP depends on many factors.
For the purposes of this paper, we consider a serum RBP con-
centration lower than 14.7 µg/mL (0.70 µmol/L) as vitamin A
deficient. This cutoff corresponds to the diagnostic standard for
VAD at 0.70 µmol/L of serum retinol concentration, assuming
a 1:1 retinol to RBP ratio in circulation (17), which has also
been demonstrated in previous research (15, 18). A challenge to
diagnosing ID and VAD, however, is that RBP and ferritin are
both acute phase proteins. This means that RBP concentrations
in blood can be temporarily reduced and ferritin concentrations
can be temporarily increased by acute infection and inflamma-
tion (19–21). Therefore, readings taken during acute infection or
inflammation periods can result in a false deficiency/sufficiency
diagnosis. As such, C-reactive protein (CRP) or similar mark-
ers of inflammation should also be measured, to correctly inter-
pret iron and vitamin A status. For people with moderate infec-
tion, serum CRP concentration is usually higher than 5.0 µg/mL
Significance
We demonstrate a technology that we believe could trans-
form the way nutritional deficiency testing is done world-
wide. Micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A and iron
affect a third of the world’s population with consequences
such as blindness, higher child mortality, anemia, poor preg-
nancy outcomes, and reduced work capacity. Our testing
platform simultaneously quantifies concentrations of ferritin,
retinol-binding protein, and C-reactive protein, allowing one
to diagnose iron and vitamin A deficiency and inflammation
status (to better inform and help with the interpretation of
the result) in about 15 min. Our approach combines multiple
florescent markers and immunoassay approaches on a single
test strip, allowing us to span the five orders of magnitude
difference in the physiological range of these markers.

 (200 nmol/L), while for healthy people, serum CRP concentra-
tion is usually lower than 3.0 µg/mL (120 nmol/L) (22).
In this paper we introduce a rapid, portable diagnostic test
for ID and VAD and demonstrate its performance compared
with standard reference measurements in human samples. Incor-
poration of sandwich-type ferritin and CRP assays with a com-
petitive RBP assay onto a single multiplexed test allowed us
to not only detect ferritin concentrations as low as 15 ng/mL
(32 pmol/L), but also measure RBP concentrations, which are
over 105 times higher than ferritin concentrations, at ∼70 µg/mL
(3.3 µmol/L). We show that the test requires around 15 min to
accurately quantify ferritin, RBP, and CRP concentrations in
serum samples through evaluation of the fluorescent signal inten-
sity on each test line. The device yielded sensitivities of 88%,
100%, and 80% and specificities of 97%, 100%, and 97% for
ID, VAD, and inflammation status. We also demonstrate how
multicolor fluorescence allows us to ensure that cross-binding
does not significantly affect the results. Like other smartphone-
based diagnostic devices, functions such as tracking users’ diag-
nostic records and communicating the result via email are inher-
ited (23–29). Common variabilities observed in other devices,
caused by such things as auto-color correction performed by the
camera (30), have been avoided with our raw data subtraction
algorithm.
Results
Multiplexed Micronutrient Deficiency Test-Strip Architecture. Our
platform consists of a reusable stand-alone reader, which we
call the TIDBIT and expand on later, and a disposable cus-
tom multiplexed fluorescence test strip that measures ferritin,
RBP, and CRP concentrations. The multiplex nutrition assay
was optimized in two ways. First, because serum RBP concen-
trations (>20 µg/mL or 0.95 µmol/L in a healthy group) can be
∼10 times higher than serum CRP concentrations (<3 µg/mL
or 0.12 µmol/L for healthy people) and ∼105 times higher than
serum ferritin concentrations (<15 ng/mL or 32 pmol/L for ID),
we combined a sandwich ferritin assay, a competitive RBP assay,
and a sandwich CRP assay on one single test strip, allowing
us to cover the entire physical range of the three biomarkers
with one assay. Second, we labeled R-phycoerythrin (RPE), flu-
orescein (FITC), and phycoerythrin/Cyaine5 (PE/Cy5) on detec-
tion antibodies for ferritin, RBP, and CRP fluorescence assays,

ferritin and CRP results in higher fluorescence signal intensity with increasing concentration, while higher RBP concentrations result in lower signal intensity
due to the use of a competitive assay. (B) Sample results from different humans with known ferritin, RBP, and CRP concentrations in serum, showing the

respectively. The combination of RPE, FITC, and PE/Cy5 is
suitable for a three-color fluorescence test because they have
similar excitation wavelengths (∼488 nm) but different emis-
sion spectra, which peak at 564 nm (RPE), 532 nm (FITC),
and 649 nm (PE/Cy5), leading to distinguishable colors: orange,
green, and red, respectively. As we demonstrate later, the major
benefits of using the fluorescence tags with different colors for
different markers are that potential cross-binding between anti-
bodies can be determined by observing whether a fluorescence
color appears in the wrong detection area. Also using a higher
quantum-yield fluorescence tag on the marker with lower con-
centration may balance the brightness of each test line and
reduce the dynamic range required.
Fig. 1A shows a test-strip schematic. The test strip consists of a
buffer pad that accepts running buffer; an incubation pad that
incubates the sample with labeled antibodies; a mixing pad; a
nitrocellulose membrane with immobilized anti-CRP, RBP, anti-
ferritin, and secondary antibodies sequentially in the direction of
flow; and another cellulose fiber pad to collect the waste sample
at the end. To simplify operation we incorporated an incubation
pad in our test strip, as a substitute for the sample and conjuga-
tion pads traditionally used in lateral flow test strips. The incuba-
tion pad is preloaded with labeled antibodies, allowing preincu-
bation of sample and labeled antibodies immediately as soon as
the sample is added.
To perform a test, first 15 µL of human serum was added on
the incubation pad and the test strip was left in a light-free envi-
ronment for 3 min. Then 60 µL running buffer was added to the
buffer pad to initiate the flow. The flow front first reaches the
CRP test line, then the RBP test line, and then the ferritin test
line on the nitrocellulose membrane. All conjugation antibodies
are mouse monoclonal antibodies, so goat antimouse secondary
antibodies are dispensed as a control line for all three mark-
ers. After a test is performed, fluorescence tags are bound on
the test lines and the intensities of fluorescence light are related
to the concentration of the marker in the sample. Those con-
jugation antibodies that are not captured by the test lines are
captured by the secondary antibodies in the control line. There-
fore, the color on the control line is a mix of green, orange,
and red emitted light. The control line demonstrates that the
test worked properly and helps locate the position of test lines
in the image because the distance between lines on the image
is fixed.

The TIDBIT reader automatically images the test after 15 min
(Fig. S1). In Fig. 1B, we present a set of typical fluorescence
images acquired by the reader from human serum samples with
previously characterized concentrations of CRP, ferritin, and
RBP by ELISA. The health status of the participants was deter-
mined based on the ELISA measurements of ferritin, RBP, and
CRP concentrations and is listed underneath each of the cases
shown in Fig. 1B. All of the electronic components and optical
filters are commercially available, and the TIDBIT reader can
cost as little as $95 to manufacture, and each multiplex test for
three biomarkers costs around $1.50.
TIDBIT Reader and Fluorescence Imaging System. Fig. 2 A and B
shows the design of the TIDBIT reader. The reader links to a
standard laptop or our previously developed NutriPhone (26)
technology to interpret the results and display them to the user.
In the reader, a tray is built to accept test-strip cartridges with
a variety of shapes. As shown in Fig. 2C, fluorescence signals
appear on the test strip only during the fluorescence imaging
mode. Fig. 2D shows the design of the fluorescence detection
system. The sensor was developed using a Raspberry Pi camera
module. It excites the fluorescence signal on the test strip, using
six blue LEDs covered by band-pass optical filters with a center
wavelength at 458 nm. A focusing lens with f = 25 mm is aligned
to the optical path of the camera. A 535-nm long-pass optical fil-
ter covers the camera to eliminate excitation light (Fig. S2). The
detection area on the test strip is aligned to the optical path of
the sensor to maximize image quality.
To avoid variability introduced by the camera autocorrec-
tion, we developed image-processing software that measures
biomarker concentrations with unprocessed raw data directly
from the complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS)
sensor. Fig. 2E shows the algorithm whereby the captured image
is processed and the results are quantified. Briefly, binary data
directly extracted from the camera are transformed to a raw
image, followed by cropping dark edges so that only the test strip
in the image remains. Then the image is converted to grayscale
and integration of grayscale value in the direction vertical to the

flow is performed, to reduce the 2D image to a 1D array. Then
locations of test and control lines are determined. At intervals
between each of these locations, a polynomial fitting of points is
performed to find the brightness of background. The background
is then subtracted from the original brightness profile to find the
true brightness of the control and test lines, which represents the
intensity of the fluorescence signal on the test strip. The average
brightness value of each test line is then stored. Further details of
the image-processing algorithm are in SI Materials and Methods
and Fig. S3. Finally, the result is displayed as shown in Fig. 2F.
If concentration of a given marker falls within our physio-
logically relevant dynamic range, the TIDBIT reader provides
quantitative analysis for all three biomarkers. Otherwise it tells
whether the concentration of biomarkers is greater than the
upper bound, or less than the lower bound of the test range.
Details on the physiological range of all three biomarkers and
the way we present the results are included in SI Materials and
Methods and Fig. S10). The TIDBIT reader has a 16-GB SD card
as storage. Results are stored in both the TIDBIT reader and the
mobile device after each test, and all previous results can be read
at any time.
Ferritin, RBP, and CRP Assay Quantification. Forty-three human
whole blood samples from different participants were used to
quantify the TIDBIT assay. The blood samples were purchased
from a commercial source (Research Blood Components, LLC)
and were all from US adult donors with no appearance of
infectious disease. Concentrations of ferritin, CRP, and RBP
in the samples were characterized with commercial ELISA kits
(Abcam, Inc.). No data were excluded. Four batches of test strips
were manufactured and randomly selected for each test. The test
strips were stored in a light-free environment at room tempera-
ture until used. No significant batch-to-batch variability between
test strips was observed, and storage up to 6 wk had no notice-
able effect on the test result, as shown in Figs. S4 and S5. Human
serum samples were separated with a portable centrifuge from
whole blood and then used as direct input into the test. Fig. 3A

Calibration of the biomarkers. (A) Colorimetric variation of the multiplex test strip from three different human serum samples: #2 (with ferritin =
34 ng/mL or 75 pmol/L, RBP = 16.0 µg/mL or 0.76 µmol/L and CRP = 0.37 µg/mL or 15 nmol/L), #7 (with ferritin = 42 ng/mL or 93 pmol/L, RBP = 31.5 µg/mL or
1.48 µmol/L, and CRP = 3.41 µg/mL or 136 nmol/L), and #26 (with ferritin = 40 ng/mL or 89 pmol/L, RBP = 11.0 µg/mL or 0.52 µmol/L, and CRP = 0.27 µg/mL
or 11 nmol/L). (B–D) Data points showing the average intensity of the fluorescence signal for each marker at different concentration and calibration of each

human serum samples with known ferritin, RBP, and CRP con-
centration and their brightness profile acquired by the imaging-
processing algorithm. The images of strips were rescaled to 40%
along the direction vertical to the flow.
Brightness values of test lines were then correlated to the read-
out of commercial ELISA kits, as shown in Fig. 3 B–D. For each
of the 43 human samples, three test strips were used. The bright-
ness values are averaged for the three test strips and range of
the brightness values is shown as error bars. According to the
ELISA results, 9 of 43 (20.9%) participants were ID, 4 of 43
(9.3%) participants were VAD, and 10 of 43 (23.2%) participants
were subject to minimal or moderate inflammation. We then
fitted four-parameter logistic curves on each marker such that
[marker] = f [brightness#], and the calibration functions were
stored to predict concentration of each marker in the microcon-
troller software. Four-parameter curve-fitting results show R2 =
0.93 (P < 0.0001) for ferritin, R2 = 0.92 (P < 0.0001) for RBP,
and R2 = 0.90 (P < 0.0001) for CRP. The system shows high
accuracy in predicting biomarker concentration based on the fit-
ting curve. Detailed information about calibration functions can
be found in Table S1. The fitting curve for ferritin shows good
linearity within the whole physiological range (15∼200 ng/mL
or 32∼421 pmol/L). The fitting curve for CRP indicates a mod-
erate saturation effect at higher concentration (>3 µg/mL or
120 nmol/L); however, no hook effect was observed in this study.
For the RBP assay we optimized it to maximize its capabil-
ity to distinguish VAD (RBP <14.7 µg/mL or <0.70 µmol/L)
and thus compromised on its performance in quantifying RBP
concentrations higher than 25 µg/mL (1.19 µmol/L), which still
falls in the healthy range, as we expand upon in the follow-
ing section.
TIDBIT System Performance Evaluation. Performance of the system
was evaluated by comparing the concentration of the biomarkers
acquired by the TIDBIT system and concentration of biomark-
ers determined with laboratory standard ELISA kits, as shown in
Fig. 4 A–C, in Bland–Altman plots. Linear regression (Figs. S6–
S8) is also applied for each biomarker. Predicted results from
the TIDBIT system are highly correlated with results from the
standard method. Compared with a perfect match with regres-
sion coefficient (RC) equal to 1, the ferritin assay shows RC
close to a perfect match at +1.06 (σ = 0.03, P < 0.0001), with
root-mean-square error (rmse) at 14.4 ng/mL (32 pmol/L) and
R2 at 0.92, while the CRP assay has RC at +1.03 (σ = 0.04,
P < 0.0001), with rmse at 0.65 µg/mL (26 nmol/L) and R2 at
0.88. For the RBP test, because it is a competitive assay and we
optimized the RBP assay to maximize its accuracy around the
diagnostic threshold (14.7 µg/mL or 0.70 µmol/L), the test line
intensity remains low at higher RBP concentration (>25 µg/mL
or 1.19 µmol/L) as expected. For samples with actual RBP con-
centration less than 25 µg/mL (1.19 µmol/L), the RBP assay has
RC at +0.97 (σ = 0.05, P < 0.0001), with rmse at 4.34 µg/mL
(0.21 µmol/L) and R2 at 0.56. Samples with RBP values above
the quantitative range are excluded from Fig. 4B. The TIDBIT
system yielded a sensitivity and specificity at 88% (95% CI 47.3–
99.6) and 97% (95% CI 85.0–99.9) for ferritin, 100% (95% CI
39.7–100.0) and 100% (95% CI 90.9–100.0) for RBP, and 80%
(95% CI 55.5–99.7) and 97% (95% CI 84.2–99.9) for CRP. More-
over, to maximize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the system,
the cutoff for ID, VAD, and inflammation can be set to ferritin
concentration less than 27 ng/mL (60 pmol/L), RBP concentra-
tion less than 14.7 µg/mL (0.70 µmol/L), and CRP concentration
greater than 2.8 µg/mL (112 nmol/L). Under these conditions
the TIDBIT system then yielded a 100% (95% CI 59.0–100.0)
sensitivity and 95% (95% CI 81.3–99.3) specificity for ferritin,
100% (95% CI 39.7–100.0) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI 90.9–
100.0) specificity for RBP, and a 100% (95% CI 66.3–100.0) sen-
sitivity and 94% (95% CI 80.3–99.2) specificity for CRP. More

Cross-Binding and Limit of Detection Quantification. Cross-binding
is a factor that can cause potential error in multiplexed lat-
eral flow assays (30). With our multicolored fluorescent test
strips, it can be easily accounted for since the incorrect fluo-
rescence signal can be detected at the improper detection site.
To demonstrate the level of cross-binding in the TIDBIT sys-
tem we ran human serum tests with only one type of antibody
conjugation loaded on the incubation pad. The result is shown
in Fig. 5A. It shows that test lines capture only their target
biomarkers, proving that nonspecific cross-binding between anti-
bodies and markers is limited. Furthermore, to demonstrate that
cross-binding has only a small effect on readout, we tested lev-

els of cross-binding in 12 human serum samples, as shown in
Fig. 5B. For each sample, only one type of antibody conjuga-
tion was loaded, and the level of cross-binding was evaluated
as the ratio of the brightness value on the incorrect test lines
to the brightness value of the correct test line. Error bars indi-
cate the SD of the cross-binding level. As is shown, cross-binding
between all biomarker/test line pairs was limited to less than 2%
(Fig. S9).
We also evaluated the limit of detection for each biomarker,
as shown in Fig. 5 C–E. Since serum samples with very low lev-
els of ferritin, RBP, and CRP are hard to obtain, we used resus-
pended standard dried serum (Siemens, Inc.) to perform the test.
For each data point, eight test strips were used and the error bar
shows SD of the result. The nonzero readout for the ferritin and
CRP test line intensity at zero concentration indicates there was
some nonspecific binding on the corresponding test lines. Based

 on these results we determined that the TIDBIT system has lim-
its of detection lower than 10.9 ng/mL (24 pmol/L), 2.2 µg/mL
(0.10 µmol/L), and 0.092 µg/mL (3.7 nmol/L) for ferritin, RBP,
and CRP. The limit of detection for all of the biomarkers was
lower than the diagnostic threshold for both adults and children.
For children, an alternative form of the assay could also be devel-
oped to optimize sensitivity in their relevant range.
Discussion
Rapid immunoassay tests for multiple targets are challenging.
Current rapid diagnostic tests usually label multiple types of con-
jugation antibodies with the same optical tags (latex beads or col-
loidal gold nanoparticles), and thus cross-binding can be difficult
to distinguish. The adoption of a three-color fluorescent assay in
our device offers a direct advantage in that cross-binding can be
relatively easily spotted by observing the incorrect fluorescence
signal at a given test site.
In this paper we demonstrated a rapid point-of-care test for ID
and VAD by quantitatively measuring ferritin, RBP, and CRP
concentrations. The test is enabled by our TIDBIT system and
provides results in around 15 min. The system could have signifi-
cant impact in areas of the world with high instances of micronu-
trient deficiencies, by providing a rapid, easy-to-operate tool for
population-level micronutrient status surveys in situations where
both ID and VAD need to be diagnosed (1, 17, 31). If imple-
mented with on-strip blood separation, the system’s high sensitiv-
ity and specificity will allow it to be further applied to individual-
level assessment at point of care.
Materials and Methods
Antibody-fluorescence signal conjugation was prepared using Lightening-
Link Conjugation Kits (Innova Bioscience Ltd.). Test strips are based on HF180
cards (EMD Millipore). Serum samples were separated from whole blood
with a minicentrifuge (ChemGlass) at 2,000 × g for 10 min before tests were
performed. All human whole blood samples were obtained from a commer-
cial provider (Research Blood Components, LLC), and thus no consent proce-
dures are required for this project. Further details on Materials and Methods
are provided in SI Materials and Methods.
