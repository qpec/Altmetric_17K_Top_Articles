ABSTRACT
Background: The Mediterranean diet (MD) is widely recommended
for the prevention of chronic disease, but evidence for a beneficial
effect on bone health is lacking.
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the effect
of a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern [NU-AGE (New Dietary
Strategies Addressing the Specific Needs of the Elderly Population
for Healthy Aging in Europe)] on indexes of inflammation with
a number of secondary endpoints, including bone mineral density
(BMD) and biomarkers of bone and collagen degradation in a 1-y
multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT; NU-AGE) in elderly
Europeans.
Design: An RCT was undertaken across 5 European centers.
Subjects in the intervention group consumed the NU-AGE diet for
1 y by receiving individually tailored dietary advice, coupled with
supplies of foods including whole-grain pasta, olive oil, and a vitamin
D3 supplement (10 µg/d). Participants in the control group were
provided with leaflets on healthy eating available in their country.
Results: A total of 1294 participants (mean ± SD age: 70.9 ±
4.0 y; 44% male) were recruited to the study and 1142 completed
the 1-y trial. The Mediterranean-like dietary pattern had no effect
on BMD (site-specific or whole-body); the inclusion of compliance
to the intervention in the statistical model did not change the
findings. There was also no effect of the intervention on the urinary
biomarkers free pyridinoline or free deoxypyridinoline. Serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D significantly increased and parathyroid hormone
decreased (P < 0.001) in the MD compared with the control group.
Subgroup analysis of individuals with osteoporosis at baseline (site-
specific BMD T-score ≤ −2.5 SDs) showed that the MD attenuated
the expected decline in femoral neck BMD (n = 24 and 30 in MD and
control groups, respectively; P = 0.04) but had no effect on lumbar
spine or whole-body BMD.
Conclusions: A 1-y intervention of the Mediterranean-like diet
together with vitamin D3 supplements (10 µg/d) had no effect on
BMD in the normal age-related range, but it significantly reduced
the rate of loss of bone at the femoral neck in individuals with
osteoporosis. The NU-AGE trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT01754012.

a high intake of fruit, vegetables, nuts, unrefined cereals, and olive
oil; a moderately high intake of fish; a low-to-moderate intake
of dairy products; a low intake of meat; and a moderate intake
of alcohol (1, 2). Data from prospective cohort studies show
that greater adherence to an MD is associated with a significant
improvement in health status, including reduced total mortality
(2) and reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and
Parkinson and Alzheimer disease (3). Randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) confirm that the MD may protect against vascular
disease, although the quantity and quality of evidence available
are limited and highly variable (4).
There are few studies examining the association between an
MD and bone health [bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture
incidence] and the available data are conflicting (5). A review
of population-based studies, which focused on fracture as an
outcome (6), suggested that one of the modifiable risk factors for
bone health is adherence to an MD. This conclusion was based on
post hoc analysis of longitudinal data from 93,676 women aged
50–79 y at the start of the Women’
s Health Initiative study, which
reported that higher adherence to an MD was associated with a
lower risk of hip fractures (7). The authors are not aware of any
other RCTs investigating the effect of the MD on measures of
bone health, presumably due to the difficulties of undertaking
a dietary intervention that is long enough (i.e., minimum 1-y
duration) to be able to detect changes in BMD.
The primary outcome of this multicenter RCT [NU-AGE (New
Dietary Strategies Addressing the Specific Needs of the Elderly
Population for Healthy Aging in Europe)] was to examine the
effect of consuming a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern for
1 y on inflammatory response in elderly Europeans. In addition,
there were 15 prespecified secondary outcomes, including the
effect of the MD on bone health status (BMD and biomarkers of
bone and collagen degradation). The Mediterranean-like dietary
pattern was tailored individually to complement habitual dietary
patterns to maximize compliance.
METHODS
The NU-AGE trial was conducted in 5 European centers
(Bologna in Italy, Norwich in the United Kingdom, Wageningen
in the Netherlands, Warsaw in Poland, and Clermont-Ferrand in
France). A detailed description of the European Commission–
funded NU-AGE project has been reported elsewhere (8).
Ethics approval
Local ethical approval was provided by the Independent
Ethics Committee of the Sant’Orsola-Malpighi Hospital Bologna
(Italy), the National Research Ethics Committee–East of England
(United Kingdom), the Wageningen University Medical Ethics
Committee (Netherlands), the Bioethics Committee of the
Polish National Food and Nutrition Institute (Poland), and the
South-East 6 Person Protection Committee (France). All study
procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of
the Helsinki Declaration. All participants gave informed consent
before participating. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01754012).
Participants
Recruitment and selection criteria have been reported pre-
viously (9). Briefly, 1294 participants aged 65–79 y were
recruited through local advertisements, media publicity, and
general practitioner practices between April 2012 and January
2014 at the 5 recruitment centers. Study participants were free-
living and responsible for their own dietary choices. Ineligibility
criteria included any clinically diagnosed chronic disease, use of
corticosteroids or insulin medications, recent use of antibiotics or
vaccinations, recent change in habitual medication, presence of
food allergy or intolerance necessitating a special diet, presence
of frailty according to the Fried criteria (10), or malnutrition
[defined as BMI (kg/m2) <18.5 or >10% weight loss in
the previous 6 mo). Participants were randomly allocated to
the intervention or control group (1:1 allocation ratio) after
stratification by sex, age, frailty status (prefrail or nonfrail), and
BMI. Randomization was performed by entering the described
variables of a subject into a computer program that automatically
allocates and generates a unique ID code. Participants were
informed about their group after randomization. Technicians
performing laboratory analysis were blinded to the group
assignment, but researchers carrying out BMD measurements
were not blinded because of practical impossibilities, including
the fact that the participants themselves knew which group they
were in and were in a position to discuss this with researchers
while undergoing measurements.
Dietary intervention
Participants randomly assigned to the intervention group
received individually tailored standardized dietary advice in
order to meet the study dietary requirements, as described
previously (9). The NU-AGE food-based dietary guidelines
were based on nutrient reference values and food-based dietary
recommendations for older adults from each of the 5 countries
where the intervention took place, the modified MyPyramid
for Older Adults, and nutrient requirements from the European
Commission and the Institute of Medicine (9). The individually
tailored dietary advice, either given face-to-face or by telephone
by a trained dietician or research nutritionist, was administered
9 times during the year and supported by mail or e-mail. To
aid compliance, participants in the intervention group received
commercially available foods to help them meet the dietary
guidelines, including whole-grain pasta, olive oil, high-MUFA
and high-PUFA margarine, and low-fat, low-salt cheese in all
centers and frozen vegetable soup (in Italy only) and vitamin
D3 supplements. The reason for giving a low-dose vitamin D
supplement was not to “optimize” vitamin D status per se but
to minimize differences between study sites (which covered
North, South, East, and West Europe) in which habitual diet and
sunlight exposure could affect vitamin D status. In order to reduce
participant burden, 3-d food diaries were completed and unused
vitamin D3 supplements were returned at months 4 and 8 in order
to evaluate follow-up adherence and use of the provided foods.
Participants randomly assigned to the control group were asked
to continue with their usual diet for the year and only received a
generally available leaflet with national dietary guidance.
Compliance to the study protocol in both the intervention and
control groups was evaluated with 7-d food diaries at the start

and end of the 1-y intervention. A scoring system was developed
to measure adherence to the diet; 16 dietary components were
included, 12 for which the highest intakes were ideal (fruit,
vegetables, legumes, low-fat dairy and cheese, fish, lean meat and
poultry, nuts, eggs, olive oil, fluids, and vitamin D supplements),
2 for which moderate intake was ideal (whole grains and alcohol),
and 2 for which low intakes were ideal (salt and sweets).
Each component was scored proportionally from 0 to 10 and
contributed equally to the final score, which ranged from 0 to 160,
with a higher score representing better adherence to the diet. High
compliers were defined as participants whose change in the NU-
AGE index was ranked in the top 2 quintiles and low compliers
were those in the lowest 2 quintiles.
Outcome assessment
At baseline and after 1 y, trained nurses or researchers
measured whole-body BMD with the use of dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) according to standard protocols
and training [Discovery Wi; software version 2.3.1 Hologic,
Inc (Norwich, United Kingdom); Lunar iDXA; GE Health
Care; enCORE 2011 software version 13.6 (Bologna, Italy);
Discovery QDR, software version 3; Hologic, Inc. (Clermont-
Ferrand, France); Lunar Prodigy; GE Health Care; enCORE 2011
software version 13.6 (Wageningen, Netherlands, and Warsaw,
Poland)]. In addition, at 3 of the intervention sites (Italy, United
Kingdom, and Poland) BMD was assessed at predefined anatomic
regions, including the lumbar spine (L1–L4) and proximal femur
(including total hip and femoral neck BMD). Osteoporosis was
defined as a T-score of ≤ −2.5 SDs below peak bone mass (11).
Measurements of urine free pyridinoline and free
deoxypyridinoline
A complete 24-h urine collection was conducted at the
beginning and end of the intervention, and aliquots were
stored at −80°C until analysis. Free pyridinium cross-links in
urine were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), as described elsewhere (12). In brief,
the LC-MS/MS method quantified free pyridinoline (fPYD) and
free deoxypyridinoline (fDPD) simultaneously from a single-
sample analysis. fPYD and fDPD were calibrated with the
use of commercial standards (Immundiagnostik) and acetylated
pyridinoline as internal standard. Before LC-MS/MS analysis,
a solid-phase extraction procedure was carried out on urine
samples pretreated with hydrochloric acid. The acidified samples
were extracted with the use of cellulose-packed columns and
eluted with 0.2% heptafluoro-butyric acid in water. The inter-
and intra-assay CVs were ≤9.9% between the assay working
range of 2–200 nmol/L. fPYD and fDPD results obtained
from LC-MS/MS analysis were adjusted against urine creatinine
measurements, which was performed on the COBAS C501
analyzer (Roche). The inter- and intra-assay CV was ≤3.1%
across the assay working range (375–55,000 µmol/L).
Measurement of serum 25-hyroxyvitamin D and
parathyroid hormone
Concentrations of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D; i.e.,
25-hydroxyvitamin D2 plus 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3])
in all serum samples were measured at the laboratory of the
Cork Center for Vitamin D and Nutrition Research with the
use of a slightly modified version of the LC-MS/MS method,
which has been described in detail elsewhere (13) and is certified
by the CDC Vitamin D Standardization Certification Program
(14). The modifications were effected so as to reduce the total
run time per sample from 10 min in our existing method to
7 min in the current method, thereby increasing our efficiency
of analysis of the sample loads (see Supplemental Table 1 for
details of gradient and multiple-reaction-monitoring parameters).
The 3-epimer of 25(OH)D3 was chromatographically resolved
from 25(OH)D3, and the isotopically labeled d3-3-epi-25(OH)D3
was used as an internal standard to verify retention time and
separation of 3-epi-25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D3 in each sample run.
The mean intra-and interassay CVs of the methods were 3.9% and
6.5%, respectively, for 25(OH)D3 (using low, medium, and high
concentrations of 33.5, 49.2, and 86.2 nmol/L, respectively). The
mean intra-assay and interassay CVs of the method were 12%
and 7.1%, respectively, for 25(OH)D2 (using low, medium, and
high concentrations of 1.10, 6.57, and 13.9 nmol/L, respectively).
Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were mea-
sured at the Cork Center for Vitamin D and Nutrition Research
in all serum samples with the use of an ELISA (intact PTH; MD
Biosciences, Inc.) Intra-assay and interassay CVs were 3.0% and
5.1%, respectively (at a concentration of 47.7 and 52.6 pg/mL,
respectively).
Statistical analysis
The power calculation for the estimation of the required
sample size for this trial was based on a change in C-reactive
protein (CRP; as the primary outcome measure) of 0.6 mg/L
(SD: 4), which required a sample size of 1000 participants (2-
sided, 80% power, and 0.05 α). We increased this number to
1250 to account for an anticipated drop-out rate of 20%. A
previous study examining the effect of a dietary intervention and
consumption of fortified dairy products for 12 mo on spine BMD
in postmenopausal women observed changes of −0.045 g/cm2
in the control group, 0.008 g/cm2 in the calcium-supplemented
group, and 0.053 g/cm2 in the dietary intervention group (15).
On the basis of these data we would need 36 participants (18/
group) to observe an effect on spinal BMD (2-sided, 99% power,
and 0.05 α). This indicated that we had a sufficient number
of osteoporotic participants in our study to conduct stratified
analysis on the effect of MD on BMD.
The normality of the data for each variable was tested using
the Skewness-Kurtosis test. Baseline characteristics are presented
as means ± SDs or n (%) for categorical variables, and baseline
between-group differences were assessed by using independent-
sample t tests or chi-square tests. The effect of the intervention
on changes in BMD and bone biomarkers was assessed by
using linear mixed-effect models with participant included as
a random effect, time, treatment group, and time × treatment
group interaction as fixed effects, and the explanatory variables
study center, age, sex, baseline BMI, baseline calcium intakes,
and baseline 25(OH)D. Where we observed a significant time
× treatment interaction, we also tested if there was a study
center effect by including a 3-way time × treatment × study
center interaction term in the model. For each variable, values
<3 or >3 SDs from the mean were considered outliers and
removed. We also conducted sensitivity analysis repeating the

main analysis with outliers included in the data set. Because data
were not normally distributed, the models were fitted on a log-
transformed scale. To account for multiple testing, we applied a
Bonferroni correction, with 8 tests/group (3 BMD measures and
5 biomarkers). We calculated the site-adjusted mean difference in
intake of dietary components associated with bone health using
ANCOVA. Data were analyzed with the use of Stata version 14
(StataCorp).
RESULTS
Of the 1294 participants recruited to the NU-AGE study,
n = 1142 completed the study (11.7% drop-out rate) (Supple-
mental Figure 1). Of these completers, n = 562 in the control
group and n = 555 in the intervention group had whole-body
DXA scans at baseline and follow-up and complete covariate
data (97.8%). There were no significant differences in baseline
characteristics between the 2 groups (Table 1). Osteopenia
(defined as a lumbar spine T-score of <−1.5 SD below peak bone
mass) was present in 37% and osteoporosis (defined as a lumbar
spine T-score of <2.5 SDs below peak bone mass) was present in
8% of participants at baseline.
After the 1-y dietary intervention, there was no effect on BMD
at any bone site (Table 2) or on the concentrations of urinary
fDPD and fPYD or the fDPD to fPYD ratio (Table 3). There
was a significant (P < 0.001) time × treatment interaction in
change in serum 25(OH)D over the 12 mo (Table 3), where the
mean concentration significantly increased in the intervention
group (4.5 ng/mL; 95% CI: 3.9, 5.1 ng/mL) but was unchanged
in the control group (0.5 ng/mL; 95% CI: −0.1, 1.0 ng/mL)
(P < 0.01). There was a significant (P < 0.001) time × treatment
interaction in change in serum PTH over the 12 mo, where the
mean concentration increased in the control group (3.9 pg/mL:
95% CI: 2.1, 5.6 pg/mL) but there was no significant change in
the intervention group (−1.4 pg/mL: 95% CI: −3.1, 0.4 pg/mL)
(P < 0.001) (Table 3). There was no effect of study center
for serum 25(OH)D (P = 0.049) or serum PTH (P = 0.755).
Including outliers in the data set did not markedly alter the results
(data not shown).
When examining the subgroup of participants diagnosed with
osteoporosis at baseline (n = 54), there was a 0.9% difference
between the groups in the change in femoral neck BMD (Table 2);
BMD increased in the intervention group (0.008 g/cm2; 95% CI:
−0.001, 0.018 g/cm2) and decreased in the control group (−0.009
g/cm2; 95% CI: −0.018, −0.001 g/cm2) (P = 0.04). No effect of
study center was observed (P = 0.415). The intervention had no
effect on BMD measured at the lumbar spine or the whole body.
We observed no change in compliance to the diet measured
at baseline and follow-up in the control group (1.9 points; 95%
CI: −0.4, 4.2 points) but an increase of 23.3 points (95% CI:
21.0, 25.6 points) in the intervention group (P < 0.001) (data not
shown). With regard to changes in specific dietary components
associated with bone health, we observed a significant increase in
intakes of olive oil, low-fat dairy, and calcium in the intervention
group relative to controls (Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
In one of the first long-term intervention studies examining
the effect of the MD on BMD, we found that consumption of
an MD with 10 µg vitamin D3/d reduced the rate of femoral
neck bone loss, but not total body or spinal BMD loss, in elderly
people with osteoporosis. There were no beneficial changes in
BMD in individuals with BMD in the normal range at baseline.
Recruitment was undertaken on a rolling basis, but because the
study had a duration of exactly 1 y, the baseline and final measures
could be directly compared without having to take into account
seasonal effects on vitamin D status or other measurements.
There is conflicting evidence from cross-sectional studies
examining the association between the MD and BMD, and a
lack of consistency with regard to the BMD sites that are most
affected. In Chinese adults aged 40–75 y, higher scores for
adherence to an MD, adapted for China, were positively and
dose-dependently associated with higher BMDs at the whole
body, lumbar spine, total hip, femur neck, trochanter, and

intertrochanter, but not the Ward’
s triangle area (2.41–3.96%
higher; quintile 5 compared with quintile 1; all P < 0.001),
after adjustment for age and sex (16). Higher intakes of whole
grains, fruit, and nuts and a lower intake of red and processed
meat were independently associated with higher BMD at several
bone sites, but vegetables, legumes, fish, the MUFA to PUFA
ratio, and moderate alcohol consumption showed no independent
associations with BMD in this study.
In Finnish women aged 65–71 y (17), the lumbar spine,
femoral neck, and total BMD were not significantly different
across the Baltic sea diet or MD quartiles. In addition, there were
no significant associations of the Baltic sea diet and MD quartiles
in the subgroup with osteoporosis. A study in 220 Greek women
(mean ± SD age: 48 ± 12 y) found no link between adherence to
an MD and bone mass, but when principal components analysis
was used to differentiate 10 dietary patterns, a high consumption
of fish and olive oil and a low intake of red meat were positively
associated with lumbar spine BMD (18). A study in 200 pre- and
postmenopausal Spanish women showed that a higher habitual
intake of fruit, vegetables, and nuts was associated with higher
total body BMD in postmenopausal women (19). A smaller study
in 87 Italians aged 70.1 ± 4.9 y also showed that adherence to
the MD was associated with a higher BMD (T-score assessed
by calcaneal quantitative ultrasound of the midcalcaneus) with
the lowest adherence observed in the 15% of subjects with
osteoporosis (20).
Although it is not possible to draw conclusions about cause
and effect from cross-sectional data, an association between
the MD, or some components of the diet, and bone health is
reported in some studies. To our knowledge, no previous dietary
intervention studies in elderly people have reported the effect
of the MD on BMD. Therefore the NU-AGE RCT provides an
important opportunity to clarify the relation. Our multicenter
trial results showed that consumption of an MD (together with
vitamin D supplements) for 1 y had no effect on BMD (whole-
body or site-specific) in older people without osteoporosis, and
even when we included the degree of compliance to the dietary
change in the statistical model this did not change the findings
(Supplemental Table 2). Subgroup analysis, however, showed a
significant beneficial effect of the MD plus supplemental vitamin
D3 on femoral neck (but not lumbar spine or whole-body) BMD
in subjects identified at baseline as having osteoporosis.

Phenolic compounds, as found in virgin olive oil, are suggested
as one of the components of the MD responsible for the effect on
bone; the proposed mechanism is modulation of the proliferative
capacity and cell maturation of osteoblasts through increased
alkaline phosphatase activity and deposition of calcium ions
in the extracellular matrix (21). An RCT reported that the
consumption of an MD enriched with virgin olive oil for
2 y was associated with an increase in the bone biomarkers
for bone formation, serum osteocalcin, and procollagen 1 N-
terminal propeptide (P1NP) concentrations in elderly men (22).
This indicates that the MD increases bone formation rather than
decreases resorption. In our dietary intervention, we provided
virgin olive oil to the intervention group to encourage subjects
to consume more olive oil. Baseline olive oil intake was highest
in Italy (9.6 ± 0.4 g/d) and lowest in France (2.1 ± 0.4 g/d),
and although there were no significant differences in intakes
between the countries, the greatest changes in intakes were
observed in France (6.0 g/d) and the lowest in Italy (1.0 ±
0.5 g/d). A reduction in sodium intake, as undertaken in the
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet study
(23), may be one of the consequences of consuming an MD (with
reduced processed-meat intake and increased intakes of fruit and
vegetables), and this has been reported to have beneficial effects
on bone health through a reduction in urinary calcium excretion
(24). However, because of the difficulties of accurately measuring
sodium intake, we did not attempt to evaluate the effect of sodium
intake on BMD. Similarly, for other dietary components that
may affect bone turnover, such as vitamin K, we were unable to
include them in our model due to the lack of reliable intake data.
Although osteoporosis is a widely accepted risk factor for
bone fracture, the evidence for a protective effect of the MD on
the risk of fracture is conflicting. Post hoc analysis of longitudinal
data (median follow-up of 15.9 y) from the US Women’
s Health
Initiative reported a lower risk of hip (but not total) fractures with
higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet in women aged 50–
79 y (7). Conversely, a smaller population-based study of shorter
duration (8 y) in France found that greater adherence to the MD
was not associated with a decreased risk of fractures in men
and women aged 67 y on recruitment (25). In a prospective
study in European men and women [European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)] with a mean age
of 48.6 y, followed for a median of 9 y, increased adherence to
an MD protected against hip fracture occurrence, particularly
among men (26). In the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea
(PREDIMED) trial, an observational cohort study nested in
the main trial found that a higher consumption of extra-virgin
olive oil was associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis-
related fractures in Mediterranean men and women, aged 55–
80 y, at high cardiovascular risk (21). As with the cross-sectional
studies cited above, the effect of the MD appears to be mediated
through particular dietary components, such as virgin olive oil.
In our study, subjects in the intervention group were given
vitamin D3 supplements (10 µg/d), and this resulted in a highly
significant increase in serum total 25(OH)D (P < 0.001) and a
highly significant reduction in PTH concentrations (P < 0.001)
in the whole intervention group (but not in the osteoporosis
subgroup) compared with the control group (Table 3). This may
be a question of insufficient power because the osteoporotic
subgroup was small. In this combined intervention design it
is not possible to disentangle the relative influence of the
MD and/or vitamin D on femoral neck BMD in osteoporotic
subjects. However, it is likely that the daily dose of vitamin D3
(10 µg) was too low to have a significant impact on bone loss.
MacDonald et al. (27) found that hip bone loss was attenuated
when vitamin D 3 supplements of 1000 IU (25 µg) were given
daily for 1 y to postmenopausal women, but 400 IU (10 µg)
had no effect. A systematic review of vitamin D supplementation
and risk of fractures concluded that vitamin D supplements of
700–800 IU (17.5–20 µg)/d appeared to reduce the risk of hip
and any nonvertebral fractures in ambulatory or institutionalized
elderly persons, but that a vitamin D dose of 400 IU (10 µg)/d
was not sufficient for fracture prevention (28). It is also worth
noting that the baseline serum 25(OH)D of the participants in
this RCT, at ∼25 ng/mL, exceeded that suggested by the Institute
of Medicine (i.e., 20 ng/mL) to cover the needs of nearly all
individuals from a bone health perspective (29). The Endocrine
Society, however, has suggested that to maximize the effect of
vitamin D on calcium, bone, and muscle metabolism, circulating
25(OH)D should be >30 ng/mL (30). This latter threshold was
only achieved in just under half of the intervention group in the
present RCT [mean serum 25(OH)D at endpoint: 29 ng/mL].
The strength of this study is that it was a long-term
(1-y) RCT carried out in a relatively large number (>1000) of
European men and women and designed to examine the effects of
a Mediterranean-like diet on various health variables, including
bone health. We acknowledge that we were not able to match
the control group on all aspects of the study, in particular with
regard to contact time with research staff; this did not affect
recruitment or attrition, which was the same in both groups,
but may have increased type 1 error. Our use of T-scores for
categorizing osteoporosis in both males and females with the use
of female normative databases may have led to underestimation
of osteoporosis in our male participants. A further limitation
is the relatively small size of the subgroup with osteoporosis.
The significant and interesting finding of differences in response
between individuals with BMD in the normal range and those
with osteoporosis needs to be verified in a future study.
In conclusion, our 1-y intervention showed that, in elderly
individuals (aged 65–79 y), a Mediterranean-like diet together
with vitamin D3 supplements (10 µg/d) had no effect on BMD in
the normal age-related range. However, it significantly reduced
the rate of loss of bone at the femoral neck in individuals with
osteoporosis.
