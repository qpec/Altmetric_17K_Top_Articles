ABSTRACT
Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer that is curable by surgical 
excision in the majority of cases, if detected at an early stage. To improve early stage 
melanoma detection, the development of a highly sensitive diagnostic test is of utmost 
importance. Here we aimed to identify antibodies to a panel of tumour associated 
antigens that can differentiate primary melanoma patients and healthy individuals. 
A total of 245 sera from primary melanoma patients and healthy volunteers were 
screened against a high-throughput microarray platform containing 1627 functional 
proteins. Following rigorous statistical analysis, we identified a combination of 10 
autoantibody biomarkers that, as a panel, displays a sensitivity of 79%, specificity 
of 84% and an AUC of 0.828 for primary melanoma detection. This melanoma 
autoantibody signature may prove valuable for the development of a diagnostic blood 
test for routine population screening that, when used in conjunction with current 
melanoma diagnostic techniques, could improve the early diagnosis of this malignancy 
and ultimately decrease the mortality rate of patients.

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, skin cancer remains a major health 
concern. The incidence of cutaneous melanoma, the most 
aggressive and treatment resistant type of skin cancer, 
continues to increase and New Zealand followed by 
Australia have the highest incidence rates [1]. Recent data 
shows that Australians are four times more likely to develop 
a cancer of the skin than any other type of cancer [2]. 
Detecting the primary melanoma tumours at an early stage 
results in a 5-year survival rate as high as 99%, whereas 
5-year survival for late stage patients is only 15–20% [3], 
indicating the importance of the timely diagnosis of this 
malignancy. A number of diagnostic screening methods 
are currently available for the detection of melanoma 
and include the visual examination of suspicious lesions 
using dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy, total 
body photography, teledermatology and mobile phone 
applications. However, all of these have limitations, 
including their high subject to observer bias. Moreover, 
it is questionable whether these methods are suitable for 
the screening of people at risk of melanoma development, 
such as patients with a substantial number of moles on 
their body (>100), those with a family history, cases of 
           Research Paper

occult melanoma, or those with very thin and unpigmented 
primary lesions [4]. 
A routine blood test used as an adjunct to currently 
utilised diagnostic approaches may enable improved 
melanoma screening diagnostic efficiency, especially 
in cases for which current diagnostic techniques are 
suboptimal. To date, many blood based biomarkers 
have been proposed for melanoma prognosis, indication 
of recurrence, and assessment of treatment response, 
including microRNAs [5], circulating tumour cells [6] 
and circulating tumour DNA [7]. However, none of these 
appear to be sufficiently sensitive to detect the initial 
transformation to malignancy and may therefore not be 
suitable diagnostic biomarkers of early stage melanoma. 
Autoantibodies (AAbs) may provide a more 
advantageous blood based biomarker, as they reflect the 
initial humoral immune response against a tumour and their 
increased levels can be detectable months to years prior 
to clinical evidence of a primary tumour [8]. While the 
mechanisms involved in the production of AAbs in cancer 
patients (reviewed recently in Zaenker et al. 2016 [9]), 
remain speculative, AAbs are well known to be sensitive 
biomarkers in the detection and surveillance of many types 
of tumours [10–14]. Their diagnostic utility in melanoma, 
however, is yet to be conclusively demonstrated. 
High-density protein microarrays allow the 
functional testing of thousands of proteins simultaneously, 
increasing the chance of discovery of new autoantibody 
signatures [15]. These microarrays, in which proteins are 
immobilised in their natural conformations, enable the 
identification of AAb profiles within patient sera [16]. 
Here we utilised the Immunome™ Protein Array containing 
1627 proteins, developed by Oxford Gene Technology, 
Oxfordshire, United Kingdom [17], to screen sera from a 
total of 124 early stage melanoma patients and 121 healthy 
volunteers. We utilised a novel approach to the statistical 
analysis of protein microarray data, in order to identify the 
most predictive panel of AAbs for melanoma diagnosis. 
First, we identified individual autoantibody biomarkers 
that were most commonly detectable in the patient cohort. 
Then, a random forest and classical classification tree 
analysis [18, 19] was performed to identify a panel of 10 
autoantibody biomarkers that in combination significantly 
differentiated primary melanoma patient sera from healthy 
control sera. We further investigated whether patient and 
tumour characteristics affected the breadth and magnitude 
of the serologic autoantibodies. Finally, we explored AAb 
biomarker associated disease related pathways using the 
STRING functional protein association network (Figure 1). 
RESULTS
Study cohort
The 245 samples used in the study comprised a 
total of 124 early stage melanoma patients (TNM stages 
in situ, I or II) and 121 healthy controls. The participant 
characteristics are summarised in Table 1. The number 
of males was higher than the number of females in both 
cohorts and in cohort 1, patients were slightly older 
than healthy volunteers (mean and standard deviation 
of 62.5 ± 16.3 versus 56.5 ± 12.9 years, p = 0.003). 
This was largely due to the difference in age of the male 
participants between patients and healthy volunteers (63.7 
± 14.7 versus 56.8 ± 13.2 years, p = 0.004). There was no 
significant difference in the mean age of female patients 
relative to female controls in cohort 1 (59.8 ± 19.4 versus 
55.7 ± 12.3 years, p = 0.309). 
Melanoma-associated AAb biomarkers
In cohort 1, a total of 748 antigens were identified 
to preferentially react with the patient sera as indicated 
by their positive biomarker scores. Of those, 139 resulted 
in biomarker scores of greater than 5 and were therefore 
considered to have a potential diagnostic value for 
melanoma (Supplementary Table 1.2). The majority of the 
identified 139 antigens displayed very high specificity, 
ranging from 86.7%–100% (mean of 97%), while their 
sensitivity as single biomarkers ranged from 2.9% to 
18.3% (mean of 9.9%), which is comparable to similar 
cancer AAb studies [20, 21]. Notably, 20/139 (14.4%) 
antigens did not react with any of the healthy control 
samples. 
The serum scores of melanoma patients (median 
60.5; IQR 33.9–95.9) were significantly higher than 
those for healthy controls (median 15.5; IQR 6.7–27.7) 
 
(p < 0.001, Figure 2A). To evaluate the diagnostic 
performance of the identified biomarkers in a different 
cohort of samples, we calculated the serum scores for the 
top 139 biomarkers using the 36 samples included in cohort 
2. Patient serum scores were again significantly higher, 
with a median of 51.1 (IQR 38.7–77.7) compared to healthy 
control median serum score of 38.9 (IQR 14.1–53.7, 
 
p = 0.029, Figure 2B), supporting the validity of the top 
139 biomarkers. 
Most of the identified markers are novel and are 
not known for their association with melanoma. It is 
however important to note that many were reactive against 
transcription factors, tumour suppressors and promoters, 
markers of apoptosis, and regulators of pigmentation 
and T-cell differentiation that may influence an array of 
cancer-related pathways. Some of the top 139 seroreactive 
antigens such as VEGFb, p53, MITF, KIT and MLANA 
[22] have previously been associated with melanoma and 
cancer in general, indicating that the detected autoantibody 
response may be derived from an antitumour response. 
The generated STRING protein association network 
of the top 139 antigens can be viewed in the Supplementary 
Figure 1 and a detailed table containing a short protein 
description and interaction scores is summarised in 
Supplementary Table 1.3 and Supplementary Table 2.5.

Supplementary Table 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 detail the 
biological functions, molecular pathways, cellular location 
and KEGG pathways associated with the submitted 
list of proteins. Interestingly, most of the seroreactive 
proteins are intracellular antigens (101/139), of which 
the majority are contained within the nucleus (88/139), 
a cellular location that is usually protected from immune 
surveillance. Many cancer autoantibody studies have 
also reported detection of AAbs against nuclear antigens 
and this has been suggested to be due to spillage of the 
intracellular contents into the surrounding tissue following 
cell death in cancer [9]. Nuclear antigens generally do 
not undergo cross-presentation in the negative selection 
process of B-cell maturation and may therefore result in 
enhanced immune reactions. Furthermore, the top 139 
identified biomarkers appear primarily related to general 
cancer pathways, including apoptosis, pathways associated 
with the immune response and cell cycle, p53 signalling 
and the MAPK signalling pathway, the main pathway 
associated with melanomagenesis, highlighting the 
biological relevance of the identified biomarkers.
AAb biomarker combination
Since the development of a diagnostic blood test that 
is comprised of 139 biomarkers is impractical and hence 
not clinically applicable, we utilised a two stage analysis 
approach involving random forest and classification 
tree analysis [18, 19] to identify a combination of 10 
biomarkers or less with the highest diagnostic potential. 
Following random forest analysis of the data 
from cohort 1, the top 20 most influential markers for a 
diagnostic model were identified, and the most important 
AAbs were given a rank score of 20 and the least important 
marker a score of 1. This analysis was repeated 1000 times 
to generate 1000 random forests. When the top 20 markers 
of each of these 1000 forests were combined, a list of 
27 unique biomarkers and their percent model inclusion 
frequency and average rank scores, were identified. The 
proportion of the appearance of each of these biomarkers 
in the 1000 top 20 AAb lists were then multiplied by 
the average rank score to obtain a weighted mean rank 
by which the overall importance of the biomarker for 
melanoma diagnosis was determined. In cohort 1, patient

serum scores for these 27 antigens were again significantly 
higher with a median of 10.2 (IQR 4.7–19.1), than the 
healthy control median serum score of 0 (IQR 0–1.6, 
 
p < 0.0001, Figure 3A). However, there was no significant 
difference between patient and controls serum scores 
in cohort 2 (median of 11.2 (IQR 6.2–22.0) versus 5.5 
 
(1.4–16.9), p = 0.176, Figure 3B), possibly due to the small 
sample size. Interferon regulator 4 (IRF4) was the most 
frequently included biomarker in the 1000 combinations 
and displayed the highest average rank score and was 
therefore the most important marker to contribute to the 
overall sensitivity and specificity in a combination of 
AAbs. As a single biomarker, IRF4 displayed a sensitivity 
of 5.8% at 100% specificity. 
Classification tree analysis was then applied to these 
27 biomarkers and showed that the best combination of 
biomarkers ensuring an increased combined sensitivity 
and specificity for melanoma diagnosis, is a signature of 
10 AAbs, including in order, ZBTB7B, PRKCH, TP53, 
PCTK1, PQBP1, UBE2V1, IRF4, MAPK8_tv2, MSN 
and TPM1, with a sensitivity of 79%, specificity of 84% 
and an AUC of 0.828 (Figure 4A–4C). The biomarkers 
included in the panel did not necessarily display the 
highest individual diagnostic potential (Supplementary 
Table 1.2). Instead, they are a combination, displaying a 
broader occurrence of positive seroreactivity for patient 
sera if a positive diagnosis is said to be represented by 
positive seroreactivity with at least one of the biomarkers 
in the combination. 
Breadth of autoantibody responses
The breadth of AAb responses against the protein 
microarray of 1627 proteins varied between samples.

Positive autoantibody production in a sample was defined 
as a fluorescence reading above the protein associated 
cutoff. Positive autoantibody production to at least one 
of the proteins was observed in every study participant 
sample in cohort 1. Out of the 1627 antigens on the array, 
patient sera reacted with a median of 46.0 (IQR 36.0–70.0) 
antigens while healthy control sera reacted with a median 
of 48.0 (IQR 40.5–57.0) antigens (p = 0.857). All patient 
samples and 92.4% of healthy control samples reacted 
with at least one of the top 139 antigens. In total, a sum 
of 1426 positive antibody responses against the top 139 
antigens were observed in the 104 patients while only 
434 positive antibody responses were observed in the 
105 healthy controls. A statistically significant difference 
was observed between the number of individual patient 
and healthy control sample AAb responses against the 
139 antigens (median of 9.0 (IQR 6.0–22.0) versus 3.0 
(IQR 1.0–4.0), respectively, p < 0.001). The median 
number of AAb responses was also significantly different 
between patient and healthy control samples (p < 0.001) 
for the identified AAb biomarker combination of 10 
autoantibodies, with patient samples displaying a median 
of 1.0 (range 0–3.0) when compared the control median 
of 0 (range 0–2.0). 
Patient characteristics 
Similar to other studies, we did not observe any 
significant differences or correlations in serum score 
or frequency of positive AAb reactions against the top 
139 antigens when comparing age, gender, TNM stage, 
site of primary tumour, melanoma subtype, Breslow 
thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, and history of multiple 
melanomas, non-melanoma skin cancers or other cancers 
(Supplementary Table 1.4). We did however observe a 
significantly lower number of AAb responses in patients 
with histologic regression features in their primary tumour 
than those who did not display features of regression 
(median and IQR of 7 (5.0–13.0) versus 11.5 (7.0–29.8), 
p = 0.010). 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The benefit of early melanoma detection and 
timely surgical excision of the primary tumour is clear. 
Despite advances in diagnostic methods, screening large 
populations for melanoma remains inefficient due to 
the time required to screen each individual and due to a 
plethora of other limitations clinicians face in the current

diagnosis of this cancer [4]. In particular, while individuals 
in countries with a high melanoma prevalence such as 
Australia and New Zealand are advised to maintain routine 
annual skin checks, there is no capacity for this practice 
given the limited number of dermatologists available in 
the country, especially in the rural regions in Australia 
[23]. Complementary diagnostic tools, such as blood tests, 
are needed to increase melanoma screening efficiency, 
provide diagnostic certainty and lower the overemphasis 
on invasive and expensive biopsies [24]. In fact, previous 
data has shown that only 5% of the total health care costs 
associated with melanoma are spent on the management 
of early melanoma disease including the costs of primary 
tumour diagnosis and excision, while the remaining 95% 
of all melanoma related health care costs are spent on the 
treatment and management of advanced melanoma [25], 
estimated to amount to $201 million annually in Australia 
[26]. Therefore, early detection and treatment could not 
only drastically improve patient 5-year survival rates to 
99% [3], but also lower the financial burden of the disease 
on the health care system.
As blood samples are easily accessible from patients, 
various types of blood-based biomarkers have already been 
proposed to be utilised in a blood test for melanoma [5–7, 
27], but none have yet demonstrated sufficient sensitivity 
to detect biological changes at the earliest stages of 
this malignancy. AAbs that bind to tumour-associated 
autoantigens, rise in serum levels at early disease stages, 
possibly due to a change in their expression, structural 
confirmation, presence of mutations or their release into the 
surrounding blood serum due to cancer cell lysis [9]. AAbs 
have already been shown to reside within the patient’s 
blood months to years prior to the clinical manifestation of 
the primary tumour [8, 28]. They have also been proposed 
to be valuable biomarkers for the early detection of many 
types of cancers and some are already being utilised in 
current diagnostic tests such as the EarlyCDT-Lung test 
for lung cancer detection and PAULA’s test for non-small 
cell lung cancer diagnosis [21, 29, 30]. In melanoma, AAbs 
have been suggested to be suitable prognostic biomarkers 
[31, 32], however very few studies have detailed their 
efficacy. In one study of an AAb signature for gastric 
cancer diagnosis, Zayakin and colleagues identified anti-
DDX53, anti-MAGEA3 and anti-MAGEC1 antibodies 
in two samples with advanced melanoma that were 
subsequently excluded from further analysis [20].
Notably, few studies have investigated the presence 
of AAbs in early stage melanoma [17, 32] and those that 
have, commonly investigate the presence of AAbs against 
a list of common melanoma-associated targets compiled 
from a search of the literature, screen a pool of samples 
or utilise cell lines without performing rigorous screening 
of the individual patient autoimmune repertoire against an 
unbiased array of proteins. Hence to our knowledge, this is 
the first study identifying AAbs as diagnostic biomarkers 
in a large cohort of primary melanoma patients compared 
to healthy volunteers using a high-throughput functional 
protein microarray platform. 
There are still no standardized guidelines for the 
analysis of protein microarray data. The approach stated 
by Gnjatic and colleagues, allowing the identification of 
biomarkers based not only on their fluorescent intensity 
levels but also their occurrence of positive seroreactivity 
in patients versus controls [17], appears to be utilised most 
frequently [33]. Using this approach in this study, we have 
successfully identified 139 potential melanoma diagnostic 
AAb biomarkers with individual sensitivity and specificity 
comparable to similar AAb studies [21]. Interestingly, most 
of the identified markers are novel and not known for their 
association with melanoma but are reactive against nuclear 
antigens such as transcription factors that may significantly 
influence cancer-related pathways. The inclusion of 
previously identified melanoma or cancer associated 
biomarkers such as VEGFb, p53, BAD, KIT MITF and 
MLANA [22] in the top 139 antigen list, further highlights 
the validity of our findings. Histologic tumour regression 
status significantly affected the number of positive AAb 
responses but although the correlation between regression 
and patient outcome has been investigated extensively, 
whether the presence of histologic regression features have 
a good or bad prognostic significance remains controversial 
and is to be elucidated [34]. Autoantibody responses were 
not affected by any other patient characteristic or tumour 
feature.
Most serum AAbs used as stand-alone diagnostic 
assays, show insufficient sensitivity and/or specificity 
to be utilised as accurate screening tools [35] and hence 
it is the combination of multiple reactive AAbs into a 
panel assay which provides the increased sensitivity 
and specificity. This approach has been successfully 
validated in several independent populations of various 
cancer types [36–39] as well as in this cohort of primary 
melanoma patients. To identify such combinations, here 
we proposed an analysis pipeline including random forest 
and decision tree analysis that adds to methods utilised 
by Gnjatic et al. 2009 [17], and enabled the identification 
of a 10 autoantibody biomarker signature with 79% 
sensitivity at 84% specificity for primary melanoma. One 
of these biomarkers is IRF4, a known lymphocyte specific 
transcription factor that negatively regulates Toll-like 
receptor (TLR) signalling, crucial for the activation of both 
the innate and adaptive immune response. Additionally, 
tumour suppressor p53 was included in the combination. 
In fact, the majority of research on autoantibodies in 
cancer has been focussed on p53 autoantibodies whose 
levels are commonly found to increase with cancer 
progression [40, 41], but are also detectable at early stages 
as in this study. 
Although this analysis repeatedly showed that the 
best combination for melanoma diagnosis in our cohort 
is the identified signature of 10 AAbs, it is important 
to remember that there may be many other possible

combinations of biomarkers generated using the list of 
139 top antigens that may prove valuable for melanoma 
detection and should be investigated in the future. Most 
importantly, the panel identified here must be validated 
using larger cohorts of melanoma patients and should 
include patients with other types of cancer or autoimmune 
diseases to ascertain whether the combination is melanoma 
specific. This may be performed using alternate high- 
throughput platforms for the simultaneous testing of these 
antigens against a vast number of samples to detect AAb 
levels, such as the bead-based Luminex platform.
Finally, since it is known that autoantigens that are 
modified before or during the course of tumour formation 
and progression in cancer, can stimulate the immune 
response in patients when they are released from tumour 
cells [42] and that immune responses have been observed 
to be responsible for tumour growth promotion, but also 
prevention in a process called immunoediting [43, 44], 
the fact that some of the top 139 biomarker associated 
signalling pathways are involved in the immune response, 
is consistent with the immunoediting theory [43] and leads 
to the proposal that the identified AAb biomarkers may 
be utilised in future therapeutic interventions to treat or 
monitor advanced melanoma and aid in the early diagnosis 
and surveillance of patients with melanoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study participants
A total of 245 study participants were recruited 
by collaborating clinicians and the principal researchers 
(minimum sample size required per group to achieve at 
least an AUC of 0.66 at an alpha of 0.05 and 80% power 
is n = 47 per group). All participants provided informed 
consent to participate in this study, previously approved by 
the Edith Cowan University Ethics Committee (numbers 
11543 and 12066). Patients were diagnosed by routine 
pathological examination of their excised primary tumour 
and staged according to the TNM staging system for 
melanoma according to the American Joint Committee on 
Cancer (AJCC) guidelines [3]. Healthy volunteers were 
defined as never having been diagnosed with melanoma, 
any other type of cancer or any autoimmune disease. The 
study cohort 1 consisted of 104 early stage melanoma 
patients (classified as TNM stages in situ, I and II) and 105 
healthy volunteers. A smaller cohort including 20 early 
stage melanoma patients (classified as TNM stages in situ 
and I only) and 16 healthy volunteers (cohort 2) was also 
utilised for validation. 
Sample collection
A once-off blood sample was obtained from all 
study participants. For the majority of melanoma patients, 
the sample was obtained within 1 month of patient primary 
tumour diagnosis and excision, some samples were 
obtained within a maximum of 3 months of diagnosis. 
Venous blood from all study participants was collected into 
one 8.5 ml serum separator tube (SST) (BD, New Jersey, 
United States). The blood was allowed to clot at room 
temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and centrifuged 
at 1600 g for 10 mins. A small number of healthy 
volunteer samples (n = 8) which had been collected into 
EDTA tubes were analysed from plasma. These samples 
were included in this study as serum and plasma samples 
have previously been found to yield comparable results 
in functional protein microarray studies [17]. Following 
centrifugation, serum was aliquoted as soon as possible 
but within 24 hours and stored at −80° C. 
Protein microarray profiling
The functional protein microarray was developed 
and constructed by Oxford Gene Technology (OGT), 
Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, as described previously 
[17]. Patient or control serum samples were diluted 
1:200 in 2 ml buffer (0.1% Triton X100 (v/v), 0.1% 
BSA (w/v) in PBS) and applied to the array (one array 
per sample). The arrays were incubated in Quadriperm 
dishes (Greiner BioOne, Stonehouse, UK) and placed on 
a horizontal shaker at 50 rpm for a period of 2 hours at 
room temperature. After several washes, anti-human IgG 
was diluted 1:1000 in assay buffer and Cy3-rabbit anti-
human IgG (Dako Cytomation) by incubation for 2 hours 
at room temperature according to the manufacturer´s 
recommendations. The array was washed again and dried 
by centrifugation. All arrays were scanned at 10 µm 
resolution using a microarray scanner (Axon 4200AL with 
GenePix Pro Software, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, 
CA, USA) and fluorescence of labelled IgG was detected 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Images were 
saved as 16-bit tiff files and analysis was performed using 
GenePix software [17]. Interaction between microarray 
antigens and serum autoantibodies was detected as 
fluorescence of the bound fluorescently-labelled IgG 
at the protein specific position on the microarray. The 
intensity of fluorescence is proportional to the amount 
of autoantibody present in the serum [17, 45]. Local 
background obtained from control spots on the array was 
subtracted automatically and relative fluorescence units 
(rfu) for each microarray spot were recorded. Each antigen 
was immobilised in quadruplicate on the array. The median 
rfu for the four readings of each antigen was utilised for 
further analysis. A reference serum was included in each 
microarray experiment run. Arrays that did not pass quality 
control tests were repeated or the spots were realigned in 
the software or excluded. Thereafter, arrays were excluded 
from the analysis if they did not pass quality control. 
Samples were tested by Sengenics, University of 
Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for the microarray 
screening of cohort 1 or by Oxford Gene Technology 
 Oncotarget
30548
www.oncotarget.com
(OGT), Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, for the microarray 
screening of cohort 2. Both locations utilised the same 
Immunome™ microarray platform (Sengenics). OGT 
and Sengenics staff were blinded to the fact that, for the 
purpose of cross-validation between the two screening 
sites, identical aliquots from 16 randomly selected patients 
and 11 healthy control samples were screened at both sites, 
and showed comparable results (Spearman rho > 0.5, 
Supplementary Table 1.1) enabling the use of cohort 2 as 
an independent validation cohort. 
Statistical analysis
Data normalisation
Intra- and inter-array data normalisation was 
performed to ensure data comparability between samples. 
First, the overall median value of all median rfu values of 
the 1627 printed proteins (excluding data from controls 
spots) was calculated and intra-array normalisation was 
achieved by dividing the median of the quadruplicate 
spots of each protein on the array, by the overall median 
value of all the proteins on the array in each sample. Inter-
array normalisation was achieved by utilisation of the 
normalize.quantiles package [46] in R. 
Selection of melanoma associated autoantibodies
Once normalised, data analysis was performed 
as described by Gnjatic et al. 2009 [17] to determine 
the proteins with the highest and most frequent 
seroreactivity in patient samples relative to healthy 
volunteer sera. For this, the interquartile range (IQR) 
was calculated for each protein to establish a cutoff. 
This cutoff (2.5 × IQR above the 75th percentile) was 
used to dichotomise the data, whereby a value was 
defined as positive (for seroreactivity) if it was above 
the cutoff; otherwise it was defined as negative. This 
criterion was used to ensure false positive data was 
minimised while providing increased specificity and 
sensitivity [17]. For cases with positive seroreactivity, 
the ratio between the signal and cutoff (S/C ratio) 
was calculated. Thereafter, the average S/C ratio was 
calculated per protein for each cohort, i.e. melanoma 
patient or healthy control. 
Finally, a “biomarker score” was assigned to each 
protein by multiplying the number of positive samples 
by the cubic root of the corresponding S/C ratio average 
for each cohort. This score is a reflection of the strength 
and frequency of the signal in patients relative to healthy 
subjects. The proteins were then ranked based on the 
differences in the biomarker scores (patients–healthy 
controls). A large AAb biomarker score (>5) indicates 
that most seroreactivity is attributable to the patients [17]. 
This reduced the number of potential diagnostic melanoma 
autoantibody biomarkers from 1627 to 139 in cohort 1 
(Supplementary Table 1.2). 
Selection of biomarker panel
The analysis proposed here furthers the methodology 
proposed by Gnjatic et al. 2009 [17] by subsequently 
exploring combinations of identified biomarkers for early 
melanoma detection, rather than individual biomarkers, 
to achieve increased combined sensitivity and specificity. 
The classification tree method was selected for this task 
and this analysis was performed using data from cohort 
1 only as cohort 2 was not sufficiently powered. The 
number of variables (i.e. 139 antigens) at this stage was 
still reasonably large relative to the overall sample size. 
To avoid the possibility of overfitting, a two-stage process 
was utilised, as follows:
Stage l involved the use of random forest regression 
analysis [18] for identifying key biomarker proteins and 
to further reduce the number of biomarkers in contention 
for the next modelling stage. Stage 2 utilised the classical 
classification tree approach [19] to develop a tree model 
based on the reduced list of biomarkers. 
All analyses were implemented with the R software 
package (Version 3.2.2). The key R packages used were 
randomForest [47] (based on the original Fortran code by 
Breiman and Cutler), rpart [48] and caret [49].
Additional statistical analysis
The previously established antigen-associated cutoffs 
were, additionally, used to determine (1) the number of 
positive AAbs (i.e. above the cutoffs) and (2) the serum 
score for each sample. The “serum score” is the sum of all 
signal intensities above the said cutoffs. To test whether 
these data were approximately normally distributed, a 
Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p > 0.05) [50], visual inspection 
of histograms, normal Q-Q plots and box-plots were 
performed. As the majority of the data in this study were 
not normally distributed, non-parametric methods were 
utilised. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to test for 
differences in serum scores between patients and controls. 
Spearman rho correlation analysis was used to test for a 
statistical relationship between patient age, tumour Breslow 
thickness and mitotic rate with the number of positive 
AAbs and patient serum scores. Differences in patient 
serum score or the number of positive AAbs with regards 
to gender, tumour ulceration, histologic regression, history 
of multiple diagnosed melanoma in the patient’s lifetime, a 
history of non-melanoma skin cancer or other cancer were 
assessed by Mann–Whitney U test. Serum score or number 
of positive AAb differences with regards to tumour TNM 
stage, primary tumour site, melanoma subtype and Clark 
level were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis. Sensitivity 
and specificity of individual and combinations of AAbs 
were evaluated by ROC. These analyses were performed 
using Microsoft Excel, IBM SPSS statistical software 
(version 22.0) and GraphPad Prism (version 5). A p-value 
of < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.

Finally, to explore the biological relevance of the 
identified autoantibody biomarkers and their interactions, 
we submitted the top 139 antigen names to the online 
functional protein association network, STRING, to 
explore the main shared antigen pathways at medium 
protein interaction confidence of 0.400. The submitted 
protein names are identical to Supplementary Table 1.2 
while protein PCTK1 and SDCCAD10 were searched by 
their alternative names CDK16 and CWC27, respectively.
