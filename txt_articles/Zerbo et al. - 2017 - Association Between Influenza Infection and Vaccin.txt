IMPORTANCE Maternal infections and fever during pregnancy are associated with increased
risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). To our knowledge, no study has investigated the
association between influenza vaccination during pregnancy and ASD.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between influenza infection and vaccination during
pregnancy and ASD risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study included 196 929 children born at
Kaiser Permanente Northern California from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010, at a
gestational age of at least 24 weeks.
EXPOSURES Data on maternal influenza infection and vaccination from conception date to
delivery date, obtained from Kaiser Permanente Northern California inpatient and outpatient
databases. Influenza infection was defined by the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes or positive influenza laboratory test results.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical diagnoses of ASDs identified by International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 299.0, 299.8, or 299.9
recorded in Kaiser Permanente Northern California electronic medical records on at least 2
occasions any time from birth through June 2015.
RESULTS Within this cohort of 196 929 children, influenza was diagnosed in 1400 (0.7%)
mothers and 45 231 (23%) received an influenza vaccination during pregnancy. The mean
(SD) ages of vaccinated and unvaccinated women were 31.6 (5.2) and 30.4 (5.6) years,
respectively. A total number of 3101 (1.6%) children were diagnosed with ASD. After adjusting
for covariates, we found that maternal influenza infection (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.04; 95%
CI, 0.68-1.58) or influenza vaccination (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.21) anytime
during pregnancy was not associated with increased ASD risk. In trimester-specific analyses,
first-trimester influenza vaccination was the only period associated with increased ASD risk
(adjusted hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.39). However, this association could be due to
chance (P = 0.1) if Bonferroni corrected for the multiplicity of hypotheses tested (n = 8).
Maternal influenza vaccination in the second or third trimester was not associated with
increased ASD risk.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There was no association between maternal influenza
infection anytime during pregnancy and increased ASD risk. There was a suggestion of
increased ASD risk among children whose mothers received an influenza vaccination in their
first trimester, but the association was not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple
comparisons, indicating that the finding could be due to chance. These findings do not call for
changes in vaccine policy or practice, but do suggest the need for additional studies on
maternal influenza vaccination and autism.

A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neu-
rodevelopmental disorder with unknown causes in
most cases. Previous studies suggest that genetic and
environmental factors play a role in the etiology of ASD.1-3
While some previous studies report no association be-
tween maternal infections during pregnancy and ASD risk,4-6
many recent epidemiological studies report an increased ASD
risk in association with maternal infections7-11 and fever dur-
ing pregnancy.12,13 Some studies examine infection timing, but
results have been mixed. First-trimester viral infection is as-
sociated with increased risk in some studies,7,9 while other
studiesreportsecond-orthird-trimesterbacterialinfection.7,9-11
Influenza viruses are prevalent worldwide, and it is esti-
mated that more than 200 000 people in the United States are
hospitalized each year for respiratory and heart conditions, ill-
nesses associated with seasonal influenza virus infections.14
Previous epidemiological studies on associations between in-
fluenza infection during pregnancy and ASD reported mixed
results. While 2 previous studies found associations between
maternal influenza and increased ASD risk,12,15 other studies
did not.8,11,13 However, we found that children conceived in
California during peak influenza infection months were at in-
creased ASD risk.16 Small sample sizes did not allow most pre-
vious studies to examine the timing of influenza infection dur-
ing pregnancy and ASD risk.
Influenza infection and influenza vaccination are associ-
ated with immune activation. Animal model studies show an
association between maternal immune activation during preg-
nancy and behavioral and brain abnormality in offspring, simi-
lartothoseobservedinchildrenwithASD.17-19Pregnantwomen
are encouraged to get vaccinated against influenza because
they face an increased risk of complications from the
infection.20 Studies show that influenza vaccination during
pregnancy reduces risk of a preterm birth, a small-for-
gestational-agechild,andalow-birth-weightchild,21,22andpre-
vents influenza infection in newborns for up to 6 months.23
However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the as-
sociationbetweenmaternalinfluenzavaccinationduringpreg-
nancy and ASD risk. This study’
s objective is to evaluate the
association between maternal influenza infection and vacci-
nation during pregnancy and ASD risk in a large cohort of chil-
dren born at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC).
Method
Study Population
The study population was drawn from the cohort of children
born during the period from January 1, 2000, to December 31,
2010 at KPNC, an integrated health care delivery organiza-
tionthatprovideshealthcaretoapproximately3.5millionresi-
dents (25%-30%) in metropolitan San Francisco and Sacra-
mentoandsurroundingcounties.KaiserPermanenteNorthern
California members are broadly socioeconomically represen-
tative of the population except for the extremes of income
distribution.24 Eligibility was restricted to singleton children
whowerebornatagestationalageofatleast24weeksandwho
remained health plan members until at least 2 years of age
(n = 196 929). Each study participant’
s mother was identified
from KPNC electronic medical records and data on maternal
exposures during pregnancy (eg, influenza infection and in-
fluenza vaccination), and covariates were extracted. The study
protocol was approved by the KPNC institutional review board
and the California State Committee for the Protection of
Human Subjects, which waived written consent for partici-
pants because our data-only study had no direct contact with
patients.
Maternal Influenza Infection and Influenza Vaccination
Data on influenza infection and vaccination during preg-
nancy were obtained from KPNC inpatient and outpatient da-
tabases.Influenzainfectionwasdefinedbythepresenceofany
1 of the following in the mother’
s electronic medical record
from conception date to delivery date: International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes
487, 078.8, 079.9, or 465.9 during the influenza season (from
October 1 to April 30) or a positive laboratory result for influ-
enza based on the Prodesse ProFlu+ Assay (Hologic), a multi-
plex real-time polymerase chain reaction in vitro diagnostic
test. Maternal influenza vaccination was defined as receipt of
aninfluenzavaccinationfromconceptiondatetodeliverydate.
Women who were dually exposed were considered exposed
in each analysis.
Four periods of influenza infection and influenza vacci-
nation exposure were defined: the first trimester (1-12 weeks
after conception), the second trimester (13-28 weeks after con-
ception), the third trimester (29 weeks after conception to the
deliverydate),andanytimeduringpregnancy(conceptiondate
to delivery date). The conception date was defined as the date
of the mother’
s last menstrual period plus 14 days. Women ex-
posed to multiple influenza infections or vaccinations were
counted in each corresponding period.
Autism Spectrum Disorders
Autism spectrum disorders are defined by ASD diagnoses (au-
tistic disorder, Asperger disorder, and pervasive develop-
ment disorder, not otherwise specified [International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes
299.0, 299.8, 299.9, respectively]) recorded in KPNC’
s pedi-
atric electronic medical records on at least 2 occasions from
birth through June 30, 2015.
Key Points
Question Is there an association between maternal influenza
infection and vaccination and autism risk?
Findings In a cohort study of 196 929 children, of whom 3103 had
austism spectrum disorder, maternal influenza infection during
pregnancy was not associated with increased autism risk. There
was a suggestion of increased risk of autism spectrum disorders
among children whose mothers received an influenza vaccination
during their first trimester, but the association was statistically
insignificant after adjusting for multiple comparisons, indicating
that the finding could be due to chance.
Meaning Our findings do not call for vaccine policy or practice
changes but do suggest the need for additional studies.

Covariates
Maternal and infant characteristics, obtained from KPNC pre-
natal and pediatric electronic medical records and state vital
statistics databases, adjusted the measure of association be-
tween maternal influenza infection and vaccination during
pregnancy and ASD risk in multivariate analyses. Covariates
included the child’
s sex, calendar conception year (categori-
cal variable), gestational age, maternal prepregnancy body
mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) (BMI < 18.5 = underweight; 18.5 ≤
BMI < 25 = normal weight; 25 ≤ BMI < 30 = overweight; BMI ≥
30 = obese), maternal age at delivery (younger than 20, 20 to
24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, and ≥ 35 years), maternal education at
delivery (≤ high school graduate, some college education, col-
lege graduate, postgraduate, or unknown), maternal race/
ethnicity (Asian, black, white, or other), and gestational dia-
betes(yes/no).Additionalcovariatesincludedmaternalasthma
(yes/no), hypertension (yes/no), autoimmune disease (yes/
no), and allergies (yes/no) recorded in the electronic medical
record before the conception date. All covariates were cho-
sen a priori because of their association with ASD in previous
studies25,26 or because they are indications for influenza vac-
cination.
Data Analysis
Toaccountfordifferentialfollow-uptimeuntilASDcouldbedi-
agnosed, we used a Cox proportional hazards regression model
to separately estimate the association between maternal influ-
enza infection or vaccination and ASD risk. We generated un-
adjusted Kaplan-Meier plots for ASD risk over time along with
the numbers at risk at discrete periods among children of vac-
cinated and unvaccinated mothers. The hazard ratio (HR) can
be interpreted as the risk ratio. The outcome of interest is ASD.
The censoring date was either the date of last membership in
the health plan if there was no ASD diagnosis, or the end of the
study period, June 30, 2015. For each exposure, we conducted
separate analyses for each period: the first trimester, the sec-
ond trimester, the third trimester, and anytime during preg-
nancy. For each analysis, the unexposed reference group was
defined as not having the exposure of interest at any time dur-
ing pregnancy. In all multivariable analyses, we included all of
the covariates already described plus the conception season
(winter, fall, spring, and summer) to control for influenza in-
fectionandvaccinationseasonality.Finally,weconductedapost
hoc analysis to adjust for multiple comparisons using the
Bonferronicorrectionandasensitivityanalysistodeterminethe
effect of potential unmeasured confounders.
Results
This study included 196 929 children born between 2000 and
2010. Influenza vaccination among pregnant women in this
cohort (45 231, 23%) increased from a low of 6% in 2000 to a
high of 58% in 2010. Compared with unvaccinated pregnant
women, vaccinated pregnant women were more likely to be
older and have a college education. Asthma, autoimmune dis-
ease,andhypertensionweremorelikelytobediagnosedinvac-
cinated women before conception, and gestational diabetes
was more likely to be diagnosed during the study pregnancy
(Table 1). In the 0.7% (1400) of cases in which influenza was
diagnosed in pregnant women, they were more likely to be
younger than the women who did not have influenza. These
women were also more likely to have the same health condi-
tions as vaccinated pregnant women (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). A small proportion of women were exposed to both in-
fluenza infection and influenza vaccination during pregnancy
(0.2%).
Follow-up time was between 2 and 15 years (median, 8.3
years; 25th percentile, 5.8 years; 75th percentile, 11.4 years).
By the end of the study, ASD was diagnosed in 3103 children
(1.6%). Compared with children without ASD, children with
ASDweremorelikelytobemaleandbornatlessthan37weeks’
gestation. Mothers of children with ASD were more likely to
be older at delivery and have a college or postgraduate edu-
cation. Asthma, autoimmune disease, and hypertension were
more likely to be diagnosed in these women before concep-
tion, as well as gestational diabetes during the study preg-
nancy (Table 2).
After controlling for maternal and child covariates, we
found that maternal influenza infection anytime during preg-
nancy was not associated with increased ASD risk (adjusted
HR [AHR], 1.04 [95% CI, 0.68-1.58]). There was also no asso-
ciation between maternal influenza infection during the first,
second, or third trimester and ASD risk (Table 3).
The unadjusted proportion of ASD was slightly higher
throughout follow-up among children of women who re-
ceivedinfluenzavaccinationsduringpregnancycomparedwith
children of unvaccinated women (Figure). After adjustment
for covariates, maternal influenza vaccination anytime dur-
ing pregnancy was not significantly associated with in-
creased ASD risk (AHR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.00-1.21]) (Table 3). Af-
ter adjustment for covariates, first trimester influenza
vaccinationwasassociatedwithanincreasedriskofASD(AHR,
1.20 [95% CI, 1.04-1.39], P = .01); however, adjusting for the
multiplicity of hypotheses tested (n = 8) using the Bonferroni
correctionsuggeststhatthisassociationcouldbeduetochance
(P = .10). Maternal influenza vaccination in the second (AHR,
1.03 [95% CI, 0.91-1.18]) and third (AHR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.90-
1.20]) trimesters was not associated with increased ASD risk
(Table 3).
In a sensitivity analysis, we found that if an unmeasured
confounderincreasedthepropensityofmaternalinfluenzavac-
cination during the first trimester and ASD risk by 30%, then
our observed HR of 1.2 associated with maternal vaccination
in the first trimester could be attributed to a combination of
bias and chance (eMethods and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Maternal influenza infection during pregnancy was not asso-
ciated with increased ASD risk in this study, and the associa-
tion did not vary by the timing of influenza infection. These
results are similar to our previous findings and 2 recent stud-
ies of no association between influenza infection during preg-

nancy and ASD risk.8,10,11,13 Our previous 2 studies were lim-
ited by small sample sizes and possible recall bias, which were
addressed in this study by using a larger sample size and elec-
tronic medical records. Our results are different from the
results in the small case-control study by Deykin and
MacMahon.15 They are also different from the results of
Atladóttir and colleagues,12 which were based on self-
reportedinfluenzainfectiondatacollectedfromwomenshortly
after they became pregnant. Our study population included
outpatient and inpatient influenza data with physician-
documented influenza diagnoses.
Self-reported infection data may be affected by overcount-
ing or undercounting, depending on severity and the moth-
ers’healthcareaccessandcare-seekingbehavior.Apooragree-
ment has been reported between hospital admission data and
self-reported respiratory illnesses, particularly influenza
infection.12 However, it is possible that medical records may
undercount influenza infections because some physicians dis-
courage patients from seeking their services for viral infec-
tions.Wedonotexpectphysicians’behaviorininfluenzatreat-
ment to differ with respect to child outcome, and thus our
results may be biased toward the null.
We found that influenza vaccination in the first trimester
was associated, in an initial analysis unadjusted for multiple
comparisons, with a slightly increased ASD risk after control-
lingformaternalallergy,asthma,autoimmuneconditions,ges-
tational diabetes, hypertension, age, education, race/
ethnicity, child conception year, conception season, sex, and
gestational age. However, adjusting for the multiplicity of
hypotheses tested suggests that the results could be due to
chance. If influenza vaccination during the first trimester of
pregnancycausesASD,ourresultssuggestthatitwouldamount
to 4 additional ASD cases for every 1000 women vaccinated.
Our finding of a possible association between maternal influ-
enza vaccination in the first trimester and increased ASD risk
parallelspreviousstudiesreportinganassociationbetweenma-
ternal viral infection7,9 or fever and increased ASD risk13 in the
first trimester.
Although vaccination induces an inflammatory response
during pregnancy, the magnitude and the duration of re-
sponse is much lower and shorter, respectively, for influenza
vaccinationthanviralinfection.27Likeinfection,influenzavac-
cination during pregnancy has been reported to induce a tran-
sient increase in the levels of a number of proinflammatory cy-
tokines, including interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor α, and
C-reactive protein.27-30 Studies on mice found an association
between high interleukin-6 levels during pregnancy and ab-
normal behavior and brain structure.19 However, in epidemio-
logical studies, associations between maternal cytokine lev-
els and ASD have been mixed. While an earlier study31 found
an association between elevated levels of C-reactive protein
inthesecondtrimesterandincreasedASDrisk,arecentstudy32
did not find an association between maternal C-reactive pro-
tein and increased risk of ASD after controlling for maternal
BMI. Elevated levels of interleukin 6 during pregnancy have
been associated with increased risk of developmental delays
but not ASD in one study33 and with increased ASD risk with
intellectual disability in another.34

Limitations
Our findings have several study limitations. Autism spec-
trum disorder status was determined by diagnoses recorded
in medical records and not validated by a standardized clini-
cal assessment for all cases. However, when 50 children
were evaluated with the Autism Diagnostic Interview–
Revised 35 and the Autism Diagnostic Observation
Schedule–Generic,36 94% met criteria for ASD on both
instruments, and 100% met criteria on at least 1
instrument.37 Record-review validation studies conducted
by the investigators demonstrate that the predictors of valid
ASD diagnoses were having more than 2 diagnoses in the

medical record.38 Most influenza infections in our study
were determined from International Classification of Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes
rather than serologic evidence. We were not able to review
medical records to verify the influenza cases defined by the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clini-
cal Modification codes. We also did not count subclinical
infections or illnesses for which women did not seek medi-
cal attention. We did not have records for women who
received their influenza vaccination outside KPNC facilities.
However, previous studies found that more than 89% of
KPNC members receive their seasonal influenza vaccination
at KPNC facilities.39 Although we controlled for major con-
founding factors related to influenza infection and vaccina-
tion and ASD, our results could result from unmeasured con-
founding factors that may be unknown or that we could not
fully measure. Although the study had a large sample size,
the number of exposed ASD cases was not large enough to
provide a stable statistical estimate of the trimester-specific
HR associated with influenza infection. Finally, our findings
may be due to chance because the results were statistically
insignificant after correcting for multiple comparisons.
Our study has several strengths despite the limitations, in-
cluding population-based identification of cases from a large
birth cohort and the use of prospectively collected informa-
tion on influenza infection and vaccination documented in
medical records. We were also able to examine risk associ-
ated with specific periods during pregnancy and to adjust for
several important covariates.
Conclusions
We found no association between ASD risk and influenza
infection during pregnancy or influenza vaccination during
the second to third trimester of pregnancy. However, there
was a suggestion of increased ASD risk among children
whose mothers received influenza vaccinations early in
pregnancy, although the association was insignificant after
statistical correction for multiple comparisons. While we do
not advocate changes in vaccine policy or practice, we
believe that additional studies are warranted to further
evaluate any potential associations between first-trimester
maternal influenza vaccination and autism.
