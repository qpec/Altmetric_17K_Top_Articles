Abstract
Background: Exercise is frequently suggested as a treatment option for patients presenting with symptoms of
subacromial impingement syndrome. Some would argue implementing a specific exercise strategy with special
focus on correction of kinematic deficits would be superior to general exercise strategy. There is however a lack of
evidence comparing such exercise strategies to determine which is the most effective in the treatment of
subacromial impingement syndrome. The aim of this review is to evaluate whether implementing specific exercise
strategies involving resistive exercises are more effective than a general exercise strategy for the treatment of
patients with subacromial impingement syndrome.
Methods: Randomized controlled trials were identified through an electronic search on PubMed/MEDLINE,
EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science and PEDro. In addition, article reference lists
and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched. Studies were considered eligible if they included interventions with resistive
specific exercises as compared to general resistance exercise. Four reviewers assessed risk of bias and
methodological quality guided by Cochrane recommendations. Results were synthesised qualitatively or
quantitatively, where appropriate.
Results: Six randomized controlled trials were included with 231 participants who experienced symptoms of
subacromial impingement syndrome. Four studies evaluated the effectiveness of specific scapular exercise strategy
and two studies evaluated the effectiveness of specific proprioceptive strategy. Five studies were of moderate
quality and one study was of low quality. No consistent statistical significant differences in outcomes between
treatment groups were reported in the studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) for pain was SMD −0.19 (95%
CI −0.61, 0.22) and SMD 0.30 (95% CI −0.16, 0.76) for function.
Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of specific resistive exercise
strategies in the rehabilitation of subacromial impingement syndrome. More high quality research is needed to
accurately assess this. This review provides suggestions on how to improve the methodological design of future
studies in this area.

 Background
Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS) is thought to
be the most prevalent disorder causing shoulder pain,
accounting for up to 50–70% of all shoulder complaints
in primary care [1–3]. The term shoulder impingement
syndrome was introduced by Neer to describe the patho-
logical state of the rotator cuff tendons resulting from
mechanical impingement [4, 5].
Subacromial impingement syndrome is a multifactorial
condition where intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of
rotator cuff pathology are the two main theories under-
lying SIS aetiology [6, 7]. Intrinsic factors affect tendon
morphology and performance over time. These factors
are influenced by genetic predisposition, age related
changes, poor
vascularity, biological alterations and
mechanical properties where the physiological limit of
the rotator cuff tendon(s) are surpassed [6–8]. Extrinsic
factors relate to anatomical structure and/or biomechan-
ical alterations causing mechanical compression [5, 7].
Anatomical structures include variations of the acro-
mion shape as well as osteoarthritic spurs on the suba-
cromial and
acromioclavicular
joints.
Biomechanical
alterations refers to the superior translation of humeral
head
and
altered
scapulohumeral
kinematics
often
caused by a weakness and imbalance of the rotator cuff
musculature and/or tendons opposing superiorly di-
rected shifts as well as postural dysfunction [5, 8–13].
This can present as external impingement with narrow-
ing of the subacromial space or internal impingement
within the glenohumeral joint space [6, 8, 13].
Alterations in shoulder kinematics are often observed
among patients with SIS [14–20]. The most common
documented deficits are alterations in scapulothoracic
kinematics [14, 16, 17, 20–26], humeral head displace-
ment within the glenoid cavity [14, 16, 27, 28] and in-
creased elevation and retraction of the clavicle in the
sternoclavicular joint during arm elevation [14, 21, 24,
29]. Postural dysfunction relating to increased flexion
and kyphosis of the thoracic spine cause alignment im-
pairments which are also said to interfere with shoulder
kinematics [16, 21]. These kinematic alterations are sug-
gested to contribute to narrowing of the subacromial
space (external impingement) which can affect biceps
tendons, rotator cuff tendons, subacromial bursa and
subtendinous bursa increasing the risk of joint inflam-
mation and tears associated with SIS [9, 14–16, 19].
Physiotherapists often tailor rehabilitation programs to
correct movement deficits, postural dysfunction and or
muscles weakness/imbalance in attempted to improve
characteristics of the subacromial space [16, 19, 21].
Exercise therapy has shown to reduce pain and improve
functional loss associated with SIS, however specific com-
ponents of exercise protocols are unknown [18, 30–34]. A
systematic review from 2012 concluded that a program
consisting of multiple types of exercises are effective in the
rehabilitation of SIS [32]. These programs consist of a com-
bination of scapular stabilization exercises, rotator cuff re-
sistance exercises, range of motion and stretching exercises.
Current evidence is however limited as to the which spe-
cific exercise(s) are most effective clinically [32, 35]. How-
ever, there is growing evidence to support the use of
resistance and proprioceptive exercises over movement
based exercises alone [18, 28, 32, 36]. A recent consensus
statement from 2013 recommended that scapular kine-
matic deficits should be addressed with specific exercises in
the rehabilitation of SIS [17]. This recommendation in-
cluded specific exercises strategies aimed to restore normal
scapular kinematics by improving the muscle activity,
strength, flexibility and balance in muscle force couples that
control scapular position and motion [14, 17, 37–39]. In
addition, Diedrichsen et al. [9] suggested that focus on mo-
tion awareness and strengthening of the scapular upward-
rotators and the rotator cuff should be part of a conserva-
tive rehabilitation program for patients with SIS.
An algorithm guideline on rehabilitation of shoulder in-
juries has been developed [18]. Recommendation for spe-
cific rotator cuff and scapular retraining includes muscle
activation sequencing, force couple activation, concentric
and eccentric control, strength, endurance and avoidance
of unwanted movement patterns [18, 40, 41]. Key principles
include obtaining flexibility in the muscles to reduce inhib-
ition of activation and execution of specific functional
movement or activity [18, 40, 41]. These specific strategies
are thought to improve scapular kinematics and thereby
ameliorate biomechanical conditions in the shoulder that
may reduce symptoms caused by SIS [18, 40, 41]. Despite
compelling research on exercise therapy and previous sys-
tematic reviews of the effectiveness of different exercise in-
terventions, recently published trials justify an updated
systematic review on the effectiveness of specific exercise
strategies such as stabilization, positioning, proprioception,
neuromuscular control, strengthening, stretching and cen-
tering of the humeral head. The aim of this review is to
evaluate the outcome differences in treatment of SIS when
comparing resistance training programs with and without
specific exercise strategy.
Methods
The reserach design and methodology for this literature re-
view was based on recommendations from the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions devel-
oped by the Cochrane Collaboration [42].
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in all
languages, investigating any approach of specific exer-
cises in patients with SIS were considered.
Shire et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:158 
Page 2 of 18
 Types of participants
Studies were included if participants were older than 18 years
and demonstrated the clinical pattern of SIS. Studies were
included that, according to examination, had participants
presenting with at least one of the following signs of SIS:
Pain with overhead activities; painful arc sign; positive Neer
impingement test, Hawkins test or Jobes test.
Trials were excluded if they recruited participants with
severe injuries including full thickness rotator cuff tears
adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), osteoarthritis, frac-
tures/dislocations, neoplasm, systemic inflammatory and
autoimmune disorders; infection, neurologic disorders or
pain relating to complex neck/shoulder disorders. Postop-
erative rehabilitation interventions were not considered.
Types of interventions
To be considered for inclusion trials must include resist-
ance exercises in both intervention and control group,
and one of the groups must investigate the effect of a spe-
cific exercise strategy. Specific exercise strategies can be
defined as exercise targeting the activation and coordin-
ation of scapulothoracic musculature and/or the dynamic
humeral stabilizers that encompass the shoulder joint. Ex-
ercise can include scapular stabilization, positioning, pro-
prioception, neuromuscular control, strengthening and
stretching. Exercises must involve a form of resistance
such as; body weight, elastic resistance, weighted appar-
atus, weights and/or machine weights.
Types of outcome measures
All outcomes were of interest. The primary outcomes
considered were pain and function measured using
shoulder-specific scales e.g. Western Ontario Rotator
Cuff Questionnaire (WORC) and Shoulder Disability
Questionnaire (SDQ). Quality of life (QoL), clinical tests,
range of motion (ROM), strength and proprioceptive
ability were considered as secondary outcomes.
Search methods for identification of studies
Two review authors conducted an electronic search of
1. PubMed (MEDLINE)
2. EMBASE
3. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL)
4. Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro)
5. Web of Science
The search strategy was constructed after consultation
with an academic health science librarian. The following
index and key free-text terms were used: shoulder, scap-
ula, subacromial, impingement, bursitis, tendinitis, ten-
donitis, rehabilitation, physiotherapy, physical therapy,
exercise and training. All key terms were searched
independently and then combined [42]. The search for-
mulas for each database are provided in Appendix 1. Re-
ports not indexed in the databases were manually
searched and detected. Furthermore, retrieved articles
and systematic reviews were screened for additional rele-
vant publications. A search in clinicaltrials.gov of recent
listed studies/unpublished articles was also performed.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (TS, AS) independently applied the
inclusion and exclusion criteria to screen the titles and
abstracts. Secondly, reviewers (TS, AS) retrieved the po-
tential eligible studies in full-text and evaluated the aim
and methods sections for final inclusion. Two other re-
viewers (JO, MD) compared article selection and re-
solved any disagreements by consensus. If disagreements
persisted, another review author was consulted (DC). All
six reviews (TS, AS, JO, MD, DC and JJ) read the eligible
studies in full-text and came to an agreement on the six
included studies.
Data extraction and management
Two pairs of review authors (AS, MD and TS, JO) inde-
pendently extracted data from the included studies.
Study characteristics regarding methods, participants, in-
terventions, outcomes and results were extracted using
standardized data extraction forms in preparation for ac-
curate analysis [43]. Original paper authors were con-
tacted to obtain more information if needed.
Risk of bias assessment
Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed by two
independently blinded groups of review authors (AS,
MD and TS, JO) and then compared and discussed by
all four reviewers.
Any disagreements were resolved by consulting a fifth
review author (DC). The level of inter-rater agreement
was recorded. Data extraction and evaluation of risk of
bias was conducted using Review Manager 5.3 [44].
Risk of bias was assessed by utilizing the 12 criteria
adapted by Cochrane from van Tulder et al. [45], Bou-
tron et al. [46] and Furlan et al. [43] The criteria were
used to validate characteristics of the studies that might
be related to reporting, selection, performance, attrition
and detection bias [42]. A pilot risk of bias assessments
was performed with similar articles to ensure consistent
interpretation of the criteria between reviewers.
In addition to the risk of bias assessment the reviewers
investigated other methodological considerations even
though it was not stated in the protocol e.g. sample size
and interim analyses. With reference to a Cochrane re-
view, sample size was considered inadequate if less than
50 participants per group and/or if power analysis was

 not applied and reported for relevant outcome measures
[47]. Groups should be adequately powered for detecting
a 20% relative difference in the relevant outcome. In this
process the review authors focused on six key domains
perceived crucial for a study’s methodological quality:
randomization, treatment allocation, intention-to-treat
analysis, compliance, drop-out rate and in addition to
this; other bias resulting in serious flaws. According to
these key domains the authors determined whether
each study had a high, unclear or low risk of bias (see
Table 1). Given the non-pharmacologic nature of in-
vestigated interventions contributing to difficulties
with blinding of care providers and patients, the review
authors chose not to focus on blinding as a key domain
[48]. Patients had knowledge of their intervention and
outcome measures were patient reported. For example
when assessing pain, patients act as outcome assessors
thus patient blinding is impossible. Ethical issues such
as the Helsinki declaration and consent create further
difficulties for patient blinding [49].
Best evidence synthesis
The quality of each individual study was rated. Included
RCTs were initially considered of high quality and then
downgraded on the basis of the key domains (see Table 2).
The effectiveness and level of evidence for each out-
come of interest across studies were evaluated by appli-
cation
of
“best
evidence
synthesis
guidelines”
as
presented in Dorrestijn et al. [50] modified from the one
proposed by Van Tulder et al. [45] (see Table 3). This
was used by the reviewers to determine whether each
outcome was of strong, moderate, limited or no/insuffi-
cient
evidence.
The
quality
classification
was
then
combined with evaluated evidence to determine the
strength of evidence for each outcome.
Data synthesis and analysis
Data analysis was conducted using Review Manager
(version 5.3) [44] of the Cochrane Collaboration and
consult of a statistician. Studies were included in the
quantitative analysis if the primary outcomes of interest,
pain and function, were descriptively comparable at
baseline and follow-up in regards to intervention, partic-
ipants, outcome measures and duration of follow-up.
Where possible the means and standard deviations data
pain and function of included studies were pooled into a
meta-analysis to give the overall summary of effect. Data
was converted and calculated to standardized mean
difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
for short term outcomes which ranged from 4 to
8 weeks.
A random effects model was used to determine the
overall effect size [42, 51]. An effect size of 0.8 or more
was regarded as a large effect size, between 0.5 and 0.8
as a moderate effect size and between 0.2 and 0.5 as a
small effect size [52]. Statistical significance was consid-
ered at p < 0.05.
Forest plots were used to illustrate effect sizes on pain
and function with 95% CIs and to summarize the pooled
effect. Funnel plots to identify publication bias were not
generated because of the small number of studies avail-
able for each analysis. For crossover trials only data from
the first period were included [53]. The outcomes mea-
sures of pain during movement and function were found
comparable across five studies [53–57]. The function
scoring scales were reversed in two studies [55, 57] for

 the adequate interpretation and to enable meta-analysis
of the data. To ease interpretation the function scores in
two studies were converted to 0–100 [56, 57] and in one
study the pain scores were converted to 0–10 [56].
The degree of heterogeneity was assessed by I2 statistics.
The I2 can be interpreted as the proportion of the ob-
served discrepancy in the estimation of the effect, within a
group of trials, which cannot be accounted for by random
variation [42]. Due to the low number of studies currently
available the authors did not restrict the inclusion of stud-
ies with high risk of bias. Review authors performed the
recommended sensitivity analyses in order to provide a
transparent conclusion [42]. The methodological factors
such as age, sex, intervention and the follow-up periods of
each study were investigated to explore and explain the
factors of heterogeneity.
Results
Selection of studies
Databases were searched within a 2-day period retro-
spective of inception to September 2015 with a subse-
quent update to June 2016. The initial database search
resulted in 1731 hits and the manual search in nine hits
(including reference search), which reduced to 1019 after
deletion of duplicates (Fig. 1). After screening titles and
abstracts, 961 studies were deemed irrelevant and ex-
cluded; whereas 58 studies were eligible for full-text
screening. The subsequent update yielded 1 eligible
study (Fig. 1). Overall a total of six that were deemed fit
for inclusion. Excluded studies are accounted for in Ap-
pendix 2 and characteristics of included studies are de-
scribed in Table 4. One ongoing study was identified in
clinicaltrials.gov (see Appendix 3).
Description of studies
Of the six included studies a total of 231 participants
were recruited [53–58]. Gender was reported for 211
participants, 136 women and 75 men; however, one
study did not report gender for eight participants [56],
another for two participants [58] and another for ten
participants [53]. Four studies included patients with SIS
and used similar clinical diagnosis criteria [53–55, 57].
One study included patients with SIS, but did not de-
scribe how diagnosis was made [58]. One study did not
clearly address SIS, but rotator cuff disease [56].
The sample size of all studies was small ranging from
16 to 63 subjects [53–58]. Duration of symptoms at
baseline were reported in five studies [53, 55–58], how-
ever, missing in one study [54].
Across the six studies the following outcomes were
measured; Pain (at rest, during activity, worst pain dur-
ing the last 24 h, during night), function and QoL
(WORC, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Stan-
dardized Assessment Form-self reported scale (ASES),
SDQ, Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF)),
strength and ROM [53–58]. Pain was measured using
the following instruments; visual analogue scale (VAS),
visual numeric scale (VNS), verbal numeric rating scale
(VNRS) or Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) [53–58].
All studies reported function [53–58].
Description of interventions
Two studies had similar intervention groups focusing on
specific proprioceptive exercises and centering of the hu-
meral head (positioning) [57, 58], one study compared
scapular specific exercises for the shoulder against

 general resistance exercises [55] and two studies com-
pared general resistance exercises for the shoulder
against the same program with the addition of specific
scapular stabilization and neuromuscular control exer-
cises [54, 56]. One study was designed as a crossover
trial where each group performed the same specific re-
sistance scapular stabilization and rotator cuff exercises
in a different sequence with follow-up at 4, 8, 12 and
16 weeks [53]. For the purpose of this review this study
was analyzed at 4 weeks/follow-up before execution of
crossover sequence [53]. Two studies reported measure-
ments after the intervention at 4 to 8 weeks [55] and
6 weeks follow-up [54]. One study reported on 4 and
8 weeks follow-up [56] and one study reported on 6 and
12 weeks follow-up [57]. The timeframe of follow-up
was unclear in one study [58].
Interventions of all studies lasted between 4 and
8 weeks [53–58], with one study encouraging partici-
pants to continue exercise at home for 6 weeks after the
intervention [57]. Frequency of interventions varied be-
tween trials: Three times per week [54, 57], twice per
week [56], once a day [53, 55] and twice a day [58]. Exer-
cise protocols included: scapular specific and neuromus-
cular exercises [53–58], strengthening exercises of the
shoulder and rotator cuff using gravity, TheraBand™ or
free weights as resistance [53, 54, 56–58], stretching and
flexibility exercises [54–58], proprioceptive training [54,
57] and general movement exercises [54, 57, 58]. One

 study selected exercises based on reported high electo-
myographical activity in target muscle groups [53].
In summary, all six studies investigated relevant
specific exercise strategies over a short term [53–58];
Four studies evaluated the effectiveness of specific
scapular exercise strategy [53–56] and two evaluated
the effectiveness of specific proprioceptive exercise
strategy [55, 57].
Risk of bias assessment and quality rating
The risk of bias in each study is presented in the
last column in Table 4 and the overall risk of bias
across studies is summarized in Figs. 2 and 3. Each
study
was
evaluated
on
12
risk
of
bias
criteria
equivalent to a total of 72 across included studies.
The review groups agreed on 55 out of the 72 cri-
teria. Final evaluation for eight risk of bias criteria
were resolved by consensus and the remaining nine
criteria were resolved by consulting a fifth review
author. Review groups agreed on all parameters re-
garding other bias.
The most common methodological deficiency was
small sample size. Randomization was performed in all
studies. Five studies described random allocation appro-
priately
[53–57];
whereas
one
study
had
unclear
randomization methods [58]. Another prevalent meth-
odological downfall is the lack of allocation concealment,
which was unclear in three out of six studies [53, 54,
56]. The drop-out rate was considered higher than ac-
ceptable in one study [56]. All studies analyzed par-
ticipants
by
intention
to
treat
principle
[53–58].
Selective outcome reporting was of high risk in one
study [55]. One study scored unclear for similarity of
groups at baseline [58]. Co-interventions were utilized
in all studies, but only two were low risk of bias [54,
55]. Four studies failed to report compliance [53–55,
57]. One study failed to address timing of outcome
assessment appropriately [55]. This study also failed
to specify stopping rules for the performance of their
interim analysis contributing to a high risk of bias
and a downgrade in evidence quality [55]. All studies
had inadequate sample sizes [53–58]. In summary,
all studies were deemed to have a high risk of bias
[53–58].
Best evidence synthesis
Five studies were deemed to be of moderate quality [53–
55, 57, 58] and one of low quality [56]. Specific exercises
were employed by all six studies [53–58]. The results for
overall effectiveness of specific exercise strategy on pain,
function, strength, ROM proprioception and other clin-
ical test were analyzed with best synthesis across out-
comes are summarized in Table 5.

 Pain
All studies investigated the short-term effects of exer-
cise on pain at 4 to 8 weeks follow-up using a range
the measurement scales; VAS, VNS, VNRS or NPRS
[53–58]. Pain was measured with one or in combin-
ation of the following: At rest, at night, with activity,
during the last 24 h and/or with function. There was
insufficient evidence to support that specific exercise
strategies are effective in reducing pain short term.
This is consistent with no statistically significant dif-
ferences between groups in four studies of moderate
quality [53, 54, 57, 58] and one study of low quality
[56]. In contrast, only one moderate quality study re-
ported a reduction in pain between groups with sig-
nificant statistical difference [55].
Function
All studies investigated function of the shoulder using
questionnaires to assess short-term symptoms, activities
of daily living and QoL experienced among participants
with SIS [53–58]. There is insufficient evidence that tai-
loring a specific exercise strategy can improve function.
Three studies of moderate quality utilized WORC, where
none of these studies found improvements between
groups [54, 57, 58]. Two studies of moderate quality
evaluated function using the ASES index and found no
effect between groups [53, 57]. One study of low quality
evaluated functional status using FLEX-SF and found no
difference between groups [56]. The results of one study
of moderate quality contradict the results of all other
studies by finding a statistical significant improvement
between groups when evaluating functional disability
status using SDQ [55].
Strength
Four out of six studies investigated isometric strength of
the shoulder using hand held dynamometer with differ-
ent approaches [53–56]; whereas one study used isokin-
etic dynamometer system [57]. Only one study of
moderate quality found a statistical significant difference
between groups [54]. Two other studies of moderate
quality [55, 57] and one of low quality [56] found no
statistical significant difference. One study only mea-
sured muscular strength at baseline [53].
One study of moderate quality found that implement-
ing specific exercises that focus on scapular stabilization
were effective to improve scapular muscles strength with
statistical significance between groups [54]. One study of
low quality found no difference [56]. Overall, there is
limited evidence to support the use of specific exercises
to improve scapular muscles strength.
Proprioception and clinical tests
There is conflicting evidence that a specific exercise
strategy can improve the clinical outcome measures of
proprioceptive ability and shoulder function. Only one
study of moderate quality investigated the effectiveness
of specific proprioception exercises [57]. Another study
of moderate quality implemented specific proprioceptive
exercises in their rehabilitation program, however, did
not address outcome measures and specify findings be-
tween the groups [58]. Two studies of moderate quality
focusing on scapular specific exercises provided incon-
sistent results [54, 55]. These studies were unable to
demonstrate an improvement for the clinical outcome
measures such as pain provocation test, acromial dis-
tance, pectoralis minor muscle length, joint position
sense and scapula scapular position and motion [54, 55].
Range of motion
There is no evidence a specific exercise strategy can im-
prove ROM. This is due to insignificant statistical find-
ings between the control and experimental groups in
three studies of moderate quality [54, 55, 57], one of
which only measured scapula motion and not general
shoulder ROM [55], and one study of low quality [56].
Two studies of moderate quality did not address out-
come measures of ROM [53, 58].
Quantitative analysis
Four of the six studies were eligible for inclusion in the
statistical pooling for pain [40, 53, 54, 56] and five of the
six studies were eligible for function [53–57]. The pool-
ing of data for strength, ROM and clinical tests were
deemed inappropriate due to the considerable variation
between measurement tools and outcomes used by all
the studies. Attempts to contact authors to provide fur-
ther
data
were
unsuccessful.

 included in the meta-analysis were few in number and
the true effect sizes varied between studies.
Pain
One study measured worst pain in the last 24 h [56] and
one study measured pain during active shoulder eleva-
tion [53]. These measurements were assumed to be pain
during movement and therefore included for statistical
analysis.
Pooling of statistical data demonstrated no significant
effect of specific exercise strategy on pain illustrated in
Fig. 4 (SMD–0.19 (95% CI −0.61, 0.22)). Heterogeneity
among the four included for pain outcomes [53–56] can
be interpreted as not important (I2 = 29%) [42]. The sen-
sitivity analysis revealed that heterogeneity for pain out-
comes greatly affected by one study [55]. When this
study [55] was removed from the analysis the degree of
heterogeneity improved (I2 = 0%) and the effect size was
reduced illustrated in Additional file 1: Figure S1.
Function
One study measured function with ASES and WORC
[57], but only means and standard deviations were re-
ported for the WORC. One study [58] was excluded for
both outcomes as pain was categorized without statis-
tical data and data for function was not provided at
baseline and follow-up.
Pooling of statistical data demonstrated no significant
effect of specific exercise strategy on function at 4 to
8 weeks follow-up and are illustrated in Fig. 5 (SMD
0.30 (95% CI −0.16, 0.76)). Only one study analyzed
function for a follow-up period of 12 weeks [57], how-
ever this did not influence the results with a repeat ana-
lysis of the data for 4 to 12 weeks follow-up.
Heterogeneity among the five studies for function out-
comes [53–57] can be interpreted as moderate [42]. The
amalgamation of the studies into different combinations
of three studies [53, 56, 57] and [54–56] resulted in im-
proved heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) illustrated in Additional
file 1: Figure S1. The results from the combination of
three studies did not favour the use of a specific exercise
strategy [53, 56, 57]. In contrast, a moderate effect size
was found in favour of specific exercise, when restricting
the
analysis
to
three
other
studies
[54–56].
Consequently, the sensitivity analysis for function out-
comes provide an unclear conclusion illustrated in Add-
itional files 2 and 3: Figures S2 and S3.
Discussion
The aim of this review was to evaluate whether imple-
menting specific exercise strategy focused towards the
treatment of SIS would result in a superior effect when
compared to general exercises strategy in a resistance
training program.
Six RCTs were extracted from a systematic search. Five
of the studies were of moderate quality [53–55, 57, 58]
and one of low quality [56]. All studies implemented a
resistive specific exercises strategy in the form of pro-
prioceptive, rotator cuff, scapular and stretching in dif-
ferent combinations. The qualitative results of this
review suggest no significant evidence to support the use
of specific exercises over general exercises in rehabilita-
tion programs aiming to be an effective treatment for
pain, function, ROM and strength in patients with SIS
symptoms.
The most common cause for downgrading quality was
the lack of adequate sample size which is found in all
analyzed studies [53–58]. This increases the probability
of inadequate equal distribution of participants with
randomization, lack of power, and risk for statistical
error [48]. Therefore, the ability to detect statistical sig-
nificance and derive clinical meaning is reduced lower-
ing overall confidence in the results of all studies [48].
Limitations such as poor intervention design and de-
scription limit transferability of protocols clinically. Un-
clear randomization [58] and allocation concealment
[54, 56] are both methodological problems that intro-
duce selection bias [42]. Unclear description and dosage
of exercise were especially apparent in two of the studies
[54, 56]. and in four studies it was unclear whether par-
ticipants engaged in co-interventions [55–58].
One study had a relatively high drop-out rate which
could underestimated efficacy of the intervention [56].
In contrast, applying simple imputation methods such a
last observation carried forward, as used in one study
[55], may introduce bias [48]. This could overestimate
the efficacy of the intervention, especially if patients only
are lost to follow-up in the comparative group. The

 compliance of participants was unclear in three studies
[54, 55, 57], which create uncertainty as to whether the
full intervention was received. Compliance is an import-
ant component of exercise as a treatment; therefore un-
clear reporting of compliance can make it difficult to
determine true effectiveness. Non-compliance in physio-
therapy interventions is as high as 70% [59]. Education
for the rationale and perseverance of an exercise pro-
grams may be beneficial for both patient compliance and
outcome measures [59].
The crossover design in one study employed the same
intervention in both groups with different temporal se-
quence [53]. Regardless of the exercise type and se-
quence,
both
exercise
strategies
contributed
to
improvements in pain and function experienced by the
subjects [53].
Most assessment tools utilized by included studies
were valid and reliable for assessing outcomes measures
among shoulder patients [53–58, 60, 61]. However, the
reliability for strength, ROM and other clinical tests can
be challenged and discussed. The variability of the clin-
ical assessments/measures for function created meth-
odological diversity among included studies. The tests
used to assess strength, ROM and proprioception with
scapular-specific tests in two studies [54, 55] are ques-
tionable as outcome measures for assessing the shoulder.
There is a lack of validity and reliability which limit the
clinical value of these tests [25, 60–62].
The results from the quantitative analysis for the pri-
mary outcomes of interest pain and function favour spe-
cific exercise strategies; however there was no significant
statistical evidence proving them as a superior treatment.
Analyses of the heterogeneity among the studies re-
vealed that inclusion and/or exclusion of one study [55]
pulled results in different directions. For analysis of spe-
cific exercise strategies on pain the combination of three
studies [53, 54, 56] resulted in zero heterogeneity and a
small effect size not in favour of specific exercises. For
function the combination of three studies resulted in
zero heterogeneity and a moderate effect size [54–56]. It
is difficult to pinpoint precisely which factors influence
this variation of heterogeneity and as to why different
combinations of studies result in a change of effect size.
This reduces the clinical significance of the result.
Disparity of clinical measures across all studies may be
one factor contributing to the variation of heterogeneity.
The deciding study [55] pulling results towards an ef-
fect of intervention presents methodological short-
comings when assessed using the Cochrane handbook
and CONSORT criteria [42, 48]. Speculation of poor
methodology and interventions cannot be dismissed
and care should be taken when drawing conclusions
estimating effect [42].
Attempts were made to improve the quality of evi-
dence by pooling data from the eligible included studies
for the quantitative analysis of pain and function. This
however did not strengthen the results of this review
and the conclusion remained affected.
Furthermore, all included studies were of high risk of
bias and although this was addressed with sensitivity
analysis strategies the inclusion of these studies in a
meta-analysis lower the quality of evidence and power of
this review [42]. Overall, this prevents a firm conclusion
to support the use of specific exercises in clinical practice.
Comparison with previous literature
Two previous systematic reviews investigated scapular-
focused treatment strategies including; scapular-exercise,
mobilisation techniques and taping in patients with suba-
cromial pain syndrome and found insufficient evidence to
support for the use of scapular-focused treatment [63, 64].
Similar to the results of this present review, both pre-
vious reviews found significant methodological limita-
tions among the available evidence [63, 64]. One review
[63] found the literature not to be supportive of different
scapular-focused treatment approaches for pain and
function; All studies investigated the short-term effects
of exercise on pain at 4 to 8 weeks follow-up; whereas
the meta analysis of one review found statistical, but not
clinically relevant benefit for the use of scapular-focused
treatment in the short term function [64]. These previ-
ous reviews have limited value for assessing the effect-
iveness of exercise as the exercises identified focused on
scapular position and movement disregarding evidence
that resistive exercises are superior [18, 28, 32, 63, 64].
Moreover, these previous reviews lack investigation of
proprioceptive exercise protocols which, in the review
authors’ opinion, is an important aspect of specific

 exercise strategy in rehabilitation programs aimed at
correction of movement and kinematics.
In contrast to previous reviews, this is the first system-
atic review specifically examining effectiveness of spe-
cific resistive exercises compared with general exercise
in the rehabilitation of patients with SIS.
One previous systematic review evaluate the role of
exercise in treating rotator cuff impingement and found
a strong suggestion that exercise improves symptoms in
patients with SIS [34]. This review included exercise
programs with components of home-exercises, manual
therapy and other modalities [34] and therefore does not
provide evidence supporting specific exercises as more
effective then general exercise interventions.
Previous recommendations from a consensus state-
ment, which supported the use of scapular rehabilitation
protocols within a comprehensive program to potentially
improve scapular muscle strength, shoulder symptoms
and alter scapular position [17], are not supported by
the results of this review.
A small number of studies were found comparing the
use of specific resistive exercise with movement-based
exercises without external resistance in rehabilitation of
SIS and were deemed unfit for inclusion [28, 40, 65–67].
Furthermore, other reviews offer evidence that resistance
training of any type is superior to movement based
training only [16, 18, 30, 32, 68]. Therefore, it would be
difficult to determine effectiveness of specific exercise
from these studies. One excluded study tested the effects
of a neurocognitive approach compared to traditional
therapeutic exercises in patients with SIS [66], and found
the neurocognitive approach to result in larger improve-
ment in shoulder function and pain [66]. Interestingly,
the traditional therapeutic exercise group engaged in
specific resistive exercises which focused on the rotator
cuff and scapular stabilizing muscles [66]. These findings
could indicate the need for consideration of different
styles of intervention for the treatment of SIS patients.
There is currently one completed upcoming RCT that,
with reference to the protocol registration at clinical-
trials.gov, could meet inclusion criteria of this review
(Elif Turgut NCT02286310) (Appendix 3). The protocol
description includes specific exercise therapy for patients
with SIS and scapular dyskinesia only, however the re-
sults of this upcoming RCT could be considered in fu-
ture investigations of specific exercise strategy.
Two recent Cochrane systematic reviews evaluating
the use of the motor control as a specific exercise strat-
egy among low back [69] and neck pain populations
[70]. Both studies suggest specific motor control exer-
cises, aimed at restoring control and coordination of
deep stabilizer muscles of the spine, were not superior
to more general exercise strategies [69, 70]. Both studies
conclude no single exercise strategy is superior to
another [69, 70]. In comparison to the results of this
present review similar conclusions could be drawn for
the use of specific exercises such as scapulothoracic, po-
sitioning, proprioceptive and neuromuscular control ex-
ercises for the treatment of SIS.
Strengths and limitations
As suggested by Cochrane, reviewers conducted a wide
systematic search strategy with high sensitivity and low
precision in order to detect all relevant articles [42].
Despite a comprehensive search process, reviewers col-
lected only six articles suitable for inclusion [53–58]. A
limited number of studies of moderate to low quality
may have contributed to an over or under estimated ef-
fect and thus prevents any clear conclusions. Moreover,
there are a relatively low number of participants in this
review and it should be noted that high quality RCTs
with adequate sample sizes might change the estimate of
effect. Wang et al. [56] did not clearly state the inclusion
of participants with SIS. It could be argued that this
study did not meet inclusion criteria and therefore ex-
cluded. One study could not be included in statistical
pooling for both pain and function as the presentation
of the results limited data extraction [58].
However, excluding this study would not have changed
the overall results and conclusion of this review. Limita-
tions such as the unclear definition of SIS combined
with the multifactorial nature of SIS could affect the re-
sults of this review [6, 7, 60, 61]. To ensure quality the
authors underwent several pilot-tests regarding risk of
bias assessment and data extraction. Moreover, reviewers
conducted this review based on guidelines from credible
sources [42, 48, 71].
Conclusions
Implications for practice
Despite compelling research on exercise therapy there
is insufficient evidence to either support or disprove
specific exercises strategies for treatment of patients
with SIS.
Due to inconsistencies and lack of high quality among
the available evidence, this review is unable to demon-
strate whether implementing specific exercises in a re-
habilitation program for patients with SIS is relevant for
clinical
practice.
Furthermore,
no
recommendations
about nature of exercises, frequency, dose and intensity
can be made.
Implications for further research
Future studies aiming to investigate specific exercise
strategies should aim to minimize potential bias by pre-
senting a clear methodological design for method of
randomization, allocation concealment, blinding etc.
This includes a clear description of inclusion criteria,
Shire et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2017) 18:158 
Page 13 of 18
 criteria for diagnosis of SIS, reproducible and transpar-
ent interventions and co-interventions. There is a need
for studies with larger sample sizes to ensure adequate
power to detect small inter-group differences. Moreover,
follow-up schemes over 6 months will aid to determine
long-term effects of the intervention.
If future trials find specific exercises to be effective
for the treatment of SIS, a dose-response effect is
needed to guide clinical practice in regards to fre-
quency, intensity, dosage (sets/repetitions), rest, tempo
manipulation, and whether programs should be indi-
vidualized or standardized.
