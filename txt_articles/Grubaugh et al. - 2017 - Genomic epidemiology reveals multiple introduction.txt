Zika virus (ZIKV) is causing an unprecedented epidemic linked to 
severe congenital abnormalities1,2. In July 2016, mosquito-borne 
ZIKV transmission was reported in the continental United States; 
since then, hundreds of locally acquired infections have been 
reported in Florida3,4. To gain insights into the timing, source, and 
likely route(s) of ZIKV introduction, we tracked the virus from 
its first detection in Florida by sequencing ZIKV genomes from 
infected patients and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We show that at 
least 4 introductions, but potentially as many as 40, contributed 
to the outbreak in Florida and that local transmission is likely to 
have started in the spring of 2016—several months before its initial 
detection. By analysing surveillance and genetic data, we show that 
ZIKV moved among transmission zones in Miami. Our analyses 
show that most introductions were linked to the Caribbean, a 
finding corroborated by the high incidence rates and traffic 
volumes from the region into the Miami area. Our study provides an 
understanding of how ZIKV initiates transmission in new regions.
ZIKV transmission in the Americas was first reported in Brazil in 
May 20155, although the virus was probably introduced 1–2 years 
 
earlier6–8. By January 2016, ZIKV cases had been reported in 
 
several South and Central American countries and most islands in 
the Caribbean9. Like dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus 
(CHIKV), ZIKV is vectored primarily by Aedes mosquitoes10–13. The 
establishment of the peridomestic species A. aegypti in the Americas14 
has facilitated the establishment of DENV, CHIKV, and now probably 
ZIKV as endemic in this region15. In the continental United States, 
transient outbreaks of DENV and CHIKV have been reported in 
regions of Texas and Florida4,16–21 with abundant seasonal A. aegypti 
populations14,22.
The 2016 ZIKV outbreak in Florida generated 256 confirmed ZIKV 
infections4 (Fig. 1a). While transmission was confirmed across four 
counties in Florida (Fig. 1b), the outbreak was most intense in Miami-
Dade County (241 infections). Although the case location could not 
always be determined, at least 114 (47%) infections are likely to have 
been acquired in one of three distinct transmission zones: Wynwood, 
Miami Beach, and Little River (Fig. 1c, d).
Using mosquito surveillance data, we determined the extent of 
 
mosquito-borne ZIKV transmission in Miami. Of the 24,351 mosqui-
toes collected from June to November 2016, 99.8% were A. aegypti and 
8 pools of ≤50 mosquitoes tested positive for ZIKV (Fig. 1c, Extended 
Data Fig. 1). From these pools, we estimated that approximately 1 out 
of 1,600 A. aegypti mosquitoes were infected (0.061%, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.028–0.115%, Extended Data Fig. 1a). This is similar 
to infection rates during DENV and CHIKV outbreaks23. Although 
we did not detect ZIKV-infected mosquitoes outside Miami Beach 
 
(Fig. 1c), we found that the number of human ZIKV cases correlated 
strongly with A. aegypti abundance within each transmission zone 
(Spearman r = 0.61, Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1b). This suggests that

A. aegypti mosquitoes were the primary mode of transmission and that 
changes to vector abundance affected human infection rates. We found 
that the application of insecticides3 suppressed mosquito populations 
during periods of intensive use (Extended Data Fig. 1c), and therefore 
probably contributed to ZIKV clearance.
We sequenced 39 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples 
without cell culture24 (Supplementary Table 1a). Our ZIKV dataset 
included 29 genomes from patients with locally acquired infections 
(Fig. 1d) and 7 from A. aegypti pools (Fig. 1c). We also sequenced 
three ZIKV genomes from travel-associated cases in Florida. 
Our dataset included cases from all transmission zones in Miami 
 
(Fig. 1d) and represented about 11% of all confirmed locally acquired 
cases in Florida. We made all sequence data openly available in the 
NCBI BioProject database (PRJNA342539, PRJNA356429) immedi-
ately after data generation.
We reconstructed phylogenetic trees from our ZIKV genomes 
along with 65 published genomes from other affected regions (Fig. 2, 
Extended Data Figs 2, 3). We found that the Florida ZIKV genomes 
formed four distinct lineages (labelled F1–F4 in Fig. 2a), three of which 
(F1–F3) belonged to the same clade (labelled A in Fig. 2a). We sampled 
only a single human case each from the F3 and F4 lineages, consistent 
with limited transmission (Fig. 2a). The other two Florida lineages 
 
(F1 and F2) comprised ZIKV genomes from human and mosquito 
samples within Miami-Dade County (Fig. 2b).
Using time-structured phylogenies25, we estimated that at least four 
separate introductions were responsible for the locally acquired cases 
observed in our dataset. The phylogenetic placement of lineage F4 
clearly indicates that it resulted from an independent introduction of 
a lineage distinct from those in clade A (Fig. 2a). For the two well- 
supported nodes linking lineages F1 and F2 (labelled B, Fig. 2a) and 
F1–F3 (A, Fig. 2a), we estimated the time of the most recent common 
ancestor (tMRCA) to be during the summer of 2015 (95% highest 
posterior density (HPD) June–September 2015). Our data displayed 
a strong clock signal (Extended Data Fig. 2b) and tMRCA estimates 
were robust across a range of models (Extended Data Table 1a). Thus, 
although lineages F1–F3 belong to clade A, any fewer than three distinct 
introductions leading to these lineages would have required undetected 
transmission of ZIKV in Florida for approximately one year (Fig. 2a).
To estimate the likelihood of a single ZIKV transmission chain 
persisting for more than a year, we modelled spread under different 
assumptions of the basic reproductive number (R0). Using the number 
of locally acquired and travel-associated cases, along with the number 
of observed genetic lineages, we estimated an R0 between 0.5 and 0.8 
in Miami-Dade County (Extended Data Fig. 4). Even at the upper end 
of this range, the probability of a single transmission chain persisting 
for over a year is extremely low (~0.5%, Fig. 2c). This is especially true 
considering the low A. aegypti abundance during the winter months 
(Extended Data Fig. 1d).
Given the low probability of long-term persistence, we expect that 
our ZIKV genomes (F1–F4) were the result of at least four introduc-
tions. Differences in surveillance practices and a high number of travel- 
associated cases (Fig. 1a), however, probably mean that unsampled 
ZIKV introductions also contributed to the outbreak. To estimate 
the total number of ZIKV introductions, we modelled scenarios that 
resulted in 241 locally acquired cases within Miami-Dade County and 
found that, with R0 values of 0.5–0.8, we expect 17–42 (95% CI 3–63) 
separate introductions to have contributed to the outbreak (Fig. 2d). 
The majority of these introductions would be likely to have generated 
a single secondary case that was undetected in our genetic sampling 
(Extended Data Fig. 4a). Incorporating under-reporting in a sensiti-
vity analysis increases R0 estimates slightly to 0.7–0.9 (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 4f–i).
The two main ZIKV lineages, F1 and F2, included the majority 
of genomes from Florida (92%, Fig. 2a). Assuming that they rep-
resent two independent introductions, we estimated when each of 
these lineages arrived in Florida. The probability densities for the 
tMRCAs of both F1 and F2 were centred around March–April 2016 
 
(Fig. 2b, 95% HPD January–May 2016). The estimated timing for 
these introductions corresponds with the presence of suitable 
 
A. aegypti populations in Miami-Dade County26 (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 1d) and suggests that ZIKV transmission could have started at 
least 2 months before its detection in July 2016 (Fig. 1a). The dates of 
the introductions could be more recent if multiple F1 or F2 lineage 
viruses arrived independently. However, more than two introductions 
would be necessary to substantially change our estimates for the tim-
ing of the earliest introduction.

To understand transmission dynamics within Miami, we analysed 
our genomic data together with case data from the Florida Department 
of Health (Supplementary Table 1a). Although the three ZIKV trans-
mission zones were spatially distinct, they occurred within about 5 km 
of each other (Fig. 1c) and the ZIKV infections associated with each 
zone overlapped temporally (Fig. 1d). Our ZIKV genomes with zone 
assignments all belonged to lineages F1 and F2, but neither of these 
lineages was confined to a single zone (Fig. 2b). In fact, we detected 
both F1 and F2 lineage viruses from A. aegypti collected from the same 
trap 26 days apart (mosquitoes 5 and 8, Fig. 2b). These findings suggest 
that ZIKV moved among areas of Miami.
Determining the sources and routes of ZIKV introductions could 
help to mitigate future outbreaks. We found that lineages F1–F3 clus-
tered with ZIKV genomes sequenced from the Dominican Republic and 
Guadeloupe (Fig. 2, Extended Data Figs 2, 3). By contrast, F4 clustered 
with genomes from Central America (Fig. 2, Extended Data Figs 2, 3). 
 
These findings suggest that whereas ZIKV outbreaks occurred through-
out the Americas, the Caribbean islands were the main source of local 
ZIKV transmission in Florida. Because of severe undersampling 
of ZIKV genomes, however, we cannot rule out other source areas. 
Similarly, even though we found that the Florida ZIKV genomes clus-
tered together with sequences from the Dominican Republic, our 
results do not prove that ZIKV entered Florida from this country.
We investigated ZIKV infection rates and travel patterns to cor-
roborate our phylogenetic evidence for Caribbean introductions. We 
found that the Caribbean islands bore the highest ZIKV incidence rates 
(Fig. 2b), despite Brazil and Colombia reporting the highest absolute 
number of cases (January–June 2016; Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 5, 
Supplementary Table 1b). During the same time period, we estimated 
that about 3 million travellers arrived from the Caribbean, accounting 
for 54% of the total traffic into Miami, with the vast majority (about 
2.4 million) arriving via cruise ships (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 6, 
Supplementary Table 1b). Combining the infection rates with travel 
capacities, we estimated that around 60–70% of ZIKV-infected trav-
ellers arrived from the Caribbean (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 7a). 
We also found that the number of travel-associated ZIKV cases cor-
related strongly with the expected number of importations from the 
Caribbean (Spearman r = 0.8; Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 7b). Finally,

67% of individuals with travel-associated infections in Florida reported 
recent travel to the Caribbean (Fig. 3e); however, their mode of travel 
is unknown. Together, these findings suggest that a high incidence of 
ZIKV in the Caribbean, combined with frequent travel, could have 
played a key role in the establishment of ZIKV transmission in Florida. 
These findings, however, do not indicate that cruise ships themselves 
are risk factors for human ZIKV infection, but only that they served as 
a major mode of transportation from areas with active transmission. In 
addition, ZIKV exposure may vary among individuals depending on 
their purpose of travel and therefore we cannot determine the specific 
contribution of ZIKV-infected travellers arriving via airlines or cruise 
ships.
The majority of the Florida ZIKV outbreak occurred in Miami-Dade 
County (Fig. 1b). To determine whether there is a higher potential for 
ZIKV outbreaks in this area, we analysed incoming passenger traffic 
from regions with ZIKV transmission along with local A. aegypti abun-
dance. We estimated that Miami and nearby Fort Lauderdale received 
around 72% of traffic (Fig. 4) and that Miami received more air and 
sea traffic from ZIKV-endemic areas than any other city in the United 
States (Extended Data Fig. 8). We estimated that, during January–April 
2016, A. aegypti abundance was highest in southern Florida22 (Fig. 4, 
Extended Data Figs 1d, 8). By June, most of Florida and several cities 
across the South probably supported high populations of A. aegypti14,22 
(Extended Data Fig. 8); however, most of this region has not reported 
local A. aegypti-borne virus transmission for at least 60 years19. In 
 
fact, the only region outside Florida with local ZIKV transmission is 
southern Texas27, which is also the only other region with recent DENV 
 
outbreaks19–21. Therefore, the combination of travellers, mosquito 
 
ecology, and human population density is likely to make Miami one 
of the few places in the continental United States at risk for A. aegypti- 
borne virus outbreaks22,26,28.
The extent of ZIKV transmission in Florida was unprecedented, with 
more reported ZIKV cases in 2016 (256) than DENV cases since 2009 
(136)4,16,17. This case difference may be reflected by lower incidence of

endemic DENV than epidemic ZIKV in source countries29,30, resulting 
in fewer DENV importations (reported travel-associated cases since 
2009: 654 DENV and 1,016 ZIKV)4. Given that the majority of ZIKV 
infections are asymptomatic2,31, the true number of ZIKV cases is likely 
to have been much higher. Despite this, we estimated that the average R0 
was less than 1 and therefore multiple introductions were necessary to 
give rise to the observed outbreak32. The high volume of traffic entering 
Florida from ZIKV-affected regions, especially the Caribbean, is likely 
to have provided a substantial supply of ZIKV-infected individuals33. 
Because Florida is unlikely to sustain long-term ZIKV transmission32, 
the potential for future ZIKV outbreaks in this region is dependent 
upon activity elsewhere. Therefore, we expect that outbreaks in Florida 
will cycle with ZIKV transmission dynamics in the Americas7,8,15.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments 
were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments and outcome assessment.
Ethical statement. This work was evaluated and approved by the relevant 
Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or Ethics Review Committees at The Scripps 
Research Institute (TSRI) and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious 
Diseases (USAMRIID) Office of Human Use and Ethics. This work was conducted 
as part of the public health response in Florida and samples were collected under 
a waiver of consent granted by the Florida Department of Health (DOH) Human 
Research Protection Program. The work received a non-human subjects research 
designation (category 4 exemption) by the Florida DOH because this research was 
performed with leftover clinical diagnostic samples involving no more than min-
imal risk. All samples were de-identified before receipt by the study investigators.
Florida Zika virus case data. Weekly reports of international travel-associated 
and locally acquired ZIKV infections diagnosed in Florida were obtained from 
the Florida DOH mosquito-borne disease surveillance system4. Dates of symp-
tom onset from the Miami transmission zones (Wynwood, Miami Beach, and 
Little River) determined by the Florida DOH investigation process were obtained 
from the ZIKV resource website34 and daily updates35. International travel- 
associated ZIKV case counts in the United States (outside Florida) were obtained 
from the CDC36. The local and travel-associated ZIKV case numbers for Florida 
were obtained from the Florida DOH. The one local ZIKV infection diagnosed in 
Duval County was believed to have originated elsewhere in Florida. Therefore, this 
case is listed as ‘unknown origin’ in Fig. 1b. In Fig. 3e, only the countries visited 
five or more times by ZIKV-infected travellers diagnosed in Florida are shown. 
Countries with fewer than five visits were aggregated into an “other” category by 
region (that is, Caribbean, South America, or Central America).
Clinical sample collection and RNA extraction. Clinical samples from locally 
acquired ZIKV infections were collected between 22 June and 11 October 2016. 
The Florida DOH identified persons with compatible illness and clinical samples 
were shipped to the Bureau of Public Health Laboratories for confirmation by 
qRT–PCR and antibody tests following interim guidelines3,37–39. Clinical specimens 
(whole blood, serum, saliva, or urine) submitted for analysis were refrigerated or 
frozen at or below −70 °C until RNA was extracted. RNA was extracted using 
the RNAeasy kit (QIAGEN), MagMAX for Microarrays Total RNA Isolation Kit 
(Ambion), or MagNA Pure LC 2.0 or 96 Systems (Roche Diagnostics). Purified 
RNA was eluted into 50–100 μl using the supplied elution buffers, immediately 
frozen at or below −70 °C, and transported on dry ice. The Florida DOH also 
provided investigation data for these samples, including symptom onset dates and, 
when available, assignments to the zone where infection was likely to have occurred 
(Supplementary Table 1).
Mosquito collection, RNA extraction, and entomological data analysis. 24,351 
A. aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes (sorted into 2,596 pools) were collected 
throughout Miami-Dade County during June–November 2016 using BG-Sentinel 
mosquito traps (Biogents AG). Up to 50 mosquitoes of the same species and sex 
were pooled per trap. The pooled mosquitoes were stored in RNAlater (Invitrogen), 
RNA was extracted using either the RNAeasy kit (QIAGEN) or MagMAX for 
Microarrays Total RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion), and ZIKV RNA was detected by 
qRT–PCR targeting the envelope protein coding region39 or the Trioplex qRT–PCR 
kit40. ZIKV infection rates were calculated per 1,000 female A. aegypti mosquitoes 
using the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)41. Days of insec-
ticide usage by the Miami-Dade Mosquito Control were inferred from the zone- 
specific ZIKV activities timelines published by the Florida DOH34.
Relative monthly Aedes aegypti abundance. For the purpose of this study we 
used A. aegypti suitability maps from ref. 14 and derived monthly estimates based 
on the statistical relationships between mosquito presence and environmental 
 
correlates42. Following ref. 43, we used a simple mathematical formula to transform 
the probability of detection maps into mosquito abundance maps. We assumed 
 
P(Y = 1) where Y is a binary variable (presence/absence). Using a Poisson distribu-
tion X() to govern the abundance of mosquitoes, the probability of not observing 
any mosquitoes can be related to the probability of absence as: P(X = 0) = P(Y = 0). 
We used the following transformation to generate abundance (λ) estimates per 
county in Florida:

We did not consider A. albopictus abundance in this study because 99.8% of 
mosquitoes collected in Miami-Dade County were A. aegypti. Relative A. aegypti 
abundance in major US cities presented in Extended Data Fig. 8 was estimated as 
previously described22.
Zika virus quantification. ZIKV genome equivalents (GE) were quantified by 
qRT–PCR. At TSRI, ZIKV qRT–PCR was performed as follows: ZIKV RNA 
 
standards were transcribed from the ZIKV NS5 region (nucleotides (nt) 8,651– 
9,498) using the T7 forward primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA 
TCAGGCTCCTGTCAAAACCC-3′), reverse primer (5′-AGTGACAACTTGTC 
CGCTCC-3′), and the T7 Megascript kit (Ambion). For qRT–PCR, primers and 
 
a probe targeting the NS5 region (nt 9,014–9,123) were designed using the ZIKV 
 
isolate PRVABC59 (GenBank: KU501215): forward primer (5′-AGTGCCAGAGC 
TGTGTGTAC-3′), reverse primer (5′-TCTAGCCCCTAGCCACATGT-3′), and 
FAM-fluorescent probe (5′-GGCAGCCGCGCCATCTGGT-3′). The qRT–PCR 
assays were performed in 25-μl reactions using the iScript One-step RT–PCR Kit 
for probes (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) and 2 μl of sample RNA. Amplification was 
performed at 50 °C for 20 min, 95 °C for 3 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 
57 °C for 10 s. Fluorescence was read at the end of the 57 °C annealing–extension 
step. Tenfold dilutions of the ZIKV RNA transcripts (2 μl per reaction) were used 
to create a standard curve for quantification of ZIKV GE per μl RNA. The lower 
limits of quantification are 4 GE per μl RNA, or at a cycle threshold of ~36.
ZIKV GE were quantified at USAMRIID using the University of Bonn ZIKV 
envelope protein (Bonn E) qRT–PCR assay44. RNA standards were transcribed 
using an amplicon generated from a ZIKV plasmid containing T7 promoter at 
the start of the 5′ untranslated region (UTR). The plasmid was designed using the 
ZIKV isolate BeH819015 (GenBank: KU365778.1) and the amplicon included 
nt 1–4,348, which covers the 5′ UTR, C, prM, M, E, NS1, and NS2 regions. The 
qRT–PCR assays were performed in 25-μl reactions using the SuperScript III 
platinum One-step qRT–PCR Kit (ThermoFisher) and 2 μl of sample RNA was 
used. Amplification was performed following conditions as previously described44. 
Tenfold dilutions of the ZIKV RNA transcripts (5 μl per reaction) were used to 
create a standard curve for quantification of ZIKV GE per μl RNA.
Amplicon-based Zika virus sequencing. ZIKV sequencing at TSRI was per-
formed using an amplicon-based approach using the ZikaAsian V1 scheme, 
as described24. This approach is similar to ‘RNA jackhammering’ to sequence 
low-quality viral samples described in ref. 45. In brief, cDNA was reverse- 
transcribed from 5 μl RNA using SuperScript IV (Invitrogen). ZIKV cDNA (2.5 μl 
per reaction) was amplified in 35 × 400-bp fragments from two multiplexed PCR 
reactions using Q5 DNA High-fidelity Polymerase (New England Biolabs). The 
amplified ZIKV cDNA fragments (50 ng) were prepared for sequencing using the 
Kapa Hyper prep kit (Kapa Biosystems) and SureSelect XT2 indexes (Agilent). 
Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) were used for all purification 
steps. Paired-end 251-nt reads were generated on the MiSeq using the V2 500 
cycle or V3 600 cycle kits (Illumina).
Trimmomatic was used to remove primer sequences (first 22 nt from the 
5′ end of the reads, which is the maximum length of the primers used for the 
multiplexed PCR) and bases at both ends with Phred quality score <20 (ref. 46). 
The reads were then aligned to the complete genome of a ZIKV isolate from the 
Dominican Republic, 2016 (GenBank: KU853012) using Novoalign v3.04.04 
(www.novocraft.com). Samtools was used to sort the aligned BAM files and to 
generate alignment statistics47. Snakemake was used as the workflow manage-
ment system48. The code and reference indexes for the pipeline can be found 
at https://github.com/andersen-lab/zika-pipeline. ZIKV-aligned reads were 
visually inspected using Geneious v9.1.5 (ref. 49) before generating consensus 
sequences. A minimum of 3 × read-depth coverage, in support of the consensus, 
was required to make a base call.
Enrichment-based Zika virus sequencing. ZIKV sequencing at USAMRIID 
was performed using a targeted enrichment approach. Sequencing libraries were 
prepared using the TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep kit (Illumina) with custom 
ZIKV probes. The set included 866 unique probes each of which was 80 nt in length 
(Supplementary Table 2a). The probes were designed to cover the entire ZIKV 
genome and to encompass the genetic diversity present on GenBank on 14 January 
2016. In total, 26 ZIKV sequences were used during probe design (Supplementary 
Table 2b). Extracted RNA was fragmented at 94 °C for 0–60 s and each sample was 
enriched separately using a quarter of the reagents specified in the manufacturer’s 
protocol. Samples were barcoded, pooled and sequenced using the MiSeq Reagent 
kit v3 (Illumina) on an Illumina MiSeq with a minimum of 2 × 151-bp reads. Dual 
indexing, with no overlapping indices, was used.
The random hexamer associated with read one and the Illumina adap-
tors were removed from the sequencing reads using Cutadapt v1.9.dev1 
(ref. 50), and low-quality reads or bases were filtered using Prinseq-lite 
v0.20.3 (ref. 51). Reads were aligned to a reference genome (GenBank: 
KX197192.1) using Bowtie2 v2.0.6 (ref. 52), duplicates were removed 
with Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard), and a new consensus

was generated using a combination of Samtools v0.1.18 (ref. 47) and custom scripts 
 
(https://github.com/jtladner/Scripts/blob/master/reference-based_assembly/ 
consensus_fasta.py). Only bases with Phred quality score ≥20 were used in 
 
consensus calling, and a minimum of 3 × read-depth coverage, in support of the 
consensus, was required to make a call; positions lacking this depth of coverage 
were treated as missing (that is, called as ‘N’).
Validation and comparison of sequencing methods. The consensus ZIKV 
sequences from FL01M and FL03M generated by sequencing 35 × 400-bp ampli-
cons on the MiSeq were validated using the following approaches: (1) sequencing 
the 35 × 400-bp amplicons on the Ion S5 platform (ThermoFisher); (2) sequencing 
 
amplicons generated using an Ion AmpliSeq (ThermoFisher) panel custom- 
targeted towards ZIKV on the Ion S5 platform; and (3) sequencing 5 × 2,150–2,400-bp 
 
ZIKV amplicons on the MiSeq. For Ion library preparation, cDNA was synthesized 
 
using the SuperScript VILO kit (ThermoFisher). ThermoFisher designed 875 cus-
tom ZIKV primers to produce 75 amplicons of ~200 bp in two PCR reactions 
for use with their Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0. The reagent FuPa was used to 
digest the modified primer sequences after amplification. The DNA templates 
were loaded onto Ion 520 chips using the Ion Chef and sequenced on the Ion S5 
with the 200-bp output (ThermoFisher). The 35 × 400-bp amplicons generated 
for the MiSeq as described above were introduced into the Ion workflow using 
the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit 2.0, but without fragmentation. Primers to amplify 
2,150–2,400-bp ZIKV fragments (Supplementary Table 2c) were kindly provided 
by S. O’Connor, D. Dudly, D. O’Connor, and D. Gellerup (AIDS Vaccine Research 
Laboratory, University of Wisconsin, Madison). Each fragment was amplified 
individually by PCR using the cDNA generated above, Q5 DNA High-fidelity 
Polymerase, and the following thermocycle conditions: 55 °C for 30 min, 94 °C 
for 2 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3.5 min, 68 °C for 
10 min, and held at 4 °C until use. Each PCR product was purified using Agencourt 
AMPure XP beads, sheared to 300–400-nt fragments using the Covaris S2 sonica-
tor, indexed and prepared for sequencing as described above, and sequenced using 
the MiSeq V2 500 cycle kit (paired-end 251-nt reads). Compared to the consensus 
sequences generated using 35 × 400-bp amplicons on the MiSeq, there were no 
consensus-level mismatches in the coding sequence using any of the other three 
approaches (Extended Data Table 2). There were, however, some mismatches in 
the 5′ and 3′ UTRs (where the genomic RNA is heavily structured), probably as a 
result of PCR bias and decreased coverage depth.
At least 95% of the ZIKV genome was covered from samples with as low as 4 
and 9 GE per μl RNA from the amplicon and enrichment approaches, respectively. 
These results are similar to our previously determined clinical range of 10–16 ZIKV 
GE per μl RNA to achieve at least 95% genome coverage using our amplicon-based 
approach24. On average, the amplicon-based sequencing approach covered 97% 
of the ZIKV genome (≥3 × read-depth) and the targeted enrichment approach 
covered 82% of the ZIKV genome from clinical samples (Supplementary Table 2d).

of the Asian genotype from the Pacific and the Americas were retrieved from 
GenBank public database in December 2016. Public sequences (n = 65) were 
codon-aligned together with ZIKV genomes generated in this study (n = 39) 
using MAFFT53 and inspected manually. The multiple alignment contained 104 
ZIKV sequences collected between 2013 and 2016, from the Pacific (American 
Samoa, French Polynesia, and Tonga), Brazil, other South and Central Americas 
(Guatemala, Mexico, Suriname, and Venezuela), the Caribbean (Dominican 
Republic, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Martinique, and Puerto Rico), and the United States 
(Supplementary File 1).
To determine the temporal signal of the sequence dataset, a maximum like-
lihood (ML) phylogeny was first reconstructed with PhyML54 using the general 
time-reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model and gamma distributed rates 
amongst sites55 (Supplementary File 1), which was identified as the best fitting 
model for ML inference by jModelTest256. Then, a correlation between root-to-tip 
genetic divergence and date of sampling was conducted in TempEst57.
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed using BEAST v.1.8.4 (ref. 25) 
to infer time-structured phylogenies. We used an SDR06 nucleotide substitution 
model58 with a non-informative continuous time Markov chain reference prior 
(CTMC)59 on the molecular clock rate. Replicate analyses using multiple com-
binations of molecular clock and coalescent models were explored to select the 
best fitting model by marginal likelihood comparison using path-sampling and 
stepping-stone estimation approaches60–62 (Extended Data Table 1b). The best fit 
model was a relaxed molecular clock along with a Bayesian Skyline model63. All 
the Bayesian analyses were run for 30 million Markov chain Monte Carlo steps, 
sampling parameters and trees every 3,000 generations (BEAST XML file and MCC 
tree available in Supplementary File 1). Support values for all nodes are embedded 
in the phylogenetic tree files (Supplementary File 1). Tree visualizations were gen-
erated with baltic (https://github.com/blab/baltic).
The travel-associated ZIKV genomes add to the Caribbean dataset, but do not 
directly influence our conclusions about the source of ZIKV introductions into 
Florida.
Expected number and distribution of local cases from Zika virus importations. 
We used branching process theory64,65 to generate the offspring distribution (sub-
sequent local cases) that is expected from a single introduction. The offspring 
distribution L is modelled with a negative binomial distribution with mean R0 
and over-dispersion parameter k. The total number of cases j that is caused by 
a single importation (including the index case) after an infinite time66 has the 
following form:

The parameter k represents the variation in the number of secondary cases gener-
ated by each case of ZIKV64. In the case of vector-borne diseases, local heteroge-
neity is high owing to a variety of factors such as mosquito population abundance, 
human–mosquito interactions, and control interventions67–72. Here, we assumed 
high heterogeneity (k = 0.1) following previous estimates for vector-borne 
 
diseases65. This distribution L is plotted in Extended Data Fig. 4a. For the follow-
ing, we took a forward simulation approach, drawing random samples from this 
distribution. All estimates were based on 100,000 random simulations.
We used this formula to estimate the probability of observing 241 local cases in 
Miami-Dade County alongside 320 travel-associated cases. We approached this 
by sampling 320 introduction events from L and calculating the total number of 
local cases in the resulting outbreak (Extended Data Fig. 4b). We also calculated 
 
the likelihood of observing 241 local cases in the total outbreak (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 4c), finding that the MLE of R0 lies between 0.35 and 0.55. As a sensitivity 
 
analysis, we additionally modelled introductions with the assumption that only 
50% of travellers were infectious at time of arrival into Miami-Dade County, result-
ing in an MLE of R0 of 0.45–0.8.
We further used this formula to address the probability of observing 3 distinct 
genetic clusters (F1, F2 and F3) representing three introduction events in a sample 
of 27 ZIKV genomes from Miami-Dade County. We approached this by sampling 
introduction events until we accumulated 241 local cases according to L, arriving 
at N introduction events with case counts (j1, j2, … jN). We then sampled 27 cases 
without replacement from (j1, j2, … jN) following a hypergeometric distribution 
and recorded the number of distinct clusters drawn in the sample. We found that 
higher values of R0 resulted in fewer distinct clusters within the sample of 27 
genomes (Extended Data Fig. 4d). We additionally calculated the likelihood of 
sampling three distinct genetic clusters in 27 genomes (Extended Data Fig. 4e), 
finding an MLE estimate of R0 of 0.7–0.9. Additionally, as a sensitivity analysis we 
modelled a preferential sampling process in which larger clusters are more likely 
to be drawn from than smaller clusters. Here, we used a parameter α that enriches 
the hypergeometric distribution following 
…

. In this case, we found an 
MLE estimate of R0 of 0.5–0.9.
Using the overlap of estimates of R0 from local case counts (0.35–0.8) and 
genetic clusters (0.5–0.9), we arrived at a 95% uncertainty range of R0 of 0.5–0.8. 
As an additional sensitivity analysis, we incorporated under-reporting in which 
either 50% of travel-associated cases and 25% of local cases are reported or in 
which 10% of travel-associated cases and 5% of local cases are reported. We found 
that differential reporting of travel and local cases resulted in increased mean R0 
estimates when comparing counts of travel-associated to local cases (Extended 
Data Fig. 4f, g). Additionally, under-reporting increased estimates of R0 from the 
sampling analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4h, i). Thus, moderate under-reporting is 
consistent with R0 estimates of ~0.8.
We additionally performed birth–death stochastic simulations assuming a serial 
interval with mean of 20 days15. We recorded the number of stochastic simulations 
still persisting after a particular number of days for different values of R0 (Fig. 2c).
Zika virus incidence rates. Weekly suspected and confirmed ZIKV case counts 
from countries and territories within the Americas with local transmission 
 
(1 January to 18 September 2016) were obtained from the Pan American Health 
Organization (PAHO)30. In most cases, the weekly case numbers per country 
were reported only in bar graphs. We contacted PAHO multiple times with 
the hope of gaining access to the raw data included in the bar graphs, but our 
requests were unfortunately denied. Therefore we used WebPlotDigitizer v3.10 
(http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer) to estimate the numbers. We compared 
the actual ZIKV case numbers reported in Ecuador73 (the only country with 
available raw data and reported cases over 10 per week) to our estimates from 
the PAHO bar graphs and found that the WebPlotDigitizer was ~99% accurate 
(Extended Data Fig. 5a, b).

Country and territory total population sizes to calculate weekly and monthly 
ZIKV incidence rates were also obtained from PAHO74. Incidence rates calculated 
from countries and territories in the Americas during January–June 2016 (based 
on the earliest introduction time estimates until the first known cases) were used 
as an estimate for infection likelihood to investigate sources of ZIKV introductions.
Airline and cruise ship traffic. To investigate whether the transmission of ZIKV 
in Florida coincided with travel patterns from ZIKV endemic regions, we obtained 
the number of passengers arriving at airports in Florida via commercial air travel. 
We collated data for flights arriving at all commercial airports in Florida from 
countries and territories in the Americas with local ZIKV transmission between 
January and June 2016 (based on the earliest introduction time estimates until 
the first known cases, Supplementary Table 1b). The data were obtained from the 
International Air Transportation Association, which collects data on an estimated 
90% of all passenger trips worldwide. Nelson et al.28 previously reported flight 
data from 33 countries with ZIKV transmission entering major US airports from 
October 2014 to September 2015, which we used to assess the potential for ZIKV 
introductions outside of Florida.
Schedules for cruise ships visiting Miami, Port Canaveral, Port Everglades, 
Fort Lauderdale, Key West, Jacksonville (all in Florida), Houston, Galveston 
(both in Texas), Charleston (South Carolina) and New Orleans (Louisiana) 
ports in the year 2016 were collated from www.cruisett.com and confirmed by 
cross-referencing ship logs reported by Port of Miami and reported ship sched-
ules from www.miamidade.gov/portmiami/. Scheduled cruise ship capacities 
were extracted from www.cruisemapper.com. Every country or territory with 
ZIKV transmission visited by a cruise ship 10 days (the approximate mean time 
to ZIKV clearance in human blood (that is, the infectious period))75 before arrival 
was counted as contributing the ship’s capacity worth of passengers to Miami to 
the month of arrival (Supplementary Table 1b). While the air traffic was based on 
the reported number of travellers, we estimated the sea traffic by ship capacity. 
Lee and Ramdeen76 reported that the average occupancy of cruise ships travelling 
to the Caribbean Islands exceeded 100% in 2011, and according to the Florida-
Caribbean Cruise Association77, it remained >100% in 2015. Occupancy data 
for 2016 was not available at the time of publication, but we assumed that it was 
also near 100%.
Expected number of travellers infected with Zika virus. We estimated the 
expected number of travellers entering Miami who were infected with ZIKV (λ) 
by using the total travel capacity (C) and the likelihood of ZIKV infection (infec-
tions (I) per person (N)) from each country/territory (i):
∑
λ =
C I
N
i

We summed the number of expected infected travellers from each country or terri-
tory with ZIKV transmission by region and travel method (flights or cruises). The 
number of ZIKV cases reported by each country are likely to be underestimates, 
in part because the majority of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic2,31. We nor-
malized some of the potential reporting variances between countries by reporting 
 
the data as the relative proportion of infected travellers (Fig. 3c, Extended Data 
 
Fig. 7a) and as the absolute number of infected travellers (Fig. 3d, Extended Data 
Fig. 7b, Supplementary Table 1b) from each region. We also accounted for potential 
reporting biases with incidence rates by using ZIKV attack rates (that is, propor-
tion infected before epidemic burnout) to estimate peak transmission intensity. 
Attack rates were calculated using a susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) trans-
mission model derived from seroprevalence studies and environmental factors as 
described78. Using attack rates as an estimate of infection likelihood, we predict 
that ~60% of the infected travellers entering Miami came from the Caribbean 
(Extended Data 7b), which is in agreement with our methods using incidence rates 
of ~60–70% (Fig. 3c). A list of countries and territories used in these analyses can 
be found in Supplementary Table 1b.
Maps. The maps presented in our figures were generated using Matplotlib79 and 
ESRI basemaps (www.esri.com/data/basemaps). The software and basemaps are 
open source and freely available to anyone.
Data availability. All ZIKV sequencing data are available under NCBI BioProjects 
PRJNA342539 and PRJNA356429. Individual sample GenBank access numbers

Extended Data Figure 1 | Miami-Dade mosquito surveillance and 
relative A. aegypti abundance. a, Mosquito surveillance data reported 
from 21 June to 28 November 2016 was used to evaluate the risk of ZIKV 
infection from mosquito-borne transmission in Miami. A total of 24,306 
A. aegypti and 45 A. albopictus were collected. Trap nights are the total 
number of times each trap site was used and the trap locations are shown 
in Fig. 1d (some ‘Other Miami’ trap sites are located outside the mapped 
region). Up to 50 mosquitoes of the same species and trap night were 
pooled together for ZIKV RNA testing. The infection rates were calculated 
using an MLE. None of the A. albopictus pools contained ZIKV RNA. 
b, The number of weekly ZIKV cases (based on symptom onset) was 
correlated with mean A. aegypti abundance per trap night determined 
from the same week and zone (Spearman r = 0.61). This suggests that 
when the virus is present, mosquito abundance numbers alone could be 
used to target control efforts. c, Insecticide usage, including truck and 
aerial adulticides and larvacides, by Miami-Dade Mosquito Control in 
Wynwood (left) and Miami Beach (right) was overlaid with A. aegypti 
abundance per trap night to demonstrate that intense usage of insecticides 
may have helped to reduce local mosquito populations. d, Relative 
A. aegypti abundance for each Florida county and month was estimated 
using a multivariate regression model, demonstrating spatial and temporal 
heterogeneity for the risk of ZIKV infection.

clock and a Bayesian Skyline tree prior, the best performing combination 
of clock and demographic model according to MLEs (Extended Data

highest posterior density: 1.01–1.43 × 10−3) substitutions per site per year 
(Extended Data Table 1a). These values are in agreement with previous 
estimates based on ZIKV genomes from Brazil6.

Extended Data Figure 5 | Weekly reported Zika virus case numbers and 
incidence rates in the Americas. a, Most ZIKV case numbers reported 
by PAHO30 were available only as bar graphs (raw data were not made 
available to us at the time of request). Therefore we used WebPlotDigitizer 
to estimate the weekly case numbers from the PAHO bar graphs. ZIKV 
cases reported from Ecuador was the only dataset to include a link to 
the actual case numbers that also had more than 10 cases per week73. To 
validate the WebPlotDigitizer-derived values, we compared the weekly 
reported case numbers from Ecuador to our estimates. b, The reported and

WebPlotDigitizer was used to estimate the ZIKV case numbers for all 
subsequent analysis. c, d, ZIKV cases (suspected and confirmed; c) and 
incidence rates (normalized per 100,000 population; d) are shown for each 
country or territory with available data per epidemiological week from 1 
January to 18 September 2016. e, Each country or territory with available 
data is coloured by its reported ZIKV incidence rate from January to June 
2016 (the time frame for analysis of ZIKV introductions into Florida).

Extended Data Figure 6 | Cruise and flight traffic entering Miami from 
regions with Zika virus transmission. a, b, The estimated number of 
passengers entering Miami, by cruises (a) or flights (b), from each country 
or territory in the Americas with ZIKV transmission per month (left). The 
centre map and inset show the cumulative numbers of travellers entering 
Miami during January to June 2016 (the time frame for analysis of ZIKV 
introductions into Florida) from each country or territory per method of 
travel. c, The total traffic (that is, cruises and flights) entering Miami per 
month.

Extended Data Figure 7 | Expected number of ZIKV-infected travellers 
from the Caribbean correlated with the total observed number of 
travel-associated infections. a, To account for potential biases in ZIKV 
reporting accuracy, we also estimated the proportion of infected travellers 
using projected ZIKV attack rates78 (that is, predicted proportion of 
population infected before epidemic burnout). About 60% of the infected 
travellers are expected to have arrived from the Caribbean, similar to our 
results using incidence rates (Fig. 3c). b, The expected number of travel-
associated ZIKV cases was estimated by the number of travellers coming 
into Miami from each country or territory (travel capacity) and the in-
country or in-territory infection likelihood (incidence rate per person) per 
week. The expected travel cases were summed from all of the Americas 
(left), Caribbean (left centre), South America (right centre), and Central 
America (right) and plotted with the observed travel-associated ZIKV 
cases. Numbers in each plot indicate Spearman correlation coefficients. 
Negative Spearman r coefficients indicate a negative correlation between 
the number of expected and observed travel cases.

Extended Data Figure 8 | Greater early season potential for Zika virus 
introductions into Miami. The monthly cruise ship and airline28 capacity 
from countries or territories with ZIKV transmission for the major US 
travel hubs (shown as circle diameter) with monthly potential A. aegypti 
abundance (circle colour), as previously estimated22. The abundance 
ranges were chosen with respect to the May–October Miami mean: None 
to low (<2%); Low to moderate (2–25%); Moderate to high (25–75%); 
and High (>75%). Mosquito-borne transmission is unlikely in the ‘None 
to low’ range. Cruise capacities from Houston and Galveston, Texas were 
combined.
