ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the effect of an antenatal
integrative medicine education programme in addition
to usual care for nulliparous women on intrapartum
epidural use.
Design: Open-label, assessor blind, randomised
controlled trial.
Setting: 2 public hospitals in Sydney, Australia.
Population: 176 nulliparous women with low-risk
pregnancies, attending hospital-based antenatal clinics.
Methods and intervention: The Complementary
Therapies for Labour and Birth protocol, based on the
She Births and acupressure for labour and birth
courses, incorporated 6 evidence-based
complementary medicine techniques: acupressure,
visualisation and relaxation, breathing, massage, yoga
techniques, and facilitated partner support.
Randomisation occurred at 24–36 weeks’ gestation,
and participants attended a 2-day antenatal education
programme plus standard care, or standard care alone.
Main outcome measures: Rate of analgesic
epidural use. Secondary: onset of labour,
augmentation, mode of birth, newborn outcomes.
Results: There was a significant difference in epidural
use between the 2 groups: study group (23.9%)
standard care (68.7%; risk ratio (RR) 0.37 (95% CI
0.25 to 0.55), p≤0.001). The study group participants
reported a reduced rate of augmentation (RR=0.54
(95% CI 0.38 to 0.77), p<0.0001); caesarean section
(RR=0.52 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.87), p=0.017); length of
second stage (mean difference=−0.32 (95% CI −0.64
to 0.002), p=0.05); any perineal trauma (0.88 (95% CI
0.78 to 0.98), p=0.02) and resuscitation of the
newborn (RR=0.47 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.87), p≤0.015).
There were no statistically significant differences found
in spontaneous onset of labour, pethidine use, rate of
postpartum haemorrhage, major perineal trauma (third
and fourth degree tears/episiotomy), or admission to
special care nursery/neonatal intensive care unit
(p=0.25).
Conclusions: The Complementary Therapies for
Labour and Birth study protocol significantly reduced
epidural use and caesarean section. This study
provides evidence for integrative medicine as an
effective adjunct to antenatal education, and
contributes to the body of best practice evidence.
Trial registration number: ACTRN12611001126909.
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the first randomised controlled trial in
Australia that has investigated the effectiveness
of a birth preparation course, integrating multiple
complementary medicine (CM) techniques, for
the
support
of
natural
birth
for
first-time
mothers. This suggests a reorientation of ante-
natal
education
towards
normal
birth,
and
reflects current outcome measures in reports of
maternity services policy directives.
▪ The
study
used
self-administered,
evidence-
based CM techniques and blinded analysis to
test an a priori hypothesis, and implemented a
pragmatic design where participants were free to
use any of the techniques with no prescriptions
or time limitations for use, allowing women and
partners to have control and influence over their
birth process, and use information and CM tools
to manage their own labours.
▪ The primary outcome measure of epidural block
(EDB) was used, rather than frequently used pain
scores, as the objective measure of EDB has
been identified as a mediating factor in labour
interventions and mode of birth, described as
the cascade of interventions.
▪ Limitations of this study include higher enrol-
ment of relatively wealthy, well-educated women
and relatively fewer participants from the area
identified as lower socioeconomic status. This is
in line with previous CM research, but it is worth
considering that the highest rates of epidural use
and caesarean section are also among this more
advantaged population.
▪ Wider national and international implementation
of this study is recommended to confirm results
in a broader population and examine issues of
generalisability.

 INTRODUCTION
There has been a rise in rates of intervention during
labour and birth in most developed countries,1 2 and
the intervention rates in Australia during birth are well
above the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) averages.3 As these interventions
increase, such as routine use of epidural block (EDB),
so does the rate of instrumental births and associated
medical interventions.4–8 Epidural rates in New South
Wales (NSW) hospitals have shown a rapid rise over the
past decade. In 2012, the state average for EDB use was
46.5%; however, there was broad variation within the
state, ranging from 15% to 82.7% depending on region
and hospital.9 10 The high use of EDB for pain relief in
labour has been identified as a contributing factor in
rising rates of augmentation and assisted vaginal births
and caesarean section (CS).4 6–8 11
Childbirth education has also seen a shift away from
birth preparation12 13 to a curriculum broadly centred
on overall parent education.14 Findings from a systematic
review on childbirth education reports that the effective-
ness of antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood
supports the idea that educational interventions have a
role
in
increasing
feelings
of
self-confidence
and
control, but demonstrates little impact on reducing
interventions and associated morbidity in labour.15 16
Integrative medicine approaches and complementary
medicine
(CM),
in
particular,
may offer
increased
options for pain relief in birth,17 and may be effective
within the hospital antenatal education framework. The
term integrative medicine is used when referring to
incorporating CM or complementary therapies (CT)
into mainstream healthcare.18 Recent Australian data
suggest that 74.4% of women used some form of CM
during pregnancy, and 66.7% of these women also used
non-pharmacological
pain
relief
in
labour.19
The
Cochrane Systematic Review on pain management for
labour finds some evidence to suggest that acupuncture,
relaxation, massage and water immersion may assist in
the
management
of
labour
with
few
side
effects;
however, more research is needed to establish efficacy of
these techniques.20
In response to the need to establish the evidence base
for CM interventions for pain management in labour,
we undertook a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to
test
the
hypothesis
that
nulliparous
women
who
undergo a CM antenatal education course, in addition
to usual antenatal care, would use less EDB than nul-
liparous women who receive usual antenatal care alone.
Trials of complex interventions are difficult to conduct
and do not have linear models, and require a pragmatic
approach to implementation.21 22
METHODS
The Complementary Therapies for Labour and Birth
(CTLB) study protocol was based on the She Births
Antenatal
Education
Program,
with
an
acupressure
component ‘acupressure techniques for use during
childbirth and pregnancy’ protocol.23 The study proto-
col was further adapted to reflect the evidence base for
the CM techniques that were incorporated.22 24–26
From April 2012 to August 2013, women and their
birth partners were recruited to a two-arm study consist-
ing of a study group, who received the CTLB protocol in
addition to usual care, and a control group, who
received usual care alone. The study was an assessor-
blinded, open-label pragmatic RCT.
Participants
Women attending antenatal clinic were eligible to par-
ticipate in the study from 24 to 34 weeks’ gestation. They
were provided with a participant information sheet for
themselves and their birth partner. If they were inter-
ested and eligible to participate, women and partners
signed individual consent forms. Women were eligible to
enter the trial if they had a singleton pregnancy with a
cephalic presentation, were low risk (no pre-existing
medical complications or existing obstetric complica-
tions), were first-time mothers (nulliparous) and had
knowledge of sufficient English to participate in a
course. Women were excluded from entering the trial if
they had preidentified risk factors, were enrolled or
intending to enrol in a ‘continuity of care’ midwifery
programme or in a private birth preparation course,
were unable to attend a weekend course, knew insuffi-
cient English for participation, or had been previously
randomised to the trial. Recruitment was undertaken at
two public hospitals in Sydney, Australia, that reflected
diverse socioeconomic areas. Recruitment was also con-
ducted through the affiliated Western Sydney University
(WSU) in response to newspaper and magazine adver-
tisements. Participants who were recruited through WSU
attended the courses at either of the two hospital study
sites. All eligible women were approached in the ante-
natal clinic at site 1 as this was a smaller unit and individ-
ual contact was possible; all clinics
were attended
regularly by the researcher. At site 2, the hospital was
much larger and more diverse with regard to structure
of the clinics. Different clinics were attended, and eli-
gible women at these clinics were approached. It was not
possible to attend all clinics at this larger unit, and a
range of clinics were selected on different weeks to
achieve a representative sample of women. For site 3,
where flyers and newspaper advertisements were used
for recruitment, the response rate was quite low. All eli-
gible women who contacted us through these means
were randomised to the study. We do not have data on
the women who were not eligible to participate. The
randomisation target was achieved quite quickly, and
participation was popular.
Randomisation
We used a web-based computer-generated randomisation
sequence prepared centrally via the ‘Sealed Envelope’
website (https://http://www.sealedenvelope.com), and

 concealed centrally. Stratification occurred for hospital
site, yielding three randomisation lists: ‘site H’, ‘site N’
and ‘WSU’. Women were randomly allocated to either
the study group or usual care alone. Randomisation
occurred on a 1:1 allocation ratio to ensure equal
numbers in each group at each hospital. All randomisa-
tions were entered by the investigator KL.
Intervention
Two-day courses (see online supplementary file 1) were
conducted over a weekend at one of the two hospital
venues
on
a
fortnightly
to
monthly
basis
over
a
15-month period from May 2012 to August 2013. A total
of
20
courses
were
conducted
during
this
time.
Participants attended prior to 36 weeks’ gestation with a
birth partner, and there was a maximum of 12 couples
and a minimum of 2 couples at each course, with an
average of 8 couples per course. The study investigator
(KL) ran each course.
The underlying philosophy and specific techniques
included in the intervention programme were designed
to support a woman during her pregnancy and labour by
introducing tools to enhance a natural state of relaxation
(visualisation, breathing, massage, yoga), and facilitate
labour progression (yoga, acupressure) and pain relief
(breathing, acupressure, visualisation). The CTLB proto-
col introduces concepts of birth as a natural physiological
process, and the idea of ‘working with pain’27 using
evidence-based CM tools by which the birth process can
be managed.20 Women and partners received education
about the physiology of normal birth.
The tools used were:
1. Visualisation25—four guided visualisations rehearsed
through the courses and given to participants on a
CD to practice at home;
2. Yoga postures28—five postures and movements prac-
ticed to encourage relaxation, physiological position
for labour, opening of the pelvis and downward
descent of the baby;
3. Breathing techniques20—four breathing techniques
were introduced: soft sleep breaths for relaxation
between contractions; blissful belly breaths (BBs)
which were used during contractions for pain relief;
Cleansing Calming Breaths used following contrac-
tions during the transition period of labour; and the
gentle birthing breath (GB) which was for use during
the second stage of labour and encouraged descent
of the baby avoiding active pushing and protection of
the pelvic floor;
4. Massage26—two techniques were shown to partners:
the endorphin massage used between contractions,
which is a soft technique and encourages endorphin
release; and the stronger massage which is used
during contractions for pain relief and focuses on
squeezing
the
buttock,
especially
the
piriformis
muscle, to interrupt pain perception;
5. Acupressure,22 24 which uses six main points for use
during labour selected from a previously published
protocol.23 These focus on hormone release for
labour progression, augmentation of contractions,
pain relief, nausea and positioning of baby;
6. Facilitated partner support29–31 uses the concept of
working with pain27 and instructs partners to advo-
cate for the labouring woman, promoting her oxyto-
cin levels and minimising her stress with actions and
techniques which are supportive for the birthing
woman, and gives time for facilitated discussion and
rehearsal by couples during the course.
Usual care consisted of the hospital-based antenatal
education course routinely available at each hospital.
Antenatal education classes in Australia currently take a
general descriptive approach to labour preparation, and
emphasise parenting and postpartum issues as the main
focus.14 Classes generally run weekly over 6–7 weeks or
over 1–2 weekends, and include topics such as: pregnancy
changes, exercise and back care during pregnancy, signs
of labour, unexpected outcomes in labour and birth,
pharmacological pain management, managing labour
and birth, newborn care and breast feeding, parenthood,
and baby’s first weeks.
Blinding
Women, their partners and the chief investigator (KL)
were not blinded to group allocation. Group allocated
was subsequently coded, and outcome measures were
assessed and analysed blind to study group allocation.
Midwives and doctors at each of the two main study hospi-
tals and other sites were aware of the study, but delivery
suite personnel were blinded to study participants’ group
allocation. Study course content was not disclosed to mid-
wives to avoid any change in practice that may occur.
Group allocation and data were linked by identification
codes, allowing for the analysis to be undertaken blind.
A priori outcome measures
Primary outcome: epidural use for pain relief.
Secondary outcomes: other pharmacological pain relief
use during labour; induction of labour; augmentation of
labour; length of labour; instrumental delivery; CS, post-
partum haemorrhage (PPH; >500 mL blood loss); peri-
neal trauma (first/second/third/fourth degree tear/
episiotomy); major or severe perineal trauma (third/
fourth degree tear/episiotomy); Apgar scores <7 at
5 min;
resuscitation
of
the
newborn
(with
oxygen,
suction, bag and mask, intubation, cardiac massage);
admission to special care nursery/neonatal intensive
care unit (SCN/NICU). Other outcomes included atti-
tude towards birth and personal sense of control, as well
as postnatal depression at 6 weeks, measured by the
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).32
Questionnaires
To assess measures of personal control, we used the
Labour Agentry Scale (LAS).33 Within 72 hours follow-
ing birth the LAS was administered to all women (see
online supplementary file 2). The LAS contains 29

 questions with a seven-point Likert scale ranging from
‘1=almost always’, to ‘7=rarely’. Therefore, scores could
theoretically range from 29, indicating the highest
control possible, to a high score of 203 indicating the
lowest agency possible. Clinical outcomes were collected
from hospital birth records and the NSW Hospitals’
birth summaries, which were accessed from the hospitals
where the participant had given birth.
Analysis
An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used for the
primary and secondary outcome data. The χ2 and t-tests
were used for univariate analysis of categorical and con-
tinuous data, respectively. Significance was set at an α of
0.05, reporting on relative risk with a 95% CI. Group
allocation was coded by an independent researcher, and
the investigator undertook the analysis blind to group
allocation. Data were analysed using SPSS V.22 (IBM
SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0 [program].
Armonk, KY: IBM Corp, 2013).
Sample size and power
The trial was designed to demonstrate an absolute
reduction of 20% in epidural use from 46% in those
women managed with usual care to 26% in those
women who were randomised to the study. The rate of
use of EDB was determined by published data for the
two study hospitals in the 2011 NSW Mothers and
Babies Report.34 This required a total sample size of 170
women for 80% power at a significance level of p<0.05.
Recruitment continued until at least 170 women had
been enrolled, and those randomised to the treatment
group had either completed the course or were known
to have missed their course, with 176 randomised and
171 completing the study. A low drop-out rate (<3%) was
observed for the overall study population, and separately
for each arm of the study (<5%).35 Primary outcome
data were available for all consenting participants.
RESULTS
We assessed 315 women for eligibility to participate in
the study, of whom, 176 were randomised and 171 were
included in the final analysis (figure 1). Five women
were lost to follow-up. Women were randomised to the
study group (n=89) or the control group (n=87). From
the 315 women screened, 139 were excluded for the fol-
lowing reasons: 105 declined to participate, and 34 did
not meet inclusion criteria (insufficient English (n=7),

 continuity of care model (n=6), moderate-to-high risk
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (n=5), breech pres-
entation (n=4)). In the final analysis, there were 101
women included from site 1, 30 women from site 2 and
40 women from site 3.
All women completed the trial entry form at baseline,
including the demographic information. Not all women
answered each question in the trial entry form (table 1).
Following birth, the LAS was completed by 72 of the 88
women (82%) in the study group, and 52 of the 83
(62%) women in the control group.
Participants in the intervention group did not signifi-
cantly differ from those in the control group in terms of
their age, body mass index, cultural background, level of
education, income, hospital status or model of care
(table 1). Babies were not different in terms of average
gestational age or weight at birth.
Primary outcome
A statistically and clinically significant reduction in epi-
dural rate was found for the intervention group com-
pared with the control group. The overall unadjusted
rate of EDB in the control group was 68.7%, and 23.9%
in the study group (risk ratio (RR)=0.35 (0.23 to 0.52),
p≤0.0001; table 2). In addition to stratification of ran-
domisation by site, a post hoc analysis was performed for
each site. The RRs were similar to the primary analysis
(RR1=0.27 (0.12 to 0.60), RR2=0.31 (0.11 to 0.90),
RR3=0.39 (0.23 to 0.65)). Using a true ITT analysis, we
examined the data, including data points for the five
women who had dropped out, withdrawn or were lost to
follow-up. There were four in the control group, and
one in the study group. Using a best-case–worst-case
scenario, we included the five cases with missing data for
the primary outcome. If the four control group women
did not have an EDB and the one study group woman
did have an EDB (worst case), the results were still
highly statistically significant with a RR of 0.40 (95% CI
0.27 to 0.59), p=<0.0001.
Secondary clinical outcomes
Women in the study group were more likely to experi-
ence a normal vaginal birth (NVB) (RR=1.56 (1.12 to
2.17), p=<0.01), and were less likely to have medical or
surgical augmentation during labour (RR=0.54 (95% CI
0.38 to 0.77), p<0.001), birth by CS (RR=0.52 (0.31 to
0.87), p=0.01) or any perineal trauma (RR=0.88 (95%
CI 0.7 to 0.98), p=0.02). We also found a reduced length
of second stage of labour (mean difference (MD)=−0.32
(95% CI −0.64 to 0.002), p=0.05) in the study group
(table 2). Babies of women in the study group were also
less likely to require resuscitation by suction (±oxygen)
or with bag and mask (RR=0.47 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.87),
p=0.015). There were no differences in the rare out-
comes of intubation or cardiac massage required at
birth. Only one baby in the study group required intub-
ation. There were some non-significant trends towards
the study group having less likelihood of an instrumental
vaginal birth (VB) (RR=0.57 (95% CI 0.30 to 1.09),
p=0.09), and nitrous oxide (gas) for pain management
(RR=0.77 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.03), p=0.09).
No significant differences were found in the secondary
outcome measures of spontaneous onset of labour
(RR=1.13 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.57), p=0.51), pethidine use
(RR=1.11 (95% CI 0.65 to 2.2), p=0.56), rates of PPH
(RR=0.82 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.61), p=0.85) or major peri-
neal trauma (third/fourth degree tear or episiotomy;
RR=0.94 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.55), p=0.85). No significant
differences were found in Apgar scores (RR=0.99 (95%
CI 0.95 to 1.03), p=1.0), or admission to the SCN/NICU
(RR=0.59 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.46), p=0.25).
The length of the second stage of labour was 1 hour
for the study group and1 hour 32 min for the control
group, resulting in a MD of 32 min (p=0.05). There were
no significant differences between the groups for the first
stage of labour or the total length of labour (see table 3).
The LAS questionnaire examined whether the course
had any impact on attitudes and feelings about birth
and women’s feelings of agentry. The LAS was com-
pleted by 72 of the 88 women in the study group (82%),
with an average score of 164.97 (SD=27.06). In the
control group 52 of the 83 women (62%) completed the
form, and had an average score of 150.92 (SD=30.03).
We found a statistically significant difference between
the two groups for this score (MD=14.05, 95% CI 3.84 to
24.26, p<0.01).

 Given that a large number of women did not com-
plete this form, there is the possibility of reporting bias
in the results. We used a Levene’s test for equality of
variance, and found the variance between the two
groups
was
not
significantly
different
(p=0.59).
Additionally, we did a post hoc analysis to determine if
any differences were present between the study group
and the control group for baseline characteristics by
controlling for responders versus non-responders. No
differences were found between groups.
Six weeks following the birth, participants completed
an EPDS questionnaire. However, there was a high rate
of non-compliance with this form: 27 women in the
study group and 41 women in the control group did not
complete this form. There was no statistically significant
difference between groups at 6-week follow-up for this
cohort of women (see table 4).
Analysis of patterns of CM use in labour reveal women
in the study group used an average of 3.94 (SD=1.4)
techniques during labour, and in the antenatal period

 practised various techniques for an average total of 12.94
(SD=9.7) times per week. Women in the control group
did not report antenatal practice of techniques, but
some (<5%) did report using techniques, such as breath-
ing or visualization, during labour. No individual CM
technique nor number of rehearsals in the antenatal
period was associated with reduced likelihood of EDB
use in the study group, indicating the overall effect of
the programme.
To examine if there was any preference for therapies
used during labour, we asked women in the study group
(n=88) what specific CM therapies they used during
labour. On average, women used 3.94 (SD=1.4) techni-
ques over the duration of their labour and in order of
frequency used, BBs were used most frequently by
60.2% of women; visualisation was used by 55.7%;
acupressure by 46.6%; yoga and massage, each done by
45.5% of women; and GBs were used by 35.2% of
women during labour.
DISCUSSION
Main findings
The RCT demonstrated the effectiveness of the CTLB
study, based on the She Births Antenatal Education
Program and acupressure for labour protocol36 for first-
time mothers, by showing an absolute reduction of 45%
and a relative reduction of 63% (RR=0.37, p<0.001) in
epidural rate in the study group compared with controls.
The study also showed increased rates of normal vaginal
birth without surgical or mechanical assistance, and
found reduced rates of augmentation in labour, length
of second stage of labour, perineal trauma, CS and the
need for resuscitation of the newborn. However, univari-
ate results for secondary outcomes should be inter-
preted with caution as these are likely to be related to
the primary outcomes of EDB, which has been shown to
mediate the effect of these secondary outcomes.37
38
Additionally, where response rates for secondary analyses
are low, the results should be interpreted with caution.
We note that women in the control group experienced
a higher than average rate of EDB use, augmentation
and instrumental vaginal birth, which is consistent with
data showing higher rates of intervention for nulliparous
women compared with multiparous women.10 The data
for EDB use in this study are consistent with rates for
women who are identified as being anxious.39 40 Further
research is needed to identify if women who are anxious
are more likely to participate in antenatal education pro-
grammes, and whether these women may benefit more
from this type of intervention.
Current antenatal education has undergone a distinct
shift
towards
normalising
all
births
and
preparing
parents for parenthood. However, specific preparation
for normal labour appears to have been de-emphasised
in classes.41–43 Anecdotally, the majority of women
attend routine antenatal education classes, but there is
no current literature to provide accurate numbers.44 45
The
results
from
the
Cochrane
Systematic
Review
suggest that while antenatal education aims to prepare
women and partners for childbirth and early parenting,
studies to date have shown a lack of high-quality evi-
dence and a high variability of outcome measures.
Therefore, the effects of antenatal education are still
largely unknown.15 Studies exploring the use of ante-
natal education interventions, antenatal mindfulness
training and self-hypnosis training have failed to demon-
strate any reduction in the use of analgesia during
labour and birth or on CS rates.15 46–51
Some commentators suggest that the impact of ante-
natal education in routine care may in fact be reinfor-
cing medical management of labour and birth, and is
therefore not addressing the rising rates of medical pain
relief and the associated complications.7 41 43 52 53 In
this study, we assessed if women from the control group
used CM techniques, as a demonstration of cross-over.
However, <5% of women reported using these techni-
ques during their labour, and this is unlikely to intro-
duce any contamination to the results.
In this study, we emphasised the importance of reor-
ienting the concept of normal birth using an antenatal
education framework and a variety of evidence-based
integrative CM techniques to help women manage pain
in labour and birth. One of the recently voiced concerns
of using alternative birth positions, such as yoga postures
and upright positions, is the potential for increased risk
of perineal trauma.54 The data from our research
showed a statistically significant reduction in perineal
trauma for women. Among those women who had
vaginal births, 84.7% of the study group compared with
96.4% of the control group sustained some kind of peri-
neal trauma during birth (RR=0.88, p=0.02). Techniques
were rehearsed in the antenatal period with some acu-
pressure for induction techniques practiced lightly from
37 weeks as per the published literature.36 This is
reported to work with the hormones that are naturally
present in the woman’s body, but do not artificially
induce
contractions.
This
is
an
important
safety
outcome, and there were no differences in gestational
age at birth.
The study provides evidence that antenatal education
integrating CM techniques is an effective and viable
method of managing pain, decreasing medical interven-
tions and increasing personal control for women. These

 clinically and statistically significant results are important
in establishing an evidence base for the use and effect-
iveness
of
antenatal
education
programmes
incor-
porating CM techniques for the management of pain
during childbirth as an adjunct to parent education
offered as usual care. This programme has the potential
to provide a cost-effective method for antenatal edu-
cation. A costing and economic analysis of this pro-
gramme will be undertaken and reported elsewhere,
providing a measure of relative benefit for outcomes
saved. Reorienting antenatal education classes towards
supporting normal birth, and providing techniques to
help women manage pain is an important contribution
for reducing interventions in labour and birth.
Interpretation
Our study helps to address the question of whether ante-
natal education using CM techniques are effective in
reducing rates
of EDB in first-time
mothers. This
primary outcome finding and other secondary findings,
increased normal vaginal births and reduced augmenta-
tion, perineal trauma and CS, support some of the CM
literature which show a reduction in rates of pharmaco-
logical
pain
relief,
and
some
interventions
during
labour.22
24–26 These findings are in contrast to the
parent education literature, hypnosis and psychoprophy-
laxis training literature for reduction of EDB during
labour.15 46 49 51 55–57 The outcome of increase in positive
attitude towards birth in the antenatal period and
increased feelings of influence during labour and birth
are
supportive
of
the
antenatal
education
litera-
ture.15 16 41 48 55 The finding that no individual technique
was associated with reduced rates of EDB highlights the
concept that these techniques form a ‘toolkit’ of techni-
ques and represent an overall holistic approach towards
labour and birth. The combination of active birth tech-
niques with relaxation techniques is unique to this
programme.
The primary outcome measure of EDB was used for
this study rather than pain scores which are frequently
used in other CM studies.22 The objective measure of
EDB has been identified as a mediating factor and is
shown to influence labour interventions and mode of
birth, which is described in the literature as the cascade
of interventions.7
8
10
38
58 The literature highlights
the mechanism whereby an initial intervention during
labour triggers subsequent interventions to manage the
effects of the prior intervention. EDB has been shown
to mediate this effect and is associated with outcomes
such
as
augmentation
during
labour,
instrumental
vaginal birth and CS.37 This study demonstrates an
impact on rates of EDB, as well as on rates of augmen-
tation, perineal trauma and CS, and therefore may
have
an
effect
on
the
cascade
of
interventions.
Therefore, caution is required when interpreting sec-
ondary outcome measures.
It remains important that methods used during labour
are suitable for women’s individual requirements and
circumstances, and also account for conditions that may
arise in the woman or infant during labour.20 This study
demonstrates the capacity for a novel integrative ante-
natal education programme using CM techniques to
reduce interventions in normal labour.
Future research
Policy initiatives supporting normal birth require novel
solutions, and this study provides good evidence for
such an initiative, including the potential for a revision
of clinical practice in antenatal education. Future health
services research should include translation of study
outcomes into clinical practice, involving a priori cost-
effectiveness analysis, exploring key stakeholders’ views
about changing practice
and
undertaking
a multi-
centred international study to assess the impact of the
study in a broader context and beyond Australia. This
article reports on the first implementation of this ante-
natal education programme, and evaluates feasibility of
conduct. We are seeking to establish a larger trial in a
broader
national
and
international
setting
whereby
issues of implementation and generalisability may be
addressed. As a first stage, these results are promising
and further investigation is warranted.
CONCLUSION
The rise in interventions rates in labour and birth need
to be addressed as a matter of priority as outlined by
reviews
of
maternity
services3
11
and
international
reports.1 2 The high use of EDB for pain relief in labour
has been identified as a contributing factor in rising
rates of interventions, including CS.4 6–8 20 This study
highlights the effectiveness of a novel integrated ante-
natal education approach, incorporating evidence-based
CM techniques to reduce rates of EDB and leading to a
reduction in other interventions in labour and birth,
including CS. This programme is novel in its approach
and forms a unique toolkit for women and partners to
use in their labour and birth.
The reorientation of antenatal education and the pro-
motion of birth as a normal physiological event is critical
if we are to reduce interventions in birth. This shift
requires education and support to help women manage
challenges faced during labour and birth. The results
from this study demonstrate the potential effectiveness
of the CT for labour and birth in providing an indivi-
dualised,
evidence-based,
woman-centred,
integrated
approach to care that reduces medical interventions and
morbidity in labour.
