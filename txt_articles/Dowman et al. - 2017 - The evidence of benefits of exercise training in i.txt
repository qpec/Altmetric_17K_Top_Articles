ABSTRACT
Background Uncertainty exists regarding the clinical
relevance of exercise training across the range of
interstitial lung diseases (ILDs).
Objective To establish the impact of exercise training
in patients with ILDs of differing aetiology and severity.
Methods 142 participants with ILD (61 idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 22 asbestosis, 23 connective
tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) and 36 with other
aetiologies) were randomised to either 8 weeks of
supervised exercise training or usual care. Six-minute
walk distance (6MWD), Chronic Respiratory Disease
Questionnaire (CRDQ), St George Respiratory
Questionnaire IPF-specific version (SGRQ-I) and modified
Medical Research Council dyspnoea score were measured
at baseline, 9 weeks and 6 months.
Measurements and main results Exercise training
significantly increased 6MWD (25 m, 95% CI 2 to 47 m)
and health-related quality of life (CRDQ and SGRQ-I) in
people with ILD. Larger improvements in 6MWD, CRDQ,
SGRQ-I and dyspnoea occurred in asbestosis and IPF
compared with CTD-ILD, but with few significant
differences between subgroups. Benefits declined at
6 months except in CTD-ILD. Lower baseline 6MWD and
worse baseline symptoms were associated with greater
benefit in 6MWD and symptoms following training.
Greater gains were seen in those whose exercise
prescription was successfully progressed according to the
protocol. At 6 months, sustained improvements in
6MWD and symptoms were associated with better
baseline lung function and less pulmonary hypertension.
Conclusions Exercise training is effective in patients
across the range of ILDs, with clinically meaningful
benefits in asbestosis and IPF. Successful exercise
progression maximises improvements and sustained
treatment effects favour those with milder disease.

INTRODUCTION
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a disabling group
of chronic lung conditions comprising over 200
different disease entities.1 They are typically asso-
ciated with interstitial inflammation,2 and fibrosis
as well as aberrant wound healing responses which
appear to drive disease progression.3 The clinical
course is heterogeneous, but it is generally charac-
terised by progressive morbidity2 4 which can be
chronic, irreversible and fatal.5 6 Distressing dys-
pnoea, profound fatigue and reduced exercise toler-
ance are common7 with consequent reductions in
health-related quality of life (HRQoL).8 Pulmonary
hypertension, skeletal muscle dysfunction, arrhyth-
mia and exercise-induced hypoxaemia can further
complicate the clinical picture.7

10 Treatment
options are often limited and patients may eventu-
ally require lung transplantation.
Exercise training offers promise as a beneficial
therapy for patients with ILD, with improvements
in six-minute walk distance (6MWD), dyspnoea,
HRQoL and peak exercise capacity.11–13 Changes
in
6MWD
exceeded
the
minimal
important
difference (MID), suggesting benefits are clinically
meaningful.11 Nonetheless, recommendations for
exercise
training
in
clinical
guidelines
remain
weak.5

controlled trials
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ Does the aetiology and severity of disease
impact the response to exercise training in
patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and
is there an optimal time for exercise training to
occur to achieve maximal benefit?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Exercise training delivers clinically meaningful
improvements in exercise capacity and quality
of life for patients across the range of ILDs,
especially those with asbestosis and idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, with more lasting effects in
those with milder disease.
Why read on?
▸ This is the first study to establish the effect of
disease aetiology and markers of severity on
response to exercise training in ILD, providing
high-quality evidence supporting the role of
exercise training in the clinical management of
all patients with ILD.

 (RCTs) are small with methodological limitations, particularly
with regard to lack of blinding and loss to follow-up. There
are
opposing
views
regarding
which
patients
benefit
most;14
15 two studies suggest greater treatment effects in
those with less functional impairment14 16 while others15 17
found greater improvements in those with more severe impair-
ment. Furthermore, it has been suggested that patients with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) may improve less from
exercise training than patients with other disease aetiolo-
gies.11
14 In an uncontrolled study14 patients with non-IPF
ILD benefitted regardless of disease severity and were more
likely to achieve longer-term symptomatic benefit than those
with IPF. Therefore, the benefit of exercise training could vary
according to disease severity and aetiology, and the timing of
exercise training may matter for particular types of ILD.
Robust, adequately powered studies addressing the effects and
timing of exercise training on ILD of different aetiologies are
lacking. The primary aims of this study were to establish the
impact of aetiology and severity of ILD on response to exercise
training. The secondary aim was to identify an optimal time for
exercise training to achieve maximal benefit.
METHODS
Study design and participants
This multicentre randomised, assessor-blinded, controlled trial,
conducted at three tertiary hospitals in Melbourne, Australia,
recruited patients with documented ILD who were clinically
stable, ambulant, and reported dyspnoea on exertion despite
maximal medical treatment (see online supplement). Exclusion
criteria were concurrent and predominant respiratory disease
other than ILD, a history of syncope on exertion, and any
comorbidities that preclude exercise or participation in a
supervised exercise programme within the previous 12 months.
Participants were randomly allocated using consecutively num-
bered, sealed opaque envelopes to receive usual care or exer-
cise
training
for
8 weeks.
Randomisation
was
stratified
according to four subgroups: IPF, dust-related ILD, connective
tissue disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) and other ILD. Those
with IPF were further stratified for carbon monoxide transfer
factor (TLCO) ≥ or <40%.5 6 A researcher independent of
the study completed the block randomisation using a web-
based
sequence
generator
(http://www.randomization.com).
The study was registered (ACTRN12611000416998) and the
protocol published.18
Intervention
Participants in the intervention group attended a twice-weekly
supervised outpatient exercise training programme consisting of
30 min of aerobic exercise, cycling and walking, plus upper and
lower limb resistance training.18 Initial intensity for walking was
80% of peak walking speed achieved on the 6MWT
, cycling
at 70% of maximum work rate estimated from the 6MWT
and resistance training at an initial load that corresponded to
10–12 RM (repetition maximum).18 Exercise was progressed
weekly
and
a
home
exercise
programme
prescribed.
Supplemental oxygen was provided during training if necessary
to maintain SpO2 ≥88% and used during home exercise in par-
ticipants prescribed ambulatory oxygen. The exercise training
was conducted within the hospitals’ pulmonary rehabilitation
(PR) programmes which also included an education component
that was available and recommended to all participants. The
control group received once weekly telephone calls for general
support. A detailed description of the intervention is in the
online supplement.
Measurements
The primary outcome measure was change in 6MWD. The sec-
ondary outcome measures were knee extensor and elbow flexor
strength
(hand
held
dynamometry19),
HRQoL
(Chronic
Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRDQ)8 and St George
Respiratory Questionnaire IPF specific version (SGRQ-I)20), dys-
pnoea (University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath
Questionnaire (UCSD SOBQ)21 and Modified Medical Research
Council dyspnoea (MMRC) scale22), anxiety and depression
(Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)23) and global
rating of change. These were assessed at baseline, 9 weeks and
6 months by an assessor blinded to group allocation. Spirometry,
TLCO, lung volumes and echocardiographic assessment of pul-
monary artery systolic pressure (PASP) were measured at base-
line. Spirometry and TLCO were repeated at 6 months. Current
comorbidities, the use of oxygen or pharmacological therapies
were also documented (see online supplement).
Statistical analysis
Based on effects seen in our previous study,24 22 participants
with dust-related ILD and 22 with CTD-ILD were required to
detect a mean (SD) difference in 6MWD with 80% power
between groups of 52 (40) m and 38 (30) m respectively.24 25
For participants with IPF, to detect differences of 29 or 34 m
(SD 43 m) with 80% power, representing the upper and lower
limits of the MID in IPF25 required 72 and 54 participants
respectively. Patients with other ILD diagnoses were also
recruited for a total of 142 participants. Data analysis was
according to intention-to-treat (ITT) principles. Between-group
differences were evaluated using linear mixed models with three
fixed
effects:
group
(exercise
or control),
time
(baseline,
9 weeks and 6 months), and a group×time interaction. Baseline
data were used as a covariate. Subgroup analyses were per-
formed with addition of a subgroup category (IPF, dust-related
ILD and CTD-ILD) and all possible interactions. Analysis of the
other ILD subgroup was not performed as it represented a het-
erogeneous group of disease entities and not a distinct ILD
subtype. T
wo per-protocol analyses were defined a priori includ-
ing (1) those who completed the programme (attendance at 12
out of 16 sessions)24 and (2) those whose exercise training pre-
scription was progressed according to the protocol. Categorical
data were analysed using the Pearson χ2 test. Stepwise multiple
linear regression was undertaken using backward elimination to
identify independent predictors of change in 6MWD and symp-
toms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis
identified thresholds at which exercise training became less
effective, using established MIDs for change in 6MWD,25
CRDQ dyspnoea and fatigue.26 All analyses were performed
using SPSS V
.20 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). A p<0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Further statistical details are
described in the online supplement.
RESULTS
Between November 2011 and June 2014, 296 patients with
ILD were screened and 142 were randomised (figure 1).
Sixty-one participants had IPF, 22 had dust-related ILD (all
asbestosis), 23 had CTD-ILD and 36 had other diagnoses (see
online supplement). Forty-nine (66%) participants in the inter-
vention group completed the exercise programme. No adverse
events occurred during exercise training. Follow-up data were
available for 95% and 88% of participants at 9 weeks and
6 months respectively.
There were no baseline differences between the intervention
and control groups for the entire ILD population, except for

 HRQoL and use of
exertional
oxygen (table E1, online
supplement), or across subgroups, except for MMRC dyspnoea
(table 1). Those with IPF had lower baseline 6MWD (mean
(SD): 430 (128) m) than those with asbestosis (475 (93) m) or
CTD-ILD (505 (88) m, p=0.02). A small, non-significant, reduc-
tion in pulmonary function occurred at 6 months in the entire
ILD population and the IPF subgroup (table 2). T
wenty-seven
(38%) participants received supplemental oxygen during exercise
training and SpO2 was maintained above 88% in 22 (81%) parti-
cipants. Home diary review revealed that 40 (54%) participants
in the intervention group achieved the three recommended
home exercise sessions per week, averaging 2.4 sessions per week
and 22 min per session. A similar pattern was demonstrated
across the subgroups (table E2 in online supplement).
Clinical outcomes: all ILD
The
6MWD
significantly
improved
following
exercise
training with a mean difference to control (95% CI) of 25 m
(2 to 47 m). This improvement was not sustained at 6 months
(table 3), with a significant decline in both groups (figure 2).
The intervention group demonstrated significant short-term
improvements in all CRDQ and SGRQ-I domains, except
SGRQ-I impact score (table 3). A significant decline from
9 weeks to 6 months was seen in CRDQ mastery, SGRQ-I
impact and SGRQ-I total in the exercise group (figures E1 and
E2, online supplement). There was a trend towards reduced
anxiety in the intervention group at 9 weeks (p=0.06) that was
lost at 6 months (figure E3a, online supplement). There was no
significant change in depression (figure 3B, online supplement).
Only 8% and 16% of participants respectively had clinically sig-
nificant depression and anxiety at baseline (HADS score ≥11).27
No significant differences between groups were evident for dys-
pnoea, knee extensor or elbow flexor strength (table 3). The
global rating of change showed that perceived walking ability
improved in 50% of intervention participants and 17% in the
control group following the intervention period (p<0.001),
with a similar response for symptom improvement (50% vs
12%, p<0.001).

 benefit often seen in those with CTD-ILD. Those with asbes-
tosis and CTD-ILD had significantly greater improvements in
the SGRQ-I symptoms compared with those with IPF (table 4).
Regardless of group allocation, those with CTD-ILD had signifi-
cantly better SGRQ-I impact and total scores at 9 weeks (table
4) and 6 months (figure 4). The 6MWD (figure 3) and CRDQ
(figure E4, online supplement) improved at 6 months in those
with CTD-ILD but declined in those with IPF and asbestosis;
this different response over time reached significance only for
CRDQ emotional function and mastery (table 4). There were
no other significant differences between subgroups (table 4),
including anxiety and depression (tables E3 and E4, online
supplement). The CTD-ILD subgroup had a greater percentage
of participants (50%) who did not improve in 6MWD than
those with IPF (30%) and asbestosis (18%), with a similar trend
for CRDQ fatigue (50% vs 33% vs 27%). There were no
significant baseline differences between those who improved
and those who did not improve in any subgroup.
Programme completion and exercise progression
A per-protocol analysis that included only those participants in
the intervention group who completed the programme showed
a greater increase in 6MWD (mean 27 m (95% CI 2 to 52 m,
figure 5A). However, a per-protocol analysis including only
those participants who were able to progress their exercise
intensity according to the protocol showed a larger improve-
ment in 6MWD (37 m, 95% CI 11 to 64 m, figure 5B). A
similar pattern was demonstrated within diagnostic subgroups
(table 5), and for HRQoL (table E5, online supplement). There
were no significant differences between those who successfully
completed the programme or progressed their exercise intensity
and those who did not (table E6, online supplement).

 Predictors of response to exercise
In a stepwise multiple regression model that included subgroup,
group allocation and baseline variables with a significant rela-
tionship to change in 6MWD (table E7, online supplement),
lower baseline 6MWD and allocation to exercise training pre-
dicted greater improvement in 6MWD at 9 weeks (table 6). For
every 10 m increase in baseline 6MWD, the gain in 6MWD at
9 weeks declined by 1.4 m. Better physiological markers of
disease severity predicted long-term gains in 6MWD, with no
effect of group allocation. For every 10 mm Hg decrease in
PASP or
100 mL
increase
in
FVC,
6MWD
increased
at
6 months by 15 or 2.1 m respectively. These models explained
15% and 13% of the variation in exercise response at 9 weeks
and 6 months respectively (table 6). A similar pattern was seen
for change in symptoms (table E8, online supplement).
The ROC curve analysis indicated a baseline 6MWD thresh-
old of 477 m above which exercise training was less likely to
achieve 6MWD improvements exceeding the MID27 (sensitivity
75%, specificity 55%, area under the curve (AUC) 67%,
p=0.005). A PASP threshold ≥31.5 mm Hg predicted less likeli-
hood of achieving the MID at 6 months (sensitivity 76%, speci-
ficity
54%,
AUC
63%,
p=0.05).
A
PASP
≥31.5 mm Hg
(p=0.001) also predicted, with better accuracy, less impact of
exercise
training
on
CDRQ
fatigue
(figure
E6,
online
supplement). The ROC analysis could not identify a suitable
threshold for lung function to predict long-term outcome in
6MWD or symptoms. The CTD-ILD and the IPF subgroup,
respectively, had the greatest percentage of participants above
the 6MWD (78%) and the PASP (55%) thresholds (see online
supplement).
DISCUSSION
This is the largest RCT of exercise training in ILD and the first
to establish the impact of aetiology and disease severity on
response
to
exercise
training.
W
e
demonstrated
clinically
important improvements in 6MWD, symptoms and HRQoL
following exercise, strengthening previous findings11–13 and pro-
viding convincing evidence for exercise training to be adopted
as a recommended treatment for all patients with ILD. W
e con-
firmed that people with asbestosis and IPF, and to a lesser extent
CTD-ILD, receive clinically meaningful benefits and that disease
severity predicts long-term benefit with sustained treatment
effects favouring milder disease. A further novel finding was
that successful adherence to exercise progression maximises the
benefits.
The overall mean 6MWD improvement of 25 m was smaller
than the MID (30–33 m) for people with ILD25 and smaller
than previously reported, (35 m)24 despite equivalent disease
severity and proportion of IPF participants. This could be attrib-
uted to the greater proportion of participants with CTD-ILD
who experienced minimal change in 6MWD. Nonetheless
improvements in CRDQ dyspnoea, fatigue and emotional func-
tion exceeded the MID.26 The MID for the SGRQ-I-specific
version has not been established; however, improvements in
SGRQ-I symptoms and activity exceeded the MID for the stand-
ard SGRQ for IPF.28 T
ogether with the global rating of change
scores, this suggests the impact of exercise training on health
status was clinically significant and improvements were import-
ant to patients.
Despite the known diversity between ILD subgroups, the
exercise
response
was
not
decidedly
heterogeneous.
Improvements achieved in those with asbestosis exceeded the
MID for 6MWD,25 symptoms and HRQoL26 28 29 and were
comparable to previous reports in a combined cohort of
dust-related
pleural
and
interstitial
respiratory
diseases.13
Participants with IPF experienced smaller gains, in accordance
with previous investigations11 14 24 but improvements achieved
fell within the MID range for 6MWD25 and exceeded the MID
for HRQoL,26 28 suggesting that exercise training is equally
effective in IPF. The mean 6MWD improvement of 31 m was
less than previously reported (46 and 81 m),12 30 however this
could be attributed to the lack of blinding and ITT analyses in
these studies, resulting in an overestimation of treatment effect.
Additionally, our study may not have been optimally powered
for IPF, as we did not achieve the larger sample size needed to
detect mean effects equivalent to the lower estimates of the
MID for 6MWD. Despite the limited improvement in those
with CTD-ILD, some symptomatic benefit was achieved with
changes in CRDQ dyspnoea and SGRQ-I symptoms exceeding

 the MID.26 28 Additionally, aetiology or severity of ILD did not
predict short-term improvement in 6MWD or symptoms. This
suggests that exercise training may be efficacious across the
entire
spectrum
of
disease
in
achieving
short-term
improvements.
Patients with high baseline 6MWDs received less benefit fol-
lowing exercise training, consistent with previous studies.15 This
could be regression to the mean, although the RCT design and
ITT analyses would mitigate this effect.31
32 Alternatively, a
ceiling effect of the 6MWT may have masked the efficacy of
exercise training in these patients. A ceiling effect has been pre-
viously documented in 6MWDs above 450 m in patients with
pulmonary hypertension.33 This is consistent with our ROC
analysis which identified a baseline 6MWD threshold ≥477 m
where exercise training became less effective. Therefore, an
alternate measure of functional capacity with a higher ceiling
effect such as incremental shuttle walk test34 35 may be more
sensitive in detecting change in people with high baseline
6MWDs.
Markers of disease severity were the only predictors of
6MWD at 6 months. This is consistent with previous reports14
which found greater and more sustained benefits of exercise
training in milder disease. As such, engaging in exercise training
when the impact of the disease on physiological parameters is
milder may assist in preserving benefits. This does not imply
that exercise training is ineffective in more severe disease. Our
sample, although consisting largely of those with moderate
disease, included a wide range of disease severity; yet respiratory
or circulatory impairment did not predict short-term benefits. In
addition, the baseline threshold beyond which exercise training
became ineffective was weak for PASP and indeterminate for
FVC. W
e therefore do not advocate the use of any specific lung
function, symptom severity or ROC thresholds to exclude
patients from PR. Additionally, patients awaiting lung trans-
plantation, including those with advanced ILD, can achieve
gains with PR,36 and post-transplant PR can further improve
patients’
exercise
capacity
and
functional
outcomes.37
38
Therefore, all patients with ILD should be provided with the

 opportunity to undertake exercise training, although an early
referral is recommended to promote longer-lasting effects.
Other strategies such as a longer-term intervention, maintenance
exercise programmes or recurrent bouts of exercise training may
also promote longer-lasting improvements but further research
is needed in this important area.
The lack of improvement in 6MWD seen in people with
CTD-ILDs was disappointing but could be attributed to the
6MWT’s ceiling effect. The CTD-ILD subgroup had higher
baseline 6MWDs and a greater percentage of participants above
the
6MWD
threshold.
Additionally,
the
CTD-ILDs
are
commonly associated with systemic manifestations such as joint
pain, joint swelling, muscle weakness and muscle pain.4 Despite
some clinically meaningful benefits in HQRoL, there was
limited change in majority of outcomes, therefore the standard
exercise training principles used in COPD may be less effective
in minimising the impact of these systemic manifestations.
Other modalities such as hydrotherapy or resistance training
may be more suitable in achieving benefits, neither of which has
been investigated in ILD or CTD-ILD.
The progression of exercise training loads is crucial if physio-
logical adaptations are to occur. Improvement in exercise

 capacity is directly related to training frequency,39 with three to
five sessions per week being optimal and fewer than two ses-
sions being unlikely to produce meaningful change.39 As
expected, larger changes in 6MWD were evident in those who
attended 12 or more sessions; however successful exercise pro-
gression led to much larger changes. This reinforces that exer-
cise training is a critical component of PR for improving
functional capacity and HRQoL in ILD. In addition, this sug-
gests that improvements can still be achieved when attendance is
less than 75% if progression of exercise intensity is achieved.
There were no significant baseline differences between those
who completed the programme or progressed their exercise and
those that did not. Therefore, factors such as self-motivation or
efficacy, fear of adverse events or comprehension may impact
the ability to tolerate exercise training. Further investigation is
required in identifying factors that influence non-adherence to
exercise progression.
Limited changes were seen in dyspnoea, strength, anxiety and
depression. The changes in strength may not have been larger
enough to overcome measurement variation between the two
raters21 or the resistance training may not have been delivered
at an adequate intensity to achieve significant changes in
strength.39 The limited change in anxiety and depression was
likely attributed to the low numbers of participants with clinic-
ally significant anxiety and depression at baseline. This study
may not have been adequately powered to see an effect on
MMRC dyspnoea, or this measure may not be sensitive enough
to detect changes following exercise.40 Surprisingly the UCSD
SOBQ worsened following exercise, except in those with asbes-
tosis, despite improvements beyond the MCID in CRDQ dys-
pnoea.26 Additional research is required to clarify the utility of
the UCSD SOBQ in measuring change in dyspnoea in ILD.
This study had some limitations. The ‘other ILD’ subgroup
included a diverse range of diagnoses, however the sample sizes
were insufficient to allow detailed subgroup analyses of these
entities. Given the small number of participants requiring long-
term or exertional oxygen therapy, these results might not be
generalisable to those with more advanced disease. Additionally,
we did not assess whether the standard education component of
PR, which was included in the intervention, was associated with
comparable or greater clinical outcomes compared with exercise
training alone.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates exercise training is
effective for people with ILD and strengthens the rationale for
exercise training to be recommended as a standard treatment.

 Magnitude of change is greater in those with asbestosis compared
with IPF, but both groups obtain clinically meaningful improve-
ments. Individuals with a range of severity stand to benefit,
however longer-lasting effects may occur in milder disease.
Progression of exercise intensity and participation in exercise
training earlier in the disease course are crucial to optimise and
sustain physiological benefits. Further research is needed to deter-
mine the optimal exercise training strategy for CTD-ILD and to
identify strategies that maximise long-term benefit.
