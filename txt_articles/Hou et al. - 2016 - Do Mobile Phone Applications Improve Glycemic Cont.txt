 Do Mobile Phone Applications
Improve Glycemic Control (HbA1c)
in the Self-management of
Diabetes? A Systematic Review,
Meta-analysis, and GRADE of
14 Randomized Trials
Diabetes Care 2016;39:2089–2095 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-0346
OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effect of mobile phone applications (apps) on glycemic control
(HbA1c) in the self-management of diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Relevant studies that were published between 1 January 1996 and 1 June 2015 were
searched from five databases: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science,
and Embase. Randomized controlled trials that evaluated diabetes apps were in-
cluded. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis and GRADE (Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) of the evidence.
RESULTS
Participants from 14 studies (n = 1,360) were included and quality assessed.
Although there may have been clinical diversity, all type 2 diabetes studies
reported a reduction in HbA1c. The mean reduction in participants using an app
compared with control was 0.49% (95% Cl 0.30, 0.68; I2 = 10%), with a moderate
GRADE of evidence. Subgroup analyses indicated that younger patients were
more likely to benefit from the use of diabetes apps, and the effect size was
enhanced with health care professional feedback. There was inadequate data
to describe the effectiveness of apps for type 1 diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS
Apps may be an effective component to help control HbA1c and could be consid-
ered as an adjuvant intervention to the standard self-management for patients
with type 2 diabetes. Given the reported clinical effect, access, and nominal cost of
this technology, it is likely to be effective at the population level. The functionality
and use of this technology need to be standardized, but policy and guidance are
anticipated to improve diabetes self-management care.
The number of patients with diabetes globally is expected to rise to over 500 million by
2030 (1). There is an urgent need for an improved self-management suite of interven-
tions.Forself-managementtobeeffective,itneedstobestructuredandcost-effective(2)
and be widely accessible across all health economies, including the developing world (2).

META-ANALYSIS
 As a newly emerging technology, di-
abetes mobile phone applications (here-
after referred to as diabetes apps) are
a promising tool for self-management.
Wedefinediabetes apps asmobile phone
software that accepts data (transmitted
or manual entry) and provides feedback
to patients on improved management
(automated or by a health care profes-
sional [HCP]). This technology combines
the functions of the mobile phone, wire-
less network for data transmission, and
sometimes HCPs for providing feedback.
Due to its ubiquitous, low-cost, interac-
tive, and dynamic health promotion,
there is potential for diabetes apps to
provide an effective intervention in dia-
betes self-care.
In terms of diabetes self-management,
numerous studies have proven the effec-
tiveness of other telemedicine technol-
ogies, such as short message service (3),
computer-based interventions (4), and
web-based interventions (3,5). Com-
pared with these telemedicine interven-
tions, diabetes apps are advantageous
in that they are global, cheaper, conve-
nient, and more interactive. There is,
however, current uncertainty on the
clinical effectiveness of diabetes apps
in diabetes self-management (6–9).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Data Sources and Search Strategy
The PRISMA statement and checklist
was followed. Five electronic databa-
ses were searched (Medline, CINAHL,
Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and
Embase) for studies published between
1 January 1996 and 1 June 2015. The
references of the included studies were
hand searched to identify any addi-
tional articles. The following terms and
medical subject headings (MeSH) were
used during the search: (mobile OR
mHealth OR cell phone OR MeSH “Cellu-
lar Phone” OR MeSH “Smartphone” OR
app OR MeSH “Mobile Applications”)
AND (MeSH “Diabetes Mellitus” OR dia-
bete* OR T2DM OR T1DM OR IDDM OR
NIDDM).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows:
the participants were over 18 years old
and had type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the
studies were randomized controlled tri-
als (RCTs), the control group in the study
received usual diabetes care without
any telehealth programs, and baseline
and follow-up mean for HbA1c were re-
ported (or could be calculated). Exclu-
sion criteria were as follows: simulated
or self-reported HbA1c data, computer
or other mobile terminal–based diabe-
tes apps, diabetes apps were exclusively
designed for HCPs, and diabetes apps
were exclusively designed for providing
general education or allowing commu-
nication between patients and HCPs.
Two reviewers (C.H. and T.F.) searched
the literature and assessed the studies in-
dependently. Any disagreements were
resolved through discussion with a third
reviewer (B.C.). No language restrictions
were applied.
Data Extraction
Participant demographics, study design
considerations, and context were ex-
tracted from the included studies. Two
reviewers independently carried out
the data extraction (C.H. and T.F.). Study
authors were contacted to provide ad-
ditional data, and missing SDs were es-
timated by calculation (10).
Quality Assessment
The quality assessment was conducted
by two reviewers independently (C.H.
and T.F.), using the quality rating tool
proposed by the U.S. Preventive Ser-
vices Task Force (11). Seven criteria
were used to assess quality: baseline
comparability of the groups, the main-
tenance of comparability of the groups,
differential or high loss to follow-up, reli-
able and valid measurement, clear defini-
tion of the intervention, consideration of
importantoutcomes, andan intention-to-
treat analysis.The qualityofeach studywas
graded as good, fair, or poor. To be rated as
good, studies needed to meet all the crite-
ria. A study was rated as poor if one (or
more) domain was assessed as having a se-
rious flaw. Studies that met some but not
all of the criteria were rated as fair quality.
Data Analysis
Changes in HbA1c, or HbA1c at follow-up,
were compared between groups using a
mean difference and were presented
with an associated 95% CI. When studies
investigated interventions and contexts
that were both deemed clinically similar
and free from statistical heterogeneity,
pooling was carried out using an inverse
variance random-effects model (12).
Meta-analyses were conducted using the
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software
(version 2.2). The level of evidence was
applied to the GRADE (Grading of Recom-
mendations Assessment, Development
and Evaluation) criteria and reported.
Heterogeneity and Subgroup
Analyses
Heterogeneity was assessed and quanti-
fied using the I2 statistic. When substan-
tial heterogeneity was found (I2 . 50%),
further exploration using subgroup anal-
ysis was undertaken. For type 2 diabetes
studies, subgroup analyses were as fol-
lows: follow-up duration (,6 months
vs. .6 months), length of time with di-
abetes (,9 years vs. .9 years), age of
participants (mean age ,55 years old
vs. .55 years old), number of self-
monitoring tasks supported by the dia-
betes apps (#3 vs. .3), and types of
feedback provided. No type 1 diabetes
subgroup analyses were performed
due to the small number of studies.
Sensitivity Analyses and Publication
Bias
Additional analyses were carried out on
studies with the following: good or fair
quality, complete information, and a
baseline HbA1c level ,9.0%. A funnel
plot was used to visually inspect pub-
lication bias where 10 or more studies
were pooled.
RESULTS
Identified and Included Studies
Searches identified 5,209 articles; 4,238
were screened after removing duplicate
records and 4,178 were excluded. Sixty
studies were eligible for full text review
and 42 were excluded (Fig. 1), resulting
in 14 included studies. Four studies ex-
amined type 1 diabetes and 10 studies
examined type 2 diabetes.
Characteristics of the Included
Studies and Quality Assessment
In the 14 studies, there were 1,360 par-
ticipants: 509 and 851 with type 1 and type
2 diabetes, respectively (Supplementary
Table 1). In the type 1 diabetes studies,
the mean age of participants ranged
from 34 (13) to 36 years old (14), and
the mean duration of diabetes ranged
from 16 (13–15) to 19 years (15). Two
studies were undertaken in Europe
(13,14), one in Australia (15), and one
was multinational (16). In the type 2 di-
abetes studies, the mean age of the par-
ticipants was much higher, ranging from
51 (17) to 62 years old (18), and the
mean duration of diabetes ranged from
2090

 5 (19) to 13 years (20) from six stud-
ies. Four studies were undertaken in
Europe (18,20–22), three in the U.S.
(17,23,24), two in Asia (19,25), and one
in Africa (26).
One type 1 diabetes study was assessed
as good quality (14), two were rated as
fair (13,16), and one was rated as poor
(15) (for further details see Supple-
mentary Table 2). For type 2 diabetes stud-
ies, one was rated as good quality (21),
six were rated as fair (17–19,22,24,25),
and three were rated as poor (20,23,26)
(Supplementary Table 2).
Apps Featured in the Included Studies
Twelve diabetes apps were identified
and examined in this review, with six do-
mains of functionality (Supplementary
Table 3); details of the feedback provided
by each can be seen in Supplementary
Table 4.
Type 1 Diabetes Apps
Three apps were used for participants
with type 1 diabetes and aimed to help
patients to calculate the most appropri-
ate insulin bolus on the basis of patient
blood glucose (BG) levels, food intake,
and physical activity. Data for all three
apps were manually entered. One study
reported that there was little impact of
the app on the total time spent on face-
to-face or telephone follow-up and con-
cluded that the software did not require
more time for patients to manage their
diabetes (13). A further study estimated
the average cost to patients and educa-
tors’ time was £38 per patient, attrib-
uted to the app over a 9-month period
(15). HCP feedback was provided in all
apps, with a frequency ranging from every
week to every 3 weeks (Supplementary
Table 4).
Type 2 Diabetes Apps
Nine apps were used for participants with
type 2 diabetes. The apps were designed
to improve patient self-management
by providing personalized feedback on
self-monitoring data, such as BG, food
intake, and physical activity. In eight of
the apps, BG was automatically trans-
ferred and other data was manually en-
tered, with one exception where blood
pressure, body weight, and pedometer
were also automatically transferred
(25). Quinn et al. (17) reported that
the app was associated with shorter
consultation times. Among seven apps
with HCP feedback, three provided
feedback when needed (e.g., patient
data were considered abnormal). In
the other apps, the frequency of
feedback ranged from once a week
to once every 3 months (Supplementary
Table 4).
Effectiveness of the Apps
Type 1 Diabetes
There were mixed results from the type 1
diabetes studies. Two studies (14,16)
foundnodifferencebetweentheinterven-
tion group and the control group and
two studies (13,15) reported statistically
significant results that favored the apps.
There was a statistically insignificant
difference in HbA1c between the apps
and control group of 20.36% (95%
Cl 20.87, 0.14; P = 0.16; I2 = 87%)
(Fig. 2). No subgroup analyses were
reported.
Type 2 Diabetes
All 10 studies of type 2 diabetes re-
ported a reduction of HbA1c in partici-
pants using an app, with a median
reduction of 0.55% (range 0.15–1.87).
After pooling, the mean reduction in
HbA1c was 0.49% (95% Cl 0.30, 0.68;
P , 0.01; I2 = 10%) (Fig. 3). These results
exhibited consistent findings with no
heterogeneity. One study reported a re-
duction larger than clinically antici-
pated, which raised debate over the
legitimacy of their findings (26). After
excluding the subgroup of studies that
were assessed as poor quality, we found
a mean reduction of 0.41% (95% CI
0.22, 0.61; P , 0.001; I2 = 0%) (Fig. 3).
The level of evidence by GRADE was

 moderate due to the findings being
downgraded due to quality.
Type 2 Diabetes Subgroup Analyses
The subgroup analysis by follow-up du-
ration showed that five studies with a
shorter follow-up duration (,6 months)
displayed a larger (but nonsignificant)
HbA1c reduction than those with a
longer duration (.6 months), 0.62 vs.
0.40% (P = 0.33), respectively. There
was no difference in the reduction of
HbA1c in three studies with a mean di-
abetes duration of ,9 years (0.53%)
compared with those with a duration
$9 years (0.55%; P = 0.93). Studies of
younger participants with a mean age
of #55 years reported a larger and clini-
cally significant reduction in HbA1c level
of 1.03% compared with 0.41% in those
with an average age of .55 years, but
the result was not found to be statisti-
cally significant (P = 0.10).
In the subgroup analysis by number of
self-monitoring tasks, six diabetes apps
supported at most three self-monitoring
tasks and had results similar to the stud-
ies with more than three self-monitoring
tasks (mean reduction of 0.44 vs. 0.58%;
P = 0.56). Two studies of diabetes apps
with only automated feedback had a
small and statistically nonsignificant
change in HbA1c of –0.26% (95% CI –0.62,
0.09). When the diabetes apps that in-
cluded HCP feedback were pooled,
eight studies reported a reduction of
0.56% (95% Cl 0.35, 0.78). There was no
statistically significant difference be-
tween HCP verses automatic feedback
subgroup (P = 0.16).
Four sensitivity analyses were under-
taken to test the robustness of the re-
sults. Removing three studies (20,23,26)
with poor quality reported a mean re-
duction of 0.41% (95% Cl 0.22, 0.61)
(Fig. 3). The removal of one study (17)
with incomplete statistical information
was associated with a mean reduction
of 0.48% (95% CI 0.28, 0.67), and the
exclusion of one study (20) conducted
on mixed participants with type 1 and
type 2 diabetes had an attendant mean
reduction of 0.48% (95% Cl 0.27, 0.69).
Finally, the exclusion of two studies
(17,23) with baseline HbA1c levels .9.0%
was associated with a mean reduction of
0.47% (95% Cl 0.25, 0.69).
CONCLUSIONS
Ten studies were included for type 2 di-
abetes, predominately of fair quality.
The results of these indicated a con-
sistent reduction in HbA1c of 0.5%. Al-
though there was no indication of
heterogeneity, the study conducted by
Takenga et al. (26) introduced a large
effect that was likely to be caused by
poor study quality (high attrition rate,
differential loss to follow-up, and high
baseline HbA1c level). Thus, studies
were stratified into subgroups deter-
mined by their quality assessment (27).
No differences were found between the
subgroups, and the studies of poor
quality were included for completeness
and to highlight the challenges in study
design.
Five subgroup analyses showed that
the effect did not differ significantly by
follow-up duration, mean diabetes du-
ration of participants, mean age of par-
ticipants, number of self-monitoring
tasks supported by the diabetes apps,
or types of feedback. Compared with
studies that investigated the effective-
ness of alternative interventions such

 as text messaging, mobile device use,
and computer-based and conventional
self-management, we have found that
apps offer promising results and rein-
force the message argued by other au-
thors (3,4,28–30). The evidence for this
finding by GRADE was moderate, after
downgrading due to quality.
The subgroup analysis by follow-up
duration suggested that the effect of
diabetes apps on BG control may atten-
uate over time. A possible rationale for
this subgroup effect is a lack in user
friendliness, a lack in perceived ad-
ditional benefits, and a lack of use of
gamification elements, resulting in a
lack of efficacy following use (31). The
subgroup analysis by mean age of partic-
ipants indicated that younger patients
were more likely to benefit from the
use of the diabetes apps. It may be spec-
ulated that younger patients are more
amenable to new technologies and
more familiar with the use of mobile
phones. The subgroup analysis by per-
sonalized feedback system highlighted
the gap between automated feedback
and HCP feedback. Although automated
feedback has the advantage of being
interactive and dynamic, there is a limit
to presupposed scenarios, whereas
feedback provided by HCPs was more
individual, especially in emergency
situations. Feedback options ranged
widely between the apps, but it is pos-
tulated that it was the feedback that
triggered improved lifestyle choices,
which in turn lowered HbA1c. None of
the five sensitivity analyses changed the
overall effect size significantly, which
suggests that the findings are not sen-
sitive to these scenarios. The results of
our meta-analysis lend support to the
use of diabetes apps in diabetes self-
management, especially for type 2 di-
abetes. However, we have highlighted a
number of limitations of current diabetes
apps.
For type 1 diabetes, there was little
difference in HbA1c between interven-
tion and control groups and the results
were associated with considerable het-
erogeneity. The level of evidence by
GRADE was downgraded to very low
due to study quality, inconsistency,
and uncertainty, so the findings should
be interpreted as very uncertain and
likely to change after future research.
Furthermore, none of the apps in the
included type 1 diabetes studies had

 an automatic data uploading functional-
ity. In future studies for type 1 diabetes,
we encourage investigators to include
apps with this functionality, not only
for the purpose of being user friendly
but also for safety concerns by reducing
the risk of data entry errors.
Two studies reported on the cost-
effectiveness of the apps for type 1 dia-
betes with inconclusive findings (15,16).
Of three studies on type 2 diabetes that
discussed compliance, two highlighted
poor compliance, with only 35% of pa-
tients being recorded as regular app users
(21,24). One study (25) reported a decline
in patient use over time, from 70% in the
1st week to 50% in the last 2 weeks. Four
studies tried to explore the mechanisms
behind the effects, but the conclusions
were inconsistent (15,17,21,24). We
postulate that diabetes apps influence
lifestyle choice, but how this occurs is
unclear. One hypothesis is that the re-
minder and feedback features of diabe-
tes apps can lead to improvement in
health beliefs, self-efficacy, and social
support (32).
By the end of the decade, worldwide
mobile phone usage is anticipated to
exceed 5 billion (33). Therefore apps
may be able to offer an affordable and
widely available adjunct to diabetes self-
management. We have included stud-
ies across a variety of health care systems,
from both the developed and develop-
ing world, so we argue that the apps
are currently available and could form
the basis of improved health promo-
tion on diabetes education and self-
management.
This study had several limitations.
Since this review was restricted to pub-
lished studies, publication bias cannot
be ruled out, as highlighted by other in-
vestigators (30). All included study de-
signs were not blinded and so were
downgraded in the quality assessment
tool (highlighting the increased risk
of ascertainment bias). Furthermore,
patient-important outcomes and behav-
ioral mechanisms were not considered
and highlighted as a clear gap to be
addressed in future studies. A further
weakness is that some of the effect at-
tributed to the apps could be explained
by health care providers. Finally, there is
no clear definition of diabetes apps, and
study authors defined their interven-
tions in different ways as a result. In this
review, we defined diabetes apps as
software that is designed for use on a
mobile phone allowing patients to enter
data into the app and receive feedback.
The implications for future research
include establishing a common stan-
dardized platform of functionality. In-
vestigators of future studies need to
consider adequately powered prag-
matic RCTs with secure sequence gener-
ation, concealed allocation, use of an
active control app, and comparable ac-
cess to HCPs. Features such as these
might reduce the impact of ascertain-
ment bias, and effects due to HCPs.
RCTs with longer duration of follow-up
(.6 months) using standardized app
technology may well demonstrate ben-
eficial clinical effects in type 2 diabetes.
Furthermore, there is significant scope
for research in the use of apps in other
areas of self-management, such as in-
creasing physical activity, weight loss,
and smoking cessation.
In a clinical context, we recommend
that HCP feedback should be central in
all future app designs and supplemented
with dynamic automated feedback. Fu-
ture technology should also be under-
pinned by behavior change theories and
gamification elements to achieve a larger
effect on BG control and improve compli-
ance of patients in using diabetes apps.
Finally, future technology should also
consider the needs of older patients.
