1 | INTRODUCTION
Kidney transplant is the best treatment option for patients with end- 
stage renal disease.1 The discovery and development of potent im-
munosuppressive drugs that are able to prevent or treat rejection 
have greatly improved short- 
term graft survival rates over the past 
50 years.2 Despite these advances, various large registries show 
graft failure rates of approximately 10% within the first year after 
transplant, increasing to up to 40% at 10 years after transplant. To 
further improve the outcome of kidney transplant, there is a clear 
need for parameters that enable risk stratification for graft failure.2-7
In the Eurotransplant region, the presence of donor- 
specific 
HLA antibodies (DSAs) against a potential donor kidney causing 
complement- 
mediated lysis8 is considered a contraindication for 
transplant. These antibodies can be detected with the complement- 
dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch assay (CDC- 
XM), which has been 
the gold standard since 1969. With the more recently developed sin-
gle antigen bead (SAB) assays, DSAs can be detected with increased 
sensitivity and specificity,9 but the relation between these SAB 
assay–detected antibodies and clinical outcome is still unclear.10-14 
The presence of SAB assay–detected antibodies that do not cause 
a positive CDC- 
XM is not a contraindication for transplant but may 
indicate an increased immunological risk for rejection and allograft 
loss.15
It is well known that graft survival rates in patients who received 
a living donor kidney are higher than the rates in recipients of a 
deceased donor kidney.16 While recent large- 
cohort studies of the 
impact of DSAs on graft survival have mainly focused on deceased 
donor transplants,17-19 the effect of SAB assay–detected DSAs on 
living donor transplants has not been studied in large cohorts. In 
a Japanese single- 
center study, 324 living donor kidney transplant 
recipients were analyzed to investigate the outcome of the 92 kid-
ney transplant recipients with DSAs in combination with anti–blood 
type, anti–HLA antibodies, or both; all were desensitized before 
transplant.20 The authors reported no significant difference in graft 
survival of the different groups compared with the no- 
DSAs group 
at 1 and 5 years after transplant. As far as we could find, there were 
no large cohorts describing the effect of pretransplant DSAs with 
negative CDC- 
XM in exclusively living donor kidney transplants 
without desensitization treatment. Orandi et al21 studied the out-
comes of incompatible living donor kidney transplants based on 
the risk determined by using the SAB assay, flow cytometry cross-
match (FCXM), or CDC- 
XM and found that patients with a positive 
SAB assay and a negative FCXM (n = 185) who were desensitized 
had similar graft survival as a large group of compatible patients 
(n = 9669), while patients with a positive FCXM (n = 536) or a pos-
itive CDC- 
XM (n = 304) experienced an increased risk of graft loss. 
Another study about living donor transplants performed after a pos-
itive FCXM (n = 41) reported that the long- 
term survival was worse 
in desensitized recipients compared with matched recipients with a 
negative FCXM (n = 41).22
In a single- 
center study, including both living and deceased donor 
transplants, it was shown that patients with combined pretransplant 
HLA class I and II DSAs had an increased risk of graft loss.23 As part 
of Dutch national Profiling Consortium of Antibody Repertoire and 
Effector (PROCARE) functions, all kidney transplants performed in 
The presence of donor- 
specific anti- 
HLA antibodies (DSAs) is associated with in-
creased risk of graft failure after kidney transplant. We hypothesized that DSAs 
against HLA class I, class II, or both classes indicate a different risk for graft loss be-
tween deceased and living donor transplant. In this study, we investigated the impact 
of pretransplant DSAs, by using single antigen bead assays, on long- 
term graft sur-
vival in 3237 deceased and 1487 living donor kidney transplants with a negative 
complement- 
dependent crossmatch. In living donor transplants, we found a limited 
effect on graft survival of DSAs against class I or II antigens after transplant. Class I 
and II DSAs combined resulted in decreased 10- 
year graft survival (84% to 75%). In 
contrast, after deceased donor transplant, patients with class I or class II DSAs had a 
10- 
year graft survival of 59% and 60%, respectively, both significantly lower than the 
survival for patients without DSAs (76%). The combination of class I and II DSAs re-
sulted in a 10- 
year survival of 54% in deceased donor transplants. In conclusion, class 
I and II DSAs are a clear risk factor for graft loss in deceased donor transplants, while 
in living donor transplants, class I and II DSAs seem to be associated with an increased 
risk for graft failure, but this could not be assessed due to their low prevalence.

The Netherlands between 1995 and 2006 were evaluated retro-
spectively.24 This cohort was selected for several reasons: allocation 
or choice of immunosuppressive therapy was not influenced by the 
results of SAB assay–defined DSAs, patients had at least 10 years of 
follow- 
up and relatively modern immunosuppression. We analyzed 
whether SAB assay–detected DSAs against HLA class I and/or II in-
fluence long- 
term graft survival in deceased and living donor kidney 
transplants.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Patients, sera, and clinical data
This multicenter study included all 6097 kidney transplants per-
formed between January 1995 and December 2005 in all Dutch 
transplant centers. Patients were primarily white. In all cases, the 
T cell CDC- 
XM with current and historic highest sera was negative. 
Historic cytotoxic HLA antibodies were assigned as unacceptable for 
allocation in the Eurotransplant region. Bead assay–defined DSAs 
were not considered as risk factors in the matching procedure at that 
time and therefore had no influence in immunosuppressive treat-
ment. Informed consent for data collection and use of leftover sera 
was obtained from all subjects. Patients and donors investigated 
were predominantly white. The use of sera and experimental proto-
cols was approved by the Research Ethics Committee for Biobanks 
and the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center 
Utrecht. Moreover, this study was performed in accordance with the 
FEDERA Code of Conduct.
We obtained baseline and clinical follow- 
up transplant data from 
the Netherlands Organ Transplant Registry (NOTR), which was > 95% 
complete at time of this study. Clinical follow- 
up was recorded at 
3 months, 12 months, and yearly thereafter for at least 10 years. The 
primary endpoint of the study is graft failure, defined as loss of kidney 
function when the patient returns to dialysis or receives a retransplant. 
In the analysis of death- 
censored graft failure, recipients who died 
with a functioning graft were censored at the time of death.
Pretransplant patient sera could be collected from 4787 (78%) 
transplants of 4585 patients (some patients underwent > 1 trans-
plant). For 17 transplants, patients were lost to follow- 
up (NOTR), 
and 46 transplants were excluded because the kidney failed during 
surgery or shortly thereafter due to technical nonimmunologic prob-
lems. We included 4724 transplants in the analysis.
2.2 | Detection and definition of DSAs
The presence of HLA antibodies (HLA- 
Abs) in the pretransplant sera, 
used for pretransplant crossmatch, was assessed retrospectively 
in a central laboratory as described previously.25 In brief, sera were 
first tested for the presence of HLA class I and class II antibodies by 
using Lifecodes LifeScreen Deluxe (Immucor Transplant Diagnostics, 
Stamford, CT). Subsequently, the sera positive for HLA class I and/or 
class II were analyzed by using Lifecodes SAB assay class I and/or II kits 
(Immucor Transplant Diagnostics) to determine the exact specificity of 
the HLA- 
Abs. The LABScan 100 flow analyzer (One Lambda, Canoga 
Park, CA) was used for data acquisition. Bead positivity was defined 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, requiring a minimal 
signal:background ratio to be reached (described elsewhere25), which 
leads to virtually identical results as when taking an absolute me-
dian fluorescence intensity (MFI) cutoff of 750. The presence of SAB 
assay–detected DSAs was assigned by comparing the SAB assay–de-
tected HLA- 
A/B/DR/DQ antibody specificities on serologic level with 
the split- 
level HLA typing of the donor. For 70 antigens (47 of which 
HLA- 
DQ) in 64 transplants, we had only broad- 
level typing infor-
mation at our disposal and could not determine whether antibodies 
against some of the possible splits were DSAs. These donor antigen–
recipient antibody combinations were not considered as DSAs in the 
analyses in this study. If we assigned all these antigens as DSAs, similar 
results and the same conclusions were obtained (data not shown).
2.3 | Statistical analysis
Differences in patient, donor, and transplant characteristics between 
the DSA- 
positive and - 
negative groups were assessed by using the χ2 
test for categorical variables and Mann–Whitney U test for continu-
ous variables. Death- 
censored graft survival was assessed by using 
the adjusted Kaplan–Meier estimator (AKME) based on inverse 
probability weighting (IPW).26 The following covariates were con-
sidered for adjustment: recipient and donor age, recipient and donor 
sex, year of transplant, type of donor, cold ischemia time (CIT), re-
transplant, graft function, interleukin (IL)- 
2 receptor blocker, number 
of HLA- 
A/B/DR mismatches, transplant and highest percent PRA. 
We adjusted for recipient age (quadratic) and donor age (quadratic), 
donor type (living or deceased; for the total cohort only), CIT (for 
donation after brain death [DBD] and donation after cardiac death 
[DCD]), time on dialysis in years (quadratic), and induction therapy 
with IL- 
2 receptor blocker (Figure S1). The other covariates were not 
used for various reasons motivated as given in the Supplementary 
Information. Hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were 
derived by using multivariable Cox regression. Validity of Cox model 
assumptions were verified by evaluating uncorrected Kaplan–Meier 
(cumulative), Martingale residual, and Schoenfeld residual plots. 
Various covariates, specified in the Supplementary Information, 
were used in both the AKME and Cox regressions, to adjust for 
confounding. Two hundred twenty- 
six missing CITs were imputed 
by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) single imputation; no 
additional values were missing. Statistical analyses were performed 
with R (version 3.2.2) and SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) 
software.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Baseline characteristics
Patient, donor, and transplant characteristics stratified according to 
the presence of pretransplant DSAs are summarized in Table 1. Of 
4724 patients, 567 (12%) had pretransplant DSAs. The mean age at 
     |  2277

transplant was significantly lower in recipients with DSAs. The DSA 
group contained a higher proportion of female recipients (59% vs 38%), 
and PRA values determined with CDC were clearly related to the pres-
ence of DSAs. Additionally, there were significantly more retransplants 
in the DSA (47.6%) group. In 33% of the transplants without DSAs, the 
kidney was donated by a living donor, whereas 24% of the transplants 
with preformed DSAs had living donors. Most patients initially re-
ceived a triple immunosuppressive regimen consisting of steroids, cy-
closporine or tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine. 
In addition, 26% of the patients received induction therapy, with either 
a T cell–depleting antibody (4%) or an IL- 
2 receptor–blocking antibody 
(22%). Minimal follow- 
up time was 10 years after transplant.

3.2 | Impact of pretransplant DSAs on long- 
term 
graft survival
Using SAB assays, we determined the presence of antibodies against 
HLA- 
A/B/C/DR/DR51- 
53/DQ/DP antigens, either donor specific or 
not. As shown in a Venn diagram (Figure 1A), in 3269 (69%) of 4724 
transplants, the recipients had no pretransplant antibodies against 
HLA- 
A/B/DR/DQ antigens. The combination of anti–HLA- 
A and 
anti–HLA- 
B antibodies (without anti–HLA- 
DR/DQ antibodies) was 
relatively frequent (311/4724 [7%]), as was the combination of an-
tibodies against all 4 antigens (254/4724 [5%]). Antibodies against 
a single HLA molecule were most frequent for HLA- 
B and - 
DQ. The 
prevalence of antibodies exclusively directed against HLA- 
C, - 
DR51- 
53, or - 
DP was low in our cohort with 4, 13, and 19 positive sera, 
respectively (Table S1). Donor- 
specific antibody prevalence against 
the donor HLA loci A, B, DR, and DQ is depicted in Figure 1B. In 4157 
(88%) of the 4724 kidney transplants, recipients harbored no pre-
transplant DSAs against these antigens.
The AKME showed a 10- 
year death- 
censored graft survival of 
78% (95% CI 77%- 
80%) for the 4157 patients without and 66% (95% 
CI 64%- 
67%) for the 567 patients with DSAs in pretransplant sera 
(Figure 2A). The multivariable analysis, adjusted for the same covari-
ables, showed that the presence of DSAs was associated with a higher 
risk of graft failure (Table 2; HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.51- 
2.08).
Because our cohort contains a relatively high proportion of living 
donors, we analyzed the impact of DSAs on long- 
term graft survival 
according to donor status. For the living donor transplants (n = 1487), 
there was only a limited and nonsignificant relation between pre-
transplant DSAs and 10- 
year death- 
censored graft survival, which 
was 78% and 84% for patients with and without DSAs, respectively 
(Figure 2B, P = .07). For the deceased donor transplants (n = 3237), 
the 10- 
year death- 
censored graft survival was 60% and 76% for pa-
tients with and without DSAs, respectively (Figure 2C, P < .0001), 
demonstrating a clear adverse effect of pretransplant DSAs.
These findings were confirmed in a multivariable analysis (Table 2), 
where the presence of pretransplant DSAs had no significant influence 
on graft survival in living donor transplants (HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.95- 
2.10). In contrast, the presence of DSAs was significantly associated 
with a higher risk of graft failure after deceased donor transplants 
(HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.55- 
2.19). In Table 3, the patient, donor, and trans-
plant characteristics of living donor (n = 1487) and deceased donor 
(n = 3237) transplants are summarized. In addition, the characteristics 
for living and deceased donor transplants were further subdivided for 
transplants with DSAs (Table S2), with class I DSAs only (Table S3), with 
class II DSAs only (Table S4), and with class I and II DSAs (Table S5).
3.3 | Impact of pretransplant DSAs on early and late 
graft failure
The effect of pretransplant DSAs on graft survival was already evi-
dent early after transplant (Figure 3A,B). In living donor transplants, 
1- 
year death- 
censored graft survival for patients with and without 
DSAs was 94% and 96% (Figure 3A), respectively (Table 2; HR 1.69, 
95% CI 0.76- 
3.77). For deceased donor transplants, we found a simi-
lar effect (Figure 3B; HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.31- 
2.27).
To examine whether pretransplant DSAs also affect the risk of 
late graft failure, we separately analyzed the graft survival of the 
patients with surviving grafts at 1 year after transplant. To this end, 
70 (for living donor) and 403 (for deceased donor) grafts that failed 
or were censored in the first year were excluded and graft survival 
analysis was restarted at 100% (Figure 3C- 
D). For living donor 
transplants, a modest, nonsignificant effect of DSAs was found, 
with 82% and 87% 10- 
year death- 
censored graft survival for those 
with and without DSAs, respectively (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.86- 
2.12). 
For deceased donor transplants, however, an increased risk of graft 
failure (HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.56- 
2.44) remained with a 10- 
year death- 
censored graft survival of 70%, compared with 83% for transplants 
in patients without DSAs. Similar results were found when an early 
graft failure cutoff of 3 months was used instead of 1 year (data not 
shown). These data indicate the presence of a short- 
 and long- 
term 
effect of DSAs on graft survival in deceased donor transplants. For 
living donor transplants, no significant effect was found.
3.4 | Effect of pretransplant HLA class I and II DSAs 
on graft survival
Next, we investigated separately the effects of donor- 
specific HLA

survival within the living donor transplants. We found no effect on 
graft survival within 1 year after transplant of pretransplant DSAs 
against either class I or II antigens only, and only a limited effect of 
4% and 5% on the 10- 
year graft survival, respectively (Figure 3E; 
Table 2; HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.86- 
2.12). In contrast, in deceased donor 
transplant, the isolated presence of either class I or class II DSAs was 
clearly associated with an increased risk of graft failure (HR 1.93,

10- 
year death- 
censored graft survival of 60% and 61%, respectively, 
compared with 76% in transplants with DSA- 
negative recipients 
(Figure 3F).
The combined presence of class I and II DSAs resulted in the 
poorest graft survival for both donor types, with a decrease from 
84% to 75% at 10 years after transplant for living donor grafts (HR 
2.84, 95% CI 1.05- 
7.69) and a decrease from 76% to 54% for de-
ceased donor grafts (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.25- 
2.88).
4 | DISCUSSION
In this multicenter study, we found a limited effect of pretransplant 
SAB assay–defined DSAs on graft failure in living donor transplants. 
In contrast, pretransplant SAB assay–defined DSAs are a clear risk 
factor for graft loss in deceased donor transplantations with a nega-
tive CDC- 
XM. Further subdivision of the DSAs in deceased donor 
transplantations revealed that DSAs against either class I or II did 
constitute a significant risk factor for graft loss and pretransplant 
DSAs against both HLA class I and class II resulted in the poorest 
death- 
censored graft survival. In living donor transplants, the combi-
nation of class I and II DSAs seem to be associated with an increased 
risk for graft failure, but this could not be assessed due to their low 
prevalence.
Recently published studies on pretransplant DSAs focused 
mainly on deceased donor transplants, as these are most preva-
lent in, for example, France, Germany, and the United States.17-19 
Studies on living donor transplant are scarce; in a single- 
center 
study, where 324 living donor transplants were analyzed, no sig-
nificant difference in the 5- 
year graft survival of patients with 
DSAs was found compared with patients with anti–blood type 
antibody, anti–HLA- 
Abs, or no DSAs.20 Mohan et al19 reported a 
meta- 
analysis of DSAs detected with, among others, SAB assays 
and calculated an increased risk for graft failure in the presence of 
SAB assay–detected DSAs with negative CDC- 
XM, similar to our 
study. The effect of DSAs in living donor transplant has not been 
investigated so far in large cohorts. In The Netherlands, currently

more than half of the kidney transplants are performed with kid-
neys from living donors, while the 31% in the cohort from 1995 to 
2006 provides us with the unique means to study a cohort of 1487 
living donor transplants.
The time period of 1995- 
2006 was specifically chosen as it 
ensures sufficient follow- 
up with immunosuppressive treatment 
currently still used, without bias due to results from SAB assays in 
pretransplant risk assessment, patient/donor selection, or guidance 
of immunosuppressive treatment after transplant. Because there 
is no consensus regarding the MFI cutoff that should be used to 
determine positivity with SAB assays, we defined positivity based 
on manufacturers’ instructions by using a signal:noise ratio. Using 
different MFI cutoffs for DSA positivity resulted in comparable ef-
fects on long- 
term graft survival (Figure S2). DSA class I– and class 
II–positive transplants have a considerably higher average number of 
DSAs, average maximum MFI of DSAs, and average cumulative MFI 
of DSAs (Table S7B- 
D). The higher “strength” of DSAs as expressed 
by these 3 parameters could (partly) explain the worse graft survival 
of this group. DSA class I and II positivity, however, provides a better 
risk classifier than we were able to construct from 3 DSA strength 
parameters in this study. Other studies have shown that DSA as-
sessments using MFI alone may not be sufficient for assessing the 
potential risk for graft damage and decreased survival. Multiple as-
says are used, such as Flow- 
XM,21,27 C1q- 
SAB assays,17 C3d- 
SAB 
assays,28 or IgG- 
subclass analysis.29 Our cohort includes 63 patients 
participating in the Eurotransplant Acceptable Mismatch program 
with an HLA antibody profile based on CDC, in some cases supple-
mented with solid phase assays.30 Inclusion of this patient group did 
not induce bias as we observed no major impact on our conclusions 
if we excluded these patients from our cohort (data not shown). We 
excluded 46 transplants because the kidney failed during surgery or 
shortly thereafter due to technical nonimmunologic problems. The 
impact of inclusion and exclusion of these patients on graft survival 
was equal for both groups (DSAs versus no DSAs).
Our study has a few limitations. Because we collected sera retro-
spectively, we were able to collect 78% in total. We are mainly miss-
ing sera from older transplants of 4 centers, while from the other 3 
centers we collected > 90%. Limited information was available on 
rejection and donor organ quality, and we do not have information 
on posttransplant (de novo) DSA formation. This is a retrospective 
cohort of kidney transplants between 1995 and 2005, so the reg-
istration of rejections was limited. We have information only on 
whether patients were treated for a rejection including the date of 
rejection and, if performed, the date of biopsy. At that time, biopsies 
were not always performed, and, therefore, some of the registered 
rejections might not have been actual rejections. On the other hand, 
rejections might have been missed or not registered. Others have 
shown that in living donor transplants, DSAs was an important pre-
dictor of antibody- 
mediated rejection, while this was not the case 
for graft failure.31 Using the limited rejection data that we had, we 
observed that patients with pretransplant DSAs had a higher inci-
dence of rejection in living as well as deceased donor transplants 
(data not shown).
For posttransplant DSAs determined using SAB assays, it was 
already shown that it has an adverse effect on graft survival.18 
For our cohort, we can assess only the potential for confounding

by de novo DSAs via the average number of HLA mismatches. 
Because the DSA- 
positive groups have fewer mismatches for 
all HLA loci (Table S9), we expect to be underestimating rather 
than overestimating the effect of pretransplant DSAs in that 
respect. We also find fewer mismatches for all loci in deceased 
donor transplants. In addition, the difference in impact of DSAs 
on graft survival between living and deceased donor transplant 
is likely not due to difference in either DSA strength (Table S7a)

or immunization status, as there was no stronger effect of DSAs 
on graft survival in patients retransplanted with a living donor 
kidney, than in patients receiving a living donor kidney as first 
transplant with a much lower level of immunization (Table S8; 
 
Figure S3; Figure S4). However, it is known that graft survival 
rates of poorly HLA- 
matched living donor grafts are superior to 
those of well HLA- 
matched deceased donor grafts.16,32 This can 
partially be explained by the prolonged CIT in deceased donors 
but also by inherent factors of the organ due to cardiovascular 
instability of the donor before nephrectomy, who may play a 
role.33 Donor kidney quality is of importance when transplanting 
patients with DSAs. Relevant variables regarding kidney quality 
are, for example, donor age, (deceased) donor type, CIT, and graft 
function, which are all available in our database. We corrected 
in our multivariable analysis analyzing the effect of pretransplant 
DSAs on graft survival for donor age, donor type, and CIT (CIT 
only in deceased donor transplant) but not for (delayed) graft 
function, as this might be caused by the preexistent DSAs.
Interindividual differences in the level of HLA antigen expres-
sion on the cell surface have been shown to affect the CDC-

impact of preformed DSAs against HLA class I or class II in living 
donor transplant compared with deceased donor transplant might 
be explained by a lower expression of HLA and adhesion mole-
cules on the endothelial cells in living donor organs compared with 
those of deceased donors.35 In our cohort of 1487 living donor 
kidney transplants, the combination of class I and II antibodies oc-
curred in only 18 cases, indicating that the prevalence of this risk 
factor is relatively low.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that in the presence of 
negative CDC- 
XM, SAB assay–defined DSAs against either HLA 
class I or HLA class II is a significant risk factor in deceased donor 
transplant, but this seems not to be the case in living donor trans-
plant. The combined presence of DSAs against HLA class I and II has 
a much stronger negative impact on graft survival after deceased 
donor transplant, while in living donor transplants class I and II 
DSAs seem to be associated with an increased risk for graft failure. 
However, this could not be assessed due to their low prevalence. 
Based on these results, we suggest that the combination of class I 
and II DSAs be taken into account in the allocation of donor kidneys 
in Eurotransplant region. Moreover, recipients with this combination 
of DSAs should be considered as patients with a higher risk of graft 
failure.
