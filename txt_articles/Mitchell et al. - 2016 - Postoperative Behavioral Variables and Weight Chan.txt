Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Severe obesity (body mass index ≥35 [calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by height in meters squared]) is associated with significant medical comorbidity and 
increased mortality. Bariatric surgery induces weight loss, the extent of which can vary. 
Postoperative predictors of weight loss have not been adequately examined.

 OBJECTIVE—To describe postoperative eating behaviors and weight control and their effects on 
3-year change in weight.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric 
Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study is a multicenter observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals in 6 
geographically diverse clinical centers. Adults undergoing first-time bariatric surgical procedures 
as part of routine clinical care were recruited between 2006 and 2009 and followed up until 
September 2012. Participants completed detailed surveys regarding eating and weight control 
behaviors prior to surgery and then annually after surgery for 3 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Twenty-five postoperative behaviors related to eating 
behavior, eating problems, weight control practices, and the problematic use of alcohol, smoking, 
and illegal drugs. Behaviors examined were divided into those that were never present 
(preoperatively or postoperatively), those that were always present (preoperatively and 
postoperatively), and those that underwent a healthy change after surgery (development of a 
positive behavior or omission of a negative behavior).
RESULTS—The sample included a total of 2022 participants (median age, 47 years [interquartile 
range, 38–55 years]; median BMI, 46 [interquartile range, 42–51]; 78% women): 1513 who had 
undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 509 who had undergone laparoscopic adjustable gastric 
banding. If we consider the cumulative effects of the 3 behaviors that explain most of the 
variability (16%) in 3-year percent weight change following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, ie, weekly 
self-weighing, continuing to eat when feeling full more than once a week, and eating continuously 
during the day, a participant who postoperatively started to self-weigh, stopped eating when 
feeling full, and stopped eating continuously during the day after surgery would be predicted to 
lose a mean (SE) of 38.8% (0.8%) of their baseline weight. This average is about 14% greater 
weight loss compared with participants who made no positive changes in these variables (mean 
[SE], −24.6% [1.6%]; mean difference, −14.2%; 95% CI, −18.7% to −9.8%; P < .001) and 6% 
greater weight loss compared with participants who always reported positive on these healthy 
behaviors (mean [SE], −33.2% [0.6%]; mean difference, −5.7%; 95% CI, −7.8% to −3.5%; P < .
001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—The results suggest the importance of assessing 
behaviors related to eating behavior, eating problems, weight control practices, and the 
problematic use of alcohol, smoking, and illegal drugs in bariatric surgery candidates and patients 
who have undergone bariatric surgery, and they suggest that the utility of programs to modify 
problematic eating behaviors and eating patterns should be addressed in research.
It is important to identify variables that are associated with, or predictive of, successful 
weight loss outcomes to better evaluate potential risks and benefits to the use of bariatric 
surgery for treating those with severe obesity. Much research in this area has focused on 
preoperative factors. In a recent article by Arterburn et al,1 patients were more likely to lose 
30% or more of their baseline weight if they were female and white. Other preoperative 
factors that have been identified, not always consistently, have included body mass index 
(BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), preoperative 
weight loss, level of physical activity, diabetes, early referral for bariatric surgery, and 
various psychological and eating behavior variables.2–4 The topic of psychosocial 
preoperative predictor variables was recently reviewed by Livhits et al,5 who reported that

 mandatory preoperative weight loss and lower BMI were possibly factors predictive of better 
weight loss after surgery.
Of particular interest for this report are studies that have examined specific eating behaviors, 
eating problems, and weight control practices as postoperative predictors of weight loss. 
Postoperative positive changes in eating habits predicted better outcomes in 1236 bariatric 
patients registered with the French National Medical Insurance Service.6 Research 
previously reported that adherence to prescribed food intake guidelines was associated with 
greater weight loss.7 Kruseman et al8 calculated dietary intake from 80 patients’ food diaries 
at 8 years following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and concluded that less intake was 
associated with higher rates of achieving greater than 50% excess weight loss. The 
emergence or reemergence of problems with binge eating (defined as eating an objectively 
large amount of food accompanied by a sense of loss of control over eating) as well as the 
emergence or reemergence of loss-of-control eating (defined as eating accompanied by a 
sense of loss of control, but not necessarily ingesting an objectively large amount of food) 
have also been demonstrated to be associated with attenuated weight loss or greater weight 
regain.9 Other postoperative problematic eating behaviors that have been associated 
postoperatively with less weight loss have included grazing, snacking, and eating when not 
hungry.10–13 Studies have also found that nocturnal eating episodes, stress-induced eating, 
and a composite measure of aberrant eating behaviors, which included eating when not 
hungry,14–16 were all associated with poorer weight loss. Conversely, other studies have not 
found an association between less weight loss or greater weight regain and postoperative 
night eating syndrome, rate of eating, and number of daily meals.17–19 Other postoperative 
eating-related changes also may result in better weight loss, including decreasing calorie and 
fat intake, lower postoperative disinhibition, less objective hunger, and fewer cravings for 
sweets.20 Regular self-weighing has also been associated with better weight loss 
maintenance. However, most of the studies have included a small number of participants, 
and the definitions for various problematic eating behaviors have varied widely or not been 
well stipulated. Therefore, we studied various eating behaviors, chosen because of prior 
mention in the literature and/or consensus of their possible utility among the investigators, 
and their relation to weight loss in a large cohort of bariatric surgery patients followed up 
prospectively.
Methods
Patients
The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study is an observational 
cohort study of 2458 adults who underwent initial RYGB, laparoscopic adjustable gastric 
banding (LAGB), or other bariatric procedure at one of 10 centers across the United States.
21 Participants (1738 RYGB, 610 LAGB, 110 other procedure) underwent surgery between 
March 2006 and April 2009 (eFigure in the Supplement). This report used data collected 
preoperatively and up to 3 years following surgery, through 2012. Details regarding data 
collection,22 cohort baseline characteristics,23 and weight and medical comorbidity 
outcomes at 3 years24 have been previously published. The institutional review board at each

 center approved the protocol and consent forms. All participants provided written informed 
consent.
Weight Change
Weight change is reported as the percent change from baseline weight and was measured 
within 30 days prior to surgery and 3 years following surgery. During in-person follow-up 
visits, weight was measured using a standard protocol on a study-purchased standard scale 
(Tanita Body Composition Analyzer, model TBF-310). If an in-person weight was not 
obtained, weight was measured by research or medical personnel on a nonstudy scale 
(14.0% of weights). If neither an in-person nor clinical weight was available, a self-reported 
weight was used (16.2%). Differences between measured and self-reported weights for a 
sample of participants from the LABS-2 cohort have previously been reported as small.25
The 36 participants whose initial bariatric procedure was subsequently reversed or revised 
before the 3-year weight measurement were excluded, as were 25 women in their second or 
third trimester of pregnancy or up to 6 months post partum when weighed at year 3.
Behaviors
This analysis focused on postoperative behaviors, many of which were deemed modifiable, 
that related to eating behavior and eating problems, weight control practices, and the 
problematic use of alcohol, smoking, and illegal drugs. These were grouped into positive 
behaviors and negative behaviors. The behaviors listed in Table 1 were all assessed via self-
administered questionnaires described previously,23 at baseline and at follow-up years 1, 2, 
and 3. Participants were considered to have regularly seen a nutritionist/dietitian or trainer/
exercise specialist if they self-reported seeing such an individual at least 6 times in the last 6 
months. Participants were identified as engaging in a given weight control practice (eg, 
counting fat grams) if they reported doing so regularly during the previous 6 months. 
Participants were identified as having eaten a meal regularly if they reported regularly eating 
the meal 6 to 7 times per week. The form also asked, “During the past 6 months, have you 
had times when you ate continuously during the day or parts of the day without planning 
what and how much you would eat?”; this question was designed to assess the behavior 
labeled as grazing. Detailed definitions of binge-eating disorder, loss-of-control eating, night 
eating syndrome, and alcohol use disorder have been reported previously.26,27
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics summarize baseline characteristics for each procedure, with 
frequencies and percentages used for categorical data and medians and interquartile ranges 
(IQRs) for continuous data. The baseline characteristics of participants with behavioral 
questionnaires at every time (preoperatively and after 1, 2, and 3 years of follow-up) were 
compared with participants missing at least 1 behavioral questionnaire. Statistical 
significance was tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous data and Pearson 
χ2 test for categorical data.
Linear regression models were constructed by procedure for each behavior. The response 
variable was year 3 percent weight change, and the variables of interest were the modifiable

 behaviors represented by 4 binary variables indicating whether the behavior was reported as 
being practiced at each assessment time (baseline and years 1, 2, and 3). Three types of 
behavioral patterns were estimated from the binary variables: (1) never, indicating the 
participant reported not engaging in the behavior at baseline or at any follow-up time; (2) 
always, indicating the participant reported engaging in the behavior at baseline and at every 
follow-up time; and (3) start/stop, indicating the participant started a positive behavior (eg, 
self-weighing; ie, first reported not engaging in the behavior at baseline but then engaging in 
the behavior at every follow-up time) or stopped a negative behavior (eg, binge eating; ie, 
first reported engaging in the behavior at baseline but then not engaging in the behavior at 
every follow-up time). Each model controlled for age at time of surgery, baseline BMI, and 
sex. In addition, RYGB models controlled for preoperative diabetes status and LAGB 
models controlled for band size (large vs small) because these baseline factors were found to 
be significantly associated with 3-year weight change.28 Participants with missing 3-year 
weight data were excluded from the analysis (eFigure in the Supplement). The models were 
fit using full information maximum likelihood, which allowed us to use all available 
information. Participants with a 3-year weight who have behavior data for at least 1 time 
(baseline, 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years) were included.
For each behavior, pairwise comparisons were made between each combination of the 3 
patterns. These P values and confidence limits were adjusted for multiple comparisons using 
the Bonferroni correction. Model-based estimates were not reported if a behavioral pattern 
was uncommon (<5 participants with complete data reported the pattern).
Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute, Inc). All 
reported P values are 2-sided. The P values that were not corrected were considered 
statistically significant if less than .05.
Results
Cohort Description
As shown in the eFigure in the Supplement, 3 years after surgery, weight was obtained for 
1513 of 1670 participants (91%) who had undergone RYGB and 509 of 548 participants 
(93%) who had undergone LAGB. For the total of 2022 participants included in this 
analysis, the median age was 47 years (IQR, 38–55 years); the median BMI was 46 (IQR, 
42–51); and 78% were women. Among these participants, the observed median percent 
weight loss 3 years after surgery was 31.5% (IQR, 24.6%–38.4%; range, 59.2% loss to 0.9% 
gain) for RYGB and 16.0% (IQR, 8.1%–23.1%; range, 56.1% loss to 12.5% gain) for 
LAGB. The median 3-year weight loss was 40 kg (IQR, 31–52 kg; range, 110-kg loss to 1-
kg gain) for RYGB and 20 kg (IQR, 10–29 kg; range, 75-kg loss to 20-kg gain) for LAGB.
Eating Patterns and Behaviors
Most participants who underwent RYGB and LAGB completed behavioral questionnaires at 
baseline and all 3 follow-up times; 89% of those who underwent RYGB and 90% of those 
who underwent LAGB completed at least 2 behavioral questionnaires. For both procedures, 
there were no statistically significant differences in preoperative BMI or sex between

 participants with a behavioral questionnaire at every time and those missing at least 1 
questionnaire. Participants missing at least 1 behavioral questionnaire were significantly 
younger (RYGB: median age, 43 years [IQR, 35–51 years]; LAGB: median age, 46 years 
[IQR, 35–55 years]) compared with participants with complete behavioral data (RYGB: 
median age, 49 years [IQR, 39–56 years]; P < .001; LAGB: median age, 50 years [IQR, 40–
57 years]; P = .01).
eTable 1 in the Supplement shows the unadjusted relationships between the changes in each 
behavior and year 3 weight change. The mean weight changes are divided into the never, 
always, and healthy change categories. The mean (SE) weight loss was greater among those 
in the self-weighing weekly category who started this positive behavior postoperatively 
(−33.9% [0.5%]) compared with those who never engaged in this behavior (−31.0% [0.6%]; 
mean difference, −3.0%; 95% CI, −4.9% to −1.1%; P < .001) or those who had always 
engaged in this behavior (−31.7% [0.4%]; mean difference, −2.3%; 95% CI, −3.6% to 
−0.9%; P < .001). Those who had started to count fat grams also lost significantly more 
weight (mean [SE], −35.8% [1.7%]) than those who had never done so (mean [SE], −31.3% 
[0.3%]; mean difference, −4.5%; 95% CI, −7.9% to −1.1%; P = .01). The mean (SE) weight 
loss was greater in those who began using a very low-calorie diet (−35.6% [1.4%]) than 
those who had never done so (−31.1% [0.3%]; mean difference, −4.6%; 95% CI, −7.4% to 
−1.7%; P = .002); it was also greater in those who ceased between-meal snacking (−35.6% 
[1.4%]) than those who had never done so (−31.1% [0.3%]; mean difference, −4.5%; 95% 
CI, −7.5% to −1.5%; P = .003). Those who no longer had problems with loss-of-control 
eating had greater mean (SE) weight loss (−34.6% [0.6%]) than those who had never 
reported loss-of-control eating (−32.6% [0.3%]; mean difference, −2.0%; 95% CI, −3.5% to 
−0.6%; P = .003) and greater weight loss than those who had always had problems with 
loss-of-control eating (−28.1% [0.6%]; mean difference, −6.5%; 95% CI, −8.5% to −4.5%; P 
< .001). The mean (SE) weight loss was greater in those who changed and began eating 
breakfast regularly (−32.8% [0.6%]) than those who had always eaten breakfast regularly 
(−31.2% [0.4%]; mean difference, −1.6%; 95% CI, −3.1% to −0.1%; P = .03); it was also 
greater in those who changed and began eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner regularly 
(−32.9% [0.6%]) than those who had always engaged in this behavior (−31.3% [0.4%]; 
mean difference, −1.6%; 95% CI, −3.1% to −0.2%; P = .02).
Relative to eating when full, eating when not hungry, and eating continuously throughout the 
day, those who made healthy changes in these behaviors lost significantly greater amounts of 
weight (mean [SE], −33.9% [0.5%], −33.6% [0.5%], and −34.8% [0.6%], respectively) than 
those who had never engaged in these behaviors (mean [SE], −31.3% [0.3%], −31.5% 
[0.3%], and −33.2% [0.4%], respectively) and those who had always engaged in these 
behaviors (mean [SE], −24.7% [1.5%], −25.8% [1.1%], and −29.2% [0.4%]) (P = .01 for 
stopping vs never eating continuously throughout the day; P < .001 for all other behaviors; 
eTable 1 in the Supplement). Overall, this suggests that having never engaged in certain 
negative behaviors was associated with greater weight loss, but overall the greatest weight 
loss was achieved by those who made healthy changes.

 In eTable 2 in the Supplement, the unadjusted relationship between the change in each 
modifiable behavior and year 3 percent weight change is given for the LAGB group. The 
results were similar to those for the RYGB group.
Multiple Behavior Changes
Multiple behavior changes were associated with greater weight loss. If we consider the 
cumulative effects of the 3 behaviors that explain most of the variability (16%) in 3-year 
percent weight change following RYGB, ie, weekly self-weighing, continuing to eat when 
feeling full more than once a week, and eating continuously during the day, a participant 
who post-operatively started to self-weigh, stopped eating when feeling full, and stopped 
eating continuously during the day would be predicted to lose a mean (SE) of 38.8% (0.8%) 
of their baseline weight (Table 2). This average is about 14% greater weight loss compared 
with participants who made no positive changes in these variables (mean [SE], −24.6% 
[1.6%]; mean difference, −14.2%; 95% CI, −18.7% to −9.8%; P < .001) and 6% greater 
weight loss compared with participants who always reported positive on these healthy 
behaviors (mean [SE], −33.2% [0.6%]; mean difference, −5.7%; 95% CI, −7.8% to −3.5%; 
P < .001). Similar results were obtained for LAGB (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
The unadjusted relationships between the changes in each predictor and 3-year percent 
weight change are shown in eTable 3 and eTable 4 in the Supplement. Model fits were 
assessed using standardized root mean square residual; these data are shown in eTable 5 and 
eTable 6 in the Supplement. Fit summary examples are shown in eTable 7 and eTable 8 in 
the Supplement. The exact number of participants representing each variable in Table 1 are 
shown in eTable 9 in the Supplement.
Discussion
The results of this study suggest that certain behaviors, many of which are modifiable, are 
associated with weight loss differences of significant impact in patients undergoing RYGB 
or LAGB. The magnitude of this difference is large and clinically meaningful. In particular, 
the data suggest that developing positive changes in behavior, including ceasing negative 
behaviors or increasing positive behaviors, can affect the amount of weight loss. However, 
the cumulative effect of changing several of these behaviors, eg, initiating self-weighing and 
ceasing both eating when full and eating continuously during the day, is additive. Relative to 
the prior literature in this area, it has previously been shown that after RYGB, decreased 
intake of calories8 and fat,9 better dietary adherence,6 denying a snack-eating pattern,10 
decreased food urges, and a lower prevalence of grazing10 have all been associated with 
greater weight loss. After LAGB, it has been shown that decreased hunger and disinhibition,
20 better dietary compliance,7 improved eating behavior and changes to healthier eating 
patterns,21,29 less “nonhunger” eating,30 and less “uncontrolled eating”30 are associated with 
better weight loss outcomes.31 Also, a recent report from the Swedish Obese Subjects study 
found that participants who had lower levels of disinhibition and hunger at 6 months and 1 
year lost more weight at 2-, 6-, and 10-year follow-up.32 While most of these studies have 
been of modest sample size, usually 200 participants or fewer, there have been exceptions 
with larger sample sizes.6,10,28,29 Also of note, research on obesity treatment in general

 suggests positive benefits for self-weighing,33 regular breakfast eating,34 and increased 
consumption of fruits and vegetables.35 In general, these results are quite compatible with 
reports from the National Weight Control Registry, which tracks more than 10 000 
individuals who have successfully lost weight and maintained the weight loss.36 However, 
most of the research on bariatric surgery has focused on only 1 or a few eating-related or 
weight control variables. Thus, while such positive changes in eating behavior have been 
implicated before in improving weight loss outcomes, this is the first large-scale, multicenter 
study using a prospective design with commonly used definitions and a variety of such 
behaviors to document the importance and to quantify the magnitude of these changes 
(eAppendix in the Supplement).
The finding that those who adopted healthier eating behaviors lost more weight than those 
who had always engaged in them is of interest. One possible explanation is that those in the 
latter group had already experienced the benefits of those behaviors before surgery in terms 
of weight regulation.
The strengths of this study include the sample size and the careful assessment of eating 
problems, eating behaviors, and weight loss practices by self-assessment using the multi-
center design. These speak to the generalizability of the findings. The study does have 
limitations. All behavior change data are based on self-report, and it is certainly possible that 
some or many of these variables are proxy variables for some unmeasured variable. 
However, changes in these variables were associated with weight loss changes of 
considerable magnitude, suggesting that these are relevant issues. This was an observational 
cohort study, and the data cannot be interpreted to demonstrate a causal relationship between 
weight loss and eating and weight behaviors. The direction of influence cannot be 
ascertained. For example, successful weight loss may encourage patients to engage in more 
healthy behaviors, and weight regain may drive the decision to cease healthy behaviors. 
Fifth, one cannot say whether the patients in the second group had not tried or actually 
engaged in healthier behaviors at some point.
Conclusions
The results indicate that certain weight control practices and eating behaviors that can be 
assessed after bariatric surgery can significantly influence the amount of weight loss after 
bariatric surgery. This suggests that structured programs to modify problematic eating 
behaviors and eating patterns following bariatric surgery should be evaluated as a method to 
improve weight outcomes among patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The results also 
underscore the need for health care professionals to target these behaviors in the 
postoperative period.

 Key Points
Question
What are the postoperative predictors of the amount of subsequent weight loss following 
bariatric surgery in severely obese adults?
Findings
In a cohort study of 2022 post–bariatric surgery patients from 10 US hospitals in the 
Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study, those patients who 
adopted healthier eating and weight control behaviors after surgery experienced 
significantly greater weight loss than other patients.
Meaning
Addressing problematic eating and weight control behaviors, many of which are 
potentially modifiable, may improve weight loss substantially following bariatric surgery.

aThe following are the behavior patterns: behavior pattern 1, never self-weighed, always kept eating when full, and always ate continuously; behavior pattern 2, always self-weighed, never kept eating when 
full, and never ate continuously; and behavior pattern 3, started self-weighing, stopped eating when full, and stopped eating continuously. Never indicates participant reported not doing the behavior at 
baseline or at any follow-up time; always, participant reported doing the behavior at baseline and at every follow-up time; started, participant reported not doing the behavior at baseline and doing the 
behavior at every follow-up time; and stopped, participant reported doing the behavior at baseline and not doing the behavior at every follow-up time.
