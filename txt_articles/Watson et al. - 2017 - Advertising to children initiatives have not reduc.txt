ABSTRACT
Background In response to rising childhood obesity rates, the Australian food industry implemented two initiatives in 2009 to reduce the
marketing of unhealthy food to children. This study evaluated the efficacy of these initiatives on the rate of unhealthy food advertising to
children on Australian television.
Methods The rates of food advertisements on three free-to-air commercial television channels and a youth-oriented digital channel in Sydney,
Australia were analysed over 2 weekdays (16 h) and two weekend days (22 h). Advertisements were categorized according to the healthiness of
foods advertised (non-core, core, miscellaneous) and signatory status to the food industry advertising initiatives.
Results Total food advertising rates for the three channels increased from 5.5/h in 2011 to 7.3/h in 2015, due to an increase of 0.8/h for both
core and miscellaneous foods. The rate of non-core food advertisements in 2015 (3.1/h) was similar to 2011 (3.0/h). The youth-oriented
channel had fewer total food advertisements (3.7/h versus 7.3/h) but similar fast-food advertisement rates (1.3/h versus 1.3/h).
Conclusions There was no change in the rate of unhealthy food advertising since 2011, suggesting minimal impact of the current food
industry initiatives on reducing children’s exposure to unhealthy food advertising.

Introduction
The advertising of unhealthy food influences children’s
awareness of brands, positive attitudes to and preferences
for products, purchase intent and consumption.1,2 Limiting
exposure of children to unhealthy food marketing has been
identified by the World Health Organization as a cost-
effective, low-cost, population-wide intervention to reduce
diet-related risk factors for non-communicable diseases,
including obesity.3 Recently, the World Health Organization’s
Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity recommenda-
tions included to reduce exposure of children to marketing
of unhealthy foods and beverages.4
Currently, regulation of food advertising to children in
Australia includes limited government regulation of chil-
dren’s programs (C- and P- (pre-school) programs) through
the Children’s Television Standards 20095 and voluntary
self-regulated advertising and food industry initiatives.6,7
The Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) manages
two initiatives introduced in 2009, the Responsible Children’s
Marketing Initiative (RCMI) for food and beverage grocery
manufacturers and the Quick Service Restaurant Initiative
(QSRI) for fast-food companies.6,7 A total of 18 food and
grocery companies and seven fast food companies—some of
the largest national and multinational food and beverage com-
panies according to the AFGC—are signatories to the RCMI
and QSRI, respectively.8 The initiatives aim to reduce adver-
tising and marketing communications to children for food
and beverage products that do not represent healthier
choices.6,7 It is difficult to determine advertising budgets to
compare profiles of signatory and non-signatory companies,
however, signatories to the initiatives represented 67% of all

 food and beverage advertising between March and May
2011.9,10 Studies have highlighted loopholes within these
initiatives including the definitions of what constitutes ‘adver-
tising to children’ and ‘unhealthy food’.11–14 Though the
clauses of the initiatives were reviewed by the industry in
2014, major loopholes were not addressed.15
In Australia, there are three main broadcasting channels
on free-to-air commercial television, the Seven Network,
Nine Network and Network Ten (primary channels). In
recent years, digital multi-channels have been introduced by
the three commercial television licensees. Since legislative
amendments in 2013, licensees have been permitted to meet
their quota obligations for children’s programming content
across their television services.16 A survey of children’s view-
ing habits in 2013 found that the three commercial licensees
screened 72% of children’s programs on non-primary
channels.16
Previous independent monitoring of the three primary
channels showed minimal changes in the rate of unhealthy
food advertising to children from 2006 to 2011,17 however,
there has been no follow-up study since the introduction of
non-primary channels and following extended implementa-
tion of the food industry self-regulatory initiatives. This
study aims to investigate the impact of the self-regulatory
initiatives four years after the last independent monitoring
study of television food advertising in Sydney, Australia.
Methods
Sample
All advertisements broadcast on four Sydney free-to-air
commercial television channels (7, 9, 10 (primary channels)
and GO! (a non-primary, nine network digital multi-channel))
were recorded from 06.00 to 21.00 h daily over a consecu-
tive four-day period from 21st May 2015 (Thursday) to 24th
May 2015 (Sunday). The four days selected were not holi-
days or when major events were held and there were no new
release or finales of television shows. The channels, month
and hours selected were consistent with previous stud-
ies12,17–19 to allow comparison. An additional non-primary
channel (GO!) was added to reflect changes in children’s
viewing habits. GO! was selected as it broadcast over half of
the top C- and P-rated programs in 2013 and was the free-
to-air commercial channel most frequently mentioned by
parents when asked their child’s favourite channel.20,21
Consistent with the most recent study,17 advertisements that
aired during children’s peak viewing times were analysed.
Peak viewing times were defined as 06.00 to 09.00 and
16.00 to 21.00 on weekdays and 06.00 to 12.00 and 16.00
to 21.00 on weekends. Of the 152 h analysed, there was a
40-min error in the recorded data on one channel, which
accounted for one advertisement period (0.1% total adver-
tisements coded).
Coding
The coding framework from the previous study was used to
ensure comparability.17 Food advertisements were identified
and coded into categories (core, non-core and miscellan-
eous) and subcategories according to food groups; and fast-
food advertisements were further coded into subcategories
(core, non-core and miscellaneous)17 (Supplementary Table).
For food subcategories with nutrient criteria (e.g. low-sugar
and high-fibre breakfast cereals), nutrition information of
products was sourced from the nutrition information panel
on the packaging or the manufacturer’s website. Core foods
were defined as those recommended (in the Australian
Dietary Guidelines) to be selected daily. Non-core foods
were
those
considered
as
discretionary
foods
in
the
Australian Dietary Guidelines, i.e. those foods higher in
energy, sugar, fat and/or sodium and low in micronutrients
and not considered essential for a healthy diet.22 The miscel-
laneous grocery category included dietary supplements,
supermarkets, flavours and seasonings; and the miscellan-
eous fast-food category included advertisements for brands
without food specified.
This study used a different classification system to that
used in the AFGC self-regulatory initiatives because the cri-
teria used by the initiatives are not standardized or inde-
pendently derived.14 Under the RCMI, each individual
signatory company sets its own nutrition criteria in its com-
pany action plan and some companies who state they do not
advertise to children do not have criteria.6 The QSRI applies
a single nutrition standard, but it is only applicable to chil-
dren’s meals comprising a main and a beverage and does not
consider other food items.7 Criteria based on the Australian
Dietary Guidelines provided a single evidence-based nutri-
tion standard for this study.
Signatory status of advertising companies to the RCMI
and QSRI were coded.
Inter-coder reliability
Coding was performed by two researchers independently. A
researcher from the previous study17 was consulted to clarify
coding. Inter-coder reliability was determined by Cohen’s κ
tests. On 10 random unique fast-food advertisements, per-
fect agreement (1.00) was achieved. In addition, agreements
of 0.93 were achieved for coding the advertisements (food
or non-food), food categories and subcategories on two ran-
dom half-hour programs.

 Analysis
The number and mean rate (frequency per hour per chan-
nel) of food advertisements were calculated and analysed
according to: (i) healthiness of foods advertised based on
the food category; and (ii) RCMI or QSRI signatory status.
Mean rates for primary channels 7, 9 and 10 were aggre-
gated to compare with 2011 results. Statistical analyses were
conducted using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corporation,
Armonk, USA). Data for 2011 were obtained from the
authors of the previous study17 and mean rates were com-
pared using independent-sample T-tests. P-values of <0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 6023 advertisements were identified, of which
16% (n = 973) were food advertisements. Of food advertise-
ments, non-core advertisements accounted for the largest
proportion (44%), including 21% fast-food advertisements.
Healthiness of foods advertised on primary
channels
On primary channels there were 7.3 food advertisements
per hour per channel. Non-core foods were advertised at a
significantly higher mean rate than core foods (3.1/h versus
2.1/h), t(226) = 4.01, P < 0.001; and miscellaneous foods
(3.1/h versus 2.2/h), t(226) = 3.32, P = 0.001.
Of non-core food advertisements, fast-food was the most
frequently advertised subcategory (1.3/h), followed by choc-
olate and confectionery (0.7/h), and sugar-sweetened drinks
(0.4/h) (Supplementary Table). Categories of core foods
with the highest mean rate of advertisements were dairy pro-
ducts (0.6/h), meat and alternatives (0.5/h), and fruit and
vegetable products (0.4/h). Supermarkets or fresh produce
markets (45%) and producer-owned organizations, e.g. Meat
and Livestock Australia (5%) were the main core food
advertisers. In the miscellaneous food category, dietary sup-
plements (0.9/h) were advertised most frequently.
Comparison with 2011 results
Total food advertising rates increased significantly from 5.5/h
in 2011 to 7.3/h in 2015, (t(226) = −3.81, P < 0.001), due to
an increase of 0.8/h for both core foods and miscellaneous
foods (Table 1). The rate of non-core food advertisements
was not significantly different in 2011 (3.0/h) compared to
2015 (3.1/h), t(226) = 0.26, P = 0.79. There was no signifi-
cant difference between the rates of fast-food advertisements
in 2011 (1.4/h) and 2015 (1.3/h), t(226) = 0.47, P = 0.63 and
other non-core food advertisements in 2011 (1.6/h) and 2015
(1.8/h), t(226) = 0.75, P = −0.44.
The increase in the mean rate of miscellaneous advertise-
ments was due to an increase of 0.5/h in both dietary sup-
plement and supermarket advertisements. The increase in
core food advertisements was due to increases in advertise-
ments for dairy products (0.2/h), core protein foods (0.3/h),
fruit and vegetables (0.4/h) and low-sugar, high-fibre breakfast
cereals (0.3/h) and a decrease in core meal advertisements
(0.3/h).
Rates of advertising on the youth-oriented channel
GO! had a lower total advertisement rate than the primary
channels (33.7/h versus 41.6/h). The mean food advertise-
ment rate on GO! was half that of the primary channels
(3.7/h versus 7.3/h), while the mean rate of fast-food adver-
tisements (1.3/h) was similar to the mean of the three
primary channels (1.3/h) (Table 1). Of the fast-food adver-
tisements on GO! 69% were for a children’s meal compared

 with 4% on Channel nine while no advertisements for chil-
dren’s meals were captured on Channels 7 and 10.
Foods advertised by RCMI and QSRI signatories
(all channels)
RCMI signatories had significantly lower mean advertising
rates for total food, core food and miscellaneous food
advertisements than non-signatories (Table 2). There was no
significant difference in non-core food advertisement rates
between RCMI signatories and non-signatories, with signa-
tories contributing 55% of non-core advertisements.
In contrast, 83% of non-core fast-food advertisements
were by QSRI signatories, with the mean rate significantly
higher than non-signatories (Table 2). Of the 202 fast-food
advertisements, only two advertised core fast-foods and they
were by a non-signatory. Of all QSRI signatory advertise-
ments, the dominant advertisers were McDonald’s (47%),
KFC (26%) and Hungry Jack’s (16%). There were 38 adver-
tisements for children’s meals (19%), of which 34 (17%)
were McDonald’s Happy Meals®. All advertisements for
McDonald’s Happy Meals® showed three chicken nuggets,
apple slices and water which is considered a healthier meal
according to the QSRI.
Discussion
Main finding of this study
Advertising rates for both non-core groceries and fast-food
were unchanged in 2015 compared to 2011,17 contradicting
the RCMI and QSRI objective to ‘reduce advertising and
marketing communications to children for food and bever-
age products that do not represent healthier choices’.6,7
RCMI signatories advertised non-core foods at a similar rate
to non-signatories and QSRI signatories advertised at a
much higher rate than non-signatories, The proportion of
non-core advertising contributed by signatory companies
slightly decreased from 2011 with 55% and 83% of non-
core advertisements from RCMI and QSRI signatories
respectively in 2015 compared to 62% and 90% in 2011.17
The number of signatories to the RCMI has changed minim-
ally and there have been no changes to the signatories of the
QSRI since they were implemented in 2009, despite recom-
mendations to the AFGC in 2012 to undertake a recruit-
ment strategy.9
What is already known on this topic
The 2014 AFGC Annual Audit showed high adherence to
voluntary codes.8 The difference between that result and our
study is consistent with international studies.23 By defining
children’s viewing periods as either within C- and P-
programs or when children are at least 35% of the audience,
the voluntary self-regulatory initiatives fail to reflect chil-
dren’s actual viewing patterns. As well, the initiatives do not
capture high numbers of children watching popular shows
where the 35% threshold is not reached because the ratio of
children to total audience is diminished by the high total
audience. If the objective of the RCMI and QSRI is to
reduce children’s exposure to advertisements that are not
healthier choices then the definition of children’s viewing
periods needs to incorporate times when high numbers of
children are viewing, irrespective of the ratio to total audi-
ence numbers. Highest audiences are in the early evening
during movies targeting children and families and during
reality shows and light-entertainment programs.16 With
growing evidence of the effect of advertising on children’s
diets,24 initiatives must reduce advertising of unhealthy
foods at times when children are watching to protect them
from the power of food marketing.

 What this study adds
In 2013, GO! broadcast over half of the most popular C-
and P-programs.16 Although we found advertising rates low-
er on GO!, the high rate of fast-food advertisements and
the move by the commercial broadcasters of C- and P-
programs from the primary channels to digital multi-
channels16 warrants continued monitoring.
As found previously, advertisements for fast-food and
chocolate and confectionery were the most common.17,25
This is concerning given an Australian qualitative study
found that children named food advertisements for confec-
tionery and fast foods as most appealing26 and that 38% of
4–13 year olds’ total daily energy comes from energy-dense
nutrient-poor foods and drinks.27
Improved regulation regarding food marketing to children
must include criteria for ‘healthiness’ of foods suitable to
advertise consistent with Australian Dietary Guidelines. In
2015, all fast-foods advertised by QSRI signatories con-
tained at least some non-core food or drink products.
However, the QSRI specifically sets criteria for only chil-
dren’s meals.7 The foods depicted in the McDonald’s Happy
Meal® were the ‘healthier’ options according to the QSRI
criteria, however, the chicken nuggets would likely be con-
sidered a discretionary choice in government guidelines.22
As well, in-store options include healthier and unhealthy
Happy Meals®28 and the brand effect is likely to extend
beyond the meal advertised.29–32 Under the RCMI, each
company defines their own criteria to determine the ‘healthi-
ness’ of foods that can be marketed to children.14 This
allows companies to set lenient criteria that don’t align with
Australian Dietary Guidelines.14
Advertising for meat, fruit and vegetables were the pri-
mary contributors to an increase in the core food advertising
rate since 2011. This increase is encouraging and most likely
due to the popularity of cooking shows on television.33
Fresh food advertisements were fact-based and generally not
child-directed although due to their placement in light enter-
tainment shows they would have been seen by a large child
audience.16
In its 2009 report on primary prevention, the National
Preventative Health Taskforce highlighted the same limita-
tions of the self-regulatory approach as we have discussed
and recommended changes included phasing out marketing
of unhealthy food and beverages on free-to-air and pay tele-
vision before 9 pm within four years and adopting criteria
for determining ‘healthy’ food and drink.34 Little progress
has been made in 6 years despite mandatory regulation of
food marketing to children being widely supported by
parents.35,36
Limitations of this study
A limitation of this study was the potential variability in cod-
ing between 2011 and 2015, although this was mitigated by
regular meetings with one of the 2011 researchers. Another
limitation was the underestimation of advertisements due to
the recording error although this was limited to only one
advertisement period. The results are for four Sydney com-
mercial television channels and may not be generalizable to
other locations. Future studies targeting multi-channels and
adding audience data would broaden insight into children’s
advertising exposure on television. As a consistent coding
framework was used, this study could contribute to future
studies for analysing advertising trends over time.
Conclusions
Since 2011, there has been no change in unhealthy food adver-
tising suggesting that the current self-regulatory initiatives are
inadequately protecting Australian children. Improvements to
regulation including definitions of advertising to children tak-
ing into account children’s viewing times and Government-
endorsed standards for what constitutes a healthy food, are
required to protect children and provide an advertising envir-
onment supportive of healthy eating.
