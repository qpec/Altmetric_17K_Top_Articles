Background: Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), latent HIV-1 continues to persist in a long-lived
population of resting memory CD4+ T cells within those who are infected. Finding a safe and effective means to
induce latency reversal (LR) during ART to specifically expose this latent HIV-1 cellular reservoir for immune
elimination has been a major barrier to a functional cure.
Methods: In this study, we test the use of antigen-presenting type 1-polarized, monocyte-derived dendritic cells
(MDC1) generated from chronic HIV-1-infected individuals on ART as a means to induce HIV-1 latency reversal in
autologous CD4+ T cells harboring replication-competent provirus. We use the same MDC1 for ex-vivo genera-
tion of autologous HIV-1 antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and test their effector responses against
the MDC1-exposed HIV-1- infected CD4+ T cell targets.
Findings: MDC1 presentation of either HIV-1 or cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens to CD4+ T cells facilitated HIV-1
LR. This antigen-driven MDC1-mediated LR was sharply diminished with blockade of the CD40L/CD40 ‘helper’
signaling pathway. Importantly, these antigen-presenting MDC1 also activated the expansion of CTL capable of
killing the exposed HIV-1-infected targets.
Interpretation: Inclusion of virus-associated MHC class II ‘helper’ antigens in MDC1-based HIV-1 immunother-
apies could serve both as a targeted means to safely unmask antigen-specific CD4+ T cells harboring HIV-1,
and to support CTL responses that can effectively target the MDC1-exposed HIV-1 cellular reservoir as a func-
tional cure strategy.

1. Introduction
Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 is man-
aged as a chronic disease due to its persistence in a long-lived popula-
tion of resting memory CD4+ T cells [1]. This latent reservoir of
inducible, replication-competent HIV-1 in ART-suppressed individuals
is considered a critical barrier to a cure [2], since the lack of viral protein
expression in latently infected cells allows the reservoir to escape im-
mune surveillance. The ‘kick and kill’ (or ‘shock and kill’) approach to
controlling HIV-1 involves inducing HIV-1 latency reversal (LR) during
ART to expose infected cells, while creating an arsenal of immune effec-
tor cells, such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), capable of eliminating
these targets [3]. Successful CTL targeting of the latent HIV-1 reservoir
will require recognition of HIV-1-associated peptide epitopes presented
on infected cells after LR. Besides latency itself, major hurdles for effec-
tive CTL elimination of HIV-1 infected cells include issues related to
CD8+ T cell exhaustion [4], alterations in CTL epitopes, antigen process-
ing, and antigen presentation associated with immune escape [5,6]; the
establishment of epitope variants that act as partial agonists to induce
dysfunctional noncytolytic cross-reactive memory CTL responses [7,8],
and presentation of target antigen decoys by cells harboring defective
virus [9]. Together, these points highlight the need to generate highly
functional CTL either through induction of de novo CD8+ T cell re-
sponses, or subdominant memory responses targeting relevant con-
served epitopes of the reservoir-associated virus.

 Finding an effective means to expose and purge the latent reservoir
in a nontoxic manner has been elusive and remains a major hurdle to
this cure approach. While pharmacological latency reversal agents
(LRAs) have achieved limited success in ex vivo studies, none have
been shown to reduce the latent reservoir in HIV-1-infected individuals
[10]. Although the protein kinase C (PKC) agonist bryostatin-1 was
shown to achieve T cell activation comparable to that induced by PHA/
Il-2 stimulation in vitro and ex vivo [10,11], its use in cancer clinical trials
resulted in serious adverse events [12–15]. Furthermore, in a phase I
HIV-1 clinical trial, tolerable but conservative drug dosing of
bryostatin-1 prevented it from reaching detectable systemic concentra-
tions associated with PKC activation and from reactivating latent HIV-1
reservoirs [16].
Some LRAs, specifically histone deacetylase inhibitors and PKC mod-
ulators, can negatively impacting antigen-specific CD8+ T cell effector
responses in vitro [11,17,18]. However, it is unclear if this negative effect
on HIV-1-specific immunity occurs with their use in vivo. More promis-
ing data, have emerged from studies utilizing TLR agonists as LRAs, in-
cluding those targeting TLR7 [19–22]. This strategy to target such
germline-encoded innate immune activation receptors effectively con-
tributes to impacting the latent reservoir and delaying viral rebound
In nonhuman primate models, particularly when combined either
with therapeutic vaccination using Ad26/MVA (recombinant adenovi-
rus serotype 26 prime/modified vaccinia Ankara boost) expressing
gag, pol and env [20], or with HIV-broadly neutralizing antibody
(bNAb) therapy [21]. While promising, the potential for toxicity associ-
ated with TLR-induced broad activation of innate immune cells exists.
These findings support the need to continue exploring eradication strat-
egies to reverse HIV latency without inducing nonspecific global im-
mune activation [23], while enhancing HIV antigen-specific adaptive
immunity.
Although conventional dendritic cells (DC) have been safely used in
HIV-1 clinical trials for their capacity to induce antigen-specific T cell re-
sponses [24–27], their HIV-1 LRA potential has been underexplored. In-
terestingly, a study from our group suggested a link between
administration of a DC-based HIV-1 therapeutic and increased residual
viremia in ART-suppressed individuals prior to analytic treatment inter-
ruption [28]. However, that study was not designed to specifically ad-
dress the use of the DC therapeutic as an LRA. Thus a number of
important questions remain, including the roles that DC polarization
status and antigen presentation could have in the noted phenomenon,
and the underlying mechanisms involved.
We hypothesize that under optimal conditions, a DC-based thera-
peutic strategy can be designed to safely facilitate both the ‘kick’ and
‘kill’ of the latent HIV-1 reservoir. Here, we show that clinically applica-
ble, type 1-polarized, monocyte-derived DC (MDC1) are uniquely capa-
ble of both activating HIV-1 transcription in latently infected CD4+ T
cells harboring replication-competent virus and inducing broad HIV-1-
specific CTL responses that can effectively target the exposed infected
cells. To promote strong HIV-1-specific CTL responses, these antigen-
presenting MDC1 are deliberately programmed to subsequently release
high amounts of the critical CTL-inducing cytokine IL-12p70 upon inter-
action with the CD4+ T helper (TH) cell factor CD40L [29]. We found that
the strategic inclusion of heterologous cytomegalovirus (CMV)- associ-
ated antigen designed to encourage such CD4+ T cell ‘helper’ activity
through MHC class II presentation also facilitated MDC1-mediated LR.
The demonstrated antigen-dependent LRA activity of CMV and HIV-1
antigen-presenting MDC1 suggests that CD4+ T cells having antigen
specificity to these viruses contribute to the latent reservoir, thus
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Finding a nontoxic, effective means to purge the latent HIV-1 res-
ervoir remains a major obstacle to a functional cure. The ‘kick and
kill’ approach to controlling HIV-1 involves inducing HIV-1 latency
reversal (LR) during antiretroviral therapy (ART) to expose infected
cells, while creating an arsenal of immune effector cells, such as
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), capable of eliminating these tar-
gets. While pharmacological latency reversal agents (LRAs) have
achieved limited success in ex vivo studies, they have yet to be
found effective at reducing the latent reservoir in HIV-1-infected
individuals. In addition, some LRAs have been shown to nega-
tively impact antigen-specific CD8+ T cell effector responses
in vitro. Besides latency itself, major hurdles for effective CTL
elimination of HIV-1 infected cells include issues related to
CD8+ T cell exhaustion, alterations in CTL epitopes, antigen pro-
cessing, and antigen presentation associated with immune es-
cape; the establishment of epitope variants that act as partial
agonists to induce dysfunctional noncytolytic cross-reactive
memory CTL responses, and presentation of target antigen de-
coys by cells harboring defective virus. Thus, an optimal cure
strategy must address not only induction of proviral gene expres-
sion but also clearance of reactivated cells presenting HIV-1-
associated peptide epitopes by either highly functional CTL, or
through incorporation of other immune-based strategies, including
vaccines and adjuvants, broadly neutralizing antibodies, or com-
pounds modulating pro-apoptotic pathways.
Added value of this study
Conventional dendritic cells (DC) have been safely and widely
used in both cancer and HIV-1 clinical trials for their capacity to in-
duce antigen-specific T cell responses, but their HIV-1 LRA poten-
tial has been underexplored. Though not designed to specifically
address their function as a therapeutic LRA, a recent study sug-
gested a link between administration of a DC-based HIV-1 vaccine
and increased residual viremia in ART-suppressed individuals prior
to analytic treatment interruption. Here we report that antigen-
presenting pro-inflammatory type 1-polarized monocyte-derived
dendritic cells (MDC1) generated from chronic HIV-1-infected indi-
viduals on ART can induce HIV-1 LR in autologous CD4+ T cells.
Importantly, this effect of driving the virus out of latency was facil-
itated through the strategic use both CMV- and HIV-associated
antigen to specifically promote MHC-class II antigen restricted in-
teractions between CD4+ T cells responsive to these pathogens
and MDC1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this sin-
gle MDC1-based therapeutic tool to promote both the antigen-
specific exposure (the ‘kick’) and CTL killing (the ‘kill’) of CD4+ T
cells harboring replication-competent provirus.
Implications of all the available evidence
To date, clinical trials of pharmacological LRAs have demon-
strated minimal or no reduction in the latent reservoir in vivo. De-
liberately programmed to release high amounts of the critical
CTL-inducing cytokine IL-12p70 upon interaction with the CD4+
T helper cell factor CD40L, clinically applicable MDC1 are uniquely
capable of both activating HIV-1 transcription in latently infected
CD4+ T cells and inducing broad HIV-1-specific CTL responses.
Strategic inclusion of virus-associated MHC class II ‘helper’ anti-
gens in MDC1-based HIV-1 immunotherapies could serve both
as a targeted means to safely unmask virus antigen-specific CD4+
T cells harboring HIV-1, and to support CTL responses that can ef-
fectively target the MDC1-exposed HIV-1 reservoir as a functional
cure strategy.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study participants
HIV-1-infected ART-treated participants of the Pittsburgh clinical
site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) were selected for
this research. These participants were documented as having begun
ART with a median virally controlled treatment duration of 12.3 years
(range 1.7–20.8 years; Table S1). Whole blood products from HIV-1-
negative blood donors were purchased from the Central Blood Bank of
Pittsburgh. Written informed consent was obtained from participants
prior to inclusion in the study. The University of Pittsburgh Institutional
Review Board approved this study.
2.2. Isolation of monocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from buffy
coat or whole blood were isolated by standard density gradient separa-
tion using Lymphocyte Separation Medium (Corning Cat# 25–072-CV).
PBMC were further separated into monocytes and peripheral blood
lymphocytes (PBL) using a positive selection human CD14 microbeads
kit (Miltenyi Biotec Cat# 130–05-201; RRID: AB_2665482) according
to manufacturer's specifications, and the differentially isolated cells
were cryopreserved until use.
2.3. Generation of monocyte-derived DC
Immature DC were generated from monocytes isolated and cultured
for 7 days in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Media (IMDM; Gibco Cat#
12440-053) containing 10% fetal bovine serum Atlanta biologicals
Cat# S12450H) and 0.5% gentamicin (Gibco Cat# 15710-064) in the
presence of granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-
CSF; 1000 IU/mL; Sanofi-aventis Cat# NAC2004–5843-01) and
interleukin-4 (IL-4; 1000 IU/mL; R&D Systems Cat# 204-1 L). As previ-
ously described [29], mature, high IL-12p70-producing MDC1 and
IL-12p70 deficient, prostaglandin E2-treated DC (PGE2-DC) were gener-
ated as previously described [29] by exposure of immature DC cultures
at day 5 for 48 h to a cocktail of maturation factors containing
either interferon (IFN)-α (1000 U/mL; Schering Corporation Cat#
NDC:0085–1110-01), IFN-γ (1000 U/mL; R&D Systems Cat# 285-1F),
IL-1β (10 ng/mL; R&D Systems #201-LB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-
α (25 ng/mL; R&D Systems Cat# 210-TA), and polyinosinic:
polycytidylic acid (20 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# P9582-5MG), or IL-
1β (10 ng/mL), TNF-α (25 ng/mL), IL-6 (1000 U/mL; R&D Systems
Cat# 206–1 L), and PGE2 (2 μM; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# P6532-1MG),
respectively.
2.4. Flow cytometry
Phenotypic characterization of DC was determined by flow cytome-
try using cells stained with the following antibodies: CD14-PE (clone
TÜK4; Miltenyi Biotec Cat# 130-098-067; RRID: AB_2660171), CD83-
PE (clone HB15A; Beckman Coulter Cat# IM2218U), CD86-PE (clone
HA5.2B7; Beckman Coulter Cat# IM2729U), CCR7-FITC (clone 150503;
R&D Systems Cat# FAB197F; RRID: AB_2259847), OX40L-PE (clone ik-
1; BD Biosciences Cat# 558164; RRID: AB_647195), Siglec-1/CD169-
Alexa Fluor® 488 (clone 7-239; Bio-Rad Cat# MCA2517A488T; RRID:
2286027), CD209-APC (clone DCN46; BD Biosciences Cat# 551545;
RRID: AB_647161), and HLA-DR-APC-Cy7 (clone L243; Biolegend Cat#
307618). For surface staining, cells were preincubated with 1× PBS la-
beling buffer containing 2% BSA, 0.1% NaN3, and unfractionated murine
IgG (1.0 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# 15381-1MG) to block Fc-receptor
binding. CD4+ T cells cocultured with MDC1 were tested weekly for
the presence of HIV-1 p24 by surface staining for CD3 (APC-H7, clone
SK7; BD Biosciences Cat# 641397; RRID: AB_1645731) and CD4 (Pacific
Blue, clone RPA-T4; BD Biosciences Cat# 558116; RRID: AB_397037),
and intracellular staining with KC57-FITC antibody (clone FH190–1-1,
Beckman Coulter Cat# 6604665). Antigen-specific CTL responses were
assessed by exposing CTL to HIV-1 Gag 9-mer peptides (1 μg/mL) or
media alone, and incubating with CD107a-FITC (clone H4A3; BD Biosci-
ences Cat# 555800; RRID: AB_396134) stain mix containing 0.1%
monensin (BD Golgi Stop™, BD Biosciences Cat# 554724) for six
hours at 37 °C. Cells were then stained for viability (LIVE/DEAD™
Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain, Life Technologies Cat# L34957), surface
expression of CD3 (APC-H7, clone SK7; BD Biosciences) and CD8
(PerCP-Cy5.5, clone SK1; BD Biosciences Cat# 341051; RRID: AB_
400298), and intracellular expression of IFN-γ (IFN-γ-AlexaFluor®
700, clone B27; BD Biosciences Cat# 557995; RRID: AB_396977).
2.5. Functional characterization of differentially matured DC
DC production of IL-12p70 in response to CD40L-transfected J558
cells (J558-CD40L; a gift from Dr. P. Lane, Birmingham, UK) stimulation
was determined as previously described [7]. Briefly, DC were plated (2.5
× 104 cells/well) in a 96-well flat-bottom plate and stimulated with
J558-CD40L (5 × 104 cells/well) for 24 h. Culture supernatants were col-
lected and tested by IL-12p70 ELISA using the following reagents: Re-
combinant Human IL-12 Standard (R&D Systems Cat# 219-IL-005),
Primary Human IL-12 mAb (Thermo Scientific Cat#M122), Secondary
Human IL-12 mAb, Biotin-labeled (Thermo Scientific Cat# M121B),
HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (Thermo Scientific Cat# N100), TMB Sub-
strate Solution (Thermo Scientific Cat# N301), Stop Solution (Thermo
Scientific Cat# N600).
2.6. Induction of HIV-1 LR in CD4+ T cells
MDC1 were tested for their ability to induce HIV-1 LR by coculture
with autologous CD4+ T cells in the absence or presence of SEB
(Sigma-Aldrich Cat #S4481), CMV pp65 (CMVpp65 Recombinant Pro-
tein, Miltenyi Biotec Cat# 130-091-824, or PepTivator® CMV pp65,
Miltenyi Biotec Cat# 130-093-435), HIV-1 Gag (HIV-1 IIIB PR55 Gag
Recombinant Protein, NIH AIDS Reagent Program Cat# 3276; HIV-1
Gag Recombinant Protein, Sigma-Aldrich Cat# H 0160; or HIV-1 Con-
sensus 15-mer Peptides (Sigma-Aldrich), or influenza M1 antigen (In-
fluenza M1 Protein (A/California/04/2009) (H1N1), eEnzyme Cat# IA-
M1-023P, or PepTivator® Influenza A (H1N1) MP1, Miltenyi Biotec
Cat# 130-097-285). Briefly, total CD4+ T cells were isolated from
cryopreserved PBL derived from HIV-1-infected MACS participants
by negative magnetic bead separation using an EasySep™ Human
CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies Cat# 19052).
CD4+ T cells were cocultured with DC in complete IMDM at a ratio
of either 1:7 (100,000 DC: 750,000 CD4+ T cells) or 1:10 (100,000:1
× 106) for seven days in 48-well plates. Total CD4+ T cells from
HIV-1-infected MACS participants were treated with Dynabeads®
Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 (Life Technologies Cat# 11131D) and
implemented as a positive control in LR experiments. The cytokines
rhIL-2 (Proleukin®, 100 U/mL; Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. Cat#
NDC65483-116-07) and rhIL-7 (1 μg/mL; Miltenyi Biotec Cat# 130-
095-361) were added to the cultures on day 4, and culture superna-
tants were harvested on day 7 for quantitation of HIV-1 RNA. Where
stated, cocultures were maintained and the T cells tested for intracel-
lular expression of p24 on days 14-20 by flow cytometry. CD40L
blocking antibody (clone MK13A4, 10 μg/mL; Enzo Life Sciences Cat#
ALX-805-037-C100; RRID: AB_2076315) or Leaf™ Purified Mouse
IgG1,k isotype antibody (clone MG1-45, 10 μg/mL; Biolegend Cat#
401404) was used where shown.

 2.7. Relative quantification of HIV-1 gag RNA
Culture supernatants were ultra-centrifuged (Sorvall Stratos
Biofuge) at 45,000 x g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain viral pellets from which
total RNA was isolated by the RNA-Bee™ method (TEL-TEST, Inc. Cat#
CS-105B). Five microliters of RNA were used for detection of reverse
transcription using TaqMan® Reverse Transcription Reagents (Life
Technologies Cat# N8080234) according to the manufacture's protocol.
A 20 μL TaqMan® PCR was performed by mixing 5 μL cDNA with
TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Cat# 4364340),
500 nM each of forward (5′-CCCATGTTTTCAGCATTATCAGAA-3′, Inte-
grated DNA Technologies) and reverse primers (5′-CCACTGTGTTTAGC
ATGGTGTTTAA-3′, Integrated DNA Technologies), and 250 nM FAM/
MGB-labeled probe (5′-FAM-AGCCACCCCACAAGA-MGB-3′; Thermo
Fisher Cat# 4316033, TMgagP2). Real-time PCR was performed using
the ViiA 7 A&B Applied Biosystems instrument (Life Technologies) and
the following cycling conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min,
40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. Real-time PCR primers
and probes were based on the HIV-1 pNL4.3 sequence encoding the
gag region. Serially diluted pNL4.3 plasmid DNA ranging from 101 to
106 copies applied to each PCR assay served as the HIV-1 standard
curve. A no template control was included in each assay to control for
PCR cross-contamination, and each sample was assayed in triplicate.
QuantStudio™ Real-time PCR Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) was used for PCR data analysis.
2.8. Generation and characterization of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cell targets
Total CD4+ T cells cocultured with antigen-presenting MDC1 and
were tested weekly for the presence of HIV-1 p24 antigen by intracellu-
lar flow cytometry staining with KC57-FITC antibody (clone FH190–1-1,
Beckman Coulter Cat# 6604665). Target cells were pre-screened for p24
expression, and cryopreserved for later use as targets when they
reached at least 10% positivity.
2.9. Induction and expansion of autologous CTL
Total CD8+ T cells were isolated from cryopreserved PBL by negative
magnetic bead separation using an EasySep™ Human CD8+ T Cell En-
richment Kit (STEMCELL Technologies Cat# 19053). To induce CTL re-
sponses as previously described [7], CD8+ T cells were cocultured
with autologous differentially matured DC loaded with either HLA-A2-
restricted Gag p24 Gag151–159 9-mer peptide epitopes when using
HIV-1-negative blood donors, or Gag p17/p24 overlapping 15-mer pep-
tides (1 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) when using HIV-1-infected MACS partic-
ipants. The cocultures (75,000 DC: 750,000 CD8+ T cells) were treated
with or without the addition of either 25,000 gamma-irradiated
(5000 rad) CD40L-transfected J588 cells [30] or MEGACD40L® Protein
(0.25 μg/mL; Enzo Life Sciences Cat# ALX-522-110-C010) where stated.
On day 5, rhIL-2 (250 U/mL) and rhIL-7 (10 ng/mL) were added to the
cultures and every three days thereafter. On day 12, T cell cultures
were restimulated with either gamma-irradiated HLA-A2+ T2 cells
(for induction of primary CTL responses in HLA-A2+ HIV-1-negative do-
nors) or differentially matured autologous DC loaded with autologous
9-mer peptides (1 μg/mL) corresponding to the viral antigens and DC
type used in the initial stimulation. Antigen-specific readout assays
were performed between days 20–24 to assess CTL activity.
2.10. IFN-γ ELISPOT assays
Autologous CTL (3 × 104/well) were tested for reactivity to individ-
ual and pooled Gag 9-mer peptide antigens (1–10 μg/mL) by ELISPOT
assay using anti-human IFN-γ and biotin monoclonal antibodies (clones
1-D1K and 7-B6–1; Mabtech Cat# 3420–6-1000) as previously de-
scribed [7,8]. Recorded values were net responses compared to control
wells consisting of CTL exposed to assay medium alone.
2.11. HIV-1 antigen-expressing cell killing assays
CTL effector function was assessed as described previously, with
modifications [8]. Briefly, MDC1-stimulated total CD8+ T cells were
cocultured with autologous MDC1-induced CD4+ target cells at various
effector:target (E:T) ratios for 18 h at 37 °C. Harvested cocultures were
stained for surface expression of CD8 (PerCP-Cy5.5, clone SK1; BD Bio-
sciences Cat# 341051; RRID: AB_400298) and intracellular expression
of HIV-1 p24 (KC57-FITC, clone FH190-1-1; Beckman Coulter Cat#
6604665). Effector CD8+ cells were excluded from analysis gating, and
the percent reduction in infected CD4+ T cells was determined at each
E:T ratio. For the colorimetric cytolytic assays described in the supple-
mental material, autologous CD4 cells were stained with either CFSE
(eBioscience Cat# 65–0850) or CellTrace™ Violet (Thermo Fisher,
Cat# C34557) dyes following the manufacturer's protocols. Target
cells (CFSE) were then loaded with individual peptides at 100 ng/mL
in PBS for 60 min at room temperature (RT); excess unbound peptide
was removed by washing. The CFSE and CellTrace Violet dye-labeled
cells were mixed in equal numbers and coincubated for 18 h with autol-
ogous CTL at various E:T ratios. The antigen-specific killing of HIV-1
peptide-loaded CD4+ T cells (green) was calculated based on relative
changes in percentages of the differentially stained target cells remain-
ing, using by flow cytometry analysis.
2.12. Viral outgrowth assays
Total CD8+ T cells were cocultured with autologous p24-expressing
CD4+ target cells at various E:T ratios as described for the CTL kill assay.
Cultures were maintained for eight days, after which culture superna-
tants were harvested and tested by p24 ELISA (Frederick National Labo-

2.13. Quantification of replication-competent HIV-1
Culture supernatants harvested from LR and viral outgrowth assays
were spinoculated onto TZM-bl cell (NIH AIDS Reagent Program Cat#
8129-422; RRID: CVCL_B478) monolayers (30,000 cells/well) for four
hours at 300 g and cocultured for 48 h. Beta-Glo® reagent (Promega
Cat# E4740) was added to PBS-washed TZM-bl cell monolayers and in-
cubated for 1 h at room temperature. Control supernatants from cul-
tured CD4+ T cells of an uninfected donor were treated in parallel.
Chemiluminescence

the
TZM-bl
cells
was
detected
by
luminometer as previously described [31]. Sample wells were consid-
ered positive for the presence of replication-competent virus if the
chemiluminescent signal exceeded the mean + 2 S.D. of a control
sample.
2.14. Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses for ELISA and ELISPOT data (Fig. 1b and c) were
calculated using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test and a linear
mixed model with 95% confidence intervals, respectively. Differences
between MDC1-mediated LR were determined by multilevel mixed-
effects tobit regression analyses (Figs. 2, 4a) and Wilcoxon matched-
pairs signed-ranks test (Figs. 3, 4c–d).

3.1. MDC1 effectively induce primary HIV-1-specific CTL responses with
CD40L ‘help’
We initially compared the use of two clinically applicable, differen-
tially activated DC preparations using blood products from HLA-A2+
HIV-1-naïve blood bank donors to test their capacity to induce primary
HIV-1-specific CTL responses. MDC1 were characterized and defined by

 their mature phenotypic status, expressing high levels of CD86 and
CD83, and their high capacity to produce IL-12p70 upon subsequent
stimulation with the CD4+ T cell ‘helper’ signal CD40L, while PGE2-DC
were IL-12p70-deficient and less responsive to CD40L signaling
(Fig. 1a and b, and Fig. S1) [29,32]. These DC types were loaded with
HLA-A2-restricted HIV-1 peptide antigen and used as in vitro stimula-
tors of autologous CD8+ T cells, in the presence of gamma-irradiated
(5000 rad) CD40L-expressing J558 cells (J558-CD40L), which served
as a CD40L+ TH cell surrogate. In doing so, we found that the MDC1
had a higher CTL priming capacity compared to PGE2-DC (Fig. 1c). Im-
portantly, the effective in vitro induction of long-term CTL responses
by MDC1 required the presence of CD40L ‘help’ during the initiation of
the priming cocultures (Fig. 1d).
3.2. Antigen presentation by autologous MDC1 drives HIV-1 LR in CD4+ T
cells
Recent evidence linked a DC therapeutic with an increase in residual
HIV-1 viremia while the study participants were on ART, suggesting that
the DC therapeutic acted in some way as an LRA [28]. However, the
mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are not yet clear, including
the role that antigen presentation may have played. Because MDC1
were shown to be strong inducers of primary CTL responses (Fig. 1),
we next tested their capacity to reactivate or ‘kick’ latent HIV-1 from la-
tency to expose the infected cells for subsequent CTL targeting.
MDC1 were generated from ART virally suppressed HIV-1-infected
MACS participants and cocultured with autologous peripheral blood
CD4+ T cells in the presence or absence of SEB antigen. SEB was used be-
cause as a superantigen, it can effectively facilitate immune cross-talk
between the antigen-presenting cells and a large percentage (~30%) of
SEB responsive T cells [29]. CD4+ T cells treated with anti-CD3/CD28
mAb-coated beads were used as a positive LRA control [33]. qRT-PCR
analysis of HIV-1 RNA presence in day 7 coculture supernatants re-
vealed that MDC1 indeed acted as a strong LRA in an SEB antigen-
dependent manner (Fig. 2, MDC1 alone vs MDC1 + SEB, P b 0.05).
3.3. Role of CD40/CD40L interaction in MDC1-mediated ‘kick’ of latent HIV-1
DC crosstalk with CD40L+ TH cells plays a critical role in the induc-
tion and survival of long-term CTL responses [34–37]. Because we pre-
viously showed that MDC1 are particularly sensitive to CD40L signaling
[29], and that this CD4+ T cell-derived ‘helper’ factor is required for ef-
fective MDC1-mediated in vitro priming of de novo CTL responses

 (Fig. 1d), we wanted to determine if CD40/CD40L cross-talk between
the MDC1 and CD4+ T cells was playing a role in the MDC1-mediated
HIV-1 LR. Indeed, we found that blocking CD40/CD40L interaction
strongly decreased the effectiveness of MDC1-mediated LR. The impact
of this CD40L signaling inhibition on MDC1-mediated LR was clearly ev-
ident when analyzing the activated CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry,
where the addition of an anti-CD40L blocking antibody resulted in a
marked inhibition of CD4 downregulation (87.7% ± 3.1%, P b 0.05;
Fig. 3a and b), a phenomenon associated with HIV-1 protein translation
[38]. As expected, this inhibition of CD4 downregulation by addition of
the CD40L blocking antibody was associated with abrogation of intra-
cellular p24 expression (90.8% ± 7.0%) (Fig. 3a, c; P b 0.05) induced in
autologous CD4+ T cells, and with the reduction in HIV-1 RNA content
in the day 7 coculture supernatants measured by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3d,
94.1% ± 6.1% inhibition). Importantly, the addition of an isotype control
antibody to the MDC1:T cell cocultures had no significant impact on the
induced changes in CD4 expression or HIV-1 expression resulting from
LR (Fig. 3a-d). Taken together, these data support the required involve-
ment of cognate antigen-driven bidirectional signaling events between
MDC1 and antigen-responsive CD4+ T cells in HIV-1 LR.
3.4. CMV and HIV-1 antigen-driven reactivation of latent HIV-1 by MDC1
We have shown that MDC1-mediated transcription of HIV-1 DNA
(Fig. 2) and subsequent translation of p24 (Fig. 3a, c) are both dependent
on the presence of SEB superantigen and on CD40/CD40L signaling. How-
ever, to simulate a clinically relevant method of HIV-1 LR, we posited that
the inclusion of common viral MHC class II antigens as part of our MDC1-
based therapeutic could promote interaction with CD40L-expressing
CD4+ TH cells, to both provide immune ‘help’ for MDC1-mediated induc-
tion of HIV-1-specific CTL responses and facilitate MDC1-mediated expo-
sure of viral antigen-specific CD4+ T cells harboring latent HIV-1.
In choosing which viral antigens to incorporate in our model of
MDC1-mediated LR, we considered previous findings that a significant
pool of latently infected CD4+ T cells are HIV-1-specific [39,40]. As
such, an HIV-1-based vaccine or LRA construct could potentially reacti-
vate this population while also facilitating the ‘kill’ through CTL priming.
We also considered the fact that approximately 95% of HIV-1-infected
individuals are coinfected with CMV [41], in whom CMV-specific
CD4+ T cell memory inflation occurs [42], with some having greater
than 25% of their T cells specific to CMV [43]. Therefore, we

 hypothesized that inclusion of heterologous CMV antigen would effec-
tively promote MDC1 interaction with CD4+ TH cells to facilitate ‘help’
for HIV-1 specific CTL induction and to induce CMV antigen-specific
MDC1-mediated LR.
We tested MDC1 alone or loaded with CMV pp65, HIV-1 Gag, or in-
fluenza A virus M1 protein (representing a common, non-persistent
virus antigen) for their ability to induce latency reversal in autologous
CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4). We found that MDC1-mediated LR was antigen-
dependent, with CMV and HIV-1 antigen having notable LR activity,
while the influenza virus antigen did not (Fig. 4a–d). MDC1/CMV- and
MDC1/HIV-1-mediated increases in extracellular virion-associated
HIV-1 RNA were significantly greater than those induced by MDC1
alone (Fig. 4A; P b 0.01 and P b 0.001, respectively). Importantly,
MDC1 presenting either CMV or HIV-1 antigen exposed latent HIV-1
cellular reservoir targets, identified by a marked downregulation in
CD4 expression (Fig. 4c) that corresponded to increases in intracellular
p24 (Fig. 4b, d).
3.5. MDC1-induced CTL effectively kill MDC1-exposed CD4+ T cell targets
harboring replication-competent HIV-1
MDC1 loaded with autologous HIV-1 Gag peptides were used to in-
duce antigen-specific CTL, as determined by flow cytometry analysis for
antigen-induced expression of CD107a and interferon (IFN)-γ (Fig. 5a)
and by IFN-γ ELISPOT (Fig. 5b). Antigen-induced downregulation of
CD8 expression, a characteristic previously shown to be associated
with enhanced cytolytic capacity [7,44], was evident along with high
expression of CD107a and IFN-γ in the CTL generated ex vivo using the
HIV-1 antigen-presenting MDC1 (Fig. 5a). Also, the CTL responses in-
duced by MDC1 were broadly reactive to a range of individual Gag 9-
mer epitopes by IFN-γ ELISPOT (Fig. 5b). The antigen-specific killing ca-
pacity of these CTL was initially tested by coculturing them overnight
with differentially labeled Gag 9-mer peptide antigen-loaded or antigen
negative (control) autologous CD4+ T cell targets, which clearly showed
the selective elimination of the antigen-loaded target cells as

 determined by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. S2a, b). More importantly,
the LR activity of CMV and HIV-1 antigen-presenting MDC1 resulted in
the effective exposure of HIV-1-infected antigen-expressing target
cells that were also recognized and efficiently controlled by the
MDC1/Ag-induced HIV-1-specific CTL in short-term cytotoxicity assays
(75.4% ± 14.3% killing), indicated by a CTL dose-dependent decrease
of p24-expressing CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5c, d; S2c, d). This pattern was con-
sistent regardless of the type of antigen used to induce MDC1-mediated
LR. Furthermore, the CTL suppressed viral outgrowth from the infected
cells in long-term cocultures by 74.4% ± 20.2%, as measured by p24
ELISA (Fig. 6a, Right).
Recent studies have posited that CTL preferentially target cells con-
taining defective HIV-1 proviruses, which in effect act as decoy targets
to prevent elimination of the true latent reservoir [9,45,46]. Therefore,
we sought to determine whether MDC1-mediated LR activity unmasked
cells harboring replication-competent virus that could be subsequently
recognized and killed by the CTL. To do so, culture supernatants col-
lected from viral outgrowth assays at various effector-to-target ratios
(Fig. 6a) were subsequently cultured on TZM-bl reporter cells [31] for
quantification of infectious HIV-1 (Fig. 6b). Importantly, we found that
MDC1 LR activity exposed those targets harboring replication-
competent virus, whose dose-dependent elimination (Fig. 6b, Left) re-
sulted in 84.5% ± 6.7% suppression of replication-competent HIV-1
(Fig. 6b, Right). Thus, MDC1-primed HIV-1-specific autologous CTL
were capable of eliminating HIV-1-infected cells harboring replication-
competent virus following their subsequent unveiling through the LR
activity of MHC-class II antigen-presenting MDC1.
4. Discussion
We have shown that antigen-presenting MDC1 are capable of induc-
ing both HIV-1 latency reversal in infected CD4+ T cells isolated from
ART-treated HIV-1+ MACS participants, and HIV-1 antigen-specific
CTL responses that can effectively kill the MDC1-exposed HIV-1-
infected targets. This MDC1-mediated ‘kick’ was found to be antigen-
dependent, and bidirectional signaling events between the MDC1 and
CD4+ T cells involving the CD40/CD40L signaling pathway contributed
to this process. Other studies have explored the LRA potential of imma-
ture DC using in vitro models of HIV-1 latency with infected immortal-
ized cell lines [47,48], through in vitro establishment of HIV-1 latency
in primary CD4+ T cells of uninfected donors [49], or by addressing
their nonspecific impact on in vitro pre-expanded polyclonal-activated
T cells [50]. However, we demonstrate, in a natural setting of chronic
HIV-1 infection, the use of an effective, clinically relevant autologous
mature DC type specifically programmed to both mediate LR in freshly
isolated CD4+ T cells derived from individuals undergoing successful
ART, and to induce effector cells capable of recognizing and eliminating
the infected cells. Our current data imply that a component of the HIV-1
reservoir is contained within the pool of both CMV- and HIV-1-specific
CD4+ T cells. Importantly, our study was limited to a small number of
viral antigen sources, and to one target protein antigen for each of the
respective viruses tested. Therefore, the levels of LR induced most likely
underrepresent the magnitude of HIV-1 reactivation possible if the
number and selection of antigens had been optimized. This is especially
true when considering antigen-specific CMV immunity, where CD4+ T
cell responses to pp65 and IE-1 protein antigens comprise less than
12% of total CD4+ T cell responses to CMV in coinfected individuals
[43]. As CMV is one of the largest and most complex viruses, with a ge-
nome encoding over 200 open reading frames [51], our study has room
for optimization through incorporation of other CMV antigens that
could enhance the effectiveness of our MDC1-based LR strategy. Never-
theless, our study supports the concept that HIV-1 LR can be achieved to
expose cells infected with replication-competent virus for CTL elimina-
tion, in both a safe and directed antigen-specific fashion.
Previous studies in HIV-1/CMV-coinfected individuals indicate that
HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cells are preferentially infected and depleted by
HIV-1 [40,52], and that a portion of latently infected cells that remain
during ART are indeed HIV-1-specific [39]. Interstingly, in contrast to
our findings, it has been reported that CMV-specific CD4+ T cells are
less susceptible to HIV-1 infection in vivo [53]. In spite of this, a large
body of data exists to support the notion that CMV antigen-specific
CD4+ T cells, in particular, likely contribute to a sizeable portion of the
latent HIV-1 cellular reservoir. For example, CMV infection is frequent
in HIV-1-infected individuals, with a seroprevalence of approximately
95% [41]. Furthermore, CMV occupies an inflated proportion, on average
10%, of memory T cell responses in healthy individuals, and CMV-
specific CD4+ T cells persist at high levels in HIV-1 and CMV coinfected
individuals [42,51,54,55], with greater than 1 out of 4 of the total num-
ber of CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood being CMV-specific in some indi-
viduals [43]. Subclinical CMV replication often occurs in the mucosal
and peripheral tissues of HIV-1-infected individuals, contributing to T
cell dysfunction, impaired immune recovery, and chronic immune acti-
vation during ART [56–59]. Consequently, recruitment of target cells to
sites of inflammation that are also major sites of HIV-1 persistence, such
as gut and other lymphoid tissues, creates a favorable environment for
reservoir seeding [60–63]. Recent evidence supporting this scenario
was provided by a study of ART-suppressed individuals in whom CMV
replication in the gut was associated with inflammation, mucosal bar-
rier damage, and microbial translocation [60]. Manipulation of HIV-1
coreceptor expression by CMV could also serve as a mechanism for es-
tablishment of the latent reservoir in susceptible target cells. For exam-
ple, CMV upregulates CCR5 expression on newborn umbilical cord
blood central memory CD4+ T cells that could facilitate in utero trans-
mission of HIV-1 [64]. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrate the abil-
ity of CMV to manipulate AP-1 and NF-κB signaling for induction of HIV-
1 gene expression in infected bystander cells through direct
transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR [65–68]. Each of these mechanisms
could potentially lead to enhanced HIV-1 infection of target cells in
CMV-coinfected individuals. Once established, the latent HIV-1 cellular
reservoir could also be subject to CMV-mediated proliferation or clonal
expansion. In support of this theory, cross-sectional studies have shown
a correlation between CMV replication in blood and semen and higher
levels of HIV-1 DNA in both ART-naïve and ART-suppressed individuals
[69,70]. In a related longitudinal study, CMV replication in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of men initiating early ART was asso-
ciated with delayed decay of HIV-1 DNA reservoirs [63]. Furthermore,
proviral and integration site analyses in ART-suppressed individuals
have implicated clonal expansion of latently infected CD4+ T cells as a
major mechanism of HIV-1 persistence [71–75], and recent findings es-
timate that these expanded clones comprise 50–60% of the latent HIV-1
reservoir [76–78]. Of note, in a study of 15 HIV-1-infected patients who
underwent myeloablative chemotherapy for CMV- and Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV)-associated malignancies, increases in HIV-1 DNA were pref-
erentially found in CMV- and EBV-specific CD4+ T cells after immune
reconstitution [79]. It is possible that self-renewal of stem cell memory
T cells (TSCM) contributes to homeostatic proliferation of the latent HIV
reservoir [80]. This subset of memory T cells plays a significant role in
the maintenance of long-term immunological memory and contains
the most copies of integrated provirus per cell in HIV-1-infected individ-
uals [80]. Finally, CMV-infected individuals possess functional CMV-
specific TSCM cells that could promote expansion of the HIV-1 reservoir
in CMV/HIV-1-coinfected persons through homeostatic proliferation,
even during ART [81].
Recent studies in vivo studies utilizing TLR agonists to promote
HIV-1 LR have shown promise [19–22], and are currently being
studied in human trials (NIH Clinical Trials NCT02858401 (GS-9620;
NCT03060447; NCT03837756). However, the specifics of how these in-
nate immune receptor activators are leading to reactivation of the latent
reservoir have yet to be fully elucidated. Evidence from both human and
non-human primate studies points toward the IFN-α-producing
plasmacytoid DC (pDC) as being an important cellular component in
this process [19–22]. It is worth noting that the combination of factors

 used in the maturation and generation process of the specialized
antigen-presenting type-1 programmed MDC1 used in our study,
which includes IFN-α, IFN-γ, and a TLR3 agonist, was designed to
mimic maturation events expected to occur as a result of DC
crosstalk with responding IFN-α-producing pDC and IFN-γ-
producing NK cells during the early stages of a successful antiviral
immune response [32,82]. The factors produced by these early
immune responders programs the maturing DC for being hyper-
responsive to subsequent signaling factors they receive during
antigen cognate interactions with CD4+ TH cells. While the under-
lying mechanisms of the MDC1-mediated LR observed in our study
have not been fully identified, our findings do indicate that bidirec-
tional antigen-driven cross-talk between MDC1 and CD4+ T cells
involving the CD40/CD40L signaling pathway contributed to the
noted LR activity. Based on gene chip analysis of CD40L-activated
MDC1 that revealed upregulations in galectin-9, TNF-α, and IL-15
mRNA expression (data not shown), all of which have been impli-
cated as inducers of LR [50,83,84], the potential contribution of
these factors warrants further investigation.
There are a number of caveats and limitations to our study that we
acknowledge. Although our results point to CMV- and HIV-1-specific
CD4+ T cells as harboring latent provirus, it is likely that CD4+ T cells
specific to other viruses that manifest as chronic infections, including
EBV and herpes simplex virus, and others contribute to the latent reser-
voir as well. Moreover, while we did not observe influenza antigen-
mediated LR ex vivo, others have documented increases in cell-
associated HIV-1 RNA expression in HIV-1-infected individuals receiv-
ing influenza vaccination during suppressive ART [85,86]. However,
deep sequencing studies pre- and post-vaccination suggested nonselec-
tive induction of proviral expression from a broad pool of HIV-1-
infected bystander cells [86]. While the LR we show in our study was
antigen-driven, we did not truly identify the antigen specificity of the
infected CD4+ T cells, and therefore we do not rule out the possibility
that reactivation of the virus could reflect nonspecific bystander effects
of a potent MDC1-mediated antigen-specific response, rather than a di-
rect impact on an antigen-specific reservoir. Furthermore, targeting the
latent reservoir poses numerous challenges with regard to antigen de-
livery by a DC vaccine to certain sites that are anatomical sanctuaries
of HIV-1, such as lymph node B cell follicles [87]. Because of this, the
LRA potential of antigen-presenting B cells and antigen-presenting
DC-derived exosomes should be explored for their ability to drive
HIV-1 LR and to target these anatomical sites. Alternatively, developing
strategies for direct antigen delivery to the antigen presenting cells re-
siding in these areas in vivo should be considered. Nonetheless, our re-
sults provide strong rationale for the incorporation of MDC1 and
‘helper’ antigen derived from heterologous viral sources (such as
CMV) into the design of a dual therapeutic approach to address both
the ‘kick’ and the ‘kill’ of latent HIV-1.
