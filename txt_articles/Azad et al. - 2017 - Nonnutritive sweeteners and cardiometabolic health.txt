besity is a major public health challenge that contrib-
utes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.1 Evi-
dence that sugar consumption is fuelling this epi-
demic2–4 has stimulated the increasing popularity of nonnutritive 
sweeteners,5 including aspartame, sucralose and stevioside. In 
2008, more than 30% of Americans reported daily intake of non-
nutritive sweeteners, and this proportion is increasing.6 
Researchers have suggested that nonnutritive sweeteners may 
have adverse effects on glucose metabolism, gut microbiota and 
appetite control.7,8 Moreover, studies involving animals have 
reported that chronic exposure to nonnutritive sweeteners leads 
to increased food consumption, weight gain and adiposity.9
The position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is that 
nonnutritive sweeteners can help limit energy intake as a strat-
egy to manage weight or blood glucose.10 However, consumption 
of nonnutritive sweeteners has been paradoxically associated

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Nonnutritive sweeten-
ers, such as aspartame, sucralose and 
stevioside, are widely consumed, yet 
their long-term health impact is uncer-
tain. We synthesized evidence from 
prospective studies to determine 
whether routine consumption of non-
nutritive sweeteners was associated 
with long-term adverse cardiometa-
bolic effects.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, 
Embase and Cochrane Library (incep-
tion to January 2016) for randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated 
interventions for nonnutritive sweet-
eners and prospective cohort studies 
that reported on consumption of non-
nutritive sweeteners among adults and 
adolescents. The primary outcome 
was body mass index (BMI). Secondary 
outcomes included weight, obesity 
and other cardiometabolic end points.
RESULTS: From 11 774 citations, we 
included 7 trials (1003 participants; 
median follow-up 6 mo) and 30 cohort 
studies (405 907 participants; median 
follow-up 10 yr). In the included RCTs, 
nonnutritive sweeteners had no signifi-
cant effect on BMI (mean difference 
–0.37 kg/m2; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] –1.10 to 0.36; I2 9%; 242 partici-
pants). In the included cohort studies, 
consumption  of nonnutritive sweeten-
ers was associated with a modest in-
crease in BMI (mean correlation 0.05, 
95% CI 0.03 to 0.06; I2 0%; 21 256 partici-
pants). Data from RCTs showed no con-
sistent effects of nonnutritive sweet-
eners on other measures of body 
composition and reported no further 
secondary outcomes. In the cohort 
studies, consumption of nonnutritive 
sweeteners was associated with in-
creases in weight and waist circumfer-
ence, and higher incidence of obesity, 
hypertension, metabolic syndrome, 
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
events. Publication bias was indicated 
 
for studies with diabetes as an outcome.
INTERPRETATION: Evidence from RCTs 
does not clearly support the intended 
benefits of nonnutritive sweeteners for 
weight management, and observational 
data suggest that routine intake of nonnu-
tritive sweeteners may be associated with 
increased BMI and cardiometabolic risk. 
Further research is needed to fully charac-
terize the long-term risks and benefits of 
nonnutritive sweeteners. Protocol regis-
tration: PROSPERO-CRD42015019749

with weight gain and incident obesity.7,11 A previous meta-
analysis12 reported conflicting evidence: randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) showed potential benefits (modest weight loss), 
whereas observational studies showed a small but significant 
association with increased body mass index (BMI). However, the 
review did not evaluate outcomes beyond body composition.13 
Several studies involving more than 100 000 new participants 
and representing several new geographic settings have since 
been published.14–24
Our objective was to synthesize evidence addressing this 
question: Is routine consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners by 
adults and adolescents associated with adverse long-term car-
diometabolic effects in RCTs and prospective cohort studies?
Methods
This review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses25 following a 
registered protocol.26
Search strategy and selection criteria
The search strategy was developed by an information specialist 
(M.F.) to overcome the limitations13 of previous reviews. Our 
MEDLINE strategy (Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup 
/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161390/-/DC1, Table S1) was peer 
reviewed and also translated for searches in Embase and The 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included the 
following terms, among others: nonnutritive sweeteners, aspar-
tame, saccharin, sucralose, xylitol, stevia, carbonated beverages, 
calories and food frequency. We did not limit the search by using 
terms related to outcomes of interest. 
We conducted the searches from the time of database incep-
tion to January 2016 with no language restrictions; translation 
services were accessed to evaluate non-English citations. We also 
searched conference proceedings from the American Society for 
Nutrition, American Diabetes Association and Obesity Society. 
We manually searched reference lists of pertinent reviews and 
included studies for relevant citations, and we conducted grey 
literature searches of OpenSIGLE and Google Scholar. We used 
EndNote (version X6, Thompson Reuters, New York) to perform 
reference management.
We screened search results in duplicate using a team of 5 
reviewers (A.M., A.R., J.L., L.C., M.J.). We included RCTs and obser-
vational studies that evaluated consumption of nonnutritive 
sweeteners in individuals who were more than 12 years of age 
(Appendix 1, Table S2). Studies evaluating children were reviewed 
separately.27 We required a minimum study duration of 6 months 
to reflect routine consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners, to 
focus on long-term effects and to allow time for metabolic out-
comes to develop. For observational studies, we required that 
associations with baseline intake of nonnutritive sweeteners (not 
only changes in intake during the course of the study) were 
reported to confirm temporality and limit confounding by reverse 
causation. Our primary outcome was change in BMI. 
Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight; adipos-
ity; glucose metabolism; and incidence of overweight/obesity, 
metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other car-
diorenal outcomes. If a study reported outcomes at multiple time 
points, we included the longest available follow-up.
Data extraction
We developed, piloted and deployed a standardized form for 
data extraction in DistillerSR (version 2, Evidence Partners Inc., 
Ottawa). A team of 5 reviewers (A.A., B.C., R.R., L.C., M.A.) inde-
pendently extracted study data in duplicate that included base-
line characteristics; interventions for nonnutritive sweeteners 
and comparators (for trials) or consumption of nonnutritive 
sweeteners and confounders or covariates (for cohorts); type, 
dose and duration of exposure to nonnutritive sweeteners; 
duration of follow-up; and cardiometabolic outcomes. For RCTs, 
we preferentially extracted data from intention-to-treat analy-
ses or requested the data from authors. For cohorts, we 
extracted adjusted effect estimates in 2 formats: ratios compar-
ing the highest versus lowest category of nonnutritive sweet-
ener intake, and beta estimates quantifying linear associations 
per unit of nonnutritive sweetener intake. If multiple adjusted 
estimates were reported, we extracted the estimate from the 
statistical model that included the largest number of covariates. 
Data that were presented in nonextractable formats were 
requested from authors.
Assessment of study quality
Four reviewers (M.A., J.L., L.C., B.C.) assessed potential bias in RCTs 
using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool29,30 and evalu-
ated the quality of cohort studies using the 9-point Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale.31 Based on previous research32,33 we designated 
2 critical confounders for cohort studies: baseline body composi-
tion (BMI or other measure of body composition) and diet quality 
(total energy or sugar intake, or a diet pattern or quality score).
Statistical analysis
For the meta-analysis of continuous outcomes, we calculated 
mean differences (MD) or standardized MDs. For binary out-
comes, we calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios (RRs) 
or hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When 
nonnutritive sweetener intake units differed between cohort 
studies, we converted β estimates to t values (β/standard error) 
to generate a unitless metric28 and calculated the pooled mean 
correlation. Subgroup analyses were planned a priori to explore 
heterogeneity and determine associations in prespecified strata. 
We conducted the analyses with random-effects models using 
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software (version 2.2.064) or Rev-
Man (version 5.3.5). Statistical heterogeneity was quantified 
using the I2 statistic. We assessed publication bias using funnel 
plots, and the trim and fill method.
Results
From 11 774 citations, we assessed 938 full-text articles for 
eli 
gibility, and 37 studies involving a total of 406 910 individu-
als met our inclusion criteria: 7 RCTs19,20,34–38 and 30 cohort 
studies14–18,21–24,39–60 (Figure 1).

The 7 RCTs enrolled a total of 1003 participants who were 
obese,38 overweight19,20,34,35 or hypertensive36,37 (Table 1). The 
interventions for nonnutritive sweeteners included beverages 
sweetened with aspartame or unspecified nonnutritive sweeten-
ers,19,20,34,35 stevioside capsules36,37 or consumption of aspartame 
at the discretion of the participant.38 The duration of interven-
tions ranged from 6 to 24 months (median 6 mo, interquartile 
range [IQR] 6–14). Most RCTs were at unclear or high risk of bias 
(Table 1 and Appendix 1, Table S3).
The 30 observational studies reported outcomes from 22 dis-
tinct cohorts involving a total of 405 907 individuals (Table 2). 
Most of the studies used food frequency questionnaires to evalu-
ate beverages containing nonnutritive sweeteners. More than 
85% controlled for baseline body composition, diet quality, age, 
sex, smoking and physical activity, whereas less than 50% con-
trolled for ethnicity and socioeconomic 
status (Appendix 1, Table S4). The 
duration of follow-up ranged from 1 to 
38 years (median 10 yr, IQR 6–22). Most 
cohort studies were of moderate qual-
ity (Table 2 and Appendix 1, Table S5).
Primary outcome: body mass 
index
Two RCTs involving hypertensive par-
ticipants who were taking stevioside 
capsules36,37 and 1 RCT involving partic-
ipants who were overweight and con-
suming artificially sweetened bever-
ages20 showed no significant effect on 
BMI over 6 to 24 months (MD –0.37 kg/
m2, 95% CI –1.10 to 0.36; I2 9%; 3 trials; 
242 participants; Table 3, Figure 2A). 
Two cohort studies that reported con-
tinuous nonnutritive sweetener intake 
in healthy participants14,15 showed a 
positive correlation with BMI over 3 to 
13 years (mean correlation 0.05, 95% CI 
0.03 to 0.06; I2 0%; 2 cohorts; 21 256 
participants; Table 3, Figure 2B). A 
third cohort study that reported quan-
tiles of nonnutritive sweetener intake50 
found that participants who consumed 
nonnutrive sweeteners daily had a 
greater increase in BMI during 8 years 
of follow-up than those who did not 
consume them (MD 0.77 kg/m2, 95% CI 
0.47 to 1.07 for daily v. no intake; 3371 
participants). Overall, there was lim-
ited evidence for the effect of nonnutri-
tive sweeteners on BMI, with 3 long-
term cohort studies suggesting a 
modest increase in BMI that was not 
confirmed in 2 RCTs. The limited num-
ber of eligible studies precluded sub-
group analyses.
Secondary outcomes
Weight 
Among 5 RCTs evaluating interventions using nonnutritive 
sweeteners in participants who were obese,19,20,34,35,38 there was 
no consistent effect on change in weight (standardized MD –0.17; 
95% CI –0.54 to 0.21; I2 81%; 5 trials; 791 participants) (Table 3, 
Figure 2C). Heterogeneity across the 5 trials was partially 
explained by differences in study duration: 2 longer trials19,38 
showed significant weight loss over 16 to 24  months of the inter-
vention (standardized MD –0.55, 95% CI –0.75 to –0.34; I2 0%; 2 
trials), and 3 shorter (6 mo) trials20,34,35 showed no effect for the 
use of nonnutritive sweeteners (standardized MD 0.13, 95% CI 
–0.34 to 0.59; I2 65%; 3 trials) (p for subgroup differences = 0.009; 
Appendix 1, Table S6). Weight-loss effects also tended to be

stronger in RCTs with industry sponsorship19,34,38 (standardized 
MD –0.37; 95% CI –0.71 to –0.03; I2 77%; 3 trials) compared with 
RCTs that were not funded by industry20,35 (standardized MD 0.30, 
95% CI –0.38 to 0.99; I2 55%; 2 trials) (p for subgroup differences = 
0.09; Appendix 1, Table S6). Notably, both longer-term RCTs were 
funded by industry,19,38 making it impossible to isolate the effect 
of trial duration and industry sponsorship in subgroup analyses. 
In addition, all 5 RCTs that evaluated weight change were at high 
risk of bias, prohibiting subgroup analyses according to this 
metric.
Two observational studies reported on intake of nonnutritive 
sweeteners and subsequent weight change in 4 cohorts over 
periods of 2 to 4 years21,57 (Table 3, Figure 2D). There was a signifi-
cant positive correlation between intake of nonnutritive sweet-
eners and weight gain (weighted mean correlation 0.06, 95% CI 
0.05 to 0.07; I2 46%; 4 cohorts; 32 405 participants) (Table 3).
Adiposity and overweight
Three RCTs involving participants who were obese and consum-
ing diet soda as part of a weight-loss program reported inconsis-
tent effects on waist circumference (standardized MD –0.16; 
95% CI –0.56 to 0.25; I2 83%; 3 trials; 683 participants) (Table 3, 
Appendix 1, Figure S1A). Heterogeneity across studies was 
related to the duration of intervention, with one 12-month trial 
showing a significant reduction in waist circumference19 and two 
6-month interventions finding no effect20,34 (p for subgroup differ-
ences 0.001). One 6-month trial reported no effect on percentage 
of body fat.35 
In contrast to RCTs, cohort studies with 4 to 9 years of follow-
up showed that higher intake of nonnutritive sweeteners was 
associated with increasing waist circumference (MD 2.27 cm, 
95% CI 0.96 to 3.58; 1 cohort; 384 participants)18 (Table 3), higher 
incidence of abdominal obesity (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.07; 
1 cohort; 5011 participants)60 (Table 3) and higher incidence of 
overweight (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.66 for highest v. lowest 
intake quantiles; I2 0%; 3 cohorts; 7917 participants)22,50,59 
(Table 3 and Appendix 1, Figure S1B).
Metabolic outcomes 
Incidence for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes was not 
reported in the RCTs. Pooled data from cohort studies with 4 to 
24 years of follow-up showed higher risk of metabolic syndrome 
(RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.40; I2 0%; 5 cohorts; 27 914 partici-
pants)39,47,48,54,60 (Table 3 and Appendix 1, Figure S2A) and type 2 
diabetes (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.25; I2 52%; 9 cohorts; 400 571 
participants)16,24,42,49,55,56,58,60 for the highest versus lowest quan-

tiles of nonnutritive sweetener intake (Table 3, Figure 2E). In sub-
group analyses, heterogeneity was not explained by baseline 
weight status, study quality, duration of follow-up or dose of 
nonnutritive sweeteners (Appendix 1, Table S7). Among 4 cohorts 
that reported continuous effect estimates, we found a 3% higher 
relative risk of type 2 diabetes per additional daily serving of 
nonnutritive sweetener (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05; I2 0%; 
4 cohorts; 221 363 participants)24,42,53,56 (Table 3 and Appendix 1, 
Figure S2B). We found no statistically significant associations for 
insulin resistance (3 trials; Appendix 1, Figure S3), glycosylated 
hemoglobin (1 trial), glucose tolerance (1 cohort) or gestational 
diabetes (1 cohort) (Table 3).
Cardiorenal outcomes 
Cardiorenal outcomes were not reported in the RCTs. Among 
cohort studies, we found that high nonnutritive sweetener intake 
was associated with a higher risk of hypertension over 5 to 
38 years of follow-up (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.20; I2 64%; 5 
cohorts; 232 630 participants)45,48,60 (Table 3 and Appendix 1, Fig-
ure S4A). In addition, high intake of nonnutritive sweetener was 
associated with a higher risk of stroke (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 
1.26; I2 0%; 2 cohorts; 128 176 participants)40 and cardiovascular 
events (RR 1.32; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.52; I2 0%; 2 cohorts; 62 178 par-
ticipants),17,52 whereas there was no significant association with 
coronary heart disease (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; I2 0%;

2 cohorts; 131 403 participants)46,51 (Table 3 and Appendix 1, Fig-
ures S4B–4D).
Publication bias
Because of the limited number of studies, we could not assess 
publication bias for most outcomes, with the exception of type 2 
diabetes. Although the pooled RR from 9 published studies that 
reported incident type 2 diabetes in high versus low consumers 
of nonnutritive sweeteners was significant (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 
to 1.23), it was attenuated to 1.07 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.18) after 
imputing missing studies (Appendix 1, Figure S5). This suggests 
potential publication bias that favours studies reporting a posi-
tive association between nonnutritive sweetener consumption 
and type 2 diabetes.
Interpretation
Evidence from small RCTs with short follow-up (median 6 mo) 
suggests that consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners is not con-
sistently associated with decreases in body weight, BMI or waist 
circumference. However, in larger prospective cohort studies with 
longer follow-up periods (median 10 yr), intake of nonnutritive 
sweeteners is significantly associated with modest long-term 
increases in each of these measures. Cohort studies further sug-
gest that consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners is associated 
with higher risks of obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, 
type 2 diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular disease events; how-
ever, publication bias was indicated for type 2 diabetes, and there 
are no data available from RCTs to confirm these observations.
Previous reviews12,65 concluded that, although data from 
RCTs support weight-loss effects from sustained nonnutritive 
sweetener interventions, observational studies provide incon-
sistent results. Building on these findings, we included new 
studies14–24 and found that consumption of nonnutritive sweet-
eners was not generally associated with weight loss among 
participants in RCTs, except in long-term (≥ 12 mo) trials with 
industry sponsorship. In addition, we found that consumption of 
nonnutritive sweeteners was associated with modest long-term 
weight gain in observational studies. Our results also extend 
previous meta-analyses that showed higher risks of type 2 
diabetes32,33 and hypertension66 with regular consumption of 
nonnutritive sweeteners.
Our results highlight both the value and challenge of incorpo-
rating observational studies when examining the effect of real-
world exposures on health outcomes that develop slowly over 
time. Although RCTs provide the highest quality of scientific evi-
dence, they often fail to recapitulate chronic dietary exposures 
that are captured in decades-long cohort studies. However, it is 
not uncommon for hypotheses based on observational evidence 
to fail when tested in RCTs,67 and these data should therefore be 
interpreted with caution.
Strengths of our systematic review include use of a registered 
protocol and sensitive, peer-reviewed search strategy. We syn-
thesized evidence from both RCTs and observational studies, 
assessed multiple cardiometabolic outcomes and focused on 
long-term effects. 
Limitations
The main limitation of our review is the unavoidable grouping of 
exposure and outcome variables. We could not evaluate different 
types or formulations of nonnutritive sweeteners because most 
studies did not report this information, and we could not assess 
dose effects owing to the limited number of RCTs and the semi-
quantitative nature of the reporting of nonnutritive sweetener 
intake in cohort studies. In addition, some cardiometabolic out-
comes could not be evaluated individually becuse of the way 
they were combined and reported in the original studies (e.g., 
“overweight and obesity,” “cardiovascular events”). Finally, 
meta-analysis was not always possible because of reporting dif-
ferences and the paucity of eligible studies.
The individual studies included in our review also have limita-
tions. Most RCTs were at high risk of bias, and most cohort stud-
ies achieved only moderate quality scores. In the cohort studies, 
the ascertainment of exposure to nonnutritive sweeteners by 
self-report was likely incomplete,6 and the comparison of 
extreme intake quantiles may have yielded biased results. Fur-
thermore, these studies evaluated consumption of artificially 
sweetened beverages before 2004; however, nonnutritive sweet-
eners are increasingly found in other foods, and consumption 
has increased considerably in recent years.6 
Observational studies are also subject to confounding bias, 
particularly when the exposure (e.g., nonnutritive sweeteners) is 
a potential “treatment” for the outcomes under investigation. 
However, critical confounders (baseline body composition and 
diet quality) were largely accounted for in the included studies, 
and we limited confounding by reverse causation by including 
only prospective studies that documented intake of nonnutritive 
sweeteners before weight change and disease incidence. 
Randomized controlled trials of nonnutritive sweetener inter-
ventions also have known limitations.68 All were relatively short 
in duration, and the majority were conducted as part of multi-
faceted weight loss programs in obese individuals, which does 
not address routine consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners by 
healthy individuals. In addition, some trials evaluated nonnutri-
tive sweeteners in capsule form, which may alter their physio-
logic effects, while others were subject to potential bias from 
lack of blinding and industry sponsorship. Finally, several studies 
focused on BMI and waist circumference, which are imperfect 
indices of body composition, despite being established predic-
tors of cardiovascular disease.69,70
Conclusion
Evidence from RCTs does not clearly support the intended bene-
fits of nonnutritive sweeteners for weight management. In con-
trast, observational data suggest that routine consumption of 
nonnutritive sweeteners may be associated with a long-term 
increase in BMI and elevated risk of cardiometabolic disease; 
however, these associations have not been confirmed in experi-
mental studies and may be influenced by publication bias. New 
studies are needed to compare different types and formulations 
of nonnutritive sweeteners, and to evaluate the net effect of sub-
stituting nonnutritive sweeteners for sugar. Improved assess-
ment tools and biomarker approaches71 should be used to accu-

rately capture consumption of nonnutritive sweeteners, and 
confounding bias must be carefully addressed. Given the wide-
spread and increasing use of nonnutritive sweeteners, caution is 
warranted until the long-term risks and benefits of these prod-
ucts are fully characterized.
