abstract
OBJECTIVES: Rudeness is routinely experienced by medical teams. We sought to explore the 
impact of rudeness on medical teams’ performance and test interventions that might 
mitigate its negative consequences.
METHODS: Thirty-nine NICU teams participated in a training workshop including simulations 
of acute care of term and preterm newborns. In each workshop, 2 teams were randomly 
assigned to either an exposure to rudeness (in which the comments of the patient’s 
mother included rude statements completely unrelated to the teams’ performance) or 
control (neutral comments) condition, and 2 additional teams were assigned to rudeness 
with either a preventative (cognitive bias modification [CBM]) or therapeutic (narrative) 
intervention. Simulation sessions were evaluated by 2 independent judges, blind to team 
exposure, who used structured questionnaires to assess team performance.
RESULTS: Rudeness had adverse consequences not only on diagnostic and intervention 
parameters (mean therapeutic score 3.81 ± 0.36 vs 4.31 ± 0.35 in controls, P < .01), but also 
on team processes (such as information and workload sharing, helping and communication) 
central to patient care (mean teamwork score 4.04 ± 0.34 vs 4.43 ± 0.37, P < .05). CBM 
mitigated most of these adverse effects of rudeness, but the postexposure narrative 
intervention had no significant effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Rudeness has robust, deleterious effects on the performance of medical teams. 
Moreover, exposure to rudeness debilitated the very collaborative mechanisms recognized 
as essential for patient care and safety. Interventions focusing on teaching medical 
professionals to implicitly avoid cognitive distraction such as CBM may offer a means to 
mitigate the adverse consequences of behaviors that, unfortunately, cannot be prevented.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Rudeness is 
routinely experienced by medical teams. Medical 
professionals exposed to rude behavior performed 
poorly on diagnostic and procedural tasks related 
to the medical treatment they provided. Reduced 
information sharing and helping mediated the 
effects of rudeness on their performance.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Rudeness had adverse 
consequences not only on therapeutic components 
of medical teams’ performance, but also on 
collaborative team processes essential for such 
performance. Cognitive bias modifi
 cation as a 
preventative intervention mitigated most of these 
negative consequences of rudeness.

RISKIN et al 
Rude and disrespectful behaviors, 
prevalent in all organizations, 
 
1 
are increasingly widespread in 
high-intensity, service-oriented 
organizations, such as hospitals and 
health care facilities. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
– 
11 Doctors, 
nurses, and other health care 
providers are regularly exposed to 
rude behaviors from their superiors, 
peers, patients, and families of 
patients. This is concerning because 
beyond the adverse effects such 
behavior can have on their targets’ 
well-being, 
 
12 a growing body of 
research indicates that rudeness 
can also have devastating effects 
on individual performance. For 
example, studies have demonstrated 
that in comparison with controls, 
participants exposed to even mildly 
rude behavior (eg, insensitive and 
unexpectedly disrespectful acts or 
utterances) performed poorly on 
cognitive tasks, exhibited reduced 
creativity and flexibility, and were 
less helpful and prosocial. This effect 
was observed regardless of whether 
they were the target of such behavior 
or simply a witness. 
13 
–15
Building on such findings, in a recent 
study, we applied a simulation-based 
experimental design to examine the 
impact of colleague-based rudeness 
on a variety of individual-level 
practitioner outcomes in a NICU 
context, finding robust adverse 
consequences with respect to 
accuracy of diagnosis and quality of 
care (ie, misspecification of medical 
orders and errors in fulfillment of 
medical orders). 
16 Moreover, we 
identified diminished information 
sharing and help seeking among the 
NICU staff as key processes adversely 
affected by rudeness and mediating 
its impact on individual practitioner 
performance. 
16 Overall, rudeness 
explained 43% of the variance in 
practitioner performance; 20 points 
more than that accounted for by all 
other commonly explored causes 
of iatrogenesis, such as chronic 
sleep loss. 
16 Aside from highlighting 
the often overlooked role of social 
interactions as a risk factor for 
iatrogenesis, 
 
17 this study raised 
3 main questions that we seek to 
address in the current investigation.
First, although the preceding 
findings suggest that collaborative 
processes may be adversely affected 
by rudeness, we know little about 
the team-level consequences of 
rudeness. Indeed, whereas laboratory 
research using student participants 
has consistently demonstrated the 
adverse impact of rudeness on the 
performance of individual victims 
and witnesses, 
 
13 
– 
15 we are unaware 
of research examining team-level 
effects. Accordingly, the first question 
we address is the degree to which 
rudeness also affects team processes 
and, ultimately, team performance. 
Second, whereas the earlier study 
demonstrated the adverse effects 
of colleague-based rudeness, the 
implications of rudeness stemming 
from a patient or patient family 
member remain unknown. This is 
important because although medical 
facilities may be able to control 
colleague-based rudeness, there is 
little they can do to control patient or 
family rudeness. Hence, the second 
question we address is the degree to 
which findings regarding the impact 
of colleague-based rudeness are 
generalizable to patient/family-based 
rudeness. Finally, because rudeness 
can have such a devastating effect 
on practitioner performance, we 
questioned whether preventative 
and/or treatment interventions 
might mitigate these adverse effects.
Accordingly, the first and second 
aims of the current study were 
to see if we could replicate our 
previous findings at the team level 
with rudeness stemming from 
an alternative source (ie, patient 
family). In this context, we examined 
the extent to which patient-based 
rudeness influenced such team-
level processes as information 
sharing, workload sharing, helping 
and communication, as well as 
such team-level medical outcomes 
as diagnostic and procedural 
performance.
To address the third question, we 
examined the potential mitigating 
effects of 1 potential preventative 
intervention and 1 potential 
treatment intervention. In terms 
of the former, framing rudeness 
as a threatening stimulus eliciting 
appraisal and interpretation 
(processes drawing cognitive 
resources from the task at hand), 
we looked to interventions focused 
on cognitive bias modification 
(CBM) targeting threat-related 
interpretation biases. CBM 
interventions involve brief, 
computerized cognitive training 
modules designed to alter threat-
oriented biases in interpretation 
by promoting a more positive/
benign rather than threat-based 
interpretation of ambiguous 
information or stimuli. 
18 
 
– 
21 Similar, 
preperformance cognitive training 
modules have been demonstrated 
to enhance attention control and 
are in place in a wide variety of 
performance domains, including 
surgery and flight control.22 
– 
24 CBM 
may have similar potential in this 
regard because it has been shown 
to increase people’s resiliency to 
attention-diverting stressors by 
training them to shift their attention 
away from threat. Accordingly, 
we posited that to the extent that 
practitioners can learn to interpret 
interpersonal emotional expression 
as less hostile, they and their 
teammates should be less affected 
by such expressions and be better 
positioned to apply their cognitive 
resources to the tasks at hand and 
provide enhanced clinical care.
The second, treatment intervention 
was informed by research by 
Pennebaker on the treatment 
of victims of sexual abuse. 
25 
 
 
– 
30 
Pennebaker and others have 
demonstrated that recovery 
among such victims is facilitated 
by composing a narrative of the

event. Underlying this approach 
is the notion that “constructing 
stories is a natural human process 
that helps individuals understand 
their experiences and themselves, 
” 
thus facilitating “a sense of 
resolution, which results in less 
rumination and eventually allows 
disturbing experiences to subside 
gradually from conscious thought.” 
30 
Accordingly, we posited that by 
writing a narrative about a rude 
event just experienced, practitioners 
would more efficiently process 
the experience and thus be better 
positioned to focus their attention on 
their team and subsequent cases they 
were asked to manage.
METHODS
Participants
Thirty-nine NICU teams, each 
comprising 2 physicians and 2 
nurses, were recruited from among 
the various NICUs operating in 
Israel’s hospitals. Teams were offered 
the opportunity to join a full medical 
simulation training day in The Israel 
Medical Simulation Center at Sheba 
Medical Center at Tel Hashomer. 
31 
The espoused purpose of the exercise 
was to train teams in the debriefing 
techniques described and examined 
by Vashdi et al as a means to 
facilitate team learning and enhance 
performance. 
32
Procedure
Four teams were recruited for 
each simulation day. Two teams 
were randomly assigned to either 
a rudeness (in which the scripted 
comments of the infant’s mother 
early in the day included a rude 
statement completely unrelated to 
the teams’ performance) or control 
(neutral comments) condition, and 
2 additional teams were assigned to 
rudeness with either a preventative 
(CBM) or therapeutic (narrative) 
intervention.
Randomization
Randomization was achieved by 
using a system of randomly prepared 
cards in sealed, nontransparent 
envelopes containing the 4 condition 
assignments. There were separate 
envelopes for each simulation day. 
At the start of each simulation day, 
the research assistant drew the cards 
from the envelope and assigned 
each of the preregistered teams 
to 1 of the 4 conditions (control, 
rudeness, rudeness with narrative, 
and rudeness with CBM) according 
to the card pull for that day. On 
those five simulation days on which 
a team scheduled to participate 
failed to show up, the research 
assistant randomly excluded 1 of 
the noncontrol condition cards from 
the card draw to ensure that there 
was always a team in the control 
condition.
Ethical Considerations
Each team member underwent a 
prestudy, consenting process in 
which they signed an informed 
consent form (written per the 
specifications of the institutional 
review boards of the first author’s 
university, and the medical center 
with which Israel Center for Medical 
Simulation is affiliated). This 
form specified that the purpose 
of the study was to examine 
factors influencing medical team 
performance. As part of this process, 
participants were specifically told 
that in the course of the simulations, 
their performance would be recorded 
and observed by others, and that 
they would be required to interface 
with actors playing the role of their 
patients' family members. They 
were also told that rather than 
giving them feedback during the 
course of their simulation work, 
observers would do so after each 
simulation in the context of the 
debriefing. We explained to them 
that these postsimulation sessions 
would be used not only to provide 
performance feedback but also to 
teach debriefing skills, including 
reflection, analysis, and planning. We 
also reviewed with participants the 
section of the consent form indicating 
that they were free to withdraw 
from the study at any time. Upon 
completing the final instruments 
at the end of the simulation day, 
all participants were debriefed. 
In this poststudy debriefing, we 
(1) again reviewed participants’ 
right to withdraw from the study 
as well as their right to withdraw 
their personal data from the study; 
(2) reminded participants that 
although the “patients” and “family 
members” that they interacted with 
in different scenarios were just 
manikins and actors, respectively, it 
was perfectly normal to be disturbed 
by some of these experiences; and 
(3) informed participants that 
support was available for those 
feeling particularly disturbed by their 
experiences. None of the participants 
withdrew their informed consent or 
requested that their data be withheld 
or destroyed, and no one asked for 
the psychological assistance that we 
offered to provide discretely.
After reviewing the informed consent 
forms, participants were briefed on 
the reflexivity training exercise that 
would occur at the conclusion of each 
of the simulations during the day.
Scenarios
Regardless of condition, the day 
comprised 5 emergency scenarios in 
neonatal medicine:
Neonate with severe jaundice 
(pathologic hyperbilirubinemia) 
because of glucose-6-phosphate-
dehydrogenase deficiency. Because 
intensive phototherapy did not 
sufficiently reduce the bilirubin 
levels, double volume exchange 
transfusion should be performed.
Newborn in hypovolemic shock. The 
neonate was delivered via vacuum 
extraction and developed a rapidly 
expanding subgaleal hemorrhage 
with consumption coagulopathy.
3

RISKIN et al 
Infant with severe respiratory 
distress after meconium 
aspiration syndrome. The neonate 
developed persistent pulmonary 
hypertension, was intubated and 
received inhaled nitric oxide. His 
respiratory status was further 
complicated by a pneumothorax 
necessitating insertion of a thorax 
drain.
Newborn with severe neonatal 
asphyxia with hypoxic ischemic 
encephalopathy. Total body 
cooling, also referred to as 
hypothermia treatment, is the 
state-of-the-art management of 
this condition.
Imminent delivery of very premature 
(23 weeks and 6 days gestation) 
extremely low birth weight infant 
at the verge of viability. This 
scenario required the team to 
manage the initial delivery room 
resuscitation and stabilization. 
They then had to address the 
neonate’s deterioration secondary 
to massive pulmonary hemorrhage 
and severe bilateral grade IV 
intraventricular hemorrhage. The 
scenario required the team to 
manage family grieving as well as 
ethical dilemmas.
We arranged for the first scenario 
(incorporating the rudeness event) 
to occur concomitantly across all 
4 conditions. The other scenarios 
occurred in random order.
In each scenario, the participants 
were told that the NICU manikin lying 
in the incubator was their patient and 
that the patient’s vitals would appear 
on the monitors immediately at the 
start of the simulation. Additionally, 
the participants were provided with 
neonate’s medical history. They 
were also informed that they might 
encounter professional actors playing 
parents of their patient and would 
be asked to interact and respond 
to them as they would in real life. 
Additionally, participants were asked 
to work as a team and told that they 
would receive 20 to 25 minutes to 
discuss and develop a treatment plan 
for each clinical scenario. Specifically, 
the team was required to identify the 
acute deterioration in the newborn’s 
condition and respond promptly 
by providing the appropriate 
resuscitative treatments, while trying 
to diagnose the underlying medical 
condition. Based on conventional 
protocol, the main actions required 
from the medical team were detailed 
for each scenario and distributed 
to independent judges (senior 
neonatologists and veteran nurses) 
to facilitate their monitoring and 
evaluation. The scenarios were 
designed such that a team’s failure 
to follow these specified actions 
would likely lead to further rapid 
deterioration and ultimately the 
infant’s demise within a short time. 
The scenarios involved diagnostic 
and manual intervention skills and 
required that members engage with 
one another in making and executing 
therapeutic decisions. Following 
each simulation, the team entered a 
separate room for a reflexivity-based 
debriefing. Prior to the start of the 
reflexivity exercise, the judges were 
asked to complete a questionnaire in 
which they graded the participants’ 
performance.
Measures
Two independent NICU staff (1 
senior doctor and 1 experienced 
nurse) blinded to the experimental 
intervention observed each 
team’s performance in each of 
the simulation scenarios from an 
adjacent control room with 1-way 
mirrors and multiple video monitors 
allowing for close-up observation and 
the monitoring of the patient’s vital 
signs. Before serving in that capacity, 
all judges underwent a daylong 
training program emphasizing 
the monitoring and assessment of 
the team (rather than individual 
members) as the unit of analysis. 
To enhance interrater reliability, as 
part of this training, descriptors and 
examples of indicative behaviors 
were presented to the judges and 
discussed by them to ensure that 
all had a common understanding of 
their meaning and application. For 
each scenario, using a 5-point Likert 
scale (1 = failed; 5 = excellent), judges 
independently rated each team’s 
performance along items relating to 
9 parameters separated into 2 broad 
aspects of team performance:
Medical and therapeutic 
performance—(1) Diagnostic 
performance (ie, time taken to 
diagnose, accuracy of diagnosis), 
(2) quality of therapy plan (ie, 
appropriateness of plan given 
diagnosis; plan accounts for unique 
constraints), (3) intervention (ie 
procedural or skill performance), 
and (4) overall general assessment 
of medical therapy (eg, errors 
made in diagnosis, therapy 
plan or execution; adequacy 
of performance given unique 
constraints). 
16
Teamwork or relational cooperative 
aspects of performance within 
the team—(5) Information 
sharing, (6) workload sharing, (7) 
helping among team members, 
(8) communication between team 
members, and (9) overall general 
assessment of teamwork.

Interventions
Each NICU team was exposed to 
comments or critiques by the infant’s 
parents, according to the control or 
rudeness condition. These comments 
included neutral statements in 
the control condition or the same, 
mildly rude statement (ie, “I knew 
we should have gone to a better 
hospital where they don’t practice 
Third World medicine!”) in all 3 of 
the rudeness conditions (rudeness by 
itself, CBM followed by rudeness, and 
rudeness followed by the narrative 
intervention).
Exposure to rude or neutral 
comments from the mother of the 
infant occurred at the beginning of 
the first scenario of the day, which 
4

, number

was the same for all groups (scenario 
1 of the infant with severe neonatal 
jaundice).
Just before this first scenario, 
teams in the preventative, CBM 
intervention 
20 engaged in a 
20-minute computer game in 
which they looked at a series of 
morphing faces, 
 
41 were asked to 
move a cursor to indicate whether 
the emotion expressed was more of 
anger or pleasure, and then received 
immediate feedback on their choice.
The Emotion Recognition Task of the 
CBM Intervention
Stimuli for the task were generated 
using Morpheus Photo Morpher 
v3.16 (Morpheus Software, Grand 
Rapids, MI). Four sequences of 
morphed faces were generated 
based on the happy and angry 
pictures of 2 males and 2 females 
taken from the NimStim set30. The 
faces were selected to represent 
both genders and different racial 
origins (Caucasian, African American, 
Hispanic, and Asian) and after pilot 
tests that demonstrated test–retest 
validity for these morphed sequences 
in the emotion perception task. 
Each sequence consisted of 15 faces 
equally spaced on a continuum 
between the happy and angry end 
points. Each face from each morphed 
sequence was presented 3 times, 
for a total of 180 trials (4 sequences 
× 15 faces × 3 repetitions). Faces 
were displayed in a random order. 
Each trial began with a fixation cross 
(800–1200 milliseconds), followed 
by a color morphed face picture 
(90 mm in height and 70 mm in 
width). The face was displayed for 
200 milliseconds and then masked 
by a scrambled face display for 
200 milliseconds. Then a question 
mark appeared on the screen and 
remained until a response was made. 
Participants were instructed to press 
1 of 2 designated buttons as fast as 
they could to indicate whether the 
face was “angry” or “happy.” After 
the participant’s response, the next 
trial began 100 to 400 milliseconds 
later. The order in which the various 
faces were displayed was randomly 
determined.
During this game, the computer 
program first determined the 
participants threshold to threat (ie, 
angry faces) and then gave them 
feedback designed to raise this 
threshold and as such “immunize” 
them from devoting substantial 
attention to minor threats.
While teams in this condition were 
engaged in the CBM computer 
game, teams in the narrative 
intervention 
28 
– 
30 worked on their 
first simulation and were exposed 
to the rudeness incident specified 
earlier. Immediately after this 
simulation, teams in this condition 
were directed to a debriefing room 
and asked to write 1 or 2 paragraphs 
about how they thought the mother 
of the infant felt when it seemed to 
her that the team was unsuccessful in 
treating her newborn.
In all, teams were randomly allocated 
to 1 of 4 conditions: (1) control, (2) 
rudeness, (3) rudeness with the 
CBM intervention, and (4) rudeness 
with the narrative intervention. 
Effects of rudeness exposure (vs 
neutral control condition) and the 
moderating effect of the intervention 
(CBM or narrative) were assessed 
repeatedly throughout day.
Manipulation Check
The primacy effect of the rudeness 
manipulation and its possible 
degradation over time was checked 
at 2 points during the simulation 
day, once at midday (after the third 
scenario) and once at day’s end 
(after the fifth and final scenario). 
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
with the rudeness condition as the 
independent variable and perceived 
rudeness (assessed on the basis of a 
4-item measure validated in previous 
research 
13, 
 
14, 
 
42 and with α = .93) as 
the dependent variable indicated 
that participants rated the attitude 
toward them, especially of the 
mother of the infant, as significantly 
more polite (ie, less rude) in the 
control condition (Mcontrol = 4.75, 
SDcontrol = 0.45) than in the rude 
condition (Mrudeness = 3.75, SDrudeness = 
0.77) (F1, 
38 = 16.31, P < .001). 
This effect remained consistent, 
although somewhat attenuated, 
through the end of the day (Mcontrol = 
4.66, SDcontrol = 0.56 vs Mrudeness = 
4.01, SDrudeness = 0.61, F1, 
38 = 9.26, 
P = .004), thus confirming that the 
rudeness manipulation was effective.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted using 
SPSS (version 23, IBM, Armonk, NY) 
unless otherwise indicated. 
A power analysis based on data from 
a previous study 
16 and assuming 
a desired power of 80% with α 
of .05 (2-sided test) indicated that 
samples of at least 9 teams per 
condition would be required to 
capture moderate effects. Because 
each team’s performance in each 
of the scenarios was rated by 2 
judges, we assessed reliability (the 
relative consistency among raters), 
by calculating intraclass correlation 
coefficients (ICC1; R version 2.15.0, 
The R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria). An 
ICC1 of 0.10 or higher indicated that 
the item could be averaged across 
judges. 
43 Comparisons of therapeutic 
and teamwork performance scores 
were done using multivariate ANOVA 
(MANOVA). Comparisons of all 
variables included in therapeutic and 
teamwork performance scores in the 
4 conditions (ie control, rudeness, 
rudeness with narrative intervention 
and rudeness with CBM intervention) 
were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA. 
Statistical significance was set at .05.
RESULTS
To ensure that our randomization 
process of assigning teams to 
conditions was appropriate, we 
first tested whether the cumulative 
5

RISKIN et al 
experience of the team’s members 
was distributed equally across the 
conditions. We conducted an ANOVA 
with the conditions (eg, control, 
rudeness, rudeness with narrative 
intervention, and rudeness with 
CBM intervention) as the factor 
and cumulative team experience 
(eg, number of years in a NICU) 
as the dependent variable. The 
results showed that there were no 
significant differences between the 
conditions (P = .26) indicating that 
the randomization process had been 
successful. Controlling for cumulative 
experience in all subsequent analyses 
did not significantly change any of 
the results. Therefore, we report 
the results without controlling for 
cumulative experience.
Because each team’s performance in 
each of the scenarios was rated by 2 
judges, we first assessed reliability 
(the relative consistency among 
raters) by calculating ICC1. The 
resulting ICCs indicated moderate 
to high interrater reliability, thus 
supporting aggregation to the team 
level (data not shown but available 
from the first author).
Next, we tested whether the rudeness 
manipulation harmed team’s 
performance. We first averaged the 
4 indicators of the therapeutic team 
scores (ie, diagnostic, therapy plan, 
intervention, and overall therapeutic 
performance, with α = .97) and the 
5 indicators of teamwork score 
(ie, information sharing, workload 
sharing, helping, communication, and 
overall performance, with α = .96) 
to form scales. Next we conducted a 
MANOVA with the rudeness versus 
control condition as the factor 
and therapeutic and teamwork 
scores as the dependent variables. 
The overall model representing 
the influence of rudeness on the 2 
dependent variables was significant 
(multivariate P < .05, η2 = 0.36). 
ANOVA results showed that the 
rudeness condition affected both 
the therapeutic score (P < .01, η2 = 
0.39; Mrudeness = 3.80, SDrudeness = 
0.34, Mcontrol = 4.37, SDcontrol = 0.40) 
and the teamwork score (P < .05, 
η2 = 0.23; Mrudeness = 4.06, SDrudeness = 
0.34, Mcontrol = 4.43, SDcontrol = 0.39). 
 
Table 1 reports mean comparison 
between the control and rudeness 
groups for all performance measures. 
As shown, rudeness was associated 
with diminished team performance 
along all team outcomes (eg, 
diagnostic score; intervention 
score) and process (eg, information 
sharing, communication) parameters, 
although these differences were only 
marginally significant (P < .10) in 
the case of diagnostic accuracy and 
information sharing).
Next, we tested the effects of the CBM 
intervention on the performance 
measures. We first conducted a 
MANOVA with the “CBM inoculation 
followed by rudeness” condition 
versus control condition as the 
factor, and medical/therapeutic 
performance and teamwork as the 
dependent variables. The overall 
model representing the influence 
of the CBM intervention on the 
2 dependent variables was not 
significant (multivariate P = .61). 
ANOVA results showed that after 
employing the CBM inoculation, 
rudeness did not affect the 
therapeutic score (P = .48), nor did it 
affect the teamwork score (P = .47). 
 
Table 2 reports mean comparison 
between the control and CBM groups 
for all performance measures. As 
shown, the CBM intervention reduced 
the effects of rudeness on all the 
team outcomes (eg, diagnostic score; 
intervention score) and process (eg, 
information sharing, communication) 
parameters. Thus, it seems that 
the CBM intervention succeeded in 
“immunizing” participants from the 
effects of rudeness.
Finally, we tested the effects of the 
narrative intervention on the 2 
performance outcomes. Here again, 
we first conducted a MANOVA 
with the “rudeness followed by 
narrative intervention” condition 
versus control condition as the 
factor, and medical/ therapeutic 
performance and teamwork as the 
dependent variables. The overall 
model representing the influence of 
the narrative intervention on the 2

dependent variables was significant 
(multivariate P < .05, η2 = 0.31). 
ANOVA results showed that the 
rudeness in the narrative condition 
affected both the therapeutic score 
(P < .05, η2 = 0.25; Mnarrative = 3.89, 
SDnarrative = 0.48, Mcontrol = 4.37, 
SDcontrol = 0.40) and the teamwork 
score (P < .05, η2 = 0.22; Mnarrative = 
4.04, SDnarrative = 0.39, Mcontrol = 4.43, 
SDcontrol = 0.39).  
Table 3 reports mean 
comparison between the control and 
narrative groups for all performance 
measures. As shown, the narrative 
intervention did not reduce the 
effects of rudeness for any of the 
team outcomes (eg, diagnostic score; 
intervention score) and process (eg, 
information sharing, communication) 
parameters. Thus, the data indicate 
that the narrative intervention failed.
Examination of the manipulation 
checks presented in  
Tables 1,  
2, and 
 
3 shows that, similar to the rudeness 
without intervention condition, those 
in the CBM intervention condition 
viewed the mother in the rudeness 
manipulation scenario as more rude 
than those in the control condition 
both at midday (P < .01) and at the 
end of the day (P < .01). In contrast, 
at midday those in the narrative 
condition did perceive the mother to 
be more rude than controls (P < .05), 
but by the end of the day, those in the 
narrative condition did not view the 
mother as more rude than controls 
(P = .09).
DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate that NICU teams 
exposed to mild rudeness expressed 
by a patient’s mother resulted in 
diminished team performance with 
respect to outcome parameters 
relating to both diagnosis and 
intervention and process parameters 
including team information and 
workload sharing. These findings not 
only replicate earlier findings 
13, 
 
14 
demonstrating the deleterious effects 
of rudeness expressed by a senior 
colleague on individual medical 
performance 
16 but also extend 
them by demonstrating that similar 
effects are elicited by rudeness from 
other sources and are manifested 
at the team level. Interestingly, 
however, the effects of rudeness on 
diagnosis and information sharing 
were only marginally significant. 
Although we can only speculate as 
to the relative weakness of these 
particular effects, one possibility is 
that because these activities require 
greater conscious effort, they may 
be less subject to any threat-based 
redirection of cognitive resources 
away from the task.
Additionally, we demonstrated that 
a preventative or “immunization” 
CBM intervention, targeting negative 
interpretations of emotional displays 
and applied before the rudeness 
incident, largely mitigated these 
deleterious effects on team medical 
outcomes and processes, whereas a 
postincident, treatment intervention 
based on victim’s composition of a 
narrative was largely ineffective in 
doing so. Still, it should be noted that 
although there was no statistically 
significant difference between the 
performance scores of teams in the

CBM intervention and those of the 
teams in the control condition, the 
scores for the former were nominally 
lower, suggesting that for some 
groups under certain conditions, 
the CBM might not always be 
entirely effective. Nevertheless, we 
demonstrated that these mitigation 
effects of the CBM intervention were, 
on average, sustained over the entire 
day.
Interestingly, examination of the 
manipulation checks presented in 
 
Tables 1,  
2, and  
3 shows that similar 
to the rudeness without intervention 
condition, those in the CBM 
intervention condition viewed the 
mother in the rudeness manipulation 
scenario as more rude than those in 
the control condition. This suggests 
that the CBM intervention did not 
distort participants’ views nor cause 
them to misperceive the mother’s 
rude behavior. Instead, as designed, 
the CBM intervention “immunized” 
participants’ medical/therapeutic 
performance and teamwork by 
shifting their attention away from 
the implicit threat posed by the 
mother, thus likely preserving 
cognitive resources for the tasks at 
hand. Results of these supplementary 
analyses indicated that the CBM 
intervention operated not so 
much by mitigating the appraisal 
of rudeness (indeed, those in this 
condition viewed the perpetrator 
as more rude than those in other 
conditions), but by making team 
members more resilient to the 
appraised rudeness; in particular, the 
intervention mitigated the degree 
to which such appraisals adversely 
affected their ability to engage in 
team processes (eg, workload and 
information sharing) central to 
timely and accurate diagnosis and 
error-free intervention. In contrast, 
by the end of the day, those in the 
narrative condition did not view the 
mother as more rude than controls. 
These results suggest that although 
writing about the experience from 
the mother’s perspective facilitated 
participants’ positive reappraisal 
of her rude behavior, it failed to 
help them overcome the cognitive 
disruption it caused.
One possible explanation for this 
seemingly inconsistent finding is that 
the cognitive processes involved in 
consciously reflecting on experienced 
behavior and assessing its level of 
politeness (targeted by the narrative 
intervention and demanded by our 
manipulation check for rudeness) 
are different from those involved in 
more automatic determinations of 
potential or actual threat (targeted 
by the CBM intervention). 
44 It 
is known that these 2 types of 
cognitive processes do not always 
operate in tandem. In the CBM task, 
the judgment is fast and crude in 
the sense that it requires a quick, 
dichotomous response, whereas the 
politeness rating score is based on a 
more thoughtful judgment process 
(answering a 4-item questionnaire 
rated on a Likert scale). Interestingly, 
this reflective and thoughtful process 
may be more similar to the one in 
the narrative condition and 
thus might have been more 
influenced by it.
The findings of this study are 
significant in a number of respects: 
first, our results reaffirmed how 
rudeness can debilitate intervention 
acuity, thus resulting in poorer 
medical treatment and, particularly 
in the intensive care context studied, 
potentially catastrophic clinical 
outcomes. Moreover, we also 
demonstrated that these deleterious 
effects of rudeness are not restricted 
to individuals as has been shown 
previously 
16 but also to teams. 
This is important because, based 
on the assumption that teams can 
often overcome and compensate for 
individual performance limitations, 
medical work is increasingly being 
structured around teams. 
45 
 
–48 Our 
findings question the generalizability 
of this assumption in situations 
in which rudeness is prevalent 
because they demonstrate that, 
precisely in these situations, the 
very collaborative processes that 
generally enable teams to outperform 
individuals may break down. To 
the extent that rudeness impedes 
team helping and workload sharing, 
teams may not be able to deliver the 
heightened level of patient care that 
practitioners have come to expect 
from them. Thus, we believe that our 
findings offer the first real evidence 
of the impact that rudeness has on 
the performance of medical teams 
and not just individuals working in 
teams.
Second, these findings are important 
because, consistent with our earlier 
findings at the individual level, 
 
16 
they suggest that relatively benign 
but negative human interactions 
could underlie many of the iatrogenic 
incidents commonly occurring in 
medical care settings. On one hand, it 
is highly disturbing because, as noted, 
such interactions are prevalent 
and, particularly in high-intensity, 
life-and-death contexts, unlikely 
to be preventable. On the other 
hand, the finding that (as shown in 
 
Table 1) rudeness explains 39% of 
the variance in team-level general 
therapeutic outcomes (a figure 
remarkably similar to the effect size 
found in our earlier individual-level 
analysis 
16) suggests that we may 
have identified an important and 
potentially “treatable” iatrogenesis-
related risk factor.
Third, these findings are also 
important in that they suggest this 
iatrogenesis-related risk factor 
may indeed be “treatable” on the 
basis of “immunization” approaches 
structured around cognitive bias 
modification. Indeed, our finding 
that a 20-minute “computer game” 
generated a sustained (daylong) 
mitigation effect suggests that 
contextual rudeness might be more 
amenable to intervention than are 
many other iatrogenesis-related 
risk factors identified in previous 
research (eg, patient overcrowding, 
physician workload, patient

morbidity characteristics, length 
of hospitalization). Nevertheless, 
because daily CBM treatments are 
unlikely to be feasible or efficacious, 
additional research is needed to 
estimate the robustness of the 
exhibited mitigation effects over 
longer periods of time and 
identify alternative CBM 
approaches that might offer a 
more sustained impact.
Furthermore, although researchers 
have hinted that contextual 
adversity may result in heightened 
rates of iatrogenesis by affecting 
individual-level cognitive processing 
and team-level collaborative 
processes, 
 
2, 
 
16, 
 
17, 
 
45, 
48 our findings 
identified and documented several 
of the collaborative processes most 
directly and adversely affected by 
contextual rudeness. Indeed, an 
understanding of the collaborative 
mechanisms involved may facilitate 
the development of proactive and 
reactive training and protocol 
interventions designed either to 
strengthen these team processes or 
to compensate for them when they 
are weakened by the team’s exposure 
to rudeness.
These study implications stand 
in stark contrast to the policy 
recommendations proposed by 
leading health care think tanks 
with regard to patient safety, many 
of which emphasize the need to 
enhance medical team engagement 
and patient focus. 
49 By highlighting 
the impact that adverse social 
contexts may have on team-level 
coordinative processes, our 
findings provide the foundation 
for a wide range of interventions 
aimed at enhancing patient safety. 
Our results suggest that instituting 
protocols and procedures aimed at 
bolstering the defenses of medical 
teams to the cognitive distraction 
and drain elicited by rudeness 
exposure can help mitigate the 
devastating consequences of these 
events, even when they cannot be 
prevented.
In conclusion, the findings presented 
here suggest that the deleterious 
effects of rudeness on medical 
performance are no less severe on 
teams than they are on individuals 
and that these effects are not 
specific to any particular type of 
source. Moreover, beyond its direct 
effect on cognitive functions and on 
performance of manual procedural 
skills, we showed that exposure 
to rudeness debilitates the very 
collaborative mechanisms, such as 
communication, workload sharing, 
and helping, assumed to make 
team-based medical care more 
effective and safe than that offered by 
individual care providers. However, 
our findings also offer some basis 
for optimism: although it may be 
impossible to prevent patients and 
their families from being rude to 
care providers, we may be able to 
“immunize” these same providers 
against the adverse implications of 
such behavior on the performance 
of care providers and the teams to 
which they belong.
