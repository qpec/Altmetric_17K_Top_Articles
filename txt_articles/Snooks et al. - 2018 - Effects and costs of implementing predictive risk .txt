Aim We evaluated the introduction of a predictive 
risk stratification model (PRISM) into primary care. 
Contemporaneously National Health Service (NHS) Wales 
introduced Quality and Outcomes Framework payments 
to general practices to focus care on those at highest 
risk of emergency admission to hospital. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate the costs and effects of introducing 
PRISM into primary care.
Methods Randomised stepped wedge trial with 
32 general practices in one Welsh health board. The 
intervention comprised: PRISM software; practice-
based training; clinical support through two ’general 
practitioner (GP) champions’ and technical support. The 
primary outcome was emergency hospital admissions.
Results Across 230 099 participants, PRISM 
implementation increased use of health services: 
emergency hospital admission rates by 1 % when 
untransformed (while change in log-transformed 
rate ΔL=0.011, 95% CI 0.010 to 0.013); emergency 
department (ED) attendance rates by untransformed 3 % 
(while ΔL=0.030, 95% CI 0.028 to 0.032); outpatient 
visit rates by untransformed 5 % (while ΔL=0.055, 95% 
CI 0.051 to 0.058); the proportion of days with recorded 
GP activity by untransformed 1 % (while ΔL=0.011, 95% 
CI 0.007 to 0.014) and time in hospital by untransformed 
3 % (while ΔL=0.029, 95% CI 0.026 to 0.031). Thus 
NHS costs per participant increased by £76 (95% CI £46 
to £106).
Conclusions Introduction of PRISM resulted in a 
statistically significant increase in emergency hospital 
admissions and use of other NHS services without 
evidence of benefits to patients or the NHS.
IntroductIon
The ageing population with rising prev-
alence of chronic conditions makes 
unprecedented demands on healthcare 
services.1 2 In 2012–2013, there were 5.3 
million emergency admissions to hospi-
tals in England costing approximately 
£12.5 billion.3 Around half of these 
admissions arise from 5% of the popula-
tion—typically older people with comor-
bidities.4 Patients with chronic conditions 
are more likely to experience emergency 
hospital admissions for potentially avoid-
able causes.5 An emergency admission 
to hospital is disruptive and unsettling, 
exposing patients to clinical and psycho-
logical risks and increasing their depend-
ency.6
An estimated one in five emergency 
admissions is avoidable,7 especially when 
they arise from conditions amenable to 
community prevention or care.8 Across 
Europe, policies have recommended that 
health providers use predictive risk strat-
ification modelling  to identify patients 
at high risk of emergency admission to 
hospital for proactive management.9–12 In 
estimating individual risk scores, models 
typically include predictors relating to 
past use of healthcare, diagnoses and 
medications. The targeting of services at 
people at the highest levels of risk has 
been prominent in UK government policy 
over the past decade, notably within inte-
grated care initiatives.13 14 The National 
Health Service (NHS) England enhanced 
service, “Avoiding unplanned admissions: 
proactive case finding and patient review 
for vulnerable people”, committed £480 
million over 2014–201715 for general 
practices to create registers of patients 
at high risk of unplanned admissions for 
proactive case management. Over 95% of 
practices participated, most using predic-
tive risk tools to identify patients for case

management. Unfortunately, a planned national evalu-
ation of this enhanced service did not happen.15
In Wales, the Quality and Outcomes Framework 
(QOF) provided similar funding for practices to identify 
0.5% of their patients at significant risk of emergency 
admission for clinical review and active management. 
Practices had to nominate a lead clinician and appro-
priate review dates for identified patients.16 However, 
the evidence base for the impact of such initiatives on 
the quality and safety of care for this patient group is 
weak. There is no systematic review of interventions 
using emergency admission risk prediction models. 
Though there is a review of the effectiveness of case 
management for high-risk patients, most included 
studies did not use risk models to identify patients.17
Hence, we aimed to evaluate the costs and effects 
of introducing an emergency admission risk predic-
tion tool (PRISM) within primary care in urban South 
Wales.
Methods
study design, participants, randomisation and masking
We undertook a randomised stepped wedge trial, a 
form of cluster randomised trial.18 19 This design gives 
all participating general practices the opportunity to use 
the intervention during the study, and careful analysis 
separates the effects of the intervention from trends, 
both seasonal and longitudinal.20 21 We invited all 77 
general practices within Abertawe Bro Morgannwg 
University Health Board to participate, recruited the 
32 (42%) practices who volunteered, and grouped 
them into 11 clusters based on existing community 
networks. Swansea Trials Unit used random numbers 
to set the order in which practice clusters received the 
intervention. We concealed that allocation from prac-
tices until shortly before implementation. All partici-
pating practices began as control practices without the 
trial intervention. As the trial progressed, the number 
of intervention practices increased each month and 
the number of control practices fell (figure 1). Though 
study practices received QOF payments throughout 
the study as an incentive to participate, they did not 
have to identify or review high-risk patients until the 
PRISM software was installed. Thereafter, they used 
PRISM to identify patients who were at high risk of 
unscheduled admission. As we used routinely available 
anonymised data for our primary outcome, we did not 
need to consent patients formally to participate in the 
trial. Our single designated enrolment date is there-
fore the first day on which the PRISM tool was made 
available to support care delivery by general practices 
(30 May 2013).
We also undertook qualitative research to explore 
prior beliefs, implementation and patterns of use, 
reported in detail elsewhere.18 19 22
Intervention
The PRISM intervention (table 1) allows health profes-
sionals in general practice to view individual patients’ 
scores summarising their risk of emergency admis-
sion during the following year via a secure website. 
The NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS) used the 
anonymised data of 300 000 people in Wales (10% of 
the population) to develop the PRISM risk model and 
test it for accuracy of prediction.23 The routine data 
available for testing, included inpatient, outpatient

and general practice data, alongside a deprivation 
index—the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 
(WIMD). The final model included the 37 variables 
with the highest predictive power. NWIS update 
scores monthly and stratify them within each practice 
thus: risk group 1 comprises the 80% of the practice 
population with the lowest scores; risk group 2 the 
15% with the next high scores; risk group 3 the 4.5% 
with the next high scores and risk group 4 the 0·5% 
at highest risk of emergency hospital admission. The 
intervention also included a user friendly handbook, 
2 hours of practice-based training, clinical support 
through two locally appointed ‘general practitioner 
(GP) champions’ and a ‘help desk’ accessible by tele-
phone or email. We did not specify how or when 
practices should use the software to manage care. The 
training recommended that practices regularly review 
those at medium to high risk and select patients for 
active management to prevent worsening health and 
emergency admission. Suggestions for proactive care 
discussed in training included home visits, practice-in-
itiated appointments, review in multidisciplinary team 
meetings and coordinating care with community and 
secondary care services.
outcomes
We compared between intervention and control 
phases:
Primary outcome
Emergency hospital admissions
Secondary outcomes
 
►
Attendances at hospital emergency departments (EDs).
 
►
Outpatient attendances
 
►
Primary care events
 
►
Length of stay following emergency admission.
 
►
Health-related quality of life assessed by the SF-1224.
 
►
Patient satisfaction assessed by the quality of care 
monitor (QCM)25.
 
►
Costs of implementing PRISM, both direct and through 
changes in healthcare.
We also compared deaths between phases to check 
for unexpected effects.
data collection
We accessed routine data on healthcare use for all 
patients registered with participating practices at the 
start of the study period. We deemed patients leaving 
practices for any reason to have left the study and did 
not replace them by those registering during the study. 
We sent postal questionnaires to a stratified random 
sample of study patients.
Anonymised linked data
We used routine data from the Secure Anonymised 
Information Linkage (SAIL) databank26 to compare 
between intervention and control phases—emergency, 
secondary and primary care used by patients across the 
spectrum of risk. SAIL includes routine data on deaths 
(Office of National Statistics), emergency admissions 
(Emergency Department Data Set), secondary care 
(Patient Episode Database for Wales) and general 
practice data. We displayed posters in each partici-
pating general practice offering patients the opportu-
nity to withdraw from this analysis and removed all 
patients who so dissented. We linked PRISM scores 
from general practice to health service use data for all 
patients who had not dissented.
Postal questionnaires
We sent postal questionnaires to a random sample of 
patients, stratified by risk level, at three time points 
during the study—before, during and after implemen-
tation (figure 1). We weighted the sample to include 
proportionally more patients from risk groups 3 and 
4—the groups at highest risk, but also the smallest. 
The questionnaire comprised the SF-1224 to measure 
health-related quality of life and the QCM25 to measure 
patient satisfaction. At each time point, we provided 
2240 questionnaires for practices to distribute to 
patients, aiming for 800 responses. Practices screened 
out patients recently deceased, moved or otherwise 
unsuitable, resulting in 5232 questionnaires posted to 
patients.

statistical methods
We undertook analysis by treatment allocated, and 
assigned participants’ events to control or intervention 
phases for analysis according to the planned implemen-
tation date of the PRISM tool in their general practice. 
We estimated intracluster correlation coefficients (ICC) 
between participants in the same study practice. Using 
Stata V
.14, we analysed outcomes, expressed as rates 
based on counts but taking account of phase duration, 
by linear mixed models which always included the 
effect of PRISM. We considered, and where necessary 
adjusted for, the following covariates: gender, age in 
years, WIMD score and its separate health component 
(both from 2011), initial PRISM score, season and 
trend. We treated study practice as a random factor, 
and defined a second independent random factor to 
account for paired ‘control’ and ‘intervention’ obser-
vations from participants. To mitigate pronounced 
skewness in event-based data, we analysed and present 
log-transformed data. Modelling progressed by elimi-
nating all covariates found to be not statistically signif-
icant, starting with the least significant and concluded 
when all remaining covariates were statistically signif-
icant. We examined the assumption of normality by 
residual diagnostics. We analysed SF12 and QCM 
scores by similar repeated-measures linear models.
economic methods
We undertook economic evaluation from the perspec-
tive of the UK NHS. We estimated the costs of PRISM 
implementation (including setup, training, GP staff 
time, IT support and maintenance), and primary and 
secondary care use (including emergency admissions, 
ED attendances, outpatient visits and all inpatient 
stays) in Pounds Sterling from published unit costs for 
2015,27 GP staff interviews and questionnaires and 
SAIL. We estimated the budgetary effect on the NHS 
of adopting PRISM scoring in primary care based on 
the total cost per 100 000 patients registered in partic-
ipating practices over the trial period.
Patient involvement
We recruited two patient representatives from a local 
service user group ‘Service Users with Chronic Condi-
tions Encouraging Sensible Solutions’ (SUCCESS).28 
They were members of the research management 
team throughout the trial and maintained links with 
the wider SUCCESS group for input and support. We 
worked closely with them in designing the trial, the 
intervention and patient materials including the infor-
mation sheet, consent form and research instruments. 
Both representatives are coauthors.
results
Participant flow
We have a history of NHS contacts for 230 114 partic-
ipants from 1 February 2013 until 30 September 
2014. This includes the period of at least 4 months 
before PRISM implementation and up to 16 months 
after. Fifteen people spent the whole study period in 
hospital. We therefore included outcomes from routine 
NHS data on 230 099 participants, of whom 8034 left 
their practices during their control phase and 15 676 
during their intervention phase. We did not include 
these patients after they left, irrespective of where they 
reregistered.
baseline characteristics
Table 2 summarises baseline characteristics of the study 
population by risk groups. Mean age increases from 37 
years in the lowest risk group to 70 in the highest; 
higher risk groups include more women and WIMD 
scores slightly increase with risk across groups. Initial 
PRISM scores were available on almost all patients, 
with considerable overlap between risk groups, due to 
variation between practices in thresholds.
use of PrIsM
NWIS reported that 58 practice staff (an average of 
1.8 per practice) registered to use PRISM in the inter-
vention phase and logged in on 260 occasions (an 
average of 8.1 per practice). The average time spent 
using the PRISM website itself was 60 min (from user 
questionnaires). However, interviews revealed that

effects
Adjusting log-transformed data for length of time in 
each phase and all other significant covariates led to 
greater changes in risk groups 3 and 4 than in risk 
groups 1 and 2, owing in part to the small sizes of these 
groups. Thus, we found an increase in our primary 
outcome of emergency admissions per participant per 
year at risk of 1% in the intervention phase (table 3). 
Emergency admissions were higher in the intervention 
phase, and the effect increased with predicted risk.
The number of ED attendances per participant per 
year at risk was 3% higher in the intervention phase, 
an effect that was consistent across risk groups and 
increased with predicted risk. Outpatient attendances 
increased by 5% per participant per year in the inter-
vention phase, owing mainly to an increase in the two 
lowest risk groups. We found an increase of 1% in the 
number of days on which GPs recorded activity per 
participant per year in the intervention phase, although

We found no evidence of any difference in mortality

technical performance
A systematic review in 2014 (during this trial) of emer-
gency admission risk prediction models identified 27 
tools, of which 18 predicted emergency hospital admis-
sion within 12 months29. The models that predicted best, 
as measured by the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (the ‘c statistic’), included routine 
measures of previous healthcare use, multimorbidity 
and prescribing, as PRISM did. Using data from 51 600 
patients with both an early PRISM score and a sufficient 
control phase, we found that PRISM achieved good 
technical performance with c=0.749, comparable to 
the previous risk prediction tools. However, it generally 
under-predicted risk at higher risk levels and over-pre-
dicted risk at the lowest risk level.
health economics
Cost of implementing PRISM
We estimated that implementing PRISM cost £25 350 
(£792 per practice) in the first year: £1423 for activa-
tion; £9709 for training; £952 for annual running and 
maintenance costs; £1024 for PRISM software updates 
and £12 242 for practice staff using PRISM. We 
inferred that, without activation and initial training, 
(undiscounted) PRISM operating costs for subsequent 
years were £14 218 (£444 per practice). As we studied 
230 099 participants, these costs equate to an initial 
£0·11 per participant and £0·06 per participant per 
year thereafter.
Primary and secondary healthcare costs

£106; p<0·001) in healthcare costs over 1 year in the 
intervention phase. These differences were statisti-
cally significant across the population and within risk 
groups 1 and 2, though not risk groups 3 and 4. Similar 
statistically significant differences were apparent in 
log-transformed costs. We reported health economic 
results in detail elsewhere.19
Cost-effectiveness analysis
Though PRISM itself cost only £0·11 per participant 
in the first year, it was significantly less effective and 
significantly more costly to the NHS than usual care. 
In economic terms, the control phase dominates, so 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are not 
valid.
Cost-utility analysis
Estimated SF-6D utilities were slightly lower for the 
intervention phase (mean 0·6380) than the control 
phase (mean 0·6382). After adjusting for covari-
ates, the difference was not statistically significant 
(p=0·584). Thus, the control treatment again domi-
nates, and ICERs are not valid. We used a cost-effec-
tiveness acceptability curve and a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of £20 000 to estimate the probability of 
PRISM being cost effective as only 46%.
Budget impact of PRISM during the study
The rise in healthcare costs that followed the imple-
mentation of PRISM across the trial area increased the 
estimated budget by £7·59 million per 100 000 popu-
lation per annum (95% CI: £4·58 million to £10·60 
million).
dIscussIon
Principal findings
We found that introducing PRISM software along-
side a national policy initiative to prioritise the care 
of people at highest risk of emergency admission to 
hospital increased emergency admissions to hospitals, 
time spent in hospital and the use of other primary 
and secondary care, especially those with the highest 
risk scores. There was evidence of improved physical 
health-related quality of life, but satisfaction scores 
were lower, and there was no net gain in patient utility. 
Though the direct cost of the intervention was small, 
it increased the use and cost of NHS services. Hence, 
PRISM was inferior to routine practice. We estimate 
that PRISM increased total healthcare costs by £7·6 
million per 100 000 population per annum.
strengths and limitations
Our stepped wedge trial design allocated clusters of GP 
practices to receive PRISM software at random points 
over a year. Our evaluation linked routine data over 2 
years. Together, these novel and relatively inexpensive 
methods enabled us to conduct a powerful and rigorous 
evaluation of this population-level intervention in 
nearly a quarter of a million people. We also linked 
self-completed questionnaires for a large sample of 
patients anonymously to their routine data outcomes, 
thus evaluating quality of life and satisfaction as well as 
health service use. We recognise the dynamic context 
within which we conducted this study, with political 
and clinical changes before, during and after recruit-
ment. Fortunately, our trial design is well suited to 
such circumstances, often encountered by evaluative 
studies in healthcare.30 This design compared popula-
tions in parallel and over time, thus adjusting for back-
ground trends in service use and population ageing. 
Unfortunately, though there were plans to give prac-
tice staff greater access to multidisciplinary commu-
nity resource teams, this did not happen.
Implications for policy and practice
This research addresses a major policy concern for the 
NHS—how best to manage patients in the commu-
nity to avoid unnecessary, disruptive and costly emer-
gency admissions. The use of tools to predict the risk 
of emergency admission is widely advocated as a core 
component of models to care for long-term condi-
tions. However, there is debate about whether to 
focus on those at the highest level of risk, as these are 
few in number.31 32 Despite these concerns, targeting 
those at the highest levels of risk has become routine 
practice—in Wales through QOF measures and in 
England through the enhanced service. These policy 
initiatives assume that identifying patients at high risk 
of emergency admission will facilitate interventions to 
improve their health and reduce unplanned episodes 
of care.31 Unfortunately, our trial showed the opposite 
effect, in common with analogous but weaker studies. 
Stokes et al’s systematic review of 36 case management 
initiatives for patients at risk of hospitalisation, but not 
necessarily identified through an emergency admis-
sion risk prediction tool, found no positive effects on 
service use, but a small improvement in patient satisfac-
tion.17 A controlled before-and-after study of multidis-
ciplinary case management for high-risk patients iden-
tified by risk tools, meeting the requirements of the 
English Unscheduled Admissions Enhanced Service, 
also showed no evidence of patient benefit.32 A study 
of virtual wards—a multidisciplinary team offering 
‘hospital at home’ to patients at high risk of admis-
sion—also did not reduce emergency admissions.33
Thus our study strengthens the evidence that 
current approaches using emergency admission risk 
prediction tools to identify and support patients do 
not reduce health service use and costs. Policy makers 
should therefore consider alternative approaches. 
For example, Wallace et al concluded that alterna-
tives to case management should focus on reducing 
the length of hospital inpatient stay while preventing 
readmission.34
We hypothesise that the combination of PRISM 
and QOF incentives to focus on those at high risk of

Original research
emergency admission to hospital alerted GPs and prac-
tice staff to unmet needs and lowered their threshold 
for admitting patients to hospital. Predictive risk strati-
fication is a tool which needs effective interventions to 
avoid emergency episodes of care. Such interventions 
need explicit models of how they will work and for 
whom, and rigorous evaluation of their clinical and 
cost effectiveness, before implementation.
conclusIons
Introduction of predictive risk stratification increased 
emergency hospital admissions, use of other NHS 
services and therefore costs, at each risk level within a 
large general practice population without evidence of 
benefits to patients or the NHS.
