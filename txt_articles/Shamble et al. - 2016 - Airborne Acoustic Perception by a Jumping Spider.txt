Summary
Jumping spiders (Salticidae) are famous for their visually driven behaviors [1]. Here, however, we 
present behavioral and neurophysiological evidence that these animals also perceive and respond 
to airborne acoustic stimuli, even when the distance between the animal and the sound source is 
relatively large (~3 m) and with stimulus amplitudes at the position of the spider of ~65 dB SPL. 
Behavioral experiments with the jumping spider Phidippus audax reveal that these animals 
respond to low frequency sounds (80 Hz; 65 dB SPL) by freezing—a common anti-predatory 
behavior characteristic of an acoustic startle response. Neurophysiological recordings from 
auditory-sensitive neural units in the brains of these jumping spiders showed responses to low-
frequency tones (80 Hz at ~65 dB SPL); recordings that also represent the first record of 
acoustically-responsive neural units in the jumping spider brain. Responses persisted even when 
the distances between spider and stimulus source exceeded 3 m and under anechoic conditions. 
Thus, these spiders appear able to detect airborne sound at distances in the acoustic far-field

 region, beyond the near-field range often thought to bound acoustic perception in arthropods that 
lack tympanic ears (e.g. spiders) [2]. Further, direct mechanical stimulation of hairs on the patella 
of the foreleg was sufficient to generate responses in neural units that also responded to airborne 
acoustic stimuli—evidence that these hairs likely play a role in the detection of acoustic cues. We 
suggest that these auditory responses enable the detection of predators and facilitate an acoustic 
startle response.
eTOC blurb
Jumping spiders are renowned visual specialists. However, Shamble and Menda et al. provide 
evidence that they also respond to airborne acoustic cues. Behaviorally, stimuli caused spiders to 
freeze, while neural responses to stimuli of ~65 dB SPL persisted even at ranges of 3 m, well 
beyond what has been previously reported in similar systems.

RESULTS
Behavior
We used a reaction assay to determine whether the jumping spider P. audax responds 
behaviorally to airborne stimuli (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Responses of 
individual spiders to speaker-generated stimuli were recorded using a digital video camera 
(60 frames per second), then categorized. Airborne signals, however, can cause substrate-
borne vibrations—a phenomenon that can make it difficult to determine whether an animal 
is perceiving stimuli via the air or the substrate (see [3]). This is particularly problematic in 
spiders where sensitivity to vibrations is well documented [4–6]. We therefore used a 25 × 
25 × 2 cm metal block (14.3 kg) as the arena floor, limiting transmission of airborne sound 
energy into substrate-borne vibrations [7]. We also verified through analytical calculations 
and direct vibratory measurements that any sound-induced motion of the block fell below 
the detection thresholds of spiders (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The arena 
was surrounded by wire mesh (opening diameter = 2 mm) to contain spiders while 
minimizing acoustic reflections. The speaker was located 2 m away, and 50 cm below the 
arena and produced 2 s tones with an amplitude of 65 dB SPL (amplitude measured at arena 
center using a calibrated ¼ in. pressure microphone; Brüel & Kjær, Denmark). Each spider 
was assigned to one of three stimuli conditions: 80 Hz (n = 23), 2000 Hz (n = 22), or silent 
control (n = 10), and experienced the stimulus four times.
Spiders responded significantly more to 80 Hz tones than to 2000 Hz tones or the silent 
control (ANOVA, Tukey HSD test, p<0.0001; see Fig. 1A), and there were no significant 
differences between responses to 2000 Hz tones and the control (ANOVA, Tukey HSD test, 
p = 0.3). Within 80 Hz trials, freezing was the most common response (Fig. 1B), 
characterized by the sudden cessation of movement (Supplemental Movie S1). Freezing also 
had a significantly faster onset time (~100 ms) than other behaviors (ANOVA, Tukey HSD

 test, p < 0.01), and low onset variability, suggesting that while “freezing” was a category 
imposed by our analysis, it constituted a robust and relevant behavioral unit (Fig. 1C).
Neural responses
Recent work has described extracellular methods enabling stable recordings of neural 
activity in the jumping spider brain [8]. Here we applied these methods to probe for 
acoustically responsive neural units (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and [8] for 
details). In brief, spiders were cold anesthetized and held in place using a 3D printed spider-
holder and low-melting point dental wax, then placed inside a neurophysiological rig on a 
vibration-isolating table, surrounded by a custom-made Faraday cage and acoustic-isolating 
foam. An extracellular tungsten microelectrode (4 MΩ, MicroProbes), advanced using a 
motorized hydraulic microdrive, was guided through a small hole in the cuticle and into the 
spider’s brain. Recordings targeted the area of the CNS ventral to the arcuate body. 
Resulting neural activity was analyzed using the spike sorting program Wave_Clus [9] to 
classify individual units (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figure S1).
Acoustic stimuli were designed using Matlab, generated via a speaker, and presented in 
pseudo-random order. Distances between the sound source and the animal were 2 m, 3.0 m 
or 3.3 m, depending on the experiment. Signal pressure amplitude was monitored using a 
calibrated pressure microphone (see above and Supplemental Experimental Procedures) 
placed adjacent to the animal. We also estimated the particle velocity amplitude of stimuli 
based on stimulus signal frequency, distance between the speaker and the animal, and 
parameters of the sound source (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for 
calculations). A laser Doppler vibrometer was used to measure whether airborne acoustic 
signals caused vibrations in any portion of the experimental setup including recording 
electrodes. Vibrations induced by acoustic stimuli were detected at amplitudes of 94 dB SPL 
and above, but were absent at 89 dB SPL (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We 
therefore limited experimental stimulus amplitudes to ≤ 90 dB SPL to ensure that stimuli 
were delivered to the animal exclusively as airborne cues.
To determine whether neural units were responsive to airborne acoustic stimuli we used 0.5 s 
frequency sweeps (50 Hz to 400 Hz, linear increase, see Fig. 2B, inset), with amplitudes 
between ~45 and 80 dB SPL (speaker-to-animal distance = 2 m). Detection thresholds varied 
between neural units, from 48 to 77 dB SPL, corresponding to particle velocities estimated 
at 0.02 and 0.49 mm/s (based on 200 Hz signal) (Fig. 2B). These pressure amplitude 
thresholds are in line with other studies of airborne acoustic perception in arthropods—
including systems where receivers possess pressure-sensitive tympanic membranes [10]. 
Neural activity was also found to increase with stimulus amplitude, suggesting signal 
amplitude is represented at this level of the CNS.
To explicitly explore the relationship between stimulus amplitude and frequency we 
measured the response threshold, defined as the lowest amplitude that generated a response, 
for multiple frequencies (Fig. 2C–E). Neural units were determined to have responded to a 
given frequency-amplitude combination if neural activity (spikes per second) exceeded one 
standard deviation above the mean activity during the inter-tone intervals during half or 
more of the eight presentations. Response thresholds (Fig. 2C–E) revealed relatively sharp

 preferences for low frequencies (80 – 90 Hz), with threshold amplitudes of ~65 dB SPL. 
Some responses also showed smaller peaks roughly corresponding with multiples of the 
frequency of greatest sensitivity, suggestive of resonances in the sensory structures. Since it 
is likely that the spiders sense sound through particle velocity [11], we also provide 
estimates of the particle velocity at the spider’s location (right vertical axis, Fig. 2E). Spiders 
responded to particle velocities of ~0.13 mm/s (estimate based on 65 dB SPL, 80 Hz signal 
at 3 m; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
To verify that responses were due to the sensory capabilities of the animals, and not the 
result of potential acoustic imperfections in our laboratory setup, we repeated our 
neurophysiological experiments in an anechoic chamber (interior dimensions: 4.17 × 5.38 × 
3.45 m; base noise level < -10 dB SPL for 200 – 30 kHz; verified anechoic properties: 100 – 
30 kHz). Methods for these recordings were identical to previously described laboratory 
experiments except the animal was placed on a vibration-isolated fixture and an on-site 
speaker system was used to generate stimulus (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). 
Stimulus amplitudes were 76 – 84 dB SPL, with 3.3 m between speaker and animal. Neural 
responses matched those obtained in our other experiments (Fig. 3)—demonstrating a 
sensitivity to low frequency tones (80 – 380 Hz).
Since sensory hairs are responsible for detection of airborne stimuli in other spider species 
[6] and numerous insect species (for reviews see [11,12]), we investigated the role of hairs in 
this system. In the non-anechoic laboratory we presented pure tones between 50 – 80 dB 
SPL (2 m between source and animal). After identifying an acoustically sensitive neural unit 
we used a linearly actuated micro-shaker (Physik Instrumente GmbH & Co. KG) to 
mechanically drive a single long sensory hair on the patella of the foreleg at a range of 
amplitudes (maximum displacement = 10.8 μm). Both airborne stimuli and direct 
mechanical stimulation of the hair generated increased neural activity across multiple 
frequencies (64 – 256 Hz; Fig. 4).
Discussion
Hearing at a distance
Many arthropod species—including spiders—perceive airborne stimuli via specialized 
sensory hairs: filiform hairs in insects and trichobothria in arachnids [11]. Theoretical and 
experimental work in the spider Cupiennius (Ctenidae) has shown these hair-based 
mechanoreceptors to be astonishingly sensitive [13–15], allowing these large wandering 
spiders to capture flying prey at a range of 20 cm without any visual cues [16]. Similarly, 
sensory hairs have been shown to enable crickets [17], cockroaches [18], and fishing spiders 
(Pisauridae) [19] to escape from danger by detecting the wave of air that precedes an on-
rushing predator.
Unlike the pressure sensing tympanic ears that have evolved independently in tetrapods [20] 
and numerous insect lineages [21], sensory hairs are air-flow mechanoreceptors—sensitive 
to the particle-velocity component of airborne stimuli. Airborne sound consists of two 
coupled fields: pressure and particle-velocity, whose relationship is generally nontrivial, 
depending on frequency as well as the distance from, and shape of, the sound source [22,23].

 For arthropods that sense airborne disturbances through particle-velocity sensitive hairs, it is 
typically assumed that sound detection is only possible close to the sound source in the 
region termed “near-field,” estimated to span 0.5 – 1 sound wavelength from the source 
[2,21,22,24]. So common is this terminology that the particle-velocity component of sound 
is often referred to as “near-field sound.” However, the particle-velocity field does not 
vanish at larger distances but, rather, decays continuously even into the “far-field” region. 
Indeed, the ability to sense sound based on particle-velocity depends only on the detection 
threshold of the sensor and the particle-velocity amplitude at the sensor position. We found 
that P. audax responds to particle-velocity amplitudes of ~0.13 mm/s, an estimate based on 
observed neural responses to signals of 80 Hz and 65 dB SPL, measured 3 m from the 
source (Fig. 2; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for calculations). At this range, 
we calculate that spiders were located well within the far-field region of the sound stimuli. 
Responses persisted in the nearly ideal acoustic conditions of an anechoic chamber (Fig. 3). 
Indeed, even using the highest traditional estimate for the range of the so-called “near-field” 
sound region, 1 sound wavelength, an animal 3 m away would be unable to detect stimuli 
with wavelengths below this distance—thus, any tone above 115 Hz would be undetectable. 
That spiders, even under anechoic conditions, responded to stimuli up to 350 Hz 
(wavelength = 0.98 m), demonstrates that these traditional estimates fail to explain the 
responses of these animals.
While it is still not clear how P. audax detects airborne signals, we hypothesize that air-flow 
sensitive hairs that register particle-velocity are the most likely candidates for a number of 
reasons. First, pressure-sensitive tympanic structures have not been found in any spider, or in 
any other arachnid. Second, neural units were found that respond to both airborne signals 
and direct mechanical stimulation of single hairs, further suggesting that hair-based sensors 
are the site of transduction (Fig. 4). Indeed, previous work on the spider Cupiennius, has 
clearly demonstrated the role of air-flow sensitive hairs in facilitating responses to airborne 
stimuli [11,25,26]. It has been reported that some spider species may detect airborne stimuli 
via slit sense organs [27,28], mechanoreceptors typically thought to be important in 
detecting cuticle deformation and substrate-based vibrations [6]. However, while these 
structures exist in jumping spiders, their ability to register airborne cues has not been 
demonstrated.
Behavioral relevance of sound
Spiders exhibited a freezing behavior in response to the low-frequency (80 Hz) stimulus 
(Fig. 1). Freezing is a common reaction to threatening stimuli exhibited across a range of 
taxa, including rodents [29], fish [30], insects [31], and other arachnids [32], and is generally 
thought to minimize the chances of attracting the attention of potential predators [33]. Based 
on the observed behavior and the rapidity and consistency of its onset, the freezing behavior 
reported here bears the characteristics of an acoustic startle response [34]—a well defined 
and well studied class of behaviors that has also been reported in numerous taxa [34,35]. 
The ~100 ms delay between stimulus onset and behavior also fits well within the range of 
acoustic startle latency times reported in other species (~30 – 200 ms, [31]).

 It has been proposed that acoustic startle responses may facilitate attention altering effects, 
enabling an animal to refocus limited attentional resources [34]. This is an especially 
compelling possibility in jumping spiders, given the importance of vision in shaping their 
behaviors. Such a reaction would enable an individual, upon registering an airborne 
stimulus, to rapidly reallocate sensory and decision-making resources to best inform 
subsequent behavior. For example, spiders could become more responsive to visual cues that 
immediately follow an acoustic stimulus. Freezing also limits optical flow due to self-
motion, likely improving visual performance. All this might be particularly important in the 
context of potential threats, and for species with vagabond lifestyles such as jumping 
spiders, where the location of the threat and the subsequent route to safety may not be 
immediately apparent, instead requiring rapid and flexible decision-making.
In the context of threat detection, the observed frequency sensitivity of P. audax seems to 
make it well suited to detecting acoustic signals generated by potentially dangerous flying 
insects, especially predatory wasps (Insecta: Hymenoptera) and dipteran parasitoids (notably 
adult small-headed flies, Insecta: Diptera: Orthorrhapha: Acroceridae—although not their 
mobile larvae), many of which specialize on spiders and are a major cause of spider 
mortality [36–39]. Dominant acoustic frequencies of flying hymenopterans are ~100 Hz 
(depending on the species) with harmonics up to ~1000 Hz [40]—properties that match the 
frequency sensitivities reported here. Indeed, air-flow sensitive hairs have been shown to be 
important in detecting flying predatory wasps in other systems, though only to a maximum 
range of 70 cm [41]. The ability to detect these predators may be especially important for 
jumping spiders since (unlike sedentary web-dwelling spider species) they are diurnally 
active, moving through the environment in search of prey and potential mates—a lifestyle 
that likely increases exposure to similarly diurnal spider-predators such as wasps. Further, 
unlike their web-dwelling cousins, jumping spiders lack the built-in defensive advantages 
that accompany life on a web [38]. Thus the ability to detect the presence of threats—even 
before they become visually apparent—could provide these animals with an important 
fitness advantage.
Sensitivity to low frequencies may also enable P. audax to detect and respond to more 
general disturbances, such as the movement of leaves or breaking of twigs, that might signal 
the presence of larger threats. Such disturbances produce broadband signals [42] with 
frequencies that these spiders are sensitive to, and could be of sufficient amplitude to make 
them detectable at a distance. Although not themselves threatening, such signals could be 
important in shaping adaptive behavioral responses to dangerous circumstances.
From an ecological perspective, perception of airborne cues could benefit these spiders in 
contexts beyond threat avoidance, including prey detection and conspecific signaling. For 
example, while the frequency sensitivities observed here overlap with those generated by 
flying predatory wasps, they would also be sufficient to register the presence of other flying 
insects. Extensive work in the spider Cupiennius has demonstrated the utility of air-flow 
sensitive hairs in enabling spiders to detect and capture flying insect prey [16]. Jumping 
spiders, too, have been found capable of capturing prey in the absence of visual cues, though 
successful captures seemed to require repeated physical contact with prey, facilitated by an 
enclosed arena [43]. Since the acoustic fundamental frequency produced by a flapping insect

 is typically equal to its wingbeat frequency, and wingbeat frequency is generally inversely 
proportional to insect size [40], the frequency sensitivities reported here could make these 
spiders capable of detecting even relatively small insects in flight (e.g. fruit fly wingbeat 
frequency is roughly 200 Hz; [44])—though detection range would be limited by the low 
amplitude of such signals.
Particle-velocity cues might also mediate conspecific interactions, as has been demonstrated 
in other arachnids [45], including a possible role in courtship, as has been suggested in wolf 
spiders [46]. Many spider species, and jumping spiders in particular, have complex courtship 
displays consisting of multiple components and often multiple signaling modalities—
complexity that may be related to the simultaneous challenges of maintaining female 
attention while reducing female aggression [47]. These courtships often involve rapid leg 
movements and elaborate acoustic signals produced by specialized stridulatory structures 
[5]. While stridulatory signals have been shown to convey information via substrate-borne 
vibrations and leg waving provides visual information [5], both components could also 
generate particle-velocity based airborne signals, potentially adding another signaling 
dimension to displays. Such a role for airborne acoustic signals in courtship may even help 
explain why some spider species respond to acoustic stimuli even when placed on substrates 
that prevent vibratory signaling [7,46].
Conclusion
Although best known as visual specialists, we report that the jumping spider P. audax is 
capable of perceiving airborne acoustic cues, evidenced by both behavioral responses and 
neural activity in the CNS. Behaviorally, the freezing responses observed here constitute an 
acoustic startle response, a reaction that has been shown to have important implications for 
mediating anti-predatory behavior. Regarding signal reception, we hypothesize that air-flow 
sensitive hairs are the site of detection. Detection thresholds were in the region of 65 dB 
SPL, corresponding to an estimated particle velocity amplitude of 0.13 mm/s, with greatest 
sensitivity to relatively low frequencies (~80 Hz). Responses persisted even when the 
distance between the animal and the stimulus exceeded 3 m—well beyond the 70 cm range 
[41] that was, to our knowledge, the greatest detection distance previously reported for 
sensory systems that detect air flow [11]. These findings bring into question the distinction 
commonly made by biologists between “near-field” and “far-field” sound, demonstrating 
that these animals—believed only able to detect particle-velocity—respond to airborne 
stimuli even at “far-field” distances.

 Figure 1. Result of behavioral experiments showing responses of individual Phiddipus audax 
jumping spiders to speaker-generated tones (65 dB SPL)
Spiders were allowed to move about a 25 × 25 cm arena, with responses to tones recorded 
using a digital video camera (60 frames per second). These recordings were used to 
categorize behavioral responses and to determine the onset times of observed behaviors. 
Individual spiders were randomly assigned to a silent control (nspiders = 10), 80 Hz (nspiders = 
23), or 2000 Hz (nspiders = 22) condition, and experienced that treatment four times. A dense 
metal block was used as the arena floor to limit potential for air-to-substrate acoustic 
transmission (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). (A) Spiders in the 80 Hz 
treatment responded significantly more than spiders in the other conditions (ANOVA, Tukey 
HSD test, p < 0.0001), and there was no significant difference between responses in the 
control and 2000 Hz treatments (ANOVA, Tukey HSD test, p = 0.3). Values plotted are 
mean and one standard deviation (s.d.), where each data point represents the response 
frequency of a given spider. (B) A breakdown of the types of behavior observed by category 
in response to the 80 Hz condition. (C) The time elapsed between stimulus onset and the 
observed behavior for responses to the 80 Hz tone. The onset of freezing responses was 
significantly more rapid than for other behavior types (ANOVA, Tukey HSD test, p < 0.01). 
Bar heights represent the mean, error bars show one s.d. See also Figure S4 and Movie S1.

 Figure 2. Results of extracellular neurophysiological recordings made from the brain of the 
jumping spider P. audax in response to speaker-generated airborne stimuli
(A) An example trace showing neural activity (left) with stimulus presence indicated by grey 
boxes and an overlay (right) of all similarly identified spikes following spike sorting [9]; 
black center line shows the mean, thin lines denote ± one standard deviation (s.d.). (B) The 
responses of four independent neural units to a linear frequency sweep signal depicted in 
inset (50 – 400 Hz; 500 ms duration) at a range of stimulus amplitudes presented in pseudo-
randomized order. Black markers indicate responses that were significantly greater than 
background (increased activity during stimuli compared to the post-stimulus interval, repeats 
per amplitude n = 40, t-test, p < 0.05). Grey markers show responses that were not 
significantly greater than background; vertical bars show ± one s.d. Stimulus amplitude was 
measured at the location of the animal, distance between stimulus source and animal was 2 
m; estimated particle velocities are for a 200 Hz signal. (C) Example components of a 
tuning curve experiments, specifically response of a neural unit to 80 Hz tones. From top: 
amplitude spectrum of recorded stimulus tone, stimulus as recorded at microphone, voltage 
trace of extracellular recording (dashed line shows stimulus onset), and a summary of neural 
responses for each amplitude condition showing mean as circles and ± one s.d. as vertical 
bars (repeats per amplitude, n = 8). Thick horizontal dashed line shows mean background 
firing rate, calculated as spikes per second during inter-tone interval. Thin dashed line shows 
one s.d. above mean background activity. Filled circles denote conditions where neural 
activity exceeded one s.d. above the mean for a majority of presentations of a given 
frequency-amplitude combination. Color matches associated neural unit in (D, top right). 
(D) Tuning curve responses for 12 independent neural units; six on left (blue) from one 
spider, those at right (red) from a second animal. Note the inverted dB y-axis such that peaks 
in the figure show the highest sensitivity. To generate curves, every combination of 
frequency (50 – 250 Hz, at 10 Hz intervals) and amplitude (~50 – 90 dB SPL, at intervals of

 5 dB SPL) was presented eight times in pseudorandom order (tone duration = 0.6 s; inter-
tone interval = 0.6 s). Lines mark the minimum stimulus amplitude for which activity during 
at least four out of eight trial exceeded one s.d. above mean background activity. Colored 
areas therefore show all amplitudes that were detectable. (E) An overlay of all curves 
presented in (D). Colored circles denote the frequency of greatest sensitivity for each unit. 
For experiments shown in (C–E), there was 3 m between the stimulus source and the spider; 
estimated particle velocity measures are based on an 80 Hz signal. See also Figures S1, S2, 
and S3.

 Figure 3. Extracellular activity in the brain of the jumping spider P. audax in response to pure 
tone airborne acoustic stimuli under anechoic conditions
Frequencies, including a silent control, were presented in pseudo-random order. (A) A trace 
(left) showing extracellular activity in response to a 84 dB SPL signal and (right) an overlay 
of spikes determined to represent a single neural unit based on spike sorting with the black 
center line showing the mean, thin lines ± one standard deviation. (B) Response of the unit 
shown in (A) to specific pure tone frequencies (repeats per frequency, n = 30). Star indicates 
responses that were significantly greater than the response to the silent control condition 
(Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Dark lines represent the median, grey 
boxes extend to the 25th and 75th percentiles and whiskers extend to cover 99 percent of a 
normal distribution. Dashed line shows median activity for control condition. (C) Schematic 
depicting the responses of six independent neural units in a spider to pure tones, and for 
stated stimulus amplitudes. Independence of units was based on spike sorting [11] and 
electrode location (see Figure S1). Filled boxes indicate conditions in which neural activity 
was significantly elevated compared to the silent control (Kruskal-Wallis, p < 0.05 after 
Bonferroni correction), white boxes indicate no significant difference. The distance between 
stimulus and the animal was 3.3 m; estimated particle velocity is based on an 80 Hz signal.

 Figure 4. Activity of neural units in the brain of the jumping spider P. audax in response to 
airborne acoustic stimuli and to direct mechanical stimulation of a medium-flow sensitive hair 
on the patella of the foreleg
Airborne stimuli were generated using a speaker, while hairs were driven using a linearly 
actuated piezo micro-shaker. Neural activity was recorded in response to pure frequency 
tones (0.5 s duration), presented in pseudo-random order within each stimulus type (airborne 
or mechanical stimulation of the hair). The amplitude of airborne acoustic stimuli was 
between 50 – 80 dB SPL, and the distance between the stimulus source and the animal was 2 
m. The amplitude of the direct mechanical stimuli also varied, up to a maximum amplitude 
of 10.8 μm (peak-to-trough). Activation of the microshaker when near (within ~1 cm), but 
not in contact with the hair resulted in no increased neural activity. (A) Examples from 
extracellular recordings of two independently recorded neural units in response to the 
indicated frequency tone of both stimulus types. Rasters show spike times and line 
histograms (smoothed with a Gaussian filter, s.d. = 36 ms) show a summary of all 30 tone 
presentations for each stimulus set. The grey bar denotes the 500 ms time interval when the 
stimulus was present. (B) Summary of responses to direct mechanical stimulation of a hair 
(top) and airborne stimulation (bottom) for two distinct neural units. Black boxes indicate 
responses in which neural activity (spikes/sec) was significantly greater in response to the 
stimulus than activity during the post-stimulus interval (time window for stimulus response 
= 0.7 s to capture potential post-stimulus effect; post-stimulus window = 1.3 s; each tone 
repeated 30 times, t-test, p < 0.05); white boxes indicate no significant response. Note that 
because stimuli were delivered at a range of amplitudes, these findings do not represent a 
true response tuning curve (e.g. in contrast to Fig. 2E; see Supplemental Experimental 
Procedures for details); instead, these results simply provide evidence that single neural
