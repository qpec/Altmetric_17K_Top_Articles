The human brain contains multiple hand-selective areas, in both the sensorimotor and visual systems. Could our brain repurpose
neural resources, originally developed for supporting hand function, to represent and control artificial limbs? We studied individ-
uals with congenital or acquired hand-loss (hereafter one-handers) using functional MRI. We show that the more one-handers use
an artificial limb (prosthesis) in their everyday life, the stronger visual hand-selective areas in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex
respond to prosthesis images. This was found even when one-handers were presented with images of active prostheses that share
the functionality of the hand but not necessarily its visual features (e.g. a ‘hook’ prosthesis). Further, we show that daily prosthesis
usage determines large-scale inter-network communication across hand-selective areas. This was demonstrated by increased resting
state functional connectivity between visual and sensorimotor hand-selective areas, proportional to the intensiveness of everyday
prosthesis usage. Further analysis revealed a 3-fold coupling between prosthesis activity, visuomotor connectivity and usage,
suggesting a possible role for the motor system in shaping use-dependent representation in visual hand-selective areas, and/or
vice versa. Moreover, able-bodied control participants who routinely observe prosthesis usage (albeit less intensively than the
prosthesis users) showed significantly weaker associations between degree of prosthesis observation and visual cortex activity or
connectivity. Together, our findings suggest that altered daily motor behaviour facilitates prosthesis-related visual processing and
shapes communication across hand-selective areas. This neurophysiological substrate for prosthesis embodiment may inspire re-
habilitation approaches to improve usage of existing substitutionary devices and aid implementation of future assistive and aug-
mentative technologies.

 Introduction
Our hands are the primary tool of the brain, and the loss of
a hand leads to profound changes in individuals’ abilities to
interact with their environment (Makin et al., 2013a;
Hahamy et al., 2017). Since brain organization is thought
to be shaped by experience (Ejaz et al., 2015), real-life
constraints on behaviour, such as hand loss, should provide
a powerful driver for brain reorganization (Pons et al.,
1991; Flor et al., 2006; Makin et al., 2015). It has recently
been suggested that the profound reorganization observed
following
hand
loss
possibly
occurs
to
accommodate
changes in individuals’ abilities to interact with their envir-
onment in daily life (Makin et al., 2013a; Hahamy et al.,
2015, 2017). Specifically, it has been suggested that the
territory of the missing limb could be reappropriated to
support the representation of other body parts that substi-
tute the missing hand function as a compensatory strategy.
A key strategy for adapting to hand loss is using an artifi-
cial limb (hereafter ‘prosthesis’). Prosthesis usage strongly
depends on both motor control and visual information,
particularly considering the limited somatosensory inputs
from the artificial limb.
It is well established that within the primary somatosensory
and motor cortex (SI/M1, respectively) specific areas show
strong selectivity for inputs and outputs relating to the
hand (Penfield and Rasmussen, 1950; Kaas et al., 1979). It
has been demonstrated that similar hand-selectivity also exists
in the visual system. Specifically, areas in the lateral occipito-
temporal cortex show visual selectivity for upper limbs com-
pared to other body parts (Orlov et al., 2010) or object
categories (Bracci et al., 2010, 2012). The functional relation-
ship between hand representations in the sensorimotor and
visual systems is still unknown (Tal et al., 2016). In recent
years, evidence has been accumulating to demonstrate that
visual hand-selective areas are involved in action perception
and cognition (Gallivan and Culham, 2015; Lingnau and
Downing, 2015; Downing and Peelen, 2016). However, it
is still unclear to what extent representation in this area is
informed by personal daily-life motor experience.
Here we examined individuals with hand-loss to deter-
mine how alternative motor strategies through prosthesis
usage affect functioning of—and coupling between—visual
and sensorimotor hand-selective areas. Participants (here-
after ‘one-handers’; Table 1) with either unilateral acquired
arm amputation (n = 16) or unilateral congenital maldevel-
opment of the hand (n = 16) with varying degrees of pros-
thesis usage underwent a functional MRI session. The
functional MRI session comprised task-based scans in
which the participants viewed images of different categories
(e.g. upper limbs, prosthetic arms) and a resting state scan.
We hypothesized that reappropriation of hand-selective
cortical resources depends on successful implementation
of the prosthesis in daily life to substitute the missing
hand’s function. Therefore, we predicted that more fre-
quent habitual prosthesis usage (which strongly depends
on visual feedback; Antfolk et al., 2013) would increase
processing for prostheses in typically hand-selective visual
areas and increase cross-talk between visual and sensori-
motor hand-selective areas. To investigate the role of
visual
experience
further,
we
presented
participants
with images of both the prosthesis belonging to them
(i.e. highly familiar), and images of a prosthesis exemplar
belonging to another one-hander, unfamiliar to the obser-
ver. This allowed us to determine whether the representa-
tion of prosthetic limbs depends on specific experience, or
rather more general categorical representation. Finally, we
tested 24 able-bodied controls with varying degrees of pas-
sive visual exposure to prosthesis usage (Supplementary
Table 1). We predicted that the degree to which individuals
are passively exposed to prostheses usage should not scale
with functioning of—and coupling between—visual and
sensorimotor hand-selective areas.
Upper limb prosthetic limbs are broadly classified in two
subcategories: active prostheses (affording adjustment of
grip), and passive cosmetic prostheses. Active prostheses
include: (i) mechanical prostheses, typically having little
visual similarity to a hand and operated via the opposite
shoulder to adjust grip size; and (ii) myoelectric prostheses,
affording adjustment of grip based on ipsilateral arm-mus-
cles while also having a visual appearance resembling a
hand. Passive prostheses (hereafter ‘cosmetic’) are typically
designed to resemble in visual appearance the human hand
and arm but are not operational. Nevertheless, it is import-
ant to emphasize that passive prostheses can greatly en-
hance daily lives functionality, and are in fact preferred
by the majority of amputees for daily functioning (Jang
et al., 2011; Østlie et al., 2012, see also Table 1). We
therefore tested our predictions considering both active
and cosmetic prosthesis types.
Materials and methods
Participants
Thirty-two individuals with a missing hand [one-handers,
mean age 42.3 years, standard deviation (SD) = 11.8, 12 fe-
males, eight missing their right hand] were recruited to take
part in the study (Table 1). Sixteen one-handers lost their hand
because of amputation (mean years since amputation: 16.7),
and 16 had congenital unilateral hand absence (amelia). In
addition, 24 age- and gender-matched two-handed controls
(mean age 41.7 years, SD = 13.1; 12 female; eight left-
handed) took part in the study (Supplementary Table 1).
Recruitment was primarily carried out through Opcare (con-
tracting prosthetic providers for National Health Services, UK)
in accordance with Oxford University’s Medical Sciences
inter-divisional research ethics committee (Ref: MSD-IDREC-
C2-2014-003). Informed consent and consent to publish was
obtained in accordance with ethical standards set out by the
Declaration of Helsinki. One additional one-hander was re-
cruited to the study but did not participate in the scanning
session because of claustrophobia. Two control participants

 did not complete the motor functional MRI task because of
time constraints. Another one-hander was excluded from data
analysis because of poor quality of neuroimaging data.
Experimental procedures
Participants took part in a single experimental session, involving
questionnaires, behavioural tasks [as reported in Hahamy et al.
(2017) and van den Heiligenberg et al. (2017); see osf.io/kd2yh
for the full study protocol] and an MRI session. Questionnaires
included demographic and clinical details (as summarized in
Table 1), phantom sensations and pain (as described in Makin
et al., 2013b), and prosthesis usage (as described below).
Experience with prosthetic limbs
Prosthesis usage habits
Prosthesis usage habits in one-handers are summarized in
Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2. Of the 32 one-handers,
two were not prosthesis owners and another three did not use
their prosthesis currently. Of the remaining 27, 17 one-handers
regularly used an active prosthesis, either body powered
(mechanical; n = 11) or powered via electrical muscle signal
(myoelectric; n = 4) or both (n = 2). Seventeen one-handers
regularly used a cosmetic prosthesis (of which seven were
also active prosthesis users, whereas the other 10 used a cos-
metic prosthesis exclusively).
Usage measurements in one-handers
Daily prosthesis usage was assessed using a revised version of
the Motor Activity Log (MAL) as described and validated by
Makin et al. (2013a) and Hahamy et al. (2017). In brief, par-
ticipants rated how frequently they use their prosthesis in an
inventory of 27 daily activities, requiring varying degrees of
motor control (e.g. taking money out of wallet; zipping up a
coat; peeling fruit skin etc.). As this inventory was not exhaust-
ive, and it is possible that participants wear the prosthesis for
other purposes than stated in the inventory (e.g. for cosmetic

 purposes), participants additionally rated how much time they
typically spend wearing their prostheses in their daily lives.
Individuals’ MAL scores and wear time for the different
types of prostheses are detailed in Table 1. Participants pri-
marily using cosmetic (n = 14) and active (n = 13) prostheses
similarly use their prosthesis in daily tasks, as reflected in both
MAL scores [average � standard error of the mean (SEM) cos-
metic = 0.25 � 0.06;
active = 0.19 � 0.06;

difference
t(25) = 0.67, P = 0.51] and usage time (average � SEM cos-
metic = 3.5 � 0.45;
active = 3.23 � 0.38;
group
difference
Mann-Whitney U-test = 84.5, P = 0.77).
Both the MAL and maximum wear-time ratings were stan-
dardized using a Z-transform and summed to create a usage
score that included both wear time and incorporation of the
prosthesis in day-to-day activities, as previously implemented
(van den Heiligenberg et al., 2017). Note that the two vari-
ables composing the usage score highly correlated with each
other [n = 32, r(30) = 0.84; P 5 0.001].
Passive visual exposure to prosthesis usage in control
participants
Fourteen of the control participants were family members or
friends of prosthesis-using one-handers, or had professional
relationships with prosthesis users. We asked each control par-
ticipant to rate how frequently they observed artificial limbs
being used for daily purposes, using the same procedures as
described above. This involved both prosthesis observation log
(POL) of the inventory of daily activities included in the MAL,
and prosthesis observation time (analogous to wear time).
Visual experience was quantified using the same approach im-
plemented for active prosthesis usage, as detailed above. Three
of the control participants did not complete the questionnaires
and were therefore discarded from this analysis. The remaining
21 control participants showed a diverse range of visual ex-
perience of prosthesis usage (Supplementary Table 1).
Experimental design: functional MRI
tasks
Visual task
Visual stimuli consisted of photographs from the following five
categories (Fig. 2A and B): (I) upper limbs; (II) man-made ob-
jects; (III) participants’ ‘own’ prosthesis; (IV) unfamiliar cos-
metic prostheses; and (V) unfamiliar active prostheses. Four
other categories, not relevant for the purpose of the present
study, were also presented during functional MRI scans but
are not reported here (see osf.io/kd2yh for full details).
Images of (I) upper limbs (with and without the arm, from
both first and third person perspectives); and (II) man-made
objects, which are typically non-manipulable, were taken from
an online database. To generate stimuli for the prosthesis con-
ditions III–V, one-handers were asked to bring their prostheses
to the study with them. Pictures of each participants’ prosthe-
sis were taken by the experimenters prior to the functional
MRI session from different angles (both first and third
person perspectives). In the (III) ‘own’ prosthesis condition,
all one-handers who had brought their prosthesis to the
study were presented with images of their own prostheses,
either cosmetic or active (n = 26, see Supplementary Table 2).
For individuals using several prostheses, we used the prosthesis
worn more often. All other participants (i.e. the remaining six
one-handers who did not bring a prosthesis and all control
participants) were shown instead pictures of their own shoe.
This was done to fill gaps in the experimental time course.
Shoes were selected as a familiar external object that was in-
tended to exert similar cognitive effects (e.g. in terms of arou-
sal) as the prosthesis, and therefore minimize differences in the
scan time course across groups. Consequently, the shoe condi-
tion was not included in further analysis.
Images of cosmetic and active prostheses (taken from the
one-handers prostheses image pool) were shown to all the
study participants in the remaining (IV) and (V) conditions,
respectively. This time, however, participants with a prosthesis
were presented with images of another person’s prosthesis (i.e.
not their own). Note that the subset of myoelectric prosthesis
users (Supplementary Table 2) were shown another myoelec-
tric prosthesis. For both upper-limb and prosthesis images, the
hand/prostheses were matched to the one-handers’ missing-
hand side and the non-dominant hand in controls (e.g. partici-
pants missing their left hand were presented with ‘left-handed’
hands/prostheses).
Visual stimuli had their background removed, normalized for
size, placed on an equi-luminant grey background and overlaid
with a fixation point. The experiment included four separate
runs. In each of the runs, each visual condition comprised nine
trials (i.e. nine condition repetitions). In each such trial a single
image was shown for 1.5s, followed by 2.5s of fixation. Eight
different exemplars of a particular image category were used in
these nine trials: seven images were presented only once while
one image was shown twice in succession. Participants were
required to detect these repetitions and report them with a
button press (one-back recognition task). This design resulted in
36 repetitions of the same condition across all runs (nine
trials � four runs). The run order was varied across participants.
First-order counterbalancing of the image sequences was per-
formed using Optseq (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/optseq),
which returns the most optimal image presentation schedule.
The specifics of this design were validated against an event-related
design with a jittered interstimulus interval and a block design
during piloting (n = 4). Visual stimuli were presented on a screen
located at the rear end of the scanner bore and were viewed
through a mirror mounted on the head coil. Stimulus presenta-
tion
was
controlled
by
a
Macbook-Pro
running
the
Psychophysics Toolbox in Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick,
MA).
Motor localizer
To localize the sensorimotor hand-selective area, participants
were visually instructed to move their intact hand (dominant
hand in controls) or feet (bilateral toe movements). Other
body-part conditions, not relevant for the purpose of the pre-
sent study, were also included in the scan but not reported
here (see Hahamy et al., 2017 and osf.io/kd2yh for full de-
tails). The protocol consisted of alternating 12-s periods of
movement and rest. Each of the conditions was repeated
four times in a quasi-counterbalanced order. Participants
received training before the scan on the degree and form of
the movements prior to the scanning session.
Resting state scan
During the resting state functional MRI scan, participants were
instructed to keep their eyes open, look at a central fixation
cross displayed on the screen, and let their mind wander.

 Data acquisition
All data were acquired using a 3T Verio scanner (Siemens) with a
32-channel head coil. Anatomical data were acquired using a
T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient
echo
sequence
(MPRAGE)
with
the
parameters:
repetition
time = 2040ms;
echo
time = 4.7ms;
flip
angle = 8�,
voxel
size = 1mm isotropic resolution. Blood oxygenation level-depend-
ent (BOLD) functional MRI during the resting state and visual
task was acquired using a multiband-6 sequence (Ug
˘urbil et al.,
2013) with the parameters: voxel size = 2mm isotropic, repetition
time = 1300ms; echo time = 40ms; flip angle = 66�. Seventy-two
slices with 2mm thickness and no slice gap were acquired in the
oblique axial plane, covering the whole cortex and most of the
cerebellum. Two hundred and fifty-six volumes in each of the
visual runs and 230 volumes in the resting state scan were
acquired. Additional dummy volumes were acquired before the
start of each scan to achieve equilibrium. The first dummy volume
was saved and later used as a reference for co-registration.
During the motor task, BOLD functional MRI was acquired
using a multiple gradient echo-planar T2*-weighted pulse se-
quence, with the parameters: voxel size = 3 mm isotropic, repe-
tition

Additional dummy volumes were acquired before the start of
the scan.
Neuroimaging data processing and
low-level analysis
All imaging data were processed using FMRIB’s Expert
Analysis Tool (FEAT; version 6.0) of FMRIB’s Software
Library (FSL; version 5.0). Subsequent analyses were per-
formed using Matlab (version 7.11, The Mathworks Inc,
Natick, MA).
Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were applied to each par-
ticipant’s task data: motion correction using FMRIB’s Linear
Image Registration Tool (MCFLIRT; Jenkinson et al., 2002),
B0-unwarping, brain extraction using BET (Smith, 2002),
high-pass temporal filtering of frequencies below a cycle of
100 s and 130 s for visual and resting scans, respectively,
grand-mean intensity normalization of the entire functional
run by a single multiplicative factor, and spatial smoothing
using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half-maximum
of 3 mm for visual and resting scans and 5 mm for motor
scans. Functional images were aligned to structural images ini-
tially using FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT;
Jenkinson and Smith, 2001; Jenkinson et al., 2002) and then
optimized
using
Boundary-Based
Registration
(Greve
and
Fischl, 2009). Structural images were transformed into MNI
space using FMRIB’s Nonlinear Image Registration Tool
(FNIRT).
Individual level statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using FMRIB’s Improved
Linear Model (FILM). We applied a general linear model
(GLM), as implemented in FEAT, to each functional run, as
detailed below.
Task-based scans
Each of the experimental conditions was modelled separately
against rest (fixation). Regressors were created by convolving
stimulus presentation with a double-gamma haemodynamic re-
sponse function (HRF). For each run, six head motion param-
eters were included as regressors of no interest. In case of large
movement between volumes (41 mm) additional regressors of
no interest were included in the GLM to account for each of
these instances individually. Contrasts for the conditions of
interest were defined either against a control condition (ob-
jects, to control for interindividual variations in visual activity;
or feet, to control for motor task demands which are not hand
specific, for the visual and motor task, respectively) or against
the baseline. For the visual task, second-level analyses were
conducted on each participant’s four experimental runs using
a fixed-effects analysis.
Resting state scan
To account for non-neuronal noise that might bias functional
connectivity analyses (Behzadi et al., 2007; Whitfield-Gabrieli
and Nieto-Castanon, 2012), we extracted the BOLD time
series underlying white matter and CSF in the resting state
scans. For this purpose, the T1-weighted structural scans
were segmented into grey matter, white matter, and CSF,
using the segmentation algorithm available in the SPM12 soft-
ware package. The white matter maps were restricted by the
white matter standard mask from the Harvard-Oxford atlas
and thresholded to select 30 000 voxels with the highest inten-
sity values. The resulting maps were eroded by one voxel in
each direction to minimize partial voluming with grey matter.
This yielded white matter maps that contained 16 105� 68
voxels. CSF maps were created by thresholding the individual
CSF maps to select the 2000 voxels with the lowest intensity.
No erosion was applied.
For white matter and CSF maps, the first five eigenvectors
were calculated using the preprocessed resting state time series,
as they best characterize the majority of observed signal vari-
ation across a set of voxels within a region (Behzadi et al.,
2007;
Whitfield-Gabrieli
and
Nieto-Castanon,
2012).
Additionally,
we
extracted
time
series
representing
head
motion throughout the scan in six directions. The 16 regres-
sors of no interest were regressed out from the preprocessed
resting state time series. The resulting time series (residuals)
were z-transformed and subsequently used in region of inter-
est-based connectivity analyses (see below).
Regions of interest
Since the focus of the study was on hand-selective areas, our
main analysis was restricted to the individualized regions of
interest.
Visual regions of interest
Bilateral visual hand-selective regions of interest were selected
in lateral occipito-temporal cortex using the contrast hands
versus objects (Fig. 1A). Note that visual hand representation
is unchanged by hand loss (Striem-Amit et al., 2017). For each
participant, the 250 most hand-selective voxels were selected in
each hemisphere (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for group probabil-
istic maps). Only voxels with a Z-score 4 2 were included.

 middle temporal, inferior temporal, fusiform and parahippo-
campal gyri, as well as the lateral occipital cortex and occipito-
temporal cortex (all bilateral), as defined by Harvard-Oxford
atlas (Desikan et al., 2006). Contrary to the motor hand rep-
resentation, there is no clear laterality of visual hand represen-
tation in the occipitotemporal cortex (Shmuelof et al., 2006).
Voxels from both hemispheres were therefore combined in a
single region of interest for use in subsequent analyses. We
confirmed this by splitting the regions of interest across the
hemispheres
and
performing
the
same
analyses
outlined
below, in which we found no significant differences between
the hemispheres.
Motor regions of interest
The putative sensorimotor missing-hand territory (or controls’
non-dominant hand territory) was identified in S1/M1 by
mirror-projecting the intact hand region of interest (or con-
trols’ dominant hand) across the mid-sagittal plane (Fig. 1A).
To delineate the intact/dominant hand regions of interest, we
used the contrast of intact or dominant hand (in one-handers
or controls, respectively) versus feet movements. For each par-
ticipant, the 200 most active voxels (with a Z-score 4 2) were
selected during intact/dominant hand movements in the contra-
lateral sensorimotor cortex. For the two control participants
who did not complete the motor functional MRI task, sensori-
motor hand regions of interest were defined based on the cor-
responding group statistical maps, while taking into account
participants’ hand-dominance. Voxel selection was restricted
by the precentral and postcentral gyri, as defined by the
Harvard-Oxford atlas.
To validate this flipping procedure, we repeated the analysis
described in Hahamy et al. (2017). Specifically, we created a
new region of interest for the non-dominant hand in each of
our controls who completed the motor localizer scan (n = 22).
We generated this region of interest by selecting the 200 most
active voxels in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex during
non-dominant hand movements (versus feet movements), as
described above. We then extracted the activation level, i.e.
contrasts of parameter estimates (COPEs) for non-dominant
hand
movement
under
both
the
dominant-hand
flipped
region of interest and the non-dominant hand unflipped
region of interest. The correlation coefficient across control
participants
between
both
regions
of
interest
was
high
[r(20) = 0.82, P 5 0.001] suggesting that the flipped region of
interest captured most of the interindividual variance of the
relevant representation.
Region of interest analysis
Region of interest analysis of visual experiment
The mean COPEs across voxels were extracted for each con-
dition of interest (own/cosmetic/active prostheses) and control
condition (objects) versus baseline. For the analysis of unfamil-
iar (others’) prostheses shown in Fig. 2E, we only included
one-handers who regularly use cosmetic or active prostheses
(n = 26, see Supplementary Table 2 for full details). To account
for differences in non-category-specific visual activity, as well
as other sources of variance across participants of no interest,
we regressed out object activity from prostheses activity (Van
Breukelen, 2006). We performed a semi-partial (hereafter
‘part’) Pearson correlation between activity values for each
condition of interest and prosthesis usage (or visual exposure
to prosthesis usage in controls). For the unfamiliar (others’)
conditions we included all amputees eligible for analysis
(n = 31; Supplementary Table 2), including the few individuals
who do not use a prosthesis, allowing us to best assess usage-
related variance. For the ‘own’ condition we could only in-
clude the participants who brought their own prosthesis to
the study (n = 25, Supplementary Table 2). Note that object
activity didn’t correlate with prosthesis usage [r(23) = �0.11
and
r(29) = 0.04
for
‘own’
and
‘unfamiliar’
conditions,
respectively].
Region of interest analysis of resting state data
The purpose of this analysis was to determine intrinsic func-
tional connectivity between visual hand selective areas and the
missing-hand sensorimotor cortex. We focused on the missing
hand sensorimotor cortex because the prosthesis is designed to
substitute the missing hand’s motor function. However, given
Figure 1 Stronger connectivity between hand-selective
areas in the visual and sensorimotor systems relates to
greater prosthesis usage. (A) Individualized regions of interest in
an example participant. Hand-selective voxels were identified in
lateral occipitotemporal cortex bilaterally by contrasting responses
to hand versus object images (green) or in SI/M1 unilaterally by
contrasting intact-hand (or dominant hand in controls) versus feet
movements (white). The putative sensorimotor missing-hand area
was estimated (hatched white) by mirror projecting the intact
hand region of interest across hemispheres. CS = central sulcus;
R/L = right/left hemispheres; STS = superior temporal sulcus.
(B) Visuo-motor functional connectivity (between bilateral lateral
occipitotemporal cortex and missing-hand SI/M1): correlations with
prosthesis usage in one-handers. Visuomotor connectivity with the
intact hand sensorimotor region of interest was regressed out of
the missing hand visuo-motor measure. Scatter diagram is fitted

connectivity with prosthesis usage (C) and observance (D) in one-
handers and controls, respectively. Permutation tests of the null
distributions (black) show that the correlation between visuo-
motor connectivity and prosthesis usage (red) is significantly greater
in one-handers than chance, but not in controls.

 the known shared resting state variance across the two hand
areas (Biswal et al., 1995), we needed to account for any
visuomotor connectivity that is shared between the two sen-
sorimotor hand areas. For this purpose, the mean time series
were extracted from the sensorimotor intact/dominant and
missing/non-dominant hand regions of interest independently
(in one-handers/controls, respectively). Next, we calculated the
Pearson’s bivariate correlation between the time series of each
of the two sensorimotor hand regions of interest and the mean
time series of bilateral visual hand regions of interest. The
correlation coefficients, after applying a Fisher’s Z-transform,
represented the coupling between sensorimotor and visual
areas in each participant. To assess the relationship between
prosthesis usage (or visual exposure to prosthesis usage) and
functional connectivity, we calculated the part correlation be-
tween prosthesis usage and missing hand sensorimotor-to-
visual connectivity, while accounting for intact-hand sensori-
motor-to-visual connectivity. This was done to ensure that the
visuomotor
connectivity
we
are
measuring
expresses
the
unique contribution of the missing hand sensorimotor cortex.
For this purpose, we first adjusted the visuomotor connectivity
strength between the S1/M1 missing hand region of interest
with the bilateral visual region of interest, based on visuo-
motor connectivity with the intact hand region of interest.
We then correlated the residual values of missing hand visuo-
motor connectivity with prosthesis usage. Note that visuo-
motor connectivity with the intact hand region of interest

not
significantly)

 prosthesis usage [r(29) = �0.18]. This suggests that visuomotor
connectivity described below may also be influenced by pros-
thesis disuse (resulting in increased reliance on the intact hand,
and increased visuomotor connectivity with the intact-hand
region of interest).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was calculated using SPSS (version 16.0, SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL) and Matlab (version 7.11, The Mathworks
Inc, Natick, MA). After verifying normality (Shapiro-Wilks test),
we used ANOVA and two-tailed Student’s t-tests to compare
between groups and subgroups (or Mann-Whitney U-test, if the
assumption of normality was violated). To determine whether
the distribution of passive observation and prosthesis usage is
overlapping, an independent-samples Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
was applied. To examine relationship between brain measure-
ments and prosthesis usage we ran permutation tests. To gen-
erate a chance distribution, the usage/visual experience scores
were permuted 10000 times, and a part Pearson correlation
was repeated. We then assessed the significance of the true cor-
relation coefficient, by calculating the two-sided P-values in the
generated chance distributions (Figs 1C, D and 3B, E and G).
To compare between two correlation coefficients, we used the
Fisher’s r to Z test.
To examine joint versus unique relations between prosthesis
usage, prosthesis activity and visuomotor connectivity, we per-
formed a hierarchical linear regression analysis—a comparison
of nested regression models. The dependent variable was visual
activity to (unfamiliar) active prostheses (after accounting for
object-related activity using part correlation, as described
above). We used this active prosthesis condition because the
active prosthesis least resembles a natural hand. Independent
variables were prosthesis usage and resting state functional
connectivity between the sensorimotor missing hand region
of interest and the bilateral visual regions of interest (after
accounting
for
intact
hand
visuomotor
connectivity,
as
described above). A series of linear regression analyses was
performed. By comparing the explained variance of a model
containing both usage and connectivity (‘full model’) with re-
gression models containing these variables as separate pre-
dictors
(‘reduced
models’),
we
assessed
the
unique
and
shared variance explained by these predictors.
Finally, to determine whether the correlations with prosthe-
sis usage were affected by (i) primary prosthesis type for daily
usage (active, cosmetic); and (ii) developmental period of hand-
loss (congenital, adulthood), the main correlation analyses
were repeated as above but with subgroup affiliation as a
covariate. For this purpose, we carried out a one-way analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) on activity/connectivity values (after
applying part correlation to account for objects activity/intact
hand connectivity, as described above), with prosthesis usage
as a main factor, and subgroup as a covariate, in separate
analyses.
Group level analysis of task-based data
To further confirm and extend our main region of interest
results and to determine whether the reported effects were spe-
cific to lateral occipitotemporal cortex, we also carried out
whole-brain analyses (note, however, that such analysis is
not appropriate for regions showing strong lateralization
with respect to the amputation side). Whole-brain activity
maps across all participants [for hands versus objects and un-
familiar (other’s) active prostheses versus objects, Fig. 2C and
D] were calculated using FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed
Effects (FLAME1). We also estimated voxel-wise correspond-
ence between prosthesis usage and activity (versus baseline) in
each of the three prosthesis conditions in one-handers, after
partialling out voxel-wise activity in response to objects (versus
baseline). As in the region of interest-based analysis, we only
used one-handers eligible for functional MRI analysis (n = 31).
One-handers
who
brought
their
prosthesis
to
the
study
(n = 25) were included in the ‘own’ prosthesis correlation ana-
lysis. Z-statistic images were minimally thresholded (Z 4 2.3)
and adjusted for multiple comparisons using whole-brain
family-wise error (Gaussian Random Field) cluster size correc-
tion, and a corrected cluster significance threshold of P 5 0.05.
For visualization purposes activation maps were projected
onto an inflated cortex using FreeSurfer (Dale et al., 1999;
Reuter et al., 2012) and Workbench (Van Essen et al., 2013).
Results
We first searched for group differences in visual hand-se-
lective regions when participants were shown images of
other
people’s
prosthesis
images
(active
or
cosmetic,
Fig. 2A and B). Across all participants, unfamiliar active
prosthesis images activated lateral occipito-temporal cortex,
overlapping with hand-selective activity (Fig. 2C and D).
Importantly, activity in the visual hand-selective regions
of interest (Fig. 1A) was greater in one-handers, and pros-
thesis users in particular, compared to controls. A 2 � 2
ANOVA with factors group (all one-handers, n = 31, con-
trols, n = 24) and prosthesis type (cosmetic, active) revealed
a significant group difference [F(1,106) = 6.5, P = 0.012],
with one-handers showing stronger activity than controls.
Although activity tended to be stronger for the cosmetic
prostheses compared to active prostheses [F(1,106) = 3.5,
P = 0.066],
the
interaction
term
was
not
significant
[F(1,106) = 0.4, P = 0.538], indicating that this trend is
likely driven by the visual features of the cosmetic prosthe-
sis, which strongly resembles a hand. When focusing the
analysis specifically on one-handers who are prosthesis
users (n = 26, Supplementary Table 2), we found signifi-
cantly increased activity for images of unfamiliar active
prostheses (who share little visual similarity with natural
hands) in the hand-selective visual region of interest, com-
pared with controls [n = 24, t(48) = 2.8, P = 0.008; Fig. 2E].
These
results
suggest
that
prosthesis
usage
leads
to
increased activity for prosthesis images in hand-selective
regions.
We next determined whether prosthesis usage can ac-
count for interindividual differences in activity levels for
prosthesis images in visual hand-selective regions of inter-
est. Across one-handers, greater prosthesis usage in daily
life positively correlated with increased activity in visual
hand-selective cortex. This correlation was found when
one-handers viewed images of both their own prosthesis

 another person’s active prosthesis, which shares the func-
tionality of the hand but not its visual features [n = 31,
r(29) = 0.51, Pperm = 0.004, Fig. 3D–F]. Although usage
showed only a trending correlation with activation to an-
other’s
cosmetic
prostheses
[n = 31,
r(29) = 0.33,
Pperm = 0.068], correlations with active and cosmetic pros-
thesis images were not significantly different (two-tailed
Fisher Z = 0.82, P = 0.41). To examine the consistency of
the effect across one-handers’ subgroups primarily using
cosmetic or active prostheses, we repeated the analysis
while accounting for prosthesis usage type (Table 1). We
found that the relationship between prosthesis usage and
visual activity remained significant [ANCOVA (n = 26):
images
of
active
prostheses:
F(1,23) = 7.1,
P = 0.014;
images of cosmetic prostheses: F(1,23) = 6.0, P = 0.022].
Importantly, the subgroup factor (prosthesis usage type)
failed to show significance [F(1,23) = 0.13, P = 0.72 and
F(1,23) = 0.06, P = 0.81, respectively]. As the effects were
not restricted either to individual’s own prosthesis or to a
prosthesis type primarily used by the one-hander (active
versus cosmetic), these results hint at categorical changes
in representation (van den Heiligenberg et al., 2017), rather
than familiarity with the specific visual features of the
user’s prosthesis. This interpretation is consistent with the
fact that one-handers routinely replace their prosthesis, and
often use multiple prosthesis types (Table 1).
To determine whether the increased activity in prosthesis
users could be ascribed to passive visual experience alone,
we repeated the analysis in the control participants, based
on their passive observation log scores (Supplementary
Table 1). Although prosthesis-related experience is likely
to be less intensive in controls compared to one-handers,
the difference between the overall distribution of the POL
and MAL scores was non-significant, as indicated by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test
(Z = 0.750,
P = 0.627).
Therefore, the correlation analysis is potentially suitable
for measuring interindividual differences that scale with
passive observation. Correlation found between prosthesis
activity and controls’ visual experience was significantly
smaller than the reported correlation between prosthesis

and prosthesis activity in lateral occipito-temporal cortex for one’s own prosthesis (A–C) and exemplars of unfamiliar (others’) active prostheses
(D–F). Correlations within individuals’ visual hand-selective regions of interest (A and D) and whole-brain analysis (C and F) are presented.
Correlation was calculated while controlling for objects activity to achieve prosthesis-specific variations in functional MRI signal. Correlations of
prosthesis-related activity with prosthesis usage are significantly greater in one-handers than chance (B and E), but not with passive observation in
controls (G). CS = central sulcus; R/L = right/left hemispheres; STS = superior temporal sulcus.

that activity in hand-selective visual areas in the adult
visual
system
scales
with
active
everyday
visuomotor
experience.
To assess intrinsic coupling between individuals’ sensori-
motor missing-hand area and bilateral hand-selective visual
areas, we measured resting state functional connectivity.
Visuomotor connectivity was correlated with prosthesis
usage, while accounting for visuomotor connectivity with
the intact hand area (see ‘Materials and methods’ section).
One-handers who use their prosthesis more in daily life
showed stronger relative connectivity than those with
lower usage [n = 31, r(29) = 0.55; Pperm = 0.001; Fig. 1B
and C]. Here again, no significant correlation was found
with controls’ visual experience [n = 21, r(19) = �0.28,
Pperm = 0.22, group difference: one-tailed Fisher Z = 3.0
P = 0.001; Fig. 1D]. This result suggests that successful
prosthesis usage is associated with increased visuomotor
communication with the missing-hand’s territory.
To determine the utility of visuomotor functional con-
nectivity in explaining variance in visual activity, a hier-
archical
regression
analysis
was
implemented
(see
‘Materials and methods’ section). Visual activity to (un-
familiar) active prostheses served as the dependent variable.
As the sole predictor of such activity, usage accounted for
26% of the variance in the dependent variable [n = 31,
F(1,29) = 10.02, P = 0.004], while visuomotor connectivity
alone accounted for 22% of such variance [F(1,29) = 8.15,
P = 0.008]. When the predictors were combined, the ex-
plained variance was increased to 31% [F(2,28) = 6.24,
P = 0.006]. Considering this combined variance, we deter-
mined the shared versus unique effects of the predictors, i.e.
the contribution of usage to activity that is unrelated to
connectivity and vice versa. We found that the shared
effect accounts for 17% of the variance in the activity.
Connectivity uniquely accounted for only 5% of such vari-
ance (i.e. above the variance explained by usage), and this
effect
was
not
significant
[F(1,28) = 2.1,
P = 0.161].
Importantly, the prosthesis usage also contributed little
additional variance in activity (9%), beyond that explained
by the connectivity. As above, the effect failed to reach
significance level [F(1,28) = 3.6, P = 0.068]. Although this
analysis does not enable causal inferences to be drawn, it
nevertheless clearly indicates a threefold coupling between
activity, connectivity and usage.
Finally, we determined whether the repurposing of visual
hand-selective areas to support prosthesis representation de-
pends on the developmental period during which individuals
experienced hand loss. We therefore repeated our main ana-
lysis showing correspondence between prosthesis daily usage
and visual activity/connectivity (as described above), while
accounting for any potential group differences between indi-
viduals with congenital and acquired handlessness. We found
that the correspondence reported above remained significant,
both with respect to activity [ANCOVA: own prosthesis
(n = 25): F(1,22) = 6.2, P = 0.021; active prosthesis (n = 31):
F(1,28) = 9.0, P = 0.006] and functional connectivity (n = 31):
[F(1,28) = 10.3, P = 0.003]. Importantly, the subgroup factor
(congenital versus acquired one-handedness) failed to show
significance [own prosthesis: F(1,22) = 0.25, P = 0.623; active
prosthesis: F(1,28) = 0.06, P = 0.804; functional connectivity:
F(1,28) = 0.02, P = 0.891]. This result is consistent with our
previous findings showing that brain organization and re-
organization in one-handers is best characterized by everyday
experience (Makin et al., 2013a; Hahamy et al., 2015, 2017).
Discussion
Here we show that prosthetic limbs, used to substitute the
missing hand, can recruit brain resources normally devoted
for body representation. We also show that this neurophysio-
logical ‘embodiment’ of artificial limbs depends on prosthesis
usage in everyday life—those individuals who rely more on
their prosthesis to substitute hand function show stronger
activity in hand-selective visual areas when presented with
images of a prosthesis. Importantly, the engagement of
hand-selective areas in prosthesis representation was not spe-
cific to individuals’ own prostheses, but generalized to other,
unfamiliar, exemplars of artificial limbs. Furthermore, pros-
thetic limb representation did not depend on the type of
prosthesis primarily used by each one-hander, or on the de-
velopmental period in which individuals lost their limb and
started using prosthesis (i.e. congenital amelia versus acquired
amputation in adulthood). Our findings therefore hint at cat-
egorical representation of artificial limbs that primarily de-
pends on everyday experience (see van den Heiligenberg
et al., 2017 for related behavioural results). Finally, we
show that prosthesis usage also shapes large-scale brain re-
organization, specifically intrinsic connectivity between visual
and sensorimotor hand-selective areas. Together, our findings
provide the first account of how artificial limbs are repre-
sented in the brain of amputees.
While it has long been established that the lateral occi-
pito-temporal cortex shows modular visual representation
for upper limbs, the inputs guiding this representation, as
well as its behavioural relevance, have been debated
(Astafiev et al., 2004; Peelen and Downing, 2005; Orlov
et al., 2010, 2014; Downing and Peelen, 2011; Bracci et al.,
2012; Gallivan and Culham, 2015; Lingnau and Downing,
2015; Zimmermann et al., 2018). Indeed, recent studies
have argued that visual body representation is independent
of any motor experience (Vannuscorps and Caramazza,
2016; Striem-Amit et al., 2017). We demonstrate that
altered motor behaviour in daily life facilitates visual pro-
cessing and shapes communication between visual and sen-
sorimotor areas. However, since prosthesis usage strongly
relies on visual input (due to lack of somatosensory feed-
back), people who use their prosthesis more in daily life
also spend more time and attention while looking at it. It is

 therefore difficult to tease apart the contributions of pure
visual experience as opposed to visuomotor experience.
Several pieces of evidence in the current study can inform
us on the potential contribution of active, versus passive,
everyday experience. First, we found similar evidence when
presenting individuals with images of their own prosthesis
versus an unfamiliar one. This indicates that the increased
activity doesn’t depend on visual familiarity per se. Second,
we tested control participants with varying daily exposure
to prosthesis usage, including family members and friends
of one-handers. Even if these control participants may
spend less time observing a prosthesis compared with pros-
thesis users, the lack of correlation between the degree of
passive visual experience and activity in visual hand-select-
ive areas for prosthesis images indicates that the two are
not tightly coupled. Finally, our hierarchical regression
analysis reveals that the re-appropriation of the visual
hand-selective areas to support prosthetic limb representa-
tion depends not just on visual exposure to the prosthesis,
but rather also on increased connectivity with hand-select-
ive sensorimotor resources, induced by usage. While direc-
tionality
cannot
be
inferred
from
these
hierarchical
analyses, our findings provide evidence for a tight coupling
between daily actions, functional connectivity with sensori-
motor cortex, and visual body representation.
In summary, our findings show that neurocognitive re-
sources devoted to representing our body can support rep-
resentation of artificial body parts. By providing first
evidence for a relationship between embodied technology
and successful prosthesis usage, our results may aid assist-
ive and augmentative technological development and usage
(Makin et al., 2017).
