Abstract
The pathways through which neighborhood poverty can affect resident depression are still 
unknown. We investigated mechanisms through which neighborhood poverty may influence 
depression among older adults. Participants were drawn from the New York City Neighborhood 
and Mental Health in the Elderly Study II, a 3-wave study of adults aged 65–75 (n=3,497) at 
baseline. Neighborhood poverty and homicide were associated with depressive symptoms at 
follow-up waves (RR:1.20, 95%CI: 1.05, 1.36; RR: 1.09, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.17, respectively). 
Homicide accounted for 30% of the effect of neighborhood poverty on depressive symptoms. 
Neighborhood exposure to violence may be a key mechanism through which neighborhood 
poverty influences depression among older adults.

INTRODUCTION
Depression is a common disorder, affecting 120 million people worldwide (Mathers, Fat et 
al. 2008). It is currently the third leading cause of global disease burden and projections 
suggest that by 2030 unipolar depressive disorders will grow to be the leading cause of 
global disease burden (Mathers, Fat et al. 2008). Depression among older adults is

 particularly concerning (Kessler, McGonagle et al. 1994, Beekman, Copeland et al. 1999, 
Djernes 2006), as it is associated with increased disability, physical illness, cognitive 
decline, and reduced overall quality of life and satisfaction (Palsson and Skoog 1997, Lenze, 
Rogers et al. 2001, Charney, Reynolds et al. 2003).
A number of studies suggest that the physical and social environments in which people live 
have an important influence on their mental health (Evans 2003, Truong and Ma 2006, 
Aneshensel, Wight et al. 2007, Galea, Ahern et al. 2007, Yen, Michael et al. 2009). In 
particular, studies have consistently linked negative neighborhood-level economic 
characteristics such as poverty, disadvantage, inequality, and residential instability to higher 
risk of depression and depressive symptoms (Ross 2000, Silver, Mulvey et al. 2002, Latkin 
and Curry 2003, Kubzansky, Subramanian et al. 2005, Galea, Ahern et al. 2007, Beard, 
Cerdá et al. 2009). Older adults may be especially susceptible to depression due to 
neighborhood poverty because they are on average less mobile than their younger 
counterparts. Limited mobility makes older adults more dependent on local amenities and 
services and on local sources of social support (LaGrange, Ferraro et al. 1992, Whitley and 
Prince 2005). Indeed, multiple studies found that older adults living in neighborhoods with 
higher rates of poverty had higher rates of depression (Ostir, Eschbach et al. 2003, 
Kubzansky, Subramanian et al. 2005, Aneshensel, Wight et al. 2007, Beard, Cerdá et al. 
2009).
However, the pathways through which neighborhood poverty can shape older adult 
depression are still unknown. There may be individual level and neighborhood level 
mechanisms through which neighborhood poverty impacts depression. There are two 
potential pathways at the individual level through which neighborhood poverty may 
influence depression. First, people who live in poor neighborhoods are exposed to more 
stressful life events, such as unemployment (McLeod and Kessler 1990) and direct 
experiences of victimization and witnessing violence (Sampson, Raudenbush et al. 1997). 
Further, stressful life events have been linked to depression among older adults (Kraaij, 
Arensman et al. 2002). For example, a study among older adults found that those suffering 
from financial hardships were more likely to be depressed compared to older adults with 
fewer financial hardships(Krause 1987). Second, poor neighborhoods may lack amenities 
that are supportive of social organization and social engagement, such as churches and 
community centers (Altschuler, Somkin et al. 2004, Kim 2008). A lack of social 
organization and social engagement can lead to isolation, which has also been shown to 
increase the risk of depression (Glass, De Leon et al. 2006, Echeverría, Diez-Roux et al. 
2008). For example, results from a cohort study of approximately 2,000 older adults aged 65 
years and older from the New Haven Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study 
of the Elderly found that social engagement was associated with lower depression scores 
after adjustment for various demographic characteristics, physical activity and functional 
status.
There are also several pathways at the neighborhood level through which poverty can 
influence older adult depression. First, neighborhoods characterized by higher levels of 
poverty have lower levels of social cohesion and social control and higher levels of crime 
and physical disorder (Krivo and Peterson 1996, Sampson, Raudenbush et al. 1997, Cohen, 
Joshi et al.

 Farley et al. 2003). Higher levels of crime and physical disorder may generate fear and stress 
among residents, while lower levels of cohesion and control can result in reduced trust and 
potentially hamper efforts to reduce crime and physical disorder (Sampson and Groves 1989, 
Sampson and Laub 1990). Additionally, lower levels of social cohesion and social control 
can hinder the social support necessary to cope with the fear and stress induced by higher 
levels of crime and physical disorder (Sampson and Groves 1989, Sampson and Laub 1990). 
Fear and stress are known causes of depression (Hammen 2005). Second, areas of increased 
poverty often also have less access to green space and lower levels of walkability. Lower 
levels of social cohesion, green space, and walkability, and higher levels of crime and 
physical disorder have all been shown to increase the risk of depression in general and 
among older adults (Sampson, Morenoff et al. 2002, Latkin and Curry 2003, Whitley and 
Prince 2005, Berke, Gottlieb et al. 2007, Curry, Latkin et al. 2008, Echeverría, Diez-Roux et 
al. 2008, Lee and Maheswaran 2011). One cross-sectional analysis among adults aged 45–84 
found that lower levels of aesthetic quality and lower levels of social cohesion were 
associated with higher average depression scores for men and women, controlling for age, 
income, education, and race/ethnicity. Additionally, higher levels of violence were also 
associated with higher average depression scores (Mair, Roux et al. 2009). In addition, a 
study of men aged 65 and older found a significant association between neighborhood 
walkability and depressive symptoms after adjustment for income, physical activity, 
education, smoking status, living alone, age, ethnicity, and chronic disease (Berke, Gottlieb 
et al. 2007).
These individuals and neighborhood factors that impact depression can be explained by a 
stress-vulnerability model in which environmental factors can potentially work in three 
ways: 1) by directly influencing the likelihood of experiencing personal stressors (e.g. 
unemployment, violence, fear, physical disorder); 2) by providing resources to cope with 
such stressors (e.g. amenities that are supportive of social organization and social 
engagement); or 3) by influencing the effect of individual-level factors (e.g. an increase of 
crime may lead to a perceived unsafe environment which in turn increases depressive 
symptoms).
Understanding the links between neighborhood poverty and depression is critical if we are to 
identify intervention targets to reduce rates of depression among older adults. If for example, 
the relationship between neighborhood poverty and depression is explained by increased 
crime, interventions aimed at lowering levels of crime may also help reduce the risk of 
depression. To our knowledge, no previous longitudinal study has examined potential 
mediators of the relationship between neighborhood poverty and depression among older 
adults. Previous cross-sectional studies found that a variety of neighborhood level factors 
such as socioeconomic composition, racial composition, demographic composition, and the 
physical and social environment influence older adult health (Yen et al. 2009). In addition, 
while a majority of the cross-sectional studies found that neighborhood-level SES was the 
most consistent and strongest predictor of a variety of outcomes, including depression, a 
majority of them did not examine the specific neighborhood features or individual features 
that may aid in understanding the influence of neighborhood SES on health. In cross-
sectional studies it is difficult to ascertain the directionality of the relationship between 
neighborhood poverty and health; a longitudinal framework is better suited to establish a

 temporal pathway and thus examine whether specific neighborhood and individual features 
mediate the effect of neighborhood poverty on depression. Hence, building on previous 
cross-sectional studies, this study aimed to examine the direct and indirect associations 
between neighborhood-level poverty and subsequent depressive symptom severity among 
older adults using longitudinal data from the New York City Neighborhood and Mental 
Health in the Elderly Study II (NYCNAMES II). We hypothesized that higher levels of 
neighborhood poverty would increase risk for depressive symptom severity. Additionally, we 
hypothesized that the relationship between neighborhood poverty and depression would be 
mediated by various individual and neighborhood-level factors, including stressful life 
events, household income, social engagement, homicide rate, neighborhood physical and 
social disorder, walkability, and green space.
METHODS
Study Participants
Study participants were drawn from the New York City Neighborhood and Mental Health in 
the Elderly Study II (NYCNAMES II), a 3-year longitudinal study of elderly residents, 65 to 
75 years of age, of New York City (NYC). Data collection spanned from June 2011 to 
November 2013. Detailed methods used to sample study participants have been described 
elsewhere (Mooney, Joshi et al. 2015, Joshi, Mooney et al. 2016). Briefly, census tracts in 
NYC were divided into 16 strata, representing a broad range of racial-ethnic mix, household 
income, and walkability. Within each stratum, participants were sampled from a geocoded 
telephone list from InfoUSA. Each telephone number in each neighborhood had an equal 
probability of being selected. Interviews were conducted using a computer-assisted 
telephone interview and the DOT interviews two samples At wave 1, 3,497 individuals were 
interviewed, follow-up rates for wave 2 and wave 3 were 78% and 67%, respectively. This 
study focused on the 2,023 subjects with complete data for all 3 waves of follow-up. The 
study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Columbia University, New York 
Academy of Medicine and Abt SRBI.
Measures
Outcome: Depression—Past month depression symptom count was measured using the 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a 9-item symptom severity rating scale for 
depression (Spitzer, Kroenke et al. 1999). The PHQ-9 has excellent internal consistency, 
test–retest reliability, and construct validity(Martin, Rief et al. 2006) and has also been found 
to produce similar results when administered on the telephone. For the analysis, a depressive 
symptom severity score, ranging from 0–27, was estimated at baseline, wave 2, and wave 3 
of the study.
Exposure: Neighborhood Poverty—Subject’s addresses were geocoded using 
GeoSupport and DCP-Lion, geocoding applications developed by the New York City 
Department of City Planning. We defined a study participant’s neighborhood as a 1-
kilometer (km) network buffer, or the area an individual could cover walking 1-km along the 
pedestrian-accessible street network from his or her home address. Neighborhood poverty 
was defined as the percent of households in each participant’s 1-km network buffer living

 below the federal poverty level using the American Community Survey 5-year estimates 
from 2006–2010.
Mediators
Neighborhood-level—We tested several potential neighborhood-level mediators, 
including self-reported and recorded measures of neighborhood safety and disorder (i.e. 
homicide rate, perception of safety, pedestrian and bicyclist injuries and fatalities, 
neighborhood physical disorder), self-reported measures of neighborhood social cohesion, 
and locations of green space and geographic measures of walkability.
We downloaded homicide data from the New York Times homicide map and used kernel 
density methods to spatially interpolate a homicide rate across the city; a 1-year rate of 
homicides/100,000 persons living within the 1-km network buffer was used for analysis 
(TImes). We treated the sum of pedestrian—motorist injuries, pedestrian—motorist 
fatalities, bicyclist—motorist injuries, and bicyclist—motorist fatalities to which police were 
dispatched in each participant’s 1-km network buffer in 2010 as a measure of danger from 
automobiles. We measured neighborhood physical disorder by virtual street audit using the 
Computer Aided Neighborhood Visual Assessment System (CANVAS)(Quinn, Mooney et 
al. 2014, Bader, Mooney et al. 2015) to assess a sample of Google Street View imagery from 
532 street segments across New York City dating from 2007–2011. The 532 street segments 
were chosen in a 2.0 km grid to ensure coverage of New York City as a whole, with 1.0 km 
and 0.5 km grids overlaid in more densely populated neighborhoods to increase precision 
there. The spatial sample is described in more detail in Mooney et al 2014. (Mooney, Bader 
et al. 2014). We used nine audit items to estimate a latent level of physical disorder, and a 
raster surface estimating disorder across the city was constructed using ordinary kriging 
(Bader and Ailshire 2014, Mooney, Bader et al. 2014, Quinn, Mooney et al. 2014). Next, we 
estimated an objective physical disorder level for each subject’s neighborhood by 
geographically intersecting the 1 km network buffer with the disorder surface. We measured 
social cohesion and perception of safety through a self-report survey, in which study 
participants responded to questions about their neighborhood defined as a 15-minute walk 
from home. Social cohesion was measured using a 7-item survey, asking respondents in 
reference to the past 12 months questions about their neighborhood such as “if there are 
problems around your neighborhood, your neighbors get together to with it”, “your 
neighborhood is close-knit”, “people in your neighborhood generally don’t get along with 
each other”, etc. Perception of safety was measured using a 6-item survey, asking 
respondents questions in reference to the past 12 months about their neighborhood such as 
“my neighborhood streets are well lit at night”, “people riding bikes/walking can be easily 
seen by people in their homes”, “I see and speak to other people when I am walking in my 
neighborhood” etc. For both measures each question was rated from 1(strongly 
agree)-4(strongly disagree) and mean score was used for analysis, ranging from 1–4. 
Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.75. For each participant, we computed the average 
social cohesion score reported by other subjects whose home addresses fell in the 
participant’s 1-km network buffer. We defined green space as the percent of each 
participant’s 1-km buffer that fell within a large park, hereinafter described as ‘large parks’. 
We defined walkability as the sum of z-scores of: (1) residential population density (density

 of population per total residential land area), (2) land use entropy calculated from the 
distribution of building floor area among five land use types (education, entertainment, 
residential, retail, and office), (3) intersection density, (4) retail floor area ratio (the ratio of 
retail building floor area to retail land area), and (5) subway stop density (Neckerman, 
Lovasi et al. 2009).
Individual-level—We also accounted for potential individual-level mediators including 
household income, social engagement and stressful life events. We categorized income into 
four categories: less than or equal to $20,000, more than $20,000 to $40,000, more than 
$40,000 to $80,000, and more than $80,000. We measured social engagement with a ten-
item scale, asking respondents how frequently (“often”, “sometimes”, or “never”) in the past 
30 days they participated in activities such as going out to a movie, preparing meals and 
attending senior centers. A standardized summary score was used for analysis (de Leon, 
Glass et al. 2003). Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.83. The number of stressful life 
events was measured with a six-item survey asking respondents if various stressful events 
(e.g. “did you get divorced or separated from your spouse or mate?”, “did your spouse or 
mate become seriously ill”) occurred in the past 12 months (Boardman, Finch et al. 2001). 
Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was 0.60.
Other covariates
We also accounted for measures of demographic and psychosocial factors that have been 
found to be associated with poverty and depression. Demographics variables included sex, 
age, education (less than high school, high school/GED, some college, and Bachelor’s or 
more), race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Other). We 
included a measure of the personality trait neuroticism, because many longitudinal studies 
have suggested neuroticism predicts depression (De Graaf, Bijl et al. 2002). This covariate 
was measured by the short arm of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Brief Version (Sato 
2005).
Data Analysis
We conducted a repeated measures analysis utilizing generalized estimating equations with a 
log link function to estimate the relative risk of depressive symptom severity at waves 2 and 
3 associated with poverty at wave 1, assuming a Poisson distribution for symptom count. We 
estimated the total effect of poverty on subsequent depressive symptom severity with a 
model including baseline depressive symptom severity, demographic characteristics (i.e. sex, 
race, income and education) and neuroticism. In order to assess mediation, each potential 
individual and neighborhood-level mediator was added into the model individually 
(individual-level: social engagement, stressful life events, income; neighborhood-level: 
homicide rate, perception of safety, pedestrian and bicyclist injuries and fatalities, 
neighborhood physical disorder, social cohesion, walkability, and large parks).
We evaluated the percentage of the neighborhood poverty effect explained by the above-
mentioned potential mediators. This percentage was calculated as follows: ([exp(τ)−exp(τ
′)]/[exp(τ)−1)])×100, where exp(τ) was the risk ratio (RR) for the neighborhood poverty 
effect without any potential mediator in the model and exp(τ′) was the RR for the

 neighborhood poverty effect with each potential mediator in the model independently. All 
neighborhood-level variables (poverty and potential mediators) were rescaled by subtracting 
the median and dividing by the interquartile range (IQR). This approach helps improve 
comparability between the measures, so that the risk ratios represent associations with a 
difference in the interquartile range of each variable and prevents bias due to non-differential 
measurement error in aggregated measures (Mooney, Richards et al. 2014). Sample weights 
were created based on the 2006–2010 American Community Survey 5 Year Estimates to 
adjust for non-coverage and non-response and to align the total sample to the population 
benchmarks for gender, race/ethnicity, education and geographic location. IVEWARE was 
used to multiply impute missing covariate data using all available survey responses for the 
imputation (Raghunathan, Solenberger et al. 2002). Rubin’s rules were used to synthesize 
results across five imputed datasets (Rubin 2009). All analyses accounted for sampling 
weights and clustering (at the neighborhood level) using robust standard errors, and were 
conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) (1999).
RESULTS
Individual and neighborhood characteristics of the study participants at baseline are shown 
in Table 1. A majority of the sample was female (61%), Non-Hispanic White (47%), had an 
income of less than or equal to $40,000 (60%), and had at least a high school education or 
equivalent (55%). The associations between neighborhood poverty, the individual level 
mediators, and depression are shown in Table 2. In the first model, controlling for 
demographics, baseline depression and neuroticism, individuals living in areas with higher 
neighborhood poverty had a higher risk of greater depressive symptom severity (Risk Ratio 
(RR): 1.20, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.05–1.36).
Individual-level mediators
Stressful life events were associated with a higher risk of greater depressive symptom 
severity (Table 2, Model 2: RR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05–1.21). Social engagement and individual 
income were not associated with depressive symptom severity. However, no individual level 
factors were found to mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty and 
depression. In all models, there was also a consistent association of neuroticism with 
depression (RR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.68–2.18).
Neighborhood level mediators
The association between neighborhood poverty and depression and the neighborhood-level 
mediators is shown in Table 3. Higher homicide rate per 100,000 persons (75th vs 25th 
percentile) was associated with 1.09 times the risk of increased depressive symptoms (RR: 
1.09, 95% CI: 1.02–1.17) and partially mediated the association of neighborhood poverty 
with depressive symptom severity (RR: 1.14 95% CI: 1.00–1.31). Homicide rate accounted 
for 30.0% of the association of neighborhood poverty with depression. Large parks were 
associated with an increased risk of depressive symptom severity (RR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01–
1.14), however large parks did not mediate the relationship between neighborhood poverty 
and depression. Walkability, pedestrian-bicyclist injuries and fatalities, neighborhood 
physical disorder, perception of safety and social cohesion were not associated with

 depressive symptom severity and did not mediate the relationship between neighborhood 
poverty and depression.
DISCUSSION
In this longitudinal study of older adults, we found that neighborhood violence was a key 
mechanism through which neighborhood poverty shaped the risk of depression among older 
adults. Neighborhood poverty was positively associated with depressive symptom severity 
among the elderly. Older adults who experienced a greater number of stressful life events, 
lived in neighborhoods with a higher homicide rate, or lived in neighborhoods with a greater 
percentage of large parks in New York City experienced greater depressive symptom 
severity than those who did not. Among the neighborhood conditions measured, only living 
in a neighborhood with a higher homicide rate partially mediated the relationship of 
neighborhood poverty with depression.
Our findings on the relationship between neighborhood poverty and depression are 
consistent with previous literature; many studies have found that living in poor 
neighborhoods increases the risk for depression and depressive symptoms (Ross 2000, 
Silver, Mulvey et al. 2002, Latkin and Curry 2003, Kubzansky, Subramanian et al. 2005, 
Galea, Ahern et al. 2007, Beard, Cerdá et al. 2009). To our knowledge, this is one of the first 
studies to reveal the role neighborhood violence plays in mediating the association between 
neighborhood poverty and depression among older adults, and one of the first studies to 
examine the relationship between objectively-measured sources of neighborhood violence 
and depression. This pathway is consistent with previous research that has linked an increase 
in crime to depression(Sampson and Groves 1989, Latkin and Curry 2003, Kubzansky, 
Subramanian et al. 2005), and in line with social stress theory, suggests that the effect of 
neighborhood poverty on depression functions partly through exposure to major area-level 
stressors such as violence (Wheaton 1983, Wheaton 1985).
We also observed that a greater percentage of land area devoted to large parks within 
participants’ 1km network buffer was associated with an increase in depressive symptom 
severity. Our findings are in contrast with a review study between green space and health 
that concluded that most studies found a beneficial effect of green space on health.(Lee and 
Maheswaran 2011) However, the review noted that most studies used weak measures of 
green space and further research was needed to uncover the relationship (Lee and 
Maheswaran 2011). Individuals living in 1-km network buffers that include a higher 
percentage of parks may lack access to other amenities that might be beneficial for mental 
health. This finding may also have arisen by chance or may be an artifact of residual 
confounding.
Study findings should be taken in light of the following limitations. First, we examined 
depressive symptoms with a validated instrument, rather than a clinical diagnosis of 
depression. Second, while we controlled for various measures related to poverty and 
depression, there may still be confounding due to unmeasured or imperfectly measured co-
factors. Third, our study had low response and cooperation rates. However, our sample was 
demographically representative of the 2010 U.S. Census population aged 65 to 75 in New 
Joshi et al.

 York City after the use of sample weights. Lastly, our sample was recruited through a 
geocoded telephone list provided by InfoUSA, which does not include mobile cell phone 
numbers. However, the National Center for Health Statistics reports that in 2010 (at the start 
of the survey), only 3.7% of Americans over the age of 65 lived in cell phone-only 
households.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the results suggest that older adults living in high-poverty 
urban neighborhoods are at greater risk for depression. Living in areas with higher homicide 
rates may partially explain the relationship between urban neighborhood poverty and 
depression. The findings suggest that investment in violence prevention in high-poverty 
neighborhoods will not only reduce violence, but may also have secondary benefits by 
improving mental health in the most vulnerable neighborhoods. Additional research is 
needed to identify alternate mechanisms in the pathway between neighborhood poverty and 
depression. Characterization of these mechanisms can inform interventions to reduce 
depression risk in urban neighborhoods.

 Highlights
•
Older adults living in high-poverty urban neighborhoods are at greater risk for 
depression.
•
Older adults who experienced a greater number of stressful life events, lived 
in neighborhoods with a higher homicide rate experienced greater depressive 
symptom severity than those who did not.
•
Neighborhood exposure to violence may be a key mechanism through which 
neighborhood poverty influences depression among older adults.
