ABSTRACT
Background: Vitamin D deficiency is common in children with se-
vere acute malnutrition, in whom it is associated with severe wast-
ing. Ready-to-use therapeutic food (the standard treatment) contains
modest amounts of vitamin D that do not reliably correct deficiency.
Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether high-dose
oral vitamin D3 enhances weight gain and development in children
with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition.
Design: We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial of
high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in children aged 6–58 mo
with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in Pakistan. Partici-
pants were randomly assigned to receive 2 oral doses of 200,000 IU
vitamin D3 or placebo at 2 and 4 wk after starting ready-to-use thera-
peutic food. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants
gaining >15% of baseline weight at 8 wk after starting ready-to-use
therapeutic food (the end of the study). Secondary outcomes were
mean weight-for-height or -length z score and the proportion of par-
ticipants with delayed development at the end of the study (assessed
with the Denver Development Screening Tool II), adjusted for base-
line values.
Results: Of the 194 randomly assigned children who started the
study, 185 completed the follow-up and were included in the analy-
sis (93 assigned to intervention, 92 to control). High-dose vitamin D3
did not influence the proportion of children gaining >15% of base-
line weight at the end of the study (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.94,1.15,
P = 0.47), but it did increase the weight-for-height or -length z score
(adjusted mean difference: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.49,1.65, P < 0.001) and
reduce the proportion of participants with delayed global develop-
ment [adjusted RR (aRR): 0.49; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.77, P = 0.002],
delayed gross motor development (aRR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.64,
P = 0.002), delayed fine motor development (aRR: 0.59; 95% CI:
0.38, 0.91, P = 0.018), and delayed language development (aRR:
0.57; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.96, P = 0.036).
Conclusions: High-dose vitamin D3 improved the mean weight-
for-height or -length z score and developmental indexes in children
receiving standard therapy for uncomplicated severe acute malnu-
trition in Pakistan. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT03170479.

INTRODUCTION
Nearly 20 million children suffer from severe acute malnu-
trition worldwide (1), an estimated 1.4 million of whom live in
Pakistan (2). Children who survive an acute episode of severe
acute malnutrition are at increased risk of experiencing long-term
adverse effects on their physical and mental health (3, 4), which
may compromise their economic productivity as adults (5).
Ready-to-use
therapeutic
food—an
energy-dense
micronutrient-enriched
paste—represents
the
mainstay
for
community treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnu-
trition (i.e., where children are clinically well and alert, with
good appetite). The WHO has highlighted the need for research
to identify adjunctive therapies that may improve response
to ready-to-use therapeutic food, including administration of
broad-spectrum antibiotics and high-dose vitamin A (1). How-
ever, the potential for adjunctive vitamin D to improve weight

gain and developmental outcomes in children with severe acute
malnutrition has been overlooked. This is surprising, because
rickets and vitamin D deficiency are known to be common in
children with severe acute malnutrition (6–9), vitamin D defi-
ciency associates with severe wasting in malnourished children
(10), and vitamin D supplementation has been shown to enhance
weight gain in low-birthweight infants (11). Vitamin D has also
been shown to have favorable effects on skeletal muscle function
(12), neurodevelopment (13), and immune function (14, 15):
its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial actions might enhance
response to standard therapy for severe acute malnutrition, a
condition in which both increased systemic inflammation and
infections are associated with adverse outcome (16, 17).
Although ready-to-use therapeutic food contains some vitamin
D [600 IU/sachet, with each child receiving 1.5–5.0 sachets/d ac-
cording to body weight (Supplemental Table 2)], intake from
this source may not be sufficient to consistently elevate circulat-
ing concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] into the
optimal range in children with severe acute malnutrition, given
the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this group (6–
9) and the presence of a systemic inflammatory response that
may disregulate vitamin D metabolism and increase vitamin D
requirements (18). We hypothesized that the addition of high-
dose vitamin D supplementation to ready-to-use therapeutic food
would be effective in elevating serum 25(OH)D concentrations
into the high physiologic range in children with severe acute mal-
nutrition, and that this would improve weight gain and devel-
opmental indexes over the initial 8 wk of treatment. We tested
this hypothesis by conducting a randomized placebo-controlled
trial.
METHODS
Trial design and setting
We conducted a multicenter 2-arm parallel double-blind ran-
domized placebo-controlled trial with a one-to-one allocation ra-
tio. Participants were recruited from four outpatient therapeutic
program centers (Samina, Jhok Utra, Aali Wala, and Kot Chutta)
run by the National Program for Family Planning and Primary
Health Care in the Dera Ghazi Khan District of Southern Punjab
in Pakistan. This socioeconomically disadvantaged area is fre-
quently affected by floods, and there is a high prevalence of illit-
eracy, overcrowding, and severe acute malnutrition. The area has
a low prevalence of malaria.
Approvals, consent processes and registration
The study was approved by the Ethical Review and Advanced
Study Research Board of the University of Punjab, Pakistan (ref-
erence 9/2352-ACAD), the Integrated Reproductive Maternal &
Newborn Child Health & Nutrition Program, Punjab, Pakistan,
and the District Health Office of the Dera Ghazi Khan District,
Punjab, Pakistan. Parents of all potentially eligible outpatient
therapeutic program attendees were provided with information
about the study in their native language by a doctor or a health
visitor at participating centers, and informed consent, confirmed
by signature or thumb impression, was obtained from those who
gave permission for their child to take part in the study. This study
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03170479.
Eligibility criteria
Children aged 6–59 mo at enrollment whose parents gave
consent for them to participate were potentially eligible if they
had severe acute malnutrition without complications, as defined
by WHO [i.e., children with a mid-upper arm circumference
(MUAC) of <115 mm, a weight-for-height z score <−3, or grade
1–2 bilateral edema who were clinically well and alert with good
appetite (1)]. Exclusion criteria were either ingestion of a dose of
vitamin D >200,000 IU (5 mg)/mo in the last 3 mo (confirmed by
medical records, or by maternal recall where these were unavail-
able) or the presence of complications of severe malnutrition (se-
vere dehydration, severe anemia, severe pitting edema, anorexia,
hypothermia, hyperpyrexia, acute lower respiratory infection, or
hypoglycemia).
Baseline assessment
Children aged 6–59 mo whose parents gave consent for them to
participate underwent the following baseline assessment. A struc-
tured sociodemographic and nutritional questionnaire was ad-
ministered to capture information on participants’demographic
details, parental occupation, education, monthly income, and nu-
tritional intake. Gestational age was taken from the antenatal
record where delivery occurred in hospital, or was based on a ma-
ternal report for home deliveries. For children ≤24 mo of age who
were born prematurely (gestation <37 wk), age was corrected by
subtracting the number of weeks of missed gestation from the cur-
rent age. A history was taken to assess for symptoms suggesting
that the child was not clinically well (cough, shortness of breath,
diarrhea, fever, and anorexia); children assessed as being clini-
cally unwell on the basis of these symptoms were excluded from
the trial and referred to a stabilization center for further assess-
ment. An appetite test was performed by offering children a small
sample of ready-to-use therapeutic food to eat. Children who did
not eat at least one-third of a packet (3 teaspoons, 30 g) of ready-
to-use therapeutic food after 3 feeding attempts were classified
as having poor appetite, excluded from the study, and referred
for inpatient management.
A physical examination was then performed. Children were as-
sessed for the following signs of rickets: bow legs, knock knees,
windswept deformity of the knees, and proximal myopathy. The
child’
s alertness was assessed: children who were lethargic, apa-
thetic, unconscious, or had seizures were deemed to be nonalert
and excluded from the trial. The child’
s hydration status was as-
sessed: children with a history of recent watery diarrhea associ-
ated with eyelid retraction, weak or absent radial pulse, absence
of tears, cold peripheries, lethargy, or absence of urinary output
were deemed to have severe dehydration and excluded from the
trial. Children were assessed for the presence of palmar pallor:
those whose palms were very pale, or so pale that they looked
white, were deemed to have severe anemia and were excluded
from the trial. Children were assessed for the presence of pitting
edema: thumb pressure was applied to the tops of the feet for
3 s and pitting edema was judged to be present where a thumb
impression remained for a few seconds on both feet. Edema was
graded as mild (grade 1, affecting both feet/ankles), moderate
(grade 2, affecting both feet, plus lower legs and hands), or se-
vere (grade 3, generalized edema including both feet, plus legs,
arms and face). Children with severe (grade 3) pitting edema were

excluded from the trial. Vital signs (temperature, pulse, and res-
piratory rate) were recorded, and children who were hypothermic
or who had hyperpyrexia (axillary temperature <35°C or >39°C,
respectively) were excluded from the trial. Children with tachyp-
nea (>50 breaths/min for those aged <12 mo, >40 breaths/min
for those aged 12–59 mo), chest indrawing, wheeze, or stridor
were classified as having a likely acute lower respiratory infec-
tion and excluded from the trial. A heel-prick was performed to
check for hypoglycemia with the use of a Dextrostix reagent strip:
children with a heel-prick glucose concentration of <3 mmol/L
were considered to be hypoglycemic and excluded from the trial.
Anthropometric measurements were conducted by outpatient
clinic staff who were specifically trained to make these mea-
surements. Their competence in measuring weight, height, and
MUAC was assessed and confirmed by the principal investiga-
tor. Double measurements were taken by a staff member. If they
differed from each other, additional measurements were made un-
til an exact value was replicated. The replicated value was then
recorded. MUAC was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with color-
labeled MUAC tape at the midpoint between the olecranon pro-
cess and the acromion process. Children were weighed to the
nearest 10 g unclothed or in very light clothing with a UNIS-
CALE (19), which was adjusted by a standard weight and cal-
ibrated to zero before each measurement. For infants and chil-
dren who could not stand, the UNISCALE was used to measure
the mother’
s weight alone. The mother was then handed the un-
dressed infant or child while standing on the scales, and the com-
bined weight of the mother and infant was measured. The infant
or child’
s weight was calculated as the difference between these 2
readings. The recumbent length of children ≤87 cm in height was
measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with the use of a length-measuring
board with an affixed headrest and a movable foot piece (SECA
GmbH & Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany), placed on a flat sur-
face. Children >87 cm in height were measured in the standing
position with heels together and without shoes on a horizontal
flat plate fixed to the measuring board base. Weight-for-height z
scores were calculated according to the WHO child growth stan-
dards (20).
Children who were found to be eligible to participate in the trial
also underwent a baseline developmental assessment with the use
of the standard protocol of the Denver Development Screening
Tool II (DDST II) (21), performed by a nurse with specific train-
ing in child development or a pediatrician, who was blinded to
the participants’allocation. This instrument assesses the ability
of children aged ≤6 y to perform a range of tasks and allows them
to be compared with a standardized population of children of the
same age. Tasks are grouped into 4 categories (social contact,
fine motor skills, language, and gross motor skills) and include
items such as “smiles spontaneously” (performed by 90% of
3-mo-olds), “bangs 2 cubes held in hands” (90% of 13-mo-
olds), “speaks 3 words other than dada/mama” (90% of 21-mo-
olds), and “hops on one leg” (90% of 5-y-olds). Following a
standardized algorithm, children are assessed as having “no de-
lay,” “caution” (an intermediate classification), or “delay” in
each category. These category assessments are then used to clas-
sify global developmental status as normal (no category de-
layed and no more than one category classified as “caution”),
suspect (≥2 cautions or ≥1 delay), or untestable (based on
a specific pattern of refusals). Of note, some patterns of re-
fusals may allow a category assessment but preclude a global
assessment of developmental status according to DDST II al-
gorithms. Where children were classified as having “untestable”
global developmental status at screening, developmental assess-
ments were repeated 2 d later; if the global developmental sta-
tus was still untestable at this point, the assessment was repeated
again 2 d after that. With regard to the timing of developmental as-
sessments relative to commencement of ready-to-use therapeutic
food and study medication, all children commenced ready-to-use
therapeutic food as soon as the diagnosis of uncomplicated se-
vere acute malnutrition was made, but no child was randomised
or commenced study medication until the baseline assessment of
developmental status was complete.
Randomization and blinding
The random allocation sequence was generated on a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet by a statistician who was independent of the
study (Mr. Arslan Chughtai, Rashid Latif Medical Collage, La-
hore); a copy was held by the principal investigator (JS), but she
did not consult this during the trial. Consecutive numbers from
001 to 200 were assigned to active and placebo groups in a 1:1 ra-
tio. No restrictions (e.g., stratification, block size) were applied.
This code was used by the study pharmacy to label active and
placebo medication, with a study number assigned to the active
and placebo arms, respectively. Participants were enrolled by 4
health workers in the community management of acute malnutri-
tion (CMAM) program and 1 research nurse, who assigned con-
secutive identification numbers to participants according to the
sequence in which they were enrolled. The hospital pharmacy
then supplied study medication bearing this identification num-
ber. The active and placebo medications were presented identi-
cally (syringes of oily solution for oral administration) and had
the same appearance and taste. The parents or guardians of all
the study participants were blinded to the allocations, as were the
health workers, the research nurse, and the pediatrician who en-
rolled participants and/or performed study assessments.
Interventions
All participants were treated with an 8-wk course of ready-
to-use therapeutic food (see Supplemental Table 1 for compo-
sition) provided by the United Nations International Children’
s
Emergency Fund at community centers according to the WHO
and national guidelines (1, 22). Ready-to-use therapeutic food
was supplied to parents on a weekly basis according to the child’
s
body weight (1.5–5.0 sachets/d, as per Supplemental Table 2) by
suitably trained staff who provided parents with information re-
garding benefits of ready-to-use therapeutic food and advice as
to how it should be taken. Participants also received a 7-d course
of oral amoxicillin (60 mg · kg−1 · d−1 split into 3 daily doses)
during the first week of treatment as per the national guidelines
(22). Participants randomly assigned to the intervention arm of
the trial additionally received 2 oral doses of 200,000 IU (5 mg)
of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in 1 mL olive oil, administered
via a plastic syringe at 2 and 4 wk post-initiation of ready-to-use
therapeutic food. This solution was manufactured by GT Pharma
(Pvt) Ltd Lahore and quality accredited by the Ministry of Na-
tional Health Services of Pakistan. We elected to give large bolus
doses of vitamin D because they have been shown to be safe and

effective in rapidly elevating circulating 25(OH)D concentrations
in children (23–25) and can be directly observed, thereby circum-
venting potential problems with poor adherence. The specific reg-
imen of 2 × 200,000 IU at 2 and 4 wk was chosen as this was
already being administered locally to children with complicated
severe acute malnutrition, and they tolerated it well. Participants
randomly assigned to the control arm of the trial received 2 oral
doses of placebo (1 mL extra virgin Dalda olive oil) via a plastic
syringe at 2 and 4 wk post-initiation of ready-to-use therapeutic
food. Study medication was packed into syringes and sealed at
the pharmacy in Shahroze Hospital, Dera Ghazi Khan District,
by a registered pharmacist. Syringes containing active or placebo
medication were labeled with a unique identification number ac-
cording to the randomization code, as described above, and stored
in a dry, cool environment for up to 8 wk as recommended by
the manufacturer. Administration of all doses of study medica-
tion was directly observed by study staff.
Follow-up
Study participants were given a CMAM enrollment card, and
family members were assisted in bringing children for visits to
the study outpatient therapeutic program centers. According to
standard practice, children were monitored weekly throughout
the whole study period at the centers, which provided their ready-
to-use therapeutic food diet and assessed them for any medical
or nutritional complications, with recording of serious adverse
events and referral to a tertiary care hospital if necessary. Par-
ents were encouraged to come to the outpatient centers for any
ailments affecting their child, and treatment was free of charge
for study children throughout the trial’
s duration. Anthropome-
try and developmental assessments were performed at 8 wk post-
initiation of ready-to-use therapeutic food: all 8-wk anthropomet-
ric assessments were made by CMAM health workers who were
blinded to allocation. All but 7 of the 8-wk developmental as-
sessments were conducted by a research nurse or a pediatrician,
who was also blinded to allocation. Seven 8-wk developmental
assessments were conducted by the principal investigator because
of staff absence. A 3-mL blood sample was taken at the 8-wk
follow-up from a subset of 116 participants whose parents gave
additional consent; this was centrifuged after clotting, and serum
samples were aspirated and frozen at –20°C pending biochemical
analysis. Sufficient serum for biochemical analyses was available
for 90 of the 116 sampled participants.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was the proportion of partic-
ipants gaining >15% of their baseline weight at 8 wk post-
initiation of ready-to-use therapeutic food (i.e., 6 wk af-
ter their first dose of study medication); this outcome was
selected as primary on the basis that it represents a key
exit criterion for the outpatient therapuetic program for se-
vere acute malnutrition in Pakistan (22). Secondary outcomes
were mean weight and mean weight-for-height or -length z
score at 8 wk post-initiation of ready-to-use therapeutic food;
proportion of participants with delayed development (global,
gross motor, fine motor, language, and personal or social) at
8 wk post-initiation of ready-to-use therapeutic food; mean
serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, corrected calcium, albu-
min, and prealbumin at 8 wk post-initiation of ready-to-use
therapeutic food (n = 90 subset); and the proportion of partici-
pants with serum 25(OH)D concentration ≥50 nmol/L (a widely
accepted cutoff used to define vitamin D deficiency) (26) at 8 wk
post-initiation of ready-to-use therapeutic food (n = 90 subset).
Laboratory methods
Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by liquid chro-
matography tandem mass spectrometry in the Department of
Clinical Biochemistry at the Homerton University Hospital Na-
tional Health Service Foundation Trust, London, UK, which par-
ticipates in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme
(www.deqas.org/). Serum concentrations of albumin, prealbu-
min, and calcium were measured in the same laboratory with the
use of an Architect ci8200 analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics). Cor-
rected calcium was calculated with the use of the formula:
corrected Ca (mmol/L) = measured Ca (mmol/L) + 0.020

(1)
Sample size
Assuming that 76% of children in the control arm would gain
>15% of baseline weight at 8 wk (i.e., the minimum standard ex-
pected of a CMAM program) (27), we calculated that a total of
158 participants (79/arm) would need to complete follow-up in
order to detect a 16% absolute increase (to 92%) in the propor-
tion of children gaining >15% weight at 8 wk in the intervention
arm with 80% power at the 5% significance level; this effect size
was selected on the grounds that it would represent a clinically
significant improvement in treatment outcome. The number of
158 was inflated to a total of 194 to allow for attrition owing to
death and loss to follow-up. No interim analyses were planned or
performed.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were conducted by original assigned group
with the use of Stata/IC version 12.1 (StataCorp). The z scores for
anthropometric outcomes were calculated with the use of WHO
Anthro v3.2.2 (28). The primary outcome was analyzed by calcu-
lation of the RR with 95% CI comparing the proportion of chil-
dren in each arm who had gained ≥15% in weight at 8-wk follow-
up against the baseline. The effect of allocation on continuous
outcomes that were assessed both at baseline and at the end of the
study (e.g., weight and weight-for-height z score at 8 wk) was an-
alyzed with the use of linear regression, adjusting for the baseline
value. The effect of allocation on categorical outcome variables
that were assessed both at baseline and at the end of the study
(e.g., developmental status) were analyzed with the use of gener-
alized linear models with a log link and binomial distribution to
yield an RR adjusted for the baseline value with 95% CI and P
value (29). Mean values of continuous outcomes measured at 8
wk but not at baseline [e.g., serum concentrations of 25(OH)D,
calcium, albumin, and prealbumin] were compared between the
active and placebo groups with the use of unpaired Student’
s t

tests to yield a mean difference between study arms with 95%
CI for that difference. Statistical significance was inferred where
P < 0.05. No subgroup analyses were conducted.
RESULTS
Participant flow and recruitment
Figure 1 illustrates participant flow. A total of 252 children
were assessed for eligibility to participate in the trial between
June 2015 and June 2016: 58 were excluded (52 because they
were ineligible, 6 because parental consent was not given) and
194 were randomly assigned, with 97 being allocated to the vita-
min D3 group and 97 receiving the placebo. One child allocated
to the vitamin D3 group died before taking the first dose of study
medication (cause of death: dehydration secondary to gastroen-
teritis), and a further 8 children (3 allocated to vitamin D3, 5 allo-
cated to placebo) moved away from the study site prior to admin-
istration of the first dose of study medication. The remaining 185
participants (93 allocated to vitamin D3, 92 allocated to placebo)
all took both doses of study medication, completed the follow-up
and were included in the analysis. The trial ended on the date of
the final study visit of the last participant to be randomly assigned.
Baseline characteristics
The clinical and demographic characteristics of the par-
ticipants included in the analysis were comparable for the
intervention and control groups at baseline (Table 1). Overall,
the mean age was 15.4 mo (range 6–58 mo) and 104 out of 185
(56%) participants were female. The mean weight was 5.5 kg
(range 2.4–11.7 kg), the mean weight-for-height z score was –3.9
(range –7.0 to –1.0) and mean MUAC was 10.2 cm (range 7.0–
12.0 cm). Global developmental status was classified as
“untestable” for 34 children at baseline, 19 of whom were
untestable 2 d later and 8 were untestable 2 d after that. The pro-
portion of participants with delayed global development at base-
line was 108/177 (61.0%). No participant had clinical signs of
rickets at baseline.
Efficacy outcomes
The effects of high-dose vitamin D3 on outcomes at 8 wk
post-initiation of ready-to-use therapeutic food are presented in
Table 2. The proportion of participants with weight gain >15% of
baseline at 8 wk post-initiation of ready-to-use therapeutic food
was not significantly different between participants randomly as-
signed to vitamin D3 and those randomly assigned to placebo (84
out of 93 compared with 80 out of 92 respectively, RR: 1.04;
95% CI: 0.94, 1.15, P = 0.47; Table 2). However, mean weight-
for-height z score and mean weight at 8 wk post-initiation of
ready-to-use therapeutic food were both significantly higher in
the participants randomly assigned to vitamin D3 (mean inter-
arm difference in weight-for-height z score, adjusted for base-
line: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.65, P < 0.001; mean interarm dif-
ference in weight, adjusted for baseline: 0.26 kg; 95% CI: 0.11,

0.41, P = 0.001; Figure 2). High-dose vitamin D3 also reduced
the proportion of participants with delayed global development
at 8 wk (RR adjusted for baseline global developmental status:
0.49; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.77, P = 0.002). Analysis of individual
DDST II components revealed that allocation to high-dose vita-
min D3 resulted in statistically significant reductions in the pro-
portion of participants having delayed gross motor development
(RR adjusted for baseline gross motor developmental status: 0.29;
95% CI: 0.13, 0.64, P = 0.002), delayed fine motor development
(RR adjusted for baseline fine motor developmental status: 0.59;
95% CI: 0.38, 0.91, P = 0.018), and delayed language devel-
opment (RR adjusted for baseline language developmental sta-
tus: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.96, P = 0.036) at the 8-wk follow-
up. No statistically significant effect of the intervention was seen
on the outcome of personal or social development at 8 wk post-
initiation of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RR adjusted for base-
line personal or social developmental status: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.58,
1.04, P = 0.093). In the subset of 90 participants for whom
biochemical analyses were performed, mean end-study serum
25(OH)D concentrations were significantly higher among partic-
ipants randomly assigned to intervention compared with the con-
trol group (99.4 vs. 46.6 nmol/L, mean interarm difference 52.7
nmol/L; 95% CI for difference: 40.3, 65.2 nmol/L, P < 0.001).
All (45/45) sampled participants randomly assigned to the
intervention arm had end-study serum 25(OH)D concentrations
>50 nmol/L, as compared with 19/45 (42%) sampled partici-
pants randomly assigned to the placebo (RR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.68,
3.33, P < 0.001). The end-study serum 25(OH)D concentration
exceeded 125 nmol/L in 12/45 (26.7%) participants randomly
assigned to vitamin D. The concentrations ranged from 58 to
195 nmol/L in participants randomly assigned to the interven-
tion arm and from 12 to 75 nmol/L in participants randomly
assigned to the placebo. No statistically significant difference in
mean serum concentrations of corrected calcium, albumin, or pre-
albumin were seen for participants randomly assigned to the in-
tervention and control arms of the trial at 8 wk post-initiation of
ready-to-use therapeutic food.
Adverse events
Only one serious adverse event occurred during this study: one
participant died of severe dehydration secondary to acute gas-
troenteritis. This event occurred after randomization but before
any dose of study medication was administered. No actual or sus-
pected adverse reactions arose during the trial.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial
to investigate the effects of high-dose vitamin D supplementation
in children with severe acute malnutrition. Among children with
uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in Pakistan, we found
that the administration of 2 oral doses of 200,000 IU (5 mg) of
vitamin D3 in addition to ready-to-use therapeutic food resulted
in clinically significant improvements in mean weight and mean
weight-for-height z score at 8 wk post-initiation of ready-to-use
therapeutic food (6 wk post-initiation of study medication). High-
dose vitamin D supplementation also resulted in substantial re-
ductions in the proportion of children with delayed global devel-
opmental status, delayed gross and fine motor development, and
delayed language development at the end of the study. Despite
the relatively high dose of vitamin D administered, no suspected
or actual adverse reactions were reported, and no hypercalcemia
was observed in a subset of 90 participants for whom end-study
results of biochemical analyses were available.

Vitamin D supplementation has previously been reported to
improve weight gain and growth in children: in a randomized
controlled trial conducted in 2079 low-birthweight term infants
in New Delhi, India, Trilok Kumar and colleagues (11) reported
that a weekly oral dose of 1400 IU of vitamin D3 improved z
scores for weight, length, and arm circumference by 0.11–0.12
points at 6 mo. Our study extends this finding to show that, in
a clinically distinct population of children with uncomplicated
severe acute malnutrition, administration of a much higher dose
of vitamin D was well tolerated and resulted in substantial and
clinically meaningful increases in mean weight-for-height or
-length of >1 z score. In other clinical contexts, vitamin D has
been shown to protect against acute infections and accelerate res-
olution of inflammation (14, 15): both infections and increased

systemic inflammation are associated with adverse outcome in
severe acute malnutrition (16, 17), and it may be that these
immunomodulatory actions of vitamin D underlie the improve-
ments in weight gain that we observed.
In keeping with reports of other trials in children being treated
for severe acute malnutrition (32, 33), we observed longitu-
dinal improvements in developmental status in both arms of
the study. However, the improvements that we observed among
participants randomly assigned to high-dose vitamin D3 were
significantly greater than those seen in the control arm. The
improvements in gross motor development that we observed in
the intervention arm over the control arm likely reflect recognized
benefits of vitamin D supplementation for skeletal muscle func-
tion (12). However, our finding of a favorable effect of vitamin
D supplementation on language development provides novel ev-
idence of neurodevelopmental benefits of vitamin D supplemen-
tation in children. This finding complements the results of animal
studies demonstrating the importance of vitamin D for brain de-
velopment (13), and lends weight to the emerging paradigm that
vitamin D has important effects on development and functioning
of the central nervous system in humans (34). Taken together, our
findings suggest that the vitamin D content of current ready-to-
use therapeutic food is not optimal for supporting weight gain and
development in children with severe acute malnutrition, at least
in the population that we studied.
Our study has several strengths. Developmental testing was
conducted by well-trained clinical staff with the use of estab-
lished protocols (21). In order to minimize missing data, they re-
peated developmental assessments ≤2 times in children whose
status was initially assessed as being untestable. Administration
of study medication was directly observed, ensuring 100% ad-
herence, and the intervention regimen was effective in elevat-
ing 25(OH)D concentrations to >50 nmol/L in all participants
assigned to take it in whom the concentrations were measured.
Rates of loss to follow-up were low.
Our study also has some limitations. We did not conduct
a dose-response study; it therefore remains unclear whether a
lower dose than we administered would be sufficient to boost
weight gain to a similar extent. Although we saw no overt ad-
verse reactions to the high dose of vitamin D administered,
biochemical safety monitoring was restricted to analysis of end-
study serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and calcium in a sub-
set of 90 participants only. End-study 25(OH)D levels exceeded
125 nmol/L in the 12/45 (26.7%) intervention arm participants
in whom they were measured. The possibility of side effects
arising with clinical use of this high dose cannot be excluded.
Another limitation is that we did not assess vitamin D status
at baseline. However, our finding that >40% of participants in
the control arm had end-study circulating 25(OH)D concentra-
tions <50 nmol/L (i.e., despite taking up to 3000 IU vitamin
D/d for 8 wk via ready-to-use therapeutic food) indicates that
baseline vitamin D status is likely to have been very low in
this cohort. The increases in mean weight-for-height or -length
that we observed in both study arms were somewhat larger than
have been reported in other trials (35, 36) whereas mortality was
much lower—likely reflecting the fact that we excluded chil-
dren with complicated severe acute malnutrition. Accordingly,
the proportion of participants gaining >15% of their baseline
weight at 8 wk in the control arm was higher than anticipated,
making it difficult to demonstrate an additional benefit of the
intervention on the primary outcome. The study duration was
also relatively short, and this precluded an assessment of whether
the striking early benefits on anthropometric and developmental
outcomes that we demonstrated could be sustained and translated
into long-term benefits on growth and neuropsychiatric func-
tion.
In summary, we show that administration of high-dose vita-
min D in addition to ready-to-use therapeutic food safely and
significantly enhanced weight gain and developmental status of
children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition living in
Pakistan. Further trials with a longer follow-up in different set-
tings are needed to explore these promising findings.
