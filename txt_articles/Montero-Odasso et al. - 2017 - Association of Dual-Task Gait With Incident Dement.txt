IMPORTANCE Gait performance is affected by neurodegeneration in aging and has the
potential to be used as a clinical marker for progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
to dementia. A dual-task gait test evaluating the cognitive-motor interface may predict
dementia progression in older adults with MCI.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a dual-task gait test is associated with incident dementia in
MCI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Gait and Brain Study is an ongoing prospective
cohort study of community-dwelling older adults that enrolled 112 older adults with MCI.
Participants were followed up for 6 years, with biannual visits including neurologic, cognitive,
and gait assessments. Data were collected from July 2007 to March 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident all-cause dementia was the main outcome
measure, and single- and dual-task gait velocity and dual-task gait costs were the
independent variables. A neuropsychological test battery was used to assess cognition. Gait
velocity was recorded under single-task and 3 separate dual-task conditions using an
electronic walkway. Dual-task gait cost was defined as the percentage change between
single- and dual-task gait velocities: ([single-task gait velocity –dual-task gait velocity]/
single-task gait velocity) × 100. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the
association between risk of progression to dementia and the independent variables, adjusted
for age, sex, education, comorbidities, and cognition.
RESULTS Among 112 study participants with MCI, mean (SD) age was 76.6 (6.9) years, 55
were women (49.1%), and 27 progressed to dementia (24.1%), with an incidence rate of 121
per 1000 person-years. Slow single-task gait velocity (<0.8 m/second) was not associated
with progression to dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 3.41; 95% CI, 0.99-11.71; P = .05) while high
dual-task gait cost while counting backward (HR, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.57-9.15; P = .003) and
naming animals (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.04-5.59; P = .04) were associated with dementia
progression (incidence rate, 155 per 1000 person-years). The models remained robust after
adjusting by baseline cognition except for dual-task gait cost when dichotomized.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dual-task gait is associated with progression to dementia in
patients with MCI. Dual-task gait testing is easy to administer and may be used by clinicians to
decide further biomarker testing, preventive strategies, and follow-up planning in patients
with MCI.

 M
ild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a pre-
dementia state associated with a 10-fold increased
risk of progression to dementia.1 However, almost
one-third of individuals with MCI remain clinically stable af-
ter the initial diagnosis or even revert to normal cognitive
functioning,2 which highlights the hazard of considering pa-
tients with MCI as a homogeneous group.3 This heteroge-
neity of outcomes challenges clinical treatment once MCI is
identified because it is problematic to accurately predict pro-
gression to dementia including Alzheimer disease (AD). To
overcome this challenge, the identification of clinically use-
ful and readily available biomarkers of progression to demen-
tia, including motor markers, is highly needed in MCI.4-7
During the past decade, large cohort studies have shown
thatmotorimpairment,inparticular,slowingofgait,isnotonly
evident early in Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer dementias but
also predicts progression to dementia in the general
population.8-10 Although the main clinical hallmark of MCI is
memory impairment,11 motor dysfunction and gait impair-
ment have been previously described.8,11,12 Few studies have
focused on dual-task gait testing (walking while simultane-
ously performing a cognitive challenge) as a means to deter-
mine the association between cognitive-motor interaction and
risk of progression to dementia in patients with MCI.13,14 Dual-
task gait testing challenges the cognitive component of loco-
motion and can provide insight into the mechanisms of brain
motor control and cognitive performance.13 Mechanistically,
structural and functional brain imaging studies have shown
that cognition and motor control share common brain net-
works, particularly in the prefrontal and temporal areas.13,15-17
Based on the limited capacity model, these networks can be-
come overloaded when a motor task is concurrently per-
formed with a cognitive task, more so in individuals with
cognitive impairment who have less cognitive reserve.13,18
Thedual-taskgaittestisuniqueinthatitreflectsthemotor-
cognitive interface.19-21 There is a linear association between
the magnitude of gait slowing while dual tasking and deficits
in executive, attention, and memory processes in MCI.4,20,22-24
The magnitude of changes in gait during dual-task perfor-
mance owing to a concurrent cognitive challenge can be
expressed as a dual-task gait cost, which adjusts for an indi-
vidual’
s baseline gait characteristics.25 To our knowledge, the
capacity of dual-task gait testing to predict progression to de-
mentia in patients with MCI has not been investigated.
In this study, we examined the longitudinal association of
dual-task gait performance and the incidence of dementia in
a well-characterized MCI cohort with 6 years of follow-up. We
hypothesized that participants who progressed to dementia
would have a higher dual-task cost in gait velocity than par-
ticipants who did not progress to dementia.
Methods
Study Participants
Participants were part of the Gait and Brain Study, an ongoing
prospectivecohortstudydesignedtodeterminewhetherquan-
titative gait deficits can predict incident cognitive and mobil-
ity decline and progression to dementia among community-
dwellingolderadults.Designandlogisticshavebeendescribed
in detail elsewhere.26-28 After written consent was obtained,
participants underwent a comprehensive baseline evalua-
tion as well as biannual assessments during 6 years of follow-
up. For this analysis, participants were required to have at least
2 assessments, including the baseline visit, and to fulfill MCI
diagnostic criteria.3,29 All participants were community-
living adults meeting the following inclusion criteria: age 65
years and older, able to walk 10 m independently without a gait
aid, having MCI as ascertained by scoring 0.5 on the global
rating of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale and satisfying the
following 4 criteria1: (1) subjective cognitive challenges; (2) ob-
jective cognitive impairment in at least 1 of the following cog-
nitive domains: memory, executive function, attention, and
language3,29; (3) preserved activities of daily living30 con-
firmed by a clinician’
s interviews; and (4) absence of demen-
tia using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision).31 Exclusion
criteria included lack of English proficiency, parkinsonism or
any neurologic disorder with residual motor deficits (eg,
stroke), musculoskeletal disorders of lower limbs (eg, severe
osteoarthritisorhistoryofknee/hipreplacement)affectinggait
performance at clinical examination, use of neuroleptics or
benzodiazepines, and major depression. Ethics approval was
obtained from the University of Western Ontario Health Sci-
encesResearchethicsboard,andwritteninformedconsentwas
obtained from participants at enrollment. Data collection oc-
curred between July 2007 and March 2016.
Medical and Cognitive Assessments
Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, chronic
medications, physical activity level, history of falls, and basic
and instrumental activities of daily living were collected using
standardized questionnaires during face-to-face interviews
(Table 1). Study clinicians performed a physical examination
including a neurological examination on all participants.
Global cognition was assessed by using the Mini-Mental
StateExamination32andtheMontrealCognitiveAssessment,33
with alternative test versions used in consecutive assess-
ments to avoid potential learning effects. The Clinical Demen-
tia Rating scale was also performed at all visits.34 A neuropsy-
chological test battery was administered to characterize MCI
Key Points
Question Can dual-task gait testing (assessing gait while
performing a challenging cognitive task) identify patients with
mild cognitive impairment at risk of progression to dementia?
Findings In this cohort study of 112 older adults with mild
cognitive impairment with up to 6 years of follow-up, poor
performance in dual-task gait testing was significantly associated
with a 2- to 3-fold risk of dementia incidence independent of age,
sex, education, comorbidities, and baseline cognition.
Meaning Dual-task gait testing may serve clinicians to detect
patients with mild cognitive impairment at higher risk of
progression to dementia, allowing for optimization of further
biomarker testing and initiation of early interventions.

 subtype and to help ascertain progression to dementia. Ex-
ecutive function was assessed using Trail Making Tests A and
B35; verbal episodic memory using the Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Test36; naming using the Boston Naming Test37; at-
tention using the Digit Span Test (forward and backward), and
working memory using the Letter-Number Sequencing test.38
Impaired cognitive domains were identified using a cutoff of
1.5 SD below the age-adjusted norms.14,39 Participants were
classified as pure amnestic MCI (impairment only in verbal epi-
sodic memory), multidomain amnestic MCI (impairment in
morethan1domainincludingmemory),andnonamnesticMCI
(solely impairment in 1 or more nonmemory domain).14,40
Gait Assessments
Gait velocity within single and dual tasks was assessed using
an electronic walkway (GAITRite System, 600 cm long and 64
cm wide; CIR Systems Inc) that provides data to assess both
spatial and temporal gait parameters.26 Start and end points
were marked on the floor 1 meter from either walkway end to
avoidrecordingaccelerationanddecelerationphases.Eachpar-
ticipant performed 1 practice trial walking on the walkway. For
the single-gait test, participants were asked to walk at their
usual pace in a quiet, well-lit room wearing comfortable foot-
wear and without the use of any mobility aids. For the dual-
task tests, participants walked at their usual pace while doing

100 by ones, (2) subtracting serial sevens from 100, and (3)
naming animals. Rationale for dual-task condition selection
has been described elsewhere.26 To balance and minimize the
effects of learning and fatigue, only 1 trial was performed in
each condition, and the order of single and dual tasks was ran-
domized. Reliability has been previously established for this
protocol in participants with MCI.26 The magnitude of the ef-
fect of the cognitive challenge on gait performance was as-
sessed by calculating the dual-task gait cost (percent) as19:
([single-task gait velocity – dual-task gait velocity] /
single-task gait velocity) × 100
Outcome Variable
Incident dementia was the main end point as determined by
a clinician investigator during follow-up visits per Diagnostic
andStatisticalManualofMentalDisorders(FourthEdition,Text
Revision) criteria31 and when Clinical Dementia Rating in-
creased to a score of 1 or higher. At the time of diagnosis, cli-
nicians were blinded to baseline gait or baseline neuro-
psychologicaltestscores.Thetypeofdementiawasestablished
using standardized clinical criteria for AD dementia,41 fronto-
temporal dementia,42 Lewy body dementia,43 and vascular
dementia.44Participantswerereassessedafter6monthstocon-
firm dementia status and subtype.
Predictor Variables
Gait velocity and dual-task gait cost were our main predictor
variables because they have been previously associated with
cognitiveperformanceinMCIstudies.14,27Thesevariableswere
modeled as continuous variables to ascertain the strength of
associations and as dichotomous variables to identify poten-
tial thresholds to be used in clinics. Slow gait velocity in the
single-task condition was defined as less than 0.8 m/second,
a threshold previously established for predicting adverse
events,includingcognitivedecline,inambulatorypatients.45-47
Becausethereisnotanestablishedcutofffordual-taskgaittest-
ing, receiver operating characteristic curves were produced to
determine the optimal threshold value for high dual-task gait
cost as a predictor of dementia for the 3 dual-tasks condi-
tions.
Covariates
Analyses were adjusted for covariates that included demo-
graphics (age, sex, and educational level), number of comor-
bidities, and baseline cognition.
Statistical Analysis
Demographics and clinical characteristics were summarized
using either means and standard deviations or frequencies and
percentages as appropriate. Comparisons of baseline charac-
teristics between patients with MCI who progressed to de-
mentia and those who did not were made using χ2 or t tests as
deemed appropriate. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards
regression analyses were completed to assess the risk, mea-
sured as hazard ratios (HRs), for progression to dementia for
gait velocity as continuous variables (single- and dual-task gait
velocity and dual-task gait cost) and as dichotomous vari-
ables (slow gait velocity and high dual-task gait cost in each
condition), unadjusted and adjusted for the previously men-
tioned covariates. Dual-task gait cost cutoffs were deter-
mined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Time

at which dementia was diagnosed. Proportional hazards as-
sumption was tested using methods based on scaled Schoen-
feld residuals. To account for different follow-up times, inci-
dent dementia is also presented as incident rate expressed as
“totalperson-yearsatrisk”forallthemodels.Associationswere
also explored by stratifying dual-task gait velocities into quar-
tiles. Statistical significance was set at P < .05 (2-sided). Sta-
tistical analyses were conducted using SPSS, version 23 (IBM
Corporation) and occurred from June 2016 to March 2017.
Results
Participant Characteristics
One hundred twelve participants (mean [SD] age, 76 [6.88]
years; 55 women) were assessed with a mean follow-up of 24
months (range, 12-76 months). Characteristics of the study
sample, stratified by progression to dementia (patients with
MCIwhoprogressedtodementiavsthosewhodidnot)arepre-
sented in Table 1. Ninety-two participants with MCI fulfilled
criteriaforpureamnesticMCIwhile30fulfilledcriteriafornon-
amnestic MCI. A total of 24% of the sample (n = 27; 11 women
[43%]) progressed to dementia, with an overall incidence rate
of121per1000person-years.Fromthe27participantswhopro-
gressedtodementia,23progressedtoAD(85%),2toLewybody
dementia(7%),1tofrontotemporaldementia(4%),and1tovas-
cular dementia (4%).
Table 1 shows that participants with MCI who progressed
to dementia were older and had fewer comorbidities. They had
higher hypertension prevalence (70.4% vs 57.1%) and were
more likely to carry at least 1 apolipoprotein E ε4 allele, al-
thoughthesedifferenceswerenotsignificant.Bothgroupshad
a mean baseline single-gait velocity greater than the normal-
ity cutoff of 0.8 m/second; however, participants who pro-
gressed to dementia had a significantly lower dual-task gait ve-
locity and higher dual-task gait cost in the 3 test conditions.
Associations Between Gait Performance
and Incident Dementia
Table 2 reports the Cox proportional hazard models for our
main outcome, incident dementia, for our 2 predictor vari-
ables, gait velocity and dual-task gait cost, in 1 unadjusted and
2 adjusted models. When modeling our predictors as a con-
tinuous variable, single-gait velocity test failed to predict de-
mentia (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.04; P = .10), while all dual-
task gait velocity tests (velocities and costs) predicted
progression to dementia except for dual-task gait cost in se-
rial sevens subtractions when adjusted for covariates.
Modeling gait velocity as dichotomous variables showed
that slow single-task velocity (<0.8 m/second) was not asso-
ciated with dementia progression (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 0.99-
11.71; P = .05). Alternative slow single-task gait velocity

 cutoffs, determined by receiver operating characteristic analy-
sis (<1.08 m/second) or using 1.5 SD below the cohort mean gait
velocity (<0.76 m/second) were also not associated with de-
mentia progression (eTable 1 in the Supplement). However,
high dual-task cost in gait velocity while counting backward
(HR,3.79;95%CI,1.57-9.15;P = .003)andnaminganimals(HR,
2.41; 95% CI, 1.04-5.59; P = .04) were both associated with
dementia progression (Table 2 and Figure 1A and C). After ad-
justing for baseline cognition (Mini-Mental State Examina-
tion scores, model 3) the associations with progression to de-
mentia were only attenuated for dual-task gait as a
dichotomous variable.
Stratification of the sample into quartiles of dual-task gait
velocity (eTable 2 in the Supplement) showed that partici-
pants in the lowest quartile had the highest risk of progres-
sion to dementia while counting backward (HR, 13.39; 95% CI,
3.76-47.75;P < .001;Figure2A)andwhilenaminganimals(HR,

Sensitivity Analyses
Associations with apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status and
single- and dual-tasking gait performance were explored,
and differences were small and in both directions (eTable 3

dual-task gait (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Ourresultssuggestthatdual-taskgaittestingisassociatedwith
the progression to dementia in a well-characterized cohort of
older adults with MCI. Specifically, a high dual-task gait cost
while counting backward and naming animals was associ-
ated with an increased risk of progression to dementia by 3.8
and 2.4 times, respectively. The predictive ability of single-
task gait performance appeared high although not statisti-
cally significant, revealing the unique utility of dual-task gait
testing in the clinical encounter when assessing patients with
normal gait velocity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study establishing the ability of dual-task gait testing to
detect incident dementia in patients with MCI.4,14,19,26,48-52
Assessing gait velocity is easy to perform and provides an
excellent general measure of overall function. However, dual-
task gait testing can uncover valuable subtleties regarding the
role of cognitive control on a participant’
s gait.45,53-56 It is
also important to note that the single-task gait velocity in
our MCI sample was greater than 0.8 m/second, the thresh-
old recommended to identify slow gait indicative of adverse
events, and consistent with the high functional abilities
seen in the early stages of cognitive decline and with previ-
ous studies assessing gait in MCI.14,25,27 Thus, among these
participants, using solely a slow velocity threshold would
have been insufficient to identify individuals at a high risk
of progression to dementia.
Our results complement the Motoric Cognitive Risk syn-
drome,whereparticipantswithcognitivechallengesandslower
gait had a higher risk of developing dementia,7 by showing that
dual-task gait may predict dementia in participants with MCI
while single-task gait velocity does not. Whether dual-task
changes in gait in patients with MCI is associated with pro-
gressiontovasculardementiaorADisunknown.Previousstud-
iesingeneralpopulationshavesuggestedthatgaitslowingdur-
ingdualtaskingismostlikelyassociatedwithincidentvascular
dementia.7,9 In this study, dual-task gait change was mostly
associated with AD, which can be explained by the fact that
our study focused only in individuals with MCI. Interest-
ingly, emerging evidence is linking gait performance with AD
neurodegenerative changes, as in a 2017 study that showed in
older adults free of dementia that gait performance, includ-
ing dual-task gait, was cross-sectionally associated with amy-
loid β brain deposition,57,58 independent of the burden of vas-
cular changes. Taken together, these data suggest that both
vascularandneurodegenerativechangesmaycontributetode-
mentia progression in patients with MCI with impaired dual-
task gait.59
The underlying mechanisms affecting dual-task gait per-
formance remain not completely understood. What does seem
clear is that executive demands used for gait and for the se-
lected cognitive tasks may share a similar pathogenic mecha-
nism at the brain level.27,60,61 Episodic memory, a cognitive do-
mainthatwasaffectedinallofourparticipantswhoprogressed
todementia,reliesonfrontal-hippocampalcircuitsthatarealso
central for gait control. In addition, gait control also relies on
the prefrontal-striatal networks that are involved in execu-
tive function, which was similarly impaired in all of our par-
ticipants who progressed to dementia.62 Prior imaging brain
studies in MCI revealed that higher dual-task gait cost is as-
sociated with altered neurochemistry and low volume of the
primary motor cortex, which is part of the executive network
circuit of normal locomotion.17,63,64 In the same manner, stride
time correlated negatively with hippocampal neurochemis-
try in MCI,65 which could reflect the role of the hippocampus
in the retrieval of complex foot movement sequences neces-
sary for regular gait patterns.66 Ultimately, these brain cir-
cuitssharedbybothcognitionandmotor-gaitperformancecan
be affected by aging, neurodegenerative, and microvascular
mechanisms, providing a rationale to propose that dual-task
gait testing may serve as a “brain stress test” to detect

 impending cognitive decline in patients with subclinical dam-
age (Figure 3).67
Dementiabiomarkers,includingamyloidβandtauprotein–
related markers, are promising; however, the correlation be-
tween pathologic biomarker load and actual dementia status
lessens with age.21,68 In other words, older patients with MCI
with similar degrees of neuropathology burden may present
different functional and clinical states as they age. This war-
rants expanding the prediction of dementia progression by
adding “functional markers” such as the motor-cognitive
interface.21
Our findings could be easily translated to the clinical set-
ting owing to the simplicity, noninvasive nature, and low cost
of dual-task gait assessment. Our sensitivity analysis showed
that dual-task gait was comparable with cognitive testing to
predict incident dementia, and adjustments for baseline cog-
nition only partially attenuated the associations when mod-
eled as a dichotomous variable, suggesting that dual-task gait
test is providing extra information not captured by cogni-
tive testing. Performances in the 3 dual tasks used were all
associated with a high risk of progression to dementia, pro-
viding flexibility to clinicians to choose the most appropri-
ate dual-task test to cognitively stress a given patient. Clini-
cians may use dual-task gait testing in screening patients
with MCI who could benefit the most from additional test-
ing, optimizing recommendations for imaging, spinal fluid
examinations, and genetic testing. Similarly, our findings
can assist in identifying high-risk individuals with MCI to
plan the frequency of follow-up visits to monitor function.
Finally, dual-task gait testing could help researchers plan
primary prevention or intervention studies in MCI through
the selection of participants at greater risk of decline and
progression to dementia.
Limitations
Our sample was limited to 112 individuals with MCI and with
a relatively low frequency of outcome events (27 progressed
to dementia); however, the event per independent variable ra-
tio for our Cox regression model (27/5 = 5.4) is considered ro-
bust for models with binary end point outcomes.69 Our an-
nual conversion rate to AD was 7%, which is in line with clinic-
based studies, including amnestic MCI, but higher than
population studies; thus, our results are generalizable to clinic-
basedsettingsonly.Quantitativetechniqueswereusedtomea-
sure velocity, which can be a limitation to wide clinical appli-
cability. However, dual-task gait velocity can be simply
measuredusingastopwatch,anddual-taskgaitcostcanbeeas-
ily calculated. Although predictive validity might be im-
proved by considering cognitive errors on dual tasking, that
would make it more difficult to apply in clinics. Finally, our
results need cross-validation in other MCI cohorts. The
strengths of our study include a well-characterized MCI co-
hort with a long period of follow-up and with biannual assess-
ments to adequately monitor time to progression to demen-
tia. We used a validated dual-task protocol on quantitative gait
analysis and standardized assignment of dementia diagnoses
blinded to gait categories, with robust analyses adjusting for
a number of important covariates.
Conclusions
Dual-task gait testing can detect individuals with MCI at in-
creased risk of progression to dementia. Our results support
the hypothesis that cognitive and motor dysfunction in MCI
may reflect a shared pathogenic mechanism at the brain level
and that gait is a candidate motor biomarker of progression to
dementia.13,16,27,70-72 Future studies should confirm whether
addingdual-taskgaittestingtotheclinicalandcognitiveevalu-
ation of patients with MCI can improve dementia prediction.
Cross-validation of this approach in other MCI cohorts would
further support the clinical applicability.
