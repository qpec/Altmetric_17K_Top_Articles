Background: A novel bicycle helmet concept has been developed to mitigate rotational head acceleration, which
is a predominant mechanism of traumatic brain injury (TBI). This WAVECEL concept employs a collapsible
cellular structure that is recessed within the helmet to provide a rotational suspension. This cellular concept
differs from other bicycle helmet technologies for mitigation of rotational head acceleration, such as the com-
mercially available Multi-Directional Impact Protection System (MIPS) technology which employs a slip liner to
permit sliding between the helmet and the head during impact. This study quantified the efficacy of both, the
WAVECEL cellular concept, and a MIPS helmet, in direct comparison to a traditional bicycle helmet made of
rigid expanded polystyrene (EPS).
Methods: Three bicycle helmet types were subjected to oblique impacts in guided vertical drop tests onto an
angled anvil: traditional EPS helmets (CONTROL group); helmets with a MIPS slip liner (SLIP group); and
helmets with a WAVECEL cellular structure (CELL group). Helmet performance was evaluated using 4.8 m/s
impacts onto anvils angled at 30°, 45°, and 60° from the horizontal plane. In addition, helmet performance was
tested at a faster speed of 6.2 m/s onto the 45° anvil. Five helmets were tested under each of the four impact
conditions for each of the three groups, requiring a total of 60 helmets. Headform kinematics were acquired and
used to calculate an injury risk criterion for Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) 2 brain injury.
Results: Linear acceleration of the headform remained below 90 g and was not associated with the risk of skull
fracture in any impact scenario and helmet type. Headform rotational acceleration in the CONTROL group was
highest for 6.2 m/s impacts onto the 45° anvil (7.2 ± 0.6 krad/s2). In this impact scenario, SLIP helmets and
CELL helmets reduced rotational acceleration by 22% (p = 0003) and 73% (p < 0.001), respectively, compared
to CONTROL helmets. The CONTROL group had the highest AIS 2 brain injury risk of 59 ± 8% for 6.2 m/s
impacts onto the 45° anvil. In this impact scenario, SLIP helmets and CELL helmets reduced the AIS 2 brain
injury risk to 34.2% (p = 0.001) and 1.2% (p < 0.001), respectively, compared to CONTROL helmets.
Discussion: Results of this study are limited to a narrow range of impact conditions, but demonstrated the po-
tential that rotational acceleration and the associated brain injury risk can be significantly reduced by the
cellular WAVECEL concept or a MIPS slip liner. Results obtained under specific impact angles and impact ve-
locities indicated performance differences between these mechanisms. These differences emphasize the need for
continued research and development efforts toward helmet technologies that further improve protection from
brain injury over a wide range a realistic impact parameters.
1. Introduction
Bicycle helmets are the primary and most effective strategy for head
protection during impacts to prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI)
(Hoye, 2018). Contemporary bicycle helmets employ a liner of rigid
expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) that dampens the impact, reduces the
impact force, and in turn reduces linear and angular head accelerations
known to cause TBI (McIntosh et al., 2013a). These standard EPS
helmets are highly effective in reducing the risk of skull fracture, pe-
netrating injury, and brain injury (Cripton et al., 2014; Fahlstedt et al.,
2014; McIntosh et al., 2013b). To further improve protection from ro-
tational TBI, several bicycle helmet designs implement dedicated me-
chanisms to mitigate rotational head acceleration (Aare and Halldin,
2003; Bland et al., 2018; Fahlstedt et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2013).
These mechanisms generally fall into two categories. The first category
employs a spherical slip interface inside the helmet. For example, the

 Multi-Directional Impact Protection System (MIPS® AB, Täby, Sweden)
consists of a thin slip liner that covers the inside of the helmet. This
commercially available technology seeks to reduce rotational accel-
eration of the head by permitting sliding between the helmet and head
during impact. The second category employs a collapsible structure that
seeks to reduce the shear stiffness of the helmet (Hansen et al., 2013).
While not yet commercially available, the present paper evaluates such
a collapsible cellular structure that is recessed within the helmet to
provide a rotational suspension. This WAVECEL™ cellular structure re-
presents an extension of earlier research by Hansen et al. on an angular
impact mitigation system (Hansen et al., 2013).
In common, these mechanisms aim to reduce rotational head ac-
celeration caused by an oblique impact in order to further improve
protection from rotational TBI (Sone et al., 2017). The potential ben-
efits of these mechanisms are based on a large body of research,
showing that concussions and TBI can readily be caused by rotational
head acceleration which subjects brain tissues to shear forces and re-
sults in diffuse axonal injury (Gennarelli, 1993; Gutierrez et al., 2001;
Holbourn, 2019; Ivarsson et al., 2003; King et al., 1995; Ommaya et al.,
2002; Post and Blaine Hoshizaki, 2015; Sahoo et al., 2016).
The majority of real-world “oblique” impacts of helmeted bicyclists
occur at impact angles of 30°- 60° degrees (Bourdet et al., 2012, 2014;
Otte, 1989). These oblique impacts induce both radial and tangential
forces to the head, leading to both linear and rotational head accel-
eration (McIntosh et al., 2013b; Willinger et al., 2014). The mandatory
test of the Consumer Protection Safety Commission (CPSC) for bicycle
helmets sold in the U.S. only captures linear acceleration resulting from
vertical impacts, whereby the headform is constrained from rotation
(CPSC, 1998). Since this CPSC impact-attenuation test does not assess
rotational acceleration, it is not suitable to evaluate the efficacy of
mechanisms designed to mitigate rotational head acceleration in ob-
lique impacts. Therefore, an advanced helmet impact test method is
required to simulate oblique impacts, and to assess the resulting linear
and rotational accelerations of a test headform. A wide range of oblique
impact test methods have been developed, including impact testing by
guided free-fall onto an angled anvil (Bland et al., 2018; Finan et al.,
2008; Hansen et al., 2013; Klug et al., 2015; Milne et al., 2013), vertical
drops onto a laterally translating impact surface (Aare and Halldin,
2003; McIntosh et al., 2013b; Mills and Gilchrist, 2008) and pendulum
impact tests (Bartsch et al., 2012; Rowson et al., 2015). These oblique
impact tests frequently employ a Hybrid III 50th percentile male an-
thropomorphic head and neck combination (Bartsch et al., 2012; Bland
et al., 2018; Hansen et al., 2013; McIntosh et al., 2013b; Post and Blaine
Hoshizaki, 2015).
The present study employed an advanced helmet impact test
method, based on a guided free-fall of a Hybrid III head and neck
surrogate, to conduct oblique impact tests and to assess mitigation of
linear and rotational head acceleration provided by different helmet
technologies. Specifically, this study assessed impact mitigation of
prototype helmets with the WAVECEL concept, and commercially
available helmets with a MIPS slip liner, in direct comparison to stan-
dard EPS helmets for specific impact angles and velocities (Bourdet
et al., 2012, 2014). Results of the study were used to test the hypothesis
that the mechanisms for impact absorption of WAVECEL and MIPS
helmets can provide improved mitigation of rotational acceleration
compared to standard EPS bicycle helmets.
2. Methods
2.1. Helmets
Three bicycle helmet types were evaluated: standard EPS helmets
(CONTROL group), helmets with a MIPS slip liner (SLIP group), and
prototype helmets with a WAVECEL cellular structure (CELL group).
For the CONTROL group, 20 standard bicycle helmets (Scott ARX,
www.scott-sports.com) were tested. These midrange helmets had an in-
molded polycarbonate micro-shell and a standard expanded poly-
styrene (EPS) liner (Fig. 1A). The single-density EPS liner had no em-
bedded reinforcement structures. For the SLIP group, 20 helmets with a
MIPS slip liner (Scott ARX Plus, www.scott-sports.com) were tested
(Fig. 1B). These helmets were identical to CONTROL helmets, with the
exception of the additional slip liner. The Scott ARX Plus was the
highest-scoring helmet of Consumer Reports’ 2016 Bike Helmet Ratings
(Consumer Reports, 2016). This helmet was selected for the present
study to represent a leading mid-priced bicycle helmet. For the CELL
group, 20 additional Scott ARX helmets were obtained and modified to
implement the cellular WAVECEL structure without affecting the
overall thickness of the helmet (Fig. 1C). A 15 mm thick portion of the
EPS material was removed by a programmable milling machine from
the inside of the helmet, leaving approximately 10 mm of the original
outer EPS shell. The 15 mm thick cellular structure was placed inside
the machined recess to restore the original helmet thickness. At the
helmet front, the cellular structure extended approximately 12 mm
below the impact line specified in the CPSC impact test for the ISO J
headform (CPSC, 1998).
This cellular liner has a specifically designed cell structure to pro-
vide distinct mechanisms for absorption of radial and tangential impact
forces. For radial impact forces, each cell has a transverse crease to
support organized cell buckling. For oblique impact forces, cells can
fold in shear direction and the structure can elastically deform in-plane
to serve as a rotational suspension between the head and the outer
helmet shell. All helmets had the same retention system, outer shell,
and overall liner thickness. CONTROL, SLIP, and CELL helmets had an
average weight of 208 ± 4 g, 233 ± 6 g, and 282 ± 4 g, respectively.
2.2. Test setup
Helmet testing was conducted at the Helmet Impact Testing (HIT)
facility of the Portland Biomechanics Laboratory (Fig. 2A). In absence
of an accepted standard for oblique impact testing of bicycle helmets,
the HIT facility was designed to follow recommendations of a recent
publication on advanced methods for oblique impact testing (Willinger
et al., 2014) and closely corresponds to several published methods of
vertical drops onto oblique anvils (Bland et al., 2018; Finan et al., 2008;
Hansen et al., 2013). Specific recommendations that were implemented
from the publication included: the use of a Hybrid III anthropomorphic
headform, which has a more realistic mass and inertia than ISO head
forms (Willinger et al., 2014) and which provides a skin cover; (Klug
et al., 2015) a Hybrid III neck, which can readily be attached to the
headform; (Bartsch et al., 2012; Willinger et al., 2014) assessment of
linear and rotational headform acceleration; impact angles in the range
of 30°–60° (Bourdet et al., 2012, 2014; Otte, 1989); an impact surface
with 80 grit sandpaper according to ECE R-22.05 (ECE, 1999); and
inclusion of an impact velocity greater than 6 m/s onto a 45° anvil to
better account for real world accident analysis (Bourdet et al., 2012,
2014; Klug et al., 2015; Willinger et al., 2014).
Accordingly, the HIT facility employed a Hybrid III 50th percentile
male
anthropomorphic
head
and
neck
surrogate
(78051-336,
Humanetic Innovative Solutions, Plymouth, MI) that was connected to a
vertical drop tower rail (Fig. 2B). The weight of the drop assembly was
14.0 kg, including the Hybrid III head and neck surrogate and its
structural connection to the drop rail, but excluding the helmet. A flat
anvil adjustable from 30° to 60° was used to induce oblique impacts in
response to vertical drops. Linear head acceleration was captured with
a three-axis linear accelerometer (356B21 ICP Triaxial, PCB Piezo-
tronics, Depew, NY) mounted at the center of gravity of the Hybrid III
head (Fig. 2B). The resultant linear acceleration ar was calculated from
the three linear acceleration components. Rotational acceleration αy
and rotational velocity ωy of the headform around the transverse y-axis
were measured with a rotational accelerometer (#8838, Kistler In-
struments Corp., Amherst, NY). Assessment of headform rotation was
limited to rotation around the transverse y-axis, since all impacts were

 centered onto the sagittal midline of the helmet and the anvil surface
was aligned parallel to the headform transverse axis (Hansen et al.,
2013). Impact velocity was measured with a time gate (#5012 Velo-
cimeter, Cadex Inc., Quebec, CA).
Five helmets of each group were tested at 4.8 m/s impact speed on
30°, 45°, and 60° inclined anvils, and additionally at 6.2 m/s on the 45°
anvil (Fig. 3). The impact speeds, but not the impact angles, represent
those specified in the bicycle helmet safety standard §1203 of the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) (CPSC, 1998). As is
commonly employed in helmet testing with Hybrid III head surrogates,
a double-layer of thin nylon stocking was fitted over the headform to
better represent the surface of the human head by reducing the in-
herently high friction of the Hybrid III silicone scalp (Allison et al.,
2014; Jadischke et al., 2016; Pellman et al., 2003; Takhounts et al.,
2008). Helmets were properly fitted to the headform with their original
fit system. Before each test, new 80 grit sandpaper was applied to the
anvil surface (ECE, 1999).
2.3. Data acquisition and analysis
Accelerometer data were captured at a sample rate of 20 kHz in a
data acquisition system (PCI-6221, National Instruments, Austin, TX).
Accelerations were low-pass filtered at Channel Frequency Class (CFC)
1000, as specified by SAE J211 (Instrumentation for impact test, 2007).
Rotational velocity ωy was calculated in LabVIEW software using tra-
pezoidal integration of rotational acceleration data.
To estimate the probability of brain injury, the revised Brain Injury
Criterion (BrIC) was calculated for each impact, based on peak
Fig. 1. Three helmet types with identical outer shell and liner thickness were tested: A) Standard EPS helmets (CONTROL); B) helmets with a MIPS slip liner for
mitigation of rotational acceleration (SLIP); and C) helmets with a cellular structure for mitigation of linear and rotational acceleration (CELL). Sectioned EPS areas
along transverse cut (A-A) and sagittal cut (B-B) are outlined in white for illustration. Impact locations corresponding to the 30°, 45°, and 60° anvils are denoted by
red dots on sagittal cross-sections. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).

 rotational velocity of the headform (Takhounts et al., 2013). BrIC is an
injury criterion based on headform kinematics that was specifically
developed for anthropomorphic test devices, including the Hybrid III
50th percentile male head used in the present study. The updated BrIC
version provides a critical value (ωcr) for rotational velocity around the
transverse y-axis of 56.45 rad/s when using a Hybrid III headform
(Takhounts et al., 2013). Therefore, BrIC was calculated according to
the following equation (Eq. (1)):
BrIC = ωy, max / (56.45 rad/s)
(1)
The probability of sustaining an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) 2
brain injury was than calculated according to Eq. (2) by implementing
the resulting BrIC value into the corresponding brain injury risk
correlation, based on maximal principal strain: (Takhounts et al., 2013)

A brain injury of severity AIS 2 is defined as a mild-to-moderate
concussion with loss of consciousness of less than 1 h (AAAM, 2008).
For statistical analysis, headform kinematics (ar, αy, ωy) and the
head injury criterion P(AIS 2) of the SLIP and CELL groups were com-
pared to the CONTROL group using two-sided Student’s t-tests and
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons to test the stated hy-
potheses. A value of α = 0.05 was used for the evaluation of statistical
significance.

 3. Results
Impact conditions and outcome parameters for each impact scenario
and helmet type are summarized in Table 1.
3.1. Linear acceleration
SLIP helmets did not significantly reduce linear acceleration ar
compared to CONTROL helmets for any impact scenario (Fig. 4A). CELL
helmets significantly reduced linear acceleration compared to CON-
TROL helmets only for slow impacts, with reductions ranging from 16%
(60° anvil) to 26% (30° anvil).
3.2. Rotational acceleration
SLIP helmets significantly reduced rotational acceleration ar com-
pared to CONTROL helmets in all impact scenarios (Fig. 4B), with re-
ductions ranging from 21% (30° slow impact) to 44% (45° slow impact).
CELL helmets significantly reduced rotational acceleration compared to
CONTROL helmets in all impact scenarios, with reductions ranging
from 34% (60° slow impact) to 73% (45° fast impact).
3.3. Rotational velocity
SLIP helmets significantly reduced rotational velocity ωy compared
to CONTROL helmets in all impact scenarios (Fig. 4C), with reductions
ranging from 15% (30° slow impact) to 67% (60° slow impact). CELL
helmets significantly reduced ωy compared to CONTROL helmets in all
impact scenarios, with reductions ranging from 50% (30° slow impact)
to 84% (45° fast impact).
3.4. Brain injury risk prediction
SLIP helmets significantly reduced the probability P(AIS 2) of sus-
taining AIS 2 brain injury compared to CONTROL helmets in all impact
scenarios (Fig. 4D), with reductions ranging from 32% (30° slow im-
pact) to 91% (60° slow impact). CELL helmets significantly reduced P
(AIS 2) compared to CONTROL helmets in all impact scenarios, with
reductions ranging from 81% (30° slow impact) to 98% (45° fast im-
pact).
4. Discussion
Results of this study demonstrated the potential of two helmet
technologies to reduce the rotational acceleration of a Hybrid III head
surrogate compared to a control helmet. The results show potential in
reducing the risk of rotational TBI. Furthermore, the results suggest that
the efficacy by which the SLIP and CELL technologies provide improved
protection depends on the impact angle and impact velocity. Since
these findings are limited to a specific combination of impact speeds
and impact angles, further investigations are warranted to explore
higher impact severities accounting for bicycle falls at higher speeds
and for collisions with automobiles.
Results of conventional CONTROL group helmets demonstrated that
linear acceleration was effectively suppressed to a maximum of 87 g
(30° anvil, 4.8 m/s). This linear acceleration is far below the 300 g
linear acceleration threshold mandated by the CPCS safety standard
(CPSC, 1998). These results closely correlate with an average linear
acceleration of 89 g reported by Bland et al. for oblique impact tests of
10 different helmet models onto a 30° anvil at 5.1 m/s (Bland et al.,
2018). In contrast to the fixed vertical orientation of the Hybrid III head
and neck assembly in the present study, their head-neck assembly was
adjustable about two axes to consistently target specific impact loca-
tions on the helmet front and sides. While they employed the same
Hybrid III neck than the present study, they used a National Operating
Committee of Standard for Athletic Equipment (NOCASE) headform.
They reported average rotational accelerations as high as 6.4 krad/s2
and 9.5 krad/s2 for resultant impact speeds of 5.1 m/s and 6.6 m/s,
respectively. Similarly, the present study found rotational accelerations
as high as 7.2 krad/s2 (45° anvil, 6.2 m/s) for CONTROL helmets, re-
sulting in a 59% probability of AIS 2 brain injury. These results confirm
the growing recognition that contemporary bicycle helmets can effec-
tively prevent skull fractures, but may not be as effective in mitigating
rotationally-induced brain injury (Sone et al., 2017).
For SLIP helmets, the slip liner had no significant effect on linear
headform acceleration, as a slip liner is not designed to mitigate radial
impact forces. However, by permitting sliding between the helmet and
the head during impact, the slip liner significantly reduced rotational
headform acceleration to a maximum of 5.7 krad/s2 (45° anvil, 6.2 m/
s). This was associated with a significant reduction in the probability of
AIS 2 injury compared to CONTROL helmets. In the study by Bland
et al., two of the 10 helmet model that were tested contained MIPS slip

 liners (Bland et al., 2018). These two MIPS helmet models resulted in an
average rotational headform acceleration of 6.0 krad/s2, while the
average rotational acceleration of the 8 helmet models without MIPS
liner was 5.3 krad/s2. Accordingly, the authors stated that “the two
helmet models containing MIPS did not appear to provide superior protection
compared to the non-MIPS helmets” (Bland et al., 2018). Therefore, while
the SLIP group demonstrated significant benefits of MIPS liners relative
to standard helmets in the present study, the limited degree by which
this slip liner mitigated rotational head acceleration warrants explora-
tion of alternative strategies. Furthermore, the impact performance
gains of SLIP group helmets came at the cost of a 12% increase in
helmet weight compared to CONTROL group helmets.
CELL group results demonstrated a significant reduction in linear
acceleration by up to 26% (30° anvil, 4.8 m/s) compared to the
CONTROL group. This finding suggested that controlled buckling of an
organized cellular structure may have attenuated radial impacts better
than compression of traditional EPS foam (Bland et al., 2018). Cellular
honeycomb structures for protective helmets have been previously ex-
plored, since they can deliver controlled energy absorption in a light-
weight structure that also permits heat transfer and airflow (Caccese
et al., 2013; Caserta et al., 2011; Hansen et al., 2013). In the compar-
ison study of 10 bicycle helmet models by Bland et al, the highest-
ranked model was the only helmet that incorporated a honeycomb
structure (Bland et al., 2018). The finding that CELL helmets did not
significantly affect linear acceleration in 6.2 m/s impacts suggests that
the compressive stiffness of the cellular liner could potentially be
modified to enhance mitigation of radial impact forces over a wider
range of impact speeds. More importantly, CELL helmets reduced ro-
tational acceleration to well below 4 krad/s2 in all tests. As a result, the
probability of AIS 2 injury did not exceed 8%, regardless of the test
condition. The observed mitigation of rotational acceleration with CELL
helmets can be attributed to two unique features of the cellular struc-
ture. First, each cell has a geometric feature that allows the cell to fold
on its side in a shear manner as a means to absorb shear loading be-
tween the outer helmet shell and the head. Second, the cellular struc-
ture can undergo elastic in-plane deformation to provide a rotational
suspension that decouples the head from the helmet shell. An earlier
attempt of employing a cellular structure as a rotational suspension
system in bicycle helmets has been introduced by Hansen et al in the
form of an Angular Impact Mitigation (AIM) system, comprised of an
elastically suspended aluminum honeycomb liner (Hansen et al., 2013).
In vertical drop tests at 4.8 m/s onto a 30° anvil, their cellular structure
reduced linear acceleration by 14%, rotational acceleration by 34%,
and neck loading by up to 32% compared to a traditional EPS bicycle
helmet. In combination, these findings suggest that elastic suspension of
a properly designed cellular structure has the potential to reduce ro-
tational acceleration and brain injury risk. These impact performance
gains of CELL group helmets came at a cost of a 36% increase in helmet
weight compared to CONTROL group helmets. Since helmet weight is
critical for consumer adoption, integration of CELL technology into a
consumer product should focus on minimizing the associated weight
increase. To investigate if CELL helmets can adequately mitigate radial
impacts, they were also evaluated in CPSC-compliant impact mitigation
tests. Impacts were performed centered on the helmet crown onto a flat
anvil at 6.2 m/s (n = 5) and onto a hemispherical anvil at 4.8 m/s
(n = 5). Impacts onto the horizontal anvil resulted in 207 ± 2 g, and
impacts onto the hemispherical anvil resulted in 100 ± 9 g. While
these results fall short of a formal CPSC impact mitigation test, they
further support the feasibility of the CELL concept by demonstrating
that CELL prototype helmets mitigated linear acceleration well below
the 300 g threshold mandated by CPSC (CPSC, 1998).
Results of this study described the performance of two helmet
strategies for mitigation of rotational acceleration in direct comparison
to a traditional EPS helmet design, tested at three impact angles and
two impact speeds in the same helmet design. Results are therefore
limited to these specific study parameters and may not be extrapolated
outside the tested parameter range. The test setup and parameters were
selected to align as much as possible with established test standards and
precedence from similar studies to facilitate reproduction of the test
setup in other test facilities. Specifically, impact testing by guided free-
fall onto an angled anvil (Bland et al., 2018; Finan et al., 2008; Hansen
et al., 2013; Klug et al., 2015; Milne et al., 2013) was chosen over
vertical drops onto a laterally translating impact surface (Aare and
Halldin, 2003; McIntosh et al., 2013b; Mills and Gilchrist, 2008) or
pendulum impact tests (Bartsch et al., 2012; Rowson et al., 2015) for its
greater simplicity and high reproducibility (Aare and Halldin, 2003).
The Hybrid III 50th percentile male anthropomorphic head was chosen,
since it readily allows for sensor integration and Hybrid III neck at-
tachment. It furthermore provides an elastic skin envelope, and its in-
ertial properties are considerably more biofidelic than that of ISO
headforms specified in the CPSC safety standard (Willinger et al.,
2014). While there is also precedence for impact testing using an

 unconstrained headform without a neck surrogate (Finan et al., 2008;
Klug et al., 2015; Mills and Gilchrist, 2008; Milne et al., 2013), the
present study simulated quasi-physiologic head constraints with a Hy-
brid III neck (Bland et al., 2018). The Hybrid III neck was specifically
developed and validated for flexion and extension, but has been shown
to be overly stiff in lateral bending (Sances et al., 2002). Moreover, the
axial stiffness of the Hybrid III neck has been found to be significantly
higher than that of cadaveric neck specimens (Yoganandan et al.,
1989). The Hybrid III head and neck combination has been used in a
range of helmet impact studies (Bartsch et al., 2012; Bland et al., 2018;
Hansen et al., 2013; McIntosh et al., 2013b; Post and Blaine Hoshizaki,
2015) and has been proposed for advanced testing of bicycle helmets
(Willinger et al., 2014). The experimental design was limited to impact
locations at the helmet front, for which reason results cannot be ex-
trapolated to other impact locations. While the helmet front is the most
commonly impacted region, such frontal impacts typically occur at a
lateral offset within a 60 ° arc from the mid-sagittal plane (Ching et al.,
1997). A mid-sagittal impact location was chosen to simplify the impact
kinematics, and to match the impact scenarios in previously published
studies (Aare and Halldin, 2003; Finan et al., 2008; Hansen et al., 2013;
Ivarsson et al., 2003; Mills and Gilchrist, 2008). While the experimental
design was limited to one frontal impact location per impact angle, this
impact location shifted toward the helmet rim for the 60° anvil and
toward the helmet crown for the 30° anvil since the Hybrid III surrogate
retained the same vertical orientation in all impact scenarios. An ana-
lysis of 696 retrieved bicycle helmets found that 47% of impacts at the
helmet front occurred close to the rim, similar to the 60° anvil test in the
present study, and 37% of impacts at the helmet front occurred in the
mid-section between the rim and the crown, similar to the 30° and 45°
anvil tests (Ching et al., 1997). Impact angles were chosen to represent
the 30°- 60° range determined from reconstruction of real-world bicycle
accidents (Aare and Halldin, 2003; Bourdet et al., 2012, 2014). The
slow (4.8 m/s) and fast (6.2 m/s) impact speeds of the present study
align with the impact speeds specified in the CPSC standard for impact
testing on curbstone anvils (4.8 m/s) and flat anvils (6.2 m/s) (CPSC,
1998). The 4.8 m/s impacts onto the 30°, 45°, and 60° anvil were
comprised of tangential speed components of 2.4 m/s, 3.4 m/s, and
4.2 m/s, and normal speed components of 4.2 m/s, 3.4 m/s, and 2.4 m/
s, respectively. The 6.2 m/s impacts onto the 45° anvil were comprised
of tangential and normal speed components of 4.4 m/s. These impact
speeds are lower than the average impact speeds of 6.4–6.9 m/s re-
ported for helmeted head impacts with a car or the road, which had
average tangential and normal speed components of 5.5 m/s and 3.4 m/
s, respectively (Bourdet et al., 2012, 2014; McIntosh et al., 2013a). The
14.0 kg weight of the drop assembly in the present study was greater
than the 5 ± 1 kg weight requirement for a CPSC drop assembly.
However, it was lighter than the drop assembly of Bland et al, in which
a 16 kg weight was added to the head and neck assembly to simulate
torso mass (Bland et al., 2018).
In addition to limitations due to simplified simulation of real-world
impacts under reproducible laboratory conditions, further limitations
must be considered when predicting brain injury risk from impact ki-
nematics data. Headform kinematics was analyzed to calculate BrIC
from peak rotational velocity. However, prediction of brain injury risk
from BrIC depends on the accuracy of injury risk curves that have been
reconstructed from a limited number of real-world injury data to esti-
mate brain tolerance limits. Moreover, these injury risk curves are
highly non-linear, for which reason a relatively small difference in peak
rotational velocity can translate into a large difference in injury prob-
ability (Bland et al., 2018). The uncertainty in defining brain tolerance
limits combined with the non-linear nature of injury risk curves ne-
cessarily limits the accuracy in predicting an absolute probability of
brain injury. However, relative differences in brain injury probability
between helmet technologies should provide a meaningful comparison,
since the helmet technologies were tested in the same helmet model
under defined and reproducible impact conditions. Nevertheless, future
studies will be required to expand the parameter range of impact con-
ditions, and to include additional helmet technologies.
5. Conclusions
Low linear acceleration results suggest that traditional EPS bicycle
helmets are highly effective in preventing skull fractures (Cripton et al.,
2014; McIntosh et al., 2013b). Conversely, high rotational acceleration
results similarly suggest that these helmets have not been optimized to
reduce rotational head acceleration in oblique impacts. Since axonal
shear strain caused by rotational acceleration is a predominant me-
chanism of injury in concussions (Meaney and Smith, 2011), strategies
for improved helmet designs should therefore target mitigation of ro-
tational acceleration. Results of SLIP and CELL group helmets demon-
strated the potential that rotational acceleration of a headform can be
significantly reduced by these helmet technologies. Differences in the
efficacy between these technologies emphasize the need for continued
research and development efforts of helmet technologies that provide
improved protection from brain injury over a wide range a realistic
impact parameters.
