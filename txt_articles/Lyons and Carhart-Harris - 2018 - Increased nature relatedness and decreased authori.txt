Introduction
A growing body of evidence suggests that classical psychedelic 
compounds such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016b; Schmid and Liechti, 2017), psilocybin 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a; Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 
2016) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in ayahuasca (Osorio 
Fde et al., 2015) can promote enduring changes in personality 
traits, attitudes and beliefs – and similar effects have recently 
been 
reported 
for 
3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine 
(MDMA), which shares some properties with classical psyche-
delic compounds (Wagner et al., 2017) albeit with some impor-
tant differences (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017). Focusing more 
specifically on psilocybin, a single high dose of this naturally 
occurring compound was associated with enduring increases in 
trait openness, psychological wellbeing and life satisfaction in 
healthy volunteers 14 months later (Griffiths et al., 2008; 
MacLean et al., 2011). Psilocybin has also been shown to improve 
symptoms of addiction (Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 
2014), anxiety (Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob et al., 2011; Moreno 
et al., 2006; Ross et al., 2016) and depression (Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2016a; Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016) when 
administered in a psychologically supportive setting.
In the general population, psychedelic drug use is not associ-
ated with increased incidence of mental health problems 
(Johansen and Krebs, 2015; Krebs and Johansen, 2013), but is 
instead associated with lower rates of suicidality and psychologi-
cal distress (Hendricks et al., 2015a, 2015b; Johansen and Krebs, 
2015; Krebs and Johansen, 2013). Psychedelic drug users have 
also been shown to exhibit greater optimism (or reduced pessi-
mism) than non-users (Grob et al., 1996) as well as increased 
concern for others, nature and the environment when compared 
with users of cannabis, amphetamine or heroin (Lerner and 
Lyvers, 2006). Experience with psychedelics has been found to 
positively affect one’s sense of feeling part of nature rather than 
separate from it, leading to pro-environmental behavioural 
changes (Forstmann and Sagioglou, 2017). Nature relatedness, 
defined as the subjective sense of connection with the natural 
environment, is associated with lower levels of anxiety (Capaldi

Abstract
Rationale: Previous research suggests that classical psychedelic compounds can induce lasting changes in personality traits, attitudes and beliefs in 
both healthy subjects and patient populations.
Aim: Here we sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin on nature relatedness and libertarian–authoritarian political perspective in patients with 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD).
Methods: This open-label pilot study with a mixed-model design studied the effects of psilocybin on measures of nature relatedness and libertarian–
authoritarian political perspective in patients with moderate to severe TRD (n=7) versus age-matched non-treated healthy control subjects (n=7). 
Psilocybin was administered in two oral dosing sessions (10 mg and 25 mg) 1 week apart. Main outcome measures were collected 1 week and 
7–12 months after the second dosing session. Nature relatedness and libertarian–authoritarian political perspective were assessed using the Nature 
Relatedness Scale (NR-6) and Political Perspective Questionnaire (PPQ-5), respectively.
Results: Nature relatedness significantly increased (t(6)=−4.242, p=0.003) and authoritarianism significantly decreased (t(6)=2.120, p=0.039) for the 
patients 1 week after the dosing sessions. At 7–12 months post-dosing, nature relatedness remained significantly increased (t(5)=−2.707, p=0.021) 
and authoritarianism remained decreased at trend level (t(5)=−1.811, p=0.065). No differences were found on either measure for the non-treated 
healthy control subjects.
Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that psilocybin with psychological support might produce lasting changes in attitudes and beliefs. Although 
it would be premature to infer causality from this small study, the possibility of drug-induced changes in belief systems seems sufficiently intriguing 
and timely to deserve further investigation.

et al., 2014; Martyn and Brymer, 2014), and has been shown to 
promote psychological wellbeing at both the trait (Cervinka 
et al., 2012; Howell et al., 2011; Mayer and Frantz, 2004; Nisbet 
et al., 2011) and state (Mayer et al., 2008; Nisbet and Zelenski, 
2011) level. Furthermore, interacting with the natural environ-
ment has been shown to improve mood and cognitive functioning 
in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Berman et al., 
2012), and visits to outdoor green spaces of 30 min or more per 
week has been predicted to reduce the population prevalence of 
depression by up to 7% (Shanahan et al., 2016). Taken together, 
these findings indicate that psychedelics can promote enduring 
changes in personality traits, attitudes and beliefs.
A recent correlational study of ours found that lifetime psy-
chedelic drug use in the general population positively predicted 
nature relatedness and negatively predicted authoritarian politi-
cal views, in a manner that appeared to be mediated by acute and 
temporary ‘ego-dissolution’ (Nour et al., 2017). Moreover, a 
recent pilot study of ours found rapid and enduring reductions in 
depressive symptoms in a treatment-resistant depression (TRD) 
sample after psychologically supported psilocybin therapy 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2018a). As part of this project, the present 
research sought to address potential changes in nature relatedness 
and political perspective in this sample of TRD patients before 
versus after psilocybin treatment. Measures were collected at 
screening, 1 week and 7–12 months post-dosing. To demonstrate 
robustness to order confounds, we also collected data from an 
age-matched but non-treated healthy control group, tested over 
an equivalent period.
Methods
Ethical approvals
This study received a favourable opinion from NRES London-
West London, was sponsored by Imperial College London, and 
was carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 
Guidelines. The National Institute for Health Research/Wellcome 
Trust Imperial Clinical Research Facility (ICRF) provided site-
specific approval and the Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reviewed and approved this 
research. All patients provided written informed consent.
Study design and participants
This open-label pilot study with a mixed-model design compared 
the effects of psilocybin on nature relatedness and libertarian–
authoritarian political perspective in patients with TRD versus 
healthy control subjects. The findings presented here are part of a 
larger open-label pilot study of psilocybin in TRD, the results of 
which have been reported elsewhere (Carhart-Harris et al., 
2016a, 2017). The study participants (n=14) and research team 
were not masked to treatment assignment. All TRD patients 
(n=7) were administered psilocybin in two dosing sessions: an 
initial safety dose (10 mg) and a subsequent treatment dose (25 
mg) 1 week later. The control subjects (n=7) were not adminis-
tered psilocybin and were primarily included to examine test–
retest data on the relevant primary measures.
General practitioners were provided with recruitment infor-
mation via the North West London Clinical Research Network 
and were asked to identify potential patients with TRD. TRD 
patients residing in the UK were also able to self-refer to the 
study. In most cases, it was the TRD patients that initiated contact 
with the research team. After initiating contact, patients were 
given a study information sheet and were initially screened via a 
telephone call with the research team’s lead psychiatrist to deter-
mine eligibility for the study. Each patient’s general practitioner 
or psychiatrist provided written confirmation and documentation 
of the patient’s diagnosis and mental health background.
The inclusion criteria were (a) MDD of a moderate to severe 
degree (16+ on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale 
[HAM-D]), and (b) no improvement despite two adequate courses 
of antidepressant treatment of different pharmacological classes 
lasting at least six weeks within the current depressive episode. 
The exclusion criteria were (a) current or previously diagnosed 
psychotic disorder, (b) first-degree relative with a diagnosed psy-
chotic disorder, (c) medically significant condition rendering 
unsuitability for the study, (d) history of serious suicide attempts 
(requiring hospitalisation), (e) previous manic episode, (f) blood or 
needle phobia, (g) positive pregnancy test at screening or during 
the study, and (h) current drug or alcohol dependence.
Physically and mentally healthy age-matched control subjects 
were recruited via word of mouth and were subject to the same 
exclusion criteria outlined above. Informed consent was obtained 
from all of the study participants, including the controls.
Drug
Psilocybin was obtained from THC Pharm GmbH (Frankfurt, 
Germany) and formulated by Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals’ 
Pharmacy Manufacturing Unit (London, UK). Home Office 
approvals for storing and dispensing Schedule One drugs were 
obtained.
Procedures and dosing sessions
Screening procedures typically lasted 4 h and consisted of psy-
chiatric and physical health assessments. All patients provided 
written informed consent. Clinicians carried out a Mini-
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al., 1998) 
and assessed depression severity using the HAM-D (Hamilton, 
1960) and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979) in patient partici-
pants. Physical assessments included an electrocardiogram, rou-
tine blood tests, blood pressure and heart rate tests, and a physical 
examination. Eligible TRD patients were allocated two psychia-
trists for support throughout the study.
All patients enrolled in the study attended a pre-dosing pre-
paratory session with the allocated psychiatrists on the next visit. 
Psychological preparation consisted of discussing the effects of 
psilocybin and simulating aspects of the dosing session to make 
patients aware of what to expect. Patients also shared their per-
sonal history and thoughts on the origins of their depression. This 
session helped to build rapport and trust between the patient and 
their allocated psychiatrists, thus minimising the risk of adverse 
reactions to psilocybin (Metzner et al., 1965).
All patients attended two dosing sessions separated by 1 week 
at the ICRF. A close friend or relative accompanied each patient 
to and from the ICRF and return transport was arranged before 
the dosing sessions took place. A urine sample for drugs of abuse 
(and pregnancy where applicable), breathalyser test for alcohol

use and vital signs measurements were collected before each dos-
ing session. Patients were then taken to a decorated dosing room 
with dim lighting and music where they were invited to lie down 
and relax. The allocated psychiatrists remained at either side of 
the bed and adopted a non-directive, supportive approach. 
Patients were supervised at all times and the psychiatrists checked 
how they were feeling at approximately 1 h intervals, and 
assessed them for discharge approximately 6 h after drug 
administration.
Outcome measures
To assess political views on the dimension of libertarianism to 
authoritarianism, a recently validated (Nour et al., 2017) subset 
of questions (five items) from the Libertarian-Authoritarian 
Questionnaire (Evans et al., 1996) were used as a short version 
and termed the Political Perspective Questionnaire (PPQ-5) 
(Nour et al., 2017). The validated 6-item Nature Relatedness 
Scale (NR-6) (Nisbet and Zelenski, 2013) was used to measure 
the subjective sense of connectedness to nature. Self-rated 
depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and two follow-
up time points (1 week and 7–12 months) in all study participants 
using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) 
(Rush et al., 2003). The above measures were assessed at base-
line and then again at the 1 week and 7–12-months follow-ups for 
all study participants.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23.0 
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Within-group comparisons 
were performed using one-tailed paired t-tests for parametric 
data and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests for non-parametric data. 
Between-group comparisons were performed using two-tailed 
independent t-tests for parametric data and Mann–Whitney U 
tests for non-parametric data. We provide 95% CIs around the 
mean differences. Effect sizes were calculated using the Hedges’ 
g formula due to the small sample size in this study.
Results
No serious adverse events occurred as a result of the psilocybin 
administration, and the acute drug effects were well tolerated by 
all patients (see Carhart-Harris et al. (2016a, 2017a) for more 
information).
Demographics
Of the total 14 participants who took part in this study, the major-
ity were Caucasian (78.6%) and men (64.3%) with a post-sec-
ondary level of education (85.7%). In the patient sample (n=7), 
baseline HAM-D scores ranged from 24 to 36 (M=28.6, SD=3.7) 
and the MADRS scores from 28 to 40 (M=35.9, SD=5); thus, all 
patients recruited were diagnosed with TRD of at least moderate 
severity, with most meeting criteria for severe depression. 
Control subjects were not clinically assessed because they were 
deemed physically and mentally healthy. Self-reported depres-
sive symptoms (QIDS) were collected for all study participants. 
Table 1 outlines participant demographic details and depressive 
scores at baseline.
Nature relatedness
Patients showed a significant increase in nature relatedness scores 
1 week after psilocybin treatment (M=4.14, SD=0.75) compared 
with baseline (M=3.67, SD=1.00); t(6)=−4.242, p=0.003, 95% CI 
[–0.75, 0.2]. The Hedges’ g value (g=2.5) for this contrast was very 
large, and the significant change was sustained at the 7–12-month 
follow-up time-point (M=4.12, SD=0.60; t(5)=−2.707, p=0.021, 
95% CI [–1.15, –0.03]; g=1.2). Non-treated control subjects 
showed no difference between screening (M=4.02, SD=0.79) and 
the first (M=4.02, SD=0.94; t(6)=0.008, p=0.994, 95% CI [–0.46, 
0.46]) or second (M=4.05, SD=0.62; t(5)=−1.228, p=0.274, 95% 
CI [–0.60, 0.21]) follow-ups. No significant between-groups dif-
ferences were found at baseline (p=0.471) or the first (p=0.799) 
and second (p=0.861) follow-ups. These results suggest that psilo-
cybin therapy increases the subjective sense of connectedness to

for at least 7–12 months (Figure 1(a)).
Political perspective
Patients showed a significant decrease in authoritarian political 
perspective 1 week after psilocybin treatment (M=2.43, SD=0.73) 
relative to baseline (M=2.89, SD=0.72); t(6)=2.120, p=0.039; 
95% CI [–0.07, 0.99]. The Hedges’ g value (g=0.8) was found to 
meet the conventional criterion for a large effect size. Decreases 
in authoritarianism were still evident 7–12 months post-dosing 
(M=2.27, SD=0.68), and although this trend-level effect no

months (t(5)=−2.707, p=0.021) after psilocybin treatment compared with baseline. No significant difference was found for the controls at the 
first (t(6)=0.008, p=0.994) or second follow-ups (t(5)=−1.228, p=0.274). (b) Political perspective. Patients were significantly less authoritarian 
1 week after psilocybin treatment (t(6)=2.120, p=0.039) and a trend-level decrease was found at 7–12 months (t(5)=−1.811, p=0.065) compared

between-groups differences were found (U=10.000, p=0.062). The patients’ depressive symptoms remained significantly reduced at the 7–12-months 
follow-up (Z=−1.782, p=0.038); however, a between-groups difference was found (U=3.500, p=0.020). No significant differences were found for the

Hedges’ g value (g=0.7) met convention for a medium-to-large 
effect size, suggesting that this study was underpowered to detect 
a statistically significant result on this particular measure. Non-
treated control subjects showed no change in authoritarianism 
between screening (M=2.40, SD=0.35) and the first (M=2.31, 
SD=0.66; t(6)=0.642, p=0.544) or second (M=2.33, SD=0.78; 
t(5)=0.515, p=0.629) follow-ups. No significant between-groups 
differences were found at baseline (p=0.132) or the first 
(p=0.755) or second (p=0.877) follow-ups. These results suggest 
that psilocybin therapy may persistently decrease authoritarian 
attitudes post-treatment with psilocybin, but that further research 
is required to test the robustness of this relationship (Figure 1(b)).
Depressive symptoms
Baseline depressive symptoms (QIDS ratings) were significantly 
higher in patients (M=19.43, SD=4.04) than controls (M=3.86, 
SD=2.41); U=0.0E0, p=0.001 (Figure 1(c)). Further, the Hedges’ 
g effect size value for this contrast (g=4.7) was, by convention, 
exceptionally high, confirming our assumption that the patients 
had far higher (baseline) self-reported depressive symptoms than 
the controls.
Therapeutic outcomes for the full sample are given in previ-
ous publications (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016a, 2018a, 2017). In 
the sample reported in this paper, patients showed a significant 
decrease in QIDS scores 1 week after the psilocybin sessions 
(M=12.29, SD=9.18) compared with baseline (M=19.43, 
SD=4.04); Z=−2.04, p=0.025 (Figure 1(c)). Further, the Hedges’ 
g value for this contrast (g=1.3) was, again, large by convention. 
There was no significant difference found in the controls’ base-
line (M=3.86, SD=2.41) versus 1-week follow-up QIDS scores 
(M=4.29, SD=4.35; Z=−0.422, p=0.673). These results confirm 
that depressive symptoms were significantly reduced for the 
patients 1 week after psilocybin treatment, but did not change 
over an equivalent period for the non-treated control subjects.
The patients’ 1 week post-treatment QIDS scores (M=12.29, 
SD=9.18) did not differ significantly from the controls’ follow-up 
values (M=4.29, SD=4.35; U=10.000, p=0.062), implying that 
the patients’ depressive symptoms were reduced to levels compa-
rable with a healthy population at the 1-week post-treatment 
time-point (Figure 1(c)).
The patients’ QIDS scores remained significantly decreased 
7–12 months after psilocybin treatment (M=13.00, SD=6.39) 
compared with baseline (M=19.43, SD=4.04); Z=−1.782, 
p=0.038. Moreover, the Hedges’ g value (g=0.7) for this contrast 
was ‘medium-to-large’. There was no significant difference 
found in the controls’ baseline (M=3.86, SD=2.41) versus 7–12-
month follow-up QIDS scores (M=4.00, SD=3.58); Z=−0.137, 
p=0.891 (Figure 1(c)). These results confirm that the patients’ 
significant reductions in depressive symptoms were sustained for 
7–12 months after psilocybin treatment, and did not change over 
an equivalent period for the non-treated control subjects.
Discussion
The present study sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin 
with psychological support on nature relatedness and authoritarian-
ism in patients with TRD. Patients reported a greater connection 
with nature 1 week after treatment. This increase in nature 
relatedness was sustained at the 7–12-months follow-up. One week 
post-treatment a significant decrease in authoritarianism was also 
observed, and at the 7–12-month follow-up the decrease was at 
trend level. No significant differences in nature relatedness, authori-
tarianism or depressive symptoms were found in an age and educa-
tion-matched group of control subjects measured over an equivalent 
time period, thus supporting the inference that the changes were not 
due to order effects. Taken together, these findings indicate that the 
psychologically supportive administration of psilocybin might 
induce sustained changes in attitudes and beliefs, including feeling 
closer to nature and less allied to authoritarian views.
The reduction of depressive symptoms following psilocybin 
treatment found here is consistent with previous studies demon-
strating the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds 
(Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017). Long-term improvements 
in psychological wellbeing (Griffiths et al., 2008) and trait open-
ness and optimism (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; MacLean et al., 
2011; Schmid and Liechti, 2017) have been observed in healthy 
volunteers following a single exposure to a psychedelic drug. A 
single dose of psilocybin has also been shown to induce enduring 
reductions in anxiety and depression as well as increases in qual-
ity of life, life meaning, and optimism in patients with anxiety 
reactive to advanced-stage cancer (Griffiths et al., 2016; Grob 
et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2016). Furthermore, rapid and sustained 
antidepressant effects were found in patients with recurrent MDD 
that were treated with a single dose of the plant-based psyche-
delic brew, ayahuasca (Osorio Fde et al., 2015).
Evidence suggests that greater nature relatedness is associated 
with lower anxiety (Martyn and Brymer, 2014) and greater per-
sonal wellbeing (Capaldi et al., 2014; Cervinka et al., 2012; Howell 
et al., 2011; Mayer and Frantz, 2004; Mayer et al., 2008; Nisbet 
and Zelenski, 2011; Nisbet et al., 2011; Zelenski and Nisbet, 2014), 
and that exposure to awe-inspiring nature may increase pro-social 
behaviour (Piff et al., 2015) – perhaps through a related mecha-
nism of seeing oneself as small in relation to the vastness of nature. 
Here, we show that the TRD patients felt more connected to nature 
up to 7–12 months after psilocybin treatment. This is consistent 
with a previous study in healthy participants in which 38% of the 
sample reported enduring positive changes in their relationship to 
nature and the environment 8–16 months post-psilocybin (Studerus 
et al., 2011). Psychedelic use in a large sample of web-survey 
respondents was found to positively predict nature relatedness 
(Nour et al., 2017); moreover, as with nature-inspiring experiences 
of awe (Piff et al., 2015), this relationship was strongest in people 
who experienced the greatest ego-dissolution during their most 
intense psychedelic experience (Nour et al., 2017).
Psychedelic users have been found to rate themselves as more 
concerned with the environment than users of other illicit sub-
stances (Lerner and Lyvers, 2006; Nour et al., 2017). Interacting 
with nature has been shown to have cognitive and affective bene-
fits in healthy individuals (Berman et al., 2008) and patients with 
MDD (Berman et al., 2012). Although we found no correlation 
between the changes in nature relatedness or authoritarianism and 
changes in depression in the patients, this may simply have been 
due to the small sample size (n=7), or it is possible that a measure 
of mental wellbeing may have been more sensitive to such a rela-
tionship than the presently used measure of depression. There is, 
however, evidence to suggest that nature exposure decreases rumi-
nation as well as activity in brain regions implicated in depression 
(Hamilton et al., 2015), namely the subgenual prefrontal cortex 
 816 
Journal of Psychopharmacology 32(7) 
(sgPFC) and regions of the default mode network (DMN) (Bratman 
et al., 2015). Interestingly, the administration of psilocybin has also 
been shown to acutely decrease sgPFC and DMN blood flow and 
within-network functional integrity (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; 
Hamilton et al., 2015) and to increase global connectivity in the 
brain (Petri et al., 2014; Roseman et al., 2016). Further work is 
required to test the hypotheses that a renewed sense of ‘connected-
ness’, including feeling connected to nature, is a key factor deter-
mining therapeutic outcomes in psychedelic therapy (Carhart-Harris 
et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2017b) and to better elucidate its basis in 
the brain. A working hypothesis is that increased global connectiv-
ity in the brain and its relationship to ego-dissolution (Tagliazucchi 
et al., 2016) and associated ‘connectedness’ (Watts et al., 2017b) is 
a key mediating factor (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b).
Psychedelic drug use in the 1960s and 1970s was strongly asso-
ciated with anti-establishment and egalitarian counter-culture 
movements (Nichols, 2016), yet very little controlled research has 
investigated the link between psychedelic use and political per-
spectives. Here we show for the first time, in a controlled study, 
lasting changes in political values after exposure to a psychedelic 
drug. This is in line with early research showing that recreational 
LSD users score higher on attitudes of ‘personal liberty’ and ‘for-
eign policy liberalism’ than control subjects (McGlothlin and 
Arnold, 1971). Psychedelic users have also been shown to score 
higher on ‘concern for others’ and place lower value on ‘financial 
prosperity’ than non-users of illicit substances as well as users of 
amphetamine, cannabis or heroin (Lerner and Lyvers, 2006). 
Given that psychedelics act through the serotonin system, it is 
interesting that serotonin has been implicated in the assessment of 
harm in moral decision-making, altruistic punishment and fairness 
(Crockett et al., 2008, 2010, 2013; Story et al., 2015). Moreover, 
psychedelics have been shown to increase trait openness (Carhart-
Harris et al., 2016b; Griffiths et al., 2008; MacLean et al., 2011), 
and a substantial body of evidence demonstrates a positive associa-
tion between openness and liberalism within individuals (Carney 
et al., 2008; Nour et al., 2017; Sibley et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013). 
Relatedly, the role of the serotonin 2A receptor, the key site of 
action of psychedelics, in mediating ‘conversion-type’ or ‘quan-
tum change’ (Miller, 2004) experiences has recently been dis-
cussed (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017).
There are a number of important limitations to this study that 
must be considered when interpreting the results. The study formed 
part of an open-label clinical trial with a small sample size. The 
sample was smaller still for the NR-6 and PPQ-5, as these meas-
ures were introduced late in the trial due to inspiration from a sepa-
rate project of ours (Nour et al., 2017). Also, although we recruited 
a control group to examine test–retest reliability on these meas-
ures, the controls were healthy subjects and were not exposed to 
the same treatment procedures. Critically, since treatment with 
psilocybin involved more than just drug administration (e.g. psy-
chological support before and after the psilocybin dosing sessions), 
it is quite possible that drug-unrelated factors contributed to the 
changes in NR-6 and PPQ-5 scores observed here. The caring 
therapeutic model may have been one such factor. A large double-
blind randomised control trial, ideally with an active control condi-
tion (to try and maintain the study blind), is required to more 
rigorously test the possible causal association between psilocybin 
and changes in nature relatedness and political perspective reported 
here. It would be hasty, therefore, to attempt any strong claims 
about a causal influence due specifically to psilocybin at this stage, 
and we should also be aware of anomalies in the relationship 
between psychedelic use and left-wing politics (Henrik, 2017); 
however, intriguing questions relating to psychedelics and politi-
cal/philosophical perspectives remain.
A further limitation concerns the gender matching of control 
subjects and TRD patients; all TRD patients were male, whereas 
there were more females (71%) than males (29%) in the control 
condition. Thus, our findings in the TRD group cannot necessar-
ily be extrapolated to females and the possibility of a gender 
effect cannot be discounted, and neither can we directly extrapo-
late the present findings to non-depressed populations.
The specificity of our main results also requires careful consid-
eration. The question remains to be addressed whether the reported 
changes in nature relatedness and authoritarianism observed here 
post-treatment with psilocybin were selective for these outcomes, 
or rather an epiphenomenon of the treatment’s core effects on 
depressive symptoms. The question of causality is of central rele-
vance here, and only further research can elucidate this. In this 
context, we would like to propose that there is a common mediat-
ing factor at play, driving both the improvements in mental health 
and changes in belief systems seen here – as well as elsewhere with 
psilocybin and other psychedelics (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016b; 
Hendricks et al., 2015b; Krebs and Johansen, 2013; MacLean 
et al., 2011). Such a common factor could be seen as a mental 
health equivalent of the general intelligence factor (e.g. Spearman’s 
g) in cognitive science (Spearman, 1987; Spiegelman, 2010). More 
specifically, in line with a recent commentary from our team 
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b) we propose that connectedness is this 
factor (see Carhart-Harris et al. (2018b); Watts et al. (2017b)), and 
that psychedelics positively and potently modulate this.
Connectedness is a construct in need of development, but 
related concepts can be found in the literature (Alexander, 2010). 
In brief, connectedness can be defined as a sense of feeling con-
nected to one’s self (i.e. a sense of feeling emotionally and 
somatically integrated and at peace) as well as others (e.g. one’s 
partner, family, friends, colleagues and community) and the 
world more generally (e.g. feeling connected to nature and a 
guiding ethical and/or philosophical principle), as described in 
our recent work (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2017b). 
Thus, a remediating effect on feelings of disconnectedness, char-
acteristic of a broad swathe of mental illness (Alexander, 2010), 
may underlie both the improvements in depressive symptoms 
and the relevant changes in political perspective reported here.
What of the association between mental health and political 
perspective? There is some support for a link between lower 
authoritarianism and better mental health (Amodio et al., 2007; 
Hirsh et al., 2010; Jost et al., 2003), although there are also some 
contradictory findings (Verhulst et al., 2016; Vigil, 2010). The 
idea that drugs, including legal ones such as alcohol (Nour et al., 
2016) and caffeine (Carpenter, 2015), and medications such as 
stimulants (Ohler and Whiteside, 2017) and selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (Kramer, 1997) can modulate belief systems, 
including political perspective, is relatively new – but one that 
may be fundamentally important, with potentially profound 
implications. If, for example, it was found that excessive alcohol 
use promotes a detachment from nature (Nour et al., 2016), 
chronic stimulant use promotes an aggressive industriousness 
and hubris – and potential for paranoia (Ohler and Whiteside, 
2017) – and psychedelic experiences promote a generalised sense 
of connectedness (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 
 Lyons and Carhart-Harris 
817
2017b), including greater altruism (Forstmann and Sagioglou, 
2017; Schmid and Liechti, 2017), what implications would this 
have for societies and their policies on such drugs? This and 
related topics may be seen as part of a new branch of political 
science, focused on the psychology and neurobiology of political 
perspective (Amodio et al., 2007; Everett et al., 2015; Haidt, 
2013; Kanai et al., 2011; Kaplan et al., 2016; Nash et al., 2017).
Finally, we are keen to avoid a value judgement about the 
political changes that may (or may not) be attributable to psyche-
delic use. For some, ecological considerations (e.g. captured by 
nature relatedness) may be assigned the greatest importance 
(Lovelock and Hudson, 2016), particularly when considering the 
scale and seriousness of the problem posed by climate change, 
for example (Prüss-Ustün et al., 2016), whereas others may rec-
ognise ‘order’ (e.g. captured in part by our authoritarianism 
scale) as an essential and functional counterweight to lawlessness 
(Bejan, 2017; Haidt, 2013). Testing whether psychedelic use is 
‘beneficial for society’ would be a complex project, not least 
because opinions will differ on how to define ‘beneficial’ 
(although see Harris (2010) for a thought-provoking discussion 
on this matter). Even so, exploring the potential of psychedelics 
to moderate extremist views, and/or facilitate reconciliation, 
might be worth exploring, given the present results and wider 
supporting literature (Amodio et al., 2007; Carhart-Harris et al., 
2018b; Hirsh et al., 2010; Jost et al., 2003; Watts et al., 2017a).
In conclusion, this study sought to investigate the effects of 
psilocybin with psychological support on nature relatedness and 
authoritarian attitudes in patients with TRD. With significant 
caveats clearly highlighted, our findings tentatively raise the pos-
sibility that given in this way, psilocybin may produce sustained 
changes in outlook and political perspective, here in the direction 
of increased nature relatedness and decreased authoritarianism. 
These findings motivate further controlled studies to better deter-
mine the causality, reliability, specificity and durability of this 
relationship, as well as potential applications.
