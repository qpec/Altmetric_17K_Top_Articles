Summary
Background Arthroscopic sub-acromial decompression (decompressing the sub-acromial space by removing bone 
spurs and soft tissue arthroscopically) is a common surgery for subacromial shoulder pain, but its effectiveness is 
uncertain. We did a study to assess its effectiveness and to investigate the mechanism for surgical decompression.
Methods We did a multicentre, randomised, pragmatic, parallel group, placebo-controlled, three-group trial at 32 hospitals 
in the UK with 51 surgeons. Participants were patients who had subacromial pain for at least 3 months with intact 
rotator cuff tendons, were eligible for arthroscopic surgery, and had previously completed a non-operative management 
programme that included exercise therapy and at least one steroid injection. Exclusion criteria included a full-thickness 
torn rotator cuff. We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to arthroscopic subacromial decompression, investigational 
arthroscopy only, or no treatment (attendance of one reassessment appointment with a specialist shoulder clinician 
3 months after study entry, but no intervention). Arthroscopy only was a placebo as the essential surgical element (bone 
and soft tissue removal) was omitted. We did the randomisation with a computer-generated minimisation system. In the 
surgical intervention groups, patients were not told which type of surgery they were receiving (to ensure masking). 
Patients were followed up at 6 months and 1 year after randomisation; surgeons coordinated their waiting lists to 
schedule surgeries as close as possible to randomisation. The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (0 [worst] 
to 48 [best]) at 6 months, analysed by intention to treat. The sample size calculation was based upon a target difference 
of 4·5 points (SD 9·0). This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01623011.
Findings Between Sept 14, 2012, and June 16, 2015, we randomly assigned 313 patients to treatment groups (106 to 
decompression surgery, 103 to arthroscopy only, and 104 to no treatment). 24 [23%], 43 [42%], and 12 [12%] of the 
decompression, arthroscopy only, and no treatment groups, respectively, did not receive their assigned treatment by 
6 months. At 6 months, data for the Oxford Shoulder Score were available for 90 patients assigned to decompression, 
94 to arthroscopy, and 90 to no treatment. Mean Oxford Shoulder Score did not differ between the two surgical groups 
at 6 months (decompression mean 32·7 points [SD 11·6] vs arthroscopy mean 34·2 points [9·2]; mean difference 
–1·3 points (95% CI –3·9 to 1·3, p=0·3141). Both surgical groups showed a small benefit over no treatment (mean 
29·4 points [SD 11·9], mean difference vs decompression 2·8 points [95% CI 0·5–5·2], p=0·0186; mean difference 
vs arthroscopy 4·2 [1·8–6·6], p=0·0014) but these differences were not clinically important. There were six study-
related complications that were all frozen shoulders (in two patients in each group).
Interpretation Surgical groups had better outcomes for shoulder pain and function compared with no treatment but 
this difference was not clinically important. Additionally, surgical decompression appeared to offer no extra benefit 
over arthroscopy only. The difference between the surgical groups and no treatment might be the result of, for 
instance, a placebo effect or postoperative physiotherapy. The findings question the value of this operation for these 
indications, and this should be communicated to patients during the shared treatment decision-making process.

pain is estimated as €4139, with costs for sick leave and 
secondary care substantially adding to total costs.7
An anatomical cause for subacromial pain has been 
proposed, whereby mechanical contact occurs between 
the rotator cuff tendons and the overlying acromion or 
bone spur that often forms at the anteroinferior margin 
of the acromion, narrowing the subacromial space. 
The narrowing makes physical contact more likely, 
particularly in certain positions of the arm (known as a 
painful arc).8 The condition is sometimes referred to as 
impingement. Although many patients with subacromial 
pain are treated with, and will respond to, non-operative 
treatment alone,9 surgical intervention is often used as an 
early treatment choice or in recalcitrant cases. This 
intervention involves decompressing the subacromial 
space by removing the bone spur and any involved soft 
tissue arthroscopically, a procedure known as arthroscopic 
subacromial decompression. The indications for surgery 
are persistent and severe subacromial shoulder pain 
combined with functional restrictions that are resistant 
to conservative measures. However, the effectiveness of 
this procedure is uncertain. Some reports suggest that 
surgery can be no more effective than exercise therapy,10 
whereas others report good outcomes from surgery.11 
The number of patients undergoing subacromial 
decom 
pression in England (UK) rose by seven times 
from 2523 in 2000 to 21 355 in 2010.12
Some studies have tried to assess the effectiveness of 
subacromial decompression against a control. One 
randomised controlled trial13 compared decompression 
plus subacromial bursectomy with bursectomy alone and 
reported no significant difference in clinical outcome 
between groups. Such studies support the theory that 
undergoing a surgical intervention for subacromial pain 
results in a significant placebo effect and that removal 
of the subacromial bone spur and soft tissue might 
not be necessary. No randomised trials have been re-
ported with patients with subacromial pain to assess 
whether decompression is more effective than a diagnostic 
investigative arthroscopy, or doing nothing (no treatment).
The objectives of our Can Shoulder Arthroscopy Work? 
(CSAW) study were twofold: to compare shoulder surgery 
with and without the essential surgical element (surgical 
decompression vs arthroscopy only) to investigate the 
mechanism for surgical decompression, and to compare 
surgery (decompression and arthroscopy only for 
subacromial shoulder pain against no treatment to assess 
the effectiveness of surgical intervention.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Shoulder pain is common and poses a substantial burden to 
society. Subacromial decompression was introduced in 1972 as a 
treatment for subacromial shoulder pain without high-level 
evidence and is now one of the most common surgical 
procedures in orthopaedics. The rationale is that the shoulder 
pain is caused by physical contact during arm movement 
between the rotator cuff tendons and a spur of bone or 
associated soft tissue projecting from the acromion of the 
scapula, and that surgical removal of the bone spur and soft 
tissue (decompression) eliminates this contact and, thereby 
cures or reduces symptoms. In 2009, we searched the scientific 
literature (assisted by Arthritis Research UK) before study 
submission with no language restrictions for reports published 
between 2000–09. We searched NLH, Embase, MEDLINE, PEDro; 
MetaRegister of Clinical Trials (active and archived registers), 
ClinicalTrials.gov, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (DARE, 
NHS EED and HTA), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Studies 
databases, with the search terms “arthroscopy”, “arthroscopic”, 
“arthroscope”, “arthroscopies”, “acromioplasty”, “shoulder”, 
“rotator cuff”, “glenohumeral”, “acromioclavicular”, 
“supraspinatus”, “bicipital”, “subacromial”, “osteoarthritis”, 
“rheumatoid arthritis”, “calcific”, “tendonitis”, “impingement”, 
and “bursitis “. A systematic review of the effectiveness of 
surgery was limited by the quality of evidence but their findings 
showed no difference between patients treated with surgery and 
those treated with non-surgical options. The recommendation 
from this review is that more high-quality trials are undertaken. 
We did a randomised, pragmatic, parallel group, 
placebo-controlled trial to determine whether decompression 
compared with placebo (arthroscopy only) improved pain and 
function, whether decompression differed in outcome to no 
treatment, and whether placebo differed to no treatment.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to compare surgery 
with no treatment and is the first published trial of shoulder 
surgery to include a placebo comparison. Both types of surgery 
were better than no treatment, but the differences were not 
clinically significant, which questions the value of this type of 
surgery to patients. There were also no differences in outcomes 
between decompression surgery and placebo surgery 
(arthroscopy only) for these indications. The mechanism of the 
treatment effect in the patients who received surgery might be 
the result of placebo, postoperative physiotherapy, or other 
factors. Removal of bone spurs and soft tissue conferred no clear 
added benefit.
Implications of all the available evidence
During the past three decades, clinicians and patients with 
subacromial shoulder pain have accepted minimally invasive 
arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery in the belief 
that it provides reliable relief of symptoms at low risk of 
adverse events and complications. However, the findings from 
our study suggest that surgery might not provide clinically 
significant benefit over no treatment, and that there is no 
benefit of decompression over arthroscopy only. These results 
should be shared with patients considering surgery.

Methods
Study design and participants
The detailed study design and protocol has been 
published previously.14 We did a multicentre, randomised, 
pragmatic, parallel group, placebo-controlled, three-
group trial. 32 hospital sites in the UK (with 51 surgeons 
recruiting or delivering both surgical interventions) were 
open for recruitment. Two sites (with two surgeons) were 
subsequently closed without recruiting any participants. 
11 surgeons were involved in the recruitment but did not 
operate. Therefore, patients were recruited at 30 sites and 
operated on by 38 surgeons.
Methodologically, the most desirable control com-
parisons for assessing treatment benefit are placebo or 
sham intervention and no treatment. An entirely sham 
procedure (ie, a completely simulated surgery) can pose 
recruitment issues, therefore we used a placebo surgical 
intervention in which the accepted critical surgical 
element (bone and tissue removal in this instance) was 
omitted.15 For this study, the placebo intervention was 
investigational arthroscopy only.
The study tested three main superiority hypotheses. 
First, that there is no difference in outcomes between 
decompression and arthroscopy only. This comparison 
accounts for the placebo effect of surgery and informs 
whether the proposed critical surgical element, removal 
of bone and soft tissue, is necessary. Secondly, that no 
difference in outcomes exists between decompression 
and no treatment. The third hypothesis is that there is 
no difference in outcomes between arthroscopy only and 
no treatment to evaluate the benefit of arthroscopy 
without removing bone, bursa and soft tissue.
The study was designed under the ethical supervision 
of an academic ethicist (JS) with placebo trial ex-
perience.15 UK National Health Service (NHS) ethical 
approval was obtained on Feb 2, 2012, from the National 
Research Ethics Service South Central Oxford B 
(Research Ethics Committee Reference 12/SC/0028). 
Local NHS research and development approvals were 
obtained for each recruiting centre. The study was 
accepted onto the UK Clinical Research Network 
portfolio (12104).
Operating surgeons had a large amount of experience 
(29 of 38 were consultants for more than 5 years and 
26 of 38 had done more than 20 decompressions in 
the previous year), and most had done between 
40–60 procedures. Patients had to have subacromial pain 
of at least 3 months’ duration with intact rotator cuff
 
tendons, be eligible for arthroscopic surgery, and to have 
previously completed a non-operative management 
programme that included both exercise therapy and at 
least one steroid injection. Diagnosis was confirmed by a 
consultant shoulder surgeon. Detailed exclusion criteria 
are in the protocol and included patients with a full-
thickness torn rotator cuff (identified with MRI, 
ultrasound, or x-ray). Patients with partial-thickness tears 
were not excluded but the location, nature, and extent 
of the partial-thickness tear was recorded. Informed 
consent of patients was obtained by the participating 
surgeon or suitably qualified local centre study personnel 
after a reflection period of 48 h, subsequent to study 
introduction and taken at the baseline measurement 
appointment immediately before baseline measurement. 
Consent was requested for all study interventions and 
assessments, including voice recording of appointments 
for qualitative research investi 
gative purposes.16
Randomisation and masking
We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to arthroscopic 
subacromial decompression, investigational arthroscopy 
only, or no treatment (attendance of one reassess-
ment appointment with a specialist shoulder clinician 
3 months after study entry, but no intervention). Arthro-
scopy only was a placebo as the essential surgical element 
(bone and soft tissue removal) was omitted. We did 
the randomisation with a computer-generated min-
imisation system.
Patients randomly assigned to surgery were not told 
which procedure they had undergone, decompression or 
arthroscopy only, to ensure they were masked to assign-
ment; however, patients assigned to no treatment were 
not masked to assignment. Masked assessment was 
done in all groups. The randomisation was done by a site 
research officer using an automated computer generated 
minimisation system, minimising for age (<40, 40–55, 
or ≥56 years), sex, baseline Oxford Shoulder Score 
(<19, 19–26, 27–33, or ≥34 years), and recruiting site.
Procedures
Patients underwent standardised postoperative care and 
exercise therapy in both surgical groups. Patients received 
the appropriate surgical treatment for any unexpected 
pathology, such as repair for full thickness rotator cuff
 
tear, under the same anaesthetic. We deemed these 
patients non-compliant with allocated treatment.
Decompression was done according to routine 
practice under general anaesthetic. Further details of the 
procedure are in the protocol,14 and involved removal of 
bursa and soft tissue within the subacromial space, 
release of the coracoacromial ligament, and removal of 
the subacromial bone spur through posterior and lateral 
portals. Arthroscopy only was also done under general 
anaesthetic through a posterior portal. Patients under-
went routine investigational arthroscopy of the joint, 
rotator cuff tendons, and subacromial bursa, with 
the operation done in exactly the same manner as 
decompression. A lateral skin incision was made to 
simulate a lateral portal but no instruments were 
introduced through this incision. The intervention did 
not involve surgical removal of any bone, bursal tissue, 
other soft tissue or release of the coracoacromial 
ligament. The procedure involved inspection and 
irrigation of the glenohumeral joint (arthroscopy) and 
the subacromial bursa (bursoscopy). For all surgical

patients, surgical pathology details were recorded at 
operation. Postoperative physiotherapy involved advice 
and between one and four routine treatment sessions.
No treatment (monitoring) involved patients attending 
one reassessment appointment with a specialist shoulder 
clinician 3 months after entering the study but with no 
planned intervention. The patients in the no-treatment 
group had no prescribed physiotherapy or steroid 
injections.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure for the study was the 
Oxford Shoulder Score assessed at 6 months after 
randomisation. This is a patient-reported questionnaire 
and an effective measure of change in pain and function 
in shoulders over time (scale 0 [worst] to 48 [best]).17
Secondary outcome measures were the Oxford 
Shoulder Score at 12 months after randomisation, a 
modified Constant-Murley Shoulder Score (for shoulder 
function and range of motion),18 PainDETECT—a 
questionnaire for neuropathic pain components,19 Quan-
titative Sensory Testing (for pain and pain thresholds),20 
adverse events (both expected and un 
expected were 
recorded by trial co-ordinators at local sites and reported 
to the CSAW office), EQ-5D-3L (EuroQol 5 dimensions 
3 level index; quality of life), EuroQol visual analogue 
scale (EQ VAS), treatment expectations, patient per-
ception or satisfaction,21 and anxiety and depression

Score).22
Baseline  assessments of the pain and quality of life 
measures were also were undertaken. Participating 
surgeons coordinated their surgery waiting lists to 
ensure surgical patients were scheduled for surgery as 
close to randomisation as possible. Patients were 
followed up at 6 and 12 months after randomisation, with 
patients in the no-treatment group having an additional 
reassessment at 3 months after randomisation. Each 
follow-up involved questionnaires and a clinical assess-
ment in clinic. Operation details were also collected at 
the time of surgery. Patients with delays in receiving 
surgery of longer than 4 months completed additional 
questionnaires at the time of surgery and also 1 year after 
surgery. This further data collection was implemented 
early in the recruitment period once the length of the 
surgical waiting times in some sites became clear.
Statistical analysis
A full description of the sample size calculation and 
analysis plan is in the published protocol14 together with 
the statistical analysis plan. The sample size was based 
on the primary outcome measure, Oxford Shoulder 
Score at 6 months after randomisation and was calcu-
lated using a minimum clinically important difference 
approximation based on half of the SD of the change in 
the score from before to after treatment, which was 
estimated to be nine points (ie, a target difference of 
4·5 points). Using a two-sided t test, 90% power to detect 
a difference in the Oxford Shoulder Score of 4·5 (SD 9·0), 
with a two-sided 5% level of significance (α) re 
quired a 
sample size of 85 participants in each group. Accounting 
for loss to follow-up of up to 15%, 100 participants were 
required in each group. A target of 300 participants 
(100 per treatment group) was set. No adjustment was 
made for multiple comparisons.
The principal analysis of the primary and all secondary 
outcomes was done according to the randomised group 
(intention-to-treat), irrespective of compliance without 
imputation for missing data. Per-protocol analyses (ie, 
inclusion of randomised patient if they received the 
allocated intervention at the specified timepoint) were 
also done for the primary outcome and Oxford Shoulder 
Score at 1 year. Additional sensitivity analyses for the two 
outcomes addressed delays in receiving surgery by using 
post-surgery follow-up data (decompression vs arthro-
scopy only, and also excluding participant data where 
surgery was just before [within 2 months] of the follow-
up timepoint). Other sensitivity analyses assessed the 
sensitivity to model assumptions and other factors 
(bootstrapping for possible non-normality, unadjusted 
analysis to assess the effect of adjustment for 
minimisation factors and mixed-model analyses to 
maximise use of available outcome data), and missing 
data (using multiple imputation model for missing at 
random and the rctmiss command in Stata for missing 
not-at-random assumptions to quantify the potential 
effect of missing data).
Three separate two-way comparisons (ie, decomp-
ression vs arthroscopy only, decompression vs no 
treatment, and arthroscopy only vs no treatment) were 
done for all outcome analyses. For each comparison, 
linear regression analysis was used to compare the 
Oxford Shoulder Score at 6 months after randomisation, 
adjusting for the minimisation factors of sex and age (as 
a continuous factor), baseline Oxford Shoulder Score (as 
a continuous factor) and site (using cluster robust 
standard errors, implemented via the cluster option in 
Stata). Information from the participant’s age and 
baseline Oxford Shoulder Score were recorded in two 
places, namely the randomisation system and the 
baseline form (later entered onto the trial database). 
Where there were discrepancies between the records, the 
information from the trial database was used in this 
analysis. The Oxford Shoulder Score at 12 months, and 
modified Constant-Murley, PainDETECT, Quantitative 
Sensory Testing, HADS, EQ VAS, and EQ-5D-3L Index 
score [UK tariff] and visual analogue scale) measures 
were analysed in a similar manner (adjusting for the 
appropriate baseline). Complications, treatment expect-
ations, and patient satisfaction were analysed using a 
Fisher’s exact test or χ² test for trend. The statistical 
analysis plan was reviewed by an independent Data 
Monitoring Committee, and finalised and approved by a 
Trial Steering Committee before unmasking the data to 
study investigators. All statistical testing was done at the 
two-sided 5% significance level, and 95% CIs with 
Stata 14.2. This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.

Results
Between Sept 14, 2012, and June 16, 2015, we randomly 
assigned 313 patients (of 740 eligible patients [appendix]) 
to treatment: 106 to decompression surgery, 103 to 
arthroscopy only, and 104 to no treatment, figure 1. 
The study groups were well balanced on all base-
line characteristics (table 1). The median number of 
operations per surgeon was two (IQR 1–6). Further 
details on reasons for non-compliance, missing data, and 
the per-protocol population are in the appendix. 24 (23%), 
43 (42%), and 12 (12%) of the decompression, arthroscopy 
only, and no-treatment groups, respectively, did not 
receive their assigned treatment by 6 months. At 1 year, 
19 (18%), 35 (34%), and 26 (25%) of the decompression, 
arthroscopy only, and no-treatment groups, respectively, 
had not received their assigned treatment. Median time

to surgery (any type) was 90 days (IQR 58–123), 82 days 
(56–134), and 217 days (111–262) for decompression, 
arthroscopy only, and no treatment groups, respectively.
At 6 months, data for the Oxford Shoulder Score were 
available for 90 patients assigned to decompression, 94 to 
arthroscopy, and 90 to no treatment. Mean Oxford 
Shoulder Score did not differ between the two surgical 
groups at 6 months (decompression 32·7 points [SD 11·6] 
vs arthroscopy 34·2 points [9·2]; mean difference 
–1·3 points (95% CI –3·9 to 1·3, p=0·3141). Both surgical 
groups showed a small benefit over no treatment (mean 
29·4 points [SD 11·9], decompression was higher by 
2·8 points [95% CI 0·5–5·2], p=0· 0186; mean difference 
vs arthroscopy by 4·2 points [1·8–6·6], p=0·0014) but 
these differences were not clinically important (table 2, 
figure 2).
At both 6 months and 1 year follow-up, all groups had 
on average better mean Oxford Shoulder Score scores 
(table 2, figure 2). The per-protocol analyses showed 
similar results (appendix) and the results were not 
sensitive to missing data. Similarly, sensitivity analyses 
had consistent results. Using post-surgery follow-up did 
not change the findings nor did exclusion of data for 
assessments done less than 2 months after surgery 
(appendix). Mixed model and bootstrapped analyses also 
produced very similar results (appendix). A 12-point 
difference missing not-at-random assumption did not 
change the decompression versus arthroscopy only 
results (appendix).
Nearly all secondary outcomes (table 3, appendix) reflect 
the same pattern as the primary outcome. The modified 
Constant-Murley score also showed no difference between 
decompression and arthroscopy only at 6 months and 
1 year, but both surgical groups were better than no 
treatment at both timepoints. PainDETECT, EQ-5D-3L 
Index, EQ VAS, and HADS results also showed similar 
trends for no difference between the two surgical groups 
at 6 months, but differences were noted between each 
surgical group and no treatment (if not reaching statistical 
significance in all analyses). More patients in both surgical

groups (decompression and arthroscopy only) considered 
themselves to have improved after treatment than in the 
no-treatment group at 6 months (appendix), although not 
in all comparisons at 1 year. Similarly, more patients in the 
surgical groups were pleased with their outcome than in 
the no-treatment group at 6 months, although at 1 year 
only some of the corresponding results were significant. 
Other patient-reported outcomes (appendix) were mostly 
not significant between any of the groups for either 
timepoint.
There were six study-related complications, all frozen 
shoulders (two in each group). The comparisons of any 
complications were not significant (decompression vs 
arthroscopy only p>0·9999; decompression vs no 
treatment, p>0·9999; arthroscopy only vs no treatment, 
p≥0·9999). Two further participants had trauma-related 
injuries during the study (not considered study-related 
complications) that affected their study shoulder (one car 
accident [in the no-treatment group], and one fall due to 
slipping [in the decompression group]). Two participants 
(both in the arthroscopy only group) required further 
surgery for pain. One of these patients underwent 
decompression, the other received superior labrum 
anterior posterior debridement. Details on non-surgical 
treatments received are in the appendix.
Discussion
This study showed that shoulder pain improved 
substantially from baseline with subacromial de-
compression, arthroscopy only, and no treatment, and 
that the magnitude of difference between surgery (both 
surgical groups) and no treatment was statistically but of 
uncertain clinical significance. The difference between 
surgery and no treatment might be attributable to other 
factors including a surgical placebo effect, or to other 
unidentified effects of arthroscopic assessment of the 
joint and bursa, or to rest and postoperative physiotherapy 
associated with surgery.
There were also no differences in outcome between the 
two surgical groups at any timepoint. This finding 
suggests that the treatment effect is not due to the 
principal clinical justification for the surgery, which is 
the removal of bone, bursa, and soft tissue to relieve 
impingement on the underlying tendons during 
movement of the arm.
Consistent findings were noted for all the patient-
reported and clinical outcomes used. The only other 
randomised trial reported in this field13 compared 
arthroscopic subacromial decompression with arthro-
scopic resection of the bursa and release of the 
coracoacromial ligament attached to the anterior 
acromion. Findings from this study showed no difference 
in outcome between the two groups, but both included 
substantial surgical resection of tissue that might be the 
cause of mechanical symptoms and impingement. 
One conclusion from our study is that both arthroscopic 
subacromial decompression and arthroscopy only are 
effective, regardless of mechanism, and could be used as 
a treatment strategy for patients with subacromial 
impingement. Another more plausible conclusion is that 
surgery, although statistically better than no treatment, 
does not provide patients with a clinically important 
benefit. The focus of this study was an assessment of the 
role of surgery, and comparison groups were chosen to 
enable this. In the light of the results, other management 
strategies apart from surgery clearly should be assessed.
We are not aware of any published randomised 
trials investigating the effectiveness of arthroscopic

subacromial decompression surgery compared with a 
placebo control, despite this being the most common 
arthroscopic shoulder operation.23 Placebo-controlled 
trials of surgery are not common but have been shown to 
be feasible, ethical, and of value.24 There have been trials 
involving placebo surgery in the knee and these have 
resulted in changes in practice.25,26 Although harms 
associated with arthroscopy are rare, they do occur and 
include infection and venous thromboembolism.27–29
The strengths of this study were the use of a randomised 
placebo-controlled design with three groups (including 
both placebo and no-treatment arms), multiple follow-up 
assessments, and the use of valid patient-reported 
outcome measures. Additionally, the pragmatic nature of 
the study, and the wide range of sites and surgeons 
increased the generalisability of the results. Masking of 
the assessors and patients to the specific surgical 
intervention was also a strength with regard to the 
comparison of the decompression and arthroscopy only 
groups; however, masking of participants in the no-
treatment arm was not possible, which could have 
affected reported outcomes in this group.
The major study limitation was the level of non-
compliance to treatment allocation. Some patients 
assigned to surgery improved while waiting and did not 
proceed with surgery, whereas others assigned to no 
treatment chose to undergo decompression surgery. 
However, the findings of the trial were consistent when 
analysed both as randomised and per protocol. Similarly, 
missing data did not account for the absence of benefit of 
decompression over arthroscopy only. Patients in both 
surgical groups received a package of care consisting of 
surgery and subsequent postoperative physiotherapy 
advice on mobilisation and exercises. This postoperative 
physiotherapy could have affected outcome, and there-
fore we remain unsure of the mechanism for the benefit 
gained in the surgical groups. Our study also did not 
address long-term recurrence of any pain and problems 
beyond 1 year; however, the likelihood of one of the 
surgical groups achieving greater benefit beyond 1 year, 
when no difference existed previously, seems improbable. 
We did not adjust for multiple comparisons as per the 
protocol and the statistical analysis plan given the nature 
of three groups, although published views regarding 
this differ.30,31
A further limitation was that patients could not be 
masked to treatment in the no treatment group, and they 
therefore might have perceived their treatment to be 
inferior to surgery. This perception could have adversely 
affected the outcome (nocebo effect). Another limitation 
is the waiting-list effect in the surgical groups, which 
might have had the potential to affect interpretation. We 
undertook additional follow-up assessments for the few 
patients who had significant delays waiting for surgery to 
enable appropriate comparisons.
In conclusion, we showed that, in patients with per-
sistent subacromial shoulder pain due to impinge 
ment, 
improvement in Oxford Shoulder Scores with arthro-
scopic subacromial decompression did not differ to 
that achieved with arthroscopy only (placebo surgery). 
Although both types of surgery provide greater symptom 
improvement than no treatment, this difference was of 
uncertain clinical significance. The findings (which 
should be communicated to patients during the shared 
treatment decision-making process) question the value 
of this type of surgery for these indications, and might 
discourage some surgeons from offering decompression 
surgery and dissuade some patients from undergoing 
the surgery.
