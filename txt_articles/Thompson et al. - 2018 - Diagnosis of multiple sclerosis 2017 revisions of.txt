The 2010 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis are widely used in research and clinical practice. 
Scientific advances in the past 7 years suggest that they might no longer provide the most up-to-date guidance for 
clinicians and researchers. The International Panel on Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis reviewed the 2010 McDonald 
criteria and recommended revisions. The 2017 McDonald criteria continue to apply primarily to patients experiencing 
a typical clinically isolated syndrome, define what is needed to fulfil dissemination in time and space of lesions in the 
CNS, and stress the need for no better explanation for the presentation. The following changes were made: in patients 
with a typical clinically isolated syndrome and clinical or MRI demonstration of dissemination in space, the presence 
of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands allows a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis; symptomatic lesions can be used to 
demonstrate dissemination in space or time in patients with supratentorial, infratentorial, or spinal cord syndrome; 
and cortical lesions can be used to demonstrate dissemination in space. Research to further refine the criteria should 
focus on optic nerve involvement, validation in diverse populations, and incorporation of advanced imaging, 
neurophysiological, and body fluid markers. 
Introduction
Diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis combining 
clinical, imaging, and laboratory evidence have evolved 
over time, with the most recent being the 2010 McDonald 
criteria from the International Panel on Diagnosis of 
Multiple Sclerosis (referred to as the Panel from here 
on).1–5 The increasing incorporation of paraclinical 
assessments, especially imaging, to supplement clinical 
findings has allowed earlier, more sensitive, and more 
specific diagnosis.6 New data, emerging technology, and 
evolving consensus necessitate a periodic re-examination 
of diagnostic criteria and their usefulness. The Panel 
reconvened under the auspices of the International 
Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple 
Sclerosis (sponsored by the US National Multiple 
Sclerosis Society and the European Committee for 
Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis) for two 
meetings (Nov 2–5, 2016, in Philadelphia, PA, USA, and 
May 20–21, 2017, in Berlin, Germany). In this Position 
Paper, we discuss issues related to misdiagnosis, 
differential diagnosis, and appropriate application of the 
McDonald criteria, with a particular emphasis on 
diagnosis in diverse populations and in patients with 
atypical presentations. With the 2017 McDonald criteria, 
we present recommendations concerning the diagnostic 
process for multiple sclerosis, make specific revisions 
to the 2010 McDonald criteria, and outline research 
that should be done to inform future refinements of 
the criteria.
Rationale and methods for the 2017 revisions
The Panel meetings to consider revisions to the 2010 
McDonald criteria were motivated by new data in several 
areas: the performance of the 2010 McDonald criteria in 
diverse populations; the distinction between multiple 
sclerosis and other diseases with potentially overlapping 
clinical and imaging features, such as neuromyelitis 
optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs); challenges in 
making the diagnosis in individuals with presentations 
other than a typical clinically isolated syndrome; the 
frequency and consequences of misdiagnosis; and CSF 
and other paraclinical tests that could be used to diagnose 
multiple sclerosis. The meetings were further informed 
by the proposed 2016 revisions of MRI criteria for the 
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis by the European Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (MAGNIMS) 
network.7
The 2017 Panel membership (ie, the authors of this 
Position Paper) was expanded considerably compared 
with previous panels to include broader representation 
from different geographical regions and additional 
expertise in clinical, imaging, and laboratory aspects of 
multiple sclerosis diagnosis, while maintaining some 
members of previous panels. At the meetings, Panel 
members reviewed past criteria and made brief 
presentations covering proposed revisions. Relevant 
published and unpublished data guided subsequent 
group discussion and agreement on proposed revisions. 
Consensus was reached on all points.
The Panel agreed that the 2010 McDonald criteria 
performed well based on their use in clinical and research 
settings 
and 
in 
regulatory 
approval 
of 
several 
disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis; major 
changes were not anticipated. Rather, the 2017 McDonald 
criteria are intended to simplify or clarify components of 
the 2010 McDonald criteria (panels 1, 2), to facilitate 
earlier diagnosis when multiple sclerosis is likely but not 
diagnosable with the 2010 McDonald criteria, and to 
preserve the specificity of the 2010 McDonald criteria and 
promote their appropriate application to reduce the

Panel 1: Glossary
Attack
Attack, relapse, exacerbation, and (when it is the first episode) 
clinically isolated syndrome are synonyms. See clinically isolated 
syndrome and relapse for descriptions.
Clinically isolated syndrome
A monophasic clinical episode with patient-reported 
symptoms and objective findings reflecting a focal or 
multifocal inflammatory demyelinating event in the CNS, 
developing acutely or subacutely, with a duration of at least 
24 h, with or without recovery, and in the absence of fever or 
infection; similar to a typical multiple sclerosis relapse (attack 
and exacerbation) but in a patient not known to have multiple 
sclerosis.8–10 Thus, if the patient is subsequently diagnosed with 
multiple sclerosis (by fulfilling dissemination in space and 
time, and ruling out other diagnoses), the clinically isolated 
syndrome was that patient’s first attack. A clinically isolated 
syndrome can be monofocal (reflecting pathology in a single 
location) or multifocal; the specific manifestations of a 
clinically isolated syndrome depend on the anatomical 
location (or locations) of the pathology. Typical presentations 
include unilateral optic neuritis, focal supratentorial 
syndrome, focal brainstem or cerebellar syndrome, or partial 
myelopathy; examples of atypical presentations include 
bilateral optic neuritis, complete ophthalmoplegia, complete 
myelopathy, encephalopathy, headache, alteration of 
consciousness, meningismus, or isolated fatigue.6
Cortical MRI lesions
Lesions within the cerebral cortex. Typically, special MRI 
techniques such as double inversion recovery, phase-sensitive 
inversion recovery, and magnetisation-prepared rapid 
acquisition with gradient echo sequences are required to 
visualise these lesions.7,11,12 The lesions detected by these 
techniques are primarily of the leukocortical type; subpial 
lesions are rarely detected. Care is needed to distinguish 
potential cortical lesions from neuroimaging artefacts.7 
Dissemination in space
The development of lesions in distinct anatomical locations 
within the CNS—ie, indicating a multifocal CNS process.
Dissemination in time
The development or appearance of new CNS lesions over time.
Exacerbation
Attack, relapse, exacerbation, and (when it is the first episode) 
clinically isolated syndrome are synonyms. See clinically isolated 
syndrome and relapse for descriptions. 
Infratentorial MRI lesion
A T2-hyperintense lesion in the brainstem (typically near the 
surface), cerebellar peduncles, or cerebellum.6
Juxtacortical MRI lesion
A T2-hyperintense cerebral white matter lesion abutting the 
cortex, and not separated from it by white matter.6,7,13
Lesion
An area of hyperintensity on a T2-weighted or proton-density-
weighted MRI scan that is at least 3 mm in long axis.14
Objective clinical or paraclinical evidence (as it relates to a 
current or historical attack)
An abnormality on neurological examination, imaging (MRI or 
optical coherence tomography), or neurophysiological testing 
(visual evoked potentials) that corresponds to the anatomical 
location suggested by the symptoms of the clinically isolated 
syndrome—eg, optic disc pallor or a relative afferent pupillary 
defect, optic nerve T2 hyperintensity on MRI, retinal nerve fibre 
layer thinning on optical coherence tomography, or 
P100 latency prolongation on visual evoked potentials in a 
patient reporting a previous episode of self-limited, painful, 
monocular visual impairment. Caution should be exercised in 
accepting symptoms accompanied only by patient-reported 
subjective alteration as evidence of a current or previous attack.
Periventricular MRI lesion
A T2-hyperintense cerebral white matter lesion abutting the 
lateral ventricles without white matter in between, including 
lesions in the corpus callosum but excluding lesions in deep 
grey matter structures.6,13
Progressive course
A multiple sclerosis course characterised by steadily increasing 
objectively documented neurological disability independent of 
relapses. Fluctuations, periods of stability, and superimposed 
relapses might occur. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis 
(a progressive course from disease onset) and secondary 
progressive multiple sclerosis (a progressive course following an 
initial relapsing-remitting course) are distinguished.10
Radiologically isolated syndrome
MRI findings strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis in a 
patient with no neurological manifestations or other clear-cut 
explanation.
Relapse
A monophasic clinical episode with patient-reported symptoms 
and objective findings typical of multiple sclerosis, reflecting a 
focal or multifocal inflammatory demyelinating event in the 
CNS, developing acutely or subacutely, with a duration of at 
least 24 h, with or without recovery, and in the absence of fever 
or infection. Attack, relapse, exacerbation, and (when it is the 
first episode) clinically isolated syndrome are synonyms.
Relapsing-remitting course
A multiple sclerosis course characterised by relapses with stable 
neurological disability between episodes.10
Spinal cord MRI lesion
A hyperintense lesion in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spinal 
cord seen on T2 plus short tau inversion recovery, 
proton-density images, or other appropriate sequences, or in 
two planes on T2 images.6,7,14

frequency of misdiagnosis. The Panel strived to ensure 
that proposed changes were supported by reasonable 
evidence, not merely expert opinion.
Usefulness and applicability of the 2010 
McDonald criteria
Misdiagnosis and differential diagnosis
Before considering potential revisions of the 2010 
McDonald criteria, the Panel reviewed issues related to 
the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, appropriate use of the 
McDonald criteria, and performance of the criteria across 
patient populations.
Misdiagnosis of multiple sclerosis remains an issue in 
clinical practice,15–18 and the Panel identified several 
factors that potentially increase this risk. Multiple 
sclerosis has heterogeneous clinical and imaging 
manifestations, which differ between patients and 
change within individual patients over time. There is no 
single pathognomonic clinical feature or diagnostic test; 
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis relies on the integration 
of clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings. MRI 
abnormalities associated with other diseases and 
non-specific MRI findings, which are common in the 
general population, can be mistaken for multiple 
sclerosis. The increasingly strong focus on timely 
diagnosis to alleviate uncertainty for patients and allow 
initiation of disease-modifying therapies might also 
increase the risk of misdiagnosis.19
As with any diagnostic criteria, a trade-off exists 
between sensitivity (to allow efficient diagnosis in 
patients with multiple sclerosis) and specificity (to avoid 
erroneous diagnosis in patients who do not have the 
disease).19 The positive and negative predictive power of 
diagnostic tests depends on the pre-test probability 
(likelihood) of the disorder, which has important 
implications for the interpretation of the available data 
concerning the usefulness of such tests (panel 2).
The clinician must remain vigilant for clinical features 
or diagnostic test results that suggest the possibility of an 
alternative diagnosis, so-called red flags.9,13,20,21 A recent 
multicentre case series18 demonstrated that a wide range 
of conditions can be mistaken for multiple sclerosis. 
Aside from NMOSDs, the most frequent reason for 
misdiagnosis as multiple sclerosis was misinterpretation 
of non-specific symptoms, neurological signs, or MRI 
findings in common disorders (eg, migraine) that, when 
reviewed carefully, in most patients, would not fulfil the 
2010 McDonald criteria. Misdiagnosis had harmful 
consequences in some patients, emphasising the 
importance of appropriate application of the McDonald 
criteria (panel 3).
Interpretation and integration of the history, physical 
examination, and results of imaging and laboratory 
testing by a clinician with expertise in multiple sclerosis 
remain fundamental in making a reliable diagnosis of 
multiple sclerosis or an alternative diagnosis. It is 
important to re-emphasise that the McDonald criteria 
should be applied primarily in patients with a typical 
clinically isolated syndrome (panel 1)—ie, patients who 
already have a high likelihood of having multiple 
sclerosis. Care should be exercised in accepting historical 
events in the absence of contemporaneous or current 
objective evidence that corroborates those events 
(panel 3). As with past McDonald criteria, the Panel’s 
discussion emphasised rigour in interpreting clinical 
features and results of diagnostic tests to ensure the 
absence of atypical features and that there is no more 
appropriate diagnosis.
Applicability of the 2010 McDonald criteria in diverse 
populations
Original development of the McDonald criteria and 
subsequent revisions were largely based on data from 
adult white European and North American populations 
with a typical clinically isolated syndrome9 and age 
younger than 50 years. The applicability of the 2010 
McDonald criteria has been reported in patients from 
Canada,22 Italy,23 the Netherlands,24 Spain,25 and Russia.26 
Additional studies evaluating the applicability of the 2010 
McDonald criteria in Asian,27–29 Middle Eastern,30,31 and 
Latin American32 populations have been published since 
2010, although these studies tended to be small. These 
data provide no evidence that the 2010 McDonald criteria 
cannot be used in these populations. Vigilance is needed 
to exclude alternative diagnoses, particularly NMOSDs in 
populations such as African American, Asian, Latin 
American, and paediatric patients, in which multiple 
sclerosis is less common than in adult white European 
Panel 2: Validation of the McDonald criteria
In the context of validation of proposed diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis, the 
typical approach is to study (retrospectively or, preferably, with prospective follow-up) a 
population of patients experiencing a first symptom suggestive of multiple sclerosis (ie, a 
clinically isolated syndrome) and to categorise these patients on the basis of whether they 
fulfil the proposed diagnostic criteria and subsequently develop a second clinical attack 
that is typical of a multiple sclerosis relapse and indicates involvement of an anatomical 
location distinct from the initial attack. It is necessary to determine the rates of true 
positives (patients who fulfil the proposed diagnostic criteria and develop a second 
attack), false positives (patients who fulfil the proposed diagnostic criteria and do not 
develop a second attack), true negatives (patients who do not fulfil the proposed 
diagnostic criteria and do not develop a second attack), and false negatives (patients who 
do not fulfil the proposed diagnostic criteria and develop a second attack). Sensitivity is 
calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total of true positives plus false 
negatives; specificity is calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the total of 
true negatives plus false positives.
The performance of a diagnostic test (or, in this example, proposed diagnostic criteria) in 
terms of positive and negative predictive value depends on the likelihood of the condition 
of interest (in this example, multiple sclerosis) in the study population. The McDonald 
criteria and proposed revisions have largely been validated in patient populations that have 
a high likelihood of multiple sclerosis by virtue of their demographic features, their mode of 
recruitment, and their having had a typical clinically isolated syndrome. Their positive 
predictive value will be lower in populations with a lower likelihood of multiple sclerosis.

and North American populations. In Latin America, 
infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies that 
mimic multiple sclerosis also remain important 
considerations.33
Several studies34–41 support the applicability of the 2010 
McDonald criteria in children. The criteria are generally 
most applicable to patients who are 11 years of age or 
older; special care is needed in patients younger than 
11 years old, in whom the likelihood of multiple sclerosis 
is lower.35 Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is more 
common in children than in adults, and, although it is 
typically monophasic, some children with this disease 
have recurrent clinical episodes or MRI evidence of 
accrual of new lesions, which can lead to a diagnosis of 
multiple sclerosis.42 The Panel agreed that the 2017 
McDonald criteria should not be applied to children 
at the time of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
presentation and that occurrence of a subsequent 
attack characteristic of multiple sclerosis is necessary 
to diagnose multiple sclerosis.43 Alternative diagnoses, 
including NMOSDs, need to be excluded in all children 
in whom the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is being 
considered. Tests for antibodies reactive with myelin-
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) could be useful to 
aid diagnosis of children with NMOSDs who are 
aquaporin 4 (AQP4) seronegative, children with acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis followed by recurrent 
optic neuritis, and children with chronic relapsing optic 
neuritis.44–46 Particular care to reach a final diagnosis is 
required in children with presentations with features 
overlapping those of acute disseminated encephalo-
myelitis, NMOSDs, and multiple sclerosis. 
Although multiple sclerosis typically presents between 
the ages of 20 years and 50 years, approximately 0·5% of 
adults with this disease have symptom onset at the age of 
60 years or older.47,48 Older individuals are more likely to 
have a progressive course at presentation—progressive 
either from onset or following retrospectively recognised 
attacks—but occasionally they present with an acute 
attack. Careful attention to alternative diagnoses and 
particularly comorbidities is necessary. Age-related 
vascular white matter lesions might occasionally be peri-
ventricular, and seeking more than one periventricular 
lesion with a morphology characteristic of multiple 
sclerosis might be prudent in this setting. Consideration 
of multiple sclerosis in an older individual is an example 
of a diagnostic scenario in which spinal cord MRI or CSF 
examination to look for findings that support a multiple 
sclerosis diagnosis or suggest a different diagnosis is 
advised. With these caveats, the Panel agreed that the 
2010 McDonald criteria are likely to be applicable in older 
patients, but recommended further studies to validate the 
2017 McDonald criteria in this population.
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders
Substantial data concerning NMOSDs have emerged 
since the publication of the 2010 McDonald criteria. 
Although clinical, imaging, and CSF features of multiple 
sclerosis and NMOSDs can overlap, these disorders are 
now understood to be distinct.49 Diagnosis of NMOSDs 
has been facilitated by the development and use of 
serological testing for antibodies reactive with the AQP4 
water channel and validation of the antibodies not only 
as markers of NMOSDs but also as pathogenic factors.50,51 
The range of recognised clinical and MRI manifestations 
of AQP4-associated NMOSDs is wide and still evolving. 
Data suggest that some AQP4-seronegative patients with 
NMOSD features have antibodies reactive with MOG.52–56 
However, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 
anti-MOG antibody testing have not been fully validated.
The Panel agreed that the 2010 McDonald criteria and 
2015 International Panel for Neuromyelitis Optica 
Diagnosis criteria57 largely distinguish multiple sclerosis 
from NMOSDs, although uncertainty can occur, 
particularly with AQP4-seronegative patients. Because the 
treatments for multiple sclerosis and NMOSDs are 
different (eg, interferon beta, fingolimod, and natalizumab 
can exacerbate NMOSDs58), the Panel recommended that 
NMOSDs should be considered in any patient being 
evaluated for multiple sclerosis. Serological testing for 
AQP4 and for MOG should be done in all patients with 
features suggesting NMOSDs (such as bilateral optic 
neuritis, severe brainstem involvement, longitudinally 
extensive spinal cord lesions, large cerebral lesions, or 
Panel 3: Considerations to help avoid misdiagnosis of multiple sclerosis
• 
Recognise that the McDonald criteria were not developed to differentiate multiple 
sclerosis from other conditions but to identify multiple sclerosis or a high likelihood of 
the disease in patients with a typical clinically isolated syndrome once other diagnoses 
have been deemed unlikely.
• 
Integration of the history, examination, imaging, and laboratory evidence by a clinician 
with multiple sclerosis-related expertise remains fundamental in making a reliable 
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis or an alternative diagnosis. In addition to confirming 
dissemination in space and time, diagnostic rigour in the interpretation of clinical data, 
imaging findings, and test results is necessary.
• 
In the absence of a clear-cut typical clinically isolated syndrome (panel 1), caution 
should be exercised in making the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and the diagnosis 
should be confirmed by further clinical and radiological follow-up. In such cases, the 
clinician should consider postponing making a definitive diagnosis and initiation of 
long-term disease-modifying therapies, pending longer follow-up to accumulate 
additional evidence supporting the diagnosis.
• 
Caution should be taken in accepting a historical event as an attack in the absence of 
contemporaneous or current objective evidence providing corroboration.
• 
The threshold for additional testing should be low, including for spinal cord MRI or 
CSF examination in the following situations: when clinical and brain MRI evidence 
supporting a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is insufficient, particularly if initiation of 
long-term disease-modifying therapies are being considered; when there is a 
presentation other than a typical clinically isolated syndrome, including patients with 
a progressive course at onset (primary progressive multiple sclerosis); when there are 
clinical, imaging, or laboratory features atypical of multiple sclerosis; and in 
populations in which multiple sclerosis is less common (eg, children, older individuals, 
or non-white populations).

normal brain MRI or findings not fulfilling dissemination 
in space [DIS]), and considered in groups at higher risk of 
NMOSDs (such as African American, Asian, Latin 
American, and paediatric populations).
Role of MRI in diagnosis of multiple sclerosis
MRI has been increasingly used to support the diagnosis 
of multiple sclerosis and to look for atypical radiological 
features arguing against this diagnosis. MAGNIMS and 
the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers recently 
proposed standardised MRI protocols for the diagnostic 
process, to determine prognosis, and for follow-up.14,59,60 
Brain and spinal cord MRI remain the most useful 
paraclinical tests to aid the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis 
and can substitute for clinical findings in the 
determination of DIS or dissemination in time (DIT) in 
patients with a typical clinically isolated syndrome.
The Panel recommended that brain MRI be obtained 
in all patients being considered for a diagnosis of 
multiple sclerosis, recognising that it might at times 
not be possible because of availability, cost, or contra-
indication. There was general agreement that, although 
spinal MRI is not mandatory in all cases, it is advisable 
when the presentation suggests a spinal cord localisation, 
when there is a primary progressive course, when 
considering multiple sclerosis in a population in which 
the disease is less common (eg, older individuals or 
non-white populations), or when additional data are 
needed to increase diagnostic confidence (eg, when brain 
MRI findings only just fulfil the criteria for DIS).14,60 
Spinal MRI seems to be less useful in the diagnosis of 
multiple sclerosis in children than in adults.39
Role of CSF examination in diagnosis of multiple 
sclerosis
Although CSF examination has been de-emphasised in 
successive iterations of the McDonald criteria, it remains 
a valuable diagnostic test.61 In the appropriate clinical 
setting, evidence of intrathecal antibody synthesis, 
although not specific for multiple sclerosis, supports the 
diagnosis.62 Conversely, CSF findings atypical of multiple 
sclerosis (eg, an elevated protein concentration of 
>100 mg/dL, pleocytosis with >50 cells per mm³, or the 
presence of neutrophils, eosinophils, or atypical cells) 
suggest other diseases.63
The Panel’s discussion of CSF recognised the importance 
of using appropriate and standardised technology.62–64 The 
qualitative demonstration of two or more CSF-specific 
oligoclonal bands more reliably indicates intrathecal 
antibody synthesis than do other tests, such as the IgG 
index.62–64 Positive results on these other tests should be 
interpreted with caution when testing for oligoclonal 
bands is negative or not done. The sensitivity of oligoclonal 
band testing depends on the method used; agarose gel 
electrophoresis with isoelectric focusing and immuno-
blotting or immunofixation for IgG is the most sensitive 
approach at present.62–64 Importantly, analysis of paired 
CSF and serum samples is essential to confirm that the 
oligoclonal bands are unique to CSF.
Although CSF examination is not mandatory in some 
cases (eg, a patient with a typical clinically isolated 
syndrome supported by characteristic MRI findings 
[panel 1], unequivocal demonstration of DIS and DIT, 
and an absence of atypical clinical or imaging features), 
the threshold for CSF examination should be low to 
increase diagnostic confidence. CSF examination is 
strongly recommended in the following situations: when 
clinical and MRI evidence is insufficient to support a 
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, particularly if initiation of 
disease-modifying therapies is being considered; when 
there is a presentation other than a typical clinically 
isolated syndrome, including a progressive course at 
onset (primary progressive multiple sclerosis); when 
clinical, imaging, or laboratory features are atypical of 
multiple sclerosis; and in populations in which multiple 
sclerosis is less common (eg, children, older individuals, 
or non-white populations). Although the absence of CSF 
oligoclonal bands does not rule out multiple sclerosis, 
particularly early in the condition and in children,62,63 
caution should be exercised in making this diagnosis 
when CSF oligoclonal bands are not detected and, 
certainly, in the presence of atypical clinical, imaging, or 
CSF findings.
2017 revisions to the McDonald criteria
CSF oligoclonal bands
Numerous studies65–73 have provided evidence that, in 
adult patients with a clinically isolated syndrome, CSF 
oligoclonal bands are an independent predictor of the 
risk of a second attack when controlling for demographic, 
clinical, treatment, and MRI variables. After considering 
these data, the Panel recommended that with a typical 
clinically isolated syndrome, fulfilment of clinical or MRI 
criteria for DIS, and no better explanation for the clinical 
presentation, demonstration of CSF oligoclonal bands in 
the absence of atypical CSF findings allows a diagnosis of 
multiple sclerosis to be made, even if the MRI findings 
on the baseline scan do not meet the criteria for DIT and 
in the absence of either a second attack or MRI evidence 
of a new or active lesion on serial imaging (table; 
panel 4).73 This consensus recommendation allows the 
presence of CSF oligoclonal bands to substitute for the 
requirement of fulfilling DIT in this situation. This 
criterion is similar to the laboratory-supported definite 
multiple sclerosis category in the earlier Poser criteria.2
Symptomatic lesions as evidence for dissemination in 
space and time 
Previously, the symptomatic lesion in a patient presenting 
with brainstem or spinal cord clinically isolated syndrome 
could not be included as MRI evidence of DIS or DIT, to 
avoid so-called double counting. Studies in the past year 
have shown that inclusion of symptomatic lesions in the 
MRI determination of DIS or DIT increases diagnostic

sensitivity with little or no reduction in specificity74,75 and 
was proposed in the 2016 MAGNIMS criteria.7,76 On the 
basis of these data, the Panel recommended including 
symptomatic and asymptomatic MRI lesions in the 
determination of DIS and DIT (panel 5). An exception 
relates to lesions in the optic nerve in a patient presenting 
with optic neuritis, as the Panel felt evidence was 
insufficient to support inclusion of the optic nerve as a 
site to determine DIS in these patients.
Cortical lesions equivalent to juxtacortical lesions
Juxtacortical white matter is a characteristic location of 
multiple sclerosis lesions (panel 1), and lesions in this 
region were incorporated into the MRI criteria for DIS in 
the 1997 Barkhof imaging criteria.77 Histopathological 
studies have shown that cortical lesions and juxtacortical 
lesions extending into the cortex are typical of multiple 
sclerosis.78,79 With the development of improved techniques 
to identify cortical lesions, their potential to contribute 
to diagnosis has been appreciated.11,12,76 The Panel 
recommended that, in addition to juxtacortical lesions, 
cortical lesions can be used to fulfil MRI criteria for DIS, 
although it recognised that standard MRI currently has 
limited ability to detect cortical lesions or distinguish 
cortical lesions in multiple sclerosis from those with other 
causes. In addition, care is needed to distinguish potential 
cortical lesions from neuroimaging artefacts.
Application in multiple sclerosis subtypes
About 15% of patients with multiple sclerosis have a 
course that is characterised by gradual progression from 
onset (primary progressive multiple sclerosis).10 The 
original McDonald criteria were developed to make the 
diagnosis in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome 
at onset and then modified for use in patients with 
progression from onset. The diagnostic criteria for 
primary progressive multiple sclerosis remain the same 
in the 2017 McDonald criteria as those outlined in the 
2010 McDonald criteria,5 aside from removal of the 
distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic 
MRI lesions and the use of cortical lesions (panel 6). 
The 2013 revised classification10 of the clinical 
phenotypes and disease course of multiple sclerosis 
maintained the distinction between multiple sclerosis 
with an attack onset versus a progressive course from 
onset. The revised classification incorporated further 
categorisation as active or not (based on recent clinical 
relapse or MRI lesion activity) and progressive or not 
(based on clinical assessment of disability). The intent 
was for patients to be assessed over time and classified 
(and reclassified as needed) according to the disease 
course in a preceding time period (eg, 1 year). The Panel 
recommended that a provisional disease course should 
be specified as soon as the multiple sclerosis diagnosis 
is made, and periodically re-evaluated based on 
accumulated information.
Key proposals that require further evidence
Number of periventricular lesions
The 20013 and 20054 McDonald criteria required three or 
more periventricular lesions as one of the anatomical 
locations that could fulfil MRI criteria for DIS. In the 
2010 McDonald criteria,5 this requirement was changed 
to one or more periventricular lesions as one of the

If the 2017 McDonald Criteria are fulfilled and there is no better explanation for the clinical presentation, the diagnosis is multiple sclerosis. If multiple sclerosis is suspected by 
virtue of a clinically isolated syndrome but the 2017 McDonald Criteria are not completely met, the diagnosis is possible multiple sclerosis. If another diagnosis arises during the 
evaluation that better explains the clinical presentation, the diagnosis is not multiple sclerosis. An attack is defined in panel 1. *No additional tests are required to demonstrate 
dissemination in space and time. However, unless MRI is not possible, brain MRI should be obtained in all patients in whom the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is being 
considered. In addition, spinal cord MRI or CSF examination should be considered in patients with insufficient clinical and MRI evidence supporting multiple sclerosis, with a 
presentation other than a typical clinically isolated syndrome, or with atypical features. If imaging or other tests (eg, CSF) are undertaken and are negative, caution needs to be 
taken before making a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and alternative diagnoses should be considered. †Clinical diagnosis based on objective clinical findings for two attacks is 
most secure. Reasonable historical evidence for one past attack, in the absence of documented objective neurological findings, can include historical events with symptoms 
and evolution characteristic for a previous inflammatory demyelinating attack; at least one attack, however, must be supported by objective findings. In the absence of residual 
objective evidence, caution is needed. ‡The MRI criteria for dissemination in space are described in panel 5. §The MRI criteria for dissemination in time are described in panel 5. 
¶The presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands does not demonstrate dissemination in time per se but can substitute for the requirement for demonstration of this measure.

four anatomical locations (periventricular, juxtacortical, 
and infratentorial brain regions, and the spinal cord). 
However, non-specific white matter lesions are common 
in older individuals and in those with vascular risk 
factors including migraine; a single periventricular 
lesion is not uncommon.13 Therefore, the 2016 
MAGNIMS criteria7 suggested that a single lesion might 
be insufficiently specific and proposed increasing the 
requirement to three periventricular lesions. In a 
recent analysis,76 changing the requirement from one 
periventricular lesion to three improved specificity of 
predicting development of a second attack by month 36 
from 0·33 to 0·40 but decreased sensitivity from 0·91 to 
0·85. The Panel felt the modest improvement in 
specificity, which is comparable to that achieved when 
DIS and DIT are considered in combination,80,81 did not 
justify the added complexity of requiring a different 
number of lesions in different anatomical regions. 
Therefore, the 2017 McDonald criteria maintain the 
requirement for one periventricular lesion. For some 
patients—eg, older individuals or those with vascular 
risk factors including migraine—it might be prudent 
for the clinician to seek a higher number of 
periventricular lesions.
Incorporation of the anterior visual system into the 
criteria
The visual system often provides an early and eloquent 
clinical sign of multiple sclerosis.82 The 2016 MAGNIMS 
criteria7 proposed the optic nerve as a fifth anatomical 
location to fulfil MRI criteria for DIS. In the 2017 
Panel deliberations, there was substantial discussion 
concerning the potential advantages and disadvantages 
of MRI, visual evoked potentials, and optical coherence 
tomography to demonstrate optic nerve involvement 
objectively and support a clinical suspicion of current or 
previous optic neuritis, including changes in the 
sensitivity of all three tests over time relative to the optic 
neuritis event.82 The MAGNIMS analysis76 showed that 
adding optic nerve involvement detected by MRI or 
visual evoked potentials as a fifth anatomical site led to 
a minor improvement in sensitivity of predicting 
development of a second attack by month 36, from 
0·91 to 0·92, but reduced specificity from 0·33 from 0·26. 
The analysis did not include optical coherence 
tomography. Despite recognising optic nerve involvement 
as an important feature of multiple sclerosis, the Panel 
felt the data concerning the diagnostic sensitivity and 
specificity of MRI, visual evoked potentials, or optical 
coherence tomography to demonstrate optic nerve 
lesions in patients without a clear-cut history or clinical 
evidence of optic neuritis were insufficient to support 
incorporation into the McDonald criteria at this time. 
Studies to validate MRI, visual evoked potentials, or 
optical coherence tomography in fulfilling DIS or DIT in 
support of a multiple sclerosis diagnosis were identified 
as a high priority.
Applicability of the McDonald criteria in patients with 
atypical presentations
Radiologically isolated syndrome
With increasing availability and use of MRI, incidental 
T2 hyperintensities on brain imaging are common;83 the 
subset of individuals with MRI findings that are strongly 
suggestive of multiple sclerosis lesions but with no 
neurological manifestations or other clear-cut explanation 
are said to have radiologically isolated syndrome.84 Data 
concerning the population-based incidence and prevalence 
of radiologically isolated syndrome are scarce but suggest 
Panel 4: 2017 revisions to the McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis
• 
In a patient with a typical clinically isolated syndrome and fulfilment of clinical or 
MRI criteria for dissemination in space and no better explanation for the clinical 
presentation, demonstration of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands in the absence of 
other CSF findings atypical of multiple sclerosis allows a diagnosis of this disease to 
be made. This recommendation is an addition to the 2010 McDonald criteria.
• 
Symptomatic and asymptomatic MRI lesions can be considered in the determination of 
dissemination in space or time. MRI lesions in the optic nerve in a patient presenting 
with optic neuritis remain an exception and, owing to insufficient evidence, cannot be 
used in fulfilling the McDonald criteria. In the 2010 McDonald criteria, the symptomatic 
lesion in a patient presenting with brainstem or spinal cord syndrome could not be 
included as MRI evidence of dissemination in space or time.
• 
Cortical and juxtacortical lesions can be used in fulfilling MRI criteria for dissemination 
in space. Cortical lesions could not be used in fulfilling MRI criteria for dissemination in 
space in the 2010 McDonald criteria.
• 
The diagnostic criteria for primary progressive multiple sclerosis in the 2017 McDonald 
criteria remain the same as those outlined in the 2010 McDonald criteria, aside from 
removal of the distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic MRI lesions and 
that cortical lesions can be used.
• 
At the time of diagnosis, a provisional disease course should be specified 
(relapsing-remitting, primary progressive, or secondary progressive) and whether the 
course is active or not, and progressive or not based on the previous year’s history. The 
phenotype should be periodically re-evaluated based on accumulated information. This 
recommendation is an addition to the 2010 McDonald criteria.
Panel 5: 2017 McDonald criteria for demonstration of dissemination in space and 
time by MRI in a patient with a clinically isolated syndrome
• 
Dissemination in space can be demonstrated by one or more T2-hyperintense lesions* 
that are characteristic of multiple sclerosis in two or more of four areas of the CNS: 
periventricular,† cortical or juxtacortical, and infratentorial brain regions, and the 
spinal cord
• 
Dissemination in time can be demonstrated by the simultaneous presence of 
gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions* at any time or by a new 
T2-hyperintense or gadolinium-enhancing lesion on follow-up MRI, with reference to 
a baseline scan, irrespective of the timing of the baseline MRI
*Unlike the 2010 McDonald criteria, no distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic MRI lesions is required. †For some 
patients—eg, individuals older than 50 years or those with vascular risk factors—it might be prudent for the clinician to seek a 
higher number of periventricular lesions.

that it is uncommon (in Sweden, the incidence is 0·8 cases 
of radiologically isolated syndrome per 100 000 person-years 
compared with 10·2 cases of multiple sclerosis per 
100 000 person-years85), but prevalence is increased in 
healthy relatives of patients with multiple sclerosis.86 
Approximately a third of individuals with radiologically 
isolated syndrome are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 
within 5 years of presentation, most often with a relapsing-
remitting course84,87 but occasionally with a primary 
progressive course.88,89 The factors predicting an increased 
risk of subsequent multiple sclerosis diagnosis are similar 
to those associated with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis 
after a clinically isolated syndrome: younger age, higher 
cerebral lesion load, asymptomatic infratentorial or spinal 
cord lesions, gadolinium-enhancing lesions, CSF-specific 
oligoclonal 
bands, 
and 
abnormal 
visual 
evoked 
potentials.88,90
Some Panel members argued that individuals with 
radiologically isolated syndrome have a high likelihood of 
having multiple sclerosis and might already exhibit 
evidence of putative pathobiology, including fatigue,91 
cognitive impairment,92 or thalamic atrophy,93 and that 
postponing the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and 
initiation of disease-modifying therapies might increase 
the risk of disability. Others argued that the risk of 
misdiagnosis is high in patients with MRI abnormalities 
only,18 and that two-thirds of these patients will not receive 
a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis within 5 years. The Panel 
reached a consensus to continue to require clinical 
manifestations to make the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis 
and, as in the 2010 McDonald criteria, to allow the use of 
historical radiological evidence for DIS and DIT in 
patients with radiologically isolated syndrome to support 
the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis once a typical clinically 
isolated syndrome occurs. Although the Panel considered 
allowing a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in patients with 
radiologically isolated syndrome, demonstration of DIS 
and DIT by MRI, and demonstration of CSF-specific 
oligoclonal bands, this proposal did not receive general 
support. Radiologically isolated syndrome was identified 
as a high-priority area for further research.
Solitary sclerosis
The Panel discussed rare patients who have an 
inflammatory lesion of the cerebral white matter, 
cervicomedullary junction, or spinal cord who develop 
progressive disability that is clinically indistinguishable 
from progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and who 
might have CSF-specific oligoclonal bands but have no 
clinical or radiological evidence of new lesion formation—a 
condition that has been termed progressive solitary 
sclerosis.94 The Panel agreed that despite a progressive 
course, such patients do not satisfy the McDonald criteria 
for multiple sclerosis, because they do not have DIS. Like 
radiologically isolated syndrome, solitary sclerosis was 
identified as a high-priority area for further research.
Possible multiple sclerosis
The 2010 McDonald criteria5 include a diagnostic 
category of possible multiple sclerosis, defined as a 
suspicion of multiple sclerosis (ie, a patient with a 
clinically isolated syndrome but not meeting the full 
criteria). The Panel considered expanding the category 
of possible multiple sclerosis to include patients with 
atypical presentations, but did not reach a consensus. 
Validation of future criteria to inform about presentations 
that only partially fulfil the 2017 McDonald criteria 
(such as radiologically isolated syndrome, solitary 
sclerosis, or other atypical presentations) needs more 
focused collaborative studies, in particular because such 
presentations are uncommon. 
Other high-priority areas for research
Many of the elements of the McDonald criteria have come 
from data from academic multiple sclerosis specialty 
centres and have been derived largely from adult patients 
of western European genetic or ethnic origins presenting 
with a typical clinically isolated syndrome (ie, patients 
with a high likelihood of multiple sclerosis). Validation 
of the 2017 McDonald criteria, either prospectively or 
retrospectively, will be needed in diverse populations: 
patients from Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, 
and other relatively less studied geographical locations; 
patients with suspected paediatric and late-onset multiple 
sclerosis; patients with comorbidities that are associated 
with clinical or imaging manifestations that overlap those 
of multiple sclerosis; and in non-specialty and general 
practice clinical settings.
In addition to validation of the 2016 MAGNIMS criteria 
individually, the Panel identified further studies to 
evaluate the performance of the 2016 MAGNIMS criteria 
when applied in aggregate as a high priority. New MRI 
approaches also will need to be considered for future 
iterations of the McDonald criteria. Currently, the only 
feature to assess the chronicity of MRI lesions at the 
time of first assessment is the presence or absence of 
gadolinium 
enhancement.

Panel 6: 2017 McDonald criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in patients with a 
disease course characterised by progression from onset (primary progressive 
multiple sclerosis)
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis can be diagnosed in patients with:
• 
1 year of disability progression (retrospectively or prospectively determined) 
independent of clinical relapse
Plus two of the following criteria:
• 
One or more T2-hyperintense lesions* characteristic of multiple sclerosis in one or 
more of the following brain regions: periventricular, cortical or juxtacortical, or 
infratentorial
• 
Two or more T2-hyperintense lesions* in the spinal cord
• 
Presence of CSF-specific oligoclonal bands

lesions (so-called black holes) were shown not to aid in 
the determination of DIT.95 The role in multiple sclerosis 
diagnosis of more sensitive imaging methods to detect 
grey matter pathology (particularly to demonstrate 
subpial cortical and deep grey matter lesions78) and 
techniques to distinguish multiple sclerosis lesions from 
T2 hyperintensities in other conditions (eg, central vein 
sign on susceptibility-weighted, T2*-weighted, or FLAIR* 
images96 or paramagnetic rim on T2*-weighted, phase-
weighted, or susceptibility-weighted images97,98) are being 
explored. The role of high field strength imaging requires 
detailed investigation to determine whether it is useful 
and practical, particularly in non-academic settings, in 
view of its improved ability to detect lesions and reveal 
their anatomical features.
Currently, no laboratory test in isolation confirms the 
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Although AQP4 serological 
testing generally differentiates NMOSDs from multiple 
sclerosis,50 less is known about the performance of testing 
for MOG antibodies.46,52–54 Other diagnostic biomarkers 
have been proposed to differentiate between multiple 
sclerosis phenotypes or to monitor CNS damage, but none 
has been shown to diagnose multiple sclerosis reliably in 
individual patients, representing a major unmet need and 
area for future research. Finally, the possible contribution 
of evoked potential investigations besides visual evoked 
potentials (eg, somatosensory or motor) to diagnostic 
criteria should be further explored. With the growing 
interest in precision medicine and rapidly evolving 
technologies, the multiple sclerosis research community 
needs to develop an approach for the validation of all 
paraclinical tests for multiple sclerosis diagnosis and 
incorporation of these tests into practice when appropriate.
Conclusions
Early diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis were based 
primarily on clinical evidence.1 Subsequent criteria 
incorporated imaging and other paraclinical markers in 
response to technological advances and new data.2–5 The 
2017 revisions to the well established 2010 McDonald 
criteria revitalise the role of CSF analysis, reconsider the 
value of imaging findings previously not included (sympto-
matic and cortical lesions), and articulate more clearly 
cautions about misdiagnosis and differential diagnosis, all 
of which were supported by a sound evidence base.
The 2017 McDonald criteria are intended for use both 
in research settings and clinical practice. The Panel 
recognised that application of new diagnostic criteria 
can have an impact on future recruitment into and 
interpretation of clinical trials and observational 
studies.99 The ability to diagnose multiple sclerosis 
accurately and more rapidly should facilitate enrolment 
in prospective clinical trials, and could increase the 
populations of individuals eligible for observational and 
natural history studies. None of these changes is 
anticipated to invalidate the diagnosis of multiple 
sclerosis according to previous versions of the McDonald 
criteria (ie, any patient diagnosed with the previous 
criteria should also fulfil the 2017 McDonald criteria), or 
affect the regulatory-approved indications of disease-
modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis.
Although diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is increasingly 
based on paraclinical tests, optimal diagnosis requires 
the judgment of a clinician with multiple sclerosis-related 
expertise, aided by appropriate radiological and other 
paraclinical assessments. The 2017 McDonald criteria 
are not treatment guidelines. The goal is to make a rapid 
and accurate diagnosis of multiple sclerosis to allow 
appropriate management (initiation of treatment or 
observation), keeping fully in mind the potential dangers 
of misdiagnosis in an era with increasing numbers of 
treatment options for multiple sclerosis, which carry 
varying degrees of risk. The importance of correct 
diagnosis is further heightened by the observation that 
certain disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis 
are contraindicated in some of the more common 
differential diagnoses (eg, NMOSDs). The Panel was also 
mindful of the challenges many patients experience in 
gaining access to clinicians with multiple sclerosis-
related expertise and advocated a concerted global effort 
to address this crucial workforce gap.
