Background
Prophylactic removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth is surgical removal of wisdom teeth in the absence of
symptoms and with no evidence of local disease. Impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with pathological changes, such as
pericoronitis, root resorption, gum and alveolar bone disease (periodontitis), caries and the development of cysts and tumours. When
surgical removal is carried out in older people, the risk of postoperative complications, pain and discomfort is increased. Other reasons to
justify prophylactic removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted third molars have included preventing late lower incisor crowding,
preventing damage to adjacent structures such as the second molar or the inferior alveolar nerve, in preparation for orthognathic surgery,
in preparation for radiotherapy or during procedures to treat people with trauma to the affected area. Removal of asymptomatic disease-
free wisdom teeth is a common procedure, and researchers must determine whether evidence supports this practice. This review is an
update of an existing review published in 2012.
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of removal compared with retention (conservative management) of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom
teeth in adolescents and adults.
Search methods
We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (to 24 May 2016), the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 May 2016) and Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 May
2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing
and unpublished studies to 24 May 2016. We imposed no restrictions on language or date of publication in our search of electronic
databases.

 Selection criteria
Studies comparing removal (or absence) with retention (or presence) of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth in adolescents
or adults. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no restriction on length of follow-up, if available. We considered
quasi-RCTs and prospective cohort studies for inclusion if investigators measured outcomes with follow-up of five years or longer.
Data collection and analysis
Eight review authors screened search results and assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion according to the review inclusion criteria.
Eight review authors independently conducted risk of bias assessments in duplicate. When information was unclear, we contacted study
authors for additional information.
Main results
This review includes two studies. The previous review included one RCT with a parallel-group design, which was conducted in a
dental hospital setting in the United Kingdom; our new search for this update identified one prospective cohort study conducted in
the private sector in the USA.
Primary outcome
No eligible studies in this review reported the effects of removal compared with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom
teeth on health-related quality of life
Secondary outcomes
We found only low to very low quality evidence of the effects of removal compared with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted
wisdom teeth for a limited number of secondary outcome measures.
One prospective cohort study, reporting data from a subgroup of 416 healthy male participants, aged 24 to 84 years, compared the
effect of the absence (previous removal or agenesis) against the presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth on
periodontitis and caries associated with the distal of the adjacent second molar during a follow-up period of three to over 25 years. Very
low quality evidence suggests that the presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased
risk of periodontitis affecting the adjacent second molar in the long term. In the same study, which is at serious risk of bias, there is
insufficient evidence to demonstrate a difference in caries risk associated with the presence or absence of impacted wisdom teeth.
One RCT with 164 randomised and 77 analysed adolescent participants compared the effect of extraction with retention of asymp-
tomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth on dimensional changes in the dental arch after five years. Participants (55% female) had
previously undergone orthodontic treatment and had ’crowded’ wisdom teeth. No evidence from this study, which was at high risk
of bias, was found to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has a clinically significant effect on
dimensional changes in the dental arch.
The included studies did not measure our other secondary outcomes: costs, other adverse events associated with retention of asymp-
tomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection)
and adverse effects associated with their removal (alveolar osteitis/postoperative infection, nerve injury, damage to adjacent teeth during
surgery, bleeding, osteonecrosis related to medication/radiotherapy, inflammation/infection).
Authors’ conclusions
Insufficient evidence is available to determine whether or not asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth should be removed.
Although asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased risk of periodontitis affecting adjacent
second molars in the long term, the evidence is of very low quality. Well-designed RCTs investigating long-term and rare effects of
retention and removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, in a representative group of individuals, are unlikely to be
feasible. In their continuing absence, high quality, long-term prospective cohort studies may provide valuable evidence in the future.
Given the lack of available evidence, patient values should be considered and clinical expertise used to guide shared decision making
with patients who have asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. If the decision is made to retain asymptomatic disease-free
impacted wisdom teeth, clinical assessment at regular intervals to prevent undesirable outcomes is advisable.

 Surgical removal versus retention for the management of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth
Review question
This review, produced through Cochrane Oral Health, seeks to assess the effects of removal compared with conservative management
of impacted wisdom teeth, in the absence of symptoms and without evidence of local disease, in adolescents and adults. This is an
update of an existing review published in 2012.
Background
Wisdom teeth, or third molars, generally erupt between the ages of 17 and 26 years. These are the last teeth to erupt, and they normally
erupt into a position closely behind the last standing teeth (second molars). Space for these teeth to erupt can be limited. Wisdom
teeth often fail to erupt or erupt only partially, which is often due to impaction of the wisdom teeth against the second molars (teeth
directly in front of the wisdom teeth). In most cases, this occurs when second molars are blocking the path of eruption of third molar
teeth and act as a physical barrier, preventing complete eruption. An impacted wisdom tooth is called asymptomatic and disease-free
in the absence of signs and symptoms of disease affecting the wisdom tooth or nearby structures.
Impacted wisdom teeth can cause swelling and ulceration of the gums around the wisdom teeth, damage to the roots of second molars,
decay in second molars, gum and bone disease around second molars and development of cysts or tumours. General agreement exists
that removal of wisdom teeth is appropriate if signs or symptoms of disease related to the wisdom teeth are present. Less agreement
exists about the appropriate management of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth.
Study characteristics
We searched the medical literature up to May 2016 and found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and one prospective cohort
study to include in this review. These studies involved 493 participants in total. The RCT conducted at a dental hospital in the UK
included 77 adolescent male and female participants, and the cohort study conducted at a private dental clinic in the USA involved
416 men aged 24 to 84 years.
Key results
Available evidence is insufficient to show whether or not asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth should be removed.
One study at serious risk of bias provided very low quality evidence suggesting that the presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted
wisdom teeth is associated with increased risk of periodontitis (infection of the gums) affecting the adjacent second molar (teeth directly
in front of the wisdom teeth) in the long term. In the same study, no evidence was found to suggest that the presence of asymptomatic
disease-free impacted wisdom teeth increases the risk of caries affecting the adjacent second molar.
Another study, also at high risk of bias, found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth
has an effect on crowding in the dental arch.
The included studies did not measure our primary outcome - health-related quality of life. Nor did they measure our secondary
outcomes - costs, other adverse events associated with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth (pericoronitis,
root resorption, cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection) and adverse effects associated with their removal (alveolar
osteitis/postoperative infection, nerve injury, damage to adjacent teeth during surgery, bleeding, osteonecrosis related to medication/
radiotherapy, inflammation/infection).
Quality of the evidence
Evidence provided by the two studies included in this review is of low to very low quality, so we cannot rely on these findings. High-
quality research is urgently needed to support clinical practice in this area. In light of the lack of available evidence, patient values
should be considered and clinical expertise used when treatment decisions are made with patients who have asymptomatic disease-
free impacted wisdom teeth. If the decision is made to retain asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, clinical assessment at
regular intervals is advisable to prevent undesirable outcomes.

*The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes. The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on
the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI). CI: confidence interval; RR: risk ratio
GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate
a Results were presented at tooth level, not at participant level. However, adjusted RRs were presented at participant level
bObservational study downgraded one level for serious risk of bias due to confounding and missing data
cOnly male participants were included, which does not reflect the overall population. No direct causal effect of gender and

 dParticipants enrolled in the study and returning for follow-up are likely to be more health aware than their age-matched peers
in the community, and to practise better health behaviours. This would suggest more motivated participants in this study
compared with the overall population. The presented significant effect may be greater in the overall population; however, we
have not upgraded the quality of evidence for plausible confounding
eOwing to the wide CI, this outcome was downgraded one level for imprecision
f RCT downgraded one level for risk of bias owing to ’some limitations’ for multiple criteria (allocation concealment and
incomplete outcome data), sufficient to lower confidence in the estimate of effect
gOwing to the small number of participants and the high rate of loss to follow-up, the quality of evidence was downgraded
one level for imprecision

Description of the condition
Wisdom teeth, or third molars, generally erupt between the ages
of 17 and 26 years (Venta 1999; Kruger 2001). More than other
teeth, wisdom teeth can fail to erupt or can erupt only partially,
with a worldwide impaction prevalence of 24% (Carter 2015). Im-
paction occurs when complete eruption into a normal functional
position is prevented and completion of root growth is fully estab-
lished. This can be due to lack of space (in the mouth), obstruc-
tion by another tooth or development in an abnormal position
(Venta 1999). A tooth that is completely impacted can be entirely
covered by soft tissue, covered partially by bone and soft tissue
or completely covered by bone. Partial eruption occurs when the
tooth is visible in the dental arch but has not erupted into a normal
functional position (RCS England 1997). Impacted wisdom teeth
have been associated with pathological changes such as pericoro-
nitis, root resorption, periodontal disease, caries and development
of cysts or tumours. An impacted wisdom tooth is called ’trou-
ble-free’ if the patient does not experience signs or symptoms of
associated pain or discomfort (Song 1997). Other terms used in
the literature include ’disease-free’ and ’asymptomatic’ (Dodson
2012).
The prevalence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted third mo-
lars varies widely and is influenced by age, sex and ethnicity
(Bradley 1996). Impaction of wisdom teeth in the lower jaw is
more common than in the upper jaw (Carter 2015; Celikoglu
2010). Most of the difficulties that follow surgical removal, such as
postoperative morbidity, pain, discomfort and restricted activity,
are related to lower wisdom teeth (Bienstock 2011).
When an impacted wisdom tooth cause pathological changes or
pain, the tooth is no longer trouble-free. General agreement indi-
cates that a wisdom tooth should be removed if pathology or symp-
toms are present. However, the management of asymptomatic dis-
ease-free wisdom teeth remains controversial (Kandasamy 2009).
Description of the intervention
Prophylactic removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wis-
dom teeth is defined as the surgical removal of wisdom teeth in the
absence of symptoms and with no evidence of local disease. Many
dentists and their patients believe that removal of asymptomatic
disease-free wisdom teeth is justified to avoid future complica-
tions associated with these teeth. When surgical removal is car-
ried out on older patients, the risk of postoperative complications
is increased (Brokaw 1991; Chuang 2007; Mercier 1992; Tate
1994). An impacted wisdom tooth almost never has a functional
role in the mouth and might increase risks of caries, periodontal
disease and external root resorption associated with the adjacent
second molar (Fisher 2012; Oenning 2015). Another argument
often given for the removal of asymptomatic wisdom teeth is to
prevent late lower incisor crowding.
Removal of impacted wisdom teeth is a common surgical proce-
dure with significant associated costs (Renton 2012). Short-term
adverse effects of the removal of wisdom teeth include temporary
nerve damage, alveolar osteitis (dry socket), infection, secondary
haemorrhage, pain, swelling and trismus (restricted mouth open-
ing). Long-term adverse effects of third molar surgery are uncom-
mon but can include permanent nerve damage (in up to 1% of
cases) and damage to adjacent teeth during surgery (Kandasamy
2009).
Retention of impacted wisdom teeth is defined as monitoring
the status of wisdom teeth. To avoid adverse effects and the cost
of removal of wisdom teeth, some advocate retention of asymp-
tomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth (e.g. NICE 2000).
This approach requires individuals to have regular dental reviews
or ’checkups’, so that the status of the wisdom teeth can be mon-
itored.
How the intervention might work
In many countries, prophylactic removal of asymptomatic disease-
free wisdom teeth, whether impacted or fully erupted, was long
considered as ’appropriate care’ (Brokaw 1991; Tate 1994). Re-
moval of wisdom teeth that may remain disease-free indefinitely
is costly (Renton 2012) and can produce an unnecessary burden
on healthcare resources (NICE 2000). With the introduction of
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (NICE
2000) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN)
(SIGN 1999) clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) supporting con-
servative management of wisdom teeth, removal of wisdom teeth
has declined in recent years (McArdle 2012). However, concerns
include the possibility that retained wisdom teeth will increase the
risk of pathology to surrounding structures in the long term, and
that their removal at an older age may cause more frequent and
severe complications (McArdle 2012; Renton 2012).
Why it is important to do this review
Cochrane Oral Health undertook an extensive prioritisation exer-
cise in 2014 to identify a core portfolio of titles that were most im-
portant to maintain in The Cochrane Library (Worthington 2015).
This review was identified as a priority title by the oral and max-
illofacial surgery expert panel (Cochrane OHG priority review
portfolio).
Wisdom tooth impaction is a common phenomenon (Carter
2015). Economic and personal costs are associated with removal
of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. Large vari-
ations have been noted in the management of asymptomatic dis-
ease-free impacted wisdom teeth (Knutsson 1992), but clinicians’

their clinical expertise and patient values (Bradley 1996).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for inclusion
for all outcomes, with no restriction on their length of follow-up.
To assess long-term outcomes, we also considered quasi-RCTs and
prospective cohort studies for inclusion only if outcomes were
measured with follow-up of at least five years. We considered these
non-randomised studies (NRSs) for inclusion in this review up-
date,aslong-termoutcomesof retention/removal of asymptomatic
disease-free impacted wisdom teeth are extremely unlikely to be
studied in randomised trials.
Types of participants
Individuals (males and females of all ages) with asymptomatic
disease-free impacted (maxillary or mandibular) wisdom teeth.
An impacted tooth is defined as a tooth that has not erupted
into a normal functional position. The tooth may be partially or
completely covered by soft tissue and/or bone and might be visible,
partially visible or invisible in the mouth.
Types of interventions
Studies comparing removal (or absence) with retention (or pres-
ence) of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth. The control group
(retention or presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wis-
dom teeth) was likely to have continued to receive routine oral
examinations and may have undergone wisdom tooth removal if
symptoms or disease became evident.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcome
Health-related quality of life measures associated with retention
or removal of wisdom teeth (desirable and undesirable effects).
Secondary outcomes
Outcomes associated with retention of wisdom teeth
(undesirable effects)
• Pericoronitis, infection and osteomyelitis
• Periodontitis (increased probing depths or alveolar bone
loss affecting wisdom teeth or adjacent second molars)
• Caries (tooth decay affecting wisdom teeth or adjacent
second molars (distal-cervical))
• Root resorption affecting wisdom teeth or adjacent second
molars
• Dimensional changes in the dental arch (crowding)
• Cyst formation
• Tumour formation
• Inflammation/infection
Outcomes associated with removal of wisdom teeth
(undesirable effects)
• Alveolar osteitis, postoperative infection and osteomyelitis
• Nerve injury (lingual nerve and inferior alveolar nerve)
• Damage to adjacent teeth during surgery
• Bleeding
• Osteonecrosis related to medication/radiotherapy
• Inflammation/infection
Costs
• Days off work/study
• Direct costs associated with retention or removal of wisdom
teeth and treatment of associated symptoms or complications
Search methods for identification of studies
The Information Specialist for Cochrane Oral Health conducted
systematic searches for RCTs and controlled clinical trials. The
subject strategies for databases were modelled on the search strat-
egy designed for MEDLINE Ovid.
Electronic searches
We searched the following databases:
• Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register (searched 24 May
2016) (Appendix 1);
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library (searched
24 May 2016) (Appendix 2);
• MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 May 2016) (Appendix 3);
• Embase Ovid (1980 to 24 May 2016) (Appendix 4).
We placed no restrictions on language or date of publication when
searching electronic databases.

 Searching other resources
We searched the following trials registries:
• US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register
ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/; searched 24 May
2016); (Appendix 5);
• World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch; searched 24 May

We did not perform a separate search for adverse effects of inter-
ventions; we considered these in included studies only.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Eight review authors (Hossein Ghaeminia (HG), John Perry (JP),
Marloes Nienhuijs (MN), Verena Toedling (VT), Marcia Tum-
mers (MT), Theo Hoppenreijs (TH), Wil van der Sanden (WvdS)
and Dirk Mettes (DM)), in duplicate, independently and not
blinded, assessed the titles, keywords, abstracts and/or methods
sections of studies identified by the search strategy. We obtained
relevant articles identified by reference searching as well as full-
text articles selected by the review authors. We read in full the
articles on which review authors disagreed and made the decision
to include or exclude upon discussion. Eligibility criteria were:
• studies comparing the removal (or absence) with retention
(or presence) of (maxillary or mandibular) asymptomatic disease-
free impacted wisdom teeth;
• studies providing data on at least one of the selected
primary or secondary outcomes;
• studies reporting quantitative outcomes; and
• studies with a suitably matched control or comparison
group.
Data extraction and management
Five review authors (HG, JP
, VT, MT and DM) extracted rele-
vant data from the included studies independently and in dupli-
cate. We recorded the following types of data: study design, risk of
bias, studied outcome measures, year of publication, duration of
follow-up, sample size, number and characteristics of participants
in each group and reported results. We assessed the comparabil-
ity of participant characteristics at baseline, how researchers dealt
with confounding, eligibility criteria and the methodology used
in measuring outcomes. We discussed the results until we reached
agreement. In cases of uncertainty, we contacted study authors for
clarification. Should uncertainty persist, we did not use the data.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
All review authors assessed risk of bias of included studies indepen-
dently and in duplicate. We resolved disagreements by discussion.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
We used the tool of The Cochrane Collaboration for assessing
risk of bias along with a ’risk of bias’ table to assess each study,
as outlined in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions version 5.1.0 (Higgins 2011).
We assessed several domains as having ’low risk’ of bias, ’high risk’
of bias or ’unclear risk’ of bias, including:
• random sequence generation (selection bias);
• allocation concealment (selection bias);
• blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias);
• incomplete outcome data (attrition bias);
• selective outcome reporting (reporting bias); and
• other bias.
We further assessed the randomisation procedure, sample size cal-
culation, definitions of eligibility criteria, definitions of success cri-
teria and comparability of control and treatment groups at the start
of the trial. We contacted study authors to seek clarification when
data were uncertain. We reported these assessments for each indi-
vidual study in the ’Risk of bias’ table and under Characteristics
of included studies.
We performed an overall assessment of risk of bias for primary
and secondary outcomes (across domains) across RCTs (Higgins
2011). Within a study, we assigned a summary assessment of low
risk of bias when risk of bias was low for all key domains, unclear
risk of bias when risk of bias was unclear for one or more key
domains and high risk of bias when risk of bias was high for one or
more key domains. Across studies, we rated a summary assessment
as having low risk of bias when we derived most information from
studies at low risk of bias, unclear risk of bias when we obtained
most information from studies at low or unclear risk of bias and
high risk of bias when we gathered most information from studies
with risk of bias high enough to affect interpretation of results.
Non-randomised studies (NRSs)
We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-
Randomized Studies of Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI) when
assessing risk of bias of NRSs (Sterne 2014).
We assessed various domains for each primary or secondary out-
come as ’low risk’ of bias, ‘moderate’ risk of bias, ‘serious’ risk of
bias, ‘critical’ risk of bias or ‘no information’, including:
• bias due to confounding;
• bias in selection of participants into the study;
• bias in measurement of interventions;
• bias due to departure from intended interventions;
• bias due to missing data;
• bias in measurement of outcomes; and
9

 • bias in selection of the reported result.
Control for confounding
We prespecified age, oral and general health status as critically
important confounding domains.
We assessed which of these confounding domains had an impact
on the specific outcome, and whether they were balanced at base-
line or at outcome assessment in studies where participants were
allocated to groups on the basis of their outcome. We also assessed
whether the confounding domains were balanced between groups
or at the design stage through matching when participants were
allocated to groups or through statistical adjustments at the anal-
ysis stage.
Oral health status included the frequency of routine dental check-
ups, the DMFS/T (Decayed Missing Filled Surfaces/Teeth) index,
frequency of oral hygiene and carbohydrate intake from which at
least one of these variables required to be balanced or adjusted for.
No critically important co-interventions were expected to influ-
ence the long-term outcomes.
We undertook risk of bias assessment for each primary and sec-
ondary outcome (across domains) within each non-randomised
study (Sterne 2014). Within a study for each outcome, we as-
signed low risk of bias when risk of bias for all key domains was
low, moderate risk of bias when risk of bias for one or more key
domains was moderate, serious risk of bias when risk of bias for
one or more domains was serious, critical risk of bias when risk of
bias for one or more key domains was critical and ‘no information’
when no clear indication suggested that the outcome was at seri-
ous or critical risk of bias and information was insufficient in one
or more key domains of bias. We considered certain risks of bias
to be additive, so that certain risks of bias in multiple domains led
to an overall judgement of greater risk of bias.
Measures of treatment effect
For RCTs and prospective studies with dichotomous outcomes,
we expressed the estimates of treatment effects of an intervention
as risk ratios (RRs) (outcome present or absent) together with
95%confidence intervals(CIs). Forcontinuousoutcomes, we used
mean differences (MDs) and standard deviations (SDs).
Unit of analysis issues
We assessed the carry-over effect for all split-mouth studies. If a
split-mouth design was deemed inappropriate for investigating the
outcome or outcomes assessed in a particular study, we excluded
the study. If we had included split-mouth studies, we intended to
approximate a paired analysis, as recommended by the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
In the case of an ideal study (i.e. one that reported means and SDs
for both groups, and MDs and SDs/standard errors (SEs) between
two groups), we intended to calculate intragroup correlation co-
efficients (ICCs); if we identified more than one ideal study, we
intendedtocalculate the meanICC, which we wouldhave adopted
in calculating the MD and SD/SE for other, similar split-mouth
studies. If no ideal study was identified, then we assumed that the
ICC was 0.5.
For clustered data, in trials where the unit of analysis was the
tooth, and the number of teeth included in the trial was not more
than twice the number of participants, we treated the data as if
the unit of analysis was the individual. We recognised that the
95% confidence intervals produced would appear narrower (i.e.
the estimate would seem to be more precise) than they should have
been, and we therefore interpreted these accordingly.
Dealing with missing data
We assessed incomplete data during the risk of bias assessment. If
data were absent, we recorded the presence of reporting bias. We
captured missing data on the data extraction form and reported
them in the risk of bias tables. We contacted study authors to try
to acquire missing data for inclusion.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We would have carried out assessment of heterogeneity in quan-
tifying inconsistency across studies by using the I2 statistic, as de-
scribed in Section 9.5.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions.
Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed reporting bias as between-study publication bias or
within-study reporting bias. We assessed within-study reporting
bias by comparing outcomes reported in the published report
against the study protocol, whenever this could be obtained. If
we could not obtain the protocol,we compared outcomes listed
in the methods section with those whose results were reported.
If non-significant results were mentioned but were not reported
adequately, we considered that bias was likely to occur in a meta-
analysis, and we sought further information from the authors of
study reports. Otherwise, we noted this meta-analysis as having
high risk of bias. If information was insufficient to judge the risk of
bias, we noted this meta-analysis as having unclear risk of bias. If
any meta-analysis had included a sufficient number of trials (more
than 10), we would have assessed publication bias according to
the recommendations on testing for funnel plot asymmetry, as de-
scribed in Section 10.4 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). If asymmetry had been
identified, we would have examined possible causes or assessed the
asymmetry by using a table to list the outcomes reported by each
study included in the review, to identify whether any studies did
not report outcomes that had been reported by most studies.

 Data synthesis
For RCTs, we planned to conduct a meta-analysis if sufficient stud-
ies reported the same outcome measure. We planned to combine
risk ratios and calculate 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous
data, and to combine mean differences with 95% confidence inter-
vals for continuous data. We planned to use the fixed-effect model
unless more than three studies were included in each meta-anal-
ysis, or if clinical heterogeneity among studies existed, in which
case we would have used the random-effects model.
Given that data from NRSs are prone to bias and are often het-
erogeneous, we would have carried out separate meta-analyses for
NRSs and presented results according to different study designs
and outcomes. For NRSs, we would not have performed a meta-
analysis in cases of severe methodological and clinical heterogene-
ity, or when we found too few NRSs. In this instance, we would
group the studies by outcome and present results as a narrative
summary in the text, as well as in tables and in the form of a forest
plot without an overall summary statistic.
We would not have included in any analyses data from NRSs with
a critical risk of bias.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Owing to lack of data, we did not perform a subgroup analysis.
If sufficient data had been present, we would have performed a
subgroup analysis for participant age (younger than 18 years, 18
to 25 years, 26 to 30 years, over 30 years).
Sensitivity analysis
For any pooled analyses, we planned to undertake sensitivity anal-
yses to examine the effects of randomisation, allocation conceal-
ment and blinded outcome assessment on overall estimates of ef-
fect.
For meta-analyses of NRSs, we planned to undertake sensitivity
analyses after removing NRSs that had not adequately adjusted
for significant differences in confounding domains.
Presentation of main results
We prepared a ’Summary of findings’ table (SoF) for the primary
and secondary outcomes of this review using GRADE (Grading
of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation
Working Group) profiler software. We assessed the overall quality
of the evidence, using GRADE criteria, as high, moderate, low or
very low (Higgins 2011). GRADE guidance states that RCTs are
considered to present high quality evidence and are downgraded
as necessary on the basis of overall risk of bias of included studies,
directness of the evidence, consistency of the results, precision of
the estimates, risk of publication bias and magnitude of effect.
Sound observational studies are considered to present low quality
evidence but can be upgraded if a large effect size is reported with
no obvious bias to explain that effect.

Results of the search
After performing the search up to 24 May 2016, we retrieved a
total of 3696 references; this resulted in 2472 records after de-
duplication. We found no additional studies or ongoing studies
after searching the trial registers. After screening the titles and
abstracts of these references, we selected 25 articles. Finally, we
excluded 23 articles and included two.

Included studies
The last published version of this review included one RCT
(Harradine 1998), which compared surgical removal with reten-
tion of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth in ado-
lescent participants who had previously undergone orthodontic
treatment. We assessed this study including 164 participants to be
at overall high risk of bias. In the present update, we added one
prospective cohort study and have included a total of two studies
with 1395 participants (493 analysed participants). We have pro-
vided summary details in the Characteristics of included studies
table.
Characteristics of the study settings
We included in this review two studies involving data from
493 analysed participants: one RCT with a parallel-group design
conducted in a dental hospital setting in the United Kingdom
(Harradine 1998), and one prospective cohort study conducted
in the private sector in the USA (Nunn 2013).
Characteristics of participants
The RCT (Harradine 1998) recruited 164 adolescents (55% fe-
male) who had previously undergone orthodontic treatment and
had ’crowded’ wisdom teeth, in which the long axis and the pre-
sumed path of eruption of the wisdom teeth was through the ad-
jacent second molar.
The prospective cohort study (Nunn 2013) recruited 1231 healthy
male volunteers,aged24to84years,whohadboth first and second
molars present in at least one quadrant at baseline and had under-
gone at least one follow-up examination (at three years). Wisdom
teeth at baseline were categorised as absent (previous removal or
agenesis), erupted, ‘soft tissue’ impacted or ‘bony’ impacted.
Characteristics of the interventions
The RCT (Harradine 1998) compared surgical removal with re-
tention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth.
The prospective cohort study (Nunn 2013) compared retention
with absence (previous removal or agenesis) of asymptomatic dis-
ease-free impacted wisdom teeth.

 Characteristics of the outcome measures
The RCT (Harradine 1998) measured the secondary outcome -
dimensional changes in the dental arch - at baseline and five years
later. Study authors assessed three measures of dimensional change
in the dental arch (Little’s irregularity index, intercanine width
and arch length) using digitised study models.
The prospective cohort study (Nunn 2013) measured secondary
outcomes - periodontitis and caries associated with the distal of the
adjacentsecondmolar-duringafollow-upperiodof betweenthree
and over 25 years. Probing depths greater than 4 mm associated
with the distal of the adjacent second molar were assessed clinically,
and a trained, calibrated periodontist assessed alveolar bone loss
and caries associated with the distal of the adjacent second molar,
both clinically and radiographically.
Excluded studies
We have provided summary details in the Characteristics of
excluded studies table. After screening the full text of the identified
NRSs, we excluded 23 studies because:
• three studies had follow-up less than five years (Blakey
2009; Coleman 2011; Huang 2014);
• six studies used an inappropriate study design (Ades 1990;
Lindqvist 1982; Moss 2007; Moss 2007a; Offenbacher 2012;
Rahman 2009; Venta 1993a);
• seven studies did not have a suitably matched control or
comparison group (Dicus 2010; Fisher 2012; Fisher 2013;
Garaas 2012; Golden 2015; Haug 2005; Venta 2015); and
• six studies included an inappropriate study population
(Dicus-Brookes 2013; Moss 2009; Moss 2013; Moss 2013a;
Nemcovsky 1997; Venta 1993).
Risk of bias in included studies
We have reported risk of bias separately for the RCT and the
prospective cohort study. See Characteristics of included studies
and Table 1.
The RCT (Harradine 1998) had adequate sequence generation.
Study authors did not explicitly describe the method of allocation
concealment, and this gave rise to high risk of selection bias. It
was impossible for participants and operators to be blinded to the
intervention, but the outcome assessor was blinded. We assessed
risk of performance and detection bias to be low. Fifty-three per
cent of the original participants (N = 87) were lost to follow-up
at five years. More participants were lost from the retention group
(49/82 = 60%) than from the removal group (38/82 = 46%),
and study authors were unable to contact these participants. study
authors provided no data on the gender balance between groups
of those who completed the study compared with those who did
not. We assessed this trial to be at high risk of attrition bias, which
could have affected overall results. We assessed risk of bias due to
selective reporting as unclear. We could identify no other major
potential sources of bias. We considered this RCT to be at high
risk of bias overall.
We assessed the prospective cohort study (Nunn 2013) to be at
serious risk of bias owing to confounding and missing data. Study
authors adjusted analyses for baseline age, smoking status, educa-
tion and baseline second molar measures but did not measure oral
health status. These factors may contribute to the development
of second molar pathology; therefore this study is at serious risk
of bias owing to confounding. In the first Dental Longitudinal
Study, beginning in 1969, 1231 volunteers were enrolled (Kapur
1972). Eventually only 416 met the inclusion criteria and were
analysed. Data regarding the excluded participants are missing.
Participants with pathology associated with their wisdom teeth are
likely to have had them removed before the study was initiated;
therefore, this study is at serious risk of bias owing to missing data.
We assessed this study to be at low risk of bias in measurement
of interventions and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias due to
selection of participants into the study, departures from intended
interventions and selection of reported results as moderate. We
considered this prospective cohort study overall to be at serious
risk of bias for all assessed outcomes. See Table 1.

Primary outcome - health-related quality of life
Neither of the two included studies investigated health-related
quality of life measures associated with retention or removal of
asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth.
Secondary outcomes - outcomes associated with
retention of wisdom teeth (undesirable effects)
Periodontitis (increased probing depths or alveolar bone loss
affecting wisdom teeth or adjacent second molars)
The prospective cohort study (Nunn 2013) with 416 analysed par-
ticipants (with 804 wisdom teeth) reported relative risks for prob-
ing depths greater than 4 mm and alveolar bone loss associated
with the distal of the adjacent second molar in the absence com-
pared with the presence of asymptomatic disease-free impacted
wisdom teeth. ’Soft tissue’ and ’bony’ impactions were calculated
at the participant level.
In the absence of wisdom teeth, the risk of probing depths greater
than 4 mm associated with the distal of the adjacent second molar
was significantly less than if soft tissue impacted wisdom teeth
were present (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.34) (very low quality
evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in the
risk of probing depths greater than 4 mm associated with the distal
13

 of the adjacent second molar in the absence compared with the
presence of bony impacted wisdom teeth (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.37
to 1.04) (very low quality evidence).
In the absence of wisdom teeth, the risk of alveolar bone loss as-
sociated with the distal of the adjacent second molar was signifi-
cantly less than if soft tissue (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.22) or
bony impacted wisdom teeth (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.54)
were present (very low quality evidence).
Caries (tooth decay affecting wisdom teeth or adjacent
second molars (distal-cervical))
The prospective cohort study (Nunn 2013) with 416 analysed
participants (with 804 wisdom teeth) reported relative risks for
caries associated with the distal of the adjacent second molar in
the absence compared with retention of asymptomatic disease-free
impacted wisdom teeth. ’Soft tissue’ and ’bony’ impactions were
calculated at the participant level.
There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence
of distal caries associated with the adjacent second molar in the
absence compared with the presence of bony impacted wisdom
teeth (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.82) and soft tissue impacted
wisdom teeth (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.17 to 9.10) (very low quality
evidence).
Dimensional changes in the dental arch (crowding)
The RCT (Harradine 1998) with 77 analysed participants re-
ported mean differences with 95% confidence intervals for di-
mensional changes in the dental arch for surgical removal com-
pared with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wis-
dom teeth. There were no statistically significant differences be-
tween groups for the outcomes of Little’s irregularity index (MD
-0.3 mm, 95% CI -1.3 to 0.7) and intercanine width (MD -0.01
mm, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.35) (low quality evidence). There was
a small but statistically significant difference between groups in
arch length (MD -1.03 mm, 95% CI -0.56 to -1.50, P value =
0.0001), but this difference is unlikely to be clinically significant
(low quality evidence). These findings appear to be inconsistent
with each other but may be explained, as the study authors’ note,
by persistent residual premolar extraction space in some partici-
pants at study entry.
Other outcomes associated with retention
No included studies reported pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst
formation, tumour formation or inflammation/infection.
Outcomes associated with removal of wisdom teeth
(undesirable effects)
No included studies measured outcomes or adverse events asso-
ciated with removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wis-
dom teeth (alveolar osteitis/postoperative infection, nerve injury,
damage to adjacent teeth during surgery, bleeding, osteonecrosis
related to medication/radiotherapy, inflammation/infection).
Costs
The included studies did not measure days off work/study or direct
costs associated with retention or removal of wisdom teeth and
treatment of associated symptoms or complications.

Summary of main results
No eligible studies in this review reported the effects of removal
compared with retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted
wisdom teeth for the primary outcome measure: health-related
quality of life.
Studies have provided only low or very low quality evidence of the
effects of removal compared with retention of asymptomatic dis-
ease-free impactedwisdomteeth foralimitednumberof secondary
outcome measures. Very low quality evidence from one prospec-
tive cohort study suggests that the presence of asymptomatic dis-
ease-free impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased
risk of periodontitis associated with the adjacent second molar in
the long term. The same study provided no evidence to suggest
that the presence of impacted wisdom teeth changes the risk of
caries affecting the adjacent second molar. Low quality evidence
from a single randomised controlled trial (RCT) included in this
review found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic
disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has a clinically significant ef-
fect on dimensional changes in the dental arch.
No included studies have reported other outcomes or adverse
events associated with removal (alveolar osteitis/postoperative in-
fection, nerve injury, damage to adjacent teeth during surgery,
bleeding, osteonecrosis related to medication/radiotherapy, in-
flammation/infection) or retention (pericoronitis, root resorption,
cyst formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection) of
asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Substantial differences are evident between participants in the two

Surgical removal versus retention for the management of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth (Review)

 The included RCT focused only on adolescent patients who had
completed orthodontic treatment. Loss to follow-up was a ma-
jor obstacle in obtaining data about the effects of extraction of
asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, as participants
are likely to be recruited towards the end of their high school years
and are difficult to follow up as they move to higher education,
go travelling or change locations when seeking employment.
The prospective cohort study included only male participants aged
24 to 84 years from a single geographic area who were self selected
volunteers. Participants enrolled in the study who returned for fol-
low-up are likely to be more health aware than their age-matched
peers in the community and to practise better health behaviours.
This would suggest that participants in this study were more mo-
tivated than the overall population. Retained wisdom teeth in this
group of participants were associated with increased risk of peri-
odontal disease affecting the adjacent second molar. Risk of dam-
age to the second molar might be even greater in populations with
poor oral health. If wisdom teeth or adjacent second molars need
to be removed at an older age owing to disease, the personal and
financial costs may be greater than at a young age. However, in-
cluded studies have provided no information on quality of life
measures and costs.
Included studies have provided no information regarding other
adverse effects of removal (alveolar osteitis/postoperative infec-
tion, nerve injury, damage to adjacent teeth during surgery, bleed-
ing, osteonecrosis related to medication/radiotherapy, inflamma-
tion/infection) or retention (pericoronitis, root resorption, cyst
formation, tumour formation, inflammation/infection) of asymp-
tomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth.
We chose the primary outcome of health-related quality of life to
capture the benefits and harms associated with removal and re-
tention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. We
chose this outcome measure because of the difficulties of com-
paring various outcomes (e.g. rate of complications after surgi-
cal removal, incidence of pathological change in cases of reten-
tion, rate of complications due to delayed surgical removal) (Song
2000). Unfortunately, the included studies did not assess this pri-
mary outcome. The Oral Health Impact Profile is a valid and reli-
able measure of oral health-related quality of life in general dental
practice and is responsive to impacted third molar clinical change
(Fernandes 2006). It is suitable for measuring the effects of re-
moval or retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom
teeth on oral health-related quality of life in future studies.
Quality of the evidence
The single RCT included in this review provided low quality ev-
idence of the effects of surgical removal of asymptomatic disease-
free impacted wisdom teeth on dimensional changes in the dental
arch at five years’ follow-up. We considered this trial to be at high
risk of bias overall owing to limitations of allocation concealment
and incomplete outcome data sufficient to lower confidence in the
estimate of effect. In addition, the small number of participants
and the high rate of loss of participants to follow-up led to impre-
cision in the estimate of effect.
As RCTs investigating longer-term and rare effects of removal or
retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth
are unlikely to be feasible, we considered non-randomised studies
(NRSs) for inclusion in this review update. A high quality prospec-
tive cohort study might be a more suitable design for evaluating
the outcomes of retained wisdom teeth. However, NRSs are likely
to be at higher risk of bias compared with RCTs. With the intro-
duction of the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for NRSs (ACROBAT-
NRSI, Sterne 2014), it is possible to assess the risk of bias in NRSs
more systematically. (The tool was updated in 2016 and is now
called ROBINS-I).
We assessed the included prospective cohort study, Nunn 2013,
to be at serious risk of bias because of confounding. Study au-
thors adjusted the analyses for baseline age, smoking status, edu-
cation and baseline second molar measures but did not measure
oral health status. Oral health status may contribute to the devel-
opment of pathology associated with wisdom teeth and adjacent
second molars. A recent study that measured the frequency of den-
tal checkups reported no effects of wisdom tooth removal on the
incidence of pathology associated with the second molar (Huang
2014). However, this study provided only two years of follow-up
and was not eligible for inclusion in this review. As pathology may
develop in a wisdom tooth or in the adjacent second molar over
the whole of a person’s lifetime, studies with long-term follow-up
are needed.
The quality of evidence available from the two studies included
in this review is of low to very low quality, so we cannot rely on
these findings to support clinical practice.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Despite the lack of evidence, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs)
on the management of impacted wisdom teeth have been avail-
able for 15 years. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network
(SIGN 1999) published a CPG for the management of unerupted
and impacted wisdom teeth in 1999, and the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE 2000) in the UK published
a CPG for removal of wisdom teeth in 2000. Both concluded that
in light of the costs and risks associated with removal, no valid
evidence supports the prophylactic removal of asymptomatic dis-
ease-free wisdom teeth. In 2000, the number of patients requiring
surgical removal of wisdom teeth in secondary care dropped by
30% (McArdle 2012). However, since 2003, an increase in the
removal of wisdom teeth has been registered, with equal numbers
of patients requiring wisdom tooth removal in 2000 and 2010.
In addition, the mean age of patients requiring removal of wis-
dom teeth has increased from 25 years before the introduction of
the NICE CPD to 32 years in 2010 (McArdle 2012). The review
15

 authors suggest that implementation of CPGs has not resulted in
a reduction in the number of wisdom teeth removed but has in-
creased the number of wisdom teeth requiring removal at an older
age owing to caries (McArdle 2012; Renton 2012). However, risk
of bias is high in all domains in this study owing to the use of
hospital coding systems. The prospective cohort study included
in this review (Nunn 2013) found increased risk of distal caries
for second molars adjacent to fully erupted wisdom teeth, but not
for impacted wisdom teeth.
In the late 1990s, the American Association of Oral and Maxillofa-
cial Surgeons acknowledged the absence of evidence to guide clini-
cal decision making for the management of asymptomatic disease-
free impacted wisdom teeth, and allocated a significant amount
of money for a multi-centre study (Kandasamy 2009). More than
70 papers have been published as a result of this study, includ-
ing a large cohort study that documents the incidence of adverse
effects following more than 8000 third molar extractions in pa-
tients 25 years of age or older (Haug 2005). Large studies have
documented the incidence of complications associated with re-
tention of asymptomatic disease-free wisdom teeth. Most of these
studies did not focus on asymptomatic disease-free impacted wis-
dom teeth but investigated the occurrence of pathology associated
with ‘visible teeth’. This resulted in serious risk of selection bias
in all of these studies; therefore we did not include them in this
review. The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Sur-
geons “leans more towards the removal of asymptomatic disease-
free third molars on the basis they are associated with increased
periodontal probing depths and are therefore a potential source
of chronic inflammation” (Kandasamy 2009). However, it should
be questioned whether only pocket depths are indicative of peri-
odontal pathology. A 4-mm pocket depth in the second molar may
be influenced by the eruption status of the third molar, without
inflammation or other pathology. The prospective cohort study
included in this review (Nunn 2013) found increased risk of sec-
ond molar periodontal pathology adjacent to impacted third mo-
lars when distal alveolar bone loss was assessed radiographically in
addition to distal probing depths.
Disagreement regarding the removal of asymptomatic disease-free
impacted wisdom teeth is ongoing (Huang 2014), and the key
question remains: why should impacted wisdom teeth be removed
in the absence of symptoms or pathological conditions? Unfortu-
nately, reliable estimates of the onset of pathology related to re-
tained impacted wisdom teeth are unavailable (Venta 2004), in
large part because of the widespread practice of routine removal
over past decades. Recently, cross-sectional studies performed in
elderly individuals in the USA (Fisher 2010) and Finland (Venta
2015) have reported that most wisdom teeth are removed over a
lifetime, and that up to 80% of surviving wisdom teeth have asso-
ciated pathology such as caries or periodontitis in patients over the
age of 74 years. The incidence of severe pathology associated with
wisdom teeth, such as cysts and tumours, is low (< 2%). Evidence
from these cross-sectional studies is very unreliable, and studies as-
sessing the outcomes of retained wisdom teeth are rare because of
problems associated with a complex long-term prospective study
design (Van der Sanden 2002). Studies have shown that distally
impacted lower wisdom teeth and partially erupted wisdom teeth
are more likely to become symptomatic (Venta 1993a). Actuar-
ial lifetime tables have shed some light on the natural history of
asymptomatic impacted lower wisdom teeth, but longer follow-
up periods are required (Fernandes 2010).
The decisionaboutwhethertorecommendremoval orretention of
asymptomatic disease-free wisdom teeth may be influenced by cost
(whether publicly funded, covered through insurance or borne by
the patient) and by professional liability. Patient values and pref-
erences should play a more prominent role in deciding whether
asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth should be re-
moved.

Implications for practice
Insufficient evidence is available to support the surgical removal
or retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth.
Although some evidence suggests that retaining asymptomatic dis-
ease-free impacted wisdom teeth may increase the risk of peri-
odontitis associated with adjacent second molars in the long term,
this evidence is of very low quality. In light of the lack of avail-
able evidence, patient values should be considered and clinical ex-
pertise used to guide shared decision making with patients who
have asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth. If the de-
cision is made to retain asymptomatic disease-free impacted wis-
dom teeth, clinical assessment at regular intervals to prevent un-
desirable outcomes is advisable.
Implications for research
Long-term, well-designed prospective studies comparing removal
or retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth
are urgently needed. Well-designed RCTs investigating the long-
term and rare effects of retention and removal of asymptomatic
disease-free impacted wisdom teeth, in a representative group of
individuals, are unlikely to be feasible. If randomisation is not
possible, studies should register important baseline data such as
age and general and oral health status, including the frequency
of dental checkups, the DMFS/T (Decayed Missing Filled Sur-
faces/Teeth) index or frequency of oral hygiene. These confound-
ing domains should be balanced at baseline or adjusted for with
appropriate analyses. A crucial and easily comparable outcome is
oral health-related quality of life. However, further development
and validation of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)
are needed in the context of managing asymptomatic disease-free
impacted wisdom teeth. The secondary outcomes described in this
16

 review are also of great importance for decision making in the
management of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth
and should be measured in future studies. Because pathology may
develop in a wisdom tooth or in the adjacent second molar over
the whole of a patient’s lifetime, studies with long-term follow-up
(at least five years) are needed. This is very challenging, as young
participants are difficult to contact when they move to higher ed-
ucation, travel or change locations while seeking employment.

• Little’s irregularity index (LII). Mean differences ± SD for change
• Intercanine width (ICW). Mean differences ± SD for change
• Arch length (AL). Mean differences ± SD for change
Length of follow-up: 5 years, mean length of follow-up was 66 ± 12.6 months
For the upper arch, investigators found no statistical differences between the 2 groups for the 3
outcome variables
Notes
Sample size calculation: not described
Analysis (linear modelling) of measurements of casts demonstrated no systematic differences be-
tween individuals who completed the trial and those lost to follow-up

Incomplete outcome data
High risk
Quote: “...no systematic differences existed be-
tween those patients who entered the trial and

complete”
Comment: 53% attrition overall, evaluation of
44 and 33 participants in extraction and non-
extraction groups (54% and 40%, respectively)
and reasons for non-completion are given as
“loss of contact with occupiers of their previous
address”. No data are available on the gender
balance of those who completed compared with
those who did not, for each treatment group.
Trial authors report only the results of modelling
of 44 non-responders. This trial would seem to
be at high risk of attrition bias
Selective reporting
Unclear risk
Comment: The only outcomes reported in the
paperare orthodonticindices. Noadverse effects
of treatments or symptoms are reported

Methods
Prospective cohort study, part of Longitudinal Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study, beginning in 1961 (Kapur
1972)
Location: United States (greater Boston area)
Research aim: to examine the association of third molar status with prevalent and incident caries and periodontal
outcomes in adjacent second molars
Participants
Healthy male patients who had both first and second molars present in at least 1 quadrant at baseline and had at least
1 follow-up. Examinations were performed every 3 years with duration to > 25 years
Number of participants: 416 (804 third molars) from 1231 enrolled patients met the inclusion criteria
Age of entry to the trial (mean ± standard deviation (SD)): 45.8 years 9 months ± 7.4 years
Baseline characteristics: Analyses were adjusted for baseline age, smoking status, education and baseline second molar
measures
Interventions
Retention of asymptomatic wisdom teeth compared with absence of wisdom teeth (previous extraction or agenesis
at baseline)

Outcomes
Second molar pathology
• Caries
• Distal probing depth > 4 mm
• Distal alveolar bone loss
These outcomes were measured every 3 years
Clinical outcomes (caries and probing depths > 4 mm) measured by a trained, calibrated periodontist. Radiological
outcome (alveolar bone loss and caries) measured by board-certified oral and maxillofacial surgeon and a board-
certified oral and maxillofacial radiologist. Alveolar bone loss was measured with a Schei ruler

Confounding
Serious risk
Analyses were adjusted for baseline age, smoking status, education
and baseline second molar measures. However, oral health status
such as oral hygiene and frequency of dental checkups was not
measured. These factors may contribute to the development of
second molar pathology. However, “participants enrolled in the
study returning for follow-ups are likely to be more health aware
than their age-matched peers in the community and practice better
health behaviors”. This would suggest more motivated participants
in this study compared with the overall population. Therefore the
predicted direction of bias due to oral health status confounding
favours retention (presence), and it is likely that the effect estimate
would be even higher if was adjusted
Selection of participants into the study
Moderate risk
Only male volunteers were included. However, gender is not ex-
pected to contribute to the development of second molar pathol-
ogy. Some participants lost third molars before the start of follow-
up - in the target randomised trial for this study, participants would
be followed from the time the third molars were removed. As third
molars were removed before the start of follow-up, a potentially
important amount of follow-up time is missing
Measurement of interventions
Low risk
Intervention status was well defined and was based solely on infor-
mation collected at the time of intervention
Departure from intended interventions
Moderate risk
Switching of participants from retention to removal was likely, but
this switching occurs as part of the natural course of events
Missing data
Serious risk
1231 volunteers enrolled in the Dental Longitudinal Study begin-
ning in 1969 (Kapur et al. 1972), but only 416 analysed. This
first study could not be obtained. Those with problems from third
molars were likely to have them removed before the study was ini-
tiated; therefore, this study has serious risk of bias due to missing
data
Measurement of outcomes
Moderate risk
Caries, probing depths and alveolar bone loss were assessed clin-
ically and on radiographs adequately. Blinding was not possible,
but we do not expect that non-blinding would have influenced the
results

Selection of reported results
Moderate risk
There is no evidence to suggest that multiple outcome measure-
ments and/or multiple analyses were conducted for each outcome.
Only participants with both first and second molars in at least 1
quadrant were included in the study, rather than the whole subset
of 1231 volunteers in the Dental Longitudinal Study. No a priori
measurement or analysis plan was included

We added 1 new longitudinal study in this review update
Conclusions have changed. In the original review, we con-
cludedthat“watchful monitoringof asymptomaticimpacted

the available evidence is very low quality and there are in-
sufficient data on which to base clinical decisions about the

9 June 2015
New search has been performed
Search strategy changed: trials investigating short- and long-
term risks and complications of retention/removal of asymp-
tomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth are unlikely to
be feasible. We included non-randomised studies (NRSs) in
this review update if they assessed long-term outcomes, i.e.
over 5 years. The introduction of a new Cochrane Risk of
Bias Tool for NRSs means we can now assess the risk of bias
in NRSs more systematically

• Title - we added ’disease-free’.
• Types of participants. In the original protocol, the intention was to include only studies on adult participants (over 17 years of
age). However, review authors identified no suitable trials. It was therefore decided to expand the remit to include studies on
adolescent participants. The change in the age of participants is not expected to have any clinical implications because little clinical
difference has been noted between adolescents (14 to 17 years of age) and young adults (18 to 25 years of age).
• Types of studies. Long-term outcomes of retention/removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth are extremely
unlikely to be studied in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Therefore, we considered non-randomised studies (NRSs) for inclusion
in this review update, if outcomes were measured with follow-up of at least five years.
• Types of interventions. Presence and absence of wisdom teeth were added to investigate the long-term outcomes of retention or
removal of wisdom teeth. This enabled us to study the effects of absence or presence of wisdom teeth on adjacent structures such as
the second molar.
• Types of outcomes. More than 15 years after the initial protocol, many publications have addressed periodontitis as a possible
undesirable effect of retention of wisdom teeth. Furthermore, attention to medication/radiotherapy-related osteonecrosis of the jaw
associated with surgical extractions is increasing. Therefore, we added these secondary outcomes to the methods. We expanded other
outcomes.
• Because we considered NRSs for inclusion in the review update, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-
Randomized Studies of Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI) for the risk of bias assessment of NRSs (Sterne 2014).
• As we were including NRSs, we executed the search without an RCT study design filter, and the results of the full search are
reported in Figure 1.
