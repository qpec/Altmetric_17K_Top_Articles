IMPORTANCE Despite 3 decades of study, there remains ongoing debate regarding whether
vasectomy is associated with prostate cancer.
OBJECTIVE To determine if vasectomy is associated with prostate cancer.
DATA SOURCES The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were
searched for studies indexed from database inception to March 21, 2017, without language
restriction.
STUDY SELECTION Cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies reporting relative effect
estimates for the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators performed study selection
independently. Data were pooled separately by study design type using random-effects
models. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess risk of bias.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was any diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Secondary outcomes were high-grade, advanced, and fatal prostate cancer.
RESULTS Fifty-three studies (16 cohort studies including 2 563 519 participants, 33
case-control studies including 44 536 participants, and 4 cross-sectional studies including
12 098 221 participants) were included. Of these, 7 cohort studies (44%), 26 case-control
studies (79%), and all 4 cross-sectional studies were deemed to have a moderate to high risk
of bias. Among studies deemed to have a low risk of bias, a weak association was found
among cohort studies (7 studies; adjusted rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09; P < .001;
I2 = 9%) and a similar but nonsignificant association was found among case-control studies
(6 studies; adjusted odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.88-1.29; P = .54; I2 = 37%). Effect estimates
were further from the null when studies with a moderate to high risk of bias were included.
Associations between vasectomy and high-grade prostate cancer (6 studies; adjusted rate
ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.89-1.21; P = .67; I2 = 55%), advanced prostate cancer (6 studies;
adjusted rate ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98-1.20; P = .11; I2 = 18%), and fatal prostate cancer (5
studies; adjusted rate ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92-1.14; P = .68; I2 = 26%) were not significant (all
cohort studies). Based on these data, a 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.2%) absolute increase in
lifetime risk of prostate cancer associated with vasectomy and a population-attributable
fraction of 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%) were calculated.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This review found no association between vasectomy and
high-grade, advanced-stage, or fatal prostate cancer. There was a weak association between
vasectomy and any prostate cancer that was closer to the null with increasingly robust study
design. This association is unlikely to be causal and should not preclude the use of vasectomy
as a long-term contraceptive option.

 V
asectomy is a highly efficacious long-term contracep-
tive method that involves a simple outpatient proce-
dure under local anesthetic. It is less expensive and has
a lower risk of complications compared with tubal ligation,
the analogous female surgical sterilization procedure.1,2
Although 43 million women worldwide rely on their part-
ner’
s vasectomy for contraception,3,4 vasectomy is still con-
sidered to be underused in the United States, with only 8% to
12% of couples using vasectomy for birth control.4-6
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several reports began to
emergeofanepidemiologicassociationbetweenvasectomyand
the risk of prostate cancer.7-11 This finding ignited a contro-
versycapturedinnumerouseditorials,reviews,andoriginalre-
search articles supporting or refuting the association. Several
meta-analysesofthisassociationhavebeenperformed,butthey
did not bring closure to the debate. One older meta-analysis
pooling5cohortstudiesand17case-controlstudiesfoundasig-
nificant association between vasectomy and prostate cancer.12
Meanwhile,2morerecentmeta-analysesofcohortstudiesfound
no statistically significant association, although the CIs of
pooled effect estimates precluded definitive conclusions.13-15
Moreover, none of these meta-analyses included a sufficient
number of studies with a low risk of bias to analyze them as a
separatesubset,norwerethemeta-analysesabletoevaluatethe
association between vasectomy and risk of high-grade,
advanced-stage, and fatal prostate cancer.
Recently, several large, high-quality analyses demonstrat-
ing either an association16,17 or no association18-20 between va-
sectomy and prostate cancer have reignited the controversy.
With the aim of shedding some light onto a debate that is 3 de-
cades old, we conducted a systematic review of the literature
and performed a meta-analysis, with particular attention to
study quality, to determine if there is an association between
vasectomy and any prostate cancer, high-risk prostate can-
cer, advanced prostate cancer, and lethal prostate cancer.
Methods
Research Question
Is there an association between vasectomy and a subsequent
diagnosis of prostate cancer? More specifically, is vasectomy
associated with a diagnosis of any prostate cancer, high-risk
prostate cancer, advanced prostate cancer, and/or fatal pros-
tatecancer?TheMayoClinicInstitutionalReviewBoardwaived
the need for review of this study.
Types of Studies
We included cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional stud-
ies.Caseserieslackingcomparatorgroupswereexcluded.Other
publications, including editorials, commentaries, review ar-
ticles, and those not subject to peer review (ie, reports of data
from Vital Statistics and dissertations or theses), were ex-
cluded.Whentherewasmorethan1publicationresultingfrom
the same patient cohort, we selected a single representative
study, with a preference for more contemporary publications
and publications with a larger number of patients and more
reliable methods of exposure and outcome ascertainment.
Types of Participants and Exposure

Vasectomyexposurewasdeterminedbyadministrativeandclini-
cal health records, survey results, and/or patient recall.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was any subsequent diagnosis of pros-
tate cancer. Secondary outcomes included the diagnoses of
high-grade prostate cancer (based on individual study defini-
tion, typically Gleason score ≥8), advanced prostate cancer
(based on individual study definition, typically T3/4, N+, or
M+), and fatal prostate cancer.

Key Points
Question Is there an association between vasectomy and
prostate cancer, high-grade prostate cancer, advanced prostate
cancer, and/or fatal prostate cancer?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis including 53
studies,therewasaweak,clinicallyinsignificantassociationbetween
vasectomy and prostate cancer. No association was found between
vasectomy and risk of high-grade, advanced, or fatal prostate cancer.
Meaning At most, there is a trivial association between
vasectomy and prostate cancer that is unlikely to be causal;
therefore, concerns about prostate cancer should not preclude the
use of vasectomy as an option for long-term contraception.

 ciationbetweenvasectomyandanyprostatecanceroutcome,or
provided sufficient data for this estimate to be calculated. One
ofus(B.B.)performedalldataabstraction,includingevaluation
of study characteristics, risk of bias, and outcome measures,
with independent verification performed by another one of us
(C.J.D.W.).
Assessment of Risk of Bias
We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessment of risk of
bias. This scale assesses risk of bias in the following 3
domains23: selection of the study groups, comparability of
groups, and ascertainment of exposure and outcome.24 Stud-
ies with scores of less than 4 were considered to have a high
risk of bias, those with scores of 4 to 6 an intermediate risk of
bias, and those with scores of 7 or more a low risk of bias.
Measures of Treatment Effect
Measures of treatment effect varied among study designs.
Among cross-sectional and case-control studies, we pooled
odds ratios (ORs). In each case, we examined unadjusted and
adjusted measures of effect separately. Among cohort stud-
ies, we first pooled ratio measures of effect (including hazard
ratios [HRs], rate ratios [RRs], and ORs).25,26 Subsequently,
we performed subgroup analysis using only studies that
reported time-to-event data (HRs).
Assessment of Heterogeneity
We identified heterogeneity using the Q test, estimated it using
the DerSimonian-Laird method, and quantified it using I2
values.27Furthermore,weusedrandom-effectsmodelsforeach
of our analyses, given the identified clinical heterogeneity.
Assessment of Reporting Bias
We assessed publication bias for outcomes with more than 10
included studies using funnel plots.
Data Synthesis
Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager, version
5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collabora-
tion). We used the inverse variance technique for pooling of
measures of effect. Owing to the clinical heterogeneity inher-
ent in our data, random-effects models were used for all meta-
analyses. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine
if excluding any individual study altered our results.
Subgroup and Exploratory Analyses
Weperformedapriorisubgroupanalyses.First,asalreadymen-
tioned, we examined cohort studies that used a time-to-
event analysis separately. Second, we examined studies iden-
tified as having a low risk of bias. Third, we evaluated the
studies that provided effect estimates stratified by time since
vasectomy and age at which vasectomy was performed.
We also performed post hoc subgroup analyses. First, we
examined cohort studies in which all patients were following
aprostate-specificantigen(PSA)screeningprotocolorinwhich
PSA screening was accounted for in multivariable models.
Second, we examined cohort studies in which PSA screening
was not performed or was very uncommon.
Finally, to facilitate interpretation of relative effect esti-
mates for clinicians and policymakers, the pooled effect
estimate from the meta-analysis was used to estimate the
absolute risk increase, the number needed to harm, and the
population attributable fraction. For these calculations, the
lifetime risk of prostate cancer was considered to be 12.9%28
and the probability of undergoing vasectomy was 10%.4,5
Results and Evidence Synthesis
Ourliteraturesearchidentified433uniquereferences(Figure1).
After a full-text review of 115 manuscripts, 53 were selected
for inclusion. The reasons for exclusion are summarized in
Figure 1 and eAppendix 2 in the Supplement.
Description of Studies
Among the 53 included studies, 16 were cohort studies
(2 563 519 participants),11,16-20,29-38 33 were case-control
studies (44 536 participants),8,9,39-68 and 4 were cross-
sectional studies (12 098 221 participants).69-72 Although
most studies were population- or registry-based analyses,
several articles presented single- or multiple-institution
analyses (Table).8,9,11,16-20,29-73 Duration of follow-up varied
widely among cohort studies, with a minimum of 1.8 years
and a maximum of 24 years. In general, the patients with
and the patients without a history of vasectomy were similar
in age among cohort studies. Among the case-control stud-
ies, the patients with and the patients without a diagnosis of
cancer were generally similar in age, although, in some
analyses, patients who received a diagnosis of prostate can-
cer were older.39,40 The risk-adjustment approach varied
across studies (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Assessment of Risk of Bias
Assessment of risk of bias was performed according to study
methods(eTable2intheSupplement).Nineofthecohortstud-
ies(56%)wereassessedashavingalowriskofbias.16-20,29,32,34,38
Exposure was ascertained by self-report or questionnaire
results in several of these studies. Eight of 16 cohort studies
(50%) accounted for PSA testing and/or health-seeking
behavior.16-19,32,33,37,38 Most case-control studies (26 [79%])
were considered to have a moderate to high risk of
bias.8,9,39,40,42,43,45-48,51,52,54-56,58-68 Although cases were typi-
cally well defined, the use of hospital-based instead of
community-based controls was considered a potential source
of bias among many case-control studies. Ascertainment of
exposure was also a common source of bias among case-
control studies. All 4 cross-sectional studies were thought to
have a moderate to high risk of bias.69-72
All Prostate Cancer
To assess the association between vasectomy and any diag-
nosis of prostate cancer, we first pooled results from cohort
studies (Figure 2). Among the 13 of 16 cohort studies report-
ing on 2 563 519 patients that used adjusted measures of
effect,11,16-20,29,31-33,35-37 we found a small but statistically sig-
nificantincreasedriskofanydiagnosisofprostatecanceramong

 patients with a history of vasectomy (adjusted RR, 1.08; 95%
CI, 1.02-1.14; P = .006; I2 = 63%) (Figure 2A). A similar out-
come was observed among cohort studies using a time-to-
event analysis (9 studies; adjusted HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.15;
P = .004; I2 = 70%) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).11,16-20,31,32,35
The effect estimate among studies deemed at low risk of bias
remained statistically significant but was closer to the null (7
studies; adjusted RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09; P < .001;
I2 = 9%) (Figure 2B).16-20,29,32 Results were not meaningfully
different when abstracts were excluded (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Among cohort studies in which all patients explicitly un-
derwent PSA screening (as in the screening arm of the PLCO
[Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian] Cancer Screening
trial)17 or in which PSA screening was accounted for in multi-
variable models, the association between vasectomy and pros-
tate cancer was consistent with our overall findings (6 stud-
ies; adjusted RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09; P < .001; I2 = 16%)
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement).16,17,19,32,33,37 Furthermore,
among studies that reported on populations in which PSA
screening was not performed or very uncommonly per-
formed, we observed no association between vasectomy and
prostate cancer, although this finding was limited by few stud-
ies and significant heterogeneity (2 studies; adjusted RR, 1.26;
95% CI, 0.51-3.07; P = .62; I2 = 84%).10,36
We then separately assessed the association between
vasectomy and any diagnosis of prostate cancer among case-
control studies (Figure 3). Meta-analysis of studies reporting
adjusted ORs demonstrated a statistically significant asso-
ciation between vasectomy and prostate cancer (17 studies;
adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53; P < .001; I2 = 66%)
(Figure 3A).9,39-44,48,49,51,53,56-58,61,63,73 When we restricted
analysis to 6 studies deemed to have low risk of bias, there
was no significant association (adjusted OR, 1.06; 95% CI,
0.88-1.29; P = .54; I2 = 37%) (Figure 3B).41,44,49,53,57,73
There were no cross-sectional studies reporting adjusted
measures of effect. Analyses of cohort, case-control, and
cross-sectional studies reporting unadjusted measures of
effect were performed for completeness and are summarized
in eAppendix 3 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. These
results did not meaningfully alter conclusions. In the sensi-
tivity analysis, excluding any individual study did not alter
the results in each of the respective meta-analyses.
Secondary Outcomes
Among cohort studies, there was no statistically significant
association noted between vasectomy and the diagnosis of
high-grade prostate cancer (6 studies; adjusted HR, 1.03;
95% CI, 0.89-1.21; P = .67; I2 = 55%),16,18-20,31,38 advanced
prostate cancer (6 studies; adjusted HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98-
1.20; P = .11; I2 = 18%),16,18-20,31,38 or fatal prostate cancer (5
studies; adjusted HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92-1.14; P = .68; I2 = 26%)
(Figure 4).16,18-20,38
Five case-control studies assessed the association
between vasectomy and prostate cancer, stratified by
stage.41-44,46 The varied definitions of advanced prostate can-
cer in these studies precluded meta-analysis of these results.
Qualitatively, there was a greater association between vasec-
tomy and low-risk prostate cancer than between vasectomy
and advanced disease among these studies. Meanwhile, a
single case-control study assessed the association between
vasectomy and fatal prostate cancer and found no

Duration of Exposure and Age at Vasectomy
Six cohort studies,11,16,20,29-31 15 case-control stud-
ies,8,9,40-44,46-48,50-52,73 and 1 cross-sectional study70
reported on the association of time since vasectomy with the
development of prostate cancer (eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment). Of these, 1 cohort study11 and 6 case-control
studies8,9,40,46-48 suggested a stronger association between
vasectomy and prostate cancer with increasing time since
vasectomy, although in several instances the CIs of the indi-
vidual strata included unity and formal tests for trend were
only performed in 3 studies.8,9,48 The remainder of these
studies did not find any such biological gradient associated
with time since vasectomy.16,20,29-31,41-44,49-52,70,73

intervals used by the individual studies.

 measures of effect and cohort studies reporting adjusted
measures of effect (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). There was
potential publication bias among cohort studies, with a
relative paucity of small studies demonstrating a large
increased risk, and among case-control studies reporting
adjusted measures of effect, with a relative paucity of small
studies demonstrating no increased risk.
Exploratory Estimations
Using the pooled effect estimate from the meta-analysis of
cohort studies with a low risk of bias, we found that the
absolute increase in lifetime risk of prostate cancer is esti-
mated to be 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.2%), that the number
needed to harm (assuming a causal association, the number
of men who would need to undergo vasectomy to result in 1
incident case of prostate cancer) is estimated to be 156, and
that the population attributable fraction (assuming a causal
association, the proportion the lifetime risk of prostate can-
cer would be reduced if no vasectomies were performed) is
estimated to be 0.5% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.9%) (eAppendix 4 in
the Supplement).
Discussion
To date, the potential for bias in the studies on the associa-
tion between vasectomy and prostate cancer has been a ma-
jor focus of criticism of this body of literature. Accordingly, we
found that the effect estimates of the association between va-
sectomy and prostate cancer were increasingly closer to the
null when examining studies with increasingly robust study
designandstudyquality.Inourmeta-analysisofcohortstudies

 with a low risk of bias, we found a 5% increase in the risk of
incident prostate cancer with vasectomy. This result was not
driven by any single study alone. Meanwhile, the associa-
tions between vasectomy and high-grade, advanced, and fa-
tal prostate cancer were not statistically significant, although
the point estimates were similar to those for total diagnoses
of prostate cancer. If assuming causality, for the individual pa-
tient, the effect estimate for overall prostate cancer corre-
sponds to a 0.6% absolute increase in lifetime risk of incident
prostate cancer, or a number needed to harm of 156. At the
population level, only 0.5% of prostate cancers are estimated
to be associated with vasectomy. It is questionable whether
such a small increased risk is important to the public.
Although meta-analyses have been previously per-
formed, an analysis of cohort studies with a low risk of bias
has only recently been possible, with 6 of 7 such studies
reported within the last 3 years.16-20,32 One meta-analysis pub-
lished in 2002 pooled data from 5 cohort and 17 case-control
studies and found a significant association between vasec-
tomy and prostate cancer.12 Meanwhile, 2 more recent meta-
analyses combined data from 9 cohort studies and found no
significant association but had wide CIs.14,15 Another meta-
analysis combined data from 10 cohort studies and found no
association, but the lower limit of its CI barely crossed 1 (RR,
1.11; 95% CI, 0.98-1.27).13 Our meta-analysis, which included
53 studies, was able to separately analyze case-control, cross-
sectional, and cohort studies and was well powered and
achieved effect estimates with narrow CIs.
In our assessment, most of the 33 case-control studies, all
4 of the cross-sectional studies, and almost half of the 16

 cohort studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. Accord-
ingly, the point estimates for association between vasectomy
and prostate cancer were furthest from the null among pooled
analyses of case-control and cross-sectional studies. Publica-
tion bias might also have contributed, in part, based on fun-
nel plots. In contrast, the observed association was smaller in
magnitude in the pooled analysis of cohort studies, and even
smaller when restricted to studies (cohort and case-control
designs) deemed as having a low risk of bias. In addition, de-
spite methodological rigor, failure to account for differential
use of PSA screening may bias results because patients who
have undergone vasectomy are more likely to undergo PSA
screening and thus receive a diagnosis of prostate cancer.33 In
our study, the association between vasectomy and prostate
cancer held in a subset analysis restricted to studies that
accounted for PSA screening. Our analysis illustrates the sus-
ceptibility of observational studies to bias and highlights the
importance of meticulous study design.
More important, simply because a statistically significant
associationwasdetected,onecannotconfirmwithcertaintythat
a causal association exists. Owing to the observational nature
of pooled studies, residual unmeasured bias is still possible.
Residual detection bias remains an ongoing concern, even
though several studies accounted for serum PSA screening
and/or contact with the health care system. A recent article by
Tangenetal32illustratedthatdetectionbiasinfluencestheevalu-
ation of several risk factors that have been described as associ-
ated with decreased or increased prostate cancer risk. The
only way to address this source of bias would be a trial ran-
domizing men to undergo vasectomy vs no vasectomy.
However, a sufficiently powered trial with long enough
follow-up would be neither practical nor ethical. Therefore,
the present meta-analysis likely approaches the highest level
of clinical evidence reasonably attainable in evaluating the
association of vasectomy with risk of prostate cancer.
If applying the criteria of Hill,74 which have been widely
accepted as aiding in making causal inferences, one cannot
make a strong argument for a causal association between va-
sectomy and prostate cancer (eAppendix 5 in the Supple-
ment). Moreover, the case for biological plausibility is tenu-
ous. Although hormonal imbalances,75,76 immunologic
effects,77 and cell proliferative changes78 have been sug-
gested to play a role, the exact mechanisms remain to be de-
scribed in animal models.76,79 Although 1 study found that se-
rum testosterone levels are elevated in men who underwent
a vasectomy more than 20 years ago relative to men who did
not undergo a vasectomy,75 most studies have shown no
changes in testosterone levels following vasectomy.76,79 More-
over, there is no established association between elevated
serum testosterone level and risk of prostate cancer.80
Although vasectomy may lead to the development of anti-
sperm antibodies,81 there is no evidence that these antibod-
ies or the subsequent formation of immune complexes leads
to prostate cancer.79 One study found increased cell prolifera-
tion 7 days after vasectomy in the ductal system of the rat ven-
tral prostate,78 although the mechanism remains unclear.
Ontheotherhand,thebenefitsofvasectomyasamethodof
contraceptionmustbeconsidered.Morethan99%ofwomenwho
haveeverbeensexuallyactivehaveusedaformofcontraception
atsomepoint.82However,accordingtothemostrecentdata,45%
of pregnancies in 2011 in the United States were unintended83;
41%ofthesepregnanciesoccurredamongwomenwhousedcon-
traceptioninconsistently.82Two-thirdsofwomenusingcontra-
ception rely on nonpermanent methods, many of which have a
higher failure rate with typical use vs perfect use.84 Mean-
while, 25% of women rely on surgical sterilization for contra-
ception and 8% rely on male surgical sterilization. Given the
lower costs and lower risk of complications for vasectomy
compared with tubal ligation,1,2 it is clear that vasectomy is
underused and should be offered more routinely to couples
seeking a long-term method of contraception.
Strengths and Limitations
There are several strengths to this study, including its size, its
comprehensive search strategy in all languages, its careful re-
viewforstudyinclusion,itsthoroughassessmentofstudyqual-
ity, and its use of a priori secondary analyses. This study is the
first, to our knowledge, to separately evaluate studies with a
low risk of bias and to evaluate high-grade, advanced, and fa-
tal prostate cancers as secondary outcomes. Furthermore, we
used relative effect estimates to calculate absolute effect es-
timates, which are more useful and more readily interpre-
table for clinicians, policymakers, and patients.85
There are also limitations to our study. First, this meta-
analysis is based on observational data because randomized
trials are neither presently available nor likely to be performed
in the future. As such, the unmeasured biases present in the in-
dividual studies must be taken into account. Our analytic ap-
proach addressed this issue in part by separately evaluating
cross-sectional,case-control,andcohortstudiesand,addition-
ally, separately evaluating the cohort and case-control studies
withalowriskofbias.Second,publicationbiascannotberuled
out. On the other hand, publication bias would have had out-
comes in opposite directions in case-control and cohort meta-
analyses, yet these analyses were consistent with each other.
Finally, our analysis cannot definitively prove or disprove cau-
sality. However, as already outlined, a strong argument for a
causalassociationbetweenvasectomyandprostatecancerdoes
not exist based on our data and on other existing literature.
Although it is tempting to consider potential avenues of
further research on the link between vasectomy and prostate
cancer, there are many other research topics that warrant
greater priority in a system with finite health care research
resources. We have demonstrated that any risk, if present, is
sufficiently small that it is unlikely to be of clinical impor-
tance.Webelievethatthismeta-analysis,drawingon3decades
of epidemiologic literature, provides sufficiently robust data
to inform clinical care and supports the current guidelines of
the American Urological Association.1
Conclusions
Our meta-analysis found a weak association between vasec-
tomyandtheriskofprostatecanceramongcohortstudieswith
a low risk of bias and a similar but nonsignificant association

 among case-control studies with a low risk of bias. There was
a similar nonsignificant association between vasectomy and
high-grade, advanced-stage, or fatal prostate cancer. The as-
sociation between vasectomy and prostate cancer was stron-
ger when studies with moderate to high risk of bias were in-
cluded. If assuming a causal association, which is unlikely
based on our data and other existing literature, vasectomy
would confer only a 5% relative increase or a 0.6% absolute
increase in lifetime risk of prostate cancer, and would be re-
sponsible for only 0.5% of cases of prostate cancer in the popu-
lation. Therefore, although patients should be appropriately
counseled, concerns about the risk of prostate cancer should
not preclude clinicians from offering vasectomy to couples
seeking long-term contraception.
