Aims
The gut microbiome influences metabolic syndrome (MetS) and inflammation and is therapeutically modifiable.
Arterial stiffness is poorly correlated with most traditional risk factors. Our aim was to examine whether gut mi-
crobial composition is associated with arterial stiffness.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
We assessed the correlation between carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, and
gut microbiome composition in 617 middle-aged women from the TwinsUK cohort with concurrent serum metabo-
lomics data. Pulse wave velocity was negatively correlated with gut microbiome alpha diversity (Shannon index,
Beta(SE)= -0.25(0.07), P = 1� 10-4) after adjustment for covariates. We identified seven operational taxonomic units
associated with PWV after adjusting for covariates and multiple testing—two belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family.
Associations between microbe abundances, microbe diversity, and PWV remained significant after adjustment for lev-
els of gut-derived metabolites (indolepropionate, trimethylamine oxide, and phenylacetylglutamine). We linearly com-
bined the PWV-associated gut microbiome-derived variables and found that microbiome factors explained 8.3% (95%
confidence interval 4.3–12.4%) of the variance in PWV. A formal mediation analysis revealed that only a small propor-
tion (5.51%) of the total effect of the gut microbiome on PWV was mediated by insulin resistance and visceral fat,
c-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk factors after adjusting for age, body mass index, and mean arterial pressure.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusions
Gut microbiome diversity is inversely associated with arterial stiffness in women. The effect of gut microbiome
composition on PWV is only minimally mediated by MetS. This first human observation linking the gut microbiome
to arterial stiffness suggests that targeting the microbiome may be a way to treat arterial ageing.

Introduction
A
substantial
proportion
of
major
adverse
cardiovascular
events (MACE) within the population are not explained by
traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The gut microbiome has
been implicated in a variety of potential disease mechanisms
including
oxidative
stress
and
inflammation
that
could
influence vascular disease.1,2 We therefore examined the rela-
tionship between the gut microbiome composition and arterial
stiffness.

Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk,
especially in individuals with metabolic syndrome (MetS).3 Vascular
stiffness is a consequence of pathophysiological alterations involving
various functional elements of the vessel wall.4,5 It is a measure of vas-
cular ageing predictive of MACE but (when adjusted for blood pres-
sure) is weakly or unrelated to conventional risk factors.6–8
Several parameters are informative about arterial stiffness. Among
these, pulse wave velocity (PWV) is currently considered the gold-
standard measure of arterial stiffness and is predictive of future
cardiovascular events.9 Both chronic hyperglycaemia and hyperinsuli-
naemia have been demonstrated to lead to hypertrophy of vascular
smooth cells and fibrosis.10 In addition, levels of adipokines are signifi-
cantly correlated with arterial stiffness.11 These associations suggest
that factors contributing to insulin resistance and MetS may be
involved in the development of arterial stiffness. Another important
factor contributing to arterial stiffness is systemic inflammation.12
Evidence from this derives from the associations repeatedly reported
between levels of c-reactive protein (CRP) and PWV in healthy indi-
viduals13,14 and from the higher levels of arterial stiffness seen in
patients with primary inflammatory diseases after adjusting for car-
diovascular risk factors.15,16
The gut microbiome, i.e. the community of microbes in the gastro-
intestinal tract,17,18 has recently emerged as an important regulator of
systemic inflammation,19 glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity.13,14
We therefore hypothesized a relationship between gut microbiome
composition and PWV. To test this, we first investigated the associ-
ation between arterial stiffness, measured by PWV, and gut micro-
biome composition. We looked at the relationship between (i)
arterial stiffness and loss of microbiome ‘diversity’ (loss in the number
of species in the gut microbiome), a common finding in several disease
states1,20 and (ii) between arterial stiffness and specific operational
taxonomic units (OTUs). Secondly, we investigated whether any asso-
ciation between arterial stiffness and the microbiome might be
accounted for by specific circulating metabolites known to be gener-
ated by the gut microbiome: phenylacetylglutamine and trimethyl-
amine oxide (TMAO), previously linked to cardiovascular disease,2
and indoleproprionate (IPA),21 an antioxidant associated with MetS,22
and which might also influence arterial stiffness.
Methods
Study subjects were female twins enrolled in the TwinsUK registry, a na-
tional register of adult twins recruited as volunteers without selecting for
any particular disease or traits.23 Here, we analysed data from 617 female
twins with PWV, serum metabolites, and gut microbiome composition
determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.24 The study was approved by
NRES Committee London–Westminster, and all twins provided written
informed consent to take part in the study.
Phenotype measurements
Brachial blood pressure was measured with the participants in a supine
position according to British and Irish Hypertension Society Guidelines
using a validated automated oscillometric device (Omron, 705 IT,
Omron Health Care, Japan). Measurements were taken after at least
5 min of rest supine and an average of three measurements were used.
Carotid-femoral PWV was calculated from sequential recordings of ca-
rotid and femoral artery pressure waveforms using the SphygmoCor
system (AtCor medical, Australia). Difference in time of pulse arrival
from the R-wave of the electrocardiogram between the two sites was
taken as the transit time, and difference in path length was estimated using
surface measurements as previously described.25 Measurements were
made in triplicate, and mean values were used for analysis. The same sys-
tem was used to obtain central and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP)
by tonometric recording of radial artery pressure calibrated by brachial
blood pressure. Estimates of visceral fat mass were derived from Dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements of whole body com-
position as previously described.26
Fasting insulin levels were measured for the twin cohort using the
same methods as previously described.26 The homeostasis model
assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated mul-
tiplying overnight fasting plasma insulin (FPI) by overnight fasting plasma
glucose (FPG), then dividing by the constant 22.5, i.e. HOMA-
IR = (FPI� FPG)/22.515.
We calculated the 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD)27 to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual.
The score is based on the individual age, sex, total and HDL cholesterol,
systolic blood pressure, smoking status, use of blood pressure lowering
medications, and the presence of type 2 diabetes28 and is calculated for
women aged 40–79.
Environmental risk factors
Dietary intakes were estimated from a validated 131-item food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ).29 Fibre and omega 3 intakes (grams per day) were
derived from the UK Nutrient Database,30 which provided food content of
non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) determined by the Englyst method.31
Alcohol intake was measured by questionnaire and coded based on the
average units consumption per week (0= never, 1=1-5 units per week,
2= 6–10 units per week, 3= 11–15 units per week, 4= 16–20 units per
week, 5= 21–40 units per week, 6= >41þ units per week). Adherence to a
Mediterranean diet was calculated using the modified Mediterranean diet
score (MDS) method, as outlined by Trichopoulou et al..32 Physical activity
was measured by questionnaire asking their level of activity in a Likert scale
(none, light, moderate, intense). In order to account for socioeconomic sta-
tus, education, and access to health care an individual’s Index of Multiple
Deprivation (IMD) score (2015) from the UK Office of National Statistics
was used. This is based on the participants’ post code of residence
(<seurld>https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-depriv
ation-2015</seurld>) (details in the Supplementary material online).
Indoleproprionate, phenylacetylglutamine,
and trimethylamine oxide measurement
Circulating serum levels of IPA, phenylacetylglutamine and TMAO were
measured using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry by the metabolomics provider Metabolon, Inc.
(Research Triangle Park, USA) on fasting serum samples as described pre-
viously.33 We inverse normalized the metabolite data as it was not nor-
mally distributed. We imputed the missing values using the minimum run
day measures.
C-reactive protein measurement
C-reactive protein was measured by a highly sensitive automated micropar-
ticle capture enzyme immunoassay, standardized on the World Health
Organization International Reference Standard for CRP immunoassay 85/
506,34 as previously reported.35

Microbiota analysis
A diagram summarizing the pipeline used in the analysis of stool samples
for microbiome composition presented in Supplementary material on-
line, Figure S1. A diagram of metabolomic profiling is presented in
Supplementary material online, Figure S2.
The composition of the gut microbiome in faecal samples was deter-
mined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing carried out as previously
described.24 Briefly, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified
and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Reads were then summarized to oper-
ational taxonomic units (OTUs). Quality control was carried out on a per
sample basis, discarding paired-ends with an overlap of less than 200 nt
and removing chimeric sequences using de novo chimaera detection in
USEARCH.36 De novo OTU clustering was then carried across all reads
using Sumaclust within Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology
(QIIME) 1.9.0, grouping reads with a 97% identity threshold.37,38
Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology is a bioinformatic pipeline
designated for the task of analysing microbial communities that were
sampled through marker gene (e.g. 16S or 18S rRNA genes) amplicon
sequencing. Sumaclust is a programme that clusters sequences and
detects the ‘erroneous’ sequences created during amplification and
sequencing protocols, deriving from ‘true’ sequences. OTU counts were
converted to log transformed relative abundances, with zero counts
handled by the addition of an arbitrary value (10-6). The residuals of the
OTU abundances were taken from linear models, accounting for tech-
nical covariates including sequencing depth, sequencing run, sequencing
technician, and sample collection method. These residuals were inverse
normalized, as they were not normally distributed, and used in down-
stream analyses. In order to calculate alpha diversity, the complete OTU
count table was rarefied to 10 000 sequences per sample 50 times. Alpha
diversity metrics were calculated for each sample in each of the rarefied
tables and final diversity measures taken as the mean score across all 50.
Alpha diversities were quantified as observed OTU counts and Shannon
and Simpson diversity indices (see the Supplementary material online
for details). Alpha diversity indexes were standardized to have mean
0 and SD 1.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using Stata version 11. Random inter-
cept logistic regressions were undertaken to evaluate the association be-
tween PWV and gut microbial diversity (Shannon and Simpson indexes
and number of observed OTUs) adjusting for age, body mass index
(BMI), mean arterial pressure (MAP, the component of blood pressure
that is thought to influence PWV, rather than systolic blood pressure,
which is in large part determined by PWV), and family relatedness.
Linear regression was also employed to investigate the association be-
tween PWV and OTUs adjusting for covariates, family relatedness, and
multiple testing using false discovery rate (FDR< 0.1).
We accounted for familial relatedness using random intercept linear
regression:
Yi = b0þbiXijþciageijþdiBMIijþqjMAPþ1jþeij;
(1)
where Yi and Xij are respectively PWV (Y) and the microbiome abundance
of twin j from pair i. fj is the family-specific error component, which rep-
resents the omitted family characteristics or unobserved heterogeneity.
The comparison between PWV and variables is performed between each
twin pair. We reran the analyses additionally adjusting for (i) diet (omega
3 and fibre intake, adherence to a Mediterranean diet), (ii) environmental
factors including smoking, alcohol drinking habits, physical activity, socioe-
conomic status, PPI, and antibiotics use, that have been associated with
microbiota changes, (iii) insulin resistance (assessed by HOMA-IR), and
visceral fat mass that are considered important factors affecting arterial
stiffness and were associated with PWV in our data, (iv) the 10-year ath-
erosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score27 to account for
traditional CVD risk factors and serum levels of CRP to account for sys-
temic inflammation, (v) uric acid, previously found to correlate with vas-
cular stiffness.39 As faecal samples were taken 1.9 (SD = 1.5) years apart
from the PWV measurement, we ensured that the associations between
faecal microbiome composition and PWV were not influenced by the
number of years between date of PWV measure and microbiome meas-
ure. We therefore (i) reran the analyses for the significant associations
including samples taken more than 1 year apart and found no difference
in the regression coefficients; (ii) further adjusted for the time elapsed be-
tween PWV measure and faecal sample collection and results were
consistent.
We investigated for the association of three specific gut microbiome-
derived metabolites: IPA, involved in insulin resistance, TMAO and phe-
nylacetylglutamine and also adjusted for their levels.
Using standard multiple linear regressions, we computed the propor-
tion of the variance (R2) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI)40 in PWV not explained by age, BMI, and MAP that was
explained by microbiome diversity, microbiome OTUs, and microbiome-
derived metabolites. We further employed partial least squares structural
equation modelling (PLS-SEM)41 to test the mediation effects of ASCVD,
HOMA þ VFmass and CRP (indirect effect) on the total effect of micro-
biome factors on PWV which was adjusted for age, BMI, and MAP
(Supplementary material online, Figure S3). We constructed a mediation
model to quantify both the direct effect of microbiome factors on PWV
and the indirect (mediated) effects mentioned above. The model good-
ness of fit was assessed by standardized path coefficient and effect size
(f2)42–44 yield the lower and upper bound of the 95% CI. The variance
accounted for (VAF) score, which represents the ratio of indirect-to-
total effect and determines the proportion of the variance explained by
the mediation process, was further used to determine the significance of
mediation effect.41 A separate model was built to assess the association
between Shannon index and PWV. All PLS-SEM analysis was conducted
using the Smart-PLS 3 software. We also used IBM SPSS AMOS software
to conduct covariance-based (CB) SEM analysis. See Supplementary
material online for more details.
Results
The characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table
1. 617 females with both PWV and microbiome data were included
in the analysis. Both Shannon and Simpson indices of gut microbiome
diversity were significantly associated with PWV after adjusting for
age, BMI, MAP, and family relatedness (Figure 1). Examining the asso-
ciation between PWV and bacterial lineages or OTUs identified 7
OTUs that were significantly and negatively associated with PWV
after adjusting for covariates and multiple testing, FDR < 0.05 (Figure
1 and Supplementary material online, Table S1). Two OTUs from
the Ruminococcaceae family, one from the Rikenellaceae and one
from the Clostridiaceae, a member of the Actinobateria Collinsella
aerofaciens,45 a member of the Barnesiellaceae family, a member of
the Clostridiaceae family, and the genus Odoribacter were negatively
correlated with PWV.
Smoking/alcohol drinking habits, physical activity, fibre and omega
3 intake, adherence to a Mediterranean diet, socioeconomic status,
PPI, and antibiotics use, have been associated with either microbiota
changes46–49 or with arterial stiffness.50–53 Therefore, we additionally
adjusted for these risk factors as potential confounders and found

that the results remain consistent. Because levels of uric acid have
been associated with arterial stiffness39 we also adjusted for this fac-
tor (Figure 1 and Supplementary material online, Table S1). In addition
to lifestyle factors, we also adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk
factors and for systemic inflammation (Figure 1 and Supplementary
material online, Table S1). To do this, we used the 10-year ASCVD
risk score computed for each individual and CRP levels. The results
remain unchanged by these adjustments (Figure 1).
Because both higher gut microbiome diversity and the relative
abundance of microbes are associated with lower visceral fat
mass54,55 and insulin resistance,56 we assessed whether these associa-
tions were simply caused by higher visceral fat or higher insulin resist-
ance. Pulse wave velocity remained significantly associated with both
microbiome diversity and the identified microbial lineages (Figure 1)
after adjusting for these measures. Thus, in our cohort, PWV is signifi-
cantly associated with gut microbiome composition after adjusting
for the known likely covariates (insulin resistance, visceral fat) with
each standard deviation of the microbial abundances contributing an
effect size of -0.12 to -0.27 on PWV and achieving p-values ranging
from 0.002 to 3� 10-5 (Supplementary material online, Table S1).
We also explored whether specific compounds known to be gen-
erated by the gut microbiome that could be implicated in arterial age-
ing, like phenylacetylglutamine,57 TMAO,2 and the antioxidant IPA21
were related to arterial stiffness. The associations between PWV and
gut microbiome diversity and specific OTUs remained significant after
adjustment for these three compounds, although some of the associ-
ations were slightly attenuated suggesting that in part some of the
effects of the gut microbiome on arterial stiffness are mediated by
levels of phenylacetylglutamine and IPA.
Next, we quantified how much of arterial stiffness could be
explained by gut microbiome composition, and two of the three
compounds generated by the gut microbiome linked to this cardio-
vascular trait. We linearly combined the PWV-associated gut
microbiome-derived
variables—diversity
measures
(Shannon,
Simpson, and number of OTUs), bacterial OTUs, circulating levels of
the microbiome-derived metabolites phenylacetylglutamine, and IPA.
After adjusting for age, BMI, and mean arterial pressure the overall
proportion of variance explained by microbiome factors is 8.3% (95%
CI 4.32–12.4%).
We finally conducted PLS-SEM analysis to determine the indirect
effect of ASCVD, HOMAþ VFmass, and CRP on the effect between
microbiome factors and PWV. The mediation model (Figure 2A),
which intends to evaluate the strength of the indirect effects, found
that the direct relationship between microbiome factors and PWV
was statistically significant (path coefficient= -0.254, P < 0.001) and
the overall R2 was 8.4%. For indirect effect, only the effect of
HOMA þ VFmass was statistically significant. The VAF score for
HOMA þ VFmass was 4.91% while the combined VAF score of
ASCVD, HOMA þ VFmass, and CRP was 5.51%. The model to assess
the relationship between Shannon diversity and PWV also found a
significant direct effect (R2 4.1%; path coefficient -0.139; P < 0.001).
The composite indirect effect was 11.24% (Figure 2B). We also con-
ducted
CB-SEM
analysis
and
found
similar
results
(see
Supplementary material online, Figure S4). Thus, both PLS-SEM and
CB-SEM analyses found that the indirect effect of the gut microbiome
mediated by CRP, HOMA þ VFmass, and ASCVD risk to be statistic-
ally significant but of a small magnitude, with the majority of the effect
of gut microbiome composition on PWV not being mediated by
these factors.
Discussion
The major novel finding of this study is that arterial stiffness as meas-
ured by carotid-femoral PWV is inversely correlated with gut micro-
biome diversity and with the abundance of specific microbes in the
gut. These associations appear to be only in a small proportion medi-
ated by an effect on MetS-related traits such as insulin resistance or
visceral fat, but appear to be stronger than the associations of MetS
and CRP in with PWV.

Specifically, we find that arterial stiffness correlates negatively with
the abundance of Ruminococcaceae family bacteria. These are
butyrate-producing bacteria whose abundance has been shown in
mice to be linked to lower endotoxemia.58 Experimentally induced
acute endotoxaemia is known to increase inflammatory cytokines
and to cause endothelial dysfunction in humans, and chronic endo-
toxaemia is associated with MetS.59 It is well known that obesity,
higher visceral fat, and insulin resistance all correlate with lower
microbiome diversity.56 These factors contribute to arterial stiffness,
but microbiome diversity remains negatively correlated with PWV
after adjustment for all these factors. Similarly, microbiome-derived
metabolites, such as phenylacetyl glutamine, are associated with
lower PWV, but the association between OTUs and diversity with
PWV remains significant even after adjusting for these microbiome-
derive metabolites. We also find that all the microbiome factors that
we identified, namely diversity, seven OTUs, and two microbiome-
derived metabolites, make a contribution to explaining variation in
PWV (Figure 2) and only a small proportion of that effect can be
explained (after adjusting for MAP, age, and BMI) by traditional risk
factors, MetS and CRP levels. However, it is known that inflammatory
markers are very strongly associated with arterial stiffness60 and, al-
though we find that only a small proportion of the effect of micro-
biome composition on PWV, CRP is not the only known biomarker
for systemic inflammation predictive of CVD. Other markers, such as
interleukin (IL)-661 are associated with increased risk in addition to
the inflammation measured by CRP. Moreover, a meta-analysis of up
to 29 population-based prospective studies, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-a
were all found to result in significantly higher relative risks for non-
fatal myocardial infarction or CHD death after adjusting for tradition-
al risk factors.62
The causal role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of cardiovascu-
lar disease63 has been clearly demonstrated recently by the

trial
(Canakinumab
Anti-Inflammatory
Thrombosis
Outcomes Study).64 This trial has demonstrated beyond doubt that
inflammation plays a role in the development of atherothrombosis by
providing robust evidence that inhibiting IL-1b reduces the incidence
of repetitive atherothrombotic events.
The fact that the gut microbiome composition plays a key role in in-
flammatory and autoimmune disease is now well characterized.65
A common theme in inflammatory diseases, ranging from rheumatoid
arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis,
is a reduced microbiome diversity.65 Although, clearly, functional char-
acterization of the role of the various microbial lineages and microbial-
derived compounds on arterial stiffness is needed, we hypothesize that
the effect of gut microbiome composition on PWV is likely to be due
caused by its role in modulating systemic inflammation and that only a
part of this effect is captured by measuring CRP, insulin resistance, and
traditional risk factors part of the 10-years ASCVD risk score.
This is relevant because the gut microbiome’s diversity and com-
position is modifiable. Gut microbial richness and composition are, to
a large extent, modulated by diet.66 There is increasing evidence that
insufficient consumption of dietary fibre leads to a loss of bacterial
species in the human gut.67 Probiotics (live micro-organisms that in-
fluence the gut microbiome, mostly Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus

species) are another method to target the gut microbiome. A recent
systematic review has shown that probiotic supplementation has a
beneficial effect on blood pressure.68
We note several strengths and limitations to the current study.
The study was based on middle-aged white female twins and hence
may not be generalizable to other ethnic groups or to men. Although
the characteristics of these women are representative of the general
UK female population,23 clearly studies in men and in other ethnic
groups are needed.
The faecal samples collected were not necessarily taken at the
time of the PWV assessment. However, after adjustment for the time
elapsed between the two measures we find no difference in the
observed associations. For this reason, we suggest that our data are
most likely valid, which would be consistent with data showing that
the taxonomic composition and diversity of the gut microbiome re-
main constant over time69 in the absence of gross perturbation.70 It is
postulated in the literature that long-term stability of the human indi-
genous microbial communities is maintained not by inertia but by the
action of restorative forces within a dynamic system.70 Hence, the
reported associations between gut microbiome composition and ar-
terial stiffness unlikely to change majorly over time in a given individual.
Another limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the data. While
there is biological plausibility via endotoxaemia for the association
between arterial stiffness and microbiome composition being causal,
this cannot be concluded from a cross-sectional study. On the other
hand, we note several strengths, including the sample size of the study
and the detailed clinical and molecular phenotyping of the study sub-
jects, which has allowed us to test the relative contributions of differ-
ent factors to arterial stiffness.
Here, we show that cardiovascular risk that is not explained by
classical risk factors is likely to be in part captured by characterization
of the microbiome and may in the future help stratify CVD risk, par-
ticularly in younger individuals and in women. Although it is unlikely
to contribute to cardiovascular prevention guidelines at present, the
findings presented here fit within the context of current European
guidelines71 as follows: (i) The key outcome analysed was PWV. The
Sixth Joint Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology con-
cluded that PWV may serve as a useful biomarker to improve CVD
risk prediction for patients close to decisional thresholds, although its
systematic use in the general population to improve risk assessment
is not recommended. (ii) One of the gaps in evidence identified by
the European Task Force is that women continue to be under-repre-
sented in clinical trials. This study focuses specifically on cardiovascu-
lar risk in women. (iii) Gut microbiome composition is a modifiable
factor influenced by dietary fibre intake. Fibre intake is part of the cur-
rent recommendations for a healthy diet in the 2016 Task Force
Take home figure The gut microbiome is related to metabolic syndrome and inflammation, is modifiable via diet, medication and probiotics.
Arterial stiffness (measured by pulse wave velocity) is a predictor of major cardiovascular events, which is related to metabolic syndrome and inflam-
mation but poorly correlated with most traditional risk factors other than mean arterial pressure. The hypothesis of this study was that the gut micro-
biome composition could be related to arterial stiffness. This was measured in 617 women and both specific microbes and gut microbiome diversity,
a measure of gut dysbiosis, along with metabolites generated by the gut microbiome were found to be associated with arterial stiffness. In fact, the
microbiome related factors explain 8.3% of the variance in pulse wave velocity compared with only 1.8% of insulin resistance combined with visceral
fat. These data indicate a strong contribution of the gut microbiome to risk of arterial stiffness and suggest targeting the gut microbiome composition
as a therapeutic strategy.

recommendation. In fact, the gut microbiome composition may con-
tribute to the mechanism whereby dietary fibre intake influences car-
diovascular risk, which is yet to be fully elucidated.
In conclusion, in this study we show for the first time that the com-
position of the gut microbiome is strongly correlated with levels of
arterial stiffness in women independently of visceral fat and other
obesity-related traits. Given the possibility of modifying the gut
microbiome composition via diet and probiotic supplementation, this
opens therapeutic avenues for reducing arterial stiffness targeting the
gut microbiome.
