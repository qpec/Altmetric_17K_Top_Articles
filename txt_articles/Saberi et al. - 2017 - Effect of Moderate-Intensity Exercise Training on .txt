IMPORTANCE Formulating exercise recommendations for patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy is challenging because of concern about triggering ventricular arrhythmias
and because a clinical benefit has not been previously established in this population.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether moderate-intensity exercise training improves exercise
capacity in adults with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial involving 136 patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was conducted between April 2010 and October 2015 at 2
academic medical centers in the United States (University of Michigan Health System and
Stanford University Medical Center). Date of last follow-up was November 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to 16 weeks of moderate-intensity
exercise training (n = 67) or usual activity (n = 69).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was change in peak oxygen
consumption from baseline to 16 weeks.
RESULTS Among the 136 randomized participants (mean age, 50.4 [SD, 13.3] years; 42%
women), 113 (83%) completed the study. At 16 weeks, the change in mean peak oxygen
consumption was +1.35 (95% CI, 0.50 to 2.21) mL/kg/min among participants in the exercise
training group and +0.08 (95% CI, −0.62 to 0.79) mL/kg/min among participants in the
usual-activity group (between-group difference, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.17 to 2.37]; P = .02). There
were no occurrences of sustained ventricular arrhythmia, sudden cardiac arrest, appropriate
defibrillator shock, or death in either group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this preliminary study involving patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, moderate-intensity exercise compared with usual activity resulted
in a statistically significant but small increase in exercise capacity at 16 weeks. Further
research is needed to understand the clinical importance of this finding in patients
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as the long-term safety of exercise at moderate
and higher levels of intensity.

ypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common
monogenetic cardiac disease, with a prevalence of
1:200 to 1:500.1 Most genetically defined cases are at-
tributable to mutations in genes encoding cardiac sarcomere
contractile proteins.2 Clinically, hypertrophic cardiomyo-
pathy is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the
absence of ventricular pressure overload.3 Disease severity is
markedly variable, with some individuals experiencing a nor-
mal life span with minimal complications and others carry-
ing a high symptomatic burden.4,5 Hypertrophic cardiomyo-
pathy is a recognized cause of sudden cardiac death in young
competitive athletes, which has prompted international con-
sensus recommendations against competitive sports partici-
pationforallindividualswithhypertrophiccardiomyopathy.6,7
Whether recreational exercise is associated with an in-
creased risk of sudden cardiac death in individuals with hyper-
trophiccardiomyopathyisunknown.CurrentUSandEuropean
guidelines, based solely on expert consensus, do not agree on
the safety of moderate-intensity recreational exercise for pa-
tients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.7,8 Survey data have
shownthatpatientswithhypertrophiccardiomyopathyareless
active than the general US population, and most patients with
hypertrophiccardiomyopathyreportpurposefullyreducingtheir
activity after diagnosis.9 Exercise has been associated with im-
provedsurvivalandreducedcardiovascularmorbidityandmor-
tality in the general population.10-13 Thus, it is important to es-
tablish evidence-based guidelines for exercise practices in
patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Exercisehasbeenstudiedinpatientswithheartfailurewith
preserved and with reduced ejection fraction and is effective
in improving cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by peak
oxygen consumption (peak V
˙ O2), which is an accurate mea-
sure of exercise capacity.14-16 In the majority of patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peak V
˙ O2 is significantly
reduced,17 and the peak V
˙ O2 value correlates with New York
Heart Association class and quality of life (QOL).18 The goal of
this study was to determine whether an individually tai-
lored, moderate-intensity aerobic program would improve ex-
ercise capacity among patients with hypertrophic cardiomy-
opathy,withoutexacerbatingdiseaseprogressionorincreasing
the occurrence of arrhythmic events.
Methods
Study Design
The Randomized Exploratory Study of Exercise Training in Hy-
pertrophic Cardiomyopathy (RESET-HCM) was a randomized
clinical trial of individualized moderate-intensity aerobic ex-
ercise training vs usual activity in patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy performed at the University of Michigan (co-
ordinatingcenter)andStanfordUniversity.Theinstitutionalre-
viewboardsofbothcentersapprovedthetrialdesign(studypro-
tocol available in Supplement 1). All participants provided
written informed consent before enrollment. After randomiza-
tion,exerciseassignmentwasnotblinded,althoughstudystaff
who collected data on study outcomes were unaware of study
group assignments and all data analyses were blinded.
Recruitment took place between April 2010 and October
2015. Patients were randomized (1:1) by a single investigator
blinded to patient identity (S.M.D.) to a moderate-intensity
aerobic training intervention or usual activity using the
minimization technique,19 stratified by age (18-29; 30-50;
>50 years), sex, and presence of left ventricular outflow tract
(LVOT) obstruction at rest (LVOT peak gradient <30 mm Hg or
≥30mmHg).Anindependentdataandsafetymonitoringboard
was responsible for study oversight.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was change in peak V
˙ O2 from base-
line to week 16. Secondary outcomes included measures
of change in cardiac remodeling, QOL, and exercise perfor-
mance. Cardiac remodeling measures included magnitude of
cardiachypertrophy,leftventricularchamberdimensions,sys-
tolic and diastolic function, and scar volume as assessed
by a combination of echocardiography and cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging (CMR), plasma B-type natriuretic peptide
concentration, and degree of LVOT obstruction.
Quality of life measures included the Minnesota Living
WithHeartFailureQuestionnaire(MLHF)(range,0-105;higher
scores indicate worse QOL; minimal clinically important dif-
ference, 5 points), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symp-
tomatology–Self Report (QIDS-SR16) (range, 0-27; higher scores
indicate more severe depression), and the 36-Item Short-
FormHealthSurveyVersion2(SF-36v2)(8subscalesand2com-
ponent summary scores; range, 1-100; lower scores indicate
more disability; minimal clinically important difference, 3 to
5 points).
Exercise performance measures included other measures
of exercise capacity, including exercise time, peak metabolic
equivalent of tasks (METs), minute ventilation/carbon dioxide
production (VE/VCO2) slope, and anaerobic threshold. Nonfa-
talarrhythmiasincludingoccurrenceofnonsustainedventricu-
lar tachycardia (NSVT), atrial arrhythmias, and change in pre-
matureventricularcontraction(PVC)burdenwerealsoassessed.
Majoradverseeventsweredefinedasdeath,abortedsuddencar-
diac death, appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
(ICD) shock, and sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Key Points
Question Can moderate-intensity exercise training improve
exercise capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial of 136 patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, there was a small but statistically
significant increase in peak oxygen consumption in exercise group
participants vs usual-activity participants at 16 weeks (+1.35
mL/kg/min vs +0.08 mL/kg/min), with no occurrences of major
adverse events.
Meaning In this preliminary study involving patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, moderate-intensity exercise
resulted in a small increase in exercise capacity at 16 weeks.
Further research is needed to understand the clinical importance
of this finding, as well as to establish the long-term safety of
exercise at moderate and higher levels of intensity.

 Study Participants
Patients included in the study were 18 to 80 years of age and
had a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy defined by
left ventricular hypertrophy with end-diastolic wall thickness
15 mm or greater on 2D echocardiography in the absence of
other primary causes of left ventricular hypertrophy or wall
thickness between 13 and 15 mm in the presence of other fea-
tures suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, such as
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets, family
history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or positive genetic
test result.5
Major exclusion criteria included a history of exercise-
induced syncope or ventricular arrhythmias; medically
refractory LVOT obstruction being evaluated for septal reduc-
tion therapy; less than 3 months after septal reduction
therapy or ICD placement; history of hypotensive response
with exercise testing (>20 mm Hg decrease of systolic blood
pressure from baseline blood pressure or an initial increase in
systolic blood pressure followed by a decrease of systolic
blood pressure >20 mm Hg)20,21; clinical decompensation in
the previous 3 months, defined as New York Heart Associa-
tion class IV congestive heart failure symptoms or Canadian
Cardiovascular Society class IV angina symptoms; left ven-
tricular ejection fraction less than 55% by echocardiography;
life expectancy less than 12 months; pregnant or planned
pregnancy; inability to exercise owing to noncardiovascular
limitations; and unwillingness to refrain from competitive
sports, burst activity, or heavy isometric exercise for the
duration of the study.
Study Procedures and Timeline
Baseline studies included history and physical examination,
a physical activity questionnaire assessing average weekly
frequency and duration of exercise sessions in the previous
month, 12-lead electrocardiography, serum biomarker analy-
sis, genetic testing (eMethods in Supplement 2), transtho-
racic echocardiography, CMR, cardiopulmonary exercise
testing, and QOL assessment. Participants reported their sex
and race/ethnicity, with options defined by the investigators
(sex: male, female; race: white/Caucasian, black/African
American, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan native, Native
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, other). Race was
assessed only to provide information about the study sample
and was not considered to have an association with any of
the prespecified outcomes.
Patients randomized to the exercise training group par-
ticipated in a structured, unsupervised exercise program in-
dividually prescribed based on heart rate reserve derived from
the baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test. Exercise was ini-
tiated at a minimum of 3 sessions per week, 20 minutes per
session, at a heart rate corresponding to 60% of heart rate re-
serve (resting heart rate +0.6 [maximal heart rate minus rest-
ing heart rate]). A rating of perceived exertion on the Borg
scale22 was used as a secondary measure of goal exercise in-
tensity, and participants were instructed to maintain an in-
tensity correlating to perceived exertion ratings between 11 to
14, which correlates with a moderate level of intensity. The ex-
ercise prescription was designed to increase duration of exer-
cise by 5 to 10 minutes every week, up to 60 minutes per ses-
sion, 4 to 7 sessions per week, and then incrementally increase
training intensity to a goal of 70% of heart rate reserve during
the first month of the study protocol. Patients were in-
structed to maintain their exercise regimen from weeks 5
through 16 of the protocol. Modes of exercise included cy-
cling, walk-jog protocols, and elliptical training. No strength
training or burst-type activity was prescribed. Patients in the
exercise group received a 1-hour exercise consultation with a
certified exercise physiologist.
Patients randomized to the usual-activity group were not
providedwithaformalexerciseprescriptionatstudyentryand
were instructed to continue their current activity practices
through the duration of the study without any exercise direc-
tives. As an incentive for participation, patients in the usual-
activitygroupwereprovidedwithanexerciseconsultationand
exercise prescription at the conclusion of the study protocol.
All patients in both groups were provided heart rate
monitors (Timex Group; Polar USA Inc) and pedometers
(Omron Healthcare Inc). All patients also underwent 24
hours of continuous rhythm monitoring on enrollment, fol-
lowed by automatically triggered arrhythmia detection moni-
toring in their first month of study participation. Adherence
to the study protocol was evaluated among all participants by
activity logs and weekly telephone follow-up, including the
Stanford 7-day recall and downloadable data from heart rate
monitors and pedometers. Physical activity data were tabu-
lated into METs using the 2011 Compendium of Physical
Activities.23 MET-hours of activity were also calculated by
multiplying METs of each activity by time spent in hours.
All patients were asked to return for evaluation 4
months after enrollment and underwent the same proce-
dures as at the baseline visit. All electrocardiograms (investi-
gator S.S.), echocardiograms (S.S.), CMR images (P.P.A.,
A.A.), cardiopulmonary exercise test studies (W.H.), and
QOL surveys (S.S.) were interpreted at the coordinating cen-
ter, blinded to study group assignment. Additionally, V
˙ O2
and V
˙ E/V
˙ CO2 slope at the anaerobic threshold were assessed
in a random sample of 50 cardiopulmonary exercise tests
(including studies from both sites) at the coordinating center
by 2 interpreters (W.H. and Jacob Sitzman, BS, RCEP, CCES,
University of Michigan School of Medicine), with calculated
κ statistic of 0.96 and 0.79, respectively. Eleven percent of
enrollment cardiopulmonary exercise tests and echocardio-
grams and 5% of enrollment CMRs were obtained as part of
routine clinical evaluation.
Statistical Analysis
At our centers, the mean peak V
˙ O2 for patients with hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy was 24 mL/kg/min at the time of the
design of RESET-HCM.24 Data from small studies of exercise
training for patients with chronic heart failure available at
the time of study design demonstrated an approximately
20% increase in peak V
˙ O2 with 8 to 12 weeks of exercise.25-27
Assuming a similar effect size could be expected in patients
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the study was powered
to detect a difference of 20% (4.8 mL/kg/min) in peak
V
˙ O2 between the 2 groups with 90% power and a 2-tailed

 significance of .05 or less, which required 117 participants.
Assuming an attrition rate of 17% (15%-20%), the planned
recruitment was increased to a total of 136 patients.
Statistical analyses were performed by the coordinating
center using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Statis-
tical comparisons of the study groups with respect to clinical
outcomes were performed according to the intention-to-
treat principle. Patient characteristics are expressed as mean
(SD) or median (interquartile range) for continuous variables
and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.
Change in patient characteristics over time were performed
using the t test for continuous variables and χ2 or Fisher exact
test for categorical variables. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used
for testing differences in medians. Data that were not nor-
mally distributed were log transformed for statistical analy-
sis. The primary efficacy analysis was performed using analy-
sis of variance and linear regression, with baseline peak V
˙ O2
value as covariate. A secondary analysis of the effect of exer-
cise training was performed using multiple linear regression
with the baseline value of the outcome measure, site, and ge-
netic status as covariates.
A post hoc sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome
was performed by multiple imputation with 10 interactions
on all patients randomized by using demographics, baseline
characteristics, baseline comorbidities, and baseline cardio-
pulmonary exercise test parameters. Linear regression was
performed on the change in peak V
˙ O2, adjusting for baseline
value. In additional post hoc analyses, submaximal exercise
studies, defined as those with peak respiratory exchange
ratio less than 1.05, were removed from the primary end
point analysis and analysis of variance was performed. To
control for variability in peak effort, V
˙ O2 attained at respira-
tory exchange ratio 1.0 was analyzed by group. Comparison
of the PVC burden over time also was performed.
StatisticalsignificancewassetatP < .05using2-sidedtests
for the assessment of the primary outcome. Analyses of out-
comes for cardiac remodeling, QOL, and secondary measures
of exercise performance were not adjusted for multiple com-
parisons and therefore are considered exploratory and hy-
pothesis generating.
Results
Patient Characteristics
During a 5-year period, 728 adult patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy were screened for trial eligibility (Figure 1),
and 136 participants (16.9% with obstructive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy; 42% women; mean age, 50.4 [SD, 13.3]
years) were randomized into exercise training and usual-
activity groups. Baseline characteristics of patients in each
group are shown in Table 1. All but 1 of the participants who
completed the protocol underwent genetic testing. Baseline
clinical characteristics did not change over time (eTable 1
and eTable 2 in Supplement 2). The attrition rates in the
exercise training and usual-activity groups were comparable
at 16 weeks (14.9% vs 18.8%, respectively, P = .54). Baseline
clinical characteristics between participants who completed
the study compared with those who withdrew from the
study were also similar (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Primary End Point
At 16 weeks, mean change in peak V
˙ O2 was +1.35 (95% CI,
0.50 to 2.21) mL/kg/min among participants in the exercise
training group and +0.08 (95% CI, −0.62 to 0.79) mL/kg/min
among participants in the usual-activity group (between-
group difference, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.17 to 2.37] mL/kg/min)
(Figure 2), representing an absolute increase of 6% (95% CI,
1.27% to 22.7%) compared with baseline values. Adjustment
for baseline genetic status and study site did not attenuate
the improvement in peak V
˙ O2 observed in the exercise train-
ing group compared with the usual-activity group (difference
in increase in peak V
˙ O2 of +1.29 mL/kg/min [95% CI, 0.20 to
2.38 mL/kg/min]; P = .02).
Exploratory End Points
Measures of Cardiac Remodeling
There were no significant differences between the exercise
training group vs the usual-activity group at 16 weeks in terms
of changes in any measures of cardiac morphology or func-
tion (eTable 4 in Supplement 2), in LVOT gradient (eTable 4 in
Supplement 2), or in serum B-type natriuretic peptide levels
(eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Quality of Life
Among the outcomes examining effects of exercise training on
QOL, there were no significant differences between the exer-
cise group and the usual-activity group at 16 weeks in terms
of 9 scores of the SF-36v2 subscales, the QIDS-SR16 score, or 3
scores on the MLHF measures. The only significant differ-
ence between groups was for the SF-36v2 physical function-
ing scale (increase of 5.7 points in the exercise group and de-
creaseof2.5pointsintheusual-activitygroup;difference,+8.2
points [95% CI, 2.6 to 13.7 points]) (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
Exercise Performance
Based on physical activity surveys completed at the time of
study initiation, there were no significant differences be-
tween the groups in the weekly average time spent exercis-
ing. Prior to enrollment, 66 participants in the usual-activity
group and 65 in the exercise training group responded to a sur-
vey of current exercise habits. Twenty-seven (41%) of the par-
ticipants in the usual-activity group and 29 (45%) in the exer-
cise training group reported no regular exercise. Of those who
did report regular exercise, the majority walked (25/39 [64.1%]
in the usual-activity group, 26/36 [72.2%] in the exercise train-
ing group). During the study protocol, 7 of 28 (28%) partici-
pants in the usual-activity group and 26 of 28 (93%) in the ex-
ercise training group who reported no prior history of regular
exercise engaged in regular weekly exercise. During the study,
participants in the exercise training group exercised a mean
of1.5daysmoreperweekthanthoseintheusual-activitygroup
(3.6 days vs 2.1 days) and spent more time engaged in inten-
tional exercise (eTable 6 in Supplement 2). The most com-
mon modes of exercise during study participation were walk-
ing, jogging/running, swimming, elliptical use, and cycling.

 Participants in the exercise group had a greater change in peak
workload: 0.38 METs for exercise training vs 0.03 METs for
usual activity (difference, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.67]) (eFig-
ure 1A in Supplement 2).
Post Hoc Analyses
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Outcome Peak V
˙ O2
In a sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome, performed
using multiple imputation and including all participants in
the trial (n = 136), the mean change in peak V
˙ O2 was
+1.50 mL/kg/min (95% CI, −5.1 to 8.1 mL/kg/min) in the exer-
cise training group and +0.17 mL/kg/min (95% CI, −5.4 to
5.7 mL/kg/min) in the usual-activity group (difference,
1.22 mL/kg/min [95% CI, 0.09 to 2.35 mL/kg/min], adjusting
for baseline peak V
˙ O2).
Additional Post Hoc Analyses
When CPET studies with peak respiratory exchange ratio
(RER) less than 1.05 (indicating less than maximal effort
[n = 13]) were removed from the analysis, the change in peak
V
˙ O2 was +1.36 mL/kg/min in the exercise training group and
+0.06 mL/kg/min in the usual-activity group (between-group
difference, 1.30 mL/kg/min [95% CI, 0.15 to 2.45 mL/kg/min]).
Adjustment for the baseline peak V
˙ O2 did not attenuate the
difference in peak V
˙ O2 observed in the exercise training
group vs the usual-activity group (between-group difference,
1.18 [95% CI, 0.10 to 2.26]). In analyses controlling for vari-
ability in peak effort, V
˙ O2 attained at respiratory exchange
ratio 1.0, the mean change in V
˙ O2 at the same level of effort
was +1.17 mL/kg/min (95% CI, 0.19 to 2.15) in the exercise
training group and −0.09 mL/kg/min (95% CI, −0.75 to 0.57)
in the usual-activity group (difference, 1.26 mL/kg/min
[95% CI, 0.09 to 2.43]) (eFigure 1B in Supplement 2). Addi-
tionally, a significant reduction in PVC burden was observed
in the exercise group (−0.43 [95% CI, −1.06 to 0.20] PVC/h
vs 0.48 [95% CI, −0.12 to 1.08] PVC/h; difference, −0.91
[95% CI, −1.76 to −0.05] PVC/h; estimates calculated from
log-transformed data).

 Adverse Events
There were no occurrences of major adverse events, includ-
ing death, aborted sudden cardiac death, appropriate ICD
shocks, or sustained ventricular tachycardia in either group.
Exercise training was not associated with an increased occur-
rence of any nonfatal arrhythmias (Table 2).
Three participants in the exercise group were withdrawn
from the study after randomization because of symptomatic
NSVT. All 3 were withdrawn based on the recommendations
of the data and safety monitoring board. One patient who had
a history of NSVT experienced 30 seconds of NSVT on day 1
after enrollment, prior to starting the exercise program, and
was referred for ICD implantation. A second patient with a his-
tory of NSVT who already had an ICD implanted experienced
more frequent episodes of symptomatic NSVT unrelated to ex-
ercise. The third patient had no history of NSVT and experi-
enced a 28-beat run of NSVT on day 13 of the protocol, 1 hour
after exercising, and was referred for ICD implantation.
Discussion
In this preliminary study involving patients with hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy, moderate-intensity exercise com-
pared with usual activity resulted in a statistically significant
but small increase in exercise capacity at 16 weeks. No major
adverse effects occurred, and there was no difference be-
tween the groups in rates of nonsustained ventricular arrhyth-
mias or atrial fibrillation. Analyses of other outcomes of car-
diac remodeling, QOL, and exercise performance revealed no
differences between the exercise training group and usual-
activitygroup,exceptforimprovementofscoresonQOLphysi-
cal function scale, peak METs on cardiopulmonary exercise
test, and PVC burden favoring the exercise group. However,
these findings were not adjusted for multiple comparisons and
therefore should be interpreted cautiously and should be con-
sidered exploratory and hypothesis generating.
The findings from this randomized clinical trial provide
support for moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for improv-
ing exercise capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomy-
opathy. The magnitude of improvement in peak V
˙ O2 was mod-
est, with an absolute increase of 1.27 (95% CI, 0.17 to
2.37) mL/kg/min in the exercise training group compared with
the usual-activity group, representing an absolute increase of
6% (95% CI, 1.27% to 22.7%). In the largest study of exercise
in patients with heart failure (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial
InvestigatingOutcomesofExerciseTraining[HF-ACTION]),15,28
the exercise intervention was associated with an absolute
increase in peak V
˙ O2 of 0.6 mL/kg/min (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.77),
or 4%.15 In HF-ACTION, every 6% increase in peak V
˙ O2 was
associated with an 8% lower risk for cardiovascular mortality
or heart failure hospitalizations.29
Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise improves overall car-
diovascularhealthandsurvivalinthegeneralpopulation.11-13,30
Because hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause
of sudden cardiac death in young competitive athletes, there
is uncertainty about whether lower-intensity exercise could
predispose these patients to a similar risk. In the absence of
evidence to the contrary, many physicians caring for pa-
tients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy recommend ex-
tremely conservative physical activity restrictions, and
many patients are fearful of engaging in exercise at any level.31
Despite the need for data to inform such recommendations,7,8
to our knowledge, no clinical trial has previously imple-
mented an exercise intervention in patients with hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy.32
The current study demonstrates the feasibility of imple-
mentation of a 16-week structured exercise program for pa-
tients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with no major ad-
verse events observed in either group. The study population
included a substantial percentage of higher-risk individuals,
with more than 30% of patients having defibrillators and 4%
having a prior history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or
aborted sudden cardiac arrest.

 Reduced peak V
˙ O2 has been shown to correlate with
clinical decompensation and mortality in hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.33-35 No medications or interventions have
yet been shown to improve peak V
˙ O2 in patients with hyper-
trophic cardiomyopathy. This study provides preliminary
support for a regimen of unsupervised brisk walking 4 to 7
days per week for a minimum of 30 minutes, as a targeted
intervention for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyo-
pathy. This study also provides the rationale for future stud-
ies examining longer-term outcomes related to exercise
training in this population.
The individualized exercise prescriptions in this study
did not exceed a level considered within acceptable limits
for recreational exercise for patients with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.8 Yet participants in the exercise training
intervention exercised more frequently and purposefully
than those in the usual-activity group, suggesting that an
exercise consultation to establish an individualized exercise
training program for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyo-
pathy may be considered in clinical practice to promote a
healthy, active lifestyle.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, there is a potential for
sampling bias, because 386 of 728 potential study partici-
pants declined to participate and another 206 were ex-
cluded. However, the clinical characteristics of the patients en-
rolled in this study were similar to characteristics in the entire
cohorts at our respective institutions, as well as those in pub-
lished series from other institutions.33,36
Second, the effect size of exercise training in patients with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was relatively modest and was
substantially less than the anticipated effect size on which the
study was powered (ie, 20% relative improvement, absolute
improvement of 4.8 mL/kg/min in peak V
˙ O2 in the exercise
training group compared with the usual-activity group). The
anticipated effect size was based on small studies of exercise
training in patients with heart failure who were available at the
time of study design.25-27 Since then, the largest exercise train-
ing study in patients with heart failure, HF-ACTION, demon-
strated a much more modest relative improvement in peak V
˙ O2
(median, 4% increase).15
Third, although there were no major adverse events and
no signal for harm in any of the participants, the study was not
powered to assess safety of the exercise intervention. Such a
study would require a substantial sample size, given the rela-
tive rarity and infrequency of major adverse events in pa-
tientswithhypertrophiccardiomyopathycomparedwiththose
with chronic heart failure.4 While there was no evidence that
exercise-induced hypertrophic or fibrotic remodeling, future
studies with longer follow-up will be required to assess any po-
tential influence of exercise on disease progression.
Fourth, because of the nature of the intervention, it was
not possible to blind patients to treatment assignment. In the
absence of blinding, self-reported QOL scores may be biased
by patient expectations.
Fifth, the exercise prescription used in this study only in-
corporated moderate-intensity aerobic exercise in adult pa-
tients. Future studies will need to address the safety and ben-
efits of more vigorous aerobic exercise and isometric activities,
includingparticipationincompetitivesports,inbothadultand
pediatric patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Conclusions
In this preliminary study involving patients with hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy, moderate-intensity exercise com-
pared with usual activity resulted in a statistically significant
but small increase in exercise capacity at 16 weeks. Further re-
search is needed to understand the clinical importance of this
finding in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well
as the long-term safety of exercise at moderate and higher lev-
els of intensity.
