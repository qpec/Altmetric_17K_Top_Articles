Abstract
Type II testicular germ cell cancers (TGCT) are the most frequently diagnosed tumours in young men (20–40 years) and are classified as semi-
noma or non-seminoma. TGCTs are commonly treated by orchiectomy and chemo- or radiotherapy. However, a subset of metastatic non-semi-
nomas (embryonal carcinomas) displays only incomplete remission or relapse and requires novel treatment options. Recent studies have
shown effective application of the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 in tumour therapy, which interferes with the function of ‘bromodomain and
extraterminal (BET)’ proteins. JQ1-treated TGCT cell lines display up-regulation of genes indicative for DNA damage and cellular stress response
and induce cell cycle arrest. Embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines, which presented as JQ1 sensitive, display down-regulation of pluripotency
factors and induction of mesodermal differentiation. In contrast, seminoma-like TCam-2 cells tolerated higher JQ1 concentrations and were
resistant to differentiation. ECs xenografted in vivo showed a reduction in tumour size, proliferation rate and angiogenesis in response to JQ1.
Finally, the combination of JQ1 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin allowed for lower doses and less frequent application, com-
pared with monotherapy. Thus, we propose that JQ1 in combination with romidepsin may serve as a novel therapeutic option for (mixed)
TGCTs.

Introduction
Approximately 1 of 250 men (age 30–35 years) is diagnosed with
TGCT each year [1, 2]. These tumours presumably result from a
block in primordial germ cell differentiation, giving rise to the pre-
cursor lesion termed germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS) [3].
GCNIS are found in the spermatogonial niche of the testes near
the nursing Sertoli cells and remain dormant until late puberty [2,
4]. Between 20 and 45 years of age, they develop into invasive
TGCTs, either classified as seminoma or non-seminoma/EC [5].
Currently, TGCTs are treated by orchiectomy and/or additional
chemo- or radiotherapy [6]. However, a subset of 10–30% of
metastatic
non-seminomas
displays
incomplete
remission
or
relapse, due to chemotherapy resistance [2, 7]. For these therapy-
resistant tumours, novel treatment options need to be developed.
Recently,
the
cell-permeable
small-molecule
inhibitor
(+)-JQ1
(JQ1) was synthesized, which selectively binds the ‘BET’ family of
bromodomain proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT) [8]. Bro-
modomain proteins are epigenetic readers, which bind acetylated
histone residues and form complexes with transcription factors to
regulate gene expression [9, 10]. JQ1 displaces BET proteins from
chromatin, thereby interfering with the mRNA elongation of tran-
scribed loci [8].

 Interestingly, JQ1 displayed antitumourigenic effects in malignan-
cies such as leukaemia, glioblastoma or prostate cancer models by
inhibition of BRD4 [11–14]. The BET member BRD4 is a mediator of
transcriptional elongation in M/G1 cell cycle transition [15]. It recruits
the positive transcription elongation factor complex (pTEFb), which
activates expression of growth-promoting and cancer-associated
genes [16]. JQ1 was described as the first compound efficiently down-
regulating MYC-dependent gene expression by abrogating pTEFb-
dependent promoter-proximal pause release of Polymerase II [16, 17].
In this study, we analysed the molecular and cytotoxic effects of
JQ1 application on TGCT cells, Sertoli cells and fibroblasts. JQ1-
mediated bromodomain inhibition resulted in a dose-dependent
increase in apoptosis and G1/G0 arrest in TGCTs. Further, an additive
effect on apoptosis was seen when using JQ1 and the histone
deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin in combination. We propose that
JQ1 alone or in combination with romidepsin may serve as novel
therapeutic option for TGCTs.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
TGCT cell lines were cultured as described previously [18]. In brief,
TCam-2 cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Life Technologies,
Darmstadt, Germany). NT2/D1(-R), 2102EP(-R) and NCCIT(-R) cells
were cultured in DMEM medium (Life Technologies). Both media were
supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), 1% penicillin/strepto-
mycin (PAN, Aidenbach, Germany) and 200 mM L-glutamine (PAN).
Human adult fibroblast cells (MPAF) were grown in DMEM medium,
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA)
(PAN), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 200 mM L-glutamine. Human
Sertoli cells (FS1) were cultured in DMEM medium, supplemented with
20% FBS, 1% NEAA, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 200 mM L-gluta-
mine. TCam-2 cells were a kind gift from Prof. Dr. J. Shipley (Institute
of Cancer Research, Sutton, England). NT2/D1, 2102EP and NCCIT
were provided by Prof. Dr. L. Looijenga (Erasmus MC, Daniel den
Hoed Cancer Center, Josephine Nefkens Institute, Rotterdam, the
Netherlands). Cisplatin-resistant NCCIT (NCCIT-R), 2102EP (2102EP-R)
and NT2/D1 (NT2/D1-R) were kindly provided by PD Dr. F. Honecker
(Breast and Tumor Center, ZeTup Silberturm, St. Gallen, Switzerland).
MPAF were obtained from Dr. M. Peitz (Bonn University, Institute of
Reconstructive Neurobiology, Bonn, Germany). FS1 were provided by
Dr. V. Schumacher (Boston Children’s Hospital, Department of Urol-
ogy; Harvard Medical School, Department of Surgery, Boston, MA,
USA).
JQ1 and romidepsin treatment in vitro
The cells were treated with 100, 250 and 500 nM JQ1 inhibitor (kindly
provided by Jay Bradner, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA,
USA) or 2 and 5 nM romidepsin (Celgene, Signal Pharmaceuticals, LLC,
San Diego, CA, USA; MTA ID #CC0488464), respectively. As a negative
control, the cells were treated with equal amounts of reconstitution
solution (DMSO) only.
AnnexinV/7AAD and PI-FACS analysis
AnnexinV/7AAD and PI-FACS analyses were performed as described
before [19]. In brief, cells were plated out at a density of 2 9 105
cells/well in a six-well plate for EC cell lines and 1 9 105 cells/well
for TCam-2, FS1 and MPAF. After indicated time-points, apoptosis
was analysed via AnnexinV/7AAD FACS staining, using the PE Annexin
V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD BioSciences, Heidelberg, Germany).
For cell cycle analysis, cells were trypsinized, washed in 1 9 PBS
and fixed in 100% ice-cold methanol at �80°C for 2 hrs. After fixa-
tion, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml PI staining
solution (PBS + 2 ll PI (1 mg/ml), +20 ll RNAseA (10 mg/ml)). The
cells
were
analysed
(50,000
cells/tube)
in
a
FACS
Canto
(BD
BioSciences).
XTT assay
For XTT assay, cells were plated out at a density of 3000 cells/well in a
96-well plate. JQ1/romidepsin was supplemented after 24 hrs. Cells
were stained for their viability by XTT after 24/48/72/96 hrs of initial
treatment. The XTT assay was performed as described previously [19].
RNA and protein isolation
For RNA and protein isolation, cells were seeded out at a density of
1 9 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate prior to initial JQ1/romidepsin treat-
ment. Proteins were isolated using ELISA Lysis buffer (Cell Signaling,
Leiden, the Netherlands). The cell lysate was incubated for 10 min. on
ice, followed by a 5-min. centrifugation step at 15,300 9 g and 4°C.
Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Total RNA was extracted
using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA quality was
assessed by photometric measurement of ratios 260/280 nm and 260/
230 nm using a NanoDrop photometer (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany).
Western blot
Western blot analysis was performed as described elsewhere [19]. For
detection, the membrane was incubated for 5 min. in 2 ml PierceSuper
Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific), and
the signal was recorded using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc
TM MP Imaging
System
(Bio-Rad,
M€
unchen,
Germany).

Table 1. Densitometric quantification of Western blot protein bands was
performed with IMAGEJ Software (Wayne Rasband, National Institute of
Health, Bethesda, USA). Density values were calculated relative to the
loading control (=1).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed as described previously
[20]. In brief, cDNA was synthesized using Maxima First Strand cDNA
synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). For qRT-PCR, 8.33 ng of cDNA was
run in technical triplicates with Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix
(Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Primer sequences are listed in

Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 expression array
Illumina expression microarray analysis was performed as described
elsewhere [20]. In brief, the cell lines were analysed after 24 and 72 hrs
of JQ1 treatment (100 nM) and DMSO as solvent control. Total RNA
was extracted and RNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis in a
BioAnalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples
were processed on an Illumina Human HT-12 v4 Bead Chip (Illumina,
San Diego, CA, USA), which was performed at the Institute for Human
Genetics, Bonn, Germany. Bioinformatic analysis and data normalization
were performed by Andrea Hofman (Institute for Human Genetics, Bonn,
Germany). Microarray data sets are publically available via GEO:
GSE87477 (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Venn diagrams were calculated
using Venny (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/) [21]. Protein inter-
action networks were predicted using STRING analyses (http://string-db.
org/) [22].
In vivo xenograft studies
Xenotransplantation was performed as described previously [23]. In
brief, 1 9 107 cells were resuspended in 500 ll of 4°C cold Matrigel
(BD) and injected into the flank of CD1nu/nu mice. Tumours were
then grown for 2 weeks and subsequently treated with JQ1 or romi-
depsin.
JQ1 and romidepsin treatment in vivo
Ten per cent (2-Hydroxypropyl)-b-cyclodextrin (HP-b-CD) solution
was used as a vehicle, which improves drug solubility (Sigma-
Aldrich, Munich, Germany) [24]. The concentrated stock of JQ1 in
DMSO was diluted 1/10 in 10% HP-b-CD to obtain a final concen-
tration of 50 mg/ml. Romidepsin was added 1/100 to achieve a
final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. For JQ1 treatment, the animals
were dosed 50 mg/kg, 5 days/week, i.p. For combination treatment,
the animals were dosed 50 mg/kg JQ1 + 0.5 mg/kg romidepsin
3 days/week, i.p. Tumour growth was measured everyday using a
calliper.

 Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously [20, 25].
Tumours were dissected, fixed in 4% formalin at 4°C overnight and pro-
cessed in paraffin wax. Staining was performed semiautomatically in the
Autostainer 480 S (Medac, Hamburg, Germany). For antibody details, see
Table 1. Stainings were quantified from three individual tumours (n = 3).
Significance was calculated using two-tailed Student’s t-test.
Results
TGCT cell lines express the BET members BRD2,
BRD3 and BRD4
JQ1 is a small-molecule inhibitor that blocks the binding pocket of
bromodomain proteins for acetylated lysine residues of histones,
thus interfering with the cellular transcriptional machinery [16].
Different studies have demonstrated its potential use in cancer
therapy; however, nothing is known so far about the efficacy of
JQ1 treatment in TGCTs. First, we determined expression levels of
BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT by qRT-PCR. We utilized three dif-
ferent EC cell lines (NCCIT, NT2/D1, 2102EP) and their cisplatin-
resistant subclones (NCCIT-R, NT2/D1-R, 2102EP-R) as well as
the seminoma cell line TCam-2. As proxies for somatic cells and
cells of the testis microenvironment, we included a human fibrob-
last (MPAF) and Sertoli cell line (FS1) in our analysis. All cell lines
showed highest mRNA expression levels of BRD2 (Fig. 1A). Levels
of BRD3 and BRD4 were lower, while expression of BRDT was
very weak to absent (Fig. 1A). The cisplatin-resistant subclones
display comparable levels of BRD2, BRD3 and BRDT as the paren-
tal cell lines (Fig. 1A). BRD4 mRNA levels appeared slightly lower
in cisplatin-resistant cell lines (Fig. 1A). By meta-analysing previ-
ously published microarray data, we confirmed expression levels
of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT in TCam-2, NCCIT, 2102EP, FS1
and MPAF (Fig. S1A) [19]. Additionally, we performed Western
blot analysis to compare BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 protein levels to
RNA expression. We detected BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 in the nuclei
of TCam-2, NCCIT, NT2/D1, 2102EP and FS1 Sertoli cells (Fig. 1B).

 Interestingly, quantitation of protein bands relative to HDAC1 levels
revealed that there is no correlation between RNA expression and
protein levels in all cell lines analysed (Fig. 1B). The differences
between RNA and protein levels might point at differences in regu-
lation of transcription, RNA / protein half-life or RNA-protein-turn-
over between the BRD members. Nevertheless, in all TGCT cell
lines and Sertoli cells, BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 protein levels were
detected.
Next, we used previously published microarray data to analyse
expression of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT in TGCT tissues [26].
Expression levels were measured in normal testis tissues, GCNIS
lesions, seminomas and ECs and presented as highly similar to the
in vitro expression data (Fig. 1C versus A). In normal testis tissue,
high BRDT expression levels were detected, while TGCT tissues
showed significantly lower levels. We hypothesize that the expression
of BRDT in TGCT tissues reflects the presence of BRDT positive
germ cells (Fig. 1C) [27, 28]. We conclude that in TGCTs, BRD2,
BRD3 and BRD4 are expressed, and thus, application of JQ1, which
blocks BET function, may affect growth and survival of TGCTs as well
as normal gonadal cells.
JQ1 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in
TGCT cell lines
Next, we treated TGCT and control cell lines with 100–500 nM JQ1
and used AnnexinV/7AAD FACS analysis to measure induction of
apoptosis. In all TGCT cell lines, JQ1 markedly increased the fraction
of apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2A).
After 16 hrs of treatment, the lowest JQ1 dose (100 nM) initiated
apoptosis in the EC cell lines NCCIT(-R) and NT2/D1(-R). The nullipo-
tent EC cell lines 2102EP(-R) displayed apoptosis later after 20 hrs.
Interestingly, two (2102EP-R, NT2/D1-R) of three cisplatin-resistant
subclones displayed a higher sensitivity to JQ1-induced apoptosis
compared with the parental EC cell lines (Fig. 2A). TCam-2 cells did
not display apoptosis before 72 hrs at all three concentrations (100,
250 and 500 nM), suggesting a reduced sensitivity towards JQ1
(Fig. 2A, Fig. S2B). Indeed, 100 nM JQ1 was tolerated by TCam-2
cells over a time period of 16 weeks (Fig. S2C), but 500 and 250 nM
JQ1 induced apoptosis in TCam-2 cells after 8 and 15 days, respec-
tively (Fig. S2B). Notably, the Sertoli cell line FS1 showed strong

 induction of apoptosis after 72 hrs of JQ1 treatment, indicating
adverse effects of JQ1 treatment on the microenvironment of the
testes, that is Sertoli cells (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3A). In contrast, cell viability
of fibroblasts remained unchanged (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3A). To confirm the
induction
of apoptosis,
cleavage
of
PARP
was
analysed
by
immunoblotting in JQ1-treated TGCT and control cell lines. Treatment
with 500 nM JQ1 resulted in PARP cleavage in TGCT cell lines and
Sertoli cells after 24 and 72 hrs, respectively (Fig. 2B and C). This
effect was not detectable in fibroblasts, further stressing the point
that fibroblasts are more resistant to JQ1 (Fig. 2C).
In glioblastoma, leukaemia and medulloblastoma cells, JQ1 treat-
ment induced G1 cell cycle arrest [12, 17, 29]. Here, we used PI-FACS
to analyse cell cycle distribution in JQ1-treated TGCT cell lines. As
expected, all TGCT cell lines displayed a pronounced decrease of cells
in S-phase and accumulation of cells in G1/G0 phase (Fig. 2D). Of
note, even TCam-2 cells treated for 16 weeks with 100 nM JQ1
enriched in G1/G0-phase (Fig. S3B). G1/G0 arrest was also seen in
fibroblasts, while Sertoli cells display accumulation of cells in G2/M-
phase, indicative for a G2/M cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2D). We conclude
that in ECs JQ1 treatment leads to induction of apoptosis at concen-
trations ≥100 nM, while in seminomas apoptosis is induced at con-
centrations ≥250 nM. Also, JQ1 treatment leads to accumulation of
TGCT cells in G1/G0 phase at concentrations ≥100 nM. However, JQ1
treatment is also reducing cell viability and interfering with cell cycle
progression of Sertoli cells, indicating an adverse effect on the testis
microenvironment. In contrast, human fibroblasts are resistant to the
pro-apoptotic effects of JQ1 and display cell cycle arrest only.
JQ1 up-regulates DNA damage and cellular
stress sensors and down-regulates pluripotency
factors in TGCT cell lines
Next, we analysed the changes in gene expression after JQ1 treatment.

 fibroblasts (MPAF) were treated with 100 nM JQ1 and subjected to
expression microarray analysis (Data S1A-D). Venn diagrams summa-
rize the numbers of deregulated genes in all cell lines analysed (Data
S1A-D), indicating a total number of 329 deregulated genes in TCam-2
and 601 genes in NCCIT (Data S1A and B). JQ1-resistant fibroblasts
displayed differential expression of 180 genes, while JQ1-sensitive
FS1 cells showed deregulation of 48 genes only (Data S1C and D).
Comparing the group of tumour cell lines (TCam-2, NCCIT) to
somatic cells (MPAF, FS1), revealed no commonly deregulated
genes (Data S1E), indicating a different response towards JQ1
treatment. However, all four cell lines showed up-regulation of
genes of the HIST1 and HIST2 clusters, which encode for building
blocks of histone molecules [30] (Fig. 3A and B; green labels, Data
S1A–D; green labels), an effect that was already demonstrated in
previous publications [16, 17, 31]. We then sorted for commonly
deregulated genes in TCam-2 and NCCIT only and found several
genes up-regulated after 24 hrs, classified as ‘early effects’, that is
strong up-regulation of the cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis-asso-
ciated genes CDKN1C, DDIT4, TSC22D1 and BTG1 (Fig. 3A, blue
labels) and induction of the mesodermal differentiation marker
HAND1 (Fig. 3A, yellow labels) [32–36]. We utilized STRING algo-
rithm to predict protein–protein interactions among the commonly
early up-regulated genes. There, interaction of the HIST1 and HIST2
cluster members was predicted (Fig. S4A).
Among the ‘late effects’ (72 hrs), we found up-regulation of the
antiproliferative markers TXNIP, ATF3, RHOB and JUN [37–39]
(Fig. 3B, blue labels). Additionally, we still found up-regulation of the
markers HAND1, TSC22D1 and BTG1 (Fig. 3B, yellow and blue labels).
STRING algorithm predicted a network consisting of TXNIP, ATF3,
MAFB, RHOB, JUN and TUBB3, suggesting that these factors interact
in response to JQ1 (Fig. 3C). Up-regulation of ATF3, RHOB and
HAND1 after 72 hrs was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis in TCam-2,
NCCIT and additionally NT2/D1 (Fig. S5A). Of note, the nullipotent EC
cell line 2102EP did not display up-regulation of these markers at simi-
lar concentrations (100 nM), but showed up-regulation of ATF3, RHOB
and HAND1 at JQ1 concentrations starting from 750 nM, indicating a
different dose-response of the TGCT cell lines TCam-2, NCCIT and
NT2/D1 compared to nullipotent 2102EP cells (Fig. S5B).
Among the down-regulated genes, we found THY1, a marker for
undifferentiated spermatogonia, which is suppressed after 24 and
72 hrs of JQ1 treatment (Fig. 3A and B, purple labels) [40, 41]. By
qRT-PCR analysis, down-regulation of THY1 was confirmed in TCam-
2, NCCIT, NT2/D1 and 2102EP (only at concentrations ≥750 nM), but
was absent in FS1 and MPAF (Fig. S5A and B). Similarly, treatment of
TGCT cell lines with JQ1 for 72 hrs resulted in down-regulation of
three members of ‘Interferon-induced Transmembrane Protein’ family
(IFITM1 - 3), which were predicted to interact by STRING (Fig. 3A and
B, red labels; Fig. 3D). In mice, Ifitm1-3 encode for cell surface
proteins that may confer distinct guidance cues for migrating primor-
dial germ cells [42, 43]. Thus, down-regulation of THY1 and IFITM1-3
may suggest a loss of germ cell-like characteristics and the induction
of differentiation.
Additionally, we detected down-regulation of a set of pluripo-
tency-associated factors (ZSCAN10, UTF1, LIN28) (Fig. 3A and B,
light green labels) [44–48]. Of these, LIN28A, ZSCAN10 and UTF1
are predicted to interact by STRING (Fig. 3D). To analyse the
effects of JQ1 on the pluripotency circuitry of TGCTs in more
detail, we sorted for genes specifically deregulated in the pluripo-
tent EC cell line NCCIT and detected strong down-regulation of
GDF3, POU5F1, NANOG and DNMT3B (in addition to already
detected ZSCAN10, UTF1 and LIN28) (Data S1B) [20, 49, 50]. A
GeneTrail-based ‘Gene Ontology’ analysis of all genes up-regulated
(fold change ≥Log21.0) in NCCIT cells demonstrated that down-reg-
ulation of pluripotency factors coincided with up-regulation of mar-
ker genes indicative for differentiation into all three germ layers
(mainly mesoderm) (Fig. 3E, Data S1F). Further, qRT-PCR analysis
verified down-regulation of LIN28, POU5F1, GDF3 and DNMT3B in
NCCIT,
NT2/D1
and
2102EP
(again
only
at
concentrations
≥750 nM) (Fig. S5A and B). To validate these findings on protein
level, we measured GDF3, POU5F1 and LIN28 expression in JQ1-
treated TGCT cell lines by immunoblotting. In line with the qRT-
PCR data, GDF3, POU5F1 and LIN28 (only slightly) are down-regu-
lated in NCCIT and NT2/D1 (Fig. 3F). In TCam-2, we only found
down-regulation of LIN28 protein after 72 hrs of JQ1 treatment
(Fig. 3F). These findings suggest that JQ1 represses the pluripo-
tency circuitry in TGCT cell lines, resulting mainly in differentiation
into mesoderm.
Of note, BRD4 (and co-factors) activates MYC transcription [16,
17]. Thus, JQ1-based interference with BRD4 function should lead to
reduction of MYC levels, as previously described [16, 17]. However,
increasing evidence suggests that some cancer types escape JQ1-
mediated repression of MYC [51–53]. In this study, we found weak
(NCCIT, NT2/D1, 2102EP) to strong (TCam-2) up-regulation of MYC
transcript levels 24–72 hrs after JQ1 application (Fig. S6A). In con-
trast to the mRNA data, MYC protein levels remained unaffected
(Fig. S6B). Unexpectedly, TCam-2, which tolerated higher levels of
JQ1, displayed reduced levels of MYC protein at 500 nM (Fig. S6B).
So, the role of MYC in the response of TGCT cell lines to JQ1 treat-
ment remains elusive.
In summary, we were able to show that JQ1 treatment of TGCT
cell lines in vitro results in up-regulation of DNA damage and stress
sensors in TCam-2, NCCIT, NT2/D1 and 2102EP cells. Further, in EC
cell lines, we demonstrated down-regulation of pluripotency-asso-
ciated genes and strong induction of germ-layer differentiation
markers. These effects were not observed in human fibroblasts or
Sertoli cells.

 JQ1 treatment reduces tumour burden of mice
with xenografted EC cells
To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of JQ1 application in vivo, we
xenografted two different EC cell lines (NCCIT, NT2/D1) into the flank
of nude mice. After 2 weeks of initial tumour growth, we treated these
mice 5 days/week with 50 mg/kg JQ1 i.p. for 2 weeks. After 1 week,
the xenografted animals showed a significant reduction in tumour
burden after JQ1 treatment compared with animals treated with sol-
vent only (Fig. 4A–D). Additionally, JQ1-treated tumours displayed a
pale and opaque texture and showed a reduced infiltration of blood
vessels, suggesting reduced angiogenesis (Fig. 4A and B). In line,
previous studies demonstrated suppressed tumour angiogenesis after
JQ1 treatment in in vivo models of childhood sarcoma [54]. Immuno-
histochemistry verified diminished angiogenesis in JQ1-treated NCCIT
tumours by detecting significantly reduced CD31 staining, a marker
for endothelial cells [55] (Fig. 4E). Additionally, immunohistochemical
staining demonstrated a significant reduction of Ki67-positive cells in
JQ1-treated
tumours,
confirming
reduced
cellular
proliferation
(Fig. 4F). So, EC xenografts are affected by JQ1 in two ways, they are
restricted in tumour growth and neo-angiogenesis.
Combination treatment with JQ1 and romidepsin
effectively reduces cell viability of seminoma
and EC components
JQ1 treatment induced CDKN1C, RHOB, ID2 and ATF3 expression in
TCam-2, NCCIT and NT2/D1, as determined by microarray (Data S1A
and B) or qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, we published
recently that a similar up-regulation of RHOB, ATF3, CDKN1C and ID2
is detected in TCam-2, NCCIT and NT2/D1 upon treatment with the
HDAC inhibitor romidepsin (Fig. 5A) [19]. Thus, we asked, whether
further romidepsin effector genes were up-regulated in JQ1-treated
TGCT cell lines. Indeed, similar to romidepsin-treated TGCT cell lines,
we demonstrated up-regulation of DUSP1 and GADD45B after JQ1
(Fig. 5A). Of note, expression of these markers was not further
increased after combinatorial treatment with both epigenetic drugs
(Fig. 5A). So, romidepsin and JQ1 treatment induce a similar stress
response in TGCT cell lines.
In a murine lymphoma model, combined HDAC and BET inhibitor
treatment led to enhanced apoptosis, improving the overall survival of
lymphoma-bearing mice compared to mice treated with the respective
monotherapies [56]. Further, in human breast cancer cell lines, JQ1
and the HDAC inhibitor mocetinostats were shown to synergistically
reduce cell viability and cell cycle progression [57]. Thus, we asked
whether a combination therapy would increase the pro-apoptotic
effects of JQ1 or romidepsin monotherapy in TGCT in vitro. Therefore,
we treated TGCT cell lines once with either JQ1 (100 and 250 nM) or
romidepsin (2 and 5 nM) or both drugs in combination prior to a 96-
hrs incubation period. Cell viability was assessed by XTT assay every
24 hrs relative to solvent-treated control cells (Fig. 5B). We found
that TCam-2 were sensitive to low-dose romidepsin treatment
(2 nM), but resistant to a single application of JQ1 (100 or 250 nM)
(Fig. 5B). In contrast, the cytotoxicity of low-dose romidepsin appli-
cation (2 nM) in TCam-2 was enhanced by additional application of
100 or 250 nM JQ1 (Fig. 5B). NCCIT cells were sensitive to JQ1 treat-
ment (100 or 250 nM), while a low dose of romidepsin (2 nM) had
only mild effects on viability (Fig. 5B). Only application of 5 nM romi-
depsin plus 100 or 250 nM JQ1 strongly reduced viability of NCCIT
cells (Fig. 5B). Hence, we found that compared to EC cell lines semi-
noma-like TCam-2 are more sensitive to romidepsin, while being
more resistant to JQ1. Vice versa, compared to TCam-2, EC cell lines
are sensitive to JQ1, while being more resistant to romidepsin. Thus,
a subject diagnosed with a mixed TGCT, including seminoma and EC
populations, would benefit from a combination of HDAC and BET inhi-
bitors.
We then asked whether this combination of BET and HDAC
inhibitors also kills TGCTs in vivo. Therefore, NCCIT and NT2/D1
cells were xenografted into the flank of 6-week-old nude mice
and after 2 weeks of initial tumour growth, mice were treated
3 days/week with 50 mg/kg JQ1 + 0.5 mg/kg romidepsin i.p. for
10 days. The animals show a significant reduction in tumour bur-
den after 2 days (Fig. 5C and D). Importantly, a similar reduction
of tumour burden was achieved using a less frequent application
of JQ1 + romidepsin (3 times/week) as compared to JQ1-only
treated animals (5 times/week) (Figs 5D versus 4C and D). Addi-
tionally, romidepsin concentrations used in this in vivo experiment
(0.5 mg/kg) were considerably lower than in a study published
recently (2 mg/kg) [19]. This suggests that a combination of both
drugs may be administered less frequently and at lower doses,
still resulting in a comparable reduction of tumour burden as
under monotherapy. Similar to JQ1-treated NCCIT- and NT2/D1-
derived tumours, the JQ1 + romidepsin-treated tumours displayed
reduced infiltration of blood vessels and a pale, opaque morphol-
ogy (Fig. 5C). Further, immunohistochemical staining showed a
reduction in Ki67-positive cells, suggestive of reduced cell prolif-
eration (Fig. 5D). In conclusion, additive effects of both drugs
allow
for
a
less
frequent
application
scheme
compared
to
monotherapy.
Discussion
The BET protein family has been described as a promising target for
epigenetic therapy and led to the development of the putative cancer
therapeutic JQ1 [16, 58]. A short elimination half-life and a good
pharmacokinetic profile provide JQ1 with ideal drug-like properties
[59]. JQ1 inhibits the BET member BRD4, which is involved in regula-
tion of genes associated with growth and cell cycle progression; thus,
JQ1 was considered as a cancer therapeutic [8].
Here, we analysed the molecular effects of JQ1 on TGCT cell
lines, while utilizing human fibroblasts and a Sertoli cell line as
controls. We found that JQ1 induces DNA damage and stress
response genes, putatively contributing to the induction of cell
death and cell cycle arrest in the GCNIS/seminoma-like cell line
TCam-2 and the EC cell lines NCCIT, NT2/D1 and 2102EP (Fig. 6).
We further demonstrated that tumours from xenografted EC cells
were significantly reduced in size and proliferation rate after JQ1

 application. Also, we found a reduced infiltration of blood vessels
in JQ1-treated tumours (Fig. 6).
Interestingly, EC cell lines show robust down-regulation of
pluripotency genes and up-regulation of differentiation markers, sug-
gesting induction of mesoderm (Fig. 6). There are therapeutic strate-
gies aiming to induce terminal differentiation of tumour cells,
rendering them less aggressive [60]. In this respect, JQ1 not only
induces apoptosis in ECs, but might lead to acquisition of a less
aggressive state. In TCam-2, although down-regulation of some
pluripotency genes was observed, no indications for a differentiation
process were found (except up-regulation of HAND1). This is in line
with previous findings, demonstrating the ability of TCam-2 cells to
counteract differentiation-inducing stimuli [61, 62].
Notably, JQ1 concentrations affecting survival of EC cell lines
(≥100 nM) are comparable to doses killing VCaP prostate cancer or
MCF7 breast cancer cells [11, 63]. In contrast, TCam-2 cells were
able to tolerate doses ≤100 nM up to 4 months and showed first
signs of apoptosis at doses ≥250 nM. Puissant and Lockwood et al.
defined an IC50 >1000 nM as JQ1: resistance [31, 64]. Thus, both
EC and seminoma cells can be described as JQ1 sensitive. However,
EC cells presented as highly sensitive to JQ1 treatment in comparison
with the more resistant seminoma-like cell line TCam-2. It is tempting
to speculate whether drug sensitivity of TGCT cell lines goes in hand
with the ability to differentiate. In line, 2102EP cells, which are nul-
lipotent and thus not prone to differentiate, are also more resistant to
JQ1 than the pluripotent EC cell lines NCCIT and NT2/D1.
In fibroblasts and Sertoli cells, we also observed induction of cell
cycle arrest, but apoptosis was restricted to Sertoli cells. Thus, JQ1
affects the cell cycle of non-transformed cells and the cytotoxicity on
Sertoli cells indicates side effects on the testis microenvironment.
Although previous studies in mice did not report any adverse effects
of JQ1 on cells of the testis epithelium, further in vivo data need to
explore the effects on human testes cells [59, 65, 66].
Finally, we demonstrate that in TGCT cell lines, JQ1 elicits a similar
stress response as the HDAC inhibitor romidepsin, although both
drugs act by a different molecular mechanism (romidepsin: inhibits
HDACs, leads to histone hyperacetylation; JQ1: inhibits BRD proteins,
interferes with reading the histone code) (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the
pro-apoptotic effects of JQ1 can be increased in combination therapy
[19] (this study). We showed that in mice, a less frequent application
of JQ1 + romidepsin reduces tumour burden with same efficacy as
JQ1 alone.
How do these results translate to clinical application? Based on
different sensitivities of seminomas and ECs to JQ1, our results
suggest that JQ1 is a potent treatment option for ECs and at higher
doses also seminomas. While Nettersheim et al. previously demon-
strated that romidepsin serves as a suitable treatment option for
TGCTs in general [19], a combination of JQ1 + romidepsin allows
for lower dosing and a less frequent application regimen. Clinical
trials will reveal, whether the combination of JQ1 + romidepsin is
suitable for treatment of (mixed) TGCTs and is well tolerated by the
subject.
