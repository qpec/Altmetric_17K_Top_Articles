Objective: This study assessed the prevalence and consistency of high values of weight, height, and
BMI considered to be biologically implausible (BIV) using cut points proposed by WHO among 8.8 million
low-income children (13.7 million observations).
Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed among 2- to 4-year-olds who were
examined from 2008 through 2011.
Results: Overall, 2.7% of the body size measurements were classified as BIVs; 95% of these BIVs were
very high. Among the subset of children (3.6 million) examined more than once, most of those who ini-
tially had a high weight or BMI BIV also had a high BIV at the second examination; odds ratios were
>250. Based on several alternative classifications of BIVs, the current cut points likely underestimate the
prevalence of obesity by about 1%.
Conclusions: Many of the extremely high values of body size currently flagged as BIVs are unlikely to be
errors. Increasing the z-score cut points or using a percentage of the maximum values in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, could improve the balance between removing probable errors
and retaining those that are likely correct.

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity has increased by more than 50% among 2-
to 5-year-olds since the early 1970s (1,2). In response to this increase,
a large amount of data on the weight and height of children have
been collected in nonresearch settings, such as schools (3-8) and clin-
ics (9-12). The quality of these measurements can vary substantially,
and investigators must decide how to address the possible validity of
extreme values. These decisions could influence prevalence estimates
(8), secular trends, and comparisons across studies.
Weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) data that are considered
to be biologically implausible (BIV) are flagged in the SAS program
for the 2000 centers for disease control and prevention (CDC)
growth charts (13,14). These BIV cut points were based on sugges-
tions made by a WHO expert committee in the mid-1990s (15) and
have been widely used (3,4,11,12,16-18). Values more extreme than
the WHO cut points were described as “likely to be errors and may
be treated as missing” ((15), p 217). However, no justification was
given for why these values were considered to be implausible, and
the effects of these exclusions on prevalence estimates were not con-
sidered (15).
It is possible that the classification of values as BIVs may resemble
other techniques that have been used to exclude “bad data” but that
have eventually been found to introduce various biases (19-21). This
possibility is supported by our recent analysis of data from Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) (22), which showed that most chil-
dren who had a high BMI BIV also had arm and waist circumferen-
ces � 99th percentile.
The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the performance,
based on repeated measurements of the same child, of the current
cut points for high BIVs, and (2) to examine the effects of alterna-
tive BIV cut points on the estimation of the prevalences of obesity
and severe obesity. We use data from 2- to 4-year-olds in the
CDC’s Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS) from 2008
through 2011 (N � 13.7 million records).

 income children who participated in federally funded maternal and
child health and nutrition programs. PedNSS included almost 50%
of children eligible for federally funded maternal and child health
and nutrition programs, but more than 90% of children participated
in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infant,
and Children (WIC) program.
Eligibility for WIC is based primarily on (1) a current pregnancy or
a child <5 years of age, and (2) a family income that is � 185% of
the federal income-poverty level (http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/
poverty/data/threshld/index.html).
Anthropometric
measurements
were taken by trained staff in state programs according to the CDC
Nutrition Surveillance Program standards; weight was recorded to
the nearest 1/4 pound and height to the nearest 1/8 inch with a
measuring board (23). State agencies assigned a unique ID to each
child.
There were 14.4 million records (observations) in the database from
children who were between 24.0 and 59.9 months of age; many of
these children were examined several times. The initial data clean-
ing excluded (1) 622,000 records that were missing data on weight
or height, (2) 1,357 records that had a value for weight or height of
0 or 999, and (3) 49,000 children for whom the birth date differed
across records. These restrictions resulted in a total of 13,690,110
records from 8,757,576 children. Children under 24 months of age
were excluded from the analysis because both the index of relative
weight and reference population (weight-for-length in the WHO
growth standards) differs from those for older children. No other
data cleaning was performed for the current analyses.
Based on the assigned ID, birth date, and state, we were able to
combine
records
for
individual
children
to
create
a
subset
(N 5 3,629,026) of children who were examined multiple times.
(After this matching, it was found that the sex of 7,367 (0.2%) chil-
dren differed across examinations, and we excluded these children
from the longitudinal analyses.) We focus on the first and second
examinations for children who had multiple examinations, with the
initial examination occurring at 34 6 8 months of age and the subse-
quent examination at 45 6 8 months. Because our focus is on
extremely high values of weight, height, and BMI, children who had
a low BIV (N 5 17,737, 0.5%) at either examination were excluded
from these analyses.
Calculation of z-scores in the CDC growth charts
BMI (kg/m2) was calculated as weight divided by height2. Weight,
height, and BMI z-scores and percentiles were calculated using the
CDC 2000 Growth Charts which are based on data collected from
1963-1965 to 1988-1994 (13). Obesity is defined as a BMI � 95th
percentile (13), and severe obesity as a BMI � 120% of the 95th
percentile (24).
Although most z-scores calculated in the CDC growth charts agree
well with the empirical percentiles, estimates in the upper tails can
be problematic (24-26). Therefore, a modified approach was used to
identify extreme values in the SAS program for the CDC growth
charts, with a child’s “modified z-score” based on 1=
2 of the distance
between 0 and 2 z-scores (25).
For example, a 49-month-old girl in the current analyses had a BMI
of 28.2 kg/m2. Based on the sex- and age-specific values of L (Box-
Cox power transformation, 23.07), M (mean, 15.28), and S (coeffi-
cient of variation, 0.079) in the CDC growth charts, her BMI-for-
age z-score would be 3.5 [(28.2/M)L 2 1]/(L�S) (27,28). However,
because half of the distance between 0 and 2 z-scores for this child
is 1.84 kg/m2, her modified z-score would be (28.2 2 15.28)/
1.84 5 7.0. (Because the BMI value at any z-score can be calculated
as M�[(1 1 L�S�Z)(1/L)], a z-score of 2 would be 18.96 kg/m2, and
half of the distance between the BMI values at 0 and 2 z-scores is
1.84.) These modified z-scores extrapolate the SD distance based on
nonextreme (absolute z-score of � 2) values to more extreme values.
We refer to these modified z-scores as weightMZ, heightMZ, and
BMIMZ or as a z-scoreM. The following extreme values are flagged
as BIVs in the CDC SAS program (14):
weightMZ :< 25 or > 15
heightMZ : < 25 or > 13
BMIMZ : < 24 or > 15
We consider body size measures below these cut points to be a low
BIV and values above the cut points to be high BIVs. The focus in
this study is on high BIVs. These modified z-scores are used only
for BIVs and not for the definitions of obesity and severe obesity.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were performed in R (29). We examined the z-score distri-
butions using quantile–quantile (QQ) plots (http://onlinestatbook.
com/2/advanced_graphs/q-q_plots.html), in which the ordered quan-
tiles (observed z-scores) were plotted versus the expected quantiles
from a normal distribution.
In the longitudinal cohort, we assessed the cross-classification high
BIVs at baseline and follow-up. If high BIVs were data entry errors,
one would expect that the probability of having a high BIV at the
second examination would not be influenced by the child’s values at
the first examination. Associations between BIVs at the initial and
subsequent examinations were summarized using odds ratios (OR)
and positive likelihood ratios.
To assess the effects of BIVs on the estimated prevalence of obesity
and severe obesity, we used several alternative cut points for
extremely high values, including weight and BMI z-scoreM of 18
and 115 (and height z-scoreM of 14 or 15). These cut points were
based on an examination of the proportion of children in each 1-unit
z-score category that had a high BIV at the second examination and
on our previous analyses of NHANES 1999-2000 through 2011-
2012 data (22).
Results
Descriptive characteristics of the children are shown in Table 1.
(The 13.7 million observations in Table 1 are from 8.8 million
children.) Overall, 40% were Hispanic, 33% were non-Hispanic
(NH) white, 19% were NH black, and 4% were classified in other
categories or were missing information. The prevalence of obesity
ranged from 12% (NH whites and blacks) to 20% (American Indi-
ans), while the prevalence of severe obesity varied from 0.9% to
1.6%. Overall, 2.7% of examination records had a body size

 measure that was considered to be biologically implausible, and
95% of these records had a high BIV. Of the 357,000 high BIV
records, 28% had a high weight, 48% had a high height, and 52%
had a high BMI. Of the 185,000 children who had a high BMIMZ,
43% also had a high weightMZ and 6% had a high heightMZ.
Although prevalences of high BIVs for weight and BMI were high-
est among Hispanics and American Indians, and were higher
among boys than girls, black children had the highest prevalence
of high height BIVs.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the modified z-scores for weight
(top panel), height, and BMI (right panel) for a random sample of
100,000 observations. Whereas a QQ plot of a normal distribution
would be a diagonal line, the body size measures had very heavy
tails. As assessed by estimates of skewness and kurtosis for each
variable, the distribution of height was closest to that of a normal
distribution, while BMI had the heaviest tails; 0.25% of the children
had a BMIMZ � 50. Based on an inspection of the weight and height
values of these very high z-scores, in many cases it appeared that
(1) a decimal had been misplaced or (2) weight and height values
had been interchanged.
We then focused on the 3.6 million children who were examined
twice between the ages of 24 and 59 months. Table 2 shows the per-
centages of children in various baseline categories of weightMZ,
heightMZ, or BMIMZ who had a high BIV at follow-up; for each
measure, the upper range of plausible values based on the current
cut points is bolded. For example, of the 1.4 million children who
had a baseline weightMZ below 0 (left column, first row), only 0.1%
had a follow-up weightMZ >5. In contrast, more than 50% of chil-
dren in each baseline weightMZ category between 6.0 and 14.9 had a
high weight BIV at follow-up. At higher levels of weightMZ, how-
ever, the prevalence of high follow-up BIVs decreased, suggesting
that many of the weightMZ values >15 were errors.
The prevalences of a high height BIV (middle columns) at follow-
up were lower than those for a high weightMZ, but children with an
initial heightMZ of 4.0 to 5.9 were about 5 times more likely to sub-
sequently have a high BIV than were children with an initial z-score
of 2 to 2.9. The right columns of Table 2 focus on BMIMZ levels.
Whereas 30% of the 28,000 children who had an initial BMIMZ of
4.0 to 4.9 had a high BMI BIV at follow-up, prevalences were
>60% for initial values between 6.0 and 14.9. The prevalence of a
high BMI BIV at follow-up, however, was only 8% among children
who had initial BMIMZ >25.
Table 3 shows levels of BMI, weight and height, for 20 randomly
selected children in a longitudinal subset who had an initial BMIMZ
between 12.5 and 14.9. (This range was selected because it was the
highest BMIMZ category in Table 2 in which the positive predictive
value was >50%). The first 12 children had a BMIMZ > 10 at
follow-up, and 5 children had a follow-up z-score that was larger
than the initial z-score. The last 5 children had follow-up values of
BMIMZ that were fairly close to 0, suggesting that either the initial
or follow-up measurement was an error (or that records were incor-
rectly matched).
Table 4 shows additional information on the cross-classification of
initial and follow-up BIVs. The cross-classification of high BMI
BIVs at the 2 examinations (bottom rows), for example, resulted in
an OR of 254, a positive predictive value of 64%, and a positive
likelihood ratio of 132. In general, the specificities, ORs, and posi-
tive likelihood ratios were very high, but the sensitivities were only
moderate (21% to 43%). Overall, the ORs for the weight and BMI

aCurrent guidelines consider the upper cut points of valid body size measures to be modified z-scores < 5 (weight and BMI) and < 3 (height). Values above these ranges
are considered to be high BIVs. For each body size measure, the upper range of plausible values based on the current cut points is bolded. Children with a low BIV have
been excluded from all analyses.
bValues represent Ns at the 1st examination and percent of these children who had a high BIV at the 2nd examination.
Figure 1 QQ plots of modified z-scores for weight (left), height, and BMI (right) among 100,000 randomly selected chil-
dren in PedNSS. The horizontal lines represent the cut points for values currently considered to be a high BIV (15 for
weight and BMI; 13 for height) or a low BIV (25 for weight and height; 24 for BMI). Modified z-scores below 26 were
recoded to 26 and values >25 were recoded to 25 to focus on the regions of interest. If the data were normally dis-
tributed, all points would fall on a diagonal line. In contrast, all body size measures had heavy tails at both ends of the
distribution. Even within the range of values currently considered to be plausible, the distributions of weight and BMI
were more skewed and kurtotic than a normal distribution.

 and BMI) and 14 (height) increased the prevalence of both obesity
and severe obesity by 0.9% based on the inclusion of 228,000 addi-
tional records. In contrast, if the upper cut points were either (1)
increased to z-scores of 115 (weight and BMI) and 1 5 height (third
set of columns) or (2) based on the age-specific maximum values
observed in NHANES (1999-2000 through 2011-2012), slightly
more children were added the analysis, but the prevalence estimates
varied by only 0.1% to 0.2% between these 3 classifications.
Analyses stratified by sex and race-ethnicity indicated that, in gen-
eral, the prevalence increases with higher cut points were larger
among boys (11.1% for both obesity and severe obesity for z-scores
of 18 and 14) than among girls (about 0.7%), and that the
increases were largest among Hispanic and American Indian/Alas-
kan Native boys. Among Hispanic boys, increasing the z-score cut
points to 18 (BMI and weight) and 14 (height) increased the preva-
lence of severe obesity from 1.3% to 2.9%. Furthermore, the preva-
lence of severe obesity was higher among girls than among boys
(1.4% vs. 0.9%) based on the current BIV cut points, but the preva-
lences were almost identical among boys and girls using any of the
expanded cut points. This reflects the higher prevalence of high
BMI BIVs (based on the current cut points) among boys than among
girls (1.6% vs. 1.1%).
Discussion
Our results indicate that among 2- to 4-year-olds in PedNSS, many of
the high values of weight, height, and BMI considered to be biologi-
cally implausible are unlikely to be errors. Of the 13.7 million obser-
vations in the current analyses, 2.6% had a high BIV based on the
1995 WHO cut points (14,15). Based on the longitudinal relation of
levels of these body size measures among 3.6 million children, there
were very strong associations between high BIVs at 2 examinations
for BMI, weight, and height. As compared with the estimated preva-
lences based on the current WHO cut points, increasing the BIV cut
points, either through the use of higher z-scores or by using the age-
specific NHANES maximums for weight, height, and BMI, increased
the prevalence of both obesity and severe obesity by about 1%.
The classification of BIVs in anthropometry was addressed in a 1995
WHO report (15) which recommended that z-scores > 5 (weight and
weight-for-height) and> 3 (height) be treated as improbable and
coded as missing. Although little justification was given for these spe-
cific values, it was stated that they were the “exclusion criteria for
anthropometric values that are most likely to represent errors” ((15),
p 218). These values may have been selected, in part, based on the
low probability of values this extreme in a normal [N(0,1)] distribu-
tion. However, in both the current study and in NHANES (22), the
BMI and weight distributions had very heavy right tails. Among 2- to
5-year-olds in NHANES (22), for example, the prevalence of a high
BMI BIV (0.4%) was about 12,000 times than that of a normally dis-
tributed variable. The higher prevalence (2.6%) in the current study
may, in part, be due to the higher prevalence of obesity among chil-
dren in PedNSS and a larger number of coding errors. In general, the
race-ethnicity and sex differences in the prevalence of high BMI
BIVs paralleled differences in the prevalence of obesity.
The CDC SAS program to calculate BMI z-scores and percentiles
(14), which has been widely used (3,4,11,12,16,17), flags values
considered to be implausible based on the 1995 WHO cut points.
Previous investigators have noted that these cut points can result in
a large number of extremely high values (16,30) being classified as
BIVs even though many are unlikely to be errors. We have previ-
ously shown (22) that most children in NHANES with a high BMI
BIV had arm and waist circumferences that were > 99th percentile.
The longitudinal analyses in the current study provide further evi-
dence that many of these high BIVs are unlikely to be data errors.
The concept of implausible values in other areas has also been ques-
tioned (31).
In addition to expanding the range of plausible values, based on z-
scores or NHANES maximum values as in the current study, other
approaches, such as the use of studentized residuals (22), may be
useful. For example, rather than assessing the implausibility of
BMIs without considering other data, an examination of regression
residuals would allow one to assess whether a BMI is unusual given
the child’s sex, age, waist circumference, or other values (22,32). In
addition, some investigators (33-35) have suggested that values that
are considered to be unlikely be set to missing and then estimated
using multiple imputation techniques (36). These methods, however,
would require additional measurements that may not be available.
Although we did not focus on low BIVs, it is likely that many of
these very low values were errors. The prevalence of low BIVs in
the current study was 0.7% whereas only 2 of 5,919 2- to 5-year-
olds in NHANES 1999-2012 had a low BIV (22). This may be, in
part, due to the relatively high number of high height BIVs that
result in very low BMIs. In addition, longitudinal analyses in the
current study also indicated (data not shown) that only 7% of the
children who had a low weight BIV at the initial examination had a
low weight BIV at a subsequent examination, suggesting that most
of these low BIVs were errors. Of the �90,000 records in the cur-
rent study that had a low BIV, 28,000 had a height < 40 cm and
6,200 had a weight < 5 kg. These values are less than 50% of the
age-specific minimums in NHANES 1999-2012 and are almost cer-
tainly errors.
Although the current cut points for BIVs may incorrectly flag many
of the extremely high values as implausible, the optimal solution
may depend upon the analysis and the data set. For data that have
been very carefully recorded and cleaned, such as NHANES, it is
likely that very few, if any, BIVs are errors. Although there is a
trade-off between including extremely high values that are correct
and excluding those that are errors, our results suggest that even in
data that have not been collected and managed as carefully, many of
the values that are currently considered to be “implausible” are
unlikely to be errors. However, in the estimation of obesity and
severe obesity prevalences, the choice of the upper cut point for an
expanded range makes relatively little difference (Table 5) because
most values that are currently considered to be implausible tend to
cluster near the upper WHO cut points. Changing the z-score cut
points from 18 to 115, for example, results in relatively few addi-
tional children being included in a calculation.
Several limitations of our analyses should be considered. Although
it is likely that many of the high BIVs that we observed were likely
to be correct, this may not be true in all data sets. It should also be
realized that data errors can occur throughout the entire distribution
(32), and our analyses do not address this aspect of data cleaning.
(These “inliers” could be detected by an examination of studentized

 residuals.) It is possible, however, that the magnitude of the longitu-
dinal association between extremely high values of the body size
measures across the 2 examinations is even stronger that what we
observed due to (1) mistakes in the matching process used to con-
struct the cohort and (2) regression to the mean (37). The latter
would result in follow-up values that would be expected to be less
extreme than the initial value. Although we think it unlikely, it is
also possible that a high BIV at both examinations could represent
either a measurement or transcription error at both examinations.
Our results indicate that simply deleting data based on the current
BIV guidelines excludes a large number of high values that are
likely to be correct. Although the current BIV cut points could be
substantially expanded, other data from the child, such as circumfer-
ences, could also be used to assess the validity of high BIVs. As
compared with the WHO cut points, the use of higher BIV cut
points would provide a better balance between excluding extremely
high values that are likely to be errors and retaining those that are
likely to be correct.O
