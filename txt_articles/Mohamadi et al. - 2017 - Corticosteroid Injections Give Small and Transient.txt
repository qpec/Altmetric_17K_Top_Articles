Abstract
Background
The ability of injection of corticosteroids
into the subacromial space to relieve pain ascribed to
rotator cuff tendinosis is debated. The number of patients
who have an injection before one gets relief beyond what a
placebo provides is uncertain.
Questions/purposes
We asked: (1) Do corticosteroid
injections reduce pain in patients with rotator cuff tendi-
nosis 3 months after injection, and if so, what is the number
needed to treat (NNT)? (2) Are multiple injections better
than one single injection with respect to pain reduction at 3
months?
Methods
We systematically searched seven electronic
databases for randomized controlled trials of corticosteroid
injection for rotator cuff tendinosis compared with a pla-
cebo injection. Eligible studies had at least 10 adults and
used pain intensity as an outcome measure. The Hedges’s g
as adjusted pooled standardized mean difference (SMD)
(which expresses the size of the intervention effect in each
study relative to the total variability observed among
pooled studies) and NNT were calculated at assessment
points less than 1 month, 1–2 months, and 2–3 months. The
protocol of this study was registered at the international
prospective register of systematic reviews. Eleven studies
of 726 patients satisfied our criteria for data pooling. Three
studies containing 292 patients used repeat injections. A
random effects model was used owing to substantial
heterogeneity among studies. The funnel plot indicated the
possibility of some missing studies, but Orwin’s fail-safe N
and Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill suggested that
missing studies would not significantly affect the results.
Results
Corticosteroid injection did not reduce pain
intensity in adult patients with rotator cuff tendinosis more
than a placebo injection at the 3-month assessment. A
small transient pain relief occurred at the assessment
between 4 and 8 weeks with a SMD of 0.52 (range, 0.27–
0.78) (p \ 0.001). At least five patients must be treated for
one patient’s pain to be transiently reduced to no more than
mild. Multiple injections were not found to be more
effective than a single injection at any time.

 Conclusions
Corticosteroid injections provide—at best—
minimal transient pain relief in a small number of patients
with rotator cuff tendinosis and cannot modify the natural
course of the disease. Given the discomfort, cost, and
potential to accelerate tendon degeneration associated with
corticosteroids, they have limited appeal. Their wide use
may be attributable to habit, underappreciation of the pla-
cebo effect, incentive to satisfy rather than discuss a
patient’s drive toward physical intervention, or for remu-
neration, rather than their utility.

Level I, therapeutic study.
Introduction
Rotator cuff tendinosis—the chronic degeneration of a
tendon without inflammation—is an expected part of
human aging and the most common cause of shoulder pain
[12]. Tendinosis encompasses many commonly used terms
including ‘‘impingement,’’ ‘‘rotator cuff fraying,’’ ‘‘partial
thickness tears,’’ and ‘‘tendinitis.’’ Often, tendinosis is
asymptomatic, but in cases of symptomatic tendinosis, a
corticosteroid injection into the subacromial space is a
palliative treatment option [36]. The reasons for wide use
of corticosteroid injections for rotator cuff tendinopathy
may include training or habit, to satisfy the patient’s desire
to intervene, for remuneration, and other factors, but it is
not clear that corticosteroid injections outperform placebo
injections. The effectiveness of corticosteroid injections for
pain relief in patients with rotator cuff tendinosis is debated
despite numerous prospective randomized trials and sev-
eral systematic reviews [5, 15, 24, 25, 27, 36, 50]. The first
four systematic reviews regarding this topic did not con-
duct a meta-analysis [5, 24, 32, 50]. The results of two
meta-analyses [15, 24] reached different conclusions.
Since the last systematic review in 2010 by Coombes
et al. [15], there are four new prospective randomized
controlled trials of corticosteroid injections for rotator cuff
tendinosis [31, 37, 44, 45]. Furthermore, previous sys-
tematic reviews characterized the effect size with pooled
standardized mean difference (SMD) alone and categorized
the SMD values, both of which provide information of
limited use to clinicians and patients [13, 16, 34].
The number needed to treat (NNT; the number of
patients who have an injection before one gets relief
beyond what a placebo provides) is a better measure of
treatment effectiveness and remains uncertain for corti-
costeroid
injections
for
rotator
cuff
tendinosis.
For
dichotomous outcomes, it is calculated as the inverse of the
difference between the event rate in the experimental group
(experimental event rate) and event rate in the control
group (control event rate [CER]). We calculated the NNT
as the number of patients who need to have an injection for
one patient to experience a decrease in their VAS to 3.4 or
lower.
Our specific study questions were: (1) Do corticosteroid
injections
reduce
pain in
patients
with rotator
cuff
tendinopathy during the 3-month evaluation, and if so,
what is the NNT? (2) Are multiple injections better than
one single injection with respect to pain reduction during
the 3-month evaluation?
Material and Methods
In accordance with the published guidelines of the Cochrane
Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement
(Appendix 1. Supplemental materials are available with the
online version of CORR1.), this meta-analysis was designed
to compare the pooled SMD of VAS pain in adult patients
with rotator cuff tendinosis treated with a local corticosteroid
injection versus placebo injection. We considered the fol-
lowing
descriptors
as
tendinosis:
‘‘impingement,’’
‘‘tendinitis,’’ and ‘‘tendinopathy’’ (Appendix 2. Supple-
mental materials are available with the online version of
CORR1.). The protocol of the study was registered before
the data collection and is accessible at the international
prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO
2015:CRD42015025964) [40].
Studies were eligible if there was (1) a randomized
controlled trial of corticosteroid injection treatment for
rotator cuff tendinosis compared with a placebo injection
(either normal saline or local anesthetic); (2) at least 10
adults were included in the trial; (3) a full-text article was
available; (4) a VAS for pain was used as an outcome
measure; and (5) patients were evaluated at least 1 week
after injection. A study was excluded if the article was not
an original study. Animal studies were excluded.
On August 20, 2015, we searched EMBASE1, PubMed
Publisher, MEDLINE Ovid1SP, CINAHL (EBSCO), Web
of ScienceTM, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central using
the search strategy described in the Appendix 2. References
of relevant articles were checked for additional articles and
all bibliographies of the included articles were hand-sear-
ched to identify further relevant literature. Moreover, emails
were sent to the corresponding authors of included studies to
seek and confirm any other published or unpublished data.
Two investigators (AM, JJC) screened studies indepen-
dently for eligibility. Studies that had at least one outcome
as a VAS pain score were included. After removal of
duplicates, we identified 5442 studies, of which 82 were
potentially eligible based on their title and abstract (Fig. 1).
We also found five more studies using additional data

 sources: one by contacting authors and four from previous
systematic reviews [15, 17]. After review of full text, 72
articles did not fulfill the inclusion criteria.
Fourteen randomized controlled trials met inclusion cri-
teria

review
(Table 1)
(Appendix
3.
Supplemental materials are available with the online version
of CORR1.) [1–4, 8, 32, 37, 38, 44–47, 51, 52]. We excluded
three studies from the meta-analysis owing to a Jadad score
below
three,
leaving
11
studies
for
meta-analysis
[1–4, 32, 38, 44–47, 51]. The average sample size of these
studies was 63 patients (range, 25–107), with an average age
of the patients of 54 years (range, 48–58 years). Two studies
used saline as a placebo [47, 52] and 11 used lidocaine.
Triamcinolone was used in seven trials [1, 8, 32, 37, 44–46]
(most commonly a single 40-mg dose; range, 10–80 mg).
Methylprednisolone was used in six trials, most commonly a
40-mg dose (range, 25–80 mg) [2, 4, 38, 47, 51, 52]. In one
trial, patients received a 6 mg injection of betamethasone [3].
Two of the four studies [3, 4, 8, 44] that assessed patients for
longer than 3 months found a reduction in pain with corti-
costeroid injection [4, 8].
We developed a data extraction sheet based on the
Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group’s
data extraction template. Two independent reviewers (AM,
JJC) extracted data and coded them in the predetermined
data sheet. The following data were extracted: journal
name, first author, year of publication, study design,
country in which the study was performed, number of
included patients, percentage of male participants, mean
age, duration of followup (months), patients lost to fol-
lowup (eg, withdrawn, dropout), type of clinical outcome,
mean VAS of pain, and SD. We did not try to obtain raw
data or confirm synthesized data from investigators of the
included studies.

 We analyzed pain intensity the first, second, and third
months after injection. The first month was defined as less
than 4 weeks, the second month was between 4 and 8
weeks, and the third month was between 8 and 12 weeks.
Two collaborators (AM, JJC) independently appraised
the included studies using The Cochrane Collaboration’s
tool for assessing risk of bias. For meta-analyses, the
methodologic quality of the studies was graded based on
the Jadad scale for randomized controlled trials [33]. A
quality score of 3 or greater is considered high quality.
Only high-quality trials were included in this meta-analy-
sis. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between
the two collaborators (AM, JJC) to reach final consensus.
Statistical Analysis
We used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2.2064
(Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA) software to perform the
meta-analysis. The mean VAS, SD before and after the
corticosteroid injection, and the number of patients in the
intervention and control groups were used to calculate the
Hedges’s g for each study. The Hedges’s g, an adjusted
SMD, is a measure of effect size for studies with contin-
uous outcome. It indicates the size of the intervention
effect in each study relative to the variability observed
among studies by difference of means in study groups
divided by the pooled SD. If data were presented in 95%
CIs, the SD is calculated with the following formula:
SD = 95% CI/1.96 9 Hn. When the median and range
were reported for continuous outcomes, the mean and SD
were estimated by assuming that the mean is equivalent to
the median and that the SD is a quarter of the range. If no
SD was given, the SD was estimated as 1
.
2 of the mean
value. Hedges’s g also can be calculated with the propor-
tion of ‘‘cured’’ or ‘‘improved ‘‘patients in each study arm
or with the mean difference correspondent p values before
and after a corticosteroid injection.
To assess publication bias, a funnel plot was drawn
(Fig. 2). Visual assessment of the funnel plot indicated a
possibility of missing studies on the left side of the funnel
plot. However, fail-safe N [48] showed 82 missing studies
are needed to change the results and Orwin’s fail-safe N
[42] showed at least nine missing studies are needed to
bring the Hedges’s g below the trivial value. To address
heterogeneity among individual included studies, we
calculated Cochran’s Q statistic. A p value of 0.10 or less
was set to determine statistical significance [18]. Because
of concerns regarding the power of the Q statistic, the I2
statistic was reported [18]. I2 values are classified to
represent low (0%–25%), moderate (25%–50%), sub-
stantial
(50%–75%),
or
considerable
(
[
75%)
inconsistency [30].

 There was substantial heterogeneity among the clinical
trials, which was not explained in sensitivity analysis by
year of publication, quality assessment (Jadad scale), type
of placebo, or multiple versus single injection, therefore we
used a random effects model for meta-analysis. This sug-
gests a notable potential for bias.
We calculated Hedges’s g, which is the bias-adjusted
estimate of the SMD for each study. Hedges’s g is an
effect size estimator for continuous outcomes and is
calculated by dividing the mean difference by the pooled
SD [29]. We report the Hedges’s g with its 95% CI (by
study size and SD) for individual studies and the pooled
SMD, 95% CI, and standardized error. We report study
outcome using pooled SMD (Hedges’s g) and standard-
ized error. The studies had substantial heterogeneity with
an I2 value of 60%–67% in different assessment points,
and therefore, a random effect modeling was used for
meta-analysis. The SMD is considered to represent trivial
(
\ 0.20), small (0.20–0.49), medium (0.50–0.79), or
large (
[ 0.80) effect [13]. Despite this classification,
some clinicians find SMD difficult to interpret in clinical
practice. NNT was calculated using the approach intro-
duced by Furukawa [21].
Furukawa’s method requires determination of a CER
[22]. We used a cutoff for VAS pain of 3.4 or less (as
described by Boonstra et al. [9] to represent mild muscu-
loskeletal pain) to estimate the probability of a favorable
event in the placebo group. We estimated the probability of
a favorable event, the approximated CER, as the cumula-
tive probability of VAS scores of patients to be below the
cutoff of 3.4 assuming a normal distribution for VAS [16].
The CER was approximated by using the cumulative dis-
tribution function of the cutoff value using the pooled mean
and SD of the VAS scores [6, 39]. For this purpose, we
pooled data from four studies that used the same outcome
scale and assessment methods and for which a data
approximation was not needed [2, 3, 32, 51].
/ ¼ C � lpooled
dpooled
where U or CDF = probability of an event; l = pooled
mean; d = pooled SD; and C = predetermined cutoff
value.
Two-tailed alpha values of 0.05 or less along with
nonoverlapping 95% CIs were considered statistically
significant.
We also compared the effect of repeated injections of
corticosteroids versus a single corticosteroid injection with
a common comparator of a placebo injection. Three studies
used repeated injections [44, 45, 47]. Richardson [47]
administered two injections of prednisolone acetate, one at
the first visit and the second 2 weeks later. Assessments
occurred at the second and sixth weeks after initial injec-
tion. Neither assessment showed a significant difference. In
two other studies, repeated injections were performed at the
third and sixth weeks after the first injection [44, 45]. The
mean pain score in the corticosteroid injection group was
less than that of the placebo group only at the 6-week
assessment (p = 0.0060) [44]. In the third study, there was
a linear trend in decreasing mean VAS pain score from 5.8
to 2.7 after three injections. A similar trend was seen in the
placebo group and because the time interaction is not
shown, the pain reduction cannot be attributed solely to the
corticosteroid injection [45].
To perform a multiple-treatments meta-analysis, we
used subgroup analysis and then tested for subgroup dif-
ferences [10].
Results
A corticosteroid injection did not reduce pain in adult
patients with rotator cuff tendinosis more than a placebo
injection during the third-month assessment. On average,

 adult patients with rotator cuff tendinosis receiving a cor-
ticosteroid injection experienced slight and transient pain
relief more than a placebo injection at assessment times
less than 2 months (Fig. 3). The pooled mean of the VAS
pain in the control group was 5.2 (pooled SD, 0.5) before
injection, 5.1 (pooled SD, 0.2) at the 1-month assessment,
3.9 (pooled SD, 1.2) at the 2-month assessment, and 3.8
(pooled SD, 1.4) at the 3-month assessment. We could not
calculate an NNT at the 1-month assessment because the
chance of having a VAS pain score less than 3.4 (our
previously noted definition of mild pain [9]) was less than 1
in 1000 during this assessment time. In addition, the NNT
was not calculated for assessment during the third month
given that there is no difference between corticosteroid and
placebo injections. The largest effect size for corticosteroid
injections occurred at the assessment between 4 and 8
weeks with a Hedges’s g of 0.52 (0.27–0. 78) and NNT of
4.9 (3.3–9.5) (Table 2).
The pooled SMD of single and multiple corticosteroid
injections
was
0.44
in
the
first
month
assessment
(p = 0.992). In the second month assessment, the pooled
SMD of single corticosteroid injection was 0.51 whereas
that of repeated injections was 0.54 (p = 0.918). In the
third month assessment, the pooled SMD was 0.28 for
single corticosteroid injection and 0.14 for repeated injec-
tions (p = 0.683) (Table 3).
Discussion
A corticosteroid injection into the subacromial space is a
widely used palliative treatment for rotator cuff tendinosis.
There are no known disease-modifying treatments. The
ability of a corticosteroid injection to relieve symptoms
ascribed to rotator cuff tendinosis is debated, with prior
meta-analyses reaching different conclusions [15, 24, 27].
We performed a meta-analysis including several new
prospective randomized controlled trials comparing corti-
costeroid and placebo injections [31, 37, 45], and using the
Furukawa method [21] of calculating the NNT for a reduc-
tion in pain intensity to mild or less. We found no differences
3 months after injection. Patients in the corticosteroid
injection group reported, on average, a small transient pain
relief in comparison to patients receiving a placebo injection
at assessment times less than 2 months. For every five
patients treated with a corticosteroid injection, one will
experience a slight, transient reduction of symptoms to mild
pain. Pain did not improve with additional injections.
This review should be interpreted in light of its limita-
tions. First, the severity of the tendinosis or duration of
pain may have varied among studies (Table 1) [28, 41, 43].
Tendinosis can include a large spectrum of disorders and
we have limited insight into practice patterns of the centers
that produced each study. For example, some practices are
more aggressive, with surgical intervention for patients
with ‘‘high-grade partial tears,’’ whereas some practices
may opt to treat these patients with injections. If these
high-grade partial tears were included in some studies, and
corticosteroid injections are not efficacious in addressing

 high-grade partial tears, it may skew the results of those
studies negatively. Conversely, if patients with minimal
symptoms or populations who are particularly prone to
placebo response are included, this may skew results pos-
itively. Second, the studies enrolled patients with different
prior or concurrent treatments. The results might be dif-
ferent for patients with more-selected indications, such as
patients who are not satisfied with rotator cuff-strength-
ening exercises. It is possible that using corticosteroid
injections as a second- or third-line treatment might
decrease the NNT. However, it is also possible that the
NNT would increase because this approach would remove
patients predisposed to respond to any type of treatment
(placebo responders). Third, the enrolled patients in the
clinical trials seem to be younger than the patients with
shoulder pain seen in a population-based study [49]. This
may affect the generalizability of the findings. Fourth, pain
relief in our study was measured based on the average VAS
before and after intervention, and because we did not have
the dataset of each clinical trial we could not calculate how
many of these patients actually experienced a minimally
clinical important difference (MCID) from their baseline
pain. Despite that the MCID depends on the condition type,
the severity, sex, and age, to our knowledge, the MCID of
the VAS has not been studied for upper extremity prob-
lems. In musculoskeletal problems, however, the MCID
has been shown to vary from 9 mm in low back pain to 37
mm in knee osteoarthritis [35]. Given that the MCID
should be applied to changes in individual subjects, not to
group changes, we were unable to determine how many of
patients in the reviewed trials experienced a meaningful
difference in their pain. In other words, although we found
some transient pain relief after corticosteroid injections,
these differences were small and in most or all cases, un-
likely to be meaningful to patients [19]; however, we used
a clinical threshold to define mild pain [9] and estimated
the NNT of patients having no more than mild pain using
the proportion of patients in the placebo and corticosteroid
groups before injection and at each assessment time. This
is particularly important because musculoskeletal pain
tends to decline with time even without treatment and other
approaches for NNT estimation do not take this into
account [16]. Fifth, there was substantial heterogeneity in
the studies that could not be explained by year of publi-
cation, type of placebo, quality assessment of studies, or
repeated versus single injection. We used a random-effects
model for meta-analysis, but this does not entirely account
for the heterogeneity. Each reader can decide for him- or
herself, but the positive results seen at short intervals
(Fig. 3) seem to be driven by a small number of studies,
with the study of Hong et al. [32] being a particular outlier.
Although their study met our criteria for control of bias, if
there were problems with their trial that cannot be detected
from its publication, and we became aware of those
problems and excluded it, we likely would see no benefit of
corticosteroids. Sixth, we had to estimate the mean based
on the figures and charts in some studies, the SD was not
consistently reported, and we made calculations using
some
assumptions
for
some
studies.
However,
two
reviewers separately performed data synthesis to maximize
reproducibility of the study. We used only four studies
(ones with the same pain scale and sufficient data)
[2, 3, 32, 51] to calculate the CER because the CER is
crucial for NNT calculations. Seventh, despite that we did
not limit our search to language or year of publication,
there is a possibility of publication bias in the systematic
review. This potentially could lead to overestimation of the
results. However, further analysis showed it is unlikely that
unpublished studies would change our results significantly.
Eighth, we know little about the effect of a corticosteroid
injection after 3 months because only four studies evalu-
ated patients for more than 3 months. Ninth, the clinical
trials were too small to provide information regarding
safety. We know that corticosteroids are catabolic and
likely to accelerate tendon degeneration [17]. Finally, there
were insufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis for
functional outcomes such as ROM or patient-reported
outcome measures such as the DASH score.
We found that patients receiving corticosteroids had, on
average, slight transient pain relief more than with placebo
injection during first 2 months. This might be explained by
our larger cohort compared with earlier meta-analyses, or
by the inclusion of one new study with an exceptionally
positive effect [32]. Numerous reviews have addressed the
clinical
effectiveness
of
corticosteroid
injections
for
shoulder pain [7, 11, 15, 23–26, 35, 49, 54]. However, only
a few studies pooled data [7, 11, 15, 24]. Coombes et al.
[15] pooled the data from three studies and reported an
unclear pain relief and shoulder function with corticos-
teroid injection. Gaujoux-Viala et al. [24] found a medium
to large effect for corticosteroid injections for tendinopathy
2 months or less after injection. However, they used a
mixed comparator in data pooling, and their injection sites
included the elbow. Arroll and Goodyear-Smith [7]
reported an NNT of 3.3 from pooled data of five studies
addressing corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain in
general. In their study, NNT was calculated by defining a
‘‘response’’ for the included trials using various outcomes
and diverse definitions. An early Cochrane systematic
review [11] pooled data at the fourth-week assessment
from two studies with subacromial corticosteroid injection
and found a small improvement in pain intensity and active
ROM.
We found that additional corticosteroid injections did
not result in lower pain intensity compared with one
injection. The effect of a single corticosteroid injection

 versus multiple injections of corticosteroid for shoulder
tendinosis has not been compared directly in a single trial,
to our knowledge. In one trial [32], 20- or 40-mg triam-
cinolone acetonide injection yielded similar pain reduction
and functional improvement at all assessments shorter than
2 months for the periarticular disorders of the shoulder.
Similarly, higher doses of intraarticular corticosteroid did
not significantly improve pain or functional outcome in
adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder [53]. In a trial of
patients with elbow enthesopathy, an average of four cor-
ticosteroid injections had a poorer long-term pain reduction
than a single injection [15]. In tendinopathies, neuropep-
tides, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and substance P are
found to increase, so perhaps corticosteroid effects are
mediated primarily by analgesic pathways [14, 20]. In light
of this, there may be a threshold where the analgesic effects
are outweighed by the deleterious effects of corticosteroids
on the tendon tissue, which include collagen disorganiza-
tion, decreased mechanical properties of tendon, and long-
term harm to tendon tissue and cells [17]. The relationship
of injection dosage to clinical benefit or harm is not well
understood, and this uncertainty warrants further study.
Until this is clarified, multiple steroid injections should be
administered judiciously.
The appeal of corticosteroid injections for rotator cuff
tendinopathy seems limited. From the patient’s perspective
they are painful and only one in five will experience a
transient decrease in their pain to mild or less. That is a
very limited and short-term plan for a long-term problem,
and the benefit may be illusory if the outlier studies were
biased. Corticosteroids potentially could be harmful to the
tendon. The resource utilization (office time, procedure
charge, materials) seems difficult to justify. Many patients
probably would not invest hope in this if they were paying
for it themselves. As it stands they are widely used,
probably to satisfy the desire for a ‘‘quick fix’’ or at least to
take some action; to satisfy a passive and magical attitude
toward health; out of habit or training; owing to inadequate
accounting for the placebo effect; or for remuneration. The
wide variation in treatment recommendations between
physicians suggests that patients may not be getting com-
plete, balanced, dispassionate information regarding their
treatment options. A focus for future study would be the
degree to which providing patients such information—
perhaps in the form of a decision aid—might decrease the
rate of corticosteroid injections and whether that would
affect pain intensity and limitations in the short or long
term. It is possible that the corticosteroid injection is hin-
dering
or
delaying
more-effective
management
strategies—effective coping strategies such as adaptation
and resilience in particular—and that lower utilization of
injections might improve outcomes.
