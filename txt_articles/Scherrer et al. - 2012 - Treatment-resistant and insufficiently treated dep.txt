 It is well established that depression following a myocardial
infarction increases risk for mortality. Those at greatest risk may
be patients with treatment-resistant depression.1,2 Treatment-
resistant depression has been defined in many ways, including
failure to respond to a single trial of an antidepressant at an
adequate dose and duration,3 evidence of simultaneous use of
multiple antidepressants plus augmentation, or receipt of mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors and/or electroconvulsive therapy.4 A
graduated five-stage model ending in failure to respond to mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors and then electroconvulsive therapy has
also been proposed.4 Patients (n = 361) who continued to have
depression following antidepressant treatment were 2.3 times
more likely to die (i.e. all-cause mortality) following acute
myocardial infarction in the Sertraline Antidepressant Heart
Attack Randomized Trial (SADHART).5 Similar findings in the
Myocardial
Infarction
and
Depression
Intervention
Trial
(MIND-IT) indicate that patients who do not respond to therapy
have over a fourfold risk of a new cardiovascular event.6 The trial’s
authors concluded that treatment resistance is an independent risk
factor for worse outcomes; however, the sample size in this trial
was relatively small (n = 168). Because there have been few studies
of
treatment-resistant
depression
and
mortality
following
myocardial infarction and because of the relatively small cohorts
in the SADHART and MIND-IT analyses, we investigated
whether there is an association between treatment resistance and
mortality in a large, nationally distributed cohort of Veterans
Administration (VA) patients.
Method
Data were obtained from in-patient and out-patient ICD-9-CM
diagnoses,7 Current Procedural Terminology codes, Pharmacy
Benefits Management records, and Vital Status files maintained
by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) beginning in fiscal
year (FY) 1999. Data are maintained by the VHA Office of
Information
at the
Austin
Information
Technology Center
(www.virec.research.va.gov/datasourcesname/medical-sas-datasets/
SAS.htm). The sample and detailed method of deriving the cohort
have been described previously.8,9
Cohort eligibility
Using ICD-9-CM codes, we identified a patient cohort free of
diagnosed cardiovascular disease in the fiscal years FY1999 and
FY2000. From 1 380 433 patients using VA healthcare in 1999
and 2000 we excluded those with at least one primary or
secondary diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease (ICD-9-CM
402–405), ischaemic heart disease (ICD-9-CM 410–414), disease
of the pulmonary circulation (ICD-9-CM 414–417) and other
forms of heart disease (ICD-9-CM 420–429) as well as patients

Background
Depression is a known risk factor for mortality after an acute
myocardial infarction. Patients with treatment-responsive
depression may have a better prognosis than those with
treatment-resistant depression.
Aims
We sought to determine whether mortality following acute
myocardial infarction was associated with treatment-resistant
depression.
Method
Follow-up began after myocardial infarction and continued
until death or censorship. Depression was counted as
present if diagnosed any time during the study period.
Treatment for depression was defined as receipt of
12 or more weeks of continuous antidepressant therapy
at a therapeutic dose during follow-up. Treatment-
resistant depression was defined as use of two or
more antidepressants plus augmentation therapy,
receipt of electroconvulsive therapy or use of monoamine
oxidase inhibitors. Mean duration of follow-up was
39 months.
Results
During follow-up of 4037 patients with major depressive
disorder who had had a myocardial infarction, 6.9% of those
with insufficiently treated depression, 2.4% of those with
treated depression and 5.0% of those with treatment-
resistant depression died. A multivariable survival model
that adjusted for sociodemographics, anxiety disorders,
beta-blocker use, mortality risk factors and health service
utilisation indicated that compared with treated patients,
insufficiently treated patients were 3.04 (95% CI 2.12–4.35)
times more likely and patients with treatment-resistant
depression were 1.71 (95% CI 1.05–2.79) times more likely
to die.
Conclusions
All-cause mortality following an acute myocardial infarction is
greatest in patients with depression who are insufficiently
treated and is a risk in patients with treatment-resistant
depression. However, the risk of mortality associated with
treatment-resistant depression is partly explained by
comorbid disorders. Further studies are warranted to
determine whether changes in depression independently
predict all-cause mortality.

 with cerebrovascular disease (ICD-9-CM 430–438). We then
selected all patients with a primary diagnosis of major depressive
disorder (ICD-9-CM 296.2, 296.3 or 311) and a set of 300 000
randomly selected, cardiovascular disease-free patients without
depression. This resulted in a sample of 536 415 unique patients
free of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in both
FY1999 and FY2000. The 7-year follow-up period began 1 October
2000 and ended 30 September 2007.
Exclusion criteria
We excluded patients with psychotic and bipolar disorders to
reduce the risk of misclassifying major depressive disorder.
Patients also had to be between the ages of 25 and 80 at the
beginning of follow-up to allow for variability in risk for
myocardial infarction and mortality. In order to limit the sample
to regular users of VA healthcare, patients who did not have at
least one out-patient visit in both FY1999 and FY2000 were
excluded. Patients were also excluded if an acute myocardial
infarction occurred within the first month of follow-up. After
applying these criteria, a final sample of 96 612 patients with
major depressive disorder and 259 387 patients without major
depressive disorder remained. From this cohort of 355 999
veterans, we identified 12 304 patients with an incident myocardial
infarction during the follow-up period. Of these patients, 4242
patients with depression were eligible for analysis. We excluded
126 patients who did not have 12 weeks of follow-up time after
myocardial infarction because this was the minimum follow-up
time necessary to define the primary independent variable (i.e.
guideline-concordant antidepressant use). Also, 79 patients of
unknown ethnicity or marital status were excluded. This resulted
in a sample of 4037 patients available for analysis.
Predictor variables
Treatment
We have previously found a markedly reduced risk of myocardial
infarction among patients who receive 12 weeks of continuous
antidepressants at therapeutic doses (i.e., guideline-concordant
acute phase treatment).9 Therefore, we considered patients to have
been treated for depression if they received 12 or more weeks of a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (citalopram, fluoxetine,
paroxetine, sertraline), serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor
(venlafaxine,
mirtazapine),
tricylic
(amitriptyline,
doxepin,
nortriptyline) or other antidepressant (bupropion, nefazodone,
trazodone) during follow-up. Patients were considered to have been
insufficiently treated if they did not receive guideline-concordant
acute phase treatment for depression. All antidepressant use data
were based on the days supply variable from the Pharmacy
Benefits Management records.
Post-myocardial infarction depression
This was defined as a new onset of major depression following a
myocardial infarction. We chose to model new-onset depression
and not lifetime depression because Parker et al10 have reported
strong evidence that incident depression, but not lifetime
depression, following acute coronary syndrome was associated
with poorer cardiovascular outcomes.
Treatment-resistant depression
Using an adaptation of Corey-Lisle et al’s11 method for identifying
treatment-resistant
depression
in
administrative
data,
we
considered patients to be treatment-resistant if they received: (a)
electroconvulsive therapy; (b) a monoamine oxidase inhibitor;
or (c) two or more antidepressants at the same time plus
augmentation therapy. Combination antidepressant therapy was
defined as the use of two or more antidepressants overlapping
at least 31 days. Augmentation therapy was defined as receipt of
a mood-stabilising or atypical antipsychotic.
Covariates
Covariates were selected because of their known association with
mortality and high co-occurrence with depression. Nicotine
dependence was defined by ICD-9-CM code 305.1 or V15.82
indicating personal history of tobacco use prior to mortality or
censorship. Alcohol misuse/dependence was defined by ICD-9-CM
code 305.0 for misuse and/or 303 indicating dependence. We
adjusted for the following anxiety disorders: generalised anxiety
disorder (ICD-9-CM 300.02), panic disorder (ICD-9-CM 300.1),
anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (ICD-9-CM 300.0),
obsessive–compulsive disorder (ICD-9-CM 300.3), social phobia
(ICD-9-CM 300.23) and post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-9-
CM 309.81). Because beta-blocker use may be associated with
symptoms
of
depression
we
adjusted
for
the
medication
possession ratio for atenolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, labetalol,
metoprolol, propranolol, sotalol, nadolol and pindolol. Obesity
was defined as ICD-9-CM codes 278.0–278.02 or as a body mass
index of 430 from height and weight data obtained from the
Vital Signs data file and classified as obese v. not obese according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.12
The Romano adaptation of the Charlson Comorbidity Index,13,14
a list of 17 health conditions associated with morbidity and
mortality, was included to adjust for underlying risk for all-cause
mortality. We have found that health service utilisation is inversely
associated with mortality, therefore we adjusted for clinic stops
per month.
Sociodemographics at baseline
Data were available on year of birth, gender, ethnicity and marital
status. We adjusted for marital status because it is associated with
social support and subsequent mortality. Marital status was
modelled as a three-level variable (married, divorced/widowed/
separated and single/never married).
Outcome variable: all-cause mortality
All deaths during the period 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2007
were obtained from the VA Vital Status file which tracks deaths by
incorporating information from the Beneficiary Identification and
Records Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) Death File created by the
Veterans
Benefits
Administration
(VBA),
the
Medical
SAS
Inpatient Datasets that track mortality and death dates that occur
during a hospital stay, and the Social Security Administration
(SSA) Death Master File.
Analytic design
Bivariate analyses included t-tests for continuous variables and
chi-squared tests for categorical variables. We first characterised
the association between covariates and mortality. Then we
investigated the relationship between covariates and major
depressive disorder treatment status. Survival models were then
computed to analyse time to mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) for
mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models
with
time-dependent
covariates.
Owing
to
a
nonlinear
relationship between age, mortality and major depressive disorder
treatment status, both a linear and a quadratic age term were
included in all multivariable survival models. Sociodemographics
were modelled from their status at baseline, clinic stops were
modelled continuously as number of clinic stops per month,
138
Scherrer et al
 Depression and all-cause mortality following myocardial infarction
and the remaining adjustments were based on time-dependent
covariates that could occur any time before the end of follow-
up. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.3 for
Windows, with a set at 0.05. Two-tailed tests were used to allow
for both risk factors and protective effects. The PROC PHREG
procedure was used to compute Cox proportional hazards models.
Month was the unit of time for survival analyses and the index
myocardial infarction date was the beginning of follow-up.
This project was approved by the institutional review boards
of the St Louis Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Washington
University.
Results
Among
the
4037
patients
with
depression
after
incident
myocardial infarction, 25.6% were insufficiently treated, 62.4%
were successfully treated and 12.1% had treatment-resistant
depression. As shown in Table 1, insufficiently treated patients
were more likely to be older (mean age 60.4 years, s.d.= 11.3)
and treatment-resistant patients more likely to be younger (mean
age 56.2 years, s.d.= 9.5) than treated patients (mean age 58.1
years, s.d.= 10.0). Treated patients were more likely to be White
(P50.0001) and married (P50.05). Alcohol misuse/dependence
was
more
common
in
treatment-resistant
depression
(P = 0.0025) as was having any anxiety disorder (P50.0001).
Obesity was more common in patients with treatment-resistant
depression (P50.0001). Beta-blocker use was more common
among patients who were treated or had treatment-resistant
depression (P50.0001). The mean comorbidity index was highest
(P50.0001) among treatment-resistant patients. Last, mean clinic
stops per month was greatest in the treatment-resistant group
(P50.0001).

 Scherrer et al
The distribution of covariates and treatment status by mortality
status is shown in Table 2. As expected, older age (P50.0001) and
higher comorbidity index scores (P50.0001) were associated with
higher risks of mortality, and female (P50.05) and married
(P50.05) patients and those with any anxiety disorder (P50.001)
had a lower likelihood of mortality. Obesity (P= 0.0058) was
associated with a lower risk of mortality. More clinic stops per
month was associated with lower mortality (P50.0001). Insufficient
treatment was associated with higher mortality (P50.001).
A survival model that adjusted only for age indicated that
patients with insufficiently treated depression were 2.98 (95% CI
2.10–4.22) times more likely to die during follow-up and
treatment-resistant patients were 1.96 (95% CI 1.22–3.15) times
more likely to die as compared with treated patients.
A full model indicated that compared with treated patients,
insufficiently treated patients were 2.93 (95% CI 2.03–4.21) times
more likely to die during follow-up (Table 3). Treatment-resistant
patients were significantly more likely to die during follow-up after
multiple covariate adjustment (HR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.05–2.79). As
expected, a higher comorbidity index was associated with a greater
likelihood of death (HR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.31–1.40). Lastly, more
clinic stops per month was associated with lower likelihood of
death (HR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.90–0.99).
After adjusting for each covariate in separate models (Table 4),
we found that the comorbidity index partially accounted for the
association between treatment-resistant depression and mortality
but did not account for the association between insufficiently
treated depression and mortality.
Discussion
After adjustment in a multivariate model, treatment-resistant
depression was significantly associated with mortality and this
association was partly explained by comorbid conditions. In
addition, patients were less likely to die if they had any treatment
whether in the context of the treatment-resistant depression
paradigm or as part of sufficient treatments compared with
insufficiently treated depression.
Our data are consistent with previous SADHART results that
show patients who do not respond to antidepressant treatment
to be over twice as likely to die following acute myocardial
infarction
(SADHART).5
The
present
study
supports
the
conclusion that treatment-resistant depression results in worse
outcomes as compared with successful acute phase treatment,
which is consistent with the conclusion that treatment resistance
is
a
risk
factor
for
poor
prognosis
following
myocardial
infarction.1,6,15 In addition, individual covariate adjustment
suggests that physical comorbidities may partly account for the
association between treatment-resistant depression and mortality.
We are unable to determine whether patients eventually
responded to one of the types of treatment in our treatment-
resistant algorithm. For instance, it is possible that patients
responded to augmentation therapy or electroconvulsive therapy.
This would be consistent with the finding that patients with
treatment-resistant depression were at lower risk for mortality
(HR = 1.71)
compared
with
insufficiently
treated
patients
(HR = 2.93) if responding to a second- or third-line therapy
reduced depression and thereby decreased depression-related
mortality. Indeed, results from STAR-D provide evidence that
some patients respond to second- or third-line treatments after
failing initial pharmacotherapy.16
Non-adherence to medical care may help to explain the greater
risk of mortality in insufficiently treated patients with depression.
Insufficiently treated patients received less than 12 weeks of
continuous antidepressant therapy, possibly because of poor
adherence to antidepressant medication. Antidepressant non-
adherence could be a marker for poor adherence to other medical
regimens. In fact, post-hoc analyses of beta-blocker use following
myocardial infarction indicated that treated patients and patients
with treatment-resistant depression were taking beta-blockers for
a significantly longer time compared with insufficiently treated
patients. Thus adherence with pharmacotherapy may partly
explain our findings. In addition, patients who are non-adherent
to pharmacotherapy may be non-adherent to other aspects of
cardiac aftercare. This is consistent with our finding that greater
clinic utilisation, and the additional screening and prevention

 Depression and all-cause mortality following myocardial infarction
associated with more healthcare use, is associated with a lower risk
of mortality. However, it does not appear that unhealthy
behaviours in insufficiently treated patients with depression could
explain our findings because they were the least likely to be obese
and did not differ in terms of nicotine dependence/tobacco use
compared with the treated and treatment-resistant groups.
Alternatively, if more aggressive treatment for treatment-resistant
depression involves the addition of augmentation therapy with
atypical antipsychotics, then it is possible that the poor metabolic
consequences associated with these drugs may increase risk for
greater cardiac morbidity and mortality. However, in post-hoc
analysis, patients with treatment-resistant depression on anti-
psychotics did not significantly differ in risk of mortality from
patients
with
treatment-resistant
depression
not
on
these
medications
(HR = 0.54;
95%
CI
0.20–1.51).
Exposure
to
antipsychotics does not account for the association between
treatment-resistant depression and mortality in our analysis.
Our results may not generalise beyond mortality to other
unfavourable outcomes following myocardial infarction. In post-
hoc analysis we observed that risk of new-onset stroke was not
significantly associated with insufficiently treated depression
(HR = 1.24; 95% CI 0.91–1.70) and treatment-resistant depression
(HR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.58–1.33). But the risk of new-onset heart
failure was significantly associated with insufficiently treated
(HR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.27–2.20) but not treatment-resistant
depression (HR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.61–1.39). The lower magnitude
of association between post-myocardial infarction depression status
and these cardiac events is consistent with recent meta-analysis
demonstrating that post-myocardial infarction depression is more
strongly associated with cardiac mortality than with cardiac
events.17
Strengths
The large sample size permitted adjustment for many pertinent
covariates. The long period of observation allowed us to model
rare outcomes and the effects of covariates over time. Our study
overcomes a limitation of projects that have utilised only
pharmacy data because we can establish the effect of anti-
depressants in a cohort diagnosed with depression rather than
relying on the use of antidepressants as an indicator of depression
status.
Limitations
Our
treatment-resistant
depression
algorithm
is
based
on
administrative medical record data in which the cause of death
is unknown. However, the accuracy of psychiatric diagnosis in
administrative data is excellent if the correct algorithm is applied
as was done in the present study. Comparison of chart review with
an algorithm requiring two or more visits with an ICD-9 code
for depression has been shown to have 99% positive predictive
value for depression diagnoses in administrative claims data.18
ICD-9-CM codes for myocardial infarction have very high
agreement (499%) with written medical records in the VA.19
Although it is unlikely, it is possible that in some cases, the cardiac
event that we classified as the incident myocardial infarction may
instead have been a recurrence or exacerbation of a pre-existing
cardiovascular condition that was first recorded in non-VA
records. It is possible that the accuracy of ICD-9-CM diagnoses
may differ outside the VA system (e.g. in managed care health
plans); however, the automated and systematic method of
maintaining electronic records in the VA improves diagnostic
accuracy. Lastly, it is possible that patients with treatment-
resistant depression improved more than insufficiently treated
patients; however, it is not possible to determine the symptom
status of patients using only administrative data. If active
depression is associated with increased risk of death, it is possible
that continued depression in treatment-resistant patients could
account
for
the
relationship
between
treatment-resistant
depression and mortality. In further analyses, we observed that
compared
with
patients
without
depression,
patients
with
depression that received 12 or more weeks of treatment with
antidepressants were significantly less likely to die during
follow-up (HR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.41–0.71). In contrast, patients
with depression who were not treated were significantly more
likely to die during follow-up (HR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.24–2.08)
and there was a non-significant trend for treatment-resistant
patients (HR = 1.33; 95% CI 0.93–1.96) to be at increased risk
for death, providing some evidence that active depression is
associated with mortality.
Implications
The present analysis adds to the nascent literature suggesting that
treatment-resistant depression contributes to the poor outcomes
of patients with depression following myocardial infarction. This
may be partly due to comorbid conditions in patients with
treatment-resistant
depression.
Compared
with
insufficient
treatment, these data suggest that any guideline-concordant
treatment reduces risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
Future studies should consider whether worsening of depression
is the mechanism underlying the association between untreated
depression, treatment-resistant depression and increased risk of
mortality after myocardial infarction. Large prospective cohort
studies with sensitive repeated measures of depression status are
warranted.
