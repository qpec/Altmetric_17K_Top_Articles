Abstract
The recently described Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia mayonii is associated with human illness in the Upper 
Midwest of the United States. Experimental laboratory studies and field observations on natural infection indicate 
that B. mayonii is maintained by horizontal transmission between tick vectors and vertebrate reservoirs. While 
maintaining a colony of Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) ticks infected with the B. mayonii type strain (MN14-
1420), we had an opportunity to examine whether infected females may pass this spirochete transovarially to their 
offspring. 
We found no evidence of B. mayonii infection in subsets of larvae originating from 18 infected I. scapularis 
females (grand total of 810 larvae tested), or in mice exposed to larval feeding.

Borrelia mayonii, a recently described human-pathogenic species 
within the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, is associated 
with Lyme disease in the Upper Midwest of the United States (Pritt 
et al. 2016a,b; Kingry et al. 2016). The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scap-
ularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), is an experimentally confirmed vector 
of B. mayonii (Dolan et al. 2016, 2017a), and natural infection was 
documented from I. scapularis nymphs and adults in Minnesota and 
Wisconsin (Pritt et al. 2016a,b). Moreover, the house mouse (Mus 
musculus L.) is an experimental reservoir for B. mayonii (Dolan et al. 
2016, 2017b), and natural infection was documented in Minnesota 
from two rodent species, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leu-
copus Rafinesque) and the American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus 
hudsonicus Erxleben) (Johnson et al. 2017). These findings collec-
tively indicate that B. mayonii is maintained in part by horizontal 
transmission between tick vectors and vertebrate hosts, similar to 
B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (Piesman and Gern 2004). However, the 
potential for transovarial (vertical) transmission of B. mayonii from 
infected females to their offspring, which could place humans at 
risk for bites by infected larval ticks, is unknown. Experimental evi-
dence of transovarial transmission is lacking for I. scapularis females 
infected with well characterized B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains. 
Wild spirochete strains detected by microscopy or immunofluores-
cence assays from unfed Ixodes larvae in older studies can no longer 
be assumed to belong to B. burgdorferi sensu lato (Richter et al. 
2012, Rollend et al. 2013) because these detection methods may not 
differentiate B. burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes from the relapsing 
fever spirochete Borrelia miyamotoi, which is passed transovarially 
from infected I. scapularis females to the resulting larvae (Scoles 
et al. 2001, Breuner et al. 2017).
In order to conduct experiments on transmission of B. mayo-
nii by feeding ticks, we established a colony of I. scapularis ticks 
infected with the MN14-1420 type strain that was originally iso-
lated from a human patient (Pritt et al. 2016a,b). The maintenance 
of this colony of B. mayonii-infected ticks also allowed us to oppor-
tunistically examine whether infected females may pass this recently 
discovered Lyme disease spirochete transovarially to their offspring.
Materials and Methods
Infected female ticks were produced by feeding nymphs from our in-
house CT (Connecticut) and MN (Minnesota) colonies infected with 
the B. mayonii type strain (MN14-1420) (Eisen et al. 2017) ad libi-
tum on naïve 1- to 3-mo-old female CD-1 white mice (Charles River 
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) as described previously (Dolan et al. 
2016). The nymphs had acquired B. mayonii by feeding as larvae 
on four individual infected mice from which other resulting nymphs 
had infection rates ranging from 5.4 to 20.0% (Dolan et al. 2016, 
Eisen et al. 2017). Mixed potentially infected females from the CT 
and MN colonies were then fed together with male ticks on a sin-
gle female New Zealand white rabbit (Charles River Laboratories). 
The ticks were allowed to attach to the ears of the rabbit, contained 
within cloth bags covering each ear and secured with athletic tape

 at the base of the ears (Piesman et al. 1991, 1999), with each ear 
receiving approximately 25 female and 25 male ticks. The rabbit 
was fitted with an Elizabethan collar to prevent disruption and dam-
age to the ear bags and the ticks within. Recovered fully fed females 
(n = 39) were placed singly into glass vials with a plaster of Paris and 
activated charcoal mixture at the bottom and a mesh top, and then 
transferred to desiccators (90–95% relative humidity) in a growth 
chamber maintained at 24°C with a 16:8 (L:D) h cycle.
Whole bodies of fed females that had finished ovipositing (n = 23) 
were examined for presence of B. mayonii DNA by multiplex poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously (Dolan et al. 
2017, Johnson et al. 2017). Larvae originating from females found to 
be infected (n = 18) were similarly examined for presence of B. may-
onii DNA by multiplex PCR. This included 45 larvae per infected fe-
male, tested in pools of 15 larvae. Moreover, larvae originating from 
three B. mayonii-infected females were allowed to feed ad libitum 
on 10 CD-1 mice (>100 larvae per mouse). These mice were assayed, 
as described previously (Dolan et al. 2017a, Eisen et al. 2017), for 
B. mayonii infection by culture of ear biopsies (taken 4 wk after the 
larval feed) in modified Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium with antibi-
otics (in-house BSK-R medium), and for seroreactivity to B. mayonii 
(8 wk after the larval feed).
Animal use and experimental procedures were in accordance 
with approved protocols on file with the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention Division of Vector-Borne Diseases Animal Care and 
Use Committee.
Results and Discussion
Of the 23 I. scapularis females that fed and oviposited, 18 (78%) 
contained B. mayonii DNA. This infection rate was much higher 
than expected from previous examination of unfed nymphs of the 
same cohort (5–20%) that originated from larval feeds on the same 
4 individual infectious source animals as the females examined 
here. Indeed, the observed infection rate of 78% (18/23) for the fed 
females is significantly higher than an upper end prediction of 20% 
infected unfed females based on the data for the preceding nymphal 
stage (Likelihood Ratio Test; P < 0.001). Co-feeding transmission 
where spirochetes were passed from feeding infected to noninfected 
females is one possible explanation for the observed rise in B. mayo-
nii infection rate of the fully fed females. Co-feeding transmission 
from infected to noninfected I. scapularis ticks was previously 
observed for uncharacterized B. burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes 
in females fed together within ear bags on naïve rabbits, with half of 
previously uninfected females acquiring spirochetes via co-feeding 
transmission (Piesman et al. 1998). Moreover, co-feeding transmis-
sion from infected to noninfected I. scapularis ticks was documented 
for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (B31) and uncharacterized B. burg-
dorferi sensu lato spirochetes in immatures fed in close proximity 
to each other on rodents (Patrican 1997, Piesman and Happ 2001). 
However, as we did not test the blood of the rabbit the females were 
feeding on for presence of B. mayonii in the present study, we can-
not rule out the possibility that the females acquired spirochetes via 
infected blood rather than by co-feeding transmission.
Regardless of whether they were infected prior to feeding or be-
came infected while feeding, we found no evidence that any of the 18 
B. mayonii-infected I. scapularis females passed spirochetes to the 
resulting larvae (based on testing of a grand total of 810 larvae). As 
we cannot be sure of how many females were infected prior to feed-
ing, and we tested only subsets of the resulting larvae, the possibility 
of ineffective transovarial transmission resulting in occasional larval 
infection cannot be ruled out. Moreover, none of 10 mice exposed to 
larval feeding were found to be either infected with or seroreactive to 
B. mayonii. We conclude that while horizontal transmission between 
vector ticks and vertebrate reservoirs appear to be important for the 
natural maintenance of B. mayonii evidence for transovarial trans-
mission of this Lyme disease spirochete is lacking.
