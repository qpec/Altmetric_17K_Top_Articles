ABSTRACT
In zones of violent conflict in the tropics, social disruption leads to elevated child mortality, 
of which malaria is the leading cause. Understanding the social determinants of malaria 
transmission may be helpful to optimize malaria control efforts. We conducted a cross-sectional 
study of healthy children aged 2 months to 5 years attending well-child and/or immunization 
visits in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Six hundred and forty-seven children were 
tested for malaria antigenemia by rapid diagnostic test and the accompanying parent or 
legal guardian simultaneously completed a survey questionnaire related to demographics, 
socioeconomic status, maternal education, as well as bednet use and recent febrile illness. We 
examined the associations between variables using multivariable logistic regression analysis, 
chi-squared statistic, Fisher’s exact test, and Spearman’s rank correlation, as appropriate. One 
hundred and twenty-three out of the 647 (19%) children in the study tested positive for malaria. 
Higher levels of maternal education were associated with a lower risk of malaria in their children. 
The prevalence of malaria in children of mothers with no education, primary school, and 
beyond primary was 41/138 (30%), 41/241 (17%), and 39/262 (15%), respectively (p = 0.001). In a 
multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for the effect of a child’s age and study site, the 
following remained significant predictors of malaria antigenemia: maternal education, number 
of children under five per household, and HIV serostatus. Higher maternal education, through 
several putative causal pathways, was associated with lower malaria prevalence among children 
in the DRC. Our findings suggest that maternal education might be an effective ‘social vaccine’ 
against malaria in the DRC and globally.
Introduction
Malaria is a vector-borne parasitic infection caused by the 
genus Plasmodium, which is transmitted through the bite 
of female Anopheles mosquitoes. In 2015, an estimated 
249–303 million cases of malaria occurred globally, with 
an estimated 236–635 thousand deaths [1]. Eighty-eight 
percent of malaria cases and 90% of malaria-associated 
deaths occurred in Africa [1].
Social determinants of health are factors, such as 
gender, age, living conditions, socioeconomic status, 
and education, that influence health and risk of disease 
[2,3]. Unequal access to healthcare, education, sanitation, 
and adequate shelter all have an impact on the health 
disparities that impact disadvantaged populations [4]. 
Household wealth and maternal education are well-
known examples of social factors that exert a profound 
‘upstream’ influence on childhood mortality [5−8].
Malaria transmission is influenced by various social 
factors. Malaria and poverty are mutually amplifying, 
with a strong ecologic association [9]. The effect of 
malaria-related morbidity and mortality on the poor 
is disproportionately greater than that of the general 
population due to limited health care access [10]. Higher 
household wealth may be protective against malaria 
[11]. Sub-optimal living conditions may affect the risk 
of malaria infection due to increased vector exposure, 
reduced ability to use vector barrier methods (e.g. diffi-
culty hanging bednet) and/or exposure to vector breed-
ing sites [12,13]. Average household size is associated 
with malaria prevalence as the risk of transmission may 
increase when the number of people sleeping together 
in the same room increases [14]. Recent evidence sug-
gests that a mother’s educational attainment and social 
network may be protective against malaria [7]. However, 
whether the protective effect of maternal education on 
childhood malaria persists in settings of violent conflict 
and social disruption has not been previously investi-
gated, to our knowledge.

local markets. There were no mass bednet distribution 
programs in the areas around the time of our study.
A standard sample size calculation indicated that 627 
children would be needed to show an absolute differ-
ence of 14% in malaria prevalence in children of moth-
ers with education beyond primary level vs. those with 
primary level or no education, with 80% power at a level 
of significance α = 0.05. Previous studies in other coun-
tries noted a difference in malaria prevalence of 14% in 
children of mothers with primary or no education (30%) 
versus education beyond primary (16%) [7].
Ethical approval and consent
Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the 
Comité d’Éthique du Nord Kivu (Université Catholique 
du Graben), the University of Alberta Human Research 
Ethics Board, and regionally from the Médecin Chef de 
Zone, within the DRC Ministry of Health. A parent or legal 
guardian of each participating child provided written 
informed consent.
Study procedures
For each child, the accompanying parent or legal  
guardian 
completed a survey questionnaire including questions on 
demographics, household assets (motor vehicle, electric-
ity, radio, television, refrigerator), household construction 
(brick and mortar versus thatch), household composition 
(number of people living in the house and number of chil-
dren under 5), maternal education (no formal education, 
primary, beyond primary),  
household bednet ownership, 
and use of a bednet by the child the night prior to the sur-
vey, mobile phone ownership, recent (within past month) 
febrile illness, and quality of medical care accessed (diag-
nosis by a health care  
provider, blood test performed, 
treatment administered). A malaria rapid diagnostic test 
(RDT, ParaCheck-Pf ® kit, Orchid Biomedical Systems, Goa, 
India) and HIV test (Alere Determine ™, Orgenics, Ltd. 
Yavne, Israel) were performed on the child from a finger-
pick. The RDT detects P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 
2 (HRP2) antigens in the peripheral circulation and has 
a sensitivity of 98.9% and a specificity of 84.9% in field 
studies [21]. Study personnel were trained to safely and 
accurately use the RDTs with proficiency testing, as previ-
ously described [22]. Children with a positive RDT result 
were treated with artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) 
according to World Health Organization guidelines; all 
were asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. HIV pos-
itive children were referred for care to the local mother–
child HIV treatment program.
Statistical analysis
Our primary analysis focused on factors associated 
with malaria infection, using bivariate statistics and 
Civil and international conflict in the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC) over the past two decades 
has decimated health care and civil infrastructure, with 
direct consequences on child mortality, malaria inci-
dence, and education [15,16]. The DRC is ranked among 
the least operationally and technically feasible countries 
for malaria elimination due to the intensity of malaria 
transmission, armed conflict, and political instability [17]. 
Social upheaval has led to an epidemic of gender-based 
violence, large-scale population displacement, and dis-
ruption of education for girls and women [18,19]. In this 
context, we investigated determinants of childhood 
malaria infection, with particular attention to mater-
nal education and putative causal pathways by which 
maternal education may modulate malaria risk. We 
hypothesized that higher maternal education would be 
associated with a lower childhood malaria prevalence 
in a resource-limited setting with social disruption due 
to violent conflict.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional observational study of 
afebrile, healthy children aged 2 months to 5 years attend-
ing well-child and/or immunization visits in the North 
Kivu province in eastern DRC from August to October 
2010 to investigate the relationship between social deter-
minants of health and malaria prevalence. All children 
who presented to the well-child and/or immunization 
clinics were eligible for the study, including those who 
tested positive for HIV. There were no exclusion criteria.
Study area and population
This study was conducted in three semi-urban cities of 
North Kivu, DRC: Butembo, Beni, and Goma. The esti-
mated population of Butembo, Beni, and Goma are ~600 
thousand, ~200 thousand, and 1 million, respectively. 
The population is primarily of Nande ethnicity, and the 
main languages spoken are Nande, Swahili and French. 
The DRC suffers from decimated civil and health care 
infrastructure, as well as social instability, after many 
years of civil and international conflict [15,16,20]. High 
mortality rates in the DRC can be attributed to limited 
infrastructure, poverty, violence, and especially, infec-
tious diseases [15,16,19]. Malaria is the leading cause 
of death in this area and in children under 5 [15,16]. 
Although malaria incidence and prevalence in the DRC 
are not precisely known due to a lack of quality data, 97% 
of the population resides in high transmission regions 
[1]. The estimated number of cases and deaths caused 
by malaria in 2013 are estimated to be 26 million and 
72 thousand, respectively [1]. Access to bednets is gen-
erally available free of charge through antenatal clinics, 
which are a part of the country’s national health care 
program. Bednets are also available for purchase at the

multivariable logistic regression analyses. To examine 
associations between dichotomous variables, we used 
chi-squared statistic or Fisher’s exact test, as appropri-
ate. To examine associations between variables which 
were continuous or ordinal, we used Spearman’s rank 
correlation (ρ). Based on work by Njau et al. [7], we 
developed a conceptual framework (Supplemental 
Figure 1) linking maternal education to malaria infec-
tion in the child. Concepts in this framework and their 
proxy variables are defined in Table 1. We used a lin-
ear asset index, modified from Filmer and Pritchett 
[23], from a set of six household asset indicators. We 
used principal component analysis (PCA) to derive the 
weights for each asset, which allowed us to divide our 
participants into wealth quintiles. Previously, a sim-
ilar asset index was validated, demonstrating close 
correspondence with state-level poverty in India, as 
well as correlation with household consumption and 
expenditures [23]. Missing data were excluded from 
statistical analysis. Statistics were computed using 
SPSS® version 23 (IBM®).
Results
We enrolled 647 healthy children attending clinics for 
well-child visits and immunizations at three health 
facilities across the North Kivu province of the DRC 
(Butembo, Beni and Goma). A flow diagram is included 
in Supplemental Figure 2 to outline the study population 
at each stage of the study. The point prevalence of P. falci-
parum infection, in this asymptomatic study population 
was 123/647 (19%).
Household assets were characteristic of a setting with 
severe resource limitations: only 49/646 (7.6%), 93/645 
(14%), 104/646 (16%) 154/644 (24%), 169/646 (26%), and 
433/647 (67%) owned a refrigerator, car, house built from 
high-quality material, television, electricity, and radio, 
respectively. Regarding bednets, 245/645 (38%) partici-
pants reported owning a bednet, and 169/643 (26%) chil-
dren slept under the bednet the previous night. According 
to maternal report, 276/578 (48%) of children had expe-
rienced a febrile illness in the past month, including 87 
cases of malaria. Of the 87 self-reported cases of malaria, 
73/87 (84%), 54/87 (62%), and 70/87 (81%) had received a 
diagnosis of malaria by a health care professional, a blood 
test performed, and treatment administered, respectively.
Higher levels of maternal education were associated 
with lower point prevalence of malaria in their children 
(Figure 1). Associations between malaria infection and 
maternal education, the number of children less than 
5 years old per household, and HIV serostatus were all 
significant after multivariable logistic regression analysis 
accounting for possible confounding among co-variates 
and adjusting for the effect of child’s age and study site 
(Table 2). In a subgroup analysis of children in the poor-
est wealth quintile, the relationship between maternal 
education and malaria infection in children remained: 
25/84 (30%), 7/54 (13%), 3/23 (13%) malaria prevalence 
among children of mothers with no, primary, and sec-
ondary or greater education, respectively (p = 0.014). To 
exclude possible persistence of HRP2 antigen following 
recently treated malaria episode as a cause of RDT posi-
tivity [24,25], we examined the subgroup of children who 
did not have a febrile illness in the past month and found

infant and child mortality [27−30], improved nutritional 
status [31], and reduced rates of injuries, respiratory 
conditions, hospital admission, and infection [32−35]. 
Specific infections that have been linked to maternal 
education include: diarrhea and pneumonia [32], chronic 
suppurative otitis media [33], Helicobacter pylori [33,35], 
and malaria [7]. A cross-sectional study of over 10,000 
households in Tanzania, Uganda, and Angola investigat-
ing the relationship between maternal education and 
childhood malaria infection demonstrated that there 
is a negative relationship between maternal education 
and the risk of childhood malaria infection [7]. Our study 
confirms and extends these findings to another sub- 
Saharan African context, characterized by social disrup-
tion due to violent conflict. Additionally, a considerable 
proportion of the relationship between maternal edu-
cation and malaria was independent of the mother’s 
income and assets in a previous report [27]. Consistent 
with this finding, maternal education was an inde-
pendent predictor of malaria in a multi-variable model 
adjusting for household wealth in our study. Maternal 
education also influenced childhood malaria within each 
wealth stratum, including the poorest subgroup.
In addition to maternal education, we identified mul-
tiple other independent predictors of childhood malaria 
(Table 3). In order to integrate these co-variates into a 
cohesive structure, we adapted a conceptual framework 
first proposed by Njau et al. [7], linking maternal educa-
tion to childhood malaria though several putative causal 
pathways (Supplemental Figure 1). Mothers with higher 
education: (1) may be more likely to access malaria pre-
vention measures (e.g. bednets) and quality treatment 
strategies; (2) may be wealthier and better able to provide 
for health needs of their children; (3) may have different 
family formation patterns (e.g. longer birth interval and 
fewer children); (4) may have improved social networks 
to access information and health services; and (5) may 
have lower HIV prevalence and lower HIV vertical trans-
mission rates to their children. One or more of these 
factors may influence the risk of childhood malaria. We 
quantified the association between maternal education 
and proxy variables for each putative causal pathway, 
as well as the association between these intermediate 
variables and malaria positivity in the child (Table 3).
Educated mothers are more likely to participate in 
behaviors that promote health such as vaccination 
[28,36−38]. Likewise, malaria prevention using bed-
nets was more common among educated mothers 
in previous studies in Tanzania and Kenya [7,39,40]. 
In our study, higher maternal education was associ-
ated with bednet ownership and use (Figure 2(A)). We 
observed an inverse relationship between bednet use 
and malaria infection (Table 3), although this did not 
reach statistical significance. However, a previous meta- 
analysis of randomized trials has clearly demonstrated 
that long-lasting insecticidal bednets significantly 
that the association between maternal education and 
malaria remained significant (ρ = 0.13, p = 0.028).
Variables in putative causal pathways linking maternal 
education to malaria infection in children were examined 
[7]. Statistically significant associations between mater-
nal education and bednet ownership and use, household 
wealth, and social networking were found (Figure 2 and 
Table 3). Additionally, a statistically significant associ-
ation between malaria infection and family formation 
patterns, social networking, and HIV serostatus (Table 3).
Discussion
In this cross-sectional study of 647 children in a sub- 
Saharan African context characterized by ongoing 
conflict and insecurity, higher maternal education 
appeared to be a protective social determinant of child-
hood malaria. Noteworthy aspects of this study include 
the highly statistically significant association between 
maternal education and malaria, which was robust after 
the adjustments of co-variates in a multivariable statisti-
cal model, and which had plausibility, based on multiple 
significant associations between variables in previously 
described putative causal pathways. Our findings are 
noteworthy, demonstrating that maternal education 
remains a strong determinant of child health even under 
conditions of social disruption due to violent conflict.
Maternal education is a well-known social determi-
nant of numerous childhood health outcomes. Both 
general educational attainment and a mother’s specific 
health-related knowledge affect the risk of malaria in her 
child [7,26]. In high- and low-income countries, higher 
general maternal education has been linked to lower

the association between malaria incidence and socio-
economic status have not demonstrated a consistent 
relationship [42]. Several studies found no relationship 
between socioeconomic status and malaria incidence 
[42]. On the other hand, another study found that ‘eco-
nomic empowerment,’ which described household 
wealth based on asset ownership, was the single most 
important factor in reducing childhood malaria preva-
lence [7]. We found a strong association between mater-
nal education and household wealth (Table 3), although 
household wealth was not statistically significantly asso-
ciated with childhood malaria, consistent with some pre-
vious reports [42].
Historically, malaria eradication in many countries 
was strongly associated with a reduction in average 
household size below four persons [14]. A previous 
reduce malaria-related morbidity and mortality [41]. 
Our findings support a putative causal pathway 
whereby maternal education is associated with bednet 
ownership and use, which in turn is protective against 
malaria in their children.
We also explored whether mothers with different 
levels of education attainment accessed medical care 
for their child for recent febrile illness, and the quality 
of the care they received. We did not find evidence that 
mothers with higher education sought better quality 
care, as indicated by: (1) diagnosis by a healthcare pro-
fessional; (2) blood test performed; and (3) treatment 
administered.
On a global macroeconomic scale, there is a strong 
association between poverty and malaria burden [9,42]. 
However, at the household level, studies examining

DRC are between 70 and 86% [45] and the prevalence 
of malaria in our study population was similar to that 
in the most recent Demographic and Health Survey 
in the DRC [46], suggesting that the children visiting 
well-child or immunization clinics may provide a fair 
sample of Congolese children. Our findings should be 
extrapolated with caution to large urban or remote rural 
settings, which may differ from the cities in this study. 
We used mobile phone ownership as a proxy for social 
networking as in previous studies [7], although this is an 
imperfect proxy and may also reflect household wealth 
or maternal access to household wealth. Our household 
asset index differs in some details from that of Filmer and 
Pritchett, incorporating fewer variables into our princi-
pal component analysis [23]. Finally, limited sample size 
may have reduced the statistical power to identify some 
associations (e.g. maternal education and childhood HIV 
seroprevalence).
Conclusion
Our study demonstrated that maternal education was 
strongly associated with childhood malaria prevalence 
in a resource-limited tropical setting characterized by 
social disruption due to violent conflict. Evidence from 
this study and others supports the plausibility of a causal 
relationship between maternal education and malaria 
through bednet use, higher household wealth, greater 
social networking, family structure, and possibly lower 
HIV rates. If indeed maternal education is a determinant 
of malaria infection in her child, this suggests that educa-
tion of girls and women may represent a ‘social vaccine’ 
against one of the leading infectious causes of global 
childhood mortality [47]. In our study, maternal educa-
tion beyond primary school, relative to no education, 
was associated with a reduction in malaria prevalence 
from 30 to 14%, corresponding to a relative reduction of 
53%. This effect size is of similar magnitude to that of the 
leading biomedical malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01E, which 
had a protective efficacy of 26–30% in recent phase 
study showed a significant relationship between fam-
ily formation patterns (including household size and 
number of children under five), maternal education, 
and malaria infection [7]. In our study, a high number 
of children less than five per household was associated 
with higher malaria prevalence. We speculate, as have 
previous authors [7], that families with a greater num-
ber of children may be less able than smaller families to 
provide bednets and other prevention and treatment 
measures for all the children. Alternatively, households 
with a higher density of susceptible hosts may be more 
conducive to malaria transmission.
As a woman expands her social network, she is more 
likely to use utilize healthcare services [27]. Social net-
working has been previously described as an impor-
tant mechanism through which maternal education 
decreases the risk of malaria infection in children [7]. We 
also observed significant relationships between mater-
nal education and social networking using mobile phone 
ownership as a proxy variable, as in another study [7]. In 
addition, social networking was associated with lower 
malaria prevalence in our study. These data support a 
putative causal pathway whereby maternal education is 
associated with better social networks, and lower malaria 
prevalence in their children.
HIV seropositivity was a risk factor for malaria in our 
study, as previously shown [43]. A woman’s education 
level may influence her risk of HIV infection [44], as a 
precursor to vertical transmission. We did not observe 
a statistically significant association between mater-
nal education and the child’s HIV status in our study, 
although the number of HIV-infected children was small.
Our study is subject to several limitations. We used 
data from a cross-sectional observational study, which 
allowed us to explore associations, but does not defini-
tively establish a causal relationship between variables. 
We studied children attending well-child or immuniza-
tion clinics in three cities in the province of North Kivu, 
DRC, which may not be fully representative of the coun-
try or region. Nonetheless, the immunization rates in the

three clinical trials [48]. The role of maternal education is 
indeed strong enough that even major social disruption 
as seen in the DRC did not abrogate its protective effect. 
Given the broad impact of maternal education on a host 
of health outcomes in their children, including malaria, 
investment in the education of girls and women is likely 
to yield substantial returns in terms of child survival in 
challenging environments like the DRC and globally 
[49,50].
