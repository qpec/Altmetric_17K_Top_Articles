Background: Up to 50% of patients fail to meet ST-segment–elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) guideline goals recommending a first medical 
contact–to–device time of <90 minutes for patients directly presenting 
to percutaneous coronary intervention–capable hospitals and <120 
minutes for transferred patients. We sought to increase the proportion of 
patients treated within guideline goals by organizing coordinated regional 
reperfusion plans.
Methods: We established leadership teams, coordinated protocols, and 
provided regular feedback for 484 hospitals and 1253 emergency medical 
services (EMS) agencies in 16 regions across the United States.
results: Between July 2012 and December 2013, 23 
809 patients 
presented with acute STEMI (direct to percutaneous coronary intervention 
hospital: 11 
765 EMS transported and 6502 self-transported; 5542 
transferred). EMS-transported patients differed from self-transported 
patients in symptom onset to first medical contact time (median, 47 
versus 114 minutes), incidence of cardiac arrest (10% versus 3%), shock 
on admission (11% versus 3%), and in-hospital mortality (8% versus 3%; 
P<0.001 for all comparisons). There was a significant increase in the 
proportion of patients meeting guideline goals of first medical contact–
to–device time, including those directly presenting via EMS (50% to 55%; 
P<0.001) and transferred patients (44%−48%; P=0.002). Despite regional 
variability, the greatest gains occurred among patients in the 5 most 
improved regions, increasing from 45% to 57% (direct EMS; P<0.001) and 
38% to 50% (transfers; P<0.001).
conclusions: This Mission: Lifeline STEMI Systems Accelerator 
demonstration project represents the largest national effort to organize 
regional STEMI care. By focusing on first medical contact–to–device 
time, coordinated treatment protocols, and regional data collection and 
reporting, we were able to increase significantly the proportion of patients 
treated within guideline goals.

r
apid coronary artery reperfusion is the founda-
tion of treatment for acute ST-segment–elevation 
myocardial infarction (STEMI) to improve survival. 
Based on randomized trial data, national guidelines call 
for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 
within 90 minutes of paramedic arrival for patients who 
call 9-1-1 and are transferred directly to a hospital of-
fering PCI (PCI-capable) and within 120 minutes of first 
medical contact (FMC) for patients requiring interhospital 
transfer.1,2 Despite 2 decades of evidence and 7 years 
since these guidelines were introduced, ≈30% to 50% of 
patients fail to meet these standards.3–6 Considering that 
the number of PCI-capable hospitals increased by almost 
50% and that 90% of Americans live within 60 minutes of 
a PCI-capable facility, inadequate access cannot entirely 
explain these systematic failures.7–10 Rather, the challenge 
lies within a highly fragmented health system comprising 
≈4750 acute care hospitals and >15 
000 emergency 
medical services (EMS) agencies in the United States. 
The challenge is exacerbated further by structural barri-
ers that hinder coordination between EMS providers and 
hospitals and by competition among hospitals and physi-
cian groups. Such fragmentation has hindered the devel-
opment of coordinated treatment plans and procedures, 
common data collection and feedback systems, and 
systematic approaches to identify accurately and direct 
STEMI patients to nearby catheterization laboratories for 
timely coronary intervention.11
Building on successful efforts in organizing STEMI re-
perfusion systems on a regional basis, we developed 
a demonstration project designed to implement coor-
dinated care in selected major metropolitan regions in 
the United States.12,13 Our hypothesis was that by orga-
nizing leadership, data collection, common protocols, 
and ongoing data review with timely feedback, we could 
increase the percentage of patients receiving primary 
PCI within guideline goals. Our intervention was based on 
Mission: Lifeline established approaches and supported 
by a national faculty highly experienced in organizing re-
gional STEMI care.
MethODs
The STEMI Systems Accelerator project intervention was 
organized and executed between March 2012 and July 2014 
(Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). Among 21 regions 
that applied for participation in the project, 16 met enroll-
ment criteria by the baseline data-collection quarter and were 
included. These criteria included the following: (1) 70% of PCI 
hospitals in the region were participating in the NCDR (National 
Cardiovascular Data Registry) ACTION Registry–Get With The 
Guidelines (AR-G) program; (2) there was defined organization 
of regional leadership; (3) common protocols were established 
for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with STEMI present-
ing to EMS personnel or hospitals lacking PCI facilities (PCI 
noncapable); (4) there was agreement to enter patients into 
the AR-G for 6 consecutive quarters; and (5) regional leader-
ship participated in a 2-day national training session directed 
by study faculty reviewing current evidence, guidelines, and 
approaches to regional STEMI care.
Project initiation was conducted on a rolling basis for 6 
months, and each region specified a quarter (quarters 3 or 4 
of 2012; or quarter 1 of 2013) as the baseline from which to 
assess subsequent temporal trends in outcomes. After hospi-
tal enrollment in the AR-G and the training of leadership, each 
region established common protocols as outlined above, imple-
mented the protocols, and conducted ongoing measurement 
and feedback on performance that was reflected in quarterly 
hospital letter-coded regional STEMI treatment reports. These 
protocols were guided by local experts, resources, and prac-
tices and included common criteria for establishing the diag-
nosis of STEMI, activating a catheterization laboratory with a 
single phone or radio call, treating the patient with simple initial 
regimens, and transporting the patient by preidentified mecha-
nisms. In each region, 2 project faculty members, including a 
cardiology or emergency medicine physician and a regional 
coordinator, conducted a launch meeting in collaboration with 
regional leadership.14 At these meetings, the principles of 
STEMI diagnosis and treatment, current national guidelines, 
and regional models for STEMI care were reviewed, as well as 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• This work represents the largest effort ever 
attempted in the United States to organize 
ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction care 
across multiple regions.
• The work involved 23 
809 patients treated at 
484 hospitals and 1253 emergency medical ser-
vices agencies in 16 regions, including New York 
City, Atlanta, Houston, and St. Louis, or roughly 
1 in 4 patients entered in the NCDR (National 
Cardiovascular Data Registry) ACTION Registry 
during the 18 months of measurement.
What are the clinical implications?
• Supported by thousands of colleagues and 
American Heart Association quality personnel, 
we were able to organize regional leadership and 
to coordinate treatment plans that spanned the 
majority of emergency medical services provid-
ers, emergency departments, and cardiac cath-
eterization laboratories within each region.
• These primary results show modest but sig-
nificant improvements in treatment times, with 
marked improvement in the 5 top-performing 
regions.
• These findings support continued efforts to 
implement regional ST-segment–elevation myo-
cardial infarction networks.

case studies specific to each region for patients presenting to 
EMS providers and patients requiring hospital transfer.
At each meeting, an EMS wish list was presented to encour-
age participating hospitals to support the needs of local pro-
viders. This list, a compilation of hospital requests by regional 
EMS leadership to facilitate diagnosis and treatment, included 
requests such as activating the catheterization laboratory on 
EMS call. To change the standard of care and to create sustain-
able systems, we relied on local and regional mechanisms for 
protocol implementation such as EMS annual training sessions 
or state-approved treatment protocols.
statistical analysis
The present study presents the primary outcomes and tem-
poral trends for the 24 months after initiation of the STEMI 
Systems Accelerator project. The prespecified primary out-
come was the change in the percentage of patients meet-
ing guideline goals for 6 quarters (postbaseline quarter). 
Descriptive statistics for continuous and categorical vari-
ables were described as medians (quartiles) and numbers 
(percentages), respectively. Patient characteristics and pro-
cess measures were compared by use of the Wilcoxon rank-
sum test for 2-group comparisons (the Kruskal-Wallis test 
for comparisons of >2 groups) for continuous variables and 
the Pearson χ2 or Fisher exact test, as appropriate, for cat-
egorical variables. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was 
used to assess changes in rates over time. The relationship 
between emergency department (ED) dwell time, defined as 
the period from ED arrival to cardiac catheterization labora-
tory arrival, and in-hospital mortality was assessed with logis-
tic regression modeling. The rolling 12-month (4 quarters) 
moving average of in-hospital mortality for STEMI Systems 
Accelerator hospitals versus the AR-G registry hospitals was 
presented graphically.
All statistical tests were conducted at the 0.05 significance 
level. All patients with ischemic symptoms lasting >10 min-
utes within 12 hours before arrival and an ECG with diagnostic 
ST-segment elevation were included in the analyses. In cases 
when the first ECG did not have diagnostic ST-segment eleva-
tion, door or FMC time was reset to the first diagnostic ECG. 
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, NC). The project was reviewed by the Duke 
Institutional Review Board and classified as exempt.
resUlts
Patient characteristics and Presentation
Between July 2012 and December 2013, 23 
809 pa-
tients presented with acute STEMI, including 18 
267 pa-
tients who presented directly to a PCI-capable hospital 
and 5542 who were transferred from hospitals without 
PCI capability (Table). Among patients presenting to PCI-
capable hospitals, 64% (n=11 
765) were transported 
by EMS providers, and 36% (n=6502) arrived by self-
transport. The median age of the cohort was 60 years 
(quartiles 52–70 years); 29% of patients were women; 
11% were black; and 10% were of Latino ethnicity.
The overall median time from symptom onset to FMC 
was 69 minutes. There were marked differences in time 
from symptom onset to FMC according to mode of ar-
rival to the hospital. Patients transported by EMS had a 
median time of 47 minutes from symptom onset to FMC, 
whereas self-transported patients had a median time of 
114 minutes (P<0.001). The overall rate of cardiac ar-
rest or shock on admission was 8% for both events. For 
patients presenting directly to PCI-capable hospitals, 
those transported by EMS had significantly greater rates 
of cardiac arrest (10% versus 3%) and shock on admis-
sion (11% versus 3%; P<0.001 for both comparisons) 
compared with self-transported patients. Transferred 
patients had rates of cardiac arrest (10%) and shock 
(8%) that were similar to the rates of EMS-transported 
patients. STEMI was apparent on the initial ECG for 98% 
of patients, and 95% of patients were thought to be re-
perfusion candidates by medical record review. Of eli-
gible patients, 94% were treated with reperfusion.
Primary Outcome and temporal trends
In a comparison of aggregate rates across all regions, 
there were significant but modest increases in the per-
centage of patients meeting guideline goals (time from 
FMC to device of <90 minutes for PCI-capable hospi-
tals versus <120 minutes for PCI-noncapable hospi-
tals). The proportion of patients presenting directly to a 
PCI-capable center achieving guideline goals increased 
from 59% to 61% (P=0.005; Figure 1). The subset of 
EMS-transported patients increased from 50% to 55% 
(P<0.001), and the subset of transferred patients in-
creased from 44% to 48% (P=0.002). There was sub-
stantial regional variability, and the greatest improve-
ments were seen in EMS-transported patients. For 
the 5 most improved regions among EMS-transported 
patients (Figure 2A), the proportion of those treated 
within 90 minutes increased from 45% to 57%, with an 
increase from 56% to 76% for the most improved region 
(region 4; trend test, P<0.001 for both comparisons). 
For transferred patients, the proportion treated within 
120 minutes increased from 38% to 50% (trend test, 
P<0.001), with the most improved region (region 9) 
increasing from 33% to 56% (trend test, P=0.16; Fig-
ure 2B). The proportion of patients treated within the 
guideline-recommended time intervals for each of the 
16 regions is shown in Table Ia and Ib in the online-only 
Data Supplement (EMS direct) and Table IIa and IIb in the 
online-only Data Supplement (transferred).
Overall in-hospital mortality for the time period was 
6.1%, with the highest mortality for EMS-transported 
patients (8.2%), substantially lower mortality for self-
transported patients (2.7%) presenting directly to a 
PCI-capable hospital, and an intermediate level of mor-
tality for patients transferred to PCI-capable hospitals 
(5.5%). These mortality differences correlated with

2013–quarter 3 of 2014) average, mortality for STEMI 
Systems Accelerator hospitals fell to 5.8%, whereas 
the mortality rate of the comparator national hospitals 
remained unchanged (P=0.053). Baseline clinical charac-
teristics were similar between patients admitted to STE-
MI Systems Accelerator hospitals compared with those 
admitted to non– STEMI Systems Accelerator hospitals 
over this time period, with some exceptions (Table III in 
the online-only Data Supplement). Compared with non–
STEMI Systems Accelerator hospitals, patients admitted 
to STEMI Systems Accelerator hospitals tended to have 
fewer baseline comorbidities (history of dyslipidemia, hy-
pertension, or prior revascularization) but were more like-
ly to present with cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest.
We also compared FMC-to-device and door-to-device 
times (75th percentile) by region for baseline quarter 
(Figure 4). We found that all regions had door-to-device 
times of <90 minutes for 75% of patients, whereas no 
regions achieved this standard for FMC-to-device time at 
the start of our intervention.
DiscUssiOn
This work represents the largest effort to organize STEMI 
care on a regional basis ever attempted in the United 
States, involving 484 hospitals and 1253 EMS agen-
cies in 16 regions. We found important opportunities for 
 
improvement by focusing on guideline goals of FMC to

device deployment. With the collaboration and support 
of a diverse range of healthcare professionals, we were 
able to implement regional data collection, to standardize 
reporting, and to coordinate treatment plans over 2 years 
involving approximately a quarter of all STEMI patients 
entered into the AR-G during the time period. There was 
marked variability in the time required to implement re-
gionally agreed-on plans. Despite this variability, we saw 
modest but significant improvements in guideline-man-
dated treatment times for the entire cohort and marked 
improvement in select regions. Notably, temporal trends 
in hospital mortality suggested favorable effects for this 
broad and intensive quality-improvement intervention. We 
expect these trends to continue to improve as the re-
gional protocols are implemented on a more complete 
basis and become embedded as standards of care for all 
hospitals and EMS agencies within a region.
The systems organized in the STEMI Systems Ac-
celerator project differ significantly from previously re-
ported individualized STEMI systems—such as those or-
ganized by the Minneapolis Heart Institute, Prairie Heart 
Institute, Geisinger Health System, and Mayo Clinic—in 
that these reports generally involve a few primary PCI 
hospitals within a single healthcare network.15–18 Our hy-
pothesis was that standards of care could be changed 
more readily if the majority of PCI-capable facilities and 
interventional cardiologists in a region could agree to a 
common plan, thus allowing EMS providers to diagnose 
and treat patients in an expedited fashion without con-
cern or modification according to the receiving facility or 
cardiologist. This work also is unique in that it is the first 
published intervention to rely on Mission: Lifeline regional 
reports, designed according to national guidelines, rep-
resenting aggregated data from the AR-G. These reports 
include process measures and times important to STEMI 
reperfusion (FMC starting at paramedic or first hospi-
tal arrival to hospital discharge) according to regional 
averages and hospital-specific performance.19 Hospital 
identifiers were letter coded and provided only to the 
individuals working within those hospitals.
Although much of our effort involved recruiting hos-
pitals to participate in a common regional registry and 
convincing them to allow their data to be aggregated 
in regional reports, this effort in recruiting hospital par-
ticipation appeared highly fruitful. As a result of these 
reports, we were able to identify opportunities for sys-
tematic improvement using objective data and ultimately 
to convince healthcare systems and providers to modify 
protocols and improve care. The Mission: Lifeline re-
ports and systems are currently being implemented in 
many other regions and states, including North Carolina, 
Mississippi, South Dakota, and Dallas, TX.20
Of particular note is our focus on the 2006 guidelines 
standard of FMC-to-device time rather than the Center 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services–reported door-to-
balloon measurement reflective of older standards.2 
In our project and as nationally reported, the majority 
of PCI-capable hospitals achieve door-to-device times 
of <90 minutes. As illustrated in Figure 4, for our 16 
regions in the baseline period of data collection, all re-
gions had door-to-device times of <90 minutes for 75% 
of patients, whereas no regions achieved this standard 
for FMC-to-device time. As shown, patients still can have 
lengthy delays in care not identified by the door-to-device 
metric that does not account for the time between pa-
tient presentation and hospital arrival. These delays par-
ticularly are notable for transferred patients. Thus, we 
think that a reliance on the door-to-device metric leads to 
missed opportunities for improved care. The remaining 
delays in STEMI reperfusion identified by these data and 
national registries indicate that FMC should become the 
focus of national quality metrics and efforts. A reliance 
on the door-to-balloon metric rather than FMC-to-device 
time could explain the relative lack of improvement in 
outcomes identified by efforts that ignore prehospital 
care.21 Findings that fail to identify benefit for faster treat-
ment run counter to clinical experience and clinical trial 
data that indicate the importance of timely reperfusion in 
reducing morbidity and mortality for STEMI patients.22–26
In addition to our overall findings, we present treat-
ment times for each of the 16 participating regions and 
the top 5 performing regions for both EMS direct and 
transferred patients. These data have important impli-
cations. Although the overall results were modest, we 
found significant variability between regions, including 
those that did not improve at all. The overall findings and 
the variability in improvement were related primarily to 
the speed with which regions could implement effective 
EMS and hospital transfer protocols. A large portion of 
this delay was related to the time required to persuade 
the majority of regional hospitals to participate in AR-G 
in shared reporting, execution of contracts, and initia-
tion of data collection. This highlights the challenge of 
pursuing such a large-scale implementation during a rel-
atively short time period. Nevertheless, the results from 
the most improved regions indicate that it is possible to 
 
improve reperfusion times rapidly and substantially 
within some regions according to our approach. With

only 16 regions to compare, we cannot reliably iden-
tify those regional factors associated with the greatest 
improvement among myriad local socioeconomic and 
political factors that are unique to each region. From 
our experience, we think that the regions most able to 
improve treatment times had common characteristics, 
including EMS leadership concentrated to a few domi-
nant agencies and active daily engagement by a dedi-
cated regional coordinator charged with implementing 
systematic improvements within every hospital and EMS 
agency in the region.
Most efforts to improve STEMI reperfusion times, in-
cluding this work, have focused on the time period from 
when the patient enters the medical system to the pro-
vision of primary PCI or fibrinolysis. At the same time, 
registries have indicated that the median time from 
symptom onset to presentation has remained in the 
2-hour range for at least 2 decades.27,28 An important 
observation from our study is that symptom duration 
for patients presenting to EMS was markedly shorter 
(47 minutes from symptom onset until paramedic arrival 
versus 114 minutes for self-transported patients who 
presented to EDs). This finding identifies an opportunity 
to achieve remarkably shorter total ischemic time (symp-
tom onset to reperfusion) and allows modest improve-
ments in time to result in major improvement in salvage 
(and survival) because these patients are on the steep 
part of the curve describing the association of time and 
mortality. Emergency dispatch programs that encour-
age patients to call 9-1-1 for persistent symptoms of 
potential heart attack, direct ECG-capable providers to 
chest pain calls, and enable paramedics to diagnose 
STEMI and directly activate catheterization laboratories 
are best suited to markedly decrease the time from 
symptom onset to reperfusion. Our findings of greater 
illness severity and higher mortality correspond with pri-
or work.29 We conjecture that more severe symptoms 
likely are associated with greater illness severity, which 
triggers patients and families to dispatch emergency 
medical care. Patients who self-transport to the hospital 
and experience cardiac arrest are much less likely to 
survive or be entered into the AR-G registry compared 
with those transported by EMS.
For ideal patients with recognizable symptoms who 
receive diagnostic ECGs and have local access to PCI-
capable facilities, total ischemic time can potentially be 
reduced to <2 hours, allowing treatment during the earli-
est phases of myocardial infarction when patients are 
postulated to receive the most benefit.23 Such coordi-
nated care is reflected by short ED dwell times as pa-
tients can proceed from the ambulance to waiting cath-
eterization laboratories with successful preactivation. 
The potential benefit of such coordination is supported 
further by the observation that shorter ED dwell time is 
associated highly with lower mortality (Figure II in the 
online-only Data Supplement). When EMS-transported 
patients were stratified according to ED dwell time, in-
hospital mortality was 3.6% for patients with dwell times 
<30 minutes, 7.0% for dwell times of 30 to 45 minutes, 
and 10.8% for dwell times >45 minutes. We also found 
that a greater proportion of patients met ED dwell times 
of ≤20 minutes during the course of the study (Figure III 
in the online-only Data Supplement). Although this com-
parison of ED time and mortality has great potential for 
confounding according to additional time spent treating 
patients who had life-threatening events in the ED, the re-
lationship also suggests that processes associated with 
a shorter delay in the ED such as prehospital laboratory 
activation by paramedics may improve outcomes. With 
>1700 hospitals performing coronary interventions and 
up to 90% of the US population living within a 60-minute 
drive time, abbreviated ED dwell times and timely inter-
vention should be achievable for the majority of patients 
transported by paramedics.7–10
limitations
There are limitations worth noting, the first of which in-
volves the observational nature of measurements. For 
an intervention like this, the relationship between our ef-
forts and treatment times and mortality is highly subject 
to confounding. Our finding that STEMI Systems Accel-
erator hospitals experienced a trend toward a reduction 
in unadjusted mortality in the final 4 quarters (despite 
similar baseline clinical characteristics) represents post 
hoc analyses that provide limited support to the potential 
for lower mortality in STEMI Systems regions compared 
with hospitals participating in the AR-G registry at the 
same time. Furthermore, other quality-improvement ef-
forts being conducted by participating EMS agencies 
and hospitals may have contributed to improved treat-
ment times. Because the AR-G was expanded regionally 
to institutions and patients who previously would not 
have been included, treatment times and outcomes had 
the potential to change independently of our interven-
tion if such patients faced longer delays compared with 
patients enrolled in prior quarters.25 Similarly, the global 
nature of our intervention should be considered when 
these findings are compared with outcomes for patients 
treated in hospitals participating in the AR-G that were 
not part of this project. The ≈800 hospitals participat-
ing in the registry represent a subset of >1700 hospi-
tals performing PCI, and their participation possibly in-
dicates greater focus on quality, timely treatment, and 
ultimately better outcomes compared with the universe 
of hospitals performing primary PCI. With such poten-
tial for confounding, randomized trials and observational 
registries should serve as the basis for providing timely 
reperfusion rather than findings from a rapidly expanding 
regional effort. Finally, despite the large number of pa-
tients in this study, measuring reperfusion times over 2 
years may still be underpowered to show the true impact

conclusions
This Mission: Lifeline STEMI Systems Accelerator Region-
al Systems of Care Demonstration Project represents the 
largest effort to date in the United States to organize treat-
ment for STEMI on a regional basis, involving 484 hospitals, 
1253 EMS agencies, and many thousands of healthcare 
professionals. By focusing on FMC-to-device time, regional 
consensus treatment protocols, and common data collec-
tion, we observed a significant increase in the proportion 
of patients treated within guideline goals. The speed with 
which systems could be implemented varied greatly by 
region, and the improvements demonstrated by our data, 
although modest, suggest the potential for reductions in 
total ischemic time. Corresponding with the fullest imple-
mentation of the intervention, we began to observe trends 
toward lower in-hospital mortality compared with national 
 
data toward the end of our measurement period.
