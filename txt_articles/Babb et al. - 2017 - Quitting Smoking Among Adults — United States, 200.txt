Quitting Smoking Among Adults — United States, 2000–2015
Stephen Babb, MPH1; Ann Malarcher, PhD1; Gillian Schauer, PhD1; Kat Asman, MSPH1; Ahmed Jamal, MBBS1
Quitting cigarette smoking benefits smokers at any age (1). 
Individual, group, and telephone counseling and seven Food 
and Drug Administration–approved medications increase 
quit rates (1–3). To assess progress toward the Healthy People 
2020 objectives of increasing the proportion of U.S. adults 
who attempt to quit smoking cigarettes to ≥80.0% (TU-4.1), 
and increasing recent smoking cessation success to ≥8.0% 
(TU-5.1),* CDC assessed national estimates of cessation 
behaviors among adults aged ≥18 years using data from the 
2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 National Health Interview 
Surveys (NHIS). During 2015, 68.0% of adult smokers wanted 
to stop smoking, 55.4% made a past-year quit attempt, 7.4% 
recently quit smoking, 57.2% had been advised by a health 
professional to quit, and 31.2% used cessation counseling 
and/or medication when trying to quit. During 2000–2015, 
increases occurred in the proportion of smokers who reported 
a past-year quit attempt, recently quit smoking, were advised 
to quit by a health professional, and used cessation counseling 
and/or medication (p<0.05). Throughout this period, fewer 
than one third of persons used evidence-based cessation meth-
ods when trying to quit smoking. As of 2015, 59.1% of adults 
who had ever smoked had quit. To further increase cessation, 
health care providers can consistently identify smokers, advise 
them to quit, and offer them cessation treatments (2–4). In 
addition, health insurers can increase cessation by covering and 
promoting evidence-based cessation treatments and removing 
barriers to treatment access (2,4–6).
NHIS is an annual, nationally representative, in-person survey 
of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. The NHIS 
Sample Adult core questionnaire is administered to a randomly 
selected adult (referred to as the sample adult) aged ≥18 years in

each sampled family. NHIS sample sizes and final response rates 
for sample adults for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 were 32,374 
(response rate = 72.1%), 31,428 (69.0%), 27,157 (60.8%), 
and 33,672 (55.2%), respectively. Current and former smok-
ing were defined according to Healthy People 2020 measures.† 
Persons attempting to quit included current smokers who 
stopped smoking for >1 day during the 12 months before the 
interview because they were trying to quit and former smokers 
who had quit during the past year. Former smokers who last 
smoked 6–12 months ago were considered to have achieved 
recent cessation success. Every 5 years, a supplemental cancer-
control questionnaire is administered to NHIS sample adult 
respondents; the questionnaire contains questions on interest 
in quitting smoking, receipt of a health professional’s advice 
to quit, and use of cessation counseling and/or medication. 
Data were adjusted for differences in the probability of selec-
tion and nonresponse, and were weighted to provide nationally 
representative estimates. Logistic regression was conducted to 
analyze trends during 2000–2015. Both linear and quadratic 
terms were initially applied to all models. If the quadratic term 
was not significant, the linear model was used.
In 2015, 68.0% of all current smokers reported that they 
wanted to stop smoking completely. Smaller proportions of 
smokers aged ≥65 years (53.7%) and 18–24 years (62.3%) 
were interested in quitting than were smokers aged 25–44 years 
(72.7%) (Table 1). The prevalence of past-year quit attempts 
increased during 2000–2015 (p<0.05 based on quadratic trend 
analysis), and was 55.4% in 2015, which was the time point 
when prevalence was highest (Figure). Past-year quit attempts 
decreased with increasing age. Higher prevalences of past-year 
quit attempts were reported by Asians (69.4%) and blacks 
(63.4%) than by whites (53.3%) (Table 1).
The prevalence of recent cessation increased during 2000–
2015 (p<0.05 based on linear trend analysis), and was 7.4% 
in 2015 (Figure). Recent cessation generally increased with 
increasing level of educational attainment, and smokers with 
private health insurance (9.4%) reported a higher prevalence of 
recent cessation than did smokers who were uninsured (5.2%) 
or enrolled in Medicaid (including persons with dual Medicaid/
Medicare eligibility)§ (5.9%) (Table 1). As of 2015, among 
adults who had ever smoked, 59.1% (52.8 million) had quit.
During 2000–2015, increases were reported in receipt of 
advice from a health professional to quit: prevalence was 57.2% 
in 2015 (p<0.05 based on quadratic trend analysis); prevalence 
was highest in 2005 and 2015, with a decrease observed in 2010 
§ A secondary analysis found that the prevalence of reported cessation behaviors 
for Medicaid enrollees did not change substantially when persons with dual 
Medicaid/Medicare eligibility were removed from the Medicaid coverage category.
† To determine smoking status, respondents were asked, “Have you smoked at 
least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?” Those who answered “yes” were asked, 
“Do you now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?” Current 
smokers were those who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime 
and, at the time of the interview, reported smoking every day or some days. 
Former smokers were those who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes during 
their lifetime but currently did not smoke. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/

(Figure). Smokers aged 45–64 years (65.7%) and ≥65 years 
(65.7%) reported a higher prevalence of receiving advice to quit 
than did smokers aged 18–24 years (44.4%) and 25–44 years 
(49.8%) (Table 2). Lower prevalences of receiving advice to 
quit were reported by Asian (34.2%), American Indian/Alaska 
Native (38.1%), and Hispanic (42.2%) smokers than by white 
smokers (60.2%); and by uninsured smokers (44.1%) than by 
smokers with any type of insurance (range = 56.8%–69.2%). 
Smokers reporting a disability/limitation or serious psychologi-
cal distress reported a higher prevalence of receiving advice to 
quit than did smokers without these conditions (71.8% and 
70.2%, respectively, vs 53.6% and 55.7%).
Use of cessation counseling and/or medication among smok-
ers who were trying to quit increased during 2000–2005 from 
21.9% to 29.1%, with no change in 2010 (31.7%) or 2015 
(31.2%) (p<0.05 based on quadratic trend analysis) (Figure). 
The prevalence of use of counseling and/or medication 
increased with age through age 64 years (Table 2). Hispanics 
and Asians reported a lower prevalence of using counseling 
and/or medication (19.2% and 20.5%, respectively) than did 
whites (34.3%), as did uninsured smokers (21.4%) compared 
with smokers with any type of insurance other than Medicare 
and Medicare Advantage (range = 32.1%–36.0%). The 
prevalence of using counseling and/or medication was higher

varenicline, 2.7% used bupropion, and 2.4% used nicotine 
spray or inhaler.
Discussion
In 2015, approximately two thirds of cigarette smokers were 
interested in quitting, and slightly more than half reported 
receiving advice to quit from a health professional and mak-
ing a past-year quit attempt. However, fewer than one third of 
smokers who tried to quit used proven cessation treatments, 
and fewer than one in 10 smokers overall quit successfully in 
the past year. Approximately three in five adults who had ever 
smoked had quit. To enhance cessation rates, it is critical for 
health care providers to consistently identify smokers, advise 
them to quit, and offer evidence-based cessation treatments, 
and for insurers to cover and promote the use of these treat-
ments and remove barriers to accessing them (2–6).
During 2000–2015, modest but statistically significant 
increases occurred in the prevalence of past-year quit attempts

“Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does [person] have difficulty doing errands alone, such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping?” Any 
disability/limitation was defined as a “yes” response pertaining to at least one of the disabilities/limitations listed (i.e., vision, hearing, cognition, movement,

and ‘All of the time’ (score = 4). Responses were summed over the six questions; respondents with a score ≥13 were coded as having serious psychological distress, 
and respondents with a score <13 were coded as not having serious psychological distress. Excludes 1,416 persons whose psychological distress was unknown.

(from 49.2% to 55.4%), recent smoking cessation (5.7% to 
7.4%), receipt of health professional advice to quit smoking 
(52.4% to 57.2%), and use of cessation counseling and/or 
medication (21.9% to 31.2%). However, recent smoking 
cessation remains low, and little progress has been made since 
2005 toward increasing receipt of advice to quit and use of 
counseling and/or medication. Use of cessation counseling 
and medication increases quit rates, especially when they 
are combined (2,3,7): combined behavioral and pharmaco-
therapy interventions increase cessation by 82%, compared 
with minimal intervention or usual care (7). Use of cessation 
medications is appropriate for most adult smokers, with the 
exception of pregnant women, light smokers (i.e., persons 
who smoke < 5-10 cigarettes daily), and persons with specific 
medical contraindications (2,3). The low prevalence of recent 
cessation likely is related in part to low use of evidence-based 
cessation treatments. Because approximately 70% of smokers 
see a physician annually, and even brief physician advice to 
quit increases quit rates (2), opportunities exist to increase 
cessation rates through health care system changes and other 
population-based strategies (2–4).

Wellbutrin) in the past year among current smokers who tried to quit in the past year or used when stopped smoking among former smokers who quit in the past 
2 years. For 2005, the list included a nicotine tablet and excluded varenicline, as it was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration until 2006. For 2000, the list 
included a stop smoking program and excluded a stop smoking class or support group, nicotine lozenge (not approved by the Food and Drug Administration until 
2002), and varenicline.

Observed disparities were consistent with those reported 
in previous studies (8). In 2015, smokers who were aged 
<45 years, Hispanic, Asian, with an Associate’s or higher degree, 
lived in the Northeast, had private health insurance, or had 
no serious psychological distress met the Healthy People 2020 
target for recent cessation (≥8.0%). Disparities in cessation 
behaviors by race/ethnicity might be partly explained by dif-
ferences in tobacco use behaviors, health care utilization, access 
to cessation treatments, and knowledge about these treatments 
(1,2,4). Disparities by insurance status in receipt of advice to 
quit (44.1% for uninsured smokers versus 56.8% for smokers 
with private insurance), use of cessation counseling and/or 
medication (21.4% for uninsured smokers versus 32.1% for 
smokers with private insurance), and recent cessation (5.2% 
for uninsured smokers versus 9.4% for smokers with private 
insurance) are likely attributable, in part, to a lack of access 
to cessation treatments among the uninsured (2,4,5). Higher 
prevalence of receiving a health professional’s advice to quit 
and use of counseling and/or medication among smokers with 
serious psychological distress might be related to greater use

of health care as well as greater tobacco dependence in this

Changes in the U.S. health care system could have con-
tributed to this report’s findings. By increasing the number 
of adults with health insurance (9) and requiring improved 
cessation coverage by commercial insurance and Medicaid 
(5), the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act¶ might 
have contributed to increases in the number of smokers who 
attempt to quit, use proven cessation treatments, and suc-
cessfully quit (4,5). Improved cessation insurance coverage,

* Received advice from a medical doctor, dentist, or other health professional to quit smoking or to quit using other kinds of tobacco, among current and former 
cigarette smokers who quit in the past 12 months. The analysis was limited to current and former cigarette smokers who had seen a doctor or other health 
professional in the past year.
 
† Used one-on-one counseling, a stop smoking clinic, class, or support group, and/or a telephone help line or quitline during the past year among current smokers 
who tried to quit during the past year or used when stopped smoking among former smokers who quit during the past 2 years.
 
§ Used nicotine patch, nicotine gum or lozenge, nicotine-containing nasal spray or inhaler, varenicline (U.S. trade name Chantix), and/or bupropion (including 
trade names Zyban and Wellbutrin) during the past year among current smokers who tried to quit during the past year or used when stopped smoking among

Interview Survey (NHIS) instrument was created, the poverty thresholds used in the 2015 NHIS were estimated from several sources: weighted average Census 
poverty thresholds from 2013; the average Consumer Price Index from 2013; actual Consumer Price Index values for January–July 2014; and projected Consumer 
Price Index values for August–December 2014.

of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Limitations in performing activities of daily living was defined based on response to the question “Does 
[person] have difficulty dressing or bathing?,” and limitations in performing instrumental activities of daily living was defined based on response to the question, 
“Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does [person] have difficulty doing errands alone, such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping?” Any 
disability/limitation was defined as a “yes” response pertaining to at least one of the disabilities/limitations listed (i.e., vision, hearing, cognition, movement, 
activities of daily living, or instrumental activities of daily living). In 2015, the American Community Survey questions were asked of a random half of the respondents 
from the 2015 Person File. Excludes four persons whose disability status was unknown.
 
**** The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale is a series of six questions that asks about feelings of sadness, nervousness, restlessness, worthlessness, hopelessness, 
and feeling like everything is an effort during the past 30 days. Participants were asked to respond on a Likert Scale ranging between ‘None of the Time’ (score = 0) 
and ‘All of the time’ (score = 4). Responses were summed over the six questions; respondents with a score ≥13 were coded as having serious psychological distress, 
and respondents with a score <13 were coded as not having serious psychological distress. Excludes 1,416 persons whose psychological distress was unknown.

together with new health care delivery and payment models 
and quality measures, might have contributed to increases in 
health professional advice to quit since 2010 (4,5).
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, cigarette smoking and cessation-related measures 
were self-reported without validation by biochemical testing, 
and might be subject to social desirability bias. However, self-
reported smoking status correlates with serum cotinine levels 
(10). Second, because NHIS does not include institutionalized 
populations and persons in the military, results are not generaliz-
able to these groups. Finally, lower NHIS response rates might

result in nonresponse bias. The extent to which nonresponse 
might have affected the results reported here is unknown.  
Funding state tobacco control programs, including state quit-
lines, at CDC-recommended levels, increasing tobacco prices, 
implementing comprehensive smoke-free policies, conducting 
anti-tobacco mass media campaigns, and enhancing access to 
quitting assistance can increase tobacco cessation and reduce 
tobacco-related disease and death (1,4). Opportunities exist 
for insurers and employers to improve coverage and increase 
use of cessation treatments and for health systems to integrate 
cessation interventions into clinical care (1,4,5).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Quitting cigarette smoking benefits smokers at any age. 
Cessation counseling and medications each improve smokers’ 
chances of quitting, and have an even greater effect when 
combined. However, use of counseling and medications 
remains low.
What is added by this report?
Approximately two thirds of cigarette smokers are interested in 
quitting, and in 2015, approximately half of smokers reported 
receiving advice to quit from a health professional and making 
a quit attempt in the past year. However, fewer than one third of 
smokers who tried to quit used evidence-based cessation 
treatments, and fewer than one in 10 smokers overall success-
fully quit in the past year. As of 2015, approximately three in five 
adults who had ever smoked had quit.  
What are the implications for public health practice?
Health care professionals can help smokers quit by consistently 
identifying patients who smoke, advising them to quit, and 
offering them cessation treatments. Health insurers can help 
smokers quit by covering proven cessation treatments with 
minimal barriers and promoting their use. States can help 
smokers quit by implementing population-based policy 
interventions and anti-tobacco mass media campaigns, and by 
funding comprehensive state tobacco control programs, 
including state quitlines, at CDC-recommended levels.
