Disease

Lyme disease prevails as the most commonly transmitted tick-borne infection in the United States, and serologic evaluation for
antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi remains the recommended modality for diagnosis. This review presents a brief historical per-
spective on the evolution of serologic assays for Lyme disease and provides a summary of the performance characteristics for the
currently recommended two-tiered testing algorithm (TTTA). Additionally, a recently proposed alternative to the traditional
TTTA is discussed, and novel methodologies, including immuno-PCR and metabolic profiling for Lyme disease, are outlined.
T
he 2014 statistics for Lyme disease (LD) in the United States
are staggering; more than 30,000 confirmed or probable cases
were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), nearly 300,000 presumed cases went unreported, and ap-
proximately 2.4 million specimens were submitted for LD testing
with an associated cost of approximately $492 million (1, 2). Since
endorsement of the two-tiered testing algorithm (TTTA) for di-
agnosing LD by the CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the
Infectious Diseases Society of America, and other health agencies
in 1995, 51 assays from more than 20 manufacturers have received
FDA clearance for this purpose. Notably, while the detection of
numerous infectious agents and syndromes has improved with
the advent of molecular-based assays, many of which have re-
ceived FDA clearance, and as the field of clinical microbiology
enters the “-omics” realm of diagnostic testing, all of the available
in vitro diagnostic products for LD remain based on serologic
detection of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (herein
referred to as B. burgdorferi).
This review provides a brief historical perspective on the evo-
lution of serologic methods for LD diagnosis, discusses perfor-
mance characteristics of the recommended TTTA, presents possi-
ble amendments to the current format, and concludes with a
summary of recently described, alternative methods for the diag-
nosis of LD. For detailed discussion of other serologic assays and
nonserologic techniques, including molecular methods and cul-
ture for B. burgdorferi, see previous reviews (3, 4).
FACTORS AFFECTING SEROLOGIC TEST PERFORMANCE FOR
LYME DISEASE
The diagnostic accuracy of serologic assays is dependent on mul-
tiple factors, including the timing of specimen collection with re-
spect to disease state, the kinetics of antibody expansion to the
particular infectious agent, the selection of appropriate immuno-
dominant target peptides or antigens, and the assay methodology,
although this is not an exhaustive list.
Following transmission of B. burgdorferi by an infected Ixodes
species tick, the innate and adaptive immune branches are stimu-
lated. Early localized LD (stage 1) is classically defined as the pres-
ence of an expanding erythema migrans (EM) rash appearing at
the tick bite site an average of 7 to 14 days (range, 3 to 32 days)
after infection in up to 80% of individuals (5). EM is a direct result
of released proinflammatory markers, inoculum dose, and strain
pathogenicity. While humoral immunity is likewise stimulated at
this stage, only 10% to 50% of patients with culture-confirmed
early LD (i.e., EM rash of �7 days’ duration) will have a detectable
antibody response (3, 6). For this reason, serologic evaluation for
antibodies to B. burgdorferi following removal of an attached tick
or soon after an EM rash is noticed is not recommended; results
are often negative and therefore of limited clinical utility. While
convalescent testing following the completion of antimicrobial
therapy may be performed to demonstrate seroconversion, some
individuals may remain seronegative, presumably due to insuffi-
cient exposure of the humoral immune system to the spirochete
(5, 7).
In the absence of treatment, infection with B. burgdorferi can
progress to early disseminated disease (stage 2) weeks to months
following transmission and is characterized most commonly by
neurologic manifestations (e.g., meningitis, cranial neuropathy,
and radiculoneuropathy) or, rarely, carditis (e.g., atrioventricular
heart block) (3). Late LD (stage 3) typically occurs months follow-
ing infection, and in the United States, patients most often present
with intermittent or persistent arthritis in one or more large joints.
Importantly, the humoral immune response progressively ma-
tures as the infection develops, and as a result, the clinical sensi-
tivity of serologic assays during these later stages of disease is im-
proved over that of testing at earlier time points.
SEROLOGIC TESTING FOR LYME DISEASE: A HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVE
The TTTA for LD emerged from a need to standardize the testing
methods used and the interpretive criteria applied toward those
tests. Before 1995, the methods used to detect B. burgdorferi-spe-
cific antibodies were quite varied and included enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on spirochete whole-cell son-
icate (WCS) material, partially purified or recombinant proteins
from different B. burgdorferi strains, indirect immunofluores-
cence assays (IFAs), and Western blot (WB) analysis to detect total

 or individual IgM and IgG class antibodies. Each of these assays
had their own unique interpretive criteria. Despite FDA clearance
of many of these assays, published proficiency testing studies re-
vealed significant result heterogeneity between the different com-
mercially available kits and, perhaps most worrisome, appreciable
intralaboratory variability for duplicate samples. One such study
demonstrated that, among the 45 participating laboratories, up to
55% failed to detect antibodies to B. burgdorferi in sera from pa-
tients with clinically characterized LD who were seropositive ac-
cording to a reference IFA (8). Precision was likewise shown to be
poor; one laboratory documented a coefficient of variation of
more than 120% for a sample tested in triplicate, and another
proficiency sample tested across the 45 laboratories had a repro-
ducibility rate of only 27%.
A number of studies were subsequently undertaken to better
understand the dominant antigenic determinants of B. burgdorferi
and to better define the kinetics of the humoral immune response.
Two seminal studies emerged during this period. These studies
evaluated ELISA methodologies using WCS material, but from
different B. burgdorferi strains, and proposed specific IgM and IgG
WB interpretive criteria. The first of these studies was by Dressler
et al. (9), who used sera from patients with clinically characterized
LD and control patients (e.g., diagnosed with infections or syn-
dromes resembling LD) to determine the optimal WB banding
patterns for IgM and IgG class antibodies to B. burgdorferi. They
established that, for early LD, IgM reactivity to at least two of eight
B. burgdorferi antigens led to a sensitivity and specificity of 32%
and 100%, respectively, and that IgG reactivity to at least 5 of 10
antigens provided high diagnostic accuracy for LD in patients with
at least 1 week of symptoms (sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 95%).
The second study, by Engstrom et al., involved 55 patients on
antibiotic therapy for clinically characterized LD who were serially
sampled and monitored for antibody expansion over a 1-year pe-
riod. This group determined that reactivity at two of three anti-
gens in the IgM WB analysis improved sensitivity to 58.5% during
early LD, and IgG seroreactivity at two of five bands provided
optimal sensitivity during early (54.6%) and late (100%) LD (10).
The Dressler et al. and Engstrom et al. publications also docu-
mented higher specificities in the IgM and IgG WB analyses com-
pared with those in their respective WCS ELISAs, and they both
agreed that, despite optimization of WB banding patterns, false-
positive results can still occur in healthy individuals and in pa-
tients with diseases mimicking LD (e.g., syphilis, rheumatoid ar-
thritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.).
Collectively, however, these two studies laid the foundation for
the currently recommended TTTA for detection of antibodies to
B. burgdorferi (Fig. 1). The TTTA begins with a first-tier screening
ELISA for IgM and IgG class antibodies (either separately or to-
gether) or IFA (uncommonly used). Unless testing was performed
soon after symptom onset or exposure, no further testing is war-
ranted for patients with negative screening results. Specimens
with a positive or equivocal result in the first-tier assay require
confirmatory testing by B. burgdorferi-specific IgM and IgG WB
analysis to ensure specificity. An important caveat to this algo-
rithm is that, for patients with symptom duration of more than 30
days, IgM WB testing should not be performed or, if performed,
the result should not be considered, because IgM seroreactivity
can remain detectable for months to years following disease reso-
lution (11). Interpretive criteria for results of WB analysis derive
from a combination of recommendations from Dressler et al. and
Engstrom et al.; IgM WB positivity adheres to the Engstrom et al.
criteria, which require antibody reactivity to at least two of three
antigens (i.e., p23 [OspC], p39 [BmpA], and p41 [FlaB]), whereas
IgG positivity is based on the Dressler et al. criteria, which require
antibody reactivity to at least five of 10 bands (i.e., p18, p23, p28,
p30, p39, p41, p45, p58, p66, and p93). Finally, although offered

 through certain Lyme disease specialty laboratories, Western blot
analysis for IgA class antibodies to B. burgdorferi has not been well
studied, and the clinical utility of testing for this analyte remains
unclear.
While the following discussion focuses on the diagnosis of sys-
temic Lyme disease, it is important to note that for patients with
suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis, the TTTA does not apply to
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Instead, diagnosis is based on the pres-
ence of compatible clinical features and demonstration of B. burg-
dorferi-specific intrathecal antibody synthesis (12, 13). Briefly,
CSF and normalized serum are tested by a B. burgdorferi-specific
ELISA, and intrathecal antibody production is established by cal-
culating an antibody index (AI) from the ELISA results. The AI
value allows for discrimination between true intrathecal antibody
production and passive transfer of B. burgdorferi-specific antibod-
ies across the blood-brain barrier or blood contamination of CSF
due to a traumatic lumbar puncture.
PERFORMANCE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
CURRENT
TWO-TIERED TESTING ALGORITHM
First- and second-tier serologic assays for the detection of anti-
bodies to LD have undergone significant modification over the
past 10 to 15 years that led to improved clinical performance com-
pared with that of the previous methods.
ELISAs using B. burgdorferi WCS material continue to be per-
formed in many clinical laboratories today. A recent study by
Wormser et al. evaluated more than 500 patients with clinically
characterized LD and more than 2,000 control subjects and
showed that, despite high overall sensitivity for LD (75% for stage
1 and 98% for stages 2/3), when used alone, the WCS ELISA can
lead to falsely reactive results in approximately 4% of healthy in-
dividuals and in nearly 11% of patients presenting with symptoms
similar to those of LD (Table 1) (14). This lack of specificity is due
primarily to antibody cross-reactivity with proteins in the WCS
ELISA that are conserved between B. burgdorferi and other, more
commonly encountered bacteria (e.g., heat shock [p66] and fla-
gellar [p41] proteins). While supplemental testing of positive and
equivocal WCS ELISA results by WB analysis, as recommended by
the TTTA, improves specificity to greater than 99%, sensitivity
decreases to 35.2% and 77.3% to 96% for early and later stages of
LD, respectively.
In an effort to improve performance characteristics of the first-
tier screening assay and the TTTA overall, contemporary ELISAs
were developed using select recombinant proteins and/or select
synthetic peptides from immunodominant regions within those
proteins that are specific to and conserved among the B. burgdor-
feri sensu lato (sl) complex members (e.g., B. burgdorferi, Borrelia
garinii, and Borrelia afzelii). While many different proteins have
been investigated, the two most commonly targeted ones are both
expressed on the surface of B. burgdorferi and include the VlsE
(variable major protein [Vmp]-like sequence expressed; 35 kDa)
and OspC (outer-surface protein C; 23 kDa) proteins.
VlsE is composed of alternating variable (VR1 to VR6) and
invariable (IR1 to IR6) regions, flanked by conserved domains at
both the amino and carboxy termini (15). This lipoprotein under-
goes extensive recombination at the variable regions, likely as a
means of immune evasion, is expressed by the spirochete only
after transmission to the mammalian host, and induces a strong
and specific immune response during the course of infection. A
commercially available, FDA-cleared chemiluminescent immu-
noassay (CLI) for total IgM and IgG antibodies to recombinant
VlsE (rVlsE) was evaluated by Ledue et al. using two CDC panels
of well-characterized sera from patients with LD (n � 102) and
separate, matched controls (n � 807). While the authors reported
a high sensitivity (70% to 100%) for each stage of LD and im-
proved specificity in sera from healthy blood donors (99.5%)
compared with that in the WCS ELISA alone, the accuracy of the
rVlsE CIA approached only 94% among individuals with other
bacterial or viral infections (Table 1) (16).
Among the different VlsE IRs, IR6 was identified as an immu-
nodominant epitope for B. burgdorferi sl, and an ELISA using a
recombinant 26-amino acid peptide of this region, referred to as
C6, was cleared by the FDA for use in 2003. The C6 peptide pri-
marily elicits an IgG class antibody response, but when used as a
standalone assay and compared with the TTTA using a WCS
ELISA (WCS TTTA), the C6 ELISA showed significantly im-
proved sensitivity for early LD (66.5% versus 35.2%, respectively;
P � 0.001) and high sensitivity for later stages of LD (Table 1).
Although the specificity of the C6 ELISA alone is similar to that of
the WCS TTTA for patients with a non-LD infection or condition
(99.5% versus 99.2%, respectively), the WCS TTTA significantly
outperforms the C6 ELISA among healthy blood donors (99.5%
versus 98.8%, respectively; P � 0.002) (14, 17). While a difference
in specificity of 0.8% may appear trivial, when considering the
volume of serologic tests that are performed annually, the use of
the C6 ELISA alone would lead to a large number of inaccurate
results in a field that is already infiltrated with diagnostic assays of
questionable validity (18). Use of the C6 ELISA as part of a TTTA
provides a specificity that is similar to that of the WCS TTTA, but
not surprisingly, sensitivity, particularly for early LD, is lost
(34.5%) (Table 1).
The second commonly targeted antigen, OspC, is an immuno-
dominant protein required for the transmission of LD-associated
Borrelia from the tick vector to the mammalian host. Because

 OspC is expressed on the surface of B. burgdorferi before infection,
it is available for immune stimulation sooner than VlsE (19).
OspC is often used for B. burgdorferi strain typing due to the high
level of sequence variability, but it also exhibits a well-conserved
10-amino acid peptide sequence at the carboxy terminus
(pepC10) (20). Evaluation of a kinetic ELISA using pepC10 as
the sole antigen showed low sensitivity for early (47.3%) and
later (10.3% to 46.1%) stages of LD, likely because only IgM
class antibodies were targeted by this assay. Notably, however,
combination of pepC10 with rVlsE in a single ELISA signifi-
cantly improved performance to 67.2% and 88.5% to 94.1% for
early and later stages of Lyme disease, respectively (Table 1)
(20). The specificities of the WCS TTTA and the VlsE/pepC10
kinetic ELISA were similar (�98%), and a commercially avail-
able ELISA using these two antigens (rVlsE1/pepC10) was
cleared by the FDA in 2013. Due to its ability to stimulate an
early immune response, OspC continues to be a protein of
interest with respect to LD diagnostics. A novel peptide region
of OspC, OspC1, was recently identified, and preliminary data
suggest it results in improved performance for the detection of
early LD compared with that of pepC10 alone (62.1% versus
49.0%, respectively) (21). Further studies are needed, however,
to confirm these findings and to better define a role for these
antigens as markers of LD.
Despite the development and optimization of new first-tiered
screening assays, the specificities of these contemporary ELISAs
do not reach that of the TTTA; therefore, supplemental WB anal-
ysis is still required. However, these second-tiered assays are asso-
ciated with a number of limitations, the most important of which
is the decrease in sensitivity observed for patients with early LD, an
issue that is especially problematic for individuals who present
with an atypical EM rash or lack dermatologic evidence of LD
entirely. This phenomenon can be attributed in part to differential
protein expression between B. burgdorferi isolated from a mam-
malian host and in vitro cultured B. burgdorferi spirochetes, which
are the form used for WB production. For example, VlsE is largely
suppressed in cultured B. burgdorferi, and therefore, antibodies to
VlsE detected by a screening ELISA may be unconfirmed by WB
analysis (22). The reliance on WBs is further complicated by the
subjectivity associated with visual interpretation of band intensi-
ties, which is particularly challenging for IgM WBs. Due to the
requirement that only two of three bands be present for an IgM
WB to be considered positive, and one of these bands can be the
well-conserved flagellar FlaB (p41) protein, IgM blots are often
overread, which leads to a high false-positivity rate (23). These
limitations, alongside the generally laborious nature of the meth-
odology, have led to nearly 75% of laboratories that perform LD
testing to use a reference laboratory for supplemental WB analysis
(17). Some of these challenges have been overcome with the
implementation of automated instruments for the blotting
process, the availability of software for densitometric measure-
ment of band intensity to provide more objective band inter-
pretation, and the development of B. burgdorferi immunoblots
(i.e., nitrocellulose membranes onto which recombinant antigens
are “stamped”) to minimize the background and nonspecific re-
activity associated with classic WBs (24). However, these im-
provements are associated with significant costs that may be in-
surmountable by local hospital laboratories.
AN ALTERNATIVE TTTA?
In an effort to overcome these obstacles, a modified TTTA based
on two sequential ELISAs, rather than supplemental testing by
immunoblot analysis, was proposed by multiple groups. Most re-
cently, Branda et al. evaluated a TTTA using a WCS ELISA and the
C6 ELISA as the first- and second-tier assays, respectively (2-
ELISA TTTA). Compared with the traditional TTTA (WCS ELISA
and WB analysis), confirmatory testing of positive or equivocal
WCS ELISA results by the C6 assay yielded improved sensitivities
in patients with stage 1 LD (42.1% versus 52.6%, respectively) and
in those with stage 2 LD (73% versus 100%, respectively) and
equivalent performance in patients with late LD (Table 2) (17).
Intriguingly, the authors reported identical specificities for the
2-ELISA and the traditional TTTAs in healthy blood donors
(99.4%) and among patients with a non-LD associated condition
(100%) (Table 2). Finally, using hypothetical LD prevalence rates
ranging from 0.5% to 2%, the authors showed that the 2-ELISA
algorithm had positive predictive values (41% to 74%) that were
consistently higher than those of either the traditional TTTA (36%
to 70%) or the C6 ELISA alone (18% to 47%) (17). This same
group subsequently showed that this 2-ELISA approach (WCS/
C6) is 27.1% to 44.0% less expensive than TTTAs using a supple-
mental immunoblot assay (25). Collectively, these data suggest
that a 2-ELISA testing algorithm provides improved clinical per-
formance and is a more cost-effective alternative to the traditional
TTTA for the diagnosis of LD.
NOVEL APPROACHES FOR LD DETECTION
Improvements in the diagnostic accuracy of immunoassays for
the detection of LD continue to be pursued through the develop-
ment of multiplex assays for “broad-range” antibody detection,
the combination of serologic and molecular techniques, and the
identification of specific metabolic biosignatures. For some of
these methods, promising proof-of-principle studies have been
published, and their results are reviewed briefly here.
Over the past decade, it has become apparent that antibody
detection of a single or even a few B. burgdorferi proteins by means
of a standard ELISA does not provide sufficient sensitivity for the
diagnosis of early LD. To overcome this, multiple groups have
identified additional B. burgdorferi sl antigens and used them as

 part of larger multiplex panels on contemporary immunoassay
platforms for antibody detection. Lahey et al. identified 10 unique
B. burgdorferi antigens, including previously described (e.g., OspC
and FlaB) and novel peptides, and developed a multiplex panel
using Luminex technology (26). With the requirement that reac-
tivity be present for at least two of the 10 antigens for a sample to
be considered positive, this group showed equivalent specificity
(100%) among healthy subjects and significantly improved sensi-
tivity for early LD compared with that of the traditional TTTA
(87.5% versus 67.5%, respectively; P � 0.05).
In an effort to improve the limit of detection for ELISAs, an
immuno-PCR (iPCR) assay was recently developed and evaluated
for the detection of antibodies to the B. burgdorferi C6 peptide
(27). iPCR harnesses the amplification property of PCR to in-
crease the sensitivity of standard ELISAs by 100- to 10,000-fold;
this technique has already been developed for the detection of
multiple bacterial and viral antigens (28). Briefly, the methodol-
ogy for the C6 iPCR study is as follows. Synthetic C6 peptide is
coupled to magnetic beads, which are sequentially incubated with
human serum and a secondary, reporter antibody. The reporter
antibody is conjugated to an oligonucleotide tag via a streptavi-
din-biotin bond, and the detection of host antibody to C6 is
achieved by real-time PCR of the oligonucleotide tag directly on
this immune complex (i.e., magnetic bead-C6 antigen-host anti-
body-reporter antibody-oligonucleotide tag). The authors re-
ported strong correlation between the C6 ELISA and the iPCR
assay and higher sensitivity of the iPCR among 18 patients with
early LD (58% versus 75%, respectively). This novel approach and
encouraging preliminary data warrant further analysis with stud-
ies in larger cohorts.
Finally, as an alternative to classic antibody detection for LD,
the CDC, along with multiple academic and clinical collaborators,
recently evaluated the applicability of metabolomics, defined as
the evaluation of low-molecular-weight (�1,500-Da) biomol-
ecules, for the diagnosis of early LD (29). An individual’s baseline
metabolic profile can be altered by a variety of environmental
stressors, and the detection of changes to this baseline may lay the
foundation for the development of a novel diagnostic tool for
infections, including LD. Using liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry and statistical modeling, Molins et al. defined a met-
abolic profile of 44 biosignatures, primarily lipid and lipophilic
molecules, present in patients with early LD and compared the
performance of this panel with that of the traditional and 2-ELISA
TTTAs. The metabolomics assay outperformed both TTTAs with
respect to sensitivity (88% versus 43% to 48%, respectively; P �
0.0001) and showed statistically equivalent specificities among
healthy controls and individuals with a non-LD condition (29).
Although certain challenges with the methodology exist, on the
basis of the preliminary data, metabolomic profiling appears to
hold promise as a future tool for the diagnosis of LD.

Elitza (Elli) S. Theel graduated with a B.S. in
biology from the University of Notre Dame in
Notre Dame, IN, and earned her Ph.D. in med-
ical microbiology and immunology at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, WI,
in 2010. She completed a postdoctoral clinical
microbiology fellowship in 2012 at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, MN, and remained on staff
as the director of the Infectious Disease Serol-
ogy Laboratory and as an assistant professor of
laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo
Clinic. Her research interests revolve around developing and evaluating se-
rologic markers for the detection of difficult-to-cultivate or otherwise de-
tecting infectious agents, including Borrelia burgdorferi and common and
uncommon arboviruses.
