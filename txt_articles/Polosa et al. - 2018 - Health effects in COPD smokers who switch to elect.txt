Background: Health effects of electronic cigarette (EC) use in patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) are largely unexplored.
Aim: We present findings from a long-term prospective assessment of respiratory parameters 
in a cohort of COPD patients who ceased or substantially reduced conventional cigarette use 
with ECs.
Methods: We prospectively re-evaluated COPD exacerbations, spirometric indices, subjective 
assessments (using the COPD Assessment Tool [CAT] scores), physical activity (measured by 
the 6-minute walk distance [6MWD]), and conventional cigarette use in EC users with COPD 
who were retrospectively assessed previously. Baseline measurements prior to switching to EC 
use were compared to follow-up visits at 12, 24, and 36 months. Age- and sex-matched regularly 
smoking COPD patients who were not using ECs were included as reference (control) group.
Results: Complete data were available from 44 patients. Compared to baseline in the EC-user 
group, there was a marked decline in the use of conventional cigarettes. Although there was no 
change in lung function, significant improvements in COPD exacerbation rates, CAT scores, 
and 6MWD were observed consistently in the EC user group over the 3-year period (p0.01). 
Similar findings were noted in COPD EC users who also smoked conventional cigarettes 
(“dual users”).
Conclusion: The present study suggests that EC use may ameliorate objective and subjective 
COPD outcomes and that the benefits gained may persist long-term. EC use may reverse some 
of the harm resulting from tobacco smoking in COPD patients.

Introduction
Smoking is an important cause of avoidable premature mortality globally, mainly due 
to lung cancer, acute fatal complications of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).1,2 COPD is a progressive condition 
typified by ongoing airway inflammatory and remodeling responses resulting in respira-
tory symptoms, progressive lung function decline, respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, 
and death.3–5 The unique airway inflammatory response in COPD is largely assumed 
to be due to chronic exposure to a range of smoke toxicants.6,7
Stopping conventional tobacco use is the only evidence-based strategy that has 
been reported to enhance COPD prognosis.8,9 Prolonged abstinence from smoking 
attenuates the yearly lung function decline and respiratory symptoms and enhances 
health status.10–12 Moreover, smoking cessation decreases the chances of developing 
and consequently perishing from tobacco-related illnesses.13

Although reducing the negative health burden of tobacco 
smoking is a clear priority for COPD patients who smoke, 
high failure rates are frequently reported in these patients.14,15 
Moreover, approved smoking cessation therapies (ie, nicotine 
replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline) only seem 
to promote modest enduring cessation in smoking COPD 
patients.16 This is because the subjects may find it challeng-
ing to completely stop using nicotine and/or require longer 
treatment regimen, support, or nicotine maintenance to pos-
sibly aid in attaining continued abstinence from smoking. 
For these individuals, tobacco harm reduction (THR), that 
is, the use of combustion-free nicotine delivery systems 
(ie, electronic cigarettes [ECs]) instead of cigarette smok-
ing, could be a pragmatic compromise with the possibility of 
significant health gains. Although it is important to acknowl-
edge that nicotine is a potent psycho-stimulant and young 
people should avoid its use, in conventional cigarettes, it is 
not nicotine but tobacco combustion chemicals that are the 
overwhelming cause of tobacco-related disease and death. 
As respiratory physicians, we should be more concerned 
of the damage associated with the harmful and potentially 
harmful constituents generated after combustion than nico-
tine consumption per se.
The EC has been proposed as a potential THR tool.17 
These products have been rapidly gaining ground over 
conventional cigarettes due to their efficiency in decreas-
ing tobacco consumption, competitive price, the perception 
of being a much less harmful smoking alternative and also 
because they allow the smoker to maintain a “smoking expe-
rience without smoking.”18–20 ECs do not contain tobacco, 
create smoke, or rely on combustion to operate. They are not 
risk-free, but under normal conditions of use, the level of 
chemical constituents in their aerosol emissions is substan-
tially lower compared to conventional cigarette smoke.20–22 
Reducing conventional cigarette consumption by switching 
over to ECs is therefore expected to result in health benefits 
and may produce substantial health benefits. ECs by provid-
ing a much less harmful means to compete with (and even 
replace) combustible cigarettes may be saving more lives 
more rapidly than previously possible. Nonetheless, knowl-
edge about the risk–benefit ratio of this strategy, including 
the use of ECs in smokers with COPD, is scarce.
According to the findings from the 2014 and 2015 
National Health Interview Survey, EC use by COPD patients 
was significant with former smokers with COPD suggesting 
a reliance on ECs to prevent relapse to tobacco cigarettes.23 
Emerging evidence suggest that COPD smokers who quit or 
reduce tobacco consumption substantially by switching to EC 
use are likely to gain significant health benefits. Improvement 
in respiratory symptoms after switching was reported in 
75.7% of 1,190 COPD EC users in a large cross-sectional 
survey, whereas worsening was reported in only 0.8%.19
No negative impact in a retrospective study of COPD 
smokers who have been “vaping” (the acting of inhaling 
from ECs) regularly for at least 2 years.24 Marked attenu-
ation in annual COPD exacerbations and enhanced overall 
health status (assessed using the COPD Assessment Tool 
[CAT]) and physical activity (measured by the 6-minute 
walk distance [6MWD]) were also noted in the same study.24 
However, cross-sectional surveys and retrospective designs 
cannot establish health effects with certainty.
The aim of the present study was to verify these findings 
by reporting health outcomes of the third year follow-up in 
the same cohort of COPD patients who have continued to 
vape regularly for an additional year.
Methods
Patient population
All the patients in the index study were a cohort of COPD EC 
users; they were identified from medical records and regularly 
followed up for a period of 36 months. Another group of age- 
and sex-matched regularly smoking COPD patients (and not 
using ECs) was also selected over the same period as a refer-
ence (control) group. Details of these patients’ populations 
have been presented elsewhere.24 COPD diagnosis was made 
according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive 
Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria as per the prior published 
study.24 In the current study, COPD patients from both the 
study groups (COPD EC users and COPD controls) were pro-
spectively followed up for an additional 12 months, hence 36 
months in total from baseline. The study was approved by the 
ethics review board of the coordinating center (Policlinico – 
 
Vittorio Emanuele Hospitals). We obtained written informed 
consent from each patient.
study design and assessments
Details of the study design and assessments have been 
described previously.24 Briefly, patients’ clinical notes 
were reviewed three times over 2 years: at baseline 
(when COPD patients in the EC group first reported EC 
use), at 12±1.5 months (follow-up visit 1; F/up1), and at 
24±2.5 months (follow-up visit 2; F/up2) to acquire details 
about 1) their respiratory symptoms, 2) smoking status 
and conventional cigarette consumption per day (cig/day), 
3) the number of severe COPD exacerbations in the prior 
12 months, 4) post-bronchodilator lung function parameters 
(forced expiratory flow in 1 second [FEV1]; forced vital 
capacity [FVC]; expiratory ratio [FEV1/FVC]; as well

as the annual rate of FEV1 decline), 5) CAT scores, and 
6) 6MWD.
In the present study, COPD EC users and COPD con-
trols were prospectively re-evaluated for changes in the 
same objective and subjective parameters at an additional 
follow-up at 36±3 months (follow-up visit 3; F/up3) com-
pared to baseline. Changes in daily tobacco consumption 
were chemically confirmed using exhaled breath carbon 
monoxide (eCO), and EC use were also reviewed. Findings 
obtained at F/up3 were compared with those from baseline, 
F/up1 and F/up2. In addition, changes in the relative propor-
tion of COPD GOLD stages over the study period were also 
evaluated.
Severe exacerbations were defined as respiratory 
symptoms that necessitated the use of antibiotics and/or oral 
corticosteroids through the primary care physician, emer-
gency department attendance, and/or admission to hospital. 
For the latter two, nebulization may have also been admin-
istered to improve patient symptoms. CAT is a validated 
health status questionnaire for use in COPD patients with a 
2 unit change considered to be of minimal clinical important 
difference.25,26 The 6MWD, which is a test conducted to 
assess patients’ overall ability to conduct daily activities, was 
only offered to patients who were amenable and physically 
able to do the test.27
smoking/vaping status
Smoking abstinence was defined as a complete self-reported 
cessation of tobacco smoking (not even a puff) since the 
previous study visit. This was also bio-chemically confirmed 
at F/up3 by eCO levels of 7 ppm. COPD EC users in this 
category are classified as quitters (single users). Patients who 
used both ECs and conventional cigarettes were classified 
as dual users.
analyses
Means (± standard deviation [SD]) and medians (inter-
quartile range [IQR]) were used to express parametric and 
non-parametric data, respectively. Data for single and dual 
users was also reviewed. Depending on whether the data 
were parametric or non-parametric, statistical analyses were 
conducted using student’s t-test and Wilcoxon-signed rank 
test, respectively. Similar statistical analyses were conducted 
on dual and single users within groups from baseline. Missing 
data were not considered in the analyses. With repeated 
parameter measurements over the study period, analysis of 
repeated measures with Bonferroni correction was conducted 
for between groups. A two-tailed p-value of 0.05 was 
considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical 
evaluations were performed with the Statistical Package for 
Social Science (SPSS for windows version 18.0; SPSS Inc., 
Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
Of the 48 COPD patients enrolled in the study at baseline, 
complete data sets at 36 months were obtained from 44 
(37 male and 7 female) patients by the end of the study; data 
sets from two patients from the EC user group who relapsed 
to conventional cigarette smoking were not included, and 
updated clinical notes from two patients from the reference 
group were not available because one died and the other was 
lost to follow-up due to relocation. Patients’ demographics, 
objective and subjective parameters, as well as COPD 
GOLD staging at baseline are summarized in Table 1. No 
between-group differences were noted at baseline for all 
the parameters assessed. The patients enrolled had mild-to-
severe COPD as per the GOLD guidelines and were managed 
accordingly.24
smoking consumption and eC use
COPD EC users were characterized by a significant reduction 
in conventional cigarette use with a mean (±SD) cigarettes/
day of 21.9 (±4.5) at baseline falling to 2 (±2.2) at F/up1, 
1.6 (±2) at F/up2, and 1.5 (±2.4) at F/up3, respectively 
(p0.001 for all three visits) (Table 2). No marked changes 
were observed among COPD controls. In the COPD EC user 
group, complete abstinence (quitters; exclusive EC users or 
single users) from daily conventional cigarette consumption 
was reported in 13/22 (59.1%) EC users at F/up3; tobacco 
smoking (dual users) in 9/22 (40.9%) (Table 3). A substan-
tial decline in conventional cigarette use was also noted in 
dual users with the mean (±SD) cigarettes/day at baseline 
decreasing from 23.9 (±4.9) to 4 (±1.2) at F/up1 to 3.6 (±1.3) 
at F/up2 and to 3.8 (±1.1) at F/up3, respectively (p0.001 
for all three visits) (Table 3). Of note, all the dual users, at all 
three visits, managed to reduce their conventional cigarette 
use/day by 75% of their baseline consumption. Overall, a 
statistically significant decrease in conventional cigarettes 
smoked was consistently observed between the study groups 
over the 36-month observation period (p0.001).
COPD exacerbations
COPD EC users had a significant diminution in COPD exac-
erbations; with their mean (±SD) exacerbation rate falling 
from 2.3 (±0.9) at baseline to 1.7 (±1) at F/up1 (p=0.002), 1.4 
(±0.9) at F/up2 (p=0.002), and 1.3 (±0.9) at F/up3 (p0.001), 
respectively (Table 2). There were no significant changes in

COPD exacerbation rates over the 3 years in the control group 
from baseline. A significant (p=0.004) between-group reduc-
tion in COPD exacerbations was seen over the 36-month 
period of the study (Table 2; Figure 1). Consistent reductions 
in COPD exacerbations were observed in the dual users as 
well, with their mean (±SD) exacerbation rate of 2.7 (±0.9) at 
baseline significantly falling to 1.5 (±0.9) at F/up2 (p=0.002) 
and 1.2 (±0.8) at F/up3 (p=0.001), respectively (Table 3).
lung function assessments and COPD 
staging
No significant changes in post-bronchodilator FEV1 and FVC 
from baseline were observed over the 36-month period in 
both the study groups (Table 2; Figure 2A and B). In addition, 
no overall between study group differences in any spirometric 
assessments were observed. From baseline to F/up3, there 
was annual increase of 23.3 mL in FEV1 observed in the 
COPD EC user group compared to a decrease of 4.7 mL in 
the control group (p=0.139).
Changes in GOLD COPD staging are depicted in 
Figure 3. In the 3-year period, a number of COPD patients in 
the EC study group down-staged from GOLD COPD Stages 4 
and 3 to Stages 3 and 2, respectively. In contrast, there was 
virtually a lack of change in the COPD GOLD stages in the 
control group over the observation period.
CaT scores and 6MWD
Subjective COPD assessment, evaluated using CAT scores, 
improved significantly in the COPD EC group throughout 
the study (p0.01 for all three visits). Improvements were 
of clinical relevance with a median CAT score reduction 
from baseline of 3.5, 3, and 5.5 units at F/up1, F/up2, and 
F/up3, respectively (Table 2). No significant changes in CAT 
scores were observed in the control group. Hence, significant 
(p=0.019) between-group reductions in CAT scores was seen 
over the 36-month period of the study (Table 2; Figure 4). 
Consistent and clinically relevant reductions in CAT scores 
were observed in the dual users as well (Table 3).
Results of 6MWD were available for 13 subjects at F/up1 
and F/up2 and for 11 subjects at F/up3 in the COPD EC 
group; while data from the COPD control group were avail-
able for 14 subjects at F/up1 and F/up2 and for 13 subjects 
at F/up3. Compared to baseline, at 36 months, the 6MWD 
improved by a median of 70 m (p=0.003) in the COPD EC 
user group whereas decreased by 7.5 m (p=0.087) in the 
COPD control group (Table 2). A significant (p=0.001) 
improvement in 6MWD was seen between study groups over 
the 36-month period of the study (Table 2).
Discussion
In a cohort of regular EC users with COPD, abstaining from 
smoking or substantially reducing cigarette consumption 
ameliorates quality of life as well as respiratory outcomes in 
COPD and that these positive effects persist long-term. This 
is in agreement with the notion that quitting smoking is a 
key strategy not only to prevent the onset of COPD but also 
to stop its progression into more severe disease stages.8,10–13 
These confirmatory findings are of thoughtful importance

electronic cigarettes harm reduction in COPD patients
as many COPD patients continue their tobacco habit despite 
their symptoms and show little interest in relinquishing 
it;15,16,28 a contradiction that may be justified by the highly 
addictive disposition of tobacco smoking and the fear of 
developing depressive symptoms.28,29
Over an observation period of ~3 years, only two (8.3%) 
patients from the COPD EC user group (both were dual 
users) relapsed to cigarette smoking. Relapse prevention may 
be another way by which ECs contribute to individual and 
public health. This is an important consideration, given that 
smokers with COPD are known to perform poorly in smoking 
cessation programs due to their high relapse rate.16,28,29 
Perhaps the fact that ECs reproduce the smoking experience 
and accompanying rituals with large compensatory effect 
at both physical and behavioral levels may explain the low 
relapse rates in this study of COPD smokers who switched 
to ECs. A similar mechanism might explain the low relapse 
rates observed among smokers not intending to quit30,31 as 
well as in smokers with schizophrenia, asthma, and high 
blood pressure after switching to EC use.32–34
This study corroborates previous observations of a lack 
of worsening in respiratory physiology (post-bronchodilator 
FEV1, FVC, and %FEV1/FVC) in patients with COPD who 
stopped or considerably reduced their conventional cigarette 
use by switching to EC use. The absence of marked changes 
in spirometric indices following smoking cessation is not 
unusual in COPD smokers and particularly in patients with 
advanced disease and irreversible airway obstruction35,36 as 
is the case in our study population.
The finding that COPD exacerbations were halved in 
patients who stopped or considerably reduced their smoking 
habit following switching to ECs was an important finding. 
This is in agreement with results from two large population 
studies: one reporting a 43% lower risk COPD-related hos-
pitalizations in previous smokers compared with existing 
smokers;37 and the other showing a 22% reduction in COPD 
exacerbation risk in ex-smokers compared with ongoing 
smokers when adjusted for comorbidity, COPD sever-
ity indices, and socioeconomic status.38 In contrast, there 
have also been reports of a lack of any marked differences 
in hospital admissions between current smokers and ex-
smokers with COPD.39,40 Importantly, these studies did not 
take into consideration important COPD exacerbation risk

confounders such as smoking abstinence duration, severity

marked attenuation of respiratory infections and COPD 
exacerbations.43
Consistent improvements were observed in overall health 
status and physical activity in our EC-using COPD patient 
cohort who quit or reduced substantially their conventional 
cigarette consumption. These clinical changes in CAT and 
6MWD confirm our previous observations24 and are compat-
ible with those reported in undergoing intensive rehabilita-
tion programs in COPD patients.26,44 The mechanism for 
these improved health outcomes may be associated with the 
substantial decline in CO exposure (as well as in carboxyhe-
moglobin levels) following smoking abstinence45 and to the 
linked time-dependent progression in exercise tolerance with 
abstaining from smoking.46 Surprisingly, consistent improve-
ments were also observed in dual users. This could be due to 
the fact that dual users in the index study significantly attenu-
ated their daily smoking by at least 75% (ie, heavy reducers). 
Also a much larger proportion of less severe COPD GOLD 
stages patients were dual users, which may have favored the 
tendency toward harm reversibility.
There are limitations in our observations that need con-
sideration. Our observations are in a small cohort of COPD 
patients, and hence the results need to be interpreted cau-
tiously. Nonetheless, we observed consistent and clinically 
significant beneficial effects in several COPD health

indicators. Also, there is the possibility that the patients in 
the index study may represent a self-selected sample, which 
may not be representative of all COPD smokers. Another 
shortcoming is that the 6MWD test was not performed in 
all study participants, as this was not the standard and some 
patients declined to do it.
The present study suggests that regular EC use amelio-
rates several health effect indicators in COPD and demon-
strates that these beneficial effects may continue in the longer 
term. By markedly reducing the number of conventional ciga-
rettes smoked per day and hence exposure to their numerous 
hazardous toxicants, EC use may not only enhance COPD 
outcomes, but may also bestow an overall health advantage.47 
Therefore, EC use may be exploited as a less harmful strategy 
to potentially halt or reverse COPD-related outcomes and, 
in general, to reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases or 
the harm from smoking-associated comorbidities. While the 
sample size in our study was relatively small, the results of 
this study may provide preliminary evidence that long-term 
use of ECs is unlikely to result in substantial health con-
cerns in COPD patients. Additional studies in a larger and 
more diverse sample of COPD EC users are now needed to 
substantiate and elucidate the emerging role of the e-vapor 
category for smoking cessation and/or harm reversal in 
smoking COPD patients.
