Abstract
In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), progressive loss of respiratory function leads to restrictive pulmonary disease and places patients at
significant risk for severe respiratory complications. Of particular concern are ineffective cough, secretion retention and recurrent respiratory tract
infections. In a Phase 3 randomized controlled study (DMD Long-term Idebenone Study, DELOS) in DMD patients 10–18 years of age and not
taking concomitant glucocorticoid steroids, idebenone (900 mg/day) reduced significantly the loss of respiratory function over a 1-year study
period. In a post-hoc analysis of DELOS we found that more patients in the placebo group compared to the idebenone group experienced
bronchopulmonary adverse events (BAEs): placebo: 17 of 33 patients, 28 events; idebenone: 6 of 31 patients, 7 events. The hazard ratios (HR)
calculated “by patient” (HR 0.33, p = 0.0187) and for “all BAEs” (HR 0.28, p = 0.0026) indicated a clear idebenone treatment effect. The overall
duration of BAEs was 222 days (placebo) vs. 82 days (idebenone). In addition, there was also a difference in the use of systemic antibiotics utilized
for the treatment of BAEs. In the placebo group, 13 patients (39.4%) reported 17 episodes of antibiotic use compared to 7 patients (22.6%)
reporting 8 episodes of antibiotic use in the idebenone group. Furthermore, patients in the placebo group used systemic antibiotics for longer (105
days) compared to patients in the idebenone group (65 days). This post-hoc analysis of DELOS indicates that the protective effect of idebenone
on respiratory function is associated with a reduced risk of bronchopulmonary complications and a reduced need for systemic antibiotics.

1. Introduction
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by
relentlessly progressive weakness and loss of muscle function,
cardiomyopathy, progressive spinal abnormality, restrictive
lung disease and death in early adulthood [1]. Patients with
DMD are at high risk of respiratory complications as
their clinical condition deteriorates due to progressive loss
of respiratory muscle strength [2,3]. Indeed, respiratory
complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
DMD. It was previously estimated that 55–90% of DMD
patients die from respiratory failure between 16.2 and 19 years
of age [4,5].

 For patients with DMD, neuromuscular weakness leads to
impaired cough and airway clearance of secretions and acute
respiratory failure may often occur in the setting of benign upper
respiratory tract infections [6,7]. During these episodes, already
severe pulmonary dysfunction is further compromised by
bronchial mucus plugging and by further weakening and
fatigue of inspiratory and expiratory muscles [4]. Such episodes
can result in repeated pneumonias, hospitalizations, tracheal
intubations, respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support and
ultimately death. McDonald et al. reported that in a group of 114
DMD subjects, 34% had a history of significant respiratory
complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory failure
and that there was an increase in the rate of complications
with age [8]. This study further reported that there was a high
correlation between pulmonary complications and forced vital
capacity percent of predicted (FVC%p) since 69% of cases
with FVC%p < 50% had pulmonary complications compared
with only 17% of those with FVC%p > 80%. While annual
pulmonary evaluations are recommended for younger patients
in the late first decade, as soon as the patient becomes
non-ambulatory, more aggressive pulmonary monitoring and
preventive interventions are recommended. According to
internationally recognized guidelines, a structured approach to
respiratory management of DMD comprises: (i) monitoring of
respiratory function to detect respiratory involvement; (ii)
introduction of lung volume recruitment techniques; (iii) use of
a mechanical insufflation–exsufflation device to improve airway
clearance and to reduce the risk of pulmonary infections; and (iv)
the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) to prevent nocturnal
hypoventilation, sleep disordered breathing, and ultimately
respiratory failure [7,9–11]. Indeed, the use of non-invasive
mechanical ventilation has increased survival in DMD from the
late teens to the late 20s [12,13].
Respiratory muscle weakness of diaphragm and chest wall
muscles, chest deformity resulting from progressive scoliosis,
and fibrosis of chest wall muscles all contribute to a progressive
restrictive pulmonary impairment in DMD, and predispose to a
variety of pulmonary complications, which account for the
majority of DMD-related deaths [14–17]. Of particular clinical
concern is the high risk of recurrent respiratory tract infections
and acute respiratory failure secondary to retained airway
secretions, which, in turn, is due to reduced cough effectiveness
caused by inspiratory, glottis and expiratory muscle weakness
[18,19]. Specifically, in DMD peak cough flow (PCF) between
160 and 270 L/min is considered sufficient for effective cough as
long as the patient is in a stable medical condition. However,
when the PCF falls below 160 L/min, the cough is no longer
effective enough to provide adequate mucociliary clearance
[4,20–22]. Similarly, reduced lung volumes measured as FVC
below 1 L or inspiratory vital capacity (IVC) below 1.1 L has
been associated with increased risk of severe chest infections,
respiratory failure, and early morbidity in patients with DMD
[22,23]. In addition, infections, including mild upper-respiratory
tract infection, may worsen respiratory muscle weakness leading
to a vicious cycle of recurrent, ever-worsening episodes of
chest infection and inflammation, ineffective cough and excess
mucus secretion and retention, which may result in atelectasis,
ventilation–perfusion mismatch, hypoxemia and respiratory
failure in severe cases [24]. The importance of maintaining
effective cough and reducing the risk of airway infections has
recently been quantitatively assessed by a patient and caregiver
survey. In a community engaged approach conducted by Parent
Project Muscular Dystrophy [25], 133 individuals, the majority
of which represent DMD patients, rated effective cough and
reduced airway infections as important treatment objectives for
their disease [26].
In a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study
(DMD Long-term Idebenone Study, DELOS) in patients with
DMD not using concomitant glucocorticoid steroids (GC),
idebenone, a short-chain benzoquinone, has been shown to
reduce the loss of respiratory function as assessed by peak
expiratory flow (PEF), FVC and forced expiratory volume in 1
second (FEV1) over the 52-week study period [27]. In addition,
idebenone was shown to reduce the loss of inspiratory
lung function in the same trial [28]. Initial analyses of the
DELOS study outcome already indicated an effect of idebenone
treatment on the rate of airway infections.The aim of the present
study was to further assess whether idebenone treatment as
compared to placebo reduces the risk of bronchopulmonary
adverse events (BAEs), assessed as proportion of patients
experiencing such complications as well as their duration and
associated hazard ratios. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics
utilized for the treatment of such BAEs/airway infections was
determined. The results from these analyses demonstrated
that, in the setting of a placebo-controlled trial, idebenone use
reduced the risk of experiencing BAEs, including airway
infections, and reduced the need of systemic antibiotic use in
patients with DMD.
2. Methods
2.1. Patients
The study population consisted of 64 DMD patients not
using concomitant GCs enrolled in DELOS (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT01027884), a multi-center, Phase 3 randomized, double-
blind clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of
900 mg/day
idebenone
(Raxone®
provided
by
Santhera
Pharmaceuticals, Switzerland) vs. placebo [27]. DELOS was
approved by competent national authorities responsible for the
permission of clinical studies and IRBs/independent ethics
committees and conducted according to GCP and the principles
of the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were enrolled in the
study if they had a peak expiratory flow percent predicted
(PEF%p) ≤ 80% at baseline. Treatment duration was 52 weeks.
In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population there were 31 patients
randomized to idebenone and 33 patients randomized to
placebo. The age of patients was 10–18 years (mean age, 14.3
years) with patients in the placebo group on average being
slightly older (15.0 years, SD 2.5) than patients in the
idebenone group (13.5 years, SD 2.7). The vast majority
(92.2%) of patients were non-ambulatory at baseline and this
was well balanced between treatment groups (idebenone: 90%,
placebo: 94%). Overall, almost half of the patients (43.8%) had
never used GCs prior to study entry (idebenone: 45%, placebo:
474
C.M. McDonald et al./Neuromuscular Disorders 26 (2016) 473–480
 42%) and all patients who previously used GCs had to have
stopped their GC intake at least 12 months prior to study entry
to be eligible. Patients were not allowed to take GCs during the
52-week study period. Further details on study procedures and
eligibility criteria have been reported previously [27].
2.2. Respiratory function tests
Standard spirometry was performed at hospital visits
(i.e., baseline, Weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52) using a Pneumotrac
Spirometer 6800 (Vitalograph, United Kingdom) with the aid of
a qualified, trained and certified operator and in accordance with
the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society
guidelines [29]. The assessment of respiratory function tests
(including PEF and FVC) and conversion to percent predicted
(%p) values to account for maturational changes is described in
the original report of the DELOS study [27]. Specifically, body
height was calculated from ulna length measurements.
2.3. Assessment of bronchopulmonary adverse events and
antibiotic use
In a post-hoc efficacy analysis, treatment emergent adverse
events (TEAEs) prospectively collected and recorded in the
DELOS safety database were reviewed and assessed by a
respiratory physician (Dr. Marianne Mann, Board certified
pulmonologist, past Deputy Director for the Division of
Pulmonary and Allergy Drug Products at the FDA) who was
blinded to treatment assignment and had not been involved as
an investigator in the DELOS trial.
Bronchopulmonary adverse events (BAEs) were defined as
clinically relevant TEAEs if they involved the larynx, trachea,
bronchi, lower airways or lung. Conversely, if the TEAEs were
less precise and/or involved primarily the nose, sinuses, or throat,
they were not considered BAEs.The followingTEAEs (preferred
terms) were identified as clinically relevant BAEs and included in
the analysis: bronchitis, influenza (with respiratory symptoms),
laryngitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, viral
infection (with respiratory symptoms), respiratory failure, acute
respiratory failure, cough, and dyspnea. Conversely, TEAEs such
as influenza-like illness, nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis,
oropharyngeal pain, otitis media, pharyngitis, pyrexia, rhinitis,
allergic rhinitis, rhinorrhea and sleep apnea syndrome were
excluded from the analysis. BAEs were only assessed if they had
been reported during the time of study medication intake. One
event occurring before treatment start (dyspnea in the idebenone
group) and two events occurring after the last dose of study
medication intake (2 cases of bronchitis in 2 placebo patients)
were excluded from the analysis.
The duration of the events was calculated from the starting
date to the end date recorded in the safety database of the
DELOS trial. If an event extended the period of study
medication intake, the duration was only calculated until the
last day of study medication intake. For events with unknown
end date, the median length of events with identical preferred
term was imputed. In cases where only the month was available,
the 15th day of the month was used. Y
early incidence rates of
BAEs by baseline pulmonary function were calculated as the
number of events divided by exposure to study medicine in
patient years.
The same study-independent assessor also determined the
use of antibiotics listed as concomitant medications. For
this, antibiotic use was classified by systemic exposure (e.g.,
excluding topical applications) and whether they were likely to
be used for treatment of airway infections or related diseases,
taking into consideration the indication(s) for which antibiotics
were prescribed as reported by the investigator in the
concomitant medication records. Systemic antibiotics in the
vast majority of cases were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or
amoxicillin (generally oral).
2.4. Statistical methods
The hazard ratios for BAEs were calculated using a Cox
Proportional Hazards model for idebenone over placebo using
the day of the first event of a subject or the last day of study
medication intake as censoring time if a patient had no events.
Similarly, for all events a Proportional Means Regression
model for recurrence data was used allowing the count of
multiple events per patient [30,31]. All statistical analyses were
of exploratory nature and nominal p-values are reported
without adjustments for multiple testing.
2.5. Role of the funding source
The study was sponsored by Santhera Pharmaceuticals. The
investigators and authors had sole discretion over study design,
collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, writing of the
report, and decision to submit it for publication.
3. Results
3.1. Effect of idebenone on proportion of patients falling
below clinically relevant thresholds of respiratory function
In a pre-specified analysis of the DELOS trial, the
proportion of patients falling below the clinically relevant
threshold of 160 L/min in PCF was assessed. In the ITT
population there were 26 patients in the idebenone group and
33 patients in the placebo group who at baseline had a PCF of
more than 160 L/min. During the 52-week study period, only 1
patient (3.8%) in the idebenone group compared to 6 patients
(18.2%) in the placebo fell below the threshold of 160 L/min in
PCF. We also analyzed the proportion of patients falling below
1 L in FVC. There were 9 patients in the placebo group and 6
patients in the idebenone group who at baseline had an FVC of
more than 1 L but less than 1.5 L and who were therefore at risk
of falling below the 1 L FVC threshold. Again a higher number
of patients in the placebo group (5 patients, 55.6%) fell below
this threshold compared to patients in the idebenone group (1
patient, 16.7%). When accounted for the entire ITT population,
the proportion of patients falling below 1 L in FVC was 15.6%
for the placebo group and 3.2% for the idebenone group. As
these thresholds in PCF and FVC are clinically relevant risk
factors for upper and lower airway infections and respiratory
complications in DMD, we next assessed the DELOS study
population for incidence of bronchopulmonary complications
reported in the safety records of the study.

 3.2. Analysis of bronchopulmonary adverse events (BAE)
The number and type of treatment-emergent BAEs in DELOS
are summarized in Table 1. A total of 6 patients (19.4%) in the
idebenone group reported 7 BAEs compared to 17 patients
(51.5%) reporting 28 BAEs in the placebo group (p = 0.0096
for difference in patients experiencing BAEs). Time to event as
well as frequency and duration of BAEs were further analyzed
using a Cox Proportional Hazards model (first event only) and
also Proportional Means Regression analysis (all events). The
resulting cumulative frequency of all BAEs recorded during
the one-year study period shows the lower rate of BAEs in the
idebenone group compared to placebo (Fig. 1). The resulting
hazard ratio from the Cox Proportional Hazards model for the
number of patients experiencing at least one BAE was 0.327
(95% CI: 0.129, 0.830; p = 0.0187), which is in favor of idebenone
treatment. Likewise, investigating all BAEs allowing for multiple
events per patient by the Proportional Means Regression Model
resulted in a hazard ratio of 0.281 (95% CI: 0.123, 0.642;
p = 0.0026), which is also in favor of idebenone treatment. In
addition, the duration of treatment-emergent BAEs was analyzed
by treatment group (Table 2). Although the mean duration of
BAEs was slightly longer in the idebenone group compared to
placebo, the median was comparable. The total number of days
for which BAEs were reported in the idebenone group was 82
days, representing only 36.9% of the 222 days reported for the
placebo group.
Interestingly,
the
higher
frequency
of
BAEs
in
the
placebo group was also reflected in the number of reported
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) leading to hospital admissions
with respiratory causes. Such hospitalizations were reported
for 4 patients in the placebo group and 1 patient in the
idebenone group. Reasons for hospitalizations given for the
placebo-treated patients were (i) acute respiratory failure,
(ii) pneumonia, (iii) pulmonary micro-embolism following
femur fracture and (iv) global respiratory failure. The patient
from the idebenone group was hospitalized for sleep apnea
syndrome.

 Taken together, the data analyses performed provide
consistent evidence favoring idebenone with regard to both
frequency and duration of BAEs.
3.3. Effect of age, baseline respiratory function and previous
steroid use on BAEs
We assessed the possible influence of age, previous
glucocorticoid steroid use and respiratory function (measured
as PEF%p and FVC%p) at baseline on the occurrence of BAEs.
There was no marked difference in the age of patients with or
without BAEs when compared within each treatment group
(Table 3). However, the slightly older age in the placebo group
in both patients with and without BAEs is reflecting the slight
overall age imbalance between treatment groups. In each
treatment group the age at baseline for patients with or without
BAEs was comparable (idebenone: 12.3 years for patients with
BAEs and 13.8 years for patients not reporting BAEs; placebo:
15.1 years for patients with BAEs and 14.9 years for patients
not reporting BAEs).
Baseline respiratory function measured as PEF%p was
comparable and largely overlapping between all groups
indicating that the difference in the number of BAEs
between the idebenone and placebo groups was not driven by
an imbalance in PEF%p. On the other hand, there was a
noticeable imbalance for FVC%p at baseline. For patients not
experiencing BAEs the baseline FVC%p was comparable
between placebo and idebenone groups. However, patients in
the placebo group who experienced BAEs had lower baseline
FVC%p compared to patients in the idebenone group with
BAEs.
To elucidate the impact of Baseline age, PEF%p and
FVC%p, and prior GC use on the results, all factors were
included in a multivariate Cox model. None of fixed factors
showed statistically significant influence on the model (Age:
p = 0.5873; PEF%p: p = 0.9336; FVC%p: p = 0.9312). Also
prior GC use did not show a significant influence on the results
(p = 0.6787). Analogously in a Proportional Means Regression
model including the identical covariates, no influence of the
fixed factors was shown (Age: p = 0.2855; PEF%p: p = 0.4677;
FVC%p: p = 0.6913; prior GC use: p = 0.3377).
To further assess whether baseline pulmonary function was
predictive for the occurrence of BAEs, we calculated the yearly
rate of BAEs categorized by baseline PEF%p and FVC%p.
Fig. 2 shows the yearly rates of reported BAEs for patients
separated into categories of > 80%, > 60 to ≤ 80%, > 40
to ≤ 60%, and ≤ 40% of baseline PEF%p and FVC%p,
respectively. When analyzed for baseline PEF%p categories,
yearly incidence rates of BAEs were always higher in the
placebo group compared to the idebenone treatment group.
Differences were particularly prominent for patients with
PEF%p of ≤ 60%, with more than 1 BAE/year reported for
patients in the placebo group, while patients treated with
idebenone experienced far fewer events (0.26 BAEs/year in the
> 40 to ≤ 60% PEF%p category and none in patients with
PEF%p of ≤ 40% at baseline). Similarly, the yearly incidence
rate of BAEs was consistently higher in the placebo group
compared to idebenone for all patients with an FVC%p of
≤ 80% at baseline. Few patients in the study had FVC%p
> 80%. Importantly, again, the largest difference in incidence of
BAEs was seen in patients with more severe functional
pulmonary impairment at baseline. Specifically, among patients
who presented with a PEF%p or FVC%p at baseline of ≤ 40%
only those in the placebo group experienced BAEs (on average
more than 1 BAE/year). In striking contrast, none of the
patients in the idebenone group with ≤ 40% in PEF%p or
FVC%p at baseline reported BAEs.
Finally, we also analyzed for a potential influence of
previous glucocorticoid steroid use on the occurrence of
BAEs. In the idebenone group 17 of 31 (55%) patients reported
previous GC use, which was similar to the proportion in the
placebo group (19 of 33, 58%) [27]. When we analyzed
the influence of previous GC use as categorical factor in a
Cox Model, previous GC use did not appear to influence
significantly the time to first BAE (p = 0.6787, see above). This
indicates that previous use of GCs stopped at least 12 months
prior to study entry did not influence the susceptibility of
patients to experience BAE.
3.4. Effect of idebenone on antibiotic use
As severe bronchopulmonary events frequently require
intervention with antibiotic treatment [7], we also analyzed the
number of patients using systemic antibiotics as well as
the duration of antibiotic use. Overall, 7 patients (22.6%)
reported 8 episodes of antibiotic use for the treatment of
bronchopulmonary adverse events/respiratory tract infections in
the idebenone group compared to 13 patients (39.4%) reporting
17 episodes of antibiotic use in the placebo group (Table 4). The
mean and median duration of antibiotic use of approximately one
week (6–8 days) was comparable between treatment groups.The
cumulative duration of antibiotic use was 105 days among
patients on placebo, which was clearly longer compared to
patients receiving idebenone (65 days).

 The resulting hazard ratio from the Cox Proportional
Hazards model for time to first use of antibiotics was 0.52 (95%
CI: 0.207, 1.304; p = 0.1631), favoring idebenone treatment.
Likewise, investigating the cumulative frequency of the use of
antibiotics (allowing for multiple use per patient) by the
Proportional Means Regression Model resulted in a hazard
ratio of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.226, 1.217; p = 0.1330), which is also
in favor of idebenone treatment (Fig. 3).
4. Discussion
In a Phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trial (DELOS)
using
pre-specified
primary
and
secondary
endpoints,
idebenone significantly reduced the loss of respiratory function
in DMD patients 10–18 years of age and not taking concomitant
glucocorticoid steroids (GCs) over a 1-year study period. The
current post-hoc analysis of the DELOS study showed that
idebenone treatment compared to placebo reduced the rate of
clinically relevant bronchopulmonary adverse events in patients
with DMD. The beneficial effect of idebenone was similar
irrespective of whether the data were analyzed by the number of
patients experiencing these events or total number of events.
Interestingly, the lower frequency of BAEs in the idebenone
group was also reflected in a lower number of hospital
admissions related to respiratory failure compared to the
placebo group. A non-significant but clinically relevant trend
favoring idebenone was also observed in terms of antibiotic
use. Furthermore, idebenone reduced the proportion of patients
falling below expert-defined clinically relevant thresholds of
respiratory function associated with severely impaired airway
clearance (PCF < 160 L/min) [7] and risk of respiratory failure
(FVC < 1 L) [23]. Only 1 patient (3.8%) in the idebenone
treated group compared to 6 patients (18.2%) in the placebo fell
below the threshold of 160 L/min in PCF. The proportion of
patients falling below 1 L in FVC over one-year was also
reduced with idebenone treatment (15.6% for the placebo group
and 3.2% for the idebenone group).

 Preservation of lung function and prevention and treatment
of chest infections are among the most important aspects of the
management of DMD. In this patient population, the increased
risk of chest infections mainly results from weak cough and
ineffective clearance of airway secretions. Several factors
contribute to diminished effectiveness of cough in patients with
DMD. Both the inspiratory and expiratory phases of cough are
weakened, although the expiratory muscles are relatively more
affected and provide for a large impact on the quality of cough
[5]. Glottic dysfunction prevents the generation of adequate
intrathoracic pressures needed to develop the sufficient
shearing forces required for expectoration of airway secretions
[32,33]. These factors together increase the risk of airway
infections and pneumonia, which in patients with DMD can
reach a rate of approximately one per year [19]. Impaired ability
to clear secretions may also lead to life-threatening situations
in which airways become obstructed by retained secretions.
Mucus plugging not only reduces the lung parenchyma
available for gas exchange, but also increases the risk of more
severe infections, atelectasis and respiratory failure [34,35].
Notably, this vicious cycle can be triggered by relatively minor
events, such as upper respiratory tract infections due to
otherwise non-virulent viruses.
In DELOS idebenone reduced the yearly incidence rate of
BAEs irrespective of baseline severity of pulmonary function
impairment as assessed by PEF%p and FVC%p. However, its
favorable effect was largest in patients with more advanced
disease (i.e., lower PEF%p and FVC%p ≤ 60%). Although the
absolute value (or percent predicted) of the patient’s FVC
does not directly correlate with the quality of a patient’s cough
[5], the degree of restrictive lung disease provides a good
representation of the patient’s pulmonary reserve [36]. This can
help determine whether (and which) respiratory support is
needed [2,7]. In our analysis, neither age nor previous GC use
influenced the occurrence of BAEs. Idebenone treatment was
also associated with reduced antibiotic use in terms of both
patients taking antibiotics and episodes of antibiotic use. While
mean and median duration of antibiotic use was similar
between groups, cumulative duration of antibiotic use was
shorter in patients on idebenone. Finally, a trend favoring
idebenone was also observed with regard to both the proportion
of patients who used antibiotics at least once and cumulative
antibiotic use allowing for multiple uses per patient.
While the use of non-invasive ventilation has improved
survival in DMD by approximately 10 years, many individuals
with DMD eventually die from complications of respiratory
function decline, including progressive restrictive ventilatory
defects, chronic hypoventilation and pulmonary infections.
Therefore, prevention of these complications is a major goal of
treatment. In agreement with previous analyses of the DELOS
trial [27], the data presented here provide evidence that
idebenone reduces the rate and duration of medical relevant
BAEs and related antibiotic use compared to placebo in patients
with DMD. These data provide evidence that the magnitude of
the treatment benefits of idebenone seen with both expiratory
and inspiratory respiratory function measures over one-year
translates to clinically meaningful benefits. These tangible
health benefits of more maintained effective cough and reduced
airway infections have been noted by patients and caregivers to
be important treatment objectives for their disease [26].
