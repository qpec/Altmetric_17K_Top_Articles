ABSTRACT
Objectives: To describe implementation of a new
national preventive programme to reduce
cardiovascular morbidity.
Design: Observational study over 4 years (April 2009
—March 2013).
Setting: 655 general practices across England from
the QResearch database.
Participants: Eligible adults aged 40–74 years
including attendees at a National Health Service (NHS)
Health Check.
Intervention: NHS Health Check: routine structured
cardiovascular check with support for behavioural
change and in those at highest risk, treatment of risk
factors and newly identified comorbidity.
Results: Of 1.68 million people eligible for an NHS
Health Check, 214 295 attended in the period 2009–
12. Attendance quadrupled as the programme
progressed; 5.8% in 2010 to 30.1% in 2012.
Attendance was relatively higher among older people,
of whom 19.6% of those eligible at age 60–74 years
attended and 9.0% at age 40–59 years. Attendance by
population groups at higher cardiovascular disease
(CVD) risk, such as the more socially disadvantaged
14.9%, was higher than that of the more affluent
12.3%. Among attendees 7844 new cases of
hypertension (38/1000 Checks), 1934 new cases of
type 2 diabetes (9/1000 Checks) and 807 new cases of
chronic kidney disease (4/1000 Checks) were
identified. Of the 27 624 people found to be at high
CVD risk (20% or more 10-year risk) when attending
an NHS Health Check, 19.3% (5325) were newly
prescribed statins and 8.8% (2438) were newly
prescribed antihypertensive therapy.
Conclusions: NHS Health Check coverage was lower
than expected but showed year-on-year improvement.
Newly identified comorbidities were an important
feature of the NHS Health Checks. Statin treatment at
national scale for 1 in 5 attendees at highest CVD risk
is likely to have contributed to important reductions in
their CVD events.
INTRODUCTION
The English National Health Service (NHS)
Health Checks programme started in 2009,
aiming
to
reduce
cardiovascular
disease
(CVD) risks and events. Internationally, it is
the first of its kind, aiming to provide a
routine structured clinical assessment and
management
for adults
aged
40–74 years
without pre-existing diabetes or CVD. The
NHS Health Check includes review of CVD
risks, behavioural change support and treat-
ment of newly identified risk factors or
comorbidity through integration with routine
clinical provision in general practice. We
describe an evaluation of the first 4 years of
this national programme.
The NHS Health Check is a 5-year rolling
programme which targets one-fifth of the eli-
gible population each year, aiming to invite 3
million people at an annual cost of £165
million.1–3 The Department of Health report
that 2.4 million NHS Health Checks were
undertaken
in
the
2 years
(2011–2012).4
Nationally, uptake is reported at around 50%
of the eligible target population with consid-
erable variability between provider organisa-
tions.4–6 The NHS Health Check programme
is now supported by NHS England and
Public
Health
England
following
major
changes in the NHS in 2013 when Primary
Care Trusts (PCTs) were replaced by Clinical
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This is the first national study describing imple-
mentation of the new National Health Service
(NHS) Health Check programme 2009–2012.
▪ It is based on a large representative sample of
655 general practices in England with 1.68
million people aged 40–74 years eligible for an
NHS Health Check of whom 214 295 attended.
▪ Of those eligible, 70% had ethnic group recorded
and 99% socioeconomic group recorded. In
attendees, recording of ethnic group and major
risk factors was over 90%.
▪ Non-attendees were younger, more likely to
smoke and recording of cardiovascular risk was
less complete.
▪ There is no information available about attend-
ance for support for behavioural change follow-
ing general practitioner (GP) referral.

Stratification of CVD risk for the purposes of thera-
peutic intervention is a key component of the NHS
Health Check. Attendees receive personal advice to
support behaviour change and treatment informed by
CVD risk stratification. When the programme was intro-
duced,
National
Institute
for
Health
and
Care
Excellence (NICE) guidance and the NHS Health
Check programme,9 10 recommended statin treatment at
a 10-year CVD risk of 20% or more and antihypertensive
treatment
with
blood
pressure
sustained
at
140/
90 mm Hg or more. Comorbidities, including diabetes
and
chronic
kidney
disease
(CKD),
are
identified
through blood testing in the high CVD risk group with
appropriate management. Familial propensity to prema-
ture ischaemic heart disease is also identified.
There is robust trial and observational evidence of
benefit from statins and antihypertensives in high-risk
people
with
and
without
established
CVD.11–16
In
people at higher CVD risk, primary prevention of CVD
using multiple risk factor intervention including treat-
ment with statins and antihypertensives has been shown
to be of benefit.17 However, this has not been demon-
strated in entire populations including people at lower
CVD risk. For people at lower CVD risk (ie, a 10-year
risk of <10%) for whom behavioural change is the main
intervention,
the
most
effective
prevention
strategy
remains unclear.16
Primary prevention based on assessment of cardiovas-
cular risk
is a topic
of international
interest and
debate.18–20
The
study
was
commissioned
by
the
Department of Health to provide an early view of imple-
mentation
of
the
national
programme.
This
study
describes the results from the first 4 years of the NHS
Health Check programme, the population coverage and
characteristics of those who attended, their recorded
CVD risks, new comorbidity and treatment. Available
information on non-attendees is also reported.
METHODS
The study plan and this report conform to the STROBE
recommendations for observational studies.21
QResearch is a large, nationally representative and
validated primary care electronic database containing
the health records of 13 million patients registered from
655
general
practices
using
the
Egton
Medical
Information System (EMIS) computer system for at least
a year.
For the 4 years (1 April 2009 to 31 March 2013), we
included in the study all eligible adults aged 40–74 years
if they had been registered for at least a year. We
excluded people ineligible for an NHS Health Check,
defined by the Department of Health as people with
pre-existing
vascular
disease
including hypertension,
ischaemic heart disease, stroke or transient ischaemic
attack, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral arterial
disease, CKD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes
and those already on statins.22
Read codes are used to code clinical data in primary
care. NHS Health Check attendance was identified by
Read codes for CVD risk assessment or NHS Health
Check completed. We were unable to distinguish NHS
Health Checks conducted in general practice from
those conducted by a third party such as a community
pharmacy. For people with an NHS Health Check, we
used the date of the Check as the index date for analysis.
For those without an NHS Check during the study
period, we allocated an index date of 1 April in each
year. The NHS Health Check is a rolling 5-year pro-
gramme, and the total eligible population each year was
divided by five to estimate the number eligible in any
1 year. Coverage was defined as the number of attendees
in the year, as a proportion of one-fifth of the popula-
tion eligible in that year.
The total eligible population and people who attended
an NHS Health Check were described according to sex,
age group (40–49, 50–59, 60–74) and ethnic group.
Ethnic groups were combined into Office of National
Statistics
categories:
white
(British,
Irish,
other
Caucasian); South Asian (Bangladeshi, Indian, Pakistani);
black African; black Caribbean; Chinese; other Asian;
other (any other recorded ethnic group including mixed
ethnic groups) and ethnic group not recorded.23
Deprivation was assessed using the Townsend score
based on 2001 census-derived measures of overcrowding,
car ownership and education available at lower super
output area.24 This was obtained by linking the indivi-
duals’ postcode to lower super output area (approxi-
mately 150 households). Townsend score was accessible
for 99% of patients. We grouped individuals into fifths
of deprivation, with quintile 1 indicating least deprived
and quintile 5 most deprived.
Information on smoking status, alcohol intake and risk
factor recording was described for attendees and non-
attendees. This included the latest information recorded
up to and including the date of the NHS Health Check
for attendees or the index date for non-attendees.
Family history of ischaemic heart disease was coded as
positive if a first-degree relative had angina or a heart
attack under age 60 years. Information on alcohol con-
sumption was categorised by units consumed per day
(non-drinker, <1, 1–2, 3–6, 7–9, >9+) although it was not
nationally part of the NHS Health Check during the
study period. Information was also extracted on whether
a recorded CVD risk score was estimated by either
Framingham or QRisk2 using the same time frame as
specified above. Where a score was recorded we used it
to identify people at high CVD risk, defined as a 10-year
CVD risk of 20% or more.
In people who attended a Health Check, information
was extracted on medications, new morbidities, risk
factor recording and referrals on the date of the check
or
in
the
following
12 months.

 information was extracted for non-attendees for the
12 months from their index date. New medication was
defined as at least two statin or antihypertensive pre-
scriptions within 12 months. New comorbidities, includ-
ing diagnosed hypertension, CKD categories 3–5 and
diabetes,
were
included
if
newly
recorded
within
12 months of an NHS Health Check. Abnormal mea-
surements were not classified as a diagnosis unless a
diagnostic code was recorded. For example, a raised
blood pressure was not classified as hypertension unless
the diagnostic code for hypertension was recorded.
The data were analysed using STATA V.13 (STATA
Corps).
We
calculated
proportions
of
people
who
attended by categories of age, sex and ethnic group. We
calculated proportions according to levels of smoking
status, alcohol intake and risk factors in those who did
and did not attend an NHS Health check. We also
described CVD risk levels and outcomes in attendees fol-
lowing the NHS Health Check. We did not carry out stat-
istical comparisons of NHS Health Check attendees with
non-attendees, as data were incomplete in the latter.
RESULTS
Over the 4-year study period (1 April 2009–31 March
2013) 1 679 024 people were eligible for an NHS Health
Check. Of these, 12.8% (214 295) patients were recorded
as having had an NHS Health Check (see figure 1).
One-fifth of the eligible population was considered
available for attendance each year.
Table 1 shows coverage by financial year. In 2009/
2010, there were a total 1 430 174 people eligible of
whom 286 035 (one-fifth) were considered eligible in
the year, and of these, 5.8% (16 613/286 035) attended
an NHS Health Check. In 2010/11, 14.6% attended; in
2011/12,
24.4%
attended;
and
in
2012/13,
30.1%
attended.
Table 2 shows NHS Health Check coverage for differ-
ent eligible population subgroups during the entire
4-year study period. Of those eligible aged 60–74 years,
19.6% attended, and at age 40–59 years, 9.0% attended.
In the most deprived quintile, 14.9% attended, and in
the least deprived quintile, 12.3% attended.
Seventy per cent (1 174 646/1 679 024) of the eligible
population had ethnic group recorded. There was low
attendance, 2.1% among the 30% of the eligible popula-
tion without ethnicity recorded. Among those with
ethnic group recorded, coverage was highest among
South Asians (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, other
Asian) of whom 19.2% of the eligible population
attended, and black Caribbeans 19.6%, and lowest in
black Africans 15.7% and Chinese 15.3%. In white
people, 17.4% attended compared with 16.9% in all
other recorded ethnic groups.
Table 3 shows information on risk factor recording
and CVD risk score recording among attendees and
non-attendees prior to or at the NHS Health Check or
the equivalent index date for non-attendees. Smoking
status was recorded in 99.9% of attendees and 94.5% of

 non-attendees. Non-attendees were more likely to be
smokers. In total, 17.7% of attendees were smokers, and
22.4% of non-attendees were smokers. Alcohol con-
sumption was recorded for 95.9% of attendees and
80.3% for non-attendees. Among those in whom alcohol
consumption was recorded, heavy drinking (>9 units/
day) was reported by 2.5% of attendees and 2.2% of
non-attendees.
CVD
risk
using
QRisk2
was
assessed
in
80.0%
(171 441/214 295) of attendees and in 29.0% (424 523/
1 464 729) of non-attendees and versions of Framingham
were used in 15.5% (33 260/214 295) of attendees and
5.2% (76 051/1 464 729) of non-attendees.
Of those attendees with QRisk2 scores recorded,
14.5% (24 869/171 441) were at high CVD risk (10-year
risk of 20% or more), and 20.7% (4733/33 260) of
those with Framingham scores recorded were at high
CVD risk. In total, 12.9% (27 624/214 295) of all atten-
dees were recorded at high CVD risk (20% or more
10-year
risk)
using
either
QRisk2
or
Framingham.
Among
non-attendees
with
QRisk2
recorded,
6.6%
(27 902/424 523) were at high CVD risk and 8.6% of
non-attendees were at high CVD risk (6547/76 051)
using Framingham.
Of those attendees with a QRisk2 score recorded,
46.6% (79 960/171 441) had a CVD risk of 10% or
more. In the non-attendees with a recorded QRisk2
score, 27.0% (114 564/424 523) were at 10% or more
CVD risk.
NEW COMORBIDITY
Table 4 records new comorbidity identified at or in the
12 months after the NHS Health Check from 2009 to
2012. This included 7844 new cases of hypertension (1
case per 27 NHS Health Checks), 1934 new cases of dia-
betes (1 new case for every 110 Checks) and 807 new
cases of CKD (1 new case in every 265 Checks).
Recording of new comorbid conditions in the year
after an NHS Check was higher in people attending
NHS Health Checks than recording in the year after the
index date in non-attendees. However, in non-attendees,
missing data are a major issue which precludes simple
direct
comparison
between
attendees
and
non-
attendees. Risk factors requiring further follow-up were
recorded in more than one in five attendees. Raised
blood pressure (≥140/90 mm Hg; but not recorded as a
diagnosis of hypertension) was identified in 18.5%
(26 126/140 995),
obesity
(body
mass
index
(BMI)
≥30 kg/m2)
in
15.0%
(32 133/151 480)
and
raised
fasting blood sugar (but not recorded as a diagnosis of
diabetes) in 2.7% (954/35 801).
In total, 33.9% of heavy and very heavy alcohol drin-
kers (1823/5376) were referred for further advice, and

 recorded at high CVD risk. As expected, those at high
CVD risk were older, with 81.0% of high-risk attendees
in the 60–74-year age group compared with 34.0% of all
attendees. Men comprised 78.3% in the high-risk group
and 47.9% among all attendees.
As expected, all other risk factors were more prevalent
in those at high CVD risk. Of the high CVD risk atten-
dees, 23.2% (4222/18 203) were obese and 28% (7743/
27 611)
were
smokers.

Of those NHS Health Check attendees at high CVD risk,
19.3% (5325/27 624) were prescribed recurrent statins
and 8.8% (2438/27 624) were prescribed recurrent anti-

REFERRALS TO BEHAVIOURAL SUPPORT
Online supplementary appendix table shows referrals for
behavioural interventions in people at high CVD risk.
Using data from tables 3 and 4, it can be shown that
most referrals took place in people at lower CVD risk
(<20% over 10 years). Of those people with behaviourally
mediated risk factors recorded—smoking, obesity and
high
alcohol
consumption—who
were
referred
for
further support during an NHS Health Check, 80.0%
were not in the high CVD risk group. Of the smoking
cessation referrals made in smokers, 17.1% (439/2571)
were in smokers at high CVD risk and 82.9% were in
people at lower risk. Of the dietary referrals made in
people with BMI ≥30 kg/m2, 13.6% (1691/12 430) were
in people at high CVD risk and 86.4% were in people at
lower risk. Similarly of the referrals for physical activity,
13.4% (1780/13 309) were in people at high CVD risk
and 86.6% were in people at lower risk. Of the total
referrals for alcohol reduction support for heavy or very
heavy drinkers, 16.5% (300/1823) were in people at
high CVD risk and 83.5% were in people at lower risk.
In total, 5.7% (1139/7743) of smokers at high CVD
risk were referred to accredited level 2 or 3 smoking ces-
sation services. In people at high CVD risk with BMI
≥30 kg/m2, 40.0% (1691/4222) were referred to dietary
and 42.2% (1780/4222) to physical activity support ser-
vices, and 33.1% (300/905) of those at high CVD risk
recorded as drinking seven or more units of alcohol per
day were referred to alcohol reduction services.

 These proportions of people at high CVD risk referred
to smoking cessation, dietary, physical activity and alcohol
services were very similar to the proportions of all atten-
dees (tables 3 and 4) who were referred, of whom 6.8%
(2571/37 808) of smokers were referred to smoking cessa-
tion, 38.7% (12 430/32 133) of BMI ≥30 to dietary and
41.4% (13 309/32 133) of BMI ≥30 to physical activity
support services, and 35.7% (1823/5101) of heavy drin-
kers were referred to alcohol reduction services.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to describe national results from
the NHS Health Check programme. In 2012, the most
recent year reported, 30.1% of the eligible population
attended. Attendance was more likely over age 65 years
19.6% than in those under 65 years (9.0%) and among
those people in the most deprived quintile (14.9%)
versus the least deprived (12.3%). In total, 12.9% of all
attendees were recorded at high CVD risk (20% or more
10-year risk). There were differences in attendance
between ethnic groups, though these could be due to
missing data. Attendance in white people was similar to
those with non-white ethnic group recorded.
New
comorbidity
identified
in
the
4-year
period
included 7844 new cases of hypertension (1 case per 27
NHS Health Checks), 1934 new cases of diabetes (1 new
case for every 110 Checks) and 807 new cases of CKD (1
new case in every 265 Checks). Records of risk factors
were more incomplete in non-attendees who had a dif-
ferent
CVD
risk
profile
to
those
who
attended.
Non-attendees were younger and more likely to be
smokers than attendees. Because of differences in the
characteristics and recording of risk factors between
attendees and non-attendees, we have not made formal
statistical comparisons of new morbidity between these
groups.
In addition to those people with new comorbidities
diagnosed, risk factors such as raised blood pressure,
raised
blood
sugar
and
obesity
requiring
further
follow-up were recorded in more than one in five of
attendees. Most referrals for behavioural interventions
took place in people at lower CVD risk. Of those people
with behaviourally mediated risk factors recorded—
smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption—who were
referred for further support during an NHS Health
Check, 80% were not in the high CVD risk group. The
proportion of people in the high CVD risk group
referred because of risk factors was similar to the pro-
portion referred among all attendees.
One in 20 attendances resulted in recurrent statin pre-
scription and 1 in 25 attendances resulted in recurrent
antihypertensive prescription. Of those NHS Health
Check attendees at high CVD risk, 19.3% were pre-
scribed recurrent statins and 8.8% were prescribed
recurrent antihypertensive therapy.

 This is a large and nationally representative study
including records of social deprivation and ethnicity.
Coverage of 30% was lower than expected, though
attendance quadrupled during the course of the study
reflecting the early phase of implementation. There was
no evidence that older people, or those in the more
deprived quintile were less likely to attend than other
groups. South Asians who have higher CVD risks were
more likely to attend than other ethnic groups. Though
missing data might account for this, similar differences
have been found in other studies.25 Currently attend-
ance at NHS Health Checks is reported as uptake in
response to invitation rather than coverage, defined as
attendance as a proportion of the eligible population as
reported in this paper.4
The NHS Health Check programme is an example of
systematic implementation at national scale, of a strati-
fied approach to advice and effective treatment in
people at increased CVD risk. QRisk2 was used in 80%
of NHS Checks reported in this study and is fully inte-
grated with the EMIS computer systems used by general
practitioners in this study and has since been recom-
mended as the risk algorithm of choice in the 2014
NICE guidance;26 an example of successful translation
of clinical decision support at scale.27 28 This algorithm
is fully integrated with the electronic primary care
record, a key enabling factor for implementation.29
LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
There is no nationally available data on the extent of
provision of the NHS Health Check outside of general
practices. However, these were likely to represent less
than 10% of NHS Health Checks undertaken, as in most
PCTs the NHS Health Check was conducted almost
entirely in general practice with limited use of commu-
nity programmes targeting hard-to-reach groups or, with
the exception of a few areas, community pharmacies.
Completeness of NHS Health Checks was not ascer-
tained, but taking measurement of cholesterol recording
of 91.5% as a proxy measure, risk ascertainment was
generally well conducted.
Of the people referred with behavioural risk factors,
80% were at lower CVD risk, which indicates the wide
distribution of risk factors and the potential for behav-
iour change if programmes can be shown to be effective.
Like other recent studies, referral rates were generally
low,30 and little is known about attendance at, or quality
of behavioural programmes even for those at higher
CVD risk. Lack of consistent coding of referrals in
earlier years of the NHS Health Check programme and
the availability of local services for behavioural change
may have contributed to low referral rates. The impact
of the NHS Health Check programme on people at
lower risk is unknown and further research is required.31
The study is descriptive and was not designed to deter-
mine variability between practices or CCGs. The study
has not assessed changes in risk factors or cardiovascular
events between comparable groups. These comparisons
are difficult in a non-randomised study, especially if one
group is at higher risk than the other or information is
incomplete. For these reasons, we have not directly com-
pared attendees with non-attendees. Communication of
results and patient behaviours following NHS Health
Checks remains an under-researched area.32–34
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
A number of local studies suggest that the programme
has been better implemented in some areas with cover-
age of 80% and statin prescription of up to 50% in high-
risk individuals in some CCGs.25 35 Nationally, uptake in
2011–2012 was reported as 45%, with high levels of vari-
ability and better uptake in more deprived areas.6
5
There is limited evidence of effectiveness35 or comorbid-
ities identified36 and statin uptake in those at high risk
was reported to be between 20% and 50%,5 25 which
accords with national surveys of 32%.37
Despite a statin treatment rate of only 19% in high-risk
attendees in this study, this is likely to have had an
important impact on CVD events in those treated.
Assuming that 1.2 million people attended a NHS
Check each year in the 5 years since 2010, of whom 10%
(120 000) were at high CVD risk averaging 2.5% per
year, and 19.3% (23 160) of these people were treated
with statins over this period and 8.8% (10 560) were
treated with antihypertensives; if each treatment reduces
cardiovascular risk by 20%, it is estimated that 2529
people would avoid a major CVD event over a 5-year
period.11
12 Higher uptake in recent years and add-
itional treatment in people at both high CVD risk and at
lower CVD risk make this a conservative estimate and
behavioural change will have further impact.37 These
estimates assume that patients who are prescribed medi-
cations take them for a 5-year period and that the
impact on outcomes is similar to that described in the
trial meta-analyses cited.
The NHS Health Check programme has had a diffi-
cult birth. The efficacy of the programme has been chal-
lenged,38–41 based largely on a review of 16 trials of
health checks, of which 12 trials were undertaken more
than 20 years ago before 1994,42–52 the year in which the
landmark 4S trial established statin effectiveness.53 This
means that 12 out of 16 of the reported studies were
conducted before statins or modern antihypertensive
drugs were used. Of the trials since 1994, only one52 spe-
cifically recommended drug treatment for CVD risk, the
other three offering advice but no drug treatment.54–56
The results of the Inter99 study of intensive lifestyle
counselling
published
subsequent
to
this
review57
showed no reduction in CVD. Despite high-quality
review of trial evidence showing net benefit,11 statins
have continued to received considerable adverse publi-
city58 59 which has been refuted.60
There have also been organisational factors that have
impacted on implementation of the programme. Major

 organisational change in the NHS in the context of
financial austerity61 62 led to one-third of staff leaving
many PCTs in the transition to CCGs in April 201363 and
commissioning responsibility for NHS Checks passed to
Local Authorities. It is perhaps not surprising that in
2013, 27/151 PCTs nationally offered NHS Health
Checks to fewer than 10% of eligible individuals and
uptake could be substantially improved.64 The most effi-
cient means to deliver this programme including delivery
through pharmacies and likely economic impact, remain
subjects for further research and debate. A range of
infrastructural issues and new research are currently
being addressed by Public Health England.65 66
This study indicates limited though improving success
in the early years of a major new national preventive pro-
gramme. Coverage of 30% and statin treatment of 19%
of attendees at high CVD risk leave considerable room
for improvement. New comorbidity and abnormal risk
factors
were
frequently
identified
in
people
who
attended an NHS Health Check. The majority of refer-
rals for abnormal risk factors were among people at
lower CVD risk. This modest start to a major new pro-
gramme at scale is likely to have made an important
impact on CVD events in people who have been treated
with statins and antihypertensives or who improved
adverse risk factors.
