Abstract
Background—The 21-gene recurrence score assay (RS) stratifies early-stage, estrogen receptor-
positive breast cancer by recurrence risk. Few studies have examined how physicians use RS to 
recommend adjuvant systemic chemotherapy or patient experiences with testing and decision-
making.
Methods—We surveyed 3,880 women treated for breast cancer in 2013-2014, identified by the 
Los Angeles County and Georgia SEER registries (response rate: 71%). Women reported 
chemotherapy recommendations, chemotherapy receipt, testing experiences, and decision

 satisfaction. Registries linked tumor data, RS, and surveys. Regression models examined factors 
associated with chemotherapy recommendations and receipt by RS and subgroups.
Results—Of 1,527 patients with Stage I-II, ER/PR(+), HER2-negative disease: 778 received RS 
(62.6% for node-negative favorable, 24.3% in node-negative, unfavorable, and 13.0% in node-
positive disease, p<.001). Overall, 47.2% of patients received a recommendation against 
chemotherapy and 40.6% received a recommendation for it. RS results correlated with 
recommendations: nearly all patients with high scores (31-100) received a chemotherapy 
recommendation (86.9%-96.5% across clinical subgroups), while the majority of patients with 
low-risk results (0-18) received a recommendation against it (49.2%-78.2% across subgroups). 
Most patients with high RS received chemotherapy (87.0%, 91.1%, 100% across subgroups), 
while few patients with low scores received it (2.9%, 9.5%, 26.6% across subgroups). There were 
no substantial racial/ethnic differences in testing and treatment. Women were largely satisfied with 
RS and chemotherapy decisions.
Conclusions—Oncologists use RS to personalize treatment, even in node-positive disease. High 
satisfaction and absence of disparities in testing and treatment suggests that precision medicine 
advances have improved systemic breast cancer treatment.

Precis: In a population-based sample of women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, the 
majority of women received 21-gene recurrence score testing, including a third of women with 
lymph node-positive disease. Test results correlated with guideline-recommended treatment in 
most cases, and patient satisfaction was high.

INTRODUCTION
A key goal of precision medicine is to reduce treatment burdens in patients with a favorable 
cancer prognosis. Precision medicine advances have influenced decisions more strongly for 
breast cancer than for other conditions.1, 2 Until recently, results from cancer staging (in 
particular, lymph node status) and from tests performed on breast tumors (estrogen and 
progesterone receptors, human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) receptor, and grade) 
largely determined clinician recommendations regarding adjuvant chemotherapy use in 
patients with newly diagnosed, early stage, curable invasive breast cancer.3, 4 In recent years, 
however, the 21-gene recurrence score assay (RS) - which stratifies a woman’s risk for 
distant breast cancer recurrence into low, intermediate, and high categories and predicts the 
marginal benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy - has diffused rapidly into clinical practice, 
supported by guidelines based on strong evidence of its clinical validity and utility.5-7
Current guidelines recommend RS testing for all patients with favorable-prognosis (ER/PR-
positive, HER2-negative, node-negative disease), but not for patients with ER/PR-positive, 
HER2-negative, node-positive disease, for which adjuvant treatment is recommended

 (independently of RS testing).3, 4 Several studies have shown that RS use for node-negative 
patients generally follows guideline recommendations with variable evidence of disparities 
in testing.8-11 Furthermore, RS results are strongly associated with treatment. RS may 
reduce overall use of chemotherapy 12, 13 because about half of tested patients have low 
scores that indicate minimal benefit from chemotherapy, while only about 10% have high 
scores that indicate a strong benefit of chemotherapy. About one-third of patients have an 
intermediate score, in which case chemotherapy’s benefit is less certain.14 A Canadian study 
showed that RS testing was followed by a marked increase in the percentage of patients who 
received a recommendation about chemotherapy, particularly against it.15 However, little is 
known about how RS results are used by medical oncologists to recommend chemotherapy, 
and whether patients follow these recommendations. Moreover, recommendations and 
decisions over testing and treatment is less understood in the United States, where RS use is 
more common and treatment occurs in more diverse settings. Published studies of RS and 
treatment decision-making have been limited by older diagnosis cohorts, lack of 
generalizability, incomplete ascertainment of RS testing and/or chemotherapy treatment, and 
by lack of granular measures of communication and decision-making linked to RS results 
and treatment.
We used a large, contemporary, diverse, population-based sample of patients recently 
diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer to examine the relationship between RS results, 
clinician recommendations, chemotherapy receipt, and patient experiences with testing and 
treatment decision-making.
METHODS
Sampling and Data Collection
The iCanCare study16 selected 3,880 women aged 20-79 diagnosed with early-stage breast 
cancer and treated in 2013-14 as captured by rapid reporting systems from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) registries of Georgia and Los Angeles County (LA). 
African-American and Latinas were oversampled in LA to ensure diversity in the sample. 
We identified cases approximately two months after breast surgical treatment. Women with 
stage III or IV cancer, tumors >5 centimeters (cm) in size, or those with >3 positive lymph 
nodes were excluded. Non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans below the age of 50 in 
LA were not available for sampling due to an ongoing study in those populations. Modified 
Dillman techniques17-18 were used to solicit high patient response rates. Women were 
invited to participate by mail with an upfront $20 cash incentive. Extensive follow-up was 
conducted for non-responders. Materials were sent in English, except for women with 
Spanish surnames who received materials in both English and Spanish.19 From 3,880 
identified women, 249 were ineligible due to a prior breast cancer diagnosis or stages III-IV; 
residing outside the SEER registry area; or being deceased, too ill, or unable to complete a 
survey in Spanish or English. Another 1,053 women did not return surveys or refused 
participation. SEER registries collect RS as part of routine surveillance operations but there 
are concerns for completeness. Through an agreement between Genomic Health, Inc. and 
the National Cancer Institute SEER Program, records from the two datasets were linked 
using probabilistic methods including manual review and adjudication of potential linked

 pairs to assure the highest specificity while simultaneously maximizing sensitivity. Results 
showed that 97.2% of patients with a SEER-confirmed RS test linked to the Genomic 
Health, Inc. test dataset. The SEER registries then provided limited SEER data and RS 
results for iCanCare participants to the University of Michigan, which were merged to 
survey data under IRB approvals from partnering Universities and State Departments of 
Public Health of Georgia and California. RS results were linked to the sample of 2,578 
women (71% of eligible patients). Our analytic sample consisted of 1,527 patients with 
Stage I-II, ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative disease.
Measures
We classified patients into three mutually exclusive clinical categories: lymph node-negative, 
more-favorable (age at diagnosis ≥50 years and/or tumor grade 1-2); node-negative, less-
favorable (age at diagnosis <50 years, and/or grade 3 disease), and node-positive. Age and 
tumor grade were used to derive subgroups as these variables are prognostic for distance 
recurrence. 3, 20 We examined three outcomes: receipt of RS testing (obtained from Genomic 
Health, Inc.), medical oncologists’ recommendation for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, 
and receipt of chemotherapy (both reported from the patient survey). RS results indicated 
whether the test was done or not and the numeric score (0-100 for tested subjects, with 
higher values reflecting increased likelihood of distant metastatic breast cancer recurrence 
and greater benefit from chemotherapy). Scores were categorized in accordance with current 
guidelines and laboratory reporting (low 0-17, intermediate 18-30, high 31-100). Surveyed 
patients reported their medical oncologists’ recommendations for adjuvant systemic 
chemotherapy across five responses: strongly against, against, left it up to the patient, for, or 
strongly for chemotherapy. We categorized these into three responses: against, left it up to 
patient, or for chemotherapy. Women indicated whether they had begun or were planning to 
begin chemotherapy, or whether they had refused/had no plans to begin chemotherapy.
Covariates were obtained from the patient survey and SEER registries. Tumor stage (I or II), 
grade (1, 2, or 3), and lymph node status (all nodes negative, 1-3 nodes positive for disease) 
were obtained from registries. Patients provided the following variables from surveys: age at 
diagnosis; education (high school or less, some college, college graduate or higher); family 
income (< $20,000/year, $20-60,000/year, >$60,000/year); race/ethnicity (white, black, 
Latina, Asian), and diagnosis of comorbidities, including chronic lung disease, heart disease, 
diabetes, or stroke (no diagnosis, one condition, two or more conditions).
We also examined patient experiences with testing and chemotherapy decisions. We first 
asked tested women how helpful RS was in making a chemotherapy decision, on a 5-point 
Likert scale (1 = not at all helpful, 5 = extremely helpful). Next, women indicated whether 
RS made them “much less”, “less”, ”no change in their mind”, “more”, or “much more” 
interested in chemotherapy. We asked women about their satisfaction with decisions 
surrounding RS and chemotherapy, on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all satisfied, 5 = 
totally satisfied).

 Statistical Analysis
First, we described the association of patient characteristics and receipt of chemotherapy and 
RS tests. We then described medical oncologists’ recommendations for adjuvant systemic 
chemotherapy by clinical group and RS score. We then assessed chemotherapy use by 
clinical and RS groups. Next, we constructed a multivariable logistic model that examined 
receipt of RS testing as a function of clinical group, comorbidities, and various demographic 
characteristics including race, education, income, and geographical site. Further, we 
estimated the effect of RS on the likelihood of chemotherapy receipt, while controlling for 
clinical group and demographic characteristics listed above. Finally, we described patient 
recall of RS testing and their satisfaction with testing and treatment decision-making.
Survey design and non-response weights were created to compensate for differential 
probability of selection and to adjust for survey non-response to report results that resemble 
the target populations in LAC and Georgia.21 To reduce potential non-response bias due to 
missing data and changes in versions of the questionnaire we multiply imputed data using a 
sequential regression multiple imputation framework.22 We generated five independently-
imputed data sets and then computed inferential statistics, combining estimates across the 
datasets.23 Unless noted, results reported used multiply imputed weighted data.(SAS version 
9.4).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows distributions of key variables from observed, unweighted data and receipt of 
testing and chemotherapy by covariate group (unweighted %), with corresponding standard 
errors and p-values. One-fifth (19.8%) had node-positive disease; 19.4% had node-negative, 
less-favorable disease; and 60.1% had node-negative, more-favorable disease. Over one-
quarter (27.3%) had one or more comorbidities. Patients were widely distributed across race/
ethnicity, education, and income. Overall, 50.9% of patients in the analytic sample received 
RS: 62.6% of those with node-negative, more-favorable disease, 24.3% with node-negative, 
less-favorable disease, and 13.0% with node-positive disease. RS testing was more common 
in the Georgia versus LA cohort (65.8% vs 34.2%, p<.001). Overall, 30.9% of patients 
received chemotherapy. Few patients in the more-favorable group received chemotherapy 
(25.2%), compared to those with less-favorable disease (30.3% less-favorable, node-
negative; 44.3% in node-positive disease). Chemotherapy use was less frequent in older 
women and those with more comorbidities. Among RS recipients (n=778), low scores 
(61.7%) were more common than intermediate (30.0%) or high scores (8.3%).
Factors associated with Recurrence Score testing
Figure 1 shows the results of a logistic regression model that estimates factors associated 
with RS receipt. Compared with women with node-negative, more-favorable disease, women 
with node-negative, less-favorable disease were more likely to receive RS (OR 1.5, 95% CI 
1.1-2.0), while women with node-positive disease were less likely to receive RS (OR 0.5, 
95% CI 0.4-0.7). Women with two or more comorbidities were less likely to receive RS than 
women without a comorbidity (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.7). There were no significant 
differences in RS use across education, income, and race/ethnicity.

 Factors associated with chemotherapy recommendations
Overall, 47.2% of patients reported that their medical oncologist recommended against 
systemic chemotherapy, 12.3% reported their oncologist left the decision to them, and 40.5% 
reported their oncologist recommended for chemotherapy. Figure 2 shows the relationship 
between RS results and medical oncologist recommendations for the three clinical groups. 
RS results were highly associated with recommendations: virtually all patients with high 
scores (31-100) received a chemotherapy recommendation (86.9%-96.5% across subgroups). 
For women with node-negative disease, the majority with low-risk RS results (0-18) 
received a recommendation against chemotherapy (65.9%-78.2% across subgroups). Most 
women with favorable-risk, node-negative disease received a recommendation against 
chemotherapy (78.2%) and 11.7% received a recommendation for chemotherapy. 
Recommendations for chemotherapy varied in untested patients: 23.1% of those in the more-
favorable group, 60.2% in the node-negative, less-favorable group and 83.2% in the node-
positive group (p<.001). Women with less-favorable disease and intermediate RS results 
(19-30) reported the highest proportion (22.9% and 20.2% node-negative and node-positive 
disease, respectively) of a neutral oncologist’s recommendation.
Factors associated with chemotherapy receipt
Figure 3 shows the distribution of chemotherapy receipt by clinical and RS groups. The 
relationship between receipt of chemotherapy and RS was consistent across the 3 clinical 
subgroups. Most patients with high RS received chemotherapy (87.0%, 91.1%, 100% for 
node-negative more-favorable, node-negative less-favorable, and node-positive groups). Low 
scores were associated with low rates of chemotherapy in all clinical subgroups (2.9%, 
9.5%, and 26.6%, respectively). Intermediate scores yielded rates between the low and high 
score groups. Absolute differences in chemotherapy receipt were particularly marked for 
patients with low RS versus no testing. In node-positive disease, 83.2% of untested women 
received chemotherapy, versus 27.2% with low RS. In node-negative favorable disease, 
13.0% of untested women received chemotherapy versus 3% in women with low RS.
Figure 4 shows results of a multivariable logistic regression model to examine the 
association between chemotherapy receipt and selected covariates. Receipt of chemotherapy 
was associated with clinical subgroups and RS scores. Compared with women who did not 
have RS, women with low-risk RS results were less likely to receive chemotherapy (OR 0.1, 
95% CI 0.1-0.2), while women with medium-risk and high-risk RS results were more likely 
to receive chemotherapy: ORs 1.4 (1.1-1.7) and 2.8 (2.0-4.0), respectively. Compared with 
women with more-favorable node-negative disease, women with node-negative disease but 
one unfavorable risk factor were more likely to receive chemotherapy (OR 4.3, 95% CI 
3.0-6.1) while women with node-positive disease were considerably more likely to receive 
chemotherapy (OR 19.08, 95% CI 13.1-27.7). Higher-income patients were more likely to 
receive chemotherapy than lower-income patients (OR 1.6, 95% 1.0-2.5) but there were no 
differences in receipt by education or race/ethnicity. To investigate differences by race/
ethnicity, we examined chemotherapy receipt by clinical subgroup, RS status, and race/
ethnicity (full results not shown). The only subgroup where white women had notably higher 
rates of chemotherapy receipt than other racial/ethnic groups was for node-positive disease

 with intermediate RS (79% in whites, 50% in Asian women and Latinas, 20% in black 
women).
Patient experiences with testing and chemotherapy decisions
We compared observed self-reported RS results to RS test results from Genomic Health, Inc. 
About three quarters (76.5%) of patients accurately reported RS receipt, and among those 
who did receive RS, 61.7% correctly reported results by category of low, intermediate, or 
high risk. Among those who received RS, 63.9% of patients reported that it was “very” or 
“extremely” helpful. Among 420 women who reported low-risk RS results, 65.0% indicated 
that RS shifted their opinion against chemotherapy, whereas 73.1% of those who reported 
high scores reported that their RS result shifted their opinion toward receipt of 
chemotherapy. Satisfaction with decision-making about RS testing and receipt of 
chemotherapy was very high (4.4 out of 5.0 for both decisions) and these scores did not 
differ substantively by whether patients did or did not receive testing or chemotherapy.
DISCUSSION
We examined patient experiences with RS and chemotherapy use in a diverse, contemporary, 
population-based sample of breast cancer patients. RS use closely followed practice 
guidelines. A majority of patients with node-negative disease received RS, but fewer node-
negative patients with less favorable characteristics (younger age or higher grade) received 
RS; this may reflect clinicians’ planned chemotherapy use for these higher-risk patients, thus 
negating the need for RS testing. Substantial RS use for node-positive patients underscores 
clinicians’ growing support of wider RS use to tailor treatment recommendations, despite 
guidelines that recommend chemotherapy (and no RS testing) for these patients. These 
results suggest that clinicians find RS useful when chemotherapy is less clearly indicated. 
Results from the RxPONDER trial will clarify the clinical utility of testing in patients with 
node-positive disease.24 The utility of RS in women with tumors < 0.5 cm without adverse 
features remains unclear.1
RS results correlated strongly with clinician recommendations and receipt of chemotherapy; 
chemotherapy was recommended in virtually all patients with high scores but discouraged in 
most patients with low scores. The RS effect appeared greatest in less-favorable disease. 
Importantly, we observed no marked educational or racial/ethnic gradient in RS testing or 
treatment. Patient recall of RS results was moderate (60% accuracy) suggesting that many 
patients deferred integration of RS results to the physician. This suggests an opportunity for 
targeted educational interventions to improve patient understanding of RS results and their 
role in patient decision making. Finally, patients were highly satisfied with the RS testing 
and treatment decision-making process.
Our findings add to prior studies that have examined RS use and treatment in breast cancer. 
In an Ontario study conducted between 2012-2013, patients and physicians completed 
surveys before and after RS testing.15 After RS results were shared, oncologists changed 
their initial recommendation 51% of the time, resulting in lower chemotherapy use. Patients’ 
decisional uncertainty was reduced after RS testing. Our study findings support low decision 
uncertainty in a diverse patient population with access to RS testing in the US. In a North

 Carolina study of women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008-2013, approximately 
40% of patients received RS, with similar rates between node-positive and node-negative 
patients9; however, RS testing was ascertained by pathology reports alone which may be 
prone to missing information.25 Our study suggests substantial RS testing and clinical 
impact in patients with node-positive disease. While investigators have documented high 
patient and clinician satisfaction with RS testing,26 others have noted substantial variations 
in the chemotherapy decision-making process.27 Potosky et al. showed that RS results were 
highly associated with chemotherapy use in a cohort that was treated prior to 2012 and 
found no socioeconomic disparities; however, few non-white patients were studied.10 Our 
study confirms the absence of socioeconomic testing differences in a large, diverse, 
population-based sample. A recent study suggested less than optimal adherence to 
guidelines with regard to testing and treatment.28 Our study suggests robust uptake of RS 
testing in guideline-concordant clinical subgroups and provides insight into reasons for 
testing patterns.
Aspects of our study merit comment. Strengths include a large, contemporary, diverse, 
population-based sample; a high response rate; valid measures of recurrence score testing 
(including actual results obtained from the laboratory); clinical and treatment variables; and 
granular measures of patient experiences and appraisal of testing and treatment. Our analytic 
techniques reduced potential non-response bias and account for missing data. However, our 
results are limited to two large geographic regions of the United States. Measures of 
communication and decision-making were ascertained through patients and do not 
necessarily represent physician perspectives.
Implications
Our results suggest that a major advance in oncology precision medicine, tumor genomic 
profiling, may improve treatment decision-making and communication. In the context of 
early-stage breast cancer, the combination of genomic test results and clinical data now 
offers more precise targeting of patients for chemotherapy, especially among those with 
node-negative disease. Additional clarity about the prediction of the marginal benefit of 
adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with intermediate score range in patients with node 
negative disease is forthcoming.29
The majority of patients studied reported that their medical oncologist made a 
recommendation for or against chemotherapy, rather than leaving the decision up to the 
patient. Personalized recommendations appear to reduce potential overtreatment with 
chemotherapy and nearly eliminated socioeconomic disparities in treatment, after 
controlling for clinical factors. This is a notable benefit of incorporating RS into breast 
cancer treatment algorithms. Oncologists’ commitment to addressing overtreatment may be 
most evident by the substantial proportion of patients with node-positive disease who 
received RS, despite current guidelines that advise chemotherapy without RS testing. The 
impact of RS testing appeared greatest in node-positive patients because their baseline use of 
chemotherapy was high, such that RS results largely served to identify node-positive patients 
with low scores for whom chemotherapy might logically be omitted. However, definitive 
evidence for the benefit of RS testing among node-positive patients awaits the results of

 clinical trials.24 Finally, our results suggest that many patients rely on their oncologist to 
incorporate RS results into chemotherapy recommendations, and that patient satisfaction 
with RS testing and treatment decisions is very high. This underscores another potential 
impact of precision medicine: to reduce lingering uncertainty and improve the patient 
experience of treatment decision-making and communication.
