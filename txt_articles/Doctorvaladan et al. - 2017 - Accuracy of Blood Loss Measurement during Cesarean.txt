Obstetrical hemorrhage is a potentially preventable cause of
maternal morbidity and mortality, and its incidence is
steadily increasing.1,2 Standardized approaches are being
adopted to improve the care of these patients.3,4 Since
poor outcomes can result from both delayed recognition
and denial of the occurrence of significant bleeding3 and
changes in maternal vital signs or laboratory parameters
often provide late or misleading information,5–7 effective
measurement of ongoing blood loss is critical to early
recognition.
Existing techniques for determining cumulative blood loss
during cesarean procedures include visual estimation and a
gravimetric method that involves weighing of soiled sponges
and measurement of fluid in suction canisters. Since visual
estimation frequently either over or underestimates the
amount of bleeding8,9 and requires continual retraining

Abstract
Objective
This study aims to compare the accuracy of visual, quantitative gravi-
metric, and colorimetric methods used to determine blood loss during cesarean
delivery procedures employing a hemoglobin extraction assay as the reference
standard.
Study Design
In 50 patients having cesarean deliveries blood loss determined by
assays of hemoglobin content on surgical sponges and in suction canisters was
compared with obstetricians’ visual estimates, a quantitative gravimetric method,
and the blood loss determined by a novel colorimetric system. Agreement between the
reference assay and other measures was evaluated by the Bland–Altman method.
Results
Compared with the blood loss measured by the reference assay (470 � 296
mL), the colorimetric system (572 � 334 mL) was more accurate than either visual
estimation (928 � 261 mL) or gravimetric measurement (822 � 489 mL). The
correlation between the assay method and the colorimetric system was more
predictive (standardized coefficient ¼ 0.951, adjusted R2 ¼ 0.902) than either visual
estimation (standardized coefficient ¼ 0.700, adjusted R2 ¼ 00.479) or the gravi-
metric determination (standardized coefficient ¼ 0.564, adjusted R2 ¼ 0.304).
Conclusion
During cesarean delivery, measuring blood loss using colorimetric image
analysis is superior to visual estimation and a gravimetric method. Implementation of
colorimetric analysis may enhance the ability of management protocols to improve
clinical outcomes.

 and constant vigilance during surgery,10 national organiza-
tions such as California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative
(CMQCC), the Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and
Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN), and the Council on Patient
Safety in Women’s Healthcare recommend weighing sponges
to quantify blood loss. While this gravimetric method fo-
cuses providers on the importance of quantitatively asses-
sing blood loss, it is cumbersome and has mixed data to
validate its accuracy.11,12
The Triton system (Gauss Surgical, Inc., Los Altos, CA) is a
novel U.S. Food and Drug Administration-cleared mobile
application on a tablet computer (iPad) that uses the enabled
tablet camera to capture images of surgical sponges. It per-
forms colorimetric image correction and analysis and uses
cloud-based machine-learning models to quantify hemoglo-
bin (Hgb) mass on surgical sponges in real time. The tech-
nology can also be used to measure the Hgb content of fluid
collected in suction canisters during surgery and is accurate
despite dilution with amniotic or other fluids. The perfor-
mance of the device has been validated in bench-top and
clinical settings.13–15
The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare
the accuracy of visual estimation, quantitative gravimetric
and colorimetric methods in determining cumulative blood
loss during cesarean delivery procedures using a validated
Hgb extraction assay method as the reference standard.
Materials and Methods
The protocol was approved by the Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center Institutional Review Board (San Jose, CA) reference
#12–003; August 12, 2013. Canister and sponge samples
from 50 consecutive patients having cesarean deliveries on
weekdays between October and December 2015 were stu-
died, and relevant patient and procedural information were
collected and deidentified. Patients with known human
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C
virus, were excluded. Standard methods of care were used
throughout the procedures including fluid administration
and the use and management of surgical sponges (RFDetect
L1818–04P01C-1 18”�18”, RF Surgical Systems, Inc.) and
suction canisters (Medi-Vac Guardian™ 65651–230 3000 mL,
Cardinal Health, Inc.). Soiled laparotomy sponges were
individually stored in sponge counting bags, and suction
canisters were affixed with a label for recording amniotic
and irrigation fluid volumes. Preprocedure and postopera-
tive day 1 Hgb values (g/dL) and all blood product transfu-
sions given in the operating room were documented.
Clinicians used only visually estimated blood loss (EBL) in
making patient management decisions; they were blinded
to results of the other assays.
For each patient, the cumulative blood loss was calculated
from direct extraction assays of Hgb content on surgical
sponges and in suction canisters. This result was compared
with the attending obstetrician’s visual estimate of blood
loss, the measured blood loss using a quantitative gravi-
metric method and the blood loss determined by the colori-
metric system.
Extraction assay: The Hgb recovery process draws from
previously published methodology.16–20 Upon completion of
each procedure, all soiled laparotomy sponges, and suction
canisters were transferred to an on-site benchtop facility for
Hgb extraction. Sponges were individually soaked in 400 mL
of normal saline, compressed by hand for 60 seconds to a
mean weight of 50 g. This process was repeated four times.
Hemoglobin concentration of the final extraction fluid was
measured using the plasma/low spectrophotometer (Hemo-
Cue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden) and incorporated into the
following formula to determine the total Hgb content of
the sponge:
where mfluid represents the mass of the extraction fluid,
mresidual the mass of the fully extracted sponge, mdry the
average dry weight of the sponge, ρ the density of the
extraction fluid approximated as 1.0 g/mL, [Hgb]fluid the
Hgb concentration of extraction fluid, and %yield the yield
of the manual rinse extraction method. The yield was
independently characterized by depositing banked blood
on sponges in known quantities and performing the same
mechanical extraction. A linear regression analysis revealed
mean mHgb recovery rates of 89.5% (95% confidence interval
[CI] ¼ 86.8–92.1%) for individual sponges (n ¼ 116).
Canister Hgb was determined by gently remixing the
effluent, and transferring a 10 mL aliquot into a centrifuge
tube. Two samples were drawn from the tube and measured
using the plasma/low spectrophotometer for canisters ran-
ging from 0 to 2.00 g/dL, or Hb201þ (HemoCue AB) for
samples ranging from 2.0 to 25.6 g/dL, per instrument
guidelines.
The canister fluid mass was measured using the digital
scale, with an approximated density conversion of 1.0 g/mL:
where meffluent represents the mass of the canister fluid, ρ its
density, and [Hgb]effluent the Hgb concentration averaged
over two samples.
The Hgb concentration in the canisters was separately
assayed by using either a whole blood or low-concentration
Hgb analyzer and converted to a canister blood volume first
by converting the blood concentration (g/dL) of the canister
to Hgb mass (g) by multiplying by the known total fluid
volume in the canister, and then by dividing this canister Hgb
mass (g) by the patient’s baseline Hgb concentration (g/dL).
All blood loss measurements (mL) were calculated by divid-
ing Hgb mass readings by the patient’s baseline (preopera-
tive) Hgb value (g/dL). The blood loss in the canisters was
then combined with the blood loss from the sponges to give a
total assayed blood loss.
Visually EBL: At the conclusion of the procedure, the
attending obstetrician visually estimated total blood loss

 canisters, knowledge of the procedural specifics, and his or
her estimate of the amount of amniotic fluid. The results
were recorded independently, and the providers were
blinded to the results of gravimetric, colorimetric or refer-
ence assay measurements to prevent confounding.
Quantitative blood loss (QBLGrav): Quantitative gravimetric
measurement methods were adopted from published guide-
lines.3 At the time of the uterine incision, the surgical
technician or nurse recorded the canister volume using the
graduated markings. After aspirating all of the amniotic fluid,
a second measurement was made, and the difference was
recorded as the estimated amniotic fluid volume. At the
conclusion of the procedure, the surgical technician recorded
the total amount of irrigation fluid used. Immediately fol-
lowing the case, all sponges and suction canisters were
individually weighed using a calibrated digital scale (A&D
Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Dry sponge weights were determined
by weighing three packs of five sponges each before the study
(mean ¼ 21 g, standard deviation [SD] ¼ 0.96 g) and pre-
measured canister weights were subtracted. To determine
the total QBLGrav estimate, all individual sponge and canister
QBLGrav measurements were tallied, and the amount of
amniotic and irrigation fluid used was subtracted. The
sponge fluid weight was expressed as a blood volume using
a 1.0 g/mL mean density conversion.
where mwet represents the mass of a soiled sponge, VspongeQBL
the gravimetric blood volume estimate on a sponge, VcanisterQBL
the gravimetric blood volume estimate in a canister, Vamniotic
the amniotic fluid volume estimate, and Virrigation the mea-
sured amount of irrigation fluid.
Colorimetric: Following the case, all surgical sponges were
collected and scanned using the Triton sponge application
(Version 2.0.9). This resulted in a measured amount of Hgb
loss per sponge (g) that was converted to a volumetric
measure based on the patient’s preprocedure Hgb value
(g/dL). Also, the surgical canisters used to collect blood and
fluid from the operative field were scanned using the Triton
canister application (Version 1.0.37–61), and the concentra-
tion of Hgb in the canisters was determined. This concentra-
tion was multiplied by the volume of fluid in the canister, and
the resultant total Hgb in the canister was converted to a
volumetric measurement of blood loss based on the patient’s
preprocedure Hgb value.
Statistical Analysis
Variables are expressed in mean � SD, median/interquartile
range or count (%) as appropriate. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test
was used to evaluate whether the continuous variables
followed a normal distribution. For parameter estimates,
95% CIs are provided. Additional analyses were performed
using t-test, Mann–Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed ranks
test, and Pearson or Spearman correlations as appropriate.
Volumetric blood loss measurement using the extraction
assay and the other measurements (EBL, QBLGrav, and colori-
metric) were compared using a two-sided paired t-test.
Agreement between the extraction assay and other mea-
surements (EBL, QBLGrav, and colorimetric) was evaluated
using the Bland–Altman method, an analysis framework that
has been widely established as the standard for the compar-
ison of the clinical differences between two different mea-
surement methods.21 The Bland–Altman bias (mean the
difference between the two measures) and upper and lower
limits of agreement (mean � 1.96 � SD) with their respective
95% CIs were computed.
As in previous studies, an acceptance criterion of � 30 g of
Hgb per case was set a priori as the clinically acceptable
maximum bias.22 This difference represents approximately
5% of the total blood volume of an average adult (Hgb content
of ~250 mL [approximately 1/2 unit] of whole blood). Prior
studies with Triton13–15 indicated that the SD of the Hgb
mass bias was relatively low (�10 g or less) compared with
the acceptance criterion (� 30 g), and therefore a sample size
of 50 cases was deemed adequate as it provided a 95% CI of �
0.5 � SD (approximately � 5 g) around the limits of agree-
ment.23 This sample size would allow 90% certainty that the
limits of a two-sided 95% CI will exclude a bias of 7.25 � SD if
there were truly no difference between the two measure-
ment methods. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS (version 13.0, SPSS, Inc.).
Results
Data were successfully collected from all 50 cases. Mean pre-
and postoperative Hgb levels were 12.2 � 1.0 and 10.8 � 1.2
g/dL, respectively (p < 0.001 for the paired comparison of
pre- and postoperative Hgb levels). One patient received a
single unit packed red cell transfusion intraoperatively.
The mean patient age was 31.9 years (range ¼ 19–44
years). Overall, 44 mothers were multiparas. All babies were
singleton. A total of 41 procedures were elective. The indica-
tions for delivery included 32 elective repeat deliveries, eight
breech presentations, and the remainder for a variety of other
reasons. Six mothers labored before delivery although all had
intact membranes. Gestational ages ranged from 31 to
41 weeks and one day with 38 being 39 weeks or greater.
The mean amniotic fluid volume as recorded intraopera-
tively by marking the suction canister for volumetric assess-
ment was 632 � 507 mL (median ¼ 500 mL, ►Fig. 1) and the
mean measured irrigation fluid volume was 759 � 437 mL.
As measured by the assay the mean amount of blood con-
tained in a laparotomy sponge was 24.5 � 20.3 mL, and the
average canister contained 236 � 137 mL of blood (►Fig. 2).
An average of 15 sponges and one canister were used for each
procedure. The mean blood loss per procedure as measured
by the assay was 470 � 296 mL (range ¼ 113–1,614 mL). In
four cases, the total blood loss exceeded 1,000 mL (►Fig. 3).

 The visual, gravimetric, and colorimetric methods of
estimating blood loss all demonstrated positive bias (mean
difference between two methods of measurement) about the
extraction assay, at 458, 352, and 102 mL, respectively. Both
the visual and gravimetric methods systematically overesti-
mated blood loss more than the clinical tolerance of 1/2 a
unit of whole blood, or 250 mL (►Table 1).
The gravimetric method was evaluated to understand the
source of its inaccuracy better. Of the 757 sponges measured,
QBLGrav exceeded the blood content determined by the assay
method in all but 8. The QBLGrav measurements exhibited
poor correlation (r2 ¼ 0.2682) with the assay and system-
atically overestimated sponge blood content (►Fig. 4) most
likely due to the addition of absorbed amniotic and irrigation
fluid to the blood collected on the sponges. This inaccuracy
persisted despite the corrections for amniotic and irrigation
fluid that were made to the total blood loss measures.
The relationship between blood losses measured by the
various methods versus the extraction assay method is de-
scribed in ►Table 2 and illustrated by scatter plots in ►Fig. 5.
Assessment of agreement between the various measurements
and the extraction assay method according to Bland–Altman
method is provided in ►Table 3 and ►Figs. 6–8.
Comment
This study demonstrates that when using an extraction assay
method as a reference standard, cumulative blood loss is

 more accurately assessed by the colorimetric method than by
either visual estimation or the widely recommended quan-
titative gravimetric method. Visual estimation demonstrated
a slightly better correlation to the assay than gravimetric
estimation because, despite adjustments, the quantitative
gravimetric method tended to overestimate blood loss con-
sistently. This was presumably due to the effects of amniotic
fluid and irrigants that inevitably mix with the blood col-
lected on surgical sponges and within suction canisters
confounding the results of weighing the sponges and mea-
suring the volume in the canisters.
The regression curve for visual estimation demonstrates a
slope well below 1.0 suggesting that the providers’ estimates
of the amount of blood loss were virtually unrelated to the
reference values (►Fig. 5A). In fact, if a few of the high
estimates were removed the slope would have approached
zero. Clinicians never estimated a blood loss of less than
500 mL, and yet the reference data demonstrates that 66% of
patients had such values. These data confirm that surgeons
and other medical personnel are inaccurate in visually
estimating blood loss.9
Historical data supporting the quantitative gravimetric
method of measuring blood loss is mixed. For example, Lilley
et al,12 concluded that in a mixed group of vaginal and
cesarean deliveries gravimetric assessment of blood loss
during postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) was effective, while
Johar et al,11 determined that in surgical procedures the
technique was frequently inaccurate due to issues such as
recording bias, amniotic fluid/saline corruption, and human
error. Data from this study illustrate the persistent chal-
lenges posed by this methodology in cesarean deliveries
where blood and nonsanguineous fluids frequently mix.
Specifically, the quantitative gravimetric technique showed
a lower correlation with actual blood loss than the colori-
metric method as evidenced by the lower R-value. This
variation includes several cases where there was a significant
deviation, both above and below the actual blood loss. In 34%
of the cases the quantitative gravimetric method overesti-
mated the blood loss by greater than 500 mL when compared
with the reference standard (mean ¼ 761 � 370 mL for those
cases) and in two cases the quantitative gravimetric method
underestimated the blood loss by more than 500 mL. How-
ever, unlike visual estimation, gravimetric methods did
effectively quantify blood losses of less than 500 mL in
many patients. The cases where the gravimetric estimate

 of blood loss was greater than the blood loss calculated from
the Hgb loss determined by the extraction assay method can
be plausibly explained by visual underestimation of the
amount of irrigation and amniotic fluid in the canister, lower
preoperative Hgb concentration (since the weight of addi-
tional plasma is included) or significant amounts of irrigation
and/or amniotic fluid on the sponges. Underestimation by
the quantitative gravimetric method likely resulted from the
reverse of these conditions.
Accurate blood loss estimation is clinically valuable and
may substantially alter the timing of interventions to control
hemorrhage. Overestimation during cesarean delivery may
lead patients, particularly those who have minimal post-
partum blood loss following the procedure, to have unne-
cessary laboratory evaluation and exposure to unneeded
medications and/or transfusions. Conversely, underestima-
tion may lead to a delay in evaluation and treatment,
particularly if further blood loss occurs postpartum. This
risk may be exacerbated by the fact that patients with
presumed low blood loss may be placed in care environ-
ments with the lower nurse to patient ratios and less
intensive
monitoring.

 underestimated blood loss may not receive appropriate
blood, or blood component therapy is potentially leading
to excessive hemorrhage from dilutional anemia and/or
coagulopathy.
A limitation of this study is that it investigated a patient
population having surgical blood losses mostly within the
normal range. The population studied did not have a sub-
stantial number of patients with excessive blood loss, and
therefore comparisons between the various methods could
not be made for that situation. Nonetheless, the colorimetric
method is likely to be accurate in patients experiencing
massive hemorrhage since the study validates the compara-
tive accuracy of colorimetry in measuring blood loss on
individual sponges and in each canister. In cases with in-
creased hemorrhage, one would expect that there would
simply be more sponges and larger volumes in the canisters.
In contrast, both visual estimation and the quantitative
gravimetric method would be prone to greater variation
with increased blood loss. A strength of this study is that a
rigorous and detailed evaluation of all three methods was
conducted and compared the results to a validated reference
standard. Although all sponge/canister image capture and
analysis in this study was done at the conclusion of surgery,
the use of this tool has previously been effectively imple-
mented “real-time” during surgical procedures, thus provid-
ing continuous and ongoing monitoring of blood loss.15
The blood losses measured in this study were typically
less than that commonly estimated for cesarean delivery.
This may be due to the failure of the extraction assay,
colorimetric and gravimetric methods to account for blood
loss on surgical drapes. Alternatively, the data could be
interpreted as demonstrating that those traditional esti-
mates are often incorrect. Further studies are needed to
determine whether data using the colorimetric method is
sufficiently accurate to predict postoperative Hgb levels and
guide therapy.
This study demonstrates that both visual and quantitative
gravimetric methods of measuring blood loss during cesar-
ean deliveries are unreliable and colorimetric image analysis
using a computer-based algorithmic system provides more
accurate results. Accurate, real-time measurement of blood
loss has the potential to facilitate proper implementation of
obstetric hemorrhage protocols to improve patient care.
Further study of these methods and workflows, particularly
in patients with larger amounts of perioperative bleeding, is
warranted.
