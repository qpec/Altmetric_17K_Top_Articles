Abstract
Background: Casein protein consumed before sleep has been suggested to offer an overnight supply of
exogenous amino acids for anabolic processes. The purpose of this study was to compare supplemental casein
consumed earlier in the day (DayTime, DT) versus shortly before bed (NightTime, NT) on body composition,
strength, and muscle hypertrophy in response to supervised resistance training.
Methods: Thirteen males participated in a 10-week exercise and dietary intervention while receiving 35 g casein
daily. Isocaloric diets provided 1.8 g protein/kg body weight.
Results: Both groups increased (p < 0.05) in lean soft tissue (DT Pre: 58.3 ± 10.3 kg; DT Post: 61.1 ± 11.1 kg; NT Pre:
58.3 ± 8.6 kg; NT Post: 60.3 ± 8.2 kg), cross-sectional area (CSA, DT Pre: 3.4 ± 1.5 cm2; DT Post: 4.1 ± 1.7 cm2; NT Pre:
3.3 ± 1.6 cm2; NT Post: 3.7 ± 1.6 cm2) and strength in the leg press (DT Pre: 341 ± 87.3 kg; DT Post: 421.1 ± 94.0 kg;
NT Pre: 450.0 ± 180.3 kg; NT Post: 533.9 ± 155.4 kg) and bench press (DT Pre: 89.0 ± 27.0 kg; DT Post: 101.0 ± 24.0 kg;
NT Pre 100.8 ± 32.4 kg; NT Post: 109.1 ± 30.4 kg) with no difference between groups in any variable (p > 0.05).
Conclusions: Both NT and DT protein consumption as part of a 24-h nutrition approach are effective for increasing
strength and hypertrophy. The results support the strategy of achieving specific daily protein levels versus specific
timing of protein ingestion for increasing muscle mass and performance.

Background
Dietary protein optimizes resistance training adapta-
tions for muscle mass accretion [1–3]. Greater pro-
tein requirements for athletes and active individuals
training to build muscle, combined with complex
schedules and/or lifestyles may compromise nutrition
strategies
that
enhance
muscle
hypertrophy
over
time. Total daily intake of protein appears to be the
most potent factor in maximizing muscle adaptation
in conjunction with resistance training [4]. However,
the
concept
of
protein
timing
implies
the
peri-workout and pre-sleep time periods may have a
special role in optimizing dietary proteins for athletic
purposes [5, 6].
The potential role of nighttime nutrition in muscle
adaptation to training is often overlooked. However,
during sleep, ingested protein is digested and absorbed
equivalent to non-sleeping periods [7, 8]. Muscle and
other tissues respond to hyperaminoacidemia during
sleep by increasing muscle protein synthesis (MPS)

 when prior resistance exercise occurs in the evening [7, 8].
In a 12-week study, the combination of evening resistance
training and supplemental casein protein lead to greater
gains in strength and muscle mass than resistance training
alone [6]. While the resistance training stimulus was con-
sistent across all participants, the group receiving the sup-
plemental casein had a significantly greater daily protein
intake (1.9 vs. 1.3 g • kg− 1 • d− 1), as the control group did
not receive an isocaloric or isonitrogenous comparator.
Furthermore, since the training stimulus was during the
evening, followed by supplemental protein, influential
elements of protein timing might exist. Thus, one of the
purposes
of
this
study
was
to
determine
whether
increased protein intake would be equally effective if the
protein was consumed before bed, versus earlier in the
day and closer to an earlier training stimulus.
Athletes are often hesitant to eat late into the evening
due to the perception that it would disrupt body fat break-
down during sleep and, in turn, leanness. However, single
night studies involving supplemental protein prior to bed
suggest that this action may not significantly disturb lip-
olysis and fat oxidation overnight [9–11]. Since protein
consumption closer to sleep likely does not influence body
leanness, such a practice can help with daily planning and
achieving appropriate levels of dietary protein. Limited re-
search has been performed examining exercise training
and supplemental protein on potential changes in muscle
size and performance and adipose tissue simultaneously.
In one study, males and females already engaged in
unsupervised exercise training were provided 54 g of
casein protein, either at night or in the morning, for
8 weeks [12]. Protein intake was increased in both groups
from 1.7–1.8 to 2.4 g • kg− 1 • d− 1 and no differences in
strength and body composition from beginning to end
were observed. Yet to date, an incremental, high-intensity,
monitored training program has not been conducted in
conjunction with supplemental casein protein (night vs
day) on measures of muscle thickness, body composition
and strength. Thus to our knowledge, this is the first lon-
gitudinal isonitrogenous, isocaloric, nighttime casein sup-
plementation study investigating the impact on body
weight (BW) and composition as well as strength and
muscle hypertrophy when an impactful resistance training
stimulus occurs earlier in the day. It was hypothesized that
the nighttime (NT) supplemented group would experi-
ence greater benefit to resistance-training induced physio-
logical changes. The results of this study are important to
athletes and active individuals who train for performance,
aesthetics, and health.
Methods
Experimental design
In
a
randomized,
double-blind,
placebo-,
diet-,
and
exercise-controlled trial, participants in the NT group were
supplemented with 35 g casein protein at night immediately
before going to sleep and 35 g maltodextrin earlier in the
day, and participants in the daytime group (DT) were
supplemented with 35 g maltodextrin at night immediately
before going to sleep and 35 g casein protein earlier in the
day. Participants were randomized to the NT or DT group
by stratified randomization based on cross-sectional area of
the rectus femoris (CSA) to balance groups based on muscle
size and strength. The supplement taken early in the day was
not consumed within 3 h of beginning or ending exercise,
nor was it consumed within 6 h of sleep. Exercise programs
and diets were prescribed for each participant, and both were
supervised and tracked throughout the intervention. Prior to
and following the intervention period, participants’ body
composition, muscle hypertrophy, and athletic performance
were assessed.
Participants
Healthy, recreationally active, 18–25-year-old males (NT:
71.4 ± 11.1 kg, 170.2 ± 3.8 cm training 4.0 ± 0.9 days/week
for prior 2.7 ± 0.52 years; DT: 79.5 ± 21.5 kg, 178.1 ± 6.5 cm
training 3.7 ± 1.1 days/week for prior 2.0 ± 0.82 years) were
screened for participation. Individuals were eligible if they
engaged in regular exercise for the previous 1–3 years at a
frequency of 2–5 days per week and were excluded for
tobacco use, excessive alcohol intake (≥ 12 drinks/week),
having history of medical or metabolic complications, as well
as use of nutritional supplements or medications that would
significantly affect study outcomes. Study protocols were ap-
proved by the Institutional Review Board at Texas Woman’s
University, and informed consent was provided by all partici-
pants prior to the investigation.
Measurements
BW was assessed using a physician’s scale (BWB-800,
Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and height by stadi-
ometer. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA; Lunar
Prodigy, General Electric Corporation, Boston, MA) was
used to assess fat mass (FM), body fat percentage (BF%),
lean soft tissue (LST), and appendicular LST (ALST).
Test–retest reliability for DEXA measurements in15
subjects, resulted in an average intraclass correlation
(ICC) of > 0.99. Ultrasonography-determined (Logiq e,
General Electric Corporation, Boston, MA) CSA of the
rectus femoris and combined muscle thickness (MT) of
the vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius were mea-
sured as previously described [13]. Briefly, CSA mea-
surements were conducted on the anterior thigh at 75%
femur length, defined as the distance from the anterior
superior iliac spine to the superior aspect of the patella,
and MT measurements were conducted at 50% femur
length, defined as the distance from the greater trochan-
ter to the lateral epicondyle of the femur. Test–retest re-
liability for ultrasound measurements, as determined

 using 5 subjects, resulted in an average ICC > 0.99. All
body composition measurements were conducted in the
morning following an overnight fast while the partici-
pant wore only lightweight athletic shorts, a t-shirt, and
socks. Leg press and bench press 1-repetition-maximum
(1RM) testing determined changes in strength. Partici-
pants were required to allow the sled to descend to a
knee angle of 900 and press back to the starting position
for a successful attempt in the leg press 1RM. In the
bench press 1RM, they were required to touch the bar
to their chest without bouncing and press back to the
starting position without lifting their hips from the
bench. A standard 3-min or 5-min rest period was used
between all warm up sets or 1RM attempts, respectively.
Participants first warmed up with the bar, followed by an
initial weight equal to approximately 50% of 1RM and
increased intensity progressively over 3–4 sets up to ~
85% 1RM for a single repetition prior to beginning 1RM
attempts at ~ 90% estimated 1RM. During mid and post
1RM testing, the final warm up set was performed at an
intensity 2.3 kg less than their previously determined
1RM for one repetition, and participants first 1RM at-
tempt was performed at an intensity 2.3 kg more than
their previously determined 1RM. Thereafter, intensity
was increased by 2.3–22.7 kg per attempt according to
participants’ apparent capabilities observed by qualified
researchers. Vertical jump (VJ) testing was conducted to
assess changes in jump height (Vertec, Perform Better,
Cranston, RI), during which peak power (PP) and vel-
ocity (PV), average power (AP) and velocity (AV), and
peak force (PF) were determined using a linear force
transducer (Weightlifting Analyzer, Tendo Sports Ma-
chines, Slovak Republic) fastened to the back of a thin
canvas belt tightened over top participants’ waistbands
during their jump attempt. Participants were weighed
fully clothed for accurate loads to be entered into the
force transducer. Test-retest reliability for performance
measures, as determined using 4 participants, resulted in
an average ICC > 0.96. All pre and post testing measures
were conducted at the same time of day to prevent diur-
nal variations. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)
and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured at
the beginning and end of each exercise session, respect-
ively, using a 10 cm visual analogue scale.
Resistance training protocol
Exercise sessions took place at training facilities on campus
and were monitored by National Strength & Conditioning
Association Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialists.
The exercise stimulus was a periodized resistance training
intervention consisting of two 5-week mesocycles, which
trained each major muscle group twice weekly. Within each
mesocycle, intensity increased as repetitions decreased
(Table 1). During week 5, the upper and lower body
strength oriented training sessions began with 1RM testing
to more accurately prescribe training loads during the
following mesocycle. During week 10, the Thursday
and
Friday
sessions
were
composed
of
only
a
warm-up to 1 repetition with each participant’s 1RM
from week 5. Intensity and number of sets and repeti-
tions were recorded during every training session.
Diet and protein supplementation
Caloric targets were established by Mifflin St. Jeor equation
with a 1.6× adjustment for activity with 1.8 g protein/kg BW
inclusive of the casein supplement, and the remainder of cal-
ories were provided as 35% fat and 65% carbohydrate. Total
daily energy intake ratios corresponded to 20% protein, 52%
carbohydrate, and 28% fat. Dietary compliance was moni-
tored throughout the study by weekly intake surveys re-
corded using commercially-available software (MyFitnessPal,
Baltimore, Maryland). Participants met weekly with re-
searchers to assist them in reaching their dietary goals.
Twenty-five grams of whey protein (ISO100, Dymatize,
Dallas, TX) was provided to all participants post
workout. Casein (as calcium caseinate; Friesland Campina,
Amersfoort, The Netherlands) and maltodextrin supple-
ments were flavor- and color-matched by the research
staff. Each serving of casein provided 35 g of protein,
< 0.5 g of fat, and < 0.5 g carbohydrate (lactose), and
each serving of maltodextrin provided 35 g of carbo-
hydrate, < 0.5 g fat, and < 0.5 g protein. Participants
were provided canisters of casein and placebo at weeks 0, 3,
and 6 with a supplement log to record time of consumption
each day. Canisters were weighed before and after being
given to the participants as a confirmatory measure of
compliance.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA
with Bonferroni post-hoc. Analyses were performed
using Statistica software (Version 10, Dell, Round Rock,
TX) and presented as means ± standard deviations. The
alpha was set at p < 0.05.
Results
Participants
Twenty males began the study and 13 completed the
entire 10 weeks while being at least 80% compliant
with the diet and exercise intervention. Four partici-
pants were removed from analyses for maintaining
less than 80% compliance per their reported diet
logs or training session attendance. One participant
from each group was removed from analyses for un-
reported
noncompliance
as
validated
by
negative
changes in both FM and LST and by participant
interview after the study. One individual was re-
moved from analyses for being an outlier for FM

 and body weight (> 3 SDs from mean). There was no
significant (p > 0.05) difference between groups in
any variables at baseline.
Nutritional intake
Total and non-supplemented intake levels for calories, pro-
tein, carbohydrate and fat are provided in Table 2. Calories
and macronutrient intakes did not differ (p > 0.05) between
groups.
Anthropometrics and body composition
A significant (p < 0.05) main effect for time was ob-
served for BW, LST, ALST, BF%, CSA, and MT (Table 3).
BW, LST, ALST, CSA, and MT increased over time,
while BF% decreased over time. No other main effects or
interactions were observed for body composition variables,
indicating the change in BF% was driven by changes in LST
(Fig. 1).
Performance and perceptual measures
No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found for total
training volume between groups (NT: 414,478.5 ± 98,618.0;
DT: 381,397.0 ± 83,108.3 kg). A significant main effect for
time (p < 0.05) was observed for leg press and bench press
1RM. A significant group x time interaction (p < 0.05) was
observed for vertical jump peak force. No other significant
(p > 0.05) effects or interactions were observed for perform-
ance measures (Table 4).
Significant group by time effects were observed for
RPE (p < 0.05) but not DOMS (p > 0.05). RPE was sig-
nificantly lower on the final 2 days (a mild tapering
phase) of the training program versus like sessions in all
previous weeks (Fig. 2). The NT group (1.8 ± 2.2 cm)

Exercise selection and order for each mesocycle is listed as well as the sets and repetitions for each exercise (SETSxREPS). Rest periods were 90 s for
hypertrophy sessions and 3–5 min for strength sessions. “SS” indicates use of a safety squat bar, “DB” indicates dumbbell, and “YTWL” is a shoulder
mobility exercise principally involving shoulder flexion and scapular retraction and depression movements. 1-exercise, 2-exercise indicate use of a
superset. All participants performed the same number of sets and repetitions (±1 repetition per set) for each exercise. Individual capabilities were met by
manipulating intensities for each exercise so the desired number of repetitions could be completed and participants would approach or achieve muscular
failure by the final set. Each 5-week mesocycle began at the greatest number of repetitions and decreased week-by-week by 1–3 repetitions to the least
number of repetitions indicated (e.g., for a range of 6–15 repetitions, week 1 = 15 repetitions, week 2 = 12 repetitions, week 3 = 10 repetitions, week 4 = 8
repetitions, week 5 = 6 repetitions). Concurrently and proportionally, intensity was increased as the number of repetitions decreased. Bench press and leg
press intensities were prescribed as a percentage of 1RM, in which 5 repetitions were performed at a load of 85% 1RM, and load was increased or
decreased by 2.5% 1RM for every 1 repetition decrease or increase, respectively

 rated the session as less strenuous than the DT group
(3.8 ± 3.2 cm).
Discussion
The results of the present investigation indicate that in-
gestion of supplemental casein protein at night or earlier
in the day similarly influence adaptations to a resistance
training program. Resistance training promotes signifi-
cant increases in muscle strength and mass when the
training stimuli is sufficient and protein intake is ad-
equate relative to training [1–4]. In the current study,
participants achieved an average training volume of
39,577 kg per week which provided the mechanical
stimulus necessary for a significant increase in muscle
strength and size. However, NT and DT groups did not
differ in rates of change for these variables or measures
of body fat and VJ performance.
Previously, it was reported that protein digestion
and absorption occurs during the night just as it does
during daytime hours or when most people are awake [7, 8].
One of the first studies to demonstrate the positive anabolic
effect of exogenous nighttime protein on whole body protein

 balance studied older men who were provided 40 g of casein
at 0200 via a nasogastric tube versus a volume matched
bolus of water [7]. Furthermore, overnight muscle protein
fractional synthetic rates were on average 55% greater with
the provision of protein. The potential incremental impact of
exercise on nighttime whole body and muscle protein bal-
ance was evaluated in young males engaged in an evening
resistance exercise session and receiving 40 g casein, 30 min
before bed (2330) [8]. Whole body protein synthetic rate and
net protein balance were increased with the latter adjusted
from a potentially net negative to positive balance (61 ± 5 vs
− 11 ± 6 μmol/kg during 7.5 h of sleep) [8]. Furthermore,
mixed muscle protein synthetic rates were ∼22% higher in a
trial that included 40 g casein achieving a borderline level of
significance (p = 0.05) [8].
Acute response studies (single dose) reinforce the
idea that net whole body and muscle protein balance
can be influenced by protein consumption and that
the entire 24 h of a day is available for strategic protein
consumption. Specifically, casein protein consumption
during the NT period appears to be as responsible for the
observed outcomes as casein protein consumption during
the DT period. This capability permits greater flexibility
during waking hours to achieve a positive protein balance.
In theory, this translates to incremental increases in
hypertrophy and strength over time. To challenge this
concept, a recent study used males engaged in a progres-
sive, 12-week resistance training program in the evening
with one group consuming a protein-based supplement
(27.5 g protein + 15 g carbohydrate) every night before
sleep [6]. Significantly greater muscle strength as well as
quadriceps CSA and microscopically greater increases in
Type II muscle fiber size were observed in the protein
supplemented group. Two important aspects of this
experimental design are that the protein supplemented
group consumed significantly more total protein daily (1.9
vs 1.3 g/kg) and the exercise stimulus was in the evening
followed by low-protein meal (10 g protein, 37 g carbohy-
drate, 9 g fat), limiting possible conclusions about NT
protein consumption opposed to total protein consump-
tion. The current findings do not support localization to
the DT period, favoring total daily protein intake as a
predictor of adaptation when supplied in recommended
quantities [10, 11]. Furthermore, supplements in the
current study were consumed at least 3 h removed from
exercise, preventing a timing effect relative to exercise that
may have been present in the previous research.
Casein is an anecdotally obvious choice for NT pro-
tein supplementation, as it is not acid-stable and
tends to gel in the stomach and empties in the small
intestine at a slower rate than other proteins, result-
ing in a prolonged period of aminoacidemia [9, 14,
15]. Conceptually, this may be beneficial since sleep
would prevent consumption of the next meal (e.g.,
breakfast) by about 6–8 h. While casein provides a
steady release of amino acids for several hours, this
may not only support muscle protein synthesis, but
also help limit muscle protein breakdown [14]. When
comparing whey to casein, whey leads to a faster and
greater early hyperaminoacidemia and one potential
compensating strategy would be to consume more ca-
sein. This could support maximizing MPS after high
volume workouts [16]. The present study used 35 g
of casein protein which is comparable to the level of
casein used in previous nighttime protein studies [6–
8]. Furthermore, nighttime calories, either in the form
of protein or carbohydrate, did not lead to increases
in fat mass. Most likely this is due to alignment be-
tween
energy
requirements
and
dietary
provision;
however, it also supports the notion that eating a
smaller caloric load before sleep will not lead to
changes in body composition versus ceasing to con-
sume food or supplements past early evening. In a re-
cent study, the provision of 54 g of protein before
bed did not influence body composition [12]. The use
of casein in the present study may also have influ-
enced the results. Casein is digested over a period of

 ~ 6–7 h and may not robustly increase MPS when
consumed in isolation compared to proteins like soy or
whey [17]. The present study, limited by sample size, ob-
served greater, albeit nonsignificant, advantages for DT vs.
NT consumption of protein for increasing LST. Moreover,
the sterile nature of the study (e.g., diet control, total pro-
tein control), in effect, limited total protein consumption
due to the fact ~ 50 g of protein were supplemented daily
and some quantities of lower quality plant proteins were
consumed during participants efforts to meet carbohy-
drate intake requirements. Therefore, another hypothesis
is that it could be possible for DT casein consumption to
create an “elevated baseline” for hyperaminoacidemia,
thereby reducing the absolute amount of dietary protein
necessary to maximize protein synthesis in meals con-
sumed during the 6–7 h postprandial period following ca-
sein supplementation [14]. As protein and its constituent
amino acid, leucine, are believed to maximally stimulate
protein synthesis at a certain threshold (e.g., 2.5-3 g leu-
cine), it is conceivable that DT participants individual
meals consumed up to 6–7 h following casein ingestion
had a cumulative effect on amino acid and leucine con-
centrations, which was not possible with NT casein sup-
plementation, and more frequently or robustly stimulated
MPS [18, 19].
Conclusions
The
results
of
this
study
suggest
that
strategic,
performance-supporting nutrition should be considered on a
24-h basis to optimize positive net body and muscle protein
balance. Supplemental protein provided prior to sleep sup-
ports positive changes in muscle hypertrophy and strength
in a manner like earlier in the day and in greater proximity
to the timing of the training session. Therefore, NT con-
sumption of protein may not be a special time period for
protein consumption, but it may be treated as an equally ef-
fective time to consume protein to meet protein intake goals.
One limitation of the study is the final number of partici-
pants. The rate of voluntary and guided dropouts was influ-
enced by the naive state of the participants and long-term
commitment to the rigors of the training schedule and nutri-
tion compliance. It is possible that potential differences
would be undetectable without more participants. These
findings are helpful to coaches, dietitians, and athletes as they
plan nutrition and supplementation strategies to support
higher levels of strength training.
