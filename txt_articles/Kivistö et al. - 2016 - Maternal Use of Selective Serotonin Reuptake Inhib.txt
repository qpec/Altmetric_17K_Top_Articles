Abstract
Background
Antenatal depression affects up to 19% of pregnant women. Some of these women are also
in need of antidepressant treatment. Nevertheless, the impact of maternal antidepressant
treatment and prenatal depression on the course of pregnancy, foetal development and
delivery outcomes is not fully understood.
Methods
We analysed data from 24 818 women who gave birth at Kuopio University Hospital
between 2002–2012. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate associations
between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy and
the progression of pregnancy, development of the foetus and delivery outcomes.
Results
Altogether, 369 (1.5%) women used SSRIs. A regression model adjusted for age, overweight,
nulliparity, prior termination, miscarriages, smoking, maternal alcohol consumption, chronic ill-
ness and polyhydramnion showed that pregnant women exposed to SSRI medication had
significantly lower Apgar scores at 1 minute (p < 0.0001) and 5 minutes (p < 0.0001) and
more admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (p < 0.0001) than unexposed pregnant
women. In addition, exposed newborns had longer umbilical cords (p < 0.0001) than non-
exposed newborns.

 Conclusion
In addition to the previously known associates with maternal SSRI exposure, such as low-
ered Apgar scores, SSRI exposure appeared to be associated with increased umbilical
cord length. The observation related to increased umbilical cord length may be explained by
an SSRI-induced increase in the movements of the developing foetus.
Introduction
Antenatal depression is a common condition that affects approximately 7–19% of pregnant
women [1, 2]. Of these women, approximately 7–9% have been estimated to use antidepressant
medication during the prenatal period [3, 4]. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are
considered relatively safe for treating psychiatric conditions during the antenatal period [5].
Nevertheless, increased risks for some maternal and foetal conditions, such as spontaneous
miscarriages and low birth weight, have been reported [6, 7].
In the past several years, the use of SSRI medication during the antenatal period has sub-
stantially increased; SSRIs are nowadays the most frequently used antidepressant medication
for depressive disorders generally, and also during pregnancy [4]. Antenatal SSRI use may lead
to pregnancy complications such as spontaneous miscarriages and preeclampsia [7–9]. Mater-
nal SSRI medication has also been associated with poorer delivery outcomes such as preterm
birth, low birth weight, birthweight low for gestational age (SGA) and low Apgar scores [6, 10
–14]. In addition, SSRI medication during the antenatal period has been linked to neonatal
adaptation difficulties and shortness of breath in the offspring [15, 16]. Newborns of pregnant
women exposed to SSRI medication also had more neonate intensive care unit admissions than
unaffected mothers [11, 15]. Nevertheless, findings regarding antenatal SSRI drug use and its
effects on the progression of pregnancy, delivery outcomes and the cognitive and emotional
development of the child are somewhat conflicting [5, 6, 13]. Such discrepancies may be
explained by differences in the investigated populations, such as varying criteria for sample
selection. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis [5] concluded that a sufficient amount of direct
evidence was only available to evaluate antidepressant effects on preterm birth, neonatal con-
vulsions and respiratory distress. In the same meta-analysis, only the likelihood of respiratory
distress was elevated in mothers using antidepressant medications.
The aim of this retrospective cohort study, utilizing a large naturalistic cohort collected dur-
ing ten consecutive years, was to investigate the effects of SSRI exposure on the progress of
pregnancy, development of the foetus and delivery outcomes in one single unit using uniform
diagnostic criteria and treatment policies.
Materials and Methods
2.1 Study setting and subjects
We analysed data from 24 818 women who gave birth at Kuopio University Hospital, located
in Eastern Finland, between 2002–2012. Kuopio University Hospital is a tertiary level perinatal
centre in Eastern Finland and also the only delivery hospital in the North Savo district, and the
data therefore covered the entire population of women giving birth in the area. The data were
gathered retrospectively from the hospital birth register. All the utilized data were anonymous
and contained no personal information. Therefore, in accordance with Finnish legislation, no

 informed consent was required. The Ethics Committee of the Kuopio University Hospital
approved the study. (Reference number 93/2008).
2.2 Background variables
The hospital register data were originally collected using a questionnaire. First, the participants
filled in the background information section of the questionnaire. The rest of the questionnaire
was completed by a midwife during interviews conducted at antenatal maternity health care
visits and at delivery in Kuopio University Hospital.
In the questionnaire, the participants reported the use of contraceptives (yes/no), regular
smoking (yes/no), alcohol consumption (yes/no) and possible chronic illnesses (yes/no). The
chronic illnesses comprised arterial hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis and other systemic con-
nective tissue diseases, heart defects, asthma, kidney diseases, epilepsy and thyroid diseases.
The numbers of previous caesarean sections, labours and terminations were reported by the
participants and the information was completed by midwife interviews. The birth register
included information regarding delivery outcomes. In addition, information on the newborns
from immediately after birth until the age of seven days was available for all pregnancies lasting
more than 22 gestational weeks.
2.3 Measurements
After each delivery, the placenta was routinely examined by trained nursing staff. Placental
weight was measured in grams with the umbilical cord and membranes attached. The insertion
and the length of the umbilical cord were examined and measured in a validated way, as previ-
ously described [17]. The umbilical cord length was measured and expressed as a standard
deviation (SD) from the gestational age- and sex-specific mean values according to growth
curve measurements, as previously described [17]. Diagnoses of velamentous umbilical cord
insertion and placental abruption were set clinically or by ultrasound examination by the deliv-
ery team. The amniotic fluid volume was assessed by trained nursing staff during the delivery
and classified into three groups: the normal, oligo- or polyhydramnion group. The amniotic
fluid volume was not routinely examined using the ultrasound procedure.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the
squared height in metres. The diagnosis of GDM was based on the contemporary criteria of
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): fasting blood glucose > 4.8 mmol/l, 1-hour blood
glucose > 10.0 mmol/l and 2-hour blood glucose > 8.7 mmol/l until September 2001, and
since September 2001, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 4.8 mmol/l, 1-hour plasma glucose
(PG) > 11.2 mmol/l and 2-hour plasma glucose > 9.9 mmol/l. One or more elevated values
during an OGTT resulted in the diagnosis of GDM [18]. The criteria of the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) were used to define preeclampsia: systolic blood
pressure � 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure � 90 mmHg in two separate measurements
at least 6 h apart after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman with a 24-h
urinary protein excretion of � 0.3 g [19]. Maternal anaemia was defined as haemoglobin levels
below 120 g/l. Amnionitis diagnosis was based on the ICD-10 code and clinically set by obste-
tricians at the time of delivery. Birth was considered preterm when the infant was delivered
before gestational week 37. Low birth weight was defined as a birth weight of less than 2500 g.
Newborns were considered small for gestational age (SGA) when the sex- and age-adjusted
birth weight was below the tenth percentile, according to the Finnish standards [20]. Low
Apgar scores were defined as score of less than 7 at 1 or 5 minutes. In the case of several abnor-
malities at the same time, such as preterm birth and a small size for the gestational age, all the
recorded abnormalities were considered as independent variables.

 2.4 Antidepressant use
Altogether, 1.7% of all pregnant women in this study (n = 24 818) used antidepressant prepara-
tions (n = 416). The most common antidepressant group was SSRIs (n = 369). Eleven women
were excluded from the SSRI group due to combined therapy with an SSRI and an antidepres-
sant belonging to another pharmacological group. Therefore, the study group consisted of 358
women using only antidepressants belonging to the SSRI group during pregnancy. The SSRIs
used, ranked according to the frequency of use, were citalopram (n = 217), sertraline (n = 56),
fluoxetine (n = 54), paroxetine (n = 34) and fluvoxamine (n = 4). Seven women from the SSRI
group (n = 358) used two different SSRI antidepressants at the same time during the preg-
nancy. In the drug-specific analysis, we excluded seven mothers due to combined SSRI therapy
with two different SSRI antidepressants. In addition, the fluvoxamine group (n = 4) was
excluded due to the small group size. Therefore, the SSRIs used in the drug-specific data
included citalopram (n = 215), sertraline (n = 49), fluoxetine (n = 51) and paroxetine (n = 32).
Women using antidepressant agents belonging to pharmacological groups other than SSRIs
were excluded due to the small group sizes precluding sufficiently powered analyses of prepara-
tions belonging to specific antidepressant classes (tricyclic antidepressants: n = 41; venlafaxine:
n = 23; mirtazapine: n = 13; trazodone: n = 1). The control group (n = 24 402) consisted of the
pregnant women not using any antidepressant medication.
2.5 Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS 19.00 for Windows. Differences between women using SSRI
medication (n = 358) and those not using antidepressants (n = 24 402) were assessed using the
χ2 test and Fisher’s exact test for dichotomous variables. Continuous variables were analysed
using the Student’s t-test. P values <0.05 were considered significant.
Multivariate analysis was conducted with logistic regression (dependent variable: exposure
to SSRIs vs. no exposure) and adjusted for all mother-related factors and risks related to preg-
nancy and labour that were statistically significant in the unadjusted group difference analyses.
In this study, the variables included in the multivariate analyses were mother’s age > 35 y (yes/
no), pre-gravid BMI > 26 (yes/no), nulliparity (yes/no), prior miscarriage (yes/no), prior ter-
mination (yes/no), chronic illness (yes/no), gestational diabetes (yes/no), maternal alcohol con-
sumption (yes/no), maternal smoking > 5 cigarettes per day (yes/no) and polyhydramnion
(yes/no). The multivariate analyses were separately conducted for each delivery outcome: (1)
preterm delivery, 2) caesarean, 3) low (<7) Apgar score at 1 min, 4) low (<7) Apgar score at 5
min, 5) neonatal intensive care, 6) vacuum assistance, 7) perinatal mortality, 8) low birth
weight (<2500 g), 9) SGA (<10th centile), 10) LGA (>10th centile), 11) umbilical cord length
<5th centile, 12) umbilical cord length <10th centile, 13) umbilical cord length >90th centile,
14) umbilical cord length >95th centile, 15) head circumference <10th centile, 16) head cir-
cumference >90th centile, 17) length of the child <10th centile, and 18) length of the child
>90th centile.
Results
3.1 Maternal Risk factors
Distributions of the maternal risk factors are presented in Table 1. Pregnant women exposed to
SSRI medication had a higher pre-gravid BMI, used alcohol and smoked during pregnancy
more often than women not exposed to SSRIs. In addition, the SSRI group had greater rates of
terminations, miscarriages and chronic illnesses. Moreover, nulliparity was more common in
the SSRI group.

 3.2. Pregnancy and delivery characteristics
Pregnancy and delivery related variables are presented in Table 2. With regard to pregnancy
characteristics, gestational diabetes (p = 0.002) and polyhydramnion (p = 0.04) were more
common in the SSRI group compared with women not exposed to SSRIs. The duration of preg-
nancy was significantly shorter in women exposed to SSRIs (p = 0.02). Moreover, women
exposed to SSRIs displayed more hospital care days after delivery (p < 0.0001), a higher placen-
tal weight (p = 0.03), longer umbilical cords (p < 0.0001) and a smaller newborn head circum-
ference (p = 0.01) than women not exposed to SSRIs.
3.3. Multivariate analysis of pregnancy and delivery outcomes
After adjustments for maternal age, pregravid BMI, nulliparity, previous terminations, previ-
ous miscarriages, smoking, alcohol consumption, chronic illness, gestational diabetes and poly-
hydramnion, having low Apgar scores (<7) at 1 and 5 minutes was also associated with an
increased likelihood of belonging to the SSRI group at an odds ratio of 2.3 at 1 minute
(p < 0.0001) and 2.3 at the age of 5 minutes (p < 0.0001) (Table 3). Moreover, being admitted
to the neonatal intensive care unit was associated with a 2.2-fold increased likelihood of
belonging to the SSRI group (p < 0.0001).
Table 4 presents the results of multivariate analyses regarding the delivery outcomes
between the study groups. Having an umbilical cord length over the 90th centile was associated
with a 1.6-fold, and a length over the 95th centile with a 1.7-fold likelihood of belonging to the
SSRI group. Differences in umbilical cord length among women with and without SSRI medi-
cation at different gestational ages are illustrated in Fig 1.

tine, citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline) used in the study. Admission to a neonatal

 intensive care unit and an umbilical cord length over the 90th centile were associated with all
antidepressant types except sertraline.
Discussion
We observed a novel association between maternal SSRI antidepressant use and an increased
length of the umbilical cord in this cohort of more than 24 000 pregnant women. The findings
remained significant after adjustments for a number of potential confounding factors. The
increase in the length of umbilical cord appeared to be consistent at different gestational stages,
suggesting that the finding did not simply occur by chance in pregnancies going to term. In
addition, we replicated some of the observations derived from other cohorts, such as an
increased likelihood of lower Apgar scores in pregnant women using SSRI medications.
The newborns of mothers exposed to SSRI medication had lower Apgar scores than the con-
trols, which was line with previous observations [10,13]. Moreover, similarly to others [11, 14],
we observed that the newborns of pregnant women exposed to SSRIs had more neonatal inten-
sive care unit admissions than the control group. However, we observed no correlation between

 maternal SSRI use and a low birth weight or a preterm delivery. These observations are in line
with some [14, 17, 21], but not all previous studies [6, 7, 10–12, 15, 22].
The association between increased umbilical cord length and maternal SSRI use has not pre-
viously been observed. We observed that a longer umbilical cord was associated with belonging
to the fluoxetine, citalopram and paroxetine group. Such a finding may be explained by the ten-
dency of SSRI antidepressants to induce increased foetal movement in the uterus, which may
in turn lead to lengthening of the umbilical cord. This hypothesis is based on the finding that
movements of the foetus stretch the umbilical cord, indicating that hyperactive foetuses have
longer umbilical cords than more passive foetuses [23]. The hypothesis is also supported by
some previous studies demonstrating that the umbilical cord is longer in pregnancies where
the uterine cavity is larger due to advancing parity, GDM or polyhydramnion, or when the
birth weight is higher [17,24–27]. In our study, GDM and polyhydramnion were more

 common among SSRI-medicated mothers; however, adjustments for these factors did not alter
the results.
Movements of the foetus and polyhydramnion are not the only factors determining the
length of the umbilical cord during pregnancy. The gender of the foetus, the mother’s pre-
gravid weight and maternal weight gain also affect the length of the umbilical cord [28]. Female
foetuses typically have shorter umbilical cords than male foetuses [17, 24, 26, 27]. Nevertheless,
we observed no significant differences in foetal gender or maternal weight gain during preg-
nancy between the SSRI group and the control group. A few late pregnancy factors are also
considered to modify umbilical cord length. Foetuses in breech presentation move less, which
shortens the length of the umbilical cord [24]. However, the occurrence of breech presentation
was similar between groups and therefore unlikely to have affected the results. Moreover, nulli-
parity might also result in shorter umbilical cords [26], and nulliparity was more common in
the SSRI antidepressant group. However, adjustments for parity did not affect our findings.
A longer umbilical cord may reduce foetal circulation, wrap around the neck of the foetus
and cause problems in the late period of pregnancy and labour. One retrospective study sug-
gested that longer umbilical cords may associate with brain imaging abnormalities and/or
abnormal neurological development in the offspring [29].
Our study had a reasonable sample size with 376 SSRI medicated mothers, and the data cov-
ered the entire population of labours between 2002 and 2012 in one university hospital. The
use of antidepressant medication was reported by participants with a questionnaire and re-
checked at admission to the hospital, adding to the reliability of the data concerning
Fig 1. The mean umbilical cord length (± SD) in women with and without SSRI medication during
pregnancy at different gestational ages.

 antidepressant use. Furthermore, we were also able to investigate the potential confounding
effects of several maternal and pregnancy related factors on the observed associations.
Some limitations need to be taken into consideration while interpreting our findings. Firstly,
due to a study setting that was based on the contents of an existing health register, we were
unable to take into account the effect of diagnosed depression or depressive symptoms on the
course of pregnancy and development of the foetus. This is a major weakness of the study,

maternal age over 35 y, BMI (pregravid) over 26, nulliparity, prior termination, miscarriage, maternal smoking (>5 cigarettes/d), maternal alcohol consumption,
chronic illness, gestational diabetes and polyhydramnion.

 since the underlying depression itself may increase the risk of some pregnancy and delivery
complications, such as preterm birth [30]. Nevertheless, we replicated many of the previously
known observations that have been linked with SSRI use, and are not aware of any previous
data suggesting that depression as such would lead to an increased umbilical cord length. Sec-
ondly, our data did not include information on the trimester-specific use of the SSRI medica-
tion or the administered dose of the medication. Such information could have helped to
pinpoint the mechanisms underlying the observed changes, as the medication effects may be
linked to certain developmental states of the foetus.
