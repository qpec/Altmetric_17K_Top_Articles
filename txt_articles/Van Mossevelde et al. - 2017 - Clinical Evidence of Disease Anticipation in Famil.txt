IMPORTANCE Patients carrying a C9orf72 repeat expansion leading to frontotemporal
dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have highly variable ages at onset of disease,
suggesting the presence of modifying factors.
OBJECTIVE To provide clinical-based evidence for disease anticipation in families carrying
a C9orf72 repeat expansion by analyzing age at onset, disease duration, and age at death in
successive generations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was performed from June 16, 2000,
to June 1, 2016, in 36 extended Belgian families in which a C9orf72 repeat expansion was
segregating. The generational effect on age at onset, disease duration, and age at death
was estimated using a mixed effects Cox proportional hazards regression model, including
random-effects terms for within-family correlation and kinship. Time until disease onset or
last examination, time from disease onset until death or last examination, or age at death was
collected for for 244 individuals (132 proven or obligate C9orf72 carriers), of whom 147 were
clinically affected (89 proven or obligate C9orf72 carriers).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Generational effect on age at onset, disease duration, and
age at death.
RESULTS Among the 111 individuals with age at onset available (66 men and 45 women; mean
[SD] age, 57.2 [9.1] years), the mean (SD) age at onset per generation (from earliest-born to
latest-born generation) was 62.5 (8.3), 57.1 (8.2), 54.6 (10.2), and 49.3 (7.5) years. Censored
regression analysis on all affected and unaffected at-risk relatives confirmed a decrease in age
at onset in successive generations (P < .001). No generational effect was observed for disease
duration or age at death.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The clinical data provide supportive evidence for the
occurrence of disease anticipation in families carrying a C9orf72 repeat expansion by means
of a decrease in age at onset across successive generations. This finding may help clinicians
decide from which age onward it may be relevant to clinically follow presymptomatic
individuals who carry a C9orf72 repeat expansion.

F
rontotemporal lobar degeneration is a heterogeneous
neurodegenerative disorder with predominant atro-
phy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes of the brain,
clinically characterized by behavioral and/or language defi-
cits.About15%ofpatientswithfrontotemporaldementia(FTD)
also develop amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a motor
neuron disease clinically characterized by progressive muscle
weakness, muscular atrophy, fasciculations, and spasticity.1
C9orf72 (OMIM 614260) repeat expansions are the most com-
mon genetic cause of familial FTD (25% of cases) and familial
ALS (37% of cases).2 Up to 88% of patients with familial FTD
or ALS with both clinical phenotypes have the C9orf72 repeat
expansion.3,4
Highly variable ages at onset have been reported in indi-
viduals who carry the C9orf72 repeat expansion, which is sug-
gestive of the influence of modifying factors.5-7 In a Belgian co-
hort, evidence was provided for the existence of repeat
expansions as short as 45 repeat units that are pathologic.5 The
study also showed that short repeat expansions of less than 80
repeatunitsareinverselycorrelatedwithlateragesatonset.Re-
peatexpansionsofmorethan80repeatunitsaredifficulttosize
accurately because of their large size—up to 4400 repeats cor-
responding to near 27 Kb8—and the enormous variability in re-
peat sizes produced by somatic mosaicism masking the true
length of the C9orf72 repeat expansion. However, an associa-
tion was observed between the methylation state and the ex-
pansion size in blood and the brain. Consequently, the degree
of methylation, which is measurable, is a reflection of the re-
peat expansion size. In informative C9orf72 parent-child trans-
missions,earlieragesatonset,increasingexpansionsizes,and/or
increasingmethylationstateswereidentifiedinaccordancewith
disease anticipation.5
Disease anticipation is a well-known phenomenon occur-
ringinrepeatexpansiondisordersthataffectsexpressionofthe
disease.Repeatexpansionsaredynamicmutationsinwhichthe
copy number of simple DNA repeats is unstable. Conse-
quently, these repeats are at risk of changes in repeat size when
they are transmitted to the next generation. Clinically, in sev-
eralrepeatexpansiondisorders,adecreaseinageatonsetofthe
disorder is observed in successive generations.9-11 In addition,
in later-born generations the clinical phenotype becomes more
severe in association with increasing repeat expansion sizes.12
The risk of increased repeat expansion in successive gen-
erations can be influenced by several factors. In Huntington
disease, larger expansions are less stable than shorter ones
and disease anticipation is more common in paternal
transmissions,13 while in other repeat expansion diseases an-
ticipation can be predominant in maternal inheritance.11 A de-
crease in repeat size can also occur, which might be influenced
by the sex of the parent who transmits the repeat.12
Because of the enormous size of the C9orf72 expansions in
most carriers, it remains difficult to gather enough experimen-
tal proof for a role of genetic anticipation in most transmis-
sions. Therefore, we aimed to provide additional clinical-
based evidence for the occurrence of disease anticipation in
families carrying a C9orf72 repeat expansion by analyzing age
at onset, disease duration, and age at death in successive
generations.
Methods
Study Population
We investigated families with a C9orf72 repeat expansion as-
certained in Belgium. The index patients of these families be-
long to large cohorts of patients with a clinical diagnosis of FTD
(n = 462), ALS (n = 215), both clinical phenotypes (n = 46), or
Alzheimer disease dementia (n = 1221). Recruitment of pa-
tients took place from June 16, 2000, to June 1, 2016, by
neurologists of different university and general hospitals, col-
laborating in the framework of the Belgian Neurology Consor-
tium. Index patients were evaluated using a protocol that in-
cludedadetailedpersonalandfamilialmedicalhistory,clinical
neurologicexamination,neuropsychologicaltesting,biochemi-
cal analyses, and neuroimaging. The diagnosis of FTD was
made according to the international consensus criteria.14,15 Di-
agnosis of ALS was made according to the revised El Escorial
criteria.16,17DiagnosisofAlzheimerdiseasedementiawasmade
according to the diagnostic criteria from the National In-
stitute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and
Stroke and the Alzheimer’
s Disease and Related Disorders
Association18 and the diagnostic criteria from the National In-
stitute on Aging–Alzheimer’
s Association.19 All available medi-
cal records were reviewed by a physician on the research team
(S.V.M.).
Indexpatientsandtheirrelativeswerecontactedbytrained
research nurses (K.P. and M.M.). Detailed information on fam-
ily history of dementia and/or ALS was gathered, and family
members were asked to participate in genetic studies. Writ-
ten informed consent for participation in the genetic studies
was obtained from participants or their legal guardians. The
informed consent forms for patient ascertainment were ap-
proved by the local ethics committees of each of the collabo-
rating neurological centers (Antwerp University Hospital, Uni-
versityHospitalsLeuven,UniversityHospitalGhent,University
Hospital Brussels, Saint-Luc University Hospital Liège, Hos-
pital Network Antwerp, General Hospital Sint-Jan Brugge-
Oostende, General Hospital Sint-Maria Halle, and Jessa Hos-
pital Hasselt). The genetic study protocols and informed
consent forms were approved by the ethics committee of
theUniversityHospitalofAntwerp,Antwerp,Belgium,andthe
University of Antwerp, Antwerp.
Key Points
Question Is there clinical evidence for the occurrence of disease
anticipation in families carrying a C9orf72 repeat expansion?
Findings In this cohort study within 36 C9orf72 pedigrees, a
significant decrease in age at onset was seen across successive
generations, but no generational effect was seen on disease
duration or age at death.
Meaning These data provide supportive evidence for the
occurrence of disease anticipation in families carrying a C9orf72
repeat expansion and may help clinicians decide from which age
onward it may be relevant to clinically follow presymptomatic
individuals who carry a C9orf72 repeat expansion.

Families of index patients carrying a C9orf72 repeat ex-
pansion were included in the current study if information was
available about the ages at onset and/or ages at death of clini-
cally affected individuals or unaffected family members car-
rying a C9orf72 repeat expansion in at least two generations,
after exclusion of the youngest generation with no affected
family members carrying a C9orf72 repeat expansion yet. A
total of 36 families were included in the study. The ages of in-
dividuals who died at a young age (<25 years) without devel-
opment of the disease were excluded. To reduce bias to co-
hort effects, we numbered the earliest-born generation in each
pedigree as generation 4 irrespective of the amount of gen-
erations with available age data, creating a mixture of birth
cohorts across generations (eTable 1 in the Supplement). In-
formation on which family members were clinically affected,
regardless of whether blood samples were available, was
gathered by a physician (S.V.M.) and trained research nurses
(K.P. and M.M.). Clinical files of affected family members were
collected and reviewed. The ages at onset of affected family
members were determined as the age at which the first symp-
toms occurred, based on information in the clinical files or in-
formation received from living relatives if no clinical files were
available (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We used mixed effects Cox proportional hazard regression
models (Coxme package in R [The R Foundation for Statisti-
cal Computing]) to study the generational effect on age at on-
set, age at death, or disease duration. This family-based analy-
sis gives information on more than 1 consecutive generation
and enabled us to account for the degree of kinship (deter-
mined using kinship2 in R) in the model, and allowed us to in-
clude both affected and unaffected individuals. In the initial
mixed effects Cox proportional hazard regression models, kin-
ship, family, sex, phenotype, source of information about age
at onset (personal clinical file, clinical file of relative, or hear-
say from living relative) (in models for age at onset and dis-
easeduration),meanlifeexpectancyperbirthcohortof25years
(based on data from the Federal Public Service Statistics Bel-
gium) (in models for disease duration and age at death), age
at onset (in model for disease duration), and disease duration
(in model for age at death) were included as covariates. In the
final mixed effects Cox proportional hazard regression mod-
els, the covariates only included those with a significant ef-
fect (P ≤ .05) in the initial model.
Unaffected individuals were included in the model for
age at onset and censored at the age of last evaluation.
Affected individuals still alive were included in the model
for disease duration and censored at the age of last evalua-
tion. In the model for age at death only affected individuals
were included.
For the comparative analysis of the difference in age at on-
set between a mother and her offspring and a father and his
offspring, an independent t test was used (normal distribu-
tion of difference in age at onset). When ages at onset were
available for several affected children of 1 parent, the median
age at onset of the children was used. All statistical testing was
2-tailed and the level of significance was set at P < .05.
Results
Descriptive
From the 36 families, age at onset was available for 111
affected individuals, disease duration was available for 87
deceased affected individuals, and age at death was available
for 124 affected individuals. Frontotemporal dementia (for
patients with age at onset available, 33 [29.7%]; for those
with disease duration available, 24 [27.6%]; for those with
age at death available, 26 [21.0%]) and ALS (for patients with
age at onset available, 36 [32.4%]; for those with disease
duration available, 29 [33.3%]; for those with age at death
available, 44 [35.5%]) were the most frequent diagnoses, but
other diagnoses such as Alzheimer disease dementia and Par-
kinson disease (PD) were present (Table 1). For this study, the
diagnoses were grouped into 3 phenotypes: pure dementia,
ALS, and combined FTD-ALS. The first group included
patients with an FTD diagnosis as well as those with a diag-
nosis of unspecified dementia, Alzheimer disease dementia,
and PD with dementia. Of the 36 families, 21 had available
age data in 2 generations, 13 in 3 generations and 2 in 4 gen-
erations (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Age at Onset
Individuals in later-born generations were more likely to de-
velop disease at an earlier age, with a risk estimate (SE) of 1.98
(0.20) (P < .001 for trend) (Table 2), resulting in a decreasing
mean (SD) age at onset in successive generations (generation
4, 62.5 [8.3] years; generation 3, 57.1 [8.2] years; generation 2,
54.6 [10.2] years; and generation 1, 49.3 [7.5] years) (Table 1
and Figure). When the analysis was restricted only to indi-
viduals identified as carrying the expansion, age at onset still
decreased significantly across successive generations, with a
risk estimate (SE) of 1.66 (0.21) (P = .01) (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). In the analysis restricted only to individuals identi-
fied as carrying the expansion, sex was significantly associ-
ated with age at onset, with a risk estimate (SE) of 0.44 (0.28)
(P = .003), with an earlier age at onset in males.
To investigate the influence of the sex of the transmitting
parent on the occurrence of disease anticipation, we com-
pared the mean (SD) difference in age at onset between an af-
fectedmotherandheraffectedoffspring(n = 14;4.8[9.4]years)
with the mean (SD) difference in age at onset between an
affectedfatherandhisaffectedoffspring(n = 17;9.9[7.5]years);
no significant difference was found (P = .11). When only trans-
missions were taken into account with an identified C9orf72
expansion in both the parent and the child, there was also no
significant difference between the mean (SD) difference in age
at onset between an affected mother and her affected off-
spring (n = 6; 5.4 [10.2] years) and the mean (SD) difference
in age at onset between an affected father and his affected off-
spring (n = 11; 10.0 [7.7] years) (P = .32).
Disease Duration
Disease duration was not significantly different between
generations(riskestimate[SE],1.03[0.19];P = .87).Shorterdis-
ease durations were correlated with later ages at onset (risk

was present between phenotype and disease duration (risk es-
timate [SE], 3.37 [0.19]; P < .001): patients with pure demen-
tia had a significantly longer disease duration than did pa-
tients with ALS, with or without FTD. Similar results were

notype: risk estimate [SE], 2.48 [0.20]; P < .001).
Age at Death
Age at death was not significantly different between genera-
tions (risk estimate [SE], 1.01 [0.15]; P = .92). There was a sig-
nificant association with phenotype (risk estimate [SE], 1.89

Discussion
In accordance with other diseases associated with repeat
expansions, one might expect that the onset of C9orf72-
associated disease is linked with repeat length and that genetic
anticipation occurs when the repeat expansion is transmitted
to the next generation. Although other reports could not reveal

an association between repeat length and age at onset,8,20-28 a
recent study has demonstrated an inverse correlation between
short repeat expansions and later ages at onset, owing to an as-
saythatallowedtheprecisemeasurementofrepeatsizesshorter
than 80 repeat units (ie, short expansions).5 However, few in-
dividuals who carried short expansions were identified in our
cohort; therefore, a thorough study of disease anticipation in
parent-offspringpairsinwhichtheparentcarriedashortexpan-
sion and the offspring carried a long expansion (>80 units) was
not possible and did not allow firm conclusions to be drawn re-
garding the occurrence of genetic anticipation in families car-
ryingtheC9orf72repeatexpansion(eTable3intheSupplement).
Therefore,weaimedtoprovideclinicalevidencetosupportthe
hypothesisofdiseaseanticipation.Inaccordancewithotherdis-
eases associated with repeat expansions, we clinically expect
ages at onset to become earlier and disease to become more se-
vereinsuccessivegenerationsasaresultofgeneticanticipation
(ie, repeat amplification).
We estimated the generational effect on age at onset,
disease duration, and age at death in 36 extended pedigrees
using a mixed effects Cox proportional hazards regression
model. This is a more powerful approach compared with
affected parent-child pairs since unaffected individuals are
also included in this analysis, which avoids right-truncation
bias29,30 resulting from excluding individuals who might
develop disease after the study is concluded. In accordance
with the expectations of genetic anticipation, we observed a
significant decrease in age at onset over successive genera-
tions. Similar to results of a published study,31 we could not
determine a significant effect of parental sex since the differ-
ence in age at onset between father and offspring and
between mother and offspring was not significantly differ-
ent. However, the number of affected parent-offspring pairs
with available ages at onset was too small to draw any firm
conclusions.
To study the hypothesis of more severe disease in succes-
sive generations, we analyzed the generational effect on dis-
ease duration. A correlation between disease duration and re-
peatlengthwasreportedinthecerebellumbutnotinthefrontal
lobes.23 Our results of a lack of association between disease du-
ration and generation could imply that cerebellar repeat length
does not increase in successive generations, while frontal re-
peat length might or might not repeat.
Another marker of disease severity can be the incidence
of ALS, which might be considered a more severe phenotype
than FTD. Some authors have suggested that patients with
ALS carry a larger number of repeat units than do patients
with FTD.32,33 If genetic anticipation occurs, it could result in
an increasing proportion of patients with ALS in successive
generations. However, for several reasons, we were not able
to reliably test this hypothesis. It is likely that the presence
of ALS was not always recognized in the oldest generations
since clinical consultations by a neurologist were less fre-
quent and, in contrast to symptoms of dementia, signs of
motor neuron disease were not likely recognized by laymen.
The first description of ALS by Charcot dates from 1869,34
but only gained attention in 1939 when Lou Gehrig was diag-
nosed with ALS. Another concern is the heterogeneity in
clinical diagnoses2,35-41: apart from diagnoses of FTD and/or
ALS, patients in our cohort received diagnoses of Alzheimer
disease dementia, PD, PD plus dementia, and unspecified
dementia. For our analyses, we categorized all patients with
a dementia diagnosis without ALS together in 1 group. The
motivation to do so was not only statistical power, but also
because many of these patients might actually have FTD.
Fifty-one affected individuals had a diagnosis of Alzheimer
disease dementia, PD plus dementia, or unspecified demen-
tia; however, the diagnosis was based on the clinical record
in only 13 patients. Consequently, many patients lacked
diagnostic workup by a neurologist, which is particularly rel-
evant since previous reports have shown that Alzheimer dis-
ease dementia or PD are likely clinical misdiagnoses since
C9orf72 repeat expansions are very rarely found in patho-
logically confirmed Alzheimer disease or PD.39,41
Whether an individual carrying the C9orf72 repeat expan-
sion develops FTD, ALS, or both might be influenced by sev-
eral factors other than repeat length. Chiò et al31 argued for an
association between the phenotype of the parent and the phe-
notype of the child. We confirmed this finding in our data

Asfordiseaseduration,wecouldnotdetectasignificantdif-
ference of age at death between generations. The rationale to
study age at death was that age at death could be a more objec-
tive marker than age at onset, since it cannot be influenced by
recall bias. However, age at onset is directly determined by
C9orf72-associateddisease,whileageatdeath,especiallyinpa-
tients with dementia, is generally instigated by other comor-
bidities.Weincludedlifeexpectancyasacovariateintheanaly-
sisofageatdeathtocorrectforsurveillancethatbettertreatment
of comorbidities results in later age at death in successive gen-
erations. If genetic anticipation does occur in C9orf72-
associated disease, our results indicate that the C9orf72 repeat
expansion length would not determine age at death, as previ-
ously reported.33 This is in contrast to Huntington disease, in
which a significant association of the HTT (OMIM 613004) CAG
expansion with age at death was recently found.42
A complication in the study of the clinical consequences of
disease anticipation is that not only repeat expansion size but
also several other factors might be influencing clinical charac-
teristicsofC9orf72-associateddisease.Chiòetal31suggestedthat
the clinical phenotype influences age at onset since they ob-
served that the co-occurrence of FTD increases age at onset in
patientswithALS.Inourstudy,wecouldnotdemonstrateasig-
nificant association between age at onset and clinical pheno-
type, but age at death was significantly earlier in patients with
ALS than in those with pure dementia. Consequently, disease
duration was significantly shorter in patients with ALS with or
without FTD. Another factor that could act as a modifier is sex.
WecouldnotentirelyconfirmtheobservationofWilliamsetal43
that males were significantly more likely to develop C9orf72-
associatedALSatayoungerage:weonlyobservedanearlieron-
set of C9orf72-associated disease in males in the analysis
restricted only to individuals identified as carrying the expan-
sion. Additional studies of a potential effect of sex on age at on-
set are necessary.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. First, we had to rely on
information about age at onset obtained from relatives in 49
of 111 patients (44.1%), mostly from older generations,
increasing the risk for recall bias. However, source of infor-
mation about age at onset was not significantly associated
with age at onset. Moreover, Minikel et al44 stated that the
inclusion of data on individuals ascertained retrospectively
through family history can reduce or even eliminate a false
signal of disease anticipation. A second limitation is that we
were unable to prove experimentally the carrier status in 31
of 111 patients (27.9%) with age at onset data, and thus we
could not exclude the potential inclusion of phenocopies in
the families or sporadic patients with late-onset Alzheimer
disease dementia. A third factor that could distort our find-
ings is that relatives in the later-born generations might rec-
ognize the disease earlier because they are more familiar
with the symptoms. Unfortunately, statistical methods to
fully resolve this issue are lacking. In an attempt to decrease
this factor of bias, we performed an additional analysis
including only ages at onset that were determined by a phy-
sician, which still resulted in a significant generational effect
on age at onset (risk estimate [SE], 3.66 [0.30]; P < .001)
(eTable 5 in the Supplement). Finally, recall bias and societal
generational aspects can lead to an overestimation of the
anticipation in age at onset. However, an effort was made to
account for as many as possible (known) factors of bias in
this study and we believe we have provided a valuable study
adding arguments for the occurrence of disease anticipation
in C9orf72-associated disease. Nevertheless, additional clini-
cal and molecular studies are necessary to confirm our find-
ings and provide additional evidence.
Conclusions
We provided clinical data supporting the occurrence of dis-
easeanticipationinfamiliescarryingtheC9orf72repeatexpan-
sion by means of an earlier age at onset in successive genera-
tions. Our results suggest that, in contrast with other diseases
associated with repeat expansion, disease anticipation results
in earlier ages at onset but not in more severe phenotypes. Our
findingmayhelpcliniciansdecidefromwhichageonwarditmay
be relevant to clinically follow up presymptomatic individuals
who carry the C9orf72 repeat expansion.
