Abstract
Exposures to carcinogens in hair products have been explored as breast cancer risk factors, yielding equivocal findings. 
We examined hair product use (hair dyes, chemical relaxers and cholesterol or placenta-containing conditioners) among 
African American (AA) and White women, and explored associations with breast cancer. Multivariable-adjusted models 
were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to describe the associations of interest among 
2280 cases (1508 AA and 772 White) and 2005 controls (1290 AA and 715 White). Among controls, hair dye use was more 
common among Whites than AAs (58 versus 30%), while relaxer (88 versus 5%) and deep conditioner use (59 versus 6%) 
was more common among AAs. Among AAs, use of dark hair dye shades was associated with increased breast cancer risk 
(OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.20–1.90) and use of dark shades (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.30–2.26) and higher frequency of use (OR = 1.36, 
95% CI: 1.01–1.84) were associated with ER+ disease. Among Whites, relaxer use (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.11–2.74) and dual 
use of relaxers and hair dyes (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.35–4.27) was associated with breast cancer; use of dark hair dyes was 
associated with increased ER+ disease (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.01–2.33), and relaxer use was associated with increased ER– 
disease (OR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.06–6.16). These novel findings provide support a relationship between the use of some hair 
products and breast cancer. Further examinations of hair products as important exposures contributing to breast cancer 
carcinogenesis are necessary.
Introduction
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the 
second leading cause of cancer death among women in the 
United States (1). Historically, African American (AA) women 
were shown to have lower breast cancer incidence rates com-
pared to White women, but recent data show a convergence 
of these rates, although AA women continue to have higher 
breast cancer incidence at younger ages and higher rates of 
breast cancer mortality (1,2). While there has been much inquiry 
into risk factors for breast cancer and how differences among 
women may contribute to observed disparities, few studies have 
explored the contribution of hair product use among AA women.
Data from some animal models (3–5) suggest that exposures 
to compounds found in some hair products, particularly those 
exhibiting endocrine disrupting behaviors and potential muta-
gens, may be etiologic risk factors for several human cancers. 
However, much of the epidemiologic data have been equivocal

(6–22) and came from studies conducted predominantly in White 
women (6,7,9,11–14,18–21). Only one study to date (23) has exam-
ined the association between chemical relaxer/straightener use 
and breast cancer among AA women, finding no association 
between relaxer use and breast cancer risk. Although relaxer 
use is not as common among Whites as AAs (24–26), examina-
tion of associations between relaxer use and breast cancer in 
this group is needed. A recent review paper (25) concluded that 
there is evidence to support a role of hair product use in risk of 
early onset breast cancer particularly in AA women. This review 
also highlighted critical periods of exposure including in utero, 
during puberty and during pregnancy, which have a potential to 
result in alterations of mammary gland development that may 
be associated with increased risk of breast cancer.
The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence 
and patterns of use of hair products, specifically hair dye, chem-
ical relaxers and deep conditioning creams containing cho-
lesterol or placenta and their associations with breast cancer 
risk and whether the risks vary by estrogen receptor (ER) status 
among AA and White women in the Women’s Circle of Health 
Study (WCHS).
Materials and methods
Study participants
As previously described (27–31), the WCHS is a case–control study con-
ducted in metropolitan New York City (NYC) and ten counties in New 
Jersey (NJ). Breast cancer cases with histologically confirmed ductal car-
cinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer (stages I–IV), who self-identified 
as either Black/African American or White/European American, were age 
20–75 years, able to complete an interview in English, and had no history 
of cancer except non-melanoma skin cancer, were eligible to participate. 
Eligibility for controls included no history of cancer except non-mela-
noma skin cancer and the same age and English language criteria as 
breast cancer cases. Recruitment in NYC was conducted between January 
2002 and December 2008. Case identification was done through the hos-
pitals within the five boroughs with the largest referrals for AA women. 
Frequency-matched controls (matched on age and race) were recruited 
through random digit dialing, with sampling based on the same telephone 
exchanges as cases receiving breast cancer care at participating hospi-
tals. Recruitment in NJ began in March 2006 and is ongoing. Breast cancer 
cases residing in ten NJ counties were identified through rapid case ascer-
tainment by the NJ State Cancer Registry. In NJ, a combination of random 
digit dialing and community-based recruitment (facilitated by AA breast 
cancer advocacy groups and cancer support organizations, AA churches 
and community centers) was used to identify frequency-matched con-
trols (matched to cases by age and county of residence). A more detailed 
description of the community-based control recruitment process is avail-
able elsewhere (32). For the present analysis, we included cases and con-
trols recruited through 2014. A total of 2280 cases (1508 AA and 772 White) 
and 2005 controls (1290 AA and 715 White) completed the baseline inter-
view and were included in the present analysis.
Data collection
Data collection for the WCHS was conducted through in-person inter-
views and anthropometric and body composition measurements. The 
baseline study questionnaire ascertained information on sociodemo-
graphics and established and probable breast cancer risk factors, includ-
ing: family and personal health history, prenatal exposures, reproductive 
history and hormone use and lifestyle exposures (e.g. hair product use, 
tobacco smoke exposure, alcohol consumption, physical activity, vita-
min use). Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip 
circumference measures) and body composition measures (lean and fat 
mass, percent body fat) were also taken at the in-person, baseline inter-
view using standardized protocols and instruments (33). For breast can-
cer cases, tumor pathology and hormone receptor data were collected 
through medical and pathology records obtained from hospitals where 
breast cancer care was received.
In terms of hair product use, the baseline interview queried on par-
ticipants’ use of hair dyes, chemical relaxers/straighteners and choles-
terol- or placenta-containing deep conditioning creams. Regular hair 
dye use was defined as ‘having ever used permanent hair dye for at least 
1 year at a rate of ≥2 times per year’. Data collected on patterns of hair dye 
use included the age women started regularly using hair dye, the typi-
cal annual frequency of use, the typical shade used, typical application 
used (home-kit or salon), total duration (years) of use and frequency of 
use. Regular use of chemical relaxers/straighteners (referred to as ‘relax-
ers’ hereafter) was defined as ‘having ever chemically relaxed or straight-
ened hair for at least 1 year’. Data collected on patterns of use of relaxers 
included use of lye or no-lye relaxers, typical application used, total dura-
tion (years) of use and frequency of use. We also collected patterns of use 
of relaxers at various ages (≤12, 13–19 and ≥20 years). Regular use of cho-
lesterol- or placenta-containing conditioning creams (referred to as ‘deep 
conditioners’ hereafter) was defined as ‘having ever used deep condition-
ing hair creams that contain cholesterol or placenta for at least 1 year’. 
Data collected on patterns of use of deep conditioners included patterns 
of use at different ages and frequency of use.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all 
participating institutions and all study participants provided written 
informed consent prior to the interview.
Statistical analysis
Hair product use and patterns of use (stratified by race) were described 
using frequencies and proportions. Chi-square tests were used to compare 
differences in hair product variables by case–control status among AA and 
White women. To address concerns of multiple comparisons, Bonferroni 
correction was used. Race-stratified, age-adjusted and multivariable-
adjusted unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate 
odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to describe the asso-
ciations between hair product use including patterns of use and breast 
cancer risk among AA and White women. We used a backward selection 
process to identify a parsimonious multivariable model, whereby poten-
tial confounders were selected a priori and omitted based on the P value 
(P >0.10 criterion). We started with established and suspected breast can-
cer risk factors [age, education, body mass index (BMI), family history of 
breast cancer, age at menarche, parity, oral contraceptive use and hormone 
replacement therapy use]; the final multivariable model included the fol-
lowing covariates: age, education, BMI, family history of breast cancer and 
oral contraceptive use. We also explored the multivariable adjusted asso-
ciations between hair product use including patterns of use and risk of 
breast cancer by ER (ER–, ER+) and triple-negative (TN) status. All reported 
P values are two-sided and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Analyses were performed using SAS (v9.3 SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Race-stratified distributions of sociodemographic, clinical and 
reproductive characteristics, as well as hair product use and 
patterns of use among WCHS participants are shown in Table 1. 
As previously reported (28–31), Whites reported higher levels of 
education, fewer children and lower BMI. Additionally, White 
women were more likely than AA women to have ever used 
postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. Cases were 
more likely than controls to be older, have a family history and 
be less educated. In terms of hair product use, among controls, 
~30% of AAs and 58% of Whites reported regular use of hair dyes; 
88% of AAs and 5% of Whites reported regular use of relaxers; 
and 59% of AAs and 6% of Whites reported regular use of deep

conditioners. Among controls who reported regular hair dye use, 
~27% of AAs and 3% of Whites reported regular use of relaxers 
as well. Among AAs, a higher proportion of cases reported use of 
dark hair dye shades (P = 0.0006) than controls. Among Whites, 
there were no differences in the prevalence of hair dye use or 
patterns of use. In terms of relaxer use, among AAs, a higher 
proportion of cases than controls reported use of lye-containing 
relaxers (P = 0.0008). After Bonferroni correction, the observed 
differences in use of dark hair dye shades and type of chemical 
relaxer used among AA cases and controls remained statistically 
significant. Among Whites, cases were more likely than controls 
to report relaxer use (P = 0.02), longer duration of use (P = 0.005), 
use of lye relaxers (P = 0.04), higher frequency of relaxer use at 
age ≥20years (P = 0.001), use of home-kits for relaxer application 
(P = 0.01) and dual use of relaxers and hair dyes (P = 0.003). No 
differences were observed for use of deep conditioners among 
AAs or Whites. After Bonferroni correction, the observed dif-
ferences in frequency of relaxer use at age ≥20 years and dual 
use of relaxers and hair dyes among White cases and controls 
remained statistically significant.
Associations between hair product use and breast cancer risk 
by race are shown in Table 2. Among AA women, there was no 
association between regular hair dye use and breast cancer risk 
(OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.95–1.32). Compared to non-users, breast cancer 
risk was higher among AA women who reported use of dark hair 
dyes (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.20–1.90) and salon application of dyes 
(OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.00–1.58). Among White women, there were no 
associations between hair dye use and patterns of use and breast 
cancer risk. Among AA women, compared to non-use, regular use 
of relaxers was not significantly associated with breast cancer 
risk (OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.79–1.26). Among White women, although 
prevalence of relaxer use was very low (compared to AAs), those 
reporting use of relaxers (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.11–2.74), use of home-
kits for application of relaxers (OR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.46–4.95) and 
dual use of relaxers and hair dyes (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.35–4.27) had 
increased breast cancer risk compared to non-users.

Associations between hair product use and breast can-
cer risk by ER and TN status are shown in Table 3 (AAs) and 
Table 4 (Whites). Among AAs, there was a significant association 
between higher frequency of hair dye use (more than twice per 
year, OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.01–1.84), use of dark hair dye shades 
(OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.30–2.26) and salon application of hair dyes 
(OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.03–1.82) and risk of ER+ breast cancer. It 
is worth noting that while no significant association between 
relaxer use and overall breast cancer risk or risk of ER+ dis-
ease was observed, findings were suggestive of an association 
between use of lye relaxers and increased risk of ER– disease 
among both AAs (ER–, OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.93–2.53) and Whites 
(ER–, OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.93–2.53), and TN disease among AAs 
(OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 0.94–2.59), although these findings need to be 
further explored in larger samples. Unexpectedly, compared to 
non-use, the use of no-lye relaxers (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50–0.91), 
salon application of relaxers (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.48–0.99) and 
longer duration of deep conditioners (>10 years versus non-
use, OR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.62–0.96) was associated with decreased 
risk of ER+ breast cancer among AAs. We observed no signifi-
cant associations between hair product use and risk of ER– or 
TN breast cancers among AAs. Among Whites, there was an 
increased risk of ER+ breast cancer among women reporting 
dual use of relaxers and hair dyes (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.29–5.12) 
and increased risk of ER– breast cancer among women with a 
history of relaxer use (OR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.06–6.16) compared to 
non-users. Additionally, compared to non-users, White women 
reporting use of no-lye relaxers (OR = 5.88, 95% CI: 1.16–29.96) 
were at increased risk of TN breast cancer compared to non-
users. Given the small sample size of Whites reporting use of the 
hair products of interest, these findings should be interpreted 
with caution.
Discussion
In this large case–control study of breast cancer, we found that 
use of dark hair dye shades was associated with 51% increased 
overall risk and 72% increased risk of ER+ disease among AAs. 
We also found that salon application of hair dyes was associated 
with 26% increased breast cancer risk and 37% increased risk 
of ER+ disease among AA women. Among Whites, use of relax-
ers was associated with 74% increased risk of breast cancer and 
with more than 2-fold increased risk of ER– disease. Dual use of 
relaxers and hair dyes, as well as home-kit application of relax-
ers, was also associated with more than 2-fold increased risk 
among Whites. Although relaxer use was less frequent among 
Whites, we observed significant increases in risk associated 
with use of these hair products in this group, which has never 
been reported previously. While novel, these findings must be 
interpreted with caution given the small sample size of Whites 
with these exposures.
Over the last several decades, the concern of environmental 
exposures to carcinogens and mutagens found in hair dyes, par-
ticularly aromatic amines which were shown to be components 
of oxidative hair dyes (34), have been explored for evidence 
of an association with breast cancer risk (6,7,9,11–14,18–21). 
Furthermore, evidence of 4-aminobiphenyl (ABP) DNA adducts 
in breast epithelial cells (and an observed association between 
hair dye use and these adducts) (35,36) and the presence of ABP 
in commercial hair dye (37) support a link between exposure to 
aromatic amines, via hair dye use and increased breast cancer 
risk. However, to date there appears to be only fairly weak evi-
dence (6,7,9,11–14,18–21) to support a significant association 
between hair dye use and breast cancer risk. One recent study 
(7), reported an increase in the odds of breast cancer (23%) 
among women who ever used hair dyes. Findings from our 
study showed that while ever use of hair dyes was not signifi-
cantly associated with increased breast cancer risk among AAs 
or Whites overall, higher annual frequency of hair dye use and 
use of dark hair dye shades were associated with increased risk 
among AA women, and with increased risk of ER+ breast can-
cer in both groups. It should be noted that our study included 
a larger sample size than nine of the eleven previous breast 
cancer studies (6,9,11–13,18–21) and with the largest number, 
to date, of AA women, an understudied population in the con-
text of hair dye use and breast cancer risk. Our observation of 
differences in the association between dark hair dye use and 
breast cancer risk by race could relate to variable patterns of 
use of dark hair dyes (e.g. timing of use, duration of use and 
varying preferences for darker shades of dyes) between AA and 
White women. For instance, although AA women reported sub-
stantially lower frequency of hair dye use than white women, 
AA women reported more frequent use of dark shades of hair 
dye. This could reflect differences in preferences for darker hair 
dye shades possibly for the purposes of covering greying hair 
among White women (which may also relate to initiation of dark 
hair dye use at older ages than among AA women), whereas AA 
women may use darker shades of dye to merely darken their 
already darker hair color (or for myriad reasons other than dying 
grey hair). Furthermore, the level of darkness of dark hair dye 
shades may differ among commercial products depending on 
desired use (e.g. for dying grey hair versus further darkening 
naturally darker hair), thereby requiring a different chemical 
composition. A related hypothesis is that the chemical compo-
sition of hair dyes in general, and darker shades of dye in par-
ticular, marketed for and used among Whites may differ from 
those used by AAs, which could explain higher breast cancer 
risk observed among AAs than Whites although they reported 
lower annual frequency as well as shorter lifetime duration of 
of hair dye use. Because this study collected no information on 
specific brands and ingredients of hair dyes, or differences in 
composition among retail products, future research is needed to 
describe associated risks more completely.
Although no other studies have found the use of dark hair 
dye shades to be associated with breast cancer, long-term use 
of dark hair dyes have been associated with 4-fold increased 
risks of fatal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma 
among women enrolled in the Cancer Prevention Study II (10) 
and marginally associated with a 29% increased risk of bladder 
cancer in a recent meta-analysis (38). One hypothesis to explain 
these associations is that dark shades of commercial oxidative 
hair dyes pose a higher risk of cancer due to increased con-
tamination of these dyes with potentially genotoxic compounds 
(37,39–41). Furthermore, direct scalp contact of these dyes can 
lead to cutaneous absorption of these harmful compounds 
(39,42), particularly with long-term exposure. The finding of a 
significant association between dark hair dyes and ER+ breast 
cancer among both AAs and Whites and the lack of an asso-
ciation between these dyes and ER– and TN disease warrants 
further study to understand hormone related mechanisms. It is 
also possible that use of dark shades of dye may also be associ-
ated with ER– and TN disease, although given the smaller sam-
ple size for these subgroups we were underpowered to detect 
significant associations.
History of relaxer use overall was not associated with breast 
cancer risk among AAs in this study, similar to findings from the 
Black Women’s Health Study (23). We are the first to report a sig-
nificant association between relaxer use and breast cancer risk

among White women. Although the risk estimates by ER and TN 
status were not statistically significant, our findings were sug-
gestive of increased risk of ER– and TN disease among AAs and 
increased risk of ER– disease among Whites in association with 
use of lye relaxers. AA women, especially younger women, com-
monly use relaxers for hair straightening, often for many years 
(23,26,43,44). In our analysis, we were particularly interested in 
the potential association between the use of lye-based relaxers 
and breast cancer, given that lye relaxers are thought to be more 
harmful than no-lye formulations, containing sodium hydrox-
ide (45). Although newer chemical straightening products with 
varying active ingredients have become popular, such as low-
lye relaxers which contain <2.5% sodium hydroxide, Brazilian-
style keratin treatments which contain formaldehyde, and thio 
relaxers which contain thioglycolic acid salts, lye-based and no-
lye relaxers have historically been among the most commonly 
used products among AA women (43,44). The current findings 
provide novel data to support the hypothesis that exposure 
to lye (and esposure to other potentially harmful compounds 
found in relaxers and other hair products) could be important 
environmental risk exposures associated with carcinogenesis 
of the mammary gland. This is an important and understudied 
risk factor, particularly among AA women, as the prevalence 
of use of relaxers and other potentially harmful hair and cos-
metic products is higher among AAs than Whites (24–26), which 
our findings and those of the BWHS (23) support. However, this 
may be an equally important exposure among White women as 
well, as our findings suggest harmful effects of these products

product patterns of use variables are shown in this table.

irrespective of race. One hypothesis to support this finding is 
that the chemical composition of chemical relaxers marketed 
for and used among Whites may differ from that of AA relaxers. 
Because this study collected no information on specific brands 
and ingredients of relaxers, or differences in composition 
among retail products marketed for and used by AA or White 
users, future research is needed to describe risks, in relation to 
these products, more completely.
Some studies (26,43,44,46) have provided empirical evi-
dence to support the association between exposure to the car-
cinogenic and/or endocrine disrupting chemicals contained 
in hair products, and increased risk of precocious puberty 
which is known to be associated with increased breast cancer 
risk and potentially increased risk of breast cancers exhibit-
ing aggressive phenotypes. Given the widespread use of these 
products, which are minimally regulated by the Food and Drug 
Administration (47), it is essential that more research is done 
to understand the ingredients found in hair products and 
other cosmetics and examine the effects of these exposures on 
breast cancer risk.
There were some limitations that should be considered in 
the interpretation of our findings. First, preferential recall bias 
is of particular concern given that this study relied on each 
participant to remember and accurately report on their use of 
hair products throughout their lifetime. As in any case–con-
trol study, there is always the potential for cases to recall and 
report habits and events differently than women who were not 
recently diagnosed with breast cancer. However, because hair 
product use is not a factor known to cause breast cancer, we 
do not expect a substantial impact on the reported risk esti-
mates. Additionally, our questionnaire did not ascertain use of 
every type of hair product that is available on the market and 
may have yielded unreliable estimates on some of the expo-
sures of interest. Furthermore, we cannot be certain of partici-
pants’ ability to accurately distinguish their use of various hair 
product types (e.g. permanent versus termporary hair dyes, 
dark, medium or light hair dye shades, lye versus no-lye relax-
ers, conditioners that contain placenta or cholesterol versus 
those that do not). As a result, our findings possibly represent 
underestimates of the true associations between hair product 
use and breast cancer risk. Another potential concern is that 
we had limited statistical power to evaluate associations by ER 
and TN status due to small samples of these cases in this study. 
Further analysis of larger studies (with larger numbers of ER– 
and TN cases) are needed to clarify the observed relationships. 
Finally, multiple testing may also be a concern. Given the explo-
ration of several exposures with stratified analysis, we could 
have increased our chances of finding significant associations. 
Despite these considerations, the major strength of this study 
was the large sample of AA women that allowed the first com-
plete evaluation of associations between several hair products 
and breast cancer risk by ER status in this group. The popula-
tion-based study design and extensive collection of detailed 
data on hair product use and patterns of use (more detailed 
than previously published studies), and potential confounding 
factors were also strengths.
In summary, findings from this large case-control study of 
AA and White women provide epidemiological data to sup-
port a relationship between the use of hair dye and some 
types of relaxers and breast cancer. As use of various hair 
products and other cosmetics continue among women in the 
US as well as in other countries, improved awareness of the 
potential effects of exposures to their chemical ingredients 
are needed.
