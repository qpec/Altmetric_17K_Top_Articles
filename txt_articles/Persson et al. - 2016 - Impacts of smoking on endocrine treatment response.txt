Background: The association between smoking and breast cancer prognosis remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to
investigate whether preoperative smoking was associated with prognosis in different treatment groups.
Methods: This population-based cohort consisted of 1065 breast cancer patients without preoperative treatment included
between 2002 and 2012 in Lund, Sweden. Smoking status was examined in relation to patient and tumour characteristics, and
prognosis in different treatment groups.
Results: At the preoperative visit, 21.0% smoked. Median follow-up time was 5.1 years. Overall, in the 1016 patients included in the
survival analyses, there was no significant association between smoking and risk of breast cancer events (adjusted hazard ratio
(adjHR): 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95–2.20). For the 309 aromatase inhibitor (AI)-treated patients X50 years
with oestrogen receptor-positive (ER þ ) tumours, smoking was associated with risk of breast cancer events (adjHR: 2.97; 95%
CI: 1.44–6.13), distant metastasis (adjHR: 4.19; 95% CI: 1.81–9.72), and death (adjHR: 3.52; 95% CI: 1.59–7.81). Smoking was not
associated with breast cancer events or distant metastasis in other treatment groups.
Conclusions: Preoperative smoking was only associated with an increased risk for breast cancer events and distant metastasis in
AI-treated patients. If confirmed, smoking status should be taken into consideration when selecting an endocrine therapy.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women
worldwide (Ferlay et al, 2014). Identification of modifiable lifestyle
factors that may improve prognosis is of interest to women
diagnosed with breast cancer. Several studies have investigated the
association between smoking and prognosis in breast cancer
patients. Smoking is associated with an overall increased mortality.
However, the association between smoking and breast cancer-
specific mortality or disease-free survival remains unclear. Some
studies found no significant association (Holmes et al, 2007;
Berube et al, 2014; Seibold et al, 2014), whereas others found an
increased risk for recurrence or breast cancer-specific mortality
(Manjer et al, 2000; Braithwaite et al, 2012; Bishop et al, 2014;
Pierce et al, 2014; Nechuta et al, 2016; Passarelli et al, 2016).
Moreover, this association was sometimes only reported in current
smokers or in patients with more extensive smoking.
In 2013, B11% of the female population in Sweden smoked
cigarettes daily, and an additional 9% smoked occasionally
(Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkha
¨lsomyndigheten, 2013).
Cigarette smoke contains over 7000 chemicals, 69 of which are
established carcinogens (United States Department of Health and
Human Services, 2010). Smoking has anti-oestrogenic effects and
decreases endogenous oestrogen (Baron, 1984). Constituents of
cigarettes such as nicotine and other tobacco alkaloids inhibited
oestrogen synthesis via the aromatase enzyme when tested in vitro

 (Barbieri et al, 1986; Kadohama et al, 1993). However, current
smoking is also associated with increased levels of urinary
prostaglandin E2 metabolites (Kim et al, 2013). Prostaglandin E2
is synthesised from arachidonic acid via the action of cyclooxygenase
2 and is a key mediator of inflammation (Park et al, 2006) that
increases aromatase activation (Subbaramaiah et al, 2012). The net
effect of smoking on aromatase activity in different women may vary.
Little is known about how smoking influences response to
different types of breast cancer treatments. Smoking has been
reported to impact the response to both radiation and chemother-
apy, primarily in other cancers (An et al, 2012; Hoff et al, 2012;
Trevino et al, 2012; Bishop et al, 2014; Guha et al, 2014). Endocrine
therapy represents one of the most effective treatments for women
with oestrogen receptor-positive (ER þ ) breast cancers. Two
classes of agents are the selective ER modulators, for example,
tamoxifen (TAM) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (Jordan, 2006;
Dowsett et al, 2010). To our knowledge, no study has investigated a
potential association between smoking and response to different
types of endocrine therapy. We hypothesise that smoking may be
associated with the response to endocrine treatment as smoking
affects endogenous oestrogen levels via the aromatase enzyme, and
that any association may differ between TAM and AIs because of
their different mechanisms of action.
The aim of this study was to examine if the prognosis differed
between smokers and non-smokers among patients who had
received different types of breast cancer treatment, with a special
focus on the endocrine treatment response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients of all ages diagnosed with a first breast cancer at the Skåne
University Hospital in Lund, Sweden were included between
October 2002 and June 2012 in an ongoing prospective cohort
study of lifestyle factors and their association with prognosis and
treatment response (n ¼ 1116). There were a total of 2170 female
patients operated for breast cancer during the time period this
cohort was compiled. Only patients with primary breast cancer and
no other cancer during the past 10 years were included in the
cohort. The total number also included patients with a secondary
breast cancer as well as patients who had been diagnosed with
other cancers within the past 10 years. The median age of all
patients was 61 years. Oestrogen receptor status was available for
1928 patients, of whom 85.4% had ER þ tumours. Progesterone
receptor (PgR) status was available for 1914 patients, of whom
70.1% had PgR þ tumours. For the present study, 51 patients
who had received preoperative treatment were excluded, leaving
1065 patients (see Figure 1). The study was approved by the
Lund University Ethics Committee (LU Dnr75-02, Dnr37-08,
Dnr658-09, Dnr58-12, Dnr379-12, Dnr 277-15, Dnr458-15), and
written informed consents were obtained from all participants.
Participating patients completed a three-page questionnaire at the
preoperative visit. Follow-up questionnaires were completed 3–6
months, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 years postoperatively. The
questionnaire included questions regarding medication intake during
the last week, reproductive history, and smoking and alcohol
consumption. The follow-up questionnaires also provided informa-
tion on adjuvant treatment. Anthropometric measures including
height, weight, waist and hip circumferences, and breast volume were
measured with plastic cups by trained research nurses, as described
previously (Ringberg et al, 2006; Markkula et al, 2012a).
The patients were asked to define themselves as non-smokers,
smokers, or occasional smokers. The approximate number of
cigarettes consumed during the last week was obtained as an interval
(0, 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, 20þ ). Patients who considered
themselves as either smokers or occasional smokers or who had
reported to have smoked 40 cigarettes were defined as ‘smokers’.
Tumours were analysed at the Department of Pathology at the
Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Information on tumour
size, axillary lymph node involvement, histological grade, and ER
and PgR status (positive if 410% nuclei were stained according to
standard clinical practice in Sweden) was obtained from each
patient’s pathology report, as described previously (Bågeman et al,
2008; Jernstro
¨m et al, 2009; Simonsson et al, 2014). The human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status was routinely
analysed as of November 2005 in patients younger than 70 years of
age with invasive tumours, as described previously (Markkula et al,
2014), and is thus missing for a substantial part of the tumours.
Analyses of Ki-67 index were routinely performed as of March
2009 and are therefore not included.
Information regarding breast cancer events – defined as either
local or regional recurrence, new breast cancer, or distant
metastases – and date of death owing to any cause was collected
from the patients’ charts, pathology reports, regional tumour registry,
and population registry. Information regarding treatment was
obtained from the patients’ charts as well as from the questionnaires.
Only treatment before any breast cancer event was considered. The
study was observational, and treatment was provided according to
the standard of care at the Skåne University Hospital.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using
IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.0
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Patient and tumour character-
istics were analysed in relation to smoking status at the
preoperative visit. Total breast volume for both breasts was
calculated for those with no previous breast surgery (Ringberg et al,
2006; Markkula et al, 2012a). Tumour characteristics included
invasive tumour size (p20 mm, 21–50 mm, X51 mm, muscle or
skin involvement or X21 mm, or muscle or skin involvement
(yes/no)), pathological axillary lymph node involvement (0, 1–3,
4 þ , or axillary lymph node involvement (yes/no)), histological
grade (I–III or grade III (yes/no)), hormone receptor status (ER þ ,
PgR þ ), and HER2 status (amplified/not amplified). For analysis
of categorical variables in relation to smoking status, Pearson’s
w2 test was used. If the expected number of patients in one or more
categories was o5, Fisher’s exact test was used. Continuous
variables were analysed using the Mann–Whitney U-test for the
univariable analyses. Variables that were not normally distributed
were categorised for the multivariable analyses.
Response to given treatments, measured as risk of breast cancer
events, was analysed in relation to preoperative smoking status. For
these analysis, patients with carcinoma in situ (n ¼ 39), metastatic
spread within 0.3 years from inclusion (n ¼ 8), or missing
preoperative smoking status (n ¼ 2) were excluded. The follow-
up time was calculated as the time from inclusion until a first
breast cancer event, death from a non-breast cancer-related cause,
or last follow-up for patients who were alive and event-free before
1 July 2014. Patients were censored at the time of a non-breast
cancer-related death or last follow-up. Similarly, follow-up time
until distant metastasis was calculated as the time from inclusion
until a first distant metastasis, death from a non-breast cancer-
related cause, or last follow-up for patients who were alive and
distant metastasis-free before 1 July 2014. Time to death owing to
any cause was calculated as the time from inclusion until death or
last follow-up before 1 July 2014. For the 1016 patients included in
these analyses, there were 122 breast cancer events, out of which 76
were distant metastases. A total of 97 patients had died during
follow-up, and 39 of these had no reported breast cancer event.
To evaluate if preoperative smoking status was representative,
changes in smoking status during the first postoperative year were
assessed using the reported smoking status at the preoperative visit
and follow-up visits after 3–6 months and 1 year. Missing data
were handled according to the last observation carried forward
method. In the case of missing data, the reported smoking status

 from the previous visit was carried forward if the total follow-up
time was longer than 0.5 years for the visit after 3–6 months
(n ¼ 61) and 1.0 year for the visit after 1 year (n ¼ 34). Therefore, if
patients had died from non-breast cancer-related causes before 0.5
years postoperatively (n ¼ 1) or 1 year postoperatively (n ¼ 1), they
were not included in the analyses of these visits. Also, patients who
were alive and event-free but had a follow-up shorter than 0.5 years
or 1 year because they had not been to the visit at 3–6 months
(n ¼ 12) or 1 year postoperatively (n ¼ 27) were not included in the
analysis of smoking status at the respective visit. If a breast cancer
event occurred before a visit, no last observation carried forward or
data collected at this visit were included in the analysis for the visit
3–6 months postoperatively (n ¼ 2) and for the visit 1 year
postoperatively (n ¼ 11). One patient had an event on the day of
her visit. The data from this visit was included.
To calculate risk of breast cancer events, distant metastases, or
death, Kaplan–Meier estimates were used. Cox’s regressions were
used to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (adjHRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). Adjustments were made for invasive
tumour size X21 mm or muscle or skin involvement (yes/no),
axillary lymph node involvement (yes/no), histological grade III
(yes/no), positive ER status (yes/no), age (continuous), and body
mass index (BMI) X25 kg m � 2 (yes/no). Further adjustments for
treatment factors included ever treatment with radiation therapy
(yes/no), chemotherapy (yes/no), TAM (yes/no), and AIs (yes/no).
The questionnaire included questions regarding menopausal
status. Owing to risk of misclassification of menopausal status for
hormonal therapy users and patients with previous gynaecological
surgeries, age X50 years was used as a proxy variable for
postmenopausal status.
A P-value o0.05 was considered statistically significant, and all
P-values were two-sided. Nominal P-values are presented without
adjustment for multiple testing.

 of the preoperative visit (Table 1). The smokers were in general
younger, had a lower body weight, BMI, and preoperative total
breast volume. Moreover, the smokers had fewer children, were
significantly younger at their first full-term pregnancy, and
were more likely to have used oral contraceptives. Tumour
characteristics were similar between smokers and non-smokers
except for hormone receptor status. Smokers had more often
hormone receptor-negative tumours compared with non-smokers
(Table 2).
Reported smoking status over time. Risk of breast cancer events
in relation to smoking status was analysed in the 1016 patients with
invasive tumours and no distant metastases were detected on
postoperative metastases screen within 0.3 years of surgery. Of
these, 206 were considered smokers and 810 were not considered
smokers at the time of the preoperative visit (Figure 1). Figure 2
shows how the smoking habits of these patients changed during the
first postoperative year. Less than 1% of the 810 preoperative
non-smokers reported smoking at either the 3–6 months or
1-year postoperative visit, whereas about 10% of the patients
who smoked preoperatively reported not to smoke during the
follow-up visits. Thus, the majority of the patients did not switch
smoking status.
Smoking and the risk of breast cancer events and death in
different treatment groups. Patients were followed for up to 11
years, and the median follow-up time was 5.1 years (interquartile
range (IQR): 3.0–7.2) for the 855 patients who were still alive and
at risk of breast cancer events. Overall, there was no significant
association between smoking at the preoperative visit and risk
of breast cancer events (log rank, P ¼ 0.14; adjHR: 1.45; 95% CI:
0.95–2.20)
adjusted
for
patient
and
tumour
characteristics
(Figure 3A). In all patients, smoking was associated with a two-
fold increased risk for death owing to any cause (log rank,
P ¼ 0.037; adjHR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.29–3.21). No association
was observed between smoking and risk of breast cancer events
among the 257 chemotherapy-treated patients (log rank, P ¼ 0.69)
(Figure 3B). Among the 639 radiotherapy-treated patients, there
was a tendency towards an increased risk of a breast cancer event
among smokers (log rank, P ¼ 0.08; adjHR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.02–
2.88) (Figure 3C).
Survival analysis in relation to endocrine treatment was
restricted to the 891 patients with ER þ tumours. Among the
patients younger than 50 years (n ¼ 168), there was no significant
association between smoking and prognosis neither among the 120
patients who had ever received TAM nor among the 35 patients
who had ever received AIs (all log rank Ps X0.21).
For the 309 AI-treated patients X50 years, smoking was
significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer
events (log rank, P ¼ 0.005; adjHR: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.44–6.13)
(Figure 4A), distant metastasis (log rank, P ¼ 0.002; adjHR: 4.19;
95% CI: 1.81–9.72) (Figure 4B), and death (log rank, P ¼ 0.003;
adjHR: 3.52; 95% CI: 1.59–7.81) (Figure 4C). The absolute risk for
breast cancer events was 17.5/1000 person-years among non-
smokers and 48.2/1000 person-years for smokers. For the 408
TAM-treated patients X50 years, smoking was not significantly
associated with risk for breast cancer events (log rank, P ¼ 0.39)
(Figure 4D). Among TAM-treated patients never treated with AIs,
there was no association between preoperative smoking status and
risk for breast cancer events (log rank, P ¼ 0.51).
Further adjustments for other types of treatment modalities
than the one selected did not materially change the result,
except for the AI-treated patients where the adjHRs increased
after
further
adjustments
for
TAM,
chemotherapy,
and
radiotherapy.
As smoking appeared to have the strongest association in the
AI-treated patients, stratification according to AI treatment was
performed for the patients treated with radiotherapy, where a
weak association between smoking and breast cancer events was
found. Here, there was a four-fold risk for events in the 233
radiotherapy-treated patients who had received AIs (log rank,
Po0.001; adjHR: 4.13; 95% CI: 1.66–10.26). No association
between smoking and events was observed in the 406 radio-
therapy-treated patients who had not received AIs (log rank,
P ¼ 0.94).

 Similarly, after exclusion of AI-treated patients, there was no
association between smoking and breast cancer events (log rank,
P ¼ 0.98) or distant metastasis (log rank, P ¼ 0.51) in the
remaining patients irrespective of age and ER status. However,
there was a borderline significant increased risk for death due to
any cause among patients who had not received AI treatment, but
this was only found in the multivariable model (log rank, P ¼ 0.43;
adjHR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.01–3.26).
DISCUSSION
The main finding of the present study was the increased risk of
breast cancer events, distant metastasis, and death among AI-
treated patients X50 years who smoked at the preoperative visit
compared with non-smokers. To our knowledge, this association
has not been previously reported. Smoking was not associated with
breast cancer events or distant metastases in other treatment
groups.
In line with several other large studies including between 792
and 20 691 patients, current smoking was associated with a two-
fold increased risk for death due to any cause (Manjer et al, 2000;
Holmes et al, 2007; Braithwaite et al, 2012; Berube et al, 2014;
Pierce et al, 2014; Seibold et al, 2014; Nechuta et al, 2016; Passarelli
et al, 2016), with effect sizes ranging from 1.34 to 2.63. These
studies also had access to data on former smoking history and five
of them showed an increased risk for death also with former

 smoking (Braithwaite et al, 2012; Berube et al, 2014; Pierce et al,
2014; Nechuta et al, 2016; Passarelli et al, 2016). However, in two
of these studies, this association was only found in former smokers
with 20 þ pack-years (Pierce et al, 2014; Nechuta et al, 2016).
These two latter studies were partly based on the same study
population and smoking was assessed on average 2 years after
diagnosis, thus excluding early events. Only one other study
examined current smoking in relation to all-cause mortality in
different treatment groups. This study stratified according to TAM
treatment, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy and reported no
increased risk, but showed no data on AI treatment (Holmes
et al, 2007). Their finding of no increased risk in patients treated
with TAM, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy is in line with the
results of the present study. Eight of these studies investigated
breast cancer-specific survival (Manjer et al, 2000; Holmes et al,
2007; Braithwaite et al, 2012; Berube et al, 2014; Pierce et al, 2014;
Seibold et al, 2014; Nechuta et al, 2016; Passarelli et al, 2016), of
which five reported a statistically significant increased risk for
current smokers ranging between 1.25 and 2.14 (Manjer et al, 2000;
Braithwaite et al, 2012; Pierce et al, 2014; Nechuta et al, 2016;
Passarelli et al, 2016). Risk for recurrence with current smoking
ranged from 1.05 to 1.41 in four studies, but was significant only in
the one study with the highest estimate (Pierce et al, 2014) and not
in the three other studies (Holmes et al, 2007; Seibold et al, 2014;
Nechuta et al, 2016). In the study by Nechuta et al (2016), former
smokers with 20 þ pack-years had a statistically increased risk for
recurrence. Their study examined late recurrences 5 þ
years
postdiagnosis and only included patients with ER þ tumours
(Nechuta et al, 2016). In the present study, former smokers were
grouped with never smokers and this may have attenuated the
results. None of the referenced eight former studies took AI
treatment into account and the vast majority of patients were
included before routinely available AI treatment.
There could be several mechanisms behind the results in the
present study of a worse short-term prognosis in AI-treated
patients. In line with other studies (Albanes et al, 1987; Barrett-
Connor and Khaw, 1989; Molarius et al, 1997; Holmes et al, 2007;

 Berube et al, 2014; Huzell et al, 2015), several patient character-
istics that may influence prognosis differed between smokers and
non-smokers in the present study. We have previously reported
higher frequency of smoking with increasing pre- and post-
operative alcohol intake in the present cohort (Simonsson et al,
2014). However, alcohol intake was not associated with increased
risk for events in any treatment group in this cohort and cannot
explain the association between smoking and risk for events in AI-
treated patients. Smokers had lower BMIs but a tendency towards
larger waist-to-hip ratios and smaller breast volumes than non-
smokers. These anthropometric factors have been associated with a
more androgenic profile (Bjo
¨rntorp, 1997; Baglietto et al, 2009)
that may influence AI response (Morris et al, 2001). Smoking may
also be associated with other patient characteristics that were not
assessed in this study such as patterns of physical activity that may
influence prognosis (Nechuta et al, 2016).
Smoking was also associated with hormone receptor-negative
tumours in the present cohort, whereas results from other studies
are conflicting. A cohort of over 2000 breast cancer cases found no
association
between
smoking
and
hormone
receptor
status
(Braithwaite et al, 2012). A large cohort of 148 000 women
reported an increased risk for ER þ cancer but no association with
incident triple-negative cancer with over 40 pack-years of smoking
(Kabat et al, 2011), which is in line with another large cohort of
117 000 women who reported smoking to be weakly associated
with development of ER þ
tumours (London et al, 1989).
Conversely, smoking was significantly associated with development
of hormone receptor-negative breast cancer in a South Swedish
cohort of 10 000 women (Manjer et al, 2001). In Sweden, tumours
are considered ER þ when 410% of the nuclei are stained,
whereas other countries have a cutoff of 41%. Exact ER levels
were unavailable in the present study, but according to a review, it

 remains unclear to what extent hormone receptor levels impact on
treatment response (Rastelli and Crispino, 2008).
Nicotine and tobacco alkaloids have been shown to inhibit
oestrogen synthesis via the aromatase enzyme in vitro (Barbieri
et al, 1986; Kadohama et al, 1993). Tumours that develop in
smokers may already be resistant to AIs. In the present study, there
were no data regarding smoking history. Former smokers were
analysed
as
non-smokers.
If
smoking
renders
the
tumour
AI-resistant, this would have led to a bias towards the null. Data
on former smoking would have enabled analyses of whether the
tumours were already resistant to AIs irrespective of smoking
status during AI treatment. If the tumour were AI-resistant,
smokers could be offered TAM, as smoking was not associated
with prognosis in TAM-treated patients. Cigarette smoke may also
interact with therapy through upregulation of cytochrome P450
enzymes such as CYP1A2 that is involved in both metabolism of
oestrogens and AIs (Grimm and Dyroff, 1997; Schrenk et al, 1998;
Tsuchiya et al, 2005; Kamdem et al, 2011). Moreover, CYP1A2
genotypes predicted short-term prognosis in AI-treated patients
from a subset of this cohort (Simonsson et al, 2016). If cigarette
smoke interacts with AIs, smokers assigned to AIs should be
encouraged to quit. As only 10% of the preoperative smokers in the
present study quit during the first year of follow-up, evaluation of
smoking cessation was not possible.
Smokers tended to have a somewhat shorter duration of
endocrine treatment (data not shown), and this may in part explain
the increased risk of events among AI-treated smokers. Previous
work from the same cohort reported that preoperative smokers are
more likely to be non-adherent to endocrine therapy (Markkula
et al, 2012b). However, this does not explain why there was no
association between smoking and risk for events in TAM-treated
patients.
This study has some limitations. No data on former smoking
habits, socioeconomic status, or exact ER levels were collected.
Also, the mechanisms behind the association between smoking and
worse prognosis in AI-treated patients remain to be elucidated.
A strength of the present study was that it is population-based, as
patients were not referred to other hospitals for surgery. The
majority of the female patients with primary breast cancer that fit
the inclusion criteria participated in the study, and the main reason
for non-participation was lack of available research nurses, where
non-inclusion was unrelated to characteristics of the patients or
their type of tumours. Approximately 5% of patients had an
unclear diagnosis at the time of surgery and were therefore not
included (Lundin et al, 2011). The included patients were
comparable to all operated female patients with respect to age
but had slightly higher frequency of ER þ and PgR þ tumours. No
data were available on socioeconomic status or other tumour
characteristics.
Another strength was that information on smoking was
collected from questionnaires both pre- and postoperatively and
not from patients’ charts. As it was a prospective study, the risk for
bias in the smoking variable due to survival or recall bias was
minimised.
In conclusion, preoperative smoking was only associated with
an increased risk for breast cancer events and distant metastasis
among AI-treated patients. If confirmed, smoking status should be
taken into consideration when selecting endocrine therapy.
