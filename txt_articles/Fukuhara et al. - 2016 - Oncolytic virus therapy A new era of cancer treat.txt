Oncolytic virus therapy is perhaps the next major breakthrough in cancer treat-
ment following the success in immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibi-
tors.
Oncolytic
viruses
are
defined
as
genetically
engineered
or
naturally
occurring viruses that selectively replicate in and kill cancer cells without harming
the normal tissues. T-Vec (talimogene laherparepvec), a second-generation onco-
lytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) armed with GM-CSF, was recently
approved as the first oncolytic virus drug in the USA and Europe. The phase III
trial proved that local intralesional injections with T-Vec in advanced malignant
melanoma patients can not only suppress the growth of injected tumors but also
act systemically and prolong overall survival. Other oncolytic viruses that are
closing in on drug approval in North America and Europe include vaccinia virus
JX-594
(pexastimogene
devacirepvec)
for
hepatocellular carcinoma, GM-CSF-
expressing adenovirus CG0070 for bladder cancer, and Reolysin (pelareorep), a
wild-type variant of reovirus, for head and neck cancer. In Japan, a phase II clini-
cal trial of G47Δ, a third-generation oncolytic HSV-1, is ongoing in glioblastoma
patients. G47Δ was recently designated as a “Sakigake” breakthrough therapy
drug in Japan. This new system by the Japanese government should provide
G47Δ with priority reviews and a fast-track drug approval by the regulatory
authorities. Whereas numerous oncolytic viruses have been subjected to clinical
trials, the common feature that is expected to play a major role in prolonging
the survival of cancer patients is an induction of specific antitumor immunity in
the course of tumor-specific viral replication. It appears that it will not be long
before oncolytic virus therapy becomes a standard therapeutic option for all
cancer patients.
O
ncolytic virus therapy has recently been recognized as a
promising new therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.
An oncolytic virus is defined as a genetically engineered or
naturally occurring virus that can selectively replicate in and
kill cancer cells without harming the normal tissues. In con-
trast to gene therapy where a virus is used as a mere carrier
for transgene delivery, oncolytic virus therapy uses the virus
itself as an active drug reagent.
The concept of oncolytic virus therapy has existed for some
time (Fig. 1). Tumor regression has often been observed dur-
ing or after a naturally acquired, systemic viral infection.(1,2)
In 1949, 22 patients with Hodgkin’s disease were treated with
sera or tissue extracts containing hepatitis virus.(3) Between
1950 and 1980, many clinical trials were performed in
attempts to treat cancer with wild type or naturally attenuated
viruses, including hepatitis. West Nile fever, yellow fever, den-
gue fever and adenoviruses.(4) However, these viruses were not
deemed useful as therapeutics reagents because, in those days,
there was no known method to control the virulence and yet
retain viral replication in cancer cells.
It is now recognized, because protection mechanisms against
viral
infection
(e.g.
interferon-beta
signal
pathway)
are
impaired in the majority of cancer cells,(5) that most viruses
can replicate to a much greater extent in cancer cells than in
normal cells. Therefore, getting a virus to replicate in cancer
cells is not a problem: What is difficult is making a virus not
replicate in normal cells at all, while retaining its replication
capability in cancer cells. Attempts to achieve cancer cell-spe-
cific replication have been undertaken either by selecting a
virus that is non-virulent in humans or by engineering the virus
genome (Fig. 2). Representing the former strategy is Reolysin,
a wild-type variant of reovirus that exhibits oncolytic proper-
ties in cells with activated Ras signaling with limited virulence
in normal human cells. The latter strategy is, however, better
suited to achieving strict control of viral replication. In 1991,
Martuza et al.(6) demonstrated that a genetically engineered
herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) with a mutation in the
thymidine kinase (TK) gene replicated selectively in cancer
cells and was useful for treating experimental brain tumors.
Their findings opened up a whole new area of oncolytic virus

 development that involves designing and constructing the viral
genome. During the past two decades of thriving development,
probably the most important finding regarding oncolytic virus
therapy was that a systemic tumor-specific immunity is effi-
ciently induced in the course of oncolytic activities.(7,8) This
phenomenon is now widely recognized as the common feature
for all oncolytic virus therapy that is expected to play a major
role in prolonging the survival of cancer patients (Fig. 3).
To date, two genetically engineered oncolytic viruses have
been approved for marketing as drugs. One is Oncorine (H101,
the same construct as ONYX-015),(9) an E1B-deleted aden-
ovirus, which was approved in China for head and neck cancer
and esophagus cancer in 2005.(10,11) The use and clinical data
of Oncorine is so far limited to China. The other is T-Vec (tal-
imogene laherparepvec, IMLYGIC, formerly OncoVEXGM-
CSF), which was approved for melanoma by the FDA in the
USA in October 2015 and was subsequently approved in Eur-
ope
in
January
2016
and
in
Australia

(Fig. 1).(12,13) Many clinical trials using T-Vec are currently
performed worldwide by the pharmaceutical company in order
to expand its application and also to expand countries for mar-
keting. This review focuses on those oncolytic viruses under
development that are likely to become treatment options in the
near future (Table 1).
Genetically engineered oncolytic viruses
With the development of modern techniques of genetic engi-
neering and increasing knowledge regarding the functions and
structures of viral genes, designing and manipulating the viral
genome to create a non-pathogenic virus has become the stan-
dard method for oncolytic virus development. Typically, DNA
viruses are used for this strategy.
T-Vec. T-Vec is a double-mutated HSV-1 with deletions in
the c34.5 and a47 genes, and the human granulocyte-macro-
phage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene inserted into
the deleted c34.5 loci.(14) The deletion in the c34.5 genes is
mainly responsible for cancer-selective replication and attenua-
tion of pathogenicity.(15–17) Because the c34.5 gene functions
to negate the host cell’s shut-off of protein synthesis upon viral
infection,(18) inactivation of c34.5 renders the virus unable to
replicate in normal cells. However, because cancer cells are in
defect of the shut-off response, c34.5-deficient HSV-1 can still
replicate in cancer cells.(19) The a47 gene functions to antago-
nize the host cell’s transporter associated with antigen presen-
tation; therefore, the deletion of the gene precludes the
downregulation of MHC class I expression, which should
enhance the antitumor immune responses.(20–22) The deletion
in the a47 gene also results in immediate early expression of
the neighbor US11 gene, which results in enhanced viral repli-
cation
in
cancer
cells.(23)
The
GM-CSF
expression
was
intended
to
enhance
the
antitumor
immunity
induction,
although convincing preclinical evidence has not been shown.
The safety of T-Vec was tested in a phase I study in patients
with various metastatic tumors, including breast, head/neck
and gastrointestinal cancers, and malignant melanoma. Overall,
intralesional administration of the virus was well tolerated by
patients.(14) Although no complete or partial responses were

human GM-CSF in both copies of the c34.5 gene and a deletion in the
a47 gene. G47Δ has a deletion in both copies of the c34.5 gene, a
deletion in the a47 gene, and an insertion of the lacZ coding
sequence in the ICP6 locus. JX-594 has an insertion of human GM-CSF
and lacZ transgenes in the TK locus. Reolysin has a segmented gen-
ome composed of ten segments of double stranded RNA and a double
shell of capsid.

Mechanisms of action of oncolytic virus therapy. Local replica-
tion of oncolytic virus induces specific antitumor immunity in the
course of its oncolytic activities that act on remote lesions. A combina-
tion
with

inhibitors
or
chemotherapy
may
enhance the efficacy of oncolytic virus therapy. Arming oncolytic
viruses with immunostimulatory gene(s) or cancer therapeutic genes
may also be beneficial.

 observed, stable disease was observed in several patients, and
most tumor biopsies showed tumor necrosis. T-Vec was further
tested in phase II studies in patients with metastatic mela-
noma.(24) A single arm phase II study resulted in an overall
response rate of 26%, with responses in both injected and
uninjected lesions, including visceral lesions. An increase in
CD8+ T cells and a reduction in CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T
cells were detected in biopsy samples of regressing lesions.(25)
A randomized phase III trial was performed in patients with
unresected
stage
IIIB–IV
melanoma
(OPTiM;
NCT00769704).(13) A total of 436 patients were randomly
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intralesional T-Vec or subcutaneous
GM-CSF treatment arms. T-Vec was administered at a concen-
tration of 108 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL injected into 1 or
more skin or subcutaneous tumors on Days 1 and 15 of each
28-day cycle for up to 12 months, while GM-CSF was admin-
istered at a dose of 125 lg/m²/day subcutaneously for 14 con-
secutive days followed by 14 days of rest, in 28-day treatment
cycles for up to 12 months. At the primary analysis, 290
deaths had occurred (T-Vec, n = 189; GM-CSF, n = 101). The
durable response rate (objective response lasting continuously
≥6 months) was significantly higher in the T-Vec arm (16.3%)
compared with the GM-CSF arm (2.1%). The overall response
rate was also higher in the T-Vec arm (26.4 vs 5.7%). The
most common adverse events with T-Vec were fatigue, chills
and pyrexia, but the only grade 3 or 4 treatment-related
adverse event, occurring in over 2% of patients, was cellulitis
(T-Vec, n = 6; GM-CSF, n = 1). There were no fatal treat-
ment-related adverse events. At the time of publication, med-
ian overall survival (OS) was 23.3 months for the T-Vec arm
versus 18.9 months for the GM-CSF arm (hazard ratio, 0.79;
P = 0.051),(13) but the difference in OS became significant
(P = 0.049) by the time of drug application. The treatment
benefit in OS was more obviously significant when T-Vec was
used as the first-line treatment, and in the subgroup of patients
with stage IIIB, IIIC or IVM1.(13) This phase III trial was the
first to prove that local intralesional injections with an oncoly-
tic virus can not only suppress the growth of injected tumors
but also prolong the OS, supposedly via induction of systemic
antitumor immunity. Based on this observation, several clinical
trials of T-Vec in combination with systemic administration
with immune check point inhibitors are ongoing.
G47Δ. G47D is a triple-mutated third-generation oncolytic
HSV-1 that was developed by Todo et al. by adding another
deletion mutation to the genome of G207, a second generation
HSV-1.(26, 27) G47Δ was developed to strengthen the antitumor
efficacy while retaining the safety features of G207, mainly
through enhancing the capability to elicit specific antitumor
immunity.(27) Two of the mutations of G47D are created in the
c34.5 and a47 genes, the same genes that T-Vec utilizes.
G47Δ further has an insertion of the Escherichia coli LacZ
gene inactivating the ICP6 gene. The ICP6 gene encodes the
large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) that is essential
for viral DNA synthesis.(28,29) When ICP6 is inactivated,
HSV-1 can replicate only in proliferating cells that express
high enough levels of host RR to compensate for the deficient
viral RR. Because of the three manmade mutations in the gen-
ome, G47Δ should be much attenuated and, therefore, safer in
normal tissues than those with two mutations such as G207
and T-Vec. Furthermore, because the immediate-early expres-
sion of US11 caused by the deletion within the a47 gene pre-
vents the premature termination of protein synthesis that slows
the growth of c34.5-deficient HSV-1 strains such as G207,
G47Δ shows augmented replication capability in cancer cells,
resulting in having a wider therapeutic window than any other
oncolytic HSV-1.
G47D demonstrated a greater replication capability and a
higher antitumor efficacy than G207.(27) G47Δ exhibited efficacy
in basically all in vivo solid tumor models tested, including
glioma, breast cancer,(30) prostate cancer,(31–33) schwannoma,(34)
nasopharyngeal carcinoma,(35) hepatocellular carcinoma,(36) col-
orectal cancer,(37) malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor(38)
and thyroid carcinoma.(39) G47Δ has been shown to kill cancer
stem cells derived from human glioblastoma efficiently.(40)
G47Δ is currently the only third generation HSV-1 to be tested
in humans.(27,41) Following the phase I–IIa study in patients with

Fukuhara et al.
 recurrent glioblastoma that was conducted in Japan and success-
fully completed in 2014, a phase II study started in 2015 in
patients
with
residual
or
recurrent
glioblastoma
(UMIN000015995). G47Δ (1 9 109 pfu) is injected stereotacti-
cally into the brain tumor twice within 2 weeks and then every
4 weeks, for a maximum six times. In February 2016, G47Δ was
designated as a “Sakigake” breakthrough therapy drug by the
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW).
“Sakigake” is a Japanese word meaning “ahead of the world.”
This new system by the Japanese government provides the
designated drug candidate, namely G47Δ, with an early assess-
ment and priority reviews by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical
Devices Agency of Japan (PMDA), and therefore should allow
its fast-tracked drug approval by MHLW.
Besides the clinical trials in glioblastoma, we have just com-
pleted a single arm phase I study in patients with castration-
resistant prostate cancer, in which 3 9 108 pfu of G47Δ was
injected into the prostate using a transrectal ultrasound-guided
transperineal technique (UMIN000010463). Dose escalation
was planned in three cohorts, with patients receiving G47Δ
twice in the first cohort, three times in the second and four
times in the third. The treatment was well tolerated by
patients, with no severe adverse events attributable to G47Δ
observed to date. A phase I study has been ongoing in patients
with
recurrent
olfactory
neuroblastoma
since
2013
(UMIN000011636).
JX-594. JX-594 (pexastimogene devacirepvec, Pexa-Vec) is a
genertically engineered vaccinia virus that has a mutation in
the TK gene, conferring cancer cell-selective replication, and
an insertion of the human GM-CSF gene, augmenting the anti-
tumor immune response. JX-594 also has a LacZ gene inser-
tion as a marker.(42–44) The advantages of using vaccinia virus
include intravenous stability for delivery, strong cytotoxicity
and extensive safety experience as a live vaccine.(42) In a
phase I study, intralesional injection of primary or metastatic
liver tumors with JX-594 was generally well tolerated in the
context of JX-594 replication, GM-CSF expression and sys-
temic dissemination. Direct hyperbilirubinemia was the dose-
limiting toxicity.(45) High dose JX-594 was used for a dose-
escalation phase I trial to test the feasibility of intravenous
delivery.(46) A randomized phase II dose-finding trial was per-
formed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.(47) When a
low or high dose of JX-594 was infused, OS was significantly
longer in the high dose arm compared with the low dose arm
(n = 14 vs 16, median OS 14.1 vs 6.7 months, respectively). A
phase III trial in patients with advanced stage hepatocellular
carcinoma began enrolling patients in late 2015 (PHOCUS,
NCT02562755). In this trial, JX-594 (109 pfu) is administered
intralesionally three times bi-weekly at days 1, 15 and 29, fol-
lowed by sorafenib at day 43, whereas, in the control arm, sor-
afenib begins on Day 1 at 400 mg twice daily.
CG0070. CG0070 is an oncolytic adenovirus developed by
Ramesh et al.(48) Ad5 adenovirus was engineered so that the
human E2F-1 promoter drives the E1A gene, and the human
GM-CSF gene is inserted. E2F-1 is regulated by the retinoblas-
toma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), which is commonly
mutated in bladder cancer, and a loss of Rb binding results in
a transcriptionally active E2F-1.(49)
A phase I trial of CG0070 was conducted in patients with non-
muscle-invasive bladder cancer who did not respond to BCG
therapy.(50) Single or multiple (every 28 days 9 3 and/or
weekly six times) dose(s) of up to 3 9 1013 virus particles (vp)
were administered intravesically. No clinically significant seri-
ous adverse events related to treatment were reported, and the
most common adverse events observed were grade 1–2 bladder
toxicities, such as dysuria, bladder pain and frequency.(50) The
overall response rate was 48.6% (17 of 35), which increased to
63.6% (14 of 22) in the multi-dose cohort. In the following ran-
domized phase II/III trial in patients with non-muscle-invasive
bladder cancer, 15 patients received CG0070 and 7 control
patients received other standard intravesical therapies (BOND,
NCT01438112). Although there was no apparent difference in
the initial CR (8 patients of CG0070 [53%] vs 4 of control group
[57%]), CG0070 treatment demonstrated a better durable
response in a subset of high-risk patients.(51) In a single arm
phase III trial that is underway, patients with BCG-refractory
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer are given CG0070 intravesi-
cally at a dose of 1012 vp weekly for 6 weeks. Patients who
achieved a partial or complete response at 6 months after the
first intervention are maintained with the same induction cycle
every 6 months (BOND2, NCT02365818).
Naturally occurring oncolytic viruses
The idea of using naturally occurring viruses for the treatment
of cancer was almost abandoned after vigorous attempts during
the 1960s and 1970s because of the lack of means to control
viral pathogenicity at the time. However, the idea was revived
along with the emerging development of genetically engi-
neered
viruses,
and
newly
developed
naturally
occurring
viruses are typically those that are not pathogenic in humans.
Reolysin. Reoviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses that
replicate preferentially in transformed cell lines but not in nor-
mal cells.(52–54) In theory, oncolytic properties of reovirus
depend on activated Ras signaling.(55,56) Reolysin is the T3D
strain of reovirus, which has been most extensively studied
among several serotypes as an anticancer agent, and is cur-
rently the only therapeutic wild-type reovirus in clinical devel-
opment.(57)
The first phase I trial involved intralesional administration of
Reolysin in patients with advanced solid tumors.(58) The most
common treatment-related adverse events were nausea (79%),
vomiting (58%), erythema at the injection site (42%), fevers/
chills (37%) and transient flu-like symptoms (32%).(58) Further
phase I studies demonstrated the safety and broad anticancer
activity
of
Reolysin
in
prostate
cancer,(59)
malignant
glioma,(60) metastatic colorectal cancer,(61,62) multiple mye-
loma(63) and solid cancers.(64,65) Multiple phase II studies have
investigated intralesional injection of Reolysin together with
local irradiation for the treatment of refractory or metastatic
solid tumors,(66) intravenous administration of Reolysin for
metastatic melanoma(67) and intravenous administration of
Reolysin in combination with chemotherapy for head and neck
cancer or lung squamous cell carcinoma.(68,69)
A randomized double-blinded phase III trial has been per-
formed, comparing intravenous Reolysin in combination with
paclitaxel and carboplatin versus chemotherapy alone, in
patients with metastatic and/or recurrent head and neck cancer
(NCT01166542). Patients were treated with intravenous admin-
istration
of

culture
infectious
dose-50
(TCID50) of Reolysin on days 1–5 with standard doses of
intravenous paclitaxel and carboplatin on day 1 only every
21 days, versus standard doses of intravenous paclitaxel and
carboplatin alone. According to a report by the company
developing Reolysin, of 165 patients analyzed, 118 patients
had regional head and neck cancer with/without distant metas-
tases and 47 patients had distant metastases only. In patients
with regional cancer, a significant improvement in OS was

 observed for the Reolysin group versus the control group
(P = 0.0146).(57) The FDA in the USA granted Reolysin an
orphan drug designation for malignant glioma, ovarian cancer
and pancreatic cancer in 2015.
Limitations of oncolytic virus therapy
A wide variety of oncolytic viruses are currently under clinical
development worldwide, and, as described in this review, each
oncolytic virus carries the characteristics of the parental wild-
type virus, not only the advantages but also the disadvantages.
For example, in regards to oncolytic HSV-1, such as T-Vec
and G47Δ, because HSV-1 spreads from cell to cell and does
not naturally cause viremia, oncolytic HSV-1 is best adminis-
tered intralesionally and may not be well suited for intravenous
delivery. However, as proven by the phase III study of T-Vec
in melanoma patients at advanced stages,(13) local intralesional
injections with oncolytic HSV-1 can act on remote lesions via
induction of systemic antitumor immunity and prolong sur-
vival. It has been shown that expression of GM-CSF does not
augment the efficacy of oncolytic HSV-1, while IL-12 expres-
sion does, in immunocompetent mouse tumor models.(31)
Therefore, it is likely that the systemic effect via antitumor
immunity was due to the characteristics of HSV-1 itself rather
than the effect by GM-CSF.
One major concern of oncolytic virus therapy has been that
the efficacy may be diminished by the presence of circulating
antibodies.(57) Viruses that naturally cause viremia are likely
vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies; therefore, for such viruses,
the antitumor effect of intravenous administration may be lim-
ited in patients who have had previous treatment or vaccination.
An unfavorable effect of circulating antibodies was well docu-
mented in a clinical trial using oncolytic measles virus (MV-
NIS) in patients with multiple myeloma.(70) In this dose escala-
tion study, it was only after the dosing level reached a very high
dose of 1011 TCID50 that intravenous infusion with MV-NIS
showed efficacy. In a preclinical study using tumor-bearing
immunocompetent mice, intravenous treatment with reovirus
resulted in regrowth of tumors 3 weeks after initial tumor
growth inhibition, which coincided with the rise in serum anti-
reovirus antibody titers.(71) Phase I data showed that the maxi-
mum neutralizing anti-reovirus antibody titers were reached by
day 7 in 12 (36%) of 33 patients and at day 14 in 20 patients
(61%).(72) It was, therefore, recommended that, for systemic
treatment, reovirus should be administered in rapid, repeated,
high doses within the first week of treatment before the rise of
serum neutralizing antibodies, and that it should be used in com-
bination with other anticancer therapies.(57)
Oncolytic virus as immunotherapy
All genetically engineered oncolytic viruses described in this
review were designed to enhance the induction of antitumor
immunity that accompanies the oncolytic activity. Both T-Vec
and G47Δ have a deletion in the a47 gene, the product of
which inhibits the transporter associated with antigen presenta-
tion; therefore, cancer cells subjected to the oncolytic activities
of these viruses are vulnerable to immune surveillance, and the
processing by antigen presenting cells is likely facilitated.(21,22)
A combination with systemic administration of immune check-
point inhibitor is a reasonable strategy to enhance the efficacy
of oncolytic viruses. In a preclinical study, intralesional Reoly-
sin treatment in combination with intravenous anti-PD-1 anti-
body administration was significantly more efficacious than
Reolysin or anti-PD-1 alone in mice with subcutaneous mela-
noma.(73) A phase Ib/II clinical trial of T-Vec in combination
with ipilimumab (anti–CTLA4) is currently ongoing in patients
with stage IIIb-IV melanoma (NCT01740297). Preliminary
results from the first 18 patients showed that the median time
to response was 5.3 months, and the 18-month PFS and OS
rates were 50% and 67%, respectively, with a median follow-
up of 17 months.(74). An open-label Phase Ib/III study in
patients
with
previously
untreated,
unresected
stage IIIb–
IVM1c melanoma will further evaluate the safety and efficacy
of the combination of T-Vec and pembrolizumab (anti–PD-1)
compared with pembrolizumab alone (NCT02263508).(75) A
phase I study of T-Vec in combination with pembrolizumab
has also started for head and neck cancer in late 2015 (Master-
key232, NCT02626000). For all oncolytic virus therapy, long-
term side effects from the induction of systemic antitumor
immunity, including development of autoimmune diseases,
should be closely investigated.
Like T-Vec, JX-594 and CG0070 that have the GM-CSF
gene inserted in the viral genome, “arming” oncolytic viruses
with transgene(s) is a useful strategy to add certain antitumor
functions to oncolytic viruses. According to preclinical studies
with oncolytic HSV-1, however, GM-CSF is not exactly an
ideal transgene for “arming”; rather, interleukin 12, interleukin
18 or soluble B7-1 would significantly enhance the antitumor
efficacy
via
augmenting
the
antitumor
immunity
induc-
tion.(31,32,76) Besides immunostimulatory genes, various trans-
genes of other antitumor functions, including antiangiogenesis,
have been utilized to arm oncolytic viruses.(77–79)
Conclusion
It would not be too early to say that oncolytic virus therapy is
now established as an approach to treat cancer. Because an
induction of specific antitumor immunity in the course of onco-
lytic activities is the common feature that plays an important role
in presenting antitumor effects, the efficacy of oncolytic virus
therapy is expected to improve further when combined with
immunotherapy. By arming oncolytic viruses with functional
transgenes, a whole panel of oncolytic viruses with a variety of
antitumor functions would be available in the future, from which
a combination of appropriate viruses can be chosen according to
the type and stage of cancer. A new era of cancer treatment
seems at dawn, where cancer patients can freely choose oncoly-
tic virus therapy as a treatment option.
