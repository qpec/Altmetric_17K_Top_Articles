Abstract
BACKGROUND—Genomic analyses have suggested that the LPA gene and its associated plasma 
biomarker, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), represent a causal risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). 
As such, lowering Lp(a) has emerged as a therapeutic strategy. Beyond target identification, 
human genetics may contribute to the development of new therapies by defining the full spectrum 
of beneficial and adverse consequences and by developing a dose-response curve of target 
perturbation.
OBJECTIVES—We attempted to establish the full phenotypic impact of LPA gene variation and 
to estimate a dose-response curve between genetically altered plasma Lp(a) and risk for CHD.
METHODS—We leveraged genetic variants at the LPA gene from 3 data sources: individual-level 
data from 112,338 participants in the UK Biobank; summary association results from large-scale 
genome-wide association studies; and LPA gene sequencing results from cases with and controls 
free of CHD.
RESULTS—One standard deviation genetically lowered Lp(a) level was associated with 29% 
lower risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69 to 0.73), 31% lower 
risk of peripheral vascular disease (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.80), 13% lower risk of stroke 
(OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.96), 17% lower risk of heart failure (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73 to 
0.94), and 37% lower risk of aortic stenosis (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.83). We observed no 
association with 31 other disorders including type 2 diabetes and cancer. Variants that led to gain 
of LPA gene function increased risk for CHD whereas those that led to loss of gene function 
reduced CHD risk.

 CONCLUSIONS—Beyond CHD, genetically lowered Lp(a) is associated with a lower risk of 
peripheral vascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and aortic stenosis. As such, pharmacological 
lowering of plasma Lp(a) may impact a range of atherosclerosis-related diseases.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a circulating lipoprotein where the constituent apolipoprotein B on 
a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle is modified by the covalent addition of another 
protein, namely apolipoprotein(a) (1, 2). Higher plasma Lp(a) levels are correlated with 
increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) (3), heritable, and largely determined by 
variation in the LPA gene, which encodes apolipoprotein(a) (2). Genetic variants in LPA that 
increase Lp(a) levels also increase CHD risk, suggesting that Lp(a) is a causal risk factor for 
development of CHD (4–6). Consequently, lowering Lp(a) levels has emerged as a 
therapeutic strategy to reduce CHD risk (2, 7).
Beyond identifying a therapeutic target gene, human genetics may help estimate the 
probable efficacy and safety of pharmacological modulation (8). Although LPA variants 
have been consistently reported to be associated with CHD (5, 6) and aortic valve stenosis 
(9, 10), there is uncertainty around the full spectrum of phenotypic consequences. Previous 
studies have reported conflicting evidence on whether LPA variants are associated with other 
cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke (11, 12). In addition, observational epidemiology has 
associated lower plasma levels of Lp(a) with increased risks of cancer (13) and diabetes 
(14).
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence variants might also provide a mechanism to 
estimate a dose-response curve. In particular, the simultaneous identification of gain-of-
function as well as loss-of-function variants and an analysis of phenotypic effects can reveal 
a dose-response curve even before a clinical trial is initiated.
Here, we leveraged genetic variants across the allele frequency spectrum and 3 large data 
sources to evaluate the phenotypic consequences of genetically lowered Lp(a) levels. We 
estimate the effect of a genetically mediated 1 standard deviation decrease in Lp(a) levels on 
cardiometabolic disease and range of other disorders.
METHODS
Overall study design is shown in Figure 1. We leveraged several data sources to provide 
greater power for estimating the effect of genetically lowered Lp(a) on cardiometabolic traits 
and outcomes, to conduct a phenome-wide association study, and to examine the effect of 
rare loss-of-function variants in the LPA gene on risk of CHD.
We used individual-level data from 112,338 individuals of European ancestry from the UK 
Biobank, a large population-based cohort (Online Supplement) (15). Characteristics of 
individuals are provided in Online Table 1. We supplemented this individual-level data with

 summary results from 7 genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia examining blood 
lipids, anthropometric traits, glycemic traits, diabetes, CHD, heart failure (HF), and renal 
dysfunction, all predominantly containing individuals of European descent (Online 
Supplement and Table 1) (16–23). Our estimates for CHD were derived from the 
CARDIoGRAM Exome Consortium analysis of up to 42,335 CHD cases and 78,240 
controls (Online Supplement). Finally, we used LPA gene sequences from 15,251 
participants of European ancestry from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics (MIGen) 
Consortium.
In our primary analysis, we examined the effect of genetically lowered Lp(a) on 9 different 
cardiometabolic diseases: CHD; stroke; HF; atrial fibrillation; aortic stenosis; peripheral 
vascular disease (PVD); venous thromboembolism; diabetes; and chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) (Online Table 2). We additionally examined the effect of genetically lowered Lp(a) 
on 15 cardiometabolic quantitative traits (Online Supplement): waist-to-hip ratio; waist 
circumference; hip circumference; body mass index; systolic blood pressure; diastolic blood 
pressure; total cholesterol; LDL cholesterol; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; 
triglyceride levels; fasting glucose; fasting insulin; 2-hour glucose; glycosylated 
hemoglobin; and serum creatinine-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). All 
traits were standardized (that is, reported in units of SDs) to allow for comparisons among 
traits (Online Supplement). Using the UK Biobank cohort, we also conducted a phenome-
wide association study for 28 additional diseases, including endocrine, renal, urological, 
gastrointestinal, neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory and neoplastic disorders (Online 
Table 2).
DNA SEQUENCE VARIANTS
To estimate the effect of genetically lowered Lp(a) on a wide range of phenotypes, we 
combined individual-level data from UK Biobank with summary-level data from large-scale 
GWAS. We used 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the LPA gene that have been 
previously associated with plasma Lp(a) levels: rs10455872; rs3798220; rs41272114; and 
rs143431368 (Online Table 3). Together, rs10455872 and rs3798220 explain about 36% of 
variation in plasma Lp(a) levels (5); the other 2, rs41272114 and rs143431368, are loss-of-
function variants associated with lower Lp(a) levels (Online Table 3).
To standardize our estimates to 1 SD decrease in Lp(a) levels, we used estimates of the 
effect of each variant on Lp(a) levels from the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) 
study (Online Table 3 and Online Supplement). ARIC is a community-based study of 15,792 
white and black participants, ages 45 to 64 years, who were first enrolled in 1987 (24). We 
restricted our analysis to 2,758 individuals of European ancestry in the ARIC cohort who 
had Lp(a) levels measured at the baseline visit and measured using a double-antibody 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (25). Participants fasted for 12 to 24 h before blood 
collection. Plasma was separated from cells with centrifugation within 1 h of collection and 
stored at −70°C. Analyses were performed within 2 weeks. The assay was shown to have 
high internal reliability in a validation study in ARIC (r = 0.9) (25) and in a separate 
comparison to a newer assay calibrated using International Federation of Clinical Chemistry 
reference material (r = 0.88) (26). We used linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, and 5

 principal components of ancestry to estimate the association between each variant and Lp(a) 
level in an additive model. As Lp(a) levels were non-normally distributed, we used log-
transformed Lp(a) levels, as previously described (5).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For analyses of both UK Biobank and summary-level data, we created a gene variant score 
out of the 4 SNPs. For each variant, we modeled the Lp(a)-lowering allele and weighted by 
the effect of each SNP on log-transformed Lp(a) levels in SD units (Online Table 4). We 
then examined the effect of this gene variant score on each trait and outcome, standardized 
per SD decrease in log-transformed Lp(a) levels.
For UK Biobank, we generated an LPA gene variant score in units of SD Lp(a) by 
multiplying each variant by its effect on Lp(a) levels. We then included this gene variant 
score in a logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, 10 principal components of 
ancestry, and a dummy variable for array type. For the summary-level data, this approach 
was equivalent to an inverse-variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of the effect of 
each variant on a trait or outcome of interest, divided by the effect of each variant on Lp(a) 
levels (27).
For our primary outcomes (the 9 cardiometabolic diseases), we set a Bonferroni-adjusted 
level of significance of p = 0.05/9 = 0.0056. For our secondary analysis of cardiometabolic 
traits, which included 15 traits, we set a level of significance of p = 0.05/15 = 0.003. For our 
phenome-wide association study of 28 phenotypes, we set a level of significance of p = 
0.05/28 = 0.0018.
LOSS OF FUNCTION VARIANT ANALYSIS
To examine whether loss-of-function variants in the LPA gene influence CHD risk, we used 
whole exome sequencing data from the MIGen Consortium (Online Supplement). This 
consortium is composed of 10 coronary artery disease case-control studies (28, 29). Loss-of-
function variants were defined as: 1) nonsense mutations that resulted in early termination of 
the apolipoprotein(a) protein; 2) frameshift mutations due to insertions or deletions of DNA; 
or 3) splice-site mutations that resulted in an incorrectly spliced protein. We combined these 
loss-of-function variants in the MIGen consortium with loss-of-function variants that were 
genotyped (either directly or imputed) in the UK Biobank. Variants are provided in Online 
Tables 5 and 6. We analyzed rare variants (<1%) separately to a common loss-of-function 
variant in the LPA gene (rs41272114, allele frequency of 3.8% in UK Biobank) (30, 31).
We tested for the association of CHD with presence of a loss-of-function variant using 
logistic regression. In MIGen, we adjusted for sex, 5 principal components of ancestry, and a 
dummy variable for each cohort. We did not adjust for age in MIGen as cases in some 
cohorts were selected for early-onset myocardial infarction, resulting in age being 
significantly and inversely associated with the presence of CHD. In the UK Biobank, we 
adjusted for age, sex, 10 principal components of ancestry, and array type.
All analyses were performed using R version 3.2.3 software (The R Project for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria).

 RESULTS
We first estimated the effect of LPA gene variant score on plasma Lp(a) levels in ARIC 
participants. Variants rs3798220 and rs10455872 altered Lp(a) levels by 0.98 and 0.91 SD, 
respectively, while rs41272114 and rs143431368 altered Lp(a) levels by 0.62 SD and 0.92 
SD respectively (Online Table 4). In this study, 1 SD in Lp(a) levels equaled 0.332 μmol/l. 
The distribution of LPA gene variant score in the UK Biobank is provided (Online Table 6).
We examined the effect of genetically lowered Lp(a) on 9 different cardiometabolic diseases 
(Central Illustration). Genetically lowered lipoprotein(a), a 1 SD genetic decrease, was 
associated with 29% lower risk of CHD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.69 to 0.73; p = 3.2*10−90). Genetically lowered Lp(a) had similar strengths of 
association with CHD across subpopulations (Online Figure 1). Beyond CHD, genetically 
lowered Lp(a) was associated with 31% lower risk of PVD (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.80; 
p = 1.9 × 10−6), 13% lower risk of stroke (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.96; p = 0.004), 37% 
lower risk of aortic stenosis (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.83; p = 0.0011), and 17% lower 
risk of HF (OR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.94; p = 0.0045; Central Illustration). While 
genetically lowered Lp(a) levels were only nominally associated with a 9% lower risk of 
CKD (OR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.00; p = 0.043), it was highly significantly associated 
with the underlying quantitative trait (eGFR) as described later. Genetically lowered Lp(a) 
was not associated with diabetes, venous thromboembolism, or atrial fibrillation. To examine 
if the association of genetically lowered Lp(a) with HF and aortic stenosis was mediated by 
CHD, we excluded participants with CHD in the UK Biobank (n = 4,461). After exclusion, a 
1 SD genetic decrease in Lp(a) levels had similar strengths of association with HF (OR: 
0.84; 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.07; n = 107,877) and aortic stenosis (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.49 to 
0.99; n = 107,877). A sensitivity analysis excluding those with prevalent aortic stenosis (n = 
193) yielded a similar strength of association for the association between a 1 SD decrease in 
Lp(a) levels and HF (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.02; n = 112,145).
In contrast to the effects of Lp(a) on cardiometabolic disorders, we found no association of 
genetically lowered Lp(a) with any of 28 different disorders, including 4 gastrointestinal 
disorders, 3 endocrine disorders, 2 renal/urological disorders, 3 psychiatric disorders, 4 
musculoskeletal disorders, 4 respiratory disorders, and 8 different cancers (all p > 0.01) 
(Figure 2).
We next estimated the effect of LPA gene variant score on 15 quantitative traits (Figure 3). 
We observed a significant association of genetically lowered Lp(a) with improved kidney 
function: a 0.04 SD (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.05) increase in eGFR per SD genetically lowered 
Lp(a) (p = 1.4 × 10−5). This corresponds to an approximate 2.0 ml/min increase in eGFR per 
SD lower Lp(a). As expected, a 1 SD genetically lowered Lp(a) was associated with total 
cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (0.14 SD decrease in total cholesterol [95% CI: 0.11 to 
0.16; p = 3.5 × 10−27) and a 0.14 SD decrease in LDL cholesterol (95% CI: 0.11 to 0.16; p = 
4.7 × 10−27) (Figure 3). These estimates correspond, approximately, to a 0.14 mmol/l 
decrease in total cholesterol and a 0.13 mmol/l decrease in LDL cholesterol. We saw no 
significant association of LPA genetic risk score with waist-to-hip ratio, waist 
circumference, hip circumference, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood

 pressure, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 2-h glucose, or 
glycosylated hemoglobin (p > 0.05 for each). LPA gene variant risk score remained 
unassociated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure when use of antihypertensive therapy 
was not accounted for (0 SD, 95% CI: −0.02 to 0.01 and 0 SD, 95% CI: −0.01 to 0.02 per 
SD lower Lp[a], respectively).
Figure 4 provides a dose-response curve for CHD derived from gain and loss-of-function 
variants at the LPA gene locus. The impact of LPA variation on CHD risk is directly 
proportional to its effect on circulating Lp(a) levels. The Lp(a)-increasing alleles of common 
variants rs3798220 and rs10455872, which increase Lp(a) levels by 0.98 and 0.91 SD, 
increased risk of CHD by 57% (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.46 to 1.69) and 38% (OR: 1.38; 95% 
CI: 1.33 to 1.43), respectively. Rare synonymous variants, which had no significant effect on 
Lp(a) levels, also had no significant effect on CHD (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.12) (Figure 
4). A common loss-of-function variant rs41272114, which decreased Lp(a) levels by 0.62 
SD, was associated with a 12% lower risk of CHD (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.93; p = 3.4 
× 10−7). Presence of a rare (allele frequency <1%) loss-of-function variant in the LPA gene 
was associated with a 24% lower risk of CHD (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.98; p = 0.033) 
(Figure 4; Online Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
To evaluate the phenotypic consequences of genetically lowered Lp(a), we leveraged: 1) 4 
DNA sequence variants that alter plasma Lp(a); 2) individual-level genotype and phenotype 
data from >100,000 participants in UK Biobank; 3) summary genetic association results 
from 7 large-scale GWAS; and 4) LPA gene sequences in >15,000 participants. We found 
that 1 SD genetically lowered Lp(a) is associated with a range of atherosclerosis-related 
diseases including CHD, PVD, stroke, HF, and aortic stenosis, but was not associated with 
31 other different diseases in a phenome-wide association study.
These data allowed for several conclusions. First, using naturally occurring DNA sequence 
variation, we provided a dose-response relationship between perturbation of Lp(a) and risk 
for CHD. We examined the effects of both common and rare variants, as well as gain-of-
function variants that increase Lp(a) levels and loss-of-function variants that decrease Lp(a) 
levels. The effects of these different variants on CHD were consistently proportional to their 
effect on Lp(a). Consistent with 2 recent reports (30, 32), a low-frequency loss-of-function 
variant (rs41272114) and a burden of rare loss-of-function variants in LPA protected against 
CHD. In combination, these results suggested that greater pharmacological reductions in 
Lp(a) levels should produce proportionally greater reductions in CHD risk, thus supporting 
intensive Lp(a) lowering.
Second, these results suggested that Lp(a) inhibition may be a viable therapeutic strategy to 
prevent a range of diseases beyond CHD. This study extends prior work demonstrating LPA 
variants to be associated with cardiovascular disease (5, 6, 11, 12, 33, 34). In a study of up to 
12,716 individuals from 35 case-control studies, LPA variants were associated with 
peripheral arterial disease, ischemic stroke, and coronary artery disease (11). In contrast, in 
an analysis of 14,465 individuals in the Heart Protection Study, LPA variants were

 associated with PVD but not stroke (12). Our results suggested that LPA variants are 
associated with PVD, stroke, and HF. Furthermore, our report of a significant association 
with aortic stenosis are consistent with recent analyses demonstrating a significant effect of 
LPA variants on aortic valve calcification and stenosis (9, 10). Inclusion of these diseases in 
composite endpoints of trials of Lp(a)-reducing therapies (in addition to CHD) may increase 
the likelihood of a positive trial outcome, highlighting the potential benefits of genetic 
analyses for trial design and clinical drug development.
Third, a surprising finding of this study was that genetically lowered Lp(a) was associated 
with a modest but significant improvement in kidney function as assessed by 2 phenotypes, 
eGFR and prevalence of CKD. This lower risk of CKD may be mediated through a reduction 
in renal atherosclerotic burden. These findings are consistent with a recent GWAS of 
metabolites that revealed a strong association between LPA rs10455872 and creatinine levels 
(35). These results implicate Lp(a) metabolism in the development of CKD.
STUDY LIMITATIONS
This study’s major strength was the scale and variety of data sources, which improved our 
power to detect an effect of genetically lowered Lp(a) on a wide range of diseases and 
cardiometabolic traits. Our use of the largest available cohorts provided requisite power to 
demonstrate that genetic Lp(a) lowering was associated with a lower risk of PVD, stroke, 
HF, and CKD while our use of the UK Biobank allowed us to examine the association of 
genetic LPA variants across a wide range of noncardiovascular diseases, for which we failed 
to find an association.
Several study limitations deserve mention. First, our use of a 2-sample design, with exposure 
estimates from ARIC and outcome estimates from UK Biobank and various GWAS, 
prevented us from examining whether the effect of LPA variants differed by baseline levels 
of Lp(a). Second, our phenome-wide association study might have been underpowered to 
detect a significant effect of Lp(a) on many of the outcomes. As the UK Biobank develops 
validated phenotypes and accumulates a greater number of events, a phenome-wide 
association study may be better powered to detect an effect on different disorders. Third, we 
used prevalent events based on a verbal interview with a nurse for our phenome-wide 
association study of 28 different disorders. Although these events are likely to be of greater 
specificity than coded hospitalization data, they have not been independently validated. 
Finally, our population was limited to individuals of European ancestry and our results may 
not be generalizable to individuals of different ancestry. Indeed, both Lp(a) levels and the 
number of Kringle IV domains in Lp(a) have been shown to vary substantially with ancestry, 
suggesting that the impact of Lp(a) on cardiovascular disease may also differ by ancestry 
(36).
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, genetically decreased lipoprotein(a) is associated with a range of 
cardiometabolic disorders, including CHD, stroke, PVD, aortic stenosis, HF, and renal 
dysfunction. Pharmacological lowering of Lp(a) may reduce the risk of these disorders.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE
Elevated blood levels of Lp(a) have been associated with the risk of developing coronary 
artery disease, stroke, PVD, aortic stenosis, HF, and CKD but are not associated with the 
risk of developing type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, or specific cancers.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK
Further research should be conducted to determine whether more intensive lowering of 
lP(a) levels results in proportionally greater reductions in cardiovascular risk.

 FIGURE 2. Associations of Genetically Lowered Lp(a) With a Range of Diseases
While 1 SD genetically lowered Lp(a) level was significantly associated with reduced risk of 
coronary heart disease, stroke, aortic stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and 
peripheral vascular disease, there was no significant association seen for 3 other 
cardiometabolic disorders as well as 28 other diseases. COPD = chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease; OR = odds ratio; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

 FIGURE 3. Association of Genetically Lowered Lp(a) (1 SD Decrease) with Cardiometabolic 
Quantitative Traits
Genetically lowered Lp(a) was associated with reductions in total and low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as improved kidney function. There were no other 
significant associations seen between 1 SD decrease in Lp(a) and other traits measured. BMI 
= body mass index; DBP = diastolic blood pressure; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration 
rate; HbA1c = glycosylated hemoglobin; HDL = high-density lipoprotein; SBP = systolic 
blood pressure; SNP = single nucleotide polymorphism; other abbreviations as in Figures 1

 FIGURE 4. Effect of LPA Variants on Lp(a) and CHD
Logistic regression was used to test the association of coronary heart disease (CHD) as an 
outcome and DNA sequence variant as a predictor, adjusting for sex and principal 
components of ancestry, with additional adjustment for array type and age in UK Biobank. 
The impact of LPA variation on CHD risk is directly proportional to its effect on circulating 
Lp(a) levels. Abbreviations as in Figure 1.

Disease Risk
This study to establish the full phenotypic impact of LPA gene variation and to estimate a 
dose-response curve between genetically altered plasma lipoprotein (Lp) (a) and risk for 
coronary heart disease. Estimates were derived in UK Biobank using logistic regression, 
adjusted for age, sex, 10 principal components and array type, with the exception of chronic 
kidney disease (CKD), which was derived using summary statistics from CKDGen. One SD 
genetically lowered Lp(a) level was associated with reduced risk of 5 cardiometabolic 
diseases. Although the estimate for CKD did not reach Bonferroni adjusted significance, it
