IMPORTANCE Most younger adults who experience an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are
sexually active before the AMI, but little is known about sexual activity or sexual function
after the event.
OBJECTIVE To describe patterns of sexual activity and function and identify indicators of the
probability of loss of sexual activity in the year after AMI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from the prospective, multicenter, longitudinal
Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients study (conducted
from August 21, 2008, to January 5, 2012) were assessed at baseline, 1 month, and 1 year.
Participants were from US (n = 103) and Spanish (n = 24) hospitals and completed baseline
and all follow-up interviews. Data analysis for the present study was conducted from October
15, 2014, to June 6, 2016. Characteristics associated with loss of sexual activity were assessed
using multinomial logistic regression analyses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Loss of sexual activity after AMI.
RESULTS Of the 2802 patients included in the analysis, 1889 were women (67.4%); median
(25th-75th percentile) age was 49 (44-52) years (range, 18-55 years). At all time points, 637
(40.4%) of women and 437 (54.9%) of men were sexually active. Among people who were
active at baseline, men were more likely than women to have resumed sexual activity by
1 month (448 [63.9%] vs 661 [54.5%]; P < .001) and by 1 year (662 [94.4%] vs 1107 [91.3%];
P = .01) after AMI. Among people who were sexually active before and after AMI, women
were less likely than men to report no sexual function problems in the year after the event
(466 [40.3%] vs 382 [54.8%]; P < .01). In addition, more women than men (211 [41.9%] vs
107 [30.5%]; P < .01) with no baseline sexual problems developed 1 or more incident
problems in the year after the AMI. At 1 year, the most prevalent sexual problems were lack
of interest (487 [39.6%]) and trouble lubricating (273 [22.3%]) among women and erectile
difficulties (156 [21.7%]) and lack of interest (137 [18.8%]) among men. Those who had not
communicated with a physician about sex in the first month after AMI were more likely to
delay resuming sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.05; P = .008). Higher
stress levels (AOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01-1.83) and having diabetes (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.15-3.13)
were significant indicators of the probability of loss of sexual activity in the year after the AMI.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Impaired sexual activity and incident sexual function
problems were prevalent and more common among young women than men in the year after
AMI. Attention to modifiable risk factors and physician counseling may improve outcomes.

early 20% of acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) oc-
cur among people aged 18 to 55 years, one-third of
whom are women.1 The Variation in Recovery: Role of
Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO) study, a
multicenter, prospective, longitudinal study of US and Span-
ish patients in this age group, was designed to investigate dif-
ferences between women and men in trajectories of func-
tional recovery, including sexual activity and function, in the
year after an AMI. In a 1-month outcome study from VIRGO2
and in another study including older AMI patients,3 most sur-
vivors were sexually active in the year before their event and
many (40% of women, >55% of men) resumed sexual activity
in the following year. We have also found that patients of all
ages with AMI value their sexual function and want to know
what level of function to expect during recovery from an
AMI.2-4 Accordingly, US5,6 and European7 AMI guidelines rec-
ommend that physicians counsel patients about resuming sex
after AMI. However, little is known about patterns of sexual
recoveryorsexualproblemsafterAMI,particularlyforyounger
patients.
To inform patient counseling and expectations about
sexual recovery, we describe, for what we believe to be the first
time, patterns of and gender differences in sexual activity and
problems among younger patients in the year after an AMI.
Prior studies2,3 showed that women were less likely than men
to receive counseling about sex after an AMI, and demon-
strated the importance of counseling for resumption of sexual
activity.Extendingthesefindings,wehypothesizedthat,inthe
year after AMI, (1) women would be more likely than men to
resume sexual activity late or not at all and (2) women would
be more likely than men to report sexual problems. We also
examined predictors of loss of sexual activity in the year fol-
lowing AMI to determine potentially modifiable factors.
Methods
Participants and Study Design
The VIRGO study has been previously described (clinicaltrials
.gov Identifier: NCT00597922).8 Briefly, hospitalized pa-
tients aged 18 to 55 years with AMI were recruited between
August 21, 2008, and January 5, 2012, to participate in VIRGO
(named Infarto de miocardio en la Mujer JOVEN IM-JOVEN]
in Spain to reflect separate public funding). The US study in-
cluded 2985 participants (2009 women [67.3%]) enrolled at
baseline at 103 sites; the Spain study included 516 partici-
pants (340 women [65.9%]) enrolled at baseline at 24 sites. Eli-
giblepatientshadincreasedcardiacbiomarkers(preferablytro-
ponin), with at least 1 biomarker above the 99th percentile of
the upper reference limit within 24 hours of admission. Ad-
ditional evidence of acute ischemia was required, including at
least 1 of the following: ischemia symptoms, electrocardio-
gram changes indicative of new ischemia (new ST-segment or
T-wave changes, new or presumably new left bundle branch
block, or the development of pathologic Q waves). Patients
musthavepresenteddirectlytotheenrollingsiteorbeentrans-
ferred within 24 hours of presentation to ensure that primary
clinical decision making occurred at the enrolling site. Pa-
tients who were incarcerated, did not speak English or Span-
ish, were unable to provide informed consent or be contacted
for follow-up, developed elevated cardiac markers because of
elective coronary revascularization, or had an AMI resulting
from physical trauma were excluded. The overall participa-
tion rate was 64.6% among 5422 individuals meeting the eli-
gibility criteria (VIRGO, 2985 [61.7%]; and IM-JOVEN, 516
[88.2%]). The study sample was limited to 2802 VIRGO par-
ticipants with data at baseline, 1 month, and 1 year (Figure 1).
Institutional review board approval was obtained at each par-
ticipating institution; patients provided written informed con-
sent to participate and received financial compensation. The

Data Collection
A detailed description of measures, including derived and cal-
culated variables, is provided in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was evaluated at baseline and
1 year to assess stress; a higher score (range 0-34) indicates a
greater likelihood that perceived stressors were beyond one’s
coping mechanisms.9 The 9-item Patient Health Question-
naire (PHQ-9) was evaluated at baseline and 1 year to assess
depressive symptoms; a score of 10 or higher indicates depres-
sive symptoms.10 Elements of the Global Registry of Acute
Coronary Events (GRACE) Risk Score (age, heart rate, systolic
blood pressure, initial creatinine level, congestive heart fail-
ure, ST-segment deviation, previous AMI, percutaneous coro-
nary intervention, and cardiac enzyme levels) were prospec-
tively collected from the medical record at baseline and used
to predict 6-month mortality in survivors of acute coronary
syndrome;ahigherGRACEriskscoreindicatesincreasedrisk.11
The 12-item Short-Form Health Survey Physical Composite
Score (SF-12 PCS) was evaluated at baseline and 1 year to as-
sess physical function during the 4 weeks before administra-
tion of the scale; a higher score indicates better function.12
Interviewers elicited demographic, psychosocial, and
health characteristics at baseline, 1 month, and 1 year. Self-
reported race information was obtained on enrollment, and
race was analyzed as a potential indicator of sexual out-
comes. Baseline interviews were conducted in person during
the index hospitalization; follow-up interviews were con-
ducted via telephone. Sexuality characteristics were mea-
sured using items adapted from prior large-scale, interviewer-
Key Points
Question For younger people who have an acute myocardial
infarction (AMI), what factors determine resumption of sexual
activity in the following year?
Findings This longitudinal study of 2802 individuals in the
United States and Spain found that patients who did not report
a discussion with their physician about sex in the month after AMI
were significantly more likely to delay resumption. Higher stress
levels and diabetes were significant determinants of loss of sexual
activity in the year after AMI.
Meaning Attention to modifiable risk factors and physician
counseling may improve sexual outcomes after AMI.

administered studies of adult sexuality.2,3,13,14 As in those prior
studies, sexual activity was defined as “any mutually volun-
tary activity with another person that involves sexual con-
tact, whether or not intercourse or orgasm occurs.” Refusal/
missing rates for sexual activity, importance, frequency,
function, and communication items were 0.2% to 8.6%; re-
fusal/missing rates for attitudinal items (fear, interest in emo-
tional closeness, initiation of sex, and sexual satisfaction) were
0.7% to 12.0%.
Statistical Analysis
This analysis used baseline, 1-month, and 1-year data; 2802
participants (80.0%) completed both 1-month and 1-year
follow-up interviews (Figure 1). Descriptive, bivariate analy-
ses were used to compare differences between women and
men (the terms female and male are also used to indicate gen-
der) in baseline and 1-year post-AMI demographic, psychoso-
cial, and health characteristics; 1-year post-AMI sexual activ-
ity, sexual function, and importance; and communication
with a physician about sex since the AMI. Country-level com-
parisons were also made. Categorical data are presented as
frequencies and percentages. Differences between women
and men as well as countries were compared using 2-sided χ2
or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Comparisons of physi-
cian recommendations about sex between 1 month and the
interval between 1 month and 1 year were also made using
the McNemar test to take into account the correlations
between these 2 time points. Continuous variables are
reported as mean (SD) or median, and 25th to 75th percentile
differences were compared using unpaired t tests and Wil-
coxon rank sum tests. Patterns of partnership, sexual activity,
patient-physician communication about sexual activity, and
sexual problems over time were summarized overall and
separately by women vs men.
Among individuals who were sexually active before the
AMI, loss of sexual activity was classified into 4 groups (eTable
2 in the Supplement). Group 1 (early resumers) included re-
spondents who were sexually active in the 12 months before
the AMI and at both 1 month and 1 year after the AMI. Group 2
(early resumers with later loss) were respondents who were
sexually active in the 12 months before the AMI, had resumed
sexual activity by 1 month after the AMI, but did not report
sexual activity at 1 year after the AMI. Group 3 (late resumers)
had been sexually active in the 12 months before the AMI and
had not resumed sexual activity by 1 month after the AMI but
reportedsexualactivityat1year.Group4(neverresumers)con-
sistedofrespondentswhoweresexuallyactiveinthe12months
before the AMI but did not resume sexual activity at any time
in the year following the AMI.
Bivariate analysis was first used to compare differences
across these 4 groups. To further explore differences be-
tweenwomenandmen,multinomiallogisticmodelswerebuilt
and tested sequentially to assess how the effect of women vs
men was attenuated and identify indicators of the probabil-
ity of loss of sexual activity in the year after the AMI. Group 1
(early resumers) was the reference group; group 2 was ex-
cluded owing to the small sample size. The model covariates
(eTable 1 in the Supplement) were selected based on clinical
judgment and their association with the outcome in prior stud-
ies: gender (subjectively assessed, coded as female or male),
age, country, partnership status, race, depression, stress, self-
reported physical function, hypertension, diabetes, presence
of at least 1 sexual problem, communication with a physician
at 1 month after the AMI, and fearful of another AMI at 1 year
after the AMI.
Initially, 8 models were tested using these covariates. Data
from 5 models are presented in eTable 3 in the Supplement;
3 models are presented here: (1) model 1 included gender only;

(2) model 2 included gender and country plus baseline demo-
graphic, psychosocial, and health characteristics; communi-
cation with a physician about sexual activity at 1 month; pres-
ence of at least 1 sexual problem at baseline; and fearful of
another AMI at 1 year; and (3) model 3 included all of the co-
variates included in model 2 as well as 2 interactions: gender
(female or male) by partnership status and age by country. All
interactionswithgenderandinteractionsbetweencountryand
age, partnership status, and communication with physician at
1 month after the AMI, between communication with physi-
cian at 1 month after the AMI and fearful of another AMI at
1 year after the AMI were tested, and nonsignificant interac-
tions were removed from the final model (model 3). To aid in
interpretation of the model results, adjusted predicted prob-
abilities of early resumers, late resumers, and never resumers
were generated from model 3 for partnered/unpartnered
women and partnered/unpartnered men with other continu-
ous covariates set to their mean and categorical variables set
to their reference except for race, which was held constant at
whiterace(eTable4intheSupplement).AgeneralizedHosmer-
Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for multinomial logistic re-
gression models was conducted.15
Comparing participants in the VIRGO study with non-
participants (those who completed screening but declined
further participation), participants were more likely to be
younger (median [25th-75th percentile] age, 48 [44-52] vs 49
[44-52] years), female (2397 [67.1%] vs 1156 [57.4%]), and
white (2852 [79.8%] vs 1493 [74.2%]). The age range in the
patients included in the analysis was 18 to 55 years. Compar-
ing persons in the analytic sample for this study (limited to
people who had baseline, 1-month, and 1-year data) with
those who were excluded from the analytic sample owing to
insufficient data, those in the analytic sample were more
likely to be older (median age, 48 [44-52] vs 47 [42-51]
years), white (2231 [79.6%] vs 511 [73.1%]), and partnered
(1691 [60.6%] vs 338 [48.4%]). The gender distribution was
similar between the analytic sample (female, 1889 [67.4%];
male, 913 [32.6%]) and the excluded population (female, 460
[65.8%]; male, 329 [34.2%]).
P values were 2-sided and not adjusted for multiple test-
ing. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc) or Stata, release 13 (StataCorp) and VIRGO data
version 1.0. Data analysis was performed from October 15,
2014, to June 6, 2016.

priate, 1-year demographic, psychosocial, and health charac-
teristics by gender and country. Almost half of the women
(892 [49.5%]) and 526 [60.3%] of the men were partnered at
all 3 time points (Figure 2A). Although the age distribution
was similar across gender and country groups, significantly
fewer women (1083 [57.5%] vs 608 men [67.0%] at baseline;
970 [53.3%] vs 569 men [64.4%] at 1 year) and US patients
(1392 [58.5%] vs 299 Spanish patients [73.3%] at baseline;
1221 [53.4%] vs 318 Spanish patients [76.6%] at 1 year) were
married or cohabiting (P < .001 for all comparisons) both at
baseline and 1 year. Similar to baseline, both in the United
States and Spain, women had higher rates of stress and
depression at 1 year and lower levels of physical functioning
compared with men.
Overall, most women and men (1255 [72.6%] vs 731
[85.2%]; P < .001) were sexually active 1 year after AMI
(Table 2); 637 women (40.4%) and 437 men (54.9%) were sexu-
ally active at all 3 time points (Figure 2B). Among the sub-
group of those who were sexually active at baseline, men were

e Inactivity was defined as less than 10 minutes total per week of moderate- or
vigorous-intensity activities; insufficient activity was defined as more than
10 minutes total per week of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activity but less
than the recommended level; and recommended physical activity was defined
as 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity, 75 minutes of
vigorous-intensity activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate and
vigorous activity.

more likely than women to have resumed sexual activity by
1 month (448 [63.9%] vs 661 [54.5%]; P < .001) and by 1 year
(662 [94.4%] vs 1107 [91.3%]; P = .01) after AMI. However, pa-
tients in the United States were less likely to be sexually ac-
tive at 1 year than were those in Spain (1630 [75.0%] vs 356
[86.0%]; P < .001). At 1 year, women were more likely to rate
sex as “not at all important” (472 [27.3%] vs 64 [7.5%] men;
P < .001).
In both countries, women were less likely to receive coun-
selingaboutresumingsexatanytimeintheyearafterAMI(425
[26.7%] vs 341 men [41.2%]; P < .001) (Figure 2C). Compared
with patients in the United States, Spanish patients were more
likely to report having these discussions with a physician
(123 [29.9%] vs 474 [22.1%]; P < .001) and that a physician ini-
tiated these discussions (49 [41.2%] vs 100 [20.1%]; P < .001).
The recommendation to limit sex (34 [20.7%] vs 18 [11.0%];
P = .01),keepheartratedown(27[16.5%]vs16[9.8%];P = .04),
andtakeamorepassiverole(39[23.9%]vs18[11.0%];P = .002)
were more commonly reported at 1 month than for the inter-
val between 1 month and 1 year; the recommendation to re-
sumesexwithoutlimitationswaslessfrequentat1monththan
for the interval between 1 month and 1 year (71 [43.3%] vs 93
[56.7%]; P = .02).
Among people who were sexually active before and after
AMI, women were less likely than men to report no sexual
function problems in the year after the event (466 [40.3%]
vs 382 [54.8%]; P < .01). Among participants who were sexu-
ally active in the 11 months following their 1-month inter-
view, most women (727 [59.4%]) and approximately half
of the men (327 [45.7%]) reported at least 1 sexual problem.
Of sexually active patients with no sexual problems at base-
line, 318 (37.0%) developed 1 or more incident sexual prob-
lems in the year after the AMI (Figure 2D). The most preva-
lent sexual problems among women at 1 year were lack of

Changes in categorical variables across the partnership (A), sexual activity (B),
patient-physician communication about sex (C), and sexual problems (D) over
time. The black dashed lines running across the bars allow the reader to follow
the same group of individuals over time, for example, participants who were
partnered (A) at baseline (blue) vs those who were not partnered at baseline
(orange). The numbers below each bar graph provide the marginal distribution
of a variable at each time point; this information can be inferred from the bar
graph by summing the proportions indicated by each section of the bar of the
same color. For example, most individuals who were unpartnered (A) at
baseline were unpartnered over the course of the year following acute
myocardial infarction. Most of those who were partnered at baseline stayed
partnered across time, although there was more movement in this group.

interest (487 [39.5%]), trouble lubricating (273 [22.3%]), and
difficulty breathing during intercourse (239 [19.5%]); the
most prevalent problems among men were erectile difficul-
ties (156 [21.7%]), lack of interest (137 [18.8%]), and feelings
of anxiety about their sexual performance (113 [15.7%]). Few
men (19 [2.9%] in the United States and 2 [1.4%] in Spain)
reported use of medications to treat erectile dysfunction at
baseline, 1 month, or 1 year after AMI.
Comparisons of the characteristics of the 4 resumption
groups are provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement. In unad-
justed, multinomial, logistic regression analyses of loss of
sexualactivityintheyearfollowinganAMI,womenweremore
likely to delay resuming sex (by 1 year rather than by 1 month
or to be a late resumer) compared with men (odds ratio [OR],
1.45; 95% CI, 1.15-1.81; P = .001); this finding persisted even af-
tercontrollingforotherdemographic,psychosocial,health,and
sexual characteristics (Table 3 and additional models in eTable
3 in the Supplement). However, a significant gender by part-
nership status interaction was found (P = .003): partnered
women were more likely than partnered men to resume sex
later (adjusted OR [AOR], 1.71; 95% CI, 1.29-2.25; P < .001), but
there was not a significant gender difference for unpartnered
individuals. Older age among this younger cohort was also sig-
nificantly associated with greater odds of being a late re-
sumer in the United States (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.67;
P = .005)butnotinSpain(AOR,0.75;95%CI,0.50-1.12;P = .16;
age by country interaction, P = .01). Overall, participants who
had not communicated with a physician in the first month af-
ter their AMI were also more likely to be late resumers (AOR,
1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.05; P = .008).
Among people who were sexually active in the year
before their AMI, women had higher odds of never resuming
sexual activity in the year following the AMI than men (OR,
1.62; 95% CI, 0.98-2.69), but this finding was not significant
after controlling for other demographic, psychosocial,
health, and sexual characteristics (AOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.76-
2.21) (Table 3). Older age, unpartnered status, higher stress
levels, and diabetes were all significant indicators of the
probability of never resuming sexual activity in the year fol-
lowing an AMI.
Discussion
Our findings, based on 2-country data from VIRGO, indicate
that most young women and men were partnered and sexu-
ally active in the year before and the year after an AMI. More
than half of women (727 [59.4%]) and just under half of men
(327 [45.7%]) had sexual function problems in the year after
AMI; women were more likely than men to develop incident

sexual function problems. Despite a high prevalence of sexual
function problems, particularly among women, few partici-
pantsreportedhavinganyconversationwithaphysicianabout
resuming sex after an AMI.
The proportions of patients who were partnered and sexu-
ally active at baseline were similar to those reported in popu-
lation-based studies of similarly aged people in the United
States16 and a slightly older population in Spain.17 In the first
month following AMI, 99 women (9.5%) and 37 men (6.3%) be-
came unpartnered and a slightly lower proportion remained
unpartnered at 1 year (75 women [7.2%]; 23 men [3.9%]). Prior
studies18,19 have shown that a person’s spouse or intimate part-
ner is an important social relationship for recovery or protec-
tion from illness and that lower levels of social support are as-
sociated with poorer AMI outcomes.20 Cardiac care providers
should be aware that loss of a partner after AMI may impair
the patient’s overall recovery and may require additional psy-
chosocial support.
There was a significant decrease in sexual activity at
1 month after AMI compared with baseline, followed by a sig-
nificant increase between 1 month and 1 year for both women
and men. Although most people with AMI were sexually ac-
tive by 1 year following the event, approximately 1 in 15 women
(110 [6.7%]) and 1 in 20 men (39 [4.9%]) never resumed sexual
activity during that time. In an earlier study3 by our group of
an older US cohort of 1879 patients with AMI (mean [SD] age,
59.4 [11.7] years), 11% of women and 13% of men had not re-
sumed sexual activity by 1 year. Combining these findings with

thoseofthepresentstudy,womenwithAMIandmenwithAMI
older than 60 years can be informed that approximately 90%
of patients resume sexual activity by 1 year after an AMI. Men
younger than 60 years can expect a 95% resumption rate by
1 year after an AMI. Among partnered people, women re-
sumed sexual activity later than men. Unpartnered people re-
sumed sexual activity later than did those with a partner. Over-
all, most patients had resumed sexual activity by 1 month.
Patterns were similar in the United States and Spain.
Sexual function problems were prevalent before and af-
ter AMI in this cohort and generally higher than rates re-
ported for the same age general population in the United
States13 (we did not find comparable population-based data
fromSpain).Alargeproportionofwomen(211[41.9%])andmen
(107 [30.5%]) with no baseline sexual problems developed
1 or more incident sexual problems in the year after their AMI
(P < .01). The rate of loss of sexual function after AMI was on
a par with the loss of general physical function in this cohort
(459 [46.1%] of people with the recommended level of physi-
cal activity at baseline had insufficient activity or inactivity at
1 year) and was several-fold higher than the incidence of de-
pression after AMI (171 [9.8%]). Although it is important to ad-
vise patients that sexual problems may arise after AMI (most
commonly lack of interest for women and erectile difficulties
for men), cardiac care clinicians can give hope by communi-
cating that 40% of women and 55% of men have no sexual
function problems in the year after AMI and that nearly one-
third of patients with problems in the year before AMI re-
ported none in the year after.
Our group’s prior studies2,3 in the United States and Spain
have shown that communication with a physician is a signifi-
cant indicator of the probability of sexual activity after an AMI.
Asexpected,communicationratesat1yearwerehigherforboth
women and men than those reported at 1 month but were still
low. Spanish patients were more likely to report having these
discussions and that a physician initiated the discussions. The
nature of physician counseling changed over time; physi-
cians in both countries were more cautious in their counsel-
ing in the 1 month following AMI compared with counseling
intheinterimbetweentheparticipants'1-monthinterviewand
their 12-month interview.
The present study shows that counseling was a signifi-
cant indicator of time to resumption (early vs late), but stress
and diabetes more strongly indicated the probability of never
resuming sexual activity. These health conditions are known
to have deleterious effects on overall outcomes after AMI21 as
well as on female and male sexual function.13,21 Counseling pa-
tients that these conditions are associated with poorer sexual
function outcomes might help to motivate adherence to car-
diac rehabilitation, lifestyle changes, and other secondary pre-
vention activities.
The findings should be interpreted in the context of sev-
eral potential limitations. This study relied on patient self-
report, which may have introduced recall bias. In our prior
study,3 recall of discharge instructions about resuming sexual
activity, compared with documentation in the medical rec-
ords, did not differ by gender or sexual activity in the year fol-
lowing the AMI. Statistically significant differences in demo-
graphiccharacteristicswerefoundbetweenVIRGOparticipants
and nonparticipants and between those in our analytic sample
and those excluded from the sample, but the differences were
small. Given the importance of gender in our analyses, it is re-
assuring that the distribution of gender was similar between
the analytic sample and those who were excluded because of
insufficient data. Nevertheless, a higher proportion of part-
neredpeopleintheanalyticsamplecouldproduceupwardbias
on the sexual activity and sexual problem estimates. Al-
though partner factors can affect resumption of sexual activ-
ity after AMI,4 partner data were not collected. This study did
notcollectqualitativedata.However,priorqualitativeresearch4
corroborates that sexual problems after AMI are prevalent, fear
could inhibit resumption, and patients want to be counseled
about sex after AMI by their physician. Finally, a larger sample
size and additional data would be needed to stratify by sexual
orientation or identity as well as the partner’s gender and to
model the effects on sexual outcomes of specific comorbidi-
ties, medications, procedures, tests, and effects of rehabilita-
tion, prolonged or rehospitalization, or a subsequent AMI or
other health event. Understanding the effect of these factors
on sexual outcomes could allow for more-tailored counseling
according to individual risk for loss of sexual activity or func-
tion after AMI.
Conclusions
Patients want to know what level of sexual function to expect
during recovery from AMI. Our findings can be used to ex-
pand counseling and care guidelines5-7 to include recommen-
dationsforadvisingpatientsonwhattoexpectintermsofpost-
AMI sexual activity and function. Attention to modifiable risk
factors and improved physician counseling may be impor-
tant levers for improving sexual function outcomes for young
women and men after AMI.
