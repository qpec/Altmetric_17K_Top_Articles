Abstract The FDA approved drug rapamycin increases lifespan in rodents and delays age-
related dysfunction in rodents and humans. Nevertheless, important questions remain regarding
the optimal dose, duration, and mechanisms of action in the context of healthy aging. Here we
show that 3 months of rapamycin treatment is sufficient to increase life expectancy by up to 60%
and improve measures of healthspan in middle-aged mice. This transient treatment is also
associated with a remodeling of the microbiome, including dramatically increased prevalence of
segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine. We also define a dose in female mice that
does not extend lifespan, but is associated with a striking shift in cancer prevalence toward
aggressive hematopoietic cancers and away from non-hematopoietic malignancies. These data
suggest that a short-term rapamycin treatment late in life has persistent effects that can robustly
delay aging, influence cancer prevalence, and modulate the microbiome.

Introduction
Successful interventions that increase healthy longevity in people could have profound benefits for
quality of life, productivity, and reduced healthcare costs (Goldman et al., 2013; Kaeberlein et al.,
2015). The drug rapamycin is a promising candidate for such an intervention, as it has been shown
to increase lifespan in numerous species (Johnson et al., 2013) and to delay or reverse multiple
age-associated

cence (Chen et al., 2009), and cancer (Anisimov et al., 2011). Recently, a six week treatment with
the rapamycin derivative RAD001 was reported to improve immune function in elderly people, as
measured by response to influenza vaccine (Mannick et al., 2014), suggesting that at least some of
the effects on aging in mice are conserved in humans. Despite these impressive results, the utility of
rapamycin or other mTOR inhibitors to delay aging may be limited by side effects. The high doses of

 rapamycin and its derivatives used clinically to prevent organ transplant rejection are associated with
adverse events, including impaired wound healing, edema, elevated circulating triglycerides,
impaired glucose homeostasis, gastrointestinal discomfort, and mouth ulcers (Augustine et al.,
2007; de Oliveira et al., 2011). While many of these side effects have not been observed in mice at
the lower doses that extend lifespan, chronic treatment with encapsulated rapamycin (eRapa) in the
diet at 14 ppm has been reported to cause gonadal degeneration in males, increased risk of cata-
racts, and impaired response to a glucose tolerance test (Wilkinson et al., 2012; Lamming et al.,
2012).
Results
Based on the premise that transient treatment with rapamycin during middle-age might be more
suitable for clinical efforts to promote healthy aging than continuous treatment throughout life, we
set out to investigate whether a single three-month treatment regimen can extend lifespan and
healthspan in C57BL/6JNia mice starting at 20–21 months of age. We initially used a treatment regi-
men consisting of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 8 mg/kg rapamycin daily for 90 days. This dose
was selected because we have previously found that it increases survival and alleviates disease phe-
notypes in short-lived mouse models of dilated cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy, and the severe
mitochondrial disease Leigh Syndrome (Ramos et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2013). Based on effi-
cacy in the Leigh Syndrome mouse model and serum drug levels in wild type mice, we estimate that
this treatment regimen is comparable to dietary delivery of eRapa at approximately 378 ppm
(Johnson et al., 2015), or 27-fold higher levels than initially shown to extend lifespan in mice when
continuous treatment is initiated at either 9 months or 20 months of age (Harrison et al., 2009;
Miller et al., 2011). Because prior studies have noted differences in the magnitude of lifespan exten-
sion following continuous rapamycin treatment in male versus female animals (Harrison et al., 2009;
Miller et al., 2011, 2014), we examined the effect of this regimen in both sexes independently.
eLife digest Old age is the single greatest risk factor for many diseases including heart disease,
arthritis, cancer and dementia. By delaying the biological aging process, it may be possible to
reduce the impact of age-related diseases, which could have great benefits for society and the
quality of life of individuals. A drug called rapamycin, which is currently used to prevent organ
rejection in transplant recipients, is a leading candidate for targeting aging. Rapamycin increases
lifespan in several types of animals and delays the onset of many age-related conditions in mice.
Nearly all of the aging-related studies in mice have used the same dose of rapamycin given
throughout the lives of the animals. Lifelong treatment with rapamycin wouldn’t be practical in
humans and is likely to result in undesirable side effects. For example, the high doses of rapamycin
used in transplant patients cause side effects including poor wound healing, elevated blood
cholesterol levels, and mouth ulcers. Before rapamycin can be used to promote healthy aging in
humans, researchers must better understand at what point in life the drug is most effective, and
what dose to use to provide the biggest benefit while limiting the side effects.
Now, Bitto et al. show that treating mice with rapamycin for a short period during middle age
increases the life expectancy of the mice by up to 60%. In the experiments, mice were given two
different doses of rapamycin for only three months starting at 20 months old (equivalent to about
60-65 years old in humans). After receiving the lower dose, both male and female mice lived about
50% longer than untreated mice, and showed improvements in their muscle strength and motor
coordination. When given the higher dose, male mice showed an even greater increase in life
expectancy, but the female mice did not. These female mice had an increased risk of developing
rare and aggressive forms of blood cancer, but were protected from other types of cancer.
Both drug treatments also caused substantial changes in the gut bacteria of the male and female
mice, which could be related to effects of rapamycin on metabolism, immunity and health. More
studies are needed to uncover precisely how such short-term treatments can yield long-term
changes in the body, and how such changes are related to lifespan and healthy aging.

 intake remained similar during the treatment (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Decreased body
weight persisted for several weeks following cessation of treatment (Figure 1A). This was accompa-
nied by a striking increase in median life expectancy from the end of treatment of 60% (p=0.02,
Figure 1B, Table 1) and an increase in overall median lifespan from birth of 16% (p=0.03, Figure 1—
figure supplement 3, Table 2). This effect is larger than both the absolute and relative magnitude
of lifespan extension resulting from continuous treatment to death with 14 ppm eRapa starting at
around the same age in UMHET3 mice (Harrison et al., 2009). The longest-lived rapamycin-treated
male in our cohort survived for 710 days post treatment to approximately 1400 days of age. Based
on a survey of the literature, this is likely one of the longest-lived wild type C57BL/6 animals ever
reported.

 This rapamycin regimen also resulted in a decline in body weight of female mice together with an
increased trend of food intake in vehicle-treated animals with time (Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure
supplement 2); however, we failed to detect a similar increase in post-treatment survival and life-
span in females (p=0.261, Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Tables 1–2). Cox propor-
tional hazards regression with robust standard errors and adjusting for cohort indicated significant
evidence of a treatment difference between male and female mice (p=0.023). We speculated that
this lack of lifespan extension results from an increase in aggressive hematopoietic cancers in the
rapamycin treated females. Histopathological analysis showed that while 6/12 control females had
round cell tumors (lymphoma and histiocytic sarcoma of hematopoietic origins), comparable to pre-
vious studies in C57BL/6 mice (Blackwell et al., 1995; Treuting et al., 2008), all the rapamycin-
treated females examined (16 out of 16) had round cell tumors (Figure 3A,B and Figure 3—figure
supplement 1, p=0.002). Additionally, an uncommon variant of lymphoma with plasmacytoid mor-
phology affected 4 out of 16 mice examined in the rapamycin group and no vehicle treated mice
(Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B). Round cell tumors affected more organs in
rapamycin treated females, with multiple (�2) organs affected in all of the rapamycin treated females
compared to only 3 vehicle treated females (Figure 3C, p=0.01). Together, these data indicate a
more aggressive phenotype of hematopoietic tumors in the high dose rapamycin treated females. In
contrast, the incidence of non-hematopoietic neoplasms was dramatically decreased in the rapamy-
cin group (Figure 3D). Nine non-hematopoietic neoplasms (5 pituitary adenomas, and 2 pulmonary
adenomas, and 2 thyroid adenomas) were detected in 7 out of the 12 examined vehicle treated
mice; whereas, only 1 out of 16 rapamycin treated females had non-hematopoietic neoplasia (1 pitui-
tary adenoma) (Figure 3D, p=0.004).

 Both control and rapamycin treated male cohorts had a high incidence of systemic round cell neo-
plasia which affected �2 organs, and had an intravascular component and a morphology most con-
sistent with histiocytic sarcoma, although immunohistochemistry was not performed (Figure 3—
figure supplement 2). Several male mice also had eosinophilic (hyaline) protein droplets in the renal
tubules consistent with lysozyme accumulation associated with histiocytic sarcoma (Hard and Snow-
den, 1991). Of the examined vehicle treated males, all (14 out of 14) had hematopoietic neoplasia
affecting at least one organ. Additionally, 7 other types of neoplasia were detected on histopathol-
ogy from the vehicle treated male group, including 1 gastric neoplasia, 1 thyroid adenoma, and 5
pulmonary adenomas. One male mouse had a subcutaneous facial mass characterized by sheets of
round cells, most consistent with an extramedullary plasma cell tumor or mast cell tumor. Rapamycin
treated males also had a high incidence of systemic round cell neoplasia affecting at least one organ
(9 out of 13). In the rapamycin treated male group, 12 additional non-round cell tumors were
detected on histopathology, including 1 hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 intestinal adenomas, 1 splenic
hemangiosarcoma, 5 pulmonary adenomas, 1 pulmonary carcinoma, 1 thyroid adenoma, and 1 Zym-
bal’s gland adenoma (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). In the male group, no cases of systemic lym-
phoma with plasmacytoid morphology were seen. Although the number of mice examined is
relatively small, based on these observations we speculate that this regimen of rapamycin treatment
induced the detrimental side effect of aggressive hematopoietic cancers specifically in female mice,
which occurred earlier in life and were sufficient to prevent lifespan extension in these animals
despite other beneficial effects, such as reduced non-hematopoietic cancers. When data from both
sexes are pooled together, daily injection of 8 mg/kg rapamycin for three months resulted in a non-
significant (p=0.16) increase in life expectancy of 23% (Table 3). Between randomization and the
end of treatment, 5 male mice (3 vehicle, 2 rapamycin) died of non-age related causes and were
excluded from the analysis. Their inclusion in the analysis of survival does not significantly affect the
results as described above (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).
In order to assess whether transient treatment with a lower dose and different delivery of rapamy-
cin might reduce side effects in female mice and increase lifespan in both sexes, we utilized dietary
eRapa at 126 ppm. Mice were fed a diet containing eRapa or the encapsulation control eudragit
diet for 90 days starting at 20–21 months of age and then returned to a standard chow diet. In con-
trast with the effects of daily injection of 8 mg/kg rapamycin (Figures 1A and 2A), body weight and
food intake were largely unaffected by this dietary rapamycin regimen (Figure 4 A,C,E, Figure 4—
figure supplement 1), except for a transient, small increase in body weight in female mice fed
eRapa, as determined by Student’s t test (Figure 4E). Median post-treatment life expectancy was
significantly increased by 42% when female and male animals were considered together (p=0.002,
Figure 4B, Table 3) and overall lifespan was increased by 13% (p=0.003, Figure 4—figure supple-
ment 2A, Table 4). Similar results were observed stratifying on sex; three months of 126 ppm eRapa
administration significantly increased post-treatment survival in both males and females indepen-
dently (Figure 4D,F, Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,C and Tables 1–2). Cox proportional hazards
regression with robust standard error estimates did not find evidence that sex modifies the treat-
ment effect (p=0.904). Between randomization and the end of treatment, 1 male mouse died of
non-age related causes and was excluded from the analysis. Its inclusion in the analysis does not sig-
nificantly affect the results as described above (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A,B).

 In parallel with survival, we also examined healthspan parameters in these cohorts. The effects of
rapamycin on age-associated decline in muscle function and motor coordination were assessed by
testing forelimb grip strength and Rotarod performance. Assessments were performed in the same
animals before onset of treatment, at the end of the 90 day treatment, and 90 days after the end of
the treatment. While eudragit-fed mice showed a steady decline in both grip strength and Rotarod
performance, rapamycin-fed mice scored significantly better than control mice in both assays after
treatment (Figure 4G,H), suggesting that the healthspan promoting effect of rapamycin continues
after treatment is discontinued. Furthermore, only rapamycin-fed mice showed a progressive
increase in Rotarod performance during the 3 days of training and over the whole study, with mice
performing better at 6 months compared to baseline (Figure 4H, large bracket).
In the course of routine animal husbandry, we noted that mice treated with either rapamycin regi-
men produced consistently smaller fecal pellets than age-matched controls (Figure 5A–D). This dif-
ference was present in both dry (Figure 5C,D) and freshly excreted feces (Figure 5—figure
supplement 1A), indicating that water content is not a major factor affecting feces size. In addition,
feces size was affected independently of the method of rapamycin delivery (Figure 5C,D), and the
effect was persistent after cessation of treatment (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C). We hypothe-
sized that changes in the microbiome may underlie this phenotype and therefore analyzed the fecal
microbiome for each of the cohorts used in this study by deep-sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA.
Distance based permutation multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) (Anderson, 2001) indicated
that rapamycin treatment induced a significant change in the composition of fecal microbiome
(p=0.018 for injection cohorts. p=0.015 for feeding cohorts.p=0.005 for pooled cohorts), even after
accounting for delivery method and batch effects (Figure 6—figure supplements 1–3).
Among the most notable changes in fecal bacterial DNA content seen in the global microbiome
analysis was a significant increase in prevalence of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB, Candidatus

 Arthromitus sp.) in the rapamycin treated animals (Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplement 2A).
SFB are intestinal Gram-positive bacteria with a segmented and filamentous morphology, and are
not normally present at high levels in aged mice (Ericsson et al., 2014). The SFB genome lacks a
majority of virulence factors and SFB are not invasive (Prakash et al., 2011); however, their tight
adhesion to the intestinal epithelial cell induces differentiation of host immune cells (Atarashi et al.,
2015). The increase in SFB following rapamycin treatment was confirmed by real-time PCR of DNA
from fecal samples obtained from both mice receiving injections or encapsulated rapamycin
(Figure 6B, Figure 6—figure supplement 2B), as well as by semi-quantitative histological scoring of
the small intestine in an independent cohort of mice obtained from the Harrison Lab at the Jackson
Laboratory and injected with 8 mg/kg/day of for 3 months at the University of Washington
(Figure 6C,D, Figure 6—figure supplement 2C). Since increased SFB DNA was observed both in
mice injected with rapamycin and mice fed dietary eRapa, this effect is independent of mode of
drug delivery. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first pharmacological intervention
to increase SFB in any animal. It will be of interest to determine whether these and other effects of
rapamycin on the microbiome are shared across species and play any causal role in the beneficial or
detrimental effects of this drug.

 Discussion
Taken together, our data demonstrate that a single three-month regimen of rapamycin is sufficient
to robustly increase life expectancy in middle-aged mice, comparable to the effects previously

 reported for life-long treatment, while also improving measures of healthspan and substantially alter-
ing the microbiome. This work extends prior evidence indicating that short-term rapamycin treat-
ment can improve health in mice, including one experiment suggesting that 4 mg/kg rapamycin
every other day for 6 weeks enhanced survival until around 30 months of age in a small cohort
(Chen et al., 2009), and studies reporting improvements in cardiac (Dai et al., 2014; Flynn et al.,
2013) and immune (Chen et al., 2009) function following transient treatment with rapamycin. In the
animals treated with the 126 ppm eRapa diet in this study, the improvements in lifespan and health
were achieved without overt detrimental side effects, although it is possible that some side effects
were undetected, and we did not explicitly test for cataracts, gonadal degeneration, and other
adverse outcomes. In the case of the 8 mg/kg/day injection regimen, serious side effects were noted
in female, but not male mice. Intriguingly, a dramatic shift toward aggressive hematopoietic cancers
and away from non-hematopoietic cancers was observed in these female mice. This is consistent
with a similar weak trend seen in kidney transplant patients receiving rapamycin to prevent organ
rejection, suggesting a possible conservation of mechanism and clinical relevance (Mathew et al.,
2004). Our data indicate a need to carefully consider sex effects when optimizing treatment regi-
mens and mechanism of drug action. They also illustrate the importance of better understanding the
effects of mTOR inhibitors on differential cancer risk, particularly as mTOR inhibitors are being
tested and used clinically for a variety of purposes including the treatment of some rare forms of
cancer. The importance of evaluating potential risks and adverse side effects when developing inter-
ventions to promote healthy aging should not be underestimated.
This study extends other recent work aimed at developing mid-life interventions to promote
healthy aging. Of particular note are two studies reporting improved healthspan from short-term
treatments in older mice with a JAK pathway inhibitor (Xu et al., 2015) and increased lifespan after
transient treatment with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (Zhang et al., 2016). From a
translational perspective, a healthy aging intervention that can be applied for a relatively short
period of time during mid- or late-life is likely to have advantages in cost, practicability and quality
of life of people, and we look forward to further developments in this area.
Materials and methods
Mouse lifespan studies
All lifespan and healthspan experiments were performed on 19–20 month old C57BL6/JNia obtained
from the National Institute on Aging Aged Rodent Colony. A separate cohort of C57BL6/J ranging
from 17 weeks to 100 weeks of age was obtained from the Harrison lab at the Jackson Laboratory
for histological analysis of SFB. Animals were housed in individually ventilated cages (Allentown,
Allentown, NJ) containing corncob bedding (Andersons, Maumee, OH) and nestlets. Mice were fed
irradiated Picolab Rodent Diet 20 #5053 (Lab Diet, St. Louis, MO). Animals were maintained in a spe-
cific pathogen free facility within a Helicobacter spp.-free room. Mice were housed in groups (5 per
cage at a maximum) and aggressive male mice were isolated to prevent fighting. Mice were acclima-
tized at least two weeks before onset of experiments. Mice were inspected daily, and medicated for
non-life threatening conditions as directed by the veterinary staff. Date of death was recorded when
mice were found dead or unlikely to survive longer than 48 hr at the time of inspection. Mice were
euthanized according to the following criteria (modified from the Intervention Testing Program pro-
tocol [Harrison et al., 2009]) when they showed one of these symptoms: (1) inability to eat or drink,
(2) severe lethargy, as indicated by a lack of response such as a reluctance to move when gently
prodded, (3) severe respiratory difficulty while at rest, indicated by a regular pattern of deep
abdominal excursions or gasping, or showing any combination of the following features: (a) severe
balance and gait disturbance, (b) an ulcerated or bleeding tumor, visible to the naked eye and
breaking through the skin of the animal, or rapid weight gain associated with visible or palpable
masses, or (c) Body Condition Score equal to 1 or loss of 20% of body weight in the course of seven
days. Survival data is shown from the end of treatment (23–24 months of age). Deaths before and
during the three month treatment period by group were as follows: 2 vehicle-injected males, 3 rapa-
mycin-injected males, 1 eudragit fed female, 1 eRapa fed male. Sentinel mice (Crl:CD1[ICR]; Charles
River, Wilmington, MA) were tested quarterly and were negative for endo/ectoparasites, mouse nor-
ovirus, mouse hepatitis virus, mouse parvovirus, and rotavirus. Sentinel mice were tested annually for

 Mycoplasma pulmonis, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus 3, Sendai virus, and Theiler murine enceph-
alomyelitis virus. All care of experimental animals was in accordance with the University of Washing-
ton institutional guidelines and experiments were performed as approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
For the injection experiments, rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was dissolved in DMSO to 100 mg/ml,
then further diluted in 5% PEG-400/5% Tween-80 to a final concentration of 1.2 mg/ml, sterile fil-
tered, and stored at �80˚C for long-term storage. 37 rapamycin treated mice (17 males, 20 females)
were i.p. injected daily for 3 months with 66 ml/10g body weight for a final dosage of 8.0 mg/kg
starting at 20–21 months old. 38 Control mice (18 males, 20 females) were i.p. injected with vehicle
solution (5% PEG-400/5% Tween-20) for 3 months. For the feeding model, encapsulated rapamycin
was obtained from Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. Irradiated PicoLab Diet 20 5053 pellets were ground
and mixed with encapsulated rapamycin at 126 ppm. 300 ml of 1% agar melted in sterile water and
200 ml of sterile distilled water were added per kilogram of powdered chow, in order to make pel-
lets. Pellets were stored at �20˚C until use. Control food contained the same concentration of agar
and encapsulation material (eudragit) without rapamycin at the concentration that matched the rapa-
mycin chow. 37 mice (19 on eudragit, 18 on rapamycin) received assigned diet treatments at 20–21
months of age, lasting for 90 days.
Body weight and food intake measurements
Body weight was measured at least weekly from the beginning of treatment until three months after
the end of treatment. For male mice receiving injections (Figure 1A), at each time point from the
start point, sample size was as follows: vehicle N = 19, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18,
17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16, 16, 16, 16, 14, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13; rapamycin N = 20, 19, 19,
19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 18, 18, 18, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16,
16, 15, 15. For female mice receiving injections (Figure 2A), at each time point from the start point,
sample size was as follows: vehicle N = 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20,
19, 19, 19, 19, 18, 18, 18, 18, 17, 17, 17, 16, 15, 15, 13, 12, 11 vehicle; rapamycin N = 20, 20, 20, 20,
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 19, 18, 18, 18, 18, 17, 17, 17, 16, 16, 16, 16, 15, 14,
13, 13. For mice receiving micro-encapsulated diets (Figure 4), at each time from the start point,
sample size was as follows: eudragit males N= 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20,
20, 20, 20, 20, 19, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18; eudragit females N= 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19,
19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16, 16, 15, 15; eRapa males N= 19, 19, 19, 19,
19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17; eRapa females N=
18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 17, 16, 16, 16, 16, 15, 15, 15.
Food intake was measured weekly or twice per week per cage by subtracting the amount of food
remaining on the wire rack from the amount given 4–7 days before. Average food intake per mouse
was calculated by dividing this value by the number of mice in the cage, then averaging all the values
from cages hosting mice under the same treatment and of the same sex.
Histopathological analysis
Gross examination was performed following the natural death or euthanasia of animals. Tissues from
mice were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin, routinely processed and embedded in paraffin,
and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). 16 rapamycin injected female, 15 rapamycin injected
male, 12 vehicle administered female, and 14 vehicle administered male counterparts in the lifespan
study were analyzed for tumor incidence and extent by two board certified veterinary pathologists
(J.M.S. and P.M.T). 7/15 rapamycin injected male mice were autolyzed to varying degrees, which
may have complicated histological detection of systemic neoplasia, although disease sufficient to
result in death was determined for 3 of these mice and systemic neoplasia was detected on histolog-
ical examination of 5 of these 7 mice. Autolysis also complicated the histological assessment of 2
female vehicle treated mice, although systemic neoplasia was detected on histological examination
of one of these two mice. Major organs (including decalcified cross section of the head, skin, lung,
heart, liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, lymph node, salivary gland, gastrointestinal tract and repro-
ductive tract) were examined histologically.
For semi-quantitative SFB analysis, 14 female and 16 male mice i.p. injected with rapamycin
(8 mg/kg/day, daily for 3 months) and 9 female and 17 male mice injected with vehicle (daily for 3

 months) were sacrificed the day after the end of treatment, and H&E sections of the gastrointestinal
tract were routinely prepared and examined. The amount of SFB in the intestinal tissue was graded
on a 0 to 4 scale, with 0 representing no SFB, 1 representing rare SFB, 2 representing mild coloniza-
tion by SFB, 3 representing moderate colonization by SFB, and 4 representing severe colonization of
the small intestine by SFB.
Images of representative lesions were acquired using NIS-Elements BR 3.2 64-bit and plated in
Adobe Photoshop Elements. Image brightness and contrast was adjusted using Auto Smart Fix and
Auto White Balance manipulations applied to the entire image. Original magnification is stated.
Rapamycin serum level measurements
Fresh blood was collected upon euthanasia via cervical dislocation 24 hr after the last injection, and
sera were isolated using serum separators tube (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and immediately stored at
�20 C. Rapamycin was extracted with 100 mM ZnSO4 at room temperature and analyzed using a
Waters 2795 LC/QuattroMicro MS (Waters, Milford MA).
Rotarod assay
Mice were tested on a Rotamex V rotarod (Columbus Instruments, Columbus OH) with a constant
acceleration of 0.1 rpm/second over a period of four days. On the first day, all animals were allowed
to acclimate to the rotarod with a single round of testing. Over the following three days (labeled day
1, 2, and 3) all mice were tested three times, with a 30 min minimum resting period in between
rounds. All mice were subjected to rotarod testing prior to initiation of treatment, upon cessation of
treatment, and 90 days after cessation of treatment. Individuals running the rotarod test were not
blinded to the treatment.
Forelimb grip strength test
Forelimb grip strength was tested with a Chatillon DFE-050 force gauge (AMETEK, Largo FL). Ani-
mals were held by the base of the tail, allowed to grip the bar of the gauge, and slowly pulled away
from the testing apparatus with a smooth horizontal movement. Each mouse was tested 5 times per
round, and maximum grip strength was recorded. Animals were tested prior to initiation of treat-
ment, upon cessation of treatment, and 90 days after cessation of treatment. At least 72 hr rest was
allowed between grip strength and rotarod testing. Individuals running the grip strength test were
not blinded to the treatment.
Microbiome analysis
All fecal samples were collected per cage at 3 months of treatment immediately after excretion from
the mice analyzed for lifespan analysis and frozen with liquid nitrogen. Microbial DNA was extracted
as previously described (Ericsson et al., 2015). Briefly, fecal samples were collected into 800 mL of
lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM tris-HCl, 50 mM EDTA, and 4% SDS), homogenized in a Qiagen
Tissuelyser II (Valencia CA), and incubated at 70˚C for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with 1 mL
of 2 M ammonium acetate, incubated on ice, and then centrifuged at 16,000 � g for 10 min at room
temperature. The supernatant was then mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold isopropanol and
incubated for 30 min on ice. The contents of the tube were then centrifuged at 4˚C for 15 min to pel-
let DNA. The pellet was rinsed twice with 70% EtOH and re-suspended in 150 mL of tris-EDTA buffer.
DNA was further purified using DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. For Metagenomic sequencing, sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was per-
formed on the Illumina MiSeq platform (San Diego CA), as previously described (Ericsson et al.,
2015). The raw metagenome data are publicly available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)
database (ERP014805).
Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR to measure SFB and total bacterial DNA was performed on a CFX384 Real-Time Sys-
tem with a C1000-Touch thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and a StepOnePlus (Applied Biosys-
tems, Foster City, CA) with a Sybr Green method as previously described (Ericsson et al., 2015). 10
ng of DNA collected from fecal samples was analyzed. Primers for SFB are 5’ TGTGGGTTGTGAA
TAACAAT 3’ and 5’ GCGAGCTTCCCTCATTACAAGG 3’. Primers for the detection of total bacteria

 (16s rRNA gene) are 5’ TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT 3’ and 5’ GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTG
TT 3’.
Statistical analysis
An unpaired two-sample t test was used to compare two experimental groups unless otherwise men-
tioned. Post-treatment survival data were analyzed using a one-sided Mann Whitney U test (http://
vassarstats.net/utest.html). Fisher’s exact test was used for semi-quantitative analysis of SFB and the
incidence of malignancies. Rotarod p-values were calculated by applying the glht() function for gen-
eral linear hypotheses for mixed-effects models from the R multcomp package (Hothorn et al.,
2008) to each of the outputs from the lmer() function in the R lme4 package (Bates et al., 2014).
For the differential abundance analysis of microbiome population, we used the fitZig() function in
the R package metagenomeSeq (Paulson et al., 2013).
The Figure 6—figure supplement 1 heatmap of hierarchical clustering of 16S rRNA gene preva-
lence was generated using Euclidian Distance using the R package pheatmap. The shift in the micro-
bial population after controlling for the experimental effect was tested using distance matrix based
permutation MANOVA implemented in R package vegan as the adonis() function using the weighted
Unifrac distance. Violin plots and stacked barplot were created using R package ggplot2. In the
above analysis we removed a library that exhibited signs of experimental failure (total library size
<10000).
