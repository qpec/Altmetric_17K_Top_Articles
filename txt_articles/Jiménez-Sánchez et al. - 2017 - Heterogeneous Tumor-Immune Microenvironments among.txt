SUMMARY
We present an exceptional case of a patient with
high-grade serous ovarian cancer, treated with
multiple chemotherapy regimens, who exhibited
regression of some metastatic lesions with concom-
itant progression of other lesions during a treatment-
free period. Using immunogenomic approaches, we
found that progressing metastases were character-
ized by immune cell exclusion, whereas regressing
and stable metastases were infiltrated by CD8+ and
CD4+ T cells and exhibited oligoclonal expansion of
specific T cell subsets. We also detected CD8+
T cell reactivity against predicted neoepitopes after
isolation of cells from a blood sample taken almost
3 years after the tumors were resected. These find-
ings suggest that multiple distinct tumor immune
microenvironments co-exist within a single individual
and may explain in part the heterogeneous fates of
metastatic lesions often observed in the clinic post-
therapy.
INTRODUCTION
The majority of patients with ovarian cancer relapse despite
appropriate surgery and chemotherapy (Bowtell et al., 2015;
Cannistra, 2004). Ovarian cancer is characterized by a prepon-
derance of DNA copy-number alterations and a modest somatic
missense mutation burden (�61 per exome) (Patch et al., 2015;
Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011). Analysis of
data from various cancer types studied by the Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) consortium, including ovarian cancer, has demon-
strated that the number of somatic mutations and neoepitopes
(peptides resulting from somatic non-silent mutations that are
presented to the immune system) correlates with overall survival
(Brown et al., 2014). Together with the observation that chemo-
therapy in some cases may trigger immune activation in ovarian
cancer and other cancer types (Galluzzi et al., 2015; Gavalas
et al., 2010; Pfirschke et al., 2016), this highlights the importance
of investigating the host immune response in ovarian cancer.
However, the interplay between somatic mutations, prior ther-
apy, and the host immune response in this disease remains
largely unknown.
Several studies of smaller cohorts of patients with metastatic
ovarian cancer have found that primary and metastatic lesions
exhibit heterogeneity at the genomic level (Bashashati et al.,
2013; Lee et al., 2015; De Mattos-Arruda et al., 2014). Supporting
these findings, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-
based analysis has revealed that ovarian tumors and metastatic
peritoneal implants are already phenotypically heterogeneous at
diagnosis (Sala et al., 2012). As tumor heterogeneity increases
the likelihood of presence of subclones able to escape the
immune system (Bhang et al., 2015; Su et al., 2012; Turke
et al., 2010), immune control may be particularly challenging in
ovarian cancer due to extensive heterogeneity and the low
number of potential mutation-derived epitopes.

 The clinical challenge of tumor heterogeneity has been
demonstrated
recently
in
the context
of immunotherapy:
patients with less heterogeneous tumors, and hence with more
clonal neoepitopes, were more likely to respond to checkpoint-
blockade immunotherapy than patients with heterogeneous
tumors (McGranahan et al., 2016). Whether chemotherapy and
the immune system could work cooperatively is also being
explored. In some settings, chemotherapy promotes immune
cell homeostasis and activation (Carson et al., 2004; Gavalas
et al., 2010; Pfirschke et al., 2016), tumor antigen release (Zitvo-
gel et al., 2008), and decreased numbers of myeloid-derived
suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment (Suzuki et al.,
2005). Furthermore, effector T cells have recently been impli-
cated to play a role in abrogating fibroblast-mediated chemore-
sistance in a mouse model of ovarian cancer (Wang et al., 2016).
Despite these findings, a unified model describing the effect of
chemotherapy on the tumor heterogeneity and immune-tumor
interactions has not yet been reached. A critical step toward
understanding the effect of chemotherapy on advanced meta-
static diseases and the immune response in humans is to
analyze intra-patient matched primary and metastatic tumors
(Brabletz et al., 2013). The ability to perform such analyses has
been limited by the fact that multiple tumor sites from a single
patient with advanced disease are rarely concurrently sampled,
mainly due to the lack of clinical indication.
Here we present a case study of a high-grade serous ovarian
cancer patient whose different metastases exhibited concomi-
tant regression and progression after treatment with multiple
types of chemotherapy. We used whole-exome sequencing,
RNA expression data, immunohistochemistry, neoepitope pre-
diction, in situ T cell receptor sequencing of tumor-infiltrating
immune cells, and T cell-neoepitope challenge assays with
intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) to investigate the genetic,
molecular, and cellular components that potentially underlie
this differential growth. In this heavily chemotherapy-treated
patient, immune cell infiltration with clonal expansion of T cells,
but not mutation or neoepitope number, correlated with tumor
progression/regression status. Our immunogenomic analysis
paints a portrait that immune infiltration and activation are
different in each tumor at 2 years post-chemotherapy. Inter-
site immune heterogeneity represents an important clinical chal-
lenge in the development of treatment modalities to overcome
intra-patient tumor heterogeneity.
RESULTS
The patient presented here was diagnosed with stage IV high-
grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma, which typically exhibits
a 5 year survival of 17% (National Cancer Institute, SEER Data
Base), and underwent an optimal surgical debulking followed
by paclitaxel combined with first cisplatin and then carboplatin.
The patient experienced recurrence after 7 months, and during
a period of 3 years she was treated with multiple regimens of
chemotherapy with progression of disease after each therapy
(Figures 1A and 1B). Her cancer was growing radiographically,
and her CA125 was rising during treatment with topotecan
when she then transitioned to best supportive care and was
followed clinically with regular CA125 biomarker evaluation.
After chemotherapy treatment was stopped, she experienced
an atypical course: her CA125 decreased, and after 2 years
of clinical follow up, CT scans showed evidence of differential
growth of metastatic lesions including a new complex cystic
mass in the vaginal cuff. Because of her long treatment-free
interval and abdominal discomfort, she opted to undergo
another debulking procedure, which found a substantial dis-
ease burden including tumor implants on the liver capsule,
the splenic hilum, right upper quadrant (RUQ), and recto-
vaginal space (Figures 1A and 1B). Samples of the primary
and four metastatic tumors were submitted for whole-exome
sequencing, microarray RNA quantification, staining for protein
markers by immunofluorescence, and in situ T cell receptor
sequencing.
Phylogenetic Analysis of Somatic Mutations in Tumors
We performed whole-exome sequencing of normal blood and
the resected samples to identify somatic mutations in the
primary tumor and the metastases. Of all samples, we detected
the highest mutation load in the liver and vaginal cuff metastases
(Figure 1C). To infer the evolutionary relationship between the
tumor samples, we used a binary presence/absence matrix of
the non-silent mutations to perform a phylogenetic reconstruc-
tion based on the parsimony ratchet analysis method with
branch lengths proportional to the number of non-silent muta-
tions (Nixon, 1999; Schliep, 2011) (Figures 1D and S1A). The liver
and vaginal cuff tumors were genetically more heterogeneous
and harbored more mutations.
To estimate the proportion of cancer cells identified with a
given mutation (cellular prevalence), we applied PyClone (Roth
et al., 2014) using CopywriteR-inferred (Kuilman et al., 2015)
DNA copy-number changes (Figures S1B and S1C) and
ABSOLUTE-inferred (Carter et al., 2012) tumor purity and abso-
lute copy numbers. As expected, truncal and shared mutations
were generally clonal with high cellular prevalence, whereas
private mutations had medium to low cellular prevalence indi-
cating subclonal status (Figure 1E). Focusing on the specific
genes that were mutated across all samples, we found among
the truncal mutations potential oncogenic driver alterations,
including WNK3P1728R, PAX4P287L, and TP53N247I (Figure 1D).
TP53N247I was detected with a high cellular prevalence indicating
loss of heterozygosity, which was supported by our DNA copy-
number analysis. Additionally, we identified other putative trun-
cal events, including deletion of BRCA1, BRCA2, and PTEN
and amplification of CCNE1 (Figure S1B), which are commonly
altered in serous ovarian cancer (Bowtell et al., 2015; Patch
et al., 2015). Among the private mutations we detected several
potential driver mutations including RUNX3P246S in the growing
splenic lesion and CSMD1G1770R in the primary tumor. Several
private and shared branch mutations were found in different
Rho GTPase-activating genes (ARHGAP), which inactivate Rho
and Rac signaling involved in the control of cellular motility
(Bernards and Settleman, 2004; Li et al., 2014).
Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Immune-Related
Pathways Overexpressed in Regressing Tumors
To evaluate whether genes involved in chemotherapy resistance
were differentially altered between tumors and associated with

 regression and progression status, we analyzed somatic alter-
ations and gene-expression data (Affymetrix transcript array)
across the samples. After analyzing chemotherapy-resistance
genes identified in HGSOC (Patch et al., 2015), as well as gene
sets for multidrug resistance (ABC transporters), apoptosis,
and DNA-damage response, we found no clear evidence of
gene-expression or somatic-alteration patterns (mutations,
DNA amplification, and deep deletion) that differed between
progressing (primary, vaginal cuff, and spleen) and regressing/
stable tumors (RUQ and liver) (Figures S2A–S2C). Interestingly,
there was a trend that the ABC transporter TAP1, which is known
for its function as a transporter of cytosolic peptides to the endo-
plasmic reticulum for HLA class I presentation (Bahram et al.,
1991; Neefjes et al., 1993; Powis et al., 1991; Suh et al., 1994),

 was expressed at a higher level in the regressing tumors
(Figure 2A).
To further identify potential differences between samples we
analyzed gene sets and pathways in an unbiased manner with
single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) (Barbie
et al., 2009; Subramanian et al., 2005). Using permutation-based
false-discovery rate, we estimated the significance of the enrich-
ment score for each pathway and performed an outlier analysis
relating gene-set significance to the relative change in enrich-
ment score between a given sample and the rest of the samples
(Figure 2B; Tables S2D–S2G). The most significant and differen-
tially enriched pathway found was the immune system pathway
with a higher enrichment in the spleen and RUQ metastases and
a lower enrichment in the primary and vaginal-cuff tumors (Table
S2H). Further indicating immune activation, the systemic lupus
erythematosus pathway was highly enriched in the RUQ and liver
metastases (Table S2I), whereas TCR signaling pathways were
preferentially enriched in the RUQ sample alone (Table S2J).
Cancer and proliferation pathways, as well as Wnt signaling,
were more enriched in the primary and vaginal-cuff tumors
(Table S2K). No outlier gene sets were identified for the nega-
tively enriched pathways (Figure S2E; Tables S2D–S2F).
To investigate the gene-expression differences between the
samples on an unbiased individual gene level, we calculated

 the coefficient of variation of the expression levels for each gene
across samples (Table S2A). We found that among the most
variably expressed genes, besides lipid metabolic process-
related genes in the liver, the T cell chemo-attractant CXCL9
was predominantly expressed in the RUQ and liver metastases,
as well as STAT1, which has been implicated in the regulation of
CXCL9 expression (Liao et al., 1995; Satoh and Tabunoki, 2013)
(Figure S2D). No relevant mutations in immune-related mole-
cules were identified except for truncal mutations in the MHC
class I polypeptide-related sequence B (MICB) (Table S1A),
which is a stress-induced ligand recognized by NKG2D recep-
tors on CD8ab and gd T cells, as well as NK cells (Bauer et al.,
1999; Groh et al., 1999).
Heterogeneous Immune Cell Infiltration in Growing and
Regressing Lesions
To investigate the immune infiltration status of the tumors, we
used ESTIMATE to analyze tumor purity and overall stromal
and immune components (Yoshihara et al., 2013). The lowest
tumor purities and highest immune infiltration scores were found
in the RUQ, liver, and spleen samples (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
we deconvolved the gene-expression data using CIBERSORT
(Newman et al., 2015) as a first approach to dissect infiltration
of specific immune cell subsets in the tumors. We found that
the largest immune cell components corresponded to CD8+
and CD4+ T cells in RUQ, liver, and spleen tumors, although the
overall CIBERSORT deconvolution p value was only significant
for RUQ and liver tumors (Figure 3B). In contrast, the primary
and vaginal-cuff tumors had low immune cell ESTIMATE scores
and insufficient levels of immune cell transcripts to confidently
apply CIBERSORT (Tables S3A and S3B), together suggesting
a low or absent immune component present in these tumors.
Following this analysis, samples were immuno-fluorescently
co-stained for T cell markers CD4, CD8, and the T regulatory
cell marker FOXP3, double stained for PD-L1 and macrophage
marker CD68, as well as double stained for PD-L1 and the
T cell marker CD3 (Figures 3C and S3A). Consistent with the
transcriptomic deconvolution analyses, the primary tumor
demonstrated no T cell infiltration and was negative for PD-L1
and CD68 (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3A; Table S3C). The vaginal-
cuff lesion, which was growing at the time of surgical resection,
did display a T cell population; however, these cells bordered but
did not infiltrate the tumor. The splenic lesion, which was also
progressing at the time of resection, albeit at a much more
modest rate than the vaginal-cuff lesion, demonstrated a CD8+
infiltrate. Finally, the RUQ and liver metastases, which were re-
gressing and stable, respectively, at the time of surgical resec-
tion, displayed a strong CD4+ and CD8+ infiltrate. In summary,
the transcript and IF analyses suggested that each tumor site
displayed a unique tumor-immune microenvironment ranging
from immune cell inclusion to exclusion.
Regressing Metastases Show T Cell Oligoclonal
Expansion
It is known that genetic alterations in HLA-I molecules are asso-
ciated with escape of cancer cells from CD8+ T cell recognition
(Shukla et al., 2015). The patient’s HLA alleles were determined
experimentally by conventional PCR-based HLA typing and
computationally on exome data by OptiType (Szolek et al.,
2014) and POLYSOLVER (Shukla et al., 2015) independently,
yielding the same results (Table S4A). We searched copy-num-
ber alterations as well as mutations by applying POLYSOLVER,
a specific computational pipeline for HLA-I typing and mutation
detection in the HLA-I genes; however, no genetic alterations
were detected. We then assessed gene expression and found
that all HLA-I genes were expressed in the tumors (Tables
S2A–S2C); however, compared to primary and vaginal-cuff sam-
ples, an overall higher expression of HLA genes was observed in
the RUQ and liver samples, with a lesser extent seen in the
spleen sample (Figure 4A).
We next estimated the neoepitope landscape of the samples
by mapping missense mutations to their amino acid sequences,
in silico generating the mutant peptide sequences, and predict-
ing the mutant peptide-HLA binding affinities to the patient’s
HLAs. The predictions were performed using the NetMHC algo-
rithm with HLA specific cut-offs for HLA-I (Lundegaard et al.,
2008; Nielsen et al., 2003; Paul et al., 2013) and consensus
scores for HLA-II (Kim et al., 2012; Kreiter et al., 2015). The
tumors with the highest mutation and neoepitope loads for
both HLA class I and HLA class II were the liver and vaginal
cuff, which also had the highest number of missense mutations
(Figure 4B). We also investigated whether there were shared
neoepitopes or mutations present in the RUQ (regressing) and
liver (stable) metastases alone, i.e., not present in the other
tumors. No shared mutations between RUQ and liver alone
were detected (Figure S4A); therefore, it did not appear that a
shared neoepitope or mutation alone explained the behavior of
the non-progressing tumor sites.
As an active CD8 T cell infiltration can exert a selective pres-
sure at the neoepitope level (DuPage et al., 2012; Matsushita
et al., 2012; Teng et al., 2015; Tran et al., 2016; Verdegaal
et al., 2016), we further interrogated the neoepitope landscape
by analyzing potential evidence of neoepitope depletion using
an approach adopted from a report analyzing TCGA data (Roo-
ney et al., 2015). Relative to the other samples from the patient,
the regressing RUQ tumor showed a consistent—yet non-signif-
icant—tendency of neoepitope depletion (p < 0.1 by two-sided
empirical p value; Figures S4B and S4C). This result is in line
with a recent report showing neoepitope depletion in tumors
with higher levels of immune signatures in colorectal cancer
(Davoli et al., 2017). We then predicted the intrinsic immunoge-
nicity of neoepitopes by analyzing the biochemical properties
of peptides that are predicted to be associated with T cell-
epitope recognition (Calis et al., 2013). We observed that there
was a significant effect of neoepitope clonality on the probability
of a neoepitope having immunogenic properties, with clonal neo-
epitopes being predicted as less immunogenic (p = 0.02 by
chi-square test; Figures S5A–S5D). Using the predicted non-
binders instead of binders in a control analysis, the opposite
trend was observed as there was a small but significant effect
of clonal mutations being predicted as more immunogenic
(p = 0.003 by chi-square test; Figure S5F). Although preliminary,
these analyses indicate a potential negative selection process at
the neoepitope level.
To evaluate a T cell response in the tumors, we investigated
whether T cell clonal expansion could be detected in the tumor

 samples. To this end, we performed in situ TCR sequencing on
each sample and on peripheral blood from the patient sampled
550 days after tumor resection (Figures 4C and S6A; Table
S5A). We detected a T cell expansion in the RUQ metastasis
with a dominant clone accounting for 13% of all productive
T cell receptors sequenced. The expanded clone was also
detected in the liver and spleen metastases and strikingly also
in the blood of the patient. Though, the clonal frequency in the
RUQ metastasis was significantly higher than that in the other
samples (q < 0.001 by two-sided binomial tests with BH

 correction). In contrast, no T cell receptors were detected in the
primary and vaginal-cuff tumors, further supporting their lack of
T cell infiltrate.
Peripheral Blood CD8+ T Cells React against Predicted
Neoepitopes
Since expanded T cell clones detected in the tumors were still de-
tected in the patient’s blood sampled 1 year 6 months (550 days)
after resection, we decided to test whether circulating T cells
could react against any of the predicted neoepitopes. We
sampled blood from the patient again, this time at 2 years
8 months (978 days) after resection, and isolated peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Figure S6A). We performed
an ICS assay lasting 21 days, where PBMCs were cultured with
each of the mutant peptides (n = 43) predicted to have at least
one HLA-I neoepitope, as a mutant peptide (17-mer) can have
more than one predicted binder (9-mer) (Figure S6B). Impor-
tantly, the likelihood of observing T cell reactivity by the ICS as-
says is low due to the low frequency of T cell precursors in the
blood and the limited representation of the total TCR repertoire
in each peptide challenge experiment (5 3 105 cells per well)
(Rizvi et al., 2015). Despite the high false-negative rate generally
observed with the ICS assay, we found CD8+ T cells reactive
against several mutant peptides showing cytokine activation
levels (IFN-g and TNF-a) similar to the positive control consisting
of a mixture of viral-derived epitopes (Figures 5A and 5B; Table
S5A). Of the top five reactive peptides detected, all had a higher
mutant to wild-type predicted HLA-I binding affinity (inset, Fig-
ure 5B). With limited material available, we focused on the top
hits and repeated the ICS experiment and again found reactivity
with peptide 12, which was derived from a clonal mutation in
FLG2E1608K (Table S1A), and peptide 6, which was derived from
a private mutation in LRRC8EC629Y in the splenic tumor.
DISCUSSION
The natural history of ovarian cancer typically features remis-
sions of decreasing length, leading to premature death (Bowtell
et al., 2015). In this unusual case, the divergent fates of the
tumors show an overall association with multiple molecular
and cellular features at the tumor-immune interface (Figure S7).
For example, the shrinking RUQ tumor was heavily infiltrated
with CD4 and CD8 T cells and had evidence of active CD8
T cell surveillance with expansion of specific TCR clonotypes.
The stable liver tumor also exhibited immune infiltration, but at
a lower level and with fewer expanding T cell clones. The spleen
tumor was growing modestly at the time of resection and pre-
sented with intermediate tumor-immune microenvironment fea-
tures. Finally, the growing vaginal-cuff and the primary tumor
exhibited complete immune cell exclusion. The TCR clone
most prevalent in the non-progressing tumors was also detected
in the blood of the patient 18 months after the metastases were
resected, and clonal neoepitopes induced a CD8+ T cell
response from PBMCs obtained nearly 3 years after surgery.
The two most extreme tumors, the RUQ and the vaginal cuff,
had a consistently divergent pattern of molecular features
associated with immune activation (HLA expression, IFN-g,
CXCL9, TAP1, etc.) and immune suppression (Wnt signaling).

 Importantly, the observed features that relate to progression/
regression status are correlative and do not per se prove any
bona fide mechanism nor negate the fact that chemotherapy
could have influenced the divergent fates. In sum, we find evi-
dence of distinct tumor-immune microenvironments among
differentially growing metastases within the same individual.
Particular findings of this study may have important clinical
implications if they are corroborated in large cohorts. In this
patient with advanced HGSOC we observed distinct tumor-im-
mune microenvironments in the five sampled tumors (primary
and four recurrent tumors). The mutation and predicted neoepi-
tope space alone did not explain the different regressing/
progressing behavior of the metastatic samples. In contrast to
recent studies of resistance to immunotherapy, no mutations
were detected in the antigen presentation machinery (Giannakis
et al., 2016; Rooney et al., 2015; Shukla et al., 2015), B2-microglo-
bulin (Challa-Malladi et al., 2011; Rooney et al., 2015; Zaretsky
et al., 2016), the IFN-g pathway (Benci et al., 2016; Zaretsky
et al., 2016), or HLA-I genes (Rooney et al., 2015; Shukla et al.,
2015; Tran et al., 2016) in the growing tumors. Instead of spe-
cific neoepitopes present in regressing samples, T cell reactivity
against clonal neoepitopes was detected. Interestingly, all neoe-
pitopes that elicited a CD8+ T cell response had higher mutant to
wild-type HLA-I predicted binding affinity. The lack of tumor-spe-
cific somatic alterations in the regressing and stable tumors alone
puts forward the idea that non-somatic factors in the tumor
microenvironment may have been playing a critical role in the
immune response and overall fate of the tumors. For example,
STAT1 and CXCL9 were highly expressed in the RUQ and liver
metastases; CXCL9 is well known as a potent T cell chemokine
(Liao et al., 1995; Rainczuk et al., 2012), and high expression of
CXCL9 and CXCL10 correlate with enhanced T cell infiltration
of tumors and better survival of ovarian cancer patients (Bronger
et al., 2016).In contrast, the vaginal cuff growing metastasis had a
higher enrichment score in the Wnt pathway, which has been
implicated as a mechanism that impairs recruitment of dendritic
cells and prevents T cell infiltration in autochthonous mouse mel-
anoma models via a CXCL9- and CXCL10-dependent mecha-
nism (Spranger et al., 2015, 2017). Although a direct link between
tumor fate and the observations found in this patient cannot be
proven with the available samples, this case emphasizes the
importance of an integrative approach to understand the molec-
ular mechanisms governing the interaction between the tumor
and its immune microenvironment (Miao and Van Allen, 2016).
As in any case study, the present study has notable limitations.
It involves only one patient, and thus further studies are needed to
determine whether the principles discovered here apply to other
patients. Furthermore, the interplay between treatment, somatic
mutations, the immune system, and heterogeneous fates of the
tumors cannot be untangled in this clinical case. For example, it
is feasible that the multiple chemotherapy interventions for this
patient contributed to shaping the somatic mutations and the
microenvironment of the tumors, but due to the availability of
samples and descriptive nature of the study this could not be
explored further. Despite such limitations, this case provides
evidence for differential tumor-immune responses existing in
metastases of the same individual, related not only to genetic al-
terations but also to the tumor-immune microenvironment, which
to our knowledge has not yet been demonstrated in patients
with ovarian cancer. Also, most studies on the tumor-immune
microenvironment have been conducted in primary tumors
(Teng et al., 2015), with the exception of a study of matched

 primary and metastatic tumors, which concluded that the im-
mune contexture globally recapitulates that of the primary
(Remark et al., 2013). In contrast, the case of recurrent HGSOC
presented here clearly shows the opposite: that tumor-immune
microenvironments, between primary tumor and metastases,
and between metastases, can be heterogeneous within a patient.
Previous genomic and immune profiling of multiple lesions in
patients have also shed light on tumor heterogeneity and its
implications on tumor evolution (Gerlinger et al., 2012), disease
progression
(Ascierto
et
al.,
2017),
and
immune
control
(McGranahan et al., 2016; S
xenbabao�
glu et al., 2016; Sridharan
et al., 2016). For example, tumors that are genetically more het-
erogeneous have less immune infiltrates (S
xenbabao�
glu et al.,
2016) and less benefit from checkpoint-blockade immunother-
apies (McGranahan et al., 2016). It has been shown that T cell
infiltration and gene expression of immune-related genes corre-
late with response to checkpoint-blockade immunotherapy in
melanoma (Chen et al., 2016). Additionally, analyses of syn-
chronous resected metastases with differential progression in
patients with melanoma has shown that intra-patient metastases
present not only genetic heterogeneity but also immune-infiltra-
tion heterogeneity of immune cell types and T cell clonality
between samples (Reuben et al., 2017). A rapid autopsy study
of a patient with metastatic melanoma treated with anti-PD-1
therapy showed that resistant metastases overexpressed genes
related to extracellular matrix and neutrophil function (Ascierto
et al., 2017). Interestingly, association between Wnt signaling
and lack of T cell infiltration was also observed in a patient with
adenoid cystic carcinoma where serial biopsies from the same
patient were analyzed, and different expression profiles between
primary and metastatic deposits were also detected (Sridharan
et al., 2016). Finally, a plethora of molecular mechanisms and
types of cells influencing the tumor-immune microenvironment
have been described in different tumor types, leading to impor-
tant advances in immunotherapy (Joyce and Fearon, 2015;
Melero et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2017). Unfortunately, the
promise of immunotherapy has not been as successful in ovarian
cancer as it has been in other tumor types (Homicsko et al., 2016)
despite the fact that it was recognized more than a decade ago
that T cell infiltration is a key element for patient outcome in this
disease (Zhang et al., 2003). We believe that the growing
evidence of differential genomic, transcriptomic, and immune
profiles between and within patients will eventually provide
new key elements to target in ovarian cancer and other tumor
types. However, this task will require extensive and deep
systematic analyses along with longitudinal data, as the differ-
ences between metastases and coexistence of tumor-immune
microenvironments within a patient are likely to be dynamic
and sensitive to intrinsic (e.g., mutations and cell-cell communi-
cation) and extrinsic perturbations (e.g., prior treatment and
microbiome; Sivan et al., 2015; Vetizou et al., 2015).
In conclusion, this case study provides evidence of divergent
tumor genetics, tumor microenvironments, and immune activa-
tion within a single patient with advanced ovarian cancer. If this
phenomenon proves generalizable, then the inter-site heteroge-
neity described here bespeaks a profound clinical challenge for
the use of cytotoxic, targeted, and immuno-therapies. This obser-
vation, although made in an exceptional long-term survivor pa-
tient, may explain the frequent heterogeneous responses seen
clinicallybut insufficiently documentedbythelimitedradiographic
measurements provided by the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST). Given the data presented in this study, it
will be essential to understand not only how to therapeutically
target genomic heterogeneity between and within metastases
but also how to successfully mobilize an anti-tumor immune
response able to control all metastases in advanced cancers.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human subjects research
Patient samples were collected and analyzed after informed consent to the institutional tissue collection protocol, and approval by
the Internal Review Board (IRB) of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The biological sex of the patient is female (XX). The age of
the patient at the time the primary sample was resected was 53 years old, and 60 years old at the time the metastatic samples were
resected.
Distribution and availability of blood and tissue used in this study
The tissue and peripheral blood used for this work are nearly exhausted. Investigators interested in their use should contact the Lead
Contact and a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) put in place as per MSKCC Standard Operating Procedures.
METHOD DETAILS
Whole exome sequencing
Whole exome sequencing was performed using the Illumina protocol at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.
Illumina sequencing of exomes was employed targeting approximately 37.7Mb of mainly exonic territory made up of all targets from
Broad Institute’s Agilent exome design (Agilent SureSelect All Exon V2), all coding regions of Gencode V11 genes, and all coding
regions of RefSeq gene and KnownGene tracks from the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Data was analyzed using
the Broad Picard Pipeline which includes de-multiplexing and data aggregation.
The Illumina exome sequencing uses Illumina’s in-solution DNA probe based hybrid selection method that uses similar principles
as the Broad Institute-AgilentTechnologies developed in-solution RNA probe based hybrid selection method (Fisher et al., 2011;
Gnirke et al., 2009) to generate Illumina exome sequencing libraries. Pooled libraries were normalized to 2nM and denatured using
0.2N NaOH prior to sequencing. Flow cell cluster amplification and sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer’s pro-
tocols using either the HiSeq 2000 v3 or HiSeq 2500. Each run was a 76 bp paired-end with a dual eight-base index barcode read. The
sequencing depths of the samples were: normal blood sample (90% at 20X), primary (82% at 50X), spleen (78% at 50X), RUQ (60% at
50X), liver (89% at 50X), and vaginal cuff (77% at 50X) tumors.
Gene expression
RNA was extracted from FFPE samples using the RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Catalog
Number: AM1975). RNA expression was assessed using the human Affymetrix Clariom D Pico assay. Arrays were analyzed using
the SST-RMA algorithm in the Affymetrix Expression Console Software. Expression was determined by using the Affymetrix Tran-
scriptome Analysis Console, and for genes displaying inconsistent expression between probes, the SRY gene signal was used as
a cutoff. LOESS normalization across samples was implemented before differential expression analysis and ssGSEA (Tables S2A
and S2C) using:
# R 3.4.0
library(affy) # version 1.54
data_nom<-normalize.loess(data, family.loess=’’gaussian’’)
Immunofluorescent staining
The immunofluorescent staining and cell counting were performed at Molecular Cytology Core Facility of Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center using Discovery XT processor (Ventana Medical Systems) by a cytologist blinded to the sample identifiers and con-
ditions. The tissue sections were deparaffinized with EZPrep buffer (Ventana Medical Systems), antigen retrieval was performed with
CC1 buffer (Ventana Medical Systems). Sections were blocked for 30 min with Background Buster solution (Innovex) followed by
avidin/biotin blocking for 8 min. Pseudocolors were applied as follows: CD4 A594, FOXP3 A488, CD8 A647; CD68 and CD3 A594
and PD-L1 A488. Cells were detected using the DAPI image, which was processed and segmented using ImageJ/FIJI (NIH). Appro-
priate threshold values were set for all other markers, and the number of cells with positive signal above the threshold was counted for
all single and double staining.
For multiplex staining, each marker was added consecutively in separate staining runs as follows. CD4/FoxP3/CD8: Sections were
incubated with anti-CD4 (Ventana, cat#790-4423, 0.5 mg/ml) for 5 hr, followed by 60 min incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit
IgG (Vector Laboratories, cat # PK6101) at 1:200 dilution. The detection was performed with Streptavidin-HRP D (part of DABMap kit,
Ventana Medical Systems), followed by incubation with Tyramide Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, cat# T20922) prepared according to manu-
facturer instruction with predetermined dilutions. Next, slides were incubated with anti-FoxP3 (Abcam, cat#ab20034, 5 mg/ml) for
Cell 170, 927–938.e1–e8, August 24, 2017

 4 hr, followed by 60 min incubation with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, cat# MKB-22258) at 1:200 dilution.
The detection was performed with Streptavidin-HRP D (part of DABMap kit, Ventana Medical Systems), followed by incubation with
Tyramide Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen, cat# T20914) prepared according to manufacturer instruction with predetermined dilutions.
Finally, sections were incubated with anti-CD8 (Ventana, cat#790-4460, 0.07 mg/ml) for 5 hr, followed by 60 min incubation with
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector, cat # PK6101) at 1:200 dilution.
PDL1/CD68 or CD3: First, sections were incubated with anti-PDL1 (Cell Signaling, cat#13684, 5 mg/ml) for 5 hr, followed by 60 min
incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector, cat # PK6101) at 1:200 dilution. The detection was performed with
Streptavidin-HRP D (part of DABMap kit, Ventana Medical Systems), followed by incubation with Tyramide Alexa 488 (Invitrogen,
cat# T20922) prepared according to manufacturer instruction with predetermined dilutions. Next, slides were incubated with
anti-CD68 (DAKO, cat#M0814, 0.02 mg/ml) for 5 hr, followed by 60 min incubation with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector
Labs, cat# MKB-22258) at 1:200 dilution, or with anti-CD3 (DAKO, cat#A0452, 1.2 mg/ml) for 4 hr, followed by 60 min incubation
with biotinylated horse anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs, cat# PK6101) at 1:200 dilution. The detection was performed with Streptavi-
din-HRP D (part of DABMap kit, Ventana Medical Systems), followed by incubation with Tyramide Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen,
cat# T20914) prepared according to manufacturer instruction with predetermined dilutions. After staining slides were counterstained
with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich, cat# D9542, 5 mg/ml) for 10 min and coverslipped with Mowiol.
Sequenced-based HLA typing
HLA class I and class II 6-digit typing was performed at the New York Blood Center by sequence-based typing and specific sequence
primers.
TCR sequencing
High-throughput sequencing of the T cell receptors present in the samples and blood of the patient was done using the immunoSEQ
assay platform (Adaptive biotechnologies).
PBMC–neoepitope assay
The predicted peptides were synthesized (Genscript Corporation). PBMCs were cultured in complete RPMI (Core Media Preparation
Facility MSKCC) with peptides at 1 mg/mL, peptide vehicle (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) and CEF peptide pool (2 mg/ml, C.T.L) for 21 days
with peptide restimulation at day 7 and day 14. IL-2 (Proleukin, Chiron) and IL-15 (Peprotech, cat#200-15) were added every 3 days at
10 IU/mL and 10 ng/mL respectively. Intracellular Cell Staining (ICS) was performed at day 14, and day 21 after 6 hr re-stimulation in
the presence of monensin for 5 hr (GolgiStop, BD). Cells were then stained for 15 min with viability dye (LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead
Cell Stain Kit, ThermoFisher) at 4�C followed by 30 min incubation with CD45-APC-H7 (BD PharMingen, clone 2D1), CD3-Pacific Blue
(BD PharMingen, clone UCHT1), CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (eBioscience, clone OKT4), CD8-PE (BD Biosciences, clone SK1). Cells were
then fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4�C and washed with BD Perm/Wash
(BD Biosciences). The ICS was performed in BD Perm/Wash with IFN-g-FITC (eBioscience, clone GZ-4) and TNF-a-PE-Cy
(eBioscience, clone MAb11) at 4�C for 30 min. Samples were acquired on a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and the anal-
ysis was performed on FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Tumor volume calculation
The two axes CT scan measurements and the equation for the ellipsoid volume were used to estimate tumor volumes:
V = 4
3 p 3 a 3 b 3 c
Where a and b are the two axes and c is their mean.
Mutation calling
Reads with mapping quality below 30 in the BAM files were filtered out before mutation calling. Somatic single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) were called using MuTect version 1.1.4 (Cibulskis et al., 2013). Identified missense mutations were manually reviewed using
the Integrative Genomics Viewer version 2.3.61 (Robinson et al., 2011; Thorvaldsdo
´ ttir et al., 2013).
Phylogenetic tree inference
The phylogenetic tree was generated as described in Murugaesu et al. (2015). A binary presence/absence matrix of all non-silent
mutations was used as input for the R package phangorn version 2.0.2 (Schliep, 2011). UPGMA hierarchical clustering followed
by the parsimony ratchet analysis (Nixon, 1999) were implemented to build the unrooted tree, and the acctran function was used
to determine branch lengths.

 Relative copy-number alterations
To extract copy number information based on the sequenced exomes of the samples, CopywriteR version 2.2.0 (Kuilman et al., 2015)
was employed in R version 3.2.3. To perform the analysis, mappability information based on the hg19 human reference genome,
20 kb bin size, and default parameters were used.
Absolute copy-number alterations and tumor purity
The absolute copy number profiles and the tumor content of the samples were inferred using the computational method ABSOLUTE
version 1.0.6 (Carter et al., 2012) in R version 3.2.3. ABSOLUTE integrates segmented copy number data, pre-computed statistical
models of recurrent cancer karyotypes, allelic fractions of somatic SNVs, and a probabilistic model framework to jointly estimate
candidate tumor purity, ploidy values, absolute copy number data, and subclonal single nucleotide variants (Carter et al., 2012).
Tumor purity and absolute copy numbers were obtained using ABSOLUTE default parameters, segmented copy number data
derived from CopywriteR, and variant allele frequencies estimated by MuTect (Cibulskis et al., 2013). Best model selection was based
on the guidelines provided by GenePattern and the Broad Cancer Genome Analysis group (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/
software/genepattern/analyzing-absolute-data). Amplifications and deep deletions were defined as copy-number alterations with
at least ± 2 median absolute deviations for each sample copy-number distribution as shown in Figure S1C.
Mutation cellular prevalence
Variant allelic cellular prevalence was estimated using PyClone version 0.13.0 (Roth et al., 2014) in Python version 2.7.11. The
PyClone pipeline analysis was performed jointly on all samples with their tumor purity and absolute copy number alterations esti-
mated by ABSOLUTE. Total copy number prior probability estimate and the PyClone binomial model were used in the analysis.
The mutation variant allele frequencies, closest integer copy number alterations, and tumor purity were used as input. Mutations
not present or called in the sample were set to 0. Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis with Euclidean distance metric and
average linkage clustering was performed on the cellular prevalence values and samples. The SREBF2S120* nonsense mutation
was not included in the PyClone pipeline because its copy number data was closest to 0.
Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis
Single-sample GSEA (Barbie et al., 2009), a modification of standard GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), was performed on RNA
measurements for each sample using the GSVA package version 1.24.1 (Ha
¨ nzelmann et al., 2013) in R version 3.3.2 with parameters:
method = ‘ssgsea’, and tau = 0.25. Normalized enrichment scores were generated for gene sets belonging to KEGG (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al., 2016) and Reactome (Fabregat et al., 2016). The gene sets were obtained from MSigDB database version
5.2 (Liberzon et al., 2011). In order to identify significantly up- and downregulated gene sets, a p-value was calculated for each gene
set based on comparison of the enrichment score with 10,000 permutations of randomly sampled gene sets of the same size. All
genes listed in the expression array were used to derive the permutated gene sets. Finally, the p values were corrected using
Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) method. Enrichment scores were normalized across samples (Tables S2D and S2F) using:
# R 3.4.0
m<-glm(data=data,immunogenicity�clonality+hla_binding,family=binomial)
Immune cell gene-expression signatures
Tumor purity and total immune component in the tumor samples were analyzed using the ESTIMATE algorithm method version 1.0.13
(Yoshihara et al., 2013) on the gene expression data using the option: platform = affymetrix in R version 3.4.0. Then, selection of
probes with the highest variance for each gene was performed to deconvolute cell type specific immune signatures. The deconvo-
lution was achieved using CIBERSORT Jar version 1.05 (https://cibersort.stanford.edu/) with the standard LM22 signature gene file,
and 1000 permutations to calculate deconvolution p values (Newman et al., 2015).
Whole-exome sequencing-based HLA inference
The HLA genotyping algorithms OptiType version 1.0 (Szolek et al., 2014) and POLYSOLVER version 1.0 (Shukla et al., 2015) with
default parameters were employed for HLA class I 4-digit inference. POLYSOLVER HLA-I typing and mutation calling were performed
using samtools version 0.1.19 and novocraft 3.02.05 for the alignment, and MuTect version 1.1.7 for the variant calling.
Neoepitope predictions
In silico mutant peptide generation
To predict neoepitopes, ‘‘wild-type’’ petide 17mers (for HLA-I) and 29mers (for HLA-II) with the affected amino acid in the middle for
each missense mutation were retrieved from the GRCh37.74 human reference proteome (http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-74/
fasta/homo_sapiens/pep/). To generate ‘‘mutant’’ peptides, the affected amino acid was replaced in silico with the corresponding
mutant amino acid.
HLA class I epitope binding predictions
Mutant peptides were used as input for the T Cell Epitope Prediction Tools included in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis
Resource (IEDB) 3.0 (http://www.iedb.org/) (Vita et al., 2015). The HLA class I epitope binding predictions were performed using the
Cell 170, 927–938.e1–e8, August 24, 2017
e5
 HLA-I IEDB algorithms Consensus (Kim et al., 2012) and the artificial neural network (NetMHC) version 3.4 (Lundegaard et al., 2008;
Nielsen et al., 2003) independently yielding same conclusions. For Consensus method – which combines NetMHC, the stabilized
matrix method (Peters and Sette, 2005), and the combinatorial peptide libraries method (Sidney et al., 2008) – 9 mers with a relative
percentile rank % 1% for each HLA-I allele were considered binders to cover most of the potential immune responses as previously
suggested (Kotturi et al., 2007; Moutaftsi et al., 2006). For NetMHC, different cut-off values were evaluated independently and
compared between each other. 9mers with absolute IC50 affinity values % HLA-I specific cutoffs were considered binders (http://
help.iedb.org/entries/23854373) (Paul et al., 2013). HLA-I specific cut-offs were not available for HLA-I C alleles, therefore an
IC50 % 500nM was used instead. All mutant predicted binders were considered for the analyses, i.e., for each missense mutation,
up to six binders for HLA-I (A, B, C alleles) and up to four binders for HLA-II (DQ and DR alleles). Since NetMHC gives actual nM bind-
ing affinities, and HLA-I specific cutoffs have been estimated, we used NetMHC predictions throughout the manuscript.
HLA class II epitope binding predictions
HLA class II epitope binding predictions on 15mers were performed using the HLA-II IEDB algorithms Consensus (Wang et al., 2008,
2010), NetMHCII version 2.2 (Nielsen and Lund, 2009), and Sturniolo (Sturniolo et al., 1999) since these were the only available
methods for the patient HLA-II alleles. The Consensus method used the relative percentile ranks of NetMHCII and Sturniolo, and
15mers with percentile ranks % 1% were considered binders. 15 mers with NetMHCII IC50 % 500nM or Sturniolo percentile
rank % 1% were considered binders, which are more stringent cut-off values than the IEDB recommended 1000 nM for NetMHCII
and % 10% percentile rank for Sturniolo. In the authors’ knowledge, HLA-II specific NetMHCII cut-offs have not been reported.
Neoepitope depletion analysis
TCGA ovarian cancer null model
To analyze neoepitope depletion across the different samples, we followed the method developed by Rooney and colleagues using
only expressed mutations. Commonly mutated genes were not included as indicated (Rooney et al., 2015). The method compares
the samples to a data driven null model. To generate the null model and estimate neoepitope depletion, the nucleotide sequences
flanking each mutation (context of the mutation) are taken into account, thus 192 possible codon mutations are considered
ð64 codons33 possible mutations = 192 possible changesÞ. To control for tumor type differences, we used TCGA ovarian cancer
samples to generate the null model (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011). Context of the mutations for the TCGA ovarian
cancer samples and the case study tumor samples were obtained from the assembly of the Genome Reference Consortium Human
Reference 37. Only TCGA ovarian cancer samples with mutation context in all missense and silent mutations were included (n = 150).
We predicted HLA-I neoepitopes of TCGA ovarian cancer samples using the same approach as for the case study samples
described above.
Neoepitope depletion for each sample was calculated as follows. First, the expected number of missense mutations per silent
mutation ðNsÞ and the expected number of predicted neoepitopes per missense mutation ðBsÞ were calculated using all samples
(TCGA ovarian cancer samples and the patient’s samples), where Ns and Bs are vectors with 192 components each:
Ns =
�missenseAAA/ACA
silentAAA/ACA
; missenseAAA/AGA
silentAAA/AGA
; /; missenseTTT/TGT
silentTTT/TGT
�
Bs =
�neoepitopeAAA/ACA
missenseAAA/ACA
; neoepitopeAAA/AGA
missenseAAA/AGA
; /; neoepitopeTTT/TGT
missenseTTT/TGT
�
Therefore, each component of the vector Ns corresponds to the fraction of missense mutations per silent mutation, and each
component of the vector Bs corresponds to the number of predicted neoepitopes per missense mutation. In both vectors, Ns and
Bs, each component corresponds to the ratio of a particular codon change. The components of Ns can be computed because
the counts of the mutations take into account the three possible reading frames.
Second, the count of silent mutations for each codon change ðSsÞ was calculated for each sample. Thus, Ss is a vector with
192 components where each component is the number of silent mutations with a particular type of codon change for a given sample:
Ss = ðsilentAAA/ACA; silentAAA/AGA; /; silentTTT/TGTÞ
Third, the expected number of missense mutations ðNpredÞ and the expected number of neoepitopes ðBpredÞ were calculated for
each sample.
Npred =
X
Silent
m
SsðmÞ 3 NsðmÞ
Bpred =
X
Silent
m
SsðmÞ 3 NsðmÞ
e6
Cell 170, 927–938.e1–e8, August 24, 2017
 m˛ðAAA/ACA; AAA/AGA; /; TTT/TGTÞ
Where Silent represents the number of silent mutations.
Fourth, the expected and observed numbers of neoepitopes per missense mutation for each sample were calculated as follows:
Expected = Bpred
Npred
Observed = Bobs
Nobs
Where Nobs is the observed number of missense mutations and Bobs the predicted number of neoepitopes for each sample.
Finally, for each sample these ratios were compared and the ratio or observed versus expected neoepitopes calculated:
R = Observed
Expected
Each sample has a ratio R, thus a distribution of log2 ratios is generated as shown in Figure S4C top panel. Empirical two-sided
p-value thresholds were calculated because the ratios do not follow a normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test, D’Agostino-Pearson’s
test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The calculations can be found in Tables S4E–S4G.
Permutation null model
To compare the levels of neoepitope depletion only between the patient’s samples, we generated sample specific null models based
on 150 random unique permutations (redundant permutations excluded) of the samples and their mutations (Table S4H). The number
of permutations was selected based on the number of samples used in the TCGA ovarian cancer neoepitope depletion analysis
(n = 150). Permutated and real samples were analyzed together using the same approach as for the TCGA ovarian cancer neoepitope
depletion analysis described above. A permutation-based null model for each sample was used to control for the number of muta-
tions. Empirical two-sided p-value thresholds were calculated for each distribution because the ratios do not follow a normal distri-
bution (Shapiro-Wilk test, D’Agostino-Pearson’s test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The calculations can be found in Figure S4C
and Table S4I.
Immunogenicity predictions
Immunogenic properties of HLA class I epitopes were estimated in silico using the IEDB resource tool ‘‘MHC I Immunogenicity’’
(http://tools.iedb.org/immunogenicity/), which combines the chemical and physical properties of the amino acids, their position in
the epitope, and the HLA-I subtype allele to estimate the immunogenicity of a given neoepitope-HLA complex (Calis et al., 2013).
To compare clonal and sub-clonal predicted immunogenic properties, we used two approaches:
Absolute score comparison
Two-sided Mann-Whitney rank tests were calculated to compare absolute scores between clonal and sub-clonal predicted binders
and non-binders. In Figures S5A–S5C, n refers to the number of peptides in each category. The Mann-Whitney rank test was
employed because the absolute score distributions do not follow a normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk test, D’Agostino-Pearson’s
test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), and because the number of peptides in each category is different a Wilcoxon signed-rank
test could not be calculated.
Binomial immunogenicity comparison
Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to compare the probability of a peptide having immunogenic properties or not according
to it clonal status and HLA binding affinity. The binomial GLM approach was considered appropriate for this setting because immu-
nogenicity can be considered a binomial process, immunogenic or non-immunogenic. In this scenario, however, the binomial
process corresponds to whether an epitope has biochemical properties associated with immunogenicity (score R 0) that outweigh
properties associated with no immunogenicity (score < 0). Importantly, predicted immunogenicity scores < 0 can still elicit an immu-
nogenic response, but overall they have less immunogenic properties than positive scores (Calis et al., 2013). To further explain
variation in the intrinsic immunogenic predictions we included HLA-I binding affinity (nM) as an explanatory variable. We then calcu-
lated the probability of a peptide having a positive immunogenic score or not based on the samples’ neoepitope data. No interaction
between clonality and HLA-I binding affinity was found, thus the interaction was excluded from the model. The final binomial GLM
formula used is:
# R 3.4.0
m<-glm(data=data,immunogenicity�clonality+hla_binding,family = binomial)
Cell 170, 927–938.e1–e8, August 24, 2017

 TCR sequencing analysis
Analysis of the sequences was performed on the immunoSEQ ANALYZER 3.0 (Adaptive biotechnologies). T cell rearrangements that
are differentially abundant between samples were detected using the Differential Abundance tool by two-sided binomial tests with
Benjamini and Hochberg multiple test correction, q value < 0.01 was considered statistically significant.

 Figure S4. Neoepitope Distributions and HLA-I Neoepitope Depletion Analysis, Related to Figure 4 and Table S4
(A) Number of unique and overlapping expressed missense mutations, HLA-I and II neoepitopes between samples (Table S4D).
(B) Correlations between expressed missense mutations and predicted HLA-I neoepitopes using NetMHC applied to TCGA ovarian samples (n = 150) and the
primary and metastatic tumors (Tables S4E–S4G). KDE = kernel density estimate.
(C) Top: Estimated neoepitope deviation from expected in the five tumor samples compared to TCGA ovarian cancer samples (n = 150). The expected number of
neoepitopes was calculated by taking into account the expected number of missense mutations and the number of silent mutations according to Rooney et al.,
2015 (see STAR Methods). Bottom: Neoepitope depletion analysis of 150 random unique permutations of the patient’s tumors (primary, spleen, RUQ, liver, and
vaginal cuff) and their mutations. Each sample was compared against its own 150 unique permutations to control for the number of mutations (Tables S4H and
S4I). Two-sided empirical p values were calculated from each distribution.

Figure S5. Predicted Immunogenicity of HLA Class I Neoepitopes, Related to Figures 1 and 4 and Tables S1 and S4
(A) Predicted immunogenic properties of trunk (clonal) and private HLA-I neoepitopes. Positive immunogenicity scores have biochemical properties associated
with higher immunogenicity that outweigh properties associated with lower immunogenicity, and vice versa for negative scores (Calis et al., 2013). Horizontal lines
within violin plots show the median and interquartile range of the data distribution.
(legend continued on next page)
 (B and C) Comparison between clonal and sub-clonal (including shared between two or more samples but not all) predicted immunogenicity of predicted binders
and non-binders (two-sided Mann-Whitney rank test). Horizontal lines within violin plots show the median and interquartile range of the data distribution.
(D–F) Probability of an HLA-I neoepitope having immunogenic properties considering its clonality and HLA-I binding affinity using the neoepitope data in (A), (B),
and (C), respectively. Clonal neoepitopes have a lower probability of having immunogenic properties than sub-clonal predicted binders (chi-square test, p = 0.02).
For non-binders (NetMHC score > HLA-I specific cutoff), clonal neoepitopes have a higher probability of having immunogenic properties (chi-square test,
p = 0.003), as well as peptides with higher HLA-I affinities (chi-square test, p = 0.0001), although the absolute differences are minor. No significant interaction
between clonality and predicted HLA-I binding affinity was detected for either binders or non-binders. GLM = generalized linear model.

 Figure S7. Overall Associations between Tumor Fates and Tumor-Immune Microenvironmental Features, Related to Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4
and Tables S1, S2, S3, and S4
Cellular and molecular associations with change in tumor growth. Change in tumor growth (y axis) was calculated by dividing the tumor volume at CT scan 11 by
the tumor volume at CT scan 10 (Figure 1B). Fitted curves are 2nd order polynomial regression lines plotted for trend visualization rather than prediction purposes.
Capase 1 and 4 are considered inflammatory caspases involved in a type of apoptosis related to immune response called pyroptosis. The enrichment score x axis
and the q-values come from the ssGSEA analysis. HLA-I genes include HLA-A, B, C, E, and F. HLA-II genes include HLA-DPA1, DMA, DRA, DQA1, DMB, DPB1,
DQB2, DRB5, DRB1, DQB1, and DOA.
