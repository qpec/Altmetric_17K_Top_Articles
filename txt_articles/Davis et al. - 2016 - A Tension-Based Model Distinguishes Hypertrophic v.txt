SUMMARY
The heart either hypertrophies or dilates in response
to familial mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric
proteins, which are responsible for contraction and
pumping. These mutations typically alter calcium-
dependent tension generation within the sarco-
meres, but how this translates into the spectrum of
hypertrophic versus dilated cardiomyopathy is un-
known. By generating a series of cardiac-specific
mouse models that permit the systematic tuning of
sarcomeric tension generation and calcium fluxing,
we identify a significant relationship between the
magnitude of tension developed over time and
heart growth. When formulated into a computational
model, the integral of myofilament tension devel-
opment predicts hypertrophic and dilated cardio-
myopathies in mice associated with essentially any
sarcomeric gene mutations, but also accurately pre-
dicts human cardiac phenotypes from data gener-
ated in induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived myo-
cytes from familial cardiomyopathy patients. This
tension-based model also has the potential to inform
pharmacologic treatment options in cardiomyopathy
patients.
INTRODUCTION
Inherited cardiomyopathy defines a heterogeneous group of
heart muscle diseases that affects 1:500 people in the general
population (McNally et al., 2013). There are two primary clinical
phenotypes that include hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM)
cardiomyopathy. Morphologically, HCM is characterized by
asymmetric heart growth with a reduction in ventricular chamber
dimension, thickening of the interventricular septum, and dia-
stolic dysfunction with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death
due to arrhythmia (Fatkin and Graham, 2002). By comparison,
DCM is defined by an enlarged left ventricular chamber that is
accompanied by a type of dilated or eccentric ‘‘hypertrophy’’
in which myocytes typically lengthen resulting in reduced sys-
tolic function (McNally et al., 2013). In either case, there is no
cure for these two disease states, with the only effective long-
term treatment being transplantation (Tardiff et al., 2015).
Familial HCM and DCM arise from nearly 1,500 distinct muta-
tions in the genes that encode for proteins of the sarcomere
(McNally et al., 2013). The sarcomere is the basic unit in muscle
that generates tension and subsequent contraction through a
process known as excitation-contraction coupling. In the heart,
depolarization of the muscle cell membrane results in Ca2+
influx through sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channels that then
induces a much larger release of Ca2+ from the intracellular
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) network. This Ca2+ then binds the
sarcomeric protein cardiac troponin C (cTnC) to initiate cross-
bridge cycling between myosin and actin, which then generates
force and cellular shortening (Bers, 2002). During relaxation,
Ca2+ is transported back into the SR by the SR Ca2+ ATPase2
(SERCA2), which lowers cytosolic Ca2+, allowing for increased
Ca2+ dissociation from cTnC and a reduction in crossbridge
adherence and sarcomeric tension (Bers, 2002; Gordon et al.,
2000).
Sarcomeric gene mutations typically disrupt the highly tuned
balance between mechanical force generation and Ca2+-cycling
dynamics. For example, HCM-related mutations sensitize the
myofilaments toward greater Ca2+ adherence, thereby prolong-
ing mechanical relaxation and delaying Ca2+ reuptake into the
SR. DCM-linked mutations typically desensitize the myofila-
ments to Ca2, requiring higher levels of free cytosolic Ca2+ for
tension generation, and Ca2+ more rapidly dissociates from the
sarcomere during relaxation. However, it is unknown how such
mutations program a continuum of cardiac remodeling from se-
vere hypertrophic growth with myocyte thickening to extreme
dilation and cellular lengthening (Kehat and Molkentin, 2010;
McNally et al., 2013). A lack of such understanding makes it

 difficult to predict clinical outcomes of genotyped patients
treated with standard-of-care medications used in the heart fail-
ure setting. Indeed, pediatric patients with familial HCM appear
to do worse when treated with Ca2+ channel blockers (Ost-
man-Smith, 2010), and b-adrenergic receptor blockers do not
reduce adult HCM disease progression and hypertrophy (Ham-
ada et al., 2014; Spoladore et al., 2012).
Using an array of genetically altered mice, we systematically
altered the Ca2+-tension relationship in vivo with quantifiable
changes in either myofilament tension generation or Ca2+ tran-
sient kinetics to assess the ramifications on cardiac remodeling
and disease. Experimental data from this approach was used to
develop a mathematical index that predicts if the heart will un-
dergo either hypertrophic or dilated cardiac growth through
two signaling pathways that directly interpret the area under
the tension/shortening curve. This index also predicts the type
of cardiac growth associated with select pharmacotherapies in
mice with simulated HCM or DCM mutations in sarcomeric pro-
teins. Moreover, the tension index calculated from human HCM
and DCM cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) accurately predicts a patient’s known clinical
phenotype.
RESULTS
Altering Myofilament Ca2+ Sensitivity In Vivo with
Designed cTnC Variants
It remains unclear how mutations in sarcomeric genes mediate
differential heart growth typical of familial HCM and DCM.
Two diametrically opposed cTnC (Tnnc1 gene) variant proteins
were used that quantitatively shift Ca2+-binding and tension-pro-
ducing characteristics of the myofilaments at a set amount on
either side of normal to correlate with cardiac structural remod-
eling (Kreutziger et al., 2011; Tikunova and Davis, 2004). Isolated
adult rat cardiomyocytes were first infected with recombinant
adenovirus-encoding b-galactosidase (bgal, control for virus
infection) and FLAG-epitope-tagged wild-type (WT), L48Q, or
I61Q cTnC mutants. At 3 days post infection, approximately
50% of endogenous cTnC was replaced with either the FLAG-
tagged WT, L48Q, or I61Q cTnC, without changes in other sarco-
meric proteins like tropomyosin (Tm) or a-actinin (Figure 1A).
Moreover, there was no difference in the relative expression
of the cTnC variants between intact and fully permeable
myocytes, suggesting that the FLAG-tagged cTnC constructs
were incorporating into the sarcomeres (Figure 1A). Indeed,

 co-immunoprecipitating (coIP) the troponin complex with anti-
cTnT demonstrated that the two FLAG-tagged mutants were
each incorporated into the troponin complex at roughly the
same level (Figure 1B).
In myocyte contractile assays, L48Q cTnC significantly
increased cellular fractional shortening in the absence of
changes in Ca2+ transient amplitude (data not shown), as previ-
ously reported (Feest et al., 2014). Acute expression of I61Q
cTnC caused a modest reduction in fractional shortening with
no changes in Ca2+ transient amplitude, reflecting the decreased
sensitivity of the myofilaments to Ca2+ (data not shown). In terms
of kinetics, L48Q cTnC significantly slowed myocyte relaxation
and Ca2+ decay, while I61Q cTnC accelerated both of these pa-
rameters (Figures 1C and 1D). Together, these data suggest that
sarcomeric incorporation of the L48Q or I61Q cTnC variants
effectively redistributes Ca2+ either onto the sarcomere to
enhance tension generation (L48Q cTnC) or freely into the
cytosol, thereby decreasing overall tension generation (I61Q
cTnC).
To understand the in vivo consequence associated with
directionally adjusting myofilament Ca2+-mechanical coupling,
transgenic mice (TG) were generated with cardiac-specific
expression of L48Q, I61Q, or WT cTnC using a tetracycline bi-
transgenic inducible system (Figure 1E). All of the constructs
were tagged with a FLAG epitope to determine percent replace-
ment with the transgene-encoded protein (Figure 1E). Previous
work demonstrated that expression of an epitope-tagged cTnC
is innocuous (Davis and Metzger, 2010). Replacement of the
endogenous cTnC with the epitope-tagged versions was as-
sessed by western blotting at 1 month of age (Figure 1F). Over-
expression of WT, L48Q, and I61Q cTnC in mice averaged
50%, 40%, and 45% stoichiometric replacement, respectively
(Figure 1F, slower migrating band is FLAG-tagged). In the
absence of the tTA (tetracycline transactivator) transgene,
both the L48Q and I61Q responder lines had a minor degree of
leak resulting in 5%–10% replacement at baseline (Figure 1F).
The inducibility feature of this bi-transgenic system was not em-
ployed given that constitutive expression of cTnC WT and the
two variants did not reduce birth rates of the mice.
Using data from these cTnC-expressing TG mice, we refined
an existing computational model of myocyte contraction to
simulate Ca2+ transients and tension dynamics (Negroni and
Lascano, 2008). These simulations predicted that L48Q prolongs
the time a myocyte experiences elevated tension with a set
amount of Ca2+, as well as slowed relaxation, while I61Q reduced
tension and hastened relaxation for the same amount of Ca2+
(Figures 1G and 1H). Relative to WT, the L48Q Ca2+ transient
also had slower decay kinetics, while the I61Q variant invoked
a greater transient with a shortened decay time (Figure 1H). A
linear regression analysis was used to assess how accurately
values from the Ca2+- and myocyte-shortening simulations pre-
dicted actual values from the cTnC variants, and in both cases,
the R2 values were significant and >0.6, suggesting a strong
correlation (Figures S1A–S1D). Together, these simulations
suggested a highly integrated relationship between changes
in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and tension production with
reflexive changes in the Ca2+ transient to maintain a contractile
set-point.
L48Q cTnC Predisposes to Hypertrophic Remodeling
Cardiac myocytes isolated from L48Q mice had increased
fractional shortening despite smaller Ca2+ amplitudes compared
with control myocytes, confirming that this mutation enhances
myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (Figures 2A and 2B). L48Q myo-
cytes also had significantly slower relaxation and rate of Ca2+
transient decay in comparison to the tTA and WT cTnC controls
(Figures 2C and 2D). Despite prolonged relaxation, L48Q TG
mice had hyperfunctional hearts (Figure 2E) with no change
in cardiac growth or chamber dimensions up to 1 year of age
(Figures 2F–2I).
There are other examples of TG and knockin mouse models of
HCM that fail to phenocopy the asymmetric hypertrophic thick-
ening of the myocardium observed in HCM patients, including
independently generated L48Q TG mice (Shettigar et al., 2016;
Davis et al., 2012; Michele et al., 2002). Thus, we hypothesized
that the effects of L48Q cTnC are masked by the high contractile
state and heart rate of the mouse, with accelerated diastolic
function through increase of Ca2+ reuptake by SERCA2 and
desensitization of the sarcomere to Ca2+ by phosphorylating
the amino terminal serine residues (23/24) on cTnI (Metzger
and Westfall, 2004). We reasoned that tempering the adrenergic
state of the mouse with chronic delivery of the b-receptor antag-
onist metoprolol might unmask the effects of L48Q cTnC in vivo.
While 3 months of metoprolol treatment in L48Q TG mice had no
effect on systolic performance (Figure 2J), these mice now
developed significant heart remodeling in which both the left
ventricular (LV) chamber dimension, septal wall thickness, and
cardiac mass became significantly larger (Figures 2K–2N).
In contrast, metoprolol delivery to tTA control mice had negli-
gible effects on ventricular performance or cardiac remodeling
(Figure 2J–2N).
Because the effects of metoprolol were unexpected, we
repeated this entire experimental paradigm using adeno-associ-
ated virus (AAV) serotype 6 to overexpress either WT cTnC or
L48Q cTnC in mice for the first time at 8 weeks of age (each
was FLAG-tagged). Infected mice were then given metoprolol-
treated water for 1 month. This in-vivo-gene-transfer strategy
produced 50%–60% and 40%–50% replacement of native
cTnC with WT cTnC and L48Q cTnC, respectively (Figure S2A).
Similar to results in the TG mice, the acutely infected L48Q
mice developed a significant increase in septal and posterior
wall thickness, as well as increased ventricular mass with meto-
prolol administration, while WT AAV-cTnC expressing mice
showed no effect (Figures S2B–S2D). Consistent with this pro-
file, acute metoprolol treatment further slowed L48Q cellular
relaxation time and Ca2+ re-uptake in isolated cardiomyocytes,
an effect that was also seen in tTA control myocytes, albeit to
a lesser extent (Figures 2O and 2P).
To further examine this effect observed with b-blockers,
a cohort of AAV-infected WT cTnC and L48Q mice were also
chronically treated with the sinoatrial-node antagonist ivabra-
dine (10 mg/kg/day) to decrease chronotropy and increase the
time in diastole. Similar to the effects of b-blockers, ivabradine
treatment caused a mild hypertrophic growth of the septal
and posterior walls and an increased cardiac mass in L48Q-in-
fected mice, but not in WT cTnC infected mice (Figures S2E–
S2G). Together, these data suggest that prolonging mechanical

 tension initiates growth signaling, which in the mouse is compen-
sated by an increase in contractile drive.
The converse experiments were also performed, in which
the high cardiac contractile set-point of the mouse was
mimicked in isolated myocytes by applying the b-adrenergic
agonist isoproterenol. As expected, isoproterenol corrected
the slowed relaxation and Ca2+ decay times in L48Q myocytes
to vehicle-treated tTA values (Figures 2O and 2P). To corrobo-
rate these data, the Ca2+-binding affinity of cTnC and L48Q
cTnC were examined in the presence of phosphorylated or
non-phosphorylated cTnI using steady-state fluorescence spec-
troscopy. Phosphorylated cTnI caused a decreased Ca2+-bind-
ing affinity of both WT cTnC and L48Q cTnC, as indicated by the
rightward shift in binding fluorescence for a given Ca2+ concen-
tration (pCa, Figure 2Q). Similar to the cell-shortening assay,
phosphorylated cTnI normalized L48Q-cTnC-Ca2+-binding affin-
ity back to WT with non-phosphorylated cTnI levels (Figure 2Q).
L48Q mice were also subjected to 2 weeks of transverse
aortic constriction (TAC) to induce pressure overload on the
heart, which increased ventricular fractional shortening in control
mice but had little effect on L48Q mutant mice that were already
hyperfunctional (Figure 2R). While pressure overload induced hy-
pertrophy in tTA control mice, it produced significantly greater
hypertrophy in L48Q mice (Figures 2S and 2T), suggesting
that greater Ca2+ binding to the sarcomeric regulatory proteins
predisposes the heart to the hypertrophic growth response,
which likely occurs by further increasing the net tension of the
myofilaments.
I61Q cTnC Induces Dilated Heart Growth
The I61Q TG mouse has decreased Ca2+-myofilament-binding
affinity (Kreutziger et al., 2011), thereby recapitulating what might
happen in familial DCM. I61Q TG mice have reduced myocyte
shortening despite a compensatory increase in the Ca2+-tran-
sient amplitude when compared with tTA control myocytes
(Figures 3A and 3B). I61Q mutant myocytes also show faster
relaxation times and Ca2+ decay kinetics compared to tTA myo-
cytes (Figures 3C and 3D). At baseline, myocytes from I61Q TG
mice have significantly elongated sarcomeres compared to tTA
controls (Figure 3E), which is consistent with a general decrease
in thin filament activation, despite increased diastolic Ca2+ con-
centration (Figure 3F). In vivo, I61Q cTnC TG mice showed
reduced cardiac function (Figures 3G and 3H) and a dilated
phenotype characterized by increased diastolic LV chamber
dimension and decreased septal wall thickness compared to
age-matched tTA littermates (Figures 3I–3K). Hearts harvested
from I61Q mice also had increased cardiac mass (Figure 3L)
and increased myocyte length-to-width ratios, suggestive of
dilated eccentric growth remodeling (Figures 3M and 3N). These
mice also have early mortality, in which a substantial fraction of
the cohort died by 4 months of age with no mouse surviving
beyond 8 months (Figure 3O). Due to the early mortality of these
mice, all of the aforementioned measurements were made at
6–8 weeks of age.
Enhancing Myofilament Crossbridge Binding Corrects
I61Q Disease
Since the I61Q mutation reduces myofilament tension, we
reasoned that a competing sarcomeric mutation that increased
myofilament tension might nullify the disease effect. Hence, we
employed a well-characterized mouse model of HCM, which is
due to a mutation in Myh6 at position 403 (R403Q) that promotes
more time in a force-generating state with prolonged relaxation
(Geisterfer-Lowrance et al., 1996). I61Q TG offspring heterozy-
gous for the R403Q mutation showed significantly improved
fractional shortening, reduced left ventricle chamber dilation,
and normalization of septal thickness, but no change in LV wall
thickness (Figures 4A–4D). Remarkably, I61Q-R403Q+/� mice
showed a 40% reduction in overall heart growth when compared
to the I61Q TG mice alone (Figures 4E and 4G). The presence of
R403Q mutant Myh6 allele also prolonged the survival of I61Q
mice, collectively demonstrating that enhancing the tension-
producing qualities of the myofilaments in ‘‘trans’’ could partially
compensate for less cTnC Ca2+ binding (Figure 4F).
Directional Shifts in Ca2+ Tension Underlie Cardiac
Growth
The correction of I61Q-dependent dilated heart growth with the
R403Q mutant myosin allele suggests that the myocyte changes
its growth characteristics by sensing deviations in the time and
magnitude of tension generated at a given cytosolic Ca2+ con-
centration. To examine this hypothesis, we computationally
simulated the twitch force and Ca2+ transient for myocytes that
have rapid Ca2+ dissociation from the sarcomere due to the
combined effects of I61Q cTnC and enhanced SR Ca2+ reup-
take. Biologically, this can be achieved by increasing the Ca2+-
binding affinity of SERCA2 through the loss of its regulatory
protein, phospholamban (Pln gene). Our model predicts that
such an increase in SERCA2 activity would reduce the time for
tension generation (Figure 5A, I61Q-Pln�/�) due to the rapid

 re-uptake of cytosolic Ca2+ in I61Q cTnC mice (Figure S3A), thus
producing even greater dilated hypertrophic growth. In the
context of L48Q cTnC, this same enhancement in SERCA2 activ-
ity, due to loss of phospholamban, is predicted to reduce tension
time and hasten the Ca2+ transient decay, thereby correcting the
tension-Ca2+ transients toward tTA WT values (Figures 5B
and S3B).
To experimentally verify the model’s predictions, I61Q and
L48Q TG mice were crossed with Pln�/� mice. Loss of phospho-
lamban had no cardiac growth effect on the benign phenotype of
L48Q mice, with respect to LV chamber size, septal thickness, or
overall heart weight (Figures 5C–5E). However, loss of phospho-
lamban did cause greater cardiac hypertrophy with increased
septal thickness and overall heart weight in I61Q TG mice as pre-
dicted (Figures 5C–5E). Contractile measurements made in my-
ocytes isolated from I61Q-Pln�/� mice showed faster mechani-
cal relaxation and Ca2+ transient decay times compared to
I61Q myocytes, as predicted with our computational simulations
(Figures S3C and S3D). Hence, loss of Pln�/� in I61Q mice further
accelerated Ca2+ transient decay, thereby exacerbating the ten-
sion deficits in an already tension-poor genetic background,
which correlated with greater disease and remodeling.
Using an opposing approach, we simulated the effects of
decreasing SERCA2 pump function in the context of I61Q and
L48Q cTnC mutant phenotypes, which was compared to data
in Atp2a2 (SERCA2a) heterozygous mice. Here, the model pre-
dicts that increasing the time of free cytosolic Ca2+ due to
reduced activity of SERCA2, in the presence of the I61Q muta-
tion, would augment the time-force development relationship,
thereby partially protecting from dilated growth in I61Q mice (Fig-
ures 5F and S3F). In contrast, decreasing SERCA2 activity in the
presence of L48Q cTnC more than doubled the area under the
tension curve and Ca2+ transient, slowing mechanical and Ca2+
decay, in comparison to simulations run with just L48Q (Figure 5G
and S3G). Indeed, experimental data from I61Q-Atp2a2+/� mice
showed significantly reduced ventricular chamber dilation,

 although without a change in LV wall or septal thicknesses or
heart weights (Figures 5H–5K). The lack of a decrease in absolute
heart weight appears to be due to a shift in the cardiac growth
profile from a dilated program to more of a concentric hypertro-
phic program. In comparison, reduction in SERCA2 activity in
the L48Q cTnC TG background produced a thickening hypertro-
phic response for the firsttime, as measured by LVwall and septal
thicknesses and greater overall heart weights without a change in
LV chamber size (Figures 5H–5K). Together with the data
observed in Pln�/� mice, the overall results suggest that altered
myofilament Ca2+-binding properties are directly linked to SR
Ca2+ fluxing and total free cytosolic Ca2+ within the cardiomyo-
cyte, as suggested by a previously proposed disease-sensing
mechanism (Fatkin et al., 2000).
Tension-Ca2+ Growth through Calcineurin and ERK1/2
Signaling
An important regulator of heart growth is through the Ca2+-
responsive serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin and its
downstream transcriptional effector nuclear factor of activated
T cells (NFAT) (Houser and Molkentin, 2008). Feline cardiac my-
ocytes were adenovirally infected with both I61Q cTnC and an
NFATc3-GFP reporter for 3 days to achieve �60% replacement
of native cTnC, which was then chronically paced in culture
to partially activate calcineurin-NFAT signaling as previously
shown (Makarewich et al., 2012). Feline myocytes were used
because of their low net cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations that
reduce baseline NFAT translocation. Increases in pacing fre-
quency caused a significantly greater translocation of NFATc3-
GFP into the nucleus in myocytes expressing I61Q cTnC
compared with WT cTnC control infection, suggesting that the
Ca2+ dysregulation by I61Q cTnC enhances calcineurin activity

(Figure 6A). Remarkably, L48Q infection
also
promoted
greater
NFATc3-GFP
translocation in this assay (data not
shown; Discussion). With respect to the
growth response in vivo, I61Q TG mice lacking the catalytic
subunit of calcineurin Ab (Ppp3cb�/�) were examined for altered
cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. Here, a reduction of calci-
neurin activity in I61Q TG mice failed to improve systolic function
(Figure 6B) or alter LV chamber dilation or septal thickness (Fig-
ures 6C and 6D). However, cardiac mass was reduced to near
normal levels, suggesting that calcineurin functions as a general-
ized growth signal in DCM, but does not affect the geometric re-
modeling of that growth (Figure 6E).
Previous studies identified a role for extracellular signal-
related kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) in coordinating long versus short
axis myocyte growth through the serial (eccentric growth) or par-
allel (concentric growth) addition of sarcomeres within individual
cardiomyocytes (Bueno et al., 2000; Kehat et al., 2011). To deter-
mine if ERK1/2 signaling participates in coordinating the type of
geometric growth associated with the I61Q mutation in the heart,
isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes were adenovirally trans-
duced with WT or I61Q cTnC and subjected to 48 hr of chronic
pacing (2 Hz). Pacing of WT cTnC myocytes caused ERK1/2 to
translocate to the nucleus, which was inhibited in the presence
of I61Q cTnC mutant (Figures 6F and 6G). Notably, the retention
of ERK1/2 in the cytosol corresponded to a significant increase
in I61Q myocyte length, while cTnC-control-infected myocytes
remained unchanged (Figure 6H). These results suggest that
the I61Q-dependent loss of diastolic tension impairs ERK1/2
signaling and initiates a default pathway for myocyte lengthening
hypertrophy (Discussion).
To examine the role of ERK1/2 signaling in the whole heart, TG
mice expressing activated MEK1, which directly mediates ERK1/
2 activation, were crossed into the I61Q TG background. Sur-
prisingly, MEK1 expression rescued fractional shortening in
I61Q mice, resulting in hyperdynamic systolic function similar
Cell 165, 1147–1159, May 19, 2016

 to mice expressing the MEK1 TG alone (Figure 6I). I61Q-MEK1
double TG mice still have �45% replacement of native cTnC
with I61Q cTnC (data not shown), although they now have normal
LV chamber dimensions and increased septal and LV wall thick-
nesses, compared to I61Q TG mice (Figures 6J–6L). Importantly,
increased ERK1/2 signaling did not change the increase in abso-
lute cardiac mass associated with the I61Q mutation, suggesting
that ERK1/2 controls the direction of geometric growth rather
than magnitude (Figure 6M).
Developing a Predictive Index of Cardiac Remodeling
Four
independent
and
non-integrated
parameters
were
modeled, such as myocyte shortening, 90% relaxation time,
Ca2+-transient amplitude, and 90% Ca2+ decay time, to poten-
tially predict changes in ventricular mass or chamber size as
experimentally measured throughout this manuscript (Figures
S4A–S4L). Linear regression analysis of these four kinetic- and
amplitude-based parameters were unsuccessful in predicting
ventricular mass (heart weight normalized to body weight, HW/
BW); however, mechanical relaxation and Ca2+ decay kinetics
significantly predicted septal and posterior wall thickness, while
mechanical relaxation predicted diastolic dimension (Figures
S4E, S4F, and S4L).
To generate a more penetrant predictive index, we first
normalized the mean twitch (or shortening) and Ca2+ transients
to WT values, and then calculated an integral value for each,
which is the total area under the curve of tension or Ca2+, as a
function of time (Experimental Procedures). This analysis
demonstrated that the integrated tension curve predicted all of
the remodeling parameters examined here including ventricular

 mass (Figures S5A–S5C), which we were unable to predict from
non-integrated kinetic or magnitude parameters (Figure S4). By
contrast, the integrated Ca2+ area was not predictive of any
growth parameters used in this analysis, suggesting that the my-
ocytes primarily respond to the duration and magnitude of me-
chanical tension in their growth decisions (Figures S5D–S5F).
This linear regression analysis was further refined by testing
the computer-simulated contractions for the I61Q-Atp2a2+/�
and L48Q-Atp2a2+/� crosses, and indeed, integrated tension,
but not Ca2+, predicted the changes in ventricular chamber
dimension, wall thickness, and cardiac mass observed in these
mice (Figures S5A–S5F).
To simplify the relationships discussed above, we assembled
the information from these linear regressions into a tension index
that predicts not only the type of cardiac remodeling, but also its
magnitude. For this refined index, the average integrated tension
for the WT/non-diseased condition was valued at zero, equating
to no hypertrophic growth. To place genetically manipulated
mice on the index, the mean WT/non-diseased force areas
were subtracted from their integrated tension values, as illus-
trated with I61Q versus WT in Figure 7A. With this refined index,
dilated hypertrophy is represented by negative values, while
positive values represent concentric hypertrophy. For example,
the L48Q mutant scored a positive value on the tension index

 with thickening hypertrophy that typifies HCM, while the I61Q
mutant scored a negative value that yields dilated or eccentric
heart growth and DCM (Figure 7B). The magnitude of the value
beyond zero then reflects the severity of cardiac remodeling
and hypertrophy.
To demonstrate the predictive breadth of this tension (force)-
integration method, we also assessed an independent mouse
model of DCM derived from a truncation mutation in cardiac
troponin T (D210 TnT) as well as a restrictive cardiomyopathy
(RCM) model from a missense mutation in cardiac troponin I
(R193H TnI). The integrated tension was calculated from the
force-time curve data published for D210 and non-TG myocytes,
which produced a negative score similar to the value obtained
for I61Q TG mice (Figure 7C). The RCM-linked mutant R193H
TnI, which in mice causes high-end diastolic pressure and no
changes in ventricular growth, yielded a positive score that
was slightly greater than the L48Q cTnC mutant (Figure 7C).
With the advent of iPSC technology, it is possible to generate
cardiomyocytes from patient-derived fibroblasts to directly mea-
sure myocyte twitch forces. Here, contractile force and Ca2+
transients were measured from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes
from two HCM and two DCM patients with mutations in the
following genes: MYH7 gene (R663H, HCM) (Lan et al., 2013),
MYBPC3 (R943ter, HCM), TNNT2 (R173W,DCM) (Sun et al.,
2012), and PLN (R9C, DCM). Figures S6A and S6B show the
mean twitch (stress) and Ca2+ transients measured across
iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from the genotyped cardiomyo-
pathic and non-diseased patients. The integrated-tension index
accurately predicted the known clinical phenotype for each of
the patients when normalized to healthy iPSCs-derived cardio-
myocytes (Figure 7C). We also examined the predictive ability
of the Ca2+ integral to align with HCM or DCM phenotypes,
and again observed that Ca2+-handling alterations failed to
correlate with either clinical diagnosis (Figures S6C and S6D).
DISCUSSION
Here, we engineered a refined predictive index of cardiac re-
modeling due to mutations in sarcomeric genes that underlie fa-
milial HCM and DCM, in part by collecting experimental data with
cTnC variants that shift its Ca2+-binding properties and associ-
ated myofilament tension dynamics on either side of normal.
While TNNC1 human mutations are rare in humans, they have
been attributed to causing HCM or DCM (Kalyva et al., 2014).
We also used mutant cTnCs because they represent the prox-
imal Ca2+-binding element of the sarcomere, hence allowing
for a more direct modulation of the Ca2+-tension relationship
without potential confounding effects. The L48Q and I61Q vari-
ants used here have been rigorously quantified for their effects
on tension and Ca2+-handling dynamics (Kreutziger et al.,
2011; Parvatiyar et al., 2010; Tikunova and Davis, 2004; Wang
et al., 2012; Feest et al., 2014).
Perturbations in the tension dynamic on either side of zero
equally initiated calcineurin-dependent increases in cardiac
mass (Figure 7B). Indeed, stimulation-frequency-dependent
translocation of NFAT to the nucleus was observed with both a
gain and loss in myofilament activation. While not tested here,
there are several regulators of NFAT translocation and cardiac
hypertrophy, including glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b)
that may help account for this feature, even in an HCM back-
ground (Luckey et al., 2009). Our observations that loss of the
Ppp3cb gene reduces growth in the I61Q background, but not

Growth for Familial Cardiomyopathy-Linked
Mutations

amplitude. Calculation of the tension index for
the I61Q mutant, in which WT-integrated tension
(WTarea) is subtracted from I61Q-integrated ten-
sion (I61Qarea), as depicted in blue text, and the
resulting value is the net area placed on the
hypertrophic growth continuum depicted in (B)
and (C).
(B) Net integrated tension shown in (A) as a line
chart with WT being zero, the I61Q having a
negative total value of �1.6 3 104 that predicts
dilated heart growth, and L48Q being a positive
value of +1.5 3 104 predicting thickening hyper-
trophy. ERK1/2 signaling is reduced by more
negative values, which reduces myocyte width,
but is increased with positive values, leading to
thickening growth. Calcineurin signaling is lowest
at zero, yet increased by both positive and nega-
tive values.
(C) The same integrated tension as depicted in (B)
expanded to include the predicted scores for other
sarcomeric mutations in mice (below the line) and from four patients clinically diagnosed with either HCM or DCM (two each, above the line). The magnitude of the
value reflects the degree of disease severity as either concentric hypertrophy (HCM remodeling) or dilated, eccentric (DCM) growth.

 ventricular remodeling, is consistent with an array of past data in
the literature implicating calcineurin-NFAT signaling as a primary
determinant of generalized cardiac hypertrophy (Houser and
Molkentin, 2008). However, this is not to contend that calcineurin
pharmacologic inhibitors, such as cyclosporine A, should be
considered as a therapeutic option, as this drug worsened the
pathology of R403Q mutant mice (Fatkin et al., 2000).
MEK1-ERK1/2 signaling appears to be responsible for the
directionality of cardiac growth by mediating the addition of sar-
comeres in parallel to ‘‘thicken’’ cardiomyocytes, while inhibition
of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling results in a default program of myocyte
elongation due to addition of sarcomeres in series (Kehat et al.,
2011). Our model predicts that ERK1/2 signaling is activated in
HCM models that have a positive tension-integral value, yet
inhibited for negative values, such as observed in DCM (Fig-
ure 7B). Experimentally, there was minimal nuclear translocation
of ERK1/2 in I61Q myocytes, which correlated to in vivo dilated
growth through myocyte elongation (Figures 6F–6H). This effect
of I61Q was completely reversed by MEK1 overexpression,
which now showed only concentric remodeling and myocyte
thickening, similar to MEK1 alone (Figures 6J–6M). Our previous
work showed that loss of ERK1/2 from the heart resulted in a pro-
gram of extreme cardiac dilation due to addition of sarcomeres in
series in individual myocytes and their elongation, further indi-
cating that ERK1/2 can be primary signaling determinants under-
lying the type of cardiac growth that occurs to a given stressed
stated (Kehat and Molkentin, 2010; Kehat et al., 2011).
Because L48Q myocytes failed to hypertrophy, we substituted
a more potent mutant in the cTnI-encoding gene that causes
myocyte thickening due to increased diastolic tension and pres-
sures in mice (Davis et al., 2007, 2008). Adenoviral gene transfer
of R193H cTnI caused a significant translocation of ERK1/2 to
the nucleus in adult rat myocytes (Figure S7A and S7B). This
ERK1/2 translocation profile with R193H expression corre-
sponded to reduced myocyte length and increased width both
at baseline and after chronic pacing (Figure S7C). Co-transduc-
tion of R193H cTnI and a dominant-negative MEK1 (DnMEK1)-
encoding
adenovirus
blocked
ERK1/2
translocation
and
reduced the concentric phenotype observed in R193H myocytes
(Figure S7B and S7C). In Figure 7C, the tension integral was
calculated for this mutant using previously published data (Davis
et al., 2007, 2012), and it has a positive remodeling score, indic-
ative of predisposing to HCM. Interestingly, the reported patient
genotyped with R193H TnI started with a clinical diagnosis of
RCM (Mogensen et al., 2003) but later transitioned to HCM,
which would have been the initial prediction by our integrated-
tension index.
Experimentally correcting for compensation mediated by
b-adrenergic tone by chronically administering b-blockers to
L48Q mice caused their hearts to concentrically remodel for
the first time (Figures 2L, 2N, and S2B–S2D). The net tension in-
tegral calculated for L48Q with b-blocker therapy is much higher
than either the L48Q or R193H mutations on the thickening hy-
pertrophy spectrum shown on the continuum in Figure 7C, sug-
gesting that b-blocker therapy in the mouse causes disease
likely due to the very short diastolic window in this species.
Use of ivabradine as an independent pharmacologic approach,
which similarly slows the contractile cycle producing more net
time under tension in the mouse, also produced the same effect
as b-blockers in unmasking the concentric hypertrophic poten-
tial of the L48Q mutation. While this disease-unmasking effect
may not be conserved to humans, b-blockers appear to have
no protective effect in abating cardiac remodeling and hypertro-
phy associated with HCM (Hamada et al., 2014; Ostman-Smith,
2010; Spoladore et al., 2012; Tardiff et al., 2015).
Engineering the integrated tension index not only provided a
predictive model of cardiac growth in both mouse and human
systems, it has also informed our understanding of pathologic
growth in familial cardiomyopathic disease as a mechanically
sensed parameter that likely reflects total work performed by
the heart. This is especially true when considering that the inte-
grated Ca2+ transient or any singular Ca2+ parameter poorly pre-
dicted heart remodeling in the experimental models with direct
modulations of contractile Ca2+ cycling through the loss of
SERCA2 or phospholamban. Moreover, the patient iPSC cardiac
myocytes with the R9C PLN mutation also had a Ca2+ transient
similar to those produced in myocytes derived from healthy
iPSCs. The tension-based model is also consistent with the
observation that non-Ca2+-sensitizing mutations in sarcomeric
proteins, such as titin, co-segregate with cardiomyopathy
because they alter tension (Hinson et al., 2015; LeWinter and
Granzier, 2013). Thus, we envision that the basic integrated-ten-
sion index described here could be used to inform pharmaco-
logic treatment paradigms to achieve the best therapeutic
outcome in HCM and DCM patients.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
An expanded version of the Experimental Procedures appears in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures that accompanies this manuscript.
Computational Simulations of Myocyte Tension and Ca2+ Cycling
The computational simulations employed here were performed in the visual
basic software environment and constructed by adapting previously reported
parameters (Negroni and Lascano, 2008) to our mouse myocyte experimental
data in which unloaded and fixed-length myocyte twitch tension and the
related Ca2+ transient are simulated. This model was constructed using
Huxley’s original contraction model (Huxley, 1957) and incorporating the three
states of troponin-tropomyosin inhibition of crossbridge cycling.
Predictive Algorithm for Cardiac Growth
To account for methodological differences in measuring twitch shortening or
tension and Ca2+ cycling, each transient’s baseline is set to zero and normal-
ized to the WT or non-diseased condition. The area under the curve is calcu-
lated for the mean twitch force per condition.
Linear Regression Analysis of the Integrated-Tension Index
Four non-integrated parameters measured in isolated myocyte contractile
assays (mean shortening, 90% relaxation time, Ca2+ transient amplitude, and
90% Ca2+ decay time) and two integrated parameters, which include the areas
under the mean twitch (shortening or tension) and Ca2+ transient, were individ-
ually regressed against the following cardiac growth parameters: cardiac mass
(HW/BW), ventricular chamber dimension, and wall thickness. The Pearson cor-
relationcoefficient (r)andR2 valueswere calculatedandstatistically analyzedby
Prism software using a two-tailed test, a = 0.05 and n = 22.
Mouse Echocardiography and Invasive Hemodynamics
Mice were anesthetized and echocardiography measurements made at the
ages described. M-mode measurements were used to assess fractional short-
ening, chamber dimensions, and wall thickness during systole and diastole.

 In vivo hemodynamics were measured in anesthetized and ventilated mice us-
ing a pressure-volume catheter (1.2 F, Transonic System) inserted into the left
ventricle through the carotid artery. All experimentation on mice was approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center.
Statistics
Unpaired t tests were used to determine statistical significance in experiments
with two groups, and a one-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical sig-
nificance for multivariate experiments. Pairwise comparisons were made using
Newman-Keuls tests (Prism software). All graphed data are represented as
mean ± SEM.
