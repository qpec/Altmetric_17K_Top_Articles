Abstract
Objectives: Malignant mesothelioma is closely associated to asbestos exposure. One such exposure may occur through con-
tact with occupationally exposed household members and their belongings. This study examines the features of pleural me-
sothelioma attributable only to asbestos brought home by another family member. Material and Methods: The data sources 
were 1063 mesothelioma cases diagnosed between 1995 and 2014, from the Friuli Venezia Giulia Mesothelioma Register. 
In all cases the diagnosis of mesothelioma was based on the pathology report. Exposure information and demographic 
data were acquired by an occupational medical standardized questionnaire/interview. Results: Household-exposure me-
sothelioma cases included 33 women and 2 men. Relationships were: wives (N = 22), daughters (N = 9), sons (N = 2), 
and mothers (N = 2). Asbestos exposure in the workers predominantly occurred in shipyards. Out of the 35 pleural cas-
es, 19 were epithelial, 9 biphasic, 3 sarcomatoid, and 4 not specified. The mean age at diagnosis was 77 years old. The mean 
latency was 59 years, with wives having a significant shorter latency than offspring. Latency was not significantly related 
to morphology and asbestosis. The overall mean survival was 16 months (median 11 months) but treatment was ben-
eficial (mean 16 months vs. 7 months). Biphasic/sarcomatoid histology and presence of asbestosis were associated with 
a decreased survival, although not with statistical significance. Conclusions: Our data confirms that household exposure 
increases the risk for pleural mesothelioma amongst women with no history of occupational asbestos exposure. This is 
an ongoing problem in many countries, as well as in Italy, where the evaluation of a framework for the compensation of 
these cases is under debate. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2017;30(3):419–431

INTRODUCTION
Mesothelioma is closely associated with asbestos exposure: 
a history of asbestos exposure may be found in > 80% of 
mesothelioma cases [1]. Mesothelioma may arise in vari-
ous locations – most commonly the pleura and the peri-
toneum and only rarely other serosal surfaces. The great 
majority of asbestos-induced mesothelioma in the indus-
trialized world is caused by the occupational asbestos ex-
posure, and occurs among workers engaged in extracting 
and manufacturing asbestos, or performing tasks involving 
contact with asbestos-containing materials [2]. The con-
cern used to be focused on the occupational environment

Guidelines [15]. Since 1995, the Friuli Venezia Giulia Me-
sothelioma Register, included in the network of the Re-
NaM, has recorded the incident cases of the MM in 
the Region, an industrial area in Northeastern Italy with 
a history of extensive occupational asbestos exposure, 
mainly due to the existence of several shipyards in the Tri-
este-Monfalcone district.
This study examines the available residential and famil-
ial history and occupational and clinical data of individu-
als diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma, attributable 
only to asbestos brought home by another family member, 
from the Friuli Venezia Giulia Mesothelioma Register.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The analysis is designed as a retrospective population-
based study to identify mesothelioma cases in house-
hold members (e.g., wives, daughters/sons, sisters/broth-
ers) of asbestos-exposed workers. The data sources 
are 1063 MM cases, available from 1995 to 2014, from 
the Friuli Venezia Giulia Mesothelioma Register.
The Friuli Venezia Giulia COR collects incident malig-
nant mesothelioma cases from health care institutions 
that diagnose and treat cases of mesothelioma (especially 
pathology and histology units, pneumology and chest sur-
gery wards), consults hospital discharge records and death 
certificates, analyzes the pathology diagnosis and classi-
fies cases according to diagnostic certainty achieved (de-
fined MM, probable MM, possible MM) [15].
Data on occupational and residential history together 
with lifestyle habits is reported directly from the subjects 
or their relatives using a standardized questionnaire/inter-
view administered by an occupational physician.
Exposure to asbestos is classified as occupational (certain, 
probable, possible), household (when patients have lived 
with a cohabitant occupationally exposed), environmen-
tal (residence near a source of asbestos pollution without 
work-related exposure), hobbies (other non-occupational 
exposures like those due to leisure time activities), unlikely 
but it is recognized that asbestos fibers are widely spread 
in the environment. People may be exposed to asbestos 
in various non-occupational circumstances: domestic ex-
posure living with asbestos workers, with regular exposure 
to soiled work clothes brought home; environmental ex-
posure in the neighborhood of industrial sources (asbestos 
mines and mills, asbestos processing plants); passive expo-
sure in buildings containing asbestos; and natural environ-
mental exposure to geological sources [3].
Individuals exposed in the non-occupational setting may 
have similar asbestos fiber lung burden to those exposed in 
the occupational setting, presenting a significant mesothe-
lioma risk [4–6]. While exposure in non-occupational set-
tings is generally much lower than the one in occupational 
circumstances, the levels may not be negligible. It is thus 
likely that lifelong cumulative exposure may have been as 
high as in some occupational settings, but it was not, or not 
adequately, measured [7].
One such exposure, recognized since 1965 by Newhouse 
and Thompson [8], is asbestos brought home to family 
members on the hair, clothing and personal effects of as-
bestos workers. The increased risk for death from pleural 
mesothelioma amongst wives of asbestos-industry workers 
is well known from many international case-reports [4,6,9]. 
The risk of pleural mesothelioma in household members 
has also been investigated in several case-control [10] 
and cohort studies [11–13]. Between 1993 and 2012 
a case-list of 21 463 malignant mesothelioma (MM) was 
recorded by the Italian National Mesothelioma Regis-
ter (ReNaM) [14] and the modalities of exposure to as-
bestos fibers have been investigated for 16 511 (76.9%) 
of them, identifying 786 (4.8%) cases with a family expo-
sure. Among the 786 mesothelioma subjects (675 wom-
en and 111 men), 738 were pleural and 47 peritoneal 
cases [14].
The ReNaM has a regional structure with the Operative 
Regional Centers (CORs) that actively research cases 
and classify asbestos exposure, according to the National

the husband quit his job or the marriage ended, whichever 
it came earlier. For the wives who also had father occu-
pationally exposed, the date of 1st household exposure to 
asbestos was taken to be the date of 1st exposure as re-
corded on the questionnaire/interview. The year of 1st ex-
posure and age at 1st exposure were derived from the date 
of 1st exposure as defined above. Duration of exposure was 
calculated from the date of 1st exposure to the date of last 
exposure. Survival in months was calculated from the date 
of mesothelioma diagnosis or symptoms (if the former was 
not available) to the date of death. The closing date was 
set on December 31, 2014.
Difference in latency and survival between wives and off-
spring were assessed by the Chi2 test. The survival data 
was also analyzed based upon parameters such as treat-
ment modality, histological type and presence/absence of 
asbestosis. Statistical significance was defined as a p val-
ue < 0.05. All statistical analyses have been carried out by 
means of the SPSS software (version 20.0).
RESULTS
Between 1995 and 2014 among the 1063 cases (890 males, 
173 females) recorded in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Me-
sothelioma Register, 50 cases were diagnosed amongst 
members of households where at least 1 worker had 
been occupationally exposed to asbestos. Among these 
cases, 15 (11 men and 4 women) who had worked for 
a period in industrial activities with certain (N = 9), prob-
able (N = 3) and possible (N = 3) exposure to asbestos, 
were not included for this study. This resulted in a study 
group of 35 individuals.
Among the 35 mesothelioma cases that met inclusion crite-
ria, 33 (94%) were female and 2 (6%) were male. Detailed 
job histories revealed that neither the women nor the men 
had ever worked in an asbestos industry sector. Their ex-
posure was only through residential inhalation of asbes-
tos from husband’s or father’s contaminated work clothes 
that were not removed in the workplace for cleaning but 
or unknown (e.g., questionnaires reported an incomplete 
job and/or residential and familial history) following 
the National Guidelines [15,16]. Certain occupational 
exposure is attributed to the subjects whose work has in-
volved the use of asbestos or materials containing asbes-
tos; probable occupational exposure to the subjects who 
have worked in a firm where asbestos has been certainly 
used but whose exposure cannot be documented; possible 
occupational exposure to the subjects who have worked in 
a firm referring to an economic sector where asbestos has 
been used [15,16].
Exposure information and medical data were reviewed 
(by occupational physicians) in all cases included for 
the analysis. The diagnosis of mesothelioma was based 
on the pathology report including immunohistochemical 
staining documenting the presence and location of me-
sothelioma. Demographic data, such as gender, age, age 
at 1st domestic exposure to asbestos, occupational histo-
ry, and personal and family health history were collected 
and archived from the questionnaire/interview. In addi-
tion, general information of occupation, industry setting 
and the decade(s) of exposure of household contacts was 
acquired from this source. For each mesothelioma case, 
data on asbestos bodies, pleural plaques and asbestosis at 
autopsy, when performed, was recorded. The presence of 
asbestos-related disease in asbestos-exposed workers was 
also recorded, whenever available. There was no informa-
tion available about measurements of quantitative asbes-
tos fiber burden of lung tissue for any of the subjects in 
this study.
The latency period was defined as the time between 
the year of 1st exposure and the year of diagnosis. For 
wives or offspring the period of domestic exposure was 
estimated according to the period during which their hus-
bands or fathers were occupationally exposed. For each 
wife, it was estimated that exposure began either the date 
of marriage or the date the husband was hired, whichever 
was later. The end of exposure was considered to be when

Our series includes individuals with household asbes-
tos exposure from 1920 up to 1992. The age at 1st ex-
posure was < 10 years old in 11 cases, 10–19 years old 
in 4 cases, 20–29 years old in 16 cases, ≥ 30 years old 
in 4 cases. The mean age at 1st exposure in the study 
group as a whole was 18±13 years old, while in the case 
of wives it was 26±7 years old. On average, wives 
had a slightly shorter duration of exposure than off-
spring (23.3 years vs. 27.9 years), but this difference was 
not statistically significant.
Out of the 22 cases with available data about other as-
bestos-related disease, asbestosis was present in 7 cases. 
Among these, 3 had pleural plaques as well. Asbestos 
bodies were observed on routine lung sections in 4 cases. 
Pleural plaques (N = 4), asbestosis (N = 4), lung can-
cer (N = 2) and mesothelioma (N = 1) were also report-
ed for 8 husbands and 1 father occupationally exposed. 
The husbands as well as the father were employed in 
a shipyard.
In this study the mean latency was 59±15 years. Wives did 
have the shorter latency period than offspring (53 years 
vs. 73 years, p < 0.05). The latency period was not signifi-
cantly related to morphology: no statistical difference was 
found in the latency for epithelioid versus biphasic/sar-
comatoid and not specified tumors (57 years vs. 63 years 
and 55 years, respectively). Furthermore, there was no sta-
tistical difference in latency comparing those with (N = 7) 
and without (N = 15) asbestosis (67 years vs. 59 years, 
respectively).
Among the 35 cases of mesothelioma reviewed in this se-
ries, 13 underwent some sort of treatment: decortication/
pleurectomy in 8 cases and a combination of systemic che-
motherapy and radiation therapy in the remaining cases. 
Most (63%) of the mesothelioma cases were not treated, 
apart from palliative care.
At the end of the study (December 31, 2014), 97% of 
the subjects died (only 1 woman, a wife, was alive). 
The overall median of survival was 11 months. There was 
were rather taken home, where the wives and/or daughters 
brushed and hand-washed them almost once a week.
Demographic and clinical data of the study group are re-
ported in the T
able 1. Mesothelioma cases are ordered by 
the date of diagnosis. In all cases the tumor site was the pleu-
ra, with a right-sided predominance (54%). Histological type 
was epithelial in 19 (54%) cases, biphasic in 9 (26%), sarco-
matoid in 3 (9%), and not specified in 4 (11%) cases. The di-
agnosis was based upon tissue biopsy in 22 (63%) cases, cyto-
logical examination in 2 (6%) and autopsy in 11 (31%) cases. 
Among the 35 mesothelioma subjects, 22 (63%) underwent 
post-mortem examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by im-
munohistochemical reactions in 34 cases.
Mean age at diagnosis was 77±10 years old (the range of 
50–93 years old). The age at diagnosis for offspring was 
slightly younger than for wives (73 vs. 78 years old), but 
this difference was not statistically significant. Out of those 
with available smoking data, there were 15 (75%) non-
smokers and 5 (25%) smokers or ex-smokers.
In our study all cases of mesothelioma lived in the same 
household as the exposed worker(s). In the 7 cases of dual 
relationship (daughter and wife (N = 4), wife and mother 
(N = 2), daughter and sister (N = 1)) and in the only case 
of triple relationship (daughter, sister and wife), the earlier 
exposure is counted. Relationships were: wives (N = 22), 
daughters (N = 9), sons (N = 2), mothers (N = 2).
The Table 2 shows the distribution of industries and occu-
pations in which asbestos exposure took place. The expo-
sure setting with the highest number of workers who lived 
with the presented cases was a shipyard (possibly due to 
our location in the Trieste-Monfalcone ship-building and 
repair district), followed by maritime transport, engine 
construction, refinery, power generation, construction and 
firefighters. Unskilled workers and welders were the most 
commonly identified occupations. Some family members 
worked in and were consequently registered in > 1 indus-
try and/or occupation, which resulted in a higher number 
of observations than family members (N = 44).

no statistical difference in survival between wives and off-
spring. In examining the 3 histological types for prognos-
tic differences, a significant survival benefit for epitheli-
oid versus biphasic/sarcomatoid and not specified tumors 
(mean 13 months vs. 6 months and 12 months, respectively) 
was not found. Comparing those with and without asbes-
tosis, a shorter survival was found in those with asbestosis 
(mean 5 months vs. 17 months), but this difference was not 
statistically significant. There was a statistically significant 
difference comparing survival time with and without treat-
ment (mean 16 months vs. 7 months, p < 0.05).
DISCUSSION
Emerging data about pathophysiology of mesothelioma 
suggests that non-occupational and occupational asbestos 
exposure are non-differentiating variables with regard to 
causality [4,17,18]. These studies demonstrate that the oc-
cupational as well as non-occupational exposure may be 
anything from very heavy to very low. The family of an as-
bestos worker, for example, could be exposed to consid-
erable amounts of asbestos brought home on his work-
ing clothes, and it was often the case that it was the duty 
of the wife or daughter to clean the clothes [19]. Thus, 
the fiber concentrations in domestic exposure might be as 
high as in the occupational setting. Nicholson et al. [20] 
found that chrysotile asbestos concentrations in the air of 
the homes of 13 asbestos mine and mill employees ranged 
from 50 μg/m3 to > 2000 μg/m3. Samples from 3 neighbor-
ing homes of non-miners ranged 32–65 μg/m3. Brushing 
clothes might give peaks of > 100 fibers/ml, which may 
remain in the house for years and be airborne again when-
ever disturbed [21].
Thus, the typical non-occupational exposure is low or 
very low, but occasional high exposure occurs when there 
is a disturbance of some kind [17]. Moreover, while fi-
ber dose may be lower in the non-occupational settings, 
the duration of exposure may be much longer in the non-
occupational as compared with the occupational setting

 MESOTHELIOMA FROM HOUSEHOLD EXPOSURE

carried out in the United States reported 32 household-
exposure mesothelioma cases from relatives employed in 
asbestos-associated industries [6].
The 32 household-exposure cases in the Miller [6] series 
were similar to the said series in the distribution of tu-
mor location (27 pleural vs. 5 peritoneal mesotheliomas) 
and histological type (17 epithelial, 9 fibrous/biphasic, 
and 6 not specified), frequency of pleural plaques and as-
bestosis (10 cases and 4 cases, respectively), distribution of 
family relationships (15 wives, 11 daughters, 3 sons, 1 sis-
ter-in-law, 1 niece, and 1 boarder) and exposure setting of 
household contacts (shipyard was the main industry sector 
with the highest number of exposed family members). In 
our study the ship-building and repair industry, in which 
asbestos primarily had been used for insulation purposes, 
also accounted for the largest part of asbestos exposures.
Household exposure has been suggested as the source for 
mesothelioma presenting at an earlier age [19]. In this 
study the mean age at diagnosis was 77 years old. The fact 
that 80% of our cases were ≥ 70 years old shows that 
household exposure should not be ruled out when meso-
thelioma is detected in an older individual. The majority 
of mesothelioma cases (90%) among men are attributable 
to asbestos and are pleural [25], in contrast only 20% of 
mesotheliomas among women are recognized as asbestos-
related and 2/3 are pleural [26]. In this series, all cases 
were pleural and 33 occurred in women (predominantly 
wives). Moreover, asbestosis and pleural plaques were 
noted in 32% of those with available data. The presence 
of asbestosis, pleural plaques, and asbestos bodies also 
correlated with asbestos exposure.
Seven women had developed asbestosis. Asbestosis 
most commonly occurs among men following prolonged 
and usually heavy occupational exposure to asbestos. 
The presence of asbestosis among women with non-oc-
cupational asbestos exposure is a relevant aspect of this 
study, seldom reported in the literature [6]. In all patients 
the diagnosis, based on radiological features, was always 
because the asbestos fibers permeate the environment. 
Therefore, cumulative exposure may be comparable be-
tween occupational and non-occupational cases [18]. 
Huncharek et al. [22] reported that the lung asbestos fiber 
content of a shipyard machinist’s wife was similar to that 
seen in cases of mesothelioma associated with the occupa-
tional exposure. Bianchi et al. [23] found asbestos bodies 
in 6 asbestos workers’ wives with only household exposure. 
Between 1000 and 10 000 asbestos bodies/g of dry lung 
tissue were measured in the half of the wives; as many 
as 10 000–100 000 asbestos bodies/g of dry lung tissue were 
reported in the case of 1 wife. Such concentrations are 
comparable to those found amongst 56 shipyard workers.
Evidence of mesothelioma for wives of asbestos-industry 
workers has been recognized since the date of the report 
of Newhouse and Thompson [8] which included 7 meso-
thelioma cases that had washed the work clothes of their 
occupationally exposed husbands and siblings. In a cohort 
study, Ferrante et al. [13] showed a statistically signifi-
cant increase in both pleural cancer mortality and pleu-
ral mesothelioma incidence among women who had been 
exposed to asbestos at home as wives of asbestos-cement 
workers.
Other reports show that not only wives but also sons 
and daughters are at risk from asbestos brought home 
by exposed workers. In the Anderson cohort study on 
amosite workers, 3 cases of mesothelioma had been ex-
posed to asbestos at home during their childhood [11]. 
Kane et al. [19] reported 5 cases of pleural mesothelio-
ma < 40 years attributable to household exposure dur-
ing childhood, exclusively through their fathers, most 
of whom were working in the shipyard industry. Rog-
gli et al. [24] found that 33 out of 59 female mesothelio-
ma cases with an available exposure history were family 
contact only. A previous study on family mesothelioma in 
the Trieste-Monfalcone ship-building and repair district 
reported 5 patients who had been exposed at home while 
washing asbestos-contaminated work clothes [9]. A study

the 1st year of cohabitation (or the year of 1st exposure 
beginning for the cohabitant) was considered as the on-
set of asbestos exposure [16]. For example, for each 
wife, the time of 1st exposure to asbestos was considered 
to have coincided with the date of marriage or the date 
the husband was hired, whichever was later. As a matter 
of fact, the beginning of a work period could not exactly 
correspond to the beginning of exposure to asbestos and it 
could lead to an overestimation of latency time [16].
As stated in the epidemiological literature [16], the retro-
spective analysis of collected cases – as usual for an inci-
dence surveillance system – could “miss” the cases with 
the shorter latency thereby overestimating the mean laten-
cy period. In addition, the possible presence of competi-
tive causes of death (e.g., asbestos related lung cancer and 
asbestosis) and the incomplete cohort analysis (our study 
population comprised cases collected in recent years and, 
hence, cases with relevant past exposure and short latency 
could be missing) induce a possible bias in the statistical 
inference about differences in latency.
The survival from malignant mesothelioma has been 
poor. Our results (median survival of 11 months, mean 
survival of 16 months) are consistent with survival values 
reported by other studies. The reported range for me-
dian survival for pleural mesothelioma in a 2009 review, 
regardless of stage, was 9–17 months [28]. In many stud-
ies, epithelial histology is associated with a better prog-
nosis than the biphasic or sarcomatoid type [27]. Our 
study has found a longer survival for epithelial histology 
compared to biphasic/sarcomatoid type but this differ-
ence was not statistically significant. Comparing those 
with and without asbestosis, our data – as it would be ex-
pected – has revealed a longer survival for those without 
asbestosis but this difference has not reached statistical 
significance.
Results are conflicting about the survival in patients 
treated with combinations of therapies as compared to 
patients receiving only palliative treatment. In some 
confirmed by histology on lung tissue specimens obtained 
from autopsy; therefore among these patients the risk 
of misclassification should be negligible. All the patients 
with asbestosis had never worked in an asbestos industry: 
asbestos exposure was attributable exclusively to asbes-
tos brought home by another resident of the household. 
The husbands of 2 women had also developed pulmonary 
asbestosis, and the father of 1 patient died of lung cancer. 
Between 1930 and 1973, both the husbands and the father 
were employed in a shipyard in the Trieste-Monfalcone 
district. The severity of asbestos exposure in the ship-
building and maintenance industry as well as the high inci-
dence of pleural mesotheliomas in the shipyard areas has 
been well documented [9].
The prolonged latency period (59 years) found in the cur-
rent study is consistent with other studies [16,27]. Marinac-
cio et al. [16] reported the mean latency of 48 years among 
household exposed mesothelioma cases which was signifi-
cantly longer than that of 43 years observed among the oc-
cupationally exposed ones. As hypothesized in a recent 
study, it is possible that women, who have a longer latency 
than men, tend to have lower exposures than men due to 
their mainly non-occupational asbestos exposure [27]. In 
this study there has been a female preponderance and 
the source of exposure has been non-occupational, so this 
could be an explanation for our results.
Wives had a significant shorter latency than offspring, de-
spite similar duration of exposure. This may be consistent 
with a greater burden of asbestos wives.
This study has revealed no statistical difference in latency 
comparing those with asbestosis (who, presumably, had 
greater exposure) and without. This finding would seem 
contrary to the opinion that the heavier the asbestos expo-
sure, the shorter the latency, nevertheless other research-
ers have reported similar results [27].
It is necessary to underline that it is particularly complex 
to identify the start of asbestos exposure for mesothe-
lioma cases of non-occupational origin. In this analysis,

studies an effect on prognosis of combinations of thera-
pies compared to only palliative treatment has been ob-
served [27,29], while others have reported no effect [30]. 
A case series of 238 pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas 
reported a mean survival of 11.3 months for patients re-
ceiving therapy vs. 6.4 months in those that remained un-
treated [27]. Our results show a statistically significant im-
provement in survival with treatment. Unfortunately, many 
patients with mesothelioma are often diagnosed at a late 
stage. Thus, these patients may benefit less from therapies 
because of advanced diseases, highlighting the role of as-
bestos exposure history in early diagnosis [29].
CONCLUSIONS
Non-occupational subjects are more likely to be under-
recognized than those with occupational exposure because 
of recall and gender bias. Given the long latency period 
involved, such exposure may be rather remote and involve 
poor recollection [27].
However, the predominance of women in the household 
contact cases and the long latency of asbestos-induced dis-
eases underline the importance of collecting a detailed ex-
posure history of mesothelioma subjects who claim to have 
had no occupational asbestos exposure. These patients 
should trigger a suspicion of secondary asbestos exposure 
through household contact [31]. Such exposure may have 
taken place in the great number of women whose meso-
theliomas have not been attributed to asbestos.
The current study confirms the increased risk of pleural 
mesothelioma from domestic exposure for relatives of oc-
cupationally exposed workers. This is an ongoing problem 
in many countries, as well as in Italy, where the issue of 
insurance and welfare protection for mesothelioma cases 
related to non-occupational asbestos exposure is under 
debate. The evaluation of a framework for the compen-
sation of these mesothelioma cases needs to be carefully 
undertaken from economic, ethical and insurance points 
of view [32].
