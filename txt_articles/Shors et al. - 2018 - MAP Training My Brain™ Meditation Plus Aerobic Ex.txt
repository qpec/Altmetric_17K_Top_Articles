Sexual violence against women often leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
a mental illness characterized by intrusive thoughts and memories about the traumatic
event (Shors and Millon, 2016). These mental processes are obviously generated by the
brain but often felt in the body. MAP Training My BrainTM is a novel clinical intervention
that combines mental training of the brain with physical training of the body (Curlik and
Shors, 2013; Shors et al., 2014). Each training session begins with 20-min of sitting
meditation, followed by 10-min of slow-walking meditation, and ending with 30-min of
aerobic exercise at 60–80% of the maximum heart rate (see maptrainmybrain.com).
In previous studies, the combination of mental and physical (MAP) training together
significantly reduced symptoms of depression and ruminative thoughts, while reducing
anxiety (Shors et al., 2014, 2017; Alderman et al., 2016). We also documented positive
changes in brain activity during cognitive control and whole-body oxygen consumption
in various populations. In the present pilot study, we asked whether the combination
of meditation and aerobic exercise during MAP Training would reduce trauma-related
thoughts, ruminations, and memories in women and if so, whether the combination
would be more effective than either activity alone. To test this hypothesis, interventions
were provided to a group of women (n = 105), many of whom had a history of sexual
violence (n = 32). Groups were trained with (1) MAP Training, (2) meditation alone, (3)
aerobic exercise alone, or (4) not trained. Individuals in training groups completed two
sessions a week for at least 6 weeks. MAP Training My BrainTM significantly reduced
post-traumatic cognitions and ruminative thoughts in women with a history of sexual
violence, whereas meditation alone, and exercise alone did not. MAP Training significantly
enhanced a measure of self-worth, whereas meditation and exercise alone did not.
Similar positive effects were observed for all participants, although meditation alone
was also effective in reducing trauma-related thoughts. Overall, these data indicate the
combination of meditation and exercise is synergistic. As a consequence, MAP Training
is preferable and especially so for women who have experienced sexual violence in their
past. Simply put, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Meditation Plus Exercise Lessens Trauma
INTRODUCTION
More than 25% of women worldwide experience physical or
sexual violence (SV) in their lifetime, with similar estimates in
the United States (Kessler, 2000; WHO, 2013; Kessler et al., 2017).
Exact statistics are difficult to obtain because many women do not
report the event, and many fail to seek medical assistance. Sexual
assault often induces post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
(Kessler, 2000; Ozer et al., 2003), a category of mental illness
characterized by extreme fear, helplessness and horror during
the traumatic event, followed by months and sometimes years of
symptoms which include re-experiencing the trauma, avoiding
reminders, and hyperarousal, along with impaired cognition and
mood (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Because women
are four times as likely as men to experience sexual assault and
more than ten times as likely to experience rape (Kessler, 2000),
PTSD is common among women who have experienced sexual
violence. Most resources focus on preventing sexual violence
and helping women with PTSD; not enough target women who
are not actively seeking help and do not have any diagnosable
disorder. The pressing issue is: what can we do to reduce PTSD
and stress-related cognition among women with a history of
sexual violence and assault? In the present study, we provided
three different interventions to a large group of women, many of
whom had experienced sexual trauma in their lives.
MAP Training stands for Mental and Physical Training
(Curlik and Shors, 2013; Shors et al., 2014, 2017; Alderman et al.,
2016). The intervention, known as MAP Training My BrainTM
was inspired by laboratory studies connecting changes in the
brain with mental and physical exercise (Gould et al., 1999; van
Praag et al., 1999; Shors, 2009; Curlik et al., 2013; Nokia et al.,
2016). We chose meditation for the mental training component
because it is effortful for most human beings and presents a
new opportunity for learning upon each session. For the physical
training, we chose aerobic exercise. The two activities are done
one after the other, and easily remembered as SIT, WALK,
SWEAT (Figure 1). Each session of MAP Training consists of
20-min of sitting meditation, followed by 10-min of very slow
walking meditation and then ending with 30-min of aerobic
exercise. Exercise can be accomplished in any mode (running,
spinning, aerobic dancing, rowing, etc.), as long as heart rate
is maintained at 60–80% of a person’s maximum. For logistical
reasons, the meditation component is immediately followed by
the aerobic exercise component. Importantly, each session is only
1 h and therefore easily incorporated into most lifestyles.
In previous and ongoing studies, participants engaged in two
sessions of MAP Training per week. In our first published study,
we provided MAP Training to a group of young women who
had experienced untold trauma while homeless and many came
from impoverished childhoods. After 8 weeks of MAP Training,
symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased significantly
(Shors et al., 2014). MAP Training also produced a significant
and relatively large increase in VO2, which is a direct measure
of oxygen consumption by the body. In a second study, we
provided MAP Training to adult men and women diagnosed
with major depressive disorder (MDD). After MAP Training,
participants with MDD were much less depressed with an
FIGURE 1 | Each session of Mental and Physical (MAP) Training consists of

average 40% decrease in symptoms (Alderman et al., 2016).
Even otherwise healthy controls were less depressed. We also
evaluated ruminations, which are repeated thoughts, typically
autobiographical and negative in nature. These thoughts have
been associated with depression and as expected, they decreased
after MAP Training along with symptoms of depression in
individuals with and without MDD (Shors et al., 2017). MAP
Training also produced positive changes in brain activity related
to cognitive control (Alderman et al., 2016). In summary, MAP
Training has proven effective in reducing symptoms of mental
health and in some individuals, increasing brain and whole-body
health.
Women are much more likely than men to be diagnosed
with PTSD. Of all traumas, sexual assault and violence is
the most likely to induce PTSD, when compared to other
trauma such as war (Kessler et al., 2017). Because sexual
violence is most often inflicted on women, they are at high
risk. Indeed, women with PTSD often report past experiences
of sexual harassment, violence and abuse. Because MAP
Training is so effective in reducing symptoms associated with
depression and anxiety as well as ruminations about the past,
we hypothesized that women who have a history of sexual
violence and the trauma associated with this experience would
respond especially well to MAP Training. We also wanted
to make the intervention available to women who might
not otherwise seek help for their symptoms and/or who do
not even know they have symptoms. To accomplish our
objectives, we recruited young adult women using flyers and
through an online process. After giving their written informed
consent, women were interviewed using the Structured Clinical
Interview Diagnosis (SCID) to detect major mental illness
and document trauma-related symptoms. They then completed
questionnaires about thoughts and feelings surrounding the
trauma experience.

Meditation Plus Exercise Lessens Trauma
The primary goal of this pilot study was to determine whether
MAP Training My BrainTM would help young adult women
learn to recover from trauma-related thoughts and cognitions.
A second goal was to determine whether the combination
of meditation and aerobic exercise was better in this regard
than either meditation alone or exercise alone. Therefore, we
randomly assigned the participants into three treatment arms:
(1) meditation plus aerobic exercise, (2) meditation alone, and
(3) aerobic exercise alone. They completed two sessions a week
for at least 6 weeks and then we retested them with the same
battery of questionnaires and tasks. We included a fourth group
of women (no training) who completed all the testing procedures
but did not participate in any of the interventions. They were
given the opportunity to participate in MAP Training at a later
date (wait-list control).
METHODS
Participants
Adult women (Mage = 20 years, range = 18–32 years) were
recruited with flyers from the student body of a northeastern
university. All participants were provided written informed
consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This
study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations
of the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University. All
research staff were certified by the Collaborative Institutional
Training Initiative (CITI) for Human Subjects Research in
conducting proper clinical trial procedures for human subjects
research.
During session one, recruited participants were given study
information and asked for their informed consent. Participants
then received a clinical interview (Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM-5; SCID-5-RV; First et al., 2015). Psychological and
health history taken from the SCID and questionnaires were used
to determine whether a participant was included or excluded
from the study. Inclusion criteria include: (1) women aged
18–40 years; (2) not engaged in a regular exercise program
(<3 days/wk for 20-min or less per session over the past
month); (3) not engaged in any formal meditation practice
(not meditating more than 30-min total per week and less
than 200-h in lifetime); (4) free from physical limitations or
contraindications to exercise; and (5) able and willing to provide
informed consent. The age restriction takes into account the
effects of aging on cardiovascular and cognitive function (Stein
et al., 1997; Clark et al., 2006). Exclusion criteria included
those with severe psychopathology, including bipolar spectrum
disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and substance use
disorders and those at high risk for suicide (Joiner et al.,
1999), determined from the SCID. All participants were given
contact information for counseling and violence assistance at
the university during consent and at the end of the testing
session. To facilitate recruitment and retention, we provided
appropriate compensation. If an individual met any of the
exclusion criteria, she was compensated for her screening time
but did not continue further in the study. If an individual
met all of the inclusion criteria, she continued with the session
one assessments, during which staff obtain health and medical
histories, prior and current medication use with the Health
History Questionnaire (HHQ; Sadock et al., 2014) and physical
behaviors with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
(IPAQ; Booth, 2000; Craig et al., 2003) or Physical Activity
Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q; Chisholm et al., 1975). After
consent and screening measures were completed, potential
recruits were led into testing rooms to assess outcome measures
as follows:
1) The Post-traumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI; Foa et al.,
1999) was used to assess thoughts and emotions related
to stressful life events. The 33-item questionnaire asks the
participant to rate items such as “I have to be on guard all the
time” and “I feel like I don’t know myself anymore.” Scores on
the PTCI indicate to what extent the participant has negative
cognitions about the self or the world, or feels self-blame as
a result of a stressful event. Higher PTCI scores are indicative
of more negative post-traumatic cognitions and are associated
with greater numbers of PTSD symptoms (Foa and Rauch,
2004). The instructions in this questionnaire were altered
to reflect responses to a very stressful event rather than a
traumatic event, because not all participants had a traumatic
experience.
2) The Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS; Treynor et al., 2003) is
a 22-item scale used to assess repeated thoughts which relate
to depression, brooding and reflection (min 22; max 88).
3) The Best Self Scale was used to assess self-worth (Ogilvie and
Clark, 1992). It asks the participant to mark how close or far
one feels to her ideal self on a scale from 1 (far from being at
my best) to 10 (close to being at my best). Lower scores have
been shown to be associated with depression, particularly in
women (Ogilvie and Clark, 1992; Carver et al., 1999).
4) The Autobiographical Memory Questionnaire (AMQ; Rubin
et al., 2003) was used to assess the strength of a stressful
life memory. The questionnaire includes 19 items, which
are typically scored individually or in clusters, depending on
the research question of interest (Rubin et al., 2011). We
were especially interested in the strength of the memory
rather than accuracy. To protect their privacy, we did not
ask participants to identify the event but rather to just reflect
on the most stressful event in their life. We included 12
individual items which assessed features of the memory:
sensory details (“As I remember the event, I can hear it in my
mind” or “see it in my mind”), temporal and spatial details
(“As I remember the event, I know its temporal and spatial
layout”), emotional details (“As I remember the event, I feel
the emotions now that I felt then”), and significance (“the
memory is significant in my life”). Total scores were calculated,
with greater scores representing a stronger autobiographical
memory.
Meditation and aerobic
exercise components
(alone and
together) were provided in a recreational facility and/or a large
otherwise empty meditation room. The MAP Training staff
supervised all intervention sessions. Meditation sessions were
facilitated by trained practitioners. Aerobic exercise sessions
were supervised and/or led by trained aerobics instructors.
Meditation and aerobic exercise sessions were completed in

the group exercise room. Aerobic exercises were completed in
the fully-equipped exercise facility or during 30-min aerobic
exercise classes. To be compensated, participants had to complete
two sessions per week for 6 weeks. They were allowed to
miss sessions, provided that they attended at least 12 sessions
and a missed session was made up within 2-weeks. We
sent email reminders a day before, which we have used
in the past to produce positive adherence results (∼75%;
Alderman et al., 2016). Based on individual availabilities,
participants were randomly placed in one of three intervention
groups or a no-training wait-list condition, as described
below.
1) Mental and Physical (MAP) Training (MAP Training My
Brain
TM). Participants first engaged in 20-min of focused-
attention (FA) meditation (Farb et al., 2007; Lutz et al., 2008).
In traditional circles, this practice is most similar to Zen
meditation. During the first session, participants were first
instructed to sit, either cross-legged on the floor or in a
straight-back chair. They were instructed to place the palms of
their hands one on top of the other, with the dominant hand
on the bottom and the thumb tips loosely touching. They were
instructed to hold their arms slightly away from the body but
relaxed at the sides, with eyes either closed or half-open and
focused three feet in front of the legs. Participants were then
instructed to begin focusing their attention on their breath,
noticing as the air goes in and out. They were instructed to
especially focus attention on that space in time between the
inhale and exhale. They were then instructed to count these
spaces in time from 1 to 10 and beyond. If the participant lost
count, she was instructed to mentally “let go” of intervening
thoughts without judgment and return to counting the breath,
beginning again at one. This training procedure provided a
context in which the participant can learn to recognize the
presence of an interfering thought and further learn to regain
attention to the focus, which in this case is the breath. This
first component of FA meditation was conducted in complete
silence and continued for 20-min until a standardized bell
rang (using a smartphone meditation application). After the
bell, participants stretched out their legs and arms to regain
blood flow. They then stood up slowly to begin the 10-min
walking meditation. Participants gathered in a large circle with
about 3-ft between each of them. Facing in one direction,
they were instructed to clasp their hands gently behind their
back and direct their eyes about 3-ft on the floor in front
of them. They were guided to focus their mental attention
onto their feet as they walked very slowly (about 10 steps per
min) in the circle, paying attention to the bodily sensations
as body weight shifted from one foot onto the other and
as it shifted through the heel to the ball of the foot. As
attention drifts, the participants were instructed to recognize
the interruption and without judgment, bring attention back
to the feet. This component of meditation training was also
conducted in complete silence until a standardized bell rang
(smartphone meditation application). Immediately after the
30-min meditation component was complete, participants
were instructed to put on their exercise shoes and walk directly
to the exercise room facility (<500-ft from the meditation
room) or remain in the same room for an organized group
exercise class. Participants either exercised on a treadmill
or elliptical machines at moderate-intensity for 30-min or
completed the 30-min aerobic exercise class. After 5-min of
supervised warm-up, participants were instructed to maintain
their heart rate at 60–80% of their individual maximum, which
was recorded halfway through (at minute 15) and at the
end of each session. Maximum heart rate was calculated by
subtracting the participant’s age from 220. After the aerobic
exercise component, participants were supervised through a
5-min cool down, exercising at low intensity until heart rate
values returned to a pre-exercise range, at which point the
MAP training session ended.
2) Mental Training Alone. Participants engaging in the
meditation alone condition meditated for a total of 30-min
(20-min sitting followed by 10-min slow walking), as described
above.
3) Physical Training Alone. Participants engaging in the
aerobic exercise alone condition exercised at moderate-
intensity for 30-min, as described above.
4) No Training. Participants without training were assigned to
a wait-list.
After training, all participants attended a follow-up session,
which included all steps from the first session except the clinical
interview. Participants who did not attend training were asked to
return for the follow-up session at least 6 weeks after their initial
session.
The data were analyzed with analysis of variance with time
(pre-training to post-training) as the within-subject independent
variable and training group (MAP Training, meditation alone,
exercise
alone,
and
no
training)
as
the
between-subject
independent variable. The following outcome measures are
presented as follows: post-traumatic cognitions (PTCI scores),
rumination (RRS scores), self-worth (Best Self Scale scores) and
the memories about a very stressful life event (AMQ scores). Data
were analyzed according to the complete sample of participants
with N’s as follows: MAP (n = 25), meditation alone (n = 24),
exercise alone (n = 21) and no training (n = 35). The groups
with sexual violence were smaller with N’s as follows: MAP (n =
8), meditation alone (n = 4), exercise alone (n = 8), no training
(n = 12). Because of low numbers in some groups, we analyzed
data for all participants (n = 105) and for those with SV history
(n = 32) separately.
RESULTS
Post-traumatic thoughts and cognitions were assessed with the
PTCI. With respect to ANOVA, pairwise comparisons indicated
a significant decrease in trauma-related cognitions after MAP
Training, [F(1, 101) = 4.06, p < 0.05] and meditation alone,
[F(1, 101) = 8.40, p = 0.005], but not for exercise alone (p >
0.05). They did not change in those who were not trained (p
> 0.05). These data suggest that all participants benefited by
MAP Training and meditation alone when asked to reflect on a
very stressful event in their life (Figure 2A). We also analyzed
Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

 Shors et al.
Meditation Plus Exercise Lessens Trauma
the subgroup of women with trauma history of sexual violence,
as indicated by the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID). In
this group, MAP Training significantly reduced trauma-related
cognitions, [F(1, 28) = 4.84, p < 0.05], whereas meditation alone
did not change these scores, p > 0.05 (Figure 3A). Exercise alone
also was ineffective (p > 0.05) and scores did not change in
those who were not trained (p > 0.05). The percent change
was 16% for trauma-related cognitions in the MAP Training
group, whereas all other training conditions did not reach 10%
change. Thus, MAP Training was effective in reducing trauma-
related cognitions in women with SV history whereas exercise
and meditation alone were not.
Ruminative thoughts were assessed with the RRS. As shown
in Figure 2B, RRS scores decreased by more than 5 points after
MAP Training when assessing all participants. This decrease
was highly significant, [F(1, 101) = 9.18, p < 0.005]. Surprisingly,
neither exercise alone nor meditation alone reduced these types
of thoughts. Not surprisingly, there was no change in the women
who did not participate in any training (p’s > 0.05). In women
with sexual violence history, RRS scores were reduced after MAP
Training, [F(1, 28) = 4.54, p < 0.05] and again, not by any of
the other training procedures (Figure 3B). These data suggest
that MAP Training is especially and perhaps uniquely effective in
reducing ruminations when compared to meditation or exercise
alone.
Changes in self-worth were assessed before and after the
interventions using the Best Self Scale across all participants.
As shown in Figure 2C, self-worth scores increased significantly
after MAP Training, [F(1, 101) = 6.30, p < 0.05], but not after
meditation only or exercise only (p’s > 0.05). Scores did not
change in the group who did not participate in any training (p
> 0.05). In women with sexual trauma history, self-worth scores
were significantly enhanced after MAP Training, [F(1, 28) = 5.83,
p < 0.05], but not by the other two training procedures. Scores
did not change in the groups who did not participate in any
training (Figure 3C).
Participants were asked to report on details of a very stressful
event from the past with the AMQ. These reports were quantified
and assessed across participants according to training group.
Interestingly, the strength of the memory significantly increased
in the group with no training, [F(1, 101) = 9.42, p < 0.01], but
did not change for any of the groups that did participate in
training (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences between
training groups. To illustrate these changes, we present the
means for the three training groups compared to the untrained
group in Figure 4. We also analyzed items within the AMQ that
changed (i.e., increased in strength) for participants who did not
participate in the training. The memory items that tended to
increase in strength over the 6-week interval included (1) reliving
the event, (2) seeing, and (3) hearing the event and (4) hearing
people’s voices during the event.
Relationships among rumination, trauma-related cognitions
and strength of a stressful autobiographical memory were also
assessed before training. Across the entire sample, scores on the
AMQ were significantly associated with PTCI scores, r = 0.45,
p < 0.01, as well as scores on the RRS, r = 0.47, p < 0.01.
Correlations were similar after training (p < 0.01). These data
indicate that those women who reported more sensory-related
and contextual details of a stressful past memory had a greater
tendency to ruminate and had more trauma-related thoughts.
We further tested relationships among rumination, trauma-
related thoughts and self-worth scores across the entire sample.
Before training, post-traumatic cognitions as assessed by the
PTCI were highly correlated with ruminative thoughts as assessed
by the RRS, r = 0.67, p < 0.01. The number of ruminative
thoughts negatively correlated with self-worth as assessed by the
Best Self Scale, r = −0.41, p < 0.01. Additionally, post-traumatic
cognitions negatively correlated with self-worth, r = −0.51, p <
0.01. These relationships among outcomes remained significant
(p < 0.01) and did not change as a result of training, as would
be expected given the group data. These data indicate that those
participants who rated themselves as closer to their best (ideal)
self also reported fewer ruminative and post-traumatic thoughts
and vice versa.
DISCUSSION
Despite the undeniable connection between sexual trauma and
mental illness, few interventions are tailored for women who
experience sexual violence. In this pilot study, we present
the clinical intervention of MAP Training My BrainTM as an
especially effective intervention for decreasing trauma-related
thoughts in women in general and especially in women with SV
history. These data further suggest that the combination of the
mental and physical training is more effective than either activity
alone (Figures 3, 5). When analyzing all participants, irrespective
of SV history, both MAP Training and meditation alone
significantly decreased trauma-related cognitions (Figure 2).
This is important information because it suggests that the
meditation component of MAP Training is especially useful
for targeting trauma-related memories and cognitions. However,
MAP Training but not meditation or exercise alone was effective
in women who had experienced sexual violence. Thus, there
appears to be a synergistic effect of the two activities that
specifically helps women learn to recover from sexual violence,
at least with respect to negative thoughts about trauma.
The present data further indicate that rumination responds
best to the combination of meditation and aerobic exercise.
Specifically, MAP Training significantly reduced ruminative
thoughts in all participants and in women with SV history,
whereas meditation alone or exercise alone did not. Together,
the decrease in ruminative thoughts coupled with a decrease in
trauma-related thoughts could be transformative for a woman as
she learns to recover from the stress of life and the even more
traumatic experience of sexual violence. Finally, we report an
increase in self-worth (less discrepancy between real and ideal
self) after MAP Training, but not after meditation or exercise
alone. Thus, the training program not only decreased negative
thoughts but also increased positive thoughts and feelings about
one’s self. As a whole, these data indicate the combination of
meditation and exercise can induce a relatively wide range of
beneficial cognitive and mental health responses in women with
and without trauma history.

Trauma-Related Thoughts Reduced by
MAP Training
MAP Training and meditation alone significantly decreased
trauma-related cognitions for all participants. However, only
MAP Training significantly lessened these types of thoughts for
women with SV history. Taken together, these data suggest that
meditation is an effective means for reducing trauma-related
thoughts, which is then facilitated by the aerobic exercise
component in women with SV history. During the silent
meditation component, the participant was instructed to let
thoughts “come and go.” In other words, as thoughts arise in the
mental space, the person should not follow the thought into other
thoughts nor attach emotions to the thought. But even if this does
happen, and it does, the person is instructed to let the thought

history ruminate more and are especially likely to rehearse
brooding and depressive thoughts about the past (Millon et al.,
under review). These same women also reported the trauma
memories as more vivid, remembered more sensory details
about the event and considered the event a significant part of
their life story. Despite these reports, we cannot know whether
participants were thinking about the traumatic event during
meditation. Assuming they were, it is possible that meditation
serves as a natural means of exposure therapy, which may be
facilitated by the state of the body during meditation. It is
generally assumed that meditation activates the parasympathetic
nervous system, reducing heart rate and blood pressure, slowing
the breath, etc. Learning to let the negative thoughts go while in
a relaxed parasympathetic state appears to be especially effective
for reducing some symptoms of trauma, as detected with the
PTCI and RRS. It is noted that only MAP Training significantly
decreased reports of these types of thoughts in women with
SV history. Thus, meditation plus aerobic exercise is necessary
to significantly induce these changes. We speculate that the
aerobic exercise, because it increases blood flow to the brain,
consolidates the learning which occurred during the mental
training component. It would be difficult to prove, but such a
mechanism would explain the synergistic effect that was evident
after MAP Training but not after meditation or exercise alone.
Ruminative Thoughts Reduced by MAP
Training
Rumination is a potential consequence of sexual trauma and
abuse. During these thought processes, an individual impulsively
and repeatedly rehearses thoughts and memories, most of
which are autobiographical and negative in content. Ruminative
thoughts are especially evident in women with stress-related
illnesses such as depression and in some reports, PTSD (Shors
et al., 2017). Despite a growing appreciation for their presence,
we know less about how to reduce them. Exposure therapy,
during which an individual is exposed to trauma-related stimuli,
can reduce ruminative thoughts through learning processes
related to extinction (Foa et al., 2002; Resick et al., 2002).
However, there is some concern these therapies may exacerbate
the problem because the rehearsal of the event creates yet more
trauma-related memories—the so-called “multiple trace theory”
(Nadel and Hardt, 2011). Regardless, it is generally accepted that
ruminations interfere with the “normal” processing capacity of
the hippocampus, a brain region necessary for acquisition and
rehearsal of autobiographical memories. Indeed, high ruminators
expressed less hippocampal activation to loss events with
corresponding deficits in functional connectivity (Hach et al.,
2014; Johnston et al., 2015). In the present study, ruminative
thoughts were significantly reduced after MAP Training, but
were not reduced after meditation alone or exercise alone. Again,
these data indicate the combination of meditation and exercise
is especially effective in reducing these types of negative thought
processes. Fewer ruminations may contribute to fewer trauma-
related thoughts or vice versa. In either case, fewer negative
thought patterns likely help women recover from the traumas in
their life, especially those related to sexual violence.
Enhanced Self-Worth After MAP Training
In the middle of the last century, Rogers (1954) published
an instrument intended to quantify the discrepancy between
images of an “ideal self” and one’s “now” or “real self.” Scores
were negatively correlated with a host of other variables, e.g.,
symptoms of anxiety and depression, especially in women. They
correlated with self-worth and responded to psychotherapy. In
the present study, we used an updated measure, referred to as the
Best Self Scale (Ogilvie and Clark, 1992). Before any training, low
discrepancies scores correlated negatively with trauma-related
thoughts and ruminations. Therefore, participants who rated

Meditation Plus Exercise Lessens Trauma
themselves as further from their best (ideal) self also reported
more ruminative and post-traumatic thoughts and vice versa.
Interestingly, women who completed MAP Training reported
themselves as feeling closer to their “best selves” when compared
to women who completed the same number of sessions of
meditation alone or exercise alone. These results could be
clinically important because women with trauma history often
report negative cognitions about themselves, such as self-blame
and guilt, which are sensitive to therapeutic change. For example,
a recent study reported that fewer negative cognitions about
the self were associated with fewer symptoms of PTSD when
compared to thoughts about others or the world (Kumpula et al.,
2017). Our results could reflect a change in body image in
response to exercise, although exercise alone was not sufficient
to significantly change the scores. In summary, the combination
of meditation and aerobic exercise was similarly synergistic for
self-worth as it was for ruminative and trauma-related thoughts.
Autobiographical Memories for Stressful
Life Events
All participants were asked to reflect on the most stressful
experience in their life and then to answer questions about the
sensory details and emotions connected to the memory with
the AMQ. In general, the strength of the stressful memory did
not change after MAP Training nor did it change significantly
after meditation or exercise alone. Interestingly, the strength of
the memory and select sensory details associated with it did
enhance in women who did not participate in any training. It is
possible that trauma memories were reactivated by the reminder
cues in the interview session (i.e., the SCID) or by filling out
the questionnaires and continued to increase over the weeks
between the two testing sessions. Because the strength of the
memory did not increase in the trained groups, engaging in
meditation or exercise, regardless of whether they were combined
or not, was sufficient to keep the memories similar in strength
to what they were before training. Overall, these data suggest
MAP Training does not necessarily alter the quality of stressful
memories as much as it does the quantities of intrusive thoughts
and ruminations.
PTSD and Women With Sexual Violence
History
Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder that can
emerge after an extremely stressful life event, with serious
repercussions for the person and society at large (Kessler,
2000). A person diagnosed with PTSD must have direct
exposure, witness or learn of a traumatic event, which induces a
combination of trauma-related thoughts and memories, negative
thoughts about the self, others and the world, hypervigilance and
heightened reactivity to environmental stimuli. These responses
must persist and be accompanied by functional impairment.
About a third (28%) of the women with SV history had current
PTSD, whereas none of the women without SV history were
similarly diagnosed. This is not surprising because women were
recruited for SV history and trauma-related symptoms. Even so,
many of the participants without SV history did report traumatic
life experiences, such as car accidents, family deaths, physical
abuse, etc. We did not conduct a structured interview after
training and therefore do not know whether women with PTSD
were less likely to be diagnosed as a result of MAP Training.
Because MAP Training reduced post-traumatic cognitions, it is
likely that many would have been less likely to incur a PTSD
diagnosis. It has been reported that these negative cognitions
fully mediate the severity of PTSD symptoms in women with SV
history (Shin et al., 2017).
Mind- vs. Body-Focused Therapies for
Trauma
Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is the most accepted evidence-
based form of therapy for helping women recover from
sexual violence and assault. This type of intervention evolved
from animal learning studies of extinction. Through Pavlovian
conditioning, animals including humans learn very quickly to
associate a stressful event with its context and other cues that
are present. These cues come to induce learned or “conditioned”
responses in and of themselves. These learned responses often
persist and may even become exaggerated over time. As such,
they mimic some symptoms of PTSD. However, if the animal
is repeatedly exposed to the cues (the conditioned stimulus),
the learned response can lessen in magnitude and may even be
extinguished altogether. Of course, this response is not forgotten
and will often reemerge in another context or when presented
with salient reminders. Nonetheless, the expression of fearful
responses to conditioned stimuli can be reduced as the animal
learns they do not necessarily predict a stressful event.
The purpose of PE is to reactivate fear networks and learn new
associations with the conditioned stimuli. To do this, the client
is guided through imagined, virtual and/or real-life exposure to
traumatic memories, along with cognitive restructuring and at-
home practice exercises. PE is often effective but has its share of
detractors and problems (Pitman et al., 1991; Jaycox and Foa,
1996; Schnurr et al., 2007). As expected from learning theory,
fear responses often reemerge when the client is confronted with
trauma-related cues outside the therapeutic context. The main
problem however is adherence, with nearly 40% drop-out rates
in some studies (Hembree et al., 2003; Schnurr et al., 2007;
Schottenbauer et al., 2008).
Other trauma interventions incorporate more body-centered
approaches (Porges, 1995; van der Kolk et al., 2014). These
approaches vary but generally involve some combination
of meditation, body scanning and/or mindfulness exercises.
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) (Davidson et al.,
2003) incorporates mindfulness meditation with body scanning
and yoga, whereas Mindfulness and Metta Based Trauma
Therapy (MMTT) includes breathing meditation along with
compassion mantras (Frewen et al., 2015). Their efficacy for
PTSD are supported by clinical trials and meta-analyses (Metcalf
et al., 2016; Cushing and Braun, 2017; Gallegos et al., 2017;
Hilton et al., 2017). Some approaches focus specifically on
the peripheral nervous system. For example, Polyvagal Theory
(PVT) focuses on trauma-related processes which engage the
vagus nerve (Sullivan et al., 2018). Somatic Experiencing R

(SETM) intervenes using interoceptive and somatic cues to restore
balance of the autonomic nervous system (Payne et al., 2015;
Briggs et al., 2018). Other therapies for trauma include Eye
Movement Desensitization (EMDR), during which the client
focuses attentional processes on external stimuli while engaging
with memories of trauma (van der Kolk et al., 2007).
Group therapy and supportive counseling are not as
efficacious as evidence-based therapies, but better than no
treatment at all (Foa and Street, 2001; Sayin et al., 2013).
Many individuals with PTSD are prescribed antidepressants
and anxiolytic medications, sometimes augmented with anti-
psychotics. Importantly, women with SV history reportedly
prefer psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy (Feeny et al., 2009).
MAP Training as a Brain and Body
Intervention
MAP Training activates both branches of the autonomic nervous
system—sympathetic and parasympathetic—in one session.
During meditation, the participant activates the parasympathetic
nervous system to reduce heart rate and blood pressure, while
increasing salivation and digestion. During aerobic exercise,
heart rate increases dramatically through activation of the
sympathetic nervous system, bringing blood and oxygen to the
muscles and brain. These two systems interact in a healthy
person to maintain balance between stress and recovery from
stress. We propose here that extinction and/or exposure learning
occurs while the participant meditates on her breath in a
safe nonthreatening state and then consolidates the learning
upon activation of the sympathetic nervous system during
aerobic exercise. Theoretically, the combination of meditation
and exercise during MAP Training is effective, at least in part
because it activates both branches of the ANS.
The MAP Training My BrainTM intervention was inspired by
laboratory studies about neurogenesis, which is the production
and survival of new neurons (Curlik and Shors, 2013; Shors
et al., 2014). Early studies in animal models reported that many
new neurons die within weeks unless new and effortful learning
occurs (Gould et al., 1999; Shors, 2014). It was later reported
that pubescent female rats exposed to an aggressive adult male
did not learn well and as such retained fewer cells (Shors
et al., 2016). Because learning and aerobic exercise increase
these neurogenic processes, again in rodent models (DiFeo
and Shors, 2017; Vivar and van Praag, 2017), we proposed
that mental and physical training may be particularly effective
when done together (Curlik and Shors, 2013; Shors et al.,
2014). Importantly however, neurogenesis cannot be measured
accurately in humans while they are alive and their detection
in postmortem tissue is limited. Therefore, any meaningful
connection to neurogenesis in humans is tenuous at best.
But exercise and meditation have many effects throughout the
hippocampus. For example, aerobic exercise reportedly increases
the volume of the human hippocampus (Pereira et al., 2007;
Erickson et al., 2011), with similar observations after MBSR
(Hölzel et al., 2011). To be sure, meditation and aerobic
exercise are generally beneficial for both brain and body. The
point here was to develop a mind/body intervention that
would help humans recover from traumatic experiences and
the associated memories, especially women who have suffered
sexual violence.
Dissemination of MAP Training
MAP Training significantly reduced trauma-related thoughts and
ruminations while increasing self-worth in women with and
without sexual violence history. Importantly, the combination of
meditation plus exercise was especially effective for women with
SV history whereas the individual components of exercise alone
and meditation alone were not. We have previously reported
similarly positive outcomes in individuals without preexisting
conditions or trauma, thereby suggesting this intervention as a
way to strengthen mental and physical health and perhaps even
resilience against future traumas. It is not only effective; it is easy
to learn, portable and relatively inexpensive to administer and
do (see maptrainmybrain.com). Our next goal is to disseminate
MAP Training My BrainTM for others to use, either on its own or
in conjunction with other therapies.
