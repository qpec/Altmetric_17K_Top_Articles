IMPORTANCE Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are effective therapies for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes and are all currently available as an injection.
OBJECTIVES Tocomparetheeffectsoforalsemaglutidewithplacebo(primary)andopen-label
subcutaneoussemaglutide(secondary)onglycemiccontrolinpatientswithtype2diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Phase 2, randomized, parallel-group, dosage-finding,
26-week trial with 5-week follow-up at 100 sites (hospital clinics, general practices, and
clinical research centers) in 14 countries conducted between December 2013 and December
2014. Of 1106 participants assessed, 632 with type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic
control using diet and exercise alone or a stable dose of metformin were randomized.
Randomization was stratified by metformin use.
INTERVENTIONS Once-daily oral semaglutide of 2.5 mg (n = 70), 5 mg (n = 70), 10 mg
(n = 70), 20 mg (n = 70), 40-mg 4-week dose escalation (standard escalation; n = 71),
40-mg 8-week dose escalation (slow escalation; n = 70), 40-mg 2-week dose escalation
(fast escalation, n = 70), oral placebo (n = 71; double-blind) or once-weekly subcutaneous
semaglutide of 1.0 mg (n = 70) for 26 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was change in hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) from baseline to week 26. Secondary end points included change from baseline in
body weight and adverse events.
RESULTS Baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment groups. Of the 632
randomized patients (mean age, 57.1 years [SD, 10.6]; men, 395 (62.7%); diabetes duration,
6.3 years [SD, 5.2]; body weight, 92.3 kg [SD, 16.8]; BMI, 31.7 [SD, 4.3]), 583 (92%) completed
the trial. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to week 26 decreased with oral
semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, −0.7% to −1.9%) and subcutaneous semaglutide
(−1.9%) and placebo (−0.3%); oral semaglutide reductions were significant vs placebo
(dosage-dependent estimated treatment difference [ETD] range for oral semaglutide vs
placebo, –0.4% to –1.6%; P = .01 for 2.5 mg, <.001 for all other dosages). Reductions in body
weight were greater with oral semaglutide (dosage-dependent range, −2.1 kg to −6.9 kg) and
subcutaneous semaglutide (−6.4 kg) vs placebo (−1.2 kg), and significant for oral semaglutide
dosages of 10 mg or more vs placebo (dosage-dependent ETD range, –0.9 to –5.7 kg; P < .001).
Adverse events were reported by 63% to 86% (371 of 490 patients) in the oral semaglutide
groups, 81% (56 of 69 patients) in the subcutaneous semaglutide group, and 68% (48 of 71
patients) in the placebo group; mild to moderate gastrointestinal events were most common.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide
resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks. These findings support phase
3 studies to assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

ecombinant human proteins and peptides, such as
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and
insulin analogs, have expanded the range of diabetes
treatment options. For peptide- or protein-based drugs, pro-
teolytic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract poses a sig-
nificant challenge for developing oral formulations.
The first oral GLP-1 analog, using semaglutide in a
tablet co-formulated with the absorption enhancer sodium
N-[8 (2-hydroxylbenzoyl) amino] caprylate (SNAC), is in clini-
cal development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Sema-
glutide tablets are absorbed in the stomach, where SNAC
causes a localized increase in pH, leading to higher solubility
and protection against proteolytic degradation. Semaglutide
is believed to be absorbed via the transcellular route.1
Although several type 2 diabetes treatments are avail-
able, therapy selection involves consideration of the risks
of adverse effects such as hypoglycemia or weight gain and
complexity of treatment. GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce
hyperglycemia by increasing insulin and decreasing gluca-
gon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, with a low
risk of hypoglycemia.2-4 GLP-1 receptor agonists also provide
significant weight loss by reducing appetite and energy
intake,5,6 and 2 GLP-1 analogues, subcutaneous once-weekly
semaglutide and liraglutide, have been shown to signifi-
cantly improve cardiovascular outcomes.7,8 The most com-
mon adverse effects with this drug class are gastrointestinal,
although events tend to be mild to moderate and transient.
The oral formulation of semaglutide may improve accep-
tance and adherence9 for some patients compared with the
injectable formulation of GLP-1 receptor agonists.
The objectives of this trial were to assess among
patients with type 2 diabetes the dosage-response relation-
ship of 5 dosages of oral semaglutide compared with pla-
cebo as well as open-label once-weekly subcutaneous sema-
glutide for glycemic control.
Methods
The trial was approved by local ethics committees and con-
ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,10
International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical
Practice guidelines,11 and the US Food and Drug Association
Code of Federal Regulations (title 21, section 312.120).12 Par-
ticipants provided written informed consent before trial-
related activities commenced.
Trial Design
This 26-week, randomized, parallel-group, phase 2, dosage-
finding trial (Figure 1), conducted between December 2013
and December 2014, assessed the dosage-response relation-
ship on glycemic control (mean change in hemoglobin A1c
[HbA1c]) level of 5 dosages (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg) of once-
daily oral semaglutide compared with placebo in a double-
blind design (primary end point) and open-label, once-
weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (secondary end point) in
patients with type 2 diabetes. Oral semaglutide and placebo
doses were blinded from both the investigator and the
patient. In addition to a 4-week interval dose escalation
(standard escalation), in which oral semaglutide or placebo
doses were doubled every 4 weeks until the trial mainte-
nance dose was achieved, the efficacy and safety of an
8-week interval (slow escalation) and a 2-week interval (fast
escalation) dose escalation regimen for the highest dose (40
mg) of oral semaglutide were explored. The 26-week treat-
ment period was followed by a 5-week follow-up period and
visit at week 31. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan
are available in Supplement 1.
Patient Population
Patients (18 years or older) with type 2 diabetes and insuffi-
cient glycemic control (HbA1c level range, 7.0%-9.5%) on diet
and exercise alone or with a stable dose (at least 30 days) of
metformin were enrolled at 100 sites in 14 countries (eBox 1
in Supplement 2). Additional eligibility criteria were HbA1c
level of 7.0% to 9.5% and a body mass index (BMI, calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)
of 25 to 40 (for key exclusion criteria, see eBox 2 in Supple-
ment 2). Because the trial was conducted in Europe,
North America, and single countries in Africa, Asia, and the
Middle East, race and ethnicity were recorded for complete-
ness of data, according to local regulations. Race and ethnic-
ity were self-reported by participants from categories pre-
defined in the study protocol (race: American Indian or
Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, Native
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, white or other; ethnicity:
Hispanic or Latino, or not Hispanic or Latino).
Drug Administration
An open-label design was chosen for once-weekly subcutane-
ous semaglutide to limit unnecessary injections. Patients
were randomized using an interactive voice and web
response system with equal ratio to 1 of 9 treatment groups,
stratified according to history of treatment (metformin at
screening, yes or no). Treatment groups included 5 oral
semaglutide dosage groups (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg) and an
oral placebo group (these groups received a once-daily dose
with 4-week interval dose escalation), and a 1-mg subcutane-
ous semaglutide group (receiving a once-weekly dose).
Two additional 40-mg dosages were included to evaluate
8-week (slow) and 2-week (fast) dose escalation. Trial prod-
ucts were supplied by Novo Nordisk A/S. Oral semaglutide
tablets (but not placebo) included 300 mg of SNAC (based on
Key Points
Question What is the effect of oral semaglutide on glycemic
control in patients with type 2 diabetes?
Finding In this randomized clinical trial of 632 patients with type 2
diabetes followed up for 31 weeks, oral semaglutide significantly
reduced hemoglobin A1c level by up to 1.9% vs placebo (0.3%).
Meaning Oral semaglutide resulted in better glycemic control
than placebo over 26 weeks. Phase 3 studies are warranted to
assess longer-term and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.

 the Eligen Carrier concept, Emisphere Technologies).13 Pa-
tients administered oral semaglutide or placebo in the
morning after at least 6 hours of fasting, and abstained from
food or fluid intake for at least 30 minutes thereafter. If fasting
plasma glucose exceeded 270 mg/dL/15 mmol/L (week 1-5),
240mg/dL/13.3mmol/L(week6-11),or200mg/dL/11.1mmol/L
(week 12 to trial end), rescue medication was to be offered.
Study End Points and Assessments
The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline in
HbA1c level at week 26. Secondary efficacy end points at
week 26 included the proportion of patients achieving
HbA1c level target of less than 7.0%; change from baseline in
fasting plasma glucose and body weight; proportion of
patients achieving weight loss of 5% or more and 10% or
more; change from baseline in fasting insulin, fasting gluca-
gon, fasting C-peptide, insulin resistance, and beta-cell
function (homeostasis model assessment); fasting lipid pro-
file; patient-reported outcomes (Medical Outcomes Study
36-Item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36; score range,
0-100, higher scores indicate better quality of life]; waist cir-
cumference; and body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). In addi-
tion, a post hoc analysis investigated the proportion of
patients achieving an HbA1c level target of 6.5% or less.
Safety end points included the number of treatment-
emergent adverse events and severe (American Diabetes
Associationcriteria14)orbloodglucose–confirmed(plasmaglu-
cose value of 70 mg/dL [to convert to mmol/L, multiply by
0.0555] or lower with symptoms) hypoglycemic episodes re-
corded from baseline until week 31. Change in vital signs, elec-
trocardiogram, physical examination, and laboratory safety
parameters were assessed after 26 weeks. Adverse events rel-
evant to the GLP-1 drug class were given specific attention.
eBox 3 in Supplement 2 lists the 8 predefined medical events
of special interest that were adjudicated in a blinded fashion
by an external, independent event-adjudication committee.
Statistical Analysis
For patients who completed the trial, the estimated treat-
ment difference (ETD) between the pooled 40-mg oral
semaglutide standard escalation and fast escalation groups
and the placebo group was expected to be at least 0.64%,
whereas for patients who discontinued treatment prema-
turely, the detectable mean difference was set conservatively
to 0.32%, thus leading to a detectable mean difference of
0.58%. With these assumptions, enrollment of 134 patients in
the pooled 40-mg standard and fast escalation groups and the
67 patients in the placebo group provided 90% power to dem-
onstrate superiority of those pooled oral semaglutide dosage
groups vs placebo for the primary end point at a 5% signifi-
cance level, assuming a standard deviation of 1.2% and a pre-
mature treatment discontinuation rate of 20%. Therefore,
enrollment of 67 patients in each of the 9 treatment groups
was planned.
Statistical analyses of efficacy end points were based
on data collected from all randomized patients during the
treatment period who did not receive rescue medication
(based on a modified intention-to-treat principle). Adverse
events that occurred during the 26-week trial period from all

The trial was conducted among 632 patients with type 2 diabetes who were 18
years or older receiving stable treatment with diet and exercise or stable
treatment with metformin for 30 days prior to screening. Patients had a
hemoglobin A1c level of 7.0% to 9.5% and an estimated glomerular filtration
rate of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or more. There was no dose escalation in the oral
semaglutide 2.5-mg and placebo groups. In the other oral semaglutide groups,
the dose was doubled from a starting dose of 2.5 mg or 5 mg every 4 weeks
until the trial maintenance dose of the group (5-40 mg) was achieved (blue
shades). The subcutaneous semaglutide dose was doubled every 4 weeks from
a starting dose of 0.25 mg until a 1 mg trial maintenance dose was achieved. In
addition, a slow dose escalation (purple) to 40 mg of oral semaglutide at
8-week intervals and a fast dose escalation (green) to 40 mg of oral
semaglutide at 2-week intervals were included. Subcutaneous semaglutide was
supplied as a 1.34-mg/mL solution in a 1.5-mL prefilled PDS290 pen injector
(FlexTouch, Novo Nordisk A/S), and was administered in the abdomen, thigh, or
upper arm on the same day of the week.

ment(including5-weekfollow-upplusavisitwindowof5days),
with or without rescue medication, are reported.
A standard repeated measures model analysis, with treat-
ment,country,andstratification(metformin,yesorno)asfixed
factors,andbaselinevalueasacovariate,allnestedwithinvisit,
was used for analysis of continuous end points, including the
primaryendpoint,bodyweight,BMI,waistcircumference,and
fasting plasma glucose. End points for patients attaining HbA1c
level and weight loss targets were analyzed using a modified
Poisson regression model with treatment, country, and strati-
ficationasfixedfactorsandbaselineHbA1clevelorbodyweight,
respectively, as a covariate. Before analysis, missing data were
imputedfromarepeatedmeasuresmodelwithtreatment,stra-
tum, country, and baseline value all nested within visit.
This model was specified post hoc. Fasting insulin, glucagon,
C-peptide,insulinresistance,beta-cellfunctionandlipidswere
log-transformed at week 26 and analyzed by the standard re-
peated measures model analysis. Treatment-emergent ad-
verse events were summarized descriptively. All analyses were
performed using SAS (SAS Institute), version 9.3.
To investigate the efficacy of oral semaglutide without
the risk of inflating a type I error, a confirmatory statistical
analysis was carried out, whereby an initial comparison of
the primary end point between the pooled 40-mg standard
escalation and fast escalation groups vs placebo group was
performed at week 26. The standard repeated measures
model analysis was used to estimate the treatment difference
and corresponding 2-sided P value at week 26. Efficacy of
oral semaglutide was considered confirmed if the upper limit
of the 95% CI for the ETD was less than 0, corresponding to a
2-sided P value of less than .05. If efficacy was confirmed,
the comparisons between the 9 treatment groups and other
secondary end points were evaluated with no adjustment for
multiplicity and considered exploratory in nature.

 Overall, 583 patients (92%) completed the trial (completed the
31-week follow-up visit), with 492 (78%) completing treat-
ment(Figure2).Theproportionofpatientscompletingthetrial
without rescue medication, and contributing to the analysis
atweek26,was64%to83%inthedosage-dependentoralsema-
glutide groups, 73% in the subcutaneous semaglutide group,
and 72% in the placebo group (Figure 2).
Glycemic Control
At week 26, pooled 40-mg oral semaglutide standard and fast
escalation groups reduced mean HbA1c level by 1.8% com-
pared with 0.3% with placebo (ETD, –1.5% [95% CI, –1.7% to
–1.2%]; P < .001; confirmatory statistical analysis) thus achiev-
ing the primary end point.
All dosages of oral semaglutide reduced mean HbA1c
level significantly more than placebo by week 26, in a
dosage-dependent manner (Figure 3A). ETDs for dosage-
dependent oral semaglutide vs placebo were −0.4% (95% CI,
–0.7% to –0.1%] for the 2.5-mg group; –0.9% [95% CI, –1.2%
to –0.6%] for the 5-mg group; –1.2% [95% CI, –1.5% to –0.9%]
for the 10-mg group; –1.4% [95% CI, –1.7% to –1.1%] for the
20-mg group; and –1.6% [95% CI, –1.9% to –1.3%] for the
40-mg standard escalation group (P = .007 for the 2.5-mg
group, <.001 for other dosages). The decrease in mean HbA1c
level in the subcutaneous semaglutide group (1.9%) was also
significantly greater than the placebo group (secondary
analysis) (ETD, –1.6% [95% CI, –1.8% to –1.3%]; P < .001), and
not significantly different from oral semaglutide dosages of
20 mg and 40 mg (standard escalation). The cumulative dis-
tribution of the HbA1c level reduction in the oral and subcu-
taneous semaglutide groups illustrates that with the excep-
tion of the 2.5-mg group, almost 100% of patients
experienced a reduction in HbA1c level vs 74% in the placebo
group (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). In addition, a range of
sensitivity analyses supported the primary comparisons
with similar results in favor of oral semaglutide (eFigure 2 in
Supplement 2).
For the oral and subcutaneous semaglutide groups, most
patients reached the HbA1c level target of less than 7.0%: 44%
in the 2.5-mg group (30 of 70 patients; estimated response rate
ratio [RR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.03 to 2.50]); 81% in the 5-mg group
(56of70patients;RR,2.8[95%CI,1.9to4.2]);84%inthe10-mg
group (56 of 69 patients; RR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.0 to 4.2]); 86% in
the20-mggroup(60of70patients;RR,3.0[95%CI,2.1to4.4]);
and 90% in the 40-mg standard escalation group (61 of 71 pa-
tients; RR, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.3 to 4.8]) (P = .04 for the 2.5-mg
group, P < .001 for other dosages); vs 28% in the placebo group
(19 of 71 patients) and 93% in the subcutaneous semaglutide
group (63 of 69 patients; RR, 3.2 [95% CI, 2.2 to 4.7], P < .001)

 At week 26, significant dosage-dependent decreases in
mean fasting plasma glucose level of up to 51 mg/dL from base-
line were observed with oral semaglutide vs placebo
(Figure 4A). Fasting plasma glucose level decreases with oral
andsubcutaneoussemaglutideoccurredmostlywithinthefirst
4 to 8 weeks (Figure 4A); at week 26, decreases observed with
40-mg standard escalation of oral semaglutide were not sig-
nificantly different to those with subcutaneous semaglutide
(Figure 4A). eTable 1 and eTable 2 in Supplement 2 show im-
provements in insulin, glucagon, and homeostasis model as-
sessment insulin resistance and beta-cell function. No consis-
tent pattern was observed with fasting C-peptide.
Post Hoc Analysis
Patients reaching the HbA1c level target of 6.5% or less
across the oral semaglutide dosages were 21% in the 2.5-mg
group (14 of 70 patients; RR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.6 to 2.3]); 52% in
the 5-mg group (36 of 70 patients; RR, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.6 to
4.8]); 73% in the 10-mg group (49 of 69 patients; RR, 3.9
[95% CI, 2.3 to 6.5]); 77% in the 20-mg group (54 of 70
patients; RR, 4.3 [95% CI, 2.6 to 7.1]); and 82% in the 40-mg
group (56 of 71 patients; RR, 4.7 [95% CI, 2.8 to 7.9]) (P = .60
for the 2.5-mg group, P < .001 for other dosages) vs 17% in
the placebo group (12 of 71 patients) and 85% in the subcu-
taneous semaglutide group (58 of 69 patients; RR, 4.5 [95%
CI, 2.7 to 7.6], P < .001).
Body Weight
Body weight decreased over time (Figure 4B). At week 26, the
decrease from baseline in mean body weight in the oral sema-
glutidegroupswasdosage-dependentandsignificantlygreater
thanplacebo(–1.2kg)(ETD:2.5-mggroup,–0.9kg[95%CI,−2.4
to 0.6]; 5-mg group, −1.5 kg [95% CI, −3.0 to 0.0]; 10-mg group,
–3.6 kg [95% CI, −5.1 to −2.1]; 20-mg group, −5.0 kg [95% CI,
−6.5 to −3.4]; 40-mg standard escalation group, −5.7 kg [95%
CI, −7.3 to −4.2]) (significant vs placebo in the ≥10-mg dos-
ages [P < .001]) (Table 2). No significant difference was ob-
served between 20 mg and 40-mg standard escalation groups
of oral semaglutide and the subcutaneous semaglutide group.
The proportion of patients achieving 5% weight loss was sig-
nificantly greater for oral semaglutide dosage groups of 10-mg
and higher (P < .001; 10-mg group: 38 of 69 patients [56%], RR,
4.1 [95% CI, 2.2 to 7.6]; 20-mg group: 45 of 70 patients [64%],
RR, 5.2 [95% CI, 2.8 to 9.6]; 40-mg standard escalation group:
50 of 71 patients [71%], RR, 5.4 [95% CI, 9.2 to 9.9]) vs the pla-
cebogroup(9of71patients[13%]),andthesubcutaneoussema-
glutide (45 of 69 patients [66%], RR, 5.2 [95% CI, 2.8 to 9.6],
P < .001) (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).

 reported outcomes, as measured by SF-36, version 2 (eTable 1
and eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Adverse Events
Treatment-emergent adverse events for all treatment groups
are shown in Table 3. There were no fatal events. The number
ofseriousadverseeventsandpatientsreportingthemwerelow
(total of 31 events reported in 21 patients), with no grouping
of events (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). The most common ad-
verse events were gastrointestinal, which were mostly mild to
moderate in severity with oral semaglutide (Table 3). The pro-
portionofpatientsreportinggastrointestinaleventswashigher
with oral semaglutide (31%-77%; 255 of 490 patients) and sub-
cutaneous semaglutide (54%; 37 of 69 patients) than with pla-
cebo (28%; 20 of 71 patients). Overall, similar proportions of
patientsreportedgastrointestinal-relatedadverseeventsinthe
three 40-mg dose escalation groups (2, 4, and 8 weeks). Fewer
nausea events were reported when patients started on a lower
dose (eg, 2.5 mg vs 5 mg) (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). With
continued therapy, nausea prevalence and severity de-
creased in most patients (eTable 4 in Supplement 2), partly ex-
plained by some patients discontinuing treatment prema-
turely because of these events.
Premature treatment discontinuation due to adverse
events was more frequent with oral (6%-27%; 81 of 490 pa-
tients) and subcutaneous (14%; 10 of 69 patients) semaglu-
tide than with placebo (1%; 1 of 71 patients) (Table 3), and was
mostly due to gastrointestinal adverse events (4%-21% [65 of
490 patients] with oral semaglutide vs 12% [8 of 69 patients]
with subcutaneous semaglutide and none with placebo). The
proportion of patients prematurely discontinuing treatment
due to adverse events was slightly lower with 40-mg slow es-
calation of oral semaglutide from a starting dose of 5 mg up to
40 mg (14%; 10 of 70 patients) compared with the other 40-mg
groups (40-mg standard escalation, 23% [16 of 71 patients];
40-mg fast escalation, 26% [18 of 70 patients]) and the 20-mg
group (27% [19 of 70 patients]).
The overall number of hypoglycemic episodes was low
and similar for oral semaglutide, subcutaneous semaglutide,
and placebo. The overall rate of severe or blood glucose–
confirmed hypoglycemia was low, with only 2 episodes of
severe hypoglycemia reported (subcutaneous semaglutide
group, 1 patient; oral semaglutide 40-mg fast escalation
group, 1 patient) (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).

a Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as events that had an onset, or increase in severity, on or
after the first day of exposure to the follow-up visit scheduled 5 weeks (plus 5-day visit window) after last trial
product dose or the patient’
s end-of-trial date, depending on which was encountered first. All adverse events
were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, edition 17.1.15 No fatal events were reported.
bStandard escalation indicates 4-week intervals; slow escalation, 8-week intervals; fast escalation,
2-week intervals.
c A serious adverse event was defined as an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: death;
a life-threatening experience; in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; a persistent
or significant disability or incapacity; a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or a situation in which medical
judgment deems that medical or surgical intervention is necessary to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this
definition of serious adverse events.
dSeverity of adverse events was defined as follows: mild (transient symptoms, no interference with daily
activities); moderate (marked symptoms, moderate interference with daily activities); severe (considerable
interference with daily activities, unacceptable).

 morepronouncedwithoralandsubcutaneoussemaglutidethan
with placebo (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Change
in mean heart rate ranged from –1.7 to 3.0 beats/min with oral
semaglutide vs 2.6 beats/min with subcutaneous semaglutide
and –4.0 beats/min with placebo. At week 26, changes in heart
rate were significantly greater with oral semaglutide 5 mg or
higher and subcutaneous semaglutide compared with placebo
(eTable 1 and eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Six cardiovascular
eventsin5patientswereconfirmedbyadjudication(oralsema-
glutide: 10-mg group, 1 patient; 40-mg slow escalation group,
2 patients; placebo: 2 patients) (eTable 6 in Supplement 2).
Three events of pancreatitis in 3 patients were confirmed
by adjudication (subcutaneous semaglutide group, 1 patient;
oral semaglutide: 20-mg group, 1 patient; 40-mg standard es-
calation group, 1 patient]) (eTable 7 in Supplement 2); the 3
events were mild to moderate in severity (eTable 7 in
Supplement 2). Mean lipase levels increased from 42.0 U/L (to
converttoμkat/L,multiplyby0.0167)atbaselineinthedosage-
dependent oral semaglutide groups by 9% to 55% (1.09-1.55)
and in the subcutaneous semaglutide group by 36% (1.36) vs
a reduction of 1% in the placebo group (0.99) (eFigure 5 in
Supplement 2). Mean amylase levels increased from 56.8 U/L
(to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167) at baseline by 7% to
25% (1.07-1.25) for the dosage-dependent oral semaglutide
groups, 22% (1.22) for the subcutaneous semaglutide group vs
5% (1.05) for the placebo group (eFigure 5 in Supplement 2).
Threeeventadjudicationcommittee(EAC)–confirmedneo-
plasm events were reported (oral semaglutide: 10-mg group,
1 basal cell carcinoma; 40-mg fast escalation group, 1 gastro-
intestinal tract adenoma [benign]; subcutaneous semaglu-
tide group, 1 keratoacanthoma [benign]). No thyroid events
were confirmed.
Discussion
Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide
resulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26
weeks (primary end point). From a mean baseline HbA1c
level of 7.9%, between 44% (2.5-mg group) and 90% (40-mg
standard escalation group) of patients receiving oral sema-
glutide achieved the target HbA1c level of less than 7.0%.
Clinically relevant (5% or more) weight loss was achieved in
up to 71% of patients receiving oral semaglutide. The magni-
tude of improvements with oral semaglutide at 20 mg and
40-mg standard escalation was not significantly different
than subcutaneous semaglutide and was similar across the
dosage escalation groups.
Improvements in glycemic control and body weight with
oral semaglutide were achieved with a low rate of hypoglyce-
mia. No unexpected safety findings were identified. Gastroin-
testinal adverse events, with consequent premature treat-
ment discontinuation, was observed in the oral semaglutide
groups, consistent with the known adverse effects of GLP-1 re-
ceptor agonists. Fewer adverse events were reported when pa-
tients started on a low dose (eg, 2.5 mg) and the frequency of
gastrointestinal adverse events was highest during the dose-
escalation period and decreased over time in the oral semaglu-
tide groups.
Three cases of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by ad-
judication in patients receiving both oral and subcutaneous
semaglutide. Imbalances of pancreatitis have also been re-
portedintheclinicaldevelopmentprogramsforotherincretin-
based therapies,16 although these imbalances were not found
in the long-term studies of subcutaneous semaglutide and
liraglutide.7,8Asobservedwithotherincretin-basedtherapies,17
lipase levels increased with semaglutide (oral and subcutane-
ous groups) vs placebo.
Overall, a significant increase in heart rate was seen with
semaglutide (oral and subcutaneous groups) compared with
placebo, similar to observations with other long-acting GLP-1
receptor agonists.18-20 A cardiovascular benefit has been ob-
served in long-term outcome trials with subcutaneous sema-
glutide and liraglutide.7,8
This study has several limitations including duration.
Longer-term data will provide more information about the
safety and efficacy durability of oral semaglutide. A longer
study duration may have demonstrated the maximum
HbA1c level and weight reductions in the groups adminis-
tered the higher doses of the medication. Future trials
should assess the efficacy of oral semaglutide in patients
with a high baseline HbA1c level to explore its potential in
patients who are less well controlled, and in combination
with other glucose-lowering agents. There was no adjust-
ment for multiplicity in the statistical analyses, which may
contribute to a type I error.
The adverse event profile of oral semaglutide was com-
parablewithsubcutaneoussemaglutide.Thethree40-mgdose
escalation groups (2, 4, and 8 weeks) provided similar treat-
ment effects; however, the proportion of patients reporting ad-
verse events during escalation appeared lower with a starting
dose of 2.5 mg vs 5 mg.
Conclusions
Among patients with type 2 diabetes, oral semaglutide re-
sulted in better glycemic control than placebo over 26 weeks.
These findings support phase 3 studies to assess longer-term
and clinical outcomes, as well as safety.
