Background: Circadian rhythms are fundamental to health and are particularly important for mental wellbeing.
Disrupted rhythms of rest and activity are recognised as risk factors for major depressive disorder and bipolar dis-
order.
Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of low relative amplitude (RA), an objective
measure of rest-activity cycles derived from the accelerometer data of 71,500 UK Biobank participants. Polygenic
risk scores (PRS) for low RA were used to investigate potential associations with psychiatric phenotypes.
Outcomes: Two independent genetic loci were associated with low RA, within genomic regions for Neurofascin
(NFASC) and Solute Carrier Family 25 Member 17 (SLC25A17). A secondary GWAS of RA as a continuous measure
identified a locus within Meis Homeobox 1 (MEIS1). There were no significant genetic correlations between low
RA and any of the psychiatric phenotypes assessed. However, PRS for low RA was significantly associated
with mood instability across multiple PRS thresholds (at PRS threshold 0·05: OR = 1·02, 95% CI = 1·01–1·02,
p = 9·6 × 10−5), and with major depressive disorder (at PRS threshold 0·1: OR = 1·03, 95% CI = 1·01–1·05,
p = 0·025) and neuroticism (at PRS threshold 0·5: Beta = 0·02, 95% CI = 0·007–0·04, p = 0·021).
Interpretation: Overall, our findings contribute new knowledge on the complex genetic architecture of circadian
rhythmicity and suggest a putative biological link between disrupted circadian function and mood disorder phe-
notypes, particularly mood instability, but also major depressive disorder and neuroticism.

1. Introduction
Circadian rhythms are variations in physiology and behaviour that
recur approximately every 24 h [1]. They include rhythms of body tem-
perature, hormone release, activity, concentration, mood, eating and
sleeping [2]. Circadian rhythmicity is coordinated centrally by the
suprachiasmatic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus [2] and plays a
fundamental role in homeostasis and the maintenance of both physical
and mental wellbeing [2, 3]. Disruption to circadian rhythmicity is asso-
ciated with a range of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascu-
lar disease, obesity, diabetes and some cancers [4–6], as well as
increased risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disor-
der (BD) [7–9].
Circadian rhythmicity is regulated by both exogenous environmen-
tal stimuli (“zeitgebers”) and by genetic factors [10]. Several core circa-
dian clock genes are involved in autoregulatory transcription/

 translational feedback loops that maintain cell-cycle function [11].
However, the control of circadian rhythms is likely to be polygenic,
with regulatory genes and pathways still to be identified [3, 12].
To date, the most commonly used measure of circadian phenotypes
has been subjectively-reported chronotype, defined as an individual's
preference for morning or evening wakefulness and activity [13]. Eve-
ning chronotype is more likely to be associated with adverse health out-
comes [3, 14–16]. Recently, genome wide association studies (GWAS) of
chronotype, self-reported sleep duration, and accelerometer-derived
sleep traits have identified several independent genetic loci previously
implicated in the regulation of circadian function (including PER2,
PER3, RSG16, AK5, FBXL13), in addition to novel associated genetic loci
[17–22].
However, as a subjective measure, chronotype can be vulnerable to
response bias. It may also have inconsistent associations with more ob-
jective measures of circadian rhythmicity [23]. In a recent study of over
91,488 individuals in the UK Biobank cohort, we derived objective
measures of rest-activity rhythmicity from accelerometer data [24].
We found that low relative amplitude (RA), a measure of disrupted
rest-activity rhythm (individuals with RA two standard deviations
below the sample mean RA), was associated with several mood dis-
order phenotypes [24]. We now extend this work by conducting a
GWAS of low RA in the largest sample known to date from UK
Biobank. We also assess the degree of genetic correlation between
low RA and several psychiatric phenotypes, including attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), BD, MDD, mood instability, post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, anxiety and insom-
nia. Further, within a group of UK Biobank participants who were
not part of the primary GWAS study (up to 141,000 individuals),
we test for association between increased polygenic risk score (PRS)
for low RA and mood-related trait phenotypes (specifically BD,
MDD, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), mood instability and
neuroticism).
2. Methods
2.1. Participants and Ethical Approval
Over 502,000 United Kingdom (UK) residents aged 37–73 years
were recruited to the UK Biobank cohort from 2006 to 2010. At one of
22 assessment centres across the UK, participants completed a range
of lifestyle, demographic, health, mood, cognitive and physical
assessments and questionnaires [25]. Here, we used data from 91,448
participants who also provided accelerometer data that passed quality
control (details below) and who had available data on all covariates in-
cluded within fully and/or partially adjusted models for use in the
GWAS. UK Biobank obtained informed consent from all participants
and this study was conducted under generic approval from the NHS Na-
tional Research Ethics Service (approval letter dated 13 May 2016, Ref
16/NW/0274) and under UK Biobank approvals for applications
12,761 (PI Cathy Wyse; accelerometer data for use in GWAS) and
6553 (PI Daniel Smith; correlations with psychiatric traits) (Supple-
mentary Table 1).
2.2. Accelerometry Data Collection and Pre-Processing
In 2013, 240,000 UK Biobank participants were invited to wear an
accelerometer for seven days as part of a physical activity monitoring
investigation [26]. Of these, 103,720 (43%) accepted and returned the
accelerometer to UK Biobank after use. Participants received a wrist-
worn Axivity AX3 triaxial accelerometer in the post and were asked
to wear the device on their dominant wrist continuously for seven
days, while continuing with their normal activities. At the end of
the seven-day period, participants were instructed to return the ac-
celerometer to UK Biobank using a prepaid envelope. Accelerometers
were calibrated to local gravity. Devices recorded data at a sampling
rate of 94-104 Hz, and data were resampled to 100 Hz offline. Periods
where no data were recorded for N1 s were coded as missing, and
machine noise was removed using a Butterworth low-pass filter
(cut-off 20 Hz). Raw activity intensity data were combined into five
second epochs. Further details on data pre-processing [26] are avail-
able from UK Biobank at http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.
cgi?id=131600.
2.3. Circadian Rest-Activity Rhythmicity (Relative Amplitude)
From the summary five second epoch data, a measure of relative am-
plitude (RA) was calculated using Clocklab Version 6 (Actimetrics). This
accelerometer-derived activity measure has demonstrated reliability
and validity [27]. RA is used commonly as a non-parametric measure
of rest-activity rhythm amplitude. It is defined as the relative difference
between the most active continuous 10-h period (M10) and the least
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Circadian rhythms are important for the maintenance of both
physical and mental wellbeing, and disrupted rest/activity
rhythms are recognised as core features of both bipolar disorder
and major depressive disorder. The underlying genetic architec-
ture of disrupted circadian rhythmicity is not yet fully understood.
Genetic studies to date include candidate gene analyses of core
“clock” gene variants and larger-scale genome-wide studies of
subjective reports of sleep duration, insomnia and chronotype.
We searched PubMed for human studies of the genetics of
objectively-assessed circadian rhythmicity and mood disorders
published in English before November 1, 2017. We used
“accelerometry” or “actigraphy”, and “bipolar” or “depression”, and
“circadian” and “amplitude”, and “gene” or “gwas” as search
terms. We identified only 5 studies of interest. Some compared
expression of circadian clock genes – as measures of circadian
rhythmicity – between healthy controls and patients with mood
disorders, or in response to different therapeutic drugs. Others ap-
plied genetic linkage analysis to actigraph (activity) data from both
healthy individuals and from patients with mood disorders. Addi-
tional searches of “relative amplitude” (a common derived measure
of circadian rest-activity rhythmicity) and “mood disorders” found
that most studies reported lower amplitude in individuals with bi-
polar disorder or depression versus controls. More specifically, re-
cently, low relative amplitude was reported to be associated with
several mood disorder phenotypes within UK Biobank.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first large scale genome-wide asso-
ciation study of relative amplitude, an objective measure of rest-
activity cycles. We identified genes of interest with putative bio-
logical links to mood disorders. We also identified associations be-
tween polygenic risk of low relative amplitude and major
depression, neuroticism and mood instability.
Implications of all the available evidence
Circadian rhythm disruption is a core feature of mood disorders
and the genetic variants identified in this study may be involved
in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. These findings could
provide new insights into the biology of both circadian function
and mood disorders, and may lead to new treatment targets for
mood disorders.

M10 is the mean activity during the continuous 10 h period contain-
ing maximum activity in each 24 h recording period (midnight to mid-
night). L5 is the mean activity for the corresponding 5 h period
containing the minimum activity within the same recording period.
For each individual, the RA data point was the mean RA value across
all included 24-h periods (seven days). RA ranges from 0 to 1, with
higher values indicating greater distinction between activity levels dur-
ing the most and least active periods of the day.
Participants who provided accelerometer data for b72 h (excluded
N = 3) or who did not provide data for all one-hour periods within
the 24-h cycle were excluded from analyses (excluded N = 6860). Par-
ticipants were also excluded if their data was identified by UK Biobank
as having poor calibration; we excluded participants with data flagged
by UK Biobank as unreliable (unexpectedly small or large size (excluded
N = 32)) and participants whose wear-time overlapped with a daylight
savings clock change (excluded N = 4500) [24]. In the current sample
(N = 91,870), mean RA was 0·87 (SD = 0·06; range 0·121–0·997),
similar to previously reported values in healthy populations [8], how-
ever the distribution of RA values observed in our sample was nega-
tively skewed (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Several further metrics of circadian rhythm can be derived from
accelerometry data, e.g., interdaily stability, intradaily variability and
cosinor amplitude. However, these measure are more vulnerable than
RA to noise or small numbers of data points (as used here), or assume
data take sinusoidal form (cosinor amplitude) [29, 30], which often
does not apply to rest-activity data.
2.4. Genotyping and Imputation
UK Biobank released genotypic data for over 500,000 participants
using two genotyping arrays specifically designed for UK Biobank with
95% shared marker content [31]. Approximately 10% of these partici-
pants were genotyped using Applied Biosystems UK BiLEVE Axiom
array by Affymetrix each containing over 800,000 markers (with 95%
common content between arrays), with the remaining participants
being genotyped using Applied Biosystems UK Biobank Axiom Array.
Phasing on the autosomes was done using SHAPEIT3 using the 1000 Ge-
nomes Phase 3 dataset as a reference panel. Imputation of a further
90,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes was car-
ried out using IMPUTE4; employing as reference both the merged
UK10K and 1000 Genomes Phase 3 reference panel, as used for the UK
Biobank interim genotype data release, and the HRC reference panel.
Pre-imputation quality control, imputation and post-imputation
cleaning were conducted centrally by UK Biobank, described in an
open access document [31].
2.5. Primary GWAS of Low Relative Amplitude
Our primary GWAS was a study of cases of low RA defined as cases
with a mean RA greater than two standard deviations below the overall
mean RA, with the remaining participants as controls [24]. Before pro-
ceeding with genetic analyses, exclusions were applied to the data. Indi-
viduals were removed according to UK Biobank genomic analysis
exclusions, failure of quality control, gender mismatch, sex chromo-
some aneuploidy, ethnicity (not Caucasian), lack of accelerometry
data, plus other accelerometry exclusions, as noted above. For related
individuals (first cousins or closer), a single individual was randomly se-
lected from each pair of related individuals for inclusion in the analysis.
After these (and the acclelerometry-based) exclusions, 71,500 individ-
uals were available for GWAS. Data was further refined by removing
SNPs with an imputation score of b0·8, minor allele frequency of
b0·01 and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p b 1 × 10−6 resulting in
7,969,123 variants remaining.
The primary association analysis was conducted using logistic re-
gression in PLINK [32]; an additive allelic effects model was used with
sex, age, genotyping array, and the first eight genetic principal compo-
nents as covariates. For the GWAS, genome-wide significance was less
than p b 5 × 10−8.
2.6. Secondary GWAS of RA as a Continuous Trait
The BOLT-LMM method allows the inclusion of related individuals
within GWAS. This method relaxes the assumptions of the standard
GWAS, as used above, by using a mixture of two Gaussian priors and
is a generalisation of a standard mixed model. This mixed model ac-
counts for both relatedness and population stratification; this results
in greater power when compared to principal component analysis
[33]. As above, individuals were removed according to UK Biobank ge-
nomic analysis exclusions, failure of quality control, gender mismatch,
sex chromosome aneuploidy, ethnicity (not Caucasian), and lack of
accelerometry data. After these exclusions, 77,440 individuals were
available for this GWAS. As above, genome-wide significance was less
than p b 5 × 10−8. Note that due to the imbalance in sample size be-
tween cases and controls available for low RA, we were unable to use
the BOLT-LMM approach for the primary GWAS [33].
2.7. Expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) Analysis
The lead SNP from each locus, identified by GWAS, was assessed for
the possibility of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). This
genotype-specific gene expression was assessed using the GTEx portal.
The portal was also used to investigate tissue-specific expression for
the implicated genes [34].
2.8. Gene-Based Analysis
The summary statistics from both the primary and secondary GWAS
analyses were uploaded to FUMA web application for gene-based anal-
yses [35]. Gene-based analyses were carried out based on the MAGMA
method using all genetic associations within the summary statistics
[35, 36]. For these analyses genome-wide significance was set at p b 5
× 10−5.
2.9. Genetic Correlations Between Low RA and Psychiatric Phenotypes
Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSR) was applied to the
GWAS summary statistics to provide an estimate of SNP heritability
(h2
SNP) [37, 38]. LDSR was also used to investigate genetic correlations
between low RA and anxiety, ADHD, BD, MDD, mood instability, PTSD,
schizophrenia and insomnia. The LD scores for these disorders were ob-
tained using the summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Con-
sortium, CNCR-Complex Trait Genomics group, and UK Biobank. ADHD,
BD, MDD, schizophrenia and insomnia were analysed using LD Hub [38].
2.10. Psychiatric Diagnoses, Neuroticism and Mood Instability
a) Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder and Generalised
Anxiety Disorder
A mental health questionnaire (MHQ) was developed by a mental
health research reference group to collect additional mental health phe-
notype data in UK Biobank and was administered during 2016–2017
[39]. The MHQ was used to obtain information about individuals' life-
time experiences of psychiatric disorders. The questions were based
281
A. Ferguson et al. / EBioMedicine 35 (2018) 279–287
 on a modified Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form
(CIDI-SF). Lifetime depression (referred to here as ‘lifetime MDD’), ‘life-
time BD’ and lifetime generalised anxiety disorder (referred to as ‘life-
time GAD’) were evaluated based on answers provided by participants
to the online MHQ. Therefore, these measurements represent a likeli-
hood of diagnosis with the disorder of interest, rather than confirmed
diagnoses [39]. Individuals who self-reported BD or MDD were ex-
cluded from the control groups. The ‘lifetime’ variables were also mutu-
ally exclusive. Designated cases for one variable were excluded from
both the case and control groups for the other variables of interest.
This approach was taken to minimise the confounding that comorbidity
of psychiatric phenotypes could have on the analyses. Due to these ex-
clusions, the number of observations for each association tested was
different.
b) Neuroticism
To define neuroticism a score was taken from the 12-item neuroti-
cism scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Short
Form (EPQ-R-S) [40, 41]. Individuals were given a score of 0 or 1 for a
“no or yes” answer to each item, with total score from 0 to 12.
c) Mood instability
A “mood instability” outcome measure was also obtained from the
EPQ-R-S questionnaire: for one question participants were asked
“Does your mood often go up and down?” and given the option to answer
“yes”, “no”, “don't know” or “prefer not to answer” [40]. Individuals who
selected “don't know” or “prefer not to answer” were coded as missing;
this allowed the generation of a categorical mood instability variable
where those who answered “yes” were designated as cases and
participants who answered “no” were controls, those answering
“don't know” and “prefer not to answer” were excluded [42].
2.11. Association Between PRS for Low RA and Affective Disorder
Phenotypes
Associations between higher PRS for low RA and psychiatric diagno-
ses were examined in up to 76,018 individuals who had completed the
MHQ and who were not included in the primary GWAS. Similarly, asso-
ciations between low RA PRS and mood instability/neuroticism were
examined in between 91,248 and 140,504 individuals (depending on
the dependent variable) not included in the GWAS. PRS including
SNPs at 6 different significance thresholds (p b 5 × 10−8, p b 5 × 10−5,
p b 0·01, p b 0·05, p b 0·1, p b 0·5) were divided into quartiles, with
the exception of p b 5 × 10−8 which was divided into tertiles as only
three different PRS were generated for this threshold. The top and bot-
tom quantiles were compared in logistic regression models that were
adjusted for age, sex, Townsend deprivation index [43], genotype
array and the first eight genetic principal components. False discovery
rate (FDR) correction was applied [44, 45].
3. Results
3.1. GWAS of Low RA
Our primary analysis was a case-control GWAS of low RA. The GWAS
data showed only a slight deviation in test statistics compared to the
null (λGC = 1·016, Fig. 1); this deviation may be due to the polygenic
architecture of low relative amplitude. SNP heritability (h2
SNP)
accounted for b1% of the population variance (h2
SNP = 0·0067, se =
0·0054). The Manhattan plot for low RA GWAS is presented in Fig. 1.
Two independent genomic loci on chromosomes 1 and 22 were associ-
ated with low RA at genome-wide significance, including three SNPs
(described in Supplementary Table 3). These SNPs highlighted two

 candidate gene loci: Neurofascin (NFASC) on chromosome 1 and Solute
Carrier Family 25 Member 17 (SLC25A17) on chromosome 22 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). As each of these SNPs is an intronic variant, the exact ef-
fect of each polymorphism is unclear.
3.2. GWAS of Continuous RA
As a secondary analysis, we performed a GWAS of a continuous mea-
sure of RA using a BOLT-LMM model. The BOLT-LMM GWAS showed a
slight deviation in the test statistics compared to the null (λGC =
1·054, Fig. 2), again consistent with a polygenic architecture for RA.
The h2
SNP for RA as a continuous measure accounted for N8% of the pop-
ulation variance (h2
SNP = 0·085, se = 0·00035). Five SNPs, all localised
to one locus on chromosome 2, were associated with continuous RA at
genome-wide significance (described in Supplementary Table 3).
These SNPs highlight the Meis Homeobox 1 (MEIS1) gene. Again, as
noted above, these are intronic SNPs and their exact effects are not
known.
3.3. Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) Analysis
The lead SNPs from both GWAS were assessed for potential eQTLs.
Only the lead SNP found on chromosome 22 (rs9611417) was associ-
ated with the expression of a nearby gene. Being heterozygous at
rs9611417 was associated with lower expression of RANGAP1 gene in
oesophageal mucosa in comparison to rs9611417 C allele homozygotes
(Beta = −0·43, p = 7·2 × 10−5, Supplementary Fig. 6). Information on
the influence of G homozygotes was not available.
3.4. Gene-Based Analysis of RA
Gene-based analyses of both low RA and continuous RA were under-
taken. The gene-based analysis of low RA identified two genes signifi-
cantly associated with low RA: Forkhead Box J1 (FOXJ1) on
chromosome 17, and Zinc Finger FYVE-type Containing 21 (ZFYVE21)
on chromosome 14 (Supplementary Fig. 4). The gene set analysis of
continuous RA identified three genes: Copine 4 (CPNE4) and Chromo-
some 3 open reading frame 62 (C3orf62) on chromosome 3, and
Renalase (RNLS) on chromosome 10 (Supplementary Fig. 5).
3.5. Genetic Correlation Between Low RA and Psychiatric Phenotypes
There was preliminary evidence of genetic correlation between low
RA and insomnia (rg = 0·90, se = 0·42, p = 0·033), suggesting that
the biology underlying low RA may be associated with the regulation
of sleep (Table 1). However, on FDR correction this was not statistically
significant. There was a negative genetic correlation between low RA
and continuous RA (rg = −1·28, se = 0·38, p = 0·0008). As low RA
is derived from the continuous measure of RA, a negative correlation
was expected. There were no significant genetic correlations identified
between low RA and ADHD, anxiety, BD, MDD, mood instability, PTSD
and schizophrenia.
3.6. Association Between PRS for Low RA and Affective Disorder Phenotypes
The findings of analyses assessing the association between low RA
PRS and several mood disorder-related phenotypes are presented in
Table 2. Positive associations were identified between increased PRS
and mood instability at all PRS thresholds, with the exception of
genome-wide significance (p b 5 × 10−8). For MDD, small positive asso-
ciations were found for the low RA PRS at the top three significance
thresholds (OR = 1·02–1·03), which remained significant after FDR
correction (p = 0·025–0·05). A positive association with neuroticism
was found for the highest threshold (p = 0·004, FDR adjusted p =
0·021). However, other associations between the remaining PRS
thresholds and neuroticism score were not significant. These associa-
tions did not significantly differ when including individuals with more
than one psychiatric phenotype (results not shown).

 4. Discussion
We present the first large-scale genetic study of an objective mea-
sure of rest-activity cycles in humans, as well as the first study to exam-
ine how common risk SNPs for circadian disruption might be associated
with mood disorder phenotypes. The primary GWAS of low RA identi-
fied three genome-wide significant SNPs within two independent loci;
two of the SNPs highlighted were found to be in relatively high LD (r2
= 0·66–1·00) in many populations [46] and are potentially tagging a
single underlying functional variant influencing low RA. The secondary
GWAS of RA as a continuous measure also identified five genome-wide
significant SNPs at a single locus, within the MEIS1 gene on chromosome
2. Again, the SNPs identified are in medium to high LD with each other
(r2 = 0·39–1·00) in many populations [47].
On inspection of the Manhattan plots there were several peaks
whose lead SNPs had p-values below the suggestive evidence for signif-
icance threshold (p b 5 × 10−5 to p b 1 × 10−7) (Supplementary Ta-
bles 4 and 5). There was no genetic overlap between the SNPs
identified for low RA and those identified for continuous RA at these
thresholds. This suggests there is a partial genetic distinction between
the pathological low RA measure and the broader range of RA.
4.1. Genes of Interest
Of considerable interest is that one of the genes highlighted by
GWAS was NFASC, a gene encoding the neurofascin protein [48].
Neurofascin is an L1 family immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule
that interacts with several proteins to anchor voltage-gated Na+ chan-
nels to the intracellular skeleton in neurons [48]. It is involved in neurite
outgrowth and organization of axon initial segments (AIS) during early
development [48]. These AIS complexes (comprising neurofascin, anky-
rin G (encoded by ANK3), gliomedin and betaIV spectrin) are important
for the generation of action potentials and for the maintenance of neu-
ronal integrity [49]. Notably, polymorphisms in ANK3 are robustly asso-
ciated with BD [50]. The direct binding of neurofascin to ankyrin G at the
AIS therefore represents a potentially important biological link between
circadian rhythmicity and BD. The NFASC SNPs identified by the GWAS
were intronic variants and the NFASC transcript undergoes extensive al-
ternative splicing with not all variants being functionally categorised
[48]. The precise influence these variants have on the NFASC gene is cur-
rently unclear.
One of the genome-wide significant SNPs from the primary GWAS is
located within SLC25A17. This gene encodes a peroxisomal solute carrier
membrane protein that transports several cofactors from the cytosol to
the peroxisomal matrix [51]. Variants of this gene have previously been
associated with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia [52]. The
SLC25A17 gene is also involved in adrenomyeloneuropathy [53], an
inherited condition in which long chain fatty acids accumulate in the
central nervous system (CNS) disrupting several brain functions [54].
The risk allele at the SNP identified in the GWAS of low RA
(rs9611417) was associated with lower expression of RANGAP1, a
GTPase activator protein involved in nuclear transport [55]. RANGAP1
is 439 kb downstream of rs9611417 and shows relatively high expres-
sion in the brain (Supplementary Fig. 7).

 The GWAS of RA as a continuous measure highlighted SNPs within
the MEIS1 gene. This gene encodes a homeobox transcription factor
(TF) protein crucial for the normal development of several tissues, in-
cluding the CNS [56, 57]. The MEIS1 gene is also associated with myeloid
leukaemia [56] and restless leg syndrome 7 (a sleep-wake disorder) [56,
57].
4.2. Gene-Based Analyses
The gene-based analysis of low RA identified two genes: FOXJ1 on
chromosome 17, and ZFYVE21 on chromosome 14. FOXJ1 encodes a
forkhead TF protein which has a role in cell differentiation in respira-
tory, reproductive, immune, and CNS tissues. FOXJ1 is required for the
formation of cilia [58]. In mouse models, FOXJ1 was reported to be im-
portant for neurogenesis within the forebrain and olfactory bulb [58].
The ZFYVE21 gene encodes the zinc-finger FYVE-type containing 21 pro-
tein, involved in cell migration and adhesion [59]. The potential involve-
ment of this gene in the brain and circadian function is currently
unclear.
For the continuous measure of RA, three genes were identified in
the gene-based analysis: CPNE4 and C3orf62 (chromosome 3); and
RNLS on (chromosome 10). The CPNE4 gene encodes a calcium-
dependent phospholipid binding protein involved in membrane traf-
ficking and may be involved in intracellular calcium-mediated pro-
cesses [60]. Deletion of this gene has been associated with earlier
age-of-onset of Alzheimer's disease [61]. Currently, the C3orf62 gene
is an uncharacterised protein coding gene that has not been function-
ally annotated [62].
RNLS encodes a flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent amine oxi-
dase, known as Renalase, an enzyme hormone secreted from the kid-
ney into the bloodstream [63]. Renalase is involved in mediating
cardiac function and blood pressure by influencing heart rate and
has been associated with hypertension, chronic kidney failure and
type 1 diabetes prediction [63–66]. It is worth noting that disrupted
circadian rhythmicity has been associated with both diabetes and hy-
pertension in several studies [4, 67, 68], and that RNLS has been asso-
ciated with both treatment outcome and episode recurrence in BD
[69].
4.3. Polygenic Risk for Low RA and Psychiatric Phenotypes
We found little evidence of genetic correlation between low RA and
psychiatric phenotypes. This is perhaps surprising given the literature
on circadian rhythmicity and mood disorders. Core circadian clock
genes have been associated with both BD and depression, with altered
circadian biology suggested to be a vulnerability marker for mood disor-
ders [70–74]. It has been suggested that the treatment of disrupted cir-
cadian rhythmicity could be used in combination with current
pharmaceutical therapies to develop more effective treatments for
mood disorders [75]. Therefore, a more complete understanding of cir-
cadian rhythmicity in the context of mood disorders is required.
Further, as noted above, within the UK Biobank cohort we recently
found that lower RA was associated with several adverse mental health
outcomes [24]. In the current study, we found some evidence for associ-
ation between greater polygenic risk for low RA and both MDD and neu-
roticism. Across several PRS thresholds, we identified a more robust
association between increasing PRS for low RA and the phenotype of
mood instability. Mood instability is a common symptom that cuts
across several psychiatric disorders and, as such, may be a more useful
phenotype than categorical diagnoses for understanding underlying bi-
ology [76]. The possibility of a direct link between genetic loading for
circadian disruption and the experience of dysregulated or unstable
mood is therefore of considerable interest and merits further
investigation.
5. Limitations
Several limitations are acknowledged. UK Biobank may not be fully
representative of the general UK population [77], with a possible
under-representation of individuals with psychiatric disorders. The
polygenic risk scores created using only the genome-wide significant
SNPs did not show any associations with lifetime mood disorder diag-
noses, mood instability or neuroticism outcomes tested. As only 3
genome-wide significant SNPs were included in these analyses, they
may be underpowered. The PRSs (at other thresholds) showed rela-
tively small effects overall on the traits investigated and appeared to ex-
plain only a small proportion of the variance within the traits.. The use of
the LDSC package for estimating SNP heritability in low RA cases (1.2
million SNPs rather than 9 million SNPs assessed by the BOLT-LMM ap-
proach) could have resulted in an underestimation of trait heritability.
Also, with the relatively small sample size of low RA cases, our analyses
may be underpowered resulting in a lower estimate of SNP heritability
than expected (for example, compared to chronotype) [18]. Previous in-
vestigations of accelerometer-based phenotypes using selected clinical
samples (such as bipolar disorder) reported higher heritability esti-
mates (h2 N 0·30) [78]. The use of a non-clinical, general population co-
hort with potential under-representation of psychiatric disorders, may
also have resulted in a SNP heritability estimate lower than might be
expected.
In terms of phenotyping, the mood instability phenotype was a self-
reported subjective measure that may be influenced by response bias.
Further, we were unable to identify a direction of causality between
RA and the psychiatric phenotypes: approaches to causality such as
Mendelian randomisation (MR) were not possible due to the small
number of genome-wide significant SNPs identified by both GWAS
analyses [79].
Circadian rhythms are subject to influence from both biological fac-
tors and environmental stimuli. It is a potential limitation of this inves-
tigation that the analyses were not adjusted for potential non-genetic
confounders operating during the accelerometry data collection period,
such as medical illness, medication status, chronic pain transmeridian
air travel, obesity and irregular work patterns, all factors known to affect
circadian rhythmicity. The accelerometers were worn for 7 days which
may not accurately represent rhythmicity, particularly in working par-
ticipants where weekend rhythms might differ substantially from
weekday rhythms. Further studies are required to investigate the possi-
ble interaction between RA and environmental factors; future investiga-
tions may also benefit from the inclusion of other measures of RA
variability to adjust for intra- and inter-individual activity levels.
6. Conclusions
Overall, our findings contribute new knowledge on the genetic ar-
chitecture of rest-activity cycles and how this overlaps with some
mood disorder phenotypes, such as mood instability. Several of the ge-
netic variants identified are located within or close to genes which may
have a role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. It is hoped that
these findings will act as stimulus for future work assessing the complex
biological relationships between circadian function and psychiatric
disorders.
