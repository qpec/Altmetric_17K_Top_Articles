Abstract
Background and aim: Social support is an important factor that can affect mental health. In recent decades,
many studies have been done on the impact of social support on mental health. The purpose of the present study
is to investigate the effect size of the relationship between social support and mental health in studies in Iran.
Methods: This meta-analysis was carried out in studies that were performed from 1996 through 2015. Databases
included SID and Magiran, the comprehensive portal of human sciences, Noor specialized magazine databases,
IRANDOC, Proquest, PubMed, Scopus, ERIC, Iranmedex and Google Scholar. The keywords used to search
these websites included “mental health or general health,” and “Iran” and “social support.” In total, 64 studies
had inclusion criteria meta-analysis. In order to collect data used from a meta-analysis worksheet that was made
by the researcher and for data analysis software, CMA-2 was used.
Results: The mean of effect size of the 64 studies in the fixed-effect model and random-effect model was
obtained respectively as 0.356 and 0.330, which indicated the moderate effect size of social support on mental
health. The studies did not have publication bias, and enjoyed a heterogeneous effect size. The target population
and social support questionnaire were moderator variables, but sex, sampling method, and mental health
questionnaire were not moderator variables.
Conclusion: Regarding relatively high effect size of the correlation between social support and mental health, it
is necessary to predispose higher social support, especially for women, the elderly, patients, workers, and
students.
Keywords: Social support, Mental health, Meta-analysis, General health
1. Introduction
The World Health Organization defines mental health as a state of well-being, that in which the individual knows
their capabilities and uses them effectively and productively that will be useful for their respective communities (1).
Considering that health is a concept influenced by a set of complex factors, i.e. biological, psychological, social,
cultural, economic and spiritual, it should be acknowledged that health and mental illness do not simply have
biological or psychological aspects, but also have concurrent social dimensions and nature. Social factors, which can
play an important role in creating, maintaining, and promoting health, have been a major role in incidence,
prevalence and persistence of the disease (2). In this respect, it is very important to pay attention to social factors
influencing mental health, and perceived social support is one of those factors. Social support represents the amount
of support that a person perceives and reports receive it. Social support is a phenomenon that involves interactions of
people so that when a person offers social interaction, it has an important role in his health (3). Social support alone
is not important, but what is important is the belief in the existence of social support (4). Social support provides
physical and psychological advantages for people faced with stressful physical and psychosocial events, and is
considered as a factor reducing the psychological distress when faced with stressful events (5). Numerous studies

have been performed on the effect of social support on health, quality of life, and especially mental health over the
recent decades. However, each study has been performed on a different population, and has used different
instruments, sampling methods and statistical populations, which have resulted in different results. For instance (6-
8) found a strong correlation between social support and mental health, and (9-11) found a weak correlation in this
regard. Hence, in the face of much varied and sometimes contradictory scientific information for quick and precise
extraction of information, it is necessary that resources be extracted systematically and results be integrated to
achieve a tangible and overall result. This helps to minimize bias in these studies, and also reduce errors (12). In
meta-analysis, the aim is not only to summarize the literature to an average effect size, but to try to determine the
factors that affect the size effects (13). The approach allows the researcher to determine the features specific to the
previous studies and factors making the effect sizes of the studies different, and to make conclusions about the
correlations between variables more decisively (12). In total, 41 studies were collected to perform a meta-analysis
on the effect of social support on physical health. The results of their analysis showed the correlation of social
support with the failure to practice health and the increased mortality in the range of -0.60 to +0.23 (14). A 2005
study by De Silva in a systematic review, examined 21 research studies that had been done on the relationship
between social capital and mental health (15). Another study examined correlation of 16 health outcome variables,
including health status, physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, depression, role performance, behavior,
physical compatibility, psychological adjustment, living adaptability, coping behaviors, stress, health belief, health
promoting behaviors, quality of life, well-being, and self-actualization with social support. Results showed that
social support can significantly predict all health outcomes, except physical compatibility, at the level of (0.0001)
(16). (In a meta-analysis, 122 research studies on relationship between structural or functional social support with
patient adherence to medical regimens were examined (17). Results showed that significant effect size of research
variables on patient adherence and the content and methodology variables influenced the size effect (17). A meta-
analysis in this regard was performed in Iran (18). However, they reviewed only 8 studies, which is not a good
representative for available research community, and did not examine the moderator variables, such as sex,
measurement instruments, and sampling methods. Therefore, this study was conducted to review the previous
studies, combine the results, and assess those studies more comprehensively and accurately, taking into account the
moderator variables relevant to the effect size of correlation of social support on mental health in the Iranian
population.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Research design and search strategy
In this systematic review, the correlation of social support and mental health was examined through meta-analysis.
The statistical population of this study included all published and unpublished articles, studies, and dissertations
performed from 1996 through 2015 on the correlation of social support with mental health in Iran. To collect the
relevant studies, initial searches were carried out in Iranian databases, including the Iranian Research Institute for
Information Science and Technology (IRANDOC), Scientific Information Database (SID) and Magiran,
Comprehensive Portal of Human Sciences, Noor specialized magazine, and Google Scholar databases, to find
Iranian articles and theses published in Farsi; and then in foreign databases, including Proquest, PubMed, Scopus,
ERIC, Iranmedex, and also, Google Scholar, advance searches were carried out to find Iranian articles that were
published in English in the relevant area. The keywords used to search the above websites included “mental health
or general health,” “Iran,” and “social support.”
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria in the meta-analysis were as follows: a) studies should be performed on the correlation of
social support with mental health, b) the theses should be related to the M.Sc. or Ph.D. degree (available in
IRANDOC), c) the method should be experimental, quasi-experimental, post-event, or co relational, and d) all
studies should be performed during the years 1996 through 2015. Exclusion criteria included: a) failure to
investigate the relationship between social support and mental health, b) absence of full-text of article c) failure to
report statistics to calculate effect sizes, d) descriptive study or review. Retrieval and selection process of studies is
shown in the Figure 1.
2.3. Quality assessment and data analysis
In the next step, the data related to those 64 studies were encoded and then recorded in the worksheet of the meta-
analysis. The worksheet was specifically designed by the researcher to record the required data of the meta-analysis.
The worksheet included the title of the study, authors’ details, university name, website information, the year and
place of the study, the study variables, research questions and hypotheses, sex of the samples, the statistical
 http://www.ephysician.ir
Page 5214
population, sample size, occupation, educational level, province, mental health instrument, type of support, the study
design, statistical tests, significance level, and the effect size. The Comprehensive Meta-analysis software (CMA-2)
was used to analyze the collected data. In the data analysis, the correlation coefficient was calculated as the
estimator of the effect size in each study. The Hunter-Schmidt meta-analysis approach was used to calculate the
combined effect size (the combined effect size of the variables in both fixed-effect and random-effect model). The
Egger's regression intercept, classic fail-safe N test, Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill, and funnel plot were used to
examine the publication bias. The Q and I2 tests were used to analyze the homogeneity of the studies.
Figure1. Retrieval and selection process of studies
3. Results
In this study, 64 studies (13 theses and 51 articles) were collected and analyzed. About 36% of the studies had been
performed in Tehran, Iran. Most of the studies (77%) had been performed both on men and women, and most of the
studies (almost 90%) had been performed from 2006 through 2013 (Table 1). The target population of one third of
the studies was initially, university students and then workers (including employees, nurses, & teachers). The studies
performed on the older adults and patients comprised 14% and 11%, respectively. About 60% of the studies had
used GHQ-28 to measure mental health, and 20% of the studies had used GHQ-12. The most popular questionnaire
used to measure social support in the studies was Zimet’s questionnaire and then Philip’s and Stanford’s
questionnaires. Almost one third of the studies had used cluster sampling method to select samples. The mean of
effect size of 64 studies was obtained as 0.356, based on the fixed-effect model and 0.330, based on the random-
effect model, which was higher than the average level in the standards presented by Cohen (19), and indicated the
effectiveness of social support in mental health in the Iranian population. The results of Egger's regression (t=1.505
& p>0.05) showed that the intercept of the regression line in the studies was almost zero, which implies no
publication bias in the studies. According to the results of the classic fail-safe N test, 4,524 studies with mean effect
size of zero should be entered to effect size could be cancelled, which showed the reliability of the total effect size.
Based on Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill and funnel plot, in the fixed and random-effect model, 13 and 11 studies
respectively should be added to the right side to make the funnel plot symmetric (Figure 2). The Q statistic was used
to examine the heterogeneity of the studies. The Q statistic was obtained as 941.320 for the studies, and it could be
concluded that the studies were heterogeneous (p≤0.001). Furthermore, I2 showed that 93.307% of variations in all
the studies were due to the heterogeneity of the studies. In this respect, the sex, target population, sampling method,
and instruments for measurement of social support and mental health were examined as moderator variables (Table
2).

Figure 2. Funnel plot
According to Table 2, the Z statistic showed a significant difference between different classes of the variables (the
sex, target population, sampling method, and instruments for measurement of social support and mental health) in
terms of the effect size. The results showed that the studies on females (0.372) had higher effect size than the studies
on males (0.341). This result indicated the higher correlation of social support on females’ mental health. The
analysis of the target population of the studies revealed the high effect of social support on mental health in parents
with disabled children, immigrants, and people seeking to change their sex; the effect size of social support on
mental health in university students, ordinary people, workers, and veterans was higher than the average level; and
the effect size of social support on mental health in female heads of household, infertile couples, school students,
women who had been abused, and older adults, was at the average level. In respect of the sampling method, the
studies that had used census method comprised maximum effect size (0.373) because they had measured the entire
statistical population; and the studies that had used simple random sampling, reported minimum effect size (0.283).
The studies with other sampling methods had the effect size higher than the average level. Furthermore, the study
that had used the mental health subscale of the World Health Organization’s quality of life questionnaire showed the
maximum effect size, and the study that had used GHQ-28 showed the minimum effect size. It is noteworthy that all
effect sizes were higher than average. Regarding the moderator variable, the social support questionnaire and the
studies that had used questionnaires developed by Katrona & Russell, Sherbourne and Stewart, Procidano and
 Electronic physician
Page 5217
Heller, Najarian, Rook & Ituarte, Phillips, and Zimet; and the subscale of social capital questionnaire, had the effect
size higher than the average level. The studies that had used questionnaires developed by Rosenberg, Pierce, and
Fleming to measure the perceived social support, had a small effect size. Considering that the significance level of
the Q statistic for sex, sampling method, and mental health questionnaire was greater than 0.05, it could be argued
that these variables are not moderators of the correlation between social support and mental health. As shown in
Table 2, however, the Q statistic for the target population and social support questionnaire was significant at 0.05.
Therefore, it could be argued by 95% confidence that the target population and social support questionnaire
contributed to the heterogeneity, and were thus considered as moderator variables in the correlation between social
support and mental health.

4. Discussion
The mean of effect size of studies in the fixed-effect model and random-effect model was obtained respectively as
0.356 and 0.330, both of which are significant at 0.001, and are considered average, based on Cohen criteria (19).
These results are aligned with other studies’ results (14, 16, 17). So it can be said that positive social communication
with family members and friends reduces anxiety and develops the feeling of security. People with more positive
ethnical social relations and higher social support enjoy more efficient communication skills, which directs them
away from depression and other mental problems (34). Moreover, Cobb introduces the social support as a protector
against stress in a way that it largely affects social health and performance. Cobb explains that social support gives
people the feeling of being loved, cared, respected, and belonging to a network of communication (78). According to
Durkheim's theory, people do not receive social support and their health is at risk if social unity is poor. Conversely,
a high level of social support protects people from illnesses (7). Also, the results revealed that sex, sampling method
and a mental health questionnaire did not moderate in the correlation between social support and mental health but
the target population and social support questionnaire doesn’t have the role of mediator. The results showed that
studies that have been conducted solely on women, had higher effect size than the studies on men. These results are
aligned with other studies’ results (79, 80, 25). In this respect, the effect size of social support varies with sex in a
way that women discuss their emotional problems with others outside the family, more than men do. It may be more
difficult for men to accept their anxieties, fears, and depressions due to the social perceptions expected from men
regarding their gender role behaviors. Men’s inability to cope with stresses may be deemed their weakness, and thus,
they may not use the support from helping contexts because they are afraid of losing their dignity and status (2). In
this study the effect size of social support on mental health was examined and compared in the different groups.
Results revealed the high correlation of social support with mental health in parents with disabled children,
immigrants, and people seeking to change their sex; the effect size of social support on mental health in university
students, ordinary people, workers, and veterans was higher than the average level; and the effect size of social
support on mental health in female heads of household, infertile couples, school students, women who had been
abused, and older adults was at the average level. According to Rathus, social support reduces the adverse effects of
mental stress in 5 ways: emotional attention, helping, information, assessment of others’ feedback about the quality
of performance, and sociability (20). University students and workers who access social networks more than others
are more likely to contact social support networks and be more skilled in receiving social support when they
experience stressful situations or have problems. Furthermore, immigrants with higher social, mental, and financial
support; kinship networks; sense of belonging and attachment; and participation in various aspects of social life in
new environments enjoy better mental health in that new society (43). Parents who have disabled children but
receive social support, are capable of giving meaning to life problems, mental stresses, physical disabilities, and the
psychological vulnerability and consequently, reducing mental pressure (57). In older adult communities , it should
be said that older people who receive more social support and participate in different aspects of social life more than
others, enjoy more favorable mental health. Perceived social support can inhibit the adverse physiological
complications of diseases and increase self-care among older people (31). In the field of social support on patients’
mental health, patientscertainly find themselves in a precarious situation and look for support that decreases their
anxiety and discomfort, and thus, social support in such a situation can reduce their anxiety and discomfort (25). The
results showed that the studies that had used census method showed maximum effect size, because this method
investigates the entire study population and consequently, is more accurate.
5. Conclusions
Regarding the significant correlation of social support on mental health, the relevant authorities are recommended to
hold seminars for the families of school students, university students, workers, older adults, and vulnerable groups,
and offer training brochures to them in order to make them aware of their irreplaceable support, emphasize the
persistency of family relations, and provide them with practical strategies for improving relations. Counseling
centers can teach practical strategies for receiving social support through holding training workshops in order to
improve their mental health, and prevent the incidence of psychological problems and other behavioral disorders and
emotional inconsistencies. Researchers are recommended to pay more attention to the relationship between social
support and mental health in special and damaged groups. Furthermore, researchers are suggested to use
measurement instruments with high reliability and validity regarding the influence of the type of questionnaire on
the effect size of the studies.
