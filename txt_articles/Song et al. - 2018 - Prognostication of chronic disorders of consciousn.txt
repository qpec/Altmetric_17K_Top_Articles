Abstract Disorders of consciousness are a heterogeneous mixture of different diseases or
injuries. Although some indicators and models have been proposed for prognostication, any single
method when used alone carries a high risk of false prediction. This study aimed to develop a
multidomain prognostic model that combines resting state functional MRI with three clinical
characteristics to predict one year-outcomes at the single-subject level. The model discriminated
between patients who would later recover consciousness and those who would not with an
accuracy of around 88% on three datasets from two medical centers. It was also able to identify the
prognostic importance of different predictors, including brain functions and clinical characteristics.
To our knowledge, this is the first reported implementation of a multidomain prognostic model
that is based on resting state functional MRI and clinical characteristics in chronic disorders of
consciousness, which we suggest is accurate, robust, and interpretable.

Introduction
Severe brain injury can lead to disorders of consciousness (DOC). Some patients recover conscious-
ness after an acute brain insult, whereas others tragically fall into chronic DOC. The latter cannot
communicate functionally or behave purposefully. Most patients remain bedridden, and require
laborious
care.
The
medical
community
is
often
confronted
with
an
inability
to
meet
the expectations of the chronic DOC patients’ families. The social, economic, and ethical consequen-
ces are also tremendous (Bernat, 2006). In parallel, although more validations are required, recent
pilot studies have proposed new therapeutic interventions, which challenge the existing practice of
early treatment discontinuation for a chronic DOC patient (Schiff et al., 2007; Corazzol et al.,
2017; Yu et al., 2017). However, before using these novel therapeutic interventions, clinicians first
need to determine whether the patient is a suitable candidate. The availability of an accurate and

 robust prognostication is therefore a fundamental concern in the clinical management of chronic
DOC patients, as medical treatment, rehabilitation therapy and even ethical decisions depend on
this information.
To date, the prognostication for a DOC patient is based on physician observation of the patient’s
behavior over period that is sufficient to allow determination of whether there is any evidence of
awareness. On the one hand, a patient’s motor impairment, sensory deficit, cognitive damage, fluc-
tuation of vigilance and medical complications could give rise to misjudgments; on the other hand,
for the assessor, a lack of knowledge regarding DOC, poor training and non-use of adequate behav-
ioral scales are additional elements that may contribute to a high possibility of mistakes. Conse-
quently, careful and repeated behavioral assessments are considered to be particularly important for
a precise diagnostic and prognostic judgment (Wannez et al., 2017). Nonetheless, behavioral
assessments are inevitably subjective and vulnerable to a variety of personal interferences
(Giacino et al., 2009). Physicians and scientists have therefore been seeking accurate and objective
markers for diagnosis and prognosis (Demertzi et al., 2017; Noirhomme et al., 2017).
Several pioneering studies have suggested that the etiology, incidence age and duration of DOC
are important indicators for prognosis (Multi-Society Task Force on PVS, 1994). Specifically,
patients who have non-traumatic brain injury are expected to have a worse functional recovery than
traumatic brain injury patients, and young patients were considered more likely to have a favorable
outcome than older ones. During the recent decades, some pilot prognostic models have also been
explored that are based on features of neurological examination (Zandbergen et al., 1998;
Booth et al., 2004; Dolce et al., 2008), abnormalities detected with electroencephalogram (EEG)
and evoked potentials (Steppacher et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2014; Hofmeijer and van Putten,
2016; Chennu et al., 2017), anatomical and functional changes identified with brain computed
tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
(Maas et al., 2007; Sidaros et al., 2008; Neuro Imaging for Coma Emergence and Recovery Con-
sortium et al., 2012; Luyt et al., 2012; Stender et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2015), and physiological
and
biochemical
disturbances
at
both
the
brain
and
body
levels
(Kaneko
et
al.,
2009;
Rundgren et al., 2009). Despite many efforts, however, identifying efficient biomarkers for the early
eLife digest Severe brain injury can lead to disorders of consciousness (DOC), such as a coma.
Some patients regain consciousness after injury, while others do not. Those who do not recover are
unable to communicate or move in purposeful ways, and need long-term care. It can be difficult for
physicians to predict which patients will mend. This is mainly based on their observations of the
patient’s behavior over time. But such perceptions are subjective and vulnerable to errors. More
accurate and objective methods are needed.
Several studies suggest that the cause of the injury, the age of the person at the time of injury,
and how long the person has had a DOC may predict recovery. Recent studies have shown that
using a brain-imaging tool called resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
measure communication between different parts of the brain may help to calculate the likelihood of
recovery.
Now, Song, Yang et al. show that combining resting state fMRI with three pieces of clinical
information may help to better predict who will improve. Song et al. created a computer model that
forecasts recovery from DOC based on fMRI results, the cause of the person’s injury, their age at the
time of injury, and how long they have had impaired consciousness. The model could tell which
patients would regain consciousness 88% of the time for 112 patients from two medical centers. It
also identified several patients who got better despite initial predictions from doctors that they
would not.
The experiments show that combining multiple types of information can better predict which
patients with DOC will convalesce. Larger studies are needed to confirm that the computer model is
reliable. If they do, the model may one day help physicians and families to better plan and manage
patients’ care.

 prediction of outcome is still challenging and requires additional research. One of the reasons for
this is that the DOC could have many different causes and could be associated with several neuro-
pathological processes and different severities, such that any method when used alone carries the
risk of false prediction (Bernat, 2016; Rossetti et al., 2016).
Recently, resting state functional MRI (fMRI) has been widely used to investigate the brain func-
tions of DOC patients. Research suggests that these patients demonstrate multiple changes in brain
functional networks, including the default mode (Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2015),
executive control (Demertzi et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2015), salience (Qin et al., 2015; Fischer et al.,
2016),
and
sensorimotor
(Yao
et
al.,
2015),
auditory
(Demertzi
et
al.,
2015),
visual
(Demertzi et al., 2014a) and subcortical networks (He et al., 2015). The within-network and
between-network functional connectivity appeared to be useful indicators of functional brain dam-
age and the likelihood of consciousness recovery (Silva et al., 2015; Di Perri et al., 2016). Taken
together, these studies suggest that the brain networks and functional connectivity detected with
resting state fMRI could be valuable biomarkers that can be used to trace the level of consciousness
and predict the possibility of recovery.
With advances in medicine, prognostication of a DOC patient has moved toward a multidomain
paradigm
that
combines
clinical
examination
with
the
application
of
novel
technologies
(Gosseries et al., 2014). Multidomain assessment has the potential to improve prediction accuracy.
More importantly, it can provide reassurances about the importance of each predictor for prognosti-
cation by offering concordant evidence (Stevens and Sutter, 2013; Rossetti et al., 2016). More
than 20 years ago, the Multi-Society Task Force on persistent vegetative state (PVS) suggested that
the etiology, incidence age and duration of DOC could help to predict the outcome (Multi-
Society Task Force on PVS, 1994), and numerous studies have subsequently validated the clinical
utility of these features (Jennett, 2005; Bruno et al., 2012; Estraneo et al., 2013; Celesia, 2016).
Therefore, it is possible that a multidomain model that combines these clinical characteristics and
resting state fMRI data could improve prognostic predictions at an individual level and could lead to
the early identification of patients who could recover consciousness.
The present work had two major objectives. The first aim was to develop an approach to predict
the prognosis of an individual DOC patient using clinical characteristics and resting state fMRI. The
second aim, building on the first, was to further explore the different prognostic effects of these clin-
ical and brain imaging features.
Materials and methods
The study paradigm is illustrated in Figure 1. Resting state fMRI and clinical data from DOC patients
were collected at the so-called T0 time point when the patients’ vital signs and consciousness level
had stabilized and a diagnosis had been made. Outcomes were assessed at least 12 months after
this T0 time point; at a time referred to as the T1 time point. The principal scales included the Coma
Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Instead of predicting diag-
nosis, this study used the outcome as a target for regression and classification. Using the resting
state fMRI and clinical data from the T0 time point in a training dataset, a regression model was first
developed to fit each patient’s CRS-R score at the T1 time point, after which the optimal cut-off
value for classifying individual patients on the basis of consciousness recovery was calculated. In this
way, we set up the prognostic regression and classification model. Two independent testing data-
sets were then used to validate the model.
Subjects
This study involved three datasets. The datasets referred to as ‘Beijing 750’ and ‘Beijing HDxt’ were
both collected in the PLA Army General Hospital in Beijing, and the same medical group diagnosed
and managed the patients. However, the MRI scanners and imaging acquiring protocols were differ-
ent for these two datasets: the ‘Beijing HDxt’ cohort was scanned with a GE signa HDxt 3.0T scanner
between May 2012 and December 2013, whereas the ‘Beijing 750’ cohort was scanned with a GE
Discovery MR750 3.0T scanner between January 2014 and May 2016. The dataset referred to as
‘Guangzhou HDxt’ was collected from the Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Com-
mand in Guangzhou, and the MRI data were obtained with a GE signa HDxt 3.0T scanner between
April 2011 and December 2014.

 The inclusion criterion was that the patients should be at least 1 month after the acute brain insult
so that they met the DOC diagnosis. Patients were excluded when there was an unstable level of
consciousness (continuous improvement or decline within the two weeks before the T0 time point),
uncertain clinical diagnosis (ambiguity or disagreement between examiners), contraindication for
MRI or large focal brain damage (>30% of total brain volume).
A total of 160 DOC patients were initially enrolled in this study. Eleven patients were excluded
due to large local brain lesions or movement artifacts during MRI scanning. Nine patients died dur-
ing the period of the follow-up, 16 patients were lost to follow-up, and for 12 patients no definite
outcome information was collected at the 12-month endpoint of the follow-up. Thus, according to
the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the follow-up results, the ‘Beijing 750’ dataset included 46
vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) patients and 17 minimally conscious
state (MCS) patients. The ‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset contained 20 VS/UWS patients and 5 MCS patients,
and the ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ dataset contained 16 VS/UWS patients and 8 MCS patients.
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1, with addi-
tional details provided in Appendix 1—table 1, 2 and 3. The ‘Beijing 750’ dataset also included 30
healthy participants, and the ‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset included 10 healthy participants. All of the
healthy participants were free of psychiatric or neurological history. These healthy participants are
referred to as ‘normal controls’. See Appendix 1—table 4 and 5 for details.
As the ‘Beijing 750’ dataset involved more patients than the other two datasets, it was used as
the training dataset for model development and internal validation, whereas the ‘Beijing HDxt’ and
‘Guangzhou HDxt’ datasets were only used for external validation. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the PLA Army General Hospital (protocol No: 2011–097) and by the Ethics
Committee of the Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command (protocol No:
jz20091287). Informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from the legal surrogates of
the patients and from the normal controls.

 Clinical measurements
Diagnosis and consciousness assessments
The diagnosis of each patient in the three datasets was made by experienced physicians according
to the CRS-R scale (Multi-Society Task Force on PVS, 1994; Bernat, 2006; Magrassi et al., 2016).
In the ‘Beijing 750’ and ‘Beijing HDxt’ datasets, the patients underwent the evaluations at least twice
weekly within the 2 weeks before the MRI scanning (i.e. the T0 time point). The highest CRS-R score
was considered as the diagnosis. The CRS-R includes six subscales that address auditory, visual,
motor, oromotor, communication, and arousal functions, which are summed to yield a total score
ranging from 0 to 23.
Outcome assessments
All patients were followed up at least 12 months after MRI scanning, according to the protocols for
DOC described in a number of previous studies (Neuro Imaging for Coma Emergence and Recov-
ery Consortium et al., 2012; Luyt et al., 2012; Stender et al., 2014; Pignat et al., 2016). Basically,
follow-up interviews were performed in four ways, including outpatient visit, assessments by local
physicians, home visit, and telephone/video review. Whenever possible, signs of responsiveness
were detected or reported, the patient was evaluated either in the unit or at home by the hospital
staff. In cases where no change was signaled, patients were examined twice by one hospital physi-
cian via telephone/video reviews at the end of the follow-up process.
For the training dataset, ‘Beijing 750’, two outcome scales were assessed: the GOS and CRS-R.
The GOS is one of the most commonly reported global scales for functional outcome in neurology,
and provides a measurement of outcome ranging from 1 to 5 (1, dead; 2, vegetative state/minimally
conscious state; 3, able to follow commands/unable to live independently; 4, able to live indepen-
dently/unable to return to work or school; 5, good recovery/able to return to work or school).
Although simple to use and highly reliable, the GOS score cannot provide detailed information
about individual differences in consciousness level for DOC patients. By contrast, the CRS-R score
can assist with prognostic assessment in DOC patients (Giacino and Kalmar, 2006). The six sub-
scales in the CRS-R comprise hierarchically arranged items that are associated with brain stem, sub-
cortical and cortical processes. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity,
whereas the highest
items represent cognitively
mediated behaviors.
In
order to simplify
the modeling, we hypothesized that the higher the total CRS-R score at the follow-up, the better the
outcome for the patient. We developed a regression model to fit each patient’s CRS-R score at the
T1 time point based on their clinical characteristics and resting state fMRI data, and designed a clas-
sification model to predict consciousness recovery or not for each patient. The classification accuracy
was assessed by comparing the predicted label and the actual GOS score, that is, ‘consciousness
recovery’ (GOS � 3) versus ‘consciousness non-recovery’ (GOS � 2).
The testing dataset ‘Beijing HDxt’ involved both the GOS scores and the CRS-R scores at the T1
time point for each patient. The testing dataset ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ measured the GOS scores, but
not the CRS-R scores at the T1 time point.
MRI acquisition
All of the participants in the three datasets were scanned with resting state fMRI and T1-weighted
3D high-resolution imaging. During the MRI scanning, the participants did not take any sedative or
anesthetic drugs. The resting state fMRI scan was obtained using a T2*-weighted gradient echo
sequence, and a high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scan was obtained to check whether the
patients had large brain distortion or focal brain damage. For the training dataset, ‘Beijing 750’, the
resting state fMRI acquisition parameters included TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, flip angle = 90˚, axial 39 sli-
ces, thickness = 4 mm, no gap, FOV = 240 � 240 mm, matrix = 64 � 64, and 210 volumes (i.e. 7
min). For the testing dataset, ‘Beijing HDxt’, the resting state fMRI acquisition parameters were as
follows: axial 33 slices, TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, flip angle = 90˚, thickness = 4 mm, no gap,
FOV = 220 � 220 mm, matrix = 64 � 64, and 240 volumes (i.e. 8 min). For the testing dataset,
‘Guangzhou HDxt’, the resting state fMRI acquisition parameters included axial 35 slices, TR/
TE = 2000/30 ms, flip angle = 90˚, thickness = 4 mm, no gap, FOV = 240 � 240 mm,
matrix = 64 � 64, and 240 volumes (i.e. 8 min).

 Data analysis
The data analysis pipeline is illustrated in Figure 2.
Imaging preprocessing
Preprocessing and connectivity calculation were performed in the same way for the training dataset
and the two testing datasets. All resting-state fMRI scans were preprocessed using SPM8 (SPM,
RRID:SCR_007037) and in-house Matlab codes. Specifically, the first five volumes of each subject
were discarded. The remaining resting-state fMRI volumes were corrected for slice timing differen-
ces and realigned to the first volume to correct for inter-scan movements. The functional images
were then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 � 6 � 6 mm full-width at half maximum.
Linear regression was used to remove the influence of head motion, whole brain signals and linear
trends. The variables regressed out included 12 motion parameters (roll, pitch, yaw, translation in
three dimensions and their first derivatives), the average series of the signals within the brain, and
the regressors for linear trends.
Figure 2. Data analysis pipeline. All datasets involved in this study included resting state fMRI and clinical data. For the fMRI data in the training
dataset, data analysis first encompassed preprocessing and imaging feature selection and extraction. Partial least square regression was then used to
generate the regression model using the selected imaging features and clinical features in the training dataset. In this way, a prediction score that
depicts the possibility of consciousness recovery was computed for each patient. The optimal cut-off value for classifying an individual patient as
responsive or non-responsive was then calculated, and the prognostic classification model was obtained. The two testing datasets were only used to
validate externally the regression and classification model.

 Motion artifact is increasingly recognized as an important potential confound in resting state fMRI
studies. Any particular motion may produce a wide variety of signal changes in the fMRI data, and
may thus introduce complicated shifts in functional connectivity analysis. This problem was particu-
larly serious for the DOC patients, as they were unlikely to follow the experimental instructions and
control their head motion. To balance the demands of noise reduction and data preservation, we
censored volumes that preceded or followed any movement (framewise displacement, FD) greater
than 1.5 mm. The FD is a summarization of the absolute values of the derivatives of the translational
and rotational realignment estimates (after converting the rotational estimates to displacement at 50
mm radius) (Power et al., 2015). The head motion measures were achieved in the preprocessing
step of realignment using SPM. To obtain reliable Pearson’s correlations for functional connectivity,
the patients with less than 50 volumes worth of remaining data were excluded. More information
about the analysis and validation of controls for motion-related artifacts are provided in Appendix 4.
Finally, to reduce low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise, band-pass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz)
was only performed on volumes that survived motion censoring.
Definition of networks and regions of interest
As noted in the introduction, multiple functional brain networks are disrupted in DOC patients.
Among these impaired networks, six (the default mode, executive control, salience, sensorimotor,
auditory, and visual networks) show system-level damages and significant correlations with behav-
ioral assessments (Demertzi et al., 2014, 2015). We therefore defined a total of 22 regions of inter-
est (ROIs) to probe these six brain networks. The definitions of the 22 ROIs were based on the
results of a series of previous brain functional studies (Seeley et al., 2007; Raichle, 2011;
Demertzi et al., 2015), and their names and Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates are
listed in Appendix 2.
The connection templates of the six brain networks were first investigated within the normal con-
trol group. In addition to the above-mentioned preprocessing stages, the resting state fMRI scans of
the normal controls in the training dataset were transformed into MNI standard space. For each of
the six networks, time series from the voxels contained in the various ROIs were extracted and aver-
aged together. The averaged time series were then used to estimate whole-brain correlation r maps
that were subsequently converted into normally distributed Fisher’s z-transformed correlation maps.
Group functional connectivity maps for each of the six networks were then created with a one-sam-
ple t test (see Appendix 3 for details). Notably, the T map included both positive and negative val-
ues. We used the six T maps as the brain connection templates of the corresponding brain networks
in the healthy population, which would assist to define one type of imaging features, that is the con-
nection feature of the ROI. More information about the connection features of the ROIs are provided
in the following section.
The conventional fMRI preprocess normalizes individual fMRI images into a standard space
defined by a specific template image. Our goal was to extend this conventional approach to gener-
ate a functional connectivity image for each patient in his/her own imaging space. During the pre-
processing of each patient’s fMRI scans, the 22 ROIs and six brain connection templates were
therefore spatially warped to individual fMRI space and resampled to the voxel size of the individual
fMRI image. We also developed tools to check the registration for each subject visually, some exam-
ples of which are provided in Appendix 5 and Supplementary file 1.
Calculation of imaging features
We designed two types of imaging features from the resting state fMRI, one being the functional
connectivity between each pair of 22 ROIs, and the other being the spatial resemblance between
the functional connection patterns of each ROI and the brain connection templates across the whole
brain. The functional connectivity was based on the Pearson’s correlation coefficients, while the spa-
tial resemblance was conceptually similar to the template-matching procedure (Greicius et al.,
2004; Seeley et al., 2007; Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2010). The basis of template matching is that
the greater the spatial consistency that exists between the template of a brain network and a spe-
cific connectivity map (for example, a component in an independent component analysis), the stron-
ger the possibility that the connectivity map belongs to that brain network. Here, for each ROI of an
individual DOC patient, we first computed the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the time-

 course of the ROI and that of each voxel within the brain so as to obtain a functional connectivity
map, and subsequently converted the functional connectivity map to a normally distributed Fisher’s
z transformed correlation map. Next, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between
the Fisher’s z transformed correlation map and the corresponding brain connection template
wrapped to individual fMRI space across each voxel within the brain. A greater correlation coefficient
between the two maps suggests that there is more spatial resemblance between the functional con-
nectivity map of the ROI and the normal brain connection template. Our assumption was that the
more spatial consistency that existed between the connectivity map of the ROI in a DOC patient and
the brain connection template, the more intact the corresponding brain function of the ROI in this
individual. In this way, we defined the connection feature of the ROI with the spatial resemblance.
Overall, for each participant in this study, there were 231 (22 � 21/2) functional connectivity fea-
tures and 22 brain area connection features.
Imaging feature selection
Feature selection techniques have been widely adopted in brain analysis studies, in order to produce
a small number of features for efficient classification or regression, and to reduce overfitting and
increase the generalization performance of the model (Fan et al., 2007; Dosenbach et al., 2010;
Drysdale et al., 2017). Feature ranking and feature subset selection are two typical feature selection
methods (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003). Feature subset selection methods are generally time consum-
ing, and even inapplicable when the number of features is extremely large, whereas ranking-based
feature selection methods are subject to local optima. Therefore, these two feature selection meth-
ods are usually used jointly. Here, we first used a correlation-based feature selection technique to
select an initial set of features, and then adopted a feature subset selection method for further
selection.
As a univariate method, correlation-based feature selection is simple to run and understand, and
measures the linear correlation between each feature and the response variable. Here, the image
features (i.e. functional connectivity features and brain area connection features) that significantly
correlated to the CRS-R scores at the T1 time point across the DOC patients in the training dataset
were retained for further analysis.
Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling coupled with partial least squares regression (CARS-
PLSR, http://libpls.net/) was then used for further feature subset selection (Li et al., 2009, 2014).
Briefly, CARS-PLSR is a sampling-based feature selection method that selects the key informative
variables by optimizing the model’s performance. As it provides the influence of each variable with-
out considering the influence of the remainder of the variables, CARS-PLSR is efficient and fast
in carrying out feature selection (Mehmood et al., 2012), and has therefore been used to explore
possible biomarkers in medicine (Tan et al., 2010) and for wavelength selection in chemistry
(Fan et al., 2011). Using CARS-PLSR, we selected a subset of key informative imaging features.
Notably, both the correlation-based and CARS-PLSR feature selection methods filtered the fea-
tures from the original feature set without any transformations. This made the prognostic regression
model easier to interpret, as the imaging predictors were associated with either brain regions or
functional connectivity.

(Wold
et
al.,
2001;
Krishnan et al., 2011). It was therefore used to generate the prognostic regression model in the
training dataset ‘Beijing 750’. Given that clinical characteristics—including the etiology, incidence
age and duration of DOC—have been verified as useful prognostic indicators, we designated the
selected imaging features and the three clinical characteristics at the T0 time point as independent
co-variates and the CRS-R score at the T1 time point as the dependent variable. Among the three
clinical characteristics, the incidence age and duration of DOC were quantitative variables, whereas
the etiology was a qualitative variable. In accordance with a previous study (Estraneo et al., 2010),
we categorized the etiology into three types: traumatic brain injury, stroke and anoxic brain injury.
Thus, two dummy variables for etiology were designed and included in the model. Prior to model
training, all involved predictors were centered and normalized (i.e. transformed into Z-scores). The
prognostic regression model therefore took the imaging and clinical features as input and returned

 a predicted score as output. In the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’, we used cross-validation to decide
that the number of latent variables for PLSR was three. To evaluate the regression model, the coeffi-
cient of determination R2 between the predicted scores and the CRS-R scores at the T1 time point
was calculated, and the Bland-Altman plot was used to measure the agreement between them.
Next, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the predicted scores. The
optimal cut-off value for classifying an individual patient as having recovered consciousness or not
was appointed to the point with the maximal sum of true positive and false negative rates on the
ROC curve. Individual patients were classified as exhibiting recovery of consciousness if their pre-
dicted scores were higher than or equal to the cut-off value, otherwise as consciousness non-recov-
ery. The classification accuracy was calculated by comparing the predicted label and the actual GOS
score,that is ’consciousness recovery’ (GOS � 3) versus ‘consciousness non-recovery’ (GOS � 2).
As model interpretation is an important task in most applications of PLSR, there has been consid-
erable progress in the search for optimal interpretation methods (Kvalheim and Karstang, 1989;
Kvalheim et al., 2014). In this study, using the Significant Multivariate Correlation (sMC) method
(Tran et al., 2014), we assessed predictor importance in the prognostic regression model. The key
points in sMC are to estimate the correct sources of variability resulting from PLSR (i.e. regression
variance and residual variance) for each predictor, and use them to determine statistically a variable’s
importance with respect to the regression model. The F-test values (termed the sMC F-values) were
used to evaluate the predictors’ importance in the prognostic regression model.
Internal validation of model
The
prognostic
regression
model
was
internally
validated
using
bootstrap
sampling (Steyerberg, 2008). Specifically, bootstrap samples were drawn with replacement from
the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’ such that each bootstrap sampling set had a number of observa-
tions equal to that of the training dataset. Using a bootstrap sampling set, correlation-based feature
selection and CARS-PLSR were first used to select the feature subset, after which the PLSR was used
to generate a prognostic model. We then applied the model to the bootstrap sampling set and the
original training dataset, and calculated the coefficient of determination R2 of each of the two data-
sets. The difference between the two coefficients of determination was defined as the optimism.
This process was repeated 1000 times to obtain a stable estimate of the optimism. Finally, we sub-
tracted the optimism estimate from the coefficient of determination R2 of the ‘Beijing 750’ training
dataset to obtain the optimism-corrected performance estimate.
In addition, out-of-bag (OOB) estimation was used as an estimate of model classification perfor-
mance in the training dataset (James et al., 2013). Specifically, for the original training dataset x, we
left out one sample at a time and denoted the resulting sets by x(–1),..., x(n). From each leave-one-out
set x(–i), 1000 bootstrap learning sets of size n–1 were drawn. On every bootstrap learning set gener-
ated from x(–i), we carried out feature selection, built a PLSR regression and classification model, and
applied the model to the test observation xi. A majority vote was then made to give a class predic-
tion for observation xi. Finally, we calculated the accuracy for the whole training dataset x.
External model validation
External validation is essential to support the general applicability of a prediction model. We
ensured external validity by testing the model in two testing datasets, neither of which included sam-
ples that were considered during the development of the model. First, using the prognostic regres-
sion model, we calculated one predicted score for each patient in the two testing datasets. As the
‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset assessed the patients’ CRS-R scores at the T1 time point, we calculated the
coefficient of determination R2 between the predicted scores and the patients’ CRS-R scores at this
time point. The Bland-Altman plot was also determined. Finally, the patients in the two testing data-
sets were assessed as achieving consciousness recovery or not on the basis of the cut-off threshold
obtained using the training dataset. The performance of the classification, including the accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity, was determined.

 Comparison between single-domain model and combination model
Using the modeling and validation method described above, we examined the predictability and
generalizability in the two testing datasets on the basis of the clinical features alone or the imaging
features alone.
In addition, to compare the two types of single-domain models and the combination model, we
used bootstrap resampling to obtain the distribution of the prediction accuracies in the two testing
datasets based on each of the three types of models. We first resampled with replacement from the
training dataset, and built a regression and classification model based on the clinical features alone,
the neuroimaging features alone, or the combination of the two-domain features. We then tested
the classification accuracy in the two testing datasets using the three types of models. In this way,
we obtained the distribution of the prediction accuracies using each of the three types of models.
Next, we used repeated measures ANOVA to determine whether or not the performances of the
three types of models were the same; we also used �, the root-mean-square standardized effect, to
report the effect sizes of the mean differences between them.
Comparison between the proposed modeling method and linear SVM
We compared the prediction performances between the proposed modeling method and linear
SVM. The code for SVM was downloaded from LIBSVM (LIBSVM, RRID:SCR_010243). The 253 imag-
ing features and the four clinical features were integrated into one feature vector. No feature selec-
tion was adopted in the linear SVM-based classification. The patients with GOS �3 were labeled as
1, with the others being designated as �1 (i.e. GOS �2).
Similarly, the OOB estimation process was used to estimate the performance of linear SVM in the
training dataset ‘Beijing 750’. Next, using all the samples in the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’, we
trained a linear SVM-based classifier and then tested the predictive accuracy in the two testing
datasets.
Results
Imaging feature selection
Correlation-based feature selection
Using the training dataset, we found that some imaging features significantly correlated to the
CRS-R scores at the T1 time point. For example, the connection features of some brain areas, includ-
ing the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC), posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC) and
right lateral parietal cortex in the default mode network, and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
(DMPFC) and left lateral superior parietal cortex in the executive control network, displayed signifi-
cant correlations to the CRS-R T1 scores across the DOC patients. We also found numerous exam-
ples of significant correlation between functional connectivity and the CRS-R score at the T1 time
point, with these functional connectivities being distributed both within and between brain networks.
More information about the correlations between the imaging features and the CRS-R scores at the
T1 time point are provided in Appendix 6.
CARS-PLSR feature selection
Figure 3 shows the final imaging features selected with CARS-PLSR. Specifically, the brain area con-
nection features included the aMPFC and PCC in the default mode network, and the DMPFC in the
executive control network. The functional connectivity features included the connectivity between
the aMPFC in the default mode network and the DMPFC in the executive control network, as well as
between the middle cingulate cortex in the auditory network and the right lateral primary visual cor-
tex in the visual network. More information about the feature selection by bootstrapping is provided
in Appendix 7.
Prognostic regression model and predictor importance
The prognostic regression model is presented in Figure 4. On the basis of the regression formula,
we noted some interesting findings. First, there were both positive and negative weights. In particu-
lar, the weights were all positive for the three brain area connection features, whereas the weight for

 the functional connectivity feature between the aMPFC in the default mode network and the DMPFC
in the executive control network was negative. Interestingly, this connection had the maximum sMC
F-value as shown in Figure 4B. In addition, the age and the anoxic etiology had negative weights,
and the age predictor had the largest sMC F-value among the four clinical features.
Prognostic classification model and internal validation
Figure 5A presents the predicted score for each patient in the training dataset. As shown in
Figure 5B, there was good agreement between the CRS-R scores at the T1 time point and the pre-
dicted scores. The apparent coefficient of determination R2 was equal to 0.65 (permutation test,
p=0.001), and the Bland-Altman plot verified the consistency between the predicted and achieved
scores (one sample T test, p = 1.0). The prognostic regression model was internally validated using
bootstrapping. The optimism-corrected coefficient of determination R2 was equal to 0.28.
Figure 5C illustrates the number and proportion of DOC patients in different bands of predicted
scores. We found that the proportion of the patients with a ‘consciousness recovery’ outcome in the
patient cohorts rose in conjunction with an increase in the predicted score. The higher the predicted

 score, the higher the proportion of patients who exhibited a favorable outcome. Figure 5D shows
the area under the ROC curve (AUC = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.89–0.99). On the basis of the ROC curve for
the training dataset, a threshold 13.9 was selected as the cut-off point to classify the recovery of
individual patients. In other words, if the predicted score for a patient was equal to or larger than
13.9, the classification model designated the label ‘consciousness recovery’ for this patient, other-
wise ‘consciousness non-recovery’. The classification accuracy was assessed by comparing the pre-
dicted and actual outcomes, that is ’consciousness recovery’ (GOS � 3) versus ’ consciousness non-
recovery’ (GOS � 2). Using this method, the classification accuracy in the training dataset was up to
92%. Specifically, the sensitivity was 85%, the specificity was 94%, the positive predictive value (PPV)
was 79%, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 96%, and the F1 score was 0.81.
The OOB was able to provide the mean prediction error on each training sample and to estimate
the generalizability of our method in the training dataset. Using the OOB estimation, we found that
the prediction accuracy in the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’ was 89%, and the sensitivity, specificity,
PPV and NPV were 69%, 94%, 100%, and 87%, respectively.
External validation of the model
The performance of the prediction model on the two testing datasets is illustrated in Figure 6. As
we assessed the CRS-R scores at the T1 time point for the patients in the ‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset, we
calculated the coefficient of determination R2 between these scores and the predicted scores. The
R2 was equal to 0.35 (permutation test, p=0.005), with the Bland-Altman plot verifying the consis-
tency between the predicted and actual scores (one sample T test, p=0.89). Using the predicted
score 13.9 as the threshold, we then tested the classification accuracy on the two testing datasets.
We found that, for the ‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset, the prediction accuracy was up to 88% (sensitivity:
83%, specificity: 92%, PPV: 92%, NPV:86%, F1 score: 0.87; permutation test, p<0.001), while for the
‘Guangzhou HDxt’ dataset it was also up to 88% (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 83%, PPV: 67%,
NPV: 100%, F1 score: 0.80; permutation test, p<0.001). Notably, our model demonstrated good sen-
sitivity and specificity for both the ‘subacute’ patients (i.e. duration of unconsciousness �3 months)
and those in the chronic phase (i.e. duration of unconsciousness >3 months), as shown in Figure 7.
More interestingly, for the testing dataset ‘Beijing HDxt’, eight DOC patients who were initially diag-
nosed as VS/UWS subsequently recovered consciousness. Using the proposed model, we could suc-
cessfully identify seven of these and there was only one false-positive case. That is, for the VS/UWS
patients, the model achieved 90.0% accuracy (sensitivity: 87.5%, specificity: 91.7%, PPV: 87.5%,
NPV: 91.7%, F1 score: 0.875).
To test robustness, we evaluated whether the present prognostic regression model generalized
to the healthy subjects scanned in the ‘Beijing 750’ training dataset (n = 30) and to the ‘Beijing
HDxt’ testing dataset (n = 10). We found that both the healthy subjects and the ‘consciousness
recovery’ patients had significantly higher predicted imaging subscores than the ‘consciousness non-
recovery’ patients (two-sample T test, p<0.05). Additional information is provided in Appendix 8.
Comparison of the single-domain and combination models
When only the clinical features were used to build the predictive model, the prediction accuracy for
the ‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset was 68% (sensitivity: 58%, specificity: 77%, PPV: 70%, NPV: 67%, F1
score: 0.64), whereas for the ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ dataset, it was 83% (sensitivity: 100%, specific-
ity: 78%, PPV: 60%, NPV: 100%, F1 score: 0.75). When only the imaging features were involved in
the model, the prediction accuracy for the ‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset was 80% (sensitivity: 67%,

 means�standard deviations of the distribution of the prediction accuracies were 0.815�0.050,
0.811�0.044, and 0.666�0.037 for the combination model, the model using imaging features alone,
and the model using clinical features alone, respectively. We found that there were significant differ-
ences between the means of the classification accuracies using the three types of models (repeated
measures ANOVA, p<0.001). Subsequently, we conducted pairwise comparisons. We found that
there was significant difference between the combination model and the model s using the imaging
feature alone (paired sample t-test, p=0.001) or using the clinical feature alone (paired sample t-test,
p<0.001). We also found that there was significant difference between the model using the imaging
feature alone and the model using the clinical feature alone (paired sample t-test, p<0.001). Using
effect-size analysis, we found that there was a mean difference of �=0.004 (95% CI = [0.002, 0.007])
between the combination method and the method using only imaging features, and �=0.149 (95%
CI = [0.147, 0.152]) between the combination method and the method using only clinical features.
We also observed a mean difference of � = 0.145 (95% CI = [0.142, 0.147]) between the methods
using only imaging features and only clinical features.
In the ’Guangzhou HDxt’ testing dataset, the mean�standard deviation of the distribution of the
prediction accuracies was 0.863�0.051, 0.783�0.044, and 0.829�0.086 for the combination model,
the model using imaging features alone, and the model using clinical features alone, respectively.
Similarly, we found that there were significant differences between the mean of the classification
accuracies using the three types of models (repeated measures ANOVA, p<0.001), and there was
significant difference between the combination model and the models using imaging features alone
(paired sample t-test, p<0.001) or using clinical features alone (paired sample t-test, p<0.001). Using
effect-size analysis, we found a mean difference of � = 0.080 (95% CI = [0.076, 0.084]) between the
combination model and the model using the imaging features alone, and � = 0.034 (95%
CI = [0.028, 0.040]) between the combination model and the model using only clinical features. We
also observed a mean difference of � = –0.046 (95% CI = [–0.053, –0.040]) between the model using
imaging features alone and that using only clinical features.
Therefore, in both testing datasets, the combination of imaging and clinical features demon-
strated higher accuracy than the use of the single domain features alone. In addition, use of the
imaging features alone had higher predictive power in comparison to use of the clinical features
alone in the ‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset, whereas the opposite condition was observed in the ‘Guangzhou
HDxt’ dataset, suggesting that the two testing datasets might be heterogeneous. More information
about the single-domain models are provided in Supplementary file 2.
Comparison between the proposed modeling method and linear SVM
Using the OOB estimation, we found that the accuracy of the linear SVM-based classification method
in the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’ was 83% (sensitivity: 31%, specificity: 96%, PPV: 100%, NPV:
81%), which was lower than the accuracy of our proposed modeling method (i.e. accuracy: 89%, sen-
sitivity: 69%, specificity: 94%, PPV: 100%, NPV: 87%). On the other hand, the linear SVM-based clas-
sification method achieved an accuracy of 76% (sensitivity: 58%, specificity: 92%, PPV: 88%, NPV:
71%) and 88% (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 83%, PPV: 67%, NPV: 100%) in the ‘Beijing HDxt’ testing
dataset and the ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ testing dataset, respectively. That is, the accuracy in the ‘Beijing
HDxt’ testing dataset was lower than that in our method, whereas the accuracy in the ‘Guangzhou
HDxt’ testing dataset was similar to that of our approach. Therefore, taking together the perfor-
mance comparisons in both the training dataset and the two testing datasets, we believe that our
method based on feature selection and PLSR should have higher prediction accuracy and better
generalizability in comparison to linear SVM.
Discussion
In this paper, we describe the development of a prognostic model that combines resting state fMRI
with three clinical characteristics to predict one-year outcomes at the single-subject level. The model
discriminated between patients who would later recover consciousness and those who would not
with an accuracy of around 88% in three datasets from two medical centers. It was also able to iden-
tify the prognostic importance of different predictors, including brain functions and clinical charac-
teristics. To our knowledge, this is the first reported implementation of a multidomain prognostic
model that is based on resting state fMRI and clinical characteristics in chronic DOC. We therefore

 suggest that this novel prognostic model is accurate, robust, and interpretable. For research only,
we share the prognostic model and its Matlab code at a public download resource (https://github.
com/realmsong504/pDOC; copy archived at https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/pDOC).
Brain functions are mediated by the interactions between neurons within different neural circuits
and brain regions. Functional imaging can detect the local activity of different brain regions and
explore the interactions between them, and has demonstrated potential for informing diagnosis and
prognosis in DOC. On the one hand, many studies have focused on one modality of brain functional
imaging, such as PET (Phillips et al., 2011), SPECT (Nayak and Mahapatra, 2011), task fMRI
(Owen et al., 2006; Coyle et al., 2015), or resting state fMRI (Demertzi et al., 2015; Qin et al.,
2015; Wu et al., 2015; Roquet et al., 2016). On the other hand, some cross-modality studies have
compared the diagnostic precision between imaging modalities, for example, comparing PET imag-
ing with task fMRI (Stender et al., 2014) or comparing PET, EEG and resting state fMRI
(Golkowski et al., 2017). In our study, by combining brain functional networks detected from resting
state fMRI with three clinical characteristics, we built a computational model that allowed us to make
predictions regarding the prognosis of DOC patients at an individual level. We compared the mod-
els separately using only the imaging features or only the clinical characteristics and found that the
combination of these predictors achieved greater accuracy. This validated the need for the use of
accumulative evidence stemming from multiple assessments, each of which has different sensitivity
and specificity in detecting the capacity for recovery of consciousness (Demertzi et al., 2017). Vali-
dations in additional and unseen datasets were also undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of the pre-
dictive model. Our results showed about 88% average accuracy across the two testing datasets, and
good sensitivity and specificity in both the ‘subacute’ patients (i.e. 1 months � duration of
unconsciousness � 3 months) and those in the prolonged phase (i.e. duration of unconsciousness >3
months), which suggested good robustness and the generalizability of our model.
Further, the sensitivity of 83% and 100% obtained across the two testing datasets demonstrated
a low false-negative rate, which would avoid predicting non-recovery in a patient who can actually
recover. Our method successfully identified 16 out of the total 18 patients who later recovered con-
sciousness in the two testing datasets. In parallel, the specificity across the two testing datasets was
up to 92% and 83%, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that our method can pre-
cisely identify those patients with a high-potential for recovery consciousness and concurrently
reduce false positives in predicting low-potential patients. In addition, although it has been widely
considered that the prospect of a clinically meaningful recovery is unrealistic for prolonged DOC
patients (Wijdicks and Cranford, 2005), our model correctly predicted 9 out of 10 DOC patients
with longer than or equal to three months duration of DOC who subsequently recovered conscious-
ness, including three patients with DOC longer or equal to 6 months duration, suggesting that it can
also be applied to prolonged DOC patients.
According to the surviving consciousness level, DOC patients can be classified into distinct diag-
nostic entities, including VS/UWS and MCS. As MCS is often viewed as a state with a potentially
more favorable outcome (Luaute
´ et al., 2010), a misdiagnosis of VS/UWS could heavily bias the
judgment of the prognosis, the medical treatment options and even the associated ethical decisions.
Some influential studies have found that a few VS/UWS patients exhibit near-normal high-level corti-
cal activation in response to certain stimuli or commands (Owen et al., 2006; Monti et al., 2010),
and that late recovery of responsiveness and consciousness is not exceptional in patients with VS/
UWS (Estraneo et al., 2010). Instead of predicting diagnosis, this study used one-year outcome as a
target for regression and classification. Our method, which is based on the combined use of clinical
and neuroimaging data, successfully identified seven out of the eight VS/UWS patients in the testing
dataset who were initially diagnosed as VS/UWS but subsequently achieved a promising outcome.
By analyzing the sMC F-value for each predictor in the regression model, we investigated the
prognostic effects of these predictors. In particular, the sMC F-value of the incidence age was
greater than that of the other clinical characteristics, suggesting that incidence age might be the
most important predictor among the clinical characteristics. Notably, the sMC F-value for the imag-
ing features as a whole seemed to be greater than that for the clinical features, as shown in
Figure 4B. We therefore speculate that the patient’s residual consciousness capacity, indicated by
brain networks and functional connectivity detected from resting state fMRI, might have a stronger
prognostic effect than their clinical characteristics.

 Some previous studies have shown that the resting state functional connectivity within the default
mode network is decreased in severely brain-damaged patients, in proportion to their degree of
consciousness impairment, from locked-in syndrome to minimally conscious, vegetative and coma
patients (Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2010). Moreover, the reduced functional connectivity within the
default mode network, specifically between the MPFC and the PCC, may predict the outcome for
DOC patients (Silva et al., 2015). Our model also validates that the aMPFC and PCC in the default
mode network play important roles in predicting prognosis.
Above all, we found that the functional connectivity between the aMPFC and the DMPFC had the
maximum sMC F-value in the prognostic regression model. The aMPFC is one of the core brain areas
in the default mode network, whereas the DMPFC is located in the executive control network. Previ-
ous studies have demonstrated that this functional connectivity is negative connectivity in normal
healthy populations, with the anti-correlation being proposed as one reflection of the intrinsic func-
tional organization of the human brain (Fox et al., 2005). The default mode network directly contrib-
utes
to
internally
generated
stimulus-independent
thoughts,
self-monitoring,
and
baseline
monitoring of the external world, while the executive control network supports active exploration of
the external world. Correct communication and coordination between these two intrinsic anti-corre-
lated networks is thought to be very important for optimal information integration and cognitive
functioning (Buckner et al., 2008). A recent study reported that negative functional connectivities
between the default mode network and the task-positive network were only observed in patients
who recovered consciousness and in healthy controls, whereas positive values were obtained in
patients with impaired consciousness (Di Perri et al., 2016). Further, our regression model suggests
that the anti-correlations between these two diametrically opposed networks (i.e. the default mode
network and the executive control network) should be the most crucial imaging feature for predict-
ing the outcomes of the DOC patients. We therefore conclude that our prognostic model has good
interpretability, and that it not only verifies the findings of previous studies but also provides a win-
dow to assess the relative significance of various predictors for the prognosis of DOC patients.
This study involved two testing datasets, which were found to be quite different, as shown in
Table 1. First, the distributions of the etiology of the patients were remarkably different in the two
datasets. The numbers of patients suffering from trauma/stroke/anoxia were 12/6/7 and 8/0/16 in
the ‘Beijing HDxt’ and ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ datasets, respectively. The outcomes were also different.
In the ‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset, 12 out of the total 25 patients recovered consciousness, compared
with six out of the total 24 patients in the ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ dataset. Given that the characteristics
of the two medical centers and their roles in the local health care system are different, we speculate
that this could be one of the main reasons why the enrolled patient populations were heteroge-
neous. As described in the Introduction, DOC can have many causes and can be associated with sev-
eral neuropathological processes and different severities, leading to the suggestion that information
from different domains should be integrated to improve diagnosis and prognostication (Ber-
nat, 2016). Our study demonstrates that the combination of imaging and clinical features can
achieve a better performance than the use of single domain features.
However, some caution is warranted. First, although this study involved 112 DOC patients,
the number of patients who would later recover consciousness was relatively low (i.e. 31/112). So, a
much larger cohort will be needed for further validation. Second, the PPVs for the two testing data-
sets were remarkably different, with that for the ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ dataset being relatively low (67%
versus 91%). Although our method predicted that nine patients in this dataset would recover con-
sciousness, only six of them did (i.e. GOS �3), with the other three remaining unconscious at the
end of the follow-up (i.e. GOS �2). Given that many additional factors are associated with the out-
come of DOC patients, including medical complications, nutrition and so on, future work will need
to integrate more information in order to provide more precise predictions. Third, the signal-to-
noise ratio of resting state fMRI can influence functional connectivity analysis, so calibrations will be
necessary when applying the predictive model across different sites, including standardizing the MRI
acquisition protocols (e.g. scanner hardware, imaging protocols and acquisition sequences) and the
patients’ management strategies (see Appendix 10 for more information). Finally, a DOC patient’s
prognosis can be considered according to at least three dimensions: survival/mortality, recovery of
consciousness, and functional recovery. This study focused on predicting recovery of consciousness,
and the patients who died during the follow-up were excluded. In the future, we will consider more
outcome assessments, including survival/mortality and functional recovery.

 In summary, our prognostic model, which combines resting state fMRI with clinical characteristics,
is proposed to predict the one-year outcome of DOC patients at an individual level. The average
accuracy of classifying a patient as ‘consciousness recovery’ or not was around 88% in the training
dataset and two unseen testing datasets. Our model also has good interpretability, thereby provid-
ing a window to reassure physicians and scientists about the significance of different predictors,
including brain networks, functional connectivities and clinical characteristics. Together, these advan-
tages could offer an objective prognosis for DOC patients that will optimize their management and
deepen our understanding of brain function during unconsciousness.

Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients and
normal controls in this study
The diagnosis in this study was made by experienced physicians according to the CRS-R scale.
Patients were diagnosed as MCS when they demonstrated at least one of the following
behaviors: (1) following simple commands; (2) yes/no responses (gestural or verbal); (3)
intelligible verbalization; (4) purposeful behavior in response to an environmental stimulus; (5)
vocalization or gestures in direct response to questions; (6) reaching for objects that
demonstrates a clear relationship between the position of the object and the direction of the
movement; (7) touching or holding objects; (8) following or staring at an object in direct
response to its movement. Emergence from the MCS was signaled by the return of functional
communication and/or object use.
In this study, the patients underwent the CRS-R assessments twice weekly (or more) within
the two weeks before MRI scanning. So, the CRS-R was generally administered about 4–5
times for each patient. The highest CRS-R score was considered as the diagnosis and listed in
the following tables. T0: the time point of the MRI scanning; T1: the time point of follow-up.

Brain functional network templates
Although the neurobiological implications of the spontaneous neuronal activity are not very
clear, spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal have been
found to be coherent within a variety of functionally relevant brain regions, which are denoted
as representing a ‘network’. Moreover, several networks have been found to be spatially
consistent across different healthy subjects (Damoiseaux et al., 2006). Researchers suggested
that the brain networks assessed by resting state fMRI may reflect an intrinsic functional
architecture of the brain (Raichle, 2011). As mentioned in the manuscript, multiple networks
were reported to be disrupted in the DOC patients. Here, the connection templates of the six
brain networks were investigated within the healthy control group of the ‘Beijing 750’ dataset.
This study focused on the cortex, so six functional networks were investigated, including
the default mode network, the executive control network, salience, and the sensorimotor,
auditory, and visual networks. Group functional connectivity maps for each of the six networks
were created with a one-sample t test as shown in the following Appendix 3—figure 1. These
templates were separately shown on the brain surface using the SurfStat toolbox (SurfStat,
RRID:SCR_007081). The color bar representes the T value.

Quality control for resting state functional connectivity
During the MRI scanning, the foam pad and headphones were used to reduce head motion
and scanner noise. The normal controls were instructed to keep still with their eyes closed, as
motionless as possible and not to think about anything in particular. The same instructions
were given to the patients but due to their consciousness and cognitive impairments, we could
not fully control for a prolonged eye-closed yet awake scanning session. The Appendix 4—
figure 1 showed cumulative distribution of head motion per volume (framewise displacement)
for normal controls and the patients. The Appendix 4—figure 2 showed the results of control
quality of resting state fMRI in this study. The Appendix 4—figure 3 showed the histogram of
the remaining number of fMRI volumes after scrubbing.

ment) for normal controls and DOC patients separately in the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’ (A1),

normal controls were shown in left column, whereas the DOC patients were shown in right
column. No healthy control data were available for the Guangzhou centre. In both patients
and controls, head position was stable to within 1.5 mm for the vast majority (>95%) of brain
volumes.

between the ROIs in this study. Prior studies have shown that motion artifacts tend to vary with
neuroanatomical distance between brain nodes. Here, we conducted quality control analyses
as described in the previous study (Power et al., 2015). Specifically, we computed
correlations between head motion (mean FD) and each resting state functional connectivity
(RSFC) feature and plotted them as a function of neuroanatomical distance (mm) for subjects
in the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’ (B1), the testing dataset ‘Beijing HDxt’ (B2), and the
testing dataset ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ (B3). Smoothing curves (in red) were plotted using a
moving average filter.

Warped regions of interest and brain network templates
The conventional fMRI preprocess normalizes individual fMRI images into a standard space
defined by a specific template image. This study generated a functional connectivity image for
each patient in his/her own fMRI space. During the preprocessing of each patient’s fMRI scans,
the 22 ROIs and the six brain network templates were spatially warped to individual fMRI
space and resampled to the voxel size of the individual fMRI image. To ensure the registration,
we developed some tools to check the transformed ROIs and brain network templates
visually for each subject in this study.
Supplementary file 1 illustrated some examples of the warped ROIs in the default mode
network (DMN) for the three DOC patients with a GOS score of 2,3 or 4, respectively.
In addition, as a reference, we showed these figures for one normal control. The ROIs in the
DMN include the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC), the posterior cingulate cortex/
precuneus (PCC), the left lateral parietal cortex (L.LatP), the right lateral parietal cortex (R.
LatP). The details about these four ROIs are listed in Appendix 2, and the brain network
template of the DMN is provided in Appendix 3.

Validations in healthy controls
To test robustness, we evaluated whether the prognostic regression model generalized to the
normal controls (NC) in the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’ (n = 30) and the testing dataset
‘Beijing HDxt’ (n = 10). No normal control data were available in the Guangzhou centre. As the
NC subjects did not have the clinical characteristics, we calculated the subscores using the
imaging features alone and then compared these subscores to those of the DOC patients.
Appendix 8—figure 1 showed the imaging subscores for all of the subjects in the three
datasets. We would like to emphasize that the normal controls in the training dataset were
only used to establish the brain network templates, and not for any training.
Appendix 8—figure 1. The imaging subscores for all of the subjects in the three datasets.
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36173.038
We found that (1) in the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’, the NC subjects had significantly
larger imaging subscores in comparison to both the DOC patients with consciousness recovery
and the DOC patients with consciousness non-recovery (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05, multiple
comparison corrected), and that the DOC patients with consciousness recovery had
significantly larger imaging subscores in comparison to the DOC patients with consciousness
non-recovery (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05, multiple comparison corrected); (2) in the testing
dataset ‘Beijing HDxt’, the NC subjects had significantly larger imaging subscores in
comparison to the DOC patients with consciousness non-recovery (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05,
multiple comparison corrected), and the DOC patients with consciousness recovery had
significantly larger imaging subscores in comparison to the DOC patients with consciousness
non-recovery (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05, multiple comparison corrected); (3) in the testing
dataset ‘Guangzhou HDxt’, the imaging subscores of the DOC patients with consciousness
recovery were significantly larger than that of DOC patients with consciousness non-recovery
(two-sample t-tests, p<0.05).

Variations across different sites
To investigate variations across different sites, we did two experiments using the normal
control (NC) subjects in this study. First, we explored whether the predicted imaging
subscores of the NC subjects were significantly different between the training dataset ‘Beijing
750’ (n = 30) and the testing dataset ‘Beijing HDxt’ (n = 10). We found that there was no
significant difference between the two groups (two-sample T test, p=0.24). The distribution is
shown in Appendix 9—figure 1.
Appendix 9—figure 1. The distribution of the predicted imaging subscores of the healthy con-
trols at different sites.
DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36173.040
Second, we investigated the relationships between the fMRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the predicted imaging subscores. Different MRI acquisition protocols (e.g. scanner hardware,
imaging protocols and acquisition sequences) can influence the imaging SNR. But, it is not
trivial to estimate the SNR in resting-state fMRI because the noise is complex and also differs
spatially. Here, we calculated the temporal SNR (tSNR) as the ratio between the mean fMRI
signal and its temporal standard deviation in each voxel (Welvaert and Rosseel, 2013), and
then averaged across all voxels in each region of interest (ROI) (Gardumi et al., 2016;
Hay et al., 2017). As there were 22 ROIs in this study, the median of these 22 ROI tSNR
values was used as the measure for evaluating the SNR of the fMRI. We then correlated the
median tSNR with the predicted imaging subscores across all of the NC subjects (n = 40), and
found that there were significant correlations between them (Pearson’s correlation r = 0.36,
p=0.024) as shown inAppendix 9—figure 2.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36173.041
From the above two experiments, we found that (1) the fMRI tSNR could be one of
influencing factors in the application of the presented model; (2) the predicted imaging
subscores for the NC subjects could be approximate across different sites when the tSNR was
proximity. Therefore, we suggested that our presented model can be applied to different
centers, although the calibration might be required. Further, the tSNR in fMRI is not only
associated with instrumental noise but also modulated by subject-related noise, such as
physiological fluctuations and motion artifacts (Huettel et al., 2009). Therefore, we suggest
that, on the one hand, the quality of imaging acquisition, including MRI scanner and imaging
sequence/parameters, need to be guaranteed; and on the other hand, scanning protocols is
required to be standardized to reduce the subject-related noise during the scanning.
