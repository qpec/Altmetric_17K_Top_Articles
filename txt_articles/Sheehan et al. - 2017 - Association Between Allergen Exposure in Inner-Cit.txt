IMPORTANCE Home aeroallergen exposure is associated with increased asthma morbidity in
children, yet little is known about the contribution of school aeroallergen exposures to such
morbidity.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of school-specific aeroallergen exposures on asthma
morbidity among students, adjusting for home exposures.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The School Inner-City Asthma Study was a prospective
cohort study evaluating 284 students aged 4 to 13 years with asthma who were enrolled from
37 inner-city elementary schools in the northeastern United States between March 1, 2008,
and August 31, 2013. Enrolled students underwent baseline clinical evaluations before the
school year started and were then observed clinically for 1 year. During that same school year,
classroom and home dust samples linked to the students were collected and analyzed for
common indoor aeroallergens. Associations between school aeroallergen exposure and
asthma outcomes during the school year were assessed, adjusting for home exposures.
EXPOSURES Indoor aeroallergens, including rat, mouse, cockroach, cat, dog, and dust mites,
measured in dust samples collected from inner-city schools.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was maximum days in the past 2
weeks with asthma symptoms. Secondary outcomes included well-established markers of
asthma morbidity, including asthma-associated health care use and lung function, measured
by forced expiratory volume in 1 second.
RESULTS Among 284 students (median age, 8 years [interquartile range, 6-9 years]; 148 boys
and 136 girls), exposure to mouse allergen was detected in 441 (99.5%) of 443 school dust
samples, cat allergen in 420 samples (94.8%), and dog allergen in 366 samples (82.6%).
Levels of mouse allergen in schools were significantly higher than in students’homes (median
settled dust level, 0.90 vs 0.14 μg/g; P < .001). Exposure to higher levels of mouse allergen in
school (comparing 75th with 25th percentile) was associated with increased odds of having
an asthma symptom day (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05-1.54; P = .02) and 4.0 percentage
points lower predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (95% CI, –6.6 to –1.5; P = .002).
This effect was independent of allergic sensitization. None of the other indoor aeroallergens
were associated with worsening asthma outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study of inner-city students with asthma, exposure to
mouse allergen in schools was associated with increased asthma symptoms and decreased
lung function. These findings demonstrate that the school environment is an important
contributor to childhood asthma morbidity. Future school-based environmental interventions
may be beneficial for this important public health problem.

A
sthma affects a large proportion of children in the
United States, accounting for more than 14 million
missed school days per year1 and costing billions of dol-
lars in health care use.2 Furthermore, asthma morbidity dis-
proportionately affects minorities and low-income groups in
inner-city neighborhoods.3 Previous studies have identified
unique allergen exposures in inner-city homes as important
risk factors for asthma morbidity4 and demonstrated that in-
terventions to reduce home exposure to these allergens im-
prove asthma outcomes.5 There are some published data on
the presence of allergens in schools6-12; however, to our knowl-
edge, there are no comprehensive studies evaluating asthma
outcomes resulting from allergen exposures in schools, where
children spend most of their day.13 The primary purpose of the
SchoolInner-CityAsthmaStudywastocomprehensivelyevalu-
ate the role of school-specific indoor allergen exposures on
asthma morbidity, adjusting for home allergen exposures.
Methods
Study Population and Overall Design
The study population consisted of children aged 4 to 13 years
with asthma who were attending inner-city public elemen-
tary schools in the northeastern United States from March 1,
2008, to August 31, 2013. Each year of the study, approxi-
mately 70 students were recruited from approximately 7 el-
ementary schools. Enrolled students were observed clini-
cally for 1 school year; their school and home environments
were evaluated during that same year. With each subsequent
year of the study, a new set of schools was evaluated and a new
set of students was enrolled. In total, 351 students from 38 el-
ementary schools were evaluated for 1 year each during the
5-year study period (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Children with asthma attending these schools were re-
cruitedbasedonestablishedcriteriamodeledfromotherinner-
city asthma studies.14,15 Inclusion criteria included asthma di-
agnosed by a physician for at least 1 year and at least 1 of the
following: current daily preventive asthma medication use,
wheezing in the past year, or an unscheduled health care visit
for asthma in the past year. Exclusion criteria included lung
disease other than asthma and cardiovascular disease. Writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from the participants’le-
gal guardian, and written assent was obtained from partici-
pants older than 7 years. The protocol was approved by the
Boston Children’
s Hospital institutional review board and the
participating school system.
Study Recruitment, Baseline Study Visit,
and Sensitization Testing
Every spring, validated screening questionnaires were distrib-
uted to the parents of all students attending participating el-
ementary schools to determine possible eligibility.16 Enrolled
students with asthma completed a baseline clinical assess-
ment during the summer prior to the academic year, including
spirometry with a Koko spirometer (Ferraris Respiratory) using
guidelines from the American Thoracic Society17 and aeroal-
lergen sensitization testing by allergy skin testing (MultiTest
device; Lincoln Diagnostics) and/or serum-specific IgE testing
(ImmunoCAP;PhadiaAB).Sensitizationwasdefinedbyawheal
3 mm or larger than that induced by the negative saline control
on prick testing or a specific IgE level of 0.35 kU/L or greater.
The tested allergens included tree pollen, grass, ragweed, dust
mites, cat, dog, mouse, rat, cockroach, and molds (Greer).
Follow-up Questionnaires and Follow-up Spirometry
Follow-up surveys evaluating asthma symptoms, health care
use, and effect on parent or caregiver were performed during
telephone interviews at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. For example,
the first follow-up questionnaire occurred during the fall sea-
son, 3 months after the summer baseline visit. Follow-up spi-
rometry was performed twice during the academic year, ap-
proximately 6 months apart.
Exposure Assessment
Classroom-settled dust samples were collected twice during
the academic year (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). School dust
samples were obtained by research personnel using an Oreck
XL (model BB870-AD) handheld vacuum with a special dust
collector (DACI laboratory, Johns Hopkins) fitted into the in-
lethoseofthevacuumusingastandardizedprotocol.15Vacuum
sampling was performed for a total of 6 minutes per sample:
3 minutes on the floor and 3 minutes on desk and chair
surfaces.18 One settled dust sample was collected in the par-
ticipant’
s bedroom, established as the most clinically rel-
evanthomeexposurelocation,usingastandardizedprotocol.19
Dust samples were analyzed using a multiplex array for in-
door allergens (MARIA; Indoor Biotechnologies)20 that mea-
suredthefollowingindooraeroallergenssimultaneously:cock-
roach (Bla g 2), cat (Fel d 1), dog (Can f 1), mouse (Mus m 1),
dust mite (Der p 1 and Der f 1 and group 2), and rat (Rat n 1).
The lower limits of detection were 0.196 μg/g of dust for cock-
roach, 0.004 μg/g for cat and rat, 0.002 μg/g for mouse, and
0.012 μg/g for dust mites and dog. For samples with an unde-
tectable allergen level, the value was set to the lower limit of
detection.
Outcome Measures
A priori, the primary outcome was days with asthma symp-
toms, as used in prior inner-city home-based studies.4,5 To de-
fine this outcome, the following 3 variables of symptoms in
the 2 weeks prior to each survey were evaluated: number of
Key Points
Question What is the effect of school-specific aeroallergen
exposures on students’asthma morbidity?
Findings In this cohort study evaluating students with asthma,
higher mouse allergen exposure at school was significantly
associated with both increased asthma symptoms and lower lung
function, independent of allergic sensitization and allergen
exposure in the home.
Meaning The school environment is an important contributor to
childhood asthma morbidity, and future school-based
environmental interventions may benefit all children with asthma.

days with wheezing, chest tightness, or cough; number of days
on which the child had to slow down or discontinue play ac-
tivities owing to wheezing, chest tightness, or cough; or num-
ber of nights with wheezing, chest tightness, or cough lead-
ing to disturbed sleep. The greatest result of these 3 variables
was used as the outcome of days wth asthma symptoms. As
such, this outcome was a score ranging from 0 to 14 days.
Secondary outcome measures included the following:
number of days the child missed school owing to asthma;
health care use, defined as the number of hospitalizations and
unscheduled health care visits for asthma; number of days the
caregiver changed plans because of the child’
s asthma; num-
ber of nights the caregiver lost sleep because of the child’
s
asthma; poor asthma control as identified by any of following
in the past 4 weeks: shortness of breath more than twice
weekly, nighttime awakenings owing to asthma at least once,
limitation in activity level, or use of rescue asthma medica-
tion 2 or more times weekly; and lung function based on per-
centage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second
(FEV1) before the child used a bronchodilator.
Statistical Analysis
Only allergens that were detected in 50% or more of school
sampleswereanalyzedforassociationswithasthmaoutcomes.
Asthma morbidity outcomes were linked with the temporally
closestallergenexposure.Onlyoutcomemeasuresobtaineddur-
ing the school year were included in the analysis, with children
havingbetween1and4outcomemeasuresacrosstheschoolyear.
We first explored unadjusted patterns of allergen expo-
sure and response across quintiles of exposure to evaluate if
a dose-response association existed between exposure to
school allergens and the primary outcome. We then per-
formed the primary analysis of the study, which evaluated the
association between allergen exposure and outcome using ex-
posure as a continuous variable while adjusting for confound-
ers using generalized estimating equations with an exchange-
able correlation structure, robust variance estimates, and
clustering at the participant level. We considered clustering at
theschoollevelinadditiontotheparticipantlevelwithinamul-
tilevel random effects model containing both child and school
random effects, but it was deemed unnecessary because there
was little to no between-school variability in all outcomes (in-
traclass correlations between 0.00 and 0.04). In this analy-
sis, allergen levels were log transformed to minimize the ef-
fect of highly influential points arising from the skewed
distribution of exposure. Binomial family generalized esti-
mating equations with a logit link and an overdispersion pa-
rameter were used for 2-week outcomes (ie, 2-week out-
comes were modeled as the sum of 14 binomial successes) and
poor asthma control, negative binomial family generalized es-
timating equations and log link were used for health care use
and school absences, and FEV1 was modeled using gaussian
family and identity link.
To investigate the role of allergic sensitization in modify-
ingtheexposure-responseassociationforeachallergen,wefirst
tested the interaction effect of school allergen exposure and
sensitization to that particular allergen. If the interaction ef-
fect was not significant (P ≥ .20), then the interaction effect
was removed and the main effect of allergen exposure was re-
ported. To limit multiple comparisons, secondary outcomes
were analyzed only if a significant association was found be-
tween an allergen and the primary outcome. A priori, we de-
cided to adjust for the following in all models: age, sex, race/
ethnicity, use of medication to control asthma, home allergen
exposure, linked school endotoxin exposure, and season. Sea-
sonwasdefinedasacontinuousmeasureofthenumberofdays
since school started and was modeled with linear and qua-
dratic terms (based on its observed association with maxi-
mum symptom days). The home allergen exposures of the 18
participants missing these data were set to the mean of the
sample, and an indicator variable identifying these partici-
pants was included in all models.
StatisticalcomputationswereperformedusingSTATAsoft-
ware, version 13.1 (StataCorp). All tests were 2-tailed, and
P < .05 was considered significant.
Results
A total of 351 students with asthma from 38 schools partici-
pated in the baseline study visit. Participants were excluded
from this analysis if they were lacking outcome measures dur-
ing the school year, lacking sensitization testing, or lacking col-
lection of classroom dust exposures (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment). As a result, 284 participants (median age, 8 years
[interquartile range, 6-9 years]; 148 boys and 136 girls) from
37 schools were included in this analysis. There were a total
of714follow-upobservations,including40participants(14.1%)
with1follow-up,82(28.9%)with2follow-ups,138(48.6%)with
3 follow-ups, and 24 (8.5%) with 4 follow-ups. The baseline
characteristics of the study population are detailed in Table 1.
Mouse allergen was the most commonly detected aller-
gen, with rates of detection of 99.5% in schools and 96.0% in
homes (Table 2). The school mouse allergen levels were high,
with the median and 90th percentile levels of Mus m 1 at 0.90
and 10.95 μg/g, respectively. Mouse allergen levels in schools
were significantly higher than in homes (median, 0.90 vs
0.14 μg/g; P < .001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Cat and dog al-
lergen were commonly detected in schools (cat, 94.8%; dog,
82.6%) and homes (cat, 79.4%; dog, 49.8%). Dust mites were
detected in 46.5% of school samples, and the absolute levels
of dust mites were low (maximum, 1.64 μg/g). Cockroach and
rat allergen were mostly undetectable in schools (cockroach,
0.7%; rat, 1.4%) and homes (cockroach, 3.1%; rat, 2.2%).
The crude data show an association between allergen ex-
posureandtheprimaryoutcomeonlywithmouseallergen.Par-
ticipants in the highest quintile of mouse allergen exposure at
school had 3.6 days with asthma symptoms per 2-week
period compared with 2.9 days with symptoms for partici-
pants in the lowest quintile of exposure (eTable in the Supple-
ment).Inmultivariablemodels,wefoundnoevidencethatsen-
sitization to a specific allergen modified the association
between allergen exposure level and days with asthma symp-
toms for the commonly detected allergens in schools (mouse,
cat, and dog). The interaction effects were not significant for
any of these allergens, with an odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI, 0.78-

Given the significant association of mouse allergen expo-
sure in school with the primary outcome of asthma symp-
toms, we analyzed this exposure relative to secondary out-
comes. As seen in Figure 2, lung function was significantly
associated with mouse exposure in school dust. Exposure to
the 75th percentile of mouse allergen in school dust was as-
sociated with a 4.0 percentage points–lower predicted FEV1
(95% CI, –6.6 to –1.5; P = .002) relative to children exposed to
the 25th percentile of mouse allergen in school dust, indepen-
dent of sensitization status and other covariates. None of the
other secondary outcomes was significantly associated with
school mouse allergen exposure.
Discussion
In our study of inner-city school-aged children with asthma,
exposure to higher levels of school mouse allergen was asso-
ciated with a higher number of days with asthma symptoms
and decreased lung function, independent of home environ-
mental exposure. This effect was seen in all children with
asthma studied, regardless of whether they were sensitized to
mouse allergen, and further underscores the public health rel-
evance of school-associated allergen exposure as an impor-
tant contributor to asthma morbidity in children. We acknowl-
edge that other allergens in schools were mostly undetectable
or detected at low levels, limiting our ability to assess those
allergens; however, mouse allergen was present at high lev-
els in schools. To our knowledge, this study is the first com-
prehensive inner-city school-based study to examine class-
room allergen exposures and asthma morbidity in students,
adjusting for home exposure.
In the inner-city schools in our study, mouse allergen was
the predominant exposure, whereas levels of cockroach, pet,
and dust mite allergens were undetectable or low. Other in-
vestigatorshavereportedlowlevelsofcockroachanddustmite
allergensinsimilarnortheasternUScities.4,21Incontrast,other
cities with warmer climates and different building conditions
have demonstrated high levels of school cockroach allergen.8,9
The low levels of dust mites and cockroach in our study are
likely owing to the long, dry, and very cold winters in the stud-
ied region, as these pests require humidity and warmth to sur-
vive. Although cat and dog allergens were commonly de-
tectedinourschools,theabsolutelevelsoftheseallergenswere
relatively low compared with those in studies from homes in
the United States22,23 or schools in Europe.11,24 The pet aller-
gen levels in the schools in our study were well below the stan-
dard threshold associated with asthma symptoms.25 This find-
ing is likely owing to the low prevalence of household pets in
our inner-city setting, with only 79 of 350 participants (22.6%)

and 107 of 350 participants (30.6%) reporting having dogs or
cats, respectively. Our findings are consistent with recent work
suggesting that mouse allergen may be the most relevant al-
lergen exposure in inner-city settings.26,27 Matsui et al28 re-
ported increased asthma morbidity for children exposed to
more than 0.5 μg/g of mouse allergen in settled dust in a bed-
room. Our study found 266 of 443 school samples (60.0%)
above this threshold.
The clinical significance of these findings is important. A
child in a classroom with a mouse allergen level at the 25th per-
centile exposure of our study will have an estimated 0.6 fewer
days of asthma symptoms in a 2-week period compared with
a child in a classroom with mouse allergen exposure at the 75th
percentile. This difference would translate into 12 fewer days
of asthma symptoms during the school year (61 vs 73 days).
These estimated differences in days with asthma symptoms

inner-city children.31 The findings of our school study high-
light the potential for robust and clinically important improve-
ments in students’asthma with school-based environmental
interventions.
Students who were both sensitized and exposed to el-
evated levels of mouse allergen did exhibit increased asthma
morbidity; however, we were surprised to find an association
irrespective of sensitization status. We considered endotoxin
as a possible confounder based on prior reports that nonaller-
gic symptomatic effect in mouse research workers occurs ow-
ing to airborne endotoxin exposure32; however, our findings
remained even after adjusting for endotoxin levels. Rabito
et al33 also reported similar findings of increased asthma mor-
bidityindependentofsensitizationstatusforexposuretocock-
roach allergen in homes. A longitudinal study of apprentices
exposed to laboratory animals also found that respiratory
symptoms developed even in those who were not sensitized.34
It is possible that extremely high levels of mouse allergen, as
we detected in our study, could have a direct irritant effect.
Studies also have shown that multiple allergens can directly
activate the innate immune system35,36; it is possible that in-
creased inflammation results in asthma symptoms in nonsen-
sitized individuals.
Further support for the significant association between
mouseallergenexposureinschoolandasthmamorbidityisthe
decline in percent predicted FEV1 associated with increased
levels of mouse allergen in school. Although participants ex-
posed to high concentrations of mouse allergen maintained an
average FEV1 in the normal range, this finding offers objec-
tive physiological evidence to support our primary symptom-
based results.
Limitations
Of the enrolled 351 study participants, 67 (19.1%) were not
included in this analysis as they lacked exposure or out-
come measures. We found no statistically significant differ-
ences in the demographics between the analyzed and
excluded participants except for the rate of ragweed sensiti-
zation (20.5% vs 8.3%; P = .046), which is not expected to
have influenced our findings. We likely had insufficient
power to detect differences in certain secondary outcomes
such as health care use, school absences, lost sleep, and
change of plans that are relatively infrequent occurrences.
Furthermore, we acknowledge that there was not a differen-
tiation of participants by asthma severity, which may have
affected results; however, we did adjust for the use of medi-
cation to control asthma. Finally, our results may not be
generalizable to other cities that may have different aller-
gens predominating in schools owing to differing climate
and sociodemographic conditions. The exact problematic
allergen is not as important as the demonstration that
schools can be a source of allergen exposure associated with
asthma morbidity.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, our findings are the first to provide
substantial evidence that exposure to high levels of an
aeroallergen in school plays an important role in asthma
morbidity in inner-city children. The association of mouse
allergen exposure in school with the primary outcome was
seen in students with asthma regardless of allergic sensiti-
zation status. These findings suggest that exposure reduc-
tion strategies in the school setting may effectively and
efficiently benefit all children with asthma. Future school-
based environmental intervention studies may be
warranted.
