Triggers for Violent Criminality in Patients
With Psychotic Disorders
Amir Sariaslan, PhD; Paul Lichtenstein, PhD; Henrik Larsson, PhD; Seena Fazel, MD
IMPORTANCE Absolute and relative risks of violence are increased in patients with psychotic
disorders, but the contribution of triggers for violent acts to these risks is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether a range of triggers for violent acts are associated with risks of
violence in patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders and in individuals without a
psychiatric diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using a sample of all individuals born in Sweden
between 1958 and 1988 (N = 3 123 724), we identified patients in the National Patient
Register who were diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (n = 34 903) and
bipolar disorder (n = 29 692), as well as unaffected controls (n = 2 763 012). We then
identified, within each subsample, persons who had experienced any of the following triggers
for violent acts between January 1, 2001, and December 15, 2013: exposure to violence,
parental bereavement, self-harm, traumatic brain injury, unintentional injuries, and substance
intoxication. By using within-individual models, we conducted conditional logistic regression
to compare the risk of the individual engaging in violent acts in the week following the
exposure to a trigger with the risk during earlier periods of equivalent length. All
time-invariant confounders (eg, genetic and early environmental influences) were controlled
for by this research design and we further adjusted for time-varying sociodemographic
factors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of violent crime occurring in
the week following the exposure to a trigger event compared with earlier periods.
RESULTS Among the sample of 2 827 607 individuals (1 492 186 male and 1 335 421 female),
all of the examined trigger events were associated with increased risk of violent crime in the
week following exposure. The largest 1-week absolute risk of violent crime was observed
following exposure to violence (70-177 violent crimes per 10 000 persons). For most triggers,
the relative risks did not vary significantly by diagnosis, including unintentional injuries (aOR
range, 3.5-4.8), self-harm (aOR range, 3.9-4.2), and substance intoxication (aOR range,
3.0-4.0). Differences by diagnosis included parental bereavement, which was significantly
higher in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (aOR, 5.0; 95% CI, 3.0-8.1)
compared with controls (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In addition to identifying risk factors for violence, clarifying
the timing of the triggers may provide opportunities to improve risk assessment and
management in individuals with psychotic disorders.

P
atients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum and bi-
polardisordershavehigherratesofviolentcriminalcon-
victions than do the general population,1,2 particu-
larly if they have comorbid substance use disorders.3,4 A recent
systematic review5 has further identified elevated rates of im-
pulsivity and hostility, as well as nonadherence to treatment,
as key modifiable risk factors for violence in individuals with
psychotic disorders. An important limitation of the literature
is the relative neglect of temporal effects; little is known about
triggers that occur within days of the incident violent event.
In other noncommunicable disorders, particularly cardiovas-
cular diseases, triggers have been shown to have important
effects on serious outcomes. For example, modifiable psycho-
logical factors (eg, anger, anxiety, and depression), elevated
work stress, and unintentional work injuries can act as trig-
gers of myocardial infarction and stroke.6
Three pilot studies7-9 conducted within Swedish cor-
rectional and forensic settings on 327 individuals have
suggested that certain symptoms and, particularly, alcohol in-
toxication and high doses of benzodiazepines may trigger vio-
lence within 24 hours. However, the generalizability of these
findings remains limited owing to their small and highly se-
lected samples. More important, it is not known how such trig-
gers act in individuals with psychosis; less than 20% of those
included in previous work had a psychotic disorder,7-9 and
whether patients with psychosis act differently from the gen-
eral population needs clarification. The identification of trig-
gers for violence is potentially clinically important for risk
assessment, which is recommended in patients with schizo-
phrenia by systematic reviews10,11 but currently relies mostly
on historical factors and is moderately accurate at best.12 In ad-
dition, delineating the role of triggers may assist in develop-
ing new treatments by, for example, identifying targets for cog-
nitive behavioral therapy. This possibility aligns with recent
theoretical work in criminology that emphasizes the ways in
which situation-specific factors moderate individual risks of
offending.13 Both prediction of aggression and violent
behaviors14 and psychological treatments reducing risk15 have
limited real-world effects and providing more evidence on risk
factors, such as triggers, could suggest novel interventions that
could mitigate their effect.
To address the lack of evidence on triggers for violence in
patients with psychosis, we used nationwide Swedish data for
approximately 3.1 million individuals born between 1958
and 1988, including 64 595 patients diagnosed with psy-
chotic disorders. This cohort represents a substantial
increase in sample size compared with all previous work on
risk factors for violence in patients with psychosis; a 2013
systematic review of 110 studies was based on 45 533
patients.5 That review identified substance use, impulsivity,
positive symptoms, treatment nonadherence, exposure to
violence, and self-harm as key risk factors. Two important
limitations were further highlighted by the review; little is
known about the causal and temporal mechanisms linking
the risk factors with violence.
Bytriggers,wemeanproximalriskfactors,includingstress-
ful life events, occurring in the week before the incident vio-
lent offense. We only considered triggers that had either been
considered as risk factors or consequences of violence in pre-
vious studies.16-19 We adopted a within-individual design,20
where each individual acted as his or her own control across
time. This design is important because this approach
accounts for all constant factors within each individual (eg,
genetic and childhood environmental influences). We also
addressed time-varying confounding by adjusting for a com-
prehensive set of sociodemographic factors that were reliably
collected on each individual. In addition, we were able to
explore whether our findings were moderated by individual
diagnosis, as research suggests that the etiologic determi-
nants of the risk of violence differ between patients with
schizophrenia and those with bipolar disorder.21
Methods
Swedish Nationwide Registers
StatisticsSweden,anindependentgovernmentalagency,main-
tains several nationwide longitudinal registries with rou-
tinely gathered data derived from many governmental agen-
cies linked by a personal identification number. Following
institutional review board approval from the Regional Re-
search Ethics Committee in Stockholm, we were given access
to anonymized data.
The National Patient Register provided data on all inpa-
tient hospitalization episodes (based on International Classi-
ficationofDiseaseseighthandnintheditions[ICD-8andICD-9]
and International Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems [ICD-10] codes) and specialist outpatient care visits
(based on ICD-10 codes).22 The Multi-Generation Register,
which encompasses all Swedish residents, enabled us to link
the participants with their biological parents. Emigration and
mortality dates came from specific registers. Dates of violent
crime were taken from the National Crime Register, which in-
cludes all criminal convictions. We chose dates that crimes oc-
curred rather than conviction dates. The Integrated Database
for Labour Market Research and the Small Area Marketing Sta-
tistics Register provided annual data on sociodemographic
factors between 1990 and 2012, measured at the end of each
year.
Key Points
Question What are important triggers for violent crime in patients
diagnosed with psychotic disorders and do these associations with
violence differ from those in population controls?
Findings In this population-based time-stratified case-crossover
study, all of the triggers, which included exposure to violence,
traumatic brain injuries, unintentional injuries, self-harm,
substance intoxication, and parental bereavement, contributed to
elevated relative risks of violent crime among patients with
psychotic disorders in the week after their occurrence compared
with earlier periods within the same individuals.
Meaning Triggers contribute to the risk of violent crime in
patients with psychotic disorders as well as controls. These
findings may offer opportunities to improve the monitoring and
management of the risk of violence.

Sample
Our sample consisted of all 3 435 357 residents born in Swe-
den between 1958 and 1988 who could be linked with both bio-
logical parents. We excluded 56 721 individuals who died be-
fore the start of the study (January 1, 2001) and 254 912 with
incomplete data on sociodemographics, leaving 90.9% of the
original sample (n = 3 123 724).
Measures
In keeping with previous work,23,24 we defined violent crime
as conviction for homicide, assault, robbery, threats and vio-
lence against an officer, unlawful threats, unlawful coercion,
kidnapping, illegal confinement, arson, intimidation, or sexual
offenses (rape, indecent assault, indecent exposure, or child
molestation, but excluding prostitution, hiring of prosti-
tutes, or possession of child pornography).
Trigger Events
We examined 2 stressful life events: exposure to violence and
parental bereavement. In addition, we examined 3 injury-
related triggers (self-harm, traumatic brain injury, and unin-
tended injuries) and substance intoxication (eTable 1 in the
Supplement). Diagnoses of exposure to violence,25 traumatic
brain injury,26 and unintended injuries27 have been vali-
dated. We excluded trigger events that occurred within 14 days
of each other to avoid duplication of the same episode.
Psychotic Disorders
To explore moderation effects, we identified individuals with
lifetime diagnoses of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (here-
after referred to as schizophrenia) and bipolar disorder. The Na-
tional Patient Register diagnoses of schizophrenia28 or bipo-
lardisorder29havebeenvalidated.Wedefinedhealthycontrols
as individuals who had never been diagnosed with any psy-
chiatric disorder (excluding substance use disorder).
Sociodemographic Factors
Single status was defined as not being married or registered
in a same-sex partnership. Low educational level referred to
notachievingsecondaryschoolqualifications.30Frequentresi-
dential relocations indicated an individual changing his or her
residential address at least 4 times in a given year. Residence
inadeprivedneighborhoodindicatedthattheindividual’
sstan-
dardized neighborhood deprivation score31 ranked in the top
decile. Low family income indicated that the individual’
s dis-
posable family income fell below the bottom decile. We also
measured whether the individuals had been recipients of un-
employment benefits, means-tested welfare benefits, and/or
disability pension.
Research Design
To test the effects of triggers on violent crime, we adopted a
within-individual design in which the included individuals
were their own controls, allowing us to control for time-
constant confounders (eg, genetic and early childhood envi-
ronmental factors). The rationale is to examine the risk of
the individual committing a violent crime in the 7 days fol-
lowing exposure to a trigger and comparing this risk with
earlier control periods when they were unexposed to any
trigger. The control periods had an equivalent follow-up
period of 7 days and were measured every 30 days before
the exposure to the trigger, up to a maximum of 1080 days
(36 months). We allowed individuals to be exposed to mul-
tiple triggers throughout the entire follow-up period. We
defined control periods for subsequent trigger exposures
using the same criteria as above, with 1 exception: we only
retained control periods that had occurred after the preced-
ing trigger event.
Statistical Analysis
We selected individuals who had been exposed to any of
the 6 triggers between January 1, 2001, and December 15,
2013. From the index date of the trigger, we identified all of
the available retrospective control periods for each indi-
vidual. Data on sociodemographic factors measured at the
end of the previous year were recorded to adjust for poten-
tial bias.
We estimated odds ratios and corresponding 95% CIs for
the associations between each trigger and violent crime
while adjusting for all individual-specific factors by fitting
conditional logistic regression models with individuals as
strata. Because the comparisons of the risk of violence
across exposures to triggers were made within each indi-
vidual rather than between individuals, the research design
controls for all constant factors within an individual (eg, sex
and race/ethnicity). In the crude model, we adjusted for age
and calendar month. In the adjusted model, we further
adjusted for time-varying sociodemographic factors, includ-
ing single status, low educational level, frequent residential
relocations, low family income, residence in deprived
neighborhoods, and being the recipient of unemployment
benefits, social assistance, or disability pension benefits. In
complementary analyses, we tested whether narrower defi-
nitions of psychotic disorders (eTable 2 in the Supplement),
longer follow-up periods (eTable 3 in the Supplement), and
effect moderation by sociodemographic factors altered our
findings (eTable 4 through eTable 9 in the Supplement).
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the distribution of
sociodemographic characteristics within each group of indi-
viduals in the population (n = 3 123 724) that had ever met
criteria for schizophrenia (34 903 [1.1%]) or bipolar disorder
(29 692 [1.0%]), as well as the unaffected control group
(2 763 012 [88.5%]). All indicators of poor psychosocial func-
tioning were more common in patients with psychotic dis-
orders, particularly schizophrenia, when compared with the
controls (Table 1).
Absolute risks for violent crime were typically highest
among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, followed by
those diagnosed with bipolar disorder and, last, the unaf-
fected controls (Table 2). Furthermore, we observed that the
rates of a violent crime occurring in the week following expo-
sure to a trigger were considerably elevated when compared

withtheirrespectivecontrolperiods(Table2).Thisfindingwas
consistent for patients with both psychotic disorders and the
controls. Exposure to violence contributed to the largest ab-
solute risks of violent offending, with rates ranging between
70 and 177 violent crimes per 10 000 persons in the week fol-
lowing the violent exposure event compared with 9 to 22 vio-
lent crimes per 10 000 persons during the control periods in
the same individuals.
We further found that there remained an increased rela-
tive risk of violent crime occurring immediately following the
occurrence of all the examined triggers, even after account-
ingforallconstantconfounders(eg,geneticandchildhoodfam-
ily environmental influences) and a wide range of time-
varying sociodemographic factors (Figure). The adjusted odds
ratios (aORs) ranged between 7.6 and 12.7 for exposure to vio-
lence, 4.2 and 6.7 for traumatic brain injuries, 3.5 and 4.8 for
unintentional injuries, 3.9 and 4.2 for self-harm, 3.0 and 4.0
for substance intoxication, and 1.7 and 5.0 for parental be-
reavement. These findings were not materially different from
those of the unadjusted models (eTable 10 in the Supple-
ment) or models using narrower definitions of the psychotic
disorders (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Moreover, we did not
find strong evidence of effect modification by psychosis across
the triggers, with 1 exception: parental bereavement was as-
sociated with a 5-fold increase in the odds of schizophrenia,
which was significantly elevated compared with the controls
(aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.2).
The effects of the triggers weakened across time (eTable
3 in the Supplement), thus providing additional support for
their transient effect on violence. This effect was most notice-
able in the case of exposure to violence. Among patients di-
agnosed with schizophrenia, the risk of violent offending fol-
lowing exposure to violence dropped from a nearly 13-fold
increase (aOR, 12.7; 95% CI, 8.2-19.6) in the first week to a fully
attenuated association in the second week (aOR, 0.8; 95% CI,
0.4-2.0), which persisted into the third week (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI,
0.5-2.3).Similarresultswerefoundinpatientswithbipolardis-
order and in the controls.
We found little evidence for the presence of moderation
effects by sociodemographic factors (eTable 4 through
eTable 9 in the Supplement). Following Bonferroni correc-
tion, we found that only 4 of 180 tests (2.2%) were statisti-
cally significant. Consistent with interpretation of a ceiling
effect, we found that individuals in the control group who
were recipients of welfare benefits and those who had only
achieved a low educational level had lower relative risks of
violent offending following exposure to violence and trau-
matic brain injury.
Discussion
We conducted a nationwide within-individual study examin-
ing the role of triggers for violent criminality in 64 595 pa-
tientsdiagnosedwithpsychoticdisordersandin2 763 012con-
trols. The triggers included 2 stressful life events (parental
bereavement and exposure to violence), 3 injury-related trig-
gers (self-harm, traumatic brain injury, and unintentional in-
juries), and substance intoxication.
First, we found statistically significant associations
between all triggers and the rate of violent criminality in the
week following the exposure compared with the rate of vio-
lent criminality in earlier control periods. Findings of
complementary sensitivity analyses using different diag-
nostic criteria were consistent with our overall findings.
More important, we also observed that the triggers had less
effect as follow-up time increased. These findings support
the hypothesis that recent exposure to a stressful life event,
an intentional or unintentional injury, or having been diag-
nosed with substance intoxication increases the short-term

Second, we found that the absolute risks of violence
occurring in the week following exposure to the triggers dif-
fered by individual diagnosis, with the strongest effects
being observed in patients with schizophrenia, followed by
those with bipolar disorder and controls. However, relative
risks across the 3 groups were similar. The only exception to
this rule was parental bereavement, where we found stron-

levels of social support from family members and close
friends in the controls32 may be protective against violence.
More generally, these findings suggest that interventions to
minimize the risk of violence in individuals who have expe-
rienced injuries and substance intoxication should target
not only psychiatric patients but also the general popula-
tion. Current clinical guidelines for alcohol use disorders33
recommend that trained professionals in the health and
social care sectors should routinely screen patients for
harmful drinking and offer affected individuals structured
brief advice to reduce their alcohol consumption. The effi-
cacy of such brief interventions has been recently con-
firmed in a systematic review.34 Nonexperimental data have
further suggested more comprehensive interventions aimed
at reducing violence rates among individuals admitted to
emergency departments for injury due to exposure to vio-
lence by closely following up high-risk patients with a mul-
tidisciplinary team that includes physicians, nurses, and
social workers.35 If such efforts prove to be effective in
large-scale randomized trials, our findings suggest that
expanding them to include a wider range of injury and
substance-related triggers may reduce rates of violence in
patient groups and the general population.
Third, our findings demonstrating that self-harm in-
creases the risk of interpersonal violence are, to our knowl-
edge, novel. Prior studies36,37 have generally viewed self-
harm as a consequence of interpersonal violence38,39 and
research examining the direction of the association between
self-inflicted and interpersonal violence is inconclusive.19,40
Our findings suggest that self-harming patients, particularly
those with psychoses, are an important group to be assessed
for interpersonal violence in addition to the routinely exam-
ined risk of suicide.
Previous studies have considered all of these triggers as
risk factors or consequences of violence,16-19 but only 3 stud-
ies have considered triggers for violence using within-
individualdesignsinsmallandhighlyselectedclinicalsamples
with a combined total of 70 patients with psychosis using short
follow-up periods and no population controls.7-9
Four methodological limitations to our study should be
considered. First, despite our efforts to minimize confound-
ing, we cannot exclude the possibility that other time-
varying confounders simultaneously explain the co-
occurrences of the examined triggers and violent criminality.
In the case of the psychotic disorders, for instance, exposure
to a specific trigger and the resulting violent outcome may be
simultaneously caused by an acute phase of a psychotic or
manic episode. The effect of such confounding factors are,
however, likely to be marginal, as our findings suggest that the
relativerisksofviolencefollowingmosttriggersareeithersimi-
lar or stronger in the unaffected controls compared with the
patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders. Future work
should therefore focus on replicating these findings across dif-
ferent contexts and designs. More clinically rich cohorts could,
in addition, examine the underlying causal mechanisms link-
ing the triggers to each other as well as to later adverse out-
comes, including acts of violence. By adopting life-course ap-
proaches, such studies could concurrently investigate a wide
range of distal and proximal risk factors for violence in adult-
hood. These factors include impulsivity and positive symp-
toms that our data sets did not have reliable data to examine.
Furthermore, the combination of such approaches with lon-
ger follow-up data could address whether recurrent expo-
sures to a given trigger confer higher risks of violence than the
first episode.
Second, our violent crime measure was derived from
nationwide conviction data, which constitute a comprehen-
sive measure of severe offenses but less comprehensiveness
for minor offenses. The extent to which our results would
have differed if we had access to data on nonreported vio-
lent acts and triggering events remains therefore an empiri-
cal question that should be addressed in future research.
Alternative approaches, such as gathering self-reported
data, tend to be subject to other methodological limitations,
including increased measurement error,41 which artificially
deflates estimates down to the null.42 Third, the data on
sociodemographic factors were measured at the end of each
year. Any changes that had occurred between the end of the
previous year up until the measurement of the trigger and
control periods were consequently subject to misclassifica-
tion bias. However, given that the combined effects of all
sociodemographic factors did not affect the crude associa-
tions, we expect such bias to be minimal. Fourth, it is pos-
sible for an individual to engage in interpersonal violence
and consequently require treatment for being injured dur-
ing exposure to violence. We attempted to separate these
effects by considering only violent offenses that occurred
after hospital discharge.
The generalizability of the presented findings is an impor-
tant consideration. Comparative studies on police-recorded
rates of common types of serious violent offenses have been
shown to be fairly similar across high-income countries.43 Vio-
lence prevalence estimates for psychotic disorders vary mini-
mally across European countries and the United States.44-46
Age and disability-adjusted life years attributed to uninten-
tional injuries are similar across Sweden, the United King-
dom,andtheUnitedStates.47Sweden’
sestimatedalcoholsales
per capita are comparable to those of the United States48 and
nationally representative data from Sweden and the United
Kingdom on self-reported exposure to violence rates indicate
marginaldifferences.49,50Thus,forkeyexposuresandourout-
come,SwedenisnotclearlydifferentfromWesternEuropeand
the United States.
Conclusions
Using a novel approach and large sample size, we have
shown the importance of triggers for the risk of violence in
patients with psychotic disorders. By including controls, we
were able to examine possible mechanisms by which they
could act. To our knowledge, identifying triggers for vio-
lence has not been incorporated into many risk assessment
approaches, but our findings suggest that it may provide
opportunities to improve the monitoring and management
of violence risk.
