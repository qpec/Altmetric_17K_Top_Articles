Abstract
Metastasis is the leading cause of death for cancer patients. This multi-stage process requires 
tumour cells to survive in the circulation, extravasate at distant sites, then proliferate; it involves 
contributions from both the tumour cell and tumour microenvironment (‘host’, which includes

 stromal cells and the immune system1). Studies suggest the early steps of the metastatic process 
are relatively efficient, with the post-extravasation regulation of tumour growth (‘colonization’) 
being critical in determining metastatic outcome2. Here we show the results of screening 810 
mutant mouse lines using an in vivo assay to identify microenvironmental regulators of metastatic 
colonization. We identify 23 genes that, when disrupted in mouse, modify the ability of tumour 
cells to establish metastatic foci, with 19 of these genes not previously demonstrated to play a role 
in host control of metastasis. The largest reduction in pulmonary metastasis was observed in 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter spinster homologue 2 (Spns2)-deficient mice. We 
demonstrate a novel outcome of S1P-mediated regulation of lymphocyte trafficking, whereby 
deletion of Spns2, either globally or in a lymphatic endothelial-specific manner, creates a 
circulating lymphopenia and a higher percentage of effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells 
present in the lung. This allows for potent tumour cell killing, and an overall decreased metastatic 
burden.
To identify microenvironmental genes that regulate metastatic colonization, we performed 
an ‘experimental metastasis assay’ involving intravenous injection of B16-F10 mouse 
metastatic melanoma cells, used previously in the development of checkpoint inhibitors such 
as CTLA4 and PD-1 (refs 3, 4), and the assessment of pulmonary colonization (Fig. 1a). The 
810 mutant mouse lines we assayed were randomly selected and cover a diverse range of 
molecular functions (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Using a stringent 
two-stage selection process, we identified 23 mutant lines showing significantly decreased or 
increased numbers of pulmonary melanoma foci, defined as a ratio of ≤0.6 or ≥1.6 and P ≤ 
0.0175 (Mann–Whitney test) for mutant mice versus wild types assayed concurrently (in the 
initial cohort assayed (Fig. 1a)), and P < 0.01 in an integrative data analysis performed on 
three or more additional cohorts (Supplementary Table 2 and Methods). Since these strains 
were extensively phenotyped5, we were able to determine that alterations of immune-related 
phenotypic traits featured prominently in these 23 mutant lines (Fig. 1b), highlighting the 
key role of the immune system in microenvironmental regulation of metastasis.
Of the eight genes identified as suppressors of pulmonary metastases, two were members of 
the interferon regulatory family (IRF), important for immune function; loss of Irf1 or Irf7 
increased pulmonary metastasis (as well as extra-pulmonary metastases in Irf1tm1a/tm1a 
mice), probably related to defects in their type-I interferon (IFN)-dependent response6,7. In 
contrast, Irf5-deficient mice, with their largely intact type-I IFN response8, showed no 
altered pulmonary metastasis phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 1b–f). Similarly, the increased 
metastasis seen in the p110 catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pik3cg)-deficient 
mice may be related to the critical function of this gene in multiple aspects of T cell, NK cell 
and neutrophil function9,10, and the increased metastasis seen in immunoglobulin heavy 
chain 6 (Ighm)-deficient mice is probably due to their multiple immune system 
abnormalities11. In contrast, very little is known about the other four genes we identified as 
microenvironmental suppressors of metastasis, namely Abhd17a, Dph6, Slc9a3r2 and 
Rnf10, which represent novel factors for further studies. Of the 15 mutant mouse lines we 
identified as having decreased pulmonary melanoma colonies, only four have been 
previously described as having roles in regulating metastasis: Entpd1 (Cd39), Nbeal2, Cybb 
and Hsp90aa1, contributing to regulatory T-cell control of NK cells12, platelet α-granule

 function13, generation of phagocyte-derived oxygen radicals14 and the chaperoning of client 
proteins involved in tumour progression15, respectively.
We focused on the S1P transporter Spns2, as Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice showed the greatest 
suppression in the number of pulmonary metastatic melanoma foci, with Spns2tm1a/+ mice 
showing an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 2a). Further, Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice showed reduced 
numbers of foci in the lungs after tail vein administration of lung CMT-167, colorectal 
MC-38 or breast EO771.LMB cancer cells (Fig. 2b), and decreased spontaneous pulmonary 
metastasis (both in number and size of metastatic foci) after subcutaneous administration of 
HCmel12–mCherry melanoma cells (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2a). In contrast, there 
was no difference in the growth rate of the primary tumour between wild-type and 
Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice, either for HCmel12–mCherry or B16-BL6 melanoma cells, and no 
difference in the spontaneous incidence of cancer in aged wild-type and Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 2b–d). Tail vein administration of transformed melanocyte WT31 cells 
(Fig. 2d) and intra-splenic administration of B16-F10 cells (Fig. 2e) resulted in a reduced 
number of foci in the livers of Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice, suggesting that resistance to metastatic 
colonization is not pulmonary-restricted.
S1P is a bioactive lipid mediator that plays important roles in diverse cellular functions such 
as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and tumorigenesis16. Previous studies have 
shown that SPNS2 functions as a cell-surface S1P transporter that allows intracellular S1P to 
be secreted into the blood and lymph17–19. In agreement with previous studies17,19, S1P was 
decreased in serum and increased in lungs of Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice (Extended Data Fig. 3a, 
b). Although extracellular S1P is a key regulator of endothelial barrier homeostasis20, 
vascular permeability/extravasation of Evans Blue dye in Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice was the same 
as in controls (Extended Data Fig. 3c), as was the arrival of B16-F10 cells in the lung 90 min 
after tail vein administration (Extended Data Fig. 3d). However, a significant increase in the 
number of pulmonary B16-F10 cells showing evidence of apoptosis was observed after 12 h 
(Extended Data Fig. 3e), suggesting that the lungs of Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice represent a hostile 
environment for tumour cell engraftment. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis comparing 
viable B16-F10 cells isolated from lungs 24 h after their administration identified nine 
differentially expressed (upregulated) genes (Supplementary Table 3); six of these genes 
(Pla2g16, Epsti1, Traf1, Glipr2, Marcksl1 and Ccl5) are known to be involved in pro-
metastatic phenotypes of tumour cells, and H2-Q7-positive B16 cells have been shown to be 
targeted by both NK and cytotoxic T cells21. Thus, the transcriptional profile of B16-F10 
cells from Spns2tm1a/tm1a lungs suggests they are upregulating genes to facilitate their 
survival in a hostile environment, while at the same time provoking activation of the immune 
system.
One of the most notable effects of S1P is the regulation of lymphocyte trafficking22. SPNS2 
has been reported to function as an S1P transporter in endothelial cells but not in 
erythrocytes or platelets17. In agreement with others17–19,23, Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice have a 
profound reduction in circulating T and B cells, with all other leukocyte (including NK 
cells) and blood cell lineages unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). In the lung, the 
percentage of T cells was significantly reduced with a small reduction in the B cell 
percentage and increased NK cells (Fig. 3a), with similar phenotypes observed in the liver

 (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Consistent with Spns2 expression in endothelial cells17, bone 
marrow chimaeras showed a lymphocyte and metastatic colonization phenotype identical to 
the genotype of the host (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 4e, f), confirming that non-
haematopoietic stroma regulates these observations. Expression of Spns2 by endothelial 
cells is required for the maintenance of an S1P gradient in the lymph that is critical for 
regulating lymphocyte circulation18. In agreement with this, we showed that mice with 
lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-specific deletion of Spns2 (Spns2tm1c/tm1c; Lyve1cre/+ 
mice) did not have altered serum or lung S1P levels (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b), yet 
displayed lymphopenia in the blood (Fig. 3c), lungs (Fig. 3d) and other tissues examined 
(Extended Data Fig. 5c). Critically, this resulted in a decreased number of pulmonary 
metastasis in Spns2tm1c/tm1c; Lyve1cre/+ mice administered either B16-F10 or MC-38 cells 
(Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 5d).
We next set out to establish the contribution of SPNS2 to the pulmonary immune 
microenvironment. S1P–S1PR1 signalling is essential for the recirculation of naive T cells; 
however, memory T cells downregulate S1PR1 expression and rely on chemokine receptors 
for trafficking24. In contrast, NK cell trafficking in response to S1P requires S1PR5 not 
S1PR1 (ref. 25). In agreement with this differential requirement of S1P for trafficking, 
Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice showed a significantly higher percentage of anti-tumoural effector 
memory T cells (CD44hiCD62Llo) relative to immune suppressive regulatory T cells 
(CD4+CD25+), thus providing an enhanced effector:regulatory T cell ratio (Fig. 3f and 
Extended Data Fig. 6a, b), with the same observed in Spns2tm1c/tm1c; Lyve1cre/+ mice (Fig. 
3g and Extended Data Fig. 6c, d). An increased proportion of activated T cells (KLRG1+, 
CD69+ and CXCR3+) were also observed in the lungs of Spns2tm1a/tm1a and Spns2tm1c/tm1c; 
Lyve1cre/+ mice (Extended Data Fig. 6e, f), with a similar phenotype seen in the liver 
(Extended Data Fig. 7).
Based on this activated phenotype, we performed ex vivo re-stimulation assays, where T 
cells were isolated from the lungs of Spns2tm1a/tm1a and control mice 5 days after in vivo 
activation with B16-F10 cells. Using pharmacological stimulation, both CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells from Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice showed an enhanced degranulation response (cell surface 
expression of CD107a/LAMP1), and increased intracellular interferon-γ (IFN-γ) relative to 
control mice (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Interestingly, only CD8+ T cells demonstrated 
enhanced degranulation when co-cultured with B16-F10 cells ex vivo suggestive of the 
presence of an improved antigen-specific response towards B16-F10 (Fig. 4a). This 
functionally resulted in enhanced B16-F10 target cell killing in an ex vivo cytotoxicity assay 
(Fig. 4b), and increased IFN-γ in lung lysates from B16-F10-stimulated Spns2tm1a/tm1a and 
Spns2tm1c/tm1c; Lyve1cre/+ mice (Fig. 4c). Similarly, increased IFN-γ was also observed in 
lung lysates from MC-38-stimulated Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice (Extended Data Fig. 8c) indicating 
that this is not a B16-F10 restricted phenomenon. Although there was a significant increase 
in the relative proportion of NK cells in the lung, no difference in NK cell function could be 
observed ex vivo in Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b), in agreement with 
normal NK cell KLRG1, CD69 and CXCR3 expression in both Spns2tm1a/tm1a and 
Spns2tm1c/tm1c; Lyve1Cre/+ mice (Extended Data Fig. 8d, e).

 To determine whether the beneficial effects of Spns2 in regulating metastatic colonization 
could be mediated by CD8+ T cells, we performed in vivo depletion experiments using anti-
CD8 antibodies. However, paradoxically, depletion of CD8+ T cells (or all T and B cells, 
such as in Rag1 knockout mice) has previously been shown to decrease B16-F10 pulmonary 
metastasis (but not primary tumour growth); this phenomenon has been explained by the 
‘pro-tumoural’ phenotype of CD8+ T cells before tumour cell exposure versus the ‘anti-
tumoural’ effect of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells26. Indeed, we replicated this finding 
observing decreased pulmonary B16-F10 metastases in CD8+ T-cell-depleted wild-type 
mice (Fig. 4d; and Rag2 knockout mice, Extended Data Fig. 9); however, a genotype-
specific effect was still observed in Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice, suggesting the involvement of 
additional cell types in the regulation of metastatic colonization. Given that we observed 
compensatory NK cell activation (CD69+) in the lungs of CD8+ T-cell-depleted 
Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice (Fig. 4e), we hypothesized NK cells could be responsible for the 
significantly reduced metastasis count compared with wild types. To explore this observation 
further, we performed NK cell depletion, resulting in increased B16-F10 metastases as 
reported previously26; however, Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice still showed a significantly reduced 
number of metastatic foci compared with wild types (Fig. 4f), in agreement with the 
enhanced CD8+ response to B16-F10 cells observed ex vivo (Fig. 4a). To demonstrate the 
dual cellular identity responsible for protection in Spns2tm1a/tm1a we co-depleted NK and 
CD8+ cells in vivo restoring the number of metastatic foci observed in Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice 
to those of wild-type (Fig. 4f). Thus, we demonstrate that both CD8+ T cells and NK cells 
can contribute to the reduced pulmonary metastatic burden observed in Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice. 
An alteration of lymphatic endothelial cell function or lung sphingolipid levels in Spns2-
deficient mice may also contribute to the reduced pulmonary metastatic burden we observe.
Finally, we sought to manipulate the S1P axis pharmacologically by inhibiting S1P lyase, 
which degrades S1P, using 4′-deoxypyridoxine (DOP), a compound previously shown to 
increase lymphoid tissue S1P levels and induce a circulating lymphopenia22. DOP treatment 
phenocopied the immune and pulmonary metastasis phenotype of Spns2tm1a/tm1a mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 10), further validating the importance of the S1P axis in control of 
pulmonary metastatic burden. Importantly modulation of SPNS2 could be a more favourable 
approach than the S1P-blocking antibody Sphingomab27,28 or the prodrug FTY720 (ref. 24) 
(which is phosphorylated in vivo to a functional antagonist of S1PR1) as these interventions 
increase regulatory T cell activity, suppress proliferation of effector T cells29,30 and increase 
vascular permeability18. Furthermore, as lymphatic endothelial cell-specific deletion of 
Spns2 is sufficient to regulate lymphocyte circulation to allow a higher percentage of 
effector T cells and NK cells in the lung (and liver) and more tumour cell killing, targeting 
SPNS2 is potentially a more promising option for regulating metastatic colonization than 
existing S1P pathway modulators.

 described previously. Spns2tm1c(KOMP)Wtsi (referred to as tm1c/tm1c) mice were generated 
from crossing Spns2tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi mice with Flp-deleter mice33 and crossed to Lyve1cre 
mice to generate experimental mice (tm1c/tm1c; Lyve1cre/+) with littermates used as 
controls (tm1c/+; Lyve1+/+ and tm1c/tm1c; Lyve1+/+; referred to as ‘controls’). The care and 
use of all mice in this study were in accordance with the UK Animals in Science Regulation 
Unit’s Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals Bred, Supplied or Used for 
Scientific Purposes, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 
2012, and all procedures were performed under a UK Home Office Project licence, which 
was reviewed and approved by the Sanger Institute’s Animal Welfare and Ethical Review 
Body (unless otherwise stated). Housing and husbandry conditions were as described 
previously34, with the exceptions that a cage density of one to six mice per cage was used 
and mice were maintained on Mouse Breeders Diet (Laboratory Diets, 5021-3) throughout 
the study. Unless specified otherwise, all mice were used at 6–12 weeks of age.
General experimental design
For most experiments, random allocation to treatment group was achieved through the 
process of Mendelian inheritance, with age- and sex-matched mice being selected across 
different litters and matings (to minimize potential litter and/or cage effects). The two 
exceptions were the NK cell depletion study and bone marrow chimaera study: in these 
studies, Mendelian inheritance was used to randomize assignment of animals to a genotype 
group; then, within this block, alternate allocation was used to assign treatment. Unless 
specified otherwise, the researcher was not blinded to the identity of the genotype and/or 
treatment of a mouse during any procedures because these were written on the cage card. 
Pilot experiments were performed to determine sample size with adequate statistical power 
for all studies except the high throughput screen where this this was not possible owing to 
the scale of breeding that would be required. For each procedure, exclusion criteria used are 
listed where applicable in the materials and methods. If no exclusion criteria are detailed, all 
data were included. The manuscript was prepared to meet ARRIVE reporting guidelines35.
Cell lines
The mouse melanoma B16-F10 cell line was purchased from ATCC (CRL-6475) and the 
highly metastatic mouse melanoma B16-BL6 cell line was purchased from the University of 
Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center and authenticated by whole genome and transcriptome 
sequencing. The mouse lung carcinoma CMT-167 cell line was purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (10032302) and the other cell lines were obtained from the laboratories that 
generated them. Specifically, the metastatic mouse colorectal MC-38 cell line36 was a gift 
from L. Borsig (University of Zurich, Switzerland), the metastatic mouse mammary cancer 
EO771.LMB cell line37 was a gift from R. L. Anderson (Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 
Australia), the metastatic HCmel12–mCherry melanoma cell line38 was a gift from T. Tuting 
(University Hospital Magdeburg, Germany) and the transformed mouse melanocyte WT31 
cell line (Tyr::NrasQ61K/°; INK4a−/−)39 was a gift from O. Sansom (Beatson Institute for 
Cancer Research, Scotland). None of the cell lines used appears in the International Cell 
Line Authentication Committee database. All cells (apart from WT31 cells) were maintained 
in DMEM with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/
streptomycin (with the addition of 20 mM HEPES for EO771.LMB cells) at 37 °C, 5% CO2.

 WT31 cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine, 
100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. All cell lines were screened for the 
presence of mycoplasma and mouse pathogens (at Charles River Laboratories, USA) before 
culturing and never cultured for more than five passages. The B16-F10–mCherry cells, 
stably expressing mCherry, were generated by co-transfection of B16-F10 cells with 4.5 µg 
of PB-CAGG-LUC-2A–mCherry–PURO-PB plasmid (a gift from D. Ryan, Wellcome Trust 
Sanger Institute) and 0.5 µg of PBase-expressing plasmid using Fugene HD (Promega) 
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After selection in 5 µg/mL puromycin 
(Gibco BRL) for 10 days, cell sorting was performed (MoFlo XDP, Beckman Coulter) to 
select for those cells expressing high levels of mCherry and was maintained in 5 µg/mL 
puromycin.
Experimental metastasis assay
B16-F10 (4 × 105), CMT-167 (1 × 105), MC-38 (4 × 105), EO771.LMB (4 × 105) or WT31 
(2.5 × 106) cells resuspended in 0.1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were injected into 
the tail vein of 6- to 12-week-old sex-matched syngeneic control and mutant mice. After 10 
days (or 30 days if WT31 cells were used) the mice were killed, their lungs removed (or 
livers removed if WT31 cells were used) and the number of metastatic foci counted 
macroscopically (for B16-F10 and WT31 cells) or microscopically from formalin-fixed 
haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections by a pathologist (for CMT-167, MC-38 and 
EO771.LMB cells; the pathologist was blinded to the genotypes of the samples). For 
intrasplenic injections of B16-F10 melanoma cells, the mice were anaesthetized under 
isofluorane gas and a laparotomy performed to expose the spleen. B16-F10 cells (1 × 104) 
resuspended in 0.03 mL PBS were injected into the tail of the spleen, after which surgical 
incisions were sutured and surgical clips applied. Animals were monitored throughout 
recovery with dietary support and analgesia (Rimadyl 100 µg/mL ad libitum) provided, as 
approved by the Glasgow University Ethics Committee. After 14 days, the mice were killed, 
their livers removed and the number of metastatic foci counted macroscopically.
Metastatic colonization screen
The experimental metastasis assay (detailed above) was performed by administering 4 × 105 
B16-F10 cells to age- and sex-matched wild-type and mutant mice. The mice were 6–12 
weeks old (typically 6–8 weeks) at time of dosing and dosing cohorts typically consisted of 
12–24 control mice with 3–5 different mutant alleles being screened (3–8 mutant mice per 
allele). To ensure consistency, preparation of the cells, administration into the tail vein and 
counting of pulmonary metastatic foci were performed by the same individual. To ensure a 
high level of accuracy, a two-stage process was implemented, with final calls only being 
made after data had been collected from multiple independent cohorts (the data from all 
mice were included in the analysis except for when the full 0.1 mL of cell suspension were 
not successfully administered because of difficulties at the time of injection). The first stage 
was a high-throughput process to identify lines of potential interest for the second stage; in 
this stage, mutant lines with a ‘metastatic ratio’ (mean number of metastatic foci in the 
mutant cohort divided by mean number of metastatic foci in the wild-type cohort) ≤ 0.6 or ≥ 
1.6 and P ≤ 0.0175 in the Mann–Whitney test (a subsequent analysis estimated a false 
discovery rate of 15%) progressed to the second stage. In the second stage, at least three

 additional cohort(s) of mice (of both sexes) were independently studied and the data 
combined into an integrative data analysis (IDA) as detailed in the Statistics section.
Bone-marrow chimaeras
Wild-type (CD45.1 congenically marked syngeneic) and tm1a/tm1a mice were given 2 × 4.2 
Gy whole-body irradiation followed by tail vein administration of 3 × 106 bone marrow cells 
from either wild-type (CD45.1 congenic) or tm1a/tm1a mice. Six weeks after 
transplantation, a tail vein blood sample was taken from the mice to assess the relative 
proportion of CD45.1 versus CD45.2 cells and the number of T and B lymphocytes present 
in the peripheral blood; 2 days later, an experimental metastasis assay was performed.
In vivo depletion studies
Mice were given intraperitoneal doses of antibodies (anti-CD8 (clone YTS169.4), rat IgG2b 
isotype control (clone LTF-2), anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136), mouse IgG2a (clone C1.18.4)), 
200 µg in 0.1 mL PBS on days −3, 0 and +5, with B16-F10 cells administered by tail vein on 
day 0 (CD8-depletion mice were dosed with 4 × 105 B16-F10 cells; NK and NK/CD8-
depletion mice were dosed with 2 × 105 B16-F10 cells). Tail vein blood samples were 
collected from all mice on day +1 to confirm the depletion was effective. All antibodies were 
‘InVivoMAb’ from BioXCell.
S1P lyase inhibitor studies
For S1P lyase inhibitor studies, the mice were either given glucose (10 g/L) or glucose plus 
4′ deoxypyridoxine (DOP, 30 mg/L; Sigma) in their drinking water 1 week before any 
experimentation (with mice remaining on treatment for the duration of the experiment)22.
Primary tumour growth studies
For examination of orthotopic tumour growth, wild-type and tm1a/tm1a male and female 
mice at 6–8 weeks of age were subcutaneously administered 2.5 × 103 B16-BL6 melanoma 
cells in the flank. The developing tumours were measured every second day and if they had 
reached (or were very close to) 2 cm2 on the day of measurement the mice were 
immediately culled (no tumour was ever more than 2.4 cm2), as approved by a Home Office 
Inspector under the authority of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
Spontaneous metastasis assay
Wild-type and tm1a/tm1a mice were subcutaneously dosed with 2 × 105 HCmel12–mCherry 
melanoma cells and the resulting tumour growth was monitored by inspection and palpation. 
The size of the tumour was measured weekly using Vernier callipers and recorded as mean 
diameter. Mice were killed when progressively growing melanomas exceeded 20 mm in size 
and tissues collected for further analyses (in accordance with institutional and national 
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals with approval by the local government 
authorities (LANUV, NRW, Germany)). The number of macroscopically visible metastases 
present on the lung surface were counted by two independent investigators in a blinded 
fashion.

 Preparation of tissue cell suspensions
Mice were perfused with 20 mL PBS by cardiac puncture and the tissues were disrupted in 
C tubes using program m_lung_01 with an gentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) in Hanks 
Balanced Salt solution (HBSS) containing calcium and magnesium. Liberase DL 
(Collagenase with low dispase content, Roche, Burgess Hill, UK) was added to a final 
concentration of 0.1 U/mL and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The tubes were then 
processed using program m_lung_02 and DNase (0.1 mg/mL) was added for a further 30 
min at 37 °C. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min, resuspended 
in 2 mL fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (D-PBS without calcium and 
magnesium containing 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% fetal calf serum and 0.09% sodium azide), 
passed through a 30 µm cell strainer and analysed on the flow cytometer. To determine the 
number or viability of melanoma cells present in the lungs of mice, the mice were dosed 
with either 1 × 106 B16-F10 cells labelled with 10 µM CFSE (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) 
at 90 min before perfusion or 1 × 106 B16-F10–mCherry cells at 12 h before perfusion. In 
each case, the lung cell suspension was analysed on the flow cytometer. For lung/liver 
leukocyte analysis, the leukocytes were enriched from other cell types in the cell suspension 
on a Percoll discontinuous gradient (67.5%/44%) and washed three times with FACS buffer. 
Single cell suspensions from spleen and lymph nodes (pooled inguinal) were prepared using 
frosted end of microscope slides in FACS buffer. Red blood cells were lysed from spleen 
samples by the addition of 2 mL PharmLyse (BD Biosciences) for 90 s at room temperature 
then stopped by the addition of 10 mL FACS buffer. Both spleen and lymph node samples 
were passed through a 30 µm cell strainer before staining. ‘Naive’ mice were those that had 
not been administered B16-F10 cells and ‘stimulated’ mice were those that had been tail 
vein administered B16-F10 cells 3 or 5 days before analysis as indicated in the figure 
legend.
FACS immunostaining
Samples were blocked with 1 µg of Mouse BD FC Block (anti CD16/32, clone 2.4G2, BD 
Biosciences) for 10 min before addition of multicolour antibody cocktails using titrated 
amounts to give saturating binding (see Supplementary Table 4 for more details). After 
washing, cells were stained with a viability dye (Live/Dead Blue, Invitrogen, 1 in 1,000 
dilution in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature, then washed before acquisition. For 
determination of apoptosis, lung preparations were prepared as above and were stained with 
Caspglow reagent (eBioscience UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for 1 h at 
37 °C. Cells were washed with Annexin binding buffer and stained with Annexin V-APC 
(both BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for 15 min at room 
temperature. Cells were washed with Annexin binding buffer and resuspended Annexin V 
binding buffer containing 1 µg/mL DAPI (Life Technologies) before acquisition. To 
determine absolute cell counts of leukocyte populations, whole blood was counted with a 
haematology analyser (Scil Vetabc) and the white blood cell count was used to derive the 
number cells per microlitre of blood, with the immune cell populations as percentage of 
leukocytes.

 Lung leukocyte cytotoxicity
Leukocytes were prepared from perfused lungs 5 days after B16-F10 injection as described 
above. B16-F10 target cells were labelled with 1 µM CFSE (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). 
Target cells and lung leukocytes were added to 96-well round-bottomed plates at effector to 
target ratios indicated for 4 hours at 37 °C in complete DMEM medium (prepared as 
described in ‘Cell lines’). The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS then resuspended 
in 100 µL Live/Dead far red (Invitrogen, 1 in 1,000 dilution in PBS) for 10 min at room 
temperature. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in BD Cell Fix for 10 min at room 
temperature and washed twice with FACS buffer, before acquisition where 2,000 target cells 
were collected. Cytotoxicity was calculated according to the following equation: (percentage 
of dead target cells with effector cells) − (percentage of dead target cells with no effector 
cells added).
Leukocyte degranulation and IFN-γ production
Leukocytes were prepared from perfused lungs 5 days after B16-F10 injection as described 
above. Cells were stimulated with target cells (B16-F10 at effector to target ratio of 2.5:1) or 
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (100 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL, respectively 
both Sigma-Aldrich). Cells and stimulus were added to 96-well round-bottomed plates in the 
presence of anti-CD107a antibody and BD GolgiStop (monensin, final concentration 2 µM) 
in complete DMEM medium for 4 hours at 37 °C. The plates were washed twice with ice-
cold FACS buffer before blocking then staining with anti-TCRβ, CD45, NK1.1 and CD8α 
antibodies. Cells were then stained with a fixable viability indicator (Live/Dead Blue, 
Invitrogen) before intracellular staining for IFN-γ according to standard methods and 
analysed by flow cytometry where a minimum of 50,000 CD45+ alive leukocyte events were 
collected. CD107a and IFN-γ gates were set on unstimulated leukocyte samples and specific 
degranulation or intracellular IFN-γ staining was calculated by subtracting the leukocyte 
alone unstimulated values from the treated values.
Flow cytometry
All samples were analysed on an LSR II or LSRFortessa (both BD Biosciences) that were 
standardized using BD Cytometer Setup and Tracking Beads and software. Compensation 
was determined using Ultracomp eBeads (eBioscience) for all antibodies, and ArC amide 
binding beads (Invitrogen) for live/dead stains. Data acquisition was controlled with BD 
FACSDiva version 6.3 or version 8.0.1 software. For the analysis of B16-F10 apoptosis, a 
threshold was applied to the mCherry channel (561 nm laser 610/20 BP) to exclude 90% of 
the lung cells. For the analysis of cytotoxicity, a threshold was applied to the CFSE channel 
(488 nm laser 530/30 BP) to exclude 90% of the lung leukocytes. In both cases these were 
established using B16-F10 mCherry- or CFSE-labelled B16-F10 cells. In all other cases an 
FSC-A threshold was used to exclude debris. All samples were analysed using FlowJo 10.7 
and were analysed genotype and/or treatment blind. For all phenotyping data, doublets were 
excluded using FSC-A versus FSC-H gates, sample acquisition issues (such as clumps and 
unstable event rate) were excluded using a time gate against a fluorescent parameter that was 
off the laser with the longest time delay, dead cells were excluded from all tissue analysis 
using a viability indicator and debris excluded with FSC-A versus SSC-A gates. A leukocyte

 gate was set with CD45 and SSC-A and all cell subsets are reported as the percentage of this 
parent gate. T cells were defined as TCRγδ− CD3+ NK1.1− or TCRβ+ NK1.1− with CD4+ 
and CD8+ gates defined on this parent population, NK cells defined as NK1.1+ CD3− or 
TCR−, and B cells defined as CD19+. T and NK cell phenotypes were determined using 
fluorescent minus one controls to establish gating. Data from a sample were excluded if 
there were insufficient events in the parent gate to allow analysis: for example, if there were 
fewer than 50,000 CD45+ alive leukocytes in lung phenotyping data, these were excluded 
from the data set.
Lung IFN-γ determination
Five days after B16-F10 injection lungs were saline perfused and homogenized in Tris-
buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X100 using M tubes and a gentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) 
with program protein_01. Samples were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 g at 
4 °C. IFN-γ levels in the lung lysates were determined using a Ready Set Go ELISA kit 
(eBioscience, Hatfield, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Transcriptome sequencing
Wild-type and tm1a/tm1a mice tail vein dosed with 1 × 106 B16-F10–mCherry cells were 
killed after 24 h and lung cell suspensions prepared as described above. Using a cell sorter 
(MoFlo XDP), B16-F10–mCherry cells were identified after displaying in a bivariate plot of 
SSC-log versus mCherry by gating on high forward scatter versus side scatter to exclude 
some debris and dead cells and positively sorted. RNA was extracted from the sorted cells 
using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and used 
to generate cDNA with the Smart-seq2 protocol40,41. Multiplexed sequencing libraries were 
generated from amplified cDNA using Nextera XT (Illumina). The multiplexed mRNaseq 
libraries were pooled and sequenced across multiple lanes on the Illumina Hiseq 2000 
(version 3). Paired-end 100 bp reads were aligned with STAR version 2.3.0 (ref. 42), 
allowing a minimum (50 bp) and maximum intron size (500,000 bp). STAR genome index 
files were generated using a GTF file corresponding to gene models from ENSEMBL 
version 74 and reference genome version GRCm38. Read counting was performed with 
htseq-count from the HTSeq package (version 0.5.4p5)43. The htseq-count software was run 
with the options ‘intersection-nonempty’ mode, non-stranded, minimum quality 10, and 
‘exon’ was used as the feature type, with ‘gene_id’ as the GTF feature ID. The Bioconductor 
(version 3.1)44 package DESeq2 (version 1.8.1)45 was used for differential expression 
analysis. We used the local fit parameter for dispersion fitting and obtained the significance 
with the DESeq2 negative binomial Wald test function. Genes with adjusted to P < 0.05 after 
Benjamini–Hochberg correction and a log2(fold change) less than −0.59 or greater than 0.59 
was considered significantly differentially expressed.
Analysis of sphingolipids by LC-ESI-MS/MS
Serum and saline perfused lung tissues were collected from the mice. After the addition of 
internal standards (0.5 nmol each; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama, USA) the lipids 
were extracted and sphingolipids were quantified by LC-ESI-MS/MS (4000 QTRAP, AB 
Sciex, Framingham, Massachusetts, USA) as described previously46.

 Statistics
Statistical tests were selected to be appropriate for the data properties (for example, 
normality or homogeneity of variance) and experimental design such that the assumptions of 
the test would be met. Where multiple testing occurred within a study, it was managed by 
controlling the family-wise error rate as detailed in the associated figure legend. Integrative 
data analysis (also called mega-analysis)47 was completed using R (package nlme version 
3.1), treating each experiment as a fixed effect. An iterative top-down modelling strategy 
was implemented starting with the most comprehensive model (either equations (1) or (2)) 
appropriate for the collection strategy implemented and ensuring the model only included 
terms where they could be independently assessed:
(1)
(2)
The optimization process first selected a covariance structure for the residual, then the model 
was reduced by removing non-significant fixed effects, and finally the genotype effect was 
tested and model diagnostics visualized. For the hypothesis test of primary interest, the 
impact of genotype, the per-comparison error rate threshold P values were adjusted to 
account for the multiple comparisons to control the family-wise error rate to 5% using the 
Hochberg method48.
Bioinformatic analysis of molecular functions and phenotype
Using the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) portal (http://www.informatics.jax.org), all 
810 mutant lines screened were separated into unique symbols (to separate out microRNA 
clusters) and annotated with molecular function using the Gene Ontology (GO) batch query 
selecting the GO_Slim annotations. Phenotypic information was pulled from MGI as a batch 
query (MGI 6.06, release date 5 October 2016) and supplemented with annotations from the 
International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC – release 4.3, 26 April 2016) portal 
(http://www.mousephenotype.org). The reported mammalian phenotype (mp) terms returned 
were collapsed to the top-level term for the generation of the heatmap. We were not able to 
discriminate between no phenotype detected and no phenotypic data present; thus both 
outcomes are represented with a blue cell with the presence of phenotypes indicated by the 
red cell.

 Figure 1. Identification of microenvironmental regulators of metastatic colonization of the lung
a, Experimental model (schematic) and results from stage 1 of the screen: experimental 
metastasis assay performed on 810 mutant mouse lines (detailed in the Extended Methods). 
Those lines with a metastatic ratio of ≤0.6 (red box) or ≥1.6 (green box) and Mann–Whitney 
test P ≤ 0.0175 were taken forward to stage 2 as detailed in Methods. b, Top-level 
mammalian phenotype ontology terms for the 23 statistically significant genes following an 
integrative data analysis of experimental metastasis assay results from three or more 
additional cohorts (green is increased metastasis and red is decreased). In the heatmap, red 
boxes indicate a phenodeviant call, and blue no phenotype annotated (either no phenotype 
detected or not assayed) as detailed in Methods.
