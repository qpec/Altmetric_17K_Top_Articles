Abstract
Background: Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a rare, but serious etiology of headache.
The diagnosis of SAH is especially challenging in alert, neurologically intact patients, as missed or
delayed diagnosis can be catastrophic.
Objectives: The objective was to perform a diagnostic accuracy systematic review and meta-analysis of
history, physical examination, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests, computed tomography (CT), and clinical
decision rules for spontaneous SAH. A secondary objective was to delineate probability of disease
thresholds for imaging and lumbar puncture (LP).
Methods: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and research meeting abstracts were searched up to June 2015 for
studies of emergency department patients with acute headache clinically concerning for spontaneous
SAH. QUADAS-2 was used to assess study quality and, when appropriate, meta-analysis was conducted
using random effects models. Outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and positive (LR+) and negative
(LR�) likelihood ratios. To identify test and treatment thresholds, we employed the Pauker-Kassirer
method with Bernstein test indication curves using the summary estimates of diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 5,022 publications were identified, of which 122 underwent full-text review; 22 studies
were included (average SAH prevalence = 7.5%). Diagnostic studies differed in assessment of history and
physical examination findings, CT technology, analytical techniques used to identify xanthochromia, and
criterion standards for SAH. Study quality by QUADAS-2 was variable; however, most had a relatively
low risk of biases. A history of neck pain (LR+ = 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.2 to 7.6) and neck
stiffness on physical examination (LR+ = 6.6; 95% CI = 4.0 to 11.0) were the individual findings most
strongly associated with SAH. Combinations of findings may rule out SAH, yet promising clinical
decision rules await external validation. Noncontrast cranial CT within 6 hours of headache onset
accurately ruled in (LR+ = 230; 95% CI = 6 to 8,700) and ruled out SAH (LR� = 0.01; 95% CI = 0 to 0.04);
CT beyond 6 hours had a LR� of 0.07 (95% CI = 0.01 to 0.61). CSF analyses had lower diagnostic

 accuracy, whether using red blood cell (RBC) count or xanthochromia. At a threshold RBC count of
1,000 9 106/L, the LR+ was 5.7 (95% CI = 1.4 to 23) and LR� was 0.21 (95% CI = 0.03 to 1.7). Using the
pooled estimates of diagnostic accuracy and testing risks and benefits, we estimate that LP only benefits
CT-negative patients when the pre-LP probability of SAH is on the order of 5%, which corresponds to a
pre-CT probability greater than 20%.
Conclusions: Less than one in 10 headache patients concerning for SAH are ultimately diagnosed with
SAH in recent studies. While certain symptoms and signs increase or decrease the likelihood of SAH, no
single characteristic is sufficient to rule in or rule out SAH. Within 6 hours of symptom onset,
noncontrast cranial CT is highly accurate, while a negative CT beyond 6 hours substantially reduces the
likelihood of SAH. LP appears to benefit relatively few patients within a narrow pretest probability range.
With improvements in CT technology and an expanding body of evidence, test thresholds for LP may
become more precise, obviating the need for a post-CT LP in more acute headache patients. Existing
SAH clinical decision rules await external validation, but offer the potential to identify subsets most likely
to benefit from post-CT LP, angiography, or no further testing.

H
eadache is a common presenting complaint to
the emergency department (ED) and represents
approximately 2% of ED visits annually in the
United States.1 While most headaches are self-limiting,
the possibility of spontaneous subarachnoid hemor-
rhage (SAH) is an important diagnostic consideration in
patients presenting with a sudden, severe headache.
These
sudden-onset
headaches
include
the
classic
“thunderclap headache” that instantaneously peaks at
headache onset, as well as headaches that reach maxi-
mal severity within seconds to 1 hour of onset. Sudden-
onset headaches include a wide spectrum of possible
diagnoses, including SAH (approximately 1% of acute
headaches), benign postcoital headache, exertional head-
ache, intracranial cysts or tumors, intracerebral hemor-
rhage, hypophyseal apoplexy, sphenoid sinusitis, sinus
thrombosis, cough-related headache, vascular dissection,
cerebral
vasospasm,
and
migraine
headaches.2–10
Migraine and other more benign headaches mimic SAH
and are estimated to be at least 50 times more common
than SAH.11 Moreover, while SAH is often caused by a
ruptured cerebral aneurysm and represents a neurosur-
gical emergency, a variety of other SAH etiologies range
from the benign, low-pressure perimesencephalic hem-
orrhage, which can be treated conservatively,12,13 to vas-
cular malformations, arterial dissection, and vasculitis,
which require time-sensitive interventions (Table 1).14
Thus,
the
diagnostic
approach
to
acute
headache
epitomizes the practice of emergency medicine with a
high-stakes condition without a clear-cut presentation
lurking within a high-volume complaint, and ultimately
most patients do not have a serious diagnosis.
Between 1960 and 1995, the 6-month mortality of
aneurysmal SAH decreased by 15%,15 but mortality
remains 27%–44% with substantial regional variabil-
ity.16 Up to 25% of patients die within 24 hours, and the
3-month mortality rate can be as high as 50% without
early definitive treatment.17 In addition, one-third of
SAH survivors suffer neurologic deficits affecting their
daily lives15 and up to 50% never return to work.18
Early detection and treatment can significantly reduce
morbidity and mortality.11,19 However, SAH can be a
challenging diagnosis to make, particularly in alert, neu-
rologically
intact
adults.20
Missed
diagnosis
is
the
primary reason for delayed treatment and case series
suggest that 12%–53% of SAH cases are misdiagnosed
on their initial presentation in a variety of settings,
including the ED.21 Patients with misdiagnosed or undi-
agnosed warning bleeds that subsequently rebleed have
a 70% mortality.22–25 ED providers miss the diagnosis of
SAH in about 5% of cases, primarily those with lower
acuity at presentation and misdiagnosis is estimated to
be more likely in nonteaching hospitals.26,27 Most emer-
gency medicine and neurosurgery textbooks provide
limited guidance on the diagnostic accuracy and utility
of history, physical examination, cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF)
analysis,
or
computed
tomography
(CT)
for
the diagnosis of SAH.28,29 Indeed, given the serious nat-
ure of the condition, few have proposed a sensible
threshold below which testing is not necessary, which
contributes to overtesting and the unintended conse-
quences that include incidental findings with prolonged
patient uncertainty.30
Unenhanced cranial CT is usually the first-line diag-
nostic test to evaluate for suspected SAH. Because
early-generation CTs did not detect up to 5% of SAHs,
traditional teaching has emphasized the need to per-
form lumbar puncture (LP) to exclude SAH to reduce
the probability of error. Yet many patients fear having
an LP because an LP is painful and invasive and can
lead to a post-LP headache in 6%–30% of patients

 depending on the gauge of the LP needle.31 Additional
clinician-level barriers to LP testing include the time
needed to perform32 and low diagnostic yield.20,33–36 In
addition, LP may be contraindicated if a patient has a
bleeding disorder or increased intracranial pressure or
simply does not consent to the procedure.37 Despite
dogma, LP is not always performed after CT and multi-
center observational studies report that fewer than half
of acute headache patients undergo LP following a neg-
ative CT to “rule out” SAH. Even in these studies less
than one in 100 LPs are ultimately deemed “true posi-
tives” after negative CT using a third-generation scan-
ner.38,39 Additionally, the specificity of LP is reduced by
“traumatic taps” in which bleeding from the procedure
contaminates the CSF being collected, estimated to
occur in about one in six LPs.40 Identifying xanthochro-
mia due to the breakdown of hemoglobin in CSF is con-
sidered
to
be
pathognomonic
for
SAH,
yet
xanthochromia requires up to 12 hours to develop and
is prone to false positives due to ex vivo hemolysis or
hyperbilirubinemia.21,41 National guidelines in the Uni-
ted
Kingdom
advocate
using
spectrophotometry
to
identify xanthochromia, yet nearly all North American
hospitals rely on visual inspection alone.42 A recent sys-
tematic review comparing visual inspection to spec-
trophotometry to detect CSF xanthochromia was unable
to draw a conclusion due to significant heterogeneity in
the underlying studies.43
To our knowledge, there are no prior systematic
reviews assessing the diagnostic accuracy of history,
physical examination, and imaging studies for SAH in
the setting of acute-onset headache patients in the ED.
Therefore, we set out to collect and summarize the
available published literature regarding these charac-
teristics as well as LP findings and clinical decision
rules for spontaneous (nontraumatic) SAH. Since recent
systematic
reviews
have
evaluated
CT
angiography
(CTA)44 and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA),45
we
did
not
repeat
these
meta-analyses.
However,
additional
studies
exploring
visible
xanthochromia
diagnostic accuracy have been published since the 2014
systematic review by Chu et al.43 so we report an
updated meta-analysis of visible xanthochromia. We
also used these diagnostic accuracy estimates to delin-
eate an optimal diagnostic strategy using the test–treat-
ment threshold approach of Pauker and Kassirer.46,47
In particular, we used the graphical Bayesian approach
of test indication curves first proposed by Bernstein48
to identify the a priori likelihood of disease in patients
for whom LP would be rational despite a negative
cranial CT.
METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
original research studies that reported data on the diag-
nosis of SAH in ED patients with acute headache. The
design and manuscript structure conform to the recom-
mendations from the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)49 and
the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies (MOOSE)
criteria.50 Studies were included if they described adult
patients (14 years or older) seen in an ED with acute
headache or other symptoms or signs (such as syncope,
acute mental status change, or otherwise unexplained
nausea) and in whom SAH was a diagnostic considera-
tion. In addition, studies had to report sufficient detail
on the diagnostic test and criterion standard to be able
to construct two-by-two tables. We elected to define
“disease positive” as being an acute SAH including
nonaneurysmal SAH (e.g., perimesencepahlic hemor-
rhage) as most original studies did not distinguish
between SAH subtypes. We recognized that CT findings
of subarachnoid blood were therefore incorporated into
this definition, thereby inflating CT sensitivity, speci-
ficity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and negative likeli-
hood ratio (LR�; incorporation bias), but report these
estimates for completeness.51 Recognizing the absence
of an accepted definition for a positive LP, we analyzed
separately an erythrocyte count above 1,000 9 106/L in
the final tube as well as either visible or spectrophoto-
metric xanthochromia. Patients with negative imaging
in whom LP was not performed were deemed as “dis-
ease negative” only when the authors reported effort at
follow-up after hospital discharge. We excluded studies
that solely reported data on patients with SAH (i.e.,
where only sensitivity could be calculated), precluding
an estimate of specificity or LRs.
Search Strategy
We searched the published literature using strategies
created for the concepts of emergency department,
headache, subarachnoid hemorrhage, physical exam,
and diagnostic accuracy. Search strategies were estab-
lished using a combination of standardized terms and
keywords and were implemented in PubMed 1946–,
Embase 1947–, and Scopus 1823–. All searches were
completed in June 2015 and limited to English using
database
supplied
limits.

strategies
for
PubMed and Embase are provided in the Data Supple-
ment S1 (available as supporting information in the
online version of this paper). One author (AMH) inde-
pendently reviewed the titles and abstracts to identify
potentially relevant articles. Where there were questions
about
inclusion,
this
was
discussed
with
a
second
author (JMP) and a consensus decision was made about
whether the article should be included for full-text
review. Studies deemed not to contain clear inclusion or
exclusion criteria were evaluated by a second author
(JMP) before final inclusion or exclusion.
Data from each study were independently abstracted
by two authors (AMH, CRC). Information abstracted
included the individual study setting, inclusion criteria,
exclusion criteria, specific CT (machine, slice number,
and type of CT image), definition of disease, criteria for
a positive LP, follow-up description, and whether or not
there was neurosurgical intervention. The abstracted
data were constructed into tables, which were con-
firmed by a second author (CRC); any uncertainty was
discussed between the two authors and a consensus
decision was made. In addition, the references for each
full-text article were reviewed to assess whether addi-
tional studies could be included in the review, which
were then assessed by full-text review. The authors con-

Individual Evidence Quality Appraisal
Two
authors
(AMH,
MJW)
independently
used
the
Quality
Assessment
Tool
for
Diagnostic
Accuracy
Studies (QUADAS-2)52 for systematic reviews to evalu-
ate the quality of evidence for the studies identified.
These two authors used several a priori conditions to
evaluate an individual study’s risk of bias and degree of
applicability.
•
In
the
assessment
of
“inappropriate
exclusions”
reviewers assessed whether a study’s inclusion and
exclusion criteria led investigators to evaluate sus-
pected SAH patients who were more or less acutely
ill than those typically evaluated in ED settings,
which could introduce spectrum bias51 or spectrum
effect53 and skew observed estimates of sensitivity
(with sicker populations) or specificity (with less sick
populations) upward.
•
If the study setting was anything other than an ED
(for example, a neurosurgery clinic) then the results
were assessed as “low applicability.”
•
In the assessment of continuous data like CSF red
blood
cells
(RBCs),
if
the
authors
predefined
a
threshold
for
abnormal
(example,
CSF
RBC > 5 9 106 cells/L in the last tube is “abnormal”)
then the study results were assessed as “low risk” of
bias.
•
If the conduct of the index test differed from routine
care (example, xanthochromia assessed using only
spectrophotometry), then the results were assessed
as “low applicability.”
•
No widely accepted criterion standard for SAH yet
exists, so we accepted the criterion standard of sub-
arachnoid blood on unenhanced CT of the head,
CSF xanthochromia, or CSF RBCs > 5 9 106/L in the
final sample of CSF when any of these findings
included an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation
evident
on
cerebral
angiography,
as
previously
established
by
a
consensus
panel
of
emergency
physicians
and
a
neurosurgeon.39,54
If
less
than
100%
of
a
study’s
subjects
underwent
cerebral
angiography, a surrogate outcome of medical record
review and structured telephone follow-up of at least
6-months were necessary.20 Any other criterion stan-
dard was assessed as “high risk” for bias.
•
Assessing whether the target condition is identified
is challenging in SAH diagnostic research. The ideal
patient-centric diagnostic test would identify SAH
patients
with
a
lesion
amenable
to
surgical
or
endovascular
intervention
rendering
measurable
benefit in mortality and morbidity.55 Since perimes-
encephalic bleeds cause about 10% of SAH cases yet
require no intervention other than symptom control,
diagnostic studies that report aneurysmal SAH sepa-
rately from perimesencephalic SAH would provide a
higher level of evidence by which to associate testing
with patient benefit. Unfortunately, few SAH studies
report
aneurysmal
versus
nonaneurysmal
SAH
separately, so the decision was made that any SAH
identified using an acceptable criterion standard as
defined above would be assessed as “high applicabil-
ity.”
•
In assessing the uniformity of the criterion standard
reported, if all patients with nondiagnostic CT and
LP had either subsequent advanced imaging (angiog-
raphy) or post-ED follow-up, then the risk of differ-
ential
verification
bias
was
assessed
as
being
“low.”51
•
If a substantial number of patients were reported lost
to follow-up and no sensitivity analysis assuming
worst-case scenario (lost to follow-up = false-nega-
tive SAH index test), then the risk of bias was
assessed to be “high.”
Inter-rater QUADAS-2 reliability was assessed using
prevalence-adjusted,
bias-adjusted
kappa
values
to
adjust for unique biases between reviewers and the dis-
tribution of responses across categories.56 Discrepan-
cies were then resolved by consensus.
Data Collection
We abstracted the study setting, study inclusion criteria,
the criterion standard employed to diagnose SAH, CT
technology,
CSF
analysis,
follow-up
procedures
in
patients who did not undergo both CT and LP, disease
prevalence, and every variable on history, physical, or
testing for which a 2 9 2 diagnostic accuracy table
could be constructed. When reconstructed 2 9 2 contin-
gency tables differed from the original investigators’
reports of sensitivity and specificity, we contacted the
authors for clarity.
Data Analysis
Meta-analysis estimates were computed by one author
(CRC) when ≥1 studies assessed the same finding on
history or physical examination or index testing. We
chose to combine unenhanced cranial CT studies with-
out distinguishing specific generations of technology
since the detector number or geometry and the thick-
ness of slices were frequently not specified. We gener-
ated combined estimates for diagnostic accuracy using
a
random-effects
model
(Meta-DiSc
Version
1.4,
Hospital Universitario Ram�
on y Cajal).57,58 Interstudy
heterogeneity was assessed using the Der-Simonian-
Laird random effects model and the index of inconsis-
tency (I2).59,60 Pooled estimates of dichotomous LR+
and LR� are also reported from the random-effects
model. Publication bias was not assessed because this
is not an accepted approach in diagnostic meta-ana-
lyses due to the small number of studies generally
identified.61
The added value of LRs over positive and negative
predictive values is that likelihood ratios are indepen-
dent of disease prevalence.62 In addition, LRs can be
used on an individual patient to estimate posttest proba-
bilities, unlike sensitivity and specificity.63 Larger LR+
increase the posttest probability of a disease more than
smaller values of LR+; similarly, smaller LR� decrease
the posttest probability of a disease more than larger
values of LR�. Note that a LR of 1 does not change the
posttest probability at all. One rule of thumb is that
966
Carpenter et al. • SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE EVIDENCE-BASED DIAGNOSTICS
 LR+ > 10 and LR� < 0.1 provide considerable diagnostic
value.64
Test–Treatment Threshold
We
used
the
Pauker-Kassirer
method
to
estimate
thresholds
for
further
testing
or
treatment.47
This
technique is based on the diagnostic accuracy of a
test, as well as the estimated risks of testing and of
treatment, and the anticipated benefit of treatment.
We performed a separate analysis for each of the two
primary tests in question, namely, cranial CT (strati-
fied
by
time
post–headache
onset)
and
LP
(using
either CSF RBC or visible xanthochromia to define
“positive LP”). We used the pooled estimates from the
meta-analysis for test sensitivity and specificity and
our collective clinical experience and selected refer-
ences to estimate risks and benefits. We extended the
test indication curve method first proposed by Bern-
stein48 to visually represent this analysis. Specifically,
the curves display how the information conveyed by a
positive or negative test result affects a given patient’s
posttest probability of disease relative to the treatment
threshold. These test indication curves were originally
developed to illustrate the pretest probability at which
testing is no longer indicated based only on the net
utilities of treating or not treating patients with and
without
disease.46
We
extended
this
graphical
approach to incorporate the nonzero risks of testing,
which necessarily narrow the range of probabilities
for which testing remains rational.47,65 Because the
precise utilities of both testing and treatment are diffi-
cult to estimate on a common scale, we performed
sensitivity analyses by doubling and halving the calcu-
lated treatment threshold (i.e., the ratio of risks of
treatment to the sum of risks and benefits)48 and also
by
reducing
the
risk
of
testing
by
half
and
recalculating
the
test
thresholds.
Recognizing
that
these estimates are nevertheless somewhat arbitrary,
we also provide an interactive calculator to permit
readers to recompute thresholds using different esti-
mates of test performance or anticipated risks and
benefits that may be more applicable to the end-users’
patient
populations
and
clinical
environments
(Data
Supplement S3, available as supporting information in
the online version of this paper).
In developing the test–treatment threshold, we were
most interested in the common clinical dilemma of
whether to perform LP after a negative cranial CT or
to
forgo
LP
and
proceed
directly
to
angiography.
Because
CT-positive
or
LP-positive
patients
do
not
immediately
undergo
neurosurgical
clipping
or
endovascular coiling, the next step being contemplated
is usually angiography, typically by CT or MRA (and
sometimes by digital subtraction fluoroscopy), followed
by intervention when a culprit aneurysm is identified.
Therefore,
for
Pauker-Kassirer
modeling
we
desig-
nated the “test” of interest as being either the unen-
hanced CT or the LP and the “treatment” as being
angiography. Furthermore, because an LP is usually
done after a negative CT, we considered how a nega-
tive unenhanced cranial CT would affect the post-CT
(i.e., pre-LP) probability of still having a SAH across
the range of pre-CT probabilities.

 and alert patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score
of 15, some also included those with decreased level
of
consciousness,
which
could
introduce
spectrum
effect into observed estimates of diagnostic accuracy.
All
studies
were
conducted
in
North
American
or
European countries. Each study included the presence
of subarachnoid blood on unenhanced cranial CT as
representing
“disease
positive.”
Descriptors
of
the
specific technology utilized for CT scanners and spec-
trophotometric
assessment
for
CSF
xanthochromia
were inconsistent. Definitions of xanthochromia ran-
ged from direct visual inspection to spectrophotomet-
ric analysis. When using spectrophotometry, studies
varied
with
regards
to
wavelengths
sampled
and
specific algorithms used to adjust for interference by
oxyhemoglobin, protein, and other corrections. Clinical
follow-up
proportion
varied
considerably,
ranging
from no follow-up to complete follow-up with cross-
checking
of
coroner
records
to
ensure
no
missed
deaths. Assessment of studies by QUADAS-2 (Table 3)
showed
significant
heterogeneity
in
reference
stan-
dards used, blinding of index test interpreters to the
reference
standard,
and
vice
versa.
Agreement
between reviewers was fair for all QUADAS-2 ele-
ments except for index and reference standard blind-
ing,
reference
standard
appropriateness,
and
acceptable application of index test in which cases the
agreement was poor.66 However, most studies had a
relatively low risk of biases overall.
Prevalence
The overall prevalence of SAH in these studies ranged
from 0.91% to 68%. In prospective studies within the
past 10 years, the prevalence ranged from 0.91% to

974
Carpenter et al. • SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE EVIDENCE-BASED DIAGNOSTICS
 17% with a weighted average of 7.5%. Two of the stud-
ies with the lowest prevalence enrolled patients under-
going LP following a negative CT.67,68
History and Physical Examination
Eight studies described the diagnostic accuracy for 22
components
of
history2,17,33,38,39,69–71
(Table 4
and
Figure 2) and six studies described the diagnostic accu-
racy for four physical examination tests2,17,69,70 (Table 4
and Figure 3) for SAH. Within these studies there was
significant heterogeneity in the manner in which history
and physical characteristics were obtained and defined.
For example, Perry et al.39 defined limited neck flexion
on physical examination as “inability to touch chin to
chest or raise the head 8 cm off the bed if supine,”
whereas Carstairs et al.17 provided no descriptor of how
“nuchal rigidity” was objectively assessed on physical
examination. Perry et al.39 reported the interphysician
reliability of elements of the history and physical exami-
nation, with kappa (j) values ranging from 0.44 to 1.00.
The least reliable findings were thunderclap headache
(j = 0.49) and limited neck flexion (j = 0.44).
No single element of history had a very high pooled
LR+. The findings on history that increased the proba-
bility of SAH the most included subjective neck stiffness
(LR+ = 4.12, 95% CI = 2.24 to 7.59), while the absence of
“worst headache of life” (LR� = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.01 to
14.22) or onset of headache over more than 1 hour
(LR� = 0.06, 95% CI = 0 to 0.95) each reduced the prob-
ability of SAH.
On physical examination, neck stiffness (LR+ = 6.59,
95% CI = 3.95–11.00) was strongly associated with SAH
as reported in three studies, but no single physical
examination finding had a LR� less than 0.74. Most ele-
ments of history
and physical
examination
demon-
strated significant statistical heterogeneity.

 Clinical Decision Rules
Four related SAH clinical decision rules have been
described, three of which were prospectively validated
in a subsequent study by the same investigator group to
generate the final refined Ottawa SAH Rule. Since more
than one study is needed to perform a meta-analysis,
we were unable to pool diagnostic accuracy results for
SAH Clinical Decision Rules. The component elements
of each decision rule, along with their combined accu-
racy and reliability are available in Data Supplement S2
(available as supporting information in the online ver-
sion of this paper). Rule 1 appears sufficient to rule out
SAH (LR� = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01–0.22), was uncomfort-
able to use for only 18% of surveyed emergency physi-
cians, was misinterpreted in 4.7% of cases, and would
theoretically decrease CT and/or LP testing rates from
Burst or Explode at Onset

Carpenter et al. • SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE EVIDENCE-BASED DIAGNOSTICS
 84% to 74%. On the other hand, the Ottawa SAH Rule
more
accurately
rules
out
SAH
(LR� = 0.02,
95%
CI = 0.00–0.39), but could increase CT and/or LP testing
rates if strictly applied.39
Advanced Imaging
Five studies examined the diagnostic accuracy of non-
contrast CT (Figure 4).20,72–75 The pooled estimate for
sensitivity was 94% (95% CI - 91% to 96%, I2 = 74%)
and LR� was 0.07 (95% CI = 0.03 to 0.17, I2 = 78%). van
der Wee et al.72 assessed CT accuracy at 12 hours, but
did not provide sufficient data to reconstruct 2 9 2
tables stratified by that time threshold. Three other
studies reported diagnostic accuracy stratified by the
time
interval
since
symptom
onset,
but
only
two
reported
the
threshold
of
less
than
6 hours.20,70,75
Pooled sensitivity within the first 6 hours of symptom
onset was 100% (95% CI = 98% to 100%, I2 = 0%) and
LR� was 0.01 (95% CI = 0 to 0.04, I2 = 0%). Beyond
6 hours the pooled sensitivity of CT was 89% (95%
CI = 83% to 93%, I2 = 89%) and LR� was 0.07 (95%
CI = 0.01 to 0.61, I2 = 63%).
CSF Erythrocytes and Xanthochromia
Six
studies
examined
diagnostic
accuracy
of
xan-
throchromia on CSF analysis, but investigators used
variable methods to assess xanthochromia ranging from
visible inspection33,67,68,76 to multiple different spec-
trophotometric assays (Table 5, Figure 5).34,67,68,77 For
visible xanthochromia the pooled meta-analysis results
were as follows: sensitivity was 85% (95% CI = 66% to
96%, I2 = 0%), specificity as 97% (95% CI = 96% to
98%, I2 = 13%), LR+ was 24.67 (95% CI = 12.13 to 50.14,
I2 = 64%), and LR� was 0.22 (95% CI = 0.09 to 0.54,
I2 = 13%). Both Perry and Gangloff evaluated spec-
trophotometric bilirubin using the U.K. National Exter-
nal

 CI = 59% to 100%, I2 = 0%), specificity of 95% (95%
CI = 93% to 96%, I2 = 98%), LR+ of 15.23 (95% CI = 1.58
to 146.73, I2 = 96%), and LR� of 0.13 (95% CI = 0.02 to
0.83, I2 = 0%).67,68 The diagnostic accuracies of other
spectrophotometric methods to evaluate for CSF biliru-
bin are also summarized in Table 5.
Two studies evaluated CSF erythrocyte counts to dis-
tinguish a traumatic LP from an aneurysmal SAH. Perry
et al.79 noted a sensitivity of 93% (95% CI = 68% to
100%), specificity of 91% (95% CI = 88% to 93%), LR+
of 10.25 (95% CI = 7.7 to 13.6), and LR� of 0.07 (95%
CI = 0.01 to 0.49) at a threshold CSF RBC < 2,000 9 106/
L in the final tube of CSF collected. Czuczman et al.33
reported interval likelihood ratios (iLR)80 for CSF RBC
counts in the final tube collected (using units of cells/

Test–Treatment Threshold
The risks of treatment (designated Rrx by Pauker and
Kassirer47) were primarily those ascribed to angiogra-
phy itself and not those of eventual neurosurgical inter-
vention. These risks included additional exposure to
ionizing radiation and to contrast, the risks of vascular
access and allergic reactions, and the remote risk of

 stroke or other end-organ damage. The lifetime risk of
malignancy secondary to exposure to ionizing radiation
is a function of dose and age; an adult is typically
exposed to 20 mGy radiation during cranial CT. Using
an average lifetime cancer risk attributable to such an
exposure of almost 1%,81 we deemed the total risks
related to angiography to be relatively low at 0.02.
When considering the benefits of treatment (Brx), we
considered
primarily
the
benefits
of
treating
an
aneurysmal SAH. Overall, SAH has 12% mortality prior
to arrival in the ED and 40% in-hospital mortality at
1 month despite treatment. In addition, one-third of sur-
vivors
suffer
a
severe
neurologic
deficit.82,83
Neurosurgical and interventional radiology treatment
options include clipping and coiling the culprit aneur-
ysm when present, with several large randomized trials
reporting long-term poor outcomes in up to 35% of
treated subjects.84–86 The long-term benefits of early
diagnosis and treatment in the subset of patients who
present awake and neurologically intact are not well
characterized but presumably somewhat better, so we
assigned an optimistic overall treatment benefit (Brx) of
0.8 with immediate diagnosis.
For LP we considered the common morbidity of a
postdural puncture headache, discomfort, and remote
risks of infection and assigned a test risk (Rt) of 0.01.

 The testing thresholds from these estimates of potential
risk and potential benefit are depicted in Figure 7. The
thresholds bracketing indifference between LP versus
either no further testing (Ttest) or angiography (Ttreat)
were very narrow, suggesting that LP should only be
considered
for
patients
with
a
pre-LP
probability
between 2 and 7% (when using visible xanthochromia)
or between 2 and 4% (when using CSF erythrocyte
count). Lower-risk patients need no further testing and
avoid
LP,
while
higher-risk
patients
benefit
from
angiography and again avoid LP.
Of
note,
these
rather
narrow
pre-LP
probability
bands correspond to the post-CT disease probability,
not the original estimate based on history and physical
examination (i.e., not the pre-CT estimate). In other
words, one should take the pre-CT probability estimate
and incorporate the information gained from a nega-
tive CT in a Bayesian fashion. The impact of a negative
CT on the post-CT (i.e., pre-LP) probability is also
shown in Figure 7, depending on the interval between
headache onset and imaging. Thus, a pre-LP probabil-
ity of 2% to 7% represents a pre-CT prior probability

and
over

The
sensitivity
analyses
showed
that
these
estimates
were
stable
across
a
range of utilities and were primarily influenced by the
diagnostic accuracy of the tests being considered, as
illustrated in the figures. When the risks of testing (LP)
were allowed to approach the risks of treatment (an-
giography), then LP was no longer indicated at any
pretest probability. Table 6 provides an example illus-
trating how to use test indication curves for diagnostic
decision-making.
DISCUSSION
The results of this systematic review demonstrate that
neither the presence nor the absence of commonly cited
SAH risk factors from history and physical examination
accurately rule in or rule out this potentially lethal diag-
nosis. Specifically, no single history or physical exami-
nation
finding
significantly
increases
(LR+ > 10)
or
decreases (LR� < 0.1) the posttest probability of SAH
for severe headaches that peak within 1 hour of onset.
In addition, many elements of history and physical
examination

the headache as “thunderclap” being one of the least
reproducible findings.39 Nonetheless, many physicians
would prefer to never miss a SAH, and missed SAH
remains an important cause of litigation in emergency
medicine.23,87

(20%) of SAH cases despite cranial CT within 6 hours.89

demonstrated

sensitivity
(95%
CI = 97.6%

100%) using the combination of negative cranial CT and
all negative responses on the Ottawa SAH Rule.90 How-
ever, validating a clinical decision rule retrospectively is
suboptimal since all components of the rule may not be
recorded in the medical records and whether to code
missing variables as unknown or not present is fre-
quently a question.91 In the retrospective validation of
Rule 1, the “onset during exertion” variable was missing
in one-third of patients.92 Therefore, these instruments
should ideally undergo prospective validation in different
settings before widespread adoption (J. J. Perry et al.,

 Unenhanced CT remains the first-line imaging test in

headache
patients
with
suspected
spontaneous
SAH. Within 6 hours of headache onset, CT demon-
strates sufficient accuracy to rule in or to rule out SAH,
notwithstanding
the
heterogeneity
of
the
estimated
specificity and LR+ of the two studies identified. Beyond
6 hours the estimated LR� (95% CI = 0.01 to 0.61) and
sensitivity (95% CI = 83% to 93%) become less precise
and concerns regarding heterogeneity (I2 = 89% and
I2 = 63%, respectively) allow the interpretation that the
accuracy of cranial CT to rule out SAH could range
from very good (LR� = 0.01) to unhelpful (LR� = 0.61)
taking the extremes of the 95% CI. Therefore, the timing
of CT relative to symptom onset has remained an
important
qualifier
when
estimating
the
diagnostic
accuracy of the CT. Of course, CT can identify other
causes of headache or other abnormalities and similarly
can miss SAH due to cervical arteriovenous malforma-
tions.75 Some researchers in the field stipulate that the
CT should be interpreted by an experienced neuroradi-
ologist, although recent research indicates that radiolo-
gists at nonacademic centers may be equally adept.35
Despite advances in CT imaging, substantial debate
persists surrounding the necessity of LP following a
negative head CT, particularly within the first 6 hours
after onset of headache.93–97 While CSF can provide

 crucial diagnostic information for alternative etiologies
of headache like meningitis, it remains an imperfect test
for SAH. Traumatic (blood-contaminated) LPs occur in
one of six cases.40 Xanthochromia takes many hours to
develop and is variably defined. In addition, post-LP
headaches are common31,98 despite increasing use of
smaller-gauge, atraumatic spinal needles and reinsert-
ing the stylet before needle removal.32 Other potential
complications include low back pain, brainstem hernia-
tion, iatrogenic infection, epidural nerve injury, and
spinal hemorrhage.99,100 These factors combined with
patients’ negative bias against the procedure and the
physician time needed help explain emergency physi-
cians’ reluctance to pursue LP despite a long-held belief
that this procedure was mandatory in the setting of sus-
pected SAH.101–104 Our analysis provides new insight
Vomiting

986
Carpenter et al. • SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE EVIDENCE-BASED DIAGNOSTICS
 into the limited utility of performing LP to rule out SAH
after a negative CT. We found that, by incorporating
the risks and benefits of both testing and continued
investigation into the decision analysis, the benefits of
LP are unlikely to outweigh the harm across a wide
range of reasonable estimates of pretest disease preva-
lence and given the limited diagnostic accuracy of the
CSF analysis.
Brunell et al.34 noted that LP provided an alternative
diagnosis in 3% of suspected SAH cases, but only
altered subsequent management in 0.44% of individuals
who had an LP. This equates to 227 LPs (1/0.0044) to
identify one central nervous system infection requiring
antibiotics in suspected SAH patients. In addition, using
spectrophotometry, Brunell et al. noted five additional
cases of SAH representing 1.1% of LPs and a number
needed to LP (NNLP) of 91 (1/0.011) to identify one addi-
tional SAH. Of note, none of these additional cases of
“SAH” were aneurysmal, and none underwent subse-
quent surgery; thus the NNLP approaches infinity for
detecting SAH that might benefit from intervention.
Perry et al. reported 17/1546 false-negative CTs (with
postheadache
onset
imaging
delays
ranging
from
8 hours to 8 days) that were identified by LP obtained
at the discretion of the attending emergency physi-
cian.20 However, only six of these individuals underwent
neurosurgical intervention (ventricular drain, aneurysm
coiling, or clipping), which equates to a NNLP = 258 (6/
1546 = 0.38%, 1/0.0038 = 258) to identify one aneurysm
amenable to neurosurgical intervention following a neg-
ative cranial CT. Sayer et al.36 reported NNLP = 250 to
identify one additional aneurysmal SAH. Blok et al.35

 identified one perimesencephalic bleed among 760 CT-
negative
patients
with

aneurysmal
SAH,
which they extrapolated to NNLP = 15,200 to identify
one additional aneurysmal SAH given that one in 20
perimesencephalic bleeds are ultimately linked to an
aneurysm (760 9 20 = 15,200).105–107
Another approach to more definitively rule out SAH
after a nondiagnostic, noncontrast CT is to proceed to
CTA without an LP, an approach that 75% of patients
favored in one survey108,109 and supporting a role for

decision-making
in
evaluation
of
suspected
SAH.110 Some physicians have even advocated for pre-
discharge CTA after a nondiagnostic CT and LP. Car-
stairs et al.17 examined CTA in addition to traditional
noncontrast CT. Patients who were CT negative and LP
negative underwent CTA to more definitively identify
either SAH or cerebral aneurysm. After evaluating 103
CT-negative/LP-negative
patients,
they
detected
two
cerebral aneurysms, which equates to a number needed
to CTA (NNCTA) = 52 to detect one cerebral aneurysm
that might or might not be the cause of the presenting
headache
(2/103 = 1.9%,
1/0.019 = 52).

pletely safe, nor always clinically meaningful. CTA com-

to

Carstairs et al. interpreted the presence of cerebral
aneurysm by CTA to be equivalent to being disease pos-
itive for SAH, despite being unable to establish whether
the aneurysm was the etiology of the patient’s headache
or an incidental finding.
Indeed, intracranial saccular or berry aneurysms are
common, occurring in 1%–2% of the population.113
Linking a nonruptured aneurysm detected via CTA to
an individual patient’s headache is problematic. The dis-
covery of an aneurysm in the context of headache is
often considered to be a symptomatic aneurysm, and
neurosurgical intervention may be advised depending
on aneurysm size, location, and specific patient charac-
teristics.114 However, the relative risk of rupture for
cerebral aneurysms detected in symptomatic individuals
is eightfold higher than the rupture rate in asymp-
tomatic
individuals
with

noted
cerebral
aneurysms.115 Based on one recent meta-analysis of 50

can also be utilized to detect intracranial aneurysm, with
pooled sensitivity and specificity of 95 and 89%, respec-
tively. Although MRA is more time-consuming and gen-
erally less available from the ED, it may be useful in

Given the risks of overinvestigation and incidental
findings, it is important to scrutinize the testing thresh-
olds for CT, LP, and angiography. We found that only
patients with a pre-CT likelihood of SAH well above
20% were likely to benefit from an LP after a negative
unenhanced CT. Such pre-CT probabilities are excep-
tionally high and are far higher than the average diag-
nostic yield of around 5% for SAH on initial CT. The
limited ability of any feature on history or physical
examination to identify SAH also renders such high
pre-CT probabilities unlikely, except for severe cases
likely to have extensive bleeding visible on CT. More-
over, patients with only slightly higher pre-CT probabil-
ities benefit more from angiography than LP, given the
Neck stiffness, objective

Carpenter et al. • SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE EVIDENCE-BASED DIAGNOSTICS
 limitations of CSF analysis. Accordingly, this analysis
suggests that LP after a negative CT to “rule out” SAH
no longer seems rational for the large majority of
patients.
The
utilitarian
approach
to
decision-making
test
thresholds is considered by some too arbitrary or artifi-
cial, yet it is critically important to recognize how to
apply these analyses at the bedside. The separation
between the test-positive and test-negative curves are a
visual representation of the diagnostic performance of
the test and thus illustrate the summary findings from
this meta-analysis. The vertical location of the horizontal
line that is used to calculate the test thresholds where it
intersects
each
curve
is
determined
by
the
ratio
between benefits and risks of further treatment and can
easily be shifted up or down to visually estimate new
thresholds on the graph. We used a 40:1 ratio of the
benefits:risk of angiography, but allowed this to range
from 20:1 to 80:1 in a sensitivity analysis and obtained
similar findings. We extended this graphical approach
to include the nonzero risks of testing, as illustrated by
a narrowing of the range of pretest probabilities for
which the test is beneficial. We selected a test:treatment
risk of 1:4 for CT and 1:2 for LP compared to angiogra-
phy, but reduced the risk by half in another sensitivity
analysis with again similar findings.
Yet the most compelling argument in support of this
analysis is that the findings are strikingly similar to
CT Anytime

 experienced clinicians’ own practice. Initial unenhanced
CT is rational across a wide range of pretest probabili-
ties, as low as 1%. This 1 in 100 miss rate is consistent
with surveys of emergency physicians and a threshold
used in clinical decision rule construction for SAH and
other serious conditions.38,103 On the other hand, after a
negative CT, the low LR� coupled with a low pre-CT
probability for SAH renders the post-CT probability so
low that the only moderately accurate LP is rarely war-
ranted. As such, the observed practice of forgoing LP
after a negative CT, long considered to be a pitfall in
the management of these patients, is easily justified on
Bayesian grounds, as represented graphically on the
test indication curves.
The test indication curves also help clinicians avoid
the common fallacy sometimes invoked to persuade
headache
patients
that
an
LP
is
advisable.
Many
explain a “95% sensitivity” of CT by counseling the
patient that “there is still a 1 in 20 (i.e., 100% –
95% = 5%) chance that you have a ruptured aneur-
ysm.” This is only true if the patient were certain to
have a SAH prior to the test being ordered (pretest
probability = 100%).
It
is
implausible
that
even
the
most skilled clinician can predict SAH prior to any
testing in more than one in five awake and alert
patients, the very patient in whom an informed con-
sent discussion is needed prior to LP. Our meta-analy-
sis confirms that there are few findings on history or
physical examination with a sufficiently strong associa-
tion with SAH, and clinical decision rules suffer from
modest to poor specificity precisely because of this dif-
ficulty identifying disease positive patients prior to test-
ing. Arguably, if one’s own diagnostic yield for SAH
on
initial
CT
approaches
20%
in
awake
headache
patients, one might expect one’s miss rate may be
unacceptably high. Moreover, such high-risk patients
benefit from proceeding directly to CTA especially if
the unenhanced CT cannot be done within 6 hours of
headache onset, also as indicated on the test threshold
curves. On the other hand, using a more reasonable
pre-CT probability of 1 in 10 (still higher than the 7%
prevalence
in
prospective
studies
of
emergency
patients with headache), a test with 95% sensitivity
and perfect specificity implies that the patient being

A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing CT-only, CT/
CTA, CT/LP, and CT/MRA as diagnostic modalities
found that CT-only and CT/LP are the preferred strate-
gies of diagnosing ED patients with suspected SAH.116
The CT/LP strategy was slightly more costly, but more
effective due to the LP reducing the possibility of a
missed diagnosis and subsequent harm. However, since
the results of this meta-analysis indicate a much lower
threshold for LP than used in the sensitivity analyses of
the cost-effectiveness analysis, an updated cost-effec-
tiveness
analysis
would
likely
shift
the
preference
toward a CT-only strategy by decreasing the effective-
ness of the CT/LP strategy. Further, this cost-effective-
ness analysis did not consider crowding in the ED or
physician and patient reluctance toward LP, which are
practical barriers to the implementation of a CT/LP
strategy.

Carpenter et al. • SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE EVIDENCE-BASED DIAGNOSTICS
 Implications for Future Research
LP has long been considered to be the criterion stan-
dard
for
diagnosing
SAH
as
it
may
detect
small
amounts of xanthochromia or blood in the CSF missed
by CT. Due to the advancement of multislice CT, sensi-
tivity to detect SAH has increased substantially. The pri-
mary
clinical
question
for
emergency
physicians
remains whether LP is indicated to rule out SAH if head
CT
is
negative.
Recent
literature
suggests
within
6 hours of symptom onset sensitivity of CT approaches
100%. Additional studies in heterogeneous settings (ru-
ral,
non-North
American,
community
hospitals)
are
needed to confirm this diagnostic accuracy.
The significant interstudy heterogeneity observed in
our meta-analysis indicates that more research is needed
to quantify the diagnostic accuracy of history and physi-
cal examination, as well as visible or spectrophotometric
assessment of xanthochromia for the diagnosis of SAH.
Unfortunately, few SAH studies adhere to the Standards
for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) reporting
guidelines.117 Failure to use reporting standards makes
diagnostic studies more difficult for clinicians, research-
ers, and guideline developers to locate, interpret, and
compare.118 This is reflected in the poor inter-rater relia-
bility results observed in our QUADAS-2 assessments of
blinding and appropriately reproducible conduct of the
index tests. In addition, studies that do not use the
STARD criteria are less likely to report key details neces-
sary for clinicians to understand the risk of bias and
expected skew of observed point estimates. Future diag-
nostic studies should adhere to the STARD reporting
standards117 and history/physical examination studies
should follow the STARD criteria recommended for such
studies.119
Spectrophotometric
assessment
of
xanthochromia
should
be
standardized
in
terms
of
conduct
and
reporting.78 Most studies did not obtain an LP in all
patients or report any standard follow-up protocol to
capture false-negatives. Opening pressures were only
obtained in 2% of suspected SAH cases34 and no

 studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of opening
pressures.
Future
studies
reporting
the
diagnostic
accuracy of CT should uniformly report the resolution
and timing of imaging, while incorporating post-ED
follow-up at reasonable intervals including review of
death registries for detection of false-negative results.
In addition, the volume of CSF blood and rapidity of
aneurysmal bleeding probably influence both CT and
LP test accuracy, threatening test independence implicit
in Bayesian analyses, and therefore merits assessment
for interactions. Future diagnostic researchers should
also evaluate test performance stratified by age since
aneurysmal SAH are rare in young patients. Further-
more, the skew of observed sensitivities and specifici-
ties as a result of spectrum bias, partial verification
bias, differential verification bias, and imperfect crite-
rion standard bias should be contemplated in future
studies.51

resentation of the Bayesian posttest probability (y-axis) based on either a positive (upper curved black line, with 95% CIs in gray) or
a negative (lower curved lines) test result as a function of the pretest probability (x-axis). The graphs use the same principle as the
Fagan nomogram, but provide more intuitive representations of the diagnostic accuracy of a test. The four tests considered are cra-
nial CT obtained within 6 hours (A) or later (B) from headache onset or LP with more than 1,000 9 106/L RBCs (C) or visible xan-
thochromia (D). The distances of the curves from the main diagonal of zero diagnostic information provide a visual representation
of the information gained from the test result. CT = computed tomography; LP = lumbar puncture; SAH = subarachnoid hemor-
rhage; RBCs = red blood cells.

Figure 7. Testing thresholds. Test indication curves illustrating when benefits of testing outweigh the risks for SAH. The complete
test indication curves as proposed by Bernstein are shown which incorporate the Pauker-Kassirer threshold approach to deciding
whether to perform the test in question. This technique compares the risks versus benefits for treatment (in this case proceeding to
CT or formal angiography) and calculates the corresponding treatment threshold (shown as horizontal dashed lines, with the point
estimate in black and the upper and lower bands of the sensitivity analysis in gray). The vertical dashed line (or rightmost line
when two are visible) therefore represents the pretest probability range below which the diagnostic test might be appropriate,
assuming that the test in question had neither risks nor costs; when the pretest probability is higher, empirical treatment is recom-
mended since the posttest probability exceeds this threshold even if the test is negative. Because tests have a nonzero risk, the
actual pretest range for which performing the test is rational is narrower and is shown by the thick line between the arrowheads.
The thinner solid line extending beyond the arrows illustrates the effect of reducing the test risk by half. At pretest probabilities to
the left of this range, no further testing is indicated. For example, this approach suggests proceeding directly to angiography when
the pre-CT probability exceeds 10% (B), unless the unenhanced CT can be obtained within 6 hours (A) in which case a pretest prob-
ability of nearly 70% seems appropriate before proceeding directly to angiography. On the other hand, the use of CT is warranted
even in very-low-risk patients, down to perhaps 0.7% pretest probability as determined primarily by the risks of the CT itself. The
LP curves, however, illustrate that the pre-LP probabilities that justify performing LP are very narrow, ranging from 2% to 4% in C
and 2% to 7% in D. Moreover, these pre-LP probabilities in turn can only arise after an implausibly high pre-CT probability (>>20%).
CT = computed tomography; LP = lumbar puncture; SAH = subarachnoid hemorrhage; RBCs = red blood cells.

LIMITATIONS
Identification of studies for this meta-analysis used only
one individual with adjudication of uncertainty of inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria by a second author, which could
introduce a bias in study selection. In addition, we
excluded non-English studies which could have limited
the scope of our findings and yield biased summary
estimates, although review of interventional meta-ana-
lyses do not suggest significant differences when non-
English studies are excluded.123 Of the 22 studies that
provided sufficient detail to be able to reconstruct 2 9 2
tables, there was significant heterogeneity in the man-
ner in which data were collected and reported. For
example, when examining sensitivity and specificity of
noncontrast head CT, not all studies reported the speci-
fic technology utilized. When technology utilized was
reported, it was done so in an inconsistent manner
making it unclear which generation (how many slice)
CT scanner was used. Variation in technology undoubt-
edly affects diagnostic test performance, and standard-
ized reporting of the particular technology used should
be encouraged in all future studies.117
Significant variation existed in mechanisms of follow-
up for patients that were deemed SAH-negative. Some
studies did not conduct any follow-up, while others had
structured
telephone
questionnaires
and
examined
coroner records and public death certificates to ensure
that patients deemed disease free did not later turn out
to have SAH. Without follow-up for patients that were
deemed SAH negative it is impossible to know that the
patient truly did not have a small CT-undetectable SAH
or cerebral aneurysm when they were discharged from
the ED. Finally, because some of the studies included
patients who were unconscious or had neurologic defi-
cits, the observed estimates of sensitivity and specificity
may be influenced by the spectrum of disease severity.53
There was also significant variation in definition of
disease, particularly in the incorporation of CSF find-
ings into the definition of being SAH-positive. Definition
of disease-positive ranged from number of RBCs in the
final tube via LP to xanthochromia of CSF. Number of
RBCs
was
not
standardized.
Xanthochromia
was
defined by visual inspection in some studies and spec-
trophotometry
in
others.
Xanthochromia
via
spec-
trophotometry
had
substantial
variation
in
the
absorption spectrum used to define a positive LP. Other
studies used spectrophotometry to detect bilirubin and
oxyhemoglobin as indicating a patient with SAH.
CONCLUSIONS
This meta-analysis identified a 7.5% weighted preva-
lence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in ED patients with
concerning headache. Although the available high-qual-
ity diagnostic evidence is limited, there is no single
characteristic on history or physical examination that is
adequate to rule in or rule out subarachnoid hemor-
rhage in ED settings. Using a threshold of 1,000 9 106/L
red blood cells in the final tube has a summary positive
likelihood ratio of 5.7 and negative likelihood ratio of
0.21. Within 6 hours of symptom onset, noncontrast
cranial computed tomography accurately both rules in
and rules out subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given the
risks and benefits of further testing and the limited
diagnostic accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid erythrocyte
counts and of various xanthochromia definitions, lum-
bar puncture is likely to benefit only patients within a
narrow
band
of
pre–lumbar
puncture
probabilities,
around 2% to 7%. Given the accuracy of computed
tomography, even several hours after headache onset,
such pre–lumbar puncture probabilities correspond to
pre–computed
tomography
probabilities
of
20%
or
higher. While many still consider computed tomogra-
phy followed by lumbar puncture to be the criterion
standard for the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemor-
rhage, few studies use this criterion standard given
practice patterns evolving away from routine lumbar
puncture. The role of lumbar puncture may well wane
further with improving multislice computed tomogra-
phy and increasing evidence to refute the utility of lum-
bar puncture. Validation of subarachnoid hemorrhage
clinical decision rules offers the opportunity to more
accurately risk stratify ED headache patients to identify
subsets
most
likely
to
benefit
from
post–computed
tomography lumbar puncture, computed tomography
angiography, or no further testing.

Using Test Indication Curves
You have just seen a 48-year-old housewife who presents
to the ED by private vehicle 8 hours after the onset of a
severe headache that peaked within 10 minutes of onset.
She is nauseated and complains of neck stiffness but her
neurologic examination is intact and she is able to fully
flex her neck. You assign a pretest probability of 10% for
SAH and await the final read by the neuroradiologist on
duty even though the imaging study appears to be
unremarkable to you and to the CT technician. The test–
treatment curves can be used like the Fagan nomogram to
calculate the posttest probability of disease. Therefore, you
can estimate that the posttest probability will be around
0.8% should the study prove negative (Figure 7B). You can
also estimate that, if you had performed an LP rather than
CT, the posttest likelihood would be around 2% if fewer
than 1,000 9 106/L RBCs were present in the final tube of
CSF (Figure 7C), and similarly 2% if there were no visible
xanthochromia. But you can also “chain” sequential test
results, with the usual caveat that the tests may not be
perfectly independent. Thus, after the neuroradiologist
confirms that there are no signs of SAH on the CT, the
same patient would have her probability of disease
lowered from 0.8% pre-LP to about 0.1% after an LP
negative for xanthochromia (Figure 7D). Moreover,
decision analysis would suggest that, for this patient, the
risks of LP outweigh the potential benefits, since the
pretest probability of 0.8% is already below the range
when LP is beneficial whether one uses erythrocyte count
or xanthochromia, as indicated by the horizontal arrows on
the test indication curves.
