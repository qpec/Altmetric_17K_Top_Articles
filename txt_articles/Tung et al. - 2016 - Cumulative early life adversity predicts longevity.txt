Cumulative early life adversity predicts
longevity in wild baboons

In humans and other animals, harsh circumstances in early life predict morbidity and
mortality in adulthood. Multiple adverse conditions are thought to be especially toxic, but this
hypothesis has rarely been tested in a prospective, longitudinal framework, especially in
long-lived mammals. Here we use prospective data on 196 wild female baboons to show that
cumulative early adversity predicts natural adult lifespan. Females who experience Z3
sources of early adversity die a median of 10 years earlier than females who experience r1
adverse circumstances (median lifespan is 18.5 years). Females who experience the most
adversity are also socially isolated in adulthood, suggesting that social processes partially
explain the link between early adversity and adult survival. Our results provide powerful
evidence for the developmental origins of health and disease and indicate that close ties
between early adversity and survival arise even in the absence of health habit and health
care-related explanations.

 A
dverse conditions in early life are thought to have far-
reaching implications for adult health and survival. In
humans, the strongest evidence for these effects comes
from studies that link early adversity to the risk of cardiovascular
disease, schizophrenia and type II diabetes in adulthood1–5. Such
associations may contribute to the fundamental health disparities
that arise from low socioeconomic status, child abuse and major
disasters such as war or famine1,6–9. However, the roots of early
life effects likely reach much further back in our evolutionary
history. In non-human animals, early adversity has also been
shown to predict components of fitness10–13, and in long-lived
vertebrates many studies have found a relationship between
measures of early adversity and adult fertility10,14–17.
The parallels between early life effects in humans and natural
animal populations suggest that animal models can be used to test
the generality of conceptual frameworks proposed for humans. In
humans, the cumulative adversity model argues that health and
survival inequalities begin with vulnerabilities in utero and widen
as a result of differential exposure to environmental hazards
during infancy and childhood18–20. The accumulation of adverse
conditions in the first few years of life thus sets individuals onto
distinct
biological
and
social
tracks
that
have
enduring
consequences for later life morbidity and mortality5,20,21. While
this framework is compelling, studies that test these ideas using
prospective, longitudinal data are rare. Moreover, such data have
never been used to test the cumulative effects of multiple, diverse
and directly observed environmental insults on the length of
natural adult lifespans in wild animals (prospective studies in
humans are underway, for example, refs 1,22,23).
Our objective in this study was to test the correlation between
cumulative early adversity and adult longevity in a natural
population
of
baboons,
where
long-term
observations
of
individually recognized animals provide data on the occurrence
of multiple adverse circumstances starting from birth. Our focus
on lifespan is relevant to understanding both healthy aging in
humans and sources of variance in a major component of fitness.
To investigate whether social processes contribute to the
correlation between early adversity and longevity, we also
investigated whether early adversity predicts social integration
in adulthood, a known predictor of female longevity in humans,
baboons and several other social mammals24–28. Our findings
support the idea that adverse early events act in aggregate to
profoundly influence adult survival, even in the absence of
variation in the health risk behaviours and health care access
thought to mediate these effects in humans. Specifically, females
who
experience
more
cumulative
early
adversity
have
significantly shorter adult lifespans—on the order of years—
which translates into fewer surviving offspring and lower lifetime
reproductive success. Interestingly, they are also more socially
isolated from other females as adults, but not from adult males.
Together, these results encourage renewed attention to the
evolutionary origins and mechanistic basis of the developmental
origins of health and disease.
Results
Individual sources of early adversity and adult lifespan. To test
the relationship between early life adversity and adult mortality,
we drew on data from the Amboseli baboon population in
southern Kenya. This population has been monitored con-
tinuously since 1971, when the Amboseli Baboon Research Pro-
ject began collecting data on the demography and behaviour of
individually recognized baboons on a near-daily basis. Conse-
quently, all adult females in our study (n ¼ 196; n ¼ 73 with
complete life histories) were prospectively observed since birth,
with birth dates accurate to within a few days’ error. Following
Lindstrom10, we defined ‘early life’ as the period from conception
to reproductive maturity and investigated major sources of
environmental adversity that occurred during this time period.
Because we were particularly interested in the long-term effects of
early adversity, we examined mortality risk during adulthood
(that is, after the end of the ‘early life’ period), starting at 4 years
of age, the earliest age of adulthood (females in Amboseli typically
attain menarche between 4 and 5 years29).
For each female, we considered exposure to six potential
sources of early life adversity: (1) drought in the first year of life,
which compromises female fertility30,31; (2) experienced density,
measured as group size at birth, because group size captures
competition
among
group
members
and
predicts
female
fertility30,32–34; (3) maternal dominance rank, which is linked
to growth rates and maturation timing in offspring32,33,35; (4)
maternal affiliative social connectedness, which predicts both
maternal and offspring survival24,25,36; (5) maternal loss before
age 4 years, because mothers represent a primary social resource
for their daughters, even after nutritional independence37,38; and
(6) the presence of a competing younger sibling born o1.5 years
after the female’s own birth, which may divert maternal
investment in the older focal offspring39. While some of these
sources of adversity may act through common mechanisms (for
example, food limitation), they exhibit very different structure in
our population. For example, experienced density varies across
social groups, rainfall varies temporally, and maternal social
connectedness varies among individuals within the same group
(note that the absence of reproductive seasonality in baboons
means that strong ‘cohort’ effects tend to be uncommon; because
of high levels of social and environmental variability, even within
years, individuals born close in time may have very different early
life experiences). Thus, females in our population varied in their
exposure to these risk factors, and, unlike studies of cumulative
risk in humans1,6,40, most of the risk variables were not correlated
with each other (Supplementary Table 1). Our analyses therefore
examine largely distinct effects of early adversity on adult survival
(see also Supplementary Note 1).
To test the relationship between early adversity and adult
longevity, we first constructed a Cox proportional hazards model
that modelled each source of adversity as a separate fixed effect
(hereafter called the ‘individual effects’ model). This model
explained 11% of the total variance in female longevity (Wald
test, P ¼ 3.802 � 10 � 4, n ¼ 196 females; Akaike Information
Criterion, AIC ¼ 600.74). However, of the six sources of adversity,
only maternal loss and the presence of a competing sibling were
significant (Supplementary Table 2). Adult females who lost their
mothers were three times as likely to die at every age (P ¼ 3.03
� 10 � 5, n ¼ 196 females; hazard ratio ¼ 3.01; 95% confidence
interval (CI) ¼ (1.80, 5.04); Supplementary Table 2), and females
with close-in-age younger siblings were almost twice as likely to
die at every age as females without competing siblings (P ¼ 0.030,
n ¼ 196 females; hazard ratio ¼ 1.97; 95% CI ¼ (1.07, 3.61);
Supplementary Table 2). There were no detectable relationships
between adult survival and the other four sources of adversity
in this analysis (Supplementary Table 2), although parameter
estimates
for
all
four
variables
were
in
the
predicted
directions (shorter lifespan with lower maternal rank, lower
maternal social connectedness, first year drought and larger
group size).
Cumulative early adversity and adult lifespan. The results of the
individual effects model suggest that the correlation between early
adversity and adult longevity is relatively simple for female
baboons and is primarily driven by maternal investment. This
inference contrasts with the predictions of the cumulative

 adversity hypothesis, which proposes that adverse environmental
conditions act in aggregate to influence adult health and survi-
val1,6,41. To test for cumulative effects, we constructed a simple
cumulative adversity index by summing the number of adverse
conditions each female experienced early in her life. Our strategy
was based on analyses of early adversity and allostatic load (that
is, cumulative wear and tear42,43) in human populations, in which
the sum of insults experienced has proven more predictive than
modelling each variable independently6,40,41,44. For continuous
variables, adverse conditions were binarized and defined as those
that fell in the lowest-ranking quartile of ordinal ranks, lowest
quartile of social connectedness, or largest quartile of group sizes,
respectively, relative to the population distribution (following, for
example, refs 44,45). A similar proportion of females experienced
early maternal loss (25%), had a competing younger sibling
(18.4%), or was born during a drought (18.4%). Thus, a female
who experienced an early life insult was approximately equally
likely to have been affected by any of the six sources of adversity
we considered, ensuring that our analyses were not driven by a
subset of common adverse conditions.
Early life experiences for female baboons in Amboseli were
highly variable. Forty-three females in our data set experienced
none of the six adverse conditions; 72 experienced only one; 52
experienced two; and 29 experienced three or more (23
experienced 3, and 6 experienced 4 risk factors; none experienced
5 or 6). The cumulative adversity model strongly predicted
lifespan (Wald test P ¼ 7.75 � 10 � 7, n ¼ 196 females; Fig. 1a),
with better support than the individual effects model (r2 ¼ 0.12,
AIC ¼ 589.32 versus r2 ¼ 0.11, AIC ¼ 600.74). The addition of a
single source of adversity nearly doubled the estimated risk of
death at every adult age (hazard ratio ¼ 1.90; 95% CI ¼ (1.474,
2.453)), translating into a striking difference in median survival.
Specifically, among females that experienced Z3 sources of
adversity, more than 50% were predicted to die by age 9 (median
survival ¼ 8.85 years), while females who experienced 0 or 1
source(s) of adversity had predicted median survival times of
24.02 and 18.60 years, respectively—over 10 years longer (median
survival for all females in the data set was 18.5 years, based on the
background hazard function; maximum observed lifespan was
26.7 years). Unlike in humans, female baboons do not have a long
post-reproductive
lifespan46,
suggesting
that
differences
in
longevity have major consequences for lifetime reproductive
success. Indeed, when considering only those females in our data
set with complete life histories, we identified a striking correlation
between age at death and the total number of offspring that
survived until at least age 1 (n ¼ 73, r ¼ 0.946, Po2.2 � 10 � 16;
Fig. 2). In other words, females exposed to high adversity early in
life paid a cost both in years of their own lives and in lifetime
reproductive success.
To ensure that the results of the cumulative adversity model
were not solely driven by maternal loss and close-in-age siblings,
the two significant effects in the individual effects model, we
recalculated the cumulative adversity index excluding these two
predictors.
This
reduced
cumulative
adversity
index
also
significantly predicted female lifespan, albeit with less explanatory
power (Fig. 1b; r2 ¼ 0.04; Wald test P ¼ 0.004, n ¼ 196 females;
hazard ratio ¼ 1.47; 95% CI ¼ (1.133, 1.893)). In this case,
median predicted ages at death for females who experienced no
adversity or one source of adversity were 20.76 and 18.50 years,
respectively, compared with 7.28 years for females with a
cumulative adversity index Z3 (Fig. 1b). Importantly, the
cumulative adversity approach also outperformed an individual
effects model when predictor variables were coded identically
in both analyses. Specifically, if we binarized the data for each
source of adversity using the same criteria as in the cumulative
adversity model, the binarized individual effects model still
received less statistical support than the cumulative adversity
model
(AIC ¼ 589.32
versus
AIC ¼ 594.96;
Supplementary
Table 3). In addition, prediction error was lowest for the
cumulative adversity model compared with the other models
we considered (integrated Brier score ¼ 0.146 for the cumulative
adversity model, 0.158 for the individual effects model and 0.150
for the individual effects model with binary terms; Supplementary
Fig. 1). Thus, the cumulative adversity model captures contingent,
non-linear effects not captured in the individual effects model
analyses.
Cumulative early adversity predicts adult social integration. In
humans, early life adversity is thought to act in part by touching

 off a cascade of adverse circumstances throughout life, especially
social disadvantages, which may further compromise health5,47.
In particular, early adversity may be correlated with poor social
environments in adulthood, which are known predictors of adult
health and survival26. Prior research in Amboseli has found that
social connectedness to females and males independently predict
adult female longevity24. Specifically, adult females who are
socially isolated from adult females, adult males or both sexes,
lead
shorter
lives
than
females
who
have
strong
social
connectedness
to
one
or
both
sexes24,25.
We
therefore
investigated whether a female’s social connectedness to adult
females or to adult males was predicted by the early life
cumulative
adversity
index
(controlling
for
other
known
predictors of social connectedness: age, dominance rank and
availability of adult female kin24).
We found that cumulative early life adversity predicted the
strength of a female’s social connectedness to other adult females
(Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table 4), but not to adult males (Fig. 3b;
Supplementary Table 5). Specifically, females who experienced
high levels of early life adversity were more socially isolated from
other females during adulthood than females who experienced
little early adversity (linear mixed model (LMM): b ¼ � 0.14,
P ¼ 0.005, n ¼ 123). This effect was not solely driven by females’
relationships with their mothers, as removing maternal social
connectedness or maternal loss as components of the cumulative
adversity index still produced a significant negative relationship
between cumulative early adversity and adult female social
connectedness (LMM without maternal social connectedness:
b ¼ � 0.13, P ¼ 0.025; LMM without maternal loss: b ¼ � 0.16,
P ¼ 0.002, n ¼ 123).
Discussion
Our results support the idea that cumulative insults in early life
strongly predict survival. While cumulative effects of early
adversity have long been hypothesized, our analysis represents
the first prospective study to test for a correlation between
cumulative adversity (measured as aggregate exposure to multiple
early life insults) and natural lifespan in any species, including
humans (where studies thus far have been either retrospective or
cross-sectional45–47). Our results extend previous findings in wild
large mammals that show a relationship between survival and
physiological proxies of early life insults (for example, reduced
body mass17) by directly connecting survival with the specific
environmental exposures themselves. Together, our findings
contribute to three important insights.
First, they indicate the utility of using a cumulative risk
approach to investigate aggregate early life effects, especially in
small data sets. By doing so, we were able to identify
contributions of early life insults that were undetectable when
modelling each insult individually. Indeed, although the results
of the cumulative risk model support complex interactions
between early life conditions, no interactions involving the two
best-supported variables in the independent effects model
(maternal loss and competing younger sibling) and any other
early life insult were statistically detectable in our data set (all P
values were 40.1). The ability of index approaches to capture
such effects without needing to explicitly model all pairwise (or
higher order) interactions has been noted in studies of human
populations40,41, but have not been applied to study naturally
aging animal populations. Our results indicate the potential
benefits of doing so.
Second, our findings connect cumulative early adversity to the
length of natural adult lifespans, and hence the survival
component of fitness. Further, female baboons that suffered high
levels of early adversity not only lived vastly shortened lives, but
also experienced an enormous cost to their potential reproductive
output (Fig. 2). Specifically, because female baboons, like other
nonhuman primates, reproduce throughout the life and rarely
experience a post-reproductive life46,48, the lifespan differences
experienced by females with different levels of early adversity
translated into substantial differences in lifetime reproductive
success. Similar patterns have been found in other long-lived
species (for example, refs 49–51). Our results thus suggest that the
scope for adaptive responses to early adversity is limited. Notably,
baboons are a socially complex species that inhabits a savanna
environment similar to that exploited by early hominins52,53.
Hence, early life effects on health in humans today may be the
modern equivalent of early life effects on fitness components that
have been important throughout much of human evolutionary
history—and
not
a
consequence
of
the
modern
human
environment, as some hypotheses propose (for example, refs
54–56).
Third, our results provide some clues about the mechanisms
that underlie early life effects on longevity. While some of the
effects we observed are likely to be mediated by resource
limitation, they also appear to act in part through the relationship
between early adversity and adult social relationships. Indeed,
adverse social conditions are strongly correlated with morbidity
and mortality outcomes in humans and other animals, including
in Amboseli, where social isolation in adulthood predicts shorter
lifespans for female baboons on the order of 2–3 years24. Our
results extend these observations to suggest that early adversity
predicts adult social isolation. Notably, however, early adversity
was only correlated with female social isolation from other adult
females, and not from adult males, suggesting that forming strong
relationships with adult males might be a route through which
females can mitigate the negative effects of early life insults. We
do not yet understand why females who experience more
adversity in early life find it challenging to establish strong
affiliative relationships with other adult females, but not adult

Figure 2 | Relationship between lifespan and reproductive success.
Female baboons in Amboseli produce a single surviving offspring once
every 2.13 years on average (based on the slope of the regression line), and
do not exhibit extended post-reproductive lifespans. Surviving offspring are
defined here as offspring who lived to at least age 1 (note that inter-birth
intervals thus differ from estimates based on all offspring produced, which
we used to define competing younger siblings). Among females in our data
set who reached adulthood, lifespan explains 89.5% of the variance in the
total number of surviving offspring (Pearson’s r ¼ 0.946, Po2.2 � 10 � 16,
N ¼ 72); thus, survival is a strong predictor of lifetime reproductive success.

 males. However, regardless of the causes, our observation lends
support to the argument that relationships between social
adversity in adulthood, and health and survival outcomes may
be partly driven by early life events57. Future work will be
important in disentangling these effects, and especially for
dissecting the relative importance of a path connecting early
adversity to longevity via social relationships versus other,
independent mechanisms (for example, resource mediation).
Methods
Study population and data collection. All demographic, behavioural and
ecological data for this study were collected between 1983 and 2013 as part of
longitudinal monitoring of wild baboons (Papio cynocephalus) in the Amboseli
basin of southern Kenya (approximately 1,700 animals since 1983, 250–350 of all
ages alive at any given time). Permission to conduct this research was granted by
the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Kenyan governmental body that oversees wildlife
(most recent permit numbers NACOSTI/P/15/8999/7886 to JT, NACOSTI/P/14/
2921/3128 to EAA, NCST/RCD/12B/012/55 to JA, and NACOSTI/P/15/1973/7878
to SCA) and overseen by Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee
protocol approvals at Duke University (A020-15-01), University of Notre Dame
(13-11-1352) and Princeton University (1944-13).
Subjects were individually known based on visual recognition. All subjects were
habituated to the presence of neutral observers, who followed 1–2 social groups of
baboons each day, 6 days a week, alternating mornings and afternoons, year round.
Demographic data, including births and disappearances, were collected via
systematic group censuses. Because female baboons remain in the groups in which
they were born throughout their lives (barring group fissions, which are also
captured in our observational data), female disappearances can be reliably
attributed to deaths. Hence, all females in the study had birth and death dates
accurate to within a few days’ error. We did not include male baboons in our study
because they routinely transfer between groups, making male disappearances
ambiguous (they could be either deaths or transfers).
Of the females monitored during this period, we retained only females who met
the following criteria: (1) they survived to age 4 years, which is near the earliest age
of adulthood in this population (median age at menarche is 4.5 years; 80% of
females reach menarche between 4 and 5 years, and only 7% reach menarche
before the age of 4 years29); (2) they were members of groups that foraged
exclusively on wild foods, and were not members of any of the ‘Lodge’ groups
monitored in this population, who exploit refuse from human tourists for part of
their diet; and (3) data were available for all six sources of early life adversity we
considered. Importantly, females who were retained in the analysis were not a
biased sample of the study population: in a Cox proportional hazards model,
females who satisfied criteria 1 and 2 but had missing data on one or more sources
of early adversity (n ¼ 281) did not differ in survival time from the females
included in the final data set (Wald test P ¼ 0.406; hazard ratio ¼ 0.864; 95%
CI ¼ (0.611, 1.22)).
The final data set included 196 known-aged female baboons, born into eight
different social groups. Seventy-three of these individuals were followed from birth
until death; life histories for the remaining 123 were right-censored (of these
females, 119 were still alive at the last census date and 4 were censored because of
changes in group monitoring during the long-term study). The sources of early life
adversity we considered were defined as follows:
(i) Drought was defined as r200 mm of cumulative rainfall in the first year of
life. Rainfall is measured daily at the field site using a rain gauge and varies
substantially across hydrological years (Supplementary Fig. 2). We chose to
model drought as a binary variable based on prior studies of drought effects
in Amboseli30,31, in which using a categorical threshold—when food and
water truly seem to become resource limiting—was a better predictor of
physiological consequences for female baboons than using a continuous
measure of rainfall.
(ii) Experienced density was measured as the number of adults of both sexes in
an individual’s social group on the day that individual was born. The number
of adults (post-menarcheal females and males with enlarged testes) in a
group on a given day is based on regular complete censuses on each
monitoring day. Group density is highly stable from month to month (for
example, using density on the day of birth is highly correlated with mean
density in the 3 months surrounding birth: r2 ¼ 0.99).
(iii) Maternal dominance rank was defined as the ordinal dominance rank of the
female’s mother in the month that the female was born. Dominance ranks
were assigned monthly based on the outcomes of dyadic aggressive
encounters that are recorded using ad libitum observations58. Because
dominance hierarchies in female baboons are linear and transitive, ordinal
ranks can be obtained by minimizing the number of interactions in which
higher ranking females lose interactions with lower ranking females.
(iv) Maternal social connectedness was measured as the social connectedness of a
female’s mother to other adult females. Specifically, maternal social
connectedness was calculated as the subject’s mother’s average value over
the first 2 years of the subject’s life. Our measures of social connectedness are
based on a standardized index that measures the frequency with which the
female’s mother was a grooming partner with other adult females in her
social group, relative to grooming rates for all adult females alive in the
population in the same year and adjusted for observer effort24.
(v) Maternal loss was based on the observation of a mother’s death before 4
years of age. Young baboons become nutritionally independent from their
mothers around 1.5 year of age59. However, juveniles remain socially
dependent on their mothers, who are their primary defenders and social
partners, for much longer. Age 4 corresponds approximately to the earliest
age at menarche, when a female may start investing in offspring of her
own29.
(vi) Presence of a competing younger sibling was assessed using birthdates for the
focal female and her next younger sibling, collected in the census data. The
birth of a sibling may reduce maternal investment in her daughter, especially
if the sibling is born soon after the daughter’s birth. Younger siblings were
treated as ‘competing’ if they were a born alive (as opposed to a pre-term

quartile of interbirth intervals in this population (mean inter-birth interval
for Amboseli females is 1.75 years; note that Fig. 2 gives an estimate of 2.13

lifespan and total offspring, based only on cases in which the older offspring
survives to at least age 1).

adversity index was constructed by summing the number of adverse conditions each
female experienced in early life. Each adverse condition was represented as a binarized
variable, capturing whether the adverse condition occurred in the case of maternal loss,
close-in-age younger sibling, and drought, and whether a female fell in the extreme
quartile of the population distribution, in the case of maternal rank, maternal social
connectedness and experienced density. The adversity index thus ranged from 0 to 6
(although no females in our study sample experienced more than four adverse con-
ditions). For reduced cumulative adversity indexes, we recalculated the adversity index
for the same individuals included in the full analysis of cumulative adversity, but after
excluding a specified subset of factors. For example, excluding the conditions of
maternal loss and close-in-age younger sibling resulted in a cumulative adversity index
ranging from 0 to 4 instead of 0 to 6 (applied to all 196 females). For all analyses, we
grouped females that experienced three or more adverse conditions into one category
because only a small fraction of females experienced three or four adverse conditions,
and none experienced five or six.
Cox proportional hazards model for survival data. To assess the relationship
between early life adversity and mortality, we fit Cox proportional hazards models,
either with a single predictor variable (the cumulative adversity index, a continuous
variable) or multiple predictors, with each source of early adversity modelled sepa-
rately. All models were fit using the function coxph, and were checked for adherence
to the proportional hazards assumption using the R package survival60. To assess the
prediction error for the resulting survival curves, we used the function pec in the R
package pec61, with the data split method run using bootstrap resampling (option
BootCv, 100 iterations allowing sampling with replacement: Supplementary Fig. 1).
Early adversity and social connectedness in adulthood. To investigate the
relationship between a female’s cumulative early life adversity and her adult social
connectedness we constructed LMMs using the lmm function in the R package
lme4 (ref. 62). Social connectedness was measured using the same approach
described above for maternal social connectedness24, except that we focused on the
focal female’s grooming patterns instead of her mother’s and measured both her
connectedness to other adult females and, for a separate analysis, her social
connectedness to adult males (both values independently predict lifespan in the
Amboseli baboon population and are themselves weakly negatively correlated24).
Because female social connectedness varies over the life course due to changes in
the availability of female kin, age and group demographics, we included multiple
values for each female (one value for each year of her adult life) in the LMM,
controlling for female identity as a random effect. The sample size of females for
this analysis was smaller (n ¼ 123) than for the survival analyses because of missing
data on social connectedness in adulthood (social connectedness was not estimated
in group-years during which group membership was unstable, for example, during
protracted fission events). In our LMMs, the response variable was the social
connectedness index (either to adult females, Fig. 2a, or to adult males, Fig. 2b)
calculated for each female in each year of her life where data were available. The
number of adverse conditions the female experienced in early life was a fixed
ordinal predictor variable (0 to Z3 conditions, as above), and female age (in years),
female ordinal dominance rank, whether the female’s mother was still alive, and
whether the female had adult daughters living in her social group were fit as
additional fixed effects covariates (where values for the same focal female
varied across the years of her life in which social connectedness measures were
available).
