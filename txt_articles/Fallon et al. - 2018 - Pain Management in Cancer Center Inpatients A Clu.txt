Purpose
Pain is suboptimally managed in patients with cancer. We aimed to compare the effect of
a policy of adding a clinician-delivered bedside pain assessment and management tool (Edin-
burgh Pain Assessment and management Tool [EPAT]) to usual care (UC) versus UC alone on
pain outcomes.
Patients and Methods
In a two-arm, parallel group, cluster randomized (1:1) trial, we observed pain outcomes in 19 cancer
centers in the United Kingdom and then randomly assigned the centers to either implement EPAT or
to continue UC. The primary outcome was change in the percentage of study participants in each
center with a clinically significant ($ 2 point) improvement in worst pain (using the Brief Pain In-
ventory Short Form) from admission to 3 to 5 days after admission. Secondary outcomes included
quality of analgesic prescribing and opioid-related adverse effects.
Results
Ten centers were randomly assigned to EPAT, and nine were assigned to UC. We enrolled 1,921
patients and obtained outcome data from 93% (n = 1,795). Participants (mean age, 60 years; 49%
women) had a variety of cancer types. For centers randomly assigned to EPAT, the percentage of
participants with a clinically significant improvement in worst pain increased from 47.7% to 54.1%,
and for those randomly assigned to continue UC, this percentage decreased from 50.6% to 46.4%.
The absolute difference was 10.7% (95% CI, 0.2% to 21.1%; P = .046) and it increased to 15.4%
(95% CI, 5.8% to 25.0%; P = .004) when two centers that failed to implement EPAT were excluded.
EPAT centers had greater improvements in prescribing practice and in the Brief Pain Inventory Short
Form pain subscale score. Other pain and distress outcomes and opioid adverse effects did not
differ between EPAT and UC.
Conclusion
A systematic integrated approach improves pain outcomes for inpatients in cancer centers without
increasing opioid adverse effects.

INTRODUCTION
Half of patients with cancer suffer from pain.1-3
Despite the availability of pain management guide-
lines, poor outcomes are common.4-10 Common
shortcomings in pain management include un-
structured assessment, use of treatment guide-
lines that lack explicit algorithms and do not address
clinicians’ concerns about prescribing opioids,
and lack of systematic monitoring of outcomes,
including adverse effects.11,12
Admission to a cancer center provides an im-
portant opportunity to improve pain outcomes. We
developed a simple clinician-administered bedside
tool—the Edinburgh Pain Assessment and man-
agement Tool (EPAT)—that builds on the concept of
pain as the fifth vital sign.13-16 EPAT aims to change
routine practice by directing a systematic as-
sessment of cancer-related pain, guiding treatment

 using linked algorithms, and prompting the regular reassessment of
pain to determine both efficacy and adverse effects of treatment. We
tested EPAT in a single cancer center and found preliminary evidence
of its feasibility and efficacy.16
The current study aimed to determine the effectiveness of
implementing EPAT in multiple cancer center inpatient units.
Specifically, we sought to determine whether the percentage of
inpatients with improved pain increased in cancer centers that
implemented EPAT compared with cancer centers that continued
to deliver usual care (UC). We also aimed to find out whether
implementing EPAT improved prescribing practice and whether it
increased opioid-related adverse effects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients
We used a two-arm, parallel group, cluster randomized controlled
trial to evaluate the effect on pain outcomes of introducing EPAT into
cancer centers (Appendix, online only, list of study group members). The
trial clusters were the inpatient units of regional cancer centers in the
United Kingdom. In each center, the trial was conducted in two phases. In
the first, pre–random assignment phase, 50 patients with cancer-related
pain were enrolled, and their pain outcomes were measured after man-
agement in accordance with UC. Centers were then randomly assigned to
either implement EPAT (EPAT centers) or to continue providing UC (UC
centers). In the second, post–random assignment phase, an additional 50
patients were enrolled and their pain outcomes were measured.
Cancer centers were eligible to participate if they did not have an
existing bedside pain management system, could recruit 100 patients in the
required time frame, and did not anticipate organizational changes that
might affect pain management policies. Within each center, patients were
eligible to participate if they were adults ( $ 18 years of age) with active
cancer and cancer-related pain, with a worst pain in the past 24 hours score
(assessed within 24 hours of admission) of $ 4 on a scale of 0 to 10. The
protocol (Data Supplement) lists complete inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The trial was approved by the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee
and was overseen by a trial steering committee. Conduct of the trial in each
center followed study guidance procedures (Data Supplement). All centers
and participants provided written informed consent.
Random Assignment and Masking
A database software algorithm, implemented by the Edinburgh
Clinical Trials Unit, randomly allocated cancer centers to implement EPAT
or continue providing UC in a 1:1 ratio using variable-size permuted blocks.
Because of the cluster design, we were unable to mask cancer center clinicians,
patients, or data collectors to intervention. However, the clinicians in the UC
centers did not know the content of EPAT, and patients self-rated their pain
and knew only that their cancer center was taking part in a pain study.
Procedures
Patient enrollment. All patients admitted to the participating cancer centers
were given information about the study. A research nurse obtained patients’
verbal consent to eligibility screening. The nurse provided eligible patients with
a further explanation of the study and obtained their written consent for
participation. Enrollment was done independently of the clinical team.
Delivery of pain management. The clinicians who delivered pain
management (EPATor UC) were oncology nurses, nursing care assistants,
oncology trainee doctors, and senior oncologists. In UC centers, the
clinical team managed patients’ pain according to their clinical judgment
and existing local guidelines. In EPAT centers, the clinical team was
provided with the EPAT (Data Supplement) and given brief (maximum, 1
hour) training in its use. EPATwas designed to address the aforementioned
key barriers to effective pain management by prompting clinicians to
systematically assess pain using simple questions that should not be
shortened or paraphrased; to follow linked treatment algorithms, rather
than broad guidelines, including instructions on opioid prescribing; and to
regularly reassess pain and opioid-related adverse effects.
EPAT integrates pain assessment into routine care by its inclusion in
the patient’s bedside chart. Clinicians are prompted to assess pain using
a two-step procedure every time the patient’s vital signs are recorded. In
step 1 (Fig 1), the patient is asked to rate his or her worst pain (since last
being assessed) on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable),
and this score is recorded. The chart categorizes pain scores using the
following color system: 0 to 2 is classified as gray, 3 to 4 as yellow, and 5 to
10 as blue. For patients with a yellow or blue score, the clinician is prompted
to proceed to step 2 (Data Supplement), which explores the location and
nature of the pain, exacerbating and relieving factors, and symptoms that
may be caused by opioids. Flags linked to recorded responses then prompt
the clinician to use the appropriate algorithm to guide prescribing. The chart
also prompts reassessment of pain and opioid adverse effects 1 hour after
administration of opioid medication.
Outcomes
The primary trial outcome (measured at the cancer center level) was
the change in the percentage of participants with a clinically significant
improvement in pain. We defined a clinically significant improvement in
pain as a reduction of $ 2 points in the severity of worst pain reported over
the previous 24 hours measured between admission and reassessment (3 to
5 days after admission). Worst pain is an item on the Brief Pain Inventory
Short Form (BPI-SF), which has 11 questions, each rated on a scale of 0 to
10, and is validated for use in the evaluation of cancer pain.17 Worst pain is
the recommended outcome measure for trials, and a 2-point change on
this item has been found to be meaningful to patients.18-20
The secondary trial outcomes (also measured as cancer center–level
changes) were the percentage of participants with controlled pain (worst

 pain BPI-SF score , 4); the mean changes in BPI-SF scores (worst pain, pain
subscale, pain interference subscale, and total score); the mean change in
global distress in the past 24 hours using the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network thermometer (0 to 10 thermometer, where 0 is no distress
and 10 is extreme distress)21; the mean change in opioid adverse effects
(using the mean of 0 to 10 scales for drowsiness, confusion, disorientation,
shadows, vivid dreams, hallucinations, and muscle twitching; a modification
of a previously used scale)22; the percentage of participants receiving good
practice prescribing (rated based on the appropriateness of the medication[s]
prescribed, along with how they were prescribed, compared with guidelines;
Data Supplement); the percentage of participants readmitted to the cancer
center with uncontrolled pain within 14 days of discharge; and in EPAT
centers, satisfaction with the attention given to pain and the ease of use of
EPAT rated on a 0 to 10 scale by patients and nurses, respectively.
Outcome data were collected from participants, medical records, and
relevant staff, and as appropriate, by the research nurses. If participants had
been discharged from the cancer center before the time of the follow-up
assessment, the research nurse collected the outcome data by telephone.
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that two treatment groups of nine cancer centers each,
with 100 participants per cancer center (50 recruited in the first phase before
random assignment of the cancer center, and 50 recruited in the second phase
after random assignment) would give 80% power at the 5% significance level
to detect a difference of at least 15% between the trial arms in the primary
outcome. The main analysis was conducted (using SAS version 9.2 software;
SAS Institute, Cary, NC) at the end of the trial, using an intent-to-treat
principle that included all participants who provided usable outcome data.
Because there were, as planned, relatively few clusters (cancer centers)
and little variability in the cluster size, we performed the analyses using
summary measures.23 For each analysis, we calculated a single summary
measure for each cancer center and compared the UC centers with the
EPAT centers using a two-sample t test. Hence, the summary statistic for
the primary outcome was the difference between the percentage of par-
ticipants who achieved a clinically significant reduction in pain before
random assignment (phase 1) and the percentage who achieved a clinically
significant reduction in pain after random assignment (phase 2). For
continuous outcome measures, the summary statistic was the difference in
the mean score before and after random assignment.
In a prespecified sensitivity analysis, hierarchical patient-level ana-
lyses were performed using random-effects models. The results for the
primary end point (achieving a reduction of $ 2 points in the severity of
worst pain reported over the previous 24 hours) and a secondary end point
(the magnitude of the reduction in the severity of worst pain reported over
the previous 24 hours) are reported. In addition to the main analysis, we
performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome and of
good practice prescribing excluding cancer centers that had been randomly
assigned to EPAT but were unable to implement it.
RESULTS
The United Kingdom has 40 cancer centers. We selected 20 centers
from those eligible to participate, aiming for geographical spread
and a range of center sizes. Each center took part in the trial for
approximately 1 year (including both pre– and post–random as-
signment phases). Center participation was staggered and occurred
between December 2007 and January 2013. One center dropped
out before random assignment. Ten cancer centers were randomly
assigned to implement EPAT, and nine were assigned to continue
providing UC (Fig 2).
Of the 42,000 patients admitted to the cancer centers during
the trial, 8,400 were assessed as having moderate or severe pain
(worst pain in the past 24 hours of $ 4 on a 0 to 10 scale), and
1,921 patients were enrolled (985 before center random as-
signment and 936 after assignment; Data Supplement). The most
common reason for excluding patients was that their admission
was for planned chemotherapy and too brief to allow completion
of the protocol. Only 2.7% of eligible patients (53 of 1,974 pa-
tients) declined to participate. Participants had a mean age of 60
years (range, 20 to 90 years), and 49% were female (Table 1).
Patients had a variety of cancers, the most common of which were
genitourinary (272 of 1,921 patients; 14.2%), GI (260 of 1,921
patients; 13.5%), breast (234 of 1,921 patients; 12%), and lung
(220 of 1,921 patients; 11.5%). These characteristics were well
balanced between EPAT and UC centers. We obtained outcome
data from 93% of participants (1,795 of 1,921 patients). These
data included 150 telephone follow-up assessments for patients
who had been discharged from hospital (the number of telephone
assessments was similar in both trial arms). The mean number of
days from admission to the primary outcome assessment was 4
and was similar between trial arms.

 Introducing EPAT into cancer centers had an effect on pain
outcomes. The percentage of participants with a clinically sig-
nificant improvement in pain increased after random assignment
in eight of the 10 EPAT centers and in three of the nine UC centers
(Fig 3). In EPAT centers, the mean percentage of participants with
a clinically significant improvement in pain increased from 47.7%
(before random assignment) to 54.1% (after random assignment),
an absolute increase of 6.4%. In UC centers, the mean percentage
of participants with a clinically significant improvement in pain
decreased from 50.6% (before random assignment) to 46.4% (after
random assignment), an absolute decrease of 4.2%. Thus, the
absolute difference between trial arms was 10.7% (95% CI, 0.2% to

 21.1%; P = .046). There was no difference in outcomes between
participants assessed by telephone after discharge and those who
were assessed as inpatients.
Two of the centers randomly assigned to implement EPAT
were unable to do so because of unanticipated organizational
changes. In these centers, the percentage of participants with
a clinically significant improvement in pain actually decreased
after random assignment (Fig 3). A post hoc sensitivity analysis
that excluded these two centers found a larger difference between
EPAT and UC (absolute difference, 15.4%; 95% CI, 5.8% to
25.0%; P = .004). The remaining eight centers that implemented
EPATused it in at least 90% of patient assessments as indicated by
entries on the participants’ charts.
Regarding the trial’s secondary outcomes, EPAT centers had
greater improvements in good practice prescribing (a difference that
was larger when the two centers unable to implement EPAT were
excluded) and greater changes in the mean worst pain item and in
mean pain subscale scores. However, there were no statistically
significant differences between EPAT and UC centers in the per-
centage of participants with controlled pain, the mean pain in-
terference score, the mean total pain score, or the mean severity of
global distress. There was also no difference between EPAT and UC
centers in the percentage of patients who had received strong opioids
(80%), in the mean total 24-hour oral morphine equivalent (10 mg),
or importantly, in opioid-related adverse effects (Table 2). We were
unable to analyze readmissions to hospital because the available data
were inadequate. Participants who received EPATreported (on a 0 to
10 scale) high satisfaction with the attention given to their pain
(mean score, 8.6; standard deviation, 1.8), and nurses reported (on
a 0 to 10 scale) moderate satisfaction with the ease of using EPAT
(mean score, 6.4; standard deviation, 2.5).
From the prespecified patient-level sensitivity analysis of the
primary end point, the estimated intracluster correlation coefficient
was 0.004, and the estimated treatment effect was 11.6% (95% CI,
2.4% to 20.9%; P = .014). For the corresponding analysis of the
magnitude of the reduction in the patients’ worst pain scores, the
estimated intracluster correlation coefficient was 0. The estimated
treatment effect was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.31 to 1.32; P = .002).
DISCUSSION
The findings of this multicenter, cluster randomized trial indicate
that a policy of integrating systematic pain assessment and man-
agement into routine cancer center care using a simple tool (EPAT)
improves pain outcomes for patients with moderate or severe
cancer-related pain. The difference between EPATand UC centers in
the percentage of patients with a clinically significant reduction in
their worst pain was 10.7%. This difference increased to 15.4% when
the two centers that had been unable to implement EPAT were
excluded. It should be noted, however, that the 95% CI for the 10.7%
difference is wide (0.2% to 21.1%).
Inspection of the results by cancer center revealed that the dif-
ference in the primary outcome between centers delivering EPAT and
centers continuing UC reflected not only an improvement in pain
management with EPAT (except in the two centers that failed to
implement EPAT), but also a deterioration in pain management in
most of the centers that continued UC. We did not find any dif-
ferences in patient or cancer characteristics in the samples studied in
each phase that could account for this. Therefore, we suggest that
a likely explanation for the deterioration in outcome in some, but
not all, of the UC centers in the post–random assignment period
reflects a return to pretrial standards of pain management after
improvement during the pre–random assignment phase of the trial.
This short-term effect on clinicians’ behavior might be expected as
a result of awareness that their center was participating in a study
that monitored their patients’ pain scores.24 This effect would also be
expected to decline over the many months of study in centers
continuing with UC. The effect was not seen in centers imple-
menting EPAT, which overall had better outcomes.
EPAT centers prescribed analgesics more appropriately (as
defined in the Data Supplement) and not in higher doses. Although
the concept of pain as the fifth vital sign has been criticized as
a potential cause of increased opioid-related adverse effects, the use
of EPAT did not increase opioid adverse effects.25,26 This absence of
increased adverse effects despite better pain management may be
because EPAT alerts clinicians to monitor adverse effects of pain
treatment, as well as efficacy.
EPAT did not improve all of the secondary trial outcomes. The
percentage of participants with controlled pain, the severity of general
distress, and the degree to which pain interfered with activities did
not differ between trial arms. The short duration of this study and
inpatient setting arguably made it difficult to change these outcomes.
An additional and notable finding is that implementation of
EPAT was hampered by organizational and leadership changes in
two trial centers, which also subsequently had worse patient
outcomes. This observation highlights the importance of organi-
zational factors and leadership, as well as clinician education, in
achieving positive changes in patient care.27 As expected, the patient-
level sensitivity analyses yielded parameter estimates and CIs that
were broadly similar to those obtained in the primary cluster-level
analyses and with levels of statistical significance that were more
extreme.
Previously published smaller studies have evaluated the
effects of systematic management for cancer pain. Two ran-
domized trials compared algorithm-based pain management by
pain specialists, rather than oncology teams, with variable

 results.28,29 Two preliminary studies evaluated the integration of
systematic pain management into the usual clinical care delivered
by oncology teams with more promising findings.30,31 Finally, it is
notable that published studies of integrated and systematic ap-
proaches to the management of other symptoms in patients with
cancer, in particular depression, have also found these to be
effective.32-34
The strengths of this trial include the participation of many
cancer centers in the United Kingdom and negligible missing
outcome data. However, the trial has limitations. First, the trial was
carried out within one particular health care system (the United
Kingdom National Health Service), although the issues associated
with cancer pain assessment and management are similar in most
developed countries. Second, we do not have information on
participants’ longer term outcomes. Third, oncology teams and
those collecting the outcome data from patients could not be
masked to the treatment allocation.
In conclusion, this study is, to our knowledge, the first large
randomized evaluation of the integration of systematic pain as-
sessment and management into routine care of patients with cancer.
The implementation of EPAT improved both prescribing practice
and pain outcomes. Furthermore, it did not increase opioid-related
adverse effects. This latter finding is important given concerns that
the measurement of pain as a vital sign and linked opioid prescribing
can be harmful.14,15 The findings of this trial add to the accumu-
lating evidence for the efficacy of more integrated and systematic
approaches to symptom management in patients with cancer.
