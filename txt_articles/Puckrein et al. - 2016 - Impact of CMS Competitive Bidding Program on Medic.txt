 Impact of CMS Competitive
Bidding Program on Medicare
Beneficiary Safety and Access
to Diabetes Testing Supplies:
A Retrospective, Longitudinal
Analysis
Diabetes Care 2016;39:563–571 | DOI: 10.2337/dc15-1264
OBJECTIVE
In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the Com-
petitive Bidding Program (CBP) in nine markets for diabetes supplies. The intent
was to lower costs to consumers. Medicare claims data (2009–2012) were used to
confirm the CMS report (2012) that there were no disruptions in acquisition
caused by CBP and no changes in health outcomes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The study population consisted of insulin users: 43,939 beneficiaries in the nine
test markets (TEST) and 485,688 beneficiaries in the nontest markets (NONTEST).
TEST and NONTEST were subdivided: those with full self-monitoring of blood
glucose (SMBG) supply acquisition (full SMBG) according to prescription and those
with partial/no acquisition (partial/no SMBG). Propensity score–matched analysis
was performed to reduce selection bias. Outcomes were impact of partial/no
SMBG acquisition on mortality, inpatient admissions, and inpatient costs.
RESULTS
Survival was negatively associated with partial/no SMBG acquisition in both co-
horts (P < 0.0001). Coterminous with CBP (2010–2011), there was a 23.0% (P <
0.0001) increase in partial/no SMBG acquisition in TEST vs. 1.7% (P = 0.0002) in
NONTEST. Propensity score–matched analysis showed beneficiary migration from
full to partial/no SMBG acquisition in 2011 (1,163 TEST vs. 605 NONTEST) was
associated with more deaths within the TEST cohort (102 vs. 60), with higher
inpatient hospital admissions and associated costs.
CONCLUSIONS
SMBG supply acquisition was disrupted in the TEST population, leading to in-
creased migration to partial/no SMBG acquisition with associated increases in
mortality, inpatient admissions, and costs. Based on our findings, more effective
monitoring protocols are needed to protect beneficiary safety.

EPIDEMIOLOGY/HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
 Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)
is a critical component of diabetes care
among individuals treated with insulin
(1,2). The American Diabetes Association
recommends that all insulin-treated indi-
viduals should perform SMBG according
to the needs of their insulin regimen (1).
For individuals treated with intensive insu-
lin regimens, SMBG should be performed
at least prior to meals/snacks and occa-
sionally postprandially, at bedtime, prior
to exercise, when a low blood glucose is
suspected, after treating low blood glu-
cose, and prior to critical tasks such as
driving; however, the evidence is insuffi-
cientregardingSMBGfrequencyin individ-
uals treated with basal insulin therapy (1).
The American Association of Clinical
Endocrinologists and American College of
Endocrinology recommend that SMBG be
performed by all patients using insulin
(minimum of twice daily and ideally before
any insulin injection) (2). More frequent
SMBG after meals or in the middle of the
night may be required for insulin-taking
patients with frequent hypoglycemia, pa-
tients not at HbA1c targets, and those with
hypoglycemic symptoms (2).
Frequent SMBG is particularly impor-
tant in elderly individuals with diabetes
who are treated with insulinotropic
medications because the risk of severe
or fatal hypoglycemia associated with
the use of sulfonylureas or insulin in-
creases exponentially with age (3,4). A
study by Huang et al. (5) found that
among individuals aged 70–79 years
with a long duration of diabetes, inci-
dence of hypoglycemia (15.88 per 1,000
person-years) was significantly higher
than incidence of other complications.
Other factors that put elderly individ-
uals with diabetes at significant risk for
severe hypoglycemia are hypoglycemia
unawareness (6) and cognitive impair-
ment (7). A study by Bremer et al. (6)
reported that patients aged $65 years
with type 2 diabetes often fail to per-
ceive neuroglycopenic and autonomic
hypoglycemic symptoms even in the
presence of a comparable prolongation
of reaction time induced by hypoglycemia.
It is also known that elderly individuals
with diabetes (.65 years) are at increased
risks of cognitive impairment and de-
mentia (8), which are significantly asso-
ciated with subsequent episodes of
severe hypoglycemia (7).
It was recently reported that insulin-
treated patients with diabetes 80 years
or older were more than twice as likely
to visit the emergency department and
nearly five times as likely to be subse-
quently hospitalized for insulin-related
hypoglycemic events than those aged
45–64 years (9). Although investigators
cited missed/inadequate meals and in-
sulin product mix-ups as the most com-
mon precipitating factors documented
for these events (9), hypoglycemia un-
awareness (6) and/or cognitive impair-
ment (7) may have been missed by
emergency care personnel as the root
causes of the severe hypoglycemia re-
ported, which illustrates the need for
frequent SMBG within this population.
Frequent use of SMBG in all insulin-
treatedpatientscanhelp mitigatehypogly-
cemia. However, the challenges associated
with financing and providing access to
diabetes testing supplies to patients with
diabetes who are $65 years old are likely
to grow with the increasing incidence of
diabetes in the U.S. and the increased
number of patients in this age-group.
To address the increasing financial
burden of diabetes care among older
Americans, the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented
its Competitive Bidding Program (CBP)
in nine test markets that included 2.3
million beneficiaries in Fee-for-Service
Medicare (10). The intent of the CBP is
to reduce beneficiary out-of-pocket ex-
penses and reduce Medicare costs while
ensuring beneficiary access to quality
items and services (10).
SMBG supplies were among the prod-
ucts included in the program. Although
notreported byCMS,itis our understand-
ing that the agency selected the nine test
markets for SMBG supplies based on pop-
ulation size. The assumed intent was to
select markets that represented 10% of
the SMBG supply volume covered by
Fee-for-Service Medicare. However, only
SMBG supplies obtained through mail-
order channels were impacted in the ini-
tial implementation; single payment rates
were reduced from $34 to $14 per vial
of test strips. SMBG supplies obtained
through retail channels were exempted
from the first round of the program.
In April 2012, CMS reported that no
disruption of access to diabetes testing
supplies occurred and that no negative
health care consequences to beneficia-
ries were seen as a result of the CBP
(10). Recognizing the potential benefits
of reducing out-of-pocket expenses for
SMBG supplies among Medicare benefi-
ciaries, particularly within minority pop-
ulations, the National Minority Quality
Forum obtained data from CMS to
more fully elucidate the effects of the
implementation of the CBP on acquisi-
tion of SMBG supplies among Medicare
beneficiaries with insulin-treated diabe-
tes within the nine test markets. We
hypothesized that lower SMBG costs
would encourage greater SMBG supply
acquisition, resulting in fewer hospital-
izations and lower inpatient costs.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In this 4-year, retrospective, longitudi-
nal study, we assessed the impact of
competitive bidding during the first
year of program implementation among
Medicare beneficiaries who treated
their diabetes using insulin within the
nine test markets (TEST) compared
with insulin-using beneficiaries in the
nontest markets (NONTEST), which rep-
resent the rest of the country. For our
analysis, we obtained the same data
collected by CMS to assess impact and
outcomes. Our goal was to determine
whether access to SMBG supplies
improved in the year after CBP imple-
mentation (2011) and, if so, assess the
behavioral and health outcomes resulting
from access improvement.
Access was assessed according to
each beneficiary’s acquisition of insulin
and SMBG supplies as prescribed by
their health care provider. For a benefi-
ciary on insulin, Medicare reimburses
for the acquisition of three strips per
day. Based on that reimbursement
schedule, full procurement of self-
monitoring blood glucose supplies is
defined here as the purchase of diabe-
tes testing strips so that, from the date
of the first purchase, the beneficiary
continued to acquire testing supplies,
resulting in their purchasing enough
blood glucose testing supplies to allow
them to test their blood glucose three
times per day .80% of the year. Any
beneficiary who scored 80% or higher
on this proportional days–covered
(PDC) scale was considered full SMBG
acquisition; any beneficiary who scored
,80% was defined as partial/no SMBG
acquisition.
Outcome Measures
Primary outcome measures included re-
lationship between full SMBG acquisition,

 partial/no SMBG acquisition, and sur-
vival probability over 4 years; change in
percentage of beneficiaries with full and
partial/no SMBG acquisition from 2009
through 2012; change in SMGB supply
acquisition channel (retail or mail order)
from 2010 through 2011; and impact of
migration from full SMBG acquisition to
partial/no SMBG acquisition on mortal-
ity, inpatient admissions, and associated
costs from 2010 through 2011.
Data Source
The data sources used for our analyses
were Medicare Beneficiary Annual Sum-
mary Files 2009–2010 and the Medicare
Master Beneficiary Summary File: Base
Segment, Chronic Conditions Segment,
and the Cost and Utilization Segment
2011–2012 (BASF). BASF is used to iden-
tify Fee-for-Service beneficiaries. Fee-
for-Service beneficiaries are defined
here as those enrolled in Part A and
Part B Medicare for at least 10 months
in which Medicare was the primary
payer and excludes any beneficiaries en-
rolled in Medicare Advantage, due to
the lack of complete reimbursement
data.Thetotalreimbursementforinpatient
stays for each beneficiary was captured
from the BASF variables MEDREIMB_IP.
Mortality was calculated from BASF
variable BENE_DOD (date of death), and
the number of unique hospitalizations
was derived from BASF variable IPSTY.
Medicare durable medical equipment
(DME) regional carrier (DMERC) File
2009–2013 was used to determine if a
beneficiary ordered SMBG supplies.
DME uses the Healthcare Common Pro-
cedure Coding System (HCPCS) A4253 to
code for diabetes testing strips. If a ben-
eficiary purchased diabetes testing
strips, he/she would have an HCPCS
A4253 in their DME record. The record
would also contain the service date and
the amount of SMBG testing supplies
acquired. Each record for the purchase

 of diabetes testing strips also contained a
modifier in which a “KL” code designated
that the diabetes testing strips were ac-
quired through mail order. The absence
of the modifier noted a retail purchase.
We used the PROD_SRVC_ID (a refor-
matted version of the insulin’s national
drug code) variable in Medicare Part D
Event File 2009–2012 to determine
if a beneficiary was on insulin therapy.

Study Population
The study population comprised Medi-
care beneficiaries with a diagnosis of di-
abetes and a record of insulin treatment
in 2009 (n = 529,627). This study popula-
tion was separated into two groups, ex-
perimental and control, for analysis. The
experimental group included all insulin-
treated beneficiaries who resided in the
nine CBP markets (TEST, n = 43,939) in
2009. The control group included all non-
test market insulin-treated beneficiaries
(NONTEST, n = 485,688).Among the types
of insulin used, CMS records showed that
349,200 (65.9%) of beneficiaries were
treated with short- or rapid-acting insu-
lin (including premixed insulins) with or
without long-acting or NPH insulin,
whereas 180,427 (34.1%) were treated
with long-acting or NPH insulin only.
Analysis
The TEST and NONTEST beneficiaries
were subdivided: those who were full
insulin acquisition and either full SMBG
or partial/no SMBG acquisition (Table 1).
A beneficiary was characterized as full or
partial acquisition of insulin based upon
the PDC model. PDC for insulin was calcu-
lated based on the fill dates and days of
supply for each prescription filled in the
Medicare Part D Event File. The numera-
tor was the total number of days covered
by the medication fills during the mea-
surement period; the patient-level de-
nominator was the number of days
between the first fill and the end of the
study period or death. Following Leslie’s
time-array method (11), we calculated
the PDC of insulin for each year from
2009 through 2012.
We then followed these clusters
within the TEST and NONTEST groups
year to year, from 2009 through 2012,
to determine whether beneficiaries re-
mained in one cluster or migrated to the
other. This allowed us to identify any pat-
terns in mortality, mortality rates, inpa-
tient admissions, and costs. Of particular
interest were changes that occurred be-
tween 2010 and 2011 when the CBP was
implemented in the nine TEST markets.
Analyses were performed to determine
whether acquisition of insulin and SMBG
supplies informed these results.
Differences between the TEST and
NONTEST groups were compared and
tested with x2 tests. We performed
Figure 1—Survival probability associated with SMBG acquisition; full vs. partial/no assessment
of 4-year survival was significantly associated with full acquisition of SMBG supplies among both
TEST and NONTEST Medicare beneficiaries.

 survival analyses to examine the rela-
tionship between the two acquisition
clusters in the total study population
and within each study group: 1) those
who maintained full SMBG acquisition
during the whole study period and 2)
those who maintained partial SMBG ac-
quisition or not using SMBG (Table 1).
For survival probability, we followed
326,970 of the 529,627 beneficiaries for
4 years from 2009 through 2012. The re-
maining 202,657 were not included in our
analysis through attrition due to early
mortality or migration from Fee-for-
Service to Medicare Advantage. Survival
time was measured as days from the time
the study began. A censoring variable was
created to indicate the time of a death.
We estimated the survivor function for
each cluster from the residual survival
times. The homogeneity tests were con-
ducted to identify significant differences
among the survival curves.
We used logistic regression models
with outcome of SMBG supply acquisi-
tion for insulin-treated beneficiaries.
The outcome event counts, including
migration patterns, mortality rates, in-
patient admissions, and medical costs,
were compared. Because of the imbal-
ance in number of beneficiaries in the
TEST versus NONTEST populations, ab-
solute percentages were used to de-
scribe beneficiary characteristics (e.g.,
partial/no SMBG), whereas relative
percentages were used to describe
changes in characteristics. Because we
were looking at actual patient records,
use of 95% CIs or SDs was not required.
It is noteworthy that the TEST cohort
included a disproportionately higher
percentage of Hispanic beneficiaries
than the NONTEST cohort. Propensity
score–matched analysis was performed
to reduce selection bias due to imbal-
ance in study covariates. We used logis-
tic regression models with outcome of
SMBG compliance for insulin-treated
beneficiaries, adjusting for their base-
line demographics and medical comor-
bidities. The beneficiaries in the partial/
no SMBG group were matched to those
in the full SMBG group in a 1:1 ratio
based on the resultant propensity score
probabilities. Matching was done
using a generalized SAS macro for pro-
pensity score matching by Fraeman and
Malley (12). The distribution of demo-
graphic factors and medical conditions
at baseline was demonstrated (Table 1).
The outcome event counts, including mi-
gration patterns, mortality rates, inpa-
tient admissions, and medical costs,
were compared after propensity score
matching for new full SMBG and partial/
no SMBG clusters. Because the CMS re-
cords did not include data about benefi-
ciaries’ socioeconomic or educational
status, a more refined analysis was not
possible.
RESULTS
Change in Full Versus Partial/No
SMBG Acquisition
A higher percentage of TEST versus
NONTEST beneficiaries showed full SMBG
acquisition in 2009 (32.3% [n = 14,179 of
43,939]vs.26.8%[n=130,298of485,688])
and 2010 (32.2% [n = 10,864 of 33,790]
vs. 27.6% [n = 104,939 of 380,904]).
From 2010 to 2011, the percentage of
beneficiaries with full SMBG acquisition
decreased from 32.2% (n = 10,864 of
33,790) to 28.7% (n = 6,567 of 22,871;
P , 0.0001) in TEST beneficiaries but in-
creased from 27.5% (n = 104,939 of
380,904) to 28.2% (n = 81,092 of 287,957;
P , 0.0001) in NONTEST beneficiaries.
From2010to2011,thepercentageofben-
eficiaries with partial/no SMBG acquisi-
tion increased from 22.1% (n = 7,465 of
33,790) to 27.2% (n = 6,216 of 22,871;

 P , 0.0001) in the TEST cohort. The
percentage of NONTEST beneficiaries
with partial/no SMBG acquisition in-
creased from 22.3% (n = 84,935 of
380,904) to 22.7% (65,329 of 287,957;
P = 0.0002).
Survival Probability Associated With
Full Versus Partial/No SMBG Acquisition
Four-year survival was negatively asso-
ciated with partial/no SMBG acquisition
or no SMBG record in both cohorts (P ,
0.0001) (Fig. 1). In both study groups,
mortality was higher among beneficia-
ries with full SMBG acquisition in 2010
who migrated to partial/no SMBG ac-
quisition or no SMBG record in 2011
compared with maintaining full SMBG ac-
quisition: TEST, 11.5 vs. 6.6%; NONTEST,
11.7 vs. 6.2%. However, mortality at
4 years was lower among beneficiaries
with partial/no SMBG acquisition or no
SMBG record in 2010 but migrated to full
SMBG acquisition in 2011: TEST, 8.2%;
NONTEST, 7.2%. Similar associations
were seen in propensity score–matched
analysis.
Change in SMBG Acquisition Channel
A notable shift in SMBG acquisition from
the mail-order to retail channel was
seen in the TEST cohort but not the
NONTEST cohort (Fig. 2).
Impact of Migration From Full to
Partial/No SMBG Acquisition
As presented in Table 2, propensity
score–matched analysis showed that
the percentage of beneficiaries who mi-
grated from full SMBG in 2009 to partial/
no SMBG in 2010 was similar in both the
TEST and NONTEST groups. However, the
percentage of TEST group beneficiaries
who migrated from full SMBG in 2010
to partial/no SMBG in 2011 increased
58.1% (P , 0.0001), whereas the per-
centage of NONTEST beneficiaries who
migrated from full to partial/no SMBG
decreased 14.4% (P , 0.0001). More-
over, mortality was significantly higher
among both TEST and NONTEST benefi-
ciaries who migrated from full SMBG ac-
quisition to partial/no SMBG acquisition.
The disproportionate migration between
groups was associated with 42 additional
deaths within the TEST cohort, which was
likely due to the increased number of
beneficiaries who migrated from full to
partial/no SMBG acquisition. Within the
TEST market, migration from full SMBG
to partial/no SMBG was associated with
sex (female), ethnicity (black), and ob-
structive pulmonary disease and heart
failure, whereas no significant associa-
tions between sex, ethnicity, or comor-
bidities were seen in the NONTEST
cohort (Table 3). Mortality among TEST
beneficiaries who migrated from full to
partial/no SMBG in 2011 was significantly
associated with chronic kidney disease,
whereas atrial fibrillation was more pre-
dictive of mortality among NONTEST ben-
eficiaries (Table 3).
More than twice as many inpatient
hospital admissions were seen among
TEST beneficiaries who migrated from
full to partial/no SMBG acquisition com-
pared with NONTEST beneficiaries (P ,
0.0001) (Fig. 3A). Inpatient costs were
also more than twice as high for TEST
versus NONTEST beneficiaries who mi-
grated to partial/no SMBG acquisition
(P , 0.0001) (Fig. 3B).
CONCLUSIONS
Findings from our retrospective, longi-
tudinal analysis of the CMS data set
demonstrate that our hypothesis re-
garding the potential benefits of the
CBP to Medicare beneficiaries was in-
correct. The results indicate that the sys-
tem implemented to reduce cost was
associated with a disruption of acquisi-
tion of SMBG supplies as shown by the
shift in SMBG acquisition channels (from
mail order to retail) and significant in-
crease in the percentage of beneficiaries
in the TEST group versus NONTEST group

 who migrated from full SMBG to partial/no
SMBG acquisition during the first year of
CBP implementation. As discussed, sex
(female) and ethnicity (black) were signifi-
cantly associated with migration. More-
over, this migration was associated with
an increase in mortality, an increase in
inpatient admissions, and higher inpatient
costs. Because full SMBG acquisition was
strongly associated with better clinical out-
comes compared with partial/no SMBG ac-
quisition, these findings are particularly
concerning, given the predominant use of
short-acting insulin and rapid-acting insulin
analogs by Medicare beneficiaries, who are
at significantly greater risk for hypoglyce-
mia than younger individuals with insulin-
treated diabetes (3,4).
We are troubled that CMS failed
todetectthese“unintended”consequences
and, instead, reported that the pilot

 program was a success (10) but without
comment on the impacts we discovered in
our analyses. In this regard, it is notewor-
thy that our findings are somewhat sup-
ported by a separate report by the
Government Accountability Office to Con-
gress (13). The Government Accountabil-
ity Office reported that the monitoring
methods used by CMS in assessing the
impact of competitive bidding did not
show directly whether beneficiaries re-
ceived the DME needed on time, or
whether health outcomes were caused
by problems accessing the CBP-covered
DME (13), thereby calling the CMS find-
ings into question.
A key strength of our study design was
use of longitudinal analysis. This approach
allowed us to measure the occurrence of
change in SMBG acquisition behaviors and
subsequent outcomes at the individual
level, providing the opportunity to observe
individual patterns of change (14). When
the goal of monitoring patient safety is to
identify and assess the causal effect of cer-
tain treatments or interventions (e.g., CBP)
on the outcome, longitudinal studies are
preferred over nonlongitudinal ones
in which the temporal order of treatment
and outcome may be unclear (15), as seen
intheCBPreporting.Bycomparingchanges
in health behaviors (e.g., acquisition of di-
abetic testing supplies) and attributable
risks (e.g., mortality, hospitalizations, and
costs), the impact of exposure to CBP can
be estimated (16). Use of the propensity
score analysis allowed us to identify an
equivalent control group (17), thereby
facilitating a true “apples-to-apples” com-
parison between beneficiaries who were
affected by CBP and those not affected.
Several limitations of our analysis are
noteworthy. Because the CMS data only
provided information about SMBG
supply acquisition by beneficiaries, it
was not possible to link outcomes with
actual utilization of SMBG. Another lim-
itation is the lack of data provided by
CMS regarding the causes of hospitaliza-
tion. Moreover, the CMS records pro-
vided no information regarding the
socioeconomic or educational charac-
teristics of the beneficiaries. These
data would have facilitated more re-
fined propensity score matching and al-
lowed us to determine if these factors
confounded our comparisons between
the TEST and NONTEST beneficiaries.
Nevertheless, use of propensity score
matching confirmed that changes in
SMBG acquisition did occur and that
the subsequent increases in mortality,
hospitalizations, and hospitalization
costs were likely related to implementa-
tion of the CBP within the TEST markets.
Specific causes of disruption and mi-
gration to partial/no SMBG acquisition
could not be determined from the CMS
data; however, several potential reasons
can be suggested, including loss of pre-
vious supplier, difficulty in securing a
new supplier (13,18), and violations of
the Medicare Improvement Patient Pro-
tection Act (14), which prohibits suppliers
from switching products from one brand
to another (13). Monitoring supplier com-
pliance with the antiswitching provisions
is impossible because all Medicare claims
for diabetes test strips are billed using
one HCPCS code (A4253) regardless
of brand. This lack of transparency
creates a situation in which clinicians
may be unaware of the SMBG systems
their patients are using due to “switch-
ing” from branded to low-cost products,
causing a “disconnect” between clini-
cians and patients, which increases
the potential for inadequate patient
training, resulting in more testing inac-
curacies (19). This, in turn, could discour-
age SMBG use at prescribed levels.
Additionally, because the program may
have made it difficult for many beneficia-
ries to continue using the SMBG systems
they were familiar with, it is possible that
these beneficiaries reduced or discontin-
ued their SMBG due to lack of training
and/or lack of confidence in the accuracy
of their new SMBG system (20).
Although the unintended conse-
quences of CBP implementation in the
TEST markets are alarming, the potential
impact of the nationwide implementa-
tion of the program raises even greater
concerns. When CMS implemented the
national launch of the CBP for SMBG
supplies in July 2013, reimbursement
for test strips was reduced from approx-
imately $35.00 to $10.41 per bottle of
50 strips when acquired through both
mail-order and retail channels. This re-
duction may dissuade many pharmacies
(especially independent pharmacies)
from providing SMBG supplies to Medi-
care beneficiaries, which could further
impact testing frequency among all
Medicare beneficiaries. In a 2013 survey
of more than 300 community pharma-
cists, 92% of respondents reported that
the sharp reduction in payment for di-
abetes test strips would force them to
leave the program (21).
It is not known whether this potential
disruption of access has already im-
pacted patient adherence to their test-
ing regimens; however, the significant
reduction in reimbursement for test
strips will likely increase migration from
compliance to noncompliance to a higher
level than seen in the TEST markets
as more beneficiaries become unable to
obtain their current brand of SMBG sup-
plies from retail channels. Moreover,
because the CBP requires suppliers to
resubmit bids every 3 years, the disrup-
tion seen in the TEST markets could be
perpetual unless CMS initiates more
effective monitoring protocols that
safeguard beneficiaries.
In human clinical trials, investigators
have an ethical obligation to monitor
the safety of study participants and ter-
minate the study immediately when-
ever risk to patients is detected (22),
as was done in the ACCORD trial, which
was stopped prematurely because of
higher mortality in the intensive treat-
ment arm compared with that in the
Figure 3—Impact of migration from full SMBG acquisition in 2010 to partial/no SMBG acquisition
in 2011 on hospital admissions and inpatient costs. The increased migration to partial/no SMBG
in TEST was associated with more than twice as many inpatient admissions (A) and more than
twofold increase in inpatient costs (B) compared with NONTEST beneficiaries who migrated from
full to partial/no SMBG acquisition.

 standard treatment arm (23). Given the
prospective approach taken in imple-
menting competitive bidding, CMS should
be held to the same safety monitoring
standards as other clinical trials. As such,
based on our findings, policy makers
should consider suspending the CBP until
CMS can demonstrate its ability to effec-
tively monitor the effects of the program
and ensure that Medicare beneficiaries, a
population that is most vulnerable to both
the acute and chronic complications of di-
abetes, are protected from harm.
