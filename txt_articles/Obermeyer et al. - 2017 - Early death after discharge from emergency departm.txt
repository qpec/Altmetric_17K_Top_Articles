Early death after discharge from emergency departments: 
analysis of national US insurance claims data
Ziad Obermeyer,1,2,3 Brent Cohn,3 Michael Wilson,1,3 Anupam B Jena,2 David M Cutler4 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To measure incidence of early death after discharge 
from emergency departments, and explore potential 
sources of variation in risk by measurable aspects of 
hospitals and patients.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
setting
Claims data from the US Medicare program, covering 
visits to an emergency department, 2007-12.
PartiCiPants
Nationally representative 20% sample of Medicare fee 
for service beneficiaries. As the focus was on generally 
healthy people living in the community, patients in 
nursing facilities, aged ≥90, receiving palliative or 
hospice care, or with a diagnosis of a life limiting 
illnesses, either during emergency department visits 
(for example, myocardial infarction) or in the year 
before (for example, malignancy) were excluded.
Main OutCOMe Measure
Death within seven days after discharge from the 
emergency department, excluding patients transferred 
or admitted as inpatients.
results
Among discharged patients, 0.12% (12 375/10 093 678, 
in the 20% sample over 2007-12) died within seven 
days, or 10 093 per year nationally. Mean age at death 
was 69. Leading causes of death on death certificates 
were atherosclerotic heart disease (13.6%), myocardial 
infarction (10.3%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (9.6%). Some 2.3% died of narcotic overdose, 
largely after visits for musculoskeletal problems. 
Hospitals in the lowest fifth of rates of inpatient 
admission from the emergency department had the 
highest rates of early death (0.27%)—3.4 times higher 
than hospitals in the highest fifth (0.08%)—despite 
the fact that hospitals with low admission rates served 
healthier populations, as measured by overall seven 
day mortality among all comers to the emergency 
department. Small increases in admission rate were 
linked to large decreases in risk. In multivariate 
analysis, emergency departments that saw higher 
volumes of patients (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence 
interval 0.81 to 0.86) and those with higher charges for 
visits (0.75, 0.74 to 0.77) had significantly fewer 
deaths. Certain diagnoses were more common among 
early deaths compared with other emergency 
department visits: altered mental status (risk ratio 4.4, 
95% confidence interval 3.8 to 5.1), dyspnea (3.1, 2.9 to 
3.4), and malaise/fatigue (3.0, 2.9 to 3.7).
COnClusiOns
Every year, a substantial number of Medicare 
beneficiaries die soon after discharge from emergency 
departments, despite no diagnosis of a life limiting 
illnesses recorded in their claims. Further research is 
needed to explore whether these deaths were 
preventable.
Introduction
A growing number of patients visit emergency depart-
ments every year: nearly 20% of the US population 
each year,1  or 400 visits per 1000 population in the 
UK.2 As a result, the decision to admit or discharge a 
patient from the department is made hundreds of thou-
sands of times a day.
Errors in this decision can take two forms, each with 
different implications for patients and the healthcare 
system. One error is avoidable admission to hospital—
that is, admission of patients who could be managed 
safely and effectively in other settings. This issue has 
been studied extensively, given its importance for 
healthcare costs.3-6  The other error is avoidable harm—
that is, discharge of patients who would have benefitted 
from further monitoring or treatment as inpatients. This 
issue has received comparatively little attention, despite 
its importance for patient safety, outside of studies on 
specific diagnoses (such as myocardial infarction,7-10 
 
subarachnoid hemorrhage11-13) comprising a small per-
centage of emergency department populations.
Prior studies have suggested that the deaths of patients 
who die shortly after discharge from an emergency 
department could potentially be avoidable if they result 
from unanticipated deterioration. These efforts have 
yielded valuable insights into patient  
characteristics 
What is already knoWn on this topic
Hospitals vary widely in how often emergency department patients are admitted to 
hospital, but it is unclear how this relates to patient outcomes
Small studies point to non-trivial numbers of patients who die unexpectedly after 
discharge home from the emergency department, but these studies rely on 
individual chart reviews or data from single health systems
It is difficult to assess generalizability of these findings or to shed light on how 
variation across hospitals might shape the quality and safety of emergency care
What this study adds
A substantial number of Medicare patients, over 10 000 every year, die soon after 
discharge from US emergency departments, despite relatively young age and no 
evidence of previous life limiting illnesses
Hospitals with lower admission rates, lower costs, and lower patient volumes had 
significantly higher rates of death after discharge, despite serving healthier overall 
patient populations
There is a particular clinical “signature” of discharge diagnoses from emergency 
departments linked to short term deaths, especially syndromic diagnoses not 
involving pain, like altered mental status, dyspnea, and malaise and fatigue

linked to early death, such as atypical presentations of 
acute illnesses14 
15  or injuries in the elderly.16  This is 
timely given increasing attention to the issue of diagnos-
tic error.17-20
Existing studies, however, rely on painstaking review 
of individual charts or data from single health systems. 
This makes it difficult to assess generalizability of find-
ings or to understand the incidence of early death after 
discharge nationally. Nor can such studies shed light on 
how variation across hospitals might shape the quality 
and safety of emergency care. A key example here is 
variation in the rate of inpatient admission from an 
emergency department: while this metric is commonly 
used to assess the extent of low value hospital care,6 
21 
22 
it has not, to our knowledge, been shown to affect 
patient outcomes.
To fill this gap, we performed the first nationally rep-
resentative study of early death after discharge from an 
emergency department in patients living in the 
 
community, using US Medicare claims linked to death 
certificates. Clearly, administrative data cannot offer 
conclusive evidence on whether such deaths resulted 
from error. Instead, we hoped to identify clinical and 
health systems factors linked to potentially unexpected 
death as a starting point for future study. Understand-
ing of these sentinel events will become increasingly 
important as policy and quality incentives drive health 
systems to reduce rates of admission to hospital from 
the emergency department.
Methods
study population and outcome
From a nationally representative 20% sample of Medi-
care claims, we identified fee for service beneficiaries 
with visits to emergency department in 2007-12.23 We 
excluded those with nursing facility claims in the 
month before their visit to focus on active patients liv-
ing in the community who were attending the depart-
ment for acute problems. Table A in appendix 1 provides 
further details.
Our primary outcome was death within seven days 
after discharge from emergency departments, as in prior 
studies.14-16 
24 
25 People admitted as inpatients, transferred 
out of the department, or discharged to palliative care or 
a hospice were ineligible for the outcome. In many US 
emergency departments, patients who require a period of 
observation for diagnostic testing or monitoring are billed 
under a specific “observation status.” These patients are 
subsequently discharged or formally admitted as inpa-
tients, and, for the purposes of this study, we classified 
patients by this ultimate disposition (that is, admitted or 
discharged). Observation can happen either in units 
based in the emergency department or in other hospital 
departments; as Medicare claims did not distinguish by 
location, we considered these together. Seven day mortal-
ity was chosen based on the assumption that discharged 
patients were deemed to be at low risk of acute deteriora-
tion, such that no immediate testing or treatment was 
required, and they would be able to return to care if they 
worsened. Discharged patients should thus resemble 
generally healthy patients, with similarly low baseline 
risk of mortality, and early death would be a potentially 
unanticipated adverse event—though by no means evi-
dence of error or poor care.
life limiting illnesses
Of course, in patients with known life limiting illnesses 
diagnosed in the emergency department or before, 
death after discharge could have been fully anticipated: 
poor prognosis can limit utility of admission, or patients 
might simply prefer to avoid admission. We attempted 
to exclude such visits in several ways. First, we excluded 
beneficiaries aged ≥90, who often have incurable condi-
tions26  and DNR (“do not resuscitate”) or “do not hospi-
talize” orders.27  Second, we excluded those with any 
claims for hospice or palliative care over the year before 
visits. Given the fee for service structure of the US 
healthcare system, providers have a strong incentive to 
report all patient encounters to insurers; thus it is 
 
traditionally assumed28 (though difficult to verify) that 
nearly all care is captured in claims. This assumption 
applies only to formally coded encounters and would 
not identify patients who were tacitly rather than for-
mally receiving care oriented to palliation.
As a result, it is likely that such coarse criteria alone 
are insufficient for identifying patients with a poor 
prognosis. We thus also broadly excluded discharged 
patients with conditions that, when diagnosed, implied 
provider awareness of potentially poor near term prog-
nosis and thus a deliberate decision to discharge 
despite known risk of mortality. To do so, we convened 
a panel of three emergency physicians to identify diag-
noses indicating life limiting disease: chronic condi-
tions diagnosed in the year before visits—for example, 
malignancies—and acute conditions diagnosed in the 
emergency department typically requiring inpatient 
management—for example, myocardial infarction (see 
table B in appendix 1). We did not exclude acute condi-
tions for which outpatient management is reasonable in 
appropriately risk stratified patients—for example, 
pneumonia.29 30 Initial inter-rater agreement (κ) was 
0.81. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Descriptive analyses
After estimating incidence of early death after discharge 
over the study period, we determined cause of death by 
linking claims to death certificates. This was last possi-
ble in 2008, after which the Medicare administration 
disallowed linkage. We thus used the subset of 2007-08 
visits (n=3 197 209) to tabulate cause of early deaths 
after discharge (n=4273); deaths from 2009-12 were 
excluded from these analyses. While these data are 
often inaccurate for assigning specific cause of 
death,31 32  they can be useful for ascertaining broader 
categories of causes.33
Hypothesis testing
We explored several hypotheses regarding potential 
sources of variation in early mortality rates.
Temporal variation—We hypothesized that risk of 
mortality would vary over the year after visits to an 
department, with the influence of care most apparent

soon after visits, and the influence of patients’ under-
lying conditions more or less constant over the year. 
As observed evolution of risk might itself vary as a 
function of hospitals’ admission rates (calculated as 
fraction of Medicare patients admitted, similar to pre-
vious studies that used Medicare data as a proxy for 
hospital level metrics34-36), we inspected trends sepa-
rately by fifth of admission rate. We then calculated 
weekly mortality for discharged and admitted 
patients, excluding hospitals with <100 visits annu-
ally because of unstable rates.
Hospital level variation—We explored additional 
potential correlates of early mortality at the hospital 
level, focusing on the first week after discharge. We 
investigated correlation of risk with urban versus rural 
location and by academic status based on data from the 
American Hospital Association. As hospital case mix 
could affect both early death after discharge and early 
death after admission, we explored correlations of hos-
pital factors with both.
To more systematically explore factors linked to 
early death after discharge, we regressed our outcome 
on two sets of variables: first, hospital level factors 
including location, annual Medicare volume of the 
emergency department (that is, by number of Medi-
care visits to emergency departments by hospital year, 
calculated from the 100% inpatient and outpatient 
files), and the amount charged by the hospital for the 
visit, as a measure of the complexity and amount of 
care delivered. Second, we controlled for case mix 
across hospitals by including demographics, eligibil-
ity for Medicaid (a proxy for low income), mean 
income at postal code level, patient comorbidities over 
the year before visits,37 and fixed effects for year, sea-
son, and weekend. As only discharged patients could 
experience the outcome, we also controlled for hospi-
tal admission rate. We clustered standard errors by 
hospital.
Our first analysis included all patients presenting to 
emergency departments—that is, both discharged or 
admitted—to determine which factors, among all 
patients seen in the department, were associated with 
early death after discharge? We also present an alterna-
tive strategy, in which we included only discharged 
patients. This answers a different question: among 
patients whom doctors decided to discharge, which 
factors are associated with higher risk? This is appeal-
ing because only discharged patients are eligible for 
the outcome; its disadvantage lies in selecting patients 
for inclusion based on physician judgment, which 
might vary across hospitals. This limits generalizability 
to all emergency department patients and also means 
that departments with higher rates of admission were 
under-represented, which could bias coefficients. We 
thus view the first model as preferable.
Diagnostic variation—Finally, we hypothesized that 
risk of death after discharge would vary across 
grouped38 diagnoses in the emergency department. We 
calculated risk ratios by diagnosis (primary discharge 
diagnosis for discharged patients, admitting diagnosis 
for admitted patients), comparing diagnosis incidence 
among early deaths after discharge with incidence 
among all other visits.
statistical packages
All analyses were performed in Stata (version 14.0; 
StataCorp) and R (version 3.2.3; Foundation for Statisti-
cal Computing).
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation 
or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate 
the results of the research to study participants or the rel-
evant patient community. Our interest in poor short term 
outcomes after ED visits, however, was informed by 
patients’ priorities, experiences, and preferences.
Results
Descriptive analyses
In a nationally representative 20% sample Medicare 
beneficiaries, we identified 28 086 293 visits to an emer-
gency department over 2007-12. We excluded 12 091 966 
(43%), mostly because of life limiting illnesses diag-
nosed in the department (such as acute myocardial 
infarction) or illness diagnosed in the year before the 
visits (such as malignancy); age ≥90; and non-fee for 
service (see fig A in appendix 2). Table 1 shows baseline 
characteristics of remaining visits, of which 37% 
involved admission or transfer of the patient.
Among those discharged, 0.12% (12 375/10 093 678, in 
the 20% sample over 2007-12) died within seven days or 
10 093 per year nationally. Average age at death was 69; 
50.3% were men, and 80.9% were white. There were 
small decreases in rates of early death after discharge 
from 2007-12, 4-5% annually (fig B in appendix 2).
Death certificates identified atherosclerotic heart dis-
ease (13.6%), acute myocardial infarction (10.3%), and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9.6%) as most 
common causes of death. Figure 1 shows top causes of 
death and their antecedent diagnoses on discharge. 
Narcotic overdose was the eighth most common cause 
of death (2.3%); the most common antecedent dis-
charge diagnoses were back pain (15%) and superficial 
injuries (10%).
temporal variation
Figure 2 shows the evolution of weekly risk of mortality 
over the year after emergency department visits, by fifth 
of rate of admission from department to inpatient. 
Among admitted patients, mortality was highest in the 
first weeks in all hospitals, then declined rapidly. 
Among discharged patients, by contrast, evolution of 
risk varied by admission rate. In hospitals in the highest 
fifth of admission rates, discharged patients had low 
mortality soon after discharge compared with the 
remainder of the year. In hospitals in the lowest fifth of 
admission rates,  
conversely, discharged patients had 
higher—not lower—early mortality; rates then declined 
over the course of the year.

Hospital level variation
Figure 3 focuses just on mortality in the first week after 
visits to an emergency department and its association 
with hospital level admission rate. Among discharged 
patients, mortality declined non-linearly with increas-
ing admission rate. Hospitals in the lowest fifth of 
admission rates discharged 85% of patients, compared 
with 44% in the highest fifth (1.9 times more, 95% con-
fidence interval 1.9 to 1.9). But the seven day mortality 
rate after discharge in hospitals in the lowest fifth was 
far higher: 3.4 times (0.27% v 0.08%; 95% confidence 
interval 3.3 to 3.3). Rural hospitals were over-repre-
sented in the lowest fifth of admission rates (33% v 17% 
of all hospitals), but most hospitals in this fifth were 
simply urban or suburban non-academic hospitals. 
Academic hospitals had high median admission rates 
(39%) and lower early death rates (0.06%).
Was this trend simply caused by bias? If emergency 
departments with low admission rates served sicker 
populations, discharged patients would have higher 
mortality rates—but this would reflect higher overall 
mortality rates from baseline patient factors, not 
because of care in the emergency department. Crucially, 
in this scenario, admitted patients in these hospitals 
should also have higher mortality. Thus inpatient mor-
tality rates can help detect potential biases among dis-
charged patients.
Figure 3 shows that inpatient mortality followed the 
exact opposite trend than expected if results were 
driven by baseline mortality rates. Hospitals with the 
lowest admission rates had inpatient mortality 3.4 
times lower (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 3.7) than the 
highest. When we combined admitted and discharged 
patients, overall seven day mortality rates for all comers 
to emergency departments were 71% lower in the hospi-
tals with the lowest versus highest admission rates (0.3 
v 1.0, 95% confidence interval 69% to 71%). Thus it 
seems unlikely that baseline population differences 
alone explained higher early death rates among hospi-
tals with low admission rates.
Table 2 shows factors linked to our outcome via mul-
tivariate logistic regression, adjusted for demographics, 
comorbidities, time trends, and hospital admission rate 
(table C in appendix 1 gives the full results). Those who 
died early were older, more likely to be white and male, 
and lived in poorer areas. Hospitals with higher Medi-
care volumes had significantly fewer deaths (odds ratio 
0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.85). Patients 
who visited hospitals with higher emergency depart-
ment charges were significantly less likely to die (0.75, 
0.74 to 0.77) versus all other visits; this coefficient was 
reversed (1.39, 1.32 to 1.36) in model 2 (including only 
discharged patients), probably reflecting higher com-
plexity of deaths versus other discharged patients. Oth-
erwise, models were similar.
Diagnostic variation
Figure 4 shows risk ratios for early death after discharge 
for the 20 most common diagnoses in the emergency 
department, calculated as the ratio of incidence of diag-
nosis among deaths versus all other visits (admitted 
and discharged). Patients with syndromic diagnoses 
like altered mental status (relative risk 4.4, 95% confi-
dence interval 3.8 to 5.1), dyspnea (3.1, 2.9 to 3.4), and 
malaise and fatigue (3.0, 2.9 to 3.7) had the highest 
risks, followed by diagnoses for which patients at low 
risk can be managed as outpatients: congestive heart 
failure (1.8, 1.7 to 2.0), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (1.6, 1.5 to 1.8), and pneumonia (1.6, 1.5 to 1.8). 
Interestingly, those with chest pain had among the low-
est risks (0.8, 0.8 to 0.9).
Discussion
In this national analysis, we found that over 10 000 
Medicare beneficiaries each year died within seven days 
after being discharged from emergency departments, 
despite mean age of 69 and no obvious life limiting ill-
nesses. For context, these deaths accounted for 1.7% of 
all non-hospice deaths in the Medicare fee for service 
population annually (see table D in appendix 1). Vari-
ability in mortality rates across hospitals was striking: 
hospitals with low patient volumes and lower admis-
sion rates had the highest rates of early death, and 
small increases in admission rates were linked to large 
decreases in risk—despite the fact that hospitals with 
low admission rates served emergency department pop-
ulations with lower overall near term mortality.
These data should not be viewed as evidence of error. 
Indeed, some of the variation in outcomes we identified 
could be linked to the geographic and socioeconomic 
context of emergency care. First, access to resources

varies dramatically across hospitals. For example, to 
admit patients from the emergency department in hos-
pitals without dedicated internists staffing inpatient 
beds (hospitalists), emergency physicians must identify 
willing primary care physicians. These clinicians in 
turn must take time away from their busy schedules to 
make rounds on inpatients. The barriers imposed by 
such arrangements, in addition to a lack of consistent 
access to specialist consultation or diagnostic resources 
in the emergency department (such as cardiac ultraso-
nography, computed tomography), could contribute to 
worse outcomes in poorer hospitals and patients (T Put-
nam, personal communication, 2015). Second, patients 
attending emergency departments with higher mortal-
ity after discharge probably differed in important ways 
that we could not measure. For example, poor benefi-
ciaries eligible for Medicaid can access taxi vouchers to 
facilitate follow up, but such transportation is generally 
far less accessible in rural areas, making patients less 
likely to obtain any scheduled follow-up care (T Put-
nam, personal communication, 2015). Importantly, 
while these factors can make sudden death more likely, 
they do not make it either unavoidable or any less tragic 
for patients and families.
What are the practical implications of these results? 
Clearly, not all patients can or should be admitted. But 
in low volume hospitals with low admission rates, and 
in patients with specific discharge diagnoses, seven day 
mortality levels were not trivial. While our study could 
not determine whether admission would prevent these 
deaths, it is possible that additional testing or monitor-
ing—whether via admission, monitoring at home, or 
expedited outpatient follow-up—could have benefitted 
at least some patients.
This observation perhaps raises more questions than 
answers and thus suggests several important directions 
for future research. First, focused clinical audit studies 
of high risk patients at high risk hospitals could identify 
opportunities to improve systems of care—rather than to

assign blame to individual providers.39  Second, pro-
spective clinical studies of specific presenting symptoms 
could be conducted, modeled on the original literature 
on missed myocardial infarction in patients with chest 
pain.7-10  We identified a particular “signature” of clinical 
diagnoses linked to early death after discharge: those 
with non-pain syndromes (such as dyspnea) were at 
highest risk, especially compared with pain syndromes 
(such as chest pain), as those with were cardiopulmo-
nary diagnoses (such as pneumonia). It is tempting to 
engage in speculation here: patients in pain might com-
mand more physician attention than patients with 
vague symptoms, or specific low cost diagnostic tests 
(such as troponin concentration) or clinical pathways 
(as for chest pain) might play a role. Ultimately, how-
ever, careful prospective studies are the only way to elu-
cidate the mechanisms underlying these findings. A 
third important line of research concerns gaps in knowl-
edge on the value of hospital admission itself. Despite 
clinical decision rules for deciding on inpatient versus 
outpatient management of specific illnesses,29  there is 
little evidence on the benefits of admission for nearly all 
emergency department patients. Economic analyses are 
needed to gauge the cost effectiveness of admission, bal-
ancing potential improvements in outcomes against 
cost. Generating such evidence need not involve ran-
domized trials, but rather could exploit existing, plausi-
bly random variation in the healthcare system to 
measure the benefit and cost of admission for different 
patient groups.40 The role of financial incentives must 
also be explored: while all patients in this study were 
insured, supplementary insurance could increase the 
likelihood of admission and thereby decrease the risk of 
early death after discharge.
Finally, our results also have implications for ongo-
ing policy efforts to reduce unnecessary admissions 
from the emergency department.41  Unless extreme care 
is taken with selection of patients, these well inten-
tioned efforts could put patients at risk. Policies 
designed to reduce overuse, whether in the setting of 
National Health Service budget constraints in the UK or 
the Affordable Care Act in the US, could exacerbate this 
problem. Novel metrics to track patient safety and diag-
nostic error—which are otherwise under-represented in 
existing quality measures17—are urgently needed to aid 
policy makers in evaluating how changes in the broader 
healthcare system impact patient outcomes.
limitations
We used Medicare claims because of their broad cover-
age of US hospitals and the populations they serve. But 
claims data cannot conclusively identify preventable 
errors in care. Rather, our aim was to present the first 
national data on early death after discharge and to 
identify clinical and health systems factors linked to 
higher risk. We see this effort as a starting point for 
future research on patient safety in emergency depart-
ments, which has been surprisingly under-researched 
outside of specific diagnoses comprising a small 
minority of patients (such as myocardial infarction, 
stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, appendicitis).
We attempted to focus on potentially unexpected 
deaths by restricting our study to younger generally 
healthy patients living in the community with good 
overall prognoses. A particularly difficult task was 
exclusion of beneficiaries with diagnosed life limiting 
illnesses, in whom death was not unexpected. As there 
was, to our knowledge, no prior literature on this topic, 
we developed a list of ICD codes for this study: acute life 
threatening conditions diagnosed in the emergency 
department or chronic conditions diagnosed in the year 
before visits. While it was based on the judgment of 
experienced emergency physicians, this list was neces-
sarily subjective. We attempted to be conservative, but 
some life limiting comorbidities might be omitted; alter-
natively, excluded diagnoses could be viewed as overly 
broad. For example, we excluded any beneficiaries with 
claims indicating any malignancy in the year before 
emergency department visits because cancer stage can-
not be reliably determined from claims42 ; but this might 
exclude patients with good overall prognoses. Likewise, 
exclusion of pulmonary embolism might exclude seem-
ingly low risk patients deliberately sent home from 
emergency departments. Finally, given differences in 
coding intensity and access to end of life care, patients 
in less well resourced areas might have been less likely 
to be excluded by these criteria; this is symptomatic of 
a broader, and as yet unsolved, problem with risk 
adjustment in administrative data.43

Some deaths might have reflected “baseline” mortal-
ity after discharge from the emergency department. We 
view this as unlikely given observed variation in risk of 
mortality over time and across hospitals. Hospitals 
with higher admission rates seemed better able to tri-
age high risk patients into hospital admission, rather 
than discharging them home: discharged patients had 
lower early mortality rates after visits than over the 
remainder of the year, while inpatients had higher 
early mortality. In lower admission rate hospitals, con-
versely, high risk patients were less likely to be admit-
ted and more likely to be sent home. Such discharged 
patients had a far higher mortality in the days after 
visits than subsequently, while inpatients had a far 
lower early mortality than other hospitals. Together, 
these trends argue that early death after discharge was 
not simply a reflection of baseline mortality rates. 
Interestingly, this also suggests that hospitals with 
high admission rated do not admit indiscriminately: if 
high acuity inpatients were diluted with healthy 
patients who could have been discharged, inpatient 
mortality would fall, not rise, with admission rate 
(unless these hospitals were also killing their inpa-
tients at dramatically higher rates).
Conclusion
Many Medicare beneficiaries die shortly after discharge 
from emergency departments, despite no obvious life 
limiting illnesses recorded in their claims. Hospitals 
with low admission rates and low patient volumes, and 
patients with high risk diagnoses at discharge, could 
represent targets for clinical research and quality 
improvement efforts.
We thank David Peak for participating in the expert panel to classify 
groups of ICD codes into acute and chronic life limiting diagnoses and 
for his thoughtful advice on this project; and Tim Putnam for providing 
extremely valuable insights into emergency care in rural hospitals.
