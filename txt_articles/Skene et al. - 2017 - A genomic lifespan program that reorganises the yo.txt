Abstract The genetic mechanisms regulating the brain and behaviour across the lifespan are
poorly understood. We found that lifespan transcriptome trajectories describe a calendar of gene
regulatory events in the brain of humans and mice. Transcriptome trajectories defined a sequence
of gene expression changes in neuronal, glial and endothelial cell-types, which enabled prediction
of age from tissue samples. A major lifespan landmark was the peak change in trajectories
occurring in humans at 26 years and in mice at 5 months of age. This species-conserved peak was
delayed in females and marked a reorganization of expression of synaptic and schizophrenia-
susceptibility genes. The lifespan calendar predicted the characteristic age of onset in young adults
and sex differences in schizophrenia. We propose a genomic program generates a lifespan calendar
of gene regulation that times age-dependent molecular organization of the brain and mutations
that interrupt the program in young adults cause schizophrenia.

Introduction
Identifying the genetic mechanisms that underpin brain ageing across the lifespan may provide
explanations for the maturation of behaviours and age of onset of diseases. Longitudinal studies
show cognition, emotion and personality emerge progressively during childhood and adolescence,
with executive functions peaking in early adulthood (Craik and Bialystok, 2006; De Luca et al.,
2003). This coincides with the onset of some of the most devastating psychiatric disorders, most of
which arise during later stages of brain development in the teenage years and early twenties
(Kessler et al., 2007). For example, impulse-control disorders arise in late childhood and early teen
years, substance abuse peaks in the early twenties, and schizophrenia in the mid-twenties (with a
delay of around two years in females) (Ha
¨fner et al., 1993). Some monogenic neurological disorders
also have early adult onset, such as Inclusion Body Myopathy associated with Paget disease Fronto-
temporal Dementia (Watts et al., 2004) and rapid-onset dystonia Parkinsonism (Brashear et al.,
2012).
Why some brain disorders with a strong genetic component have a late developmental onset is
unknown. The prevailing hypothesis for schizophrenia proposes that an early (fetal) insult or mutation
renders the brain vulnerable to a secondary environmental insult that occurs in young adults, which
then triggers the onset of psychosis (Bayer et al., 1999). However, the finding that the age of onset
for schizophrenia has a heritability estimated at 33% (Hare et al., 2010), suggests that the timing
may have a genetic basis. In recent years, there has been major progress in understanding the
genetic basis of schizophrenia with the identification of many mutations and variants contributing to
disease susceptibility. It is widely accepted that many mutations directly impact on synapse proteins,

 Singh et al., 2017). The postsynaptic proteome of excitatory synapses is physically organised into
multiprotein complexes of which the supercomplexes assembled by PSD95 (Husi et al., 2000;
Frank et al., 2016a; Frank and Grant, 2017; Frank et al., 2017) play a major role in regulating cog-
nitive functions (Migaud et al., 1998; Nithianantharajah et al., 2013) and are disrupted by schizo-
phrenia mutations (Pocklington et al., 2015; Fromer et al., 2014; Ferna
´ndez et al., 2009a;
Singh et al., 2017; Kirov et al., 2012; Purcell et al., 2014). Together these observations suggest
there may be genetic mechanisms that account for the convergence between the many schizophre-
nia susceptibility genes, the postsynaptic proteome and the young adult brain.
Transcriptome profiling of the brain at different ages has shown complex changes in expression
levels across the lifespan (Colantuoni et al., 2011). In early onset brain disorders, such as intellectual
disability and autism, gene expression levels in fetal and early postnatal development correlate with
enrichment in autism susceptibility genes (Willsey et al., 2013; Parikshak et al., 2013). However,
correlation based approaches (Willsey et al., 2013; Parikshak et al., 2013; Gulsuner et al., 2013)
(e.g. weighted gene coexpression network analysis) are unable to account for the full complexity of
transcriptional changes that occur with age. Furthermore, although there has been extensive charac-
terisation

(Alexander and Goldman, 1978; Shaw et al., 2006; Gogtay et al., 2004, 2006; Zehr et al., 2006;
Woo et al., 1997; Huttenlocher, 1979; Anderson et al., 1995; Bourgeois et al., 1994;
Kalsbeek et al., 1988; Klingberg et al., 1999), the relevant transcriptome changes remain to be
identified.
To further understand the transcriptional events underlying brain development and ageing, we
developed new tools that identify age-dependent gene regulatory events. These methods detect
when gene expression trajectories change direction or plateau: we refer to these events as Tran-
scriptome Trajectory Turning Points (TTTPs) (Figure 1). The timing of TTTPs has been shown to be
an important feature of transcriptome trajectories during maize embryo development and the yeast
cell-cycle: in both systems, genes with linked biological functions were found to turn/plateau at simi-
lar time points (Lee et al., 2002; Spellman et al., 1998). We have characterised TTTPs in the neocor-
tex of humans and hippocampus of mice across their respective postnatal lifespans. This revealed a
eLife digest In our lifetime, we go through many changes – physically and also intellectually. At
certain ages, we are particularly vulnerable to develop psychiatric disorders, and the majority of
mental conditions start to manifest in teenagers and young adults. The symptoms for schizophrenia,
for example, a mental health disorder in which patients often experience hallucinations, delusion or
changes in behavior, typically start in the mid-twenties.
Schizophrenia tends to run in families and it is likely that different combinations of faulty genes
that affect the connections between nerve cells increase the chance of having the disease. Until now,
scientists have assumed that certain situations and environmental factors trigger the condition, but it
was unknown if genes could influence the age at which the disease will begin.
To explore whether genes in the brain change at certain time points, Skene et al. examined how
the genes are turned on and off across the lifespan of healthy mice and humans. The results showed
that in both mice and humans, a ‘genetic lifespan calendar’ controlled every cell type in the brain
and directed the way they worked at different ages. The timing was so precise that it was possible
tell the age of a mouse or a person simply by looking at the way the genes were expressed in a
tissue sample.
Skene et al. then studied how the genetic lifespan calendar controlled the genes damaged in
schizophrenia, and found that the calendar caused a major reorganization of the genes at the time
when the symptoms started. This suggests that the genetic lifespan calendar is a crucial factor that
can determine at what age the disease will start.
The next step will be to study how the genetic lifespan calendar programs changes throughout
the brain and to explore if it could be manipulated to change how the brain ages. This could help to
develop new types of treatments for schizophrenia and other conditions of the brain.

 previously unknown, species conserved, gene regulatory program. These methods were also used
with single-cell transcriptomes to define the age-dependent sequence of changes in neuronal, glial
and endothelial cell-types. Our data suggest that the late onset of some psychiatric and neurological
disorders is timed by mutations in this genetically programmed developmental sequence. Our find-
ings also indicate that misregulation in the molecular maturation of synapse proteomes during a crit-
ical window in young adults is important for the onset of schizophrenia. These methods and findings
open new areas of investigation into the genetic regulation of brain age and highlight their impor-
tance in the adolescent and young adult.
Results
Quantifying expression trajectories
As shown in the schematic diagram (Figure 1a), genes can be categorised according to their age-
dependent profile of expression into simple trajectories (monotonic, upward or downward gradients)
or complex trajectories that contain a Trancriptome Trajectory Turning Point (TTTP), marking both
the direction of change and the age at which it occurs. Following a TTTP, the expression may reverse
direction or plateau. We systematically identified gene expression trajectories by fitting cubic splines
and marking TTTPs where the first derivative dE/dA, (E = expression level and A = Age) of the inter-
polated trajectories equals zero and changes sign. Next, to take into account the extent of expres-
sion changes prior to the TTTP (DE), and thereby emphasise those genes for which the TTTP
represents a significant regulatory event, we developed two complementary methods (DeGeT, Dec-
ile-based Gene Turning; ALiGeT, Age-Linked Gene Turning). The DeGeT method depicted in
Figure 1b is conceptually the simplest: the lifespan is divided into ten age groups within which an
approximately equal number of TTTPs occur; each gene then receives a score for each age group
(DE if the gene turns within that age window, and zero otherwise). The ALiGeT method depicted in
Figure 1c extends this to generate a score for each year of age, by decaying the contribution of DE
the greater the distance between the TTTP and the scored year (example trajectories and associated
ALiGeT scores are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The reason for using two scoring
methods is that some age periods have many TTTPs and others have few: DeGeT controls for this by
balancing the number of TTTPs within age groups (and thereby has greater power to detect enrich-
ments in earlier/later life stages), while ALiGeT scoring allows for the possibility that small time win-
dows will have distinct molecular associations. Together, the TTTP, DeGeT and ALiGeT methods
provide general purpose tools for exploring age-dependent gene regulation.
Brain expression trajectories in human and mouse
We first applied these methods to the Braincloud dataset, which measured mRNA expression levels
from 269 prefrontal cortex samples across the human lifespan (14th gestational week to 78 years).
Although TTTPs were identified across the lifespan, they were sharply concentrated during early
adulthood. Summing the number at each age shows a striking peak and a mean of 26.0 years in

trajectories (A, shown in red; turns at 23 years of age and has a greater fold change than B, shown in blue, which
turns at 33 years). The change in expression (DE) prior to the turning point is denoted as a and b for trajectories A
and B respectively. (b) The DeGeT scoring system generates a score for each of 10 groups of ages, where each
group contains a similar number of TTTPs. Trajectory A receives a DeGeT score of a in the age group spanning 23
years and zero in all other ages. Similarly, trajectory B receives a score of b only in age group 30–35. (c) The
ALiGeT scoring system generate a score for each year of age and decays the contribution of DE as a function of
distance from the TTTP (see dotted ALiGeT scores that peak at a and b and rapidly decay at ages either side of
this peak).

 males and 27.5 years in females (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p=0, Figure 2a, example trajectories
with different turning points shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Prominent peaks in early
adulthood were confirmed with three regression methods (cubic splines with three degrees of free-
dom, four degrees of freedom and Loess regression) (Figure 2b). Removing X-chromosome genes
from the analysis had no effect on this sex difference (p=0). To determine whether this TTTP-peak
was human specific, we performed an equivalent analysis using transcriptome data from the hippo-
campus of 186 mice of both sexes between 58 and 600 days of age (Figure 2—figure supplement
2): this also revealed a peak in the frequency of TTTPs with a mean of 156 days for male and 165
days for female mice (p<1�10�323, Figure 2c). Although there is a lack of previous research on the
age equivalence of early adulthood between rodents and humans, our results are concordant with
estimations made using the TranslatingTime species comparison model which suggests that p156 (5
months) is equivalent to human early adulthood based on equivalent levels of cortical synaptic matu-
ration (Pinto et al., 2015; Pinto et al., 2013; Workman et al., 2013). Plotting the cumulative distri-
bution of TTTPs across the lifespan further illustrates the TTTP-peak in young adults (Figure 2d,e),
and shows that 90% of TTTPs occur by 40 years of age, corresponding to the last stages of human
brain development (De Luca et al., 2003; Lebel et al., 2012; Wood et al., 2004) and 7 months of
age in mice. These data indicate that despite greatly differing lifespans, these two mammalian spe-
cies share a lifespan program of brain gene expression with conserved features.

 To characterize the features of the human TTTPs in more detail, we focussed on those genes that
showed the greatest changes. As shown in Figure 2f, the TTTPs for genes with the greatest expres-
sion changes prior to the TTTP were concentrated around the late-twenties, reinforcing the earlier
finding that this is a significant period for switching in the trajectories. Next, we separated genes
into those with upward or downward trajectories prior to the turning point: overall there were similar
numbers in each category, although there was a skew toward upward inflecting genes being more
common in young subjects (<25 years) and downward inflecting genes more common in older sub-
jects (>40 years) (Figure 2g). Finally, we examined the direction of the trajectories after the TTTP by
dividing genes into those that established a stable plateau (Post-Turn Plateau) or reversed their
direction (Post-Turn Reversal) (Figure 2h). The vast majority of probes had plateaued by 30 years of
age. While the exact ages at which TTTPs occur is sensitive to both the regression method and the
dataset used, it is clear that the TTTP-peak reveals a major molecular reorganisation in young adults
towards the end of development. Together these findings show that young adulthood is a crucial
time for switching brain gene expression and establishing the set points of most genes for later life.
Even though there are major changes during brain maturation in young adults, the complex tra-
jectories were found throughout the lifespan, suggesting they could be used to predict the biologi-
cal age of the brain. To test this, we used radial basis support vector machines and demonstrated
that classifiers trained on partitioned subsets of the gene expression data (training sets) predicted
age in the test sets with an accuracy (defined as mean |AgeActual�AgePredicted|) in humans of 5.5
years and 28 days in mice. Remarkably, they showed accurate age predictions across the entire
range of ages in both species (human, R2 = 0.88, mice, R2 = 0.94) (Figure 2i,j) using only 40 probes
in humans and 100 in mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Thus, TTTPs and trajectories are highly
characteristic features defining brain age across the lifespan in mice and humans. This indicates a
‘genetic lifespan calendar’ of transcriptome events is a conserved feature of mammals.
Cell type changes throughout the lifespan
To ascertain the biological processes affected by the TTTPs, we first sought to identify the cell types
affected at each age. We asked if the TTTPs were enriched in the transcriptome of specific cell types
using brain single-cell RNA-seq data and the Expression Weighted Cell-type Enrichment (EWCE)
method (Skene and Grant, 2016). TTTPs were binned into approximately equal sized age-groups
(similar to the DeGeT method) and then tested for cellular enrichments (Figure 3a). We assumed
that different biological processes could be associated with up/down-regulated genes and so per-
formed enrichment analyses for each direction separately. To ensure the findings were robust, the
analysis was performed on both the Braincloud (Colantuoni et al., 2011) dataset and an indepen-
dent
human
prefrontal
cortex
transcriptome
dataset
(Somel
et
al.,
2009)
(see
Materials and methods). Significant enrichments were found for each cell-type tested and these
were strongly correlated between the two datasets (Figure 3a, median correlation of enrichments
for each cell-type and direction with at least one significant change between the two datasets was
0.37). The majority of significant enrichments were found amongst the Upward (Figure 1a) gene sets
relative to the Downward trajectory gene sets.
A striking sequence of events was observed where each cell type was regulated within distinct
age-windows (Figure 3a and summarised in Figure 7). Early postnatal life was marked by TTTPs in
endothelial cells (pBonferroni
braincloud=0.025, pBonferonni
somel
<0.00001 where ‘Bonferroni’ indicates a Bonferroni-
adjusted
p-value)
and
oligodendrocytes
(pBonferroni
somel
=0.015);
followed
by
microglial
genes
(pBonferroni
braincloud<0.00001, pBonferroni
somel
<0.00001) throughout adolescence; then pyramidal neuron genes
(pBonferroni
braincloud=0.0216, pBonferroni
somel
<0.00001) in early adulthood (corresponding to the peak in turning
points); then interneuron (pBonferroni
somel
<0.00001) and oligodendrocyte genes through the late twenties
and thirties (pBonferroni
braincloud<0.00001, pBonferroni
somel
<0.00001). Astrocytes were found to have two periods of
enrichment, the first during early adulthood (pBonferroni
somel
=0.0028) and a second very late in life
(pBonferroni
braincloud=0.00675, pBonferroni
somel
<0.00001). These enrichments reveal the sequential maturation of cellular
processes in the brain across the human lifespan. Moreover, most of these changes occurred prior
to 35 years of age with prominent neuronal changes in young adults.
We also performed this analysis on the mouse hippocampal dataset (Figure 3b). As in the human
neocortex datasets we found an early adulthood enrichment for upward-turns in pyramidal neuron

Neuroscience
 genes (pBonferroni
mouse
=0.008), followed by a later enrichment for downward-turns in genes associated with
both pyramidal and interneurons (pBonferroni
mouse
=0.006 and, pBonferroni
mouse
=0.0086 respectively). Unlike in the
human datasets, upward-turns in interneuron genes were found to be enriched at the same ages as
those in pyramidal neurons (pBonferroni
mouse
=0.025). This may be because the earliest samples in the mouse
ageing dataset were 56 days whereas the human datasets included fetal samples: correspondingly
the early life enrichments for upward-turns in microglia and endothelial cells were not seen in mice.
A later enrichment for upward-turns was seen in endothelial cells in mice (pBonferroni
mouse
=0.048). These
findings show that the enrichment of neuronal genes in the early adult peak is conserved across spe-
cies and brain regions.
Synaptic mechanisms in young adults
The young adult peak in TTTPs is a prominent landmark and we next sought to identify the key
molecular mechanisms involved. We used ALiGeT to identify the top 10% of genes in both human
and mouse in the year in which the largest number of TTTPs occurred (and refer to this as the Peak
Gene Turning (PeGeT) score) (Supplementary files 1a and 1b). The relevant biological processes in
the genes with high PeGeT scores, conserved between mouse and human (Supplementary file 1c),
were first examined for enrichment in Gene Ontology terms: this revealed their role in synaptic trans-
mission (pFDR�adj=0.00024 where ‘FDR-adj’ indicates the p-value was adjusted for False Discovery
Rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg method). Mammalian Phenotype Ontology annotations indi-
cated their roles in behavioural (p=7.5�10�05) and nervous system (p=0.0002) phenotypes. To probe
the synaptic role in more detail, we examined genes coding for proteins in the human postsynaptic
density (hPSD) (Baye
´s et al., 2011) and the postsynaptic PSD95 supercomplexes (Husi et al., 2000;
Frank et al., 2017; Ferna
´ndez et al., 2009b; Frank et al., 2016b), which are crucial in controlling
synaptic plasticity and behaviour: both sets showed significantly higher PeGeT scores than expected
by chance (p<0.0009 and p=0.0019 respectively, Figure 4a,b, Supplementary file 1d).
To establish the age window when synaptic genes showed TTTPs, we used a bootstrapping
approach to test whether synaptic genes have higher ALiGeT scores in particular years in the Brain-
cloud dataset. Each year between 22 and 33 years of age showed a significant increase in synapse-
associated ALiGeT scores and we refer to this as the ALiGeThPSD window. A replication study (Somel)
using a smaller human transcriptome dataset (Somel et al., 2009) gave an overlapping estimate for
the synaptic ALiGeThPSD window at 17–22 years (Figure 4c). We next applied the DeGeT method
and found all five consecutive age sets from 24 to 36 years were significantly enriched in hPSD genes
(Figure 4d). This result was confirmed in two independent human frontal cortex datasets
(Somel et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2011) (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Similarly, we identi-
fied the ALiGeTmPSD window in mice at 126 to 151 days (Figure 4e). These data show that tran-
scripts encoding postsynaptic proteins were significantly enriched in TTTPs during early adulthood in
all four datasets tested, spanning two species and two brain regions.
Since these transcriptome results suggest that specific changes occur in the composition of com-
ponents of the synapse proteome, we performed relative quantitation by mass spectrometry on 38
forebrain synaptosome samples between 1–5 months in mice. A total of 900 proteins were detected,
of
which
99
were
found
to

(Supplementary
file
1e,
pFDR�adj<0.005). We explored which functional classes of synapse proteins were affected by ageing
during this period, and found that ion channel proteins and receptors showed increased likelihood
of being differentially expressed (pFDR�adj=0.00034, expected = 7, actual = 17, Figure 4f). Amongst
the affected channels were the majority of Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPases detected in our dataset,
including three of the subunits of Atp2b (often referred to as PMCA). This finding recapitulates and
extends the previous reports that aged rodents have decreased Ca2+- and Na+/K+- ATPase activity
(Zaidi et al., 1998; Tanaka and Ando, 1990). These proteomic findings support the transcriptome
findings that changes in synapse proteome composition occurs within the young adult age window.

TTTPs may be relevant to the age of onset of schizophrenia. For these analyses we examined

 multiple sets of publically available genetic data including de novo and GWAS data (see Materials
and methods ‘Genes Lists’, Supplementary file 1f) and applied multiple analytical approaches.
As a first step, we applied the same bootstrapping approach used earlier for the PSD genes on
the pooled set of genes which have been associated with Schizophrenia using either GWAS or de
novo approaches. Strikingly, this analysis showed the TTTPs in susceptibility genes predicted the
known age windows for the onset of schizophrenia (Figure 5). The ALiGeTscz enrichment window
spanned 22–26 years (Figure 5a) corresponding to the clinically reported age of onset defined by
the first episode of psychotic symptoms and window of maximum vulnerability (Kessler et al., 2007;

¨fner et al., 1993). Since males are reported to have an earlier disease onset than females
(Kessler et al., 2007), we tested males and females separately and found the ALiGeTscz enrichment
window was significantly earlier in males than females (males 20–26 years, females 26–28 years; wil-
coxon p=4.7�10�14, Figure 5b).
To validate these results, we performed a series of technical control studies and biological replica-
tions. First, we used the DeGeT scoring system that showed the enrichment in schizophrenia peaked
at 24–26 years (Figure 5c). Secondly, we performed the DeGeT enrichment test in the two indepen-
dent human frontal cortex datasets (Somel et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2011) and confirmed that
schizophrenia was significantly enriched (confirming the Braincloud result) (Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 1). Thirdly, to confirm the results were not specific to a particular spline regression method,
we demonstrate that enrichment window for schizophrenia was found using two alternate

 approaches to model fitting (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). While validating the occurrence of
the disease enrichments, this analysis also revealed that the exact age at which the turning points/
windows of enrichments occur depends on the regression model used (Figure 5—figure supple-
ment 2). Fourth, we performed a down-sampling based sensitivity analysis to determine how the
size of the gene set influences the enrichment: this indicated that the DeGeT enrichments are stron-
ger for schizophrenia than for the hPSD (using subsets of 650 genes, 95% of schizophrenia subsets
were significant at 24—25 years but only 50% of hPSD subsets, Figure 5—figure supplement 3).
Fifth, we performed a variation of the bootstrapping analysis which accounts for transcript length
and GC content (both of which are known to affect the rate of de novo mutations) and found no
effect on the significance of the results (Figure 5—figure supplement 4). Sixth, we confirmed that
varying the parameter in the ALiGeT scoring function, which controls the rate of decay with temporal
distance, did not adversely affect the results (Figure 5—figure supplement 5). Finally, we dropped
all fetal samples from the analysis, recalculated the TTTPs and confirmed that the major peak of
TTTPs occurs in the early twenties, that it is delayed in females, that the later DEGET windows are
enriched for PSD genes, and that schizophrenia shows discrete and significant enrichments using
DEGET (Figure 5—figure supplement 6).
To further validate our findings, we next examined different genetic datasets that have been
used to identify schizophrenia susceptibility genes. The ALiGeTscz analysis results described above
used a combined schizophrenia gene set from three orthogonal genome-wide methods: (1) an inte-
grative analysis of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), expression analysis, copy number var-
iants (CNV) and mouse models (Ayalew et al., 2012); (2) combined results of three exome-
sequencing studies (Fromer et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2012; Girard et al., 2011), and (3) the most
recent GWAS results from the Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Disease Consortium
(Schizophrenia

(Supplementary file 1f). We therefore separately tested sets of susceptibility genes discovered with

stronger enrichment seen with de novo mutations may reflect that GWAS detects common variants
that are assumed to have lower penetrance (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium, 2014). We also validated the results using an additional set of de novo
mutations (Gulsuner et al., 2013): this also confirmed the adult enrichments, either when analysed
independently or when combined with the combined sets described above (Figure 5—figure sup-
plement 7).

 Much of the heritability for schizophrenia is associated with SNPs that have not reached genome-
wide significance with current sample sizes (Loh et al., 2015) (and were not included in our analysis
thus far) and the sample sizes for de novo studies are too small to determine whether any genes
found are significantly associated with disease status. We therefore adapted our methods to include
a greater fraction of the SNPs associated with schizophrenia heritability by using association statistics
from all SNPs regardless of whether they are genome wide significant (as defined in GWAS summary
statistics files) and explicitly modelling linkage disequilibrium (based on results of the 1000 genomes
project), such that disease association scores can be ascertained for each gene. The ALiGeT and
DEGET approaches were extended to directly utilise the gene association scores generated by
MAGMA (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation) (de Leeuw et al., 2015) based on schizo-
phrenia GWAS summary statistics. Using this approach, schizophrenia showed a DEGET enrichment
at 26 years in the Braincloud dataset (pBonferroni=0.03135, Figure 5h) and at 15—16 years in the Somel
dataset (pBonferroni=0.0115, Figure 5—figure supplement 8a) and corresponding enrichment windows
were found using ALiGeT (Figure 5i, Figure 5—figure supplement 8b).
Finally, we performed two additional sets of analyses where we examined mouse proteome data-
sets and single-cell transcriptome data. Consistent with the transcriptome results, the mouse syn-
apse proteomic dataset showed that schizophrenia-associated proteins were enriched in the synapse
proteins that changed prior to the 5 month peak (p=0.018, expected = 6, actual = 11), and 91% of
those that change were found to be down-regulated. Next, we examined the role of specific cell
types in schizophrenia by restricting the ALiGeT analysis to the subsets of genes defined by single
cell transcriptome data (see Materials and methods) (Zeisel et al., 2015). Schizophrenia associated
genes showed a significant (pBonferroni<0.05) window of enrichment in neuronal genes (Figure 6a, Fig-
ure 6—figure supplement 1). We were however unable to confirm this result using the summary
statistics based method (Figure 6b). We then examined the types of trajectories associated with
schizophrenia and found genes were predominantly down-regulated prior to the TTTP (Figure 6c).
This result was confirmed using the summary statistics based method (Figure 6d).
Together these analyses show robust replication across multiple datasets, including different
types of genetic variants, transcriptomes and proteomes, and several complementary analytical
approaches. These data strongly suggest that the window of onset and sex difference in schizophre-
nia is timed by the regulation of susceptibility genes in young adults.
Synapse proteome and adult-onset neurological disorders
In the mouse synapse proteome dataset, we noticed several proteins that cause adult onset mono-
genic disorders. We used the Human Phenotype Ontology age-of-onset annotations to identify
these neurological disorders (excluding neoplasms, and peripheral/autonomic disorders) and from a
total of 39 genes, six were detected in our samples, and we confirmed these were significantly
enriched amongst the synapse proteins whose expression levels changed during maturation
(p=0.00008, expected = 1, actual = 4, Figure 6—figure supplement 2, Supplementary file 1e). The
affected proteins/disorders included Atp2a2 (Darier’s disease), Eef2 and Itpr1 (Spinocerebellar
ataxia), Atp1a3 (Dystonia Parkinsonism). No equivalent enrichment was found for congenital/neona-
tal onset disorders (p=0.45, expected = 4, actual = 4). Further inspection (because HPO annotations
were incomplete) found three additional, adult-onset haploinsufficiency disorders encoding by genes
showing a 50–80% reduction in the maturing mouse synapse proteome (Figure 6—figure supple-
ment 2): Vcp (Frontotemporal Dementia) (fold change, FC = 0.48; p=0.002); Atl1 (hereditary spastic
paraplegia) (FC = 0.19, p=0.00004); Dmxl2, (Polyendocrine-polyneuropathy syndrome) (fold change:
0.28, p=0.00004). These age-dependent reductions in levels of haploinsufficient disease genes is
consistent with the model that their respective lifespan trajectories are relevant to their age of
onset.
Prefrontal cortex early adult turning points are not associated with
other polygenic brain disorders
The possibility exists that the lifespan trajectories are also relevant to the age of onset of other poly-
genic diseases with onset at different ages. To address this we compiled gene lists for six other
major brain disorders with different age-windows of onset: onset during infancy (autism and intellec-
tual disabilities); early adulthood (multiple sclerosis); and late adulthood (Amyotrophic Lateral

 Sclerosis, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s) (corresponding gene sets shown in Supplementary file 1f).
We applied the same bootstrapping approach used earlier for the PSD genes and none of the disor-
ders showed significant results (Figure 6—figure supplement 3). Because these gene lists are not
comparable (different size, population sample size, obtained using different technical approaches
etc.) the relative importance of the genetic calendar to schizophrenia cannot be directly compared
with these disorders (see Discussion). In addition, because the transcriptome data is from prefrontal
cortex and the primary pathology of several of these diseases is in other parts of the nervous system
it cannot be assumed that the transcriptome trajectories in one part of the brain are the same as in
Figure 6. Trajectories of schizophrenia associated genes show further distinctions in their cell-type and trajectories. (a) Schizophrenia susceptibility

 others. Hence, the lack of any detectable age window does not preclude a role for gene regulation
in the onset of these diseases.
Discussion
Understanding gene expression in the human brain during the phases of childhood, adolescence,
young adulthood, middle and old age, is a fundamentally important area of biology with medical sig-
nificance. We focussed on identifying age-dependent gene regulatory events that were detected
when the trajectory in the level of gene expression changed. Studying the transcriptome trajectories
across the lifespan of the human neocortex and mouse hippocampus showed that TTTPs occurred at
all ages. Moreover, because these events were a defining characteristic of every age, we found that
actual age could be predicted by examination of an RNA sample from mouse and human brain tis-
sue. These findings indicate there is a ‘genetic lifespan calendar’ that sets the date for gene expres-
sion changes in both species. This conclusion complements previous epigenomic studies that show
DNA methylation correlates with chronological age (Horvath, 2013). The most striking and unex-
pected feature was the peak of TTTPs in young adult humans at 26 years of age and 5 months of
age in mice. In both species, this peak was delayed in females and involved similar sets of genes.
Moreover, in both species there was a similar sequential pattern of cell-type specific changes across
the lifespan. Thus, we conclude that mammals with greatly differing lifespans share a conserved
genomic program regulating the sequence of cellular and synaptic changes throughout the lifespan.
We discovered that the young adult brain undergoes a dramatic reorganisation of gene expres-
sion, as revealed by the TTTP-peak around 26 years, and this reorganisation is largely completed by
40 years of age when ninety percent of trajectories have plateaued. These findings correspond well
with anatomical data showing that development and myelination in the frontal cortex is over
(Lebel et al., 2012) by this age. The TTTP-peak was enriched in neuronal and synaptic genes
expressed in pyramidal and interneurons including those encoding PSD proteins and the 1.5 MDa
PSD95 supercomplexes (Figure 7). This indicates that young adults undergo a major reorganisation
of their synapse proteomes, which was supported by proteomics results in mice. The level of expres-
sion of many PSD and PSD95 supercomplex proteins are known to be important for many innate
and learned behaviours and we also found that the TTTP-peak was enriched in behaviourally impor-
tant genes. Thus the genetic calendar can modify synapse proteome composition and potentially
shape the behavioural repertoire across the lifespan.

indicates the enrichment in relevant genes. The TTTP-peak in young adults (vertical dotted lines show approximate boundary) coincides with synaptic
and neuronal changes and schizophrenia genetic susceptibility. Changes in glial cells overlap with the TTTP-peak and occur in distinct windows across
the lifespan.

 The TTTP windows in non-neuronal cells also corresponded well with known changes in these
cells. The early age-window in endothelial cells corresponds to the expansion and maturation of the
brain’s vasculature (Caley and Maxwell, 1970; Engelhardt and Liebner, 2014; Azmitia et al.,
2016) and post-natal shift in the transcriptome of endothelial cells (Daneman et al., 2010). There
was also an enrichment in oligodendrocyte genes early in life, potentially corresponding to downre-
gulation of genes specific to oligodendrocyte precursor cells (He et al., 2009). The next phase,
which continues through the early teenage years, involves strong upregulation of microglial genes
and coincides with synaptic pruning (Schafer et al., 2012) and preceded the young adult window of
synaptic and neuronal reorganisation.
Transcriptome trajectories and schizophrenia
To date, there has not been a satisfactory mechanism or model that accounts for the following five
central features of schizophrenia. First, the genetic susceptibility: the mechanism needs to account
for the diverse sets of genes and the diverse types of mutations. Second, the age of onset: the
mechanism needs to account for the age-window during which first-episode psychosis occurs, the
heritability of this onset, as well as the earlier presence of prodromal cognitive symptoms
(Koutsouleris et al., 2012). Third, the sex difference: females have a later onset than males. Fourth,
the cell biological mechanisms: there needs to be a common subcellular mechanism that incorpo-
rates the diverse classes of disease-relevant proteins, which include channels, receptors, synaptic
adhesion proteins, scaffold proteins and signalling molecules. Fifth, the cognitive deficits: the molec-
ular and cellular mechanisms need to play a key role in the relevant cognitive processes. A model
that satisfies these criteria would also be expected to have explanatory power for other characteris-
tics of schizophrenia.
Our findings meet all five criteria and we propose the following model. A genetic program
orchestrating transcriptome trajectories causes reorganisation of expression of synapse proteins in
young adults. Mutations in these genes are functionally exposed in young adults because the reor-
ganisation of expression produces inappropriate synapse signalling properties that result in abnor-
mal behaviour. We refer to this as the genetic calendar model of schizophrenia. This model posits
that schizophrenia is a genetic disorder targeting the mechanisms of brain aging during the young
adulthood period of the lifespan. Our model offers a mechanistic explanation for the onset of first-
episode psychosis and is consistent with prodromal cognitive impairments and the persistence of
schizophrenia beyond the young adult years (when many genes reach their plateau). Thus, the
genetic calendar model can explain the onset and progression of schizophrenia.
In addition to the robust association of schizophrenia genes with the TTTP-peak which was repli-
cated across datasets including multiple types of genetic variants, transcriptomes and proteomes,
and several complementary analytical approaches, our study identified specific molecules that fur-
ther strengthens the mechanistic link between synaptic mechanisms and schizophrenia. PSD95
supercomplex proteins are enriched in schizophrenia genes (Fromer et al., 2014; Ferna
´ndez et al.,
2009a; Singh et al., 2017; Kirov et al., 2012; Purcell et al., 2014; Grant et al., 2005). Amongst
the schizophrenia-susceptibility genes with the most prominent TTTPs were those with established
synaptic functions, including Rgs4, Snap25, Kalrn, Htr2a and Nrg1. The expression level of each of
these genes has previously been shown to either influence, or be influenced by psychiatric symptoms
(Etain et al., 2010; Guillozet-Bongaarts et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2013; Hill et al., 2006). Further-
more, altered expression of Snap25, Htr2a and Nrg1 are noted to associate with earlier age of onset
(Etain et al., 2010; Weickert et al., 2012; Abdolmaleky et al., 2011).
Neurological and early onset disorders
We found evidence that several mendelian neurological disorders with adolescent and young adult
onset also involved proteins that were down-regulated in the TTTP-peak. Heterozygous mutations in
Atp2a2 cause Darier’s disease and significantly increase the risk of many psychiatric disorders includ-
ing mood disorders, depression, and schizophrenia (Gordon-Smith et al., 2010). Mutations in Eef2
and Itpr1 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 26 and 15/29, respectively. Atp1a3 mutations cause
rapid-onset dystonia Parkinsonism, which leads to Parkinson’s-like symptoms appearing during early
adulthood, often with concurrent emergence of psychiatric symptoms (Brashear et al., 2012). Vcp
mutations cause a form of frontotemporal dementia with a mean age of onset in the mid-thirties

 (Watts et al., 2004). One of the main causes of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) are heterozygous
mutations in Atl1, which has an age of onset ~21 years (McCorquodale et al., 2011). Interestingly,
we found that the synaptic scaffold protein Dmxl2 (haploinsufficiency causes Polyendocrine-poly-
neuropathy syndrome [Tata et al., 2014]) was reduced by ~70% (fold change: 0.28, p=0.00004) and
studies in mice show heterozygous deletion of Dmxl2 in central neurons delayed the onset of
puberty (Tata et al., 2014). These findings support the view that the genetic lifespan calendar
reduces expression below a critical threshold in young adults and is important for multiple neurologi-
cal and psychiatric diseases.
Our studies relied on human prefrontal cortex transcriptome data, which may have limited our
ability to detect a role for the genetic lifespan calendar in the age-dependent onset of those dis-
eases that are known to have primary pathology in other brain regions (e.g. Parkinson’s disease).
Given the evolutionary conservation between mouse hippocampus and human prefrontal cortex, we
expect other human brain regions to show a calendar of transcriptome trajectories, but with differ-
ent patterns and therefore different age windows of disease gene enrichments. Moreover, while our
whole tissue transcriptome analysis appeared to be sensitive to neuronal changes, we expect that
future single-cell transcriptome data will provide a more detailed insight into rarer cell types and
potentially reveal mechanisms relevant to the age of onset of pathology in these cells. We do not
expect that the age of onset of all brain diseases will be accounted for by the genetic calendar, as it
will likely depend on the importance of cell autonomous processes and exogenous factors (e.g.
inflammatory processes involving microglia). It is also likely that high penetrance severe mutations
will show an earlier onset and are less likely to show a dependence on the TTTPs. Weaker alleles
may manifest with undetectable or subtle phenotypes at early ages and be exposed at later ages by
the changes in gene expression. Thus, TTTPs would not necessarily account for the age of onset of
intellectual disability
or autism even though some of the same genes are involved with
schizophrenia.
Role of genetic lifespan calendar in behavioural adaptation
The genetic lifespan calendar is an innate mechanism that regulates the levels of postsynaptic pro-
teins and hence changes the physiological and behavioural properties of brain circuits. This indicates
that the brain is not ‘hard wired’ but is continuously being modified by an evolutionary ancient and
conserved genetic program. The postsynaptic proteins control innate and learned behaviours and
thus the genetic calendar will modulate innate behaviours and the capacity to learn across the life-
span. The overarching biological function of this program could be to equip the animal for the chal-
lenges it faces at different ages.
If there are mutations that interrupt this calendar of events, then the organism will not respond
appropriately to environmental challenges. This may be relevant to schizophrenia where exogenous
factors are thought to influence onset (e.g. cannabis) or behaviour (e.g. smoking) during young
adulthood. Our model which posits a fundamental role for genetic and genomic mechanisms can
therefore accommodate previous models that have considered exogenous factors in disease aetiol-
ogy. Interestingly, environmental triggers of psychosis, such as cannabis and other drugs of abuse,
are known to act on the synaptic signalling mechanisms (Camp et al., 2011; Abbas et al., 2009)
that are being reorganised in the TTTP-peak. Our model also has implications for those schizophre-
nia models that posit a (non-genetic) fetal insult as the predisposing factor for later onset
(Brown and Derkits, 2010): the enrichments in schizophrenia susceptibility genes in young adults
was present even when fetal samples were not included in the analysis supporting the notion that it
is a disorder of postnatal brain ageing.
Our genetic lifespan calendar model may also have implications for the development of pharma-
ceuticals for the adolescent and young adult onset psychiatric and neurological disorders. As an
alternative to the ‘precision medicine’ approach which directs pharmacological treatments to each
susceptible genotype, we suggest that therapeutics accommodating many genotypes might lie in
drugs that modify the genetic lifespan calendar. The identification of the conserved TTTP-peak
between mice and humans may also assist in refining animal models of adult-onset brain disorders.
Our findings open a range of new approaches for understanding brain ageing and the mental disor-
ders afflicting young adults.

58—600 days were used for the mouse microarray dataset (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). All ani-
mal experiments conformed to the British Home Office Regulations (Animal Scientific Procedures
Act 1986; Project License PPL80/2,337), local ethical approval, and NIH guidelines. Animals were
born and raised within the Research Support Facility at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and
exposed to the same light/dark cycles and feed supply. Mice were exported to a holding facility
three days prior to collection of brain samples, to allow time for stress response genes induced
through movement to subside. All animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the hippo-
campi were dissected on ice, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
RNA preparation and microarray hybridization
Mouse brain samples were homogenised using the Kontes Cordless Pellet Pestle system. Total RNA
was extracted using the Qiagen miRNeasy kit, snap frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at
�80˚C. Microarray processing was performed by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute’s Microarray
facility. The Illumina TotalPrep-96 RNA Amplification kit was used for reverse transcription, amplifica-
tion, and biotinylation of the RNA prior to hybridisation. The microarrays used were the Illumina
MouseWG-6 v2 series. Hybridization, washing, and staining were performed according to standard
Illlumina protocol. The microarrays were imaged using the Illumina BeadArray Reader. Images from
the scanner were processed using the BeadStudio software. The microarray data is available to
download from ArrayExpress (accession number E-MTAB-3256).
Braincloud human prefrontal transcriptome dataset
The human samples were generated by the Braincloud project (braincloud.jhmi.edu) as described in
their primary publication (Colantuoni et al., 2011). In brief they used post-mortem human brains
from the NIMH Brain Tissue Collection, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders. RNA samples were described as being
extracted from ~100 mg of tissue from BA46/9, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Custom-spotted
two-colour oligonucleotide microarrays constructed from a set of oligos referred to as HEEBO7
(Human Exonic Evidence Based Oligonucleotide) were used. The preprocessed/normalized Brain-
cloud expression data was downloaded from GEO (GSE30272, data contained within the Series
Matrix file). No further normalisation was done beyond that which was already performed as
described in the Braincloud publication. Low intensity probes and outliers had already been
removed and expression levels were adjusted for sex, ancestry and a single surrogate variable using
the sva package (Leek et al., 2012).
Somel human prefrontal transcriptome dataset
The ‘Somel’ dataset used to validate the increased PeGeT/DeGeT/ ALiGeT scores of schizophrenia
genes, and EWCE enrichments, was downloaded from the GEO repository (accession GSE11512)
(Somel et al., 2009). The dataset comprised samples taken from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
which had been hybridised to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 +arrays. The dataset was read into R
using the bioconductor ‘affy’ package, and processed using RMA. Probes with detection probabili-
ties of less than 0.05 in over ten of the arrays were dropped.
BrainSpan human frontal transcriptome dataset
The BrainSpan RNA-Seq gene level dataset (Kang et al., 2011) was downloaded from the BrainSpan
website (brainspan.org) on the 21st Jan 2016. The data was read into R. Data from the following
four regions were retained: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, orbital
frontal cortex and anterior (rostral) cingulate (medial prefrontal) cortex. Ages were converted to
numerical equivilents. Any transcripts whose summed expression over all retained samples was less
than 0.1 were dropped. Because the oldest samples in the BrainSpan dataset are only 40 years of
age we treated trajectories which did not turn as turning in final year of life.

 Mouse hippocampal transcriptome dataset
The mouse microarray data was read into R using the Bioconductor package Lumi (Du et al., 2008)
(RRID:SCR_012781) and re-annotated based on a published analysis (Barbosa-Morais et al., 2010).
The detectionCall function from the lumi package was used to drop probes undetected by the
microarrays. Probes rated as having a ‘bad’ quality (according to the re-annotation package) were
dropped, as were those with the coding zone given as ‘Transcriptomic?’. A variance stabilizing trans-
formation was applied followed by quantile normalization.
Spline fitting
Natural cubic splines with three degrees of freedom were fitted to the expression data using the R
package splines. For the mouse expression data, age was modeled as the independent variable,
with sex and background as covariates. For the human expression data, as variation attributed to
the extraneous variables (sex and ancestry) had already been subtracted earlier using the sva pack-
age these terms were not included. The location of knots for the splines was determined by the
quantiles of the data. For each species and gene, trajectories were then interpolated across the life-
span with extraneous variables (sex and ancestry/background) held constant. We refer to these inter-
polated spline trajectories as Brain Transcriptome Lifespan Trajectories (BTLTs).
Detecting turning points (TTTPs)
Prior to detecting TTTPs, spline models were fitted to the data. To calculate where a TTTP occurred
in a gene’s expression trajectory (Ag), the derivative was approximated for each BTLT and the age of
the TTTP was taken as the first point where dE=dA =0 and the derivative changed sign, where E is
expression level in the spline model and A is age. If multiple turning points were found in a single
spline, then only the first was used. Figure 2a–c show the number of TTTPs found across the tran-
scriptome within a given year/month. To determine the TTTPs for each sex, all samples from the
other sex were dropped, the splines remodeled (without including sex as a covariate) and TTTPs
detected afresh.
The numbers presented for the age of the TTTP peak in paragraph six are the mean age of TTTPs
across all transcripts. To test for a difference in the age of TTTPs between the sexes, the Wilcoxon
signed rank test was used. To test whether X-chromosome genes caused the sex difference, TTTPs
in genes from that chromosome were dropped the same statistical test performed on the remaining
set, and a similarly significant probably for difference was found.
To analyse the properties of trajectories with TTTPs (for generation of Figure 2g,h), linear models
were fitted to the expression data before and after each TTTP, and tested for whether there is a sig-
nificant change. A small fraction of probes which were detected as having TTTPs were not found to
show significant differential expression prior to the TTTP, after multiple hypothesis correction with
the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (FDR = 0.05) and these were excluded from this analysis of TTTP
characteristics. We classified genes as showing post-turn plateaus if there were not detected as dif-
ferentially expressed after the TTTP with FDR = 0.05. Those that were detected as showing signifi-
cant differential expression after the TTTP, in the opposite direction to before the TTTP, are
denoted as showing post-turn reversals. To generate Figure 2f we calculated the deciles of the ages
at which TTTPs occur, and used these to split the data into ten groups with as closely matching sizes
as possible.
Scoring TTTPs
The Age-linked Gene Turning scores (ALiGeTs) were designed to represent two features: (1) proxim-
ity of the TTTP close to the target year, and (2) the changes in their expression level from the start
of the dataset (at 14th gestational week) through to the age at which the TTTP occurred (this change
is denoted as DE). A human genes ALiGeT scores for a given age (Sg;TÞ can be calculated as:
Sg;T ¼ 1:5�jAg�Tj � jDEj
Wherein
g is the index of the gene of interest
T is the year of age being queried
DE is the change in expression level prior to the TTTP

 Ag is the age of the first TTTP in gene g
For mice the equation is modified slightly to account for the difference in lifespan of the two spe-
cies. To allow the ALiGeT window to have an approximately equal width across a given proportion
of the mouse’s, we scaled the term jAg � Tj by 650/78 where 650 days represents old age for a
mouse and 78 represents old age for a human. A mouse genes ALiGeT score for a given age can
thus be calculated as:
Sg;T ¼ 1:5
�
jAg�Tj
650
78
ð Þ � jDEj
To penalize genes which are further from the peak of TTTPs, the distance between the age of
turning point (Ag) and the target age (T) is used as the exponent in an exponential expression with
base 1.5. This function gives greatest emphasis to genes with D = 0, with a rapid fall over neighbour-
ing years such that a human gene with D = 6 years have scores 9% the size of those with equivalent
pre-turn changes in expression level at D = 0. The scoring function is graphically depicted in Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 1. We show in Figure 5—figure supplement 5 that the results are stable
to variation in the exponent base.
The term PeGeT score is used to refer to the ALiGeT score for the year in which that species has
the most TTTPs.
DeGeT scoring
To score genes using the DeGeT method (represented in Figure 1b and used to generate
Figure 4d and Figure 5c) a similar scoring system was used. First ages were divided into ten groups
based on the number of genes which turn/inflect within that age period, such that each age set has
approximately equal size number of turning genes. Because there are many more TTTPs during early
adulthood than in infancy/old age, the age windows span many years at start/end of the lifespan
and
as

during

twenties.

g, the score was equal to the pre-turn expression change if the gene turns within
the age window bounded by x and y. If the gene does not turn within within the age window
bounded by x and y then the score for that gene is zero.
Cellular enrichment analysis with EWCE
Cell type enrichment analysis was performed on three datasets: Somel (Somel et al., 2009), Brain-
cloud (Colantuoni et al., 2011) and the mouse hippocampus. The EWCE (’Expression Weighted
Celltype Enrichment’) package from Bioconductor (RRID:SCR_006442) was used to perform the
enrichment with 100,000 bootstrap replicates used for each test. Age groups were assigned based
on the frequency of TTTPs across the lifespan (0—10th, 11th—20th,. . .,90th—100th percentile of all
TTTPs). The genes which turn within each age window were sorted based on the size of pre-turn
expression change. For each age window, the 10% of genes which turn within that window with larg-
est positive (upward) and negative (downward) expression changes were assigned into two groups:
we refer to these lists as the ’target’ lists. A previously published single cell transcriptome (SCT)
dataset containing cells from cortex and hippocampus was then loaded (Zeisel et al., 2015). Any
genes in the target lists which were not found to be expressed in the SCT dataset were dropped.
For the analysis with Braincloud and Somel, the background gene set was taken as all genes with
mouse orthologs that are also found in the SCT dataset for which a spline was fitted. For the mouse
hippocampus analysis, the background set contained all genes for which a spline was fitted and
which was also detected in the SCT dataset. For the directional analyses, the background set thus
contains genes which change in both directions. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multi-
ple testing. For both directions, for each cell type within each age group (indexed by r, c and a 2 A
respectively), we calculated the mean (�r;c;aÞ and standard deviation (�r;c;aÞ of the bootstrap distribu-
tion, and used this to determine the distance (in terms of standard deviations) that the target list falls
from the expected mean—we refer to this value as dr;c;a. Values were calculated separately for each
dataset. The plots shown in Figure 3 show normalised values derived from dr;c;a by dividing by the
maximal absolute value over all age windows. As a result the maximal absolute enrichment is either
1 or �1. The values plotted on the x-axis each represent one of the age windows defined by the
quantiles (specifically, the values shown are the mean of the upper and lower bounds of the

 window). The age windows for Somel and Braincloud are not fully overlapped but were annotated
with the central points of the Braincloud age windows to enable both datasets to be plotted against
each other.
Testing for increased turning point scores of PSD and disease gene sets
To determine whether gene sets show larger ALiGeT scores than expected, a boot strapping test
was performed. Genes in the target list, which were not detected as expressed on the arrays, were
dropped from the analysis. Where multiple probes target the same gene, duplicated probes with
smaller PeGeT inflection scores were dropped. For each target list being tested, ten thousand ran-
dom gene lists of the same length were generated. The mean ALiGeT/PeGeT score for the target
list and the random gene lists was calculated, and the proportion of random lists with smaller mean
scores than the target list is taken as the probability. Where multiple lists were tested for significance
against PeGeT scores, these were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (FDR = 0.05).
The same method was used for the DeGeT set based analysis method as was used for the ALiGeT
analysis, with bootstrapping being done with 10000 samples and correction for multiple testing over
age sets done with the Bonferroni method.
Figure 4a,b, Figure 5d–g, and Figure 6—figure supplement 3 represent the results of the
PeGeT bootstrapping analysis in graph form. We sought to represent the extent to which enrich-
ment results from high scores amongst either a small number of genes, or from a broad increase in
scores throughout the list. As in the bootstrapping analysis we compare the score distribution in the
target (disease/synapse) list to the scores in random lists of the same length. To keep the plot tidy
we only represent data from 100, rather than 10000 random lists. PeGeT scores for the target and
random lists were sorted by numerical size. For each of the n genes in the target list, 100 dots were
positioned with the y-axis determined by ith largest score in the target list, and the x-axis given by
the ith largest score in each of the 100 random lists. To interpret the graph, note that if the majority
of the random list scores fall above the red line, then the random lists have lower scores than the tar-
get list. It should be noted that the scales of the graph does bias the view towards the genes with
largest scores.
To perform a bootstrapping analysis which controls for gene size and GC content, we obtained
those values from biomart. Where multiple transcript lengths were associated with a single HGNC
gene we took the mean value. The deciles of gene size and GC content were calculated over the set
of expressed genes. The two sets of decile values were used to define a grid, and each gene
assigned to a position within the grid based on it’s transcript lengths and GC content. To run a boot-
strap analysis on a particular target list, 10000 random lists were constructed with equal length to
the target list. Gene i in each random list was selected from the same grid square as gene i in the
target list.
Disease gene lists
The disease gene lists are provided in Supplementary file 1f. The combined schizophrenia gene list
(results shown in Figure 5a–d, Figure 6a,b, Figure 5—figure supplement 1–5,7 and Figure 6—fig-
ure supplement 1) used genetic associations from three types of studies, which were also analysed
individually: the integrative dataset contains 42 genes assembled using a translational convergent
functional genomics approach (Ayalew et al., 2012); the de novo gene set comprised 609 genes
pooled from three studies which used parent-child trios to detect de novo mutations (Fromer et al.,
2014; Xu et al., 2012; Girard et al., 2011); the GWAS results are from the 2014 release of the
Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (Abbas et al., 2009). Many
SNPs from the GWAS study results were associated with multiple genes (349 genes were associated
with 108 loci, with numerous loci associated with over twenty genes), and these were dropped leav-
ing 62 genes to be used in our analyses (not that this does not apply to the analyses which directly
utilised the GWAS summary statistics files). The GWAS result remained significant if the alternative
approach was taken and all genes associated with SNPs were used. The additional schizophrenia de
novo gene set (the ‘Gulsuner’ set) came from exome sequencing of ‘quads and trios’ (patients, their
parents and unaffected siblings) associated with 105 individuals with the disorder (Gulsuner et al.,
2013). Two autism lists were used, both based on finding de novo mutations through exome
sequencing:

 (Iossifov et al., 2012). The 78 intellectual disability genes were discovered through de novo
sequencing of family groups (de Ligt et al., 2012). The Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic lateral scle-
rosis (Lill et al., 2011), Parkinsons (23andMe Genetic Epidemiology of Parkinson’s Disease Con-
sortium et al., 2012) and Alzheimer’s (Bertram et al., 2007) lists come from the top results of the
following websites: msgene.org (69 genes); alsgene.org (17 genes); pdgene.org (23 genes); alzgene.
org (10 genes).
ALiGeT enrichment windows
Gene list enrichments were evaluated across the lifespan by generating Sg;T for each gene, for each
value of T between 1 through 78 (Sg;T defined above). To test for disease enrichments the boot
strapping method described above was applied. Enrichment of the gene sets were calculated at
each age. The Bonferroni method was used to correct for the testing of the hypothesis at each of
the 78 years of age. When running the ALiGeT for the eight diseases Bonferroni correction was
applied across all the diseases as well as over each year of age. To obtain the sex specific datasets,
the enrichments were calculated separately on the male subset of the data, and then again on the
female subset. To test for sex differences in TTTP ages specific to disease gene sets, the age of
TTTPs associated with those genes in the male and female data subsets were compared using the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
To control for transcript length, the maximum transcript length was determined for each gene
using Biomart. As the distribution of transcript lengths is sharply peaked, ten quantiles of transcript
length were used to group the genes for display of TTTP score distributions. To control for neuron
specificity,
the
data
on
single
cell
transcriptomes
from
the
Linnarsson/Hjerling-Leffler
labs
(Zeisel et al., 2015) was utilized (data available at linnarssonlab.org/cortex/). The cell-type specificity
matrix was used to produce a metric for neuron vs glia enrichment. This was done by first calculating
neuronal expression as the sum of expression in all cells they label as ‘pyramidal’ or ‘interneurons’,
whilst glial expression was the sum of expression in ‘astrocytes’, ‘endothelial’, ‘microglia’ or ‘oligo-
dendrocytes’. The ratio of these values was taken, and classic markers checked to ensure they were
as expected (Dlg4 = 15; Camk2a = 6; Map2 = 13; Gfap = 0.2; Mbp = 0.1; Aif1 = 0.2). The 5000
genes most enriched for neurons were then used to perform an ALiGeT analysis for the combined
Schizophrenia list. To confirm that the threshold used for how neuron-specific the genes are does
not influence this result, we also show below a figure with PeGeT results using different thresholds
between 1000 and 8000 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).
To perform the analyses restricted to up/down-regulating genes depicted in Figure 6c,d all
probes which show a higher/lower expression level at the beginning of the spline, relative to the
splines value at the TTTPs are dropped. Removal of duplicate probes targeting the same HGNC
gene is performed after dropping the probes. Probes which do not have TTTPs are also dropped
from from both analyses.
Functional analysis of genes with high PeGeT scores
For the comparisons of mouse and human genes with large PeGeT scores, orthologs were deter-
mined using the Biomart package, through querying which HGNC Genes are orthologs for a given
MGI ID. To find GO terms enriched in this set of genes, the MGI symbols were analysed using
DAVID (Huang et al., 2009) against a background of mouse genes, and the GO term for ‘synaptic
transmission’ was found to be the most enriched (the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value is
stated in the text). For the analysis of phenotypes from the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology
(Smith and Eppig, 2009) (MPO), a full database of phenotypes was downloaded from ftp.informat-
ics.jax.org. Any genes which were not detected as present by the microarrays were dropped from
the MPO database, and a hypergeometric test for significance of enrichment performed on the
remainder. Enrichment for ‘behavioural’ and ‘nervous system’ phenotypes was specifically tested for,
and hence probabilities presented are not adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing.
DEGET and ALIS using genome wide summary statistics
Gene association statistics were calculated from Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) Summary
Statistics using v1.05 of MAGMA (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation) (de Leeuw et al.,
2015). MAGMA enables disease/phenotypes association scores to be calculated for each gene,

Neuroscience
 while accounting for linkage disequilibrium and the contributions from multiple SNPs. MAGMA takes
GWAS summary statistics as input: these do not contain data on the individuals from the study and
simply list the association p-values and z-scores/odds ratios for each SNP included in the study. The
1000 Genomes European panel was provided to MAGMA as reference data for calculating Linkage
Disequilibrium. The schizophrenia summary statistics are associated with the GWAS analysis per-
formed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) which found 108 genome wide significant
loci (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014); the file was
downloaded from the PGC website (https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/results-and-downloads).
DEGET enrichment was calculated by first grouping the genes into deciles based on the age of
the turning point. DEGET groups for the MAGMA method are different from those calculated for
gene list approaches for several reasons: firstly, sorting is performed using entrez gene IDs rather
than HGNC gene symbols, secondly, all genes within the extended MHC region are removed from
these analysis (as their MAGMA gene associations cannot be properly assigned due to Linkage
Disequilibrium in this region). DEGET scores were assigned to genes as they were done for the
gene set based analysis. To determine whether a given GWAS trait is enriched at a particular age,
the z-score calculated by MAGMA for each gene was multiplied by the DEGET score. Z-scores
were then shuffled 20,000 times, multiplying at each iteration with the DEGET scores, and com-
pared to the unshuffled value. The p-value is based on the frequency with which the sum of
unshuffled value is greater than the shuffled values. The same approach (multiplying ALIS scores
with MAGMA z-scores, following by perturbations of z-scores) is used to calculate ALIS enrichment
probabilities.
Age prediction
All of the human (including fetal) and all mouse samples were included in the age prediction analysis.
Age predictions were performed with radial basis function Support Vector Machines through the
e1071 package that provides an interface to libsvm in R (Chang and Lin, 2011). Two rounds of 10-
fold partitioning were used to form training, validation and test sets. An initial round of random par-
titions separated test data from training/validation data. The combined set of training/validation
data was then passed to the tune.svm() function from the e1071 package which then uses 10-fold
cross-validation to perform a parameter search. A first shallow grid search was performed for g 2
� 15; �13; . . . ; 1 3Þ and cost 2 � 5; �3; . . . ; 13; 15Þ, and the optimal pair of values selected as
(g1; cost1Þ.

and
cost 2 cost1 � 1:5; cost1 � 1:375; . . . ; cost1 þ 1: 375; cost1 þ 1:5Þ.
Probes were included in the model by first determining which probes are associated with age, as
determined using a linear model. The linear modeling of age-associated probes was repeated for
each of the partitioned sets of training/validation data; as such, data in the test set did not influence
the selection of probes through the linear model. The probes were then ranked based on the level
of association, and the top Ncutoff probes were used for training and testing. The reported accuracies
were obtained using values of Ncutoff 40 for humans and 100 for mice. To determine the appropriate
level of Ncutoff, a range of values were tested between 10 and 400, and the optimal number manually
selected on the basis of having optimal SSE without using an unnecessarily large number of probes.
PSD preparations for mass spectrometry
Crude PSD preparations were made from dissected mouse forebrain tissue from C57BL6/5J mice
ages 1 month to 5 months. In brief, each forebrain was homogenized by performing 12 strokes with
a Dounce homogenizer containing 5 mL of ice cold homogenization buffer (320 mM sucrose, 1 mM
HEPES, pH = 7.4) containing 1X Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche) and 1X Phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail set II (Calbiochem). Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 x g
for 10 min at 4˚C. The supernatant (S1) was removed and the pellet was re-suspended in 2 mL of
homogenization buffer and an additional six strokes were performed. Following a second centrifuga-
tion at 1000 x g for 10 min at 4˚C, the supernatant (S2) was removed and pooled with S1. The com-
bined supernatants were then centrifuged at 18, 500 x g for 15 min at 4˚C. The pellet was re-
suspended in 5 mL of extraction buffer (50 mM NaCl, 1% DOC, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing
1X Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche) and 1X Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail set II

 (Calbiochem) and incubated on ice for 1 hr. The resulting crude PSD extracts were centrifuged at
10,000 x g for 20 min at 4 ˚C and the resulting supernatant filtered through a 0.2 mm syringe filter
(Millipore).
Preparation of samples for LC-MS/MS
Protein concentration of PSD preparations was determined using 1X Quickstart Bradford assay (Bio-
Rad). Thirty micrograms of PSD protein was prepared to contain 1X Novex NuPAGE LDS sample
loading buffer (Invitrogen) with 100 mM DTT (BioRad), boiled for 10 min at 100˚C and loaded into 1
well of a 10-well Novex NuPAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was per-
formed under reducing conditions using the Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE system (Invitrogen) for 5
min. Gels were then stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Gel bands were excised and subjected to tryptic digestion using standard methods.
Mass spectrometry and data analysis
Five microgram of tryptic digest was analysed by LC-MS/MS using a UPLC Dionex QExactive
(Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, Massachussets, USA). Protein identification was performed with MASCOT
(Matrix Sciences) using Uniprot Mouse database (downloaded on 2014 March 24th). Label-free
quantitation analysis was then performed on all timepoints examined in the study using Progenesis
(Nonlinear Dynamics). The normalized Mass Spectroscopy dataset was read into R. Swissprot/Trembl
ID’s for each detected protein was matched to a gene symbol. Orthologs were determined using
the Biomart package, through querying which HGNC Genes are orthologs for a given MGI ID. The
data was log2 transformed. A linear model was fitted to estimate protein expression based on age
and sex using the bioconductor ‘lumi’ package. Significance of differential expression was corrected
using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
Build #85 of the Human Phenotype Ontology was downloaded from http://compbio.charite.de/
hudson/job/hpo.annotations.monthly/lastStableBuild. All diseases associated with the following HPO
terms were extracted from the ontology using Phenexplorer (compbio.charite.de/phenexplorer):
‘Neoplasm’, ‘Abnormality of the Nervous System’, ‘Abnormal peripheral nervous system morphol-
ogy’ and ‘Abnormality of the autonomic nervous system’. Using these lists all diseases associated
with neoplasms, and peripheral/autonomic disorders, and which are not associated with nervous sys-
tem disorders, were dropped from the HPO phenotype database. From the remaining dataset, con-
genital onset disorders were taken as those annotated with the following terms: ‘Congenital onset’,
‘Infantile onset’ or ‘Neonatal onset’. Adult onset disorders were annotated with either ‘Adult onset’,
‘Young adult onset’, ‘Schizophrenia’ or ‘Bipolar affective disorder’. Schizophrenia enrichment was
tested using the combined list described earlier. Enrichment analyses were performed using hyper-
geometric tests. Functional analysis was done by manually assigning a single functional category to
each of the proteins detected in the dataset. Functional annotations were based on those from a
previous paper on the synaptic proteome (Emes et al., 2008) and expanded based on Panther pro-
