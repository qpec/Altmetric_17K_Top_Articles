Characteristics of Initial Prescription Episodes and Likelihood of 
Long-Term Opioid Use — United States, 2006–2015
Anuj Shah1; Corey J. Hayes, PharmD1,2; Bradley C. Martin, PharmD, PhD1
Because long-term opioid use often begins with treatment 
of acute pain (1), in March 2016, the CDC Guideline for 
Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain included recommenda-
tions for the duration of opioid therapy for acute pain and the 
type of opioid to select when therapy is initiated (2). However, 
data quantifying the transition from acute to chronic opioid use 
are lacking. Patient records from the IMS Lifelink+ database 
were analyzed to characterize the first episode of opioid use 
among commercially insured, opioid-naïve, cancer-free adults 
and quantify the increase in probability of long-term use of 
opioids with each additional day supplied, day of therapy, or 
incremental increase in cumulative dose. The largest incre-
ments in probability of continued use were observed after the 
fifth and thirty-first days on therapy; the second prescription; 
700 morphine milligram equivalents cumulative dose; and 
first prescriptions with 10- and 30-day supplies. By providing 
quantitative evidence on risk for long-term use based on initial 
prescribing characteristics, these findings might inform opioid 
prescribing practices.
A random 10% sample of patient records during 2006–2015 
was drawn from the IMS Lifelink+ database, which includes 
commercial health plan information from a large number of 
managed care plans and is representative of the U.S. com-
mercially insured population (3). The data are provided in a 
deidentified format and the institutional review board at the 
authors’ institution deemed the study was not human subject 
research. Records were selected of patients aged ≥18 years 
who had at least one opioid prescription during June 1, 
2006–September 1, 2015, and ≥6 months of continuous 
enrollment without an opioid prescription before their first 
opioid prescription. Patients excluded were those who had any 
cancer (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer) or a substance 
abuse disorder diagnosis in the 6 months preceding their 
first opioid prescription, or whose first prescription was for 
any buprenorphine formulation indicated for treatment of 
substance abuse.
Patients were followed from the date of their first prescription 
until loss of enrollment, study end date, or discontinuation of 
opioids, which was defined as ≥180 days without opioid use. 
The duration of use and number of prescriptions and cumu-
lative dose (expressed in morphine milligram equivalents*) 
for the first episode of opioid use (defined as continuous use 
of opioids with a gap of no greater than 30 days) were calcu-
lated. The number of days’ supply and average daily dose in 
morphine milligram equivalents for the first prescription were 
also calculated. The first opioid prescription was categorized 
* Morphine milligram equivalents is a conversion factor to convert different 
opioids into an equivalent dose of morphine. http://www.pdmpassist.org/pdf/

into six mutually exclusive categories: long-acting; oxycodone 
short-acting; hydrocodone short-acting; other Schedule II 
short-acting; Schedule III–IV and nalbuphine; and tramadol.†
The Kaplan-Meier statistic was used to estimate median 
time to discontinuation of opioid use; probability of continued 
opioid use at 1 year and 3 years for different treatment duration 
thresholds (daily for 1–40 days and weekly for 1–26 weeks); 
number of prescriptions (1–15); and cumulative dose of the 
first episode of opioid use (50–2000 morphine milligram 
equivalents). Similarly, the relationship between the num-
ber of days’ supply, choice of first opioid prescription, and 
probability of continued opioid use at 1 and 3 years was also 
examined. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by modifying 
the discontinuation definition from ≥180 opioid-free days to 
≥90 opioid-free days, changing the allowable gap in the first 
episode of opioid use from 30 days to 7 days, and excluding 
patients whose average daily dose of the first prescription 
exceeded 90 morphine milligram equivalents.
A total of 1,294,247 patients met the inclusion criteria, 
including 33,548 (2.6%) who continued opioid therapy for 
≥1 year. Patients who continued opioid therapy for ≥1 year 
† The six mutually exclusive categories are 1) long-acting: buprenorphine, 
fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, and tapentadol; 2) other 
Schedule II short-acting: fentanyl, hydromorphone, levorphanol, meperidine, 
methadone, morphine, oxymorphone and tapentadol; 3) oxycodone short-
acting; 4) hydrocodone short-acting; 5) Schedule III–IV and nalbuphine: 
codeine, dihydrocodeine, butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine and 
propoxyphene; 6) tramadol.
were more likely to be older, female, have a pain diagnosis 
before opioid initiation, initiated on higher doses of opioids, 
and publically or self-insured, compared with patients who 
discontinued opioid use in <365 days (Table). Among per-
sons prescribed at least 1 day of opioids, the probability of 
continued opioid use at 1 year was 6.0% and at 3 years was 
2.9% (supplemental figure 1; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/44182) (supplemental figure 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/44550) with a median time to discontinuation of 
7 days (supplemental figure 3; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/44551). Approximately 70% of patients have an initial 
duration of opioids of ≤7 days and 7.3% were initially pre-
scribed opioids for ≥31 days. The largest incremental increases 
in the probability of continued opioid pain reliever use were 
observed when the first prescription supply exceeded 10 or 
30 days (Figure 1), when a patient received a third prescription 
(Figure 2), or when the cumulative dose was ≥700 morphine 
milligram equivalents (supplemental figure 4; https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/44552). Substantial increases in probabilities 
of continued opioid use occurred when the initial duration 
reached 6 and 31 days (supplemental figure 2; https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/44550); the findings of the sensitivity analy-
ses were similar (supplemental figures 5–10; https://stacks.cdc.
gov/view/cdc/44183).
The highest probabilities of continued opioid use at 1 and 
3 years were observed among patients who initiated treatment 
with a long-acting opioid (27.3% at 1 year; 20.5% at 3 years), 
followed by those whose initial treatment was with tramadol

* Average daily dose was calculated as total strength of the prescription expressed in MME divided by the days’ supply of the first prescription. If a patient had 
multiple prescriptions on the first day, the daily dose in MME for all the prescriptions on the index date were summed and divided by the days’ supply of the 
longest lasting prescription.
† The first prescription was categorized into six mutually exclusive categories and, in case of multiple prescriptions, on the index date using the following hierarchy 
to assign category: 1) long-acting; 2) other Schedule II short-acting; 3) Oxycodone short-acting; 4) Hydrocodone short-acting; 5) Schedule III-IV and Nalbuphine; 
or 6) tramadol.
(13.7% at 1 year; 6.8% at 3 years) or a Schedule II short-acting 
opioid other than hydrocodone or oxycodone (8.9% at 1 year; 
5.3% at 3 years) (supplemental table; https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/44181). The probabilities of continued opioid use at 
1 and 3 years for persons starting on hydrocodone short act-
ing (5.1% at 1 year; 2.4% at 3 years), oxycodone short-acting 
(4.7% at 1 year; 2.3% at 3 years), or Schedule III–IV (5.0% 
at 1 year; 2.2% at 3 years) opioids were similar (supplemental 
table; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/44181).
Discussion
The probability of long-term opioid use increases most 
sharply in the first days of therapy, particularly after 5 days or 
1 month of opioids have been prescribed, and levels off after 
approximately 12 weeks of therapy. The rate of long-term use 
was relatively low (6.0% on opioids 1 year later) for persons 
with at least 1 day of opioid therapy, but increased to 13.5% 
for persons whose first episode of use was for ≥8 days and to 
29.9% when the first episode of use was for ≥31 days. Although 
≥31 days of initial opioid prescriptions are not common, 
approximately 7% do exceed a 1-month supply. Discussions 
with patients about the long-term use of opioids to manage 
pain should occur early in the opioid prescribing process, 
perhaps as early as the first refill, because approximately 1 in 
7 persons who received a refill or had a second opioid pre-
scription authorized were on opioids 1 year later. As expected, 
patients initiated on long-acting opioids had the highest prob-
abilities of long-term use. However, the finding that patients 
initiated with tramadol had the next highest probability of 
long-term use was unexpected; because of tramadol’s minimal 
affinity for the µ-opioid receptor, it is deemed a relatively safe 
opioid agonist with lower abuse potential than other opioids 
(4). However, a report by the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration determined that emergency 
department visits associated with tramadol-related adverse 
events increased by 145% during 2005–2011 (5). Long-term

data on tramadol for pain management are sparse, with only 
one trial exceeding 12 weeks in duration (6). Despite this, 
among patients initiated with tramadol, >64% of patients who 
continued opioid use beyond 1 year were still on tramadol, 
suggesting that tramadol might be prescribed intentionally 
for chronic pain management. A 2016 study in Oregon (7), 
which did not include tramadol (a predictor of long-term use 
according to current data), reported similar findings: opioid 
naïve patients aged <45 years who received two prescription 
fills (versus one) or a cumulative dose of 400–799 (versus 
<120) morphine milligram equivalents in their first month of 
therapy were 2.3 and 3.0 times as likely to be chronic opioid 
users, respectively. However, that analysis only examined opi-
oid use in the first month after initiation of opioid therapy to 
characterize risks for long-term use and did not account for 
the actual duration of therapy.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, although the cumulative dose of the first episode 
of opioid use is described, the likelihood of long-term use 
when the prescriber was titrating the dose was not determined. 
Rather, the total cumulative dose was calculated, which might 
have been increasing or decreasing over time. Second, the 
extent to which chronic opioid use was intentional versus the 
outgrowth of acute use is not known. Less than 1% of patients 
in this analysis were prescribed Schedule II long-acting opioids 
at the outset, so intentional chronic opioid prescribing might 
be uncommon; however, approximately 10% of patients were 
prescribed tramadol, which might indicate intentional chronic 
opioid prescribing. Third, information on pain intensity or 
duration were not available, and the etiology of pain, which 
might influence the duration of opioid use, was not considered 
in the analysis. Fourth, the frequency of prescriptions having 
certain days’ supplied (e.g., prescriptions with a 7-day supply 
would be more frequently observed than those with an 11- or 
13-day supply) was not considered.  The variability in the 
relationships between days’ supply, the cumulative dose, and 
duration of first episode and the probability of long-term use 
could be affected. Finally, prescriptions that were either paid 
for out-of-pocket or obtained illicitly were not included in 
the analysis.
Transitions from acute to long-term therapy can begin to 
occur quickly: the chances of chronic use begin to increase after 
the third day supplied and rise rapidly thereafter. Consistent 
with CDC guidelines, treatment of acute pain with opioids 
should be for the shortest durations possible. Prescribing 
<7 days (ideally ≤3 days) of medication when initiating opioids 
could mitigate the chances of unintentional chronic use. When 
initiating opioids, caution should be exercised when prescribing 
>1 week of opioids or when authorizing a refill or a second 
opioid prescription because these actions approximately double 
the chances of use 1 year later. In addition, prescribers should 
discuss the long-term plan for pain management with patients 
for whom they are prescribing either Schedule II long-acting 
opioids or tramadol.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Based on the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic 
Pain, literature supporting long-term opioid therapy for pain is 
limited; research suggests an increased risk for harms with 
long-term opioid use.  Early opioid prescribing patterns for 
opioid-naïve patients have been found to be associated with 
the likelihood of long-term use.
What is added by this report?
In a representative sample of opioid naïve, cancer-free adults 
who received a prescription for opioid pain relievers, the 
likelihood of chronic opioid use increased with each additional 
day of medication supplied starting with the third day, with the 
sharpest increases in chronic opioid use observed after the fifth 
and thirty-first day on therapy, a second prescription or refill, 
700 morphine milligram equivalents cumulative dose, and an 
initial 10- or 30-day supply. The highest probability of continued 
opioid use at 1 and 3 years was observed among patients who 
started on a long-acting opioid followed by patients who 
started on tramadol.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Awareness among prescribers, pharmacists, and persons 
managing pharmacy benefits that authorization of a second 
opioid prescription doubles the risk for opioid use 1 year later 
might deter overprescribing of opioids. Knowledge that the 
risks for chronic opioid use increase with each additional day 
supplied might help clinicians evaluate their initial opioid 
prescribing decisions and potentially reduce the risk for 
long-term opioid use. Discussions with patients about the 
long-term use of opioids to manage pain should occur early in 
the opioid prescribing process.
