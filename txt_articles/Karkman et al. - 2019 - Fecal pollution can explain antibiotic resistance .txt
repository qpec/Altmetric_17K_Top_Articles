Discharge of treated sewage leads to release of antibiotic resistant bacteria, resistance genes
and antibiotic residues to the environment. However, it is unclear whether increased abun-
dance of antibiotic resistance genes in sewage and sewage-impacted environments is due to
on-site selection pressure by residual antibiotics, or is simply a result of fecal contamination
with resistant bacteria. Here we analyze relative resistance gene abundance and accom-
panying extent of fecal pollution in publicly available metagenomic data, using crAssphage
sequences as a marker of human fecal contamination (crAssphage is a bacteriophage that is
exceptionally abundant in, and specific to, human feces). We find that the presence of
resistance genes can largely be explained by fecal pollution, with no clear signs of selection in
the environment, with the exception of environments polluted by very high levels of anti-
biotics from manufacturing, where selection is evident. Our results demonstrate the necessity
to take into account fecal pollution levels to avoid making erroneous assumptions regarding
environmental selection of antibiotic resistance.

rowing concern over the threat posed by antibiotic
resistant bacteria to human health has turned attention
also to the environmental dimensions of the problem.
Only fairly recently, the role of the environment as a source and
dissemination route for antibiotic resistance has been acknowl-
edged1–3. Treated effluent from wastewater treatment plants
(WWTPs) is one of the most important point sources of resistant
bacteria and resistance genes release to the environment4,5. Along
with gut microbes, which contain a wide array of resistance
determinants6, antibiotics consumed by humans and animals are
released into the environment in urine and fecal material con-
tained in treated wastewaters and sludge applied to land.
Untreated sewage contains bacteria from human, animal, and
environmental origin and a mixture of sub-therapeutic con-
centrations of antibiotics and other co-selective agents4. For
these reasons WWTPs have been considered hotspots for
antibiotic resistance emergence and dissemination5,7. While
WWTPs are generally quite effective in removing antibiotic
resistant bacteria (ARB) and resistance genes (ARGs) from the
raw sewage8–11 they are important point sources for ARBs and
ARGs to the environment due to the large volumes released.
The receiving environments form another possible hotspot for
antibiotic resistance dissemination when bacteria originating
from sewage and fecal material come in contact with environ-
mental bacteria2.
Although a distance-decay-effect can be found from point
sources, there has been limited efforts to separate between
enrichment of ARGs as a result of simple dissemination versus
on-site selection12,13. It has been speculated that ARGs could be
selected in the receiving environment by antibiotics and other co-
selective agents originating from the WWTP, contributing to
further dissemination of ARGs to environmental bacteria3,14–16.
However, there are experimental studies (using complex micro-
bial communities) suggesting that the concentrations of selective
agents in a sewage-impacted environment might not be sufficient
to cause selection17,18 despite that competition experiments with
two strains occasionally suggest otherwise (reviewed in ref. 19). If
there is selection for antibiotic resistance either in WWTPs or
receiving environments, it could promote the emergence of novel
resistance mechanisms and the dissemination of existing ARGs. A
selection pressure would favor evolution of novel resistance
mechanisms and the maintenance of recently transferred ARGs in
the new host2.
To determine the resistance levels in WWTPs and receiving
environments several methods have been used including
selective culturing of indicator bacteria, quantitative PCR
(qPCR) of ARGs and metagenomics8–11,20,21. The class 1
integron (CL1) integrase gene has often been used as a proxy
for anthropogenic impact and total ARG abundance with good
resolution22. However, as CL1s can contain a wide array of
ARGs and, thus, can be subjected to selection themselves, they
are not an independent measure which can be used to distin-
guish between environmental selection or simple dissemination
of ARGs from fecal matter. Fecal pollution levels have rarely
been incorporated in the determination of possible selection or
dissemination of ARGs. Detecting fecal marker bacteria using
metagenomics is often difficult due to the low abundance of
common marker bacteria in the whole community23. A robust
marker for fecal pollution provides the means for distinguishing
between on-site selection and dissemination of the genes versus
accumulation and to observe decrease in ARGs which is due to
dilution of fecal pollution in the receiving environments. If
ARG abundance shows a strong and positive correlation with a
fecal marker, it would indicate that the ARG abundance could
be explained by fecal contamination alone without involving
environmental selection as an explanation, while if ARG
abundance is not well correlated with the fecal marker, it would
suggest that other processes, like selection and/or HGT, is
explaining elevated ARG abundances in addition to or instead
of fecal contamination. Therefore, taking fecal pollution into
account in models of ARB and ARG pollution from sewage
would help in determining the critical control points for anti-
biotic resistance selection by enabling distinguishing between
mere accumulation and selection.
Recently, crAssphage, a bacteriophage was identified from
human fecal metagenomes24. The phage, which infects Bacter-
oides intestinalis25, is highly abundant in the human intestine, as
~1.7% of human fecal metagenome reads align to it, and it is six
times more abundant in public metagenomes compared to all the
other known phages together24 while being rare in feces from
other animals26. It also performs equally well or better than
traditional fecal markers in qPCR assays27,28. Given its high
abundance, it can be used in metagenomic studies for estimating
the human fecal pollution levels in the environment29,30.
crAssphage has been observed to correlate with ARGs in storm
drain outfalls31 and thus, could be a good candidate for esti-
mating the effect of fecal pollution in ARG dynamics. Moreover,
it is not physically linked to resistance genes like integrons are
and hence likely not co-selected with ARGs. Still, the environ-
mental ecology of crAssphage is not fully understood and we do
not know whether it can replicate also outside the gut environ-
ment. Another fecal Bacteroides phage, ɸB124-14, has been used
for microbial source tracking but unlike crAssphage, it is also
abundant in porcine and bovine gut32, therefore making it pos-
sibly a good candidate for estimating the combined effect of
human and production animal fecal pollution.
In this study, we analyze a selected set of public metagenomes
from sewage-polluted environments and, in addition, nearly 500
metagenomes from MG-RAST. We show that in practically all
the studied environments, the ARG, CL1, and MGE abundances
correlate with fecal pollution levels with no evident signs of
selection or dissemination of the resistance genes, except in
sediments polluted with wastewater from drug manufacturing
containing exceptionally high levels of antibiotics33,34. Using fecal
samples from ref. 35 and the Integrative Human Microbiome
project (iHMP)36, we confirm the independence of mobile ARGs
and the crAssphage in feces. The latter is crucial to be detect
possible selection in environmental samples. Taken together, this
approach can help in disentangling environmental on-site selec-
tion and/or horizontal dissemination of ARGs from passive dis-
semination/enrichment by fecal pollution.
Results and Discussion
Fecal pollution and ARG patterns in sewage polluted envir-
onments. Concerns about the elevated levels of antibiotic resis-
tant bacteria and resistance genes in the receiving environments
of
treated
sewage
have
been
raised
in
several
publications3,14,16,37,38. However, relying solely on abundance
data, it is difficult to determine whether the increase is explained
by selection and dissemination of ARGs from bacteria originating
from the WWTP to environmental microbiota or by the con-
tinuous input of fecal bacteria. To elucidate this question, we
analyzed mobile antibiotic resistance genes in metagenomes from
environments with anthropogenic impact from sewage discharge
and correlated the total abundance of the mobile ARGs with a
human fecal pollution marker, crAssphage, abundance. Our
results show that the observed ARG abundances strongly corre-
late with crAssphage, meaning that the fecal pollution levels
largely explain the observed abundances and there are no clear
signs of wide scale selection or dissemination of antibiotic resis-
tance in the affected environments.

 crAssphage and ARG dynamics in human fecal metagenomes.
To determine the independence of crAssphage and mobile ARGs
in human feces, we analyzed fecal metagenomes from 74 Chinese,
234 European35, and 141 subjects from the USA (HMP) (Sup-
plementary Data 1) for ARG and crAssphage abundance. The
screening of fecal metagenomes proved that crAssphage had a
potential for revealing selection dynamics in receiving environ-
ments by correlating ARG abundance with the phage abundance
in environments with human fecal pollution. We did not find any
correlation between the ARG and crAssphage abundance in fecal
metagenomes of the studied populations (linear regression, F =
25.51, adj. R2 = 0.21, p > 0.05, Fig. 1a, Supplementary Data 2),
confirming that ARG abundance is independent from crAssphage
abundance. On the other hand, the correlation between total
ARG abundance and intI1 gene abundance was significant when
taking in to account the different base levels of ARG abundance
in the populations (linear regression, F = 20.55, adj. R2 = 0.29,
p < 0.05, Fig. 1b, Supplementary Data 2) showing the expected
dependence between ARGs and CL1s.
We observed that the crAssphage abundance was similar in all
cohorts, even though the abundance varied dramatically between
individual
subjects
(Fig.
1a).
The
uniform
abundance
of
crAssphage across the studied populations suggests that crAssph-
age could be used as a fecal pollution marker globally, which is in
line with previous observations39. However, it should be noted
that in another study, crAssphage was reported to be less
abundant in sewage from Asia and Africa compared to Europe
and US30. In our analysis, the total relative ARG abundances were
similar in US and European subjects, while the Chinese subjects
had higher relative abundance of resistance genes in their fecal
metagenomes (Analysis of variance, Tukey post-hoc test, adj. p <
0.05 for both, Fig. 1b). The higher ARG levels in Chinese subjects
compared to Europeans, using the same samples which were
analyzed in here, has been reported earlier35. Differences on
the ARG levels on population level might originate from the
historical amount of antibiotics used regionally as well as the
degree of transmission control. However, even with differences on
the initial crAssphage to ARG ratio in different populations,
deviations from this relationship in the receiving environment
will reveal possible selection hotspots.
Industrially polluted sediment is a hotspot for ARG selection.
To determine the relationship between ARG abundance and fecal
pollution in environments with anthropogenic impact, we selec-
ted metagenomic studies from literature where sequence data was
available (Supplementary Data 1). In all environments, except in
environments polluted directly by wastewater from the manu-
facturing of antibiotics (see below), the total ARG abundance
positively correlated with the crAssphage abundance, showing
that in these environments the ARG abundance could largely be
explained by the extent of fecal pollution (linear regression, F =
32.51, adj. R2 = 0.75, p < 0.05, Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 2). The
highest ARG abundances were detected in industrially polluted
Indian sediments and in hospital and WWTP effluents from UK
and Singapore. Lower levels of ARGs were detected in sediments
and river water downstream of a hospital as well as WWTP
effluent discharge points, in line with the diluted fecal material
quantified with crAssphage abundance (Supplementary Data 2).
Antibiotic resistance genes conferring resistance to different
classes of antibiotics followed the same trend in all datasets
(Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Data 4), with the
exception for quinolones in two datasets. The deviations,
however, were explained by a single gene, oqxB, coding for part
of an RND efflux pump with very broad substrate specificity40.
Also, the counterpart of the mobilized RND system, oqxA did not
follow the pattern of oqxB. This suggests that the elevated
presence of reads matching oqxB in some samples reflects a
taxonomic change towards bacteria carrying the gene chromo-
somally, and not likely as a consequence of quinolone exposure
and selection by quinolones.
Overall,
the
strong
and
consistent
correlation
between
crAssphage and ARGs (also across antibiotic classes) suggests
the observed enriched ARG abundance is primarily due to fecal
contamination rather than selection of the ARGs in the down-
stream environments. Similarly, the ARG richness, total abun-
dance of MGEs and intI1 gene abundance could also be explained
by fecal pollution levels (Supplementary Figure 2).
Indian sediments polluted with exceptionally high levels of
antibiotics from drug manufacturing33,41 provided a clear
exception to the general trend. Here, ARG levels were very high,
at the same time crAssphage was not detected in most of these

 samples indicating that they contained very little human fecal
material. These and other sediments from the same industrially
polluted area contain the highest levels of antibiotics ever
measured in the environment33. The exceptionally high abun-
dance of ARGs and together with very few or no crAssphage
reads observed in the metagenomes provides strong support for
the hypothesis that direct selection for resistance rather than fecal
contamination explains the abundance of ARGs in the polluted
sediments. It should be noted that the DNA in these samples was
amplified using RepliG prior to sequencing, which could favor
small circular plasmids and thereby inflate the counts for genes
carried by these34. However, even by removing the most
abundant ARGs, the pattern was still consistent (Supplementary
Figure 3).
ARG abundance is largely explained by fecal matter, not
selection. To expand our analysis beyond the selected studies of
polluted environments, we analyzed 484 publicly available
metagenomes from MG-RAST, previously analyzed for ARGs in
Pal et al. (2016) including environments with human fecal pol-
lution. We were able to detect crAssphage only in samples taken
from the Mississippi river (USA), WWTPs, activated sludge with
high ammonia content, Beijing air and from laboratory mice.
Fecal pollution correlated with the observed ARG abundance in
the river water, Beijing air and in wastewaters (excluding acti-
vated sludge with high ammonia content) (Fig. 3). The strong
correlation of ARGs and crAssphage in the large-scale analysis of
metagenomes with varying levels of fecal contamination is in line
with our results in the selected anthropogenically polluted sites,
confirming that also in these environments the mobile ARG
abundance could be explained with fecal pollution and no
apparent signs of large-scale selection or horizontal gene dis-
semination could be detected (Fig. 3, Supplementary Data 2).
Interestingly, this was true also for Beijing smog samples, hosting
a particular high diversity of ARGs42. The activated sludge
samples with high ammonia concentrations were from a labora-
tory experiment43 and conclusions about possible selection dur-
ing wastewater treatment in these samples should not be drawn.
A sometimes high abundance of crAssphage and consistently
high abundances of ARGs were found from mice gut metagen-
omes in MG-RAST. All of these mice were from murine model
experiments and were not given antibiotics44–46. It is known that
laboratory mice gut microbiota bear some similarities to human
gut microbiota47 and differs from the gut microbiota of wild
mice48,49, which could explain these findings. As in human feces,
the crAssphage abundance in mice feces was not linked to the
total ARG abundance.
The samples with elevated resistance levels where we could not
detect crAssphage were either animal fecal metagenomes or
environments polluted with animal feces (Supplementary Fig-
ure 4). Since crAssphage is reported to be rather specific to
human feces, we accordingly could not find a correlation with
ARG abundance in these environments. To further verify the
lower abundance of crAssphage in other animals compared to
humans we analyzed 12 chicken gut50, 100 pig gut51, and 42 cow
rumen52 metagenomes and did not detect crAssphage, in
agreement with the results of others24,26,29,30. Hence, crAssphage
is very specific for detecting anthropogenic pollution. To
disentangle selection from fecal pollution in environments
polluted with animal feces, additional markers for animal feces
would be needed. We therefore determined the abundance of
ɸB124-14 phage in the MG-RAST metagenomes. We found it to
be less abundant than crAssphage in human impacted environ-
ments and not to perform well with other pollution sources such
as animal feces either. Overall ɸB124-14 was detected in fewer
metagenomes than crAssphage (Supplementary Data 3). The
lower abundance of ɸB124-14 in the studied metagenomes
suggests it is not suitable to be used for tracking fecal pollution in
metagenomic data sets. However, a qPCR-based approach with

Fig. 2 Correlation between ARG abundance and crAssphage abundance in environments with pollution from WWTPs, hospitals, or drug manufacturing.
The environments effected by drug manufacturing are polluted with exceptionally high levels of antibiotics, and the analyses show clear selection for
antibiotic resistance as the ARG abundance cannot be explained by fecal pollution. ARG abundance and crAssphage abundance were normalized with total
nucleotide count in the metagenomes. For samples where we did not detect crAssphage (indicated by triangles), half of the detection limit (corresponding
to one read mapping to crAssphage) was used and normalized to the total nucleotide count

 lower detection limit could give better results. Due to the low
detection frequency, we did not use ɸB124-14 in this study to
detect possible selection hotspots.
Predicting antibiotic resistance gene abundance with crAssphage.
From the abundance of crAssphage, we were able to predict
antibiotic resistance gene abundances with good accuracy (linear
regression, F = 34.76, adj. R2 = 0.54, p < 0.05) in the environ-
ments with anthropogenic impact in MG-RAST using a linear
model constructed from the selected metagenomes from polluted
environments (Beijing air, river water, & WWTP) (Supplemen-
tary Figure 5). However, due to the different base levels of
resistance genes in the point source (sewage), the baseline
(intercept) of ARG abundance cannot be predicted with high
accuracy. It has been shown that different parts of the world have
different resistance burden35, which is seen also in fecal samples
analyzed in this study (Fig. 1). Furthermore, different environ-
ments might have different levels of fecal pollution from domestic
animals, which could explain some of the varying background
levels of resistance when compared to the crAssphage abundance.
However, when the baseline level of an environment is estimated,
the model using crAssphage performs well in predicting the ARG
abundance.
Antibiotic resistance gene dynamics in wastewater treatment
plants. As noted earlier, WWTPs could potentially serve as
hotspots for antibiotic resistance selection and horizontal gene
transfer. To determine correlation between ARG abundance and
fecal pollution in WWTPs during the treatment process, we
analyzed metagenomes from three Swedish WWTPs8 and two
WWTPs in Wisconsin, USA53. These studies were selected since
the sequence data was publicly available and accompanied by
comprehensive metadata. The results show clearly the ARG
abundance decreases from raw sewage to the treated sewage in
parallel with a similar decrease in fecal material during the
treatment process (Fig. 4). In sludge, the ARG abundance seems
to be even lower than expected based on the crAssphage
abundance (Supplementary Figure 6). These results speak against
WWTPs being hotspots with a strong antibiotic resistance
selection acting as a driver for horizontal gene transfer5,7 and
show that at least in the studied treatment plants the treatment
process eliminates ARGs along with fecal pollution with high
efficiency. Although differential survival and growth of bacterial
taxa during the treatment process carrying ARGs or crAssphage
can add to noise in the analysis, we could see clear correlation
between fecal pollution and ARG abundance along the treatment
process indicating that there is no evident selection for resistance.
The same was concluded in the Swedish WWTP study even
though the authors found tetracycline and ciprofloxacin con-
centrations slightly above predicted selective concentrations in
the influents8. A very recent culture-based study of over 4000 E.
coli isolates from influent and effluent from Scandinavias´s largest
WWTP also found no support for within-species selection in the
treatment plant54. Yet other studies have shown a reduction of
ARGs during the treatment process9,11. Our results connect the
reduction of ARGs to elimination of fecal material from sewage
during the process. In all of the five treatment plants studied here,
the correlation between crAssphage and ARG abundance was
similar (Fig. 4). A linear model between ARG abundance and
crAssphage detection confirmed that the correlation was sig-
nificant and similar in both countries and all WWTPs (linear
regression, F = 71.26, adj. R2 = 0.59, p < 0.05). Only the intercepts
differed between the WWTPs in Sweden and USA indicating that
the proportion of ARGs to crAssphage in the sewage entering the
plant was different in the two countries, but the ARG removal
efficiencies of the treatment processes were on par for all treat-
ment plants.
One would perhaps expect a similar ARG to crAssphage ratio
in Swedish and US sewage influents, given the overall comparable
resistance gene abundance in gut metagenomes of Swedish and
US subjects55. Explanations behind the differences found might
be technical and come from sample handling or be related to the
sources of sewage entering the plant but unfortunately, we cannot
asses that with the data available. The ARGs per metagenomic
read were, on average, slightly higher and crAssphage more
common in the US populations (refer to Fig. 1 to see differences
in ARG abundances in different countries). This suggest that one
should probably restrict comparisons of ARG to crAssphage

 ratios to samples that are contaminated by the same population of
people and prepared using similar protocols, as we have done in
this study.
Estimated resistance risk correlates with fecal pollution. A
computational pipeline estimating the potential of ARGs being
associated with MGEs and mobilized to pathogens (resistome
risk) was published recently56. We analyzed the same samples
that were used for benchmarking the pipeline and found that the
resistance risks as estimated by the authors56 followed fecal pol-
lution levels in each environment having human fecal pollution.
The correlation was even stronger between the resistance risk and
the total count of mobile ARGs than between resistance risk and
fecal pollution in all environments (Supplementary Figure 7). Our
analysis show that in one of the hospital samples there was ele-
vated levels of ARGs compared to the fecal content (Supple-
mentary Figure 7). However, their overall contribution to the
resistance load at WWTPs has been shown to be small57. So, to
fine-tune the risk assessment, we would propose to include the
fecal content in to the analysis to be able to determine possible
selection or dissemination scenarios (risks for evolution of
resistance) with better precision, as opposed to situations where
there mainly is a risk for transmission of already resistant
pathogens58.
Estimating the risk associated with environmental antibiotic
resistance is far from simple. Besides the total amount of ARGs, it
clear that association of resistance genes with MGEs and
pathogens elevates the risk caused to human health59. However,
detecting a resistance gene in the environment does not
necessarily mean a risk for human health. Certainly, there is a
higher probability of transfer when there are more transferrable
genes and recipient cells together and when the genes are already
on mobile genetic elements ready to be transferred to pathogens.
However, selection plays a critical role in the processes required
for the transferred gene to persist in the new host or a newly
emerged gene to disseminate60. Using proxies for fecal pollution
such as crAssphage enables detecting possible selection hotspots
where the detected ARG abundances cannot be solely explained
with human fecal contamination and thus, can help in assessing
risks associated with elevated levels of ARGs in the environment.
In conclusion, our results provide a framework to help
disentangling dissemination of resistant human fecal bacteria
from the possible selection and horizontal gene transfer of
resistance genes in the environment. We were able to detect true
hotspots for antibiotic resistance gene selection in sediments
receiving exceptionally high levels of antibiotics from industry. In
addition, we show that in all other studied environments
receiving anthropogenic waste, there was no clear evidence of
wide scale selection. On the contrary, the ARG abundance
correlated strongly with fecal pollution, which does not support
the prevailing speculations that major selection for antibiotic
resistance occurs in WWTPs or effluent receiving environments.
It should be noted that antibiotic concentrations were not
measured in most studies. Knowing the concentrations of
antibiotics in these environments would have provided an even
deeper insight on the selection dynamics. A lack of apparent
selection in these environments would mean that the emergence
of new resistance determinants is less likely and the transferred
resistance genes are not likely to be fixated on new hosts due to
selection pressure. In the heavily polluted Indian sediments new
resistance
determinants
are
possibly
more
persistent
and
disseminate more efficiently in the population due to the
competitive advantage they give to the receiving strains.
It should be noted that selection occurring on small scale,
which does not affect the entire population, or selection of limited
types of resistance genes would probably not be detected using
this method. Furthermore, rare horizontal transfer events will
definitely be missed and more precise methods are needed.
Reported increases in relative proportion of individual ARGs in
certain environments exposed to sewage/low levels of antibiotics
could reflect such small-scale selection. However, community-
based analyses, including qPCR or metagenomics, do not provide
evidence
for
within-species
selection.
Hence,
increases
of
individual ARGs would more easily be explained by simple
changes in species composition, caused by other factors than the
exposure to antibiotics. A lack of consistency with regards to the
type of antibiotics the enriched ARGs provide resistance to,
provides further support to the latter explanation8.
Another important source of antibiotic resistance determinants
is animal husbandry, which uses more antibiotics than are
prescribed to humans. In the US animal manure exceeds the
human sewage sludge by ~100-fold61. As crAssphage is abundant
only in human fecal material it cannot be used to estimate fecal
content of environments receiving animal manure and feces.
However, it is likely that similar phages that are specific to
different production animals could be identified and used in a
similar fashion. Discovering more markers for fecal pollution
would advance the field of studying antibiotic resistance in the
environment. We argue that the use of crAssphage, or similar
fecal pollution markers, should be incorporated broadly in studies
determining the persistence, fate and possible selection of
resistance genes originating from fecal pollution, which is likely
the main source of resistance genes of environmental ARG
pollution.
In terms of ranking risk in resistomes, we argue that the total
count of ARGs or their genetic context does not give the whole
picture of the actual risks. Without a way to estimate the extent of
selection pressure in the environment, the total count of ARGs or
the association of an ARG to mobile element adds only a few
pieces to the entire puzzle of disentangling the risks related to
resistance genes, especially when in most cases the genes are
eventually diluted to near zero concentrations following the
diminishing fecal pollution. Real-time PCR primers for detecting
crAssphage are already available27,28, so the use of metagenomics
is not necessary, making the analysis quick, easy and affordable.
When collecting data, we encountered many studies where
sequencing data was not available, even though sometimes
presented as available for download in public repositories. This is
unfortunate, as all this data would have been valuable in this
study. Re-analyzing these samples using markers for fecal
pollution would expand our knowledge on resistance gene
dynamics is diverse environments. To conclude, we argue that
including a proxy for fecal pollution in future studies would
enable a more comprehensive understanding of the antibiotic
resistance dynamics in the receiving environments, providing
more reliable estimates of the risk scenarios and perhaps most
importantly, discovering true environmental hotspots for selec-
tion and dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
Methods
Data collection. The crAssphage (NC_024711.1) and ɸB124-14 (HE608841.1)
genomes were downloaded from GenBank and indexed for mapping using
bowtie2-build62.
Metagenomic studies on human impacted environments were searched from
the literature and six studies where the sequencing data was available were selected
and downloaded from either SRA or ENA13,33,34,38,63–66. The studies included
samples from river and lake sediments, WWTP and hospital effluents and river
water. Two wastewater treatment plant studies with comprehensive metadata were
used to determine the impact of wastewater treatment on the ARG abundance and
fecal content8,53. Accession numbers for all metagenomic data can be found from
Supplementary Data 1. Many data sets from peer-reviewed studies that were
candidates for being included in this study were unfortunately not made publicly
available.

 A set of 484 metagenomes from MG-RAST, excluding metagenomes from
different human body sites, analyzed in42, were used for the study. The
metagenomes included soil, freshwater, marine, animal, wastewater, agricultural,
and air samples. Full list of accessions and annotations are available in
Supplementary Data 1.
To study the abundance of crAssphage and its association to the total ARG
abundance in human gut metagenome samples, 74 Chinese and 234 European
subjects were used from a previous study35. In addition, gut metagenomes from
141 US subjects were downloaded from the HMP portal (https://portal.hmpdacc.
org/). Accessions and download links for HMP subjects can be found from
Supplementary Data 1.
To determine the abundance of crAssphage in animal gut metagenomes, 12
chicken metagenomes50, 100 pig metagenomes (a subset from a larger study)51,
and 42 cow rumen metagenomes52 were downloaded from SRA. Accession
numbers are given in Supplementary Data 1.
crAssphage and ARG annotation. Metagenomic reads were mapped against the
crAssphage genome using bowtie262 and the crAssphage genome coverage was
calculated using Samtools67. Only read pairs mapping in proper pairs were cal-
culated in case of paired-end sequencing. For single end metagenomes, the mapped
reads were filtered with quality value 10 using Samtools. The genome coverage was
used as a measure for crAssphage abundance in the sample. ResFinder, a database
of mobile, acquired antibiotic resistance genes68 was translated from nucleotide
sequences into amino acid sequences using Biopython. The longest ORF for each
gene was selected to represent the gene in the database as some genes included
upstream and/or downstream regions. MGE database69 (available from: https://
github.com/KatariinaParnanen/MobileGeneticElementDatabase) was used for
MGE annotation by first removing all plasmid marker sequences. All remaining
entries were translated to amino acid sequence as described earlier. ARGs and
MGEs were annotated against the translated ResFinder/MGE database using
DIAMOND blastx70 with the following parameters: minimum identity 90%,
minimum match length 20 AA. The parameters were chosen to be less conservative
in order to identify also genes not stretching over the whole read. It should be
noted that this approach can result in false-positives. In case of paired-end
sequencing, matches on the second read were counted only if there was no match
on the first read. Both crAssphage abundance and antibiotic resistance gene
abundance were normalized with the total base pair count in the metagenome.
Mapping against ɸB124-14 was done exactly as with crAssphage.
Statistical analyses. Both normalized crAssphage abundance and normalized
total ARG abundance were log10 transformed and linear regression was done using
the lm function in R v.3.271. The ARG abundances in the MG-RAST metagenomes
were predicted from the crAssphage abundance based on the linear model based on
the selected studies using the function predict in R. Figures were drawn in R using
the base graphic package and ggplot2 package v.2.2.172. Smoothing curves using a
linear model were drawn with function geom_smooth in ggplot2. Statistical com-
parison of mobile antibiotic resistance gene abundance between European, Chinese
and US subjects was done using the aov function in R. A post-hoc test was done
using the TukeyHSD function in R.
