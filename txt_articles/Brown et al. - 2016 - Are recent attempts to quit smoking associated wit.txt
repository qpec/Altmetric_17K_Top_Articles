Abstract
Background: Alcohol consumption during attempts at smoking cessation can provoke relapse and so smokers are
often advised to restrict their alcohol consumption during this time. This study assessed at a population-level
whether smokers having recently initiated an attempt to stop smoking are more likely than other smokers to report
i) lower alcohol consumption and ii) trying to reduce their alcohol consumption.
Method: Cross-sectional household surveys of 6287 last-year smokers who also completed the Alcohol Use
Disorders Identification Test consumption questionnaire (AUDIT-C). Respondents who reported attempting to quit
smoking in the last week were compared with those who did not. Those with AUDIT-C≥5 were also asked if they
were currently trying to reduce the amount of alcohol they consume.
Results: After adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics and current smoking status, smokers who reported
a quit attempt within the last week had lower AUDIT-C scores compared with those who did not report an attempt
in the last week (βadj = −0.56, 95 % CI = −1.08 to −0.04) and were less likely to be classified as higher risk (AUDIT-C≥5:
ORadj = 0.57, 95 % CI = 0.38 to 0.85). The lower AUDIT-C scores appeared to be a result of lower scores on the frequency
of ‘binge’ drinking item (βadj = −0.25, 95 % CI = −0.43 to −0.07), with those who reported a quit attempt within the last
week compared with those who did not being less likely to binge drink at least weekly (ORadj = 0.54, 95 % CI = 0.29 to 0.
999) and more likely to not binge drink at all (ORadj = 1.70, 95 % CI = 1.16 to 2.49). Among smokers with higher
risk consumption (AUDIT-C≥5), those who reported an attempt to stop smoking within the last week compared with those
who did not were more likely to report trying to reduce their alcohol consumption (ORadj = 2.98, 95 % CI = 1.48 to 6.01).
Conclusion: Smokers who report starting a quit attempt in the last week also report lower alcohol consumption, including
less frequent binge drinking, and appear more likely to report currently attempting to reduce their alcohol consumption
compared with smokers who do not report a quit attempt in the last week.

 Background
Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are two of
the most serious public health problems [1–4] and have a
close and complex relationship [5]. There is co-morbidity
such that people with an alcohol disorder are substantially
more likely to smoke cigarettes [6–10]. Cross-sectional
epidemiological data indicate that lifetime quit rates for
smokers are lower [5–7] and nicotine dependence higher
in those with an alcohol use disorder [5], while longitu-
dinal data indicate that smokers with an alcohol use dis-
order are less likely to attempt and succeed in stopping
[11, 12] and among former smokers, those with an alcohol
use disorder appear more likely to relapse [11]. Alcohol
consumption during attempts at smoking cessation is as-
sociated with greater risk of lapse and relapse [13–17]
even after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics
and tobacco dependence [13]. Alcohol-related lapses also
appear qualitatively distinct from lapses not involving al-
cohol [13]. There are variety of possible mechanisms
through which alcohol consumption could increase the
risk of lapse during a smoking cessation attempt (for ex-
ample, reduction in self-control, increased salience of
smoking cues or increased likelihood of exposure to other
smoking cues; [17]), and as a consequence smokers are
advised to restrict their alcohol consumption during an at-
tempt to stop [13, 18, 19].
This position is supported by the wider multiple health
behaviour change literature. The field of multiple behaviour
change is motivated by findings that many health behav-
iours tend to cluster and often result in synergistic effects
on mortality and morbidity [20, 21]. In theory this presents
a cost-effective opportunity to target particularly at-risk
groups and intervene on several public health problems
simultaneously. In practice, multiple behaviour change has
proved a considerable challenge [22, 23]. While generalis-
able results are scarce, a recent theoretically-guided meta-
analysis of behaviour change interventions indicated that
there may be a curvilinear relation between the number of
behavioural recommendations and outcome, with a moder-
ate (2–3) number producing the greatest effect [24].
It is unclear at a population-level whether smokers fol-
low advice to restrict alcohol during a quit attempt. One
indicator would be the association between a recent at-
tempt to stop smoking and alcohol consumption. It is
not possible with cross-sectional epidemiological data to
rule out the possibility that any association could be ex-
plained by people with lower alcohol consumption being
more likely to attempt to quit smoking. However, the as-
sociation is important whichever the direction of causal-
ity; and this alternative may suggest the need for
smokers with higher alcohol consumption to be encour-
aged to quit smoking. To help tease apart the issue, it is
also instructive to assess whether among smokers with
higher-risk alcohol consumption there is an association
between a recent attempt to quit smoking and a current
attempt to cut down alcohol consumption.
This study sought to address the following research
questions: What is the association among smokers in
England between a recent attempt to quit smoking and
alcohol consumption? What is the association among
smokers with higher risk alcohol consumption in Eng-
land between a recent attempt to stop smoking and a
current attempt to cut down on their drinking?
Methods
Study design
Data were collected using repeated cross-sectional house-
hold surveys of representative samples of the population
of adults in England conducted in consecutive monthly
waves between March 2014 and September 2015. The sur-
veys are part of the ongoing Smoking Toolkit Study (STS)
and Alcohol Toolkit Study (ATS) which are designed to
provide tracking information about smoking, alcohol con-
sumption and related behaviours in England [25, 26]. Each
month a new sample of approximately 1700 adults aged
16 and over complete a face-to-face computer-assisted
survey. The sampling is a hybrid between random prob-
ability and simple quota and the method has been shown
to result in a sample that is nationally representative in its
socio-demographic composition [25].
Study population
We used data from respondents aged 16 and over in the
period from March 2014 to September 2015 who re-
ported smoking tobacco in the last year by endorsing
one of the first four options on the following question:
‘Which of the following best applies to you? Please note
cigarettes refer to tobacco and not electronic cigarettes.’: (i)
‘I smoke cigarettes (including hand-rolled) everyday’; (ii) ‘I
smoke cigarettes (including hand-rolled) but not every
day’; (iii) ‘I do not smoke cigarettes at all but I do smoke
tobacco of some kind (e.g., pipe or cigar)’; (iv) I have
stopped smoking completely in the last year’; (v) I stopped
smoking completely more than a year ago; (vi) I have never
been a smoker (i.e., smoked for a year or more).
Measures
Alcohol consumption was assessed by the first three con-
sumption questions on the widely validated Alcohol Use
Disorders
Identification
Test
(AUDIT-C;
[27]).
The
AUDIT-C is the short-form of the ten-item AUDIT ques-
tionnaire and provides a score ranging between 0 and 12
(with 0 indicating non-drinkers). For the current study,
higher risk consumption was indicated by a score ≥ 5 [28].
The three component items of the AUDIT-C consist of
‘drinking frequency’ (0–4), ‘typical quantity per occasion’
(0–4), and ‘high intensity or ‘binge’ drinking frequency’
(0–4). From the binge drinking item, categorical measures
Brown et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:535 
Page 2 of 7
 were derived of those who did not binge drink compared
with those who did, and those who did binge drink at least
weekly compared with those who did not. Smokers whose
consumption of alcohol was classified as higher risk, were
also asked whether they were currently attempting to re-
strict their alcohol consumption.
All smokers were asked whether they had made a serious
attempt to stop smoking and those who had made an at-
tempt were asked how recently. Smokers were classified
into those who attempted to stop in the last week and those
who had not. Respondents were also asked questions that
assessed: age; sex; an occupationally-based classification of
socio-economic status called ‘social grade’ (dichotomised to
ABC1 = higher and intermediate professional/managerial
and supervisory, clerical, junior managerial/administrative/
professional or C2DE = skilled, semi-skilled, unskilled man-
ual and lowest grade workers or unemployed); government
office region in England (dichotomised to North = North
East, North West, and Yorkshire and the Humber, East
Midlands, West Midlands, or South = East of England,
London, South East, and South West, classified according
to an established North-South divide [29]); receipt of a vol-
untary educational qualification (obtained after compulsory
education ceases at 16 years old); ethnicity; and disability.
Analysis
To examine associations between indices of alcohol con-
sumption and a recent attempt to quit smoking, we first
constructed unadjusted regression models in which we
regressed i) indices of alcohol consumption onto a recent
attempt to quit smoking (reference: no attempt to quit
within the last week). We used linear regression models for
the continuous dependent variables (scores on the AUDIT-
C, and scores on the component items ‘drinking frequency’
,
‘typical quantity per occasion’
, and ‘binge frequency’) and lo-
gistic regression for the binary dependent variables (propor-
tion classified as high risk AUDIT-C, binge drinking at least
weekly, and no binge drinking). To examine the independ-
ent association after adjustment with each dependent vari-
able, we then constructed multivariable regression models
including also the socio-demographic and smoking vari-
ables listed in Table 1 (age, sex, social grade, region, receipt
of a voluntary educational qualification, ethnicity, disability
and current smoking status) and the survey wave. In a final
subgroup analysis, to examine associations between a re-
cent attempt to stop smoking and a current attempt to cut
down drinking among smokers with higher risk alcohol
consumption, we first constructed an unadjusted logistic
regression model in which we regressed a current attempt
to cut down drinking onto a recent attempt to quit smok-
ing (reference: no attempt to quit within the last week). To
examine the independent association after adjustment, we
constructed a multivariable logistic regression model in-
cluding also the socio-demographic variables listed in
Table 1 and the survey wave.
Results
A total of 31,878 adults in England were surveyed between
March 2014 and September 2015, of whom 6652 (20.9 %)
reported smoking in the last year and 6287 (94.5 %) of
these smokers also provided complete data on all variables.
The overall socio-demographic characteristics of the sam-
ple (see Table 1) were broadly representative of smokers:
the sample was younger and contained a lower proportion
of women and greater proportion of people with lower so-
cial grade and no post-16 qualifications than would be ex-
pected in a general population sample [25]. A total of 144
of these smokers reported that they had attempted to quit
smoking in the last week. There was no evidence of associ-
ation between recent quitting and socio-demographic
characteristics but, as expected, those last-year smokers
who had attempted to quit in the last week were much
more likely to report currently not smoking than those
who had not attempted to quit within the last week (see
Table 1).
In an unadjusted model, smokers who had attempted
to quit within the last week reported lower AUDIT-C
scores than those who had not: scores were 0.66 points
(95 % CI = 1.21 to 0.11) lower on average among those
who had attempted to quit in the last week (see Table 2).

 This result was largely unchanged after adjustment for
age, sex, social grade, region, voluntary educational qualifi-
cation, ethnicity, disability, current smoking status and
survey wave: the adjusted AUDIT-C score was 0.56 points
(95 % CI = −1.08 to −0.04) lower among those who had
attempted to quit in the last week (see Table 2). In both
unadjusted and adjusted analyses, those smokers who had
attempted to quit in the last week were also less likely to
be classified as higher risk drinkers (AUDIT-C≥5, see
Table 2).
The lower AUDIT-C scores among those who attempted
to quit smoking in the last week appeared to be a result of
lower scores on the component item [question 3] frequency
of binge drinking (see Table 2), with those who begun a quit
attempt in the last week being less likely to binge drink at
least weekly and more likely to not binge drink at all (see
Table 2). There was, however, no evidence of association
between a recent attempt to quit smoking and the drinking
frequency or typical quantity per occasion AUDIT-C items
(see Table 2). In all these analyses, the results were broadly
unchanged after adjustment (see Table 2).
The final subgroup analysis included only those smokers
whose alcohol consumption was classified as higher risk
(n = 2266). Compared with smokers who had not, those
who had attempted to stop smoking within the last week
were more likely to report also currently trying to restrict
their alcohol consumption in both unadjusted and ad-
justed analyses (see Table 2).
Discussion
This study found that smokers who reported attempting
to stop within the last week had lower levels of alcohol
consumption, especially bingeing, and were less likely to
be classified as having higher risk alcohol consumption
(AUDIT-C ≥5) compared with those who did not report
an attempt to quit smoking in the last week. Among
those with higher risk alcohol consumption, smokers
who reported attempting to stop smoking within the last
week compared with those who reported no attempt
were more likely to report also currently trying to re-
strict their alcohol consumption.
This study adds to the literature on the close relation-
ship between smoking and alcohol consumption [5].
One component of the relationship is that alcohol con-
sumption is associated with lapse and relapse to smoking
[13–17], which has resulted in smokers being widely ad-
vised to restrict their consumption during quit attempts
[13, 18, 19]. In the current study, the association be-
tween a recent attempt to quit smoking and reduced alco-
hol consumption indicates that smokers in England may be
following this best-practice advice to restrict their alcohol
consumption during a smoking cessation attempt. It is not
possible with cross-sectional epidemiological data to rule
out reverse causation i.e., the possibility that the association
between quitting and consumption may actually be driven
by people with lower alcohol consumption being more
likely to attempt to quit smoking. If this were the explan-
ation, the association would remain important because it
would suggest the need for smokers with higher alcohol
consumption to be targeted for further encouragement to
attempt to quit smoking. However, another finding in this
study indicates that the association is unlikely to be driven
exclusively by lighter drinkers being more likely to attempt
quit smoking: among smokers who were also heavier
drinkers, those who had made an attempt to quit smoking
within the last week compared with those who had not
were also more likely to report a current attempt to restrict
their alcohol consumption. The present study cannot deter-
mine whether attempts to quit smoking tend to precede at-
tempts to restrict alcohol consumption, or vice versa.

 These findings have possible implications for policy
evaluation and development: there appears to be a need
for greater attention to possible crossover effects when
evaluating the cost-effectiveness of alcohol and tobacco
interventions and more reason for a coordinated strategy
on alcohol and tobacco control. Policy on brief intervention
by health professionals is one example. Brief intervention
for smoking and alcohol are both effective and cost-
effective interventions [30–34]. Delivery of smoking brief
intervention is much more common in England than is al-
cohol [35], and there is a need to increase the rate of
screening and brief intervention on alcohol [36, 37]. The
current study suggests that smokers may be more likely to
reduce their alcohol consumption when attempting to stop
smoking than when they are not. While these findings can-
not speak to the effectiveness of brief interventions, they do
suggest that a smoking brief intervention may be a good
opportunity to intervene also on alcohol: smokers may be
likely to plan to reduce their alcohol consumption regard-
less and may therefore be particularly receptive to interven-
tion on alcohol. However, this is an empirical question for
which there is currently sparse experimental evidence [38–
40], and until such evidence is forthcoming, other strategies
to increase alcohol brief intervention may warrant greater
resource [41–45]. In the meantime, the current findings
could be simply disseminated to health professionals to re-
assure them that many smokers may be planning to cut
down on their drinking anyway and their intervention on
alcohol may be therefore unlikely to compromise the pa-
tient relationship: the GP-patient relationship is a regularly
cited barrier to a greater rate of brief intervention, albeit
one of several including inadequate training, and lack of
time or financial incentives [46–52].
There are three important limitations of this study. The
limitation on interpretation of cross-sectional design in re-
lation to direction of causation has been discussed. A sec-
ond limitation is that as an observational study it is
possible that unmeasured confounding could have influ-
enced the results. For example, it is possible that the diag-
nosis of a health problem led to attempts to cut down on
both drinking and smoking (i.e., cross-behavioural sick-
quitter effects). Our adjustment for a self-reported disability
may not have sufficiently accounted for this possibility. An-
other limitation is that the study relied on self-reported
data with the risk of socially desirable responding. However,
in population surveys the social pressure and related misre-
porting of smoking is low and it is generally considered ac-
ceptable to rely on self-reported data [53], while we used
an abbreviated version of a high quality tool that has been
widely validated to assess alcohol use disorder (AUDIT-
C; [27, 54]). The full version of the AUDIT question-
naire is more widely validated but includes questions
across a longer reference period that would have ren-
dered the scale less sensitive to recent changes, while
AUDIT-C has good validity, excellent reliability and re-
sponsiveness to change [54].
Conclusions
In conclusion, smokers who report a recent attempt to
stop are more likely to report lower-risk alcohol consump-
tion, including less frequent binge drinking, after adjusting
for socio-demographic characteristics. Among smokers
with higher-risk alcohol consumption, those who report a
last week attempt to stop are more likely to report also a
current attempt to cut down on their drinking.
