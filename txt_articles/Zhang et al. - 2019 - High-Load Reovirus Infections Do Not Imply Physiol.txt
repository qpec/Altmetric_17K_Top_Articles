The recent ubiquitous detection of PRV among salmonids has sparked international
concern about the cardiorespiratory performance of infected wild and farmed salmon.
Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) has been shown to create substantial viremia in salmon by
targeting erythrocytes for principle replication. In some instances, infections develop
into heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) or other pathological conditions
affecting the respiratory system. Critical to assessing the seriousness of PRV infections
are controlled infection studies that measure physiological impairment to critical life
support systems. Respiratory performance is such a system and here multiple indices
were measured to test the hypothesis that a low-virulence strain of PRV from Pacific
Canada compromises the cardiorespiratory capabilities of Atlantic salmon. Contrary to
this hypothesis, the oxygen affinity and carrying capacity of erythrocytes were unaffected
by PRV despite the presence of severe viremia, minor heart pathology and transient
cellular activation of antiviral response pathways. Similarly, PRV-infected fish had neither
sustained nor appreciable differences in respiratory capabilities compared with control
fish. The lack of functional harm to salmon infected with PRV in this instance highlights
that, in an era of unprecedented virus discovery, detection of viral infection does not
necessarily imply bodily harm and that viral load is not always a suitable predictor of
disease within a host organism.

INTRODUCTION
Animal viruses are expected to inflict harm to the host cells they infect, either as a direct result
of infection or as a product of host-directed apoptosis (Kaminskyy and Zhivotovsky, 2010). As
a consequence, all animal viruses can be defined as putatively pathogenic, varying only in their
potential virulence (i.e., their relative ability to cause damage) (Pirofski and Casadevall, 2012). In
cases where highly virulent viruses are linked to serious disease, the presentation of severe clinical
symptoms such as morbidity or death clearly represent states of reduced fitness and are usually
conditional on the quantity of virus produced during infection (Griffiths, 1999). However, harm
inflicted to animals experiencing infections of either low intensity or low virulence becomes far

Respiratory Physiology of PRV Infected Salmon
less clear, given the physiological plasticity animals can display
and the potential for pathogenic viruses to provide host benefits;
for example, protection against a more serious transmissible
or non-transmissible disease (Tan et al., 2012; Cadwell, 2015;
Villalona-Calero et al., 2016).
Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) is the most recently accepted
member of the Orthoreovirus genus. It has a pervasive and
global distribution in salmon, including both wild and farmed
populations, and has been detected in nearly all salmonid species
(Garseth et al., 2013; Marty et al., 2015; Olsen et al., 2015; Takano
et al., 2016; Morton et al., 2017; Julio et al., 2018). Phylogenetic
comparisons currently suggest there are three subtypes of
PRV (PRV1, PRV2, and PRV3) which loosely correspond to
geographical and/or host species divisions (Kibenge et al., 2013;
Olsen et al., 2015; Takano et al., 2016). Nevertheless, all three
subtypes have a proclivity for infecting erythrocytes and can
generate extensive systemic infections.
The virulence of PRV, like most reoviruses, appears to be
generally low and highly dependent on virus, host, and/or
environmental factors (Garver et al., 2016; Polinski et al., 2019).
Nevertheless, PRV1 has been demonstrated as an etiological
component of a disease known as heart and skeletal muscle
inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon of Norway
(Wessel et al., 2017), which is currently one of the transmissible
diseases most affecting Atlantic salmon production in that
country1 – the largest Atlantic salmon producer in the world.
In Pacific Canada, PRV1 has also been suggested to be involved
in a jaundice/anemia syndrome of farmed Chinook salmon (Di
Cicco et al., 2018), although its role in this relatively rare disease
is far from clear (Garver et al., 2015). In Japan, PRV2 has been
associated with an anemic condition of farmed Coho salmon,
known as erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS) (Takano
et al., 2016), while in Europe, PRV3 is associated with an HSMI-
like condition in farmed rainbow trout (Olsen et al., 2015). High
morbidity has been attributed to both EIBS and HSMI in some
farmed populations.
Given that erythrocytes are primary targets for PRV infection
and the heart is a principal organ associated with PRV disease
(e.g., HSMI), it has been suggested that all PRV infections lead to
respiratory impairments (Olsen et al., 2015; Takano et al., 2016;
Lund et al., 2017; Di Cicco et al., 2018) and are of sufficient
severity that if wild salmon become infected they might not be
able to swim back to their spawning areas because of a presumed
reduction in respiratory capabilities (Garseth et al., 2013; Morton
et al., 2017; Di Cicco et al., 2018). This has sparked international
concern for PRV’
s potential to cause cardiorespiratory harm to
both wild and farmed salmon populations. Even in the absence of
direct tests of such respiratory harm, a Canadian Federal Justice
has already ruled that PRV ‘
may be harmful to the protection
and conservation of fish’[Morton v. Canada (Fisheries and
Oceans) 2015 FC 575].
However, experimental challenge with a PRV1 subtype from
Pacific Canada has failed to produce noteworthy pathology,
anemia, or other signs of disease despite causing extreme viremia
(>109 PRV genome copies per mL host blood) (Garver et al.,
1marineharvest.com
2016; Polinski et al., 2019). While such high-load systemic
infections exhibiting no-to-low virulence are rare in virus-
animal relationships (if not unprecedented), these findings
present an alternative possibility that at least some subtypes
of PRV may have found a near commensal opportunity in
targeting erythrocytes; which although remain nucleated in
salmon, have minimal transcriptional requirements following
maturation and have unknown capacities for communicating
with immune competent cells (Lund et al., 2000; Phillips et al.,
2000). Nevertheless, it is also unknown as to whether there is
physiological harm associated with the minor amounts of cardiac
inflammation, transient activation of virus recognition pathways,
and erythrocytic inclusion bodies observed during these low-
virulent PRV infections (Polinski et al., 2019). This remains a
substantial knowledge gap in the foundational understanding of
the true virulence potential of PRV.
Here we tested the hypothesis that the low-virulence subtype
of PRV1 endemic to Pacific Canada compromises the respiratory
capabilities of Atlantic salmon. To accomplish this, we took
advantage of the high-load PRV laboratory challenge model
developed in Pacific Canada (Garver et al., 2016; Polinski
et al., 2019) and combined it with a recently developed
and highly comprehensive integrated respiratory assessment
paradigm (IRAP) to measure a suite of indices related to
the respiratory performance of fish (Zhang et al., 2016, 2017,
2018). We further measured the oxygen affinity properties
of erythrocytes during infection. Using IRAP in concert
with molecular and histopathological tools for assessing viral
kinetics and host-pathogen interactions, our comprehensive
examination targeted all phases of the time-course of the PRV
infection (early entry and dissemination, peak viremia, and
latent persistence). We also incorporated an extreme acute
hypoxic challenge into the late persistence phase of infection
so as to maximize our likelihood for identifying PRV-associated
respiratory harm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This
study
was
conducted
on
a
population
of
Pacific-
domesticated Mowi-McConnell strain Atlantic salmon (Withler
et al., 2005) developed specifically for use by the British
Columbia Atlantic salmon farming industry. A cohort was
obtained from a single commercial hatchery on Vancouver
Island, Canada, and transported to the Fisheries and Oceans
Canada Pacific Biological Station (49.2106◦ N, 123.9554◦ W)
where all experimental trials were conducted. Experiments
were carried out under the permission and guidelines of the
Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) Pacific Region
Animal Care Committee (no: 16–
019). A pre-transport screening
of 20 fish did not detect PRV by quantitative PCR (qPCR),
nor was any other virus propagated on CHSE-214 or EPC
diagnostic fish cell lines. Fish were reared for 4 months in 8◦C
municipal dechlorinated freshwater before being transitioned to
sand-filtered, UV-irradiated, 11◦C seawater (28–
32 ppt) over a
4 week period. Two hundred and forty fish (∼75 g body mass
by bulk weight estimate) were divided equally into six 350 L

circular experimental tanks (40 fish per tank) supplied with
15 L per min flow-through, sand-filtered, UV-irradiated 11◦C
seawater and held for 10–
20 days prior to challenge and first
IRAP assessments (Zhang et al., 2019). Experiments began after
seawater transfer because of the belief that this is when Atlantic
salmon most often develop HSMI in a field setting (Lovoll et al.,
2012). Similarly, experiments were conducted between 10–
12◦C
in this study because PRV associated disease has manifested at
these temperatures in both laboratory and field environments
(Kongtorp et al., 2006; Wessel et al., 2017). Fish were fed EWOS
dry pellet rations at 0.5% body weight per day throughout the
study and dissolved oxygen was maintained above 90% air
saturation (>8.2 mg per L).
Experimental Infection
An isolation of PRV from a commercial freshwater salmon
hatchery on Vancouver Island, Canada (designated 16-005ND)
has provided a consistent well-characterized laboratory model
for inducing high-load viremia in the Mowi-McConnell strain of
Atlantic salmon following intraperitoneal (ip) injection (Garver
et al., 2016; Polinski et al., 2019). This isolate is also representative
of the PRV1 subtype which is widely and naturally found in both
wild and farmed salmon of western North America (Kibenge
et al., 2013; Siah et al., 2015). To ensure physiological harm
caused by PRV could be properly differentiated, two treatment
groups were tested periodically during a 21-week time course: (i)
a blood control (BC) treatment in which sonified and clarified
Atlantic salmon blood diluted in Hank’
s balanced salt solution
(HBSS) was injected (total injection volume 0.1 mL) and (ii) a
PRV 16-005ND (PRV) treatment in which sonified and clarified
PRV-infected Atlantic salmon blood diluted with HBSS at a final
concentration of 3.25 × 107 copies PRV L1 reverse-transcribed
genome segments was injected (total injection volume 0.1 mL).
In addition, a saline control (SC) treatment group was tested
following a similar injection of HBSS to (i) provide basic control
for time-dependent changes in respiratory physiology over the
21-week experiment and (ii) identify any effects associated with
the injection of a foreign blood homogenate.
Inoculates were prepared and administered as previously
described (Polinski et al., 2019). Briefly, blood of commercially
produced salmon that had been frozen at −80◦C was thawed,
diluted 1:10 in HBSS, sonified for 80s in 10s bursts with 30s
rests on ice and clarified via centrifugation at 2000 × g for
5 min at 4◦C. Inoculate sourced from PRV infected fish was then
passed four times through 30–
50 g Atlantic salmon (3–
4 week
incubation period per pass) to increase the inoculating dose
since PRV cannot currently be propagated in vitro. Inoculates
were identically prepared between each passage. Each treatment
was administered to fish that were evenly distributed into two
replicate experimental tanks. Starting with SC, administration
of treatments was conducted in 5-day increments so IRAP
assessments, which in our facility could only be conducted on
one treatment group at any given time, would be time-matched
relative to days post-challenge (dpc) rather than calendar day
(Zhang et al., 2019). Because IRAP assessments lasted 5 days,
data are reported as the week post-challenge (wpc) while data
from tissues collected on specific days are reported as day post-
challenge (dpc).
Measuring Respiratory Performance
All oxygen removed from water by a fish must be transported by
the blood to tissues with the exception of minor quantities used
directly by skin and gill (Farrell et al., 2014). By far, the majority
of this internally transported oxygen is bound to hemoglobin in
erythrocytes, which are pumped by the heart. Therefore, the least
invasive method of detecting cardiorespiratory impairments in
fish is through respirometry, which was the assessment approach
used here. Fish were also sacrificed after testing to sample
blood and directly measure the oxygen affinity properties of
the erythrocytes.
The
experimental
protocol
used
for
IRAP
measured
14 respiratory indices and provides a near comprehensive
assessment of fish respiratory capabilities. Four indices directly
assess aerobic capabilities: standard metabolic rate (SMR) and
maximum oxygen uptake ( ˙
MO2max), as well as the derived
indices of absolute aerobic scope (AAS = ˙
MO2max –SMR) and
factorial aerobic scope (FAS = SMR/ ˙
MO2max). Two indices
directly assess the capability of fish to recover from exhaustion:
excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and length
of time to recover (EPOCdur). Three indices assess levels of fish
activity and agitation: routine metabolic rate (RMR), time spent
above 50% maximum oxygen consumption rate (T0.5 ˙
MO2max)
and time spent above 80% maximum oxygen consumption rate
(T0.8 ˙
MO2max). Lastly, five indices assess hypoxia tolerance and
anaerobic capabilities: critical oxygen level (O2crit), incipient
lethal oxygen saturation (ILOS), scope for oxygen deficit (SOD),
factorial scope for oxygen deficit (FSOD), and accumulated
oxygen
deficit
(AOD)
(see
Supplementary
Material
for
detailed calculations).
Integrated respiratory assessment paradigm assessment was
performed with 8 fish simultaneously using an 8-chamber
intermittent-flow respirometry system (Zhang et al., 2016, 2017,
2018). The water in the respirometry system was maintained at
11◦C ( ± 0.5) by being immersed in a 600 L flow-through water
bath of 11◦C seawater. An IRAP assessment was conducted on
8 fish per treatment group (4 from each replicate holding tank)
during the 1st week (early viral replication and dissention), the
4th week (peak viremia), the 10th week (early viral latency period
with minor heart inflammation), and the 18th week (late viral
latency period with minor heart inflammation) post-challenge.
An additional IRAP test was conducted during the 21st wpc
using the same fish that had been assessed at week 18. All IRAP
tests usually ended with fish experiencing acute hypoxia and
loss of equilibrium where after they were humanely sacrificed
for tissue recovery; but all fish were revived at 18 wpc and held
for a further 3 weeks following this severe acute hypoxic stress
with the expectation that the hypoxic stress would exacerbate the
cardiorespiratory impairments induced by PRV.
In all IRAP assessments, fish were first fasted for 72 h and
then individually hand chased for 7 min in a 20 L bucket.
At exhaustion, fish were exposed to a standardized 1 min air
exposure before being placed into each respirometer to measure
˙
MO2max and subsequent recovery. During the 1st hour, as peak

oxygen uptake was subsiding, water cycling conditions through
each respirometry chamber consisted of a 25 s flush with fully
aerated 11◦C seawater, 70 s sealed stabilization, and 110 s sealed
oxygen uptake monitoring period. After 1 h, cycling conditions
were modified to a 50 s flush, 115 s sealed stabilization, and 345 s
oxygen uptake monitoring period which maintained > 85% air
saturation within the respirometry chambers at all times. Fish
were kept in this normoxic state without disturbance for 4 days
during which time oxygen uptake was recorded approximately
every 10 min to ensure that SMR was reliably measured (Chabot
et al., 2016). Afterward, the respirometry system was made
hypoxic (40% air saturation) over a 45-min period using nitrogen
gas supplementation. Oxygen was further reduced at a rate of
0.15% per min until each fish lost its dorso-ventral equilibrium
(LOE) and the percent air saturation at LOE was noted. At
1, 4, 10 and 21 wpc fish were immediately removed from the
respirometer and killed by blunt head trauma. At 18 wpc, fish
were recovered in a bath of fully aerated seawater and replaced
into their experimental holding tanks. Marked recapture of these
fish was facilitated by unique passive integrated transponder
(PIT) tags that had previously been implanted at approximately
15 wpc into their intra-peritoneal cavities (Zhang et al., 2019).
PRV-Associated Sample Collection and
Processing
Blood and tissue samples were collected from all fish assessed
with IRAP as well as from an equal number (n = 8) of
non-assessed fish directly from the holding tanks at 4, 25,
67, and 148 dpc that corresponded to the termination of an
IRAP (1, 4, 10 and 21 wpc). Additional fish (n = 3 per
treatment group) were sampled at 14, 39 and 53 dpc to
monitor PRV loads. Blood (1 mL) was collected via caudle
puncture and a 100 µL aliquot immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen for PRV screening and host gene expression analysis
by qPCR as previously described (Polinski et al., 2019).
Hematocrit was determined on a 10 µL aliquot transferred
to a sodium-heparin treated FisherbrandTM micro-hematocrit
tube and spun at 15,000 × g for 10 min. A 5–
10 µL aliquot
was smeared on a glass microscope slide for cytoplasmic
inclusion body visualization (Finstad et al., 2014). Remaining
blood was transferred to a heparinized vacutainer held on ice
(∼24 h) from which oxygen equilibria curves were determined
using a custom microplate-based, parallel assay, multi-cuvette
tonometry cell system maintained at 11.5◦C as described by
Lilly et al. (2013). Oxygen binding was determined at a constant
carbon dioxide fraction of 0.25% (1.90 mmHg) over 9 stepwise
increments of increasing oxygen balanced with nitrogen. Blood
pH was measured following 1 h incubation in a rotating
glass tonometer held at 11.5◦C with 21% oxygen and 0.25%
carbon dioxide balanced with nitrogen using two microelectrodes
(16–
705 and 16–
702; Microelectrodes Inc., Bedford, NH,
United States). Hemoglobin concentration (Hb) was measured
by the cyan-methemoglobin method using Drabkin’
s Reagent
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) and a heme-based
extinction coefficient of 11.01 mmol−1 cm−1 at a wavelength of
540 nm (Volkel and Berenbrink, 2000).
Approximately 200 mg of skeletal muscle (red and white) was
excised near the left lateral line of each fish at mid-body and
preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology.
Hearts were bisected longitudinally and one half preserved in
10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology while the
other half was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for PRV
screening and host gene expression (qPCR) analyses (Polinski
et al., 2019). Normalized quantities were scaled to the minimum
value for each gene prior to analysis and a five-step fourfold
dilution series of pooled cDNA was run on all plates to estimate
amplification efficiency and provide inter-run calibration where
necessary. Histopathological examination was conducted blind
to the treatments by two board certified pathologists at the BC
Ministry of Agriculture Animal Health Center (Abbotsford, BC,
Canada), as previously described (Marty et al., 2015; Garver et al.,
2016; Polinski et al., 2019). A detailed scoring report of this
histopathology evaluation is found in Zhang et al. (2019).
Statistical Analysis
Median pathology scores were assessed across time, as well as at
individual time points between BC and PRV treatment groups
and between fish exposed to IRAP assessments versus those taken
directly from the experimental holding tank, by Mann–
Whitney
U-tests without p-value multiplicity adjustment. Transcriptional
expression of host immune genes were compared between BC
and PRV treatment groups at each time point using two-way
ANOVA and Tukey’
s HSD multiple comparison tests of log
transformed data normalized to β-actin – a gene previously
demonstrated to have stable expression in blood and kidney
following PRV infection of salmon (Garver et al., 2016; Polinski
et al., 2016). Treatment effect (BC vs. PRV) on respiratory
performance indices and erythrocyte oxygen transport indices
were compared at each discrete sampling event up to 18 wpc (128
dpc) by two-way ANOVA and four multiple comparison tests:
Fisher’
s LSD (no family-wise p-value multiplicity adjustment),
Bonferroni (family-wise confidence 0.05), Sidak (family-wise
confidence 0.05), and Holm-Sidak (family-wise confidence 0.05).
Time-dependent changes in baseline respiratory performance
indices of the SC treatment group were assessed with one-
way ANOVA followed by Tukey’
s HSD multiple comparison
tests. The effect of blood homogenate injection (SC vs. BC)
was assessed by two-way ANOVA and Fisher’
s LSD, Bonferroni,
Sidak, and Holm-Sidak multiple comparison tests. Because some
but not all control (BC) fish developed mild heart pathology,
the effect of heart pathology on respiratory performance of
BC fish was assessed relative to fish without heart pathology
(independent of time) by a Students T-test for each index
with a family-wise confidence of 0.05 applied using the Holm-
Sidak method. A repeated measure two-way ANOVA was used
to compare all data collected at 21 wpc (IRAP) and 148
dpc (erythrocyte oxygen transport) along with Fisher’
s LSD,
Bonferroni, Sidak, and Holm-Sidak multiple comparison tests
in association with primary assessment data collected at 18 wpc
(IRAP) and 128 dpc (erythrocyte oxygen transport) indices.

in its untransformed variable (hydrogen ion concentration)
as previously suggested (Murphy, 1982). All analyses were
conducted using GraphPad Prism 6 or R v. 3.3.3 software.
RESULTS
PRV Viremia and Its Associated
Pathology Following Inoculation
Intraperitoneal injection of PRV generated an anticipated
high-load viremia in Atlantic salmon as evidenced by PRV
transcriptional blood loads reaching a peak by 25 dpc at
approximately 2.0 × 1010 mean reverse transcribed gRNA copies
per mL of host blood and maintained above 3.0 × 109 mean
copies per mL for the remainder of the study (Figure 1A).
Evidence of viral protein production was identified to be
proportionally large (mean 15 ± 2% s.e.m. single-stranded
PRV mRNA relative to double-stranded genomic PRV RNA)
during the early to peak infection period (4–
25 dpc), but
became substantially reduced (to approximately 0.5 ± 0.1%
single stranded mRNA) after peak viral loads were reached
(Figure 1A). Cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of reovirus
factories occurred transiently in up to 8% of erythrocytes
within PRV infected salmon (Figure 1C). While mild heart
and/or skeletal muscle inflammation was diagnosed in PRV-
infected salmon, a comparable prevalence and severity of heart
inflammation occurred in the BC-treatment group (p > 0.39) at
4, 25 and 148 dpc (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 1).
SC fish were not considered for histology in this study and
therefore it is unknown as to whether or not injection of blood
homogenate material alone was responsible for generating at least
some mild heart inflammation in BC fish. Nevertheless, PRV-
infected fish had a higher cumulative median severity score for
heart inflammation (p = 0.02) at 67 dpc (Figure 1D) and the
only fish with moderate heart inflammation (2 fish) or skeletal
muscle inflammation (1 fish) were in the PRV treatment group
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figures 2, 3). Similarly, while
low prevalence of mild skeletal muscle inflammation, scale pocket
inflammation, and myocardial degeneration of skeletal muscle
also occurred, these histological changes were not specific to PRV-
infected salmon (p > 0.27). The significantly (p = 0.01) increased
accumulation of skeletal muscle degeneration after IRAP testing
(7 of 64 IRAP fish) compared with fish from the experimental
holding tanks (0 of 64 IRAP fish) was independent of PRV
treatment. A similar independence from PRV was the significant
reduction (p = 0.003) in heart inflammation for salmon that
underwent an IRAP assessment (Supplementary Figure 1).
Host Transcriptional Responses to Viral
Infection
PRV-infected salmon generated innate immune responses in
the blood during initial and peak infection that contrasted the
adaptive immune responses seen in heart tissues during the
persistent infection phase. Expression of nine immune related
genes was specifically targeted in this study. Transcription of
genes encoding type-I interferon (ifna) and Myxovirus resistance
(mxa) –two well characterized salmon genes involved in innate
cellular recognition and defense against virus for nearly all cell
types – were up-regulated by a mean of 12–
15 fold early after
PRV entry (4 dpc) and by a mean of 4–
7 fold during peak viremia
(25 dpc; Figure 2). This blood expression pattern was contrasted
in heart tissues where only mxa significantly increased (mean
sixfold) early after PRV entry. However, expression for the cluster
of differentiation-8 receptor (cd8a) and granzyme-A (gzma) –
two transcripts exclusively associated with adaptive immune
cytotoxic T-cells and involved in intracellular antigen recognition
and cell mediated killing, respectively – were significantly
increased (mean of 4–
20 fold) in heart tissues of PRV infected fish
during the persistent phase of infection. This expression pattern
was not reciprocated in blood cells in response to persistent PRV,
which had generally low expression that was only significantly
up-regulated (mean 4–
8 fold) at 25 dpc during peak PRV
viremia (Figure 2).
To further explore the putative involvement of other
immune cells in PRV infected heart tissues, transcriptional gene
expression of gamma interferon (ifng; expressed by natural killer
cells, CD8+ T-cells and CD4+ T-cells) cluster of differentiation-4
receptor (CD4; expressed by CD4+ T-cells), interleukin-10 (il10;
expressed by monocytes, mast cells, and B-cells), interleukin-
12 (il12; expressed by dendritic cells and macrophages), and
interleukin-18 (il18; expressed by macrophages) revealed that
only ifng was significantly stimulated in response to PRV in
heart tissues (Supplementary Figure 4). This suggests that
CD8+ T-cells were likely the only immune cells involved in
the recognition of PRV in this instance. Other transcriptional
isoforms of interferon (i.e., ifnb, ifnc, and ifnd) have not shown
responsiveness to this Pacific-Canada isolation of PRV in blood,
purified erythrocyte, or heart tissues (MPP, unpublished data)
and thus were not evaluated in this study.

was not impaired by PRV infection at any time point in this
study despite a sustained, high-load PRV viremia, even when
inclusion bodies were microscopically visible. Mean hematocrit
(>40%) remained well above a previously estimated threshold
of functional anemia (25%) in salmon (Gallaugher et al., 1995)
throughout the 21-week experiment. While hematocrit of the BC-
and PRV-treatment groups were always similar when sampled
after respirometry, both hematocrit and Hb concentration were
transitorily lower by about 7% for the PRV-treatment group at 4
dpc (Figure 3). At 67 dpc, hematocrit but not Hb concentration
was again transitorily lower. Importantly, the BC injection
significantly influenced hematocrit relative to SC at 4, 25, and
67 dpc (Supplementary Figure 5), suggesting that components
of the foreign blood homogenate used for viral delivery in this
study elicited its own minor physiological changes. Specific to
PRV, neither Hb oxygen binding potential as measured by partial
pressure required to achieve 50% saturation (P50) nor blood pH

was affected by PRV at any infection stage as determined by two-
way ANOVA or multiple comparison tests that control family-
wise type-I error (Bonferroni, Sidak, Holm–
Sidak; p-values
provided in Zhang et al., 2019). Hemoglobin saturation with 21%
oxygen (Hb21%O2) was significantly but only slightly lower in
PRV-infected salmon at 148 dpc (Figure 3).
Respiratory Capacity and Capabilities
Piscine orthoreovirus viremia had no major or sustained effects
on the respiratory indices measured in Atlantic salmon during
any phase of the infection process. Neither two-way ANOVA,
Bonferroni, Sidak, nor Holm-Sidak comparisons identified
significant (p < 0.05) differences between PRV and BC treatment
groups for any of the respiratory indices tested at any time
point during the study (Figure 4; Zhang et al., 2019). Fisher’
s
LSD, which is the only test used in this study that does
not control for family-wise type-I error, identified four small
significant differences. At week 10, PRV-infected salmon had
a 12 ± 3% (mean ± s.e.m.) higher
˙
MO2max, a 16 ± 4%
higher AAS and a 30 ± 13% higher EPOCdur, while at week
21, PRV-infected salmon had a 19 ± 22% lower T0.8 ˙
MO2max
(Figure 4). One potential interpretation of these results is that
PRV subtly improved aerobic capacities during the persistent
phase of infection that necessitated a longer recovery period
following exhaustion. A more probable explanation, however,
is that these changes are contained within normal biological
variability and that significance assigned in these instances
(4 per 70 total comparisons; 5.7%) represents type I family-
wise error uncontrolled by Fisher’
s LSD (Wright, 1992). This
is supported by the lack of significance identified by two-way
ANOVA in comparing treatments across all four non-repeated
measures sampling events (p > 0.26 for each index). This is also
supported by the fact that BC injection alone caused significant
(p < 0.05 family-wise error adjusted) contributions to aerobic
capabilities (23 ± 4% increase in SMR; 24 ± 2% decrease FAS)
and exhaustion recovery (26 ± 5% decrease in EPOCdur) at 10
wpc relative to SC injection (Supplementary Figure 6), and that
time also had a significant effect on SMR, FAS, EPOC, EPOCdur,
RMR, T0.5 ˙
MO2max, T0.8 ˙
MO2max and ILOS as determined by two-
way ANOVA (Zhang et al., 2019) – observations that suggest
physiological plasticity. Indeed, principle component analysis
suggested that, independent of treatment, time in association
with length and fish condition were the predictor variables
contributing to the greatest variance in respiratory performance

in this study (Supplementary Figure 7). Subsequent targeted
consideration of time in relation to respiratory indices in the SC
group identified significant (p < 0.05) temporal effects on aerobic
activity, exercise recovery, routine activity, agitation level, and
anaerobic performance (Supplementary Figure 8). Specifically,
baseline aerobic activity (SMR) increased 40 ± 6% over 18 weeks
of non-repeated measures sampling and was accompanied by a
55 ± 8% increase in routine activity level (RMR), 353 ± 88%
increase in mild agitation (T0.5 ˙
MO2max), 33 ± 7% increase in the
rate of recovery from exhaustion (both EPOC and EPOCdur) and
a 20–
30% decrease in tolerance to hypoxia (20 ± 2% increase
O2crit; 29 ± 4% increase ILOS).
Furthermore, we found that tolerance to hypoxia at 21 wpc
was improved after the severe acute hypoxia challenge at 18 wpc,
which suggests that the hypoxia tolerance in Atlantic salmon
may be a phenotypically plastic trait. Fish in all treatment
groups had improved ILOS (mean decrease 11 ± 1%) during
their second acute hypoxia exposure which was administered
3 weeks after their first (Supplementary Figure 9). However, no
respiratory indices were statistically different between SC, BC,
and PRV treatment groups at 21wpc following p-value multiple
comparison adjustment (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 6).
Lastly, regardless of whether BC treated Atlantic salmon did
or did not contain mild heart inflammation, there was no
significant impairment to any of the physiological performance
measurements. In fact, the cumulative variability of BC treated
fish was almost always encompassed within the variability
observed for the SC group. When significant differences in
physiological parameters were observed between BC and SC fish,
it was not temporally aligned with the highest prevalence of
heart inflammation (10 wpc vs. 21 WPC), further suggesting the
minor heart inflammation in BC treatment group had no effect
on respiratory physiology (Supplementary Figure 10).
DISCUSSION
As an essential life-support system, cardiorespiratory function
can be differentially fine-tuned to the swimming needs of
specific populations of wild Pacific salmon (Eliason et al., 2011).
Thus, the consequences of systematic infections that harm
erythrocyte and cardiac functions should be readily evident from
impaired respiratory performance. We discovered, however,
that high-load PRV viremia in Atlantic salmon did not affect
oxygen affinity and carrying capacity of erythrocytes, nor could
sustained or appreciable differences be identified in 14 indices
of respiratory capabilities despite transient cellular activation
of antiviral response pathways. The lack of functional harm
to Atlantic salmon infected with PRV highlights that, in a
current era of unprecedented virus discovery, infection does not
necessarily imply bodily harm and viral load is not always a
suitable predictor of disease within a host organism. Whether
other subtypes of PRV, such as the PRV1 associated with HSMI
in Norway or PRV2 associated with anemia in Japan, harms
cardiorespiratory function as has been previously suggested
(Olsen et al., 2015; Takano et al., 2016; Lund et al., 2017)
still needs further experimental testing. It is also unknown
if variable temperatures may affect PRV associated disease or
how this may impact host physiological responses if or when
disease occurs.
The high-load viremia and temporal infection dynamics
resulting from injection of a PRV-loaded blood homogenate
in this study closely mirrored previous challenge trials with
Atlantic salmon in Pacific Canada (Garver et al., 2016; Polinski
et al., 2019). However, here we increased the inoculating dose
approximately 10-fold compared to previous work and harvested
the virus during peak replication to maximize the PRV load
and infection intensity. Even so, peak systemic PRV loads
and temporal phases of infection remained nearly identical to
previous studies, indicating that a maximum systemic PRV
carrying capacity was likely reached at approximately 10–
100
billion genomic copies per mL blood –a capacity that is equal
to, if not higher, than loads generated in natural or aquaculture
systems (Lovoll et al., 2012; Garseth et al., 2013; Marty et al.,
2015). Therefore, our laboratory study simulated a relevant
‘
worst-case’model for assessing physiological harm associated
with PRV load intensity.

Given that PRV specifically targets the heart and erythrocytes
of Atlantic salmon, our hypothesis was comprehensively tested
by assessing: (i) oxygen binding properties of erythrocytes; (ii)
respiratory capabilities in normoxia; (iii) respiratory capabilities
in hypoxia; and (iv) respiratory capabilities after an acute
hypoxic stress. Transient cytoplasmic inclusions of erythrocytes
are a common attribute of acute systemic PRV infection and
indicative of viral replication (Finstad et al., 2014; Wessel
et al., 2015; Polinski et al., 2019). Here, we provide evidence
that oxygen binding properties of erythrocytes are unaffected
by these erythrocyte inclusions and correspondingly high
PRV transcriptional loads even with the erythrocytes having
transient innate immune responses as observed previously
(Polinski et al., 2019). Importantly, these innate responses
cannot
be
energetically
expensive
because
neither
SMR,
nor viral replication, nor erythrocyte function was affected.
Thus, we conclude that the PRV replication process within
erythrocytes was likely commensal to normal cellular functioning
in this instance.
While the primary site of PRV replication is presumed
to
be
within
erythrocytes
(Finstad
et
al.,
2014;
Garver
et al., 2016; Polinski et al., 2019), cardiomyocytes are a
site for secondary infection linked to the development of
HSMI in Atlantic salmon. Indeed, both innate (interferon)
and adaptive (cytotoxic T-cell) immune responses have been
implicated in this cardiac response (Mikalsen et al., 2012).
Here, we confirmed increased transcription of markers for
cytotoxic T-cells (cd8a) and their directed killing of target
cells
(grzm)
in
PRV-infected
heart
tissues,
even
in
the
absence of notable heart inflammation. However, the heart
initiated only minor transcription of innate interferon responses
to virus (ifna and mxa), which suggests that (i) innate
immune recognition of PRV via pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) is unlikely involved in the initiation of PRV-associated
inflammation, and (ii) major histocompatibility complex-1
(MHC-1) presentation of PRV antigen to mature cytotoxic
T-cells is most probably the initiator for the inflammatory heart
lesions associated with PRV. This is supported by the previous
identification of significant T-cell involvement (Yousaf et al.,
2012, 2013), specifically CD8 cytotoxic T-cells (Mikalsen et al.,
2012), during HSMI. Our study also suggests that the other
immune cells putatively involved during HSMI identified in
previous studies (e.g., B-cells, macrophages and CD4+ helper
T-cells) may be secondarily activated as a result of severe
inflammation and necrosis rather than in response to PRV
directly; although virus genotypic factors may also play a
role. Why erythrocytes are not similarly targeted for cytotoxic
T-cell mediated killing via MHC-1 presentation in the blood is
currently unclear.
The North American genotype of PRV1 in our study
produced mild and occasionally moderate heart inflammation
in a Pacific domesticated Mowi-McConnell strain of Atlantic
salmon using an apparently maximum virulence model system
(Garver et al., 2016; Polinski et al., 2019). This was clearly
not HSMI, as the severity of inflammation was generally
indistinguishable from control fish. It was certainly not associated

with compromised heart function; otherwise the respiratory
capabilities of PRV-infected salmon would not have been as
robust as those of controls. By comparison, a Norwegian
genotype of PRV1, which caused moderate heart lesions
(classified as HSMI) in a cohabitation model system, produced
similar PRV loads and yielded transient impairments to some
but not all cardiorespiratory functions (Lund et al., 2017). The
juxtaposition of these regionally divergent findings supports
three important conclusions:
(i) The Atlantic salmon heart is functionally resilient to mild
(present study) and perhaps moderate (Lund et al., 2017)

inflammation; whether severe inflammation affects cardiac
performance has yet to be tested.
(ii) Neither the presence, nor a high systemic load of PRV
is a useful proxy for predicting disease in salmon.
While particularly evident in western North America
(and possibly elsewhere), it also appears true in Norway
given that many PRV-infected salmon farms do not
develop HSMI (Lovoll et al., 2012) and systemic PRV
loads in Norway challenge trials do not always correlate
with heart inflammation severity (Lund et al., 2017;
Wessel et al., 2017).
(iii) There is regional disparity in PRV’
s ability to cause
respiratory harm. Identifying how much of this regional
variability is dependent on viral genotype, host genotype,
or environmental factors requires further investigation.
Despite the lack of sustained and major changes in the
IRAP indices as a result of severe viremia associated with
the PRV injection, many of the IRAP indices did change
within the SC treatment over 18 weeks, as did some of the
BC and PRV treatment groups. Whether these changes (e.g.,
increased SMR and RMR along with decreased EPOC and
EPOCdur) were a result of time in seawater, greater exploratory
behaviors, progressively reducing the fish population in the
tank, or related to growth is unclear. However, they point to
physiological plasticity, as did the changes seen following the
severe hypoxic challenge (e.g., reduced ILOS) evaluated at 21
wpc. The present findings also revealed that a saline injection
is not an adequate control for injecting PRV-loaded blood
homogenate into Atlantic salmon because significant differences
were seen been SC and BC treatments for a few respiratory
indices (e.g., increased transient SMR and reduced FAS and
EPOCdur). Lastly, although the respiratory responses to the
extreme hypoxic exposure were notable, they must be applied
with great caution since such a severe exposure is highly unlikely
in either a wild or farmed salmon setting and would have led to
mortality had we not actively revived fish after they had lost their
righting reflex.
CONCLUSION
This study provides strong empirical evidence that a host with
an extremely high-load PRV infection can sustain its respiratory
functions. It also supports previous laboratory investigations
which have found PRV to be orphaned from establishing a
physiologically relevant disease state in salmon of western
North America and provides robust evidence to dispel the
concern that respiratory performance is compromised by PRV
in the absence of overt disease. Thus, the global concern
about the negative impact of this virus to salmon should
be reassessed. Indeed, while several studies have associated
PRV with diseased salmon in Pacific Canada (Di Cicco
et al., 2017, 2018), current experimental evidence does not
suggest that PRV is the only factor for initiating these disease
conditions (Garver et al., 2015, 2016; Polinski et al., 2016,
2019) which may have a more complex etiology. Regardless,
PRV emerges as an atypical example of a virus with putative
pathogenic properties because the total quantity of virus within
an infected organism appears to have little to no bearing
on whether the organism becomes diseased and experiences
physiological harm. In contrast, this study supports the
hypothesis that host recognition rather than direct PRV virulence
is likely a key and variable factor in shifting this putative
commensal relationship into a disease state. This becomes
an important paradigm to consider in assessing the disease
causing potential of hitherto uncharacterized animal viruses as
they are discovered.
