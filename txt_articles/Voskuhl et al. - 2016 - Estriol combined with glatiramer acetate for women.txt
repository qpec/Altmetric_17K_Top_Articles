Summary
Background Relapses of multiple sclerosis decrease during pregnancy, when the hormone estriol is increased. Estriol 
treatment is anti-infl
 ammatory and neuroprotective in preclinical studies. In a small single-arm study of people with 
multiple sclerosis estriol reduced gadolinium-enhancing lesions and was favourably immunomodulatory. We 
assessed whether estriol treatment reduces multiple sclerosis relapses in women.
Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial at 16 academic neurology centres in the 
USA, between June 28, 2007, and Jan 9, 2014. Women aged 18–50 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
were randomly assigned (1:1) with a random permuted block design to either daily oral estriol (8 mg) or placebo, each 
in combination with injectable glatiramer acetate 20 mg daily. Patients and all study personnel, except for pharmacists 
and statisticians, were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was annualised relapse rate after 
24 months, with a signifi
 cance level of p=0·10. Relapses were confi
 rmed by an increase in Expanded Disability Status 
Scale score assessed by an independent physician. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00451204.
Findings We enrolled 164 patients: 83 were allocated to the estriol group and 81 were allocated to the placebo group. 
The annualised confi
 rmed relapse rate was 0·25 relapses per year (95% CI 0·17–0·37) in the estriol group versus 
0·37 relapses per year (0·25–0·53) in the placebo group (adjusted rate ratio 0·63, 95% CI 0·37–1·05; p=0·077). The 
proportion of patients with serious adverse events did not diff
 er substantially between the estriol group and the 
placebo group (eight [10%] of 82 patients vs ten [13%] of 76 patients). Irregular menses were more common in the 
estriol group than in the placebo group (19 [23%] vs three [4%], p=0·0005), but vaginal infections were less common 
(one [1%] vs eight [11%], p=0·0117). There were no diff
 erences in breast fi
 brocystic disease, uterine fi
 broids, or 
endometrial lining thickness as assessed by clinical examination, mammogram, uterine ultrasound, or endometrial 
lining biopsy.
Interpretation Estriol plus glatiramer acetate met our criteria for reducing relapse rates, and treatment was well 
tolerated over 24 months. These results warrant further investigation in a phase 3 trial.

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune, neurodegenerative 
disease of the CNS.1 Relapses are decreased by more than 
70% during the last trimester of pregnancy,2 when 
oestrogen and progesterone concentrations are highest.3 
Pregnancy is a state of temporary immune modulation 
enabling survival of the fetus as a half-foreign allograft.4 
Other cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as 
psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, also improve during 
pregnancy.5
Estriol is an oestrogen unique to pregnancy, made by the 
fetal–placental unit, and reaches highest concentrations in 
the last trimester. We postulated that increased 
concentrations of estriol might mediate a decrease in 
relapses. Preclinical studies of multiple sclerosis showed 
that estriol treatment has both anti-infl
 ammatory and 
neuroprotective properties, mediated through binding to 
oestrogen receptors expressed in the immune system and 
the CNS.6 In a small phase 2, single-arm, crossover clinical 
trial7 of estriol treatment for ten women with multiple 
sclerosis, monthly brain MRI showed signifi
 cant 
reductions in gadolinium-enhancing lesions during 
6 months of treatment compared with 6 months before 
treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells had 
signifi
 cantly increased expression of interleukin 5 and 
interleukin 10 and decreased concentrations of tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) α and matrix metalloproteinase 9.8,9 
When estriol treatment was discontinued for 6 months, 
both enhancing lesions and immune responses returned 
to pre-treatment levels. Furthermore, when estriol was

enhancing lesions and immunomodulation returned.7–9
Estriol has been used for several decades throughout 
Europe and Asia for treating menopausal symptoms.11–13 
A Women’s Health Initiative study14 done in 2002 to 
assess whether premarin (a complex mix of conjugated 
oestrogens) protects against coronary heart disease in 
menopausal women aged 50–79 years was stopped 
prematurely 
because 
of 
an 
increased 
risk 
for 
cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, whereas the 
number of colorectal cancers and hip fractures decreased. 
Premarin includes estradiol, an oestrogen that is present 
at low concentrations in women with normal menstrual 
cycles and in oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives 
have also been associated with cardiovascular risks in 
non-menopausal women, particularly in those who 
smoke. Whether oral contraceptives are a cause of breast 
cancer or if they enable breast cancer to be detected 
earlier is unclear.15 The distinction between estradiol and 
estriol is important, because oestrogens are not all alike.16 
Estriol binds to ERα and ERβ weaker than does estradiol, 
and it binds to ERβ stronger than it does to ERα.17 
Oestrogenic eff
 ects on breast cancer and cardiovascular 
disease are mediated by ERα. Indeed, ERβ binding can 
antagonise ERα binding in some tissues,17 with estriol 
treatment being protective in preclinical models of breast 
cancer.18 
Finally, 
estradiol 
also 
induces 
uterine 
endometrial proliferation, which can lead to cancer.19 
Thus, women taking oral contraceptives or hormone 
replacement therapy are not treated with unopposed 
oestrogens,10 but rather in combination with a progestin 
to protect the uterus.15 Estriol is a weaker stimulator of 
endometrial proliferation than is estradiol, such that it 
can be taken unopposed for up to a year, but after that, it 
too should be taken in combination with a progestin for 
uterine protection.15
Here, we report results of a phase 2 clinical trial to test 
the safety and effi
  cacy of oral estriol as an add-on 
treatment in women with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this double blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 
parallel group trial at 16 academic neurology clinics in 
the USA, starting on June 28, 2007, with the last clinic 
visit on Jan 9, 2014, and last follow-up questionnaire on 
July 10, 2014. Eligible patients were women aged 
18–50 years, with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis according to the McDonald criteria,20 a 
baseline score of 0–4·5 on the Expanded Disability Status 
Scale (EDSS), and relapsing disease activity in the 
previous 24 months. Key exclusion criteria were 
progressive multiple sclerosis, taking glatiramer acetate 
for more than 2 months before randomisation, currently 
smoking, and taking other concurrent disease-modifying 
or hormonal treatments (appendix pp 6–8). The study 
was approved by the ethics committee at each site and 
participants provided written informed consent at 
screening. The National Institutes of Health appointed a 
data and safety monitoring board, which monitored 
safety and effi
  cacy (appendix p 4) with representatives 
from the National Institutes of Health and the National 
Multiple Sclerosis Society serving as observing members. 
The protocol is available online.
Randomisation and masking
A statistician who had no further role in the trial 
randomly assigned patients (1:1) to receive oral estriol 
(8 mg daily) or oral placebo (matched by appearance and 
taste) using a computer-generated code with random 
permuted block design (block size six). We stratifi
 ed 
randomisation by glatiramer acetate treatment during 
screening, using Zelen’s method21 to ensure that 
treatment assignment was balanced within each clinic.
Patients, treating physicians, and all investigators 
assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for studies published between Jan 1, 
1980, and June 25, 2015, with the terms “multiple sclerosis” 
and “estriol”. We included clinical trials, clinical observations, 
and preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo in animals and 
human beings. We also searched abstracts from the American 
and the European Committees for Treatment and Research in 
Multiple Sclerosis from the past 5 years. Besides laboratory 
studies, we found one single-arm, crossover clinical trial of 
estriol for multiple sclerosis. ClinicalTrials.gov lists an ongoing 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of estriol treatment for 
relapsing-remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis with 
cognitive testing as the primary outcome (registration number 
NCT01466114).
Added value of this study
This study is the fi
 rst randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 
oral estriol treatment for women with relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis to be completed. We showed the safety and 
benefi
 cial eff
 ects on relapse rates compared with placebo.
Implications of all the available evidence
These fi
 ndings are consistent with the hypothesis that 
increased concentrations of estriol during pregnancy might 
mediate, at least in part, the protective eff
 ect of pregnancy on 
relapse rates. A phase 3 study of estriol in relapsing-remitting 
multiple sclerosis is needed to test these fi
 ndings and to explore 
potential eff
 ects on disabilities.

Study statisticians and pharmacy staff
  were not masked to 
treatment, but they had no interaction with patients.
Procedures
All 
patients 
started 
glatiramer 
acetate 
injections 
(20 mg/day) within 2 months of randomisation. Patients 
provided their own glatiramer acetate. To avoid patients 
taking unopposed oestrogens, patients in the estriol group 
also received a progestin (norethindrone 0·7 mg) daily for 
2 weeks every 3 months, starting at 6 months; patients in 
the placebo group received a second placebo matched to 
progestin. After 24 months of treatment, a 4-week taper 
began for both estriol and placebo (appendix p 21).
Examining neurologists did the EDSS assessments, 
whereas treating neurologists managed patient care 
including treatment of relapses, and gynaecologists 
managed gynaecological issues. The appendix pp 9–14 
shows details of the blood laboratory tests for safety, 
methods for measuring estriol blood concentration, MRI 
analyses of enhancing lesions7 and brain volumes,22,23 and 
voxel-based morphometry for regional loss of grey 
matter.24
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was annualised confi
 rmed relapse 
rate at 24 months. A confi
 rmed relapse was defi
 ned as 
new neurological symptoms or worsening of pre-existing 
symptoms, lasting at least 48 h in a participant who had 
been neurologically stable or improving in the previous 
30 days, accompanied by an objective neurological 
change (worsening by 0·5 points on the EDSS or 
worsening by ≥1·0 points on the pyramidal, cerebellar, 
brainstem, or visual functional system scores),25 not due 
to fatigue alone and not associated with fever or infection.
The secondary endpoints were time to fi
 rst confi
 rmed 
relapse, annualised relapse event rate, and time to fi
 rst 
relapse event, all at 24 months. A relapse event was 
defi
 ned as meeting the criteria for a confi
 rmed relapse 
without documentation of a change in EDSS score. 
Other prespecifi
 ed outcomes included safety, blood 
estriol concentration (at 3 months, 6 months, 
12 months, 18 months, and 24 months), proportion of 
patients with confi
 rmed disability progression (defi
 ned 
as an increase of EDSS of ≥1·0 point in participants 
with baseline score of ≥1·0, or an increase of ≥1·5 points 
for those with a baseline score of 0, each sustained for 
at least 6 months),  
change from baseline in EDSS score, 
Modifi
 ed Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) score, Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI) score, Multiple Sclerosis 
Quality of Life (MS QoL) score, Multiple Sclerosis 
Functional Composite (MSFC) score, and Paced 
Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) score, as well as 
enhancing lesions, T2 lesions, and brain volume by 
MRI at 24 months.
All analyses were planned at 24 months, the end of the 
study. We also did analyses at 12 months. The National 
Institutes of Health would not fund a trial with a placebo-
only comparator arm for this duration because approved 
treatments are available. However, because glatiramer 
acetate takes 9 months to reach full potency,26 the fi
 rst 
9 months of the study approximated a comparison of 
estriol only with placebo only, which could be captured 
by an analysis at 12 months.
We did post-hoc analyses of whole grey matter volume, 
cortical grey matter volume, white matter volume, 
PASAT scores stratifi
 ed by median PASAT score at 
baseline, brain volumes by MRI stratifi
 ed by presence or 
absence of enhancing lesions, proportion of patients 
with 
enhancing 
lesions, 
correlation 
of 
estriol 
concentration with relapses and with enhancing lesions, 
and correlation of PASAT scores with grey matter 
volumes (appendix pp 10,11).
Statistical analysis
We calculated that we would need a sample size of 
150 patients to provide 80% power to detect a 33% 
reduction in relapse rates in the estriol group compared 
with the placebo group (0·75 in the estriol group vs 1·18 
in the placebo group) at 24 months with a two-sided 
signifi
 cance level of 0·10.

We assessed the diff
 erence in annualised confi
 rmed 
relapse rates between groups with a negative binomial 
regression model adjusted for age, baseline EDSS score 
(<2 vs ≥2), number of relapses in the 12 months before 
the study (≤1 vs >1), time since diagnosis (<1 vs ≥1 year), 
previous glatiramer acetate treatment (none vs previous 
or current), and previous interferon beta treatment (yes 
vs no). Annualised relapse rates included all events for 
the entire 24 months or those occurring until the last 
visit adjusted for the time for which the participant was 
in the study.
Phase 2 trials of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
often have a biomarker as their primary endpoint. By 
contrast, we used a clinical outcome for three reasons: 
the National Institutes of Health want to focus on 
relapses as a basis for powering a future phase 3 trial, 
pregnancy decreases relapses,2 and a small phase 2 trial 
with monthly MRI scans has already been done.7 
Because this trial was phase 2, we used a signifi
 cance 
level of α=0·10 for all analyses, as has been used in 
cancer trials27 and in phase 2 trials of stroke,28 
amyotrophic 
lateral 
sclerosis,29 
and 
Parkinson’s 
disease.30 The use of p<0·10 as signifi
 cant in phase 2 
trials was considered stringent enough to assess the 
potential for clinical effi
  cacy of a new intervention, 
while controlling for false positives and avoiding the 
much higher costs of the larger sample sizes needed to 
achieve a p value of less than 0·05.27,28
For the analysis of time to fi
 rst relapse, we used 
Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests to estimate 
and compare the proportion of patients with fi
 rst 
relapse at each timepoint. We used a Cox proportional 
hazards model to compare the proportion of patients 
with relapse at 12 months and 24 months, adjusting for 
age, baseline EDSS score (<2 vs ≥2), number of relapses 
in the 12 months before the study (≤1 vs >1), duration of 
multiple sclerosis (<1 vs ≥1 year), previous glatiramer 
acetate treatment (never vs past or current), and 
previous interferon treatment (yes vs no). We used 
mixed eff
 ects models to analyse repeated measurement 
outcomes with the random eff
 ect of participant to 
account for within patient correlation. For the 
exploratory 
analyses 
of 
EDSS, 
PASAT, 
fatigue, 
depression, and quality of life,31 we used a linear mixed 
eff
 ects model to compare treatment groups at 12 months 
and 24 months. We used a mixed eff
 ects negative 
binomial regression model and linear mixed eff
 ects 
model to compare enhancing lesion number and 
volume (log-transformed) between treatment groups at 
all follow-up visits, and a mixed eff
 ects logistic model to 
compare the number of participants with gadolinium-
enhancing lesions, with a linear mixed eff
 ects model to 
compare the percentage change in brain volumes 
between treatment groups. We also used a mixed eff
 ects 
logistic regression model to assess the association 
between the number of enhancing lesions and the 
occurrence of relapses and estriol concentrations. 
Finally, we used a linear mixed eff
 ects model to assess 
the association between PASAT change and percentage 
brain volume change, between PASAT change and 
estriol concentration, and between compliance and 
estriol concentration. We did all the analyses for the 
intention-to-treat population, which included all 
patients who were enrolled and for whom data existed 
after taking at least one dose of study drug. The 
appendix shows details of the sensitivity analyses. 
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,

Results
We screened 236 patients, 164 of whom we enrolled 
(fi
 gure 1). 158 participants received study drug and had at 
least one visit thereafter. Of the 158 patients, 82 were 
assigned to the estriol group and 76 were assigned to the 
placebo group. Baseline characteristics were balanced 
across groups (table 1). The proportion of complications 
was similar in each group (60 [73%] of 82 patients in the 
estriol group vs 56 [74%] of 76 in the placebo group).
After 24 months, the confi
 rmed relapse rate was 
0·25 relapses per year (95% CI 0·17–0·37) in the estriol 
group versus 0·37 relapses per year in the placebo group 
(0·25–0·53), with an adjusted rate ratio of 0·63 
(0·37–1·05; p=0·077; table 2, appendix p 22). The 
annualised relapse event rate was also reduced in the 
estriol group compared with the placebo group (table 2, 
appendix p 22). Time to confi
 rmed relapse was also 
signifi
 cantly lower in the estriol group than in the placebo 
group according to our threshold of p<0·1, but time to 
relapse event was not (fi
 gure 2, table 2). We had similar 
results for the exploratory analyses of data up to 
12 months: the annualised confi
 rmed relapse rate was 
reduced in the estriol group compared with the placebo 
group, as were the annualised relapse event rate and the 
time to fi
 rst confi
 rmed relapse, but the time to fi
 rst 
relapse event did not diff
 er signifi
 cantly between groups 
(table 2, appendix p 22).
Estriol was well tolerated, with no substantial 
diff
 erences between groups in the number or proportion 
of patients with serious adverse events (table 3). 
Laboratory abnormalities were the same in each group

(data not shown). Irregular menses were more common 
in the estriol group than in the placebo group, whereas 
vaginal infections were less common (table 3). We 
recorded no substantial diff
 erences in breast fi
 brocystic 
disease and no mammograms were positive for 
malignancy (table 3). Uterine fi
 broids occurred in similar 
proportions in each group (table 3). There was no 
substantial diff
 erence between groups in the number of 
patients with uterine endometrial thickness greater than 
8 mm (table 3). Finally, because oestrogen and 
progesterone can cause some irregularity in menstrual 
cycles, we used criteria for clinically relevant increased 
menstrual fl
 ow in an algorithm with uterine lining 
thickness to trigger a uterine endometrial lining biopsy 
(detailed in the protocol). There was little diff
 erence 
between treatment groups in the proportion of patients 
who had these biopsies (table 3), and no biopsy showed 
abnormal proliferation.
Total serum estriol concentration increased in the estriol 
group (appendix pp 15, 23) and remained high through to 
12 months. Estriol concentration then decreased, with a 
signifi
 cant decrease by 24 months (16·2 ng/mL [SD 25·3] 
at 3 months vs 10·1 ng/mL [SD 6·9] at 24 months; 
diff

signifi
 cantly decreased between 3 months and 24 months 
(data not shown), suggesting poor compliance as the 
reason for the diff
 erence. In a post-hoc analysis, we 
assessed compliance using pill counts and calendars and 
found strong correlations between estriol concentrations 
and compliance in the estriol group (regression coeffi
  cient 
1·12 [SE 0·34]; p=0·001). Overall, compliance at 24 months 
was much the same in the estriol group (n=58; mean 
0·88, SD 0·19; median 0·96, IQR 0·87–0·99) and the 
placebo group (n=55; mean 0·89, SD 0·13; median 0·94, 
IQR 0·84–0·99). Estriol concentration was inversely 
correlated with relapses (regression coeffi
  cient –0·21 
[SE 0·11]; p=0·057), and gadolinium-enhancing lesions 
(–0·77 [SE 0·34]; p=0·028).
We recorded signifi
 cant improvements with estriol 
compared with placebo for fatigue after 24 months 
(p=0·009; table 4). Cognitive testing as measured by 
PASAT showed no diff
 erences at 24 months; however, at 
12 months, PASAT scores were signifi
 cantly greater in the 
estriol group than in the placebo group (table 4), and in a 
post-hoc analysis of patients with a score of less than the 
median of 55 at baseline, improvements at 12 months 
were 4·7 points in patients who received estriol and 1·6 in 
patients who received placebo (p=0·011), whereas there 
was no signifi
 cant eff
 ect in patients with higher scores at 
baseline (p=0·694; table 4). We found no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erence for EDSS, depression score, MS QoL, or MSFC 
(table 4). Because estriol concentrations were low at 
24 months, which is when PASAT scores were no longer 
signifi
 cantly improved in the estriol group compared with 
the placebo group, we assessed correlations between 
estriol 
concentration 
and 
PASAT 
score. 
Estriol 
concentration was directly correlated with PASAT score 
(regression coeffi
  cient 0·36 [SE 0·17]; p=0·03). We 
recorded similar benefi
 ts of estriol treatment on 7/24 
Spatial Recall cognitive testing (appendix p 16).
Table 5 shows the results of prespecifi
 ed exploratory 
and post-hoc MRI outcomes. We recorded no diff
 erences 
between groups for the prespecifi
 ed endpoints related to 
enhancing or T2 lesions or whole brain volume. Post-hoc 
analyses showed a diff
 erence between groups at 
12 months for cortical grey matter (p=0·056) and white 
matter (p=0·090). In patients without enhancing lesions 
at baseline, those in the estriol group had larger cortical 
grey matter volume than did those in the placebo group 
(p=0·043), whereas in patients who had enhancing 
lesions at baseline, those in the estriol group had smaller 
white matter volumes than did those in the placebo 
group (0·012). The appendix (p 24) shows localisation of 
the estriol treatment eff
 ect on grey matter by voxel-based 
morphometry. 
Post-hoc analysis showed that cortical grey matter 
volume by MRI correlated directly with PASAT cognitive 
test improvement in estriol-treated participants (regression 
coeffi
  cient 0·82 [SE 0·38]; p=0·032), but not in placebo-
treated participants (regression coeffi
  cient –0·17 [SE 0·38]; 
p=0·660).
Discussion
Estriol treatment reduced relapse rates compared with 
placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis. The relapse rate ratio between the two groups 
was nearly the same as in the original sample size 
calculation; however, the relapse rates for both groups 
were considerably lower than expected. As a result, the 
power of the study was reduced to 74%, but the primary 
endpoint of a reduction in annualised confi
 rmed relapse 
rates at p<0·1 was reached. Our results suggest that 
estriol might have a role in decreased relapses during 
pregnancy.
Estriol is considered to be the safest oestrogen on the 
basis of data for its worldwide use for menopausal

symptoms over 40 years.11–13 The standard daily dose for 
menopause symptoms (2 mg) is generally lower than the 
dose we used, although some studies have used up to 
16 mg. In this study, a dose of 8 mg induced an estriol 
concentration equivalent to that present early in the 
second trimester of pregnancy, consistent with previous 
fi
 ndings.7  Because estriol concentrations continue to 
increase during pregnancy, the blood concentration 
induced by estriol treatment was below that usually 
present in the third trimester, when the eff
 ect of 
pregnancy in protection against relapse is greatest.2 Even 
so, we postulated that the  concentration achieved might 
be suffi
  cient to exert protective eff
 ects. We targeted 
second trimester levels to induce third trimester 
protection. This dose was safe and well tolerated, 
including in the uterus and breast. However, as is the 
case with all new drugs, the long-term eff
 ects will be 
unknown until larger and longer studies are done.

surprising because oral contraceptives are known to

ratio of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement 
would be controversial in healthy individuals for whom 
no toxic eff
 ects are acceptable. However, for patients with 
a disabling disease such as multiple sclerosis, the risk-to-
benefi
 t ratio is diff
 erent.
Some patients who experienced menstrual irregularity 
might have then deduced their treatment allocation, but 
follow-up questionnaires did not suggest substantial 
unmasking. Furthermore, unmasking would not have 
aff
 ected the primary outcome because each relapse was 
confi
 rmed by an increase in the EDSS score as 
determined by an independent examiner who was not 
aware of adverse events.
Post-hoc MRI studies using volumetry at 12 months 
showed less cortical grey matter atrophy in the estriol 
group than in the placebo group. This eff
 ect was 
independently confi
 rmed by voxel-based morphometry to 
show which grey matter regions were preserved by 
treatment. Furthermore, patients in the estriol group 
without enhancing lesions had less cortical grey matter 
atrophy than did those in the placebo group, suggesting a 
direct neuroprotective eff
 ect independent from anti-
infl
 ammatory eff
 ects, which is consistent with preclinical 
studies.6
Cortical grey matter atrophy on brain MRI has been 
associated with cognitive dysfunction in patients with 
multiple sclerosis.34,35 In addition, oestrogen treatment 
improves cognitive dysfunction in women without 
multiple sclerosis who have had ovariectomy,36 and 
oestrogen treatment of ovariectomised animals increases 
dendritic spines and synapses in cerebral grey matter.37–39 
We showed that higher serum estriol concentrations 
might be needed for benefi
 cial eff
 ects on cognition. 
Cortical grey matter sparing in the estriol group 
compared with the placebo group was lost at 24 months, 
when both estriol concentrations and PASAT scores had 
decreased. Indeed, we detected correlations between 
PASAT improvement and cortical grey matter sparing in 
all participants and in the estriol group, but not in the 
placebo group.
By contrast, patients in the estriol group with enhancing 
lesions had more white matter atrophy compared with 
those in the placebo group at both 12 months and 
24 
months, 
consistent 
with 
pseudoatrophy.40 
A 
pseudoatrophy or anti-infl
 ammatory eff
 ect in white 
matter in the estriol group would be consistent with the 
reduction in relapse rates. Whether maintenance of 
higher estriol concentrations at 24 months in all 
participants in the estriol group could have resulted in 
more robust eff
 ects on relapses or enhancing lesions is 
unknown. Achieving large reductions in these outcomes 
at 24 months compared with 12 months was challenging 
given: (1) the low level of relapse activity in this 
population, as shown by the few enhancing lesions at 
baseline, (2) the small sample size, and (3) the fact that 
all patients were treated with glatiramer acetate, which 
reduces relapse rates within 24 months of starting 
treatment.26 Future studies with participants with more 
actively relapsing disease, a larger sample size, or placebo 
alone as a comparator would be necessary to test the 
eff
 ect of sustained concentrations of estriol.
Limitations of our study included the small sample 
size, requiring our fi
 ndings to be tested in a larger 
phase 3 study. Although treatment with estriol was safe 
and well tolerated for 24 months, assessing the long-term 
risk of treatment with estriol will require larger, longer 
studies, as well as post-marketing experience. Our 
fi
 ndings might encourage pilot trials for other

Enhancing lesion volume and number, total T2 volume, and whole brain volume were exploratory outcomes. Because of the distribution of the data (with few patients 
having enhancing lesions), the most appropriate approach to assess enhancing lesion volume and number was to assess the proportion of patients with enhancing lesion 
activity. Whole grey matter, cortical grey matter, and white matter volumes, stratifi
 ed by patients with or without enhancing lesions at baseline, were post-hoc outcomes. 
*Data are mean diff
 erence (95% CI) except for number of enhancing lesions, which is mean of lesions number ratio (95% CI), and for proportion of patients with enhancing 
lesion on MRI, which is odds ratio (95% CI). †Negative change indicates improvement. ‡Negative change indicates worsening. §To estimate the diff
 erence of brain volume 
change between the two study groups for patients with and without enhancing lesions at baseline, we included baseline enhancing lesion number (present vs absent) in the 
model and used follow-up data for all patients; pinteraction=0·058 for white matter at 12 months.

cell-mediated autoimmune diseases that go into 
remission during pregnancy—ie, rheumatoid arthritis 
and psoriasis. However, estriol treatment should not be 
considered in primarily antibody-mediated autoimmune 
diseases such as lupus, since lupus tends to worsen 
during pregnancy.5 Whether estriol treatment could be 
used in men with multiple sclerosis is unknown. Estriol 
treatment was protective in male mice in preclinical 
studies,6 so it could also be effi
  cacious in men. However, 
because estriol treatment in men does not have the 
history of widespread use that treatment in women has, 
early phase safety studies are needed before its effi
  cacy in 
men with multiple sclerosis can be addressed. Although 
menstrual eff
 ects would not be an issue in men, breast 
enlargement or possibly other unexpected adverse events 
could occur.
In view of the current practice of aggressive treatment 
of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis to reduce 
disease activity as soon as possible after diagnosis,41 a 
phase 3 trial of estriol in combination with glatiramer 
acetate is warranted. In addition, further studies are 
needed to investigate estriol for progressive multiple 
sclerosis given the neuroprotective eff
 ects of oestrogens,6 
and our promising exploratory fi
 ndings of sparing grey 
matter atrophy and improving cognition. Finally, because 
estriol is a simple biological molecule, it would be less 
expensive than many treatments42 and more accessible to 
economically disadvantaged patients throughout the 
world.
