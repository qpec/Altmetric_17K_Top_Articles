ABSTRACT
Objective To systematically review the literature to 
identify risk factors for calf strain injury, and to direct 
future research into calf muscle injuries.
Design Systematic review
Data sources Database searches conducted 
for Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED, AUSPORT, 
SportDiscus, PEDro and Cochrane Library. Manual 
reference checks, ahead of press searches, citation 
tracking. From inception to June 2016.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies 
evaluating and presenting data related to intrinsic or 
extrinsic risk factors for sustaining future calf injury.
Results Ten studies were obtained for review. Subjects 
across football, Australian football, rugby union, 
basketball and triathlon were reported on, representing 
5397 athletes and 518 calf/ lower leg muscle injuries. 
Best evidence synthesis highlights chronological age 
and previous history of calf strain are the strongest risk 
factors for future calf muscle injury. Previous lower limb 
injuries (hamstring, quadriceps, adductor, knee) show 
some limited evidence for an association. Numerous 
factors lack evidence of an association, including height, 
weight, gender and side dominance.
Summary/conclusion Increasing age and previous calf 
strain injury are the most predictive of future calf injury. 
The overall paucity of evidence and the trend for studies 
of a high risk of bias show that further research needs to 
be undertaken.
InTRODuCTIOn
The lower leg is an essential biomechanical compo-
nent during movements requiring both explosive 
power and prolonged endurance.1 2 The calf 
complex is critical during any weight-bearing or 
locomotive activity and therefore injury impacts 
on a number of athletic populations.3–5 Calf muscle 
strain injuries (CMSI) are common across sports 
involving high-speed running or high volumes 
of running load, acceleration and deceleration, 
and upon fatiguing conditions of play or perfor-
mance.6–8
Football codes are significantly impacted by 
CMSI, with football showing match-play inci-
dences of 0.84 per 1000 
hours,9 rugby union risk 
ratios (RR) ranging from 0.98 to 5.85 across posi-
tions10 and CSMI representing one of the highest 
soft tissue injury incidences (3.0 per club per 
season) and recurrences (16%) in Australian Rules 
football.11 Calf injuries have a high mean time to 
return to sport in the event of any recurrence9 and 
are more likely to occur during critical competitive 
periods, such as the end of the competition season 
in football.12 Injuries to the lower leg/calf are one 
of the most prevalent muscle injuries in athletes 
involved in pole vault,3 in preprofessional dancers4 
and in triathletes.13 The prevalence of gradual onset 
calf injury is an issue in sports such as tennis, with a 
prevalence of 5.2% in collegiate standard players.5
In the literature to date, there is an absence of 
definitive data relating to risk factors for CMSI. 
Some suggested factors based on existing studies 
and anecdotal opinions relate to player intrinsic 
characteristics such as age,6 fatigue or training 
volumes7 14 and previous soft tissue injuries.6 8 The 
identification of risk factors for injury may assist 
in the assessment and management of athletes and 
injury prevention. This systematic review aims to 
synthesise variables influencing risk of future calf 
strain injuries in sport, with a secondary aim to 
direct future research into this important area.
METhODS
Search strategy and selection of studies
A systematic literature search was conducted across 
databases Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED, 
AUSPORT, SportDiscus, PEDro and the Cochrane 
Library, from inception to June 2016.
Keywords from the research question were 
mapped to medical subject headings where 
possible. Citation tracking and reference list scan-
ning of included articles and manual ahead-of-press 
searches were carried out subsequently. Refer-
ences acquired were imported into EndNote X3 
software (Thomson Reuters, USA) and duplicates 
were removed. T
wo examiners (BG and TP) inde-
pendently applied selection criteria to abstract and 
titles of the search yield, subsequently reaching 
agreement on full-text versions to be obtained for 
potential inclusion. Selection criteria were reap-
plied against full-text versions by both examiners 
in consultation. See Supplementary Material for an 
example search strategy.
Study selection criteria
Participants/Injury
Articles were included if examining either a primary 
or recurrence of a CMSI in humans in sport or 
sports-related activity. These injuries were distin-
guished from Achilles tendon-type pathologies, 
traumatic bony or contusion-type soft tissue inju-
ries, or overuse conditions where possible. Included 
studies had to present discrete data for calf or lower 
leg muscle injury.
Risk factors
Included studies were required to examine one or 
more variables in association with risk of CMSI. 
Only risk factors measured prospectively were

Review
acceptable, unless retrospective analysis evaluated non-modifi-
able risk factors. This was to avoid the limitations of retrospective 
analysis for identifying whether measured relationships were the 
result of, or predisposed to, the recorded injury. Data relating 
only to match-play versus training injury incidences were also 
considered irrelevant to the aims of the review.
Study type
Epidemiological or descriptive studies reporting incidences only, 
intervention studies, non-systematic reviews, case studies and 
opinion articles were not included. Studies were required to be 
available in full text, from peer-reviewed sources and written in 
the English language. Unpublished data and conference abstracts 
were not included because of the lack of rigorous methodological 
appraisal.
DATA COllECTIOn AnD AnAlySIS
Data extraction
Data extraction was undertaken with a focus on sports activity, 
participant characteristics, specific extrinsic or intrinsic risk factors 
examined and CMSI injury outcomes. Methods of analysis were 
also examined in terms of injury diagnosis, study durations, overall 
results (including statistical techniques used and their specific find-
ings) and general heterogeneity between variables measured in 
different studies. Non-blinded reviewers (BG and TP) extracted 
data independently, including means, SD, HR, RR and OR. Other 
variables extracted from included studies related to match or 
activity characteristics.
Data analysis, risk of bias assessment and best evidence 
synthesis
Because of the small number of studies available, and heteroge-
neity of data sets and variables measured, meta-analyses were not 
performed. Instead, a qualitative synthesis of results was primarily 
undertaken, with any probability and risk data (HR, OR and RR) 
presented in the results of this review taken directly from included 
studies. Paucity of data did not permit meta-analysis or further 
computation of other statistical relationships.
A risk of bias assessment was carried out by two independent 
reviewers (BG and TP) using a modified version of the Quality in 
Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool, as previously outlined15 16 and also 
conducted in a recent muscle-related systematic review of the litera-
ture.17 Six subheadings were used to appraise different study design 
elements and potential sources of bias, with a number of criteria 
within each category, each scoring a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ A subheading 
was considered to have high risk of bias if less than 75% of the 
items within it achieved a score of ‘yes.’ The subheading was other-
wise considered to have a low risk of bias if more than 75% of the 
criteria received a score of ‘yes.’ The overall risk of bias for a study 
was then calculated according to how many of the six subhead-
ings were deemed to be high risk, which has been advocated for 
in the literature previously.18 A study was considered to be of low 
overall risk of bias if at least five of the six categories were satis-
fied, along with requiring a low risk for the subheading relating 
to outcome measurement (item 4). All discrepancies in results of 
risk of bias assessment between independent reviewers (BG and TP) 
were compared and discussed until full agreement was reached. A 
copy of the modified QUIPS can be found in online supplementary 
appendix 1.
A best evidence synthesis was then undertaken since many of the 
studies presented heterogeneous study design, statistical methods or 
overall quality. This combined approach enables clarification of the 
strength of evidence around a particular measured variable.19 A best 
evidence synthesis has been described in the literature previously,19 
20 and employed in muscle-related systematic reviews to qualita-
tively analyse according to five hierarchical criteria aligned to study 
quality and clinical results presented17 21:
1. Strong evidence: consistent findings in more than one high-
quality study.

2. Moderate evidence: consistent findings in one high-quality 
study and one or multiple low-quality studies, or by consistent 
findings in multiple low-quality studies.
3. Limited evidence: findings presented from a single study 
only (high-quality or low-quality study).
4. Conflicting evidence: findings across more than one study 
that does not have consistent results.
5. No evidence: no randomised controlled trials or non-
randomised controlled trials available for assessment.
RESulTS
Search results
The initial search yielded a total of 1188 studies after removal of 
duplicates. Application of selection criteria to titles and abstracts 
of the initial yield resulted in full-text versions of 47 studies 
being acquired for further analysis. Application of criteria to 
full-text articles left eight studies remaining to be included. Cita-
tion tracking, ahead-of-press searches and reference scanning 
resulted in another potential 10 articles, of which two met the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (figure 1). Reasons for exclusion 
are included in online supplementary appendix 2.
Description of the included studies
A total of 10 studies were included for the purposes of this 
systematic review, accounting for a total participant pool of 
more than 5000 participants across football,7 8 14 22 23 Australian 
Rules football,6 rugby union,10 24 basketball25 and triathlon.13 
Data extraction was performed on all of the 10 included studies. 
A detailed description of the study characteristics is presented 
in table 1.
Risk of bias assessment and best evidence synthesis
Seven studies7 10 13 14 22 24 25 were scored with a high risk of bias, 
while the other remaining three studies6 8 23 were determined to 
have a low risk of bias (table 2). Authors retained agreement on 
all scoring and bias assessment results.
Key areas of bias across the 10 included studies were related 
to study attrition, study confounding variables and measurement 
of prognostic factors. All studies presented simple univariate 
statistical methods, while four offered some relevant informa-
tion from multivariate models.6 8 23 25 For full details of the best 
evidence synthesis, see table 3 below.
Evaluation of risk factors
Chronological age
Strong evidence exists for an association between increased age 
and future calf strain, measured in Australian football and foot-
ball athletes6 8 (table 3). T
wo large prospective studies with low 
risk of bias found significant associations across both univariate 
and multivariate analyses.6 8

Review
Individual player characteristics
Moderate evidence was found for no association between limb 
dominance and calf muscle or lower leg muscle injury, across 
one high risk and one low risk of bias study.8 22 Limited evidence 
for no association between player stature and future CMSI 
was highlighted in a single study with low risk of bias, while 
strong evidence of no relationship was presented across a pair of 
low risk of bias studies reporting on player mass.6 8 There may 
however be a limited association in terms of the specific measure 
of body mass index (BMI) and calf strain risk.6 Player height and 
gender showed limited evidence for no association in low-risk 
and high-risk studies, respectively6 25 (table 3).
Match characteristics, fatigue and playing schedule
The precompetition or preseason period showed limited evidence 
for higher risk of calf injury compared with other phases of the 
season, examined in a single high risk of bias study.24 During the 
competitive season, a pair of high risk of bias studies together 
provides moderate evidence for no association between periods 
of greater playing schedule congestion or less between-match 
recovery and sustaining a CMSI.7 14 Examining playing standard 
or competition level offered only limited findings of no asso-
ciation in a single high-risk study.25 The actual position played 
by the athletes in rugby and football codes provides conflicting 
evidence of no relationship8 10 (table 3).

What this study adds?
 
► Despite a limited number of studies available, data analysis 
provides evidence for age and previous CMSI as the 
strongest risk factors for calf strain injury.
 
► Previous adductor, hamstring, quadriceps or knee injury may 
also influence likelihood of injury.
 
► Variables relating to individual player characteristics and 
environmental descriptors do not seem to be related to 
future calf or lower leg strain.
 
► This review highlights the factors that need further study 
in the scientific literature, with future direction of research 
similar to that undertaken recently in the field of hamstrings.
Review
were presented using univariate and multivariate approaches, 
with one study further dichotomising data to highlight an 
elevated risk for future calf strain if a calf muscle injury had been 
experienced in the preceding 8-week period (RR=8.94, 95% 
CI 
5.1 to 15.66).6
History of other previous lower limb injury
Four studies presented data relating to other previous injury and 
future calf or lower leg injury in triathletes, football and Austra-
lian Rules athletes6 8 13 23 (table 3).
Across a number of low risk of bias studies, some limited 
evidence exists for an association between previous adductor, 
previous hamstring, previous quadriceps, and previous knee 
injury and future CMSI.6 8 23 Previous ‘lower leg, knee, thigh, 
ankle/foot and back’ injury in the preceding 12-month period 
was identified by a single high risk of bias study and classified as 
having a limited association.13
Other extrinsic variables
There was limited evidence for no association between tempera-
ture, evaporation in the previous week, game-day rainfall, rainfall 
in the previous week and month of the year with sustaining a calf 
or lower leg muscle injury.6
DISCuSSIOn
This review established that the strongest risk factors for CMSI 
are increased player age and any history of previous CMSI. There 
may also be limited evidence that other lower limb soft tissue or 
joint injuries (hamstring, quadriceps, adductor, knee) predispose 
athletes to calf or lower leg muscle injuries, along with being in 
the preseason period or the player having an increased BMI.
This review also identified a number of factors showing 
no association with future calf strain. Strong evidence for no 
association was found for absolute player mass, along with 
moderate evidence for no relationship with reduced between-
match recovery or schedule congestion. A number of individual 
player characteristics (height, stature, side dominance, gender) 
and playing standard further failed to highlight an association, as 
did any environmental factor examined. There seems to be some 
conflicting evidence regarding positional demands in football 
and rugby codes, across multiple studies of both low  and high 
risks of bias. Overall, the small number of studies and variables 
available for synthesis together with the lack of homogeneity 
in data presented and methodological approaches to outcome 
measurement limits the conclusions that can be drawn. In addi-
tion, the quality of the included studies was variable. Risk of 
bias assessment showed that there were clear discrepancies in 
terms of overall study quality, which influenced the strength and 
number of definitive findings when synthesising the evidence.
Confirmation of chronological age and previous muscle injury 
as strong risk factors for future muscle strain is not surprising 
given these non-modifiable risk factors have been implicated in 
risk for hamstring,26 groin8 27 and quadriceps6 strain injuries. 
Increasing age as a risk factor also bears relevance to previous 
literature detailing age-related neuromuscular maladaptations 
and loss in skeletal muscle tissue quality and function.28 29 Age-re-
lated structural tissue changes are linked with progressive loss 
of important neuromuscular attributes such as power outputs 
or rate of force development,29 and disruptions to motor unit 
discharge rates.30 In the event of previous injury, maladaptive 
responses have been tracked following hamstring31–33 and ACL34 
35 injuries, affecting factors relating to strength,31–35 neurology31 
32 34 and tissue architecture.32 33 35
Local structural tissue alterations are an important maladapta-
tion to consider, particularly given their association with tendon 
continuum presentations in the Achilles.36 37 Literature has 
previously established the importance of gastrocnemius fascicle 
length in sprinting athletes, and therefore maximal power 
outputs over fast velocities,1 with both a strong and statistically 
significant correlation with maximal sprinting speed.1 2 This 
may also highlight the importance of tissue extensibility or flexi-
bility, of which long fascicular lengths are a purported requisite, 
despite no direct evidence exploring its role in calf strain injury 
risk. More recent studies into the hamstring strain injuries have 
underlined this structural necessity in the hamstring complex.38 
The presence of shorter fascicle lengths in the biceps femoris 
below a certain threshold resulted in significantly elevated risk 
for future hamstring muscle strains.38 Local factors relating to 
calf muscle fascicle length, pennation angle, cross-sectional area 
and tissue quality may therefore be worthwhile when evaluating 
risk of injury compared with more global and less specific vari-
ables such as stature, height and weight.
These areas provide some direction for future calf research, 
along with recent studies that have presented significant associ-
ations between measures of different strength qualities and soft 
tissue injury—namely eccentric strength39 and strength endur-
ance40 for sustaining future hamstring muscle strains. Related 
works have also identified an important association between 
greater levels of eccentric strength and increasing fascicle lengths 
as able to ameliorate risk of non-modifiable risk factors of age 
and previous injury history,38 which is particularly relevant given 
that these were the only two risk factors with strong evidence in 
this review. Rehabilitation and conditioning practices could hope 
to mirror these findings, along with recent literature detailing the 
importance of long-term training chronicity in building athlete 
preparedness and injury resilience.41 Implementing interventions 
for eliciting adaptation to fascicle lengths and eccentric capacity 
in the calf complex however require scientific validation and 
further research.
What is already known on this topic?
 
► The calf complex is essential to lower limb mechanics during 
locomotive and weight-bearing tasks.
 
► Calf muscle strain injuries (CMSI) are a common soft tissue 
injury across numerous team and individual sporting codes.
 
► Literature in this area is limited, and a systematic analysis 
establishing a group of possible risk factors, and any inter-
relationships between these factors, has not been performed 
to date.

Review
The small number of studies and variables explored in this 
review provides some direction in the topic of CMSI. However, 
the overall paucity of homogenous data and overall study quality 
influence the quality of conclusions that can be made. There is 
also the potential for a publication bias given that only published 
literature was included for the purposes of review, and a language 
bias associated with inclusion of English-language only publica-
tions. Findings from this systematic review should be considered 
with understanding that there are limitations in both the quality 
of evidence and the amount of evidence available. Clinical inter-
pretation of findings should consider that there are potentially 
other influences on risk for future CMSI than are mentioned or 
examined in detail in this systematic review.
COnCluSIOn
History of a previous calf muscle strain and increasing player age 
provide the strongest evidence for future calf strain risk. Factors 
such as player weight, height, gender and side dominance can 
be considered to lack evidence of an association with sustaining 
a calf muscle injury. A number of other measures and variables 
may also have an influence on risk; however, additional research 
is required to build the evidence base in this area, and to offer 
some further understanding of risk.
