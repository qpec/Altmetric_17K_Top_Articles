Abstract
Background—Studies have shown that long-term exposure to air pollution increases mortality. 
However, evidence is limited for air-pollution levels below the most recent National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards. Previous studies involved predominantly urban populations and did not have 
the statistical power to estimate the health effects in underrepresented groups.
Methods—We constructed an open cohort of all Medicare beneficiaries (60,925,443 persons) in 
the continental United States from the years 2000 through 2012, with 460,310,521 person-years of 
follow-up. Annual averages of fine particulate matter (particles with a mass median aerodynamic 
diameter of less than 2.5 μm [PM2.5]) and ozone were estimated according to the ZIP Code of 
residence for each enrollee with the use of previously validated prediction models. We estimated 
the risk of death associated with exposure to increases of 10 μg per cubic meter for PM2.5 and 10 
parts per billion (ppb) for ozone using a two-pollutant Cox proportional-hazards model that 
controlled for demographic characteristics, Medicaid eligibility, and area-level covariates.
Results—Increases of 10 μg per cubic meter in PM2.5 and of 10 ppb in ozone were associated 
with increases in all-cause mortality of 7.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.1 to 7.5) and 1.1% 
(95% CI, 1.0 to 1.2), respectively. When the analysis was restricted to person-years with exposure 
to PM2.5 of less than 12 μg per cubic meter and ozone of less than 50 ppb, the same increases in 
PM2.5 and ozone were associated with increases in the risk of death of 13.6% (95% CI, 13.1 to 
14.1) and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.1), respectively. For PM2.5, the risk of death among men, blacks, 
and people with Medicaid eligibility was higher than that in the rest of the population.
Conclusions—In the entire Medicare population, there was significant evidence of adverse 
effects related to exposure to PM2.5 and ozone at concentrations below current national standards. 
This effect was most pronounced among self-identified racial minorities and people with low 
income. (Supported by the Health Effects Institute and others.)

 The adverse health effects associated with long-term exposure to air pollution are well 
documented.1,2 Studies suggest that fine particles (particles with a mass median 
aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm [PM2.5]) are a public health concern,3 with 
exposure linked to decreased life expectancy.4-6 Long-term exposure to ozone has also been 
associated with reduced survival in several recent studies, although evidence is sparse.4,7-9
Studies with large cohorts have investigated the relationship between long-term exposures to 
PM2.5 and ozone and mortality4,9-13; others have estimated the health effects of fine particles 
at low concentrations (e.g., below 12 μg per cubic meter for PM2.5).14-18 However, most of 
these studies have included populations whose socioeconomic status is higher than the 
national average and who reside in well-monitored urban areas. Consequently, these studies 
provide limited information on the health effects of long-term exposure to low levels of air 
pollution in smaller cities and rural areas or among minorities or persons with low 
socioeconomic status.
To address these gaps in knowledge, we conducted a nationwide cohort study involving all 
Medicare beneficiaries from 2000 through 2012, a population of 61 million, with 460 
million person-years of follow-up. We used a survival analysis to estimate the risk of death 
from any cause associated with long-term exposure (yearly average) to PM2.5 concentrations 
lower than the current annual National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 12 μg per 
cubic meter and to ozone concentrations below 50 parts per billion (ppb). Subgroup analyses 
were conducted to identify populations with a higher or lower level of pollution-associated 
risk of death from any cause.
Methods
Mortality Data
We obtained the Medicare beneficiary denominator file from the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, which contains information on all persons in the United States covered 
by Medicare and more than 96% of the population 65 years of age or older. We constructed 
an open cohort consisting of all beneficiaries in this age group in the continental United 
States from 2000 through 2012, with all-cause mortality as the outcome. For each 
beneficiary, we extracted the date of death (up to December 31, 2012), age at year of 
Medicare entry, year of entry, sex, race, ZIP Code of residence, and Medicaid eligibility (a 
proxy for low socioeconomic status). Persons who were alive on January 1 of the year 
following their enrollment in Medicare were entered into the open cohort for the survival 
analysis. Follow-up periods were defined according to calendar years.
Assessment of Exposure to Air Pollution
Ambient levels of ozone and PM2.5 were estimated and validated on the basis of previously 
published prediction models.19,20 Briefly, we used an artificial neural network that 
incorporated satellite-based measurements, simulation outputs from a chemical transport 
model, land-use terms, meteorologic data, and other data to predict daily concentrations of 
PM2.5 and ozone at unmonitored locations. We fit the neural network with monitoring data 
from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) (in which there

 are 1928 monitoring stations for PM2.5 and 1877 monitoring stations for ozone). We then 
predicted daily PM2.5 and ozone concentrations for nationwide grids that were 1 km by 1 
km. Cross-validation indicated that predictions were good across the entire study area. The 
coefficients of determination (R2) for PM2.5 and ozone were 0.83 and 0.80, respectively; the 
mean square errors between the target and forecasting values for PM2.5 and ozone were 1.29 
μg per cubic meter and 2.91 ppb, respectively. Data on daily air temperature and relative 
humidity were retrieved from North American Regional Reanalysis with grids that were 
approximately 32 km by 32 km; data were averaged annually.21
For each calendar year during which a person was at risk of death, we assigned to that 
person a value for the annual average PM2.5 concentration, a value for average ozone level 
during the warm season (April 1 through September 30), and values for annual average 
temperature and humidity according to the ZIP Code of the person's residence. The warm-
season ozone concentration was used to compare our results with those of previous 
studies.10 In this study, “ozone concentration” refers to the average concentration during the 
warm season, unless specified otherwise.
As part of a sensitivity analysis, we also obtained data on PM2.5 and ozone concentrations 
from the EPA AQS and matched that data with each person in our study on the basis of the 
nearest monitoring site within a distance of 50 km. (Details are provided in Section 1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)
Statistical Analysis
We fit a two-pollutant Cox proportional-hazards model with a generalized estimating 
equation to account for the correlation between ZIP Codes.22 In this way, the risk of death 
from any cause associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5 was always adjusted for long-
term exposure to ozone, and the risk of death from any cause associated with long-term 
exposure to ozone was always adjusted for long-term exposure to PM2.5, unless noted 
otherwise. We also conducted single-pollutant analyses for comparability. We allowed 
baseline mortality rates to differ according to sex, race, Medicaid eligibility, and 5-year 
categories of age at study entry. To adjust for potential confounding, we also obtained 15 
ZIP-Code or county-level variables from various sources and a regional dummy variable to 
account for compositional differences in PM2.5 across the United States (Table 1, and 
Section 1 in the Supplementary Appendix). We conducted this same statistical analysis but 
restricted it to person-years with PM2.5 exposures lower than 12 μg per cubic meter and 
ozone exposures lower than 50 ppb (low-exposure analysis) (Table 1, and Section 1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
To identify populations at a higher or lower pollution-associated risk of death from any 
cause, we refit the same two-pollutant Cox model for some subgroups (e.g., male vs. female, 
white vs. black, and Medicaid eligible vs. Medicaid ineligible). To estimate the 
concentration-response function of air pollution and mortality, we fit a log-linear model with 
a thin-plate spline of both PM2.5 and ozone and controlled for all the individual and ecologic 
variables used in our main analysis model (Section 7 in the Supplementary Appendix). To 
examine the robustness of our results, we conducted sensitivity analyses and compared the 
extent to which estimates of risk changed with respect to differences in confounding

 adjustment and estimation approaches (Sections S2 through S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Data on some important individual-level co-variates were not available for the Medicare 
cohort, including data on smoking status, body-mass index (BMI), and income. We obtained 
data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a representative subsample of 
Medicare enrollees (133,964 records and 57,154 enrollees for the period 2000 through 
2012), with individual-level data on smoking, BMI, income, and many other variables 
collected by means of telephone survey. Using MCBS data, we investigated how the lack of 
adjustment for these risk factors could have affected our calculated risk estimates in the 
Medicare cohort (Section 5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The computations in this 
article were run on the Odyssey cluster, which is supported by the FAS Division of Science, 
Research Computing Group, and on the Research Computing Environment, which is 
supported by the Institute for Quantitative Social Science in the Faculty of Arts and 
Sciences, both at Harvard University. We used R software, version 3.3.2 (R Project for 
Statistical Computing), and SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Cohort Analyses
The full cohort included 60,925,443 persons living in 39,716 different ZIP Codes with 
460,310,521 person-years of follow-up. The median follow-up was 7 years. The total 
number of deaths was 22,567,924. There were 11,908,888 deaths and 247,682,367 person-
years of follow-up when the PM2.5 concentration was below 12 μg per cubic meter and 
17,470,128 deaths and 353,831,836 person-years of follow-up when the ozone concentration 
was below 50 ppb. These data provided excellent power to estimate the risk of death at air-
pollution levels below the current annual NAAQS for PM2.5 and at low concentrations for 
ozone (Table 1).
Annual average PM2.5 concentrations across the continental United States during the study 
period ranged from 6.21 to 15.64 μg per cubic meter (5th and 95th percentiles, respectively), 
and the warm-season average ozone concentrations ranged from 36.27 to 55.86 ppb (5th and 
95th percentiles, respectively). The highest PM2.5 concentrations were in California and the 
eastern and southeastern United States. The Mountain region and California had the highest 
ozone concentrations; the eastern states had lower ozone concentrations (Fig. 1).
In a two-pollutant analysis, each increase of 10 μg per cubic meter in annual exposure to 
PM2.5 (estimated independently of ozone) and each increase of 10 ppb in warm-season 
exposure to ozone (estimated independently of PM2.5) was associated with an increase in 
all-cause mortality of 7.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.1 to 7.5) and 1.1% (95% CI, 1.0 
to 1.2), respectively. Estimates of risk based on predictive, ZIP-Code–specific assessments 
of exposure were slightly higher than those provided by the nearest data-monitoring site 
(Table 2). When we restricted the PM2.5 and ozone analyses to location-years with low 
concentrations, we continued to see significant associations between exposure and mortality 
(Table 2). Analysis of the MCBS subsample provided strong evidence that smoking and

 income are not likely to be confounders because they do not have a significant association 
with PM2.5 or ozone (Section 5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses revealed that men; black, Asian, and Hispanic persons; and persons who 
were eligible for Medicaid (i.e., those who had low socioeconomic status) had a higher 
estimated risk of death from any cause in association with PM2.5 exposure than the general 
population. The risk of death associated with ozone exposure was higher among white, 
Medicaid-eligible persons and was significantly below 1 in some racial subgroups (Fig. 2). 
Among black persons, the effect estimate for PM2.5 was three times as high as that for the 
overall population (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Overall, the risk of death 
associated with ozone exposure was smaller and somewhat less robust than that associated 
with PM2.5 exposure. We also detected a small but significant interaction between ozone 
exposure and PM2.5 exposure (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). Our thin-plate–
spline fit indicated a relationship between PM2.5, ozone, and all-cause mortality that was 
almost linear, with no signal of threshold down to 5 μg per cubic meter and 30 ppb, 
respectively (Fig. 3, and Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
This study involving an open cohort of all persons receiving Medicare, including those from 
small cities and rural areas, showed that long-term exposures to PM2.5 and ozone were 
associated with an increased risk of death, even at levels below the current annual NAAQS 
for PM2.5. Furthermore, the study showed that black men and persons eligible to receive 
Medicaid had a much higher risk of death associated with exposure to air pollution than 
other subgroups. These findings suggest that lowering the annual NAAQS may produce 
important public health benefits overall, especially among self-identified racial minorities 
and people with low income.
The strengths of this study include the assessment of exposure with high spatial and 
temporal resolution, the use of a cohort of almost 61 million Medicare beneficiaries across 
the entire continental United States followed for up to 13 consecutive years, and the ability 
to perform subgroup analyses of the health effects of air pollution on groups of 
disadvantaged persons. However, Medicare claims do not include extensive individual-level 
data on behavioral risk factors, such as smoking and income, which could be important 
confounders. Still, our analysis of the MCBS subsample (Table S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix) increased our level of confidence that the inability to adjust for these individual-
level risk factors in the Medicare cohort did not lead to biased results (Section 5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). In another study, we analyzed a similar Medicare subsample 
with detailed individual-level data on smoking, BMI, and many other potential confounders 
linked to Medicare claims.23 In that analysis, we found that for mortality and hospitalization, 
the risks of exposure to PM2.5 were not sensitive to the additional control of individual-level 
variables that were not available in the whole Medicare population. We also found that our 
results were robust when we excluded individual and ecologic co-variates from the main 
analysis (Fig. S2 and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), when we stratified age at

 entry into 3-year and 4-year categories rather than the 5 years used in the main analysis (Fig. 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix), when we varied the estimation procedure (by means of 
a generalized estimating equation as opposed to mixed effects) (Tables S3 and S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix), and when we used different types of statistical software (R, 
version 3.3.2, vs. SAS, version 9.4). Finally, we found that our results were consistent with 
others published in the literature (Section 6 in the Supplementary Appendix).5,17,24-28
There was a significant association between PM2.5 exposure and mortality when the analysis 
was restricted to concentrations below 12 μg per cubic meter, with a steeper slope below that 
level. This association indicated that the health-benefit-per-unit decrease in the concentration 
of PM2.5 is larger for PM2.5 concentrations that are below the current annual NAAQS than 
the health benefit of decreases in PM2.5 concentrations that are above that level. Similar, 
steeper concentration-response curves at low concentrations have been observed in previous 
studies.29 Moreover, we found no evidence of a threshold value — the concentration at 
which PM2.5 exposure does not affect mortality — at concentrations as low as 
approximately 5 μg per cubic meter (Fig. 3); this finding is similar to those of other 
studies.18,30
The current ozone standard for daily exposure is 70 ppb; there is no annual or seasonal 
standard. Our results strengthen the argument for establishing seasonal or annual standards. 
Moreover, whereas time-series studies have shown the short-term effects of ozone exposure, 
our results indicate that there are larger effect sizes for longer-term ozone exposure, 
including in locations where ozone concentrations never exceed 70 ppb. Unlike the 
American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II,9,10 our study reported a linear 
connection between ozone concentration and mortality. This finding is probably the result of 
the interaction between PM2.5 and ozone (Section 7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
significant, linear relationship between seasonal ozone levels and all-cause mortality 
indicates that current risk assessments,31-33 which incorporate only the acute effects of 
ozone exposure on deaths each day from respiratory mortality, may be substantially 
underestimating the contribution of ozone exposure to the total burden of disease.
The enormous sample size in this study, which includes the entire Medicare cohort, allowed 
for unprecedented accuracy in the estimation of risks among racial minorities and 
disadvantaged subgroups. The estimate of effect size for PM2.5 exposure was greatest among 
male, black, and Medicaid-eligible persons. We also estimated risks in subgroups of persons 
who were eligible for Medicaid and in whites and blacks alone to ascertain whether the 
effect modifications according to race and Medicaid status were independent. We found that 
black persons who were not eligible for Medicaid (e.g., because of higher income) continued 
to have an increased risk of death from exposure to PM2.5 (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In addition, we found that there was a difference in the health effects of PM2.5 
exposure between urban and rural populations, a finding that may be due to compositional 
differences in the particulates (Table S3 Supplementary Appendix).
Although the Medicare cohort includes only the population of persons 65 years of age or 
older, two thirds of all deaths in the United States occur in people in that age group. 
Although our exposure models had excellent out-of-sample predictive power on held-out

 monitors, they do have limitations. Error in exposure assessment remains an issue in this 
type of analysis and could attenuate effect estimates for air pollution.34
The overall association between air pollution and human health has been well documented 
since the publication of the landmark Harvard Six Cities Study in 1993.25 With air pollution 
declining, it is critical to estimate the health effects of low levels of air pollution — below 
the current NAAQS — to determine whether these levels are adequate to minimize the risk 
of death. Since the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set air-quality standards that protect 
sensitive populations, it is also important to focus more effort on estimating effect sizes in 
potentially sensitive populations in order to inform regulatory policy going forward.

 Figure 1. Average PM2.5 and Ozone Concentrations in the Continental United States, 2000 
through 2012
Panel A shows the average concentrations of fine particulate matter (particles with a mass 
median aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 μm [PM2.5]) in micrograms per cubic meter, 
as estimated on the basis of all daily predictions during the study period. Panel B shows the 
concentration of ozone levels in parts per billion as averaged from April 1 through 
September 30 throughout the study period.

 Figure 2. Risk of Death Associated with an Increase of 10 μg per Cubic Meter in PM2.5 
Concentrations and an Increase of 10 ppb in Ozone Exposure, According to Study Subgroups
Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals are shown for an increase of 10 μg per cubic 
meter in PM2.5 and an increase of 10 parts per billion (ppb) in ozone. Subgroup analyses 
were conducted by first restricting the population (e.g., considering only male enrollees). 
The same two-pollutant analysis (the main analysis) was then applied to each subgroup. 
Numeric results are presented in Tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. Dashed 
lines indicate the estimated hazard ratio for the overall population.

 Figure 3. Concentration–Response Function of the Joint Effects of Exposure to PM2.5 and Ozone 
on All-Cause Mortality
A log-linear model with a thin-plate spline was fit for both PM2.5 and ozone, and the shape 
of the concentration-response surface was estimated (Fig. S8 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The concentration–response curve in Panel A was plotted for an ozone 
concentration equal to 45 ppb. The concentration–response curve in Panel B was plotted for 
a PM2.5 concentration equal to 10 μg per cubic meter. These estimated curves were plotted at 
the 5th and 95th percentiles of the concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone, respectively. The 
complete concentration–response three-dimensional surface is plotted in Fig. S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.

*Summary statistics were calculated separately for persons residing in ZIP Codes where average ozone levels were below or above 50 ppb and where PM2.5 levels were below or above 12 μg per cubic 
meter. The value 12 μg per cubic meter was chosen as the current annual National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) (e.g., the “safe” level) for PM2.5. BMI denotes body-mass index (the weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) and ppb parts per billion.
†The number for total person-years of follow-up indicates the sum of individual units of time that the persons in the study population were at risk of death from 2000 through 2012.
‡The average values for air pollution levels and for ecologic and meteorologic variables were computed by averaging values over all ZIP Codes from 2000 through 2012.
§Data on race and ethnic group were obtained from Medicare beneficiary files.
¶The variable for ambulatory visits refers to the average annual percentage of Medicare enrollees who had at least one ambulatory visit to a primary care physician.

*Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated on the basis of an increase of 10 μg per cubic meter in exposure to PM2.5 and an 
increase of 10 ppb in exposure to ozone.
†Daily average monitoring data on PM2.5 and ozone were obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System. Daily ozone 
concentrations were averaged from April 1 through September 30 for the computation of warm-season averages. Data on PM2.5 and ozone levels 
were obtained from the nearest monitoring site within 50 km. If there was more than one monitoring site within 50 km, the nearest site was chosen. 
Persons who lived more than 50 km from a monitoring site were excluded.
‡For the single-pollutant analysis, model specifications were the same as those used in the main analysis, except that ozone was not included in the 
model when the main effect of PM2.5 was estimated and PM2.5 was not included in the model when the main effect of ozone was estimated.
