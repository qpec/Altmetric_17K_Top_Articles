IMPORTANCE The optimal blood pressure (BP) target remains debated in nondiabetic
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
OBJECTIVE To compare intensive BP control (<130/80 mm Hg) with standard BP control
(<140/90 mm Hg) on major renal outcomes in patients with CKD without diabetes.
DATA SOURCES Searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library for
publications up to March 24, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials that compared an intensive vs a standard BP
target in nondiabetic adults with CKD, reporting changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR),
doubling of serum creatinine level, 50% reduction in GFR, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or
all-cause mortality.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Random-effects meta-analyses for pooling effect
measures. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses for exploring heterogeneity.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Differences in annual rate of change in GFR were expressed
as mean differences with 95% CIs. Differences in doubling of serum creatinine or 50%
reduction in GFR, ESRD, composite renal outcome, and all-cause mortality were expressed as
risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs.
RESULTS We identified 9 trials with 8127 patients and a median follow-up of 3.3 years.
Compared with standard BP control, intensive BP control did not show a significant
difference on the annual rate of change in GFR (mean difference, 0.07; 95% CI, −0.16 to 0.29
mL/min/1.73 m2/y), doubling of serum creatinine level or 50% reduction in GFR (RR, 0.99;
95% CI, 0.76-1.29), ESRD (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.78-1.18), composite renal outcome (RR, 0.99;
95% CI, 0.81-1.21), or all-cause mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64-1.02). Intensive BP control
reduced mortality (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99) in sensitivity analysis when the study
populations were strictly restricted to those without diabetes. Nonblacks and patients with
higher levels of proteinuria showed a trend of lower risk of kidney disease progression with
intensive BP control.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Targeting BP below the current standard did not provide
additional benefit for renal outcomes compared with standard treatment during a follow-up
of 3.3 years in patients with CKD without diabetes. However, nonblack patients or those with
higher levels of proteinuria might benefit from the intensive BP-lowering treatments.

hronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global epidemic, and it
leads to higher risks of dialysis, cardiovascular morbid-
ity, and mortality.1-3 The prevalence of CKD varies from
8%to16%worldwide,withnondiabeticCKDaccountsformost
of the CKD population.4-7 The development and progression of
nondiabetic CKD are closely interrelated to hypertension, and
blood pressure (BP) control is able to decrease the risk of de-
cline in renal function and cardiovascular mortality.7-11 How-
ever, the optimal BP target for preventing kidney disease pro-
gression remain debated.
Major guidelines suggest a target of BP of less than 140/90
mmHgforpatientswithnondiabeticCKD,12,13andsomesuggest
a further reduction to achieve a BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg
forthosewithproteinuria.8,14Previousrandomizedclinicaltrials
(RCTs) and systematic reviews have examined the renoprotec-
tiveeffectsofanintensiveBPcontrolinpatientswithnondiabetic
CKD but reported conflicting results.15-20 Recently, the Systolic
BloodPressureInterventionTrial(SPRINT)reportedthatinten-
siveBPcontroldidnotsignificantlyreducetheriskofdialysisor
declined renal function in nondiabetic patients with CKD, but
ratherincreasedtheriskofacutekidneyinjury.21Inthissystem-
aticreviewandmeta-analysis,wesynthesizedresultsfromRCTs
to evaluate the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on
major renal outcomes and mortality in nondiabetic adults with
CKD, and also assessed effect modification by proteinuria.
Methods
Data Sources and Literature Searches
We conducted electronic literature searches of PubMed,
MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from the earli-
est available date of indexing through March 24, 2016. We also
hand-searched the reference lists of identified publications for
additionalstudies.Thedetailedstudyprotocolandsearchstrat-
egies are provided in the eAppendix 1 in the Supplement.
Study Selection
We included RCTs comparing different BP targets in primarily
nondiabetic CKD patients older than 18 years. Included stud-
ies had to report at least 1 of the outcomes: changes in glomer-
ularfiltrationrate(GFR),doublingofserumcreatininelevel,50%
reduction in GFR, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or all-cause
mortality. Studies reporting outcomes from nondiabetic CKD
subgroups were included. Eligible studies had to be published
as full-length articles in peer-reviewed journals.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two investigators (W.-C.T. and H.-Y.W.) independently ex-
tracted relevant information from the included studies and
evaluated the methodological quality of eligible trials by using
the Cochrane Collaboration’
s tool for assessing risk of bias.22
Disagreements between the 2 investigators were resolved by
discussion.
Outcomes
Comparing the intensive BP-lowering treatment with the stan-
dard BP-lowering treatment during the in-trial follow-up pe-
riod, our outcomes of interest were the annual rate of change
in GFR, doubling of serum creatinine level, or 50% reduction
in GFR, ESRD, and all-cause mortality. We also analyzed the
composite renal outcome of the doubling of serum creatinine
level, 50% reduction in GFR, or ESRD. ESRD was defined as
the need for dialysis therapy or kidney transplantation.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Categorical variables are presented as frequencies or percent-
ages, and continuous variables are presented as mean values
unless stated otherwise. The pooled estimates of effect mea-
sures and 95% CIs of comparisons between the intensive and
standard BP-lowering treatments were calculated using both
thefixed-effectmodelandtheDerSimonianandLairdrandom-
effects model.22 The effect size of continuous outcome (an-
nual rate of change in GFR; milliliters per minutes per 1.73 m2
per year) was expressed as mean difference with 95% CI. We
used estimation and imputation methods to reconstruct the
missing values for annual rate of change in GFR as recom-
mended in the Cochrane Handbook (eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement).22 Effect sizes of binary outcomes (doubling of
serum creatinine level or 50% reduction in GFR, ESRD, com-
posite renal outcome, and all-cause mortality) were ex-
pressed as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. In consideration of
between-study variance, we used the random-effects model
as the primary analyses.23
Publication bias was examined using the funnel plot
method and Egger regression asymmetry test.24,25 Heteroge-
neity of treatment effects across studies were assessed by I2
and the Cochrane Q-test.22 Meta-regression and subgroup
analyseswereperformedtoexplorepotentialsourcesofhetero-
geneity and assess the associations between variables and
intervention effects. We conducted meta-regression using
mixed-effectsmodeltoassesstheinfluencesofmeanage,race,
mean baseline GFR, targeted systolic BP, study sample size,
or the method of GFR measurement. Subgroup analysis was
performed when a covariate was significant in the meta-
regression. Owing to the wide range, the level of proteinuria
was not suitable to be assessed as a study-level covariate in
meta-regression or subgroup analyses. To determine whether
the level of proteinuria influenced the effects of intensive BP-
loweringtreatment,weextractedavailablesubpopulationdata
from each study and pooled their results for ESRD or annual
Key Points
Question Does intensive blood pressure control provide better
renoprotection for nondiabetic chronic kidney disease?
Findings In this systematic review including 9 randomized clinical
trials with 8127 patients and a median follow-up of 3.3 years,
intensive and standard blood pressure control provided similar
effects. However, nonblack patients and those with higher levels
of proteinuria showed a trend of lower risk of kidney disease
progression with intensive blood pressure–lowering treatments.
Meaning Targeting blood pressure below the current standard is
not consistently warranted, but may benefit nonblack patients or
those with heavy proteinuria.

 rate of change in GFR. To assess the robustness of our meta-
analyses, we undertook sensitivity analyses by omitting stud-
ies with imputed missing data, or studies that did not totally
exclude diabetic patients. To compare with previous meta-
analysis,19 we also carried out a sensitivity analysis by includ-
ing the posttrial follow-up data of the Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) study26 and the African American Study
ofKidneyDiseaseandHypertension(AASK).27A2-sidedP ≤ .05

tistical Computing).
Results
The flowchart in eFigure 1 in the Supplement shows the lit-
erature search process. Of the 1158 articles retrieved initially,
328 were excluded due to duplicate publication and 816 were
excluded on the basis of titles and abstracts. Of the 14 that
underwent full-text evaluation, 10 articles met the inclusion
criteria.
Study Characteristics and Quality Assessment
There were 9 RCTs from 10 eligible articles, which enrolled a
total of 8127 participants. The clinical and methodological
characteristics of each study are summarized in Table 1 and
Table 2. The median length of in-trial follow-up was 3.3 years
(range, 1.6-7.0 years). The median age of the participants was
55 years, with men accounting for 61%. Six studies included
mostly whites; 2, mostly blacks; and 1, mostly Asians. Most of
the studies excluded all patients with diabetes. The Japanese
Trial to Assess Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure in Elderly Hy-
pertensive Patients (JATOS)30 and the MDRD15 study ex-
cluded patients with poorly controlled diabetes, and a minor
percentageoftheirstudypopulationhaddiabetes(12%and5%,
respectively). Included studies had similar baseline BP be-
tween the intensive and standard treatment groups, and the
achieved difference in mean systolic BP varied from 4 to 13 mm
Hg at the end of the trial. The risk of bias of included studies
issummarizedineFigures2and3intheSupplement.Themain
causes of potential bias were open-label design, inadequate al-
location concealment, and lack of blinding.

Adverse Events of Intensive BP Control
Three studies28-30 did not report data on adverse events, and 1
study21 did not present data on adverse events for the CKD sub-
group.The3studiesreportingtheriskofhypotensionandasso-
ciatedsymptomshadinconsistentresults.15,16,31 Thepooledes-
timatesof2studieswithatotalof1652patientsshowedthatthere

ments (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.22),16,31 but Klahr et al15
reported that events of hypotension were not significantly
different between BP-lowering strategies. Wright et al16 also
reported that there was no significant difference in syncope
between the intensive and standard BP-lowering groups
(6.3% vs 5.2%). One study31 reported that the intensive and
the standard BP-lowering groups had similar risk of acute kid-
ney injury (5.8% vs 4.6%), and 2 studies17,31 reported that
intensive BP-lowering treatments did not increase the risk of
serious adverse events.
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of nondiabetic
adults with CKD, there were no differences in renal outcomes
comparing intensive and standard BP-lowering strategies dur-
ingamedianfollow-upof3.3years.However,intensiveBPcon-
trol tended to reduce mortality, and nonblacks or patients with
higher levels of proteinuria showed a trend of lower risk of kid-
neydiseaseprogressionwithintensiveBP-loweringtreatments.
TherewasnoclearevidencethatintensiveBPcontrolincreased
theriskofadverseevents,exceptforthesymptomofdizziness.
These estimates are fairly robust and changed little in sensitiv-
ity analyses.

 kidney disease progression. Five study outcomes were ana-
lyzedtoevaluateeffectsofintensiveBP-loweringtreatments,and
allshowedsimilarresults.Wefollowedastandardprotocol,used
a comprehensive search strategy, and applied rigorous meth-
ods to assess the robustness of study results, including meta-
regression and subgroup analyses.
Results in Relation to Other Studies and Reviews
Our study results are consistent with those of previous meta-
analyses. In a systematic review of 19 RCTs with a mean follow-
up of 3.8 years, Xie et al32 reported that the intensive BP strat-
egy reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with
hypertension but not the risk for ESRD or all-cause mortality.
However, the meta-analysis by Xie et al32 included mostly pa-
tients without CKD and did not report renal outcomes for the
CKD subgroup. By including updated evidence such as the
SPRINT study,21 our main analyses revealed that intensive BP
control offered no additional benefit on the 4 renal outcomes
butatrendtoreducemortality.Thesensitivityanalysisshowed
alowermortalityinpatientstreatedwithintensiveBP-lowering
strategy when the study populations were strictly restricted to
those without diabetes.
In a meta-analysis of 5308 CKD patients, Lv et al19 reported
that intensive BP-lowering reduced the risk of a composite kid-
neyfailureoutcomeby17%andreducedtheriskofESRDby18%.
Thismeta-analysisalsodemonstratedthatintensiveBP-lowering
reducedtheriskofkidneyfailureby27%inpatientswithprotein-
uria and concluded that proteinuria is an effect modifier
(P = .006).19 The meta-analysis by Lv et al19 included posttrial
follow-up data from the MDRD33 and the AASK27 trials. Includ-
ing the posttrial cohort data in the meta-analysis increased the
numberofeventsandstatisticalpowerbutmightalsointroduce
biasesbecausepatientsmaynothaveadheredtoassignedBPtar-
gets during the posttrial follow-up period. In addition, the sys-
tematic review by Lv et al19 enrolled children and patients with
diabetes. Because the pathogenesis and clinical course in pedi-
atric patients and those with diabetic kidney disease are differ-
ent from nondiabetic adults with CKD,7,12,34-36 pooling results
mightnotclarifytheeffectsofintensiveBPcontrol.Tomaintain
thepooledevidenceinthehighestquality,weincludedonlydata
fromnondiabeticadultsduringthetrialphase,andshowedthat
theintensiveandstandardBPcontrolprovidedsimilareffectsdur-
ingafollow-upof3.3years.Wealsonotedatrendofbetterrenal
outcomesforintensiveBPcontrolamongpatientswithhigherlev-
elsofproteinuria,butthisfindingdidnotreachstatisticalsignifi-
cance during this timeframe of follow-up.
Compared with whites, blacks with hypertension are more
prone to develop CKD and progress to ESRD, and this is likely
to involve a complex interaction between biological and socio-
economic factors.37-39 Previous studies have reported that the
kidney protection with antihypertensive therapy is less favor-
able in blacks than in whites.18,40 Similarly, we found a trend
that only nonblacks gained additional kidney protection from
intensive BP lowering. However, statistical power in our meta-
analysis to address effects in blacks is relatively limited be-
cause there were only 2 RCTs among the black population.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, there was between-
study variability owing to different patient characteristics and
trial designs among included studies. The causes of CKD (hy-
pertension, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, or
othercauses)andthetypesofBPtarget(systolicBP,diastolicBP,
ormeanarterialpressure)variedacrossincludedstudies.Inspite
oftheeffortsinmeta-regressionandsubgroupanalyses,wecould
only partly explain the influences of race or proteinuria on in-
terventioneffects.Thenumberofincludedstudieslimitedpower
for further exploration with multivariable meta-regression or
multilevel subgroup analyses. Second, achieved BP could re-
sult in unblinding of the included trials. Nevertheless, the ob-
jectivenatureoftheoutcomemeasuresreducedthepossibleim-
pact of the lack of blinding. Third, most of the included studies
had a follow-up time shorter than 4 years because we only in-
cludeddataduringthetrialphase.Thelengthoffollow-upmight
not have been long enough to distinguish outcome differences
amongtheoverallstudypopulation.Fourth,thissystematicre-
view included information from published studies only. Al-
though funnel plots and Egger test did not suggest publication
bias,suchbiascouldstillexistowingtotherelativelylowpower
ofthesestatisticaltests.Finally,thisstudywasdesignedtoevalu-
ate nondiabetic patients with CKD and focused on renal out-
comes. Considering the competing risks between ESRD and
death, furth studies are needed to evaluate the cardioprotec-
tive effects of intensive BP-lowering treatments in nondiabetic
CKD patients.
Conclusions
Targeting BP below the current standard did not provide ad-
ditional benefit for renal outcomes compared with standard
treatment during a follow-up of 3.3 years in patients with CKD
without diabetes. However, nonblack patients or those with
higher levels of proteinuria might benefit from the intensive
BP lowering, and the risk of adverse events are mostly similar
among different BP targets.
