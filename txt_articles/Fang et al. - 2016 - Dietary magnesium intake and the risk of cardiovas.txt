Abstract
Background: Although studies have examined the association between dietary magnesium intake and health
outcome, the results are inconclusive. Here, we conducted a dose–response meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies in order to investigate the correlation between magnesium intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease
(CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and all-cause mortality.
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for articles that contained risk estimates for the
outcomes of interest and were published through May 31, 2016. The pooled results were analyzed using a random-
effects model.
Results: Forty prospective cohort studies totaling more than 1 million participants were included in the analysis.
During the follow-up periods (ranging from 4 to 30 years), 7678 cases of CVD, 6845 cases of coronary heart disease
(CHD), 701 cases of heart failure, 14,755 cases of stroke, 26,299 cases of T2D, and 10,983 deaths were reported. No
significant association was observed between increasing dietary magnesium intake (per 100 mg/day increment)
and the risk of total CVD (RR: 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10) or CHD (RR: 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–1.01). However, the same
incremental increase in magnesium intake was associated with a 22% reduction in the risk of heart failure (RR: 0.78;
95% CI, 0.69–0.89) and a 7% reduction in the risk of stroke (RR: 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89–0.97). Moreover, the summary
relative risks of T2D and mortality per 100 mg/day increment in magnesium intake were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77–0.86)
and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.81–0.99), respectively.
Conclusions: Increasing dietary magnesium intake is associated with a reduced risk of stroke, heart failure, diabetes,
and all-cause mortality, but not CHD or total CVD. These findings support the notion that increasing dietary
magnesium might provide health benefits.

 Background
Magnesium is the eighth most common element in our
planet’s crust and a biologically active mineral essential
for life. All cells require magnesium, which acts as a crit-
ical cofactor for hundreds of enzymes involved in glu-
cose metabolism, protein production, and nucleic acid
synthesis [1]. Due to the daily loss of magnesium in
feces, urine, and sweat [2], humans require magnesium
intake (for example, by consuming magnesium-rich foods
such as whole grains, green leafy vegetables, and nuts) in
order to maintain normal magnesium levels [3, 4].
Despite the availability of many magnesium-rich foods,
magnesium deficiency (i.e., hypomagnesemia, which is de-
fined as a serum magnesium concentration < 0.74 mmol/L)
is relatively common, with an estimated prevalence of 2.5–
15% in the general population [5, 6]. The primary cause of
hypomagnesemia is often insufficient dietary intake.
Dietary magnesium is absorbed primarily by the small
intestine via passive paracellular transport, which is
driven by an electrochemical gradient and solvent drag
[7, 8]. Interestingly, the intestinal absorption of magne-
sium is not directly proportional to magnesium intake,
but depends primarily on the body’s magnesium status
[9]. Peacock et al. once reported a correlation coeffi-
cient of 0.053 between baseline dietary and serum
magnesium in a cohort study [10]. Even in developed
countries such as the United States, many adults fail to
meet the recommended daily intake of magnesium [11],
despite the fact that epidemiology studies indicate that
low levels of serum magnesium can increase the risk
of a wide range of diseases, including chronic ob-
structive pulmonary disease [12], metabolic syndrome
[13], type 2 diabetes (T2D) [14], Alzheimer’s disease
[15], and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [16]. Therefore,
understanding the relationship between dietary magne-
sium intake and overall health outcome is important
for guiding public awareness and establishing clear
dietary guidelines, thereby reducing the risk of magne-
sium deficiency-related diseases.
Previous meta-analyses suggest that the consumption
of magnesium is associated with a reduced incidence of
CVD and diabetes [17–19]. In recent years, a growing
number of well-designed population-based studies fo-
cused on the relationship between magnesium and the
risk of CVD, diabetes, and all-cause mortality, providing
results that might be of great importance with respect to
public health issues. However, these studies varied with
respect to sample size, magnesium intake, and other
characteristics, thereby contributing to inconsistencies
within the literature [20, 21]. Therefore, we performed a
comprehensive meta-analysis of all published prospect-
ive cohort studies in order to quantify the dose–re-
sponse relationship between dietary magnesium intake
and the risk of CVD, T2D, and all-cause mortality.
Methods
This meta-analysis was designed, implemented, analyzed,
and reported in accordance with the Meta-analysis of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) proto-
col [22].
Search strategy
We
systematically
searched
the
databases
PubMed,
Embase, and Web of Science for prospective cohort
studies published through May 31, 2016. The following
keywords were used in the literature search: “magne-
sium” AND (“cardiovascular disease” OR “coronary
heart disease” OR “myocardial infarction” OR “heart fail-
ure” OR “stroke” OR “cerebrovascular disease” OR “is-
chemic heart disease” OR “diabetes” OR “mortality” OR
“death”) AND (“cohort” OR “prospective” OR “follow-
up” OR “longitudinal” OR “population”). Our search was
restricted to studies conducted in humans, and no re-
striction was imposed with respect to the language of
the publications. The references cited within the re-
trieved relevant articles were also reviewed in order to
identify additional studies.
Study selection
Studies that satisfied the following four criteria were in-
cluded in our meta-analysis: (1) prospective study de-
sign; (2) the exposure of interest was dietary intake of
magnesium; (3) the outcome was CVD (including coron-
ary heart disease/ischemic heart disease, and/or stroke),
type 2 diabetes, and/or all-cause mortality; and (4) the
authors reported risk estimates with 95% confidence in-
tervals (95% CI). We excluded reviews, meta-analyses,
retrospective studies, and published letters that lacked
sufficient data. To ensure the correct identification of
eligible studies, we used a two-step selection process
[23]. First, two independent investigators (authors XF
and KW) conducted an initial screening of all titles and/
or abstracts; the full text of each potentially relevant art-
icle was then evaluated.
Data extraction
Data were extracted using a standardized data collection
form. Two investigators (authors XF and KW) independ-
ently extracted detailed information from each included
article. Any discrepancies were resolved through group
discussion with a third investigator (author FW). We ex-
tracted the following information: the first author of the
publication, the year of publication, study location, study
name (where applicable), the duration of follow-up, sex,
sample size (the number of cases and/or participants),
the method used to assess dietary intake (food-frequency
questionnaire, 24-h recall, or other), the categories of
magnesium intake, and the corresponding risk estimates

 with 95% CIs. We extracted the risk estimates with the
most adjustment.
Quality assessment was performed in accordance with
the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for non-randomized studies
[24]. This scale assigns a maximum of 9 points to each
study as follows: 4 points for the selection of participants
and measurement of exposure, 2 points for comparabil-
ity, and 3 points for assessment of outcomes and ad-
equate follow-up. We regarded scores of 0–3, 4–6, and
7–9 as reflecting low, moderate, and high quality,
respectively.
Statistical analysis
Relative risk (RR) with the 95% CI was used as the com-
mon measure of association across studies; the hazard
ratio and incidence rate ratio were considered to ap-
proximate RR. Studies that stratified the data by sex
and/or stroke subgroup were treated as two separate re-
ports. We used a random-effects model to calculate the
summarized RRs and their corresponding 95% CIs for
comparison between the highest and lowest levels of
magnesium intake [25].
Due to the relatively wide range of definitions for the
exposure categories in the included articles, we per-
formed a dose-response analysis based on a 100 mg/day
increase in magnesium intake, using the method recom-
mended by Greenland and Longnecker and the publicly
available Stata code written by Orsini et al. [26, 27]. The
categories of magnesium intake, distributions of cases
and person-years, and RRs and 95% CIs were extracted.
If the number of cases and/or person-years was not
available, variance-weighted least squares regression was
used to achieve the pooled risk estimate [28, 29]. If nei-
ther median nor mean values were reported, we used
the categorical midpoint. If the highest or lowest cat-
egory was open-ended, the midpoint of the category was
estimated by assuming that the width of the category
was the same as the next adjacent category. In addition,
we evaluated the non-linear association between dietary
magnesium intake and risk of outcomes using restricted
cubic splines, with three knots at the 10th, 50th, and
90th percentiles of the distribution [30]. A P value for
curve linearity or non-linearity was calculated by testing
the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the second
spline is equal to zero.
Heterogeneity among the studies was estimated using
the I2 statistic, with values of 25%, 50%, and 75% repre-
senting low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogen-
eity, respectively [31, 32]. To explore the significance of
the difference in RRs and the possible influence of re-
sidual confounding factors, we performed subgroup ana-
lyses and a meta-regression analysis on possible sources
of heterogeneity, including sex, geographic location, and
stroke subtype [33].
Publication
bias
was
evaluated
using
contour-
enhanced funnel plots, Egger’s linear regression test, and
Begg’s rank correlation test, with significance set to
P < 0.10 [34–36]. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using Stata version 12. Except where noted
otherwise,
differences
with
a
P
value < 0.05
were
considered significant.
Results
Study characteristics
Figure 1 shows the study selection process and the re-
sults of our literature search. Using our search strategy
(see Methods), we identified 1128 articles from PubMed,
2221 articles from Embase, and 2031 articles from Web
of Science. After duplicates and studies that did not
meet the inclusion criteria were excluded, 40 publica-
tions comprising 70 studies were ultimately included in our
main analysis [20, 21, 37–74]. Because some studies con-
tributed to more than one outcome, and because results
stratified by sex and subtypes were treated separately, a
total of 70 reports and/or datasets were included in the
final meta-analysis. These prospective studies were pub-
lished from 1999 through 2016, and the follow-up

 periods ranged from 4 to 30 years. Twenty-two studies
were conducted in the United States, six in China, five in
Japan, two in Sweden, and one each in the United
Kingdom, Spain, Australia, Finland, and Germany. In
total, we identified 7678 cases of CVD; 6845 cases of cor-
onary heart disease (CHD); 701 cases of heart failure;
14,755 cases of stroke; 26,299 cases of T2D, and 10,983
cases of all-cause mortality. Dietary magnesium intake
was assessed using a validated food frequency question-
naire in all studies except one. Study quality scores
ranged from 7 to 9; the mean quality score was 8.2
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Detailed characteristics re-
garding the studies included in our analysis are summa-
rized in Table 1.
Dietary magnesium intake and the risk of CVD
Ten independent reports from eight studies investigated
the association between dietary magnesium intake and
the risk of CVD. The pooled results suggest that magne-
sium intake is not significantly associated with CVD,
which was suggested both by the highest category versus
lowest category (RR: 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85–1.07) and by the
per 100 mg/day increase (RR: 0.99, 95% CI, 0.88–1.10)
(Fig. 2); in addition, we found evidence of between-study
heterogeneity (I2 = 45.7% and 69.7%, respectively). We
also found no evidence of a non-linear association be-
tween dietary magnesium and CVD risk (P = 0.097 for
non-linearity; see Fig. 6a).
Nine reports from six studies were included in our
analysis of the association between magnesium intake
and CHD. We found that the highest category of dietary
magnesium was associated with a 10% lower risk of
CHD compared to the lowest category of dietary magne-
sium (RR: 0.90; 95% CI, 0.80–0.99; Fig. 2), with low het-
erogeneity (I2 = 13.4%). One study was not included in
the dose–response analysis because it did not report spe-
cific data regarding the level of magnesium intake [59].
When we pooled the data from the remaining five stud-
ies, we found that a 100 mg/day increase in dietary
magnesium intake was not significantly associated with
CHD risk (RR: 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–1.01; Fig. 2). However,
a
significant
non-linear
association
was
observed
using the restricted cubic splines model (P < 0.05 for
non-linearity; Fig. 6b).
At the time of our latest search, only three published
datasets from two independent cohorts reported the as-
sociation between magnesium intake and heart failure.
We pooled these results and found strong inverse cor-
relations for both the highest category versus lowest
category (RR: 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52–0.91) and for a per
100 mg/day increase (RR: 0.78, 95% CI, 0.69–0.89), with
no heterogeneity. Because of the limited number of
datasets, non-linear association was not investigated in
this study.
Dietary magnesium intake and the risk of stroke
Fourteen prospective cohort studies estimated the risk
of total stroke between the highest and lowest levels of
magnesium intake; these results suggest a significant in-
verse correlation (RR: 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.95; Fig. 3),
with low heterogeneity (I2 = 22.2%). After we excluded
one study that was ineligible due to a lack of detailed
magnesium categories [60], the dose–response analysis
revealed that for each 100 mg/day increase in magne-
sium intake, the risk of stroke decreased by 7% (RR:
0.93; 95% CI, 0.89–0.97; Fig. 3), with low heterogeneity
(I2 = 23.8%). Accordingly, we also found a significant
non-linear
association
(P < 0.001
for
non-linearity;
Fig. 6C).
Dietary magnesium intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes
The multivariable-adjusted RRs of T2D are shown in
Fig. 4. When we compared the highest category of mag-
nesium intake with the lowest category of magnesium
intake, the pooled RR of T2D was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.69–
0.80), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 49.8%). When
we examined the risk associated with a 100 mg/day in-
crease in magnesium intake, the pooled RR was 0.81
(95% CI, 0.77–0.86), with relatively high heterogeneity
(I2 = 60.3%). We also found a significant non-linear
dose–response relationship between magnesium intake
and T2D (P < 0.001 for non-linearity; Fig. 6d).
Dietary magnesium intake and all-cause mortality
With respect to all-cause mortality, the association with
dietary magnesium intake was not statistically significant
between the highest and lowest intake categories (RR:
0.88; 95% CI, 0.76–1.01; Fig. 5), with moderately high
heterogeneity (I2 = 62.4%). However, a dose–response
analysis revealed that each 100 mg/day increase in diet-
ary magnesium intake was associated with a 10% lower
risk of mortality (RR: 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–0.99; Fig. 5),
with moderately high heterogeneity (I2 = 62.3%). A cubic
spline model revealed an inverse non-linear correlation
between dietary magnesium intake and the risk of all-
cause mortality (P < 0.01 for non-linearity; Fig. 6e).
Subgroup analyses
Next, we performed subgroup analyses (with sex and
study location as subgroups) in order to examine the
stability of the primary results; these results are summa-
rized in Table 2. The associations between dietary mag-
nesium intake and the risks of CVD, T2D, and all-cause
mortality were similar between our main analyses and
our subgroup analyses, and meta-regression did not re-
veal any substantial change in the pooled relative risks.
However, the inverse correlation remained significant
only between increased magnesium intake and stroke in-
cidence (RR: 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89–0.95), but not between

 increased magnesium intake and mortality (RR: 1.07;
95% CI, 0.90–1.28; P = 0.028 for meta-regression), and
no study heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 0%).
Publication bias
Visual inspection of funnel plots revealed no significant
publication bias (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Figure S2).
In addition, both Egger’s linear regression test and
Begg’s rank correlation test revealed little evidence of
publication bias with respect to magnesium intake in
relation to the risk of CVD, CHD, stroke, diabetes, or
all-cause mortality (Additional file 1: Table S2). The
assessment of publication bias was based on the fully
adjusted model.
Discussion
This systemic meta-analysis was based on 40 prospective
cohort studies, with more than 1 million participants
and 67,261 cases in nine countries. Thus, this meta-
analysis provides the most up-to-date epidemiological
evidence supporting the putative protective effect of
magnesium intake against stroke, heart failure, diabetes,
and all-cause mortality. A dose–response analysis re-
vealed that a 100 mg/day increase in dietary magnesium
intake is significantly associated with a 7%, 22%, 19%,

 and 10% decrease in the risk of stroke, heart failure, type
2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality, respectively. How-
ever, no clear association was found between magnesium
intake and the risk of coronary heart disease or total car-
diovascular disease, which may have been due – at least
in part – to the relatively limited number of studies in-
cluded in our analysis [75]. Further subgroup analyses
did not reveal any significant effect of geographic loca-
tion or sex on the respective correlations between mag-
nesium intake and disease risk.
Magnesium plays an important role in maintaining hu-
man health. A typical adult contains a total of approxi-
mately 22–26 grams of magnesium, with 60% in skeletal
tissue,
and
39%
and
1%
located
in
intra-
and
extracellular regions, respectively [76]. Magnesium is es-
sential to all living organisms, as it controls the function
of many crucial enzymes, including those that utilize or
synthesize ATP [77]. The recommended dietary allow-
ance of magnesium is 350 mg/day for an average male
adult and 300 mg/day for an average adult female, with
an additional 150 mg/day during pregnancy and lacta-
tion [2]. However, despite these clearly established rec-
ommendations, magnesium deficiency remains a global
public health problem. For example, diet surveys con-
ducted in both Europe and the United States revealed
that the daily intake of magnesium is generally lower
than the recommended amounts [77]. Moreover, a major
cause of magnesium deficiency can be attributed to an

 improperly balanced diet and/or impaired intestinal ab-
sorption [5, 78].
Compared to oral supplements and intravenous infu-
sion, increasing magnesium intake through diet may
only moderately increase one’s magnesium levels; how-
ever, increasing dietary magnesium intake is both safe
and effective. For example, green leafy vegetables such
as spinach provide magnesium through an abundance of
chlorophyll molecules. Spices, nuts, beans, cocoa, and
whole grains are also rich sources of magnesium [2]. Im-
portantly, although these foods contain relatively high
levels of magnesium, the daily requirement for magne-
sium is difficult to achieve through a single serving of
any one food item. Therefore, consuming a wide variety
of magnesium-rich foods will help ensure adequate daily
intake of magnesium. Here, we focused our analysis on
the association between dietary magnesium intake and
the incidence of highly prevalent chronic diseases and
all-cause mortality.
Larsson et al. [79] previously reported that dietary
magnesium intake is inversely correlated with the risk of
stroke, and many observational studies have confirmed
that magnesium intake affects the risk of cardiovascular
disease. However, these studies may have limited impli-
cations due to the lack of a non-linear analysis. In our
study, we quantitatively investigated the associations be-
tween dietary magnesium intake and specific cardiovas-
cular risks, including total CVD, CHD, heart failure, and
stroke, by performing a dose–response meta-analysis.
Notably, this is the first meta-analysis to investigate the
effect of dietary magnesium intake on the risk of heart
failure. Recently, Simental-Mendia et al. [80] systematic-
ally reviewed all published clinical trials and found bene-
ficial effects of using oral magnesium supplements for
4 months or longer; specifically, insulin sensitivity and
glucose control were improved in both diabetic and
non-diabetic subjects [80]. Based on their analysis, we
updated the most recent meta-analysis by Dong et al.,
who studied the effect of dietary magnesium on the risk
of diabetes [19]. To the best of our knowledge, our study
is the first quantitative meta-analysis to investigate the
dose–response relationship between dietary magnesium
intake and all-cause mortality.
Given the lack of large, randomized intervention trials
to increase magnesium intake in order to prevent CVD
and/or T2D, our comprehensive analysis of the most up-

 to-date prospective studies provides strong epidemio-
logical evidence of the effect of dietary magnesium on
CVD, T2D, and all-cause mortality. The strength of
our meta-analysis lies in three aspects. First, we in-
cluded all available prospective cohort studies with
high quality scores, large sample sizes, and long-term
follow-up data. According to the Newcastle-Ottawa
scale, the average quality of the included studies was
high. Second, the statistical power of our quantitative
assessment was greatly increased by the large number
of well-recorded cases. Finally, in addition to compar-
ing the highest and lowest categories of magnesium
intake, we also performed both linear and non-linear
dose–response analyses.
On the other hand, our study has several limitations
that warrant discussion. First, given the observational
nature of the included studies, we cannot exclude the
possibility of residual confounding, even in the fully ad-
justed models. Although a wide range of potential con-
founders, including demographics and lifestyle factors,
were adjusted for in the primary studies, dietary factors
may not have been considered to a sufficient degree.
Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that other
nutrients and/or dietary components correlated with
dietary magnesium may have been responsible, either
partially or entirely, for the observed associations. More-
over, the majority of dietary data were collected using a
food frequency questionnaire; although such a question-
naire can adequately characterize dietary patterns, it can
be limited in terms of describing the intake of individual
nutrients. For example, Ward et al. [81] compared the
data obtained from a food frequency questionnaire with
diet diary data in a nested case-control study and found
that food frequency questionnaires may not sufficiently
capture heterogeneity within a single population; how-
ever, they can be appropriate in pooled analyses in which
a wider range of intakes are collated [81]. Moreover, meas-
urement error might occur in dietary assessment, which
would likely bias true associations towards a null associ-
ation [82]. In addition, some participants may have

 changed their diet but may not have updated their infor-
mation during the follow-up period. A second limitation
is that we may have overlooked some studies and/or
missed unpublished reports, although every effort was
made to contact authors in order to obtain unpublished
risk estimates. Third, significant heterogeneity may exist
with respect to our meta-analyses between magnesium in-
take and the relative risks of total CVD, diabetes, and/or
all-cause mortality. Although we performed extensive
subgroup analyses using meta-regression, the sources of
heterogeneity remain unclear.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we observed significant inverse correla-
tions between dietary magnesium intake and the risk of
stroke, heart failure, diabetes, and all-cause mortality; in
contrast, we found no correlation between dietary mag-
nesium intake and the risk of coronary heart disease or
total cardiovascular disease. Our findings underscore the
notion that increasing the consumption of magnesium-
rich foods may be beneficial to overall health. In the fu-
ture, large prospective randomized controlled trials
should help identify the putative causal role that magne-
sium plays in reducing the incidence of these diseases.
