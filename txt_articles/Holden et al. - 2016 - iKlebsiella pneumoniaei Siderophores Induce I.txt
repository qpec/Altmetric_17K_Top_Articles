ABSTRACT
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative pathogen responsible for a wide range of infections, including pneumo-
nia and bacteremia, and is rapidly acquiring antibiotic resistance. K. pneumoniae requires secretion of siderophores, low-
molecular-weight, high-affinity iron chelators, for bacterial replication and full virulence. The specific combination of sidero-
phores secreted by K. pneumoniae during infection can impact tissue localization, systemic dissemination, and host survival.
However, the effect of these potent iron chelators on the host during infection is unknown. In vitro, siderophores deplete epithe-
lial cell iron, induce cytokine secretion, and activate the master transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1� (HIF-1�) pro-
tein that controls vascular permeability and inflammatory gene expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that siderophore secre-
tion by K. pneumoniae directly contributes to inflammation and bacterial dissemination during pneumonia. To examine the
effects of siderophore secretion independently of bacterial growth, we performed infections with tonB mutants that persist in
vivo but are deficient in siderophore import. Using a murine model of pneumonia, we found that siderophore secretion by
K. pneumoniae induces the secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6), CXCL1, and CXCL2, as well as bacterial dissemination to the
spleen, compared to siderophore-negative mutants at an equivalent bacterial number. Furthermore, we determined that
siderophore-secreting K. pneumoniae stabilized HIF-1� in vivo and that bacterial dissemination to the spleen required alveolar
epithelial HIF-1�. Our results indicate that siderophores act directly on the host to induce inflammatory cytokines and bacterial
dissemination and that HIF-1� is a susceptibility factor for bacterial invasion during pneumonia.
IMPORTANCE Klebsiella pneumoniae causes a wide range of bacterial diseases, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and
sepsis. To cause infection, K. pneumoniae steals iron from its host by secreting siderophores, small iron-chelating molecules.
Classically, siderophores are thought to worsen infections by promoting bacterial growth. In this study, we determined that
siderophore-secreting K. pneumoniae causes lung inflammation and bacterial dissemination to the bloodstream independently
of bacterial growth. Furthermore, we determined that siderophore-secreting K. pneumoniae activates a host protein, hypoxia
inducible factor (HIF)-1�, and requires it for siderophore-dependent bacterial dissemination. Although HIF-1� can protect
against some infections, it appears to worsen infection with K. pneumoniae. Together, these results indicate that bacterial sid-
erophores directly alter the host response to pneumonia in addition to providing iron for bacterial growth. Therapies that dis-
rupt production of siderophores could provide a two-pronged attack against K. pneumoniae infection by preventing bacterial
growth and preventing bacterial dissemination to the blood.

K
lebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative bacterium within the
Enterobacteriaceae family and is the causative agent of a wide
range of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infec-
tions, wound infections, and bacteremia. As the third-most-
common cause of hospital-acquired infections, K. pneumoniae
represents a major health care threat (1). Further compounding
this concern, K. pneumoniae is rapidly acquiring resistance to all
known antibiotics, thus becoming increasingly difficult to treat. In
particular, carbapenem-resistant strains of K. pneumoniae are re-
sistant to all or nearly all antibiotics and exhibit strikingly high
mortality rates of 41% to 50% for bloodstream infections (2, 3).
In order to establish infection, K. pneumoniae secretes mole-
cules called siderophores that are critical for bacterial growth and
replication (4, 5). Siderophores are small, high-affinity iron-
chelating molecules secreted by a wide variety of microorganisms
that are critical for virulence in many Gram-negative bacteria (6).
Enterobactin (Ent), with the highest known affinity for iron of any
molecule, is the prototypic catecholate siderophore and effectively
outcompetes host iron-binding proteins for iron (7). To counter
the effects of Ent, neutrophils and epithelial cells secrete lipocalin
2 (Lcn2; also known as NGAL, Scn, and 24p3), which binds Ent
with subnanomolar affinity (8). In vivo, the presence of Lcn2, by
preventing bacterial uptake of Ent, has been shown to be bacterio-
static (9, 10). Bacteria have evolved to secrete Lcn2-evasive sidero-
phores, such as salmochelin (Sal), a glycosylated Ent that requires
the iroA locus for production and transport; the phenolate sidero-

 phore yersiniabactin (Ybt); and the citrate-hydroxamate sidero-
phore aerobactin (6, 11, 12).
Because iron is critical for the function of many cellular pro-
cesses, including DNA replication and oxygen metabolism, and as
a cofactor for many cellular reactions, iron chelation by sidero-
phores could have significant effects on host cells (13, 14). How-
ever, the effects of siderophore-dependent manipulation of host
iron homeostasis during bacterial infection are largely unknown.
Iron chelation by siderophores in the presence of Lcn2 induces in
vitro proinflammatory cytokine secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8),
IL-6, and CCL20 from lung epithelial cells (15, 16). Siderophores
also induce the stabilization of the master transcription factor
hypoxia inducible factor-1� (HIF-1�) in vitro (15). HIF-1� regu-
lates the expression of many genes, including those involved in
glycolysis, inflammation, and angiogenesis, and is itself regulated
by the availability of oxygen or iron within a cell (17–19). In nor-
moxia, HIF-1� protein is targeted for degradation by prolyl hy-
droxylases, a reaction that requires iron (20). However, under
conditions of low oxygen or low iron levels, HIF-1� protein is
stabilized and translocates to the nucleus to activate gene expres-
sion (20–22). In addition to roles in adaptation to hypoxia and
tumor development, HIF-1� activation has recently been associ-
ated with innate immunity against infections. Infection with Pseu-
domonas aeruginosa in a Caenorhabditis elegans model system
identified siderophore-dependent activation of a hypoxic host re-
sponse that was partially protective (23). In a murine urinary tract
infection (UTI) model, HIF-1� was protective against Escherichia
coli infection through host innate immunity modulation (24).
These results indicate that siderophores have a broad and inflam-
matory effect on host epithelial cells in addition to their role as
iron acquisition molecules for bacteria. However, a critical barrier
to investigating this phenomenon in vivo is that siderophores al-
low bacterial proliferation, and an increase in bacterial CFU may
indirectly increase inflammation, tissue damage, and bacterial dis-
semination.
Ferric siderophores are actively imported by bacteria through
siderophore-specific outer membrane receptors that are depen-
dent on the TonB-ExuB-ExuD energy transducing system, and
tonB mutants secrete siderophores but cannot utilize them for
growth (25). K. pneumoniae tonB mutants retain their antiphago-
cytic capsule and serum resistance but are unable to grow under
iron-limited conditions (26). Upon inoculation, K. pneumoniae
tonB mutants stimulate the host immune response but do not
cause a productive infection.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that K. pneumoniae sid-
erophores disrupt iron homeostasis in host cells, leading to altered
host responses to pneumonia. To study the effects of siderophore
secretion independently of the indirect effects of siderophore-
dependent bacterial growth, we employed tonB mutants that are
capable of secreting siderophores but are not capable of utilizing
them. By dissociating siderophore secretion from bacterial
growth, we could directly compare levels of proinflammatory cy-
tokine secretion, bacterial dissemination, and HIF-1� stabiliza-
tion in response to infection with isogenic siderophore synthesis
mutants at equivalent bacterial numbers.
RESULTS
Siderophores induce bacterial dissemination and lung inflam-
mation. To measure the overall contribution of siderophores to
inflammation and bacterial dissemination, mice were infected
with a wild-type (WT) strain of K. pneumoniae that secretes Ent,
Sal, and Ybt or an isogenic siderophore-negative entB ybtS mutant
(4, 27). Infection with WT K. pneumoniae resulted in increased
lung bacterial load compared to infection with the entB ybtS mu-
tant (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, siderophores were required for
K. pneumoniae dissemination to the spleen (Fig. 1B). Additionally,
siderophores were required for induction of proinflammatory cy-
tokines: the WT strain, but not the entB ybtS mutant, induced
expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), CXCL1, CXCL2, IL-1�, and
macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha (MIP-3�) (Fig. 1C).
The increase in bacterial dissemination and the inflammatory
response during WT infection could be due to direct effects of iron
chelation by siderophores on the host or to an indirect effect of
siderophores increasing bacterial CFU in the lungs. To distinguish
between these possibilities, we utilized a tonB mutant. As ex-
pected, the tonB mutant secreted siderophores but was not able to
utilize endogenous or exogenous siderophores for bacterial
growth (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Because the WT
and tonB K. pneumoniae strains produce an antiphagocytic cap-
sule, we hypothesized that the tonB mutant would persist in the
lung and secrete siderophores but would not replicate (26, 28). To
compare infections performed with the WT and tonB K. pneu-
moniae strains, C57BL/6 mice were infected with 1 � 108 CFU
tonB K. pneumoniae or 1 � 104 CFU WT K. pneumoniae for 24 or
48 h. After 24 h, tonB K. pneumoniae persisted in the lung and
spleen, with a bacterial load comparable to that seen after 48 h of
infection with WT K. pneumoniae (Fig. 2A and B). At 24 h, tonB
K. pneumoniae infection also caused levels of induction of IL-6,
CXCL1, CXCL2, IL-1�, and MIP-3� secretion that were compa-
rable to those seen after 48 h of infection with WT K. pneumoniae

 (Fig. 2C to G). Additionally, we determined the concentrations of
siderophores during infection with the tonB and WT K. pneu-
moniae strains by performing mass spectrometry (Fig. 2H; see also
Fig. S2). Micromolar concentrations of Sal were detected in
whole-lung homogenates from all infections. Ybt was detected in
lower quantities in all lung samples, but Ent was not detected.
Although bacterial growth dynamics differ, these results indicate
that tonB K. pneumoniae infections can be used to examine the
impact of siderophores on the host at concentrations and bacterial
densities that mimic WT K. pneumoniae infection.
To determine the impact of siderophore secretion on dissem-
ination and cytokine responses, C57BL/6 mice were infected with
isogenic

(siderophore-secreting)
or

(siderophore-negative) K. pneumoniae. Despite equivalent bacte-
rial loads, infection with tonB K. pneumoniae resulted in increased
bacterial dissemination and IL-6, CXCL1, and CXCL2 secretion
compared to infection with the entB ybtS tonB mutant (Fig. 3).
Infection with the tonB strain did not enhance secretion of IL-1�
or MIP-3� compared to the entB ybtS tonB mutant (Fig. 3C),
suggesting that the differences between the level of induction by
the WT strain and the level of induction by the entB ybtS strain
were attributable to differences in bacterial density (Fig. 1C). In
vitro, Lcn2 enhances induction of proinflammatory cytokines by
siderophores (15). To examine the contribution of Lcn2, Lcn2-
deficient (LcnKO) mice were infected with tonB or entB ybtS tonB
K. pneumoniae. The same pattern of cytokine induction and dis-
semination was observed in WT and LcnKO mice, indicating that
Lcn2 was not required for siderophore-dependent dissemination
and inflammation in vivo (Fig. 3).
Multiple siderophores are required for bacterial dissemina-
tion and cytokine secretion. In vitro, Ent and Ybt induced proin-
flammatory cytokine secretion, but Sal did not (15). Because WT
K. pneumoniae secretes Ent, Sal, and Ybt, it is unclear which sid-
erophores are required to induce bacterial dissemination and in-
flammation during pneumonia. To test which siderophores were
necessary for maximal dissemination and cytokine secretion, we
used isogenic siderophore-secreting tonB mutants (Table 1) that
secrete one or two siderophores to infect C57BL/6 mice. The iroA
locus, required to produce Sal, was disrupted by mutation of the
iroB glycosylase gene (9). Importantly, the infections performed
with all mutants resulted in equivalent lung bacterial loads
(Fig. 4A). Consistently, infection with tonB K. pneumoniae in-

 duced significantly more dissemination to the spleen than infec-
tion with the entB ybtS tonB mutant (Fig. 4B). No other sidero-
phore mutant induced significant dissemination compared to the
entB ybtS tonB (siderophore-negative) mutant. These data indi-
cate that all siderophores are required in combination for maxi-
mal bacterial dissemination to the spleen.
To determine if each individual siderophore is sufficient to
induce cytokine secretion, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISAs) were performed on lung homogenates taken at 24 h
postinfection. Only infection with the tonB mutant was sufficient
to induce more secretion of IL-6, CXCL1, or CXCL2 than infec-
tion with the entB ybtS tonB (siderophore-negative) mutant, indi-
cating that all three siderophores are required for secretion of
these cytokines (Fig. 4C to E). Consistent with Fig. 3, siderophore
secretion did not specifically induce IL-1� or MIP-3� (see
Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Binding by Lcn2 could mask
the effects of Ent on inflammation and dissemination. To test this
hypothesis, we compared the levels of cytokine secretion and dis-
semination in C57BL/6 and LcnKO mice infected with iroA ybtS
tonB (Ent-positive [Ent�]) K. pneumoniae (see Fig. S4). LcnKO
mice did not display differences in spleen bacterial load or lung
inflammation compared to C57BL/6 WT mice, indicating that the
presence of Ent is not sufficient to induce dissemination or in-
flammation, even in the absence of Lcn2. Together, these results
indicate that Sal, Ent, and Ybt are required to induce maximal
secretion of IL-6, CXCL1, and CXCL2.
Siderophores secreted by K. pneumoniae stabilize HIF-1�.
To test the hypothesis that K. pneumoniae siderophores stabilize
HIF-1� during pneumonia, we utilized a transgenic mouse model
that expresses a fusion protein of luciferase with the oxygen-
dependent domain (ODD) (ODD-Luc) of HIF-1� that is subject
to prolyl hydroxylation and becomes stabilized under low oxygen
or low iron conditions (29–31). Infection of ODD-Luc mice with
WT K. pneumoniae induced increased bioluminescence in the
lung compared to the results obtained with a phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) vehicle control (see Fig. S5A in the supplemental
material). To determine whether siderophores secreted by
K. pneumoniae induce HIF-1� stabilization in vivo during infec-
tion, ODD-Luc mice were infected with tonB (siderophore-
positive) or entB ybtS tonB (siderophore-negative) K. pneu-
moniae. Infection with tonB induced greater bioluminescence in
the lung than infection with entB ybtS tonB, though infection with
entB ybtS tonB did induce some bioluminescence compared to
infection with the PBS vehicle control (see Fig. S5B). These results
indicate that siderophores secreted in vivo can stabilize the HIF-1�
transcription factor.
We then sought to determine whether individual siderophores
were capable of stabilizing HIF-1�. To do so, ODD-Luc mice were
infected with isogenic siderophore tonB mutants, and bacterial
loads in the lung and spleen were quantified (Fig. 5A and B). The
tonB mutants had equivalent lung CFU levels but significantly
higher spleen CFU levels than the entB ybtS tonB mutants, consis-
tent with previous data. Additionally, luciferase expression in the
lung homogenate was quantified as fold change compared to the
entB ybtS tonB (siderophore-negative) mutant. Infection with the
tonB mutant induced significantly more luciferase expression
than infection with the other isogenic strains (Fig. 5C). Infection
with the iroA ybtS tonB (Ent�) strain resulted in CFU counts
equivalent to tonB and entB ybtS tonB infection but did not result
in significant dissemination to the spleen or induction of lu-

 ciferase. ODD-Luc mice infected with the entB tonB (Ybt�) mu-
tant displayed a higher bacterial load in the lung upon infection,
confounding comparisons to the other strains. This mutant in-
duced increased luciferase expression for a few mice and had cor-
respondingly high CFU counts in the spleen. We therefore hy-
pothesized that siderophore-dependent HIF-1� stabilization in
the lung correlates with bacterial load in the spleen and that the
outliers in the entB tonB mutant are the exceptions that prove the
rule. To examine this hypothesis, spleen bacterial load was
graphed as a function of luciferase levels in the lung, and the cor-
relation was determined. This plot revealed a positive correlation
between spleen bacterial load and luciferase expression during
infection with K. pneumoniae across all siderophore mutant geno-
types (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data indicate that HIF-1� is
consistently stabilized only by tonB K. pneumoniae that produces
all three siderophores and that stabilization of HIF-1� by K. pneu-
moniae secreting siderophores correlates with bacterial dissemi-
nation to the spleen.
Lung epithelial HIF-1� is required for bacterial dissemina-
tion to the spleen. Because HIF-1� stabilization correlates with
bacterial dissemination to the spleen, and because HIF-1� regu-
lates vascular permeability and inflammation, we hypothesized
that HIF-1� is required for siderophore induction of bacterial
dissemination and the host proinflammatory response. To test
this hypothesis, we utilized transgenic mice that have an inducible
lung epithelial cell-specific Hif1a deletion (55), using either mice
induced with doxycycline postnatally (Hif1a�/�) or uninduced,
wild-type littermates (Hif1a�/�). To test the effect of epithelial
HIF-1� on a productive infection with replicative K. pneumoniae,
the WT strain and entB ybtS mutant were used instead of their
tonB counterparts. Infection with WT K. pneumoniae did not
cause HIF-1�-dependent differences in lung bacterial load
(Fig. 6A). However, Hif1a�/� mice displayed significantly less
bacterial dissemination to the spleen after 24 h, indicating that
HIF-1� promotes bacterial dissemination to the spleen (Fig. 6B).
The siderophore-negative entB ybtS mutant had lower lung and
spleen CFU counts than the WT, which was not affected by the
absence of lung epithelial HIF-1� (Fig. 6). Infection with WT
K. pneumoniae induced significantly more IL-6 and CXCL2 than
infection with the entB ybtS mutant, consistent with the
siderophore-dependent effects observed as described above, and
more IL-1�, which may be attributable to higher bacterial density
(see Fig. S6 in the supplemental material). However, there were no
HIF-1�-dependent differences in lung cytokine secretion, indi-
cating that lung epithelial HIF-1� is not required to induce IL-1�,
IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL2, or MIP-3� secretion during infection (see
Fig. S6). These data suggest a role for epithelial HIF-1� stabiliza-
tion by siderophores in the induction of bacterial dissemination
during K. pneumoniae infection.
DISCUSSION
K. pneumoniae is a Gram-negative bacterium that is rapidly ac-
quiring resistance to all known antibiotics, including carbapen-
ems. Developing novel therapies to combat antibiotic-resistant
infections requires a more complete understanding of disease
pathogenesis. To determine the effect of siderophores on the host

 response to infection, we utilized tonB mutants that allowed us to
uncouple siderophore secretion from bacterial growth. We show
that K. pneumoniae siderophores are a major trigger of the inflam-
mation and bacterial dissemination induced during lung infection
with K. pneumoniae, independently of their ability to deliver iron
to bacteria. Additionally, we show that the induction of bacterial
dissemination by siderophores requires master transcription fac-
tor HIF-1� in lung epithelial cells. These findings represent a
novel function for bacterial siderophores in cytokine secretion
and bacterial dissemination and a novel function for host master
transcription factor HIF-1� as a susceptibility factor for the devel-
opment of sepsis.
Our data indicate that siderophores induce dissemination
through chelation of host cellular iron, leading to inactivation of
iron-dependent prolyl hydroxylases and HIF-1� stabilization in
lung epithelial cells. We have previously shown that purified sid-
erophores deplete cellular iron in respiratory epithelial cells and
stabilize HIF-1� and that activation of HIF-1�-dependent gene
expression is abrogated by iron (15). The siderophore desferriox-
amine is a canonical activator of HIF-1�, indicating that iron che-
lation is sufficient for stabilization (24). Accordingly, we demon-
strate that the prolyl-containing ODD of HIF-1� is stabilized in
vivo by siderophore-producing K. pneumoniae. The WT strain
secretes Sal and Ybt in vivo, and both are required for maximal
HIF-1� induction. Siderophore-dependent dissemination is
blocked in a lung epithelial HIF-1� knockout mouse, indicating
that this cell type mediates bacterial spread from the lung to the
spleen. The mechanism is unknown and, since HIF-1� is a global
transcriptional regulator, may be complex and multifactorial. For
example, HIF-1� regulates cellular metabolism and survival and
can induce vascular permeability and angiogenesis (32, 33) or dis-
ruption of epithelial barriers (34).
HIF-1� stabilization by siderophore-dependent iron chelation
leading to bacteremia contrasts with the protective effect of
HIF-1� stabilization by a pharmacological molecule, AKB-4924,
during murine UTI (24). These contrasting results may be due to
differences in both pathogen and model system. For instance,
treatment with AKB-4924 prevented internalization of E. coli by
uroepithelial cells. K. pneumoniae is not readily internalized by
epithelial cells due to its capsule; therefore, preventing the uptake
of bacteria through HIF-1� stabilization may not be an effective
therapy against K. pneumoniae infection (35). Together, these data
illustrate the complexity of HIF-pathogen interactions and high-
light the importance of evaluating many various bacterial infec-
tions and model systems.
Mass spectrometry demonstrated that Sal and Ybt are the main
siderophores produced during K. pneumoniae lung infection
(Fig. 2H; see also Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). This anal-
ysis has been used to quantify Ent, Sal, and aerobactin in chicken
air sacs during E. coli infection (36). To our knowledge, these data
represent the first published concentrations of siderophores from
murine lung homogenates. The measured concentrations were of
the same magnitude as the concentrations used in vitro by our
group, as well as others, and provide a context for prior findings

 obtained using purified siderophores (15, 16, 37). Although tonB
K. pneumoniae secreted more siderophores in vitro, the concen-
trations observed in vivo were equal to or even slightly lower than
those seen with the WT strain, indicating that the tonB mutants
can assess the impact of siderophores on the host at physiologi-
cally relevant concentrations. Whereas micromolar concentra-
tions of Sal and high nanomolar amounts of Ybt were detected, we
were unable to detect Ent. We propose three possible explanations
for this finding: (i) Ent is sequestered by Lcn2, and is therefore
undetectable; (ii) bacteria convert all Ent to Sal in vivo to evade
Lcn2; or (iii) a combination of our two hypotheses, whereby bac-
teria convert the majority of Ent to Sal and the remaining Ent is
sequestered by Lcn2. These data suggest that the majority of in-
flammation and bacterial dissemination is due to the secretion of
Sal but also suggest a role for Ybt. However, we could not test the
contribution of Sal in isolation because it is not possible to create
mutants that produce Sal without intact Ent synthesis genes, and
we were unable to detect iron chelation by purified Sal in vitro (12,
15). In contrast, a mutant making Ent alone (the iroA ybtS tonB
mutant) showed no detectable induction of cytokines or dissem-
ination, with or without Lcn2. Together, these data implicate Sal
and Ybt as significant inducers of inflammation and dissemina-
tion during pneumonia.
In addition to inducing dissemination, Ybt and Sal are re-
quired for maximal induction of IL-6, CXCL1, and CXCL2, which
are all protective against lung infection with K. pneumoniae (38–
40). These results are consistent with prior in vitro data illustrating
that iron chelation by siderophores, as evidenced by depletion of
the labile iron pool and induction of the iron starvation marker
NDRG1, induces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-8
and IL-6 from A549 lung epithelial cells (15). Human IL-6 and
murine IL-6 act as inflammatory cytokines involved in hepatocyte
acute-phase responses and can upregulate hepcidin, an iron ho-
meostasis protein (41, 42). Murine CXCL1 and CXCL2 are neu-
trophil chemoattractants and are functionally similar to human
IL-8 (43). Whereas lung epithelial HIF-1� is instrumental in bac-
terial dissemination to the spleen, it was not required for the in-
duction of cytokines. These results contrast with studies showing
that HIF-1� regulates IL-6 and that epithelial HIF-1� regulates
IL-6 and IL-1� secretion in a lung contusion model (44, 45). My-
eloid cell HIF-1� has been shown to be instrumental in inflam-
mation through myeloid cell development, phagocytosis, and an-
timicrobial production (46–48). In addition to HIF-1� regulation
of inflammation, HIF-2� can regulate macrophage function in
tumor models, eosinophil function in the lung, and IL-6 secretion
from endothelial cells (49–51). Therefore, it is possible that an-
other cell-specific HIF-1� or HIF-2� could be responsible for reg-
ulating cytokine secretion in response to K. pneumoniae infection.
Because HIF knockouts are embryonically lethal, testing other
HIF isoforms and cell types would require multiple lineage-
specific knockouts.
Although Lcn2 was necessary for siderophore induction of cy-
tokines in vitro, it was dispensable for the siderophore-dependent
immune response to K. pneumoniae in vivo (15). This may indi-
cate differential abilities of human and murine Lcn2 to modulate
immune responses. Although they share 62% amino acid identity,
murine Lcn2 lacks the ability to form covalent complexes, which
may explain this discrepancy (52). Alternatively, redundant sig-
naling pathways may be activated during pneumonia such that
inflammatory signaling by Lcn2 is dispensable. It may be that two
signals are required for the maximal induction of cytokine secre-
tion in response to infection with siderophore-secreting bacteria:
(i) perturbation of iron homeostasis by siderophores and (ii) sig-
naling by an inflammatory protein(s), including Lcn2. In vivo,
many proteins could satisfy the requirement of the second signal,
such as inflammasome activation or Toll-like receptor signaling
activation by capsule and lipopolysaccharide (53, 54).
On the basis of our data, we propose the following model: upon
infection and iron starvation, K. pneumoniae produces and se-
cretes siderophores. Siderophores serve to acquire host iron and
deliver it to the bacteria, resulting in bacterial growth. In addition
to supporting bacterial growth, chelation of host cellular iron by
siderophores induces cellular stress. One stress response is the
stabilization of HIF-1�, ultimately resulting in bacterial dissemi-
nation to the spleen. An opposing stress response is secretion
within the lung of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, CXCL1,
and CXCL2, which are necessary for protection from K. pneu-
moniae. These results indicate novel functions for bacterial sidero-
phores during infection that are independent of their iron delivery
capabilities and present siderophore molecules as a possible target
for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, these results indicate a
novel role for HIF-1� as a susceptibility factor for systemic spread
during K. pneumoniae infection and illustrate the complex inter-
play between pathogen and host molecules during bacterial infec-
tion.
FIG 6 Lung epithelial HIF-1� is necessary for siderophore-dependent bac-
terial dissemination to the spleen. Hif1a�/� or Hif1a�/� mice (n � 6 to 14 per
group) were infected with 1 � 104 CFU wild-type or entB ybtS K. pneumoniae.
Following 24 h, mice were euthanized, and organs were harvested for bacterial
load in the (A) lung and (B) spleen. Statistics were calculated using one-way
ANOVA with Fisher’s posttest (**, P � 0.01; ns, P � 0.05 [as indicated]).

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal strains and ethics statement. All work was approved by the Uni-
versity of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC). C57BL/6 lipocalin 2-deficient (LcnKO), ODD-luciferase
(ODD-Luc) (29), and conditional alveolar epithelial HIF-1�-deficient
[SP-C-rtTA�/tg/(tetO)7-CMV-Cretg/tg/HIF-1flox/flox] mice were bred on-
site. To induce epithelial cell knockout of HIF-1�, newborn mice were
treated as previously described (56).
Bacterial strains and media. K. pneumoniae KPPR1 and isogenic mu-
tants were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) at 37°C with shaking or
30°C on agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) supple-
mented with kanamycin (25 �g/ml), rifampin (30 �g/ml), or hygromycin
(100 �g/ml) as indicated (57). As noted, descriptions of bacteria were
obtained under iron-limited conditions: bacteria were grown overnight in
LB; subcultured 1:100 and incubated for 2 h with 10 �M 2,2=-dipyridyl
(DIP) at 37°C; subcultured into M9 media with 108 CFU; and incubated
overnight.
Murine pneumonia model. C57BL/6, lipocalin2-deficient (LcnKO)
ODD-luciferase (ODD-Luc) Hif1a�/� or Hif1a�/� mice (6 to 10 weeks
old) were infected with 1 � 104 WT or 1 � 108 CFU of indicated isogenic
tonB K. pneumoniae mutant grown under iron-limited conditions as pre-
viously described (5). To determine bacterial numbers in tissues, whole
lungs and spleens were removed and homogenized into 1 ml Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing EDTA-free protease inhib-
itor (Roche) and cultured to obtain bacterial counts.
ELISA. Cytokine protein concentrations in lung homogenates were
determined by ELISAs (Duoset kits; R&D Systems) according to the pro-
tocols of the manufacturer.
Siderophore quantification in lung homogenates. Whole lungs were
collected and homogenized in 1 ml DPBS with protease inhibitors as
described above, passed through a 0.2-�M-pore-size syringe filter (EMD
Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) to remove bacteria, and frozen at �80°C
until analysis. Siderophore concentrations were determined via mass
spectrometry as previously described (12, 36); complete experimental de-
tails can be found in Text S1 in the supplemental material.
Luciferase assay. ODD-Luc mice were infected and euthanized as de-
scribed above, and lungs and spleens were collected. Lungs were homog-
enized with DPBS and protease inhibitor (Roche), and an aliquot was
reserved for luciferase quantification. Luciferase cell lysis buffer (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was added to form a homogenate, and the
reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Protein
concentrations were quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay
(Thermo, Fisher). Thirty micrograms of protein was added to an opaque
Corning 96-well plate (Corning, NY), and luciferase buffer was added
using a BioTek Synergy multimode plate reader (BioTek). Luciferase buf-
fer was composed of 4.8 ml 0.11 mM Tris (pH 7.8), 50 �l 100 mM sodium
luciferin, 60 �l 200 mM ATP, and 120 �l 0.5 M MgCl2.
Mutant construction. PCR primers specific for conserved regions of
the tonB gene were constructed by comparing DNA sequences from var-
ious K. pneumoniae species (see Table S1 in the supplemental material)
(9). An internal 0.3-kb tonB PCR fragment was amplified and then cloned
into TA-based PCR cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
The tonB fragment was then extracted using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen,
Venlo, Limburg, The Netherlands), purified with a PCR cleanup kit (Qia-
gen), dephosphorylated, and ligated with a kanamycin-resistant deriva-
tive of �pir-dependent suicide vector pGP704 (58). This tonB suicide
vector was transformed into E. coli strain BW20767 [ATCC 47084; RP4-
2tet::Mu-1kan::Tn7 integrant uidA(DMlu1)::pir� recA1 creB510 leu-63
hsdR17 endA1 zbf-5 thi] and subsequently conjugated into the wild-type
strain and entB, ybtS, and entB ybtS mutants of K. pneumoniae to generate
tonB, entS tonB, ybtS tonB, and entB ybtS tonB mutants. Integration of the
suicide vector into the tonB gene was confirmed by generation of a PCR
product using one primer on the vector (pGP704 MCS Pst.Xba) and a
tonB-specific primer flanking the insertion site. To generate tonB mutants
in iroA and iroA ybtS mutant backgrounds, Lambda Red mutagenesis of
tonB was performed as previously described (5). The iroA and iroA ybtS
mutants contained a cointegration of pGP704 in the iroB glycosylase gene
that disrupts function of the iroA (salmochelin synthesis) locus as previ-
ously described (9). Primers are listed in Table S1.
Statistical analysis. Bacterial counts and ELISA data were log-
transformed and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
models with one mean per group, and pairs of treatments were compared
with Fisher’s posttest (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Luciferase assay data
were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s posttest. Correlation
data were calculated using the Pearson r correlation curve.
Data availability. All data have been summarized in graphs shown in
the main manuscript and supplemental figures.
