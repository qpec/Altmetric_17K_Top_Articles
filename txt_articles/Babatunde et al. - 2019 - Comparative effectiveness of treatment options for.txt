Objective To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of 
current treatment options for plantar heel pain (PHP).
Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis 
(NMA).
Data sources Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, 
PEDro, Cochrane Database, Web of Science and WHO 
Clinical Trials Platform were searched from their 
inception until January 2018.
study selection Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
of adults with PHP investigating common treatments 
(ie, corticosteroid injection, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, therapeutic exercise, orthoses and/
or extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)) compared 
with each other or a no treatment, placebo/sham control.
Data extraction and analysis Data were extracted 
and checked for accuracy and completeness by pairs of 
reviewers. Primary outcomes were pain and function. 
Comparative treatment effects were analysed by random 
effects NMA in the short term, medium term and long 
term. Relative ranking of treatments was assessed by 
surface under the cumulative ranking probabilities 
(0–100 scale).
Results Thirty-one RCTs (total n=2450 patients) 
were included. There was no evidence of inconsistency 
detected between direct and indirect treatment 
comparisons in the networks, but sparse data led to 
frequently wide CIs. Available evidence does not suggest 
that any of the commonly used treatments for the 
management of PHP are better than any other, although 
corticosteroid injections, alone or in combination with 
exercise, and ESWT were ranked most likely to be 
effective for the management of short-term, medium-
term and long-term pain or function; placebo/sham/
control appeared least likely to be effective; and exercise 
appeared to only be beneficial for long-term pain or 
function.
Conclusions Current evidence is equivocal 
regarding which treatment is the most effective for 
the management of PHP. Given limited understanding 
of long-term effects, there is need for large, 
methodologically robust multicentre RCTs investigating 
and directly comparing commonly used treatments for 
the management of PHP.

InTRODuCTIOn
Plantar heel pain (PHP) is the most prevalent soft 
tissue foot complaint, affecting 10% of adults 
during their lifetime1 and accounting for 25% of 
all foot disorders in athletes.2 Characterised by 
insidious onset, localised pain in the plantar heel 
region which may extend to the medial arch of the 
foot, the cause of PHP is unclear but is likely multi-
factorial. Risk factors include obesity, pronated 
foot type, reduced ankle or first metatarsophalan-
geal joint range of motion and prolonged weight-
bearing.3–5 PHP reduces mobility, impairs foot and 
physical function and the capacity for work, all of 
which have a negative impact on health-related 
quality of life.1 6 7
In terms of primary care management, current 
guidance suggests a period of watchful waiting with 
self-management advice followed by conservative 
interventions if there is no improvement, including; 
therapist-led exercises, foot orthoses, corticosteroid 
injections and extracorporeal shockwave therapy 
(ESWT).8–10 Although PHP is commonly thought 
to be a self-limiting condition, resolution of symp-
toms in some patients may take up to 18 
months.11 
Research to date suggests treatments do offer poten-
tial benefits in terms of reduced pain and improved 
function,1 but clinical decision-making is hampered 
due to a lack of robust evidence to inform the 
choice of treatment.
A Cochrane systematic review12 considered a 
range of interventions (including exercises, foot 
orthoses, corticosteroid injections, ESWT, laser 
therapy and therapeutic ultrasound) for PHP
, but 
was not able to pool the available data, found 
inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of 
treatments and overall, found limited evidence to 
inform clinical practice. Since the publication of 
this review, a number of additional randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted, of 
which the evidence has yet to be synthesised. A 
recent review13 of conservative treatments for PHP 
included many interventions (eg, laser therapy, 
orthoses, pulsed radiofrequency, dry-needling), 
which are not commonly used for managing PHP
, 
and analyses were limited by lack of power (two to 
three studies, mostly small sample sizes) except for 
the ESWT versus placebo comparison. Also, other 
previous systematic reviews10 12 14–16 have focused 
mostly on pairwise comparisons of two or three 
treatment options.
Day-to-day clinical decision making, however, 
often involves consideration of the ‘most effec-
tive’ among available treatment options for PHP
. 
Network meta-analysis (NMA) as a novel synthesis 
of evidence allows for simultaneous inferences 
regarding clinical effectiveness of all available treat-
ment options, by drawing together evidence from

direct and indirect comparisons of multiple treatments.17Com-
pared with traditional pairwise comparisons, NMA has the 
potential to increase the precision of the estimates of effects. 
Also, NMA enables a ranking of the different treatments relative 
to each other and aids clinical/shared decision making for clini-
cians and patients who may desire to know the ‘best treatment’ 
on average.17
There is a need therefore, to undertake a comprehensive, 
up-to-date systematic review of the comparative effectiveness of 
treatment options for PHP
. Using an NMA, this study aimed to 
evaluate and compare the most common conservative treatment 
options for the management of PHP
.
The specific objectives of this study were to:
i. 
determine the comparative effectiveness of treatments for 
relieving pain and improving function in patients with PHP;
ii. 
identify gaps in the available evidence, as well as identify 
promising treatments that require investigation in future 
RCTs.

Protocol/protocol registration
This review was conducted and reported in accordance with 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension statement for systematic reviews incor-
porating network meta-analyses for healthcare.18 An a priori 
protocol was established for this review and registered with the 
international prospective register of systematic reviews, PROS-
PERO number CRD42016046963 (http://www.

CRD42016046963).
Patient involvement
Patient involvement was central to the development of the 
research question. Within an advisory workshop which included 
participants who currently have or have experienced PHP 
(n=6) and clinicians (n=12; physiotherapists and podiatrists) 
involved in the management of foot pain, patients discussed 
their experiences of PHP and their concerns about the need to 
determine effective treatment options for relieving symptoms 
and improving function (ie, pain-free walking).
study eligibility
We evaluated each identified RCT against the following prede-
termined selection criteria:
i. 
Study population: adults, aged 18 
years and older with PHP 
(including plantar fasciitis, plantar fasciopathy, plantar fas-
ciosis) as diagnosed by clinical examination and/or diagnos-
tic imaging.
ii. 
Interventions: the review focused on four therapeutic in-
terventions (ie, exercise therapy, corticosteroid injections, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and ortho-
ses) that are commonly used in the management of PHP in 
the UK19 and an additional treatment (ie, ESWT), which is 
commonly reported in the literature.
iii. Due to an envisaged lack of suitable data on dosage and 
procedural variations of treatment options, this systematic 
review and NMA focused primarily on comparisons of the 
specified core therapeutic interventions (exercise therapy, 
corticosteroid injections, orthoses, NSAIDs and ESWT).
iv. Comparator: direct comparisons between any of the five 
core therapeutic interventions (ie, exercise therapy, cor-
ticosteroid injections, NSAIDs, orthoses and ESWT) or 
comparisons with usual care/placebo/sham for PHP in any 
healthcare setting (community, primary healthcare or sec-
ondary healthcare), and without restrictions regarding du-
ration, frequency or intensity of treatment. Studies only 
comparing different procedural techniques of the same in-
tervention (eg, focal vs radial shockwave) were excluded.
v. 
Outcome measure: the primary outcomes for this review 
were pain and functional disability. In order to be eligible 
for inclusion, assessment of pain and/or 
functional disability 
was required, studies with <24 
hours follow-up were ex-
cluded. Pain measures were placed in a hierarchy as follows:

first step pain, pain in the morning, pain on activity (eg, 
walking), overall pain (or other measures of pain). This hi-
erarchy was used to analyse the most clinically relevant data 
when multiple pain outcomes were reported in an RCT.
Information sources and search strategy
A comprehensive search strategy was developed in collabora-
tion with an information specialist, with input from clinicians 
and academics in the review team. Eight electronic databases 
(Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, Cochrane Data-
base of Systematic Reviews Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials 
(CENTRAL), Web of Science and WHO International Clinical 
Trials Registry Platform) were searched from their inception 
until January 2018 (see online supplementary appendix 1 for full 
search strategies). No language restrictions were applied. The 
bibliographies of relevant review articles and selected articles 
were examined for additional potentially relevant trials.
study selection
In pairs, reviewers (OB, AL, CL, LSC, MJT, DvdW
, ER) inde-
pendently evaluated the eligibility of identified trials. At each 
stage of titles, abstracts and full-text selection, discrepancies 
were resolved through discussion between pairs of reviewers or 
via consensus in review team meetings.
Risk of bias assessment
The Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool20 was used to 
assess the quality of included trials. Trials were graded (unclear, 
high or low risk of bias) based on: (i) sequence generation, (ii) 
allocation concealment, (iii) blinding of personnel, (iv) blinding 
of outcome assessor, (v) incomplete outcome data, (vi) selective 
outcome reporting and (vii) other bias. For each study, risk of 
bias items was judged as unclear when there was either insuf-
ficient information to judge as (low/high risk) or there was no 
related information regarding the risk of bias item in the report 
(further details on risk of bias assessment are presented in online 
supplementary appendix 1).
Data extraction
Using a customised, pretested and piloted data extraction form, 
risk of bias and data extraction for each included trial were 
performed by pairs of reviewers. Differences in quality appraisal 
and extracted data were resolved through discussion between 
pairs of reviewers and where appropriate, the opinion of other 
members of the review team. For each included trial, details were 
extracted on: design, sample size, population characteristics (eg, 
age, diagnosis, duration of heel pain, interventions (professional 
delivering intervention, dose, duration and number of sessions) 
and outcome assessment (type of outcome measure, length of 
follow-up and outcome measurements)). Studies that provided a 
point estimate of the outcome together with a measure of vari-
ability (eg, a mean and SD), were taken forward for analysis. 
Where only sample size, median, range and/or IQR was given, 
methodology from Wan et al21 was used to calculate the sample 
mean and SD. In instances of missing or incomplete data (eg, lack 
of measures of variability for follow-up data), additional infor-
mation was requested and obtained (where possible) through 
contacting primary study authors.
Data synthesis and analysis
All analyses were performed using STATA V
.15.1 (StataCorp, 
Texas, USA), under a frequentist approach, with restricted 
maximum likelihood used to estimate parameters. Prior to 
analyses, extracted data were further checked independently 
for completion and accuracy by the study statistician while 
profiling a database for the analyses. Furthermore, in order 
to define the treatment nodes for the network, two reviewers 
(HBM and ER), a podiatrist and rheumatologist, independently 
reviewed and classified the therapeutic interventions following 
a consensus process. As the objective of this systematic review 
was to compare different treatment options, and not to inves-
tigate the influence of dosage or intensity of interventions, the 
specified core therapeutic interventions (exercise therapy, corti-
costeroid injections, orthoses, NSAIDs, and ESWT), and usual 
care/placebo/sham, were allocated to six distinct nodes. Further-
more, studies involving combination(s) of any of the specified 
core treatments were used in our analyses in addition to the 
six nodes as treatment nodes with combination treatments. For 
example, where trial arms have involved a combination of exer-
cise therapy and a corticosteroid injection as an intervention, 
corticosteroid injection+exercise 
was classed as a distinct treat-
ment node. Also, where RCTs included more than one arm with

the same type of treatment, the data were pooled together (eg, 
for a three-armed trial22 involving a prefabricated orthoses arm, 
and two custom orthoses arms (differentiated by a rigid and soft 
material), an average of the mean outcomes and SD was taken 
from the custom orthoses arms and a sum taken from the arm 
sample sizes, in order to create a single pooled orthoses arm).
In order to obtain direct treatment effect estimates (with a 
95% CI) for each included comparison, pairwise meta-analyses 
were performed. Direct and indirect estimates of effects were 
then analysed together in an NMA.
Network coherence (consistency and heterogeneity)
The important assumption underlying an NMA is that of network 
consistency, that is, true treatment effects are on average the 
same, regardless of whether they are estimated from direct or 
indirect evidence. This was assessed in three ways: (i) using a 
global Wald test (with high p values favouring consistency)23; 
(ii) using a node-splitting technique, which judges the consis-
tency of direct and indirect estimates separately for each treat-
ment comparison (with high p values favouring consistency)24 
and (iii) graphically (as a crude test), by inspection of forest 
plots comparing direct and pooled NMA results. Furthermore, 
the choice of a random or fixed effects model for each analysis 
was based on the magnitude of τ2 (ie, the common between-
study variance across all treatment comparisons). A structured 
between-studies variance-covariance matrix was used, which 
assumes that all treatment comparisons have a common hetero-
geneity variance.
Primary outcomes of pain and function
Primary outcomes of pain and function were classified as: (i) 
short term (1 to ≤6 
weeks post-treatment), (ii) medium term 
(6 to ≤12 
weeks post-treatment) or (iii) long term (>12 
weeks 
post-treatment). For short-term and medium-term outcomes, the

latest outcome data within each time category was used for anal-
ysis. For example, if a study reported 3-week and 6-week pain 
outcomes, only the 6-week data were used. However, because 
the long-term category has no upper bound, a different approach 
was taken to reduce potential heterogeneity in results; we eval-
uated the spread of long-term outcomes and selected the most 
prevalent time point, and only retained data matching this time 
point for analysis. A total of six NMAs were possible (pain or 
function outcomes analysed separately for each time category), 
and a network plot was used to graphically present the direct 
evidence base and assess connectedness of each network.
Assessing comparative effectiveness of treatments
The principal summary measure used for pain and function 
outcomes was the standardised mean difference (SMD). SMDs 
are advantageous in homogenising outcomes from different 
scales and instruments onto a common scale. The direction of 
outcome scales in the raw data were reversed where appropriate 
(by multiplying values by −1), to ensure all outcomes were 
interpreted with lower values indicative of improvements in 
pain or functional disability. Estimates of effects (SMDs) were 
interpreted according to Cohen’s rule of thumb, with values of 
0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 indicative of small, moderate and large effects, 
respectively.25 Direct pairwise (where available) and pooled 
NMA estimates, along with 95% CIs, are reported for all treat-
ment comparisons. SMDs with 95% CIs that did not include the 
null value (of SMD=0, ie, no difference in comparative treat-
ment effect), were classed as statistically significant.
Ranking of treatments
To further assess the comparative effectiveness of treatments, 
the ranking probability distributions of each treatment were 
generated from a simulation of 1000 replications. We used mean 
rank, surface under cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values 
and cumulative ranking plots. These statistics rank treatments 
according to their ability to generate the largest treatment effects 
in each simulation, and are averaged over the 1000 replications.
Sensitivity analysis
To assess the robustness of the findings for pain and functional 
outcomes, sensitivity analysis based on risk of bias was planned 
but not performed. This was due to most studies showing similar 
(unclear) risks of bias. Sensitivity analysis by the removal of 
studies with unclear risk led to insufficient data to support the 
network.

Characteristics of included studies
The literature search yielded 1400 unique citations, of which 
263 full-text articles were selected for full review. The study 
flow chart is presented in figure 1. Of the 263 full-text arti-
cles, 59 met the inclusion criteria and were subjected to quality 
assessment and data extraction. A further 28 articles could not 
be included in the NMA due to: being duplicate reports of the 
same RCT (n=1); examining dose regimen/technique compar-
isons of the same intervention (n=9); examining a similar but 
different treatment to commonly used interventions for PHP

istics of eligible studies that could not be incorporated into the 
meta-analysis are presented in online supplementary appendix 
2,tables 1 and 2.
Thirty-one RCTs involving 2450 participants across 10 
different (combinations of) interventions (ESWT, ESWT+ex-
ercise, ESWT+orthoses, exercise, NSAID injection+exercise, 
oral NSAIDs, orthoses, corticosteroid injection, corticosteroid 
injection+exercise and placebo/sham) provided sufficient data 
for inclusion in the NMA. (online supplementary appendix 
1, table 1) presents the characteristics of the included RCTs. 
RCTs were published between 1999 and 2017. The maximum 
length of follow-up ranged from 4 
weeks to 104 
weeks. Most 
RCTs were from Europe (n=8), followed by Asia (n=6) and 
Australia (n=5). RCTs recruited participants mostly from 
primary care sources and outpatient departments of hospitals 
and rehabilitation centres and investigated a combination of 
participants with duration of PHP symptoms ranging from 10 
to 287 
weeks.
Risk of bias in the evidence base
The risk of bias assessment for the 31 included trials is presented 
in figure 2A and B. All included studies were RCTs; however, 
a significant proportion (35%) did not adequately report how 
randomisation was performed. High risk of bias was consid-
ered present most frequently (in 26% of trials) in relation to 
lack of blinding of participants and personnel. Many of the 
trial outcomes were patient reported but outcome assessment 
procedures were reported as blinded in 45% of the trials. The 
reporting of most of the trials did not provide sufficient infor-
mation to accurately assess concealment of treatment allocation, 
thus generating a large proportion of ‘unclear’ responses (61% 
of trials). Overall, 1422 26–38 of the 31 trials were considered to

≤3/7) classed as low risk.
network coherence (consistency and heterogeneity)
NMA was possible for all (six) connected networks of evidence, 
which investigated pain and function outcomes separately, with 
follow-ups at: (i) short term, (ii) medium term and (iii) long 
term. There were no signs of the consistency assumption being 
violated for any network (where applicable, ie, only considering 
closed-loop networks). Firstly, the global Wald tests for incon-
sistency were not significant (p=0.822, 0.971, and 0.925 for 
short term pain, medium term pain, and short term function, 
respectively). Second, no statistically significant difference was 
observed between direct and indirect estimates when assessed 
separately for each treatment comparison through a node-split-
ting technique (all p values were >0.05). Third, the 95% CIs of 
the network and pairwise meta-analysis summary results over-
lapped for all three closed-loop networks (online supplementary 
figure 1S). The heterogeneity term, τ2, was ‘moderate’ to ‘large’ 
in magnitude (as classed by Cohen’s rule of thumb25) for all of 
the networks except long-term function (online supplementary 
appendix 1, table 2). Hence, random effects analyses were used 
for all but the long-term function network (whereby fixed effects 
analyses were used). Full raw outcome data used (including 
outcome scales) are provided in supplementary appendix 1, 
table 3.
Treatments for PhP: pain outcomes
Evidence base: there were 22 studies22 26–28 30 31 33 37 39–53 (21x 
two-arm, 1×3 
arm) in the short-term pain evidence base, with a 
similar sized network of 23 studies27–32 34 37 39–42 44–47 49–56 (22x 
two-arm, 1×3 
arm) in the medium term pain, and a smaller 
network of 10 studies29 34–38 40 44 45 49 55 (all two-arm) in the 
long-term pain; as presented in figure 3. Eight different treat-
ment nodes were used in the short-term analysis, with these 
same treatments and the addition of a ninth (ESWT+exercise) 
used in the medium term, and eight treatments in the long term. 
Placebo/sham-ESWT comparisons were most prevalent across all 
pain outcome networks (n=6 
studies in short term and medium 
term, n=4 in long term), and the number of participants ranged 
from 31 (NSAID injection+exercise in long term) to 574 (ESWT 
in medium term). Direct evidence was available for 12 out of a 
possible 28 pairwise comparisons in the short term, 12/36 in the 
medium term and 7/28 in the long term. Outcome follow-up 
ranged from 2 to 6 
weeks in the short term (n=1744 
total partic-
ipants used), 2–3 
months in the medium term (n=2018) and was 
fixed at 12 
months for the long term (n=778).
Comparative effectiveness of treatments
Full pairwise and network analyses results for pain are presented 
in table 1. Across both pairwise and network analyses, cortico-
steroid injection demonstrated a statistically significant larger 
reduction in short-term pain over oral NSAIDs (SMD 2.60,

95% 
CI (0.81 to 4.39)); and corticosteroid injection combined 
with exercise showed a statistically significant larger reduction 
in pain compared with exercise alone (SMD 1.20, 95% 
CI (0.14 
to 2.26)). Compared with other treatments, oral NSAIDs were 
most often associated with the least statistically significantly 
reductions in short-term pain (by SMD 2.25, 95% 
CI (0.18 to 
4.33) compared with orthoses, and by SMD 2.61, 95% 
CI (0.13 
to 5.09) compared with corticosteroid injection combined with 
exercise).
Most treatments were not statistically significantly superior to 
one another and underlying estimates of effect presented with 
very wide CIs. For instance, the network comparison of ESWT 
combined with orthoses showed a non-statistically significant 
reduction in medium-term pain compared with ESWT in combi-
nation with exercise (SMD=2.36, 95% 
CI (−2.17 to 6.89)).
With the highest SUCRA values of 79.5 and 74.4, and the best 
mean ranks of 2.4 and 2.8, corticosteroid injection alone and in 
combination with exercise ranked among the three most effective 
treatments for short-term pain, 82.7% and 65.7% of the time, 
respectively (figure 4A, table 2). In contrast, oral NSAIDs (which 
ranked among the three least effective treatments 97.3% of the 
time), exercise alone, and placebo/sham interventions demon-
strated the least comparative effectiveness for pain relief in the 
short term. General trends from the NMA and direct compari-
sons for medium-term pain indicated that ESWT combined with 
orthoses may be more effective than other treatments (highest 
SUCRA value of 80.3; figure 4B, table 2). Oral NSAIDs, exercise 
and exercise combined with ESWT were least likely to have 
beneficial effects for the treatment of pain due to PHP in the 
medium term compared with other treatments. While placebo 
and orthoses appeared least likely to be beneficial for long-term 
pain (85.7% and 81.0% of the time ranking among three least 
effective treatments, respectively; figure 4C, table 2), superiority 
of one treatment over another for the remaining six treatments 
was less clear, with most of these treatments having similar rank-
ings (average SUCRA of 60.8).
Treatments for PhP: function outcomes
Evidence base: for function outcomes, there were fewer RCTs 
available for analysis compared with the pain (14 studies were 
in the network for short-term function,26 30 33 37 39 41–46 48 49 52 53 
11 for medium-term function,30 37 41 42 44–46 49 52 53 55 and 5 for 
long-term function35 37 44 45 49 55; all two-armed), as shown in 
figure 5. Similar treatment nodes were used across the networks, 
with the same six used in short-term and medium-term function 
analyses (ESWT, ESWT+exercise, orthoses, placebo, corticoste-
roid injection with and without exercise), while the long-term 
analysis did not contain corticosteroid without exercise. Placebo/
sham-ESWT comparisons were most common in the short term 
(n=4 
studies) and long term (n=2 
studies), while ESWT/cortico-
steroid injection and corticosteroid injection with exercise/exer-
cise alone comparisons (n=3 
studies) were joint most common 
for medium term. The number of participants ranged from 20

evidence was available for 7 out of a possible 15, 5/15 and 4/10

total participants used), 2.5–3 
months in the 
medium term (n=811) and was fixed at 12 
months for the long 
term (n=312).
Comparative effectiveness of treatments
The comparative effectiveness of treatments (both pairwise and 
network meta-analyses) on function outcomes are presented in 
table 3. As with pain outcomes, most treatments were not signifi-
cantly better than one another in the short term, medium term 
and long term; CIs were often wide. Placebo/sham interventions 
were comparatively worse at improving functional ability than 
other treatments, for example, NMA showed statistically signif-
icant reductions in long-term functional ability (by SMD 0.93, 
95% 
CI (0.23 to 1.63) compared with corticosteroid injection, 
by SMD 1.09, 95% 
CI (0.15 to 2.03) compared with exercise 
and by SMD 0.95, 95% 
CI (0.50 to 1.40) compared with ESWT).
In agreement with the analyses on pain outcome treatment 
effects, placebo/sham interventions ranked least likely to improve 
function for patients with PHP (SUCRA values: 16.9, 28.1 and 
7.3, in the short term, medium term and long term, respec-
tively; figure 6 and table 4), followed by orthoses (SUCRA: 31.8,

respectively), and exercise alone (SUCRA: 32.2 and 29.9 in the 
short term and medium term, respectively). However, exercise 
appeared most likely to improve functional ability for long-term 
function (SUCRA: 82.1); while corticosteroid with and without 
exercise, and ESWT consistently ranked in the top three treat-
ments most likely to improve functional ability.
Comparison of effectiveness of treatments across pain and 
function outcomes
Corticosteroid injection with and without exercise, and ESWT 
interventions appear most likely to have beneficial effects for 
both pain and function outcomes over all time periods (figure 7). 
In contrast, placebo/sham interventions appear least likely to 
improve either pain or function outcomes across all time periods, 
while exercise appears to have a non-beneficial effect for short 
term and medium term, but a beneficial effect for long-term pain 
and function.
summary of findings for RCTs without suitable data for nMA
Findings from 17 RCTs of 7 different comparisons and/or 
treatment combinations, including ESWT versus placebo/sham 
(n=11), exercise versus ESWT (n=1) and custom versus prefab-
ricated orthosis/placebo/sham (n=3), for which suitable data 
could not be obtained are presented in online supplementary 
appendix 2, table 1. For the comparison between ESWT and 
placebo/sham, with an unclear to high risk of bias across trials, 
ESWT is reported to be significantly more effective than sham/
placebo for reducing pain in two out of three trials in the short 
term, and four out of seven in the medium term. There was no 
evidence for the effect of ESWT on function in the short term 
but two trials reported reduction in functional disability in the 
medium term. However, there was uncertainty in evidence across 
trials and time points as shown by very large CIs and inconsis-
tency of the magnitude of effects. For both pain and function 
outcomes and across time points (short term, medium term 
and long term), trials found no difference between custom and 
prefabricated orthoses. All other treatment comparisons/combi-
nations contained only one trial with mostly small sample sizes.
DIsCussIOn
Available evidence does not suggest that any of the commonly 
used treatments for the management of PHP are significantly 
better than any other, although the results of this NMA show 
that corticosteroid injections alone or in combination with exer-
cise are effective treatments for reducing pain and improving 
function in the short term. However, the magnitude of estimate 
of effect varied widely across trials with large CIs. Furthermore, 
the overall effect of corticosteroid injections on PHP is modest, 
and the potential for adverse effects15 57 such as postinjection 
steroid-induced increase in pain, fat pad atrophy, nerve injury 
and rupture of the plantar fascia require careful consideration. 
There was a greater amount of evidence for ESWT, but we found 
no evidence that this treatment confers more beneficial effects 
(compared with the other treatments in this study) for reducing 
pain and improving function among patients with PHP
.
In the network meta-analyses of both pain and function, 
placebo/sham interventions and NSAIDs were generally shown to 
be the least effective treatment options. Considering PHP has long 
been considered to be a self-limiting pain condition, our findings 
indicate that first-line management recommendations of PHP with 
over the counter pain medications, NSAIDs and a watchful waiting 
approach may be suboptimal. Previous literature has suggested that

Review
delaying treatment may worsen prognosis, and potentially create a 
need for further healthcare use.57 The findings of this present study 
support the notion that access to treatments without a period of 
watchful waiting may be beneficial.
As the current NMA is the first to examine the comparative 
effectiveness of the most common treatments for PHP
, it is diffi-
cult to directly compare the findings of the present study with 
those of previous NMAs which examined a limited number of 
treatments,58 or compared dosage/technique for specific treat-
ment options.59 Previous reviews collectively indicate that exer-
cise and foot orthoses are promising interventions for short-term 
and medium-term improvements in pain and function.60 61 In 
this review, exercise as a stand-alone treatment was not found 
to consistently confer beneficial effects in reducing pain and 
improving function for patients with PHP in the short term, but 
a beneficial effect was found for long-term pain and function. 
There is a lack of evidence regarding the most effective exer-
cise dose or delivery method. In this systematic review, included 
RCTs reported varying exercise therapy protocols, dose and 
regime. As with the review by Almubarak and Foster,60 exercise 
as a treatment in this review included stretching and strength-
ening exercise trials; treatment comparisons including exercise 
in combination with other treatments such as corticosteroid 
injection mostly had calf stretching as the ‘exercise’ component. 
These exercises were mostly home based (apart from the first 
session that may be supervised) and were not individualised or 
progressed. Within the networks, foot orthoses (prefabricated 
or custom), were not found to be effective as a stand-alone 
treatment for PHP
, but were mostly effective in combination 
with ESWT. Our findings agree with those of recent systematic 
reviews showing that foot orthoses are better than sham/placebo 
and may be effective for reducing pain in the medium term.13 61
study strengths and limitations
In this study, direct and indirect evidence has been combined 
in order to assess comparative effectiveness of interventions 
that have not yet (or only minimally) been directly compared 
in robust high-quality trials. There was agreement between the 
direct and indirect evidence which achieved consistency for 
specified treatments; however, tests for inconsistency are likely 
to be underpowered, due to lack of data, as evidenced by wide 
95% CIs for SMDs. As an alternative to frequentist methods 
which was used in the current NMA, a Bayesian three-level hier-
archical NMA model may be employed. This approach has been 
shown to increase precision of effect estimates in meta-analysis 
of few trials, or a large number of treatment options which can 
be further subdivided.62 However, this approach was deemed to 
be out of scope for our NMA which mainly focusses on compar-
isons across different treatments. Future NMAs, especially those 
incorporating dose comparisons and procedural variations of the 
same treatment options, would benefit from Bayesian analysis.
The current study is not without limitations and must be 
interpreted with caution. First is the inclusion of only the most 
common treatments as opposed to all available treatments for 
the management of PHP
. This decision was made in order to 
inform choice of treatment in primary care settings where PHP 
patients are mostly seen, and to evaluate interventions that 
are widely available and accessible to patients. Furthermore, 
networks would likely be disconnected when including a large 
number of treatments evaluated in only a small number of trials. 
The sparsity of data did not allow for a statistical exploration of 
publication bias; however, we conducted a comprehensive search 
of published and unpublished literature as well as employed a 
paired screening process to ensure all available evidence was 
identified. However, the findings of this review are still likely to 
be influenced by the small number of trials (mostly with small 
sample sizes) available to support direct and indirect compari-
sons in the network. For instance, many nodes in the networks 
(figure 3 and figure 5), were connected by only a single trial and 
(for some treatments) with few participants.
The loss of data associated with absence of suitable data 
for analysis was a challenge in this review. Related first, and 
more importantly, to the disparate reporting of data in scien-
tific reports in this field, a lot of data from otherwise eligible 
(but excluded trials) could not be analysed mostly due to lack 
of reporting of treatment outcomes with a mean as well as a 
measure of variability. Despite concerted efforts to request this 
additional data from trial authors, the inability of our review to 
incorporate such data into evidence synthesises inadvertently led 
to notable research waste. As a minimum, for all trials in this 
field, reporting an average and a measure of variability (eg, a 
mean and a SD) per trial arm for each follow-up period should 
be required. Furthermore, to avoid substantial heterogeneity, 
data from some trials which used a very different approach to 
measuring outcomes could not be combined in the network. 
However, this problem could be overcome through the devel-
opment of and adherence to an agreed standardised set of core 
outcomes to be used in trials in this field. In order to minimise 
the loss of potentially useful evidence, details of all otherwise 
eligible trials were extracted with a narrative summary of find-
ings presented (online supplementary appendix 2, table 1). 
Generally, the results from these trials were found to be in agree-
ment with the evidence presented in the NMA.
Implications for clinical practice, policy and future research
Within the NMA, control treatments (including placebo/sham 
interventions, watchful waiting approach, over-the-counter pain 
medications)` and NSAIDs generally showed lack of beneficial 
effects for patients with PHP
. For primary care first-point-of-
contact decision-making purposes, our findings suggest that 
access to treatments may be beneficial for patients with PHP
.
However, findings from this review must be interpreted with 
caution due to limitations in quality of the evidence underpin-
ning the analyses. Of particular concern are predominantly 
small sample sizes, low quality reporting of aspects of study 
design (especially concealment of treatment allocation) and 
variability in outcome measures across included studies (online 
supplementary appendix 1, table 3). Furthermore, this review 
cannot comment on evidence for comparative effectiveness of 
treatment options where the influence of duration of symptoms 
prior to treatment may be of concern. This is due to the wide 
variability in the range of duration of symptoms at recruitment 
across studies included in this review and the fact that most trials 
did not report data regarding the duration of symptoms per 
trial arm. Future research involving patients with PHP should 
therefore focus on the design of large trials with head-to-head 
comparisons of active treatments, long-term follow-up and 
higher reporting standards. Furthermore, careful consideration 
of trials investigating the same treatment comparisons (especially 
for the most promising interventions in the short term and long 
term) is an important next step. This will enable exploration of 
the optimal mode of delivery, dosage and intensity of treatments 
required for successful management of PHP
.

Review
What is already known on this topic?
 
► Existing pairwise meta-analyses are limited to comparisons of 
two or three treatment options for plantar heel pain. 
 
► Clinical decision making regarding the best treatment option 
is often difficult. 
What are the new findings?
 
► For the management of plantar heel pain, available evidence 
does not support the superiority of any of the commonly 
available treatments over another. 
 
► However, corticosteroid injections, alone or in combination 
with exercise, and ESWT appear more likely to be effective for 
relieving plantar heel pain and improving function compared 
with other treatments in the short term, medium term and 
long term. 
 
► Control treatments (which include over-the-counter pain 
medications and watchful waiting, as well as placebo 
interventions) generally show less beneficial effects than 
other treatments for patients with plantar heel pain.
 
► The review highlights the need for large high-quality 
randomised controlled trials of the commonly used 
interventions for the management of plantar heel pain.
the management of PHP
. For pain and functional outcomes, most 
treatments were not significantly better than others in the short 
term, medium term and long term. The comparative effectiveness 
of commonly used treatments (ie, exercise therapy, corticosteroid 
injections, orthoses, NSAIDs and ESWT) is limited by large vari-
ation in magnitude and imprecision of effect estimates. Findings 
indicate the need for large, multicentre trials directly comparing 
commonly used treatments for the management of PHP
.
