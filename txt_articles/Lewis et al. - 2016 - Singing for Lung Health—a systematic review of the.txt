There is growing interest in Singing for Lung Health (SLH), an approach where patients with respiratory disease take part in singing
groups, intended to improve their condition. A consensus group was convened in early 2016 to address issues including: the
specific features that make SLH distinct from other forms of participation in singing; the existing evidence base via a systematic
review; gaps in the evidence base including the need to define value-based outcome measures for sustainable commissioning of
SLH; defining the measures needed to evaluate both individuals' responses to SLH and the quality of singing programmes. and core
training, expertise and competencies required by singing group leaders to deliver high-quality programmes. A systematic review to
establish the extent of the evidence base for SLH was undertaken. Electronic databases, including Pubmed, OVID Medline and
Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane central register of controlled trials and PEDro, were used. Six studies were included in the final
review. Quantitative data suggest that singing has the potential to improve health-related quality of life, particularly related to
physical health, and levels of anxiety without causing significant side effects. There is a significant risk of bias in many of the
existing studies with small numbers of subjects overall. Little comparison can be made between studies owing to their
heterogeneity in design. Qualitative data indicate that singing is an enjoyable experience for patients, who consistently report that
it helps them to cope with their condition better. Larger and longer-term trials are needed.

BACKGROUND
Many people with chronic respiratory conditions experience
breathlessness, which is both limiting and distressing, despite
the
availability
of
therapies,
including
smoking
cessation,
pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) and medication.1 Singing for Lung
Health (SLH) also referred to as ‘Singing for Breathing’ has
emerged as a novel approach to address this.2–5 It involves the
delivery of classes led by a singing teacher with relevant skills and
experience. The learning of techniques around breathing control
and posture that are necessary to sing effectively is combined
with a group activity that is perceived as fun and sociable. The
goal of the groups is to become able to produce song, an artistic
objective, but through this process individuals acquire skills to
help
them
to
cope
with
their
lung
condition,
a
health-
improvement objective. This paper includes a systematic review
of evidence of clinical benefit for singing in respiratory disease
followed by a consensus group statement on SLH.
SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW—SINGING AS A
THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH
RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS
A systematic review was required to allow the consensus group to
judge how firmly recommendations around SLH as a clinical
intervention can be made. To the authors’ knowledge, no
systematic review exists investigating singing specifically related
to groups of people with respiratory conditions. The objective of
this systematic review was to address the question ‘Does singing
improve the health of people with respiratory disease?’ by
collating published evidence on singing as a therapy for chronic
respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease
(COPD),
bronchiectasis,
interstitial
lung
disease,
obstructive sleep apnoea or asthma. Types of studies included
randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials and cohort
studies that enrolled adults with an established diagnosis of a
chronic respiratory disease. The review was registered on the
PROSPERO database: CRD42016037705.
Participation in a singing group with the intention of improving
the person’s respiratory condition was compared with standard
care or a control treatment. Outcomes included measures of lung
function, health status, quality of life and functional exercise
capacity. Electronic databases (Pubmed, OVID Medline and
Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane central register of controlled
trials, PEDro) were used to search for the terms ‘singing’ AND
(‘respiratory disease’ OR ‘COPD’ OR ‘asthma’ OR ‘Bronchiectasis’,
OR ‘interstitial lung disease’ OR ‘obstructive sleep apnoea’).
The search was run on 14 April 2016. Limits to the search were
added, including no related terms, only adult population, a time
period of 1980 to current and results obtained with a five-star
rating (results including both ‘singing’ and ‘respiratory disease’ or
specific pathology name). An example of a database search can be
found in Supplementary Appendix SA. Six hundred and nine
results were returned from the above databases. Two further
articles were obtained after reviewing article references and

 contacting authors. Four hundred and nineteen articles remained
following de-duplication across databases. Titles, abstracts and
articles were reviewed by AL. After AL screened the titles and de-
duplicated the results, 22 titles appeared to be of further interest.
Sixteen of these studies were excluded. Studies were excluded if
singing was delivered as part of a PR programme because it would
be difficult to separate the effects of either group intervention.
Others were excluded if they were literature reviews or conference
proceedings only. Details of excluded studies are given in
Supplementary Appendix SB. Primary outcomes included those
measuring health status (36-item short form survey (SF-36), COPD
Assessment Test, St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, Clinical
COPD Questionnaire, Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire,
King’s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire), exercise
capacity (Six Minute Walk Test, Incremental Shuttle Walk Test,
Endurance Shuttle Walk Test) and lung function (forced expiratory
volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), the FEV1 over FVC
ratio (FEV1/FVC), inspiratory capacity, maximal inspiratory pressure,
maximal expiratory pressure). Secondary outcomes included
patient experience. Qualitative data were identified with the
inclusion of verbal or written comments. An assumption was
made that qualitative data collection and analysis was completed
following appropriate qualitative research methodology.
Data extraction from studies included in the final review was
carried out independently by AL on a paper-by-paper basis and
put into a table of results found in Supplementary Appendix SC.
Because of the heterogeneity in outcome measures used across
studies, it was decided to report them narratively. Contact was
made with Rebecca Engen, author of an excluded study, to clarify
subjects' participation in PR during the singing intervention. The
variables for which the data were sought are outlined in Table 1
including characteristics of trial participants, type and description
of intervention and control and type of outcome measures used.
Six studies were included in the review (Table 1); four RCTs2,3,6,7
and two cohort studies.4,8,9 Three of these studies were performed
in the United Kingdom, one in Brazil, one in Canada and one in
Australia. A flow diagram of the results is included in Figure 1.
Assessment of risk of bias was performed at study level using
the Cochrane Collaborative Tool (Table 2). No meta-analysis or
combining results was performed, and no summary measures
were used because of a lack of repeated outcome measures across
all studies.
Randomised controlled trials
Lord et al.2 performed a trial in COPD patients comparing twice
weekly 1 h singing classes (provided by a single teacher) for
6 weeks against usual care. Of the 36 participants enrolled, paired
data were available from 15 singers and 13 controls who
completed the study. Data were analysed on an intention-to-
treat basis. Singing was associated with an improvement in the
SF-36 physical component score (+7.5 (14.6) vs. − 3.8 (8.4) P = 0.02)
and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression anxiety score (−1.1 (2.7)
vs. +0.8 (1.7) P = 0.03). Although these improved results from SLH
are statistically significant, caution is required in interpreting the
clinical significance of the findings owing to the low patient
numbers and the s.d. being greater than the means. There were
no differences in walking distance (+26 (52.6)+11.3 (83.0) P = 0.58).
Interestingly, there was a significant increase in breath hold time
after intervention in the control group (5.3 s (5.7)) compared
with the singers (−0.3 s (6.9)) P = 0.029. The authors argue that
this apparently paradoxical result may have been due to those
in
the
singing
training
group
learning
to
take
a
more
measured inspiration. The breath hold test is anyway more
suitable to evaluate interventions for people with hyperventilation
than COPD.
A second RCT from Lord et al.,3 again in COPD patients,
compared the effect of a longer duration of singing classes, this
time for 8 weeks, with participation in a film study group. The
primary outcome was change in the SF-36. Follow-up data were
available from 13 participants in the singing arm and 11
participants in the film group arm, with attrition of 5 participants
from the singing arm and 3 from the film arm. The mental
component score of the SF-36 improved to a similar extent in both
groups; 9.3 (25.3) vs. 4.3 (9.0) in the singers versus film group
(P = 0.41). However, there was a significantly greater improvement
in the SF-36 physical component score in the singing arm
(12.9 (19.0) vs. − 2.5 (11.9) P = 0.02). There were no statistically
significant differences in exercise capacity or physical activity level
between groups. Interestingly, breath hold time again fell in the
singing group compared with controls though this difference was
not significant (−1.64 (4.1) vs. 2.39 s (7.8) P = 0.14)). The greater
improvement in SF-36 Physical Component Summary scores from
this study compared with the groups previous study may be due
to the longer intervention period. This may suggest that singing
groups for respiratory conditions need to run for at least 8 weeks
and physical health-related quality of life may continue to improve
with longer duration interventions. However, the confidence
intervals of SF-36 Physical Component Summary results in both
studies are wide and therefore further research is required before
reaching this conclusion.
In both these studies, all participants received a single 30-min
session of breathing control instruction from a senior physiothera-
pist as part of the intervention. This education may help define
SLH compared with singing for well-being groups but may be a
confounding factor when interpreting between-group differences.
Bonilha et al.6 performed an RCT in COPD patients comparing
1 h once a week group singing lessons to once a week handicraft
sessions for 24 weeks. The randomisation process is not reported.
Participant attrition from the initial 43 participants randomised left
15 participants in each group at the end of the study. The authors
based their sample size of 15 people in each group on a previous
study, which detected a between-group difference in maximal
respiratory pressures after training in COPD patients. Singing was
well tolerated. Quality of life improvements did not differ between
groups, but patients in the singing group had increased maximal
expiratory pressure 1 week after the final class, whereas this had
fallen in the control arm (+3.0 (17.2) vs. − 11.3 cm H2O P = 0.05).
The authors report a transient increase in inspiratory capacity
measured 2 min after finishing singing in the last session
(0.14 (0.25) vs. − 0.08 (0.18) litre P = 0.01). Singing also improved
oxygen saturations during singing compared with the control
group (1.6 (1.8)% vs. 0 (1.2)% P = 0.01).
Gick and Daugherty7 performed an RCT in a cohort of patients
with a self-reported diagnosis of asthma. Sixty participants
took part for 4 weeks in weekly singing classes, singing classes
with diaphragmatic breathing instruction or just diaphragmatic
breathing instruction classes. They were also encouraged to
practice at home and keep a log of this. The choice of repertoire
for the songs was not specifically targeted to help with asthma
management. Popular songs were chosen by graduates of the
participating university. Partial block randomisation was used
with a block size of three. It is not stated how the randomisation
was performed. Attrition in each group ranged from 25% to 16%
and did not differ significantly. However, more men (40%)
than women (13.3%) dropped out. Following the training,
all
groups
showed
significant
improvements
in
measures,
including peak expiratory flow rate, quality of life, mood and
breathlessness, but the authors report a lack of outcome
differences between the three arms. There was no further analysis
of direct comparison of singing and breathing intervention with
the breathing instruction alone intervention and no usual care
control group.

 Cohort studies
Eley et al.8,9 report two cohort studies including Aboriginal
Australian children and adults with a diagnosis of asthma. Female
participants had singing lessons, whereas males participated in
didgeridoo classes. It was unclear in the study9 which patients in
the second community group were adults as the age range for
females spanned 7–35 years. There were no significant changes in
spirometry values, but peak expiratory flow rate improved. Daily
peak expiratory flow rate values were highly variable with no
significant change across the course of the study. Moreover, the
retention of female adult asthmatics was poor10 and final outcome
data were only available from three participants.
Morrison et al.4 performed a feasibility study to investigate the
potential of establishing a community-based singing programme
for COPD patients.4 Patients were recruited by mailing COPD
registered patients on GP practice databases in East Kent,
by newspaper advertisements and by direct contact with local
patient support groups. One hundred and six patients took part in
weekly 90-min singing sessions over 36 weeks. The St George’s
Respiratory Questionnaire total score improved by 3.3 (6.14–0.45)
points at the end compared with baseline, but there were no
significant changes in Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Score,
SF12 or EQ-5D.
Qualitative studies and data within RCTs and cohort studies
In addition to outcomes from the RCT, Lord et al.2 also reports on
an additional 150 participants in open singing workshops, run in
the same hospital, who completed a questionnaire about the
experience. In all, 96% rated the workshops as ‘very enjoyable’ and
98% thought the workshop had taught them something about
breathing in a different way. Also, 81% of attendees felt a ‘marked
physical difference’ after the workshop.

 increased sense of breath control. Positive impacts on patient’s
posture, walking, ability to control breathlessness during an
exacerbation and housework were reported as a result of doing
singing in the group. The benefits of enjoyment, improved mood
and social contact were also reported.
Participants in the second RCT by Lord et al.3 described benefits
from singing in terms of improvements in knowledge of breath-
ing, improved breathing control and improved ability to do
housework. Others, who had multiple health conditions, reported
that it was difficult to ascertain any physical benefits from singing.
Patients who had participated in the film group reported no
physical benefits from this, although they had enjoyed it. In
Eley et al.,8,9 only one quote could be attributed to an adult
female: ‘it got me out of the house and mixing with other people’.
There
are
insufficient
other
qualitative
data
to

any

from

Participants’
perceptions are reported in detail in Skingley et al.,5 with singers
describing mental and physical benefits, including learning how to
breathe properly, improved posture as well as social benefits,
enjoyment, improved well-being, general physical health and a
desire for the groups to continue.
DISCUSSION
There is a significant risk of multiple forms of bias across the
studies with heterogeneous interventions and a limited number of
participants. Performance bias was the biggest risk of bias in these
studies as blinding participants is not possible. Some studies
lacked information on randomisation procedure and so there was
evidence of selection bias. Other studies included in the review
were not controlled and therefore inherently carry a risk of bias.
Moreover, attrition in the form of participant drop out was evident
across studies. More information is required in the reporting of the
singing exercises and other stages performed within studies to
ascertain a potential therapeutic cause of this improved lung
function measurements. Currently, it is not clear whether, when
and how active abdominal contraction was encouraged during
expirations or whether increased pressures through the hands on
the upper abdomen were used as in active assistive mechanism
(e.g., a manually assistive cough technique) or passive restrictive
mechanism (e.g., a diaphragmatic breathing technique) in the
study by Bonilha et al.,6 for example. Nevertheless, repeated
reporting of improvements in different outcomes across studies
suggests that SLH improves health status in COPD patients in
particular. No significant adverse events or side effects have been
reported. Larger and longer-term studies are needed to quantify
and understand its effects and impact, but participation in SLH has
the potential to improve management of breathlessness and
increase social participation.
There is limited evidence from controlled trials that, to date,
have been small
scale,
involving a total
of 112 patients
(43 completing a singing arm). Findings of note from controlled
trials are an improvement in the SF-36 Physical Component Score,
reduced breath hold time, an acute, transient increase in
inspiratory capacity and improved maximal expiratory pressure.
There are further limitations to existing studies. No long-term
follow-up after intervention is part of the method in any study,
with significant attrition across studies, limiting the conclusions
from the quantitative data in studies published. Singing interven-
tions differ across studies and therefore make it difficult to
ascertain the overall effect of respiratory therapy across the
studies and no meta-analysis could be performed as a result.
Results from outcome measures are not fully reported across
studies
and
power
calculations
for
sample
sizes
are
not
consistently provided. The singing interventions across studies
are heterogeneous and lack detail about the nature of how
singing was delivered as a therapeutic intervention to improve
respiratory disease management or more specifically breath-
lessness. Future studies with larger sample sizes are required to
confirm these findings. There are no trials available to ascertain
the
clinical
importance
of
singing
for
adults
who
have
bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease or obstructive sleep
apnoea. Furthermore, no data were available across studies on
patient health-care utilization, such as exacerbation rates and
admissions. These outcomes may be important to investigate in
the future in order for commissioners to better judge the value of
singing as an intervention compared with other therapies. Only
scientific databases were used in the literature search and no
performance or arts databases were used. Publication bias may be
present in this review as the authors did not review unpublished
studies or reports of results.
This systematic review demonstrates that there is considerable
qualitative data to support participation in singing groups as a
safe and potentially valuable strategy for people with COPD.
CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON SLH
Introduction
Most cultures incorporate public singing as a social activity and it
is part of most people’s experience, certainly in childhood. Adult
participation rates are lower and inversely associated with level of
deprivation.11 Healthy people who take part in singing report
benefits in terms of both social interaction and well-being.12
Observational studies have found that singing is generally
experienced as enjoyable and helpful by respiratory patients.2,10
This is supported by the findings of small RCTs,2,3,6,7 suggesting
that it can lead to improvements in health status. The majority of
participants so far have had COPD or asthma. This has resulted in
considerable interest, with numerous singing groups for people
with lung disease now established across the United Kingdom.
At present, participation in many of the groups is supported by
The British Lung Foundation or through other charitable funding
Table 3.
Consensus statements—Singing for Lung Health
i)
Singing for Lung Health has the potential to deliver health, psychological and social benefits to people with long-term respiratory conditions.
ii)
Qualitative data from studies of Singing for Lung Health have been strongly positive.
iii)
Results of small randomised trials suggest Singing for Lung Health improves quality-of-life measures, but evidence for change in functional
and health economic outcomes is so far lacking.
iv)
A distinction should be drawn between Singing for Lung Health and more generic community singing approaches, although the latter may
also be valuable for participants.
v)
There is a need to define and standardise competences and training pathways for leaders of the Singing for Lung Health groups.
vi)
Appropriate outcome measures for the Singing for Lung Health groups are needed to feedback to patients and group facilitators. The simple,
patient-reported outcome measure, the COPD assessment test (CAT) score, is a strong candidate measure both as feedback to patients and to
ensure that the group is functioning effectively.
vii) Robustly designed and powered trials, of adequate duration, which address patient relevant outcomes are needed before Singing for Lung
Health can be adopted as an intervention to be offered routinely to people with respiratory disease.

 or by participants themselves rather than by commissioners of
health or social care. A handful of groups have received some
public health funding.
Given this rapidly changing landscape, a consensus group,
involving the British Lung Foundation, health professionals
(physiotherapy,
nursing,
health
psychology,
music
therapy,
respiratory physician) and arts practitioners with an interest in
this area, was convened at Royal Brompton Hospital. The purpose
of this group was to review the available evidence, identify
outstanding issues around the role and delivery of SLH and
consider solutions (see Table 3).
DEFINING ‘SINGING FOR LUNG HEALTH’
Singing is a complex activity, involving not only postural and
breathing support but also phonation at the vocal fold level and
resonation involving the movement of the tongue, soft palate and
larynx. In addition, it requires adjustment of pitch and negotiating
both range and volume while learning melodies ‘by ear’. SLH can
be distinguished from participation in more generic singing
activities by its focus on improving breath control and posture in
relation to respiratory disease, using songs as tools for this
purpose. These take precedence over the quality of singing
produced and preparation for public performance, although
efforts to improve the quality of singing provide an important
impetus for ongoing participation. SLH groups include specific
components around posture and breath control tailored to lung
disease, in particular airflow obstruction. Cough is a common
feature of respiratory disease and may limit participation in a
conventional choir, whereas SLH groups represent a more tolerant
environment.
A typical 60-min class would include physical warm-ups,
breathing exercises, vocal warm ups, songs and a cool down as
outlined in Table 4.
BY WHAT MECHANISMS CAN SLH BE BENEFICIAL?
The benefits of singing can be considered in three broad
categories—physical, psychological and social—though these
necessarily overlap and interact. Although breathing patterns are
to an extent determined, or at least limited, by pathophysiological
processes
such
as
airflow
obstruction
and
abnormal
lung
compliance, breathing pattern can be modified by conscious
attention or training to influence use of inspiratory and expiratory
muscles.13 For example, skills acquired during singing may help to
avoid the rapid ‘breath-stacking’ pattern of breathing in COPD,
where dynamic hyperinflation reduces inspiratory reserve volume
and worsens breathlessness. Inspiratory capacity manoeuvres6
and chest wall kinematics confirm that singing lowers end-
expiratory lung volumes in COPD.14
There is an established repertoire of physiotherapy techniques
for helping to manage breathlessness in patients with COPD,
including postural modification, breathing control, pursed lips
breathing and ‘blow as you go’.15 These improve respiratory
muscle and/or lung and airway mechanics, prolonging expiratory
time, allowing a reduction in operating lung volumes. Controlling
expiration through singing techniques may have analogous
effects, being useful when managing and recovering from
episodes of extreme breathlessness. Singing may also enhance
sputum clearance as both dynamic lung volume and airflow
are increased, features present in conventional physiotherapy
techniques.15
A growing body of research demonstrates that COPD is affected
by a range of behavioural and psychological pathways and is
associated with high levels of psychological distress for example,
anxiety and depression, which is often undetected and negatively
impacts on health. Through complex pathways and interactions,
psychological factors have been demonstrated to impact on:
neurobiological
perception
of
breathlessness
and
reduced
dyspnoea thresholds16; reduced self-management behaviours,
for
example,
medication/exercise/smoking
adherence
and
management of exacerbations; progressive avoidance of activities,
social withdrawal and social isolation; reduced quality of life; and
overall worsening course of disease.17,18 SLH can positively
influence a number of these pathways and thereby potentially
contribute to improvements in physical and psychological health,
social well-being and overall quality of life.
In particular, patients with respiratory disease usually experi-
ence their breathing in a negative way, as something which limits
them. Singing, by allowing conscious attention to breathing in a
context associated with the positive achievement of song, may
help to reduce this negative association. Singing is an activity that
a respiratory patient can do well, receiving well-earned praise and
thus boosting self-esteem. Participation in a group activity with
other people with a lung disease facilitates modelling of effective
self-management behaviours, the exchange of information and
the creation of networks of support.19 Participation itself may
improve physical activity levels, which are known to be reduced
even in people with early COPD.20
Isolation has a negative impact on health in general and those
with a long-term condition in particular. It leads to low mood and
an
increasing

Components of a Singing for Lung Health class
Physical warm up using relevant stretches and simple exercises as well as using action songs and body percussion.
Breathing exercises focussing on awareness of supporting musculature during inhalation and exhalation. Groups with a predominance of COPD
patients include exercises to prolong exhalation.
Introducing unvoiced (fff, sss) and voiced (vvv, zzz) fricatives to introduce vocal fold closure and to begin to move from passive to voiced exhale.
Introducing ‘primal sounds’ (see ‘Singing and teaching singing’ by Janice L Chapman28) such as Hey, Ho, Ha, etc., to engage vocal mechanism and
support.
Introducing a range of vocal sounds to warm up the voice, alternating different vocal qualities, range, dynamics, timbre, pitch and rhythm. These
are taught in a call-and-response style to encourage an unselfconscious vocal release prior to singing songs.
Introducing a variety of more formal singing exercises to set patterns such as the first five notes of a major scale or arpeggio to start to integrate
melodic patterns with the length of exhalation (e.g., the ‘Singing for Breathing’ CD, see below).
Choice from a balanced repertoire of appropriate songs that are ‘fit for purpose’ in terms of phrase lengths, breath points, lyrics, melodic challenge
and range. Mixed genre, they need ideally to have a degree of difficulty with a balance between short and long phrases, range and tempo. Songs
should be taught by ear in a call-and-response style, building up lyrics, melody and phrases, so all can join in. There should be a balance between
sitting and standing and between using song sheets (not notation) and learning by ear.
A cool-down, guided relaxation focussing on body and breath awareness can be included as appropriate.
Practicing singing and exercises at home with a CD or tools to practice breath control such as blowing soap bubbles.
Examples of practice exercises can be found on the ‘Singing for Breathing’ CD (available from http://www.rbht.nhs.uk/about/arts/whats-on/singing-
for-breathing/).

 management and has physiological effects on health.21 Moreover,
social interaction acts positively in terms of influencing well-being
and living successfully with a long-term condition.22 Singing may
usefully contribute to reducing social isolation—a major problem
in respiratory disease, particularly in those who are older and from
a disadvantaged background.23,24
SLH AND PR
PR, a programme of supervised exercise education and support for
self-management, has a grade A evidence base and should be
offered to all patients who are limited by chronic respiratory
disease,25 positioned as it is near the base of the Pyramid of Value
for COPD interventions, based on its favourable cost per quality
adjusted life year compared with pharmacotherapy.26 The concept
and practice of PR and SLH overlap to an extent. Both are group
activities, both include the practice and mastery of a physical
activity, breathing control and relaxation and both have a holistic
element.
Given PR’s powerful evidence base, it would be inappropriate to
recommend
SLH
as
an
alternative
to
PR;
however,
some
individuals may choose to take part in the former initially and
this might make them more receptive to taking part in PR
subsequently. One possibility, where SLH is available, is to hold a
taster session for singing during a PR education session and
participants who are interested may wish to take part in further
sessions. The recent RCP PR audit has highlighted the need for
signposting to activities beyond PR to help to sustain the benefits
of participation, and SLH may fulfil this role. However, there is
currently insufficient evidence to make any recommendation that
SLH should be provided.27
ON WHAT BASIS SHOULD SLH GROUPS BE SUPPORTED?
At present, most groups are dependent on charitable support or
are self-funded by participants. The British Lung Foundation
currently runs a programme that involves training singing
teachers and establishing classes throughout the United Kingdom.
This approach has allowed an expansion of singing groups to
occur, but if SLH were to be delivered sustainably at scale, health
and social-care commissioners would need to support and
commission ongoing provision. They will be reluctant to do this
in the absence of convincing evidence for benefit, given
competing demands for limited resources. For singing classes to
become widely accessible to patients with lung disease, the
evidence base will therefore need to be robust and be of sufficient
quality for it to be included in clinical guidelines. This is not the
case at present. The present ad hoc approach is likely to be a
source of inequality as many COPD patients, a group that is
socioeconomically disadvantaged and might be most likely to
benefit, are less likely to have access.
DELIVERY OF SLH
Key to an effective singing group is a leader with the appropriate
training, skills and competencies to support participants. As a
recently developed therapy for respiratory disease, singing for
breathing
does
not
as
yet
have
any
accredited
training
programme for group leaders. Competencies, standard operating
procedures or protocols will need to be developed.
In addition, singing leaders, who are not themselves health
professionals, will benefit from a network of peer support and the
ability on occasion to access expert advice and information about
the respiratory conditions that affect the group members. Care will
be needed to ensure that language is mutually understood. For
example, the phrase ‘diaphragmatic breathing’ has a legitimate
technical meaning in the context of singing that needs to be
recognised, distinct from the scientific fact that the diaphragm is
always active during inspiration.
In PR, a short, intense programme produces an improvement in
exercise capacity and self-efficacy. It is hoped that this will
translate into improved physical activity levels and, in particular,
an ability to take part in maintenance exercises classes, not
necessarily delivered by a health professional. Likewise, indefinite
participation in an SLH programme, while possibly desirable for an
individual, may not be sustainable. A structure where people, once
they have acquired skills from a more intense time limited
programme, can then take part in a less intensely supported
group may be an effective approach. For some, graduating to
participation in a conventional choir could be an option, though
practical issues such as coughing may limit this.
OUTSTANDING RESEARCH QUESTIONS AROUND SLH
The consensus group concluded that larger trials are needed to
establish the impact of SLH on patient relevant outcomes—
physical and psychological health status, exercise capacity and
health resource utilisation. To date, studies have been small and
short term or uncontrolled.
Further research questions include:
i Which aspects of singing training are most important for an
effective programme which is attractive to patients?
ii What are the objective physiological changes in people who
participate in singing?
iii What
value-based
outcome
measures
are
required
to
demonstrate the impact of SLH programmes on patients’
physiological, psychological and social well-being, over a
sufficient duration of follow up, necessary to persuade
commissioners to provide sustainable funding for this
intervention?
iv What impact does SLH have on health resource utilisation?
v What is the most effective way to train and support singing
group leaders?
vi What is the best way to integrate singing programmes into
PR and other aspects of integrated health care?
vii What is the optimal duration and capacity of singing classes?
Conclusion
There has been a rapid spread of singing groups across the United
Kingdom. SLH has the potential to have a positive impact on the
lives of people with lung disease, improving health status
and social participation. Although early research has been
encouraging, studies that are of adequate scale and duration
are urgently needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this
intervention, before it can be recommended in clinical guidelines
and satisfying criteria for funding by commissioners of health and
social care.
