Abstract
Background: Malnutrition in critically ill adults in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with a significantly
elevated risk of mortality. Adequate nutrition therapy is crucial to optimise outcomes. Currently, there is a paucity of
such data in Latin America. Our aims were to characterise current clinical nutrition practices in the ICU setting in
Latin America and evaluate whether current practices meet caloric and protein requirements in critically ill patients
receiving nutrition therapy.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, retrospective, observational study in eight Latin American countries
(Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, and Peru). Eligible patients were critically ill adults
hospitalised in the ICU and receiving enteral nutrition (EN) and/or parenteral nutrition (PN) on the Screening Day
and the previous day (day −1). Caloric and protein balance on day –1, nutritional status, and prescribed nutrition
therapy were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors
of reaching daily caloric and protein targets.
Results: The analysis included 1053 patients from 116 hospitals. Evaluation of nutritional status showed that
74.1% of patients had suspected/moderate or severe malnutrition according to the Subjective Global Assessment.
Prescribed nutrition therapy included EN alone (79.9%), PN alone (9.4%), and EN + PN (10.7%). Caloric intake
met >90% of the daily target in 59.7% of patients on day –1; a caloric deficit was present in 40.3%, with a mean
(±SD) daily caloric deficit of –688.8 ± 455.2 kcal. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that combined
administration of EN + PN was associated with a statistically significant increase in the probability of meeting >90%
of daily caloric and protein targets compared with EN alone (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–2.39;
p = 0.038).
Conclusions: In the ICU setting in Latin America, malnutrition was highly prevalent and caloric intake failed to
meet targeted energy delivery in 40% of critically ill adults receiving nutrition therapy. Supplemental administration
of PN was associated with improved energy and protein delivery; however, PN use was low. Collectively, these
findings suggest an opportunity for more effective utilisation of supplemental PN in critically ill adults who fail to
receive adequate nutrition from EN alone.

 Background
Disease-related malnutrition in hospitalised patients is a
highly prevalent but frequently under-recognised condition
and a major public health problem [1]. Poor nutritional
status is associated with significant clinical and economic
consequences, including increased risk of infectious and
non-infectious complications, prolonged duration of stay
in the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU), more fre-
quent readmission, and increased mortality [2–10]. This is
especially true in critically ill patients, as the catabolic state
induced by the systemic inflammatory response to critical
illness or trauma markedly increases metabolic demands,
thereby accelerating the development of malnutrition and
further increasing the risk of infectious complications,
multi-organ dysfunction, and mortality [11, 12].
Providing adequate nutrition is an integral part of the
treatment of critically ill patients [11, 12]. Evidence sug-
gests it can attenuate the metabolic response to stress,
prevent
cellular
injury,
and
promote
a
favourable
immune response [11]. Studies in medical and surgical
intensive
care
populations
have
demonstrated
that
adequate nutrition therapy is associated with a decrease
in infectious morbidity [13, 14], length of hospital stay
[13–15], and mortality [15, 16]. Current clinical practice
guidelines for the nutritional management of critically ill
patients differ with respect to the use and timing of initi-
ating parenteral nutrition (PN) as well as the optimal
daily caloric and protein intake. The European and
North American guidelines advocate early enteral nutri-
tion (EN) in critically ill patients who are unable to
maintain oral intake [11, 12, 17]. The European Society
for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guide-
lines further recommend early initiation of PN in all pa-
tients for whom EN is contraindicated or not tolerated
[12], while the American Society for Parenteral and
Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) guidelines recommend
early use of PN in patients with evidence of malnutrition
on admission when EN is not feasible [11, 17]. Both the
ESPEN and A.S.P.E.N. guidelines recommend the use of
supplemental PN in patients who are unable to meet the
targeted energy and protein intake via the enteral route.
The ESPEN guidelines recommend initiating supple-
mental PN in patients who fail to reach the targeted in-
take by day 3, while the A.S.P.E.N. guidelines indicate
supplemental PN should be considered after 7–10 days
in patients who are unable to meet >60% of energy and
protein requirements [11, 12]. Recently published clin-
ical practice guidelines from the European Society of
Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) advocate the use of
early enteral nutrition in the majority of critically ill pa-
tients and identify specific clinical circumstances when
EN should be delayed; however, the nutritional manage-
ment of patients for whom EN is insufficient or contra-
indicated is not specifically addressed [18].
A recent prospective observational study evaluating
the nutritional status of 185 critically ill patients admit-
ted to the ICU in a Brazilian hospital reported an overall
prevalence of malnutrition of 54.5%. The prevalence was
even higher (70.3%) among patients who were hospita-
lised more than 48 hours before admission to the ICU
[19]. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis
showed a twofold increase in the risk of readmission to
the ICU and an eightfold increase in the risk of death
among patients who were malnourished compared with
well-nourished patients. These findings underscore the
need for the development of evidence-based clinical nu-
trition practices aimed at the proactive identification of
nutritional needs and the optimal nutritional manage-
ment of critically ill patients. To gain insights that will
inform subsequent recommendations, we conducted a
multinational observational study (“Screening Day Latin
America”) to characterise current clinical nutrition prac-
tices in the intensive care setting in Latin America and
evaluate the degree to which current practices meet the
daily caloric requirements in critically ill patients receiv-
ing EN and/or PN.
Methods
Study design
The Screening Day study was a multinational, cross-
sectional, retrospective observational study evaluating
clinical nutrition practices in critically ill adults in the
intensive care setting in eight Latin American countries
(Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico,
Panama, and Peru). The observation period was defined
as the period from the Screening Day (day 0) up to a
maximum of 5 days in the ICU before the Screening
Day (day −5) (Fig. 1). Demographic and clinical charac-
teristics, nutritional status, nutrition-related risk, type
and volume of nutrition therapy, and daily caloric and
protein balance during the observation period were
assessed by investigators on the Screening Day.
The study protocol was approved by the local ethics
committee or institutional review board at each partici-
pating institution. Where required by local regulations
or ethics committee policy, written informed consent
was obtained from each patient or family member before
enrollment. The study was funded and organised by
Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homberg,
Germany. Statistical analysis was performed by IMS
Health S.A., Madrid, Spain.
Study population
Eligible patients were critically ill adults (age ≥18 years)
who were hospitalised in the ICU and received EN and/
or PN on both the Screening Day (day 0) and the
previous day (day −1). For the purpose of eligibility, a
critically ill patient was defined as a patient with at least
Vallejo et al. Critical Care  (2017) 21:227

 one organ failure; critically ill burn patients and patients
admitted to the ICU for surveillance only were excluded
from enrollment.
Measurements and outcomes
The primary study outcome was the daily caloric balance
on day −1. The daily caloric balance was calculated as
the difference between the daily caloric target and the
daily calories provided by EN and/or PN. The daily cal-
oric target was derived by the clinician using one of four
methods: calculation using a predictive equation (Harris-
Benedict equation), estimation (total daily caloric re-
quirement as estimated by the physician), standard for-
mula (standardised daily target per kilogram actual body
weight), or indirect calorimetry. Additionally, a sensitiv-
ity analysis of the primary outcome was performed using
a standard formula to calculate the daily caloric target
for each patient (20 kcal/kg actual body weight on the
Screening Day for those on the first 6 days in the ICU
and 25 kcal/kg actual body weight on the Screening Day
for those in the ICU after day 6). For obese patients
(BMI ≥30 kg/m2), the caloric target was calculated based
on ideal body weight, as determined by height using the
formula by Hamwi [20].
Secondary outcomes included the cumulative caloric
balance during the observation period (days −5 to −1),
daily protein balance on day –1, cumulative protein bal-
ance (days –5 to –1), patient nutritional status and
nutrition-related risk (day 0), and use of EN and PN dur-
ing the 5-day observation period. Daily protein balance
was calculated as the difference between the clinician-
derived daily protein target and the daily protein intake.
In contrast to the caloric balance, sensitivity analysis
based on a standard equation was not performed, as the
defined protein target must be adapted based on certain
clinical conditions (e.g. renal and hepatic insufficiency).
Cumulative caloric balance and cumulative protein bal-
ance were defined as the sum of the mean daily balance
for all days from day −5, calculated for each day from
day −5 to day −1 (e.g. the cumulative balance on day −3
was calculated as the sum of the mean daily balance on
days −5, −4, and −3). Patient nutritional status was de-
termined according to the Subjective Global Assessment
(SGA) questionnaire and the ESPEN malnutrition score;
nutrition-related risk was determined based on the
Nutrition Risk in the Critically Ill (NUTRIC) score
(Additional file 1: Appendices A–C) [21–25]. For the
latter, the score was calculated based on data in the
patients’ medical file collected at the time of ICU
admission. Physical exams, patient interviews, and chart
reviews were performed by the investigators on the
Screening Day. If a patient was unable to participate in
the interview, the patient’s relative was interviewed to
obtain the requisite information.
Hospital characteristics, including the number of beds
in the hospital and ICU, the type and volume of nutri-
tion therapies prescribed, the availability of a nutrition
therapy team, and institutional nutrition management
policies and practices were recorded by the investigator
at each participating institution using an electronic case
report form.
Statistical methods
The analysis population was defined according to the
per protocol principle and included all patients with
complete data for the protocol-defined mandatory vari-
ables and without a protocol violation (e.g. failure to
meet all eligibility criteria). Data are summarised de-
scriptively using number and percentage for categorical
variables and mean ± standard deviation (SD) as well as
median for continuous variables. The primary outcome
is presented both as a continuous variable using the
mean (SD) difference between the daily caloric target
and the daily caloric intake and as a categorical variable
using the number and percentage of patients in each of
the following categories: meets >90% of daily target and

 caloric deficit (≤90% of daily target). The primary out-
come was also analysed in subpopulations defined ac-
cording to the following parameters: sex, nutritional
status, type of nutritional therapy, reason for admission
to the ICU, duration of stay in the ICU before the
Screening Day, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation (APACHE) II score, and Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score.
Univariable
and
multivariable
logistic
regression
models were used to explore the relationship between
the daily caloric and protein balance on day −1 and se-
lected hospital and patient characteristics. All variables
with a p value ≤0.20 in the unadjusted univariable ana-
lysis were included in the multivariable analysis. Final
model specification was based on a backward step-wise
elimination of variables with a p value >0.05. Results are
reported as the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confi-
dence interval (95% CI) for each variable. All analyses
were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1 running
SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Sample size calculations were based on an estimated
prevalence
of
disease-related
malnutrition
of
50%,
derived from the results of prior multinational epidemio-
logical studies in Latin America [9, 26]. It was deter-
mined that a sample size of 2000 patients would provide
a confidence interval with a precision of ± 2.2%.
Results
A total of 1053 patients in 116 hospitals in eight Latin
American countries met the criteria for eligibility and con-
sented to participate in the study (Table 1). The majority
of participating institutions were academic/university hos-
pitals (94 [81.0%]) providing tertiary care services (93
[80.2%]). A total of 46 (39.7%) hospitals reported having a
nutrition therapy team in the ICU; of these, 36 (78.3%)
were academic/university hospitals (hospital characteris-
tics are summarised in Additional file 1: Appendix D).
Patient characteristics are summarised in Table 2. The
mean (±SD) age was 58.6 ± 19.0 years and the mean dur-
ation of ICU stay on the Screening Day was 27.6 ± 62.2 days.
The most common primary reasons for admission to the
ICU were respiratory illness (315 [30.0%]), neurologic ill-
ness (234 [22.3%]), sepsis (210 [20.0%]), and trauma (102
[9.7%]). Approximately half of the patients (47.3%) were
classified as surgical patients. Invasive respiratory support
was required in 799 (75.9%) patients. A total of 841 (79.9%)
patients received EN only, 113 (10.7%) received both EN
and PN, and 99 (9.4%) received PN only.
Daily caloric balance
Clinician-derived daily energy requirements were estab-
lished for 800 (76%) patients using one of the following
methods:
estimation
(44.1%),
predictive
equation
(31.3%), standardised formula (23.4%), or indirect calor-
imetry (1.3%). In 253 (24%) patients, no clinician-derived
energy target was given. In these patients, a daily caloric
target of 20 kcal/kg actual body weight (25 kcal/kg for
patients with ≥6 days in the ICU) was assigned.
The mean daily caloric balance on day –1 is presented
in Table 3. Categorical analysis of daily caloric balance
on day –1 showed that caloric intake met >90% of the
daily target in 628 (59.7%) patients and resulted in a cal-
oric deficit in 424 (40.3%) patients (Fig. 2). Among those
who did not reach the caloric target, the mean caloric
deficit on day –1 was –688.8 ± 455.2 kcal (–10.8 ±
7.0 kcal/kg). Sensitivity analysis using a standardised
daily caloric target of 20 kcal/kg actual body weight
(25 kcal/kg for patients with ≥ 6 days in the ICU) yielded
similar results; caloric intake met >90% of the standar-
dised daily caloric target in 607 (60.3%) patients and re-
sulted in a caloric deficit in 399 (39.7%) patients. The
mean caloric deficit among patients who failed to meet
the standardised daily caloric target on day –1 was –
640.3 ± 373.2 kcal (–9.5 ± 5.1 kcal/kg).
Assessment of daily caloric balance according to the
prescribed route of nutrition support showed that the
proportion of patients with a caloric deficit was higher
among those who received EN alone (42.4%) compared
with either PN alone (36.4%) or a combination of EN
and PN (28.3%) (Fig. 3).
Subgroup
analysis
according
to
nutritional
status
showed a lower incidence of caloric deficit on day –1 in
patients who were classified as malnourished compared
with those who were classified as well-nourished. Caloric
deficits were observed in 29.5% and 43.1% of patients
classified as malnourished and well-nourished, respect-
ively, according to the ESPEN malnutrition score. Simi-
larly, 36.7% of patients with suspected or moderate
malnutrition according to the SGA had a caloric deficit
on day –1, compared with 41.6% of patients with severe
malnutrition and 47.3% of those who were well nour-
ished. Assessment of daily caloric balance on day –1 ac-
cording to the NUTRIC score, which measures the risk
of death if not adequately fed, showed no meaningful
differences between patients with a score indicating a

 high nutrition-related risk and those with a score
indicating a low risk.
Secondary outcomes
Analysis of cumulative caloric balance from day –5 to
day –1 showed a mean cumulative caloric deficit of –
768.9 ± 2768.7 kcal (–11.1 ± 44.8 kcal/kg). Caloric intake
during the 5-day observation period met >90% of the
clinician-derived cumulative target in 60.1% of patients
and failed to meet the cumulative caloric goal in 39.9%.
Among the latter, caloric deficits accumulated rapidly,
reaching a mean deficit of –3225 ± 2103 kcal (–50.6 ±
33.1 kcal/kg) for the period from day –5 to day –1 (Fig. 4).
Protein intake on day –1 met >90% of the daily target
in 52.4% of patients and failed to reach the daily target
in 47.6%. The mean daily protein deficit on day –1
among patients for whom protein intake failed to meet
the daily target was –42.2 ± 28.2 g (–0.7 ± 0.4 g/kg).
Evaluation of the cumulative protein balance during the
5-day observation period showed that protein intake
met >90% of the cumulative target in 53.9% of patients
and failed to meet the cumulative target in 46.1%. The
overall mean cumulative protein deficit for the period from
day –5 to day –1 was –36.2 ± 216.5 g (–0.5 ± 3.4 g/kg). In
patients who failed to meet the cumulative protein target,
the mean cumulative protein deficit for the corresponding
period was –175.7 ± 121.0 g (–2.7 ± 1.8 g/kg) (Fig. 5).
Assessment of daily protein balance according to the pre-
scribed route of nutrition support showed that the propor-
tion of patients with a protein deficit was higher among
those who received EN alone (50.3%) compared with either
PN alone (37.4%) or a combination of EN and PN (36.2%).
Univariable (unadjusted) logistic regression analyses
identified potential associations between attainment of
daily caloric and protein targets on day –1 and various
hospital and patient characteristics (Additional file 1:

 are presented in Table 4. After adjustment for model co-
variates, the following variables were associated with a
statistically significant increase in the probability of
meeting >90% of the daily caloric target: female sex,
BMI <18.5 kg/m2, suspected or moderate malnutrition
according to the SGA, SOFA score ≥10, and combined
administration of EN and PN. Variables associated with
an increased probability of meeting >90% of the daily
protein target included suspected or moderate malnutrition
according to the SGA, administration of PN, and a duration
of stay in the ICU before the Screening Day >10 days. The
probability of meeting both the daily caloric target and the
daily protein target was significantly increased among pa-
tients who received a combination of EN and PN as well as
those with a >10-day duration of stay in the ICU before the
Screening Day. Conversely, a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 was associ-
ated with a significantly lower probability of meeting either
the daily caloric target or the daily protein target.
Patient nutritional status and nutrition-related risk on
day 0 are summarised in Table 5. Assessment of nutritional
status using the SGA showed that 74.1% of patients were
moderately to severely malnourished on the Screening Day.
The ESPEN malnutrition score suggested the presence of
malnutrition in 13.9% of patients. The NUTRIC score
indicated a high need for nutritional therapy in 39.2%.
More than 90% of patients received EN during the
observation period; of these, 88.2% received EN alone and
11.8% received EN in combination with PN. Intestinal fail-
ure precluded initiation of EN in 17.7% of all patients and
intolerance to EN was observed in 18.7%. Diarrhoea, high
gastric residual volume, and abdominal distention were
the most commonly reported causes of intolerance to EN.
Nutrition therapy was interrupted during the 5-day
observation period in 25.7% of patients; the most common
reasons
for
interruption
were
intolerance
(43.1%),
diagnostic procedures (32.2%), and surgery (27.8%).
Discussion
The present study represents the first large multinational
study evaluating nutrition practices and in adult critically
ill ICU patients in Latin America. Analysis of data from
1053 patients in 116 hospitals in eight Latin American
countries yielded several observations with important im-
plications for the development of improved nutrition
practices in patients with critical illness.
First, malnutrition is highly prevalent in critically ill
adult patients in Latin America. More than 70% of all
patients had moderate or severe malnutrition according
to the SGA and nearly 40% had an increased risk of poor
clinical outcomes according to the NUTRIC score. The
ESPEN malnutrition score suggested the presence of
malnutrition in only 13.9%. To our knowledge, the
current study is the first to apply the ESPEN diagnostic
criteria to patients with critical illness. The observed
difference in the proportion of patients classified as
malnourished according to the SGA and the ESPEN cri-
teria is likely attributable to the fact that the ESPEN def-
inition does not account for the influence of disease
severity or the increased metabolic demands in critically
ill patients. The proportion of patients who were mal-
nourished according to the SGA is consistent with a
Brazilian study in which the reported prevalence of
malnutrition among ICU patients with a duration of
hospitalisation >48 hours was 70.3% [19]. In that study,
malnourished patients had a significantly higher rate of
readmission to the ICU (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.08–4.80)
and a markedly increased risk of mortality compared
with well-nourished patients (OR 8.12; CI 2.94–22.42).
Coupled with these findings, the observed prevalence of
malnutrition in the present study underscores the need
for
adequate
nutritional
screening
and
assessment,
prompt intervention, and rigorous monitoring of nutri-
tional status in this high-risk population.
Second, caloric intake failed to meet the established
daily target in 40% of patients on day –1, and a similar
proportion of patients failed to achieve the caloric target
during the 5-day observation period. Moreover, caloric
deficits accumulated rapidly in these patients, resulting
in a mean caloric deficit of –3225 kcal between day –5
and day –1. This latter finding is particularly alarming,
as caloric deficits in critically ill patients are associated
with poor clinical outcomes, including infectious com-
plications, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation,
and increased mortality [14, 27, 28]. Importantly, emer-
ging evidence suggests that low but adequate caloric in-
take during the first few days following ICU admission
may confer benefits to critically ill patients, particularly

 when coupled with increased protein intake [11, 12]. Of
note, sensitivity analysis of caloric balance using a caloric
target of 20 kcal/kg/d for the first 6 days in the ICU and
25 kcal/kg/d thereafter showed no meaningful difference in
the observed proportion of patients with a caloric deficit.
Third, while more than 90% of patients received EN,
PN use was low. Fewer than one in ten patients received
PN alone and slightly more than 10% received a combin-
ation of EN and PN. This finding is consistent with the
recent Nutrition Day ICU survey in which 10% and 12%
of patients received PN and combined EN and PN,
respectively [29]. In contrast to the limited use of PN
observed during the present study, the clinical character-
istics of the population suggested a need for broader use.
More than 75% of patients required mechanical ventila-
tion, 74% had suspected/moderate or severe malnutri-
tion according to the SGA, and more than one-third of
all patients had either a contraindication or intolerance
to EN. Notably, patients who received EN alone had a
larger mean daily caloric deficit on day –1 compared
with those who received either PN or a combination of
EN and PN, and a higher proportion of patients who re-
ceived EN alone failed to meet at least 90% of the daily
caloric target compared with those who received PN or
combined EN and PN. A previous randomised con-
trolled trial of 305 critically ill patients with persistent
energy deficits following 3 days of EN showed that
supplemental administration of PN improved the cumu-
lative energy balance compared with continued adminis-
tration of EN alone [30]. The effects of supplemental PN
and caloric intake on clinical outcome parameters are
discussed controversially [30–36]. However, current rec-
ommendations indicate that persistent energy and pro-
tein deficits for 2 days (ESPEN guidelines) or 7–10 days
(A.S.P.E.N. guidelines) in patients receiving EN alone
should prompt the clinician to consider the use of sup-
plemental PN to improve energy and protein delivery
and potentially reduce the risk of adverse clinical out-
comes [11, 12]. The results of the present study show that
supplemental PN reduces energy and protein deficits but
suggest that the supplemental use of PN is not optimally
employed as a therapeutic strategy in patients who fail to
receive adequate nutrition intake from EN alone.
Finally, logistic regression analysis identified a statisti-
cally significant association between achieving >90% of
the targeted energy and protein delivery on day –1 and
the type of prescribed nutritional therapy. Combined ad-
ministration of EN and PN was associated with a 64%
increase in the likelihood of meeting >90% of the daily
caloric target on day –1 and a 56% increase in the prob-
ability of meeting >90% of both the daily caloric target
and the daily protein target compared with EN alone.
Given the relatively low use of PN in the present study
and the observed improvements in cumulative energy
balance among ICU patients receiving supplemental PN
in a previous randomised trial [30], the association be-
tween supplemental PN and caloric and protein target
attainment in the present study suggests an opportunity
to improve energy and protein delivery in critically ill
patients in Latin America through the incorporation of
supplemental PN into the routine nutritional manage-
ment plan. Common practice in Latin America is to use
EN before adding or switching to PN whenever EN is
not contraindicated. In view of this general approach of
dynamically adapting EN and PN (including SPN) to
meet individual nutritional requirements, the current re-
sults clearly suggest an opportunity for further improve-
ments in optimising nutrition delivery to reach defined
nutritional targets.
The strengths of our study include the large sample size
and the high rate of data ascertainment for the parameters
of interest. Additionally, in contrast to studies in which
patients share a common starting point at the time of ICU
admission, the design of the present study allowed for a
representative mix of patients with different durations of
ICU stay before the time of the assessment. Moreover, the
study population included a high proportion of patients
with a long duration of ICU stay, thereby facilitating as-
sessment of the relationship between longer duration of
stay and prescribed nutrition therapy.
The findings of our study are subject to certain limita-
tions, including those inherent to cross-sectional study
design and retrospective analysis. Additionally, due to
lower than expected recruitment on the Screening Day,
the sample size was smaller than the originally planned
sample size of 2000 patients. Based on an estimated 50%
prevalence
of
malnutrition,
the
original
calculation
showed that a sample size of 2000 patients would pro-
vide a confidence interval with a precision of ±2.2%.
Recalculation based on the observed 74% prevalence of
malnutrition and the actual sample size of 1053 patients
yielded a confidence interval with a precision of ±2.7%.
The marginal difference in the precision of the confi-
dence intervals between sample sizes of 1053 and 2000
patients (0.5%) suggests that the smaller sample size had
a negligible effect on the precision of the estimates. A
substantial majority of hospitals in the study were aca-
demic institutions (83.7%) and 39.7% of the ICUs had a
specialised nutritional team; accordingly, the extent to
which the findings are generalisable to local/community
hospitals is uncertain. Moreover, patients were required
to be receiving nutrition therapy on both the Screening
Day and the previous day; therefore, the degree to which
nutrition therapy is optimally employed across the full
population of critically ill patients in the ICU setting
cannot be reliably ascertained. Finally, both the preva-
lence of underfeeding and the magnitude of caloric defi-
cits observed in the present study were lower than those
Vallejo et al. Critical Care  (2017) 21:227 
Page 9 of 11
 reported in a recent prospective study in nutritionally
at-risk critically ill patients [37]. This might be explained
in part by the cross-sectional design of the present
study, which resulted in a longer pre-screening duration
of ICU stay. The median duration of stay in the ICU on
the Screening Day was 10 days, reflecting a mixed popu-
lation of acute and chronically ill patients. The previous
study [37] evaluated patients beginning 96 hours after
admission to the ICU and therefore included a larger
proportion of patients in the acute phase of illness.
Other potential explanations for the observed differences
include a lower proportion of patients with gastrointes-
tinal intolerance, a lower proportion of patients requir-
ing invasive respiratory support, a higher proportion of
hospitals with nutrition therapy teams, and a higher pro-
portion of patients who received PN compared with the
previous study. However, despite these differences, the
results of the two studies are directionally consistent and
provide compelling corroborative evidence of the need
for improved nutrition practices to optimise energy
provision in critically ill patients.
Conclusions
Comprehensive assessment of the nutritional status of
critically ill adults receiving EN and/or PN in Latin
American hospitals identified caloric deficits in more than
40% of patients on EN, with lower deficits observed in pa-
tients receiving a combination of EN and PN. Coupled
with the low rates of PN use observed in the study, these
data suggest an opportunity for more effective utilisation
of supplemental PN in critically ill adults who fail to re-
ceive adequate nutrition intake from EN alone.
