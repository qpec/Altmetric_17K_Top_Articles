Toca 511 selectively replicates and spreads in malignant 
cells.1 Once tumor cells are infected, cytosine deaminase 
(CD) enzyme is expressed, which converts the prodrug, 
5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into the pyrimidine analog, 5-fluo-
rouracil (5-FU), leading to direct cytotoxicity of the cancer 
cells.2–4 We have shown that this treatment modality has 
broad applicability in multiple tumor types.5,6 Additionally, 
we and our colleagues (Hiraoka et al, accompanying 
article) show that this therapeutic approach also exerts an 
extended immunotherapeutic effect. These data are fur-
ther supported by an abundance of evidence that cytotoxic 
anticancer drugs, including 5-FU, can promote antitumor 
immune responses.7–12 This can take place through a mul-
titude of mechanisms, including immunogenic cell death 
(ICD) and depletion of immunosuppressive cell popula-
tions.13,14 Of note, 5-FU has been shown to selectively

Abstract
Background. Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec) is a retroviral replicating vector encoding an optimized yeast 
cytosine deaminase (CD). 
Tumor-selective expression of CD converts the prodrug, 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), into the 
active chemotherapeutic, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 
This therapeutic approach is being tested in a randomized phase II/
III trial in recurrent glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma (NCT0241416). The aim of this study was to identify 
the immune cell subsets contributing to antitumor immune responses following treatment with 5-FC in 
Toca 511–
expressing gliomas in a syngeneic mouse model.
Methods. Flow cytometry was utilized to monitor and characterize the immune cell infiltrate in subcutaneous 
Tu-2449 gliomas in B6C3F1 mice treated with 
Toca 511 and 5-FC.
Results. Tumor-bearing animals treated with Toca 511 and 5-FC display alterations in immune cell populations 
within the tumor that result in antitumor immune protection. Attenuated immune subsets were exclusive to immu-
nosuppressive cells of myeloid origin. Depletion of immunosuppressive cells temporally preceded a second event 
which included expansion of T cells which were polarized away from 
Th2 and 
Th17 in the CD4+ 
T cell compartment 
with concomitant expansion of interferon gamma–expressing CD8+ T cells. Immune alterations correlated with 
clearance of Tu-2449 subcutaneous tumors and T cell–dependent protection from future tumor challenge.
Conclusions. Treatment with Toca 511 and 5-FC has a concentrated effect at the site of the tumor which causes 
direct tumor cell death and alterations in immune cell infiltrate, resulting in a tumor microenvironment that is more 
permissive to establishment of a 
T cell mediated antitumor immune response.

deplete myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the 
tumor microenvironment and circulation.11 MDSCs, and 
other immunosuppressive myeloid cells such as tumor 
associated macrophages (TAMs), have been extensively 
studied in the field of tumor immunology and play a clear 
role in suppressing the immune system to promote tumor 
evasion from immune detection.15 MDSCs have also been 
shown to support recruitment and expansion of other 
immunosuppressive cells as well as directly support tumor 
growth and metastasis.15 Selective MDSC killing by 5-FU 
is hypothesized to be due to low target expression of thy-
midylate synthase (TS) in MDSCs, a phenomenon that has 
also been shown to correlate with cancer cell sensitivity to 
5-FU.11,16–19 Thymidylate synthase is the target of fluorode-
oxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), an active metabolite 
of 5-FU. Inhibition of TS by FdUMP results in DNA dam-
age and cell death, therefore lower expression levels of TS 
make MDSCs highly sensitive to this process.11
Chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-FU have dose limi-
tations due to their effects on normal tissue. Off-tumor 
effects include hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities. 
These dose limiting toxicities (i) hinder the amount of 5-FU 
that can be delivered to the patient, and thus the amount 
of cytotoxic agent that reaches the tumor, and (ii) reduce 
the number of healthy circulating immune cells that are 
available to participate in antitumor immunity. 
Therefore, a 
therapy that minimizes systemic effects by targeting 5-FU 
to within the tumor and its associated immunosuppressive 
microenvironment is of great value.20
The combination of Toca 51
1 and Toca FC, an extended 
release formulation of 5-FC, is under clinical investigation 
(NCT01
156584, NCT01470794, NCT02414165, NCT01985256) 
in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG). Further, 
a randomized phase II/III trial in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) 
and anaplastic astrocytoma is in progress (NCT0241416).
Materials and Methods
Toca 511 Generation and Cell Line Transfection
Materials and methods for generation and modification 
of the Toca 511 vector have been described in detail previ-
ously.1 A mouse glioma cell line, Tu-2449SC, was selected 
in vivo for its ability to grow subcutaneously and was 
transduced with Toca 511 in the presence of polybrene (4 
µg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich). 
Two percent of the 
Tu-2449SC 
Toca 
511 transduced cells were admixed with 98% wild-type 
(WT) Tu-2449SC cells (termed Tu-2449SC 2% Toca 511) and 
immediately implanted subcutaneously on the flanks of 
mice. By admixing pretransduced tumor cells with unin-
fected tumor cells, we aimed to capture the biological 
relevance of vector spread without introducing variability 
among animals through exogenous administration of vec-
tor. Rechallenge was conducted with WT 
Tu-2449SC cells.
Animals and In vivo Studies
All animal studies were conducted under approval and over-
sight by the facility’s Animal Care and Use Committee. Female 
B6C3F1 mice (Harlan Laboratories) received subcutaneous 
implants of 2 × 106 Tu-2449SC 2% Toca 51
1 cells on the right 
flank. Once tumors reached an average of 100 mm3, treat-
ment was initiated. 5-FC was administered s.i.d. (500 mg/kg) 
i.p. Control animals received phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 
Additional details are provided in the Supplementary material.
For adoptive transfer studies, recipient mice were given 
2 mg/mouse cyclophosphamide i.p. one day before adop-
tive cell transfer (ACT). Adoptive transfer was 13 × 106 
splenocytes, 5 × 106 purified T cells, or 8 × 106 T
-deplete 
splenocytes administered as a single i.v. injection.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis of 5-FU and 5-FC
Quantitative determination of 5-FU and 5-FC in plasma 
and tumor was conducted by Southern Research Institute 
 
and accomplished by use of supported liquid extrac-
tion and hydrophilic interaction chromatography with 
 
tandem mass spectrometry detection. The lower limit of 
quantitation for this method was 5 ng/mL.
Flow Cytometry
At indicated timepoints, spleen, draining lymph node 
(dLN), and tumor were collected and processed. Cells were 
analyzed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACS 
(fluorescence activated cell sorting) Canto flow cytometer 
running Diva software. Further analysis was conducted 
using FlowJo software. Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 
contain cell population descriptions and antibody clones, 
respectively. The Supplementary materials contain addi-
tional details on cell staining.
Statistics
In cases where only 2 groups were compared, a t-test 
was used to calculate P-values. In cases where more than 
2 groups were compared, a one-way ANOVA was used. 
Importance of the study
Reported here for the first time, we utilize the 
Tu-2449 syn-
geneic mouse model to show that treatment of Toca 51
1–
expressing tumors with 5-FC alters the immune profile in 
the tumor microenvironment, which results in long-term 
immune protection. While it was historically believed that 
this methodology only resulted in direct tumor cytotoxic-
ity, it is now appreciated that this approach also utilizes 
an immunotherapeutic mechanism. As such, we are posi-
tioned to determine whether alterations in immune profiles 
such as those reported here are correlative with outcomes 
in the clinical setting, which is why the findings from this 
work are being directly applied to the immune monitoring 
efforts for our randomized phase II/III trial in recurrent glio-
blastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma (NCT0241416).

Results
Toca 511/5-FC Treatment Results in Modulation, 
over Time, of Tumor-Associated Immune Cell 
Populations
Three days after 5-FC treatment initiation, total T 
helper cell populations are reduced in the tumor, with 
the remaining T helper cells expressing an activated 
phenotype
Subcutaneously implanted Tu-2449SC 2% Toca 511 tumors 
were allowed to grow until the average tumor size was 
100 mm3 before 5-FC or PBS treatment was initiated. 
Tumor burden was significantly reduced by 14 days post 
5-FC treatment initiation (Fig. 1A). Supplementary Fig. 1 
shows that 5-FC does not effectively reduce tumor growth 
if Toca 511 is not present. Tumor and plasma from a sub-
set of animals was collected on day 14 for pharmacokinetic 
analysis of 5-FC (prodrug) and 5-FU (active chemothera-
peutic agent) one hour after the last dose of 5-FC. Figure 1B 
shows that while the exogenously administered prodrug, 
5-FC, is detectable in plasma and tumor at high levels, 5-FU 
(the active chemotherapeutic agent which was generated 
endogenously through conversion of 5-FC by CD) is only 
detected in the tumor.
Three days after treatment initiation, spleen and tumor 
from one group of mice were collected for immunophenotyp-
ing and determination of cytokine expression. Interestingly, 
total CD3+ T cells were reduced with 5-FC treatment, which 
was determined to be from the CD4+ 
T helper cell population 
(Fig. 1C). Although CD4+ T cells were reduced in tumors of 
animals treated with 5-FC, those CD4+ 
T cells that remained 
expressed surface markers indicative of an activated pheno-
type, including a greater percentage of CD4+ 
T cells express-
ing 41BB, cluster of differentiation 40 ligand (CD40L), and 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) (Fig. 1D).
Fig. 1 Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment concentrates 5-FU at the site of the tumor and reduces tumor burden; however, changes in immune cell 
subsets in the tumor 3 days after treatment initiation are minimal. (A) Tumor burden expressed as tumor volume (mm3) over time (days post tumor 
implant). 5-FC treatment cycles are shown below the graph and collection dates are indicated by black arrows and labeled as days post 5-FC 
start (n = 5). (B) 5-FC and 5-FU were assessed in plasma and tumor 1 hour after the last administration of 5-FC (n = 4). (C) Pan T cells (CD3+), 
CD4+, CD8+, or Tregs were analyzed as a percentage of total live lymphocytes in the tumor 3 days post 5-FC treatment initiation (n = 5). (D) 41BB, 
CD40L, and PD1 expressions on CD4+ T cells were analyzed 3 days after 5-FC treatment initiation. These data were repeated with similar results 
in at least one additional experiment. *Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.

At the 3-day timepoint, tumors were analyzed for 
cytokine expression by intracellular staining using flow 
cytometry. Of those cytokines analyzed, including inter-
feron gamma (IFNγ), interleukin 4 (IL-4), tumor necrosis 
factor alpha (TNFα), and interleukin 17 (IL-17), no changes 
were observed (data not shown). Additionally, splenocytes 
and dLN were analyzed for immunophenotype as well 
as cytokine expression and no changes were observed 
between the 2 treatment groups (data not shown).
Six and 9 days after 5-FC treatment initiation, TAMs, 
MDSCs, and tumor associated monocytes are signifi-
cantly reduced in tumors treated with 5-FC compared 
with PBS controls
On day 6 post 5-FC start, total CD3+ 
T cells and, more spe-
cifically, CD4+ T cell numbers rebounded from the day 3 
timepoint data (not shown). Notably, cells of myeloid origin 
were significantly reduced. Specifically, TAMs, MDSCs, 
and tumor associated monocytes were reduced in tumors 
treated with 5-FC (Fig. 2A).
Six days after 5-FC initiation, splenocytes showed 
alterations in immunophenotype which included a sig-
nificant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells without a con-
comitant increase in regulatory T cells (Tregs) (Fig. 2B). 
Additionally, MDSC and monocytes were significantly 
reduced in spleens from mice treated with 5-FC at this 
timepoint (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the only timepoint when 
any changes were observed in the spleen was 6 days post 
5-FC treatment initiation. No changes were observed in 
the dLN.
In tumors collected on day 9 post 5-FC start, immunophe-
notyping data looked nearly identical to the data seen at 
the day 6 timepoint. 
T cell populations were unchanged but 
TAMs and MDSCs (Fig. 2D) remained significantly reduced 
in the presence of 5-FC. No changes were observed in the 
spleen or dLN.

Six and 9 days after 5-FC treatment initiation, fewer T 
helper cells in tumors treated with 5-FC express IL-4 
or IL-17 compared with PBS controls, and a larger pro-
portion of cells in the non–T cell compartment express 
TNFα and IFNγ
While analysis at 3 days after the initiation of 5-FC showed 
very few immunological changes, by day 6 the CD4+ 
T helper 
cell population was recovered to baseline, and significantly 
fewer of those CD4+ 
T cells expressed IL-4 or IL-17 compared 
with PBS-treated tumors (Fig. 3A). Additionally, the non–T 
cell compartment of the tumor (CD3−) showed a significant 
increase in the percentage of cells expressing 
TNFα (Fig. 3B).

be reduced compared with PBS-treated tumors (Fig. 3C). 
Additionally, at 9 days post 5-FC start, the non–T cell (CD3−) 
compartment of the tumor continued to show a greater per-
centage of cells expressing 
TNFα but also revealed a greater 
percentage of non–T cells expressing IFNγ (Fig. 3D). This 
was complemented by a significant increase in the percent-
age of CD8 
T cells that expressed IFNγ (Fig. 3E). No changes 
were observed in the spleen or dLN. Representative flow 
plots of these data are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a–e.
Fourteen days post 5-FC treatment initiation, tumor-
associated T cell populations are dramatically aug-
mented while immunosuppressive myeloid populations 
remain reduced
On day 14 post 5-FC start, tumor burden was greatly 
reduced in the 5-FC treatment group. Total live lympho-
cytes in 5-FC treated tumors were significantly increased, 
as were CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4A). Not surprisingly, 
CD4+ 
Tregs, as a population of total lymphocytes, were also 
increased in 5-FC treated tumors at the day 14 timepoint 
when the total 
T cell population was increased (Fig. 4A). Of 
note, when analyzing 
Tregs as a percentage of total CD4+ 
T 
cells, no increase was observed (Fig. 4B).
Myeloid populations continued to be reduced with 5-FC 
treatment 14 days after treatment initiation. TAMs as well 
as MDSCs were significantly reduced with 5-FC treatment 
as was seen at day 6 and day 9 post 5-FC start (Fig. 4C). 
Additionally, total B cells were dramatically increased with 
treatment compared with PBS controls (Fig. 4D).
No changes were observed in the spleen or dLN from 
these animals, and cytokine expression in tumors was 
not analyzed due to the limited amount of tumor tis-
sue in the 5-FC treatment group 14 days after treatment 
initiation.
Animals that clear tumors through treatment with Toca 
511 and 5-FC are protected from subsequent rechal-
lenge with Tu-2449 subcutaneous tumors
A group of 10 mice bearing subcutaneous Tu-2449SC 2% 
Toca 511 were treated for 5 weeks with 5-FC (5 days/wk, 
s.i.d.). Once treatment was complete, the animals were 
observed for a period of 9 additional weeks without further 
treatment to confirm complete tumor clearance. Of the 
10 animals treated, complete clearance of the tumor was 
confirmed in 5 mice 14 weeks after 5-FC treatment initia-
tion. 
The 5 cured mice were then rechallenged on the oppo-
site flank with Tu-2449SC cells and monitored for tumor 
growth. Naïve, age-matched control animals were also 
challenged. All animals that had previously cleared their 
tumors through treatment with 5-FC were able to com-
pletely clear tumor rechallenge within 2 weeks, whereas 
tumor grew unchecked in all naïve animals (Fig. 4E).
Adoptive transfer of immune cells from mice which 
have cleared Tu-2449 tumors through treatment with 
Toca 511 and 5-FC into recipient mice bearing ortho-
topic Tu-2449 intracranial implants results in improved 
survival and long-term cures
Mice were given intracranial implants of Tu-2449 cells 
and subsequently treated with 5-FC for 7 days followed 
by a 10-day treatment holiday. This was continued for 4 
cycles and long-term survivors were monitored for 120 
days before they were rechallenged subcutaneously. 
After 2 rounds of subcutaneous rechallenge/clearance, 
animals were termed “immunized” and splenocytes 
were harvested for ACT experiments. Naïve age-matched 
control mice were also used as donors for ACT experi-
ments. Recipient mice were given intracranial implants 
with Tu-2449-luciferase on day 0; and 10 days later were 
myelo-ablated with cyclophosphamide (2 mg/mouse 
i.p.). On day 11, immunized and naïve donor splenocytes 
were harvested and fractionated for ACT
. Recipient mice 
received one of 4 cell populations i.v.: (i) unfraction-
ated splenocytes from immunized animals, (ii) purified 
T cells from immunized animals, (iii) splenocytes from 
immunized animals which were depleted of T cells prior 
to transfer, or unfractionated splenocytes from naïve 
age-matched donors. All cells were analyzed by flow 
cytometry before and after purification steps to ensure 
that each animal received the equivalent of 5 × 106  T 
cells during ACT
. Therefore, mice that received unfrac-
tionated splenocytes from immunized animals were 
given an i.v. injection containing 13 × 106 splenocytes (5 
× 106 of which were T cells). Mice that received purified 
immunized T cells received 5 × 106 total cells. Mice that 
received T
-deplete immunized cells received 8 × 106 total 
cells. Animals that received naïve unfractionated spleno-
cytes were given an i.v. injection containing 13 × 106 total 
cells. Recipient mice were then monitored for 80 days 
for survival. Animals were monitored weekly for tumor 
clearance by bioluminescence imaging. Figure 4F shows 
that survival was significantly improved, compared with 
naïve or T
-deplete ACT recipients, in mice bearing ortho-
topic Tu-2449 gliomas which received ACT from immu-
nized donors as long as T cells were present. Mice that 
received T
-deplete splenocytes from immunized mice 
did not live significantly longer than those that received 
naïve unfractionated splenocytes. Upon imaging at 80 
days post tumor inoculation, all surviving animals were 
tumor free.
Discussion
In the recent past there has been a revival in appreciation of 
the role of the immune system in both tumor progression 
and tumor clearance. It is now recognized that immuno-
suppressive factors such as MDSCs, 
TAMs, and 
Tregs utilize 
a number of mechanisms to promote tumor evasion from 
the immune system. It has also been shown that in some 
cases, just overcoming these suppressive factors through 
depletion or inhibition of function is enough to reactivate 
antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, while tradi-
tional chemotherapeutic approaches have been designed to 
directly kill tumor cells, it now appears that several of these 
agents rely on activation of antitumor immune responses for 
full efficacy. Immune activation by chemotherapeutic agents 
can take place through a number of mechanisms which have 
been outlined in a recent review.21 Of note, Bracci et al high-
light that tumor cell death after treatment with select chem-
otherapeutic agents can reveal tumor antigens and promote

epitope spread through ICD. Additionally, several chemo-
therapeutic agents have specificity for immunosuppressive 
cells in the tumor microenvironment which, upon clearance, 
leads to reactivation of immune effector function.7–11,21–23 
The antineoplastic agent 5-FU has been reported to promote 
ICD, deplete immunosuppressive cells (specifically MDSCs) 
from the tumor microenvironment, and activate the adap-
tive arm of the immune system.7–11,24,25

(blue). These data were repeated with similar results in at least one additional experiment. *Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.

Mitchell et al. Toca 511 and 5-FC promote antitumor immunity
Neuro-
Oncology
This work was conducted in parallel with Hiraoka et 
al (accompanying article), who show complementary 
immune responses in an orthotopic glioma model follow-
ing treatment with 
Toca 511 and 5-FC. One goal of this work 
was to identify the immune cell populations that change 
over time following in vivo administration of 5-FC to mice 
bearing 
Toca 511–infected tumors. A summary of these find-
ings is outlined in Fig. 5. As expected, tumor burden was 
significantly reduced in mice that received 5-FC compared 
with mice that received PBS control. Immunosuppressive 
cells of myeloid origin (MDSCs, TAMs, monocytes) were 
reduced in the tumor microenvironment starting at day 6 
post 5-FC start and continued to be reduced throughout the 
remainder of the study. The myeloid cell depletion effect 
correlates with previous work with 5-FU which showed 
that 5-FU treatment results in depletion of MDSCs7–11,26 and 
that this effect is of translational importance as MDSCs are 
one immunosuppressive mechanism utilized by GBM to 
evade immune detection.26–28 Since TAMs and monocytes 
are of the same lineage as MDSCs, it is not surprising that 
a 5-FU–based treatment would also have some effect on 
those populations as well. At 14 days post 5-FC treatment 
initiation, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly 
increased in tumors of treated animals. An increase in the 
ratio of effector 
T cells to tumor targets is favorable during 
promotion of an antitumor immune response, especially 
when 
Tregs remain unchanged as seen here.
Analysis of the cytokine expression profiles in tumors of 
5-FC treated animals 6 and 9 days after treatment initiation 
showed differential expression of several key cytokines. 
Tumors treated with 5-FC had significantly fewer T helper 
cells expressing IL-4 (Th2) or IL-17 (Th17). A decrease in 
Th2 polarization is of clinical relevance, as Th2 skewing 
has been seen in patients with glioblastoma multiforme29 
and correlates with poor prognosis in a number of solid 
tumors.30–32 Additionally, IL-4 secretion from Th2 cells has 
been shown to polarize macrophages toward an immuno-
suppressive/alternatively activated state (otherwise known 
as M2), and so reduction of Th2 cells is considered highly 
beneficial in the tumor microenvironment.33 Interestingly, 
the reduction in Th2 polarization with 5-FC treatment also 
correlates with our observation of a decrease in TAMs. 
While Th17 cells have been shown to play a clear role in 
inflammatory processes such as autoimmune disorders 
and antimicrobial immunity, their role in tumor immunity 
is less clear and is likely dependent on tumor type. It has 
been well established that IL-17 can promote angiogene-
sis in several tumor types, and for that reason IL-17 is not 
generally considered to be beneficial in the tumor micro-
environment.34 Additionally, several mouse models have 
shown that IL-17 can potentiate MDSCs in the tumor micro-
environment, which is further evidence for the benefits of 
reducing 
Th17 with 
Toca 511 and 5-FC.
The CD3, or non–T cell, compartment of the tumor 
showed an increase in the number of cells expressing 
TNFα at day 6, which continued into the final analysis at 
day 9 post treatment start and included an increase in 
IFNγ which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, 
in general, experienced a shift toward an inflammatory 
state. At day 9 post treatment initiation there was also a 
significant increase in the percentage of intratumoral CD8 
T cells expressing IFNγ. There is substantial evidence that 
high levels of cytotoxic 
T cells expressing IFNγ are of great 
benefit to antitumor immune response.35
Toca 511 gene transfer of CD to tumors combined with 
successive delivery of the prodrug, 5-FC, results in subse-
quent conversion of 5-FC into 5-FU at the site of the tumor. 
The benefits of this approach are clear, as not only is the 
active agent concentrated at the site of the malignancy but 
the systemic effects are dramatically reduced.3 One major 
dose limiting toxicity of systemic 5-FU, as with most chem-
otherapeutic agents, is leukopenia. By reducing systemic 
exposure to 5-FU, this therapeutic platform can also spare 
many of the beneficial immune cells that are circulating 
in the blood and lymphatics, thus leaving them available 
for tumor infiltration and subsequent antitumor immune 
response. In fact, the work described herein showed that 
while 5-FC was detectable throughout the circulation, 5-FU 
was only present at detectable levels within the tumor tis-
sue. Furthermore, very few immune effects were observed

Mitchell et al. Toca 511 and 5-FC promote antitumor immunity
outside the tumor microenvironment in our studies, as 
spleen cells and draining lymph nodes were also ana-
lyzed at each timepoint and these tissues showed minimal 
immune subset changes.
Effects that were seen at the site of the tumor seem 
to track with what has been reported for 5-FU by others, 
including depletion of MDSCs with consequent expan-
sion and activation of CD8 cytotoxic T cells. These altera-
tions promote a long-term antitumor immune response, 
as evidenced by rapid clearance of subsequent challenges 
with the same tumor type. Of note, tumor rechallenge took 
place with cells that did not contain 
Toca 511, and therefore 
tumor rejection was due to antitumor and not antiviral 
immune response. Additionally, ACT of T cells which were 
harvested from mice which had previously cleared 
Tu-2449 
tumors through treatment with Toca 511 and 5-FC were 
capable of clearing orthotopic gliomas in recipient mice. 
These data are further supported by work from Hiraoka 
et al (accompanying manuscript), who show that clear-
ance of orthotopic gliomas results in protection from sub-
sequent tumor challenge; an effect that was blunted when 
T cells were depleted during the rechallenge phase of the 
study. Therefore, treatment with Toca 511 and 5-FC results 
in complete cures in glioma-bearing animals with long-
term protection from future recurrence through 
T cell medi-
ated immune memory. While use of a subcutaneous tumor 
model is a caveat of these studies, this approach affords 
the opportunity to assess a multitude of immune end-
points simultaneously and therefore model the potential of 
this therapy. Ultimately, this type of preclinical assessment 
aims to serve as a guide for initiation of biomarker discov-
ery efforts as well as identification of secondary endpoints 
for human clinical trials.
This work describes a novel approach to the treatment of 
cancer and validates the role that chemotherapeutics can 
have in cancer immunotherapy. 
The fact that direct admin-
istration of chemotherapeutic agents can have serendipi-
tous immune “side” effects has been presented before; 
however, systemic administration is plagued by a narrow 
therapeutic index due to systemic dose limiting toxicities.20 
Toca 511 is a retroviral replicating vector that selectively 
replicates and spreads in malignant cells, leading to tumor-
selective expression of CD and subsequent local conver-
sion of 5-FC into 5-FU. As a result, systemic effects are 
dramatically reduced and the benefits of 5-FU at the site 
of the tumor are preserved, including direct tumor cell kill-
ing and activation of a T cell mediated antitumor immune 
response.
Results from a recent phase I trial of treatment with 
Toca 
511 and Toca FC (NCT01470794) in subjects with recur-
rent HGG show a favorable benefit-risk assessment and 
improvement in overall survival compared with an external 
control with durable tumor responses consistent with the 
antitumor immune response described here.36 
Therapeutic 
efficacy of 
Toca 511 and 
Toca FC is currently being assessed 
in a randomized phase II/III trial (NCT02414165) in recur-
rent HGG and is being investigated in other solid tumors 
(NCT02576665), as well as in combination with other treat-
ments (NCT02598011). Further, the findings from this work 
were directly applied to the design of the immune monitor-
ing efforts in the randomized phase II/III trial (NCT02414165) 
in recurrent HGG.
