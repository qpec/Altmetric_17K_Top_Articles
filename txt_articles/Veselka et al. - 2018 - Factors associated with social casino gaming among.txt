Abstract
Background: With the proliferation of social casino games (SCGs) online, which offer the opportunity to gamble
without monetary gains and losses, comes a growing concern regarding the effects of these unregulated games
on public health, particularly among adolescents. However, given the limited research pertaining to SCG use, little
is currently known about the manner in which adolescents engage with this new gambling medium. The present
study aims to identify the factors that characterize adolescent social casino gamers, and to determine whether these
factors differ by SCG type. Moreover, the study examines the extent to which social casino gaming is associated with
monetary gambling and problem gambling in this cohort.
Method: Data were obtained from students in Grades 9 to 12 (n = 10,035) residing in the Canadian provinces of
Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Participants completed the Youth Gambling Survey
(YGS), which is a supplementary instrument administered alongside the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and
Drugs Survey (CSTADS). Logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with SCG play.
Results: Overall, 12.4% of respondents reported having participated in SCGs in the past three months. Compared
to adolescents who did not report playing SCGs, SCG players were typically more likely to participate in monetary
gambling activities, and were more prevalently classified as problem gamblers of low-to-moderate severity or
high severity. Although profiles of SCG players differed across SCG game types, factors significantly associated
with the playing of SCGs were gender, weekly spending money, having friends and parents who gamble, and
screen time. It was also shown that current smokers were significantly more likely to participate in simulated slots
online relative to adolescents who did not play SCGs.
Conclusion: Significant associations exist between SCG play, monetary gambling, and problem gambling among
adolescents. Gambling intervention efforts directed at this population should aim to identify personal and
environmental factors associated with social casino gaming, and should be tailored to different types of SCGs.

Background
Advancements in technology have fueled the expansion of
gambling activities beyond land-based venues and into
widely accessible online formats. This growth has resulted
in the development of social casino games (SCGs)—online
games featuring a gambling theme that are available
through standalone websites, social networking platforms,
and mobile-device applications [1, 2]. SCGs closely resem-
ble gambling activities in that they require players to stake
bets on outcomes governed by elements of chance in an
effort to win rewards [3, 4]. These games include, but are
not limited to casino table games, slots, poker, lotto,
bingo, and sports betting. SCGs differ fundamentally from
monetary gambling, however. Specifically, while bets and
winnings in SCGs take the form of virtual currency, which
holds no value outside of the games, and which cannot be
converted into money, monetary gambling is defined by
bets and winnings that take the form of currency or other

 items of monetary value [2]. Further, given that SCGs are
commonly built on a “freemium” revenue model, whereby
the full version of a game is provided to players at no cost,
players also do not pay to access SCGs [5]. Players can,
however, make small-sum monetary transaction within
SCGs, referred to as “microtransactions”, which allow
them to extend play when they exhaust initial seed credits,
to speed up play, or to purchase cosmetic or functional
virtual goods that enhance their gaming experience [1, 6].
These microtransactions represent the main revenue
source for SCGs. Given the absence of monetary betting
and rewards in SCGs, these games are not legally classified
as gambling activities, and are therefore unregulated [7].
Social casino gaming represents a popular form of en-
tertainment. Globally, about 170 million individuals play
SCGs monthly [8], and approximately 81 million individ-
uals play SCGs on a daily basis [9]. While preliminary evi-
dence suggests that the average age of SCG players ranges
from approximately 30 to 45 years [2, 6, 10], these esti-
mates are based on investigations of adult samples only,
and therefore poorly represent the full breadth of players
who engage in these games. Studies of adolescent use of
SCGs reveal that between 10 to 32% of adolescents have
participated in social casino gaming at some point in their
lives [2, 11–15]. These estimates are in line with preva-
lence rates reported for SCG play among adults [10, 11].
Therefore, adolescents represent a cohort with substantial
exposure to and interest in SCGs.
Despite the availability of best practice principles set
forth by the International Social Games Association [16],
social casino gaming is largely unregulated. As a result,
SCGs typically do not enforce recommended age restric-
tions that restrict SCG access to individuals younger
than 18 years of age, thereby providing ready access to
adolescents who choose to take part in these games [17].
This engagement in simulated gambling games by young
individuals is deemed potentially problematic because it
may encourage an early transition into monetary gam-
bling [2, 14, 18, 19]. Specifically, by normalizing gam-
bling behaviours, offering a training ground through
which gambling-related skills and habits are developed,
and instilling an excitement for gambling activities that
can only be augmented through higher-stakes waging
and winning, SCGs may act as a gateway to gambling
for adolescents [2, 17, 19–22]. Additionally, studies show
that early exposure to gambling activities, including par-
ticipation in SCGs at a young age, is a risk factor for the
development of future problem gambling [23, 24],
whereby individuals experience considerable negative
consequences and personal distress as a result of their
gambling activities [25]. Therefore, the availability of
SCGs to adolescents may facilitate problem gambling
tendencies among these individuals, and may ultimately
have implications for their mental health and well-being.
As a result, social casino gaming represents a potential
public health issue.
Existing studies have reported that adolescents who
play SCGs are more likely to engage in monetary gam-
bling, and are more likely to endorse indicators of
pathological gambling in comparison to SCG non-
players [14, 26, 27]. Most notably, longitudinal studies of
adolescents residing in Northern Germany [28] and the
province of Quebec, Canada [26] have reported that par-
ticipation in simulated versions of gambling games is a
significant predictor of subsequent monetary gambling.
Although a mirroring of these links has also been noted
between among adults [20, 21, 29], it should be noted
that adolescents may be particularly susceptible to the
negative impacts of SCG use. In support, Gainsbury,
King et al. (2015) observed that 28% of adolescents ver-
sus 17% of adults in their study had increased their par-
ticipation in monetary gambling as a direct result of
SCG use. Additionally, 33% of adolescents and only 15%
of adults in the study endorsed the erroneous belief that
SCG play will lead to increased success in subsequent
gambling activities. As a result, adolescents appear to be
more likely than adults to carry inaccurate perceptions
of SCGs, and to use SCGs as a springboard for further
gambling activities. Consequently, they are a vulnerable
population in the study of SCG use that warrants more
comprehensive investigation.
Characteristics of social casino gamers
Despite the fact that adolescents are avid users of
SCGs, and appear to be particularly susceptible to the
negative consequences of these games, little is known
about the characteristics of adolescent social casino
gamers. In fact, studies of the environmental and per-
sonal factors associated with SCG play have focused al-
most exclusively on adult samples [10, 30, 31], and
therefore potentially relevant variables specific to youn-
ger cohorts have largely been omitted from SCG inves-
tigations. Establishing the features that are typical of
adolescent social casino gamers is critical to informing
targeted intervention strategies, and to identifying at-
risk sub-groups within the adolescent population.
In studies of adult samples, researchers have identified
a number of factors that are more characteristic of SCG
players versus non-players [10, 30]. Specifically, re-
searchers have noted that male SCG players are more
likely to engage in competitive SCGs, particularly poker,
whereas female SCG players show a preference for on-
line gaming-machine games (e.g., slots), and for gam-
bling games that promote social interactions [10]. These
results are in line with studies of online and land-based
monetary gambling reported among adults and adoles-
cents [32–34]. Additionally, adult SCG players are more
likely to smoke tobacco on a daily basis, and are more
Veselka et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1167 
Page 2 of 15
 likely to have used illicit drugs in the past 12 months in
comparison to individuals who do not use SCGs [10].
Lastly, compared to adults who do not take part in social
casino gaming, adults who play SCGs are more likely to
be employed full-time, but are also more likely to be un-
employed or reliant on a disability pension [10]. Empirical
research is needed to determine whether these same char-
acteristics that defines adult SCG users are also applicable
to adolescents who take part in social casino gaming.
Although a number of the factors that are characteris-
tic of adult SCG players are also relevant to adolescents,
it is plausible that additional characteristics beyond
those identified for adults are related to SCG play among
adolescents. These additional correlating factors with
SCG play are possible, given that adolescents are distinct
from adults developmentally, and they exhibit gambling
tendencies and preferences that are unique from those
of adults [35, 36]. Studies of monetary online gambling
among adolescents may provide preliminary insight into
the
manner
in
which
these
potentially
overlooked
variables are related to social casino gaming, given that
SCGs and monetary online gambling games are typically
used by individuals with similar sociodemographic pro-
files [10]. A key factor that may have an impact on SCG
use among adolescents is peer and parental transmission
of behaviours and attitudes pertinent to gambling [37,
38]. Studies carried out in Canada, the United Kingdom,
and Hong Kong have shown that adolescents who have
close friends or parents who engage in monetary gam-
bling are more likely to participate in monetary online
gambling [15, 39–41]. This role of close others in expli-
citly or tacitly encouraging gambling activities may be
especially pertinent to social casino gaming, which often
involves the sharing of SCG scores or the promotion of
SCG play with one’s online social networks through so-
cial media websites [1].
Academic performance is another factor not studied
among adult SCG users that may be relevant to an un-
derstanding of social casino gaming among adolescents,
particularly due to the centrality of school activities to
adolescent lives [42]. Existing studies of online gambling
show that poor academic performance, as reflected by
lower grades in school, is predictive of monetary online
gambling among adolescents [15, 43, 44]. Further, aca-
demic problems, such as missed classes, poor study
habits, and failure to submit work, are also significantly
associated with more pervasive monetary online gam-
bling [41]. These same patterns of effects may further
extend to SCG use.
Sedentary behaviour, exhibited by a lack of physical ac-
tivity, may also be a factor relevant to adolescent SCG
players. Although sedentary behaviour has been largely
overlooked in studies of monetary gambling behaviours
in general, some existing evidence suggests that more
substantial periods of inactivity as well as indicators of
poor physical health, such as obesity, are positively asso-
ciated with a propensity toward monetary gambling
across all age groups [45, 46]. Additionally, it has been
shown that sedentary behaviour is particularly promin-
ent during adolescence, with Canadian adolescents typic-
ally spending over 8 h daily engaging in sedentary
activities, primarily those involving screens [47–49].
Although a pervasiveness in screen time is harmful on
its own [50], it may also increase exposure to online
gaming and gambling, and may subsequently result in
greater SCG play among this cohort.
An additional factor that may be associated with social
casino gaming among adolescents is binge-drinking—the
tendency to engage in the heavy consumption of alcohol
over a short period of time with the intention of becom-
ing intoxicated [51]. Binge-drinking has been show to in-
crease during adolescence [52], and it has been linked to
risky activities, including illicit drug use, tobacco use,
and physical aggression [53, 54]. Previous studies of ado-
lescents have further reported a significant association
between binge-drinking and the risky activity of monet-
ary gambling. Specifically, it has been shown that adoles-
cents with a history of gambling are more likely to have
experienced episodes of binge-drinking in the past year
[55]. Binge-drinking is also significantly associated with
at-risk and pathological gambling among adolescents [56,
57]. Theories of deviance suggest that a general propensity
toward risk-taking may explain the typical co-occurrence
between alcohol misuses and other risky activities, includ-
ing gambling, whereby adolescents who seek stimulation
and short-term and immediate gratification tend to engage
in multiple problem behaviours [58, 59]. If this behav-
ioural pattern extends to social casino gaming, then it is
feasible that binge-drinking may also be associated with
SCG play among adolescents.
Present study
The present study represents one of the first empirical
analyses of the characteristics defining adolescent social
casino gamers. It is also one of the first studies to exam-
ine the factors associated with social casino gaming
across different types of SCGs: poker, slots, and SCGs
hosted on the social media site Facebook. Poker and
slots represent the most popular SCGs among adult
samples [10, 17], and Facebook is the most popular so-
cial media site for SCG play [21]. The differentiation be-
tween SCG types in the present analysis was deemed
important given that previous research on monetary
gambling has demonstrated that individuals who engage
in different types of gambling activities are typically de-
fined by unique characteristics and tendencies [40, 60].
These same effects may also be applicable to SCGs. In
addition to exploring these new effects, the present
Veselka et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1167

 study aims to replicate previously reported associations
between SCG use, monetary gambling, and problem
gambling among adolescents. In pairing these replication
efforts with assessments of SCG player characteristics,
the aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the
manner in which SCG play is related to monetary gam-
bling among adolescents, and to build upon existing lon-
gitudinal studies on this topic. Use of SCGs in the past
three months is assessed in the present study to capture
current participation rather than lifetime participation in
social casino gaming. Further, a large and representative
sample of adolescents from three Canadian provinces is
examined in the present study, thereby overcoming a
limitation of the majority of Canadian studies of adoles-
cent gambling that have primarily relied upon conveni-
ence samples recruited from major cities [61].
Based on existing literature, it is predicted that, among
adolescents, males will be more likely to play the SCG of
poker, whereas females will be more likely to play the
SCG of slots [10]. Further, it is hypothesized that those
who have played SCGs in the past three months will be
more likely to report: being a current smoker, having
access to either very high or very low disposable income,
having parents or close peers who gamble, achieving lower
grades in school, leading a more sedentary lifestyle, binge-
drinking, and engaging in monetary gambling activities
[10, 15, 44]. Additionally, based on existing findings, it is
expected that higher-severity problem gambling will be
observed among adolescents who have played SCGs in the
past three months versus those who have not [14, 26].
Specific hypotheses regarding the manner in which factors
associated with SCG play may differ across game types
have not been put forth due to the paucity of research on
this subject.
Method
Design
Participants in the study were 10,035 secondary-school
students in Grades 9 to 12, ranging in age from 13 to
19 years. Participants completed the Youth Gambling Sur-
vey (YGS; [62]), a supplementary instrument administered
alongside the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and
Drugs Survey (CSTADS), formerly the Youth Smoking
Survey
(YSS)
[63,
64].
Students
were
recruited
to
complete the YGS through stratified multistage sampling
that yielded provincially representative samples from three
Canadian provinces: Ontario, Saskatchewan, and New-
foundland and Labrador. All school boards, schools, and
students who took part in the YSS in these provinces were
also eligible to complete the YGS. Overall, a total of
15,269 students across the three provinces were eligible to
take part in the YGS, and the response rate was 66%. The
YGS was administered in both English and French follow-
ing the YSS questionnaire, and it was completed by
participating students in their classrooms during school
hours. The administration of both the YSS and the YGS
took approximately 20–30 min within each class. Data
collection occurred in the years 2012–2013, and therefore
it preceded the legalization of online gambling that took
place in Ontario in January, 2015. Additional details re-
garding the YSS can be found at: https://uwaterloo.ca/
canadian-student-tobacco-alcohol-drugs-survey/
Ethics approval for both the YSS and the YGS was
granted by the University of Waterloo Research Ethics
Office. Parental consent was obtained for all participat-
ing students via either an active permission protocol or
an active information/passive permission protocol, based
on the requirements of the corresponding school board
or school. On the day of participation, all students
were notified of their right to decline participation in
the study.
Measures
Social casino gaming
Three items were used to measure whether participants
have played SCGs, consistent with previous studies [15,
65]. Specifically, participants were asked how often they
played the following games for fun (no money): Internet
poker, Internet slots, gambling games on Facebook. Re-
sponse options consisted of: “not in the past 3 months”,
“about once per month”, “2-3 times per month”, “about
once per week”, “2-6 times per week”, “daily”. Participants
were categorized as being SCG players for each game type
if they indicated that they played a given game with any
frequency in the past three months. In cases where partic-
ipants reported having played multiple types of SCGs in
the past three months, their responses were assessed
under each game-type category that they endorsed. Con-
sequently, it was possible for a single participant to be rep-
resented under each of the three game-type categories in
the study.
Modality of monetary gambling
Land-based gamblers were participants who reported
gambling for money or for something of value at least
once in the past three months through one or more of
the following gambling activities: (1) lottery tickets; (2)
instant-win or scratch tickets; (3) cards; (4) board games
or dice; (5) video lottery terminals; (6) slot machines not
online; (7) arcade or video games; (8) sports select; (9)
sports pools or games not online; (10) horse races; (11)
performance in games of skill (e.g., pool, golf, bowl-
ing, darts) or other activities; (12) a dare or challenge;
(13) bingo.
Online gamblers were participants who indicated that
they had gambled for money or for something of value
at least once in the past three months on any of the fol-
lowing three activities: (1) Internet poker; (2) sports
Veselka et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1167 
Page 4 of 15
 pools or games online; (3) slot machines online. In the
current sample, only 1.9% of respondents (n = 74) gam-
bled solely online. Therefore, our sample of online gam-
blers (n = 833) includes those individuals who gambled
exclusively online as well as those who gambled both
online and in land-based gambling.
Respondents were coded as non-gamblers if they indi-
cated that they did not gamble in the past three months
on any of the activities listed above.
Problem gambling severity
The severity of problem gambling experienced by par-
ticipants was measured using the Gambling Problem
Severity Subscale (GPSS) of the Canadian Adolescent
Gambling Inventory (CAGI) [66]. The CAGI is the
seminal measure developed to assess the behavioural
component of gambling among adolescents, and it has
demonstrated sound psychometric properties in previ-
ous studies using adolescent samples [67–69]. The
GPSS consists of nine items assessing behaviours per-
tinent to problem gambling that occurred in the past
three months, which have psychological, social, finan-
cial, and inhibitory consequences. Participants re-
spond to each item by indicating the frequency with
which they engage in the target behaviour using a
Likert-type scale on which higher scores indicate
greater frequency. To calculate gambling severity, rat-
ings on the GPSS are summed, and the total number
of items that were answered is subtracted from the
sum. Gambling severity scores are then categorized as
follows: GPSS ≤1 = no problem gambling, GPSS 2 to 5
= low to moderate gambling severity, GPSS 6 to 27 =
high gambling severity.
Parent or friend who gambles
Respondents were asked to indicate if any of their par-
ents, step-parents, or guardians gambled for money. Re-
sponses were coded as “yes”, “no” and “don’t know or
not stated”.
Participants also indicated how many of their clos-
est friends gambled for money. Responses were then
coded as “yes”, “no” and “don’t know or not stated”
to indicate whether or not they had one or more
close friends who gambled.
Substance use
Respondents were classified as current smokers if they
reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime,
and if they indicated that they had smoked in the past
30 days. Respondents were classified as former smokers
if they reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their
lifetime, and if they indicated that they had not smoked
in the past 30 days. Respondents were classified as
non-smokers if they reported having never smoked or if
they indicated that they had smoked fewer than 100 cig-
arettes in their lifetime. For the purposes of analysis,
smoking status was represented as a dichotomous vari-
able characterized by two levels: current smokers and
former/non-smokers. The 100-cigarette criterion for de-
termining smoking status is an established criterion in
tobacco research [70, 71], and it has been used reliably
in previous studies of tobacco use [72, 73].
To assess binge-drinking, participants responded to an
item that asked whether they had consumed five drinks of
alcohol or more on one occasion in the past 12 months.
This definition of binge-drinking is consistent with previ-
ous studies of adolescent alcohol consumption [74, 75].
Responses were coded as “never or not in the last year”,
“yes, in the last year”, and “don’t know or not stated”.
School performance
To measure school performance,
respondents were
asked to select the marks they typically receive in school.
Responses were then coded as “mostly As”, “mostly As
and Bs”, “mostly Bs and Cs”, “mostly Cs or lower”, and
“not stated”.
Screen time
Sedentary tendencies were measured through an assess-
ment of daily screen time. Specifically, respondents were
asked to report how many hours per day, on average,
they spend doing the following: (1) watching/streaming
TV shows or movies; (2) playing video or computer
games; (3) surfing the Internet. The estimates provided
by each participant across the measured activities were
summed to create a single continuous variable of screen
time. Due to the positive skew of the summed scores, a
natural logarithmic transformation was employed to
make the measure more symmetrical.
Sociodemographic variables
Participants were asked to report on their gender (male/
female), province of residence (Newfoundland and Lab-
rador, Ontario, Saskatchewan), grade (9–12), and weekly
spending money. Weekly spending money was measured
by asking participants how much money they receive or
earn each week to spend on themselves or to save. Re-
sponses were categorized as: “$0 to $20”, “$21 to $100”,
“more than $100”, “don’t know/missing”.
Data analysis
Logistic regression analyses were employed to examine
the factors associated with each type of social casino
gaming: poker, slots, and SCGs on Facebook. Bootstrap
survey weights were used in order to account for the
sampling design. The statistical package STATA 12.0
was used for all analyses.

 Results
Sample characteristics for all adolescents in the present
study (n = 10,035) are reported in Table 1. Overall, 9.1%
of adolescents in the three Canadian provinces assessed
indicated that they had played the SCG of poker in the
past 3 months, 5.0% reported participating in the SCG
of slots in the past 3 months, and 9.0% stated that they
had played SCGs on Facebook in the past three months.
Further, 32.3% of adolescents indicated that they had
taken part in land-based gambling in the past three
months, and an additional 9.3% indicated that they had
gambled online for money in the past three months. Al-
though the majority of the sample did not report symp-
toms of problem gambling, 4.2% of adolescents in the
three provinces surveyed endorsed items indicative of
low to moderate problem gambling severity, and 2.2%
reported behaviours reflective of high problem gam-
bling severity.
Among the 12.4% of respondents who reported having
participated in any SCG in the past three months (n =
1204), 57.3% of SCG players had played only one type of
SCG, while nearly 1 in 5 SCG players (19.4%) had played
all three game types. Poker was the most popular SCG,
with 67.6% of all SCG players indicating that they had
played this SCG in the past three months. Poker was
also the most popular game among SCG players who re-
ported playing only one type of SCG in the timeframe
assessed, with 29.1% of SCG players stating that they
had played only this game in the past three months.
Additionally, 23.4% of SCG players indicated that they
had played only SCGs on Facebook in the past three
months, and 4.8% stated that they had played only the
SCG of slots in the past three months. Further, 23.4% of
SCG players indicated that they had played two SCGs in
the past three months. Specifically, 12.7% of SCG players
indicated that they had played the SCG of poker and
Facebook SCGs, 6.4% reported that they had played the
SCG of poker and the SCG of slots, and 4.3% stated that
they had played Facebook SCGs and the SCG of slots in
the preceding three months.
Problem gambling among SCG players versus non-players
across game types
Problem gambling prevalence among current gamblers
was compared between SCG players and SCG non-players
across different types of SCGs (see Fig. 1). Across all game
types assessed, a significantly larger proportion of SCG
players versus non-players were classified as exhibiting
gambling problems of low-to-moderate severity or high
severity. In contrast, the vast majority of SCG non-players
across all games types did not endorse items indicative of
problem gambling. Specifically, for the SCG of poker,
18.5% of players versus 7.6% of non-players were catego-
rized as having gambling problems of low-to-moderate
severity, and 18.9% of players versus 2.3% of non-players
were categorized as having gambling problems of high se-
verity (χ2 = 64.07, p < 0.001). For the SCG of slots, 17.8%
of players versus 8.6% of non-players were classified as
having gambling problems of low-to-moderate severity,
and 32.5% of players versus 2.0% of non-players were clas-
sified as having gambling problems of high severity (χ2 =
186.00, p < .001). Lastly, for SCGs accessible via Facebook,
18.6% of players versus 7.8% of non-players were shown
to have gambling problems of low-to-moderate severity,
and 19.3% of players versus 2.0% of non-players were
shown to have gambling problems of high severity (χ2 =
111.59, p < 0.001). Overall, adolescents who reported play-
ing the SCG of slots exhibited the highest proportion of
high-severity gamblers.
Factors associated with social casino gaming
Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the
factors associated with participation in three different
types of social casino gaming in the past three months
(Table 2). Separate models were examined for adolescents
who reported playing SCG poker (Model 1), SCG slots
(Model 2), and SCGs games on Facebook in the past
(Model 3), compared to adolescents who did not report
playing any type of SCGs in the past three months.
Model 1: SCG poker players versus SCG non-players
Females (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.26–0.45, p < 0.001) had
significantly lower odds of playing the SCG of poker
relative to males. Additionally, respondents who earned
more than $100 per week (OR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.22–2.36,
p < 0.01) were significantly more likely to play the SCG
of poker than respondents who earned between $0 to
$20 weekly. Lastly, adolescents who reported having a
parent who gambles (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.16–2.09, p <
0.01), and those who had gambled online in the past
three months (OR = 5.85, 95% CI 3.66–9.35, p < 0.001)
were more likely to have played the SCG of poker.
Model 2: SCG slots players versus SCG non-players
Findings revealed that adolescents who earned more
than $100 weekly (OR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.81–4.42, p <
0.001) had significantly greater odds of playing the SCG

nificantly greater likelihood of playing the SCG of slots
was observed among respondents who reported being
current smokers (OR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.17–3.80, p < 0.05),
among those who indicated that they had a close friend
(OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.45–2.56, p < 0.01) or parent who
gambles (OR = 1.69, 95% CI 1.17–2.44, p < 0.01), and

basis
(OR = 2.18,

In
addition, adolescents who participated in land-based

 online gambling (OR = 7.33, 95% CI 4.73–11.36, p <

likely to indicate that they have played the SCG of slots,
compared to individuals who did not gamble in the past
three months.
Model 3: Facebook SCG players versus SCG non-players
Results indicated that, compared to individuals who
earned $0 to $20 per week, those who earned $21 to
$100 weekly (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.09–2.41, p < 0.05) and
over $100 weekly (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.05–2.79, p < 0.05)
had significantly greater odds of playing SCGs on Face-
book. A greater likelihood of playing SCG games on
Facebook was also noted for adolescents who indicated
that they have a close friend (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.44–
2.48, p < 0.001) or parent (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.13–2.00,
p < 0.01) who gambles, and for adolescents who reported
engaging in more daily screen time (OR = 1.54, 95% CI
1.24–1.91, p < 0.001). Lastly, results indicated that, com-
pared to adolescents who had not gambled in the past
three months, those who took part in land-based gam-
bling (OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.25–2.15, p < 0.001) and in on-
line gambling (OR = 5.76, 95% CI 3.88–8.54, p < 0.001)
during this same time period were significantly more
likely to report also playing SCGs on Facebook.

 associated with social casino gaming among adolescents
across three types of SCGs. Results from the study
revealed significant associations between social casino
gaming, monetary gambling in online and land-based
forms, and indicators of problem gambling. Additionally,
findings identified key factors that distinguish adoles-
cent social casino gamers from adolescents who do
not play SCGs.
Overall, the proportion of adolescents who reported
playing SCGs in the present study (12.4%) is in line with
previous estimates of social casino gaming prevalence
among both adolescent and adult samples [10]. It should
be noted, however, that the proportion of adolescent
SCG players observed in the present study may be an
underestimate of social casino gaming prevalence, given
that SCG play in the current study is restricted to the
past three months. Further, consistent with previous
studies of social casino gaming among adults the present
findings showed that the most popular SCG among ado-
lescents is simulated poker [10, 17].
Social casino gaming and monetary gambling among
adolescents
The present study revealed that, compared to individuals
who did not play SCGs, adolescent SCG users were
more likely to participate in both online monetary gam-
bling and land-based monetary gambling across nearly
all SCGs assessed. Previous investigations of SCG use
among adolescents and adults have also reported similar
findings [10, 20, 29]. Given the cross-sectional nature of
the present study, it is not possible to know whether
SCG play facilitates the transition to monetary gambling,
whether adolescents who gamble seek out SCGs as a
substitute for monetary gambling activities, or whether
individuals who are already monetary gamblers choose
to play SCGs because of the considerable similarities be-
tween the two activities [6, 11, 14, 20, 76]. However, re-
cent longitudinal analyses conducted using adult and
adolescent samples suggest that social casino gaming
may indeed facilitate the crossover into monetary gam-
bling [21, 26]. Consequently, it is plausible that social ca-
sino gaming may act as a prime for subsequent monetary
gambling by facilitating the development of gambling
habits that can be extended into monetary venues [17, 22].
This transition from SCG play into monetary gambling
may be particularly relevant to some Canadian jurisdic-
tions (i.e., Ontario) where monetary online gambling has
been legalized. The legalization of monetary online gam-
bling creates an environment in which gambling via the
Internet is legitimized and accessible [77]. It further leads
to the proliferation of advertising for online monetary
gambling games, particularly within SCGs [23]. Conse-
quently, adolescent SCG players residing in jurisdictions
where online monetary gambling is legal may be particu-
larly at-risk of pursuing this type of gambling given their
familiarity with Internet-based gambling activities, and
given their exposure to online-gambling advertisements.
Further research is needed to examine the link be-
tween social casino gaming and online monetary gam-
bling pre- and post-legalization of online gambling in
relevant jurisdictions.
Interestingly, while players of SCG poker were signifi-
cantly more likely than SCG non-players to take part in
online monetary gambling, they did not differ signifi-
cantly from SCG non-players in their tendency to seek
out land-based monetary gambling. A potential explan-
ation for this observation may be rooted in existing
studies of typical gambling habits. Specifically, research

 has shown that individuals who gamble across different
modalities tend to be consistent in the gambling activ-
ities they pursue [24, 26]. Among poker players, who
typically identify strongly with the game of poker [26,
78], the tendency to remain dedicated to the game
across various platforms may be particularly evident. In
the case of adolescents who play the SCG of poker, how-
ever, a transition from social casino gaming communities
into strictly monitored land-based monetary gambling
venues may be difficult due to legal restrictions or the po-
tentially intimidating nature of the poker-game environ-
ment. Instead, adolescent poker players interested in
monetary gambling may more avidly seek out online mon-
etary gambling opportunities that offer a less regulated
and largely anonymous gambling environment [79, 80].
Further, the draw to online monetary poker among SCG
poker players may be magnified by the popularity of the
game on the Internet, and by the pervasive advertising for
online poker that is typically embedded in SCGs [81].
These suggested effects represent an opportunity for fur-
ther study, particularly in the context of SCGs.
Social casino gaming and problem gambling among
adolescents
Findings from the study revealed that, across all types
of SCGs, a larger proportion of SCG players than
non-players were classified as exhibiting signs of prob-
lem gambling. In contrast, adolescents who did not re-
port playing SCGs in the past three months were
predominantly classified as not being problem gam-
blers. These results are supportive of existing studies of
adults and adolescents, in which social casino gaming
has exhibited associations with problem gambling ten-
dencies [2, 14, 27]. While the present results stem from
a cross-sectional design, which precludes the identifica-
tion of causal effects, it may be the case that individ-
uals,
and
particularly
adolescents,
increase
their
likelihood of experiencing symptoms pertinent to prob-
lem gambling as a result of SCG play. In support, stud-
ies have found that adolescents develop inaccurate
attitudes regarding monetary gambling through simu-
lated gambling experiences [11]. Specifically, because
SCGs aim to maximize player enjoyment in an effort to
increase play time and frequency, these games are typ-
ically characterized by inflated odds of success along-
side augmented payout rates—a system known as
dynamic game balancing [82]. Dynamic game balancing
in SCGs, therefore, can create the illusion that one is
more skilled or perhaps luckier in a gambling game
than is actually the case [24]. These flawed beliefs, in
turn, prompt players to persist gambling in the face of
financial loss when they transition into monetary gam-
bling activities, yielding problematic gambling habits
[20, 24, 83]. When these misleading experiences occur
early in one’s life, they can be particularly predictive of
later pathological gambling [23]. Consequently, the
playing of SCGs may be a considerable risk factor for
future problem gambling among adolescents.
With that said, it may also be the case that monetary
gamblers who exhibit problem gambling tendencies
more pervasively engage in social casino gaming [23].
This expansion from monetary gaming into SCGs may
be seen as a way to diversify one’s gambling activities, or
it may be considered an avenue through which gamblers
seek to mitigate their gambling habits by participating in
games that simulate gambling activities without carrying
the same financial risk [2, 76].
Across all SCGs assessed, the highest proportion of
SCG players exhibiting high-severity gambling tendencies
were players of simulated slots. This observation is in line
with previous studies of monetary gambling, where it has
been reported that slot-machine gambling is significantly
related to problem gambling among adolescents and
adults [84, 85], and tends to be the preferred form of mon-
etary gambling among problem gamblers [86, 87]. This
link between slot-machine gambling and problem gam-
bling has been attributed to the structural characteristics
of slot-machine games, which are visually stimulating,
offer a highly variable reward schedule, and provide in-
stant feedback [88, 89]. Such structural characteristics
have been shown to promote frequent and continuous
gambling [89]. In the context of SCG play, it is possible
that individuals drawn to the SCG of slots also have a
preference for engaging in more highly addictive gambling
games, such as slot-machine gambling, and may therefore
be more likely to exhibit symptoms of gambling problems.
Factors associated with social casino gaming among
adolescents
Overall, the present study identified six factors associ-
ated with social casino gaming among adolescents:
gender, weekly spending money, smoking status, having
friends who gamble, having parents who gamble, and
screen time. Although considerable consistency was
noted in the factors related to participation in the SCG
of slots and SCGs on Facebook, SCG poker players
tended to exhibit unique defining characteristics.
In line with previous research, males were more likely
than females to report playing the SCG of poker in the
past three months, relative to SCG non-players [10].
Gender differences in play were not observed for the
SCG of slots or for SCG games on Facebook. The ab-
sence of gender differences among Facebook
SCG
players may be attributable to the fact that simulated
gambling games on this social network site are often var-
ied, combining competitive elements that typically ap-
peal to male players with social elements that are
typically more attractive to female players [1]. As a
Veselka et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1167 
Page 10 of 15
 result, males and females may be equally drawn to these
games. In the case of slots, which tend to be played
more pervasively by females in both simulated and mon-
etary forms [10, 32, 33], the rationale for the absence of
gender differences is less clear. It is possible that the ob-
served effects stem from the complex associations noted
between gender, gambling tendencies, and use of new
technologies in past studies. Specifically, while it has
been observed that females are more likely to engage in
gaming-machine gambling and gambling games of pure
chance, such as slots [32], males are more commonly
drawn to new digital and online platforms for gaming
and gambling [90, 91]. Given that the SCG of slots cur-
rently represents a novel technological avenue for gam-
ing, it may be equally appealing to both genders.
Additional studies are needed to explore these findings.
Adolescents who reported taking part in SCGs in the
past three months, regardless of game type, were more
likely to indicate that they receive over $100 per week in
allowance or earnings, in comparison to adolescents who
did not report using SCGs. These same findings have been
observed in studies of social casino gaming and monetary
gambling among adults, where higher-income individuals
tend to gravitate toward gambling activities [10, 40, 92].
Given that social casino gaming does not require the ex-
change of currency, it is likely not the case that adoles-
cents with more disposable income are more likely to play
SCGs because they would be less financially impacted by
gambling losses, as has been suggested for adults [93, 94].
Rather, it may be the case that greater weekly spending
among adolescents is an indicator of their household’s
higher socioeconomic status. Adolescents residing in
more financially stable households may have better access
to computer equipment, cellular devices, and techno-
logical services, and may therefore have more opportun-
ities to access SCGs [40].
As predicted, it was observed that adolescent SCG
players were more likely to report having a friend or a par-
ent who gambles in comparison to adolescents who had
not played SCGs the past three months. These results are
in line with existing research pertaining to online and
land-based gambling [15, 39–41], where it has been noted
that close others within an individual’s environment tend
to transmit their gambling attitudes and behaviours to the
individual, be it through implied approval [37], through
modeling [95], or through pressure to conform [96]. The
one exception to this general pattern was observed
for the SCG of poker, where it was noted that indi-
viduals who have played the SCG of poker in the past
three months were not more likely to have friends
who gamble than individuals who did not report tak-
ing part in SCGs. This lack of peer influence among
SCG poker players has not been reported in previous
investigations, and therefore warrants further study.
In the present study, adolescents reported spending an
average of 3.6 hours daily on activities involving screens.
This value exceeds the recommendations of the Canad-
ian Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for Children and
Youth, which state that adolescents should limit recre-
ational screen time to no more than 2 hours per day
[97]. When sedentary tendencies were assessed in the
context of SCG play, it was observed that simulated
poker exhibited a unique pattern of associations with
screen time in comparison to the other SCG types. Spe-
cifically, while it was found that adolescents who spent
more time each day watching television, surfing the
Internet, or playing computer games were more likely to
participate in the SCG of slots and in Facebook SCGs,
this same effect was not noted for poker. The finding
that screen time may be linked to participation in some
social casino gaming is a novel observation that has not
been reported in previous assessments of SCG play.
Existing research, however, has shown that inactivity and
subsequent poor physical health are related to monetary
gambling in general [45, 46], and therefore the present
findings extend these previous observations. Longitu-
dinal analyses are needed, however, to clarify the causal
link between SCG play and sedentary tendencies. It may
certainly be the case that individuals with more daily
screen time are more likely to be exposed to SCGs, and
are therefore more likely to take part in them [11, 17].
At the same time, it is also possible that social casino
gaming facilitates sedentary tendencies due to the fact
SCGs are typically designed to promote extended play
and the frequent return of players to SCG host sites or
applications [82]. Further research is also needed to bet-
ter understand the absence of an association between
screen time and the tendency to play the SCG of poker.
Some findings from investigations of monetary gambling
have noted that recreational poker play tends to be char-
acterized by shorter play times, perhaps due to the tax-
ing nature of the game [98, 99]. As a result, it is possible
that participation in the SCG of poker—a form of recre-
ational poker—does not entail considerable daily screen
exposure. An empirical assessment of these effects, how-
ever, is needed.
In examining substance use in the context of SCG
play, only one significant effect was observed. Specific-
ally, it was noted that adolescents classified as current
smokers had significantly greater odds of playing the
SCG of slots in comparison to former smokers and
non-smokers. All remaining types of SCGs were not
shown to be linked to substance use. While the non-sig-
nificant association between binge-drinking and social
casino gaming echoes previous results obtained from an
assessment of adults [10], the largely absent relationship
between tobacco use and social casino gaming stands in
contrast to previous findings observed among adults
Veselka et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1167 
Page 11 of 15
 [10]. In studies of monetary gambling, theories of devi-
ance have attributed the typical co-occurrence between
gambling and substance use to a general propensity to-
ward risk-taking and the seeking of short-term rewards
[59, 94]. These same theories, however, do not appear to
extend to SCG play. It may be the case that SCGs are
considered insufficiently stimulating for individuals with
a propensity toward sensation-seeking, perhaps due to
the absence of monetary wins and losses in these games.
Instead, these SCGs may attract less impulsive individ-
uals who are not drawn to risky activities, including
substance use.
The observation that only the SCG of slots exhibited a
significant association with current tobacco use requires
further investigation given that it is presently unclear
why this particular SCG alone is linked to adolescent
smoking status. Given the availability of empirical evi-
dence suggesting that both slot-machine gambling [88,
89] and tobacco use [100] are highly addictive activities,
it may be the case that individuals with a tendency to
engage in addictive behaviours may seek them out. This
explanation is particularly plausible given the consider-
able structural similarities that exist between the SCG of
slots and slot-machine games intended for monetary
gambling [76]. Additional research is needed, however,
to better understand these findings.
Although existing research pertaining to online gam-
bling suggests that poorer academic performance may
be associated with participation in gambling among ado-
lescent samples [15, 43, 44], these effects were not ob-
served in the present investigation across all three SCG
types. Rather, social casino gamers did not differ signifi-
cantly from non-gamers in terms of typical grade
achieved in school. Consequently, while achievement in
school may be relevant to monetary gambling, it does
not appear to be an key factor in defining the profiles of
social casino gamers across SCG types.
Limitations
Although every effort was made to design a study that
would yield valid findings, the present investigation is
not without its limitations. A central limitation of the
study is its cross-sectional design. While this design
allowed us to obtain large and representative data that
inform the various factors associated with social casino
gaming, it prohibits us from stating conclusively that the
factors examined are causally predictive of SCG use. The
results, however, do demonstrate key links between par-
ticipation in SCGs and personal and environmental indi-
cators relevant to adolescent populations that have
largely been unexamined by previous research endeav-
ours. As a result, the present study offers a foundation
for subsequent longitudinal analyses examining predic-
tors of adolescent SCG use.
A further limitation of the present investigation is its
reliance on self-report data, which may have been af-
fected by response bias. Specifically, participants may
have under-reported specific types of behaviours, espe-
cially those deemed socially undesirable [101], although
it has been shown that this type of self-management is
less problematic for non-pathological gambling behaviours
[102]. In an effort to offset potential issues pertinent to
self-report assessment in the present study, and to aug-
ment honest responding, we collected data through an-
onymous paper-based questionnaires, and we instructed
survey administrators to refrain from moving through the
survey location when the measures were being completed
by respondents. Although steps were taken to maximize
honest responding, the self-report nature of the measures
used in the present study did not allow us to collect infor-
mation about the gambling habits of close others directly
from participants’ peers and parents. Future investigations
may wish to include other-report measures into their de-
signs in order to obtain primary information from adoles-
cents’ friends and family regarding their own gambling
and/or SCG play.
Status of SCG play (players versus non-players) and
gambling status (gamblers versus non-gamblers) was lim-
ited to the previous three months in the present study.
This timeframe was established during the development
and validation of the GPSS of the CAGI [66], and this
same timeframe was extended to our measures of social
casino gaming in the interest of consistency. Due to our
restricted focus on the preceding three months, however,
it should be noted that the reported results provide a con-
servative estimate of the effects examined in our study.
Additionally, although the present study employed a com-
mon threshold of 100 cigarettes to determine smoking
status, we acknowledge that this criterion may be arbi-
trary, and perhaps too coarse to effectively capture the
complex nature of early experimentation with tobacco
among adolescents [70]. Furthermore, we recognize that
Facebook better reflects a medium for accessing SCGs ra-
ther than a type of SCG, and therefore our assessment of
SCGs on Facebook may have confounded point of access
with game class. Future studies of SCGs are encouraged
to assess SCG types independently from SCG mediums.
Due to the fact that the YGS was a supplementary
measure with length restrictions, it was not feasible to
assess an exhaustive list of variables potentially relevant
to SCG play. Variables that were not examined in the
present study, but that may ultimately bear relevance to
assessments of SCG player characteristics include: plat-
form of access to SCGs (e.g., social networks, apps, video
games, demo games [28], location of access to SCGs
(e.g., home versus outside of home) [28], an exhaustive
list of all possible SCGs available to players (e.g., sports
betting, bingo, blackjack) [1], and frequency of SCG play

 [30]. Subsequent investigations of SCGs are encouraged
to examine these variables in an effort to yield a more
comprehensive understanding of social casino gaming,
particularly among adolescents.
Conclusion
With the increasing convergence between gambling and
gaming activities online, as seen in part through the pro-
liferation of SCGs across various web-based platforms,
individuals are being increasingly prompted to engage in
simulated gambling behaviours [38]. This early exposure
to gambling may be particularly detrimental to adoles-
cents, who are especially avid users of SCGs, given that
it may be a risk factor in subsequent monetary and
problem gambling, as suggested in the present study and
as shown in previous research [14, 24]. However, it
should also be noted that the transition from SCG ex-
posure to subsequent gambling may be complex, and in-
fluenced by numerous biological, social, behavioural,
cognitive, emotional, and motivational factors [23, 24].
The present study identified some factors that appear to
be associated with SCG play among adolescents, includ-
ing gender, weekly spending money, smoking status,
having friends who gamble, having parents who gamble,
and screen time. Of these factors, the social influences
of peers and parents have been named as both risk and
protective factors in the transition from social casino
gaming to monetary gambling in existing path models
[23]. Specifically, while the monitoring of adolescent so-
cial casino gaming by parents has been identified as a
protective factor that inhibits the transition from SCG
play to monetary gambling, peer pressure to gamble and
the modeling of irresponsible gambling behaviour by
parents have been classified as catalysts in this same
transition. Based on the present results, existing path
models may wish to expand their scope to include the
socioeconomic status and health behaviours of players to
provide a more comprehensive overview of the manner
in which SCG play and monetary gambling may be
linked. At the same time, future studies of SCG play and
monetary gambling may wish to examine additional
factors related to these activities, as identified in existing
path models.
In aiming to develop and tailor intervention and aware-
ness strategies aimed at mitigating the potentially negative
influence of SCGs on adolescents, involved parties should
be cognizant of the personal and environmental factors
that have been implied in social casino gaming among this
cohort, including gender, availability of disposable income,
presence of peers or parents with gambling tendencies,
sedentary propensities and, to a lesser extent, tobacco use.
Further, it should be noted that generalized educational or
intervention efforts aimed at addressing all social casino
gaming among adolescents may be less effective than
programs that recognize the unique profiles of individuals
who engage in different types of SCGs. Longitudinal
research that explores the causal links between SCG
habits and the factors implicated in SCG play in the
current study are needed.
